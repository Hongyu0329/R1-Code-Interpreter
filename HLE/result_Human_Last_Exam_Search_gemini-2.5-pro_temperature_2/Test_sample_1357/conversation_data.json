    "When a genus 4 curve defined over a valuation field has a Jacobian with good reduction, the structure of its stable reduction is significantly constrained. According to the theory of stable reduction developed by Deligne and Mumford, if the Jacobian of a curve has good reduction, then the curve itself must have a stable reduction. Furthermore, the special fiber of this stable model must be a stable curve whose own generalized Jacobian is an abelian variety.\n\nThis property imposes two key topological constraints on the stable reduction:\n1.  The irreducible components of the stable reduction must be connected in a tree-like structure, meaning the dual graph of the components is a tree.\n2.  Every irreducible component of the stable reduction must have a geometric genus of at least one.\n\nThe arithmetic genus of a stable curve is given by the formula g = Σgᵢ + δ - n + 1, where gᵢ are the geometric genera of the n irreducible components, and δ is the number of nodes. For a tree structure, the number of nodes is exactly δ = n - 1. Substituting this into the formula for the genus simplifies it to g = Σgᵢ.\n\nFor a genus 4 curve, we must therefore classify the ways its stable reduction can be formed by curves of genus at least 1, whose genera sum to 4, and are connected in a tree-like fashion. This is a combinatorial problem of partitioning the number 4 and, for each partition, determining the number of distinct tree structures where the vertices are labeled by the genera of the components.\n\nThe possible partitions of the number 4 into parts greater than or equal to 1 are:\n*   4\n*   3 + 1\n*   2 + 2\n*   2 + 1 + 1\n*   1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nWe analyze the number of distinct stable reduction types corresponding to each partition:\n\n1.  **Partition: 4**\n    *   This corresponds to a single, irreducible component of genus 4. This is the case where the curve itself has good reduction.\n    *   **1 type.**\n\n2.  **Partition: 3 + 1**\n    *   This represents a stable reduction with two components: one of genus 3 and one of genus 1, connected at a single node. There is only one way to connect two distinct components.\n    *   **1 type.**\n\n3.  **Partition: 2 + 2**\n    *   This configuration consists of two components of genus 2 connected by a node. Since the two components have the same genus, there is only one way to form this structure.\n    *   **1 type.**\n\n4.  **Partition: 2 + 1 + 1**\n    *   This reduction has three components: one of genus 2, and two of genus 1. To form a tree, they must be connected by two nodes. The only tree graph for three vertices is a path. The distinct configurations depend on which component is central.\n        *   The genus 2 curve is the central component, connected to the two genus 1 curves: **(g=1)---(g=2)---(g=1)**.\n        *   A genus 1 curve is the central component, connected to the genus 2 curve and the other genus 1 curve: **(g=2)---(g=1)---(g=1)**.\n    *   These two arrangements are topologically distinct, giving **2 types.**\n\n5.  **Partition: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\n    *   This case consists of four components of genus 1 connected by three nodes in a tree structure. There are two non-isomorphic trees with four vertices:\n        *   A path graph (a chain of four curves).\n        *   A star graph (one central curve connected to the other three).\n    *   Since all components are of the same genus, these are the only two distinct configurations.\n    *   **2 types.**\n\nSumming these up gives the total number of types of stable reductions.\n\nTotal types = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
