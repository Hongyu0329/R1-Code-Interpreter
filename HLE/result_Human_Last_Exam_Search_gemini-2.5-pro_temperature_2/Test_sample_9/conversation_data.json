    "The first homology group of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area is $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n\nA detailed derivation is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identifying the Space X**: The space $X$ described is the moduli space of unimodular lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. A lattice is defined by a basis in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which can be represented by the columns of a matrix $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. The \"unit area\" condition implies that the absolute value of the determinant of this matrix is 1. By choosing an orientation for the basis, we can restrict to matrices with determinant 1, which form the special linear group $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. Two such matrices, $A_1$ and $A_2$, define the same lattice if they are related by a change of basis matrix from the special linear group over the integers, $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Therefore, the space $X$ is the quotient space $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n2.  **Topological Structure of X**: The space $X$ can be understood as a fiber bundle. The group $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ acts on the upper half-plane $\\mathcal{H}$, and the stabilizer of any point is a subgroup conjugate to $SO(2)$, the group of rotations. This gives rise to a fibration $SO(2) \\to SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\to \\mathcal{H}$. Taking the quotient by the discrete group $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ yields an orbifold fibration $S^1 \\to X \\to M$, where the fiber is the circle $S^1 \\cong SO(2)$ and the base is the modular orbifold $M = \\mathcal{H}/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n3.  **Fundamental Group of X**: The first homology group, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, is the abelianization of the fundamental group, $\\pi_1(X)$. Since $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a discrete subgroup of $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, the projection $p: SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\to X$ is a covering map. The long exact sequence of homotopy groups for this covering gives rise to the short exact sequence of groups:\n    $1 \\to \\pi_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})) \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 1$.\n    The group $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is homeomorphic to $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}^2$, so its fundamental group is $\\pi_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. This establishes that $\\pi_1(X)$ is a central extension of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ by $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n4.  **Homology Calculation via Gysin Sequence**: The Gysin sequence for the $S^1$-fibration $S^1 \\to X \\to M$ provides a powerful tool to compute the homology of $X$. The relevant part of the sequence is:\n    $H_2(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_0(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0$.\n    *   The base orbifold $M = \\mathcal{H}/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is non-compact, so its second homology group $H_2(M, \\mathbb{Z})$ is trivial.\n    *   Since $M$ is connected, its zeroth homology group is $H_0(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The first homology group of the base is the abelianization of its orbifold fundamental group, which is $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The abelianization of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the cyclic group of order 12, $H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n    Substituting these into the sequence yields the short exact sequence:\n    $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\to 0$.\n\n5.  **Splitting of the Sequence**: This sequence shows that $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is an extension of $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ by $\\mathbb{Z}$. For such an extension of a finite group by a torsion-free group, the sequence splits. This means the middle group is the direct sum of the other two.\n\nTherefore, the first homology group is the direct sum of the integers and the cyclic group of order 12.\n\nFinal Answer:\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n\n<<<$\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$>>>"
