    "To determine the IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon with molecular formula C₇H₁₄, we must systematically analyze the provided ¹³C NMR data.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Molecular Formula\nThe molecular formula is C₇H₁₄. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as follows:\nDegree of Unsaturation = C + 1 - (H/2) = 7 + 1 - (14/2) = 1.\nThis indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring in the structure.\n\n### 2. Analyze the ¹³C NMR Data\nThe spectrum shows 6 distinct signals for a molecule containing 7 carbon atoms. This means that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in a single overlapping signal.\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n*   **145(s):** The chemical shift (>100 ppm) suggests a carbon involved in a C=C double bond (sp² hybridized). The multiplicity '(s)' for singlet indicates a quaternary carbon, one with no directly attached hydrogen atoms.\n*   **112(t):** The shift also indicates an sp² carbon. The multiplicity '(t)' for a triplet means it is a CH₂ group. A CH₂ group with a shift this high is characteristic of a terminal alkene (=CH₂).\n*   **48(t):** This triplet signifies a CH₂ group in the alkane (sp³) region.\n*   **27(d):** This doublet '(d)' corresponds to a CH (methine) group in the alkane region.\n*   **22(q):** This quartet '(q)' indicates a CH₃ (methyl) group.\n*   **21(q):** This is also a quartet, signifying another CH₃ group.\n\n### 3. Identify the Overlapping Signal\nThe molecule has 7 carbons, but only 6 signals are observed. By summing up the carbons from the multiplicities (one C, two CH₂, one CH, and two CH₃), we get a total of C₆H₁₁. This is short of the C₇H₁₄ formula by one CH₃ group. Therefore, one of the quartet signals at 22 or 21 ppm must represent two chemically equivalent methyl groups.\n\nThe updated list of structural fragments is:\n*   One quaternary C (alkene)\n*   One CH₂ (alkene)\n*   One CH₂ (alkane)\n*   One CH (alkane)\n*   Three CH₃ groups (two of which are equivalent)\n\n### 4. Assemble the Structure\n1.  The signals at 145(s) and 112(t) confirm the presence of a terminal disubstituted alkene group: `>C=CH₂`.\n2.  The remaining fragments (one CH₂, one CH, and three CH₃) must form the two alkyl groups attached to the quaternary carbon. The total formula for these remaining fragments is C₅H₁₂.\n3.  The presence of two equivalent methyl groups and a single CH group strongly suggests an **isopropyl group**, `–CH(CH₃)₂`. This piece accounts for the CH signal at 27(d) and one of the methyl signals (representing two carbons).\n4.  The last two fragments are a CH₂ group and a CH₃ group. These combine to form an **ethyl group**, `–CH₂CH₃`. The CH₂ corresponds to the signal at 48(t), and the CH₃ is the final methyl signal.\n5.  Attaching the ethyl group and the isopropyl group to the quaternary carbon of the alkene unit gives the final structure.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      CH₂CH₃\n     /\n  >C=CH₂\n /\nCH(CH₃)₂\n```\n\n### 5. Determine the IUPAC Name\nTo name this structure according to IUPAC rules, we must find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n1.  The main chain must include the C=C bond, numbered C1 and C2.\n2.  The longest chain starting from C1 is `C¹H₂=C²(CH₂CH₃)—C³H(CH₃)₂`. Continuing from C2, the longest path is through the ethyl group (2 carbons) or the isopropyl group (2 carbons).\n3.  Let's trace the chain from C1=C2, through C2 into the isopropyl group: `CH₂=C(ethyl)–CH(methyl)–CH₃`. This chain is 4 carbons long (a butene). It has an ethyl group at C2 and a methyl group at C3.\n4.  The name is **2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene**. A search confirms this name for the structure with CAS number 7357-93-9.\n\nThe chemical shifts align well with this structure: The carbons of the isopropyl methyl groups are equivalent, the terminal =CH₂ gives a triplet, the quaternary C= gives a singlet, and the ethyl group gives a triplet and a quartet.\n\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene>>>"
