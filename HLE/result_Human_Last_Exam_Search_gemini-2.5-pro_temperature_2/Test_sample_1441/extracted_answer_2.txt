In the framework of scalar field theory, the critical exponent for specific heat, α, scales with the spatial dimensionality, d, for d < 4 according to the epsilon expansion, ε = 4 - d. To the first order in ε, the scaling for an O(n)-symmetric model is given by the linear relation α = ( (4 - n) / (2(n + 8)) ) * (4 - d). Higher-order terms in the expansion introduce a more complex, non-linear dependence on the dimensionality. This relationship is fundamentally connected to the scaling of the correlation length exponent ν through the hyperscaling relation α = 2 - dν.
