    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set is not a fixed total, but rather depends on the specific atoms present in a molecule. The notation specifies the number of primitives for heavy atoms (any atom other than hydrogen) and for hydrogen atoms separately.\n\nHere is the breakdown based on the 6-311G** notation:\n\n*   **For \"Heavy\" Atoms (e.g., Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen):** A total of **17 primitive Gaussians** are used. This is composed of:\n    *   11 s-type primitive Gaussians.\n    *   5 p-type primitive Gaussians.\n    *   1 d-type primitive Gaussian (from the first `*` polarization function).\n\n*   **For Hydrogen Atoms:** A total of **6 primitive Gaussians** are used. This is composed of:\n    *   5 s-type primitive Gaussians.\n    *   1 p-type primitive Gaussian (from the second `*` polarization function).\n\nTo calculate the total number of primitive Gaussians for a molecule, you multiply the number of each type of atom by its corresponding number of primitives and sum the results.\n\n### Explanation of the Notation\n\nThe name \"6-311G**\" provides the recipe for how the basis functions are constructed from primitive Gaussians:\n*   **6-**: Each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted function composed of **6** primitive Gaussians.\n*   **-311**: Each valence atomic orbital is described by three separate functions (a triple-zeta basis set). The first function is a contraction of **3** primitives, the second is a single uncontracted primitive (**1**), and the third is also a single uncontracted primitive (**1**).\n*   **G**: This simply indicates that Gaussian-type orbitals are used.\n*   **\\*\\***: This is equivalent to the notation `(d,p)` and indicates the addition of polarization functions.\n    *   The first asterisk adds a single uncontracted `d`-type Gaussian primitive to heavy atoms to allow for more angular flexibility in bonding.\n    *   The second asterisk adds a single uncontracted `p`-type Gaussian primitive to hydrogen atoms for the same reason.\n\n**Example Calculation for Methane (CHâ‚„):**\n*   1 Carbon atom (heavy atom): 1 x 17 = 17 primitives\n*   4 Hydrogen atoms: 4 x 6 = 24 primitives\n*   **Total for Methane:** 17 + 24 = 41 primitive Gaussians.\n\n<<<A 6-311G** basis set has 17 primitive Gaussians for each heavy atom and 6 primitive Gaussians for each hydrogen atom.>>>"
