    "While the exact name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in the year 1461 is not readily available in online digital archives, historical records confirm the existence of this position and identify the primary sources where the name is likely recorded.\n\nBártfa, a free royal town in the Kingdom of Hungary, had the privilege of electing its own judge, known as a 'richtár', and a town council since 1376. This administrative body was responsible for the town's legal and administrative affairs. The town was a significant center for trade and culture, and its archives from the medieval period are remarkably well-preserved.\n\nTwo key modern historical works are known to contain lists of Bardejov's judges from the 15th century:\n\n*   **\"Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata. Správa mesta Bardejov v stredoveku (1320–1526)\"** by Mária Fedorčáková. This book includes comprehensive lists of judges and town council members.\n*   **\"Bardejov v XV. storočí. Štúdie z dejín mesta\"** and the more extensive Polish monograph **\"Średniowieczny Bardiów i jego kontakty z Małopolską\"** by Stanisław Andrzej Sroka. A chapter in the former is dedicated to the judges of the 15th century, and the latter is cited as containing a list of these judges.\n\nAlthough these scholarly works hold the answer, their contents, specifically the lists of judges for the 15th century, are not digitized and publicly accessible through standard search queries. Therefore, without direct access to these publications or the physical archives of Bardejov, the name of the individual who held the position of judge in 1461 cannot be provided at this time.\n\nIn 1461, Bártfa was an active town involved in regional affairs, as evidenced by its participation in the siege of Sáros in July of that year. The town council and its judge would have played a crucial role in such events. While a letter from 1465 is addressed to the \"judge and lay judges of Bártfa,\" it does not mention their names. Another known judge, Andrew Rawber, is mentioned in the context of the years 1499-1500.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide the name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461 based on the available information.>>>"
