    "Based on my analysis, the approach of storing one string in a buffer and reading the second string character by character is the most memory-efficient way to solve this problem under the given constraints. The alternative of storing both strings is correct but uses more memory. An approach that doesn't store at least one string is not feasible due to the sequential nature of standard input.\n\nHere is the most memory-efficient C program to solve this problem:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/**\n * This program compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case.\n * It is designed to be memory-efficient.\n *\n * Input:\n * Two lines, each containing a string of the same length (1-100 characters),\n * consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n *\n * Output:\n * - \"-1\" if the first string is less than the second.\n * - \"1\" if the second string is less than the first.\n * - \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n *\n * Memory Efficiency Strategy:\n * To minimize memory usage, the program reads the first string into a buffer.\n * It then reads the second string one character at a time from the input stream\n * and performs the comparison on-the-fly. This avoids allocating a second\n * buffer for the other string. The variables used are selected to have the\n * smallest appropriate data types.\n */\nint main(void) {\n    // A buffer to hold the first string.\n    // Size is 101 to accommodate a string of length 100 plus the null terminator ('\\0').\n    char first_string[101];\n\n    // Variable to hold characters of the second string read from stdin.\n    // It must be an `int` to properly handle the End-Of-File (EOF) value.\n    int second_char;\n\n    // Index for iterating through the first_string.\n    // `unsigned char` is used as it's the smallest integer type (1 byte)\n    // that can hold values from 0 to 100.\n    unsigned char i = 0;\n\n    // Read the first string from standard input.\n    // scanf(\"%s\", ...) reads a sequence of non-whitespace characters.\n    scanf(\"%s\", first_string);\n\n    // Loop through the first string (which is now in the buffer).\n    while (first_string[i] != '\\0') {\n        // Read one character from the input stream.\n        second_char = getchar();\n\n        // If the character read is not an alphabet letter, it's likely whitespace\n        // (like the newline character between the two input strings).\n        // In that case, we skip it and read the next one.\n        if (!isalpha(second_char)) {\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        // Convert the corresponding characters from both strings to lowercase for a\n        // case-insensitive comparison. The cast to (unsigned char) is a safe\n        // practice when passing characters to ctype functions.\n        int lower_char1 = tolower((unsigned char)first_string[i]);\n        int lower_char2 = tolower((unsigned char)second_char);\n\n        // Perform the lexicographical comparison.\n        if (lower_char1 < lower_char2) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit after finding the result.\n        }\n        if (lower_char1 > lower_char2) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit after finding the result.\n        }\n\n        // If characters are equal, move to the next character.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop finishes, it means all characters were equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Calculation of Memory Usage (m)\n\nThe total memory `m` used for the variables in this program is the sum of the sizes of all variables declared within the `main` function. On a typical competitive programming platform (usually a 32-bit or 64-bit Linux environment), the sizes are as follows:\n\n*   **`char first_string[101]`**: An array to store a string of maximum length 100 plus one null terminator.\n    *   `sizeof(first_string)` = 101 bytes.\n*   **`int second_char`**: An integer to hold the character read by `getchar()`, which returns an `int` to accommodate the special `EOF` value.\n    *   `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n*   **`unsigned char i`**: An index for the loop. Since the maximum string length is 100, `unsigned char` (range 0-255) is sufficient and is the most memory-efficient integer type.\n    *   `sizeof(unsigned char)` = 1 byte.\n\nTotal memory `m` = `101 bytes + 4 bytes + 1 byte` = **106 bytes**.\n\n<<<106>>>"
