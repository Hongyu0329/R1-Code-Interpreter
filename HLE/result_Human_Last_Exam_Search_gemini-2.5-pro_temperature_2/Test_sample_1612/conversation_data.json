    "In Major League Baseball, there have been 17 Triple Crown winners. This prestigious accomplishment is awarded to a batter who leads their league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in the same season.\n\nThe most recent player to achieve this feat was Miguel Cabrera in 2012 while playing for the Detroit Tigers. Before Cabrera, the last Triple Crown was won by Carl Yastrzemski in 1967.\n\nHere is a list of all 17 winners:\n*   **Miguel Cabrera** (2012), Detroit Tigers\n*   **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967), Boston Red Sox\n*   **Frank Robinson** (1966), Baltimore Orioles\n*   **Mickey Mantle** (1956), New York Yankees\n*   **Ted Williams** (1947 and 1942), Boston Red Sox\n*   **Joe Medwick** (1937), St. Louis Cardinals\n*   **Lou Gehrig** (1934), New York Yankees\n*   **Jimmie Foxx** (1933), Philadelphia Athletics\n*   **Chuck Klein** (1933), Philadelphia Phillies\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1925 and 1922), St. Louis Cardinals\n*   **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912), Chicago Cubs\n*   **Ty Cobb** (1909), Detroit Tigers\n*   **Nap Lajoie** (1901), Philadelphia Athletics\n*   **Hugh Duffy** (1894), Boston Beaneaters\n*   **Tip O'Neill** (1887), St. Louis Browns\n*   **Paul Hines** (1878), Providence Grays\n\nIt is worth noting that with the recent integration of Negro Leagues statistics into MLB records, several other players are now also recognized as Triple Crown winners, which would bring the total to 28. These players include Oscar Charleston (who won three times), Josh Gibson (twice), Ted Strong, Lennie Pearson, Willie Wells, Mule Suttles, and Heavy Johnson. However, the count of 17 represents the winners from the American and National Leagues. Four players have won the award multiple times: Ted Williams, Rogers Hornsby, Oscar Charleston, and Josh Gibson.\n\n<<<17>>>"
