    "The largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the merchant ship **S.S. Arijon**. The ship, with a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 4,374 tons, was sunk by the German submarine U-43 on November 22, 1939.\n\nThe armistice between France and Germany was signed on June 22, 1940, and came into effect on June 25, 1940. Prior to this date, a number of French vessels were lost to enemy action.\n\nWhile several French warships were sunk during the Battle of France, particularly during the Dunkirk evacuation in May and June 1940, records indicate that the largest of these were not lost to U-boat attacks. For instance:\n*   The destroyer **Jaguar**, with a standard displacement of 2,126 tons, was sunk by German S-boats (E-boats) on May 23, 1940.\n*   The destroyer **Chacal**, also with a standard displacement of 2,126 tons, was sunk by German bombers and artillery on May 24, 1940.\n*   The destroyer **Siroco**, with a standard displacement of 1,320 tons, was sunk by German S-boats on May 31, 1940.\n*   The destroyer **Bourrasque**, with a standard displacement of 1,320 tons, was sunk by a mine on May 30, 1940.\n\nThe only confirmed French warship sunk by a U-boat during this period was the submarine **Doris**, with a surface displacement of 552 tons, which was sunk by U-9 on May 8, 1940.\n\nTherefore, the merchant ship **Arijon**, at 4,374 GRT, stands as the largest French vessel sunk by a U-boat before the armistice.\n\n<<<S.S. Arijon>>>"
