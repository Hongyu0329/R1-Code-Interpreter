    "In mathematics, the question of determining the number of connected components in the intersection of two sets with specific properties is a fundamental problem in topology. For the case of two closed and connected subsets of a plane whose union forms a unit square, there is no theoretical upper limit to the number of components their intersection can have. Therefore, the largest number of components can be infinite.\n\nA well-known result in topology states that the intersection of two connected sets is not necessarily connected. In the plane, it is possible for the intersection of two connected sets to have infinitely many components.\n\nTo understand how this is possible, consider an example involving the \"topologist's sine curve.\" Let one set, A, be the graph of the function y = sin(1/x) for x in the interval (0, 1], combined with the vertical line segment from (0, -1) to (0, 1). This set is connected. Let another set, B, be constructed similarly but with y = -sin(1/x), also including the same vertical line segment. Set B is also connected.\n\nThe union of these two specifically constructed sets can be designed to fill the unit square. Their intersection, however, would consist of the vertical line segment at x=0, along with an infinite number of isolated points where sin(1/x) = -sin(1/x), which occurs when sin(1/x) = 0. This happens at x = 1/(kπ) for all integers k ≥ 1. These points, along with the connecting segment, form an infinite number of connected components.\n\nWhile simple examples might suggest a small number of components—for instance, two rectangles overlapping in a single, connected region—more complex constructions demonstrate that the number of components can be made arbitrarily large, and even infinite.\n\nThus, for two closed connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square, there is no finite maximum for the number of components in their intersection.\n\n<<<infinity>>>"
