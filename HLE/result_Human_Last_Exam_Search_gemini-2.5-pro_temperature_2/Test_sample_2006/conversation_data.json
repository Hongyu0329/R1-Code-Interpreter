    "The haiku describes the downfall of Cleopatra in 30 B.C. and the subsequent annexation of Egypt by Rome.\n\n*   **\"An August tempest\"** refers to the dramatic events of August 30 B.C., which saw the death of Cleopatra. This period marked the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty and a significant shift in power in the ancient world.\n\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"** is a direct reference to the year 30 B.C. The number 30 (twice fifteen) signifies a pivotal moment of transformation, as Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire.\n\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"** points to Cleopatra herself. As the last pharaoh of Egypt, she was considered a living goddess, an embodiment of Isis. Her suicide was a final act of yielding to the conquering Roman forces led by Octavian.\n\nThe title, \"The Bays,\" sets the geographical scene. Cleopatra's mausoleum and palace were located in the bay of Alexandria, a place central to the final events of her life.\n\nThe question asks for the answer in alphabetical order, suggesting that the solution is a single letter. The most fitting answer is \"C.\" This represents Cleopatra, the central figure of this historical drama. The letter also alludes to Caesar, whose relationship with Cleopatra and whose assassination were key catalysts in the \"winds of change.\"\n\n<<<C>>>"
