    "The initial search results provide a good overview of the cap set problem. They explain that the problem seeks to find the maximum size of a subset of (Z/3Z)^n where no three elements sum to zero. The sequence of maximum cap set sizes for small dimensions is given as 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, 45, 112, .... This sequence directly provides the exact size for several dimensions. However, the query was for a *lower bound* in dimension 8. While the exact value would be the tightest possible lower bound, it is useful to confirm this with more targeted searches. The search results also discuss asymptotic lower bounds of the form c^n, but these are for large n and not specific to dimension 8.The search results from the previous step and this one provide a consistent picture. Specifically, the OEIS sequence A090245 and the Wikipedia article on cap sets give the sequence of known maximum sizes for small dimensions. These are 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, 45, 112, ... corresponding to dimensions n=1 through n=7. For n=8, one of the search results provides a table with the best known lower and upper bounds. It is now clear what the best known lower bound is. No further searching is required. I can now proceed to formulate the final answer.\n\nThe best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 496. A cap set is a subset of points in an affine space over the field of 3 elements, such that no three points are collinear. The size of the largest possible cap set in dimension *n* is a well-studied problem in combinatorics.\n\nFor lower dimensions, the exact maximum sizes are known:\n-   Dimension 1: 2\n-   Dimension 2: 4\n-   Dimension 3: 9\n-   Dimension 4: 20\n-   Dimension 5: 45.\n-   Dimension 6: 112.\n\nFor dimensions greater than 6, the exact maximum size is not known. However, research has established bounds. A table in a 2018 paper on the topic lists the best known lower and upper bounds for dimensions up to 10. For dimension 8, the best known lower bound is listed as 496.The search results consistently confirm the known exact values for dimensions up to 6. The OEIS sequence A090245, which lists the maximum size of cap sets, includes the values 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, 45, 112. A paper by Davis and Maclagan (2018) provides a table with the best known lower and upper bounds for the size of a maximal 1-cap in F<sub>3</sub><sup>n</sup> for n up to 10. For dimension 8, this table explicitly states a lower bound of 496. This is the most direct and specific piece of information found.\n\nBased on this, I have sufficient information to answer the user's question.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\n- State the best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8.\n- Cite the source that provides this information directly from a table of known bounds.\n- Briefly mention the known exact values for lower dimensions to provide context.\n- Compare the established lower bound with the given answer choices.\n- Select the correct answer choice.The best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 496.\n\nA cap set is a collection of points in an n-dimensional space over a field of three elements where no three points lie on a line. Determining the maximum possible size of a cap set for a given dimension is a challenging problem in combinatorics.\n\nFor the initial dimensions, the exact maximum sizes are known:\n*   Dimension 1: 2\n*   Dimension 2: 4\n*   Dimension 3: 9\n*   Dimension 4: 20\n*   Dimension 5: 45\n*   Dimension 6: 112\n*   Dimension 7: The OEIS sequence A090245, which tracks maximum cap set sizes, lists 112 for dimension 6 but does not provide a confirmed value for dimension 7 or 8.\n\nFor dimensions higher than 6, the exact values have not been definitively determined, and researchers instead work with lower and upper bounds. According to a 2018 paper by Davis and Maclagan, which presents a table of the best-known bounds for maximal cap sets, the lower bound for dimension 8 is 496.\n\nComparing this information to the provided answer choices:\nA. 224\nB. 16\nC. 512\nD. 80\nE. 45\nF. 496\n\nThe value of 496 matches one of the options.\n\n<<<F>>>"
