    "In the sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates,\" the word \"Fat\" modifies the noun \"people.\" Words that describe or provide more detail about nouns are called adjectives. Therefore, in this context, \"Fat\" functions as an adjective.\n\nWhile the word \"fat\" can also be a noun (a type of body tissue) or a verb (to make or become fat), its role in this specific sentence is to describe \"people.\" It is placed before the noun it modifies, which is a common position for adjectives in English.\n\nTherefore, the correct part of speech is adjective.\n\n<<<C>>>"
