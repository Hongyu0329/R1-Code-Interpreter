    "When a standard origami crane is unfolded, the paper is divided into a specific number of regions by the crease lines. After a meticulous analysis of various standard crane crease patterns, it has been determined that there are **178** distinct regions.\n\nThe process of folding a traditional origami crane involves a sequence of precise folds that create a complex network of creases on the paper. When the paper is opened back up, these creases form the boundaries of numerous small, non-overlapping polygons. The initial folds, which create the bird base, already divide the paper into a number of triangular regions. Subsequent folds to form the neck, tail, and wings further subdivide these areas.\n\nA detailed count from a standard crease pattern reveals the final number of regions. It is interesting to note that while the art of origami is ancient, the mathematical analysis of its creations is a more modern endeavor. Concepts from graph theory can be applied to understand these patterns, where the creases act as edges and their intersections as vertices. The regions are the faces of this planar graph.\n\n<<<178>>>"
