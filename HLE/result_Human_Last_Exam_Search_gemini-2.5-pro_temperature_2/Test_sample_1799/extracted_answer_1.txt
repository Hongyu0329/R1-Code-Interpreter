It is not true that the 2nd postulate is superfluous and can be deduced from the first. While there are strong connections between the two, particularly when considering Maxwell's equations, the second postulate is generally considered an independent and necessary component of the theory of special relativity. It serves to establish the fundamental kinematic structure of the universe by asserting the existence of a finite, invariant speed.
