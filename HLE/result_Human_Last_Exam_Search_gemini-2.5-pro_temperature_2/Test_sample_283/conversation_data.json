    "In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix, the structure is represented by a hierarchical tree, which is typically a full binary tree for simplicity and optimal performance. The matrix operations, including matrix multiplication, are performed by traversing this tree.\n\nA full binary tree with a depth of `d` (where the root is at level 0 and the leaves are at level `d`) has a total of `d+1` levels. The number of nodes at each level `l` is given by 2<sup>l</sup>. The total number of nodes in such a tree is `2^(d+1) - 1`.\n\nFor a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with a depth of 4, we have:\n*   **Level 0 (root):** 2<sup>0</sup> = 1 node\n*   **Level 1:** 2<sup>1</sup> = 2 nodes\n*   **Level 2:** 2<sup>2</sup> = 4 nodes\n*   **Level 3:** 2<sup>3</sup> = 8 nodes\n*   **Level 4 (leaves):** 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 nodes\n\nThe total number of nodes is the sum of the nodes at each level: 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31.\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total number of nodes is 2<sup>(4+1)</sup> - 1 = 2<sup>5</sup> - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31.\n\nThe HSS matrix multiplication algorithm involves two main stages: a bottom-to-top pass and a top-to-bottom pass through the tree. During this process, the generator submatrices stored at each node are utilized. These include:\n*   Dense diagonal blocks (`D` matrices) at each of the 16 leaf nodes.\n*   Generator matrices (`U`, `V`, and `B` matrices) at each of the 15 non-leaf nodes.\n\nSince the algorithm traverses the entire tree and performs operations at every node, the submatrices corresponding to all nodes are accessed during the multiplication. Therefore, the number of submatrices (or more accurately, sets of generator submatrices) accessed is equal to the total number of nodes in the tree.\n\nFor a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with depth 4, this number is 31.\n\n<<<31>>>"
