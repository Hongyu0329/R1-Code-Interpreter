The problem is an optimization program where the goal is to maximize the number of spheres subject to non-overlapping and containment constraints. A suitable software package to solve this would be a nonlinear programming solver like those available in MATLAB or AMPL, or a physics-based simulator like Blender. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, a precise number cannot be given without computation, but an estimate based on geometry and known packing densities suggests a range of 50-65 spheres.
