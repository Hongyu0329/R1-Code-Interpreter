    "The user wants to compute the determinant of the given matrix A.\n\nThe provided matrix is:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated as follows:\ndet(A) = 2 * (2 * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) - (-1) * ((-1) * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) + (-1) * ((-1) * (-1) - 2 * (-1))\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * 3 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6\ndet(A) = 0\n\nThe information about the \"Markov quiver for m_{1/2} = 13\" appears to be contextual. The matrix A is related to the Markov equation, which is associated with Markov numbers and quivers. The matrix provided is a well-known matrix in this context, sometimes referred to as the Cartan matrix of the affine Dynkin diagram $\\tilde{A}_2$. The determinant of the Cartan matrix for an affine Lie algebra is always zero. This confirms the result of the direct calculation. Regardless of the context of the Markov quiver, the determinant of the explicitly provided matrix A is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
