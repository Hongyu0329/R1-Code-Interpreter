    "Finite Weyl groups are classified by their associated crystallographic root systems, which in turn are classified by Dynkin diagrams. The rank of a Weyl group corresponds to the number of vertices in its associated Dynkin diagram. To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to count the number of distinct connected Dynkin diagrams with four vertices.\n\nThe connected Dynkin diagrams are classified into four infinite families (A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n) and five exceptional cases (E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, G_2). We are interested in those with a rank of 4, which means n=4 for the infinite families and we also consider the exceptional diagram F_4 which is of rank 4.\n\nThe possible connected Dynkin diagrams of rank 4 are:\n*   **A₄**: The diagram with four vertices in a line.\n*   **B₄**: The diagram with four vertices in a line and a double edge with an arrow between the last two.\n*   **C₄**: The diagram with four vertices in a line and a double edge with an arrow in the opposite direction of B₄ between the last two.\n*   **D₄**: The diagram with a central vertex connected to three others.\n*   **F₄**: The exceptional diagram with four vertices.\n\nWhile the root systems for B_n and C_n are different, their corresponding Weyl groups are isomorphic. Therefore, W(B₄) and W(C₄) represent the same isomorphism class of Weyl groups.\n\nThis leaves us with the following distinct, non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, corresponding to their Dynkin diagrams:\n\n1.  W(A₄)\n2.  W(B₄) ≅ W(C₄)\n3.  W(D₄)\n4.  W(F₄)\n\nThus, there are four non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
