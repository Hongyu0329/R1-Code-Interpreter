    "By applying the cellular automaton Rule 110 for 20 successive steps starting from a single cell in state 1, the following binary pattern is generated: `1111101101`.\n\nTo arrive at this result, the rules of this one-dimensional cellular automaton were iteratively applied. In Rule 110, the state of a cell (either 0 or 1) in the next generation is determined by its own state and the states of its immediate left and right neighbors. The complete set of rules for Rule 110, based on the 8 possible three-cell neighborhood configurations, is as follows:\n\n| Current Neighborhood | New State for Center Cell |\n|:--------------------:|:-------------------------:|\n|          111         |             0             |\n|          110         |             1             |\n|          101         |             1             |\n|          100         |             0             |\n|          011         |             1             |\n|          010         |             1             |\n|          001         |             1             |\n|          000         |             0             |\n\nThe evolution of the pattern, assuming an infinite background of zeros, proceeds as follows:\n*   **t=0:** 1\n*   **t=1:** 11\n*   **t=2:** 111\n*   **t=3:** 1101\n*   **t=4:** 11111\n*   **t=5:** 110001\n*   **t=6:** 110011\n*   **t=7:** 110111\n*   **t=8:** 1111101\n*   **t=9:** 11000111\n*   **t=10:** 11001101\n*   **t=11:** 11011111\n*   **t=12:** 11111001\n*   **t=13:** 110001011\n*   **t=14:** 110011111\n*   **t=15:** 110110001\n*   **t=16:** 111110011\n*   **t=17:** 1100010111\n*   **t=18:** 1100111101\n*   **t=19:** 1101100111\n*   **t=20:** 1111101101\n\n<<<1111101101>>>"
