    "### The Three Longest Rivers in Virgil's Aeneid\n\nThe three longest real rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic poem, the *Aeneid*, are the Hebrus, the Tiber, and the Aufidus. While the epic also famously features mythological rivers of the underworld, these three terrestrial rivers are notable for their significant lengths.\n\n**1. Hebrus (Modern Maritsa or Evros)**\nThe Hebrus river, which flows through the historical region of Thrace, is the longest of the real-world rivers mentioned in the *Aeneid*. Depending on the source, its length is cited as being between 480 and 530 kilometers (approximately 298 to 329 miles). The river is referenced in the context of the Thracian landscape in the epic.\n\n**2. Tiber (Italian: Tevere)**\nThe Tiber is the most significant river in the narrative of the *Aeneid*, as it is on its banks that Aeneas and the Trojans are destined to found their new city, which would become Rome. It is the third-longest river in Italy, with a length of approximately 406 kilometers (252 miles).\n\n**3. Aufidus (Modern Ofanto)**\nLocated in the Apulia region of southern Italy, the Aufidus is another notable river mentioned in the epic. Its length is approximately 170 kilometers (about 106 miles), making it the third longest of the real rivers in the *Aeneid*.\n\nWhile other real rivers such as the Metaurus (around 121 km), Anio (99 km), Sarnus (24 km), and the much smaller Timavus, Galaesus, and Numicus are also named, they are all considerably shorter than the Aufidus. The famous rivers of the underworld like the Styx, Acheron, and Phlegethon are central to Aeneas's journey in Book VI but, as mythological entities, they do not possess a literal, measurable length.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Hebrus, the Tiber, and the Aufidus.>>>"
