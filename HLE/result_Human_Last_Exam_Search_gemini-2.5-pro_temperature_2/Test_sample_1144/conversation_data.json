    "To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit, we will first calculate the two values independently and then find their ratio.\n\n**1. Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp)**\n\nAccording to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, the product of the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is at least the reduced Planck constant (ħ) divided by 2. The minimum uncertainty is given by the equation:\n\nΔp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\nGiven:\n*   Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m\n*   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nCalculation:\nΔp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10 x 10⁻¹² m)\nΔp = 5.27 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**2. Momentum in the First Bohr Orbit (p)**\n\nIn the Bohr model of the atom, the angular momentum of an electron is quantized. For an electron in the first Bohr orbit (n=1), the angular momentum (L) is equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ).\n\nL = mvr = ħ\n\nWhere:\n*   m is the mass of the electron\n*   v is the velocity of the electron\n*   r is the radius of the orbit\n*   The linear momentum (p) is mv.\n\nFrom the angular momentum equation, we can derive the linear momentum:\n\np = mv = ħ / r\n\nFor the first Bohr orbit, the radius 'r' is the Bohr radius (a₀).\n\np = ħ / a₀\n\nGiven:\n*   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   Bohr radius (a₀) ≈ 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m\n\nCalculation:\np = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m)\np = 1.99 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**3. Ratio of Uncertainty of Momentum to Momentum**\n\nNow, we calculate the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum:\n\nRatio = Δp / p\nRatio = (5.27 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s) / (1.99 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s)\nRatio ≈ 2.65\n\nA more direct way to calculate the ratio is by dividing the expression for Δp by the expression for p:\n\nRatio = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a₀)\nRatio = a₀ / (2 * Δx)\nRatio = (5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m) / (2 * 10 x 10⁻¹² m)\nRatio = 2.645\n\nThus, the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum is approximately 2.65.\n\n<<<2.65>>>"
