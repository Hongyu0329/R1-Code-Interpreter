(a) The diversity order for code $\mathbf{S}_a$ is 1, for code $\mathbf{S}_b$ is 1, and for code $\mathbf{S}_c$ is 2.

(b) Code $\mathbf{S}_c$ provides the maximum directivity. It is the only full-diversity code and is also an orthogonal design, which ensures the best performance against channel fading.
