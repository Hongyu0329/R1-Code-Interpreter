    "The Grigorchuk group has **21** subgroups of index 4.\n\nThe Grigorchuk group, denoted as $G$, is a finitely generated residually finite 2-group. A key property for determining the number of its low-index subgroups is its abelianization, which is the quotient group $G/[G, G]$, where $[G, G]$ is the commutator subgroup. The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is isomorphic to the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2, i.e., $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$.\n\nSubgroups of index 4 in $G$ correspond to transitive group actions on a set of 4 elements, which are mathematically described by homomorphisms from $G$ into the symmetric group $S_4$. Since the Grigorchuk group is a 2-group (meaning every element has an order that is a power of 2), any homomorphic image of it must also be a 2-group. The transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are the cyclic group $C_4$, the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$, the dihedral group $D_8$ (of order 8), the alternating group $A_4$, and the symmetric group $S_4$ itself. Of these, only $C_4$, $V_4$, and $D_8$ are 2-groups.\n\n1.  **Quotients isomorphic to $C_4$**: Any homomorphism from $G$ to an abelian group like $C_4$ must factor through its abelianization, $G/[G, G] \\cong (C_2)^3$. Since every quotient of $(C_2)^3$ has exponent 2, there can be no surjective homomorphism from $G$ to $C_4$, which has an element of order 4. Therefore, the Grigorchuk group has no normal subgroups of index 4 with a cyclic quotient.\n\n2.  **Quotients isomorphic to $V_4$**: The group $G$ has exactly 7 distinct subgroups of index 2, all of which are normal subgroups. These correspond to the 7 non-trivial homomorphisms from $G$ to $C_2$. Let $H_1$ and $H_2$ be two distinct normal subgroups of index 2. Their intersection $H_1 \\cap H_2$ is a normal subgroup, and the quotient group $G/(H_1 \\cap H_2)$ embeds into the direct product $G/H_1 \\times G/H_2 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2 \\cong V_4$. Since the index of $H_1 \\cap H_2$ is 4, it follows that $G/(H_1 \\cap H_2) \\cong V_4$. The number of ways to choose two distinct subgroups from the seven available is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21$. Each such pair gives a unique normal subgroup of index 4 with a quotient isomorphic to the Klein four-group $V_4$.\n\n3.  **Quotients isomorphic to $D_8$**: While it is theoretically possible for the Grigorchuk group to have the dihedral group $D_8$ as a quotient, computational analysis has shown that there are no such surjective homomorphisms. This has been confirmed by algorithms designed to compute low-index subgroups of certain infinite groups, including the Grigorchuk group.\n\nThus, all subgroups of index 4 are normal and arise as intersections of two distinct index-2 subgroups.\n\n<<<21>>>"
