    "When viewed from above, the adjacent buildings of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa form the letter E.\n\nThe two schools are located next to each other on Via Benedetto Croce, a street sometimes referred to as the \"Via dei Licei\" (Street of the High Schools). The structures of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the Liceo Ulisse Dini are connected and even share an internal courtyard.
