    "The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is \"1 Earthquake,\" which corresponds to a day in the Zapotec calendar. This date is inscribed on a stone monument, known as Monument 3, discovered at the archaeological site of San José Mogote in the Oaxaca Valley of Mexico. The monument is attributed to the Zapotec civilization and is dated to approximately 600 BCE.\n\nThe inscription on Monument 3 is considered one of the earliest examples of writing in Mesoamerica. It features a relief of a captive, believed to be a sacrificial victim, with two glyphs between his legs that represent his name or the day of his sacrifice. The glyphs are interpreted as \"1 Earthquake\" or \"1 Motion,\" signifying a specific day in the 260-day Zapotec ritual calendar. This calendar system, along with a logosyllabic writing system, was developed by the Zapotecs.\n\nWhile there is evidence of earlier writing systems in Mesoamerica, such as the Olmec script, the inscription on Monument 3 from San José Mogote is widely regarded as the earliest definitive recording of a specific date. The discovery of this monument provided crucial evidence that Zapotec writing predates that of the Maya by several centuries.\n\nThe artifact itself, a flat carved stone, was found placed as a doorstep to a ceremonial structure. Its imagery and inscription are seen as a form of political propaganda, intended to intimidate enemies. The style of depicting slain captives was later used extensively at the larger Zapotec center of Monte Albán.\n\n<<<\"1 Earthquake\", circa 600 BCE>>>"
