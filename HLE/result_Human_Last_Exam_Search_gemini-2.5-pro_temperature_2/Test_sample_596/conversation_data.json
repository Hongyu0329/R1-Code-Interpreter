    "A higher dimensional rooted forest of a simplicial complex is a pair $(F, R)$ where $F$ is a d-dimensional forest and R is a root of F. A key result states that a rooted forest $(F, R)$ in a closed d-manifold simplicially collapses onto its root $R$ if and only if the relative homology group $H_{d-1}(F, R)$ is trivial.\n\nFor orientable manifolds, it has been shown that for any rooted forest $(F,R)$, the forest F simplicially collapses to the root R. This is because in a closed, orientable, triangulated manifold, the relative homology group $H_{d-1}(F,R)$ is always trivial.\n\nHowever, the Möbius band is a non-orientable manifold. For non-orientable manifolds, it is not guaranteed that a forest will simplicially collapse onto any of its roots. In fact, examples of fitting orientations having closed cycles on rooted forests of triangulations of the Möbius strip have been presented, which are related to the failure of simplicial collapse. A paper by Sajal Kumar Mukherjee states that for any rooted forest (F, R) in a closed manifold M, the forest F simplicially collapses onto its root R if and only if H d − 1 (F, R) is trivial. The same paper provides a combinatorial interpretation for the size of this homology group.\n\nWhile the precise number of such failing forests for the standard triangulation is not explicitly stated in the search results, the literature consistently points out that such failures to collapse do exist for the Möbius strip due to its non-orientability, in contrast to the case for orientable manifolds where all rooted forests collapse. The failure is linked to the existence of non-trivial cycles in the fitting orientations of the rooted forests.\n\nTherefore, there is at least one such higher dimensional rooted forest. Without a specific formula or enumeration for the standard triangulation of the Möbius band in the provided abstracts, a precise number cannot be given. However, the literature strongly indicates that the number is non-zero. The failure of simplicial collapse is a key feature of rooted forests on non-orientable manifolds like the Möbius band.\n\nBased on the repeated illustration of the concept with the Möbius band, it's a prime example of this phenomenon.\n\nThe question is highly specific and likely has a definite numerical answer within the specialized literature that is not fully captured by the search results. Based on the available information, the existence of such forests is confirmed, but their exact number for the \"standard\" triangulation is not provided. However, the examples provided in the literature, for instance, in Figure 4 of \"On discrete gradient vector fields and Laplacians of simplicial complexes,\" suggest that there are specific, enumerable instances of this phenomenon. Without access to the full text and the specific enumeration for a \"standard\" triangulation, a definitive integer answer is not possible. However, the literature confirms this is a known phenomenon on the Möbius strip.\n\n<<<There is at least one such higher dimensional rooted forest.>>>"
