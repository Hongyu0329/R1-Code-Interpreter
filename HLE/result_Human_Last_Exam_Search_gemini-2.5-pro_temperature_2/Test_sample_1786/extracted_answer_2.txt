The appropriate formula is $F(r,z,nz) = (S_z) \oplus (C_r \multimap S_{nz})$.

Here is a breakdown of why this formula works:

*   The main instruction axiom is `!(S_l \multimap F(r,z,nz))`. When the machine is in state `l`, this axiom consumes `S_l` and adds `(S_z) \oplus (C_r \multimap S_{nz})` to the context.
*   The `\oplus` connective forces a choice between proving the goal from the left-hand side (`S_z`) or the right-hand side (`C_r \multimap S_{nz}`). A derivation is successful if at least one of these choices leads to the final state.

Let's analyze the two scenarios for the value of counter `x_r`:

1.  **If counter `r` is zero (`x_r=0`)**: The multiset of resources does not contain any `C_r`.
    *   If we choose the right branch, `C_r \multimap S_{nz}`, the proof gets stuck. The linear implication cannot be resolved because there is no `C_r` resource to consume.
    *   Therefore, the only viable path for the proof is to choose the left branch, `S_z`. The context now contains `S_z` along with the other counter literals, correctly representing the new state `(z, x)`.

2.  **If counter `r` is non-zero (`x_r>0`)**: The multiset of resources contains at least one `C_r`.
    *   We can choose the left branch, `S_z`. This path is logically possible, but it does not consume a `C_r` resource. This `C_r` would remain in the context. Since the machine accepts only when it reaches `(final, (0, \dots, 0))`, any leftover `C_r` resources at the end of the computation would cause the overall derivation to fail. Thus, this path, while temporarily viable, will not lead to a successful proof of acceptance.
    *   The only correct choice is the right branch, `C_r \multimap S_{nz}`. This consumes one `C_r` resource from the context and adds `S_{nz}`. This perfectly models the decrementing of the counter and the transition to the new instruction `nz`.

The provided `\Delta` formulas are not necessary for the encoding of the `JZDEC` instruction itself but would be relevant for alternative encoding strategies or for proving properties about the logic itself.
