    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which a given polynomial $f(x)$ with integer coefficients remains irreducible modulo $p$ is determined by the structure of its Galois group. This density is given by the Chebotarev Density Theorem, which states that the proportion of primes for which the factorization of $f(x)$ modulo $p$ has a certain structure is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group of $f(x)$ that have a corresponding cycle structure.\n\nFor the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ to be irreducible modulo a prime $p$, its factorization must consist of a single irreducible factor of degree 7. According to Dedekind's theorem, this corresponds to the Frobenius element of $p$ in the Galois group acting as a 7-cycle on the roots of the polynomial. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the proportion of 7-cycles in the Galois group of $f(x)$.\n\nThe Galois group of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ over the rational numbers is known to be the Frobenius group $F_{42}$, also denoted as $C_7 \\rtimes C_6$ or the general affine group GA(1,7). This group has an order of 42. It can be represented as the set of affine transformations on the integers modulo 7, of the form $z \\mapsto az+b$, where $a \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^*$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nTo find the density, we need to count the number of elements in $F_{42}$ that act as a 7-cycle. A permutation on a set of 7 elements is a 7-cycle if and only if it has no fixed points. For an affine transformation $z \\mapsto az+b$, a fixed point is a solution to the equation $z = az+b$, which can be rewritten as $(1-a)z = b$.\n\nWe analyze the possibilities for the value of $a$:\n1.  If $a=1$, the equation becomes $0=b$.\n    *   If $b=0$, the transformation is the identity ($z \\mapsto z$), which has 7 fixed points.\n    *   If $b \\neq 0$ (6 choices for $b$), the equation $0=b$ has no solution. Thus, these transformations have no fixed points and are 7-cycles.\n2.  If $a \\neq 1$ ($a \\in \\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$), then $(1-a)$ is a non-zero element in $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$ and thus has a multiplicative inverse. In this case, there is a unique solution for $z$, namely $z = b(1-a)^{-1}$. This means any such transformation has exactly one fixed point and is therefore not a 7-cycle.\n\nCounting the 7-cycles, we find there are 6 such elements in the group $F_{42}$. Since the order of the group is 42, the proportion of 7-cycles is the ratio of their count to the order of the group.\n\nThe density is therefore $\\frac{6}{42} = \\frac{1}{7}$.\n\n<<<1/7>>>"
