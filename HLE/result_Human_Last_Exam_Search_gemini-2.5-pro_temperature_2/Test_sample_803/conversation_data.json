    "Based on the existing research on filled finite groups, specifically the classification of filled soluble groups, the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and a natural number `m` can be determined.\n\nA pivotal result in this area is the classification of filled groups of order `p^n * q^m`, where `p` and `q` are primes. A paper by C.S. Anabanti titled \"On filled soluble groups\" published in Communications in Algebra in 2018, and a subsequent presentation by the same author, provide a comprehensive classification. The main theorem states that any finite filled group of order `p^n * q^m` must be either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of the following: D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, D8 × C2, D22, D8 ∗ Q8, or (D8 ∗ Q8) × C2.\n\nTo answer the specific question about nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number, we must check which of the groups in the provided classification have this particular order structure. The order is of the form `2^1 * q^m`.\n\nLet's examine the orders of the nonabelian groups in the classification:\n*   **D6**: The dihedral group of order 12, which is `2^2 * 3^1`. This does not match the form `2q^m`.\n*   **D8**: The dihedral group of order 8, which is `2^3`. This is a 2-group and does not have an odd prime factor.\n*   **D10**: The dihedral group of order 20, which is `2^2 * 5^1`. This does not match the form `2q^m`.\n*   **D12**: The dihedral group of order 24, which is `2^3 * 3^1`. This does not match the form `2q^m`.\n*   **D14**: The dihedral group of order 28, which is `2^2 * 7^1`. This does not match the form `2q^m`.\n*   **D8 × C2**: This group has order `8 * 2 = 16 = 2^4`. It is a 2-group.\n*   **D22**: The dihedral group of order 44, which is `2^2 * 11^1`. This does not match the form `2q^m`.\n*   **D8 ∗ Q8**: The central product of D8 and Q8, which has order `(8*8)/2 = 32 = 2^5`. It is a 2-group.\n*   **(D8 ∗ Q8) × C2**: This group has order `32 * 2 = 64 = 2^6`. It is a 2-group.\n\nNone of the nonabelian groups in the definitive classification of filled groups of order `p^n * q^m` have an order of the form `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and a natural number `m`. The elementary abelian 2-groups are abelian.\n\nFurthermore, another result mentioned in \"On filled soluble groups\" states that the only filled groups of order `2^n * q` for an odd prime `q` and `n ∈ N` are D6, D10, D12, D14, and D22. For these groups, `m` is 1, but `n` is 2 or 3, not 1.\n\nTherefore, there are no nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and a natural number `m`.\n\n<<<There are no nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and a natural number m.>>>"
