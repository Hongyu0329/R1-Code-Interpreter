    "To determine whether 1 minus the incidence rate ratio (IRR) overestimates, underestimates, or correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine, it's essential to understand the distinction between different vaccine action models.\n\n### Vaccine Action Models\n\nThere are two primary theoretical models for how a vaccine that is not 100% effective works:\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing (AON) Vaccine:** This model assumes the vaccine provides complete and perfect protection to a certain percentage of the vaccinated population, while offering no protection to the rest. For instance, a vaccine with 90% efficacy in this model would make 90% of recipients fully immune, while the remaining 10% are just as susceptible as unvaccinated individuals. In this model, protection within the vaccinated group is heterogeneous.\n*   **Leaky (or Partial Protection) Vaccine:** This model posits that the vaccine provides a uniform, partial reduction in the risk of infection upon each exposure for every vaccinated individual. Using the same 90% efficacy example, every single vaccinated person would have their risk of infection per exposure reduced by 90%. Protection in this group is homogeneous.\n\n### Calculating Vaccine Efficacy (VE)\n\nVaccine efficacy (VE) is typically calculated from the incidence rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. The formula is:\n\n**VE = 1 - (Incidence Rate in Vaccinated / Incidence Rate in Unvaccinated)**\n\nThis is equivalent to **VE = 1 - IRR**, where IRR is the incidence rate ratio.\n\n### Analyzing the All-or-Nothing Model\n\nLet's break down the situation for an all-or-nothing vaccine:\n1.  **Per-Exposure Efficacy:** This measures the reduction in infection probability *per single exposure*. In the AON model, this is not a single value for the whole vaccinated group.\n    *   For the fraction of the vaccinated population that is fully protected, the per-exposure efficacy is **100%**.\n    *   For the fraction that is not protected, the per-exposure efficacy is **0%**.\n\n2.  **Incidence Rate and 1-IRR:**\n    *   Let's assume a fraction, `f`, of the vaccinated population is perfectly protected. The remaining `1-f` fraction has the same susceptibility as the unvaccinated group.\n    *   The incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`IRv`) will be driven entirely by infections in the non-protected `(1-f)` subgroup. Therefore, `IRv = (1-f) * IRu`, where `IRu` is the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group.\n    *   The Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) is `IRv / IRu = (1-f) * IRu / IRu = 1-f`.\n    *   Therefore, the calculated overall vaccine efficacy is `VE = 1 - IRR = 1 - (1-f) = f`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor an all-or-nothing vaccine, the standard formula `1 - IRR` calculates the proportion of the vaccinated population that is fully protected (`f`). The concept of a single \"per-exposure vaccine efficacy\" for the entire group is complicated because the effect is binary (100% or 0%).\n\nHowever, if we consider \"per-exposure efficacy\" as the measure that is estimated by `1 - IRR` in a leaky vaccine model, we can make a direct comparison. In a leaky model, `1 - IRR` correctly estimates the per-exposure efficacy for every individual. In an all-or-nothing model, `1 - IRR` estimates the *fraction of people protected*, not a uniform per-exposure risk reduction. Since the per-exposure efficacy is either 100% for the protected group or 0% for the unprotected group, `1-IRR` is essentially measuring the size of the fully protected group.\n\nThe literature treats `1-IRR` in an all-or-nothing model as the estimator of the proportion of completely protected individuals. Therefore, when comparing the value derived from `1-IRR` (which is `f`, the fraction protected) to the actual per-exposure efficacies present in the population (100% and 0%), we see that it correctly estimates the proportion of individuals who have 100% per-exposure efficacy.\n\nThus, `1 - IRR` correctly estimates the parameter of interest in an all-or-nothing model, which is the proportion of the population that is completely protected. It doesn't overestimate or underestimate this key parameter.\n\n<<<C>>>"
