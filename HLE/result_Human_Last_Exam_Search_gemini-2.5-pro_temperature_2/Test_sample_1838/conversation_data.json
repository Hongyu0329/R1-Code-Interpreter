    "To determine the central pixel of the line between (1, 1) and (11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, the first step is to generate all the pixel coordinates along the line.\n\nBresenham's algorithm is an efficient method for drawing lines on a grid, using only integer arithmetic. For a line with a slope between 0 and 1, the algorithm increments the x-coordinate at each step and decides whether to increment the y-coordinate based on a decision parameter.\n\nHere are the calculated points for the line from (1, 1) to (11, 5):\n*   (1, 1)\n*   (2, 1)\n*   (3, 2)\n*   (4, 2)\n*   (5, 3)\n*   (6, 3)\n*   (7, 4)\n*   (8, 4)\n*   (9, 5)\n*   (10, 5)\n*   (11, 5)\n\nThe algorithm generates a total of 11 pixels. To find the central pixel, we need to find the middle point in this sequence. With 11 points, the central pixel is the 6th one in the list.\n\nThe 6th pixel in the sequence is (6, 3).\n\n<<<The central pixel's coordinates are (6, 3).>>>"
