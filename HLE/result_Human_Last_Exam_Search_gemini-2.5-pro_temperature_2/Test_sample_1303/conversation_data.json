    "The chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 is the protein **PTPN2** (Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2). Several small molecules have been identified to form protein-ligand interactions with PTPN2, primarily as inhibitors. These molecules are being investigated for their potential in cancer immunotherapy.\n\nHere are some of the small molecules that interact with PTPN2:\n\n*   **HDM2010**: A series of potent small molecule inhibitors specifically targeting PTPN2/N1. One of the lead compounds from this series has shown a PTPN2 IC50 of 1.1 nM.\n*   **ABBV-CLS-484**: A dual inhibitor of PTP1B and PTPN2 that is currently in clinical trials for solid tumors.\n*   **Compound-182**: A potent and selective competitive inhibitor of both PTP1B and PTPN2.\n*   **PTP 9**: A small-molecule PTPN2 inhibitor that has been shown to sensitize melanoma to immunotherapy in vivo.\n\nThese small molecules have been developed through methods like in silico modeling, structure-based drug design, and high-throughput screening. Their interaction with PTPN2 can enhance anti-tumor immunity by amplifying cytokine signaling pathways, making them promising candidates for combination therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors.\n\n<<<The small molecules that form protein-ligand interactions with the chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 (PTPN2) include HDM2010, ABBV-CLS-484, Compound-182, and PTP 9.>>>"
