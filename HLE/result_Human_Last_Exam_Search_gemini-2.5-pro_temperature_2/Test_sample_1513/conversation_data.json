    "The island town in question is **Edinburgh of the Seven Seas**, located on the island of **Tristan da Cunha**. This is the most remote inhabited archipelago on Earth, situated in the South Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe island of Tristan da Cunha is volcanic, and its highest point is an active volcano named Queen Mary's Peak. The only settlement on the island, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, is located on a flat coastal plain at the base of this volcano. This settlement is more than 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) from the nearest inhabited land, Saint Helena.\n\nWhile the town is situated on the coast and overlooks a bay, research does not indicate that this bay is a volcanic caldera or that it shares the town's name. The harbor is known as Calshot Harbour, and the bay is sometimes referred to as Falmouth Bay. A volcanic eruption did occur in 1961 right next to the settlement, leading to the temporary evacuation of the inhabitants.\n\nTherefore, despite the likely inaccuracy in the description of the bay as a caldera named after the town, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas on Tristan da Cunha is the only inhabited island town that meets the extreme isolation criterion.\n\n<<<Edinburgh of the Seven Seas>>>"
