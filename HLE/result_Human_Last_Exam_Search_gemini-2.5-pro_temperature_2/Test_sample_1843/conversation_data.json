    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we follow a systematic approach based on the properties of Dirichlet characters.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$.\nSo, the prime factorization is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n### Step 2: Decomposition of the Character\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive characters corresponding to the prime power factors of $N$.\nLet $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$, where each $\\chi_m$ is a primitive Dirichlet character modulo $m$.\n\n### Step 3: Conditions on the Order of the Character\nThe order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters. Let $k_m$ be the order of the character $\\chi_m$. We are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6:\n$\\text{lcm}(k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13}) = 6$.\n\nThis implies two conditions:\n1.  The order of each component character, $k_m$, must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set of orders must contain at least one order divisible by 2 and at least one order divisible by 3.\n\n### Step 4: Counting Primitive Characters for Each Factor\nWe now determine the number of available primitive characters for each modulus, subject to the condition that their order divides 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$):** The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. There is one non-trivial character, which is primitive and has order 2. Since 2 divides 6, there is **1** choice for $\\chi_4$. The order $k_4$ is always 2.\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$):** The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. The primitive characters are those that are not induced from characters modulo 3. These are the characters of orders 3 and 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 2 + 2 = 4$. Both orders (3 and 6) divide 6. Thus, there are **4** choices for $\\chi_9$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7:** The character group is cyclic of order $\\phi(7) = 6$. All non-trivial characters are primitive. The possible orders are the divisors of 6 greater than 1, which are 2, 3, and 6. The number of choices is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$. All these orders divide 6, so there are **5** choices for $\\chi_7$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11:** The character group is cyclic of order $\\phi(11) = 10$. The order of a primitive character must divide 10. For the order of $\\chi$ to be 6, the order of $\\chi_{11}$ must divide 6. Thus, the order $k_{11}$ must divide $\\gcd(10, 6) = 2$. As primitive characters cannot have order 1, the only possible order is 2. The number of primitive characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$. So, there is **1** choice for $\\chi_{11}$.\n\n*   **Modulo 13:** The character group is cyclic of order $\\phi(13) = 12$. The order of $\\chi_{13}$ must divide $\\gcd(12, 6) = 6$. The possible orders for a primitive character are 2, 3, and 6. The number of choices is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$. There are **5** choices for $\\chi_{13}$.\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the LCM Condition and Final Calculation\nNow we verify that for any combination of the allowed characters, the resulting order is exactly 6. The total number of ways to choose these component characters is the product of the number of choices for each modulus:\nTotal Combinations = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nLet's check the lcm condition for every combination:\n*   The lcm of the orders must be divisible by 2. The character $\\chi_4$ always has order 2, ensuring the lcm is always even.\n*   The lcm of the orders must be divisible by 3. The primitive characters modulo 9 have orders 3 or 6. In every case, the order $k_9$ is divisible by 3, which ensures the lcm of all orders is divisible by 3.\n\nSince the lcm is always divisible by both 2 and 3, it is always divisible by 6. Furthermore, since the order of each component character divides 6, their lcm must also divide 6. Therefore, for every one of the 100 possible combinations, the order of the resulting character $\\chi$ is exactly 6.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6 is the total number of combinations.\n\nNumber of characters = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n<<<100>>>"
