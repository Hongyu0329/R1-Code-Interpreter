    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. Here's a step-by-step analysis to identify the product:\n\n1.  **Reagents**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu), which is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. The solvent is tert-butyl alcohol. This combination of a secondary alkyl halide and a strong, bulky base strongly favors an E2 elimination mechanism.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry of the Substrate**: The (1S,2R) designation means the bromo and methyl groups are *trans* to each other. For an E2 reaction to occur in a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (bromine) and a beta-hydrogen (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) must be in an *anti-periplanar* arrangement. This requires both groups to be in axial positions, one pointing up and one pointing down.\n\n3.  **Conformational Analysis**: Let's consider the chair conformations of the molecule. The reaction must proceed from the conformation where the bromine atom is in an axial position.\n\n    *   In the reactive conformation, the bromine atom at C1 is axial. To maintain the *trans* relationship, the methyl group at C2 must be in an equatorial position.\n    *   The base now needs to abstract an axial beta-hydrogen. The beta-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2**: The methyl group is equatorial, which means the hydrogen on C2 is axial. However, this axial hydrogen is on the same side as the axial bromine (syn-periplanar), not opposite. Therefore, elimination cannot occur towards C2 to form the more substituted alkene (1-methylcyclohexene, the Zaitsev product).\n    *   **At C6**: This carbon has two hydrogens. One is axial and one is equatorial. The axial hydrogen at C6 is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine at C1.\n\n4.  **Product Formation**: Since the only available anti-periplanar beta-hydrogen is on C6, the bulky base will abstract this proton. Simultaneously, a double bond will form between C1 and C6, and the bromide ion will leave.\n\nThis leads to the formation of the less substituted alkene. This product is known as the Hofmann product. The use of a bulky base like potassium tert-butoxide generally favors the formation of the Hofmann product due to steric hindrance. In this specific case, the stereochemistry of the starting material mandates this outcome.\n\nThe final product is named **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
