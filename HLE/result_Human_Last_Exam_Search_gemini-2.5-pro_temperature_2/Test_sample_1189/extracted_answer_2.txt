The number of such sets \( T \), denoted by \( f_m \), can be calculated using the following recursive function:

For a given positive integer \( n \):
-   **Base Cases:**
    -   \( f_1 = 0 \)
    -   \( f_2 = 0 \)

-   **Recurrence Relation for \( m \ge 3 \):**
    \[
    f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} - f_{m-1} - (2^n - m + 1)f_{m-2} \right)
    \]
where \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the binomial coefficient. This recurrence allows for the calculation of \( f_m \) for any \( m \ge 3 \).
