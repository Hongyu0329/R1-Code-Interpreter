It is not possible to provide a definite number of non-Clifford gates for a "universal quantum computer" as this depends on the algorithm being run. As a benchmark, the number of physical T-gates to create one logical T-gate with a 1% physical error rate can be estimated. For a distance-3 code, this is likely in the several thousands. For a distance-5 code, it would be in the range of several hundred to a few thousand.
