    "**The Battle of Agagia, which took place on February 26, 1916, is the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by the renowned military artist Lady Butler.**\n\nElizabeth Butler (1846-1933) was celebrated for her detailed and emotive portrayals of British military engagements. While her earlier works captured famous scenes from the Napoleonic and Crimean Wars, she continued to paint contemporary conflicts throughout her career.\n\nHer painting, titled *The Dorset Yeomen at Agagia, 26 February 1916*, captures a cavalry charge by the Dorset Yeomanry against Senussi forces in the Western Desert of Egypt during the First World War. The work was commissioned in late 1916 and completed the following year.\n\nOther notable late-career works depicting specific battles include a watercolour of the charge of the London Irish Rifles at the Battle of Loos in September 1915 and *The Royal Horse Guards Retreat from Mons, 1914*, which portrays events from the early stages of World War I. While Lady Butler produced other works related to the First World War, such as \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\" (1929), these are generally considered to be more generic representations of the conflict without a link to a specific, dated historical battle that is later than the Battle of Agagia.\n\nA chronological list of some of her most famous battle paintings includes:\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (Battle of Quatre Bras, 1815)\n*   ***Scotland Forever!*** (Battle of Waterloo, 1815)\n*   ***Remnants of an Army*** (Retreat to Jellalabad, 1842)\n*   ***The Roll Call*** (Battle of Inkerman, 1854)\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (Battle of Rorke's Drift, 1879)\n*   ***Floreat Etona!*** (Battle of Laing's Nek, 1881)\n*   ***The Royal Horse Guards Retreat from Mons, 1914*** (Retreat from Mons, 1914)\n*   **Watercolour of the Charge of the London Irish Rifles at Loos** (Battle of Loos, September 1915)\n*   ***The Dorset Yeomen at Agagia, 26 February 1916*** (Battle of Agagia, February 26, 1916)\n\n<<<The Battle of Agagia"
