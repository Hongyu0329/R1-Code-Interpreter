    "**No definitive Crayola crayon color has been identified as containing 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride.**\n\nThe chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is commonly known as Rhodamine B. This substance is a synthetic dye recognized for its vibrant, fluorescent pink hue.\n\nCrayola, the manufacturer of the popular crayons, states that their products are created from paraffin wax and various color pigments. The precise composition of these pigments is considered proprietary information. The company consistently emphasizes that its products are non-toxic, a commitment it has maintained since its inception.\n\nIn contrast, Rhodamine B is classified with several hazard warnings, including being harmful if ingested and having limited evidence of carcinogenic effects. While some general sources indicate that xanthene dyes, the category to which Rhodamine B belongs, can be utilized in the manufacturing of crayons, there is no direct evidence to suggest that Crayola incorporates this specific, potentially harmful dye into its products. One laboratory synthesis procedure for Rhodamine B does mention \"crayons\" as a potential application, but this does not serve as a confirmation of its use by any specific brand.\n\nGiven Crayola's long-standing policy of using non-toxic ingredients in their crayons and the known health advisories associated with Rhodamine B, it is highly improbable that this chemical is used in any of their crayon colors. Extensive searches for the ingredients of specific pink Crayola crayons, such as 'Razzle Dazzle Rose,' 'Shocking Pink,' and 'Tickle Me Pink,' have not yielded any information confirming the presence of Rhodamine B.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, there is no evidence to suggest that any Crayola crayon contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride.\n\n<<<There is no evidence to suggest any Crayola crayon color contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride.>>>"
