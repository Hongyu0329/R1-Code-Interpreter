    "## The solution to the Gauss class number problem reveals that there are 244 negative fundamental discriminants with a class number of 48.\n\nThis comprehensive result stems from the work of M. Watkins in his paper \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields,\" which provides a complete classification of all imaginary quadratic fields with class numbers up to 100. The Gauss class number problem, in this context, is the task of listing all imaginary quadratic fields for a given class number. A negative fundamental discriminant is a negative integer that serves as the discriminant of a quadratic number field.\n\nThe problem of determining the number of such fields for a specific class number has a long history, with solutions for smaller class numbers being found over many decades. Watkins's computational work in 2004 definitively solved the problem for all class numbers up to 100, a result that is widely cited in the mathematical community. While tables for smaller class numbers are more readily available, the count for class number 48 is a direct result of this extensive computation.\n\n<<<244>>>"
