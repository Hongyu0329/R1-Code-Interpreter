    "I have performed an initial search and found several documents that discuss the heat kernel expansion, Seeley-DeWitt coefficients, and the spectral action for Dirac operators. However, none of the results directly provide the explicit formula for the second coefficient (a2) for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field in a clear, consolidated form. The documents are research papers focusing on specific applications like non-commutative geometry, black hole entropy, or anomalies.\n\nTo provide a precise answer, I need to synthesize information from these sources and likely perform a more targeted search for the standard Seeley-DeWitt coefficient formulas. I will focus on finding the general expression for a2 for a spinor field coupled to a gauge field.The second round of searches provided more specific information regarding the heat kernel coefficients, particularly for fermion fields. I found a paper titled \"A NOTE ON THE HEAT KERNEL METHOD APPLIED TO FERMIONS\" that explicitly calculates the a2 coefficient for a fermionic operator with vector and axial vector fields. This is very close to what is needed. Another comprehensive resource is the \"Heat kernel expansion: user's manual\" which, although a general review, likely contains the standard formulas. The papers on the spectral action by Chamseddine and Connes confirm the relevance of these coefficients to the problem.\n\nThe next step is to carefully extract the formula for the a2 coefficient from these resources and adapt it to the specific case of a massless gauged Dirac spinor field. This involves understanding the notation for the curvature of the gauge field and its interaction with the spinor. I will now synthesize this information to construct the final answer. I believe I have sufficient information to proceed without further searches.\n\nThe second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field, denoted as `a₂`, is a crucial element in understanding the one-loop effective action and related quantum phenomena. This coefficient is part of the asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel for the square of the Dirac operator, which is a second-order elliptic differential operator.\n\nThe spectral action is given by `Tr(f(D/Λ))`, where `D` is the Dirac operator, `Λ` is a cutoff scale, and `f` is a test function. The heat kernel expansion provides a way to express this trace in terms of local geometric invariants. The expansion for the trace of the heat kernel `K(t) = exp(-tD²)` is given by:\n\n`Tr(K(t)) ~ Σₙ aₙ t⁽ⁿ⁻ᵈ⁾/²`\n\nwhere `d` is the dimension of the manifold. The coefficients `aₙ` are integrals of local densities, also denoted by `aₙ(x)`. For a massless Dirac spinor field coupled to a gauge field `A`, the Dirac operator is `D = γ^μ(∂_μ + A_μ)`, where `A_μ` includes both the spin connection and the external gauge potential.\n\nTo find the second coefficient `a₂`, one must consider the square of the Dirac operator, `D²`. In four dimensions, the diagonal of the second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient, `a₂(x,x)`, for a general second-order operator of the form `- (∇² + E)` is given by:\n\n`a₂(x,x) = (1/360) (5R² - 2R_{μν}R^{μν} + 2R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ}) I + (1/12) Y_{μν}Y^{μν} + (1/6) (∇²E) + (1/2) E²`\n\nwhere `R` is the Ricci scalar, `R_{μν}` is the Ricci tensor, `R_{μνρσ}` is the Riemann curvature tensor, `Y_{μν}` is the curvature of the connection on the vector bundle, and `E` is a term related to the non-minimal part of the operator.\n\nFor a massless gauged Dirac spinor, the square of the Dirac operator `D²` can be written as `D² = -(g^{μν}∇_μ∇_ν + (1/4)R - (1/2)σ^{μν}F_{μν})`, where `∇_μ` is the covariant derivative including the gauge connection, `R` is the scalar curvature, and `F_{μν}` is the field strength of the gauge field.\n\nAfter a detailed calculation, the second coefficient `a₂` for a massless Dirac spinor coupled to a gauge field is found to be:\n\n`a₂ = ∫ d⁴x √g Tr [ (1/12) R I + (1/60) (5R² - 2R_{μν}R^{μν} + 2R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ}) I + (1/12) F_{μν}F^{μν} ]`\n\nHere, the trace is over the spinor indices. The term `(1/12) R I` comes from the identity part of the operator `E` in the general formula. The term `(1/12) F_{μν}F^{μν}` is the contribution from the gauge field strength. The first two terms inside the integral are purely gravitational.\n\nThus, focusing on the part involving the gauge field, its contribution to the second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient `a₂` is `∫ d⁴x √g (1/12) Tr(F_{μν}F^{μν})`.\n\n<<<`a₂ = ∫ d⁴x √g [ (1/12)R + (1/360)(5R² - 2R_{μν}R^{μν} + 2R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ})I + (1/12)F_{μν}F^{μν} ]`>>>"
