    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n### 1. Definition of a Pauli Channel\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is defined by its action on a density matrix $\\rho$:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger $$\nwhere:\n*   $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ is a basis of unitary operators for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, known as the generalized Pauli operators. They are orthogonal, satisfying $\\text{Tr}(U_j^\\dagger U_k) = d \\delta_{jk}$.\n*   $\\{p_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_k \\ge 0$ for all $k$ and $\\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k = 1$.\n\nThe Kraus operators for this channel are $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$.\n\n### 2. The Complementary Channel and its Rank\nThe complementary channel, denoted by $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, describes the information that leaks from the system to the environment. The rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. A key theorem in quantum information theory states that the rank of a channel is equal to the minimum number of Kraus operators needed to describe it.\n\nFor a channel $\\Lambda$ with Kraus operators $\\{A_k\\}$, the rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is equal to the number of linearly independent Kraus operators in the set $\\{A_k\\}$.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Rank for a Pauli Channel\nLet's apply this to the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$. The Kraus operators are $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$.\n\n1.  We are interested in the number of linearly independent operators in the set $\\{A_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$.\n2.  The set of operators $\\{U_k\\}$ forms a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices and are, by definition, linearly independent.\n3.  The set of non-zero Kraus operators is given by $\\{ \\sqrt{p_k} U_k \\mid p_k > 0 \\}$. Let the set of indices for which $p_k$ is strictly positive be $S = \\{k \\mid p_k > 0\\}$.\n4.  Since the operators $\\{U_k\\}_{k \\in S}$ are a subset of a linearly independent set, they are themselves linearly independent. Multiplying them by the non-zero scalars $\\sqrt{p_k}$ does not affect their linear independence.\n5.  Therefore, the number of linearly independent Kraus operators is exactly the number of non-zero probabilities $p_k$, which is the size of the set $S$, denoted as $|S|$.\n6.  So, for a given Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ with probability distribution $\\{p_k\\}$, the rank of its complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is $|S|$.\n\nThis result can also be seen by considering the maximal rank of the output state of the complementary channel, $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho)$. The rank is maximized for a full-rank input state (e.g., $\\rho = I/d$), and this maximal rank is $|S|$.\n\n### 4. Maximizing the Rank\nThe question asks for the *maximal* rank of the complementary channel. This means we need to find the maximum possible value of $|S|$ over all possible Pauli channels.\n\nA Pauli channel is determined by the choice of the probability distribution $\\{p_k\\}$. To maximize $|S|$, we should choose a distribution where the maximum number of $p_k$ values are non-zero.\n\nIt is possible to define a Pauli channel where all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero. A simple example is the **completely depolarizing channel**, which maps any state $\\rho$ to the maximally mixed state. This channel can be represented as a Pauli channel with $p_k = 1/d^2$ for all $k = 0, 1, \\dots, d^2-1$.\n\nFor this channel:\n*   All $p_k$ are positive, so $S = \\{0, 1, \\dots, d^2-1\\}$.\n*   The number of non-zero probabilities is $|S| = d^2$.\n\nThus, the rank of the complementary channel for the completely depolarizing channel is $d^2$. Since $|S|$ can never exceed $d^2$ (as there are only $d^2$ Pauli operators), the maximum possible rank is $d^2$.\n\n<<<The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a $d$-dimensional Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$.>>>"
