    "The symmetry group of the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C_1 in Schoenflies notation. This information is based on the comprehensive data compiled by Eckard Specht on the \"packomania\" website, which lists the best-known packings of equal circles in a circle and their properties. For the packing of 1135 circles, the listed symmetry group is C_1, which signifies a lack of any rotational or reflectional symmetry.\n\n<<<C_1>>>"
