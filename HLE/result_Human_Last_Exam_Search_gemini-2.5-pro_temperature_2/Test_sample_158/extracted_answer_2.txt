**Permeability of the magnetic material:**
The required permeability of the material in the shell is equal to the negative of the permeability of free space.
μ = -μ₀, or relative permeability μᵣ = -1.

**Magnetic field in the interior region:**
The magnetic field in the interior region is uniform and given by:
**H**<sub>int</sub> = (R₂/R₁)² **H**₀
