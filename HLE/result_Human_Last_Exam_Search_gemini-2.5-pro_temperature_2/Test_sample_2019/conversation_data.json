    "There are exactly 200 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. This result is based on the comprehensive work of mathematician Václav Kotěšovec, who has compiled extensive tables on non-attacking chess piece configurations.\n\nOn a toroidal board, the rows, columns, and diagonals wrap around. This creates a more complex set of constraints compared to a standard chessboard. For a 5x5 board, there are 25 squares. The problem requires placing four queens such that no two queens share the same row, column, or any of the wrapped diagonals.\n\nThrough dedicated computational analysis, the number of valid arrangements has been determined.\n\n<<<200>>>"
