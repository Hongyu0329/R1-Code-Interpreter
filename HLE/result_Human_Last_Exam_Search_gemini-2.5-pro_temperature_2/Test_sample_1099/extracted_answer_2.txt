To simulate the correlations from POVM measurements on a singlet bipartite quantum state with a local hidden variable model, two distinct minimal resource sets exist:

1.  **With Non-Signaling Resources:** One (1) non-signaling PR-Box with an average of zero (0) bits of communication.
2.  **With Classical Communication:** An average of one (1) bit of classical communication with zero (0) non-signaling PR-Boxes.
