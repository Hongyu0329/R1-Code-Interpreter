    "The evaluation of the definite integral ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 is performed as follows.\n\nFirst, the integral of the form ∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx is known to be ln|f(x)| + C. Therefore, the definite integral is given by [ln|F₃(x)|] evaluated from 0 to 1, which equals ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|, or ln|F₃(1)/F₃(0)|.\n\nThe functions are defined as:\n*   F₀(x) = x\n*   F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n*   F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n*   F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\nNext, we evaluate F₃(x) at the limits of integration, 0 and 1.\n\nFor x = 0:\n*   F₀(0) = 0\n*   F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0\n*   F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1\n*   F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\nFor x = 1:\n*   F₀(1) = 1\n*   F₁(1) = sin(1) (where the angle is in radians)\n*   F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))\n*   F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n\nThe value of the integral, V, is ln(F₃(1)/F₃(0)). Since F₃(x) is positive for x in, the absolute value is not necessary.\nV = ln( ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2) )\n\nTo find the numerical value, we use the following approximations:\n*   sin(1) ≈ 0.84147.\n*   ln(2) ≈ 0.69315.\n\nNow we compute the intermediate values:\n*   e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.84147 ≈ 2.31977\n*   1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 3.31977\n*   F₃(1) = ln(3.31977) ≈ 1.20002\n*   F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.69315\n\nSo, V ≈ ln(1.20002 / 0.69315) ≈ ln(1.73129) ≈ 0.54885.\n\nThe final step is to calculate 10000 * V:\n10000 * 0.54885 = 5488.5\n\nThe closest integer to 5488.5 is 5489.\n\n<<<5489>>>"
