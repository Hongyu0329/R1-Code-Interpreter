    "### Reaction between Butadiene and 1,1-Dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene Yields [2+2] Cycloaddition Product\n\nThe reaction between 1,3-butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene results in the formation of **1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoro-3-vinylcyclobutane**. This product is the outcome of a [2+2] cycloaddition rather than the more common [4+2] Diels-Alder reaction typically seen with conjugated dienes like butadiene.\n\nThe formation of this vinylcyclobutane derivative is achieved by heating the two reactants. A U.S. patent describes a specific method where butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethylene are heated to 125°C in a sealed container to produce the desired compound in high yields of 86-94%. Analysis of the product through chemical and infrared spectra confirms its structure as a 1:1 adduct with a vinyl cyclobutane ring.\n\nWhile 1,3-butadiene is well-known for participating in Diels-Alder reactions, its reaction with certain fluorinated and chlorinated ethylenes can favor the [2+2] cycloaddition pathway. This alternative reaction pathway is also observed with other dienes reacting with 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethylene.\n\nThe formal name of the resulting product is 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoro-3-vinylcyclobutane. The reaction can be represented as follows:\n\n```\nCH2=CH-CH=CH2 + CCl2=CF2 → 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoro-3-vinylcyclobutane\n```\n<<<1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoro-3-vinylcyclobutane"
