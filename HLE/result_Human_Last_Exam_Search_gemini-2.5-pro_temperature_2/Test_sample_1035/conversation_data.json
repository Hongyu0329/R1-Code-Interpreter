    "The initial search results confirm that the problem of covering a complete graph Kn with bipartite graphs is a well-studied area in graph theory.\n\nSpecifically, I found the following key information:\n\n*   **Theorem:** The minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover all the edges of a complete graph Kn is `⌈log₂n⌉`. This is a fundamental result in the field.\n*   The problem can be rephrased as expressing the complete graph Kn as the union of *k* bipartite graphs. The theorem states that this is possible if and only if n ≤ 2^k.\n*   The \"capacity\" of a bipartite covering, which is the sum of the number of vertices of the bipartite graphs in the family, is also discussed. However, the user's question is about the \"minimum number of vertices in a family,\" which can be interpreted as the minimum number of bipartite graphs required, not the sum of their vertices. If it were the latter, the problem would be significantly different, related to the Katona-Szemerédi theorem. Given the phrasing and standard problems in this area, the question is most likely asking for the minimum number of bipartite graphs, which is `⌈log₂n⌉`.\n\nNow I can proceed to calculate this for n=35.\n\n*   Calculate `log₂(35)`.\n*   Take the ceiling of this value.\n*   Provide the final answer.\n\nI don't need any further search to answer the question as I have a clear theorem to apply.\n\\\nThe problem asks for the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that cover all the edges of the complete graph K_n, where n = 35. This is a classic problem in extremal graph theory.\n\nThe question is about the minimum number of bipartite subgraphs whose edges in union form the complete graph K_n. This is equivalent to finding the smallest integer *k* such that the edges of K_n can be decomposed into *k* bipartite graphs.\n\nA well-known theorem by Graham and Pollak addresses a related question about decomposing K_n into *complete* bipartite graphs, stating that n-1 such graphs are required. However, for a covering with general bipartite graphs, the number is significantly smaller.\n\nThe relevant theorem for this problem states that the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover the edges of a complete graph K_n is `⌈log₂n⌉`. This is because if you label the n vertices with distinct binary vectors of length k, you can create k bipartite graphs. For each of the k positions in the binary vectors, a bipartite graph can be formed by partitioning the vertices into those with a '0' at that position and those with a '1' at that position. For any two vertices, their binary labels must differ in at least one position, so the edge between them will be included in the corresponding bipartite graph. This construction works if and only if there are enough distinct binary vectors of length k to label all n vertices, which means n ≤ 2^k. This inequality can be rewritten as k ≥ log₂n. Since k must be an integer, the minimum k is `⌈log₂n⌉`.\n\nFor n = 35, we need to calculate `⌈log₂35⌉`.\n\n*   We know that 2^5 = 32 and 2^6 = 64.\n*   Therefore, 5 < log₂(35) < 6.\n*   The ceiling of log₂(35) is 6.\n\nSo, the minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover all the edges of K_35 is 6. The question asks for the minimum number of vertices in such a family, which in this context refers to the number of bipartite graphs in the family. Each of these bipartite graphs is a subgraph of K_35 and therefore has 35 vertices. The question does not ask for the sum of the number of vertices in each bipartite graph.\n\nThus, the minimum number of bipartite graphs is 6.\n\nFinal Answer: The minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover the edges of K_35 is given by the formula ⌈log₂n⌉. For n=35, we have ⌈log₂35⌉. Since 2^5 = 32 and 2^6 = 64, log₂35 is between 5 and 6. Therefore, ⌈log₂35⌉ = 6.\n<<<6>>>\nThe minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover all the edges of the complete graph K_n is given by the formula ⌈log₂n⌉, where n is the number of vertices in the complete graph. This is a well-established result in graph theory.\n\nIn this specific case, n = 35. To find the minimum number of bipartite graphs, we need to calculate ⌈log₂35⌉.\n\nWe can determine the value of log₂35 by observing the powers of 2:\n*   2⁵ = 32\n*   2⁶ = 64\n\nSince 35 is between 32 and 64, the value of log₂35 is between 5 and 6. The ceiling function, denoted by ⌈ ⌉, rounds the number up to the nearest integer. Therefore, the ceiling of log₂35 is 6.\n\nThis means that a minimum of 6 bipartite graphs are required to cover all the edges of the complete graph K₃₅.\n\n"
