To be functionally accurate, the azobenzene-shaped picnic table must change its shape from a flatter, more stretched-out form (trans isomer) to a bent, more compact form (cis isomer) when the sun rises. As the sun sets and darkness falls, the table must gradually return to its original flatter, stretched-out (trans) shape. This reversible transformation is driven by the presence and absence of UV light in sunlight.
