    "The Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb *seh₂gieti, meaning \"'(s)he's giving a sign'\", and its root *seh₂g- (\"to track down, seek out\") developed into a common verb in the Germanic languages. The Latin cognate *sāgīre* (\"to be keen-nosed, perceive quickly\") and related words like *sagax* (\"of quick perception\") attest to the root's meaning of keen perception.\n\nHere are the reflexes of PIE *seh₂gieti in Proto-Germanic and its daughter languages:\n\n### Proto-Germanic: ***sōkjaną***\n\nContrary to what a simple application of sound laws to *seh₂gieti* might suggest, the evidence from the descendant languages and Latin points to a Proto-Germanic (PGmc) Class 1 weak verb ***sōkjaną*. The long vowel `*ō*` in the root is analogous to the long `*ā*` in Latin *sāgīre*. This form is reconstructed from a PIE causative formation or a root variant with a long vowel. The verb meant \"to seek\" or \"to look for\". The third-person singular present indicative form would be ***sōkiþ*.\n\n### Old Norse: **sœkja**\n\nIn Old Norse, PGmc **sōkjaną* became **sœkja** (with alternative spellings like *sǿkja* and *sækja*). The sound change, known as i-umlaut, shifted the root vowel `*ō*` to `*œ*` due to the following `*j*`. The meaning evolved to include \"to seek, look for, search\" and also \"to attack\" or \"prosecute a case\". The third-person singular present indicative form was **sœkir**.\n\n### Old English: **sēcan**\n\nThe Proto-Germanic **sōkjaną* is the direct ancestor of Old English (OE) **sēcan** (also spelled *sœ̄ċan*). As in Old Norse, the `*j*` in the Proto-Germanic verb ending triggered i-umlaut, which in OE changed the `*ō*` to `*ē*`. The consonant `*k*` was palatalized to `[tʃ]` before the front vowel, written as `c`. The verb's meaning included \"to look for, seek\", \"strive for\", and \"to visit or attack\". The third-person singular form was **sēceþ** or the contracted **sēcþ**.\n\n### Old High German: **suohhen**\n\nIn Old High German (OHG), the verb appears as **suohhen** (or *suochen*). Unlike in Old Norse and Old English, the infinitive form does not show i-umlaut of the root vowel *ō*, which developed into the diphthong `uo` in OHG. However, umlaut is present in certain forms of the present tense, such as the second and third-person singular (*suochis(t)*, *suochit*), where it would be written as `üe` (*süechit*). The meaning remained \"to seek, search\".\n\nIn summary, the descendants of PIE *seh₂gieti show a consistent development in meaning toward \"seeking\" and share a common reconstructed ancestor in Proto-Germanic **sōkjaną*, whose reflexes are attested across the major early Germanic languages.\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: \\*sōkjaną\nOld Norse: sœkja\nOld English: sēcan\nOld High German: suohhen>>>"
