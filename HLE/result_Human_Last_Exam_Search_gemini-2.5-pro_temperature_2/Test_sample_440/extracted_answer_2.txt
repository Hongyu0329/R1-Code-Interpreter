The final density profile `œÅ(z)` is given by the sum of the individual mass densities `M_A * n_A(z) + M_B * n_B(z)`. The molar densities `n_A(z)` and `n_B(z)` are determined by a set of coupled transcendental equations that incorporate both the gravitational potential (`M_i * g * z`) and a mean-field interaction potential derived from the van der Waals parameters (`2*a_{ij}*n_j(z)`), all within a Boltzmann distribution framework: `n_i(z) = n_i(0) * exp[-(Potential_i(z))/(R*T)]`. A full solution requires a numerical approach to solve these equations across the height of the cylinder.
