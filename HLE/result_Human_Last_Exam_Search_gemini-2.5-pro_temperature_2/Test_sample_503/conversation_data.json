    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, when viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, is a pair of order-preserving maps, $f: [n] \\to [m]$ and $g: [m] \\to [n]$, that form a Galois connection. For the given objects $$ and $$, we have $n=23$ and $m=37$.\n\nThe maps $f: \\to$ and $g: \\to$ must be order-preserving, and they must satisfy the adjunction conditions:\n1.  $id_{} \\le g \\circ f$, which means $i \\le g(f(i))$ for all $i \\in$.\n2.  $f \\circ g \\le id_{}$, which means $f(g(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in$.\n\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by either the left adjoint map $f$ or the right adjoint map $g$. The number of such adjunctions is therefore equal to the number of possible left adjoints $f: \\to$.\n\nFor an order-preserving map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ to be a left adjoint, it must have a right adjoint. This is the case if and only if for every element $q$ in the codomain $[m]$, the set $\\{p \\in [n] \\mid f(p) \\le q\\}$ has a maximum element. Since $[n]$ is a finite chain, any non-empty subset has a maximum. The condition thus simplifies to this set being non-empty for all $q \\in [m]$.\nFor $q=0$, the set $\\{p \\in \\mid f(p) \\le 0\\}$ must be non-empty. This requires the existence of a $p$ such that $f(p)=0$. Since $f$ is order-preserving, this implies that $f(0)=0$. If $f(0)=0$, the condition holds for all $q \\in$. Thus, a map $f: \\to$ is a left adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and $f(0)=0$.\n\nWe are therefore looking for the number of order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ that satisfy the condition $f(0)=0$. Such a map is a sequence of integers $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ where:\n$0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nSince $f(0)$ is fixed, we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(23)$ of length 23, with values chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. This is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps from $$ (with elements $\\{0, ..., 22\\}$ mapping to inputs $\\{1, ..., 23\\}$) to $$.\n\nThe number of order-preserving maps from $[n']$ to $[m']$ is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{m'+n'+1}{n'+1}$.\nFor this problem, we are determining a sequence of 23 values, so we can think of it as an order-preserving map from $$ into $$. Here $n' = 22$ and $m' = 37$.\nThe number of such sequences is:\n$\\binom{37 + 22 + 1}{22+1} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can count the number of right adjoints $g: \\to$. A map $g$ is a right adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and $g(37) = 23$. This requires counting the number of non-decreasing sequences $g(0), g(1), \\dots, g(36)$ with values in $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$. This corresponds to the number of order-preserving maps from $$ to $$. Using the formula with $n' = 36$ and $m' = 23$, we get:\n$\\binom{23 + 36 + 1}{36+1} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nSince $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$, both calculations yield the same result, confirming the reasoning.\n\n<<<$\\binom{60}{23}$>>>"
