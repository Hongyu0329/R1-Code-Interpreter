    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole reacts with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), two isomers are formed. This reaction results in the formation of a dinuclear ruthenium complex where the 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole ligand bridges two ruthenium centers.\n\nThe two isomers formed are diastereomers: a meso compound and a racemic mixture (rac). These arise due to the chirality of the individual ruthenium centers, each coordinated to two bipyridine ligands and the bridging ligand. The combination of these two chiral centers within the same molecule leads to the formation of the meso and rac diastereomers.\n\nThese isomers have been successfully synthesized and separated using cation exchange chromatography, and their structures have been confirmed by X-ray crystallography.\n\n<<<2>>>"
