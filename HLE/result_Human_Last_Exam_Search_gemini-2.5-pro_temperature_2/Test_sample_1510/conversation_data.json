    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups are classified based on their symmetry operations. A key component of this classification is the point group, which describes the symmetries of the pattern that leave a single point fixed. These point groups can only be of order 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 due to the crystallographic restriction theorem.\n\nA point group of order 2 contains two symmetry operations: the identity operation and one other operation, which is either a 180-degree rotation or a reflection. The two point groups of order 2 are:\n*   **C₂:** This group contains the identity and a 180-degree rotation (a half-turn).\n*   **D₁:** This group contains the identity and a single reflection.\n\nThe four wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2 are:\n\n*   **p2:** This group's point group is **C₂**. Its symmetries consist of translations and 180-degree rotations. There are no reflections or glide reflections.\n*   **pm:** The point group for pm is **D₁**. Its symmetries include reflections across parallel lines.\n*   **pg:** The point group for pg is **D₁**. This group contains glide reflections.\n*   **cm:** This group also has the point group **D₁**. It features reflections and glide reflections.\n\nThe other 13 wallpaper groups have point groups of different orders (1, 3, 4, 6, 8, or 12). For instance, wallpaper groups like pmm, pmg, pgg, and cmm have the point group D₂, which is of order 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
