    "The scansion of the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago,\" from Lucretius' *De Rerum Natura*, is famously complex due to several poetic licenses and archaic forms typical of the author. The most widely accepted metrical pattern is Spondee-Spondee-Dactyl-Spondee-Dactyl-Spondee.\n\nThis analysis relies on the following points:\n*   **Hiatus**: The elision that would normally occur between the final `-um` of `verum` and the initial `u-` of `ubi` is suppressed. This allows `verum` to stand as a spondee (`— —`).\n*   **Irregular Vowel Quantities**: Both the `u` in `ubi` and the `e` in `equi` must be scanned as long, contrary to their usual quantity. This allows for the formation of a spondee (`ūb(i) ēquī`).\n*   **Elision**: The final long `-ī` of `ubi` elides with the initial long `ē-` of `equi`.\n*   **Lengthening by Position**: The final syllable of `hominis` (`-nis`) and `atque` (`-que`) are lengthened by the consonant that follows them across word boundaries.\n*   **Archaic Long Vowel**: The initial `i-` of `imago` is treated as long, which is a known but rare scansion.\n\nBased on these specific exceptions, the feet are scanned as follows:\n\n**S S D S D S**"
