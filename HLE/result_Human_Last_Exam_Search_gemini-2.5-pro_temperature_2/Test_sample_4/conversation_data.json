    "The Poincaré polynomial of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined as $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim\\mathfrak{g}} b_k x^k$, where $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g})$ are the Betti numbers of the Lie algebra cohomology. The Lie algebra in question is a 6-dimensional real nilpotent Lie algebra.\n\nThe non-zero commutation relations are:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\n\nThis Lie algebra is known in classifications of nilpotent Lie algebras. For instance, in the classification by Willem de Graaf, this algebra is denoted as $L_{6,14}$ (or sometimes $\\mathfrak{g}_{6,14}$). The Betti numbers for this specific Lie algebra have been computed and are documented in the literature on Lie algebra cohomology.\n\nThe Betti numbers for this Lie algebra are:\n*   $b_0 = 1$\n*   $b_1 = 3$\n*   $b_2 = 5$\n*   $b_3 = 6$\n*   $b_4 = 5$\n*   $b_5 = 3$\n*   $b_6 = 1$\n\nThe Lie algebra is nilpotent, which implies it is unimodular. For a unimodular Lie algebra of dimension $n$, Poincaré duality holds for its cohomology, which means $b_k = b_{n-k}$. In this case, $n=6$, and the Betti numbers exhibit this symmetry: $b_0=b_6=1$, $b_1=b_5=3$, and $b_2=b_4=5$.\n\nUsing these Betti numbers, the Poincaré polynomial $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x)$ is constructed as follows:\n\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + b_3 x^3 + b_4 x^4 + b_5 x^5 + b_6 x^6$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + 1x^6$\n\nTherefore, the Poincaré polynomial of the given Lie algebra is $1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\n<<<$1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$>>>"
