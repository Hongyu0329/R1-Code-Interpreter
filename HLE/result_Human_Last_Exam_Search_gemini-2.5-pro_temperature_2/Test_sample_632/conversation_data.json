    "There is no historical record of a unique architectural feature being removed from the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in 1950. It is possible that the date is mistaken, and the question may be referring to an earlier, significant alteration to the square.\n\nOne of the most notable architectural changes to the Piazza della Rotonda was the removal of the twin bell towers that flanked the Pantheon's facade. These Baroque towers, often derisively nicknamed the \"orecchie d'asino\" (the ass's ears), were added in the 17th century under Pope Urban VIII and were designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. However, these were demolished in 1883, not 1950, as part of an effort to restore the Pantheon to what was believed to be its original classical appearance.\n\nThroughout its long history, the Piazza della Rotonda has undergone numerous transformations. In the 15th century, Pope Eugenius IV ordered the clearing of the many shops and sheds that had clustered around the Pantheon. The central fountain was added in 1575, and the Egyptian obelisk was placed on top of it in 1711. In the 19th century, the piazza was known for its lively bird and food market, which was also eventually cleared. While there were various demolitions and urban redevelopment projects in Rome during the 20th century, particularly during the Fascist era, there is no widely documented removal of a \"unique architectural feature\" from the Piazza della Rotonda in the year 1950.\n\n<<<There is no documented unique architectural feature that was removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950. The most significant removal of an architectural feature was the demolition of the 17th-century twin bell towers in 1883.>>>"
