    "An arbitrarily powerful quantum computer could theoretically crack a symmetric encryption key using Grover's algorithm, which significantly reduces the time required for a brute-force attack. To remain secure against such a threat, the length of the symmetric key must be sufficiently long.\n\nGrover's algorithm provides a quadratic speed-up for searching an unstructured database, which is analogous to a brute-force key search. This means that for a key of 'n' bits, a classical computer would need up to 2ⁿ operations to guarantee finding the key, while a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm would require approximately 2ⁿᐟ² operations.\n\nConsequently, the effective security of a symmetric key is halved. For instance, a 128-bit AES key, which is a common standard today and secure against classical computers, would have its security level reduced to that of a 64-bit key against a quantum computer. A 64-bit security level is not considered safe from sophisticated attackers.\n\nTo mitigate this quantum threat, the generally accepted solution is to double the key length. By doubling the key size, the security level against a quantum attack becomes equivalent to the original key size against a classical attack. Therefore, a 256-bit symmetric key would offer a security level of approximately 128 bits against a quantum computer, as it would require roughly 2¹²⁸ operations to break. This level of security is widely considered to be strong enough to withstand attacks from even powerful quantum computers for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) already requires the use of 256-bit AES keys for data classified as TOP SECRET, in part to protect against future quantum threats.\n\nTherefore, a symmetric key needs to be at least 256 bits long to be considered secure against an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
