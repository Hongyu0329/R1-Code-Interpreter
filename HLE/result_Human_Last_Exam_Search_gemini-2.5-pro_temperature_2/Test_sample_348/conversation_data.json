    "I am unable to calculate the final numerical answer. The problem requires a numerical computation tool to solve the transcendental equation for the equilibrium quantity and to compute the definite integral for the total welfare.\n\nThe steps to solve the problem are:\n1.  Find the equilibrium quantity, Qₑ, by numerically solving the equation:\n    18e<sup>-arctan(Q)</sup> = ln(Q³ - 2)\n2.  The lower limit of integration for welfare calculation is the minimum quantity for which supply is defined, which is Qₘᵢₙ = 2<sup>(1/3)</sup>.\n3.  The total welfare is then calculated by the definite integral of the difference between the demand and supply functions, from Qₘᵢₙ to Qₑ:\n    Total Welfare = ∫<sub>2<sup>(1/3)</sup></sub><sup>Qₑ</sup> (18e<sup>-arctan(Q)</sup> - ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ\n\nWithout the ability to perform these numerical calculations, I cannot provide the final answer.\n<<<I am unable to calculate the final numerical answer.
