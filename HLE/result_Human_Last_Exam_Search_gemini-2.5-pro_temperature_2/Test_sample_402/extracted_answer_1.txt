This bioinformatics strategy provides a robust, command-line-based method for identifying and removing specific cancer gene contamination from your RNA-seq dataset. By leveraging the differentially contaminated experimental design and applying a stringent log2 fold change filter, you can generate a clean dataset that more accurately reflects the true biological differences between your experimental conditions.
