    "To solve the initial value problem, we first need to find the general solution of the differential equation and then use the initial condition to determine the particular solution.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x'(t)=(t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$\n\nThis equation is separable, meaning we can separate the variables $x$ and $t$ to opposite sides of the equation. We can rewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$\\frac{dx}{dt}=(t-1)x^2$\n\nNow, we separate the variables by moving all $x$ terms to one side and all $t$ terms to the other:\n$\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt$\n\nNext, we integrate both sides of the equation.\n$\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt$\n\nThe integration yields:\n$-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C$\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, we use the initial condition $x(0)=-8$ to find the value of C.\n$-\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C$\n$\\frac{1}{8} = C$\n\nSubstitute the value of C back into the general solution:\n$-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}$\n\nTo find the explicit solution for $x(t)$, we can solve for $x$:\n$x(t) = \\frac{-1}{\\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}}$\n\nTo simplify the expression, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by 8:\n$x(t) = \\frac{-8}{4t^2 - 8t + 1}$\n\nFinally, we need to find the value of $x(1)$:\n$x(1) = \\frac{-8}{4(1)^2 - 8(1) + 1}$\n$x(1) = \\frac{-8}{4 - 8 + 1}$\n$x(1) = \\frac{-8}{-3}$\n$x(1) = \\frac{8}{3}$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
