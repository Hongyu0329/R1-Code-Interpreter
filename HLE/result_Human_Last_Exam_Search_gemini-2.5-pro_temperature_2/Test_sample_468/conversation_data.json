    "The currently used common name for the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" in their native range is **fairy bees**. These bees are found in North America, with a high diversity in the desert regions of the United States and Mexico.\n\nPinpointing the exact year the name \"fairy bees\" was coined is challenging, as the term does not have a formal, documented origin in the same way as its scientific name, which was established by Frederick Smith in 1853. While some anecdotal evidence suggests the name may have been popularized more recently through social media, it appears in various scientific and nature publications. For instance, some species within the genus carry \"fairy bee\" in their common names, such as the \"Sandbar Willow Fairy Bee\" (*Perdita maculigera*). The common name is widely used in 2024.\n\n<<<fairy bees, Undocumented>>>"
