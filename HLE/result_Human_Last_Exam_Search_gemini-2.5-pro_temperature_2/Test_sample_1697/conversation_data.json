    "The reaction described is a classic example of directed *ortho*-metalation (DoM) followed by electrophilic quenching.\n\n**Step 1: Directed *ortho*-Metalation**\n\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This molecule has two directing metalation groups (DMGs) on the benzene ring: the N,N-diethylamide group (-CON(C₂H₅)₂) at position C1 and the dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) at position C3. Both of these are Lewis basic groups that can coordinate to the lithium ion of sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi). The purpose of adding tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) is to chelate the lithium ion, which breaks up the aggregates of the organolithium reagent and increases its basicity, thus facilitating the deprotonation.\n\nIn aromatic compounds with multiple DMGs, there is a well-established hierarchy that determines the position of deprotonation. The tertiary amide group (-CONR₂) is a significantly more powerful directing group than the tertiary amine group (-NR₂). Therefore, the lithiation will occur at a position *ortho* to the amide group.\n\nThe positions *ortho* to the N,N-diethylamide group are C2 and C6. The C2 position is also *ortho* to the dimethylamino group at C3. This means the proton at C2 is activated by both directing groups, making it the most acidic and sterically accessible position for deprotonation by the bulky sec-BuLi/TMEDA complex. The sec-BuLi will therefore selectively remove the proton from the C2 position, forming a nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Quenching**\n\nThe aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step then reacts with an electrophile. In this case, the electrophile is methyl iodide (CH₃I). The negatively charged C2 carbon of the aryllithium attacks the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide in a nucleophilic substitution reaction, displacing the iodide ion.\n\nThis results in the formation of a C-C bond, attaching a methyl group to the C2 position of the benzene ring.\n\nThe final product of the reaction sequence is therefore **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
