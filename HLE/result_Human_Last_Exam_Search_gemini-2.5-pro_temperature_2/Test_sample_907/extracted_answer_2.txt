The absorption cross-section equations for a chain of molecules under an ultrashort Gaussian laser pulse, within first-order time-dependent perturbation theory for transitions below the Fermi level, are as follows:

**a) Neglecting intermolecular interaction:**

The total absorption cross-section is the incoherent sum of absorptions by N independent molecules. Each molecule can undergo various transitions from an occupied orbital |φⱼ⟩ to an unoccupied orbital |φₖ⟩.

σ<sub>total</sub>(ω) = N ⋅ ∑<sub>j,k</sub> (πω / (3ε₀cnħ)) |**μ**<sub>jk</sub>|² ⋅ (τ / (ħ√(2π))) * exp[- (ħω - (Eₖ - Eⱼ - E<sub>bind</sub>))²τ² / (2ħ²)]

Here, the key dependencies are:
*   The sum over all possible electronic transitions (j → k) from below the Fermi level.
*   The square of the transition dipole moment |**μ**<sub>jk</sub>|² for each transition.
*   A Gaussian line shape for each transition, with a width inversely proportional to the pulse duration τ, centered at the transition energy ΔE = Eₖ - Eⱼ - E<sub>bind</sub>.

**b) Considering near-neighbor interaction:**

The interaction delocalizes the excitation into collective Frenkel exciton states. For a linear chain, a strong selection rule allows absorption primarily to the K=0 exciton state. The absorption cross-section is then a single, dominant feature.

σ<sub>total</sub>(ω) ≈ N ⋅ (πω / (3ε₀cnħ)) |**μ**<sub>jk</sub>|² ⋅ (τ / (ħ√(2π))) * exp[- (ħω - (E<sub>ex</sub> + 2J))²τ² / (2ħ²)]

The main differences from the non-interacting case are:
*   **Coherent Sum:** The absorption strength is proportional to N|**μ**<sub>jk</sub>|², which is N times the strength of an individual molecule (superradiance).
*   **Energy Shift:** The transition energy is shifted from the monomer energy E<sub>ex</sub> by an amount determined by the near-neighbor coupling, J (specifically, by 2J for a linear chain).
*   **Spectral Narrowing:** The absorption spectrum collapses from multiple molecular transition peaks into a single, strong peak corresponding to the bright K=0 exciton state (assuming one dominant molecular transition).
