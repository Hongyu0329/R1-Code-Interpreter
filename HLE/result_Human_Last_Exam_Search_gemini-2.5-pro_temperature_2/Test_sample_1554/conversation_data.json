    "I have found that Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, a prominent philosopher of the Lviv-Warsaw School, is the one who decomposes the notion of a sign into symptoms and signals. In his work from 1931, he discussed the concept of a sign and made a distinction between \"indications,\" which he equated with \"symptoms,\" and \"signals.\"\n\nAccording to Jerzy Pelc's summary of Ajdukiewicz's work, when one says \"The barometer is falling, which means it is going to rain,\" the falling barometer is a symptom (indication) of the coming rain. Ajdukiewicz also identified signals as artificially created phenomena that, through convention, lead to a conclusion about another phenomenon.\n\nThis distinction was also used by other members of the Lviv-Warsaw School, such as Izydora DÄ…bska, who analyzed the semiotic functions of silence and differentiated between symptoms and signals in that context. However, the initial decomposition of the broader concept of a sign into these categories is attributed to Ajdukiewicz. His analysis is part of the school's broader focus on semiotics and the philosophy of language.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
