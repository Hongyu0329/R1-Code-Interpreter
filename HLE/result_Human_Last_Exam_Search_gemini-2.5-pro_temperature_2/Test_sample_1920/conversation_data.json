    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we must first analyze the structure of the conductor $d$.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $d=53599$.\nThe prime factorization of 53599 is $7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. Let $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ where $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1\\chi_2\\chi_3\\chi_4$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo the prime factor $p_i$. Since the moduli $p_i$ are prime, any non-trivial character modulo $p_i$ is primitive.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its constituent characters:\n$\\text{order}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{order}(\\chi_1), \\text{order}(\\chi_2), \\text{order}(\\chi_3), \\text{order}(\\chi_4))$.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\n\nThe order of any character $\\chi_i$ modulo a prime $p_i$ must divide the order of the group of units $(\\mathbb{Z}/p_i\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is $\\phi(p_i) = p_i - 1$. Let's calculate these values:\n*   order($\\chi_1$) must divide $\\phi(7) = 6$\n*   order($\\chi_2$) must divide $\\phi(13) = 12$\n*   order($\\chi_3$) must divide $\\phi(19) = 18$\n*   order($\\chi_4$) must divide $\\phi(31) = 30$\n\nFor the lcm of the orders to be 6, the orders of the constituent characters must be divisors of 6. Let $o_i = \\text{order}(\\chi_i)$. We require $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$. This implies that:\n1.  All orders $o_i$ must be divisors of 6.\n2.  At least one order $o_i$ must be divisible by 3 (i.e., order 3 or 6).\n3.  At least one order $o_j$ must be divisible by 2 (i.e., order 2 or 6).\n\nThe number of characters modulo a prime $p$ of a specific order $k$ (where $k$ divides $p-1$) is given by $\\phi(k)$, the Euler totient function.\nLet $N_k(p)$ be the number of primitive characters modulo $p$ of order $k$. For a prime $p$, if $k>1$ and $k | (p-1)$, then $N_k(p) = \\phi(k)$. If $k=1$, $N_1(p)=1$ (the trivial character). However, for $\\chi$ to be primitive with conductor $d$, each $\\chi_i$ must be a non-trivial character, thus $o_i > 1$.\n\nLet's calculate the number of available characters of the required orders for each prime factor:\n\n*   **For $p_1=7$ ($p_1-1=6$):**\n    *   $N_2(7) = \\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   $N_3(7) = \\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   $N_6(7) = \\phi(6) = 2$\n\n*   **For $p_2=13$ ($p_2-1=12$):**\n    *   $N_2(13) = \\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   $N_3(13) = \\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   $N_6(13) = \\phi(6) = 2$\n\n*   **For $p_3=19$ ($p_3-1=18$):**\n    *   $N_2(19) = \\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   $N_3(19) = \\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   $N_6(19) = \\phi(6) = 2$\n\n*   **For $p_4=31$ ($p_4-1=30$):**\n    *   $N_2(31) = \\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   $N_3(31) = \\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   $N_6(31) = \\phi(6) = 2$\n\nLet $C_i$ be the set of possible orders for the character $\\chi_i$, excluding order 1. So, $C_i = \\{o_i \\in \\{2,3,6\\} \\text{ s.t. } o_i | p_i-1\\}$. Since 2, 3, and 6 divide all the $\\phi(p_i)$ values, we have an equal number of choices for each component. Let $n(o)$ be the number of characters for a given order $o$.\n$n(2) = 1$\n$n(3) = 2$\n$n(6) = 2$\n\nWe need to count the number of 4-tuples $(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)$ where $o_i \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$, such that their lcm is 6. This is equivalent to finding all combinations and subtracting those whose lcm is not 6.\nThe total number of ways to choose one character of order 2, 3, or 6 for each of the four primes is $(1+2+2)^4 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nNow, we subtract the cases where the lcm is not 6.\n*   **Case 1: lcm is 2.** This happens if all $o_i \\in \\{1,2\\}$, but since characters must be non-trivial, all $o_i$ must be 2. There is only one character of order 2 for each prime, so there is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$ such combination.\n*   **Case 2: lcm is 3.** This happens if all $o_i \\in \\{1,3\\}$, so all $o_i$ must be 3. There are two characters of order 3 for each prime, so there are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$ such combinations.\n\nThe total number of primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of combinations minus those where the lcm is not 6.\nNumber = (Total combinations) - (combinations with lcm 2) - (combinations with lcm 3)\nNumber = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
