    "Answering the question about an upper bound for the \"maximum norm\" $(k_{k,\\infty})$ in relation to the covolume $(V)$ for squarefree natural numbers $(N)$ is challenging because the notation $k_{k,\\infty}$ is not standard in the mathematical literature concerning Bianchi groups or Kleinian groups. However, it is possible to interpret the query in the context of the well-established properties of these groups.\n\nThe setting is that of Bianchi groups, which are groups of the form $\\Gamma_N = \\text{PSL}(2, \\mathcal{O}_N)$, where $N$ is a squarefree positive integer and $\\mathcal{O}_N$ is the ring of integers of the imaginary quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-N})$. These groups act on the 3-dimensional hyperbolic space $\\mathbb{H}^3$. The quotient space $M_N = \\mathbb{H}^3 / \\Gamma_N$ is a hyperbolic 3-orbifold, and its volume is the covolume $V$.\n\nA key feature of these orbifolds is the presence of \"cusps,\" which are regions extending to infinity in the geometric model. The number of cusps of the orbifold $M_N$ is finite and is precisely the class number $h_K$ of the field $K$.\n\nGiven the notation, a plausible interpretation is that \"$k_{k,\\infty}$\" represents an invariant related to the set of cusps of the manifold. While there's no standard \"maximum norm\" of a cusp, one of the most important invariants of the cusp set is its size, i.e., the number of cusps. If we interpret the query as seeking a bound for the number of cusps in terms of the covolume, a relationship can be established.\n\n### Relationship between Number of Cusps and Covolume\n\nBoth the number of cusps, $h_K$, and the covolume, $V$, depend on the squarefree integer $N$. Their respective formulas and asymptotic behaviors are:\n\n*   **Covolume ($V$)**: The covolume of the Bianchi group $\\Gamma_N$ is given by Humbert's formula:\n    $V = \\frac{|D_K|^{3/2} \\zeta_K(2)}{4\\pi^2}$, where $D_K$ is the discriminant of the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-N})$ and $\\zeta_K$ is its Dedekind zeta function. For large $|D_K|$, the covolume has the asymptotic behavior $V \\asymp |D_K|^{3/2}$.\n\n*   **Number of Cusps ($h_K$)**: The number of cusps is the class number $h_K = h(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-N}))$. According to the Brauer-Siegel theorem, the class number has the asymptotic behavior $\\log(h_K) \\sim \\log(|D_K|^{1/2})$, which implies that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, we have $|D_K|^{1/2-\\epsilon} \\ll h_K \\ll |D_K|^{1/2+\\epsilon}$.\n\nFrom these asymptotic relationships, we can derive a bound for the number of cusps in terms of the covolume. Since $h_K$ grows roughly as $|D_K|^{1/2}$ and $V$ grows roughly as $|D_K|^{3/2}$, we can write:\n\n$h_K \\asymp (|D_K|^{3/2})^{1/3} = V^{1/3}$\n\nMore formally, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a constant $C_\\epsilon$ such that for all sufficiently large squarefree $N$:\n\n$h_K \\le C_\\epsilon V^{1/3 + \\epsilon}$\n\nThis indicates that the number of cusps is sublinearly bounded by the covolume. For instance, the ratio of the logarithm of the class number to the logarithm of the covolume tends to a constant:\n\n$\\lim_{|D_K| \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\log(h_K)}{\\log(V)} = \\frac{1/2}{3/2} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nIf the notation $k_{k,\\infty}$ was intended to refer to another geometric property of the cusps, such as the maximum \"height\" or \"volume\" of a cusp, obtaining a direct, simple upper bound from the total covolume is not a straightforward result commonly cited in the literature. However, it is known that the geometry of individual cusps is related to the arithmetic of the field $K$, just as the covolume and the class number are.\n\nWithout a precise definition or source for the term $k_{k,\\infty}$, the relationship between the number of cusps and the covolume stands as the most concrete and well-established upper bound for a key characteristic of the cusp set of a Bianchi orbifold.\n\n<<<The number of cusps, $h_K$, is bounded above by a function that is roughly of the order of the covolume to the power of one-third, more formally stated as $h_K \\le C_\\epsilon V^{1/3 + \\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$ and a constant $C_\\epsilon$.>>>"
