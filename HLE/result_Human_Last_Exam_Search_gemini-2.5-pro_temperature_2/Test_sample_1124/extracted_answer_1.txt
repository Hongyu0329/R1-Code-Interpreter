I am unable to provide a modification to the standard logistic map that satisfies the given conditions. The constraints of using only X and R without adding new parameters, while achieving a specific equilibrium point of approximately 1.05 at R=3.57, do not appear to lead to a simple algebraic solution. My attempts to add or alter terms in the equation did not yield the desired result.
