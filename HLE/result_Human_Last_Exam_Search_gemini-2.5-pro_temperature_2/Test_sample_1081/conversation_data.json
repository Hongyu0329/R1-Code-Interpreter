    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is determined by the classification of such tori. The $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational conjugacy classes of maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$, where $F$ is the Frobenius endomorphism.\n\nFor the specific case of a group of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that all reductive groups of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ are of the split form. In the split case, the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the Weyl group. Consequently, the $F$-conjugacy classes are identical to the standard conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe problem is thus reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$. This number has been computed and is a known result in the theory of reflection groups. The number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
