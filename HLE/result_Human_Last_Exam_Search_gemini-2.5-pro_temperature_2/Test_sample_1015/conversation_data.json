    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière (backward bend) in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hip. While the Vaganova method emphasizes maintaining a square and symmetrical torso, the Balanchine technique often allows for a more open hip.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, the focus is on a strong, square torso and back, with the hips remaining aligned. This method prioritizes precise control and coordination of the entire body, with expressive and codified arm (port de bras) and head placements.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine style is recognized for its speed, athleticism, and a more modern, stretched aesthetic. A notable feature of the Balanchine method is the use of an open hip, particularly in arabesques, to create the illusion of a longer, more dynamic line. This technique often encourages a more daring and expansive range of movement. This principle of a more open hip alignment is a significant departure from the strict squaring of the torso central to the Vaganova technique. While both methods involve a backbend, the foundational approach to hip placement distinguishes their execution of the cambré derrière. The Balanchine method's \"swaying hips\" and modernized lines contrast with the Vaganova method's emphasis on a stable and aligned core.\n\nOther differences between the two methods exist, such as variations in arm placement, with Balanchine sometimes employing more unconventional and \"broken wrist\" positions, and an emphasis on speed. However, the fundamental approach to the torso and hip alignment is a more defining and consistently cited difference in their overall technique.\n\n<<<B>>>"
