    "In the semidihedral group of size 512, there are 9 power subgroups.\n\nHere is a step-by-step determination of the power subgroups of the semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as G.\n\n1.  **Definition of the Semidihedral Group SD_512:** The semidihedral group G of size 512 (also denoted as SD_512 or QD_512) has the presentation:\n    *   G = ⟨r, s | r²⁵⁶ = s² = 1, srs = r¹²⁷⟩.\n    The order of the group is 512, which is 2⁹.\n\n2.  **Definition of a Power Subgroup:** For a group G and a positive integer k, the k-th power subgroup, denoted as Gᵏ, is the subgroup generated by the set of all k-th powers of elements in G. That is, Gᵏ = ⟨gᵏ | g ∈ G⟩.\n\n3.  **Powers of Elements in SD_512:** The elements of G are of the form rⁱ or rⁱs, where 0 ≤ i < 256. To find the power subgroups, we analyze the k-th powers of these elements.\n\n    *   **Odd Powers:** Since the order of G is a power of 2, every element in G has an order that is a power of 2. If k is an odd integer, the mapping g ↦ gᵏ is a bijection on G. This means that the set of k-th powers is the group G itself. Consequently, for any odd k, the power subgroup Gᵏ is the entire group G.\n\n    *   **Even Powers:** Any even integer k can be written as k = 2ᵐl, where l is odd and m ≥ 1. The power subgroup Gᵏ will be the same as G²ᵐ because taking the l-th power of the elements in G²ᵐ does not generate any new elements. Therefore, we only need to identify the distinct subgroups of the form G²ᵐ.\n\n4.  **Calculation of G²ᵐ:**\n    *   The 2ᵐ-th power of an element of the form rⁱ is (rⁱ)²ᵐ = rⁱ²ᵐ. These elements generate the cyclic subgroup ⟨r²ᵐ⟩.\n    *   For an element of the form rⁱs, we first compute its square: (rⁱs)² = rⁱs rⁱs = rⁱ(srⁱs). From the relation srs = r¹²⁷, we can derive srⁱs = (srs)ⁱ = (r¹²⁷)ⁱ = r¹²⁷ⁱ. Thus, (rⁱs)² = rⁱ r¹²⁷ⁱ = r¹²⁸ⁱ.\n    *   The 2ᵐ-th power of rⁱs is ((rⁱs)²)²ᵐ⁻¹ = (r¹²⁸ⁱ)²ᵐ⁻¹ = r¹²⁸ⁱ²ᵐ⁻¹ = rⁱ²⁷⁺ᵐ⁻¹ = rⁱ²ᵐ⁺⁶.\n    *   The subgroup G²ᵐ is generated by all elements of the form rⁱ²ᵐ and rⁱ²ᵐ⁺⁶. This is the subgroup ⟨r²ᵐ, r²ᵐ⁺⁶⟩. Since m ≥ 1, m+6 > m, which means ⟨r²ᵐ⁺⁶⟩ is a subgroup of ⟨r²ᵐ⟩.\n    *   Therefore, for m ≥ 1, G²ᵐ = ⟨r²ᵐ⟩.\n\n5.  **The Distinct Power Subgroups:**\n    *   For any odd k: Gᵏ = G = SD_512.\n    *   For k = 2 (m=1): G² = ⟨r²⟩, a cyclic subgroup of order 128.\n    *   For k = 4 (m=2): G⁴ = ⟨r⁴⟩, a cyclic subgroup of order 64.\n    *   For k = 8 (m=3): G⁸ = ⟨r⁸⟩, a cyclic subgroup of order 32.\n    *   For k = 16 (m=4): G¹⁶ = ⟨r¹⁶⟩, a cyclic subgroup of order 16.\n    *   For k = 32 (m=5): G³² = ⟨r³²⟩, a cyclic subgroup of order 8.\n    *   For k = 64 (m=6): G⁶⁴ = ⟨r⁶⁴⟩, a cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n    *   For k = 128 (m=7): G¹²⁸ = ⟨r¹²⁸⟩, a cyclic subgroup of order 2.\n    *   For k = 256 (m=8): G²⁵⁶ = ⟨r²⁵⁶⟩ = ⟨e⟩, the trivial subgroup.\n    *   For any k = 2ᵐ with m > 8, the resulting power subgroup will also be the trivial subgroup.\n\n6.  **Counting the Subgroups:**\n    The distinct power subgroups are:\n    1.  G (the entire group, non-cyclic)\n    2.  ⟨r²⟩ (cyclic of order 128)\n    3.  ⟨r⁴⟩ (cyclic of order 64)\n    4.  ⟨r⁸⟩ (cyclic of order 32)\n    5.  ⟨r¹⁶⟩ (cyclic of order 16)\n    6.  ⟨r³²⟩ (cyclic of order 8)\n    7.  ⟨r⁶⁴⟩ (cyclic of order 4)\n    8.  ⟨r¹²⁸⟩ (cyclic of order 2)\n    9.  {e} (the trivial subgroup, cyclic of order 1)\n\nThese nine subgroups are all distinct based on their order and structure (G is non-cyclic while the others are cyclic).\n\n<<<9>>>"
