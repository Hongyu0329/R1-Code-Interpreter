    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA complete classification of non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua—which are compact, connected metric spaces in the plane with more than one point—was achieved in 2014. This classification shows that every such continuum is homeomorphic to one of three distinct types:\n*   The **circle**\n*   The **pseudo-arc**\n*   The **circle of pseudo-arcs**\n\nThese three are the only non-degenerate examples. The pseudo-arc was identified as a homogeneous continuum in 1948, and the circle of pseudo-arcs in 1959. The 2014 result by Hoehn and Oversteegen confirmed that no other non-degenerate examples exist.\n\nIn addition to these three non-degenerate continua, a single **point** is also a homogeneous planar continuum. Although often considered a trivial case, it technically fits the definition. A 1983 publication already listed four known homogeneous plane continua: the point, the pseudo-arc, the circle, and the circle of pseudo-arcs. The completion of the classification for non-degenerate continua confirms this list is exhaustive.\n\nThus, there are a total of four distinct homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
