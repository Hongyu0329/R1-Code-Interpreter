    "The number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers is zero.\n\nThe process to determine this involves finding a suitable model of the curve, known as the stable model, and examining its geometric properties when reduced modulo 2.\n\nThe original equation for the curve is:\n$C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$\n\nWhen this equation is considered modulo 2, it simplifies to $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$, which represents a singular curve (specifically, a \"fat\" line where all points are singular). To find the stable reduction, a series of transformations (equivalent to blow-ups) are performed to resolve these singularities.\n\nBy repeatedly applying the substitution $(x, y) \\to (2x, 2y)$ and simplifying, we arrive at a new model for the curve after three such steps:\n$C_3: y^2 = x + x^2 + 32x^3 + 256x^4 + 4096x^5$\n\nThis model is related to the original by the transformation $(x, y) \\to (8x_3, 8y_3)$. When we reduce the equation for $C_3$ modulo 2, we get:\n$y^2 \\equiv x + x^2 \\pmod{2}$\n\nThis represents a conic section, which is a smooth curve of genus 0. A smooth curve, by definition, has no singular points. Therefore, it has no double points. This smooth model is the stable reduction of the original curve. When a curve's reduction results in a smooth curve (even one of a different genus), it is said to have \"potentially good reduction,\" and its stable model is this smooth curve itself.\n\nSince the stable reduction is a smooth curve with no singularities, the number of double points is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
