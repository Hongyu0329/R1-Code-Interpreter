    "To solve the equation `xl/xxxi-xxviii`, we first need to convert the Roman numerals into modern numbers.\n\n*   **xl** = 40\n*   **xxxi** = 31\n*   **xxviii** = 28\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation using these numbers:\n\n`40 / 31 - 28`\n\nFollowing the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we perform the division first and then the subtraction.\n\n1.  **Division**: 40 ÷ 31 ≈ 1.29032\n2.  **Subtraction**: 1.29032 - 28 = -26.70968\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is approximately -26.71.\n\n<<<-26.70967741935484>>>"
