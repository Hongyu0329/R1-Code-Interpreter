The estimated maximum magnitude of fluctuations for the uniform distribution case is `R(ε) ≈ 0.072 * ε^{1/2}`, which scales as `ε^{1/2}`.

For the case where `z_i ~ Normal(i, 0.5)`, the scaling for `R(ε)` is expected to change. The fluctuations are reduced due to the increased regularity of the source locations. The new scaling is `R(ε) ∝ ε^{3/2}`.
