    "The minimal grid number for a trefoil knot is 5. This is derived from a theorem stating that for alternating knots, the minimal grid number (or arc index) is the crossing number plus two. The trefoil knot is an alternating knot with a crossing number of three.\n\nThe grid number is the same for a knot and its mirror image; therefore, the left-handed and right-handed trefoil knots both have a minimal grid number of 5.\n\nAccording to a computational analysis of grid diagrams, there are a total of 10 distinct grid diagrams with the minimal grid number of 5 that represent a trefoil knot. As the trefoil knot is chiral, these 10 diagrams are composed of representatives for both the left-handed and right-handed versions. Due to the symmetry between a knot and its mirror image, these 10 diagrams are split equally between the two forms.\n\nTherefore, the left-hand trefoil knot has 5 minimal grid diagrams, up to translation and rotation.\n\n<<<E>>>"
