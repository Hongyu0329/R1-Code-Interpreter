    "The evaluation of the integral $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j \\rangle$ for a $1s$ Slater-type orbital (STO) is a standard calculation in quantum chemistry. The interpretation of this expression is typically the expectation value of the potential energy operator $1/r$ for a given state, which implies that the initial and final state wavefunctions are the same, i.e., $\\phi_i = \\phi_j = \\phi_{1s}$.\n\nA normalized $1s$ Slater-type orbital is described by the following wavefunction in spherical coordinates:\n$$\n\\phi_{1s}(r) = \\left( \\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi} \\right)^{1/2} e^{-\\zeta r}\n$$\nHere, $r$ is the distance from the nucleus, and $\\zeta$ (zeta) is the orbital exponent, a constant related to the effective nuclear charge.\n\nThe integral to be evaluated is the expectation value of the $1/r$ operator:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\phi_{1s} \\left| \\frac{1}{r} \\right| \\phi_{1s} \\right\\rangle = \\int \\phi_{1s}^{*}(r) \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\right) \\phi_{1s}(r) d\\tau\n$$\nwhere $d\\tau$ is the volume element. Since the wavefunction is real, the complex conjugate $\\phi_{1s}^{*}$ is equal to $\\phi_{1s}$.\n\nIn spherical coordinates, the volume element is $d\\tau = r^2 \\sin\\theta dr d\\theta d\\phi$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi} \\right) \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta d\\theta \\int_0^\\infty e^{-2\\zeta r} \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\right) r^2 dr\n$$\nThe evaluation of this integral can be separated into angular and radial parts.\n\nThe angular part integrates to $4\\pi$:\n*   $\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi = 2\\pi$\n*   $\\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta d\\theta = 2$\n\nThe radial part is:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty r e^{-2\\zeta r} dr\n$$\nThis is a standard form of integral that can be solved using integration by parts or by recognizing it as a Gamma function. The general formula is $\\int_0^\\infty x^n e^{-ax} dx = \\frac{n!}{a^{n+1}}$. For this specific integral, $n=1$ and $a=2\\zeta$. Therefore, the value of the radial integral is:\n$$\n\\frac{1!}{(2\\zeta)^{1+1}} = \\frac{1}{4\\zeta^2}\n$$\nFinally, by combining the constant factor and the results from the angular and radial integrations, we get:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\frac{1}{r} \\right\\rangle = \\left( \\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi} \\right) \\times (4\\pi) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{4\\zeta^2} \\right) = \\zeta\n$$\nThe expectation value of the operator $1/r$ for an electron in a $1s$ Slater orbital is equal to the orbital exponent $\\zeta$.\n\nIf $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$ were different $1s$ orbitals (for instance, with different exponents $\\zeta_i$ and $\\zeta_j$), the result would be $\\frac{4 (\\zeta_i \\zeta_j)^{3/2}}{(\\zeta_i + \\zeta_j)^2}$. However, the standard interpretation of the question implies that $i=j$.\n\n<<<$ \\zeta $>>>"
