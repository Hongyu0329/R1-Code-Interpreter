    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, there is no character who visits a Roman city and describes their religious practices in a way that alludes to Romulus and Remus.\n\nWithin the novel, a character who has experienced Roman life is mentioned in Chapter VI, \"They Talk on the Way to the Folk-thing.\" This character is a man from the House of the Gael, who was captured by the Romans and lived as a thrall (a slave or serf) in one of their settlements. His story is recounted by Hiarandi of the Elking tribe.\n\nHowever, the man of the Gael's account, as related by Hiarandi, focuses on the harshness of Roman society, the ill-treatment of thralls, and the Romans' social structure where individual might and wealth have replaced kindred bonds. There is no description of Roman gods, religious ceremonies, or founding myths, and specifically no mention of the story of Romulus and Remus or a she-wolf.\n\nTherefore, the premise of the question is not supported by the text of *The House of the Wolfings*.\n\n<<<There is no such character in the book.>>>"
