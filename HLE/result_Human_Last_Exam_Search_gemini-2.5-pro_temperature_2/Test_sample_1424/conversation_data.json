    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, often denoted as G₀, describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ε_k, is most clearly seen in its representation in frequency-momentum space.\n\nFor a system of non-interacting fermions, the bare Green's function in frequency (ω) and momentum (k) space is given by:\n\n**G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ε_k + iδ)**\n\nwhere:\n*   **ε_k** represents the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with momentum k.\n*   **ω** is the frequency variable.\n*   **δ** is an infinitesimally small positive number that ensures proper causality and convergence of the corresponding time-ordered expression. The sign of the imaginary part can depend on whether the state k is occupied or unoccupied.\n\nSimilarly, for a general non-interacting system where the single-particle eigenstates are labeled by an index 'i', the bare Green's function in the frequency domain is a diagonal matrix. Its components are:\n\n**G₀,ij(ω) = δij / (ω - εi)**\n\nHere, εi represents the energy eigenvalue of the i-th single-particle state, and δij is the Kronecker delta, which is 1 if i=j and 0 otherwise. This diagonal nature signifies that in the absence of interactions, a particle in a specific energy eigenstate will remain in that state as it propagates.\n\nThe key takeaway is that the bare Green's function has an **inverse relationship** with the single-particle energy eigenvalues. The poles of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane occur precisely at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. This means that the response of the system, as described by G₀, becomes very large when the energy of a probe is close to the allowed energy levels of the non-interacting particles.\n\n<<<The bare Green's function G₀ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (ω) and the single-particle energy eigenvalues (ϵ_k). In frequency-momentum space, this dependence is typically expressed as G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ), where δ is an infinitesimal constant."
