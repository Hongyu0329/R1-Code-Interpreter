    "The initial search results provide a good overview of the concept of \"natural law\" in Christian theology, its origins, and its relationship to divine law and morality. Theologians like Thomas Aquinas are mentioned as key figures in synthesizing Christian theology with the philosophy of natural law.\n\nThe results also touch upon the virgin birth as a miracle that contravenes the laws of nature. Some sources mention Augustine of Hippo in this context, stating that he saw the virgin birth as a change in the \"laws of nature.\" I also see connections being made between the virgin birth and the doctrine of original sin, and how the virgin birth was necessary to preserve Jesus from the \"taint of sin.\"\n\nHowever, the initial results don't clearly identify a single theologian who developed a *specialized terminology* to describe changes in the laws of nature that would apply to *both* the virgin birth and alterations at the Fall. While Augustine is mentioned in relation to the virgin birth and changing natural laws, and the fall is mentioned in the context of corrupting human reason, there is no specific terminology linked to him that covers both phenomena.\n\nMy next step will be to focus more specifically on theological discussions of how the Fall might have altered the laws of nature and see if any specific terminology arises that is also used to describe the virgin birth. I will also do a more targeted search on Augustine's view of natural law in relation to both these events.My research so far has established that the concept of \"natural law\" is central to Christian theology. Theologians like Augustine and Thomas Aquinas are pivotal figures. I've found that Augustine discusses the \"eternal law,\" which is God's reason and will, and the \"natural law,\" which is the eternal law \"impressed\" upon the rational soul of human beings. He equates natural law with humanity's state before the Fall (prelapsarian). After the Fall, humanity requires divine law and grace for salvation.\n\nThe idea of the laws of nature changing at the Fall is a topic of debate among Christians. Some believe the physical laws, such as the second law of thermodynamics, were introduced after the Fall. Others maintain that human nature, not the laws of the physical world, changed.\n\nWhile I have found connections between Augustine and the concept of natural law being altered by the Fall and his view of the virgin birth as a miracle that alters natural processes, I have not yet found a *specialized terminology* developed by a specific theologian to describe *both* of these phenomena. The terms I have encountered so far, such as \"eternal law\" and \"natural law,\" are general and part of a broader theological framework.\n\nTherefore, I need to continue my search to pinpoint a theologian who coined a specific term or set of terms for this purpose. I will investigate the works of other significant theologians and look for more direct connections between terminology used for the virgin birth and the Fall.\n\nMy next step is to search for specific theological terms related to the suspension or alteration of natural law and see if they are applied to both the virgin birth and the effects of the Fall. I'll also broaden my search to include more modern theologians who may have analyzed and named this concept in earlier thinkers.I have not yet found a specific Christian theologian who developed a specialized terminology applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations in natural laws at the Fall. While the concepts have been discussed extensively by theologians like Augustine and Aquinas, and are framed within their understanding of \"eternal law\" and \"natural law,\" a unique, dedicated term for this dual application is not apparent in the search results so far. The previous searches have been very helpful in understanding the theological context, but the specific terminology is still missing.\n\nI need to pivot my research to look for more niche theological discussions or analyses that might have coined such a term, or perhaps a theologian whose work is known for this specific kind of conceptual framework.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Search for less common or more specific theological terms related to the suspension or alteration of the laws of nature.\n2.  Investigate theologians known for their detailed work on the philosophy of miracles and divine action.\n3. Look for secondary sources—theological analyses or histories—that might identify and name this terminological link in the work of a particular theologian.\n\nThis more targeted approach should help me to either find the specific terminology or conclude with more certainty that a single, specialized term for both applications may not be a prominent feature of mainstream theological discourse.\nI have conducted several searches to find a Christian theologian who developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations in natural laws at the Fall.\n\nThe searches have revealed:\n\n*   The concept of \"natural law\" is central, with Augustine and Aquinas being key figures. Augustine saw natural law as tied to the prelapsarian state.\n*   The idea of physical laws changing at the Fall is a subject of debate. Some creationists propose changes like the introduction of the second law of thermodynamics.\n*   The virgin birth is understood as a miracle, a divine intervention that suspends or overrides natural law.\n*   The term \"Occasionalism\" describes a theological-philosophical view where God is the direct cause of all events, meaning there are no secondary causes and what we perceive as natural laws are just God's consistent will. This was prominent in Islamic theology (e.g., Al-Ghazali) and later discussed by philosophers like Malebranche. While this framework can accommodate miracles and changes in nature, it doesn't seem to be a specific terminology developed by a Christian theologian to address the virgin birth and the Fall in particular.\n*   Various terms are used for miracles, such as *dunamis* (power), *semeion* (sign), *teras* (wonder), and *ergon* (work) in the New Testament. Catholic theology categorizes miracles based on substance, subject, and mode (*miracula quoad substantiam, quoad subjectum, quoad modum*). However, these are general classifications of miracles and not a specific terminology applied to both the virgin birth and the changes at the Fall.\n\nSo far, I have not found a single Christian theologian who has developed a *specialized terminology* that specifically describes changes in natural law and is explicitly applied to both the virgin birth and the Fall. The concepts are certainly discussed, but usually within the broader frameworks of natural law, miracle, and divine providence, using more general theological language. It is possible that such a specific, niche terminology does not exist or is not widely known.\n\nGiven the depth of the searches, it is unlikely that further general searches will yield the answer. I have found significant background information but not the specific terminology requested. Therefore, I will now formulate my final answer based on the information gathered.\nI have been unable to identify a Christian theologian who has developed a specialized terminology that is applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations in the laws of nature at the Fall. While the concepts of natural law, miracles, and divine intervention have been extensively discussed by numerous theologians throughout history, a unique, designated term to unify these two specific events under a single descriptive framework does not appear to be a prominent or established part of Christian theological discourse. The existing terminology is of a more general nature.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to the question as I have not found a Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall.>>>"
