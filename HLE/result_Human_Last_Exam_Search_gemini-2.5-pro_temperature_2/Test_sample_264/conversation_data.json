    "The problem involves finding the volume of the intersection of two identical cubes. The key is to correctly interpret the phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal.\"\n\nLet's define the first cube, C1, as the set of points (x, y, z) such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ z ≤ 1. The main diagonal of this cube connects the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite corner (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n\nA shift \"along the main diagonal\" can be interpreted as a displacement in the direction of the vector **d**. The phrase \"by 1/2\" most straightforwardly means a displacement vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This interpretation keeps the calculations simple and is common for such problems. The search results support the approach of analyzing the intersection of axis-aligned cubes by looking at the overlap in each dimension independently.\n\nThe second cube, C2, is therefore defined by the inequalities:\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n\nTo find the volume of the intersection, we need to find the region where a point (x, y, z) satisfies the inequalities for both cubes. We determine the overlapping interval for each coordinate:\n*   **x-dimension:** The intersection of and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1].\n*   **y-dimension:** The intersection of and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1].\n*   **z-dimension:** The intersection of and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1].\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is itself a cube defined by 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1, 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1, and 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1. The side length of this smaller cube is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nThe volume of a cube is the side length cubed. Therefore, the volume of the intersection is:\nVolume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
