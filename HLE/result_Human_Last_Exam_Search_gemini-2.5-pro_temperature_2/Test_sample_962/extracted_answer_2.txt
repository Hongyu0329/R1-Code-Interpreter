A tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol can be designed by focusing on a secure Distributed Key Generation (DKG) process and a carefully constructed signing protocol. The DKG establishes shared keys without a trusted party. The signing protocol is divided into two rounds: a commitment round and a signature share generation round. For tight security, the scheme should be based on a well-understood underlying signature algorithm like Schnorr, and the design must prevent forgery attacks by strongly binding each signature to the message and the specific set of signers in the second round. A crucial element for tight security is to design the protocol in a way that the security proof does not lose significant factors in its reduction to the underlying hard problem, often by avoiding techniques like rewinding in the proof. Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures (FROST) is a prominent example of such a scheme.
