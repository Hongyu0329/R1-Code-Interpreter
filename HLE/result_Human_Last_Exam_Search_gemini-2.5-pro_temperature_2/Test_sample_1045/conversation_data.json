    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), we first need to determine the number of functions for each atom and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, the chemical formula for toluene is C7H8, which means it contains:\n*   7 Carbon (C) atoms\n*   8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\nNext, we need to know how many contracted basis functions the 6-31G basis set assigns to each type of atom. The 6-31G basis set is a split-valence double-zeta basis set.\n\n*   **For each Carbon atom (a \"heavy\" or non-hydrogen atom):** The 6-31G basis set includes one contracted function for the core (1s) orbital and two contracted functions for each valence orbital (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz).\n    *   Core: 1s orbital is represented by 1 contracted function.\n    *   Valence: There are four valence orbitals (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz). As a double-zeta basis set, each of these is represented by two functions (an \"inner\" and \"outer\" set). However, Pople basis sets like 6-31G group the s and p valence functions into shells. This results in:\n        *   One core 1s function.\n        *   One inner valence sp shell (containing one s and three p functions) = 4 functions.\n        *   One outer valence sp shell (containing one s and three p functions) = 4 functions.\n    *   Total for one Carbon atom = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 contracted functions.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen atom:** The 1s orbital is split into two parts.\n    *   An \"inner\" part represented by one contracted function.\n    *   An \"outer\" part represented by another contracted function.\n    *   Total for one Hydrogen atom = 2 contracted functions.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the toluene molecule:\n*   **From the 7 Carbon atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **From the 8 Hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n\n**Total Contracted Functions** = 63 (from C) + 16 (from H) = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
