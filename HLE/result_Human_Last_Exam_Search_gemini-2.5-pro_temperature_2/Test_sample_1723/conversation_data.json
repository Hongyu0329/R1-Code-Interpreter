    "There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print. While several species of mushrooms exhibit blue coloration in their fruiting bodies, their spore prints are of different colors.\n\nSome of the most well-known blue-colored mushrooms and their corresponding spore print colors include:\n\n*   **_Stropharia caerulea_ (Blue Roundhead):** This mushroom has a blue-green cap but produces a purple-brown to purple-black spore print.\n*   **_Lactarius indigo_ (Indigo Milk Cap):** Known for its striking indigo blue color and blue latex \"milk\", this species has a cream-colored or pale yellowish spore print.\n*   **_Entoloma hochstetteri_ (Blue Pinkgill):** A vibrant blue mushroom native to New Zealand, it is nicknamed the \"blue pinkgill\" because of its reddish-pink spore print.\n*   **_Panaeolus cyanescens_ (Blue-staining Panaeolus):** This mushroom turns blue when bruised but has a black spore print.\n*   **_Cortinarius rotundisporus_ (Elegant Blue Webcap):** Found in Australia, this mushroom has a steely blue cap and a reddish-brown spore print.\n\nSpore print color is a critical characteristic for mushroom identification and typically ranges from white, cream, yellow, and pink to various shades of brown and black. The genus *Entoloma* is a prime example where a blue mushroom produces a pink spore print, highlighting that the color of the mushroom itself does not determine the color of its spores.\n\n<<<There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
