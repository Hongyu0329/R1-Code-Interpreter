    "To accurately determine the number of peaks in the ¹H NMR spectrum, we must first analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\nThe compound is **1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene**.\n\n### Analysis of the Central Ring:\nThe core of the molecule is a hexasubstituted benzene ring.\n*   At positions 2, 4, and 6, there are methyl groups.\n*   At positions 1, 3, and 5, there are large, identical substituents: `[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]`.\n\nThe substitution pattern (1,3,5- and 2,4,6-) gives the molecule a C₃ rotational axis of symmetry. This symmetry makes the three methyl groups equivalent and the three large substituents equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the number of non-equivalent protons in one repeating unit and then sum them up.\n\n### Proton Signals from the Symmetric Core:\n1.  **2,4,6-Trimethyl groups:** Due to the C₃ symmetry, the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent. The protons within each group are also equivalent. This results in a single signal for all 9 protons. **(1 peak)**\n\n### Proton Signals from One Substituent Arm:\nNow let's analyze one of the identical arms: `[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]`. This substituent is attached to the benzene ring at position 1.\n\n2.  **Methylene linker (-CH₂-)**: This `CH₂` group connects the chiral camphor-derived indazole moiety to the central benzene ring. Protons of a CH₂ group next to a chiral center are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. They are expected to appear as an AB quartet, which is counted as one signal system but consists of two distinct resonances. We will count them as **2 peaks**.\n\n3.  **Camphor-derived indazole moiety**: The structure `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazole` is derived from (+)-camphor. Let's analyze the non-equivalent protons in this chiral fragment based on its known structure from similar compounds found in chemical literature.\n    *   **Pyrazole ring proton (H3)**: There is one proton on the pyrazole ring. **(1 peak)**\n    *   **Bridgehead proton (H4)**: There is a single proton at one of the bridgehead carbons of the bicyclic camphor framework. **(1 peak)**\n    *   **Methyl groups**: There are three methyl groups on the camphor skeleton. In the standard structure derived from (+)-camphor, these are non-equivalent due to the rigid, asymmetric bicyclic structure. These are often referred to as C1-Me, C7-syn-Me, and C7-anti-Me (or using the IUPAC numbering provided, 7-Me, 8-Me, and 8-Me'). They give rise to three separate signals. **(3 peaks)**\n    *   **Methylene protons in the bicyclic ring (H5 and H6)**: The camphor skeleton contains two CH₂ groups. In the parent camphor, these are the C5 and C6 positions. Each CH₂ group contains two diastereotopic protons (exo and endo). This results in four distinct proton signals. **(4 peaks)**\n\n### Summary of Predicted Peaks:\nLet's sum the number of distinct signals:\n*   From the central trimethylbenzene core: 1 (for the three Me groups)\n*   From the three identical substituent arms (we count the signals from one arm):\n    *   CH₂ linker: 2\n    *   Pyrazole H3: 1\n    *   Bridgehead H4: 1\n    *   Three methyl groups: 3\n    *   Four methylene protons (H5-endo, H5-exo, H6-endo, H6-exo): 4\n\nTotal number of peaks = 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 = **12**\n\n<<<H>>>"
