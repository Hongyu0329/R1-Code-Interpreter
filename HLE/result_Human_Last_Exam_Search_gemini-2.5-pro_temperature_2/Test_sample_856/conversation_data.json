    "A closed orientable 3-manifold with a finite fundamental group is known as a spherical 3-manifold. According to the Thurston-Perelman geometrization theorem, these are precisely the manifolds of the form S³/Γ, where Γ is a finite subgroup of SO(4) that acts freely on the 3-sphere S³.\n\nA crucial necessary condition for a finite group Γ to act freely on S³ is that all of its abelian subgroups must be cyclic. This is a strong constraint on the structure of Γ. If a group contains an abelian subgroup that is not cyclic, it cannot be the fundamental group of a closed orientable 3-manifold.\n\nLet's consider a group with cardinality 10! (3,628,800). The most well-known group of this order is the symmetric group on 10 elements, S₁₀. We can examine the subgroup structure of S₁₀.\n\nConsider the permutations (1 2) and (3 4) in S₁₀. Each of these is an element of order 2. They are disjoint, so they commute. The subgroup generated by these two elements consists of the identity, (1 2), (3 4), and their product (1 2)(3 4). This subgroup is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, V₄, which is also written as ℤ₂ × ℤ₂.\n\nThe Klein four-group is abelian, but it is not a cyclic group. Since S₁₀ contains an abelian subgroup that is not cyclic, it cannot act freely on S³. Therefore, S₁₀ cannot be the fundamental group of a closed orientable 3-manifold.\n\nThis reasoning extends to *any* group G of order 10!. The prime factorization of 10! is 2⁸ × 3⁴ × 5² × 7. By Sylow's theorems, any group of this order must have a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2⁸ = 256. Any finite p-group which is not cyclic contains a subgroup isomorphic to ℤ_p × ℤ_p. A group of order 256 cannot be cyclic within a larger group like one of order 10!, and therefore it must contain a subgroup isomorphic to the Klein four-group. Consequently, any group of order 10! will contain a non-cyclic abelian subgroup.\n\nThus, no group of cardinality 10! can serve as the fundamental group of a closed orientable 3-manifold.\n\n<<<0>>>"
