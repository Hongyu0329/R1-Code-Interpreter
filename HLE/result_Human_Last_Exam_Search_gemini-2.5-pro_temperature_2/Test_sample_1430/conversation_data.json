    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X.\n\nLet C be a smooth projective curve of genus g=3. Let X be its 15th symmetric power, X = Sym¹⁵(C). We want to find the range of the rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, denoted as ρ(X).\n\n1.  **Relating the Néron-Severi group of X to that of its Jacobian**\n\n    The symmetric power Symᵈ(C) of a curve C of genus g is closely related to its Jacobian variety, Jac(C), which is an abelian variety of dimension g. The Abel-Jacobi map maps Symᵈ(C) to Jac(C). When the degree d is large enough, specifically for d ≥ 2g - 1, this map makes Symᵈ(C) a projective bundle over Jac(C).\n\n    In our case, g=3 and d=15. Since 15 ≥ 2(3) - 1 = 5, the condition is satisfied. The variety X = Sym¹⁵(C) is a projective bundle over the Jacobian J = Jac(C). The rank of the Néron-Severi group of a projective bundle is one greater than the rank of the base. Therefore, we have the relation:\n    ρ(X) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1.\n\n2.  **Bounds for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of a Jacobian variety**\n\n    The problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values of ρ(Jac(C)). For an abelian variety A of dimension g, the rank of its Néron-Severi group, ρ(A), is bounded by 1 ≤ ρ(A) ≤ g². Since Jac(C) is a principally polarized abelian threefold (g=3), its Néron-Severi rank is bounded by 1 ≤ ρ(Jac(C)) ≤ 9.\n\n3.  **Smallest possible rank**\n\n    The smallest rank corresponds to a \"very general\" or generic curve. For a very general curve C of genus 3, its Jacobian J(C) is a simple abelian variety, meaning it has no non-trivial abelian subvarieties. The endomorphism ring of such a Jacobian is as small as possible, being just the integers Z. For such simple abelian varieties, the Néron-Severi group is generated by the class of a theta divisor, and its rank is 1.\n    Thus, the minimum possible value for the rank is ρ_min(Jac(C)) = 1.\n    This leads to the smallest possible rank for X:\n    ρ_min(X) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n4.  **Largest possible rank**\n\n    The largest possible rank is achieved for very special curves C. The rank ρ(A) of an abelian variety A of dimension g reaches its maximum value of g² if and only if A is of CM-type (Complex Multiplication type). This means A is isogenous to a product of g elliptic curves, each with complex multiplication.\n\n    For our case, ρ(Jac(C)) can be 9 if Jac(C) is isogenous to the product of three elliptic curves with complex multiplication. Such curves exist. A prime example is the **Fermat quartic curve**, defined by the equation x⁴ + y⁴ + z⁴ = 0. This is a smooth plane curve of genus g = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3. Its Jacobian is known to be isogenous to the cube of the elliptic curve y² = x³ - x, which has complex multiplication by the ring of Gaussian integers Z[i].\n\n    For the Fermat quartic curve, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian is ρ(Jac(C)) = 9.\n    This gives the largest possible rank for X:\n    ρ_max(X) = 9 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
