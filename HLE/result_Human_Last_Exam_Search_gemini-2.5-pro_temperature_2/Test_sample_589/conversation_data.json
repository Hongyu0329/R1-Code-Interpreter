    "After an extensive search for a Hollywood feature film produced by a major studio in which a teenager rides a pink bike and pedals directly toward an oncoming car, no definitive match has been found.\n\nThe search included numerous queries for scenes involving teenagers, pink bicycles, and encounters with cars, but did not identify a specific film that precisely matches the detailed description provided. The concept of \"playing chicken,\" where individuals head towards a collision, is a known trope in films, often involving cars or tractors, such as in \"Rebel Without a Cause\" and \"Footloose\". However, a scene with a teenager on a pink bike in a major Hollywood production does not appear in the search results.\n\nVarious online discussions and forums also contain queries about similar scenes, but these threads do not point to a specific, identifiable major motion picture. The results often lead to short films, music videos, or non-Hollywood productions. For example, there are mentions of a knockoff animated movie called \"Bikes\", but this is not a major studio film.\n\nWhile it is possible the user may be thinking of a scene from a television show, a foreign film, or a less mainstream movie, based on the performed searches, there is no major Hollywood feature film that is known for the specific scene described.\n\n<<<No definitive match found>>>"
