    "When an icosahedron tank is standing on one of its flat, triangular faces and is half-filled with water, the shape of the water's surface will be a **hexagon**.\n\nAn icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces. When it rests on one of these faces, its orientation is symmetrical. The top face is parallel to the bottom face. Due to this symmetry, when the tank is filled to half of its total volume, the water level will be exactly at half of the tank's total height.\n\nThe shape of the water surface is determined by the horizontal cross-section of the icosahedron at that halfway point. While various cross-sections are possible depending on the height of the slice, the cross-section at the exact midpoint of the height, when the icosahedron is resting on a face, is a hexagon. This hexagon is generally not a regular hexagon, with alternating angles of approximately 135.5 and 104.5 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the water surface will form a hexagonal shape.\n\n<<<hexagon>>>"
