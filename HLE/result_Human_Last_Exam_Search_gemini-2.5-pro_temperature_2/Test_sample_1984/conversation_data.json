    "To find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$, we first need to determine $m$, which represents the number of stable equilibrium points for the given differential equation:\n$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$.\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points are constant solutions to the differential equation, which occur where $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We set $f(x)$ to zero to find the equilibria:\n$-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0$\nFactoring out $-x$, we get:\n$-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$\nThis can be further simplified by factoring the quadratic expression:\n$-x(x - 1)^2 = 0$\nThe equilibrium points are the values of $x$ that satisfy this equation, which are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\n**2. Determining the Stability of Equilibrium Points**\n\nTo determine the stability of these points, we can use the derivative test. An equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable if $f'(x^*) < 0$ and unstable if $f'(x^*) > 0$. If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and further analysis is required.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the derivative at each equilibrium point:\n*   **For x = 0:**\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For x = 1:**\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the derivative test is inconclusive. We must analyze the sign of $f(x)$ on either side of $x=1$.\n\n    Let's examine the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$:\n    *   For a value slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x=1.1$), $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1 - 1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -0.011 < 0$. This means that for $x>1$, solutions will move towards $x=1$.\n    *   For a value slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$), $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9 - 1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.009 < 0$. This means that for $x<1$, solutions will move away from $x=1$.\n\nSince solutions on one side of $x=1$ move toward it, while solutions on the other side move away, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is classified as **semi-stable**. A semi-stable equilibrium is not considered a stable equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point for the given system, which is $x=0$. This means that the number of stable equilibria is $m = 1$.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$. Substituting the value of $m=1$, we get:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\n<<<1 - 2**4048>>>"
