    "### One Vertex is the Minimum for a Two-Loop Feynman Diagram in Interacting Scalar Field Theory\n\nThe minimum number of vertices required to construct a two-loop Feynman diagram in an interacting scalar field theory is one. This can be achieved in a theory with a four-point interaction, such as the λφ⁴ theory, through a vacuum diagram.\n\nIn quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram corresponds to the number of independent internal momentum integrals, which are not fixed by the external momenta. This is topologically related to the number of internal lines and vertices in a connected diagram by the formula L = I - V + 1, where L is the number of loops, I is the number of internal lines, and V is the number of vertices.\n\nWhile several common two-loop diagrams involve more than one vertex, the absolute minimum is found in a vacuum diagram (a diagram with no external lines). In a λφ⁴ theory, a single four-point vertex can form a two-loop diagram. This is often referred to as a \"figure-eight\" or \"double-scoop\" diagram. In this configuration, two of the four lines emerging from the vertex connect to each other, forming one loop, and the other two lines also connect, forming a second, independent loop. This structure has two independent loop momenta and therefore qualifies as a two-loop diagram, all while originating from a single interaction vertex.\n\nOther common two-loop diagrams in scalar field theory are more complex. For instance, the \"sunset\" self-energy diagram in φ⁴ theory requires two vertices. More intricate diagrams, such as two-loop corrections to the three-point vertex in a φ³ theory, can necessitate as many as five vertices. These examples highlight that while various two-loop diagrams exist, the single-vertex vacuum diagram represents the most minimal structure in terms of vertex count.\n\n<<<1>>>"
