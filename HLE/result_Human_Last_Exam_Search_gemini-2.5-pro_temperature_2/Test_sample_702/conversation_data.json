    "I have gathered information about the key concepts: connectivity of a map, the suspension-loop space functor, the smash product, and the James theorem. The connectivity of a map is determined by the homotopy groups of its homotopy fiber. Specifically, a map is n-connected if its homotopy fiber F is (n-1)-connected, meaning π_i(F) is trivial for i ≤ n-1. The smash product of spheres S^m and S^n is homeomorphic to S^(m+n). James' theorem provides a homotopy equivalence between ΩΣX and the James construction J(X) for a connected space X. A key splitting theorem, sometimes called the James splitting, states that for a connected space X, there is a homotopy equivalence ΣΩΣX ≃ ⋁_{i≥1} Σ(X^∧i). The functor ΣΩ is related to the identity functor by a natural transformation. To answer the question, I need to find information about the specific map φ: Σ(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6) → Ω(S^4 ∧ S^6). It is described as being \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers,\" but the precise nature of this inducing map is not specified. I need to investigate how such a map is typically constructed in this context, which likely involves the properties of loop spaces, suspension, and smash products, and their interactions. It seems the map might be related to the EHP sequence or other standard constructions in homotopy theory.The search results provided crucial information for understanding the problem, particularly the concepts of James-Hopf invariants, the Ganea fibration, and the connectivity of related maps. It's clear that the map in question is a specific instance of a more general construction in homotopy theory. Specifically, the map $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ can be identified (up to homotopy) with the James-Hopf invariant.\n\nTo determine the connectivity, I need to analyze the homotopy fiber of this map. The Ganea fibration provides a way to understand the fiber of the evaluation map $\\Sigma \\Omega X \\to X$, which is closely related to the James-Hopf invariant. For a $k$-connected space $X$, the fiber of the Ganea fibration is $(2k)$-connected. In our case, the space \"X\" is the smash product $S^4 \\wedge S^6$, which is homeomorphic to $S^{10}$. The connectivity of $S^{10}$ is 9. Therefore, the fiber of the corresponding Ganea fibration $\\Sigma \\Omega S^{10} \\to S^{10}$ is 18-connected.\n\nNow I need to relate this to the given map. The map $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is part of a larger picture involving the James splitting of $\\Sigma \\Omega (S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. This splitting gives a decomposition of $\\Sigma \\Omega(S^{10})$ into wedge summands, and the James-Hopf invariants map to these summands.\n\nThe map in question corresponds to the part of the James-Hopf invariant that involves the binary smash product. By understanding the relationship between the James-Hopf invariant and the Ganea fibration, and knowing the connectivity of the fiber of the Ganea fibration for $S^{10}$, I should be able to determine the connectivity of the map in question. The key will be to carefully assemble the pieces of information I have gathered. I believe I have enough information to proceed with the solution without further searches.\n\n## Connectivity of James-Hopf Type Map Determined to be 8\n\n**The map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, induced by a map of homotopy fibers, has a connectivity of 8.**\n\nThis problem delves into the intricate realm of algebraic topology, specifically concerning the relationships between loop spaces, suspension, and smash products. The map in question is a manifestation of a generalized James-Hopf invariant. To determine its connectivity, one must analyze the homotopy fiber of the map.\n\nA map is defined as *n*-connected if its homotopy fiber, F, is (*n*−1)-connected. This means that the first *n*-1 homotopy groups of F, denoted π<sub>i</sub>(F), are trivial for *i* ≤ *n*-1.\n\nThe spaces in the given map can be simplified. The smash product of two spheres, S<sup>m</sup> and S<sup>n</sup>, is homeomorphic to a sphere of dimension *m* + *n*. Therefore, S<sup>4</sup> ∧ S<sup>6</sup> is homeomorphic to S<sup>10</sup>. Substituting this into the map gives:\n\n$\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^{10})$\n\nThe domain of this map is related to the James splitting of ΣΩS<sup>10</sup>. The James splitting theorem states that for a connected space X, there's a homotopy equivalence:\nΣΩΣX ≃ ⋁<sub>n=1</sub><sup>∞</sup> Σ(X<sup>∧n</sup>)\n\nThis decomposition allows for the definition of James-Hopf invariants, which are maps from ΩΣX to the individual wedge summands ΩΣ(X<sup>∧n</sup>). The given map can be identified with a component of the James-Hopf invariant corresponding to the binary smash product.\n\nA crucial tool for analyzing the connectivity of such maps is the Ganea fibration (also known as the evaluation fibration) for a space X:\n\nΩΣX * ΩΣX → ΣΩX → X\n\nwhere the fiber is the join of the loop space of the suspension of X with itself. For a *k*-connected space X, the fiber of this map is (2*k*)-connected.\n\nIn this case, our space is X = S<sup>4</sup> ∧ S<sup>6</sup> ≅ S<sup>10</sup>. Since S<sup>10</sup> is 9-connected (*k*=9), the fiber of the Ganea fibration ΣΩS<sup>10</sup> → S<sup>10</sup> is (2 * 9) = 18-connected.\n\nNow, consider the connectivity of the spaces ΩS<sup>4</sup> and ΩS<sup>6</sup>. The loop space of an *n*-sphere, ΩS<sup>n</sup>, is (*n*−2)-connected. Therefore:\n*   ΩS<sup>4</sup> is 2-connected.\n*   ΩS<sup>6</sup> is 4-connected.\n\nThe connectivity of the smash product of two spaces is related to the sum of their individual connectivities. The smash product ΩS<sup>4</sup> ∧ ΩS<sup>6</sup> is (2 + 4 + 1) = 7-connected. Suspending this space, Σ(ΩS<sup>4</sup> ∧ ΩS<sup>6</sup>), makes it (7+1) = 8-connected.\n\nBy applying the Freudenthal suspension theorem and analyzing the long exact sequence of homotopy groups associated with the fibration that defines the given map, we can relate the connectivity of the map to the connectivity of the spaces involved. The connectivity of the map is limited by the connectivity of its domain, which is 8.\n\nTherefore, the connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
