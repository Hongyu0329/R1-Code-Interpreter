    "The rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is 0.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1.  **Identifying the space**: The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is known as the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted $G(3, 5)$. It is a compact manifold of dimension $3 \\times (5-3) = 6$.\n\n2.  **Integral Cohomology and Torsion**: The integral cohomology ring, $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$, is a graded abelian group. For real Grassmannians $G(k, n)$, the integral cohomology can have elements of finite order, known as torsion elements. Specifically, the cohomology of real Grassmannians is known to have 2-torsion.\n\n3.  **Existence of Torsion in H*(G(3,5);Z)**: The Grassmannian $G(k, \\mathbb{R}^n)$ is orientable if and only if $n$ is even. Since $n=5$ is odd, $G(3, 5)$ is a non-orientable 6-dimensional manifold. For a compact, connected, non-orientable $d$-manifold, the top cohomology group with integer coefficients is $H^d(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Thus, for $G(3, 5)$, $H^6(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. This confirms that the torsion subgroup of the cohomology is non-trivial. In fact, a detailed computation shows that the torsion subgroup of $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n4.  **Definition of Rank**: The rank of an abelian group is the cardinality of a maximal linearly independent subset over the integers. Equivalently, for an abelian group $A$, its rank is the dimension of the vector space $A \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n5.  **Rank of a Torsion Group**: A torsion group is a group where every element has finite order. Let $T$ be a torsion group. For any element $t \\in T$, there exists a non-zero integer $n$ such that $nt=0$. When we consider the tensor product $T \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$, any element $t \\otimes q$ (where $t \\in T$ and $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$) is equal to zero: $t \\otimes q = t \\otimes (nq/n) = (nt) \\otimes (q/n) = 0 \\otimes (q/n) = 0$. This means that $T \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ is the zero vector space, which has dimension 0. Therefore, any torsion abelian group has a rank of 0.\n\nBased on this, the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of $G(3,5)$, being a torsion group, has a rank of 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
