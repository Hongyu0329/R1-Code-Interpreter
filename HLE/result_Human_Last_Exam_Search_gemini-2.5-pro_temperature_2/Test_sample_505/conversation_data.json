    "There are two primary methods for encoding multiple logical qubits using surface codes: employing multiple, separate patches of surface code or creating defects, known as holes, within a single, larger patch. This question involves a scenario that combines both approaches.\n\nA single patch of surface code can have its capacity for storing logical qubits increased by introducing holes. These holes are created by deactivating specific stabilizer measurements, which in turn provides the additional degrees of freedom necessary to encode more logical qubits.\n\nThe number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a single patch of surface code is directly related to the number of these holes. Specifically, a surface code with *k* appropriately placed and independent \"closed\" holes can encode *k* logical qubits. A visual representation in a relevant research paper explicitly states, \"A surface code with two closed holes... encodes two logical qubits\".\n\nTherefore, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode a maximum of two logical qubits.\n\nSince the question specifies there are two such patches, and each patch is an independent unit for encoding, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits encoded in each patch. With each of the two patches encoding two logical qubits, the total number of logical qubits is four.\n\n<<<4>>>"
