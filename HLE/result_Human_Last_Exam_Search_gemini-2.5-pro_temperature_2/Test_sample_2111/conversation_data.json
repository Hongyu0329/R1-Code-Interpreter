    "In his exploration of global history, Fernand Braudel referenced Paul Morand's assertion that a **civilization** is the conceptual entity that should be inscribed within a sphere, using the symbol of a nation as a prime example.\n\nBraudel delves into the spatial and cultural boundaries that define a civilization. The connection to the writer and diplomat Paul Morand is made through the concept of \"Morand's hexagon,\" a term used to describe the geographical shape and national identity of France. This idea of a nation, and by extension its civilization, being encapsulated within a distinct, almost geometric boundary aligns with the imagery of being inscribed within a sphere. While the precise phrase \"inscribed within a sphere\" is a paraphrase of Braudel's intricate arguments, the core concept remains: a civilization possesses a defined, albeit permeable, area of influence and identity, exemplified by the hexagonal representation of France that Braudel attributes to Morand.\n\n<<<civilization>>>"
