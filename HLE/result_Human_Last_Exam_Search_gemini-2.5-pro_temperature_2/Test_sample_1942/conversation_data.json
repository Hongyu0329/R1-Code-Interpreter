    "Peter Sloterdijk considers that the State is a metaphor for the anthroposphere he calls **Globes**.\n\nIn his monumental trilogy *Spheres*, Peter Sloterdijk introduces a theory of \"spherology\" to describe the spaces that humans create and inhabit. These \"spheres\" are self-contained environments that function as immune systems, providing protection and meaning. Sloterdijk categorizes these spheres into three main types: *Bubbles*, *Globes*, and *Foams*.\n\n*   ***Bubbles*** are microspheres, representing the intimate and dyadic relationships like that between a mother and child.\n*   ***Foams*** describe the contemporary condition of modern life, a structure of multiple, interconnected, yet separate individual spheres or bubbles.\n*   ***Globes*** are macrospheres, which represent large-scale, all-encompassing political, metaphysical, and religious structures that aim to provide a totalizing worldview and security.\n\nThe State falls squarely into the category of a macrosphere. The second volume of the trilogy, titled *Globes*, is dedicated to \"macrospherology\" and traces the philosophical and political history of humanity through the metaphor of the orb and the globe. Sloterdijk argues that a key phase of globalization was the creation of these \"globes\"—totalizing systems like empires, world religions, and, by extension, the modern nation-state—which seek to create a unified and protected world for their inhabitants. He sees the ancient Greek idea of the cosmos as an ordered orb as the first \"metaphysical globalization,\" a precursor to the political globes that would follow.\n\nTherefore, the State, as a large-scale political entity that creates a self-enclosed and ordered world for its citizens, is a manifestation of the \"Globe\" anthroposphere. Sloterdijk also re-examines the classical metaphor of the \"ship of state\" as an \"ontology of enclosed space,\" which aligns with his broader theory of spheres as protective enclosures. However, the most encompassing and central metaphor for the state in his work is the Globe, representing the human ambition to construct vast, world-ordering political spheres.\n\n<<<Globes>>>"
