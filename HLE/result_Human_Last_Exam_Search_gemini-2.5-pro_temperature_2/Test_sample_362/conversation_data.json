    "The product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**, along with triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct.\n\nThe Wittig reaction is a method for synthesizing alkenes from aldehydes or ketones by reacting them with a phosphorus ylide (also known as a Wittig reagent). The reaction proceeds by replacing the carbonyl oxygen atom of the aldehyde or ketone with the carbon group from the ylide, forming a new carbon-carbon double bond. The formation of the very stable phosphorus-oxygen double bond in the triphenylphosphine oxide byproduct is the driving force for this reaction.\n\nIn this specific reaction:\n*   **The aldehyde** is pivalaldehyde, which has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **The Wittig reagent** is (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This phosphorus ylide provides the (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene) group to the new double bond. Its structure is (C₆H₅)₃P=CHCH₂(2-ClC₆H₄).\n\nThe carbon-oxygen double bond of pivalaldehyde breaks, and the phosphorus-carbon double bond of the ylide breaks. A new double bond forms between the carbonyl carbon of pivalaldehyde and the ylide carbon, resulting in the alkene product: **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n**Stereochemistry:**\nThe product has a double bond with substituents on both carbons, which can lead to E/Z isomerism. The ylide in this reaction is considered a non-stabilized ylide because the carbanionic carbon is attached to an alkyl group. Wittig reactions involving non-stabilized ylides typically yield a mixture of (E)- and (Z)-alkenes, with the (Z)-isomer being the major product under standard, salt-free conditions. Therefore, the main product would be (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene, though some of the (E)-isomer would also be formed.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene"
