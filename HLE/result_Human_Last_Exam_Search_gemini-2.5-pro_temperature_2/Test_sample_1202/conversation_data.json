    "After a gene duplication event, the resulting two gene copies are initially redundant. This redundancy means that one copy is likely to accumulate debilitating mutations and become a non-functional pseudogene, a process known as pseudogenization. Therefore, for both copies to be preserved in the genome, a mechanism must be in place to ensure their retention. Several models explain how these duplicate genes are not only retained but also diverge over time. Let's analyze the given options:\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer between homologous sequences. Rather than promoting divergence, gene conversion tends to homogenize duplicated genes, making them more similar. This works against long-term divergence.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate for one copy of a duplicated gene, where it loses its function through mutation. This is a mechanism of gene loss, not retention and divergence into a new or subdivided function.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes that one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original function, while the other copy accumulates mutations and acquires a completely new, beneficial function. This is an adaptive process that explains both the retention of the gene (as it has a new, advantageous role) and its divergence.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** According to this model, the ancestral gene had multiple functions (e.g., it was expressed in different tissues or at different developmental stages). After duplication, each copy accumulates degenerative mutations in different subfunctions until each gene is specialized for a subset of the original functions. As both copies are now required to fulfill the complete original function, both are retained. This also leads to their divergence in terms of regulation and/or function.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of a single ancestral species into multiple new species that occupy different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material for such an event, it is not a direct molecular mechanism for the retention and divergence of an individual gene pair.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are the principal and most widely accepted mechanisms that explain the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. They provide a selective advantage for keeping both copies, preventing the otherwise likely outcome of pseudogenization. Between the two, subfunctionalization is often considered a very likely, and possibly more frequent, outcome because it can occur through the accumulation of neutral or nearly neutral degenerative mutations, which are more common than the rare beneficial mutations required for neofunctionalization. However, both are key mechanisms. Given the choices, both C and D are much better answers than A, B, and E. Both represent established pathways for duplicate gene preservation and evolution.\n\n<<<D>>>"
