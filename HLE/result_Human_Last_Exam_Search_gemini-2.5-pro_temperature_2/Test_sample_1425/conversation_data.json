    "### The Partition Function Z in the Grand Canonical Ensemble\n\nThe grand canonical partition function, Z, for a system is given by the trace of the density matrix operator in the grand canonical ensemble:\n\nZ = Tr[exp(-β(H - μN))]\n\nwhere:\n*   **H** is the Hamiltonian of the system.\n*   **μ** is the chemical potential.\n*   **N** is the number operator.\n*   **β** is the inverse temperature, 1/(k_B T), where k_B is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.\n\nThe trace is taken over all possible states of the system, including states with different particle numbers.\n\nIn this specific problem, the Hamiltonian is given as H = -μN. Substituting this into the general formula for the partition function, we get:\n\nZ = Tr[exp(-β(-μN - μN))] = Tr[exp(2βμN)]\n\nThe path integral formulation of the grand canonical partition function is a powerful tool to calculate this trace, especially in field theory. In this framework, the partition function can be expressed as a functional integral over fields representing the particles. The calculation often simplifies to a product or sum over the single-particle energy states. The provided Hamiltonian, H = -μN, implies that every particle in the system has an energy of -μ, regardless of its momentum or position. This effectively means we are dealing with a system of degenerate energy levels. For simplicity, we can consider the case of a single available quantum state with energy ε = -μ.\n\nThe final form of the partition function depends on the quantum statistics of the particles, i.e., whether they are bosons or fermions.\n\n#### For a System of Bosons\n\nBosons are particles that can share the same quantum state. Therefore, the single available energy state can be occupied by any number of particles (N = 0, 1, 2, ...). The trace becomes a sum over all possible particle numbers:\n\nZ_boson = &sum;_{N=0 to &infin;} exp(2βμN)\n\nThis is a geometric series with a common ratio of exp(2βμ). The series converges if the absolute value of the common ratio is less than one, which requires that μ < 0. The sum is:\n\n**Z_boson = 1 / (1 - exp(2βμ))**\n\n#### For a System of Fermions\n\nFermions are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, which means that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For a single available state, the occupation number N can only be 0 or 1. The trace is therefore a sum over these two possibilities:\n\nZ_fermion = exp(2βμ * 0) + exp(2βμ * 1)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n**Z_fermion = 1 + exp(2βμ)**\n\nThe path integral formalism provides a rigorous framework for these results. For bosons, a coherent state path integral over a single mode with an effective energy of -2μ (from the exponent) yields the geometric series result. For fermions, a path integral using Grassmann variables results in the two-term sum.\n\n<<<\nThe partition function Z depends on the statistics of the particles.\n\nFor a system of **bosons**, the partition function is:\nZ = 1 / (1 - e^(2βμ))\n\nFor a system of **fermions**, the partition function is:\nZ = 1 + e^(2βμ)\n\nwhere β is the inverse temperature (1/k_BT) and μ is the chemical potential."
