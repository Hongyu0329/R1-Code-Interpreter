    "## Mount Ida on Crete Stands as the Second-Tallest Peak in the Iliad\n\nAfter the revered Mount Olympus, the highest historical mountain mentioned in Homer's epic poem, the *Iliad*, is Mount Ida on the island of Crete, which soars to an elevation of 2,456 meters (8,058 feet). Another peak bearing the same name, Mount Ida in modern-day Turkey, near the ancient city of Troy, is also prominently featured in the epic but stands at a lower height of 1,774 meters (5,820 feet).\n\nThe *Iliad* makes numerous references to mountains, both as settings for divine intervention and as geographical landmarks in the narrative of the Trojan War. While Mount Olympus, the mythical abode of the gods, is the tallest at 2,917 meters (9,570 feet), other significant peaks are mentioned.\n\nAmong these, the Cretan Mount Ida is the most prominent in terms of elevation. In Greek mythology, it is renowned as the birthplace of Zeus.\n\nOther mountains that play a role in the ancient text include Mount Othrys in central Greece, with a height of 1,726 meters (5,663 feet), and Mount Cyllene on the Peloponnese peninsula, which reaches 2,376 meters (7,795 feet). Mount Placus is also mentioned as a wooded mountain near the city of Thebe, though its precise location and height are not definitively known.\n\nTherefore, when comparing the known elevations of the historical mountains described in the *Iliad*, Mount Ida of Crete is the tallest after Mount Olympus.\n\n<<<Mount Ida (Crete)>>>"
