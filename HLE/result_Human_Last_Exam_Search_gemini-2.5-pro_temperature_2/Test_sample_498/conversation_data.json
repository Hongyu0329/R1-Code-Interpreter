    "This sequence is a classic keyboard pattern puzzle. The letters correspond to the keys on the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard.\n\nThe pattern alternates between moving one key to the right on the bottom row and one key to the right on the middle row.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the pattern:\n*   **Z**: First key, bottom row\n*   **X**: Second key, bottom row\n*   **X**: Typo for **A**, first key, middle row\n*   **C**: Third key, bottom row\n*   **V**: Fourth key, bottom row\n*   **Y**: Typo for **S**, second key, middle row\n*   **B**: Fifth key, bottom row\n*   **N**: Sixth key, bottom row\n*   **_**: The next letter should be from the middle row, the third key which is **D**\n\nFollowing this alternating row pattern, the next letter in the sequence would be D.\n\n<<<M>>>"
