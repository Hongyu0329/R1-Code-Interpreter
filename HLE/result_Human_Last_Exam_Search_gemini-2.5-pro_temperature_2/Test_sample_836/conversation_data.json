    "In the nuclear criticality community, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor**, often denoted as *S(q, ω)*.\n\nThis function is of fundamental importance as it directly relates to the double-differential scattering cross-section, which describes the probability of a neutron scattering from a material with a specific change in energy and momentum. The dynamic structure factor contains information about the correlations between particles in both space and time within a material.\n\nIn the context of nuclear criticality safety analysis, the information from the dynamic structure factor is often incorporated into nuclear data libraries in the form of the **thermal scattering law**, denoted as *S(α, β)*. Here, α and β are dimensionless variables representing momentum and energy transfer, respectively. This thermal scattering law is crucial for accurately modeling the behavior of thermal neutrons in computer codes used for criticality calculations, such as MCNP.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function itself, introduced by Léon Van Hove, describes the probability of finding a particle at a certain position at a given time, relative to the position of another particle at an earlier time. Its double Fourier transform, the dynamic structure factor, is what is experimentally accessible through inelastic neutron scattering.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
