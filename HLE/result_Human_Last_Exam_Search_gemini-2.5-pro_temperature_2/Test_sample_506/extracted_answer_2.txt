**1. Amlodipine**

*   **Drug Class:** Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB).
*   **Rationale:** CCBs are a first-line treatment for hypertension, particularly in African American patients. Given that MM cannot take verapamil (a non-dihydropyridine CCB), a long-acting dihydropyridine like amlodipine is an excellent alternative. It works by relaxing blood vessels, which lowers blood pressure. A combination of a CCB with a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker is a highly effective strategy.

**2. Losartan**

*   **Drug Class:** Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB).
*   **Rationale:** For patients with hypertension and diabetes (MM's A1c is 6.7%), an ARB or an ACE inhibitor is a preferred agent to protect the kidneys. ARBs are a cornerstone of antihypertensive therapy and are often combined with CCBs and diuretics for maximal effect. Given MM's resistant hypertension, including a RAS blocker like losartan is critical.

**3. Spironolactone**

*   **Drug Class:** Aldosterone Antagonist (Potassium-Sparing Diuretic).
*   **Rationale:** Resistant hypertension is defined as uncontrolled blood pressure despite using three different classes of antihypertensives, one of which should ideally be a diuretic. Since most common diuretics (thiazides and loops) are unavailable to this patient, spironolactone is the next logical and highly effective choice. It is a recommended fourth-line agent for treating resistant hypertension and works by blocking aldosterone, which can help reduce sodium and water retention. It is particularly effective when added to a regimen that already includes a RAS blocker and a CCB. Due to the combination with losartan, her kidney function and potassium levels should be monitored.
