    "A fixed point of a function $h(x)$ is a value $x$ for which $h(x) = x$. We are asked to find the maximum number of fixed points for the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$, given the properties of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of fixed points:\n\n### 1. Determine the Degree of the Composite Polynomial\n*   $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n*   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n*   The composition of these two polynomials, $h(x) = f(g(x))$, will be a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n### 2. Relate Fixed Points to a Polynomial Equation\nThe fixed points are the solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$. This can be rewritten as:\n$f(g(x)) - x = 0$\n\nSince $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree 9, the expression $f(g(x)) - x$ is also a polynomial of degree 9.\n\n### 3. Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra\nAccording to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a non-zero polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots.\nTherefore, the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$, being a polynomial equation of degree 9, can have at most 9 real roots. This means the maximum possible number of fixed points is 9.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Constraints\nWe are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$. This means both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n\nLet's check the derivative of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ using the chain rule:\n$h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$\n\n*   Since $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, this term is always positive.\n*   Since $f'(y) > 0$ for any input $y$, the term $f'(g(x))$ is also always positive.\n\nThe product of two positive numbers is positive, so $h'(x) > 0$ for all $x$. This implies that the composite function $h(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\n### 5. Achievability of the Maximum\nThe question now is whether a strictly increasing polynomial of degree 9 can actually have 9 fixed points.\nA fixed point is an intersection of the graph of $y = h(x)$ with the line $y=x$. For a strictly increasing function, the graph always moves upward as x increases. However, it can still \"wiggle\" and cross the line $y=x$ multiple times.\n\nA polynomial of degree 9 can have up to 7 inflection points (where the concavity changes). These changes in concavity allow the graph to weave across the line $y=x$. It is possible to construct a strictly increasing polynomial $h(x)$ of degree 9 such that the equation $h(x) - x = 0$ has 9 distinct real roots. While the explicit construction of the polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is complex, it is known to be possible. Therefore, the upper bound of 9 is achievable.\n\nThus, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
