    "The user is asking for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n\nFrom the initial search, I have gathered the following definitions:\n*   **Finite Ultrametric Space:** A metric space $(X, d)$ where $X$ is a finite set and the metric $d$ satisfies the strong triangle inequality: $d(x, z) \\le \\max\\{d(x, y), d(y, z)\\}$ for all $x, y, z \\in X$.\n*   **Isometric Embedding:** A mapping $f: X \\to B$ from a metric space $(X, d_X)$ to another metric space $(B, d_B)$ is an isometric embedding if for every two points $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, $d_B(f(x_1), f(x_2)) = d_X(x_1, x_2)$.\n\nThe question is about the *smallest possible number* of such embeddings. This means I need to consider if an embedding always exists, and if so, how many different ones can be constructed. The cardinality of the Banach space $B$ might be a distractor or a key element.\n\nA key finding from the search is a paper titled \"Isometric embedding of finite ultrametric spaces in Banach spaces\" by S.A. Shkarin. A related article states: \"We prove that for any finite ultrametric space M and any infinite-dimensional Banach space B there exists an isometric embedding of M into B.\" This suggests that at least one such embedding always exists when B is infinite-dimensional. The cardinality K of the Banach space would be infinite in this case.\n\nIf a single isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$ exists, can we construct others?\nLet $f$ be an isometric embedding.\n1.  **Translation:** For any vector $b_0 \\in B$, the map $g(x) = f(x) + b_0$ is also an isometric embedding. This is because the norm in a Banach space is translation-invariant: $\\| (f(x_1) + b_0) - (f(x_2) + b_0) \\| = \\| f(x_1) - f(x_2) \\|$. Since $B$ has cardinality $K$, there are at least $K$ such translations, assuming $f(x)$ is not the zero vector for all $x$.\n2.  **Linear Isometries of B:** If $T: B \\to B$ is a linear isometry, then the composition $T \\circ f$ is also an isometric embedding. The number of such linear isometries depends on the specific Banach space $B$.\n\nThe question asks for the *smallest possible* number.\n\nLet's consider the case where an isometric embedding is not guaranteed to exist. However, the result from seems to indicate existence for any infinite-dimensional Banach space. What if the Banach space is finite-dimensional? Let's assume K is finite. The only finite-dimensional real Banach space is $\\{0\\}$, which has cardinality 1. Any other real vector space is infinite. So if K is a finite cardinal, we must be in a trivial case. If the Banach space is over a finite field, then it can be finite. However, Banach spaces are typically defined over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$. So, $K$ must be infinite.\n\nIf $K$ is infinite, and we have one embedding $f$, we can generate $K$ embeddings by translation $f(x) + b_0$ for each $b_0 \\in B$. This gives at least $K$ embeddings, unless $X$ has only one point, in which case there is only one distance (0) and any point in B is an embedding. If $|X|=1$, say $X=\\{x_0\\}$, then $f(x_0)$ can be any point in $B$. There are $K$ such embeddings.\n\nLet's re-read the question carefully: \"What is the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings...\". This implies we should look for a scenario (a specific X and a specific B) where the number of embeddings is minimized.\n\nConsider the case of a trivial ultrametric space, where all distinct points are at the same distance, say $d(x,y) = c > 0$ for $x \\neq y$. This is called an equilateral set. Let $|X| = n$. We are looking for points $b_1, \\dots, b_n$ in $B$ such that $\\|b_i - b_j\\| = c$ for $i \\neq j$. If such a set of points exists, it forms an equilateral set in $B$. proves that any Banach space containing an isomorphic copy of $c_0$ admits an infinite equilateral set.\n\nWhat if there are no isometric embeddings? A paper mentions that \"It is easy to find examples of small metric spaces that admit no iso- metric embedding into the plane R2 with the Euclidean metric. One. such example is the 4-point equilateral space, with every two points at. distance 1\". However, $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with the Euclidean norm is not just *any* Banach space. The question is about *a* Banach space $B$. For any finite metric space $(X, d)$, it can be isometrically embedded into $C(X)$, the space of continuous functions on $X$ with the sup norm, which is a Banach space. Specifically, for a point $x_0 \\in X$, the map $f(x) = d(x, \\cdot) - d(x_0, \\cdot)$ embeds $X$ into $C(X)$. A simpler embedding is the Kuratowski embedding. Fix $p \\in X$ and for each $x \\in X$, define $f_x \\in \\ell^\\infty(X)$ by $f_x(y) = d(x, y)$. The space $\\ell^\\infty(X)$ of bounded functions on $X$ with the sup norm is a Banach space. The map $x \\mapsto f_x$ is an isometric embedding.\nSo, an isometric embedding from any finite metric space (and thus any finite ultrametric space) into *some* Banach space always exists.\n\nLet $f: X \\to B$ be an isometric embedding. As discussed, for any $b \\in B$, $g(x) = f(x) + b$ is also an isometric embedding. So, if there is one, there are at least $|B|=K$ of them, provided we don't double count. If $f(x) + b_1 = f(x) + b_2$ for all $x$, then $b_1 = b_2$. So these are all distinct.\n\nThis gives a lower bound of $K$. Can it be smaller?\nThe only way it could be smaller than $K$ is if there are certain constraints on which Banach spaces are allowed. But the question is general.\n\nLet's consider if the number of embeddings can be 0 or 1.\n- Can it be 0? No, as the Kuratowski embedding always exists into $\\ell^\\infty(X)$. The cardinality of $\\ell^\\infty(X)$ for a finite set $X$ of size $n>0$ is the cardinality of $\\mathbb{R}^n$, which is $|\\mathbb{R}| = \\mathfrak{c}$. So $K$ can be $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n- Can it be 1? Let $f$ be an embedding. Then $g(x) = f(x) + b$ for any $b \\in B$ is also an embedding. If there is only one embedding, then we must have $f(x) = f(x) + b$ for all $b \\neq 0$, which implies $b=0$. This is only possible if the Banach space is the trivial space $B=\\{0\\}$. In this case, the cardinality $K=1$. If $B=\\{0\\}$, then any embedding must map all points of $X$ to $0$. This means $d(f(x), f(y)) = \\|0-0\\| = 0$ for all $x,y \\in X$. This is only an isometric embedding if $d(x,y)=0$ for all $x,y \\in X$, which means $X$ must be a single point. If $|X|=1$, say $X=\\{x_1\\}$, then an embedding is just a map $f: \\{x_1\\} \\to B$. Any choice of $f(x_1) \\in B$ works. If $|B|=K$, there are $K$ such embeddings. So for $K=1$, there is 1 embedding. So, if we can have a Banach space of cardinality 1, the answer is 1. The space $\\{0\\}$ is a Banach space, and its cardinality is 1. It can isometrically embed a 1-point metric space.\n\nWhat if $|X| > 1$? Then $d(x,y)$ is not always 0. The space $B=\\{0\\}$ cannot isometrically embed $X$. So we need a non-trivial Banach space. Any non-trivial Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ has at least cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\nLet $B$ be a non-trivial Banach space. Its cardinality $K$ is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$.\nWe know at least one isometric embedding $f$ exists.\nLet $f_b(x) = f(x) + b$ for $b \\in B$. This gives $K$ distinct isometric embeddings.\nLet $g$ be another isometric embedding. Is it always a translation of $f$? Not necessarily. Consider $X = \\{a, b\\}$ with $d(a,b)=1$. We need to find $u, v \\in B$ with $\\|u-v\\|=1$. The embedding is $f(a)=u, f(b)=v$. Any other pair $u', v'$ with $\\|u'-v'\\|=1$ defines another embedding. For instance, pick any $w \\in B$ with $\\|w\\|=1$. Then $u'=0, v'=w$ works. So does $u'=z, v'=z+w$ for any $z \\in B$. Also, $u''=0, v''=-w$ is another one, unless $w=-w$ which means $w=0$, but $\\|w\\|=1$. So if the unit sphere is not just a single point (i.e. if $\\dim(B)>0$), there are more embeddings than just translations.\n\nThe question asks for the *smallest possible* number.\nSo we want to find a combination of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ that minimizes the number of embeddings.\n\nLet's reconsider the case $K=1$, i.e., $B=\\{0\\}$.\nThis space can isometrically embed a metric space $X$ if and only if all distances in $X$ are 0. For a metric space, $d(x,y)=0 \\iff x=y$. So this implies that for all $x,y \\in X$, we have $x=y$. This means $X$ must be a set with at most one element.\nIf $X$ is empty, there is exactly one map from $\\emptyset$ to $B$, the empty map. This is an isometric embedding. So, for the empty set $X$, there is 1 embedding.\nIf $|X|=1$, say $X=\\{p\\}$, then for any $b \\in B$, the map $f(p)=b$ is an isometric embedding since $d(f(p),f(p))=0$ and $d(p,p)=0$. So there are $|B|=K$ embeddings. If $K=1$ (i.e., $B=\\{0\\}$), there is 1 embedding.\n\nSo if $X$ can be a 1-point space and $B$ can be the trivial Banach space $\\{0\\}$, the answer is 1. Is this a valid interpretation of the question? Usually \"finite ultrametric space\" implies non-empty. \"Banach space\" could in principle be the trivial one. If the space must be non-empty, then $|X|\\ge1$.\n\nScenario 1: $|X|=1, B=\\{0\\}$. Number of embeddings = 1.\nScenario 2: $|X|>1$. Then not all distances are 0. So $B$ cannot be $\\{0\\}$. $B$ must be a Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$. The cardinality $K$ of $B$ is infinite.\nAn embedding exists. Let it be $f$. Then $f_b(x) = f(x)+b$ for $b \\in B$ gives $K$ distinct embeddings. So the number of embeddings is at least $K$. Can it be exactly $K$?\n\nLet's assume the question implicitly considers non-trivial cases, e.g. $|X| \\geq 2$.\nAs shown, an embedding into some Banach space always exists.\nLet $f: X \\to B$ be an isometric embedding.\nThe set of all isometric embeddings is $\\text{Emb}(X, B)$.\nWe have an action of the additive group of $B$ on $\\text{Emb}(X, B)$ by $(b, f) \\mapsto f+b$.\nThe orbit of $f$ under this action has size $|B|=K$, since $f+b_1 = f+b_2 \\implies b_1=b_2$.\nSo, $|\\text{Emb}(X, B)| \\ge K$.\n\nCan we find $X$ and $B$ such that there are *exactly* $K$ embeddings?\nThis would mean that all isometric embeddings are just translations of each other.\nLet $f_1, f_2$ be two isometric embeddings. Does there exist a $b \\in B$ such that $f_2(x) = f_1(x) + b$ for all $x \\in X$?\nLet $x_0 \\in X$. Define $b = f_2(x_0) - f_1(x_0)$.\nWe need to check if $f_2(x) = f_1(x) + (f_2(x_0) - f_1(x_0))$ for all $x \\in X$.\nThis is equivalent to $f_2(x) - f_2(x_0) = f_1(x) - f_1(x_0)$ for all $x \\in X$.\nLet $g_1(x) = f_1(x) - f_1(x_0)$ and $g_2(x) = f_2(x) - f_2(x_0)$.\nBoth $g_1$ and $g_2$ are isometric embeddings of $X$ into $B$ that map $x_0$ to the origin $0_B$.\nThe question of whether all embeddings are translations of each other reduces to the question of whether an isometric embedding that maps a given point $x_0 \\in X$ to the origin is unique.\nSo, is there a pair $(X, B)$ for which there is a unique isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$ with $f(x_0)=0$?\n\nLet $|X|=2$, $X=\\{x_0, x_1\\}$ with $d(x_0, x_1)=c$. An embedding $f$ with $f(x_0)=0$ must satisfy $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_0)\\| = \\|f(x_1)\\| = c$. So $f(x_1)$ must be a vector of norm $c$. The number of such vectors is the size of the sphere of radius $c$. In a general Banach space, this sphere is infinite if the space is not $\\{0\\}$.\nFor example in $B = \\mathbb{R}$ with the usual norm, the sphere of radius $c>0$ consists of two points, $\\{c, -c\\}$. So there would be two such embeddings fixing $x_0$ at 0. One maps $x_1$ to $c$, the other to $-c$. So the total number of embeddings would be $2 \\times |\\mathbb{R}|$, not just $|\\mathbb{R}|$.\n\nThe question asks for the *smallest possible number*. This implies the number is independent of the choice of $X$ and $B$ (as long as they satisfy the conditions) or we have to find a minimal case. The phrasing \"the smallest possible number\" suggests it's a single number, not an expression in K.\n\nWhat if the only possible isometric embedding is the trivial one, mapping all points to a single point? This is only possible if all distances are zero, which means $|X| \\le 1$. If $|X|=1$, there are $K$ embeddings. If $K$ can be 1, the answer is 1. If $K$ must be infinite, there are infinitely many. This seems to be the most straightforward reading. The question does not restrict $X$ to have more than one point, nor does it restrict $B$ to be non-trivial.\n\nA Banach space can be $\\{0\\}$. Its cardinality is $K=1$.\nA finite ultrametric space $X$ can be a single point space, say $X=\\{p\\}$. The metric is $d(p,p)=0$.\nAn isometric embedding is a function $f:X \\to B$ such that $d_B(f(x),f(y)) = d_X(x,y)$.\nHere, we need $d_B(f(p),f(p)) = d_X(p,p)$, which is $\\|f(p)-f(p)\\| = 0$. This is always true.\nSo any function from $X=\\{p\\}$ to $B=\\{0\\}$ is an isometric embedding. There is only one such function, which maps $p$ to $0$.\nSo for $X=\\{p\\}$ and $B=\\{0\\}$, the number of isometric embeddings is 1.\n\nLet's explore if this trivial case might be implicitly excluded.\n- \"finite ultrametric space\": This can definitely be a 1-point space.\n- \"Banach space of cardinality K\": This could imply K is some given, unspecified cardinal.\nBut the question is \"What is the smallest possible number...\". This asks for a concrete number, not an expression depending on $K$. To get a concrete number, I can choose the ultrametric space $X$ and the Banach space $B$ (and thus its cardinality $K$) to minimize the number of embeddings.\n\nSo, I choose $B$ to be the trivial Banach space $\\{0\\}$. Its cardinality is $K=1$.\nThen I need to find a finite ultrametric space $X$ that can be isometrically embedded in $B$.\nAs reasoned before, for an embedding $f:X \\to \\{0\\}$, we must have $d(f(x), f(y)) = \\|0-0\\|=0$ for all $x,y \\in X$. For this to be an isometry, we need $d_X(x,y)=0$ for all $x,y \\in X$. In a metric space, this means $x=y$ for all $x,y$. So $X$ can have at most one point.\nLet's choose $X$ to be a one-point space, $X=\\{p\\}$.\nNow let's count the number of isometric embeddings of $X=\\{p\\}$ into $B=\\{0\\}$.\nAn embedding is a function $f:\\{p\\} \\to \\{0\\}$. There is only one such function. So the number is 1.\n\nThis seems a valid answer unless there is a hidden constraint like \"non-trivial Banach space\" or \"$|X| \\ge 2$\". Without such constraints, the logic holds.\n\nWhat if $B$ must be non-trivial?\nLet $B=\\mathbb{R}$, $K=\\mathfrak{c}$.\nLet $X$ be the 1-point space $\\{p\\}$. The number of isometric embeddings is the number of maps from $\\{p\\}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, which is $|\\mathbb{R}| = \\mathfrak{c}$.\nLet $X=\\{p,q\\}$, $d(p,q)=1$. We need to find functions $f:X \\to B$ such that $\\|f(p)-f(q)\\|=1$. The set of such functions is non-empty for any non-trivial Banach space $B$. For any $b \\in B$ and any $u \\in B$ with $\\|u\\|=1$, we can define an embedding $f(p)=b, f(q)=b+u$. Since $B$ is non-trivial, a vector $u$ with norm 1 exists. So for each $b \\in B$ and each $u \\in S_B(1)$, we get an embedding. The number of such embeddings is at least $K \\cdot |S_B(1)|$. In any real Banach space of dimension $\\ge 1$, the unit sphere $S_B(1)$ has at least 2 points (if dim=1) or is infinite. So the number of embeddings is at least $2K$, or infinite.\n\nSo if we must use a non-trivial Banach space, the number of embeddings seems to be infinite. This doesn't seem to be a good candidate for a \"smallest possible number\". The only way to get a finite number is to restrict the possibilities.\n\nMaybe the question means \"up to an isometry of the Banach space\"?\n\"What is the smallest possible number of *orbits* of isometric embeddings under the isometry group of B?\"\nBut the question does not state this. It's about the number of embedding *functions*.\n\nThe possibility of 1 seems most robust provided trivial spaces are allowed. What if the context implies \"non-degenerate\" ultrametric space, i.e., one with more than one point?\nLet $|X| \\ge 2$. $d(x,y) > 0$ for some $x,y$.\nThen $B$ must be non-trivial. Cardinality $K$ is infinite.\nNumber of embeddings is infinite.\nThis line of reasoning does not lead to a finite number.\n\nWhat if \"Banach space of cardinality K\" implies that $K$ is a finite cardinal? This happens if the underlying field is finite. The theory of Banach spaces is typically over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$. Some generalizations exist, but it would be a strange context. Assuming the standard definition, a finite Banach space is trivial ({0}).\n\nCould there be a specific $(X, B)$ combination that results in a finite, non-one number of embeddings, for instance, in a space $B$ with a finite number of isometries? James's space is a known \"strange\" Banach space, but its number of isometries is still infinite. It seems unlikely that there is any non-trivial Banach space with a finite isometry group. Even for $B = \\mathbb{R}$, isometries are $T(x) = x+b$ and $T(x) = -x+b$.\nLet's reconsider $X=\\{x_0, x_1\\}$ with $d(x_0,x_1)=c$ and $B=\\mathbb{R}$.\nAn embedding $f$ is determined by the two points $y_0 = f(x_0)$ and $y_1=f(x_1)$. We need $|y_0-y_1|=c$.\nThe set of embeddings is $\\{(y_0, y_1) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid |y_0-y_1|=c\\}$. This is an infinite set. It corresponds to the two lines $y_1 = y_0+c$ and $y_1=y_0-c$.\n\nThe only interpretation that yields a single integer is that we are allowed to choose $X$ and $B$.\nThe question is \"What is the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings...\". This asks for $\\min_{X, B} |\\text{Emb}(X,B)|$ where $X$ is a finite ultrametric space and $B$ is a Banach space.\n\nLet's list the possibilities for this number $N = |\\text{Emb}(X,B)|$:\n- Can $N=0$? No, the Kuratowski embedding ensures that for any $X$, there exists a $B$ such that $\\text{Emb}(X,B)$ is non-empty. So $N \\ge 1$.\n- Can $N=1$? Yes, as shown with $X=\\{p\\}$ and $B=\\{0\\}$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value is 1.\n\nLet's double check if there are any subtleties I might be missing. The problem seems simple, which can be a red flag. The keywords are:\n- *finite* ultrametric space: The finiteness of X is important.\n- *Banach space of cardinality K*: This might be a red herring if I can choose the Banach space. The fact that $K$ is mentioned could suggest that for a *given* $K$, what is the smallest number? But it does not say that. It asks for \"the\" smallest possible number, suggesting an absolute minimum.\n- *isometric embeddings*: The definition is clear.\n\nWhat if the ultrametric space $X$ must be non-trivial, i.e., have at least two points?\nLet $|X| \\ge 2$. Then there exist $x_1, x_2 \\in X$ with $d(x_1, x_2) = c > 0$.\nAn isometric embedding $f$ must satisfy $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = c$. This forces the Banach space $B$ to be non-trivial, so its cardinality $K$ is infinite.\nLet $f$ be one such embedding. Then for any vector $b_0 \\in B$, the translated map $g(x) = f(x) + b_0$ is also an isometric embedding. Since there are $K$ choices for $b_0$, there are at least $K$ isometric embeddings.\nAs $K$ must be infinite (e.g. $\\mathfrak{c}$ or larger), the number of embeddings would be infinite. In this case, there is no \"smallest possible number\" in the sense of a finite integer, unless we are talking about cardinal numbers. If the answer could be a cardinal, the smallest possible infinite cardinal is $\\aleph_0$. Can we find a Banach space $B$ with cardinality $\\aleph_0$? A Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$. If it's not $\\{0\\}$, it contains a copy of $\\mathbb{R}$, so its cardinality is at least $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. A Banach space over $\\mathbb{Q}$ can be countable, but the definition of a Banach space requires completeness, which leads to a space over $\\mathbb{R}$. So a non-trivial Banach space must have cardinality at least $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nSo if $|X| \\ge 2$, the smallest number of embeddings is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$.\nDoes this make sense? \"What is the smallest possible number...\" with answer \"the cardinality of the continuum\"? Seems unlikely for this type of question.\n\nThis strengthens my belief that the trivial case is the intended one. The possibility of an infinite answer is usually avoided in such competition-style problems unless cardinals are explicitly mentioned.\n\nLet's carefully analyze the phrasing again: \"Let $X$ be a finite ultrametric space and $B$ a Banach space of cardinality $K$. What is the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of $X$ in $B$?\"\nThe number depends on $X$ and $B$. Let's call it $N(X, B)$. The question asks for $\\min_{X,B} N(X,B)$.\n- $X$ can be any finite ultrametric space.\n- $B$ can be any Banach space.\n\nWe have established:\n1. $N(X,B) \\ge 1$ is always possible by choosing an appropriate $B$ for any given $X$. Specifically, for $X$, let $B=\\ell_{\\infty}(X)$. Then an embedding exists.\n2. Consider $B_0 = \\{0\\}$, the trivial Banach space. It has cardinality $K=1$. For an embedding $f:X \\to B_0$ to exist, we need $d(f(x), f(y))=0$ for all $x,y$, which implies $d(x,y)=0$ for all $x,y$. This is only true if $|X|\\le 1$.\n3. Let's pick a valid $X$ and $B$. Let $X_1 = \\{p\\}$ be a one-point space. This is a finite ultrametric space. Let $B_0=\\{0\\}$. This is a Banach space of cardinality $K=1$. The number of isometric embeddings $N(X_1, B_0)$ is the number of functions from $\\{p\\}$ to $\\{0\\}$, which is 1.\n\nSo we have found a pair $(X,B)$ for which the number is 1. Since we know the number must be at least 1 (if any embedding exists for the chosen pair), this must be the minimum. We know an embedding does not *always* exist for an *arbitrary* pair $(X,B)$. For example $X=\\{p,q\\}, d(p,q)=1$ cannot be embedded into $B=\\{0\\}$. But the question asks for the smallest possible number, which means we can select the pair. For $(X,B) = (\\{p,q\\}, \\{0\\})$, the set of embeddings is empty, so the number is 0.\n\nOh, so the number can be 0. Let's check my logic.\nIs it possible that for some $X$, there is NO Banach space $B$ it can be embedded into? No, the Kuratowski embedding into $\\ell^\\infty(X)$ always works.\nSo for any given $X$, there is a $B$ such that $N(X,B) > 0$.\nBut the question fixes both $X$ and $B$ first, and then asks for the number of embeddings. And we want to find the minimum of these numbers over all possible choices of $X$ and $B$.\nLet's analyze $N(X,B)$.\nIf $X=\\{x_1, x_2\\}$ with $d(x_1, x_2)=1$, and $B=\\{0\\}$, then there are no functions $f$ satisfying $\\|f(x_1)-f(x_2)\\|=1$. So $N(X,B) = 0$.\n\nSo the set of possible numbers of embeddings is $\\{0, 1, \\dots, \\infty\\}$. The smallest element in this set is 0.\nExample:\nLet $X$ be the finite ultrametric space with two points $\\{x_1, x_2\\}$ and the discrete metric $d(x_1, x_2)=1$.\nLet $B$ be the Banach space $\\{0\\}$. The cardinality of $B$ is $K=1$.\nAn isometric embedding is a function $f:X \\to B$ such that for all $a,b \\in X$, $\\|f(a)-f(b)\\| = d(a,b)$.\nLet's check for $a=x_1, b=x_2$. We need $\\|f(x_1)-f(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2) = 1$.\nBut since the only element in $B$ is $0$, we must have $f(x_1)=0$ and $f(x_2)=0$.\nSo $\\|f(x_1)-f(x_2)\\| = \\|0-0\\|=0$.\nWe need $0=1$, which is a contradiction.\nSo there is no isometric embedding of this $X$ into this $B$. The number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n\nThe question \"What is the smallest possible number...\" means what is $\\min \\{|Emb(X,B)| : X \\text{ is a finite ultrametric space, } B \\text{ is a Banach space}\\}$.\nSince I have found an example where $|Emb(X,B)| = 0$, and the number cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\nThis seems almost too simple, relying on a \"mismatch\" between the space and the target space. But the question is phrased very generally. It doesn't say \"for a given X, what is the minimum number of embeddings into a suitable B?\". It allows choosing both.\n\nLet's try to argue against 0, just to be sure.\nMaybe there's a theorem that says that any finite ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded into *any* Banach space $B$ as long as $B$ is \"large enough\"?\nThe paper says \"for any finite ultrametric space M and any infinite-dimensional Banach space B there exists an isometric embedding of M into B.\"\nSo if we restrict $B$ to be infinite-dimensional, the number of embeddings is greater than 0. In this case, as we argued, the number of embeddings is infinite. \"Smallest possible number\" would be a cardinal, $\\mathfrak{c}$. This sounds weird.\n\nWhat if $B$ is finite-dimensional but non-trivial, like $\\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \\ge 1$?\nLet $X$ be a finite ultrametric space. Can it always be embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^n$? Not necessarily with the standard Euclidean norm $l_2$. Can it be embedded in $(\\mathbb{R}^n, \\|\\cdot\\|)$ for some norm? Yes. A theorem by S.A. Shkarin (2004, referenced in) states that any finite ultrametric space of cardinality $n+1$ can be isometrically embedded into some $n$-dimensional Banach space. And in general any finite ultrametric space can be embedded in $\\ell^\\infty_n$ for some $n$.\nSpecifically, any metric space with $n$ points can be isometrically embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ with the sup norm ($\\ell_\\infty^{n-1}$). This is a finite-dimensional Banach space.\nSo for any $X$, we *can* find a $B$ where an embedding exists.\nBut the question lets me choose $X$ and $B$ freely, and asks for the minimum number of embeddings.\nSo I am free to choose a pair $(X,B)$ for which an embedding does not exist.\nThe reasoning seems sound. Let's write down the final argument.\n\n1.  Let $N(X,B)$ be the number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$.\n2.  The question is to find $\\min_{X,B} N(X,B)$.\n3.  The number of embeddings must be a non-negative integer. So $N(X,B) \\ge 0$.\n4.  To show that the minimum is 0, we need to find a specific pair $(X,B)$ for which $N(X,B)=0$.\n5.  Let $X = \\{a, b\\}$ be a two-point space with the ultrametric given by $d(a,a)=0$, $d(b,b)=0$, $d(a,b)=d(b,a)=1$. (This is the discrete metric on two points, which is an ultrametric). $X$ is a finite ultrametric space.\n6.  Let $B = \\{0\\}$ be the trivial vector space with the norm $\\|0\\|=0$. This is a Banach space. Its cardinality is $K=1$.\n7.  Let's count the number of isometric embeddings from $X$ to $B$. An embedding is a function $f:X \\to B$. As $B=\\{0\\}$, the only such function is $f(a)=0$ and $f(b)=0$.\n8.  For this function to be an isometric embedding, the condition $\\|f(x)-f(y)\\| = d(x,y)$ must hold for all $x,y \\in X$.\n9.  Let's check this for $x=a$ and $y=b$. We require $\\|f(a)-f(b)\\| = d(a,b)$.\n10. The left side is $\\|0-0\\| = 0$. The right side is $d(a,b)=1$.\n11. The condition becomes $0=1$, which is false.\n12. Therefore, this function is not an isometric embedding. Since it's the only possible function, there are no isometric embeddings for this pair $(X,B)$.\n13. Thus, $N(X,B) = 0$.\n14. Since $N(X,B) \\ge 0$ for any pair, the minimum possible value is 0.\n\nThis logic seems completely sound. The mention of cardinality K is just a property of the Banach space B, it doesn't seem to constrain the problem in a way that avoids the answer 0. The fact that $X$ is an *ultrametric* space is also not even used, the argument works for any metric space. This might be another red flag, but a general result holding for a specific case is not a problem. The ultrametric property might be relevant if the answer was not 0. For instance, if embeddings always existed, the geometry of ultrametric spaces would be key to count the minimum number of them. But since they don't have to exist, that geometry doesn't play a role in finding the minimum value.\n\nI feel confident in this answer.An isometric embedding of a metric space $(X, d_X)$ into a normed space $(B, \\|\\cdot\\|)$ is a function $f: X \\to B$ such that for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, we have $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d_X(x_1, x_2)$. The question asks for the smallest possible number of such embeddings for a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$.\n\nThe number of isometric embeddings is a non-negative integer. To find the smallest possible value, we can search for a specific choice of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ for which this number is minimized.\n\nConsider the following case:\n*   Let $X$ be a finite ultrametric space consisting of two distinct points, say $X = \\{a, b\\}$. The ultrametric on $X$ is defined by $d(a, a) = 0$, $d(b, b) = 0$, and $d(a, b) = d(b, a) = 1$. Any metric space with two points is an ultrametric space.\n*   Let $B$ be the trivial Banach space containing only the zero vector, i.e., $B = \\{0\\}$. The norm is defined as $\\|0\\| = 0$. The cardinality of this space is $K=1$.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of isometric embeddings from this space $X$ into this space $B$.\n\nAn embedding must be a function $f: X \\to B$. Since $B = \\{0\\}$, the only possible function is the one that maps every element of $X$ to the zero vector:\n$f(a) = 0$\n$f(b) = 0$\n\nFor this function $f$ to be an isometric embedding, it must satisfy the condition $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2)$ for all pairs of points in $X$. Let's check this condition for the pair of points $a$ and $b$:\n*   The distance in the metric space $X$ is $d(a, b) = 1$.\n*   The distance in the Banach space $B$ between their images is $\\|f(a) - f(b)\\| = \\|0 - 0\\| = 0$.\n\nThe condition for an isometric embedding would require that $0 = 1$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the function $f$ is not an isometric embedding. As this is the only possible function from $X$ to $B$, no isometric embeddings exist for this particular choice of $X$ and $B$.\n\nThe number of isometric embeddings in this case is 0. Since the number of embeddings cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
