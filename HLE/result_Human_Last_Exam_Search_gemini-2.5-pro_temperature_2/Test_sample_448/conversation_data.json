    "**Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002.** This conclusion is based on its extremely low abundance in the Earth's crust and its very short half-life, which prevents it from accumulating in any significant quantity.\n\nThe abundance of noble gases, a group of largely inert elements, varies considerably within Earth's different reservoirs, including the atmosphere, crust, mantle, and oceans. While in the atmosphere xenon is the rarest of the stable noble gases, a look at the entire planet reveals radon to be significantly scarcer.\n\nRadon is a radioactive gas with its most stable isotope, radon-222, having a half-life of only 3.8 days. It is continuously formed by the radioactive decay of uranium, which is found in trace amounts throughout the Earth's crust. However, due to its rapid decay, its concentration remains exceptionally low. The abundance of radon in the Earth's crust is estimated to be around 4 x 10<sup>-13</sup> milligrams per kilogram, which is equivalent to 4 x 10<sup>-10</sup> parts per million (ppm).\n\nFor comparison, xenon, the rarest of the stable (non-radioactive) noble gases, has a significantly higher abundance. In the Earth's crust, xenon's abundance is approximately 0.00009 ppm. In the atmosphere, xenon is present at about 0.087 parts per million.\n\nThe other noble gases are considerably more abundant. Argon is the most plentiful in the atmosphere at about 0.934%, largely due to the radioactive decay of potassium-40 in the Earth's crust. Neon, helium, and krypton follow in terms of atmospheric abundance.\n\nAlthough precise figures for the year 2002 are not specifically available, the natural abundances of these elements are the result of long-term geological and atmospheric processes, and therefore, do not change significantly from year to year.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
