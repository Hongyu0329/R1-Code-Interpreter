As the local median function is iteratively applied to a binary image, the edges will be smoothed, sharp corners will be rounded, and small details may be eliminated. The image will converge to a "root" signal, which is a simplified version of the original image composed of shapes that are invariant to the median filter. This process effectively removes high-frequency information from the boundaries of the shapes in the image.
