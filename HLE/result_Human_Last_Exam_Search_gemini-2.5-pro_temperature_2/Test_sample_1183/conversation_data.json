    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is a triethynyl-substituted triangulene. Triangulene itself is a planar molecule with a high degree of symmetry.\n\nThe parent triangulene molecule possesses D3h symmetry. The SMILES string indicates that three ethynyl groups are attached to the triangulene core at the 2, 7, and 12 positions, maintaining the threefold rotational symmetry of the parent molecule. The ethynyl groups are linear and will lie in the plane of the aromatic system. Therefore, the substitution does not lower the overall symmetry of the molecule.\n\nThe symmetry elements of a molecule with D3h symmetry include:\n*   A principal C3 axis of rotation perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n*   Three C2 axes of rotation in the molecular plane.\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) coincident with the molecular plane.\n*   Three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n*   An S3 improper rotation axis.\n\nThe triethynyl-substituted triangulene retains all of these symmetry elements. The substitutions at the specified positions do not break the C3 rotational symmetry or the mirror planes. Therefore, the symmetry group of the molecule is D3h.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
