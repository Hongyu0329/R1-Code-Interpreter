The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is not a number, but rather a set of defining rules known as the Berezin integral rules. For a single Grassmann variable θ, the rules are ∫ dθ = 0 and ∫ dθ θ = 1. These rules are a direct consequence of the anti-commuting nature of Grassmann variables (θᵢθⱼ = -θⱼθᵢ), which leads to θ² = 0, the mathematical representation of the Pauli exclusion principle.
