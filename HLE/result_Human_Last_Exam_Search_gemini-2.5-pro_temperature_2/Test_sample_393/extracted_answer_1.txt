Let the given partition of \(n\) be \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_r\), where \(\sum_{i=1}^r a_i = n\). Let \(m_1, m_2, \dots, m_s\) be the distinct values in the set \(\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_r\}\), and let \(k_j\) be the number of times \(m_j\) appears in this set, for \(j=1, \dots, s\). The number of Tverberg partitions of the set \(X\) is given by the formula:
$$ \frac{n!}{(a_1! a_2! \dots a_r!)(k_1! k_2! \dots k_s!)} $$
