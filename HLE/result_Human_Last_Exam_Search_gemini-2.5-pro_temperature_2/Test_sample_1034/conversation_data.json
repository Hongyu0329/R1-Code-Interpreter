    "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the conditions under which there are two possible values for side length $AB$. Then, we will decipher the value of $S$ from the given information and calculate the final answer.\n\n### The Ambiguous Case of the Law of Sines\n\nIn triangle $ABC$, we are given side $BC$, side $AC$, and angle $B$. This is the Side-Side-Angle (SSA) case. The number of possible triangles depends on the relationship between these given parts. Let $a = BC = S$, $b = AC$, and $\\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$.\n\nAccording to the Law of Sines:\n$\\frac{\\sin A}{a} = \\frac{\\sin B}{b}$\n$\\sin A = \\frac{a \\sin B}{b} = \\frac{S \\sin 30^{\\circ}}{AC} = \\frac{S}{2 \\cdot AC}$\n\nFor there to be two possible triangles, and thus two possible lengths for side $AB$, two conditions must be met:\n1.  There must be two possible solutions for angle $A$. This occurs when $0 < \\sin A < 1$.\n    *   $0 < \\frac{S}{2 \\cdot AC} < 1$\n    *   Since $S$ and $AC$ are side lengths, they are positive, so the left side of the inequality is always true.\n    *   For the right side: $\\frac{S}{2 \\cdot AC} < 1$, which implies $S < 2 \\cdot AC$, or $AC > \\frac{S}{2}$.\n\n2.  Both possible angles for $A$ (an acute angle $A_1$ and an obtuse angle $A_2 = 180^\\circ - A_1$) must result in a valid triangle. For the second triangle with angle $A_2$ to be valid, the sum of its angles must be less than $180^\\circ$.\n    *   $A_2 + B < 180^\\circ$\n    *   $(180^\\circ - A_1) + 30^\\circ < 180^\\circ$\n    *   This simplifies to $A_1 > 30^\\circ$.\n    *   Since $A_1$ is an acute angle, this means $\\sin A_1 > \\sin 30^\\circ$.\n    *   $\\frac{S}{2 \\cdot AC} > \\frac{1}{2}$, which implies $S > AC$.\n\nCombining these two conditions, for two possible values of side $AB$ to exist, the length of side $AC$ must be in the range $\\frac{S}{2} < AC < S$.\n\n### Determining the Value of S\n\nThe problem states, \"Let $S=S N Y W R$\". This is interpreted as a puzzle where the value of S is the sum of the alphabetical positions of the letters (A=1, B=2, C=3, ...).\n\n*   S = 19\n*   N = 14\n*   Y = 25\n*   W = 23\n*   R = 18\n\nAdding these values together:\n$S = 19 + 14 + 25 + 23 + 18 = 99$.\n\n### Calculating the Number of Integer Values\n\nNow we substitute $S=99$ into the inequality derived for $AC$:\n$\\frac{99}{2} < AC < 99$\n$49.5 < AC < 99$\n\nWe need to find the number of integer values for $AC$ that satisfy this condition. The possible integer values for $AC$ are $50, 51, 52, \\dots, 98$.\n\nTo count the number of integers in this range, we can use the formula: Last - First + 1.\nNumber of values = $98 - 50 + 1 = 49$.\n\nTherefore, there are 49 possible integer values for the side length $AC$.\n\n<<<49>>>"
