    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in five distinct colors. These are:\n\n*   **White:** This allotrope is a translucent, waxy solid.\n*   **Yellow:** White phosphorus can appear yellow due to impurities or exposure to light.\n*   **Red:** This common allotrope has a deep red or reddish-violet color.\n*   **Violet:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this is a distinct crystalline form with a violet hue.\n*   **Black:** The most thermodynamically stable form, black phosphorus is flaky and has a black, graphite-like appearance.\n\nIn addition to these, **blue phosphorus** has been synthesized, primarily as a two-dimensional material, and is of interest in materials science.\n\n<<<5>>>"
