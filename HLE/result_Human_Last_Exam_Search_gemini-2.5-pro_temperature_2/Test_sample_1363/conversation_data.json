    "The possibility of overturning a reverse turn depends on the foundational technique of the dance. In the swing dances—Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep—the technique not only allows for but often encourages variations in the degree of turn through the use of body swing, sway, and contra-body movement (CBM). In contrast, the European Tango's technique is fundamentally different, making an overturned reverse turn a contradiction to its core principles.\n\nThe European Tango is characterized by a staccato action, a compact hold, and a distinct lack of the body swing, rise, and fall that define the other Standard dances. Turns in Tango are sharp and executed with a swiveling or pivoting action, primarily from the feet and legs, while the upper body aims to remain stable. Attempting to create a continuous, flowing, and overturned rotation, as one would in a Waltz, would require introducing body swing, which is a direct violation of Tango technique. The turn in a Tango Reverse Turn is specific and controlled, not a continuous rotation that can be easily extended.\n\nIn dances like the Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep, overturning is a common practice used to change direction or create choreographic variety. For instance, a dancer in Quickstep might overturn a chasse to change alignment, and a Foxtrot dancer can overturn an outside spin. The technique of these \"swing\" dances is built on generating and managing momentum through body rotation, which makes varying the amount of turn a natural part of the dance. The Viennese Waltz even notes that a Reverse Turn might need to be overturned to navigate a corner, while a Natural Turn would be under-turned.\n\nTherefore, due to its fundamental principles of no body swing and staccato movement, it is in the European Tango that overturning a reverse turn is impossible without disregarding the dance's essential technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
