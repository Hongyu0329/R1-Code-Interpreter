    "An analysis of the user's question is as follows:\nThe user wants to find the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The question asks for a specific \"continued fraction\". This continued fraction is associated with a mathematical object called a \"generalized Markov number\", which is specified by the rational number \\( 4/7 \\). This suggests that there is a defined procedure to get from the rational number \\( p/q \\) to a specific continued fraction.\n\n2.  **Identify the relevant mathematical concept:** The theory of Markov numbers connects Diophantine approximation, quadratic forms, and continued fractions. The classical Markov numbers are a discrete set of integers \\(1, 2, 5, 13, \\dots\\). The theory was generalized by mathematicians like L. G. Aigner and David Rosen to associate values not just with integers, but with any rational number \\( p/q \\). A key part of this generalization is the construction of a special quadratic irrational number, whose continued fraction is built from the continued fraction of \\( p/q \\). This is the \"continued fraction associated with \\( m_{p/q} \\)\".\n\n3.  **State the Construction Method:** The most standard method, due to David Rosen, is as follows:\n    a.  First, find the simple continued fraction of the rational number \\( p/q \\). Let's say for \\( 0 < p < q \\), it is \\( p/q = [0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n] \\). The sequence of coefficients is \\( W = (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\).\n    b.  Create the reversed sequence \\( W^R = (a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_1) \\).\n    c.  Construct a new sequence of integers by concatenating \\( W \\) and \\( W^R \\). Let this be the periodic block \\( B = (W, W^R) = (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n, a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_1) \\).\n    d.  The continued fraction associated with \\( m_{p/q} \\) is the continued fraction of the quadratic irrational number \\( \\alpha_{p/q} = [0; \\overline{B}] = [0; \\overline{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n, a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_1}] \\).\n\n4.  **Apply the method to the specific case \\( p/q = 4/7 \\):**\n    a.  **Find the continued fraction of 4/7.** We use the Euclidean algorithm:\n        -   \\( \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{7/4} = \\frac{1}{1 + 3/4} \\)\n        -   \\( \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4/3} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1/3} \\)\n        -   \\( \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n        Combining these, we get \\( \\frac{4}{7} = [0; 1, 1, 3] \\).\n    b.  **Identify the coefficient sequence W.** From the continued fraction, the sequence of coefficients is \\( W = (1, 1, 3) \\).\n    c.  **Find the reversed sequence \\(W^R\\).** Reversing the sequence \\( W \\) gives \\( W^R = (3, 1, 1) \\).\n    d.  **Construct the periodic block B.** Concatenating \\( W \\) and \\( W^R \\) gives the periodic part of the target continued fraction:\n        \\( B = (W, W^R) = (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1) \\).\n    e.  **Write the final continued fraction.** The associated continued fraction is purely periodic with the block B.\n        Therefore, the continued fraction is \\( [0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}] \\).\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   The term \"generalized Markov number\" can have slightly different definitions in various mathematical contexts. However, the Rosen construction of an associated quadratic irrational (and its continued fraction) is standard in this field.\n*   The calculation of the continued fraction for \\( 4/7 \\) must be accurate. A mistake here would alter the entire result. The calculation \\( 4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3] \\) is correct.\n*   The construction of the periodic block requires careful concatenation of the forward sequence \\( W \\) and the reversed sequence \\( W^R \\), in that specific order.\n\nBy following this well-established procedure, we arrive at the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is the continued fraction computed in the last step of the analysis.\n\n<<<[0; \\(\\overline{1,1,3,3,1,1}\\)]>>>"
