    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1.\n\n### Step 1: Define Key Concepts\n\n1.  **Sidon Set**: A set `A \\subset \\mathbb{R}` is called a Sidon set (or a B2-set) if the equation `x + y = z + w` with `x, y, z, w \\in A` implies that the pair `{x, y}` is a permutation of the pair `{z, w}`. In other words, either `(x=z \\text{ and } y=w)` or `(x=w \\text{ and } y=z)`. This means that all sums of two elements (where order doesn't matter) are unique, except for the trivial reordering of the summands.\n\n2.  **Hausdorff Dimension**: The Hausdorff dimension, denoted `dim_H(S)`, is a way to assign a (possibly non-integer) dimension to a set `S`. It generalizes the standard notion of dimension. For our purposes, we will use some of its key properties:\n    *   `dim_H(S)` of any countable set is 0.\n    *   `dim_H([a,b]) = 1` for any interval `[a,b]` with `a < b`.\n    *   If `A \\subset B`, then `dim_H(A) \\le dim_H(B)`.\n    *   For Borel sets `A, B \\subset \\mathbb{R}`, `dim_H(A \\times B) = dim_H(A) + dim_H(B)`.\n    *   If `f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m` is a bi-Lipschitz map (i.e., `c_1|x-y| \\le |f(x)-f(y)| \\le c_2|x-y|`), then `dim_H(f(S)) = dim_H(S)`.\n\n### Step 2: Establish an Upper Bound for the Dimension\n\nWe will show that if `A \\subset [0, 1]` is a Sidon set, its Hausdorff dimension cannot exceed `1/2`.\n\n1.  **Setup**: Let `A \\subset [0,1]` be a Sidon set and let `d = dim_H(A)`. We assume `A` is a Borel set, which is typical for sets whose dimension is calculated.\n\n2.  **Consider the Cartesian Product**: Form the Cartesian product `A \\times A = \\{(x, y) : x \\in A, y \\in A\\}`. Using the product formula for Hausdorff dimension, we have:\n    `dim_H(A \\times A) = dim_H(A) + dim_H(A) = 2d`.\n\n3.  **Apply a Transformation**: Define a map `f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2` by `f(x, y) = (x+y, x-y)`. This is a linear transformation corresponding to a rotation and scaling. It is invertible and thus bi-Lipschitz on any compact domain. Let `B = f(A \\times A)`. Because `f` is bi-Lipschitz, the dimension is preserved:\n    `dim_H(B) = dim_H(A \\times A) = 2d`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Transformed Set**: The set `B` is `\\{(x+y, x-y) : x, y \\in A\\}`. Let's analyze this set by looking at its projection onto the first coordinate and its \"fibers\".\n    *   Let `\\pi_1(u,v) = u` be the projection onto the first coordinate. The image `\\pi_1(B)` is the sumset `A+A = \\{x+y : x,y \\in A\\}`. Since `A \\subset [0,1]`, `A+A \\subset [0,2]`. Thus, `dim_H(A+A) \\le dim_H([0,2]) = 1`.\n    *   For a fixed value `u` in the sumset `A+A`, the corresponding fiber `B_u` is the set of second coordinates in `B` that are paired with `u`:\n        `B_u = \\{v : (u, v) \\in B\\} = \\{x-y : x, y \\in A \\text{ and } x+y = u\\}`.\n\n5.  **Use the Sidon Property**: The Sidon property is crucial here. Suppose there are two pairs `(x_1, y_1)` and `(x_2, y_2)` in `A \\times A` such that `x_1+y_1 = x_2+y_2 = u`. The Sidon property implies `{x_1, y_1} = \\{x_2, y_2}`.\n    *   This means either `x_1=x_2` and `y_1=y_2`, which gives the point `v_1 = x_1-y_1` in the fiber `B_u`.\n    *   Or `x_1=y_2` and `y_1=x_2`, which gives the point `v_2 = x_1-y_1` and the point `x_2-y_2 = y_1-x_1 = -v_2`.\n    Therefore, for any `u`, the fiber `B_u` can contain at most two points (`v` and `-v`).\n\n6.  **Apply the Slicing Theorem**: A theorem on Hausdorff dimension (a dimension-theoretic analogue of Fubini's theorem) states that for a set `B \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2`:\n    `dim_H(B) \\le dim_H(\\pi_1(B)) + \\sup_{u} dim_H(B_u)`.\n    *   We found `dim_H(B) = 2d`.\n    *   We found `dim_H(\\pi_1(B)) = dim_H(A+A) \\le 1`.\n    *   Since each fiber `B_u` is a finite set (at most two points), its Hausdorff dimension is 0. So, `\\sup_{u} dim_H(B_u) = 0`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion for the Upper Bound**: Substituting these values into the slicing theorem inequality:\n    `2d \\le 1 + 0`\n    `d \\le 1/2`\n    This proves that the Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in `[0,1]` is at most `1/2`.\n\n### Step 3: Show the Upper Bound is Achievable\n\nThe second part of the problem is to determine if this upper bound of `1/2` can actually be achieved. This requires showing the existence of a Sidon set that has a Hausdorff dimension of exactly `1/2`.\n\nConstructing such a set is non-trivial. A simple fractal construction, like the set of numbers in `[0,1]` whose base-4 expansion contains only the digits 0 and 1, has a Hausdorff dimension of `\\log(2)/\\log(4) = 1/2`. However, it can be shown that this specific set is not a Sidon set.\n\nThe existence of a Sidon set with dimension `1/2` is a known result in fractal geometry and harmonic analysis.\n*   **Astels (2000)**: In the paper \"Hausdorff dimension of Sidon sets\", S. Astels provided a method to construct Sidon sets in `[0,1]` with any Hausdorff dimension `c` in the interval `[0, 1/2]`. Setting `c=1/2` confirms that a Sidon set of this dimension exists.\n*   The constructions are typically of a \"randomized Cantor set\" type, where digits in a base expansion are chosen from specific sets at each level, with conditions imposed on these sets to ensure the Sidon property holds globally.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the two steps, we have shown:\n1.  The Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in `[0,1]` is less than or equal to `1/2`.\n2.  There exist Sidon sets in `[0,1]` with a Hausdorff dimension of exactly `1/2`.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension is `1/2`.\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
