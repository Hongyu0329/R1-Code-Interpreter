    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the conductor $d$\nFirst, we factorize the given conductor $d = 53599$ into its prime factors.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $d$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n    \\item Trying division by 7: $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$.\n    \\item Trying to factor 7657: $\\sqrt{7657} \\approx 87.5$. We test small primes. $7657 = 13 \\times 589$.\n    \\item Trying to factor 589: $\\sqrt{589} \\approx 24.2$. We test small primes. $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\n\\end{itemize}\nSo, the prime factorization of $d$ is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nLet $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$.\n\n### Step 2: Properties of primitive characters for a square-free conductor\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely expressed as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$.\nFor a character $\\chi$ to be **primitive** with a square-free conductor $d=p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$, each component character $\\chi_i$ must be primitive modulo $p_i$.\nA character modulo a prime $p_i$ is primitive if and only if it is not the principal character, $\\chi_{0, p_i}$ (the character which maps all integers not divisible by $p_i$ to 1). The principal character is the only one with conductor 1; all others have conductor $p_i$.\nThus, we need to count the tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where each $\\chi_i$ is a non-principal character modulo $p_i$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the order of the character\nThe order of the character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))$.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\nLet $k_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$. We require:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $\\chi_i$ is non-principal, which means $k_i > 1$.\n    \\item $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThe condition $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$ implies that each $k_i$ must be a divisor of 6. Since $k_i > 1$, the possible orders for each $\\chi_i$ are $k_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n### Step 4: Count the relevant characters for each prime modulus\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ in this group is $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n\nLet's check the orders of the character groups for our primes:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Modulo $p_1=7$: The group has order $p_1-1 = 6$. The divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    \\item Modulo $p_2=13$: The group has order $p_2-1 = 12$. The divisors include 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    \\item Modulo $p_3=19$: The group has order $p_3-1 = 18$. The divisors include 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    \\item Modulo $p_4=31$: The group has order $p_4-1 = 30$. The divisors include 1, 2, 3, 6.\n\\end{itemize}\nFor each prime $p_i$, the orders $k \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ are valid divisors of $p_i-1$. Let's count the number of characters for each of these orders.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Number of characters of order 2: $N_2 = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    \\item Number of characters of order 3: $N_3 = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    \\item Number of characters of order 6: $N_6 = \\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\\end{itemize}\nSo, for each modulus $p_i$, we have $1+2+2=5$ characters with orders in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n### Step 5: Count the tuples of characters using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion\nWe need to count the tuples of non-principal characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ such that their orders $k_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$ satisfy $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4)=6$.\n\nLet $U$ be the set of tuples $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where each $\\chi_i$ is non-principal and its order $k_i$ divides 6. As calculated, there are 5 such characters for each modulus $p_i$. So, the total number of such tuples is:\n$|U| = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nFrom this set $U$, we must remove the tuples where the lcm of orders is a proper divisor of 6. The proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3. Since all characters are non-principal, their orders are greater than 1, so the lcm cannot be 1. We only need to subtract cases where the lcm divides 2 or 3.\n\nLet $S_2$ be the set of tuples in $U$ where the lcm of orders divides 2. This means each $k_i$ must divide 2. The only non-principal order dividing 2 is $k_i=2$.\nThe number of characters of order 2 for each modulus $p_i$ is $N_2 = \\phi(2) = 1$.\nSo, $|S_2| = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\nLet $S_3$ be the set of tuples in $U$ where the lcm of orders divides 3. This means each $k_i$ must divide 3. The only non-principal order dividing 3 is $k_i=3$.\nThe number of characters of order 3 for each modulus $p_i$ is $N_3 = \\phi(3) = 2$.\nSo, $|S_3| = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe set of tuples where the lcm divides both 2 and 3 is $S_2 \\cap S_3$. This means the lcm must divide $\\gcd(2, 3) = 1$. This implies all orders must be 1, but we are only considering non-principal characters. Thus, $|S_2 \\cap S_3| = 0$.\n\nThe number of tuples where the lcm is exactly 6 is given by the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion:\nNumber = $|U| - |S_2 \\cup S_3| = |U| - (|S_2| + |S_3| - |S_2 \\cap S_3|)$\nNumber = $625 - (1 + 16 - 0) = 625 - 17 = 608$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$ is 608.\n\n<<<608>>>"
