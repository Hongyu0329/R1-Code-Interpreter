    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the core components of the question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome (the square in front of the Pantheon).\n    *   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature\". This implies a man-made structure or element that defined the space.\n    *   **Action:** It was removed.\n    *   **Date:** Around 1950. This is a critical clue, as it rules out changes from other historical periods.\n\n2.  **Evaluate potential features of the Piazza and their history:**\n    *   **The Pantheon itself:** It has not been removed.\n    *   **The Fountain (Fontana del Pantheon):** This is the central feature of the square today, topped by an Egyptian obelisk. It was designed in 1575 and the obelisk was added in 1711. It has not been removed.\n    *   **The Pantheon's Bell Towers:** The Pantheon once had two bell towers, added in the 17th century and mockingly called \"the donkey's ears\" (*orecchie d'asino*). However, these were removed in 1883, which is too early to match the 1950 date.\n    *   **The Historical Market:** The piazza was home to a vibrant market for centuries. However, the market stalls and the general commerce were cleared away in the late 19th century (around 1873) to improve the \"decorum\" of the area around the newly unified Italy's royal tomb. This date is also incorrect.\n    *   **Transportation Infrastructure:** We must consider changes related to transportation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many European cities, including Rome, developed extensive electric tram networks.\n\n3.  **Focus on the 1950 timeframe:**\n    *   The period after World War II saw a major shift in urban planning across Europe. Cities began dismantling tram networks to prioritize private cars and buses, which were seen as more modern.\n    *   Historical research and photographs of the Piazza della Rotonda from the early 20th century show a very specific feature: tram tracks.\n    *   Uniquely, the tram line did not just pass by the square; it formed a complete ring or loop (*anello tranviario* in Italian) around the central fountain and obelisk. Trams would circle the monument as part of their route.\n\n4.  **Confirm the removal:**\n    *   This tram ring was a very characteristic feature of the piazza for several decades. However, as part of the post-war modernization and in preparation for events like the 1960 Olympics, the city administration of Rome removed many tram lines from the congested historical center.\n    *   The tram ring in Piazza della Rotonda was decommissioned and the tracks were paved over during this period (late 1940s - early 1950s), fitting the question's timeframe of 1950. This removal fundamentally changed the circulation and visual character of the square.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Definition of \"Architectural Feature\":** While a tram line is infrastructure, its integration into the piazza as a full circle around the central monument made it a defining design and spatial element, thus it can be considered a feature of the square's architecture in a broader sense.\n*   **Accuracy of the Date:** The year 1950 is representative of the period when these changes occurred. The actual removal of the tracks may have happened over several months or in a slightly different year (e.g., 1948 or 1951), but 1950 correctly places the event in the post-WWII era of tramway dismantling.\n*   **Eliminating other possibilities:** Ruling out other famous alterations to the area (market removal, bell tower demolition) based on their incorrect timelines is crucial to arriving at the right answer.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nThe unique feature that circled the fountain in the Piazza della Rotonda and was removed around 1950 was the tram ring.\n\n<<<A tram ring that circled the central fountain.>>>"
