    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the \"Second Great War\"**\nThe term \"Second Great War\" is a fan-accepted name for the series of conflicts that take place during the *StarCraft II* trilogy. It primarily involves the Terran Dominion, the Zerg Swarm, the Protoss factions, and the ultimate threat of Amon and his hybrids. The war spans three main campaigns: *Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*, including its epilogue.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Start Date of the War**\nThe war begins at the start of the *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* campaign. According to the official StarCraft timeline, this happens in the year **2504**. This is four years after the conclusion of the Brood War, which ended in 2500.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the End Date of the War**\nThe war concludes with the final defeat of the dark god Amon. This event takes place during the epilogue campaign of *Legacy of the Void*, titled \"Into the Void.\" According to the established lore and timelines, the final battle and Amon's permanent destruction occur in the year **2506**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Duration**\nThe war starts in 2504 and ends in 2506. This means the conflict spans across parts of three separate calendar years:\n*   Year 2504: Events of *Wings of Liberty* and the beginning of *Heart of the Swarm*.\n*   Year 2505: Events of *Heart of the Swarm* and most of *Legacy of the Void*.\n*   Year 2506: The conclusion of *Legacy of the Void* and the \"Into the Void\" epilogue.\n\nThe total elapsed time is therefore greater than two full years but not three full years. For example, if it started in March 2504 and ended in April 2506, the duration would be 2 years and 1 month.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Rounding Rule**\nThe question specifically asks for the duration in years, **rounded up**. Since the calculated duration is more than 2 years (e.g., approximately 2.1 or 2.2 years), rounding this value up to the nearest whole number gives us 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Terminology:** \"Second Great War\" is not an official in-universe name but is the standard term used by the fan community to refer to the conflict of *StarCraft II*.\n2.  **Timeline Specificity:** While the start and end years (2504 and 2506) are established, the exact months and days are not precisely detailed in the lore. However, knowing the years is sufficient for this calculation.\n3.  **The \"Rounded Up\" Instruction:** This is the most critical part of the question. Any duration that is not an exact integer must be rounded up to the next integer. Since the war spans parts of three calendar years, its duration is greater than 2, so rounding up results in 3.\n\nBased on this analysis, the war lasted for a duration greater than 2 years and is therefore rounded up to 3 years.\n\n<<<3>>>"
