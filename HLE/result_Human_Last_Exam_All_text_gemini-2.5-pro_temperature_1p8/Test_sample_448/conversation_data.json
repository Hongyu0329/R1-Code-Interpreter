    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Noble Gases:** The first step is to list the elements that are classified as noble gases. These are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring noble gases on Earth are:\n    *   Helium (He)\n    *   Neon (Ne)\n    *   Argon (Ar)\n    *   Krypton (Kr)\n    *   Xenon (Xe)\n    *   Radon (Rn)\n    *   (Note: Oganesson is also in Group 18 but is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally on Earth, so it is not considered).\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement Metric:** The question asks for the rarest gas \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" This means we need to find which noble gas has the lowest concentration when considering the entire Earth (atmosphere, crust, oceans, etc.). The atmospheric concentration is an excellent and standard measure for comparison since that is where these gases are predominantly found. The relative ranking of rarity is consistent whether you look at just the atmosphere or the entire Earth's mass.\n\n3.  **Gather Abundance Data:** We need to find the typical abundance of each noble gas on Earth. The most commonly cited values are for their concentration in Earth's atmosphere.\n\n    *   **Argon (Ar):** It is the most abundant noble gas, making up about 0.934% of the atmosphere.\n    *   **Neon (Ne):** The second most abundant, with a concentration of about 18.2 parts per million (ppm).\n    *   **Helium (He):** The third most abundant, with a concentration of about 5.2 ppm. Its abundance is lower than Neon's because its low mass allows it to escape Earth's gravity into space.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** Significantly rarer, with a concentration of about 1.1 ppm.\n    *   **Xenon (Xe):** Even rarer, with a concentration of about 0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion).\n    *   **Radon (Rn):** This is the crucial element for this question. Its abundance must be compared to the others.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Special Case of Radon (Rn):**\n    *   **Radioactivity:** Unlike the other noble gases listed, all of Radon's isotopes are radioactive. This means they are unstable and decay into other elements.\n    *   **Short Half-Life:** The most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a very short half-life of only 3.8 days.\n    *   **Transient Existence:** Radon is constantly being produced by the natural radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust. However, because it decays away so quickly, it can never accumulate in the environment to any significant degree. Its concentration is extremely low and varies by location, but its average global atmospheric abundance is estimated to be on the order of 1 part per 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1 in 10^21), which is many orders of magnitude rarer than Xenon.\n\n5.  **Compare All Gases and Conclude:**\n    *   Listing the gases from most abundant to least abundant in Earth's atmosphere:\n        1.  Argon (Ar)\n        2.  Neon (Ne)\n        3.  Helium (He)\n        4.  Krypton (Kr)\n        5.  Xenon (Xe)\n        6.  **Radon (Rn)**\n    *   Radon is vastly rarer than Xenon. The total mass of Radon in the entire atmosphere at any given moment is only a few kilograms, whereas the mass of Xenon is in the trillions of kilograms. This extreme rarity holds true for \"all terrestrial matter,\" not just the atmosphere.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Definition of \"Terrestrial Matter\":** While the term can be broad, the conclusion remains the same regardless of whether we consider just the atmosphere, the crust, or the whole planet. Radon's transient, radioactive nature makes it fundamentally rarer than the stable, accumulated noble gases.\n*   **The \"in 2002\" Clause:** The relative natural abundances of elements do not change on a year-to-year basis. Radon's average global abundance is tied to the decay of uranium, which has a half-life of billions of years. Therefore, the ranking of rarity was the same in 2002 as it is today. This detail does not change the answer.\n*   **Stability is Key:** The primary reason for Radon's rarity is its instability (radioactivity), which contrasts with the stability of the other noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) that have accumulated over geological time.\n\nBased on this analysis, Radon is unequivocally the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
