    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function Z for the given system using path integrals.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Partition Function\nThe grand canonical partition function (Z) for a system is defined as:\n$Z = \\text{Tr} \\left( e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N})} \\right)$\nwhere:\n*   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature.\n*   $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator of the system.\n*   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n*   $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n*   $\\text{Tr}(\\cdot)$ denotes the trace over a complete set of states.\n\nThe question specifies that the system's Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$.\n\n### Step 2: Determining the Operator in the Exponent\nWe substitute the given Hamiltonian into the general expression for Z:\nThe operator in the exponent is $\\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N} = (-\\mu \\hat{N}) - \\mu \\hat{N} = -2\\mu \\hat{N}$.\nTherefore, the partition function we need to calculate is:\n$Z = \\text{Tr} \\left( e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu \\hat{N})} \\right) = \\text{Tr} \\left( e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}} \\right)$\n\n### Step 3: Expressing Z as a Path Integral\nThe path integral formulation of the partition function is given by:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\phi^*, \\phi] e^{-S[\\phi^*, \\phi]}$\nwhere $S[\\phi^*, \\phi]$ is the Euclidean action and $\\phi$ represents the fields corresponding to the particles (bosons or fermions).\n\n### Step 4: Deriving the Euclidean Action (S)\nThe action is derived from the operator in the exponent, which acts as the effective grand canonical Hamiltonian. In second quantization, the particle number operator is $\\hat{N} = \\sum_k \\hat{a}_k^\\dagger \\hat{a}_k$, where $k$ labels the single-particle quantum states.\nThe operator in our exponent is $-2\\mu\\hat{N} = \\sum_k (-2\\mu) \\hat{a}_k^\\dagger \\hat{a}_k$.\nThis corresponds to a system of non-interacting particles where the effective single-particle energy in the grand canonical ensemble is $\\xi_k = -2\\mu$ for all states $k$.\n\nThe standard form of the Euclidean action for non-interacting particles is:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\phi_k^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\xi_k) \\phi_k(\\tau)$\nSubstituting our value for $\\xi_k$:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\phi_k^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\phi_k(\\tau)$\n\n### Step 5: Evaluating the Path Integral via Fourier Series\nTo evaluate the path integral, we expand the fields $\\phi_k(\\tau)$ in a Fourier series over the imaginary time interval $[0, \\beta]$. This diagonalizes the $\\partial_\\tau$ operator.\n$\\phi_k(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}} \\sum_n e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau} \\phi_{k,n}$\nThe derivative becomes $\\partial_\\tau \\phi_k(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}} \\sum_n (-i\\omega_n) e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau} \\phi_{k,n}$.\nSubstituting this into the action gives:\n$S = \\sum_{k,n} \\phi_{k,n}^* (-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu) \\phi_{k,n}$\nThe path integral measure becomes a product of integrals over the Fourier modes: $\\mathcal{D}[\\phi^*, \\phi] = \\prod_{k,n} d\\phi_{k,n}^* d\\phi_{k,n}$.\n\nThe result of the integral depends on whether the particles are bosons or fermions.\n\n#### Case A: Bosons\n*   The fields $\\phi_k$ are complex numbers.\n*   The fields obey periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time: $\\phi_k(\\beta) = \\phi_k(0)$.\n*   This implies the Matsubara frequencies are $\\omega_n = 2n\\pi/\\beta$, where $n$ is an integer.\n*   The path integral is a product of Gaussian integrals:\n    $Z_B = \\int \\left( \\prod_{k,n} d\\phi_{k,n}^* d\\phi_{k,n} \\right) \\exp\\left[-\\sum_{k,n} \\phi_{k,n}^* (-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu) \\phi_{k,n}\\right]$\n*   Each integral gives a factor proportional to the inverse of the coefficient in the exponent. This leads to the partition function being the inverse of the functional determinant of the operator in the action:\n    $Z_B = \\prod_k [\\det(-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu)]^{-1}$\n*   Using the standard formula for the functional determinant for bosons, $\\det(-i\\omega_n - E) = 1 - e^{-\\beta E}$, with $E = -2\\mu$, we get:\n    $\\det(-i\\omega_n - (-2\\mu)) = 1 - e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu)} = 1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}$\n*   Therefore, the partition function for bosons is:\n    $Z_B = \\prod_k \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\n\n#### Case B: Fermions\n*   The fields $\\phi_k$ are anti-commuting Grassmann numbers.\n*   The fields obey anti-periodic boundary conditions: $\\phi_k(\\beta) = -\\phi_k(0)$.\n*   This implies the Matsubara frequencies are $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$, where $n$ is an integer.\n*   The path integral is a product of Berezin (Grassmann) integrals:\n    $Z_F = \\int \\left( \\prod_{k,n} d\\phi_{k,n}^* d\\phi_{k,n} \\right) \\exp\\left[-\\sum_{k,n} \\phi_{k,n}^* (-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu) \\phi_{k,n}\\right]$\n*   Each integral is directly equal to the coefficient in the exponent. This leads to the partition function being equal to the functional determinant itself:\n    $Z_F = \\prod_k \\det(-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu)$\n*   Using the standard formula for the functional determinant for fermions, $\\det(-i\\omega_n - E) = 1 + e^{-\\beta E}$, with $E = -2\\mu$, we get:\n    $\\det(-i\\omega_n - (-2\\mu)) = 1 + e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu)} = 1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu}$\n*   Therefore, the partition function for fermions is:\n    $Z_F = \\prod_k (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})$\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correct Operator**: The most critical step is correctly identifying the operator inside the trace as $e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}}$. A misinterpretation of the input Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$ would lead to an incorrect result.\n2.  **Particle Statistics**: The path integral formalism is fundamentally different for bosons and fermions. This manifests in the boundary conditions (periodic vs. anti-periodic), the nature of the fields (complex numbers vs. Grassmann numbers), the resulting Matsubara frequencies, and the final value of the integral (inverse determinant vs. determinant). Since the problem does not specify the particle type, both cases must be considered.\n3.  **Matsubara Products**: The evaluation of the functional determinants requires standard, regularized results for infinite products over Matsubara frequencies. A naive calculation of the product would lead to divergences.\n4.  **Physical Convergence (Bosons)**: For the bosonic case, the result is a product of geometric series. For each series to converge, we require $|e^{2\\beta\\mu}| < 1$, which implies $2\\beta\\mu < 0$. Since $\\beta > 0$, this means the chemical potential must be negative ($\\mu < 0$). This is a well-known physical condition for a non-interacting Bose gas.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nSince the question does not specify the statistics of the particles, we provide the answer for both bosons and fermions. The index $k$ runs over all single-particle states of the system.\n\n*   For a system of **bosons**:\n    $Z_B = \\prod_k \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\n\n*   For a system of **fermions**:\n    $Z_F = \\prod_k (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})$\n\nThis can be written in a compact form as $Z = \\prod_k (1 \\mp e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{\\mp 1}$, where the top sign ($-$) corresponds to bosons and the bottom sign ($+$) corresponds to fermions.\n\n<<<For a system of bosons, the partition function is $Z_B = \\prod_k (1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-1}$. For a system of fermions, it is $Z_F = \\prod_k (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})$. Here, the product is over all single-particle states $k$, and $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature.>>>"
