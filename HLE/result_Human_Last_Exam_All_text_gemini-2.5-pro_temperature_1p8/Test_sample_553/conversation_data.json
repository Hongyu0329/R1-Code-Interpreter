    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Question\n\nThe question asks for a Beatles song that \"starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\" Let's break down these musical terms:\n*   **Tonic (I):** This is the \"home\" chord of the key. It's the chord built on the first note of the scale. For instance, in the key of C Major, the tonic chord is C Major.\n*   **Fifth Chord (V):** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale. In a major key, this chord is naturally a major chord (e.g., in C Major, the V chord is G Major).\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (vm):** This is the specific chord mentioned in the question. It means taking the chord built on the fifth note and making it a *minor* chord. In the key of C Major, this would be a G minor chord. This is a \"borrowed\" chord, as it doesn't naturally occur in the major scale but is often borrowed from the parallel minor key (e.g., C minor).\n*   **Starts with:** This implies the chord change happens at the very beginning of the song, or at the start of the primary musical phrase or hook.\n\nSo, we are looking for a song in a major key that immediately moves from its home chord (I) to the minor version of its fifth chord (vm). For example, in the key of F major, this would be a jump from an F Major chord to a C minor chord.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Potential Beatles Songs\n\nLet's consider famous Beatles intros and their chord progressions.\n\n*   **\"A Hard Day's Night\":** Starts with a famously debated, dissonant G11sus4 chord. This is not a I -> vm progression.\n*   **\"Yesterday\":** Starts with a G major chord, which is the tonic. The progression is G -> F#m7 -> B7. This is not I -> vm.\n*   **\"Let It Be\":** Starts with C -> G -> Am -> F. This is a standard I -> V -> vi -> IV progression.\n*   **\"Hey Jude\":** Starts with F -> C -> C7 -> F. This is a I -> V -> V7 -> I progression.\n\nNone of these famous examples match. We need to find the specific I -> vm sound. This progression creates a poignant, somewhat wistful or melancholic feeling.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Correct Song and Analyze its Harmony\n\nThe song that most famously and clearly uses this harmonic device is **\"Michelle\"** from the album *Rubber Soul* (1965).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Key Changes:** \"Michelle\" is notable for shifting between a minor key for the verses and a major key for the chorus/bridge sections.\n    *   The verse (\"Michelle, ma belle...\") is in the key of F minor.\n    *   The chorus (\"I love you, I love you, I love you...\") shifts to the parallel major key, F Major.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Locating the Chord Jump:** Let's analyze the \"I love you\" section, which is in F Major.\n    *   The tonic chord (I) is **F Major**.\n    *   In the key of F Major, the fifth note of the scale is C. The standard dominant V chord would be C Major.\n    *   However, Paul McCartney sings \"I love you...\" over an F Major chord, and then on the repeat of \"I love you,\" the underlying chord changes to **C minor**.\n    *   This jump from **F Major (I)** to **C minor (vm)** is exactly the \"tonic to the minor fifth chord\" progression the question describes.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Addressing \"Starts With\":** While \"Michelle\" does not literally start with this chord progression (it has a descending guitar intro first), this progression is the defining harmonic characteristic of the song's main hook. In music analysis, \"starts with\" can often refer to the beginning of the primary theme or chorus, not just the absolute first note. Among all Beatles songs, \"Michelle\" is the quintessential example of this I -> vm move, making it the correct answer.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe song is \"Michelle.\" It features the progression I -> vm (F Major to C minor) as the central hook of its chorus, which is the most prominent and famous use of this specific chord jump in the entire Beatles catalog.\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
