    "**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function matrix $H(s)$. This means we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, such that:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$.\n2.  $D(s)$ is a non-singular polynomial matrix (i.e., its determinant is not the zero polynomial).\n3.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. This means that the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex numbers $s$.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Express H(s) with a common denominator**\n\nFirst, we rewrite $H(s)$ by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of its elements.\nThe elements of $H(s)$ are:\n$H_{11}(s) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}$\n$H_{12}(s) = 1$\n$H_{21}(s) = \\frac{2}{s^2-1}$\n$H_{22}(s) = 0$\n\nThe denominators are $(s+1)$ and $(s^2-1)$. Since $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$, the LCM is $p(s) = s^2-1$.\n\nWe can write $H(s)$ as $H(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2-1} \\tilde{N}(s)$, where $\\tilde{N}(s)$ is a polynomial matrix:\n\\[\nH(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2-1} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{(s-1)(s^2-1)}{s+1} & 1 \\cdot (s^2-1) \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{s^2-1} \\begin{bmatrix} (s-1)(s-1) & s^2-1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{s^2-1} \\begin{bmatrix} (s-1)^2 & s^2-1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis gives an initial, but likely not coprime, factorization $H(s) = \\tilde{D}^{-1}(s)\\tilde{N}(s)$ with:\n\\[\n\\tilde{D}(s) = (s^2-1)I = \\begin{bmatrix} s^2-1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \\tilde{N}(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} (s-1)^2 & s^2-1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Check for Left Coprimeness**\n\nWe check if $\\tilde{D}(s)$ and $\\tilde{N}(s)$ are left coprime by examining the rank of the compound matrix $[\\tilde{D}(s) \\quad \\tilde{N}(s)]$ for all complex $s$. The rank must be 2 for all $s$.\n\\[\n[\\tilde{D}(s) \\quad \\tilde{N}(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} s^2-1 & 0 & (s-1)^2 & s^2-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe rank can potentially drop at the roots of the denominators, $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n*   At $s=1$:\n    \\[\n    [\\tilde{D}(1) \\quad \\tilde{N}(1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    The rank is 1, not 2. So they are not left coprime. There is a common factor related to $(s-1)$.\n\n*   At $s=-1$:\n    \\[\n    [\\tilde{D}(-1) \\quad \\tilde{N}(-1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & (-2)^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    The rank is 1, not 2. So they are not left coprime. There is a common factor related to $(s+1)$.\n\n**Step 3: Finding a Coprime Factorization**\n\nWe need to find a new pair $(D(s), N(s))$ by \"canceling out\" these common factors. We can use the definitional equation $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$ to find a suitable $D(s)$.\nLet $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. Then $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$ must be a polynomial matrix.\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11} & d_{12} \\\\ d_{21} & d_{22} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11} \\\\ d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nFor $N(s)$ to be polynomial, we require:\n1.  $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{21}(s)$ must be polynomials.\n2.  $d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1}$ must be a polynomial.\n3.  $d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1}$ must be a polynomial.\n\nLet's construct the rows of $D(s)$ one by one, aiming for a simple form (e.g., triangular) and low polynomial degrees.\n\n*   **For the first row $[d_{11} \\quad d_{12}]$:**\n    Let's pick the simplest non-trivial choice, $d_{11}(s)=1$. The second condition becomes:\n    $\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}}{s^2-1}$ must be a polynomial.\n    This means the numerator must be zero at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n    - At $s=1$: $(1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(1) = 0$.\n    - At $s=-1$: $(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(-1) = -2$.\n    We need to find the simplest polynomial $d_{12}(s)$ satisfying these two conditions. A linear polynomial $d_{12}(s) = as+b$ works.\n    $a(1)+b=0$ and $a(-1)+b=-2$.\n    This gives $b=-a$ and $-a-a = -2$, so $-2a=-2 \\implies a=1$ and $b=-1$.\n    Thus, $d_{12}(s)=s-1$.\n    The first row of $D(s)$ is $[1 \\quad s-1]$. Let's compute the first row of $N(s)$:\n    $N_{1,j} = [1 \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s-1)\\frac{2}{s^2-1}, \\quad 1 \\cdot 1] = [\\frac{(s-1)^2+2(s-1)}{s^2-1}, \\quad 1] = [\\frac{(s-1)(s+1)}{(s-1)(s+1)}, \\quad 1] = [1, 1]$.\n\n*   **For the second row $[d_{21} \\quad d_{22}]$:**\n    Let's try to make $D(s)$ upper triangular by setting $d_{21}(s)=0$. The third condition becomes:\n    $0 \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{2d_{22}}{s^2-1}$ must be a polynomial.\n    This means $d_{22}(s)$ must have factors of $(s-1)$ and $(s+1)$. The simplest non-zero choice is $d_{22}(s)=s^2-1$.\n    The second row of $D(s)$ is $[0 \\quad s^2-1]$. The second row of $N(s)$ is:\n    $N_{2,j} = [0 \\cdot H_{1,j} + (s^2-1) H_{2,j}] = [(s^2-1)\\frac{2}{s^2-1}, \\quad (s^2-1) \\cdot 0] = [2, \\quad 0]$.\n\nSo, we have our candidate matrices:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Final Verification**\n\n1.  **Polynomial Matrices:** Both $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ have polynomial entries.\n2.  **Factorization:** We have constructed them such that $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$, which is equivalent to $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ since $D(s)$ is non-singular ($\\det(D(s)) = s^2-1 \\neq 0$).\n3.  **Coprimeness:** We check the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ for all $s$.\n    \\[\n    [D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    We need to find if there is any $s$ for which the two rows become linearly dependent. Since the first row starts with `1` and the second row starts with `0`, the rows are linearly independent unless the second row is identically zero. The second row is $[0, s^2-1, 2, 0]$, which is never the zero vector because of the `2` in the third position.\n    Alternatively, consider the submatrix formed by columns 1 and 3: $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$. Its determinant is $1(2)-1(0)=2$. Since this determinant is a non-zero constant, the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has rank 2 for all values of $s$.\n    Therefore, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\nThe found matrices represent a valid left coprime factorization.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe left coprime factorization is given by $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$ with:\n\\[ D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\\[ N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\n<<<\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$, $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n>>>"
