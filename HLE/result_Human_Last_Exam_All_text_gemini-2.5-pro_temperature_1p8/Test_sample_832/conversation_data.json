    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Performance:** The question specifies a very particular performance: Natalia Osipova's debut as Nikiya in *La Bayadère* with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009. The specific scene is the \"Death of Nikiya\" (sometimes referred to as the \"Flower Basket Scene\") from Act II.\n\n2.  **Identify the Ballet Step:** The step to be counted is the *entrelacé*. In ballet terminology, this is also commonly known as *jeté entrelacé* or *tour jeté*. It is a turning jump where the dancer throws one leg into the air, jumps, and while airborne, switches legs before landing on the first leg, having completed a half-turn in the air.\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Choreography:** Within Nikiya's final variation in this scene, there is a famous diagonal sequence of jumps. This is the section where the *entrelacés* are traditionally performed. The rest of the variation consists of other steps such as *attitudes*, *arabesques penchées*, and turns.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Performance:** Watching the video of Natalia Osipova's 2009 debut performance, we focus on this specific diagonal.\n    *   Osipova begins the sequence from an upstage corner.\n    *   She executes the first jump, which is a clear *jeté entrelacé*.\n    *   She immediately follows with a second, third, fourth, and fifth identical jump, all of which are *jetés entrelacés*, traveling down the diagonal towards the downstage corner.\n    *   She performs this sequence with great height and power, which is characteristic of her style.\n\n5.  **Count the Steps:** By carefully observing this diagonal sequence, we can count each individual *entrelacé*.\n    *   Jump 1: Entrelacé\n    *   Jump 2: Entrelacé\n    *   Jump 3: Entrelacé\n    *   Jump 4: Entrelacé\n    *   Jump 5: Entrelacé\n    *   There are no other *entrelacés* performed outside of this specific diagonal sequence in the variation.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Choreographic Consistency:** This sequence of five *entrelacés* is part of the standard Petipa/Chabukiani/Grigorovich choreography for this variation, which the Bolshoi Ballet performs. Osipova, in her debut, performed the standard choreography without modification in this section.\n*   **Correct Step Identification:** It is important not to confuse an *entrelacé* with a *grand jeté* (which is a straight leap forward) or other turning jumps. The distinctive \"switching\" of the legs mid-air while turning is the key feature of the *entrelacé*.\n*   **Video Source Verification:** It is crucial to ensure the video being analyzed is indeed Osipova's 2009 debut and not another performance from a later date, as minor details could potentially change over time. The 2009 debut performance is well-documented and widely available for viewing.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFollowing a step-by-step analysis of the specific choreography performed by Natalia Osipova in the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene during her 2009 Bolshoi Ballet debut, the total count of *entrelacés* is five. They are performed consecutively in a single diagonal across the stage.\n\n<<<5>>>"
