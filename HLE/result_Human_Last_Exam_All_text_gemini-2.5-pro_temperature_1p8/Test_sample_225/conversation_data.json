    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Curve:** The curve is defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t). This is a specific type of curve known as a Lissajous curve.\n\n2.  **Determine the Parameters:** The general form of a Lissajous curve is x(t) = A*cos(at + δ) and y(t) = B*sin(bt). In our case, A=1, B=1, a=9, b=5, and the phase shift δ is equivalent to π/2 since cos(θ) = sin(θ + π/2).\n\n3.  **Check for Closure:** The curve is periodic. The period for the x-component is T_x = 2π/a = 2π/9. The period for the y-component is T_y = 2π/b = 2π/5. The curve will trace its complete path over the least common multiple of T_x and T_y. Since 9 and 5 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), the overall period is T = 2π. This means the curve is closed and we can analyze it over the interval t ∈ [0, 2π).\n\n4.  **Recall the Formula for Self-Intersections:** For a Lissajous curve defined by x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers, there is a well-established formula to calculate the number of self-intersection points.\n\n5.  **State the Formula:** The number of self-intersection points (N) is given by:\n    N = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\n6.  **Verify the Conditions:**\n    *   a = 9 and b = 5 are integers.\n    *   The greatest common divisor of a and b is GCD(9, 5) = 1. So, they are coprime.\n    *   This formula is known to hold for this configuration of Lissajous curves (where one component is a sine and the other is a cosine, and the frequencies are coprime).\n\n7.  **Apply the Formula and Calculate:**\n    *   Substitute the values a = 9 and b = 5 into the formula.\n    *   N = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\n    *   N = (8)(4) / 2\n    *   N = 32 / 2\n    *   N = 16\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Direct Calculation:** One could try to find the number of intersections by solving the system of equations:\n    cos(9t₁) = cos(9t₂)\n    sin(5t₁) = sin(5t₂)\n    for 0 ≤ t₁ < t₂ < 2π. This approach is significantly more complex. It involves finding all pairs (t₁, t₂) and then determining how many distinct Cartesian points (x, y) these pairs correspond to. This method is prone to overcounting or missing points due to symmetries and the possibility of multiple intersections at a single point, making the direct application of the formula much more reliable.\n*   **Formula Validity:** The formula N = (a-1)(b-1)/2 is robust for coprime frequencies a and b. The number of intersections is independent of the π/2 phase shift between the sine and cosine functions.\n*   **Parity of Frequencies:** Some sources give different formulas depending on the parity (odd/even) of a and b. For the case where both 'a' and 'b' are odd (as we have here with 9 and 5), the formula (a-1)(b-1)/2 is correct.\n\nBased on the standard and reliable formula for Lissajous curves, the number of self-intersection points is 16."
