    "This problem requires us to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings of the same length. The main challenge is to find a solution that is as memory-efficient as possible and to calculate the total memory used by its variables in bytes.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Question\n1.  **Input**: Two strings of equal length are provided on two separate lines. The length of these strings is between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive. They consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n2.  **Task**: Compare the two strings lexicographically.\n3.  **Comparison Rule**: The comparison must be case-insensitive. This means an uppercase letter is considered equal to its lowercase counterpart (e.g., 'A' is equivalent to 'a').\n4.  **Output**: Print \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second, \"1\" if it is larger, and \"0\" if they are equal.\n5.  **Constraint**: We need to devise the C program that uses the minimum amount of memory for its variables and determine this amount, `m`.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n1.  **Case-Insensitivity**: This is the primary rule of comparison. Before comparing any two characters from the strings, they must be converted to a uniform case (either both lowercase or both uppercase). The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is suitable for this.\n2.  **Lexicographical Comparison**: The comparison should be done character by character, from left to right (from index 0). The first position where the characters differ determines which string is smaller or larger. If the loop finishes without finding any difference, the strings are identical.\n3.  **Memory Efficiency**: To minimize memory, we should avoid storing both strings in memory if possible. Since the input is sequential (the first string is followed by the second), we cannot access a character from the second string without first processing the entire first string. This implies we must store at least the first string.\n4.  **Optimal Strategy**: A memory-efficient strategy would be to read the first string into a buffer. Then, read the second string character by character and compare it on-the-fly with the corresponding character from the stored first string. This avoids the need for a second buffer to store the second string.\n5.  **Variable Sizing**: To be maximally memory-efficient, we must choose the smallest possible data types for our variables. For example, since the string length is at most 100, a loop counter only needs to go up to 99. A `char` type (1 byte) is sufficient for this, rather than a standard `int` (typically 4 bytes).\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\nFollowing the optimal strategy, let's determine the variables required and their memory usage.\n\n1.  **Buffer for the first string**: We need to store the first string. With a maximum length of 100, we need a buffer of size 101 to also accommodate the null terminator character (`\\0`).\n    *   Declaration: `char s1[101];`\n    *   Memory: `101 * sizeof(char)` = 101 * 1 byte = **101 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Loop index variable**: We need an index to iterate through the characters of the stored string `s1`. As the length is at most 100, the index will range from 0 to 99. A `char` data type, which can typically store values from -128 to 127, is sufficient for this purpose and is more memory-efficient than an `int`.\n    *   Declaration: `char i;`\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n3.  **Temporary character variable**: To read the second string one character at a time, we need a variable to store each character temporarily before comparison. A `char` variable is the natural choice.\n    *   Declaration: `char c2;`\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\nThe C code implementing this would read the first string into `s1` (e.g., using `scanf(\"%s\", s1);`). Then, it would loop with the index `i` while `s1[i]` is not null. Inside the loop, it would read a character from the second string into `c2` (e.g., using `scanf(\" %c\", &c2);`) and perform the case-insensitive comparison.\n\nThe total memory usage `m` is the sum of the memory used by these variables:\n\n`m` = (memory for `s1`) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `c2`)\n`m` = 101 bytes + 1 byte + 1 byte\n`m` = 103 bytes\n\nThis approach is the most memory-efficient because:\n*   Storing the first string is unavoidable due to the sequential nature of standard input.\n*   The second string is processed character by character, avoiding a second large buffer.\n*   The variables used for control (the index `i` and temporary character `c2`) are of the smallest possible data type.\n\nTherefore, the total memory used for variables in the most memory-efficient C program is 103 bytes.\n\n<<<103>>>"
