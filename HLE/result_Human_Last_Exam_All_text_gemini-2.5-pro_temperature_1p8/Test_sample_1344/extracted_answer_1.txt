The optimal combination is a single-site zirconium hydride catalyst supported on high-surface-area amorphous silica. In this system, Zirconium (Zr) is the Group IV metal, and the siloxy groups (â‰¡SiO-) of the silica support itself act as the primary, thermally robust ligands. The active catalyst is formed by grafting an organozirconium precursor onto the silica and subsequently reducing it with hydrogen.
