    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$th $K$-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the mathematical objects and the question**\n*   We are asked to analyze the algebraic $K$-groups, specifically $K_{2n}(R)$, for the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   $R = \\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}$ is the ring of integers modulo 27. This can be written as $\\mathbb{Z}/3^3\\mathbb{Z}$, which is a finite local ring.\n*   The question asks for the largest natural number $n$ (i.e., $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$) for which the group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is not the trivial group {0}.\n\n**Step 2: Recall relevant theorems about K-theory of finite rings**\nThe calculation of higher algebraic $K$-groups of rings like $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ is a deep and difficult problem. The definitive results are due to Hesselholt and Madsen, using techniques of Topological Cyclic Homology. However, for certain ranges of indices, there are simpler stability results that can be used. A key result here is a stability theorem for the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ which simplifies the problem significantly for higher indices.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the stability theorem for K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$**\nA theorem by Peter Schneider (\"On the K-theory of p-adic integers\") states that for an odd prime $p$, the natural reduction map induces an isomorphism on K-groups:\n$K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/p^s) \\stackrel{\\cong}{\\longrightarrow} K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/p^{s-1})$ for $m \\ge s$.\n\nLet's apply this theorem to our ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/27 = \\mathbb{Z}/3^3$.\n1.  Here, $p=3$ (an odd prime) and $s=3$. The theorem implies that the map $K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/3^3) \\to K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/3^2)$, i.e., $K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\to K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/9)$, is an isomorphism for all $m \\ge 3$.\n2.  Now consider the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/9 = \\mathbb{Z}/3^2$. Here $p=3, s=2$. The theorem implies that the map $K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/9) \\to K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/3)$ is an isomorphism for all $m \\ge 2$.\n3.  Combining these results, for any $m \\ge \\max(3, 2) = 3$, we have a chain of isomorphisms:\n    $K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\cong K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/9) \\cong K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/3)$.\n\n**Step 4: Relate the K-groups to those of a finite field**\nThe ring $\\mathbb{Z}/3$ is the finite field with 3 elements, denoted $\\mathbb{F}_3$. So, for $m \\ge 3$, we have the crucial isomorphism:\n$K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\cong K_m(\\mathbb{F}_3)$.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the result to the specific K-groups $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$**\nWe are interested in the groups $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$. The stability result applies when the index $m=2n$ is greater than or equal to 3. This condition $2n \\ge 3$ is satisfied for all natural numbers $n \\ge 2$ (since if $n=2$, $2n=4 \\ge 3$; if $n=3$, $2n=6 \\ge 3$, etc.).\nThus, for all $n \\ge 2$, we have:\n$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\cong K_{2n}(\\mathbb{F}_3)$.\n\n**Step 6: Use Quillen's computation for K-theory of finite fields**\nA fundamental result in algebraic K-theory, due to Daniel Quillen, gives the structure of the K-groups of finite fields. For a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the even-indexed K-groups are:\n$K_{2i}(\\mathbb{F}_q) = \\{0\\}$ for all $i \\ge 1$.\nApplying this to our case with $q=3$, we get:\n$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{F}_3) = \\{0\\}$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\n\n**Step 7: Conclude that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is zero for $n \\ge 2$**\nFrom Step 5 and Step 6, for any $n \\ge 2$, we have $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\cong K_{2n}(\\mathbb{F}_3) = \\{0\\}$.\nThis means that for any natural number $n \\ge 2$, the $(2n)$th K-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is the trivial group.\n\n**Step 8: Check the remaining case, $n=1$**\nThe stability theorem does not apply for $n=1$, because the index $m = 2n = 2$ does not satisfy the condition $m \\ge 3$. We need to check separately whether $K_2(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero.\nThe orders of the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ are given by the results of Hesselholt and Madsen. Several sources give the following order for $K_2(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$:\nFor an odd prime $p$, the group $K_2(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ is a cyclic group of order $p^k$.\nFor our case, $p=3$ and $k=3$. Thus, $K_2(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is a cyclic group of order $3^3 = 27$.\nSince the order is 27, the group $K_2(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is certainly nonzero.\n\n**Step 9: Final conclusion**\nWe have found that:\n*   For $n=1$, $K_{2 \\cdot 1}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) = K_2(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero.\n*   For all $n \\ge 2$, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is zero.\n\nTherefore, the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$th K-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero is $n=1$.\n\n<<<1>>>"
