    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze and factor the polynomial**\n\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We can try to factor this polynomial by grouping terms.\nNotice that some terms are multiples of $x^2-2$.\n$x^7 - 2x^5 = x^5(x^2 - 2)$\n$-9x^3 + 18x = -9x(x^2 - 2)$\n$3x^2 - 6 = 3(x^2 - 2)$\nCombining these, we get:\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nLet $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $h(x) = x^2 - 2$. The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the factors and their Galois groups**\n\n*   **Analysis of $h(x) = x^2 - 2$:**\n    This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (e.g., by Eisenstein's criterion with $p=2$). Its roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field of $h(x)$ is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a normal extension of degree $[K_h : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2$. Its Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n*   **Analysis of $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:**\n    This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The prime 3 divides all coefficients except the leading one (1), and $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term 3.\n    Since $g(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 5, its Galois group $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_5$. The order of $G_g$ is divisible by 5.\n    To determine the specific group, we check the number of real roots of $g(x)$. The derivative is $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $g'(x)=0$, which are $x = \\pm\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. There are two real critical points.\n    $g(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = (9/5)^{5/4} - 9(9/5)^{1/4} + 3 = (9/5)^{1/4}(9/5 - 9) + 3 < 0$.\n    $g(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = -(9/5)^{5/4} + 9(9/5)^{1/4} + 3 = -(9/5)^{1/4}(9/5 - 9) + 3 > 0$.\n    Since there is a positive local maximum and a negative local minimum, $g(x)$ has exactly 3 real roots and therefore 2 complex conjugate roots.\n    A theorem in Galois theory states that if an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ has exactly two non-real roots, its Galois group is the full symmetric group $S_p$. Here, $p=5$, so $G_g \\cong S_5$.\n    The degree of the splitting field $K_g$ of $g(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of K/Q**\n\nThe splitting field of $f(x)$ is $K = K_g K_h$. The degree of this composite field is given by:\n$[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\frac{[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}] [K_h:\\mathbb{Q}]}{[K_g \\cap K_h : \\mathbb{Q}]} = \\frac{120 \\cdot 2}{[K_g \\cap K_h : \\mathbb{Q}]}$.\nThe intersection $K_g \\cap K_h = K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n$K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a subfield of $K_g$.\nThe splitting field $K_g$ of a quintic with Galois group $S_5$ has a unique quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of the quintic polynomial.\nThe discriminant of $g(x) = x^5+px+q$ is $D = 5^5 q^4 + 4^4 p^5$. For $g(x)=x^5-9x+3$, we have $p=-9, q=3$.\n$D = 5^5 (3)^4 + 4^4 (-9)^5 = 3125 \\cdot 81 + 256 \\cdot (-59049) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\nThe quadratic subfield of $K_g$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$, which is an imaginary quadratic field. This cannot be equal to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which is a real quadratic field.\nTherefore, $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis means $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 120 \\cdot 2 = 240$. The Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong G_g \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the possible degrees of normal intermediate fields**\n\nWe are looking for the degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these extensions correspond bijectively to the normal subgroups $H$ of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$ such that $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H|$. We need to find the orders of all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}, A_5, S_5$. The normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}, C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups $H$ of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ can be more than just products of normal subgroups of $G_1$ and $G_2$. A complete analysis gives the following proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$:\n1.  **Product-type subgroups:**\n    *   $H_1 = A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$. $|H_1| = |A_5| \\cdot 1 = 60$. The index is $[G:H_1] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $H_2 = S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$. $|H_2| = |S_5| \\cdot 1 = 120$. The index is $[G:H_2] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times C_2$. $|H_3| = 1 \\cdot |C_2| = 2$. This is the center of $G$. The index is $[G:H_3] = 240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $H_4 = A_5 \\times C_2$. $|H_4| = |A_5| \\cdot |C_2| = 60 \\cdot 2 = 120$. The index is $[G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n2.  **Diagonal-type subgroups:**\n    There is one additional \"diagonal\" normal subgroup. This subgroup arises from a homomorphism from $S_5$ to $C_2$. The non-trivial homomorphism is the sign map, $\\text{sgn}: S_5 \\to \\{\\pm 1\\} \\cong C_2$.\n    *   $H_5 = \\{(g, \\text{sgn}(g)) \\mid g \\in S_5\\}$. This is a normal subgroup of $S_5 \\times C_2$. Its order is $|S_5|=120$. The index is $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n**Step 5: List the possible degrees**\n\nThe degrees of the corresponding normal sub-extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ are the indices of these subgroups:\n*   From $H_1=A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$, we get degree $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.\n*   From $H_2=S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$, we get degree $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\n*   From $H_3=\\{e\\} \\times C_2$, we get degree $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 120$.\n*   From $H_4=A_5 \\times C_2$, we get degree $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\n*   From $H_5=N_{diag}$, we get degree $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\n\nCollecting all the unique possible degrees, we find that the possible degrees for such extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ are 2, 4, and 120.\n\nFinal check of the subfields:\n*   Degree 2: $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2D})$ (where $D=-14863419$). These are all normal over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   Degree 4: $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{D})$. This is the splitting field of $(x^2-2)(x^2-D)$, so it is normal over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   Degree 120: $K_g$, the splitting field of $x^5 - 9x + 3$, is normal over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by definition.\n\nThus, the set of all possible degrees is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
