    "An elegant explanation of the method to solve the problem is as follows.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Purpose:**\n    The provided algorithm, `IMAG(n, c)`, converts a non-negative integer `n` into its representation in base `c`. For example, `IMAG(13, 2)` would produce the binary representation `(1101)`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Main Computational Work:**\n    The algorithm's structure consists of three parts:\n    *   An initialization step (Step 1).\n    *   A `while` loop (Step 2).\n    *   A return statement (Step 3).\n    The dominant part of the computation, which determines the overall complexity, is the `while` loop, as its execution count depends on the input value `n`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Initialization (Step 1):**\n    *   `i := 0;` (1 assignment)\n    *   `x := n;` (1 assignment)\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;` (1 division, 1 assignment)\n    *   `a_{0} := x — qc;` (1 multiplication, 1 subtraction, 1 assignment)\n    This step involves a fixed, small number of basic operations. Its time complexity is constant, which is denoted as `O(1)`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the `while` Loop (Step 2):**\n    To find the complexity of the loop, we need to determine two things:\n    a. The number of operations inside one iteration of the loop.\n    b. The total number of iterations.\n\n    *   **a. Cost per Iteration:**\n        Inside the loop (Step 2.1), we have:\n        *   `i := i + 1;` (1 addition, 1 assignment)\n        *   `x := q;` (1 assignment)\n        *   `q :=. ⌊x/c⌋;` (1 division, 1 assignment)\n        *   `a_{i} := x — qc$` (1 multiplication, 1 subtraction, 1 assignment)\n        The work performed in each iteration is a constant number of basic operations. Therefore, the time complexity of a single iteration is `O(1)`.\n\n    *   **b. Number of Iterations:**\n        The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. The value of `q` is what controls the loop. Let's see how `q` changes.\n        *   Before the loop, `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`.\n        *   After the first iteration, the new `q` is `⌊(old q)/c⌋`, which is `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n        *   After the `k`-th iteration, `q` becomes `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n        The loop terminates when this value of `q` is no longer greater than 0, i.e., when `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0`. This occurs when `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, or `n < c^(k+1)`.\n        The loop runs for as many times as we can divide `n` by `c` before the quotient becomes 0. This is fundamentally related to the number of digits in the base-c representation of `n`.\n        The number of iterations `k` satisfies the condition `c^k ≤ n < c^(k+1)`. Taking the logarithm to the base `c` gives `k ≤ log_c(n) < k+1`.\n        This means the number of iterations is `k = ⌊log_c(n)⌋`.\n        Therefore, the loop runs `O(log_c(n))` times.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Time Complexity:**\n    The total time `T(n)` is the sum of the time for each part:\n    `T(n) = T(initialization) + T(loop)`\n    `T(n) = O(1) + (Number of iterations) × (Cost per iteration)`\n    `T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) × O(1)`\n    `T(n) = O(log_c(n))`\n\n6.  **Final Simplification:**\n    In Big-O notation, the base of the logarithm is a constant factor and can be omitted. This is because `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`, and since `c ≥ 2` is a constant, `log(c)` is also a constant.\n    Thus, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Cost Model:** This analysis assumes a uniform cost model, where each basic arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on integers takes a single unit of time. This is a standard convention in introductory algorithm analysis.\n*   **Loop Control Variable:** The key to the analysis is understanding that the loop effectively reduces the magnitude of the number being processed by a factor of `c` in each step. This repeated division by a constant factor is the hallmark of logarithmic time complexity.\n*   **Big-O Notation:** The base of the logarithm does not affect the order of growth, so `log_c(n)`, `ln(n)`, and `log_2(n)` are all represented as `O(log n)`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
