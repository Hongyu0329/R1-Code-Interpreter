    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the mushroom genus with a blue spore print.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a single *genus* of mushroom based on a very specific and rare characteristic: a \"distinctly blue spore print\".\n\n2.  **Understand Spore Prints:** A spore print is a crucial identification tool in mycology. It's made by placing a mushroom cap on a surface (like paper) and allowing its microscopic spores to fall and collect, revealing their color in mass. Common spore print colors are white, cream, pink, yellow, ochre, brown, purple-brown, and black.\n\n3.  **Address Common Misconceptions (Careful Points):** It is important to differentiate between the color of the mushroom's body and the color of its spore print. Many mushrooms have blue features, but this does not mean their spore print is blue.\n    *   **Blue Bruising:** Some mushrooms, like *Gyroporus cyanescens* (the \"Bluing Bolete\"), turn intensely blue when cut or bruised. However, their spore print is a pale yellow.\n    *   **Blue-colored Flesh/Latex:** The famous *Lactarius indigo* is a striking blue mushroom that bleeds blue latex. Its spore print, however, is cream to pale yellow.\n    *   **Blue Cap Color:** Some species, like New Zealand's *Entoloma hochstetteri*, have a vibrant blue cap, but the genus *Entoloma* is defined by its pink, angular spores.\n\n4.  **Identify the Correct Genus:** Through mycological research, we find that there is indeed one group of mushrooms known for this unique trait. These species were formerly classified in the large genus *Lactarius*. However, due to DNA analysis and reclassification, they have been moved to the genus *Lactifluus*.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the Specific Group and Example:** The blue spore print is characteristic of a specific subsection within *Lactifluus*, known as subsection *Caerulei*. A prime example of a species from this group is *Lactifluus lazulinus*, found in Southeast Asia. Its spore print is a pale sky blue. This trait is considered unique in the world of gilled mushrooms.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:** The question asks for the *genus*. Based on modern classification, the single genus that contains species producing a distinctly blue spore print is *Lactifluus*.\n\n<<<Lactifluus>>>"
