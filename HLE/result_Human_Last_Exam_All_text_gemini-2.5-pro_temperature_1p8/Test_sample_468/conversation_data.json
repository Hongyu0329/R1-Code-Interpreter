    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the common name for the genus *Perdita* and when it was coined.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Genus and its Native Range\nThe question is about the bee genus *Perdita* (Smith, 1853). This is a very large genus of small bees. Their native range is primarily in the arid and desert regions of North and Central America, especially the southwestern United States and Mexico. The common name in question would be one used in this region, primarily in English.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Currently Used Common Name\nTo find the common name, we consult authoritative entomological sources that cover North American insects.\n*   **Field Guides:** Modern guides like \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\" (2016) by Joseph S. Wilson & Olivia Messinger Carril consistently refer to the genus *Perdita* as **\"Fairy bees\"**. They are noted for being some of North America's smallest bees.\n*   **Academic and Online Databases:** Websites like BugGuide.net, which is maintained by entomologists and enthusiasts, lists the common name for the genus *Perdita* as \"Fairy Bees\". University entomology departments (e.g., University of California, Riverside, a center for bee research) also use this name.\n*   **Other Names:** While they are sometimes broadly categorized with other small bees like \"dwarf bees,\" or ground-nesting bees like \"sand bees\" or \"mining bees,\" the most specific and widely accepted common name for the genus *Perdita* itself is \"Fairy bees.\" This name reflects their minute size and often delicate, sometimes iridescent, appearance.\n\n### Step 3: Determine When the Common Name Was Coined\nThis part is more complex, as \"coining\" can refer to the first informal use or the first formal publication. In a scientific context, the date of its first appearance in a major, formal, and influential publication is considered the most appropriate answer.\n*   The term's origin is not from an ancient text but from 20th-century entomological literature aimed at making bee classification more accessible.\n*   We look for a key publication that formally assigned or popularized this common name. A pivotal work is **\"The Bee Genera of North and Central America (Hymenoptera: Apoidea)\"** published in **1994** by Charles D. Michener, Ronald J. McGinley, and Bryan N. Danforth.\n*   In this comprehensive guide, under the entry for the genus *Perdita*, the authors explicitly state: **\"Common name: Fairy bees.\"**\n*   While the term may have been used informally by bee specialists before this, its inclusion in this specific, highly authoritative reference book by the world's leading bee experts represents its formal establishment and codification for the scientific community and public. This is the most defensible date for when the name was officially \"coined\" in a published, citable source.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Final Answer\n*   The currently used common name for the genus *Perdita* is **Fairy bees**.\n*   The year this name was formally established in a major, authoritative publication was **1994**.\n*   Combining these into the required format: `<name>, <year>`.\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 1994>>>"
