**Appropriate Management Procedures:**
The patient's management must be performed in sequential phases, prioritizing her systemic health:
1.  **Immediate Systemic Management:** An urgent medical consultation is required to manage her untreated diabetes mellitus. This involves initiating blood glucose monitoring and starting appropriate therapy (e.g., Metformin, insulin) to stabilize her condition. Due to the 28-hour delay and diabetic status, she must be started on prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics and receive a tetanus booster.
2.  **Acute Dental Management:** The traumatic area requires a thorough examination, including radiographs (preferably a CBCT scan) to rule out alveolar or jaw fractures. The sockets of the lost teeth must be gently debrided of contaminants and irrigated with sterile saline. Any associated soft tissue lacerations should be sutured.
3.  **Provisional Restoration:** Following initial healing, a temporary acrylic removable partial denture ("flipper") should be fabricated to restore aesthetics and maintain space while her systemic condition improves and the jawbone heals.
4.  **Definitive Restoration:** After her diabetes is well-controlled (HbA1c < 7%) and the site has fully healed (3-6 months), a definitive restoration can be planned. Given her Class III skeletal pattern and systemic risks, the most appropriate choice is a Removable Partial Denture.

**Cells of Interest:**
The primary cells of interest are those critical for inflammation and wound healing, whose func
