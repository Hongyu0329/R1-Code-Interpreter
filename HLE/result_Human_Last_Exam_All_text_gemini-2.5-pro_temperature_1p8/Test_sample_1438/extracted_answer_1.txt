The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable ($\eta$) integral is not a single number but is defined by the rules of Berezin integration. The two fundamental rules that define the operation of the measure, $d\eta$, and maintain consistency with the Pauli exclusion principle (which is encoded in the property $\eta^2=0$) are: (1) $\int d\eta \, c = 0$ for any constant c, and (2) $\int d\eta \, \eta = 1$.
