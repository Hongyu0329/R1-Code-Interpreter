    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Group in Question**\n\n*   **Group:** The generalized quaternion group of size 128 is denoted by $Q_{128}$.\n*   **Definition:** The generalized quaternion group of order $4n$, $Q_{4n}$, has the presentation $\\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n*   **Our Specific Group:** For size 128, we have $4n = 128$, so $n=32$. The group is $G = Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n*   **Elements:** The elements of $G$ are of two forms: $x^i$ for $0 \\le i \\le 63$, and $x^i y$ for $0 \\le i \\le 63$.\n*   **Exponent of the Group:** The exponent of a group is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of all its elements.\n    *   The order of $x$ is 64. The powers of $x$ generate a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64.\n    *   Let's find the order of an element of the form $g = x^i y$.\n        *   $g^2 = (x^i y)(x^i y) = x^i(yx^i y^{-1})y^2 = x^i(x^{-i})y^2 = y^2 = x^{32}$.\n        *   $g^4 = (g^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n    *   Since $g^2 = x^{32} \\neq 1$, the order of any element $x^i y$ is 4.\n    *   The orders of elements in $G$ are powers of 2, with the maximum order being 64 (the order of $x$). The exponent of $G$ is $\\exp(G) = \\text{lcm}(64, 4) = 64$.\n\n**2. Define Power Subgroup**\n\n*   A **power subgroup** of a group $G$ is a subgroup $H$ that can be formed by taking all the $k$-th powers of elements in $G$ for some integer $k$, and then generating a subgroup from that set. Formally, $H = G^k = \\langle \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\} \\rangle$.\n*   The number of distinct power subgroups is the size of the set $\\{ G^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\}$.\n\n**3. Simplify the Counting Problem**\n\n*   A crucial property of power subgroups is that for any finite group $G$ and any integer $k$, $G^k = G^d$ where $d = \\gcd(k, \\exp(G))$.\n*   In our case, $\\exp(G) = 64$. This means we only need to consider the power subgroups $G^d$ where $d$ is a divisor of 64.\n*   The divisors of 64 are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$. We will calculate the subgroup for each of these seven values.\n\n**4. Calculate Each Power Subgroup**\n\nLet's compute $G^d = \\langle \\{g^d \\mid g \\in G\\} \\rangle$ for each divisor $d$ of 64.\n\n*   **d = 1:**\n    $G^1 = \\langle \\{g^1 \\mid g \\in G\\} \\rangle = G = Q_{128}$. Its order is 128.\n\n*   **d = 2:**\n    $G^2 = \\langle \\{g^2 \\mid g \\in G\\} \\rangle$. We check the squares of all elements:\n    *   For $g = x^i$: $g^2 = x^{2i}$. These elements generate the subgroup $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$.\n    *   For $g = x^i y$: $g^2 = x^{32}$. This element is already in $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ since $x^{32} = (x^{16})^2$.\n    *   Thus, $G^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $64/2 = 32$.\n\n*   **d = 4:**\n    $G^4 = \\langle \\{g^4 \\mid g \\in G\\} \\rangle$. We check the 4th powers:\n    *   For $g = x^i$: $g^4 = x^{4i}$. These generate $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$.\n    *   For $g = x^i y$: $g^4 = 1$. This element is in any subgroup.\n    *   Thus, $G^4 = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $64/4 = 16$.\n\n*   **d = 8:**\n    $G^8 = \\langle \\{g^8 \\mid g \\in G\\} \\rangle$.\n    *   $(x^i)^8 = x^{8i}$. These generate $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$.\n    *   $(x^i y)^8 = ((x^i y)^4)^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n    *   Thus, $G^8 = \\langle x^8 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $64/8 = 8$.\n\n*   **d = 16:**\n    By the same logic, $G^{16} = \\langle \\{g^{16} \\mid g \\in G\\} \\rangle = \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $64/16 = 4$.\n\n*   **d = 32:**\n    $G^{32} = \\langle \\{g^{32} \\mid g \\in G\\} \\rangle = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $64/32 = 2$. It is the center of the group, $Z(Q_{128})$.\n\n*   **d = 64:**\n    $G^{64} = \\langle \\{g^{64} \\mid g \\in G\\} \\rangle$. Since $\\exp(G)=64$, every element $g$ satisfies $g^{64}=1$.\n    *   Thus, $G^{64} = \\langle \\{1\\} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$, the trivial subgroup. Its order is 1.\n\n**5. Count the Distinct Subgroups**\n\nThe power subgroups we have found are:\n1.  $G^1 = Q_{128}$ (order 128)\n2.  $G^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n3.  $G^4 = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (order 16)\n4.  $G^8 = \\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (order 8)\n5.  $G^{16} = \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n6.  $G^{32} = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n7.  $G^{64} = \\{1\\}$ (order 1)\n\nSince all these subgroups have different orders, they are all distinct. Therefore, there are 7 distinct power subgroups.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Definition of Power Subgroup:** The most standard definition, $G^k = \\langle \\{g^k | g \\in G \\} \\rangle$, is used. Other interpretations, like \"cyclic subgroup,\" would yield a different result (39 in this case) but are non-standard terminology for this question.\n*   **Exponent vs. Order:** It is important to use the group's exponent ($\\exp(G)=64$) to determine the set of relevant powers, not the group's order ($|G|=128$).\n*   **Generators:** The calculation of $G^k$ must consider all elements, not just the group generators. Specifically, the powers of elements of the form $x^i y$ are critical. For instance, knowing $(x^i y)^2 = x^{32}$ is key to finding $G^2$.\n*   **Distinctness:** The final list of subgroups must be checked for duplicates. In this problem, checking the orders is a simple way to confirm they are all distinct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, we have identified 7 distinct power subgroups corresponding to the divisors of the group's exponent, 64.\n\n<<<7>>>"
