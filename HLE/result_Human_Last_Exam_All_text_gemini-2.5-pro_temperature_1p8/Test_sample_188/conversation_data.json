  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Goal\nThe main question is to find the **maximum possible length** of a secret message.\n\n### Step 2: Deconstruct the Provided Information\nLet's break down the information into relevant and irrelevant pieces.\n*   **Ching (The Ciphertext):**\n    *   It contains exactly **9999 symbols**.\n    *   These symbols are used to encrypt the message. This means the *Ching* is the complete encrypted message, or the ciphertext.\n*   **Shu (The Source of the Plaintext Alphabet):**\n    *   It is written with **120 unique Chinese characters**. This tells us the size of the alphabet for the secret message. The message can only use these 120 characters.\n    *   The fact that it contains \"around 3000\" characters is the length of the *source book*, not the secret message itself, so this is likely extraneous information.\n*   **Encryption Process:**\n    *   The message (plaintext) is written using characters from the *Shu*.\n    *   It is encrypted into the symbols of the *Ching* (ciphertext).\n*   **Computational Details (Potential Red Herrings):**\n    *   Character recognition time: 12 ms.\n    *   Integer operation time: 10 ns.\n    *   Float operation time: 30 ns.\n    These details relate to the *processing* of the books, not to the fundamental properties of the message and its encryption. They are not needed to determine the message's length.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Relationship between Plaintext and Ciphertext\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship between the length of the original message (plaintext) and the length of the encrypted message (ciphertext).\n\n*   The ciphertext is the *Ching*, which has a fixed length of **9999 symbols**.\n*   The secret message's characters are each represented by one or more symbols from the *Ching*.\n*   We want to find the **maximum** possible length for the secret message.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Optimal Encryption Scheme for Maximum Length\nTo maximize the length of the original message from a fixed-length encrypted text, we need the most efficient encoding scheme possible.\n\n*   **Scenario A: One character maps to multiple symbols.** For example, if 1 character from the message was encoded as 2 symbols in the *Ching*. The message length would be 9999 / 2 = 4999.5 (or 4999). This does not maximize the length.\n*   **Scenario B: One character maps to one symbol.** This is a simple substitution cipher. For every symbol in the *Ching*, we can decode one character of the message. In this case, the message length would be equal to the number of symbols, which is 9999.\n\nThe condition that the message alphabet has only 120 characters is important because it confirms that a 1-to-1 mapping is possible. Since there are 9999 symbols available in the *Ching*, we have more than enough unique symbols to assign one to each of the 120 unique characters.\n\nTherefore, the most efficient encoding that results in the longest possible message is a one-to-one mapping.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer\nUnder the most efficient mapping (one symbol per character), the length of the message is equal to the length of the ciphertext.\n\n*   Length of Ciphertext (*Ching*) = 9999 symbols\n*   Maximum Length of Plaintext (Message) = 9999 characters\n\nThe information about the processing times and the original length of the *Shu* is extraneous and does not affect this calculation.\n\n***\n\n<<<9999>>>"
