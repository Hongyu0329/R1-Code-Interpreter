    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**1. Define the System and the Goal**\n\nWe are given the state-space representation of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system:\n*   State matrix: `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n*   Input matrix: `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nWe want to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` has its eigenvalues at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`. The feedback law is assumed to be `u = Fx`, leading to the closed-loop dynamics `ẋ = Ax + B(Fx) = (A + BF)x`.\n\nThe state feedback gain matrix `F` must be a 2x2 matrix. Let's denote it as:\n`F = [[f₁₁, f₁₂], [f₂₁, f₂₂]]`\n\n**2. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe desired eigenvalues (poles) of the closed-loop system are `λ₁ = -1 + j` and `λ₂ = -1 - j`. The characteristic polynomial is formed from these roots:\n`p(λ) = (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)`\n`p(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p(λ) = (λ + 1 - j)(λ + 1 + j)`\nUsing the difference of squares formula `(a - b)(a + b) = a² - b²`, with `a = λ + 1` and `b = j`:\n`p(λ) = (λ + 1)² - j²`\nSince `j² = -1`:\n`p(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 1 - (-1)`\n`p(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2`\nThis is the target characteristic polynomial for our closed-loop system.\n\n**3. Form the Closed-Loop Matrix A + BF**\n\nFirst, we calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f₁₁, f₁₂], [f₂₁, f₂₂]]`\n`BF = [[1*f₁₁ + 2*f₂₁, 1*f₁₂ + 2*f₂₂], [1*f₁₁, 1*f₁₂]]`\n`BF = [[f₁₁ + 2f₂₁, f₁₂ + 2f₂₂], [f₁₁, f₁₂]]`\n\nNext, we add `A` to `BF` to get the closed-loop matrix `A_cl`:\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f₁₁ + 2f₂₁, f₁₂ + 2f₂₂], [f₁₁, f₁₂]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f₁₁ + 2f₂₁, 1 + f₁₂ + 2f₂₂], [1 + f₁₁, f₁₂]]`\n\n**4. Derive the Characteristic Polynomial of A + BF**\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of a 2x2 matrix `M = [[a, b], [c, d]]` is `det(λI - M) = λ² - trace(M)λ + det(M)`.\nLet's find the trace and determinant of `A_cl`:\n*   `trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f₁₁ + 2f₂₁) + f₁₂ = f₁₁ + f₁₂ + 2f₂₁ - 1`\n*   `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f₁₁ + 2f₂₁) * f₁₂ - (1 + f₁₂ + 2f₂₂) * (1 + f₁₁)`\n    `= -f₁₂ + f₁₁f₁₂ + 2f₁₂f₂₁ - (1 + f₁₁ + f₁₂ + f₁₁f₁₂ + 2f₂₂ + 2f₁₁f₂₂)`\n    `= -f₁₂ + f₁₁f₁₂ + 2f₁₂f₂₁ - 1 - f₁₁ - f₁₂ - f₁₁f₁₂ - 2f₂₂ - 2f₁₁f₂₂`\n    `= -1 - f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ + 2f₁₂f₂₁ - 2f₂₂ - 2f₁₁f₂₂`\n\nSo, the characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is:\n`p_cl(λ) = λ² - (f₁₁ + f₁₂ + 2f₂₁ - 1)λ + (-1 - f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ + 2f₁₂f₂₁ - 2f₂₂ - 2f₁₁f₂₂)`\n\n**5. Equate Coefficients and Solve for F**\n\nNow we equate the coefficients of `p_cl(λ)` with our desired polynomial `p(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2`.\n\n*   **Comparing coefficients of λ¹:**\n    `2 = -(f₁₁ + f₁₂ + 2f₂₁ - 1)`\n    `-2 = f₁₁ + f₁₂ + 2f₂₁ - 1`\n    `f₁₁ + f₁₂ + 2f₂₁ = -1`  --- (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Comparing coefficients of λ⁰ (the constant term):**\n    `2 = -1 - f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ + 2f₁₂f₂₁ - 2f₂₂ - 2f₁₁f₂₂`\n    `3 = -f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ + 2f₁₂f₂₁ - 2f₂₂ - 2f₁₁f₂₂`  --- (Equation 2)\n\nWe have two equations with four unknowns (`f₁₁`, `f₁₂`, `f₂₁`, `f₂₂`). This means the system is underdetermined, and there are infinite solutions for the matrix `F`. We can find one solution by making a simplifying choice.\n\nLet's assume we only use the first control input, which means the second row of `F` is zero.\nSet `f₂₁ = 0` and `f₂₂ = 0`.\n\nThe equations simplify to:\n*   From Equation 1: `f₁₁ + f₁₂ + 2(0) = -1`  =>  `f₁₁ + f₁₂ = -1`\n*   From Equation 2: `3 = -f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ + 2f₁₂(0) - 2(0) - 2f₁₁(0)`  =>  `3 = -f₁₁ - 2f₁₂`\n\nNow we have a simple system of two linear equations with two unknowns:\n1.  `f₁₁ + f₁₂ = -1`\n2.  `-f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ = 3`\n\nAdd the two equations together:\n`(f₁₁ + f₁₂) + (-f₁₁ - 2f₁₂) = -1 + 3`\n`-f₁₂ = 2`\n`f₁₂ = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f₁₂ = -2` into the first simplified equation:\n`f₁₁ + (-2) = -1`\n`f₁₁ = 1`\n\nSo, a valid state feedback gain matrix is `F` with `f₁₁ = 1`, `f₁₂ = -2`, `f₂₁ = 0`, and `f₂₂ = 0`.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe calculated state feedback gain matrix is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n**Verification**\nLet's check our result.\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1+1, 1-2], [1+1, 0-2]] = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\nThe characteristic polynomial of this matrix is:\n`det(λI - A_cl) = det([[λ, 1], [-2, λ+2]]) = λ(λ+2) - (1)(-2) = λ² + 2λ + 2`\nThe roots of `λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0` are `λ = (-2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)) / 2 = -1 ± j`.\nThe result is correct.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
