    "To find the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve $C$ defined by $z^2=2x^5+2x^3+1$ above 2, we need to analyze its structure over a 2-adic field. Let $v$ be the valuation normalized by $v(2)=1$.\n\n**Step 1: Find a better model for the curve.**\n\nThe given model $C: y^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ has bad reduction modulo 2. The equation becomes $y^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$, which corresponds to a non-reduced special fiber $(y-1)^2=0$. This is not a stable model. To find the stable reduction, we often perform a change of variables to find a model whose special fiber has only ordinary double points.\n\nA standard technique is to change variables to simplify the equation or to analyze the valuations of the roots of the polynomial on the right-hand side. Let $f(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$. A direct analysis of the roots of $f(x)$ using the Newton Polygon leads to contradictions, suggesting that a transformation of the curve is necessary first.\n\nLet's try the substitution $x = x_1/2$. This is a standard transformation to deal with powers of $p$ in the coefficients.\n$y^2 = 2(x_1/2)^5 + 2(x_1/2)^3 + 1$\n$y^2 = 2x_1^5/32 + 2x_1^3/8 + 1$\n$y^2 = x_1^5/16 + x_1^3/4 + 1$\nTo obtain an integral model, we multiply by 16:\n$16y^2 = x_1^5 + 4x_1^3 + 16$\nLet $y_1 = 4y$. The equation becomes:\n$y_1^2 = x_1^5 + 4x_1^3 + 16$\nThis equation gives a new model for our curve over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Let's call this curve $C'$. Its special fiber modulo 2 is $y_1^2 = x_1^5$, which is a highly singular curve (a high-order cusp) but is reduced. This model is more suitable for analysis, although it's not yet stable.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the valuations of the branch points.**\n\nThe stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is determined by the configuration of its branch points, which are the roots of the polynomial on the right-hand side. Let $h(x_1) = x_1^5 + 4x_1^3 + 16$. We analyze the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $h(x_1)=0$. We use the Newton Polygon method with the valuation $v=v_2$. The polynomial $h(x_1)$ is monic. The vertices of its Newton polygon are $(i, v(a_i))$ where $a_i$ is the coefficient of $x_1^i$:\n- Coeff of $x_1^5$: $a_5=1 \\implies v(a_5)=0$. Point: $(5,0)$. This is for the reciprocal polynomial.\nLet's use the standard formulation. For a polynomial $\\sum_{i=0}^n c_i t^i$, the points for the Newton Polygon are $(i, v(c_i))$.\n- $c_5=1 \\implies v(c_5)=0$. Point: $(5,0)$\n- $c_4=0 \\implies v(c_4)=\\infty$.\n- $c_3=4 \\implies v(c_3)=v(2^2)=2$. Point: $(3,2)$\n- $c_2=0 \\implies v(c_2)=\\infty$.\n- $c_1=0 \\implies v(c_1)=\\infty$.\n- $c_0=16 \\implies v(c_0)=v(2^4)=4$. Point: $(0,4)$\n\nThe points for the lower convex hull are $(0,4)$, $(3,2)$, and $(5,0)$.\n- The slope of the segment from $(0,4)$ to $(3,2)$ is $(2-4)/(3-0) = -2/3$. The length of its projection on the x-axis is 3. This indicates 3 roots with valuation $2/3$.\n- The slope of the segment from $(3,2)$ to $(5,0)$ is $(0-2)/(5-3) = -1$. The length of its projection is 2. This indicates 2 roots with valuation $1$.\n\nSo the roots of $h(x_1)=0$ fall into two clusters according to their 2-adic valuations:\n- A cluster $S_1$ of 3 roots with valuation $2/3$.\n- A cluster $S_2$ of 2 roots with valuation $1$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the stable reduction.**\n\nThe stable reduction of the curve will have a special fiber composed of several components, with each component corresponding to a cluster of roots.\n- The cluster $S_1$ has 3 roots. The corresponding component $C_1$ has genus $g_1 = \\lfloor(\\#S_1 - 1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(3-1)/2\\rfloor = 1$. So, $C_1$ is an elliptic curve.\n- The cluster $S_2$ has 2 roots. The corresponding component $C_2$ has genus $g_2 = \\lfloor(\\#S_2 - 1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(2-1)/2\\rfloor = 0$. So, $C_2$ is a rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$).\nThe special fiber of the stable reduction consists of an elliptic curve and a rational curve intersecting at one point, which is an ordinary double point (a node).\n\n**Step 4: Compute the thickness of the double point.**\n\nThe thickness of a node connecting two components is given by $t = m - 1$, where $m$ is the \"length\" of the edge connecting the corresponding vertices in the reduction graph. The length $m$ is an integer that measures the distance between the clusters of roots. For this length to be an integer, we may need to normalize the valuation by passing to a suitable finite extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\nThe root valuations $2/3$ and $1$ are not integers. The smallest integer ramification index $e$ that makes them integers is $e=3$. Let $K$ be a ramified extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ of degree 3. We can normalize the valuation $v_K$ on $K$ such that the uniformizer has valuation 1. This corresponds to $v_K = 3v$.\nThe valuations of the roots in this new valuation are:\n- For roots in $S_1$: $v_K(\\gamma) = 3 \\cdot v(\\gamma) = 3 \\cdot (2/3) = 2$.\n- For roots in $S_2$: $v_K(\\gamma) = 3 \\cdot v(\\gamma) = 3 \\cdot 1 = 3$.\n\nThe length $m$ of the edge between the components is the valuation of the difference between roots from different clusters. For a root $\\gamma_1 \\in S_1$ and $\\gamma_2 \\in S_2$:\n$m = v_K(\\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2) = \\min(v_K(\\gamma_1), v_K(\\gamma_2)) = \\min(2, 3) = 2$.\n\nThe length is $m=2$. The thickness $t$ of the double point is given by the formula $t=m-1$.\n$t = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n\nThe thickness is a non-negative integer, and our calculation gives a valid result."
