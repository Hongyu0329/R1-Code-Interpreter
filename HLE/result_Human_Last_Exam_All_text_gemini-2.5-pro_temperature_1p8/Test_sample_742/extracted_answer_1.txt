No. It is not possible. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics is designed to model physical reality and make probabilistic predictions about measurable quantities. GÃ¶del's proof is a formal argument in modal logic based on axioms about abstract metaphysical concepts like "positive properties" and "necessary existence." There is a fundamental category error, as the concepts and vocabulary of one system cannot be translated into or represented by the mathematical structures of the other.
