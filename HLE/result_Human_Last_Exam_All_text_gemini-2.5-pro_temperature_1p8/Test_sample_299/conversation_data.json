    "Answering this question requires a multi-step analysis, including understanding the properties of the function, constructing a family of solutions, and then using cardinality arguments to find the size of the set of all possible solutions.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Analyze the properties of a function `f` satisfying the equation.**\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. Let $f$ be any function in $S$.\n\n*   **Injectivity:** The function must be injective (one-to-one). Suppose $f(a) = f(b)$. Applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(a)) = f(f(b))$, which means $\\exp(a) = \\exp(b)$. Since the exponential function is injective, we have $a=b$. Thus, $f$ is injective.\n*   **Monotonicity:** A continuous and injective function whose domain is $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n*   **Strictly Increasing:** We can determine whether $f$ is increasing or decreasing.\n    *   If $f$ were strictly decreasing, then for any $x_1 < x_2$, we would have $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$. Applying the decreasing function $f$ again would reverse the inequality, giving $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. This means the composition $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing.\n    *   If $f$ is strictly increasing, then for any $x_1 < x_2$, we have $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$, and applying the increasing function $f$ again gives $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. The composition $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing.\n    *   Since $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is a strictly increasing function, $f$ could be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing based on this test alone.\n    *   However, let's consider the range of $f$. Let $R(f)$ be the range of $f$. The equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ tells us that the range of $f$ when its domain is restricted to $R(f)$ is $(0, \\infty)$. This means that for any $y \\in R(f)$, we must have $f(y) > 0$.\n    *   Now, assume $f$ is strictly decreasing. A strictly decreasing continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must have range $(-\\infty, \\infty)$, i.e., $R(f)=\\mathbb{R}$. If $R(f) = \\mathbb{R}$, then for any $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $f(y)$ must be positive. This is a contradiction, as a decreasing function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must take on negative values (in fact, its limit at $\\infty$ is $-\\infty$).\n    *   Therefore, $f$ must be a strictly increasing function.\n\n**2. Upper Bound for the Cardinality.**\nThe set $S$ contains continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n*   A continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on any dense subset of its domain. Let's use the set of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n*   Consider the map that takes a function $f \\in S$ and maps it to its restriction on $\\mathbb{Q}$, i.e., $\\Psi(f) = f|_{\\mathbb{Q}}$. This map is injective: if two continuous functions agree on all rational numbers, they must be the same function.\n*   This means that the cardinality of $S$, $|S|$, is less than or equal to the cardinality of the set of all functions from $\\mathbb{Q}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, which is $|\\mathbb{R}^{Q}|$.\n*   The cardinality of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\aleph_0$ (countably infinite) and the cardinality of $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n*   The cardinality of $|\\mathbb{R}^{Q}|$ is $\\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   Therefore, we have an upper bound for the cardinality: $|S| \\le \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n**3. Lower Bound for the Cardinality via Construction.**\nWe can construct a family of solutions to show that there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such functions. The construction works by defining a \"seed\" piece of the function on a specific interval, from which the rest of the function is uniquely determined by the given equation.\n\n*   **The Seed:** Choose two real numbers, $a$ and $b$, such that $a < b < e^a$. For example, $a=1, b=2$ works since $1 < 2 < e^1 \\approx 2.718$.\n*   Now, choose any continuous, strictly increasing function $h: [a, b] \\to [b, e^a]$ that satisfies the boundary conditions $h(a)=b$ and $h(b)=e^a$. Let this function $h$ be the definition of $f$ on the interval $[a,b]$.\n*   **Extension of the function:** We can extend this definition to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the equation $f(f(x))=e^x$ and its consequences, like $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$ and $f(x)=f^{-1}(e^x)$.\n    *   For $x \\in [b, e^a]$, we define $f(x) = e^{h^{-1}(x)}$.\n    *   For $x \\in [e^a, e^b]$, we define $f(x) = e^{h(\\ln x)}$.\n    *   This process can be continued to define $f$ on all of $[a, \\infty)$. A similar process using the relation $f(x)=h^{-1}(e^x)$ can be used to define $f$ for all $x<a$. The resulting global function can be shown to be continuous, strictly increasing, and a solution to the original equation.\n*   **Counting the Seeds:** The construction creates a unique solution for each valid choice of a seed function $h$. We need to find the number of possible choices for $h$.\n    *   Let's fix $a=1, b=2$. We are looking for the cardinality of the set of continuous strictly increasing functions from $[1,2]$ to $[2, e]$ with the given endpoints.\n    *   We can create a distinct such function for every real number $c$ in the interval $(2, e)$. For instance, consider the piecewise linear function $h_c(x)$ connecting the points $(1,2)$, $(1.5, c)$, and $(2,e)$. Each different value of $c$ gives a different function $h_c$.\n    *   The set of possible values for $c$ is the interval $(2,e)$, which has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   This shows that there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ different valid seed functions $h$. Each of these generates a distinct global solution $f$.\n*   Therefore, we have a lower bound for the cardinality: $|S| \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion on Cardinality.**\nWe have shown that $|S| \\le \\mathfrak{c}$ and $|S| \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$. By the Cantor-SchrÃ¶der-Bernstein theorem, the cardinality of the set $S$ must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n**Careful Points Summary:**\n*   Proving that $f$ must be strictly increasing is a critical first step that simplifies the problem.\n*   The construction method must be verified to produce a function that is continuous everywhere, which involves checking the function's behavior at the \"seams\" between intervals.\n*   The condition on the seed interval, e.g., $a < b < e^a$, is necessary for the construction of an increasing function.\n*   The final cardinality proof relies on finding both an upper and a lower bound for the size of the set. The upper bound comes from a general property of continuous functions, and the lower bound comes from explicit construction.\n\nThe cardinality is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum, which is the cardinality of the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$>>>"
