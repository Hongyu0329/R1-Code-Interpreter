    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group and the question**\n\n*   **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, is defined by the presentation:\n    $SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n*   The problem specifies a group of size 512. Since $512 = 2^9$, we have $n=9$.\n*   The group is $G = SD_{512}$, with the presentation:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{9-1}} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{9-2}-1} \\rangle$\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A \"power subgroup\" of a group $G$ is a subgroup of the form $G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$ for some positive integer $k$. The question asks for the total number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way. So we need to find the size of the set $\\{ G^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the problem**\n\n*   We need to determine the set of subgroups $\\{G^1, G^2, G^3, \\dots \\}$ and count how many of them are distinct.\n*   Let $k$ be any positive integer. We can write $k = 2^a \\cdot m$, where $m$ is an odd integer and $a \\ge 0$.\n*   A key property is that for any 2-group $H$ (a group where every element's order is a power of 2), and any odd integer $m$, the mapping $x \\mapsto x^m$ is a bijection on $H$. This means that the subgroup generated by all $m$-th powers is the group itself, i.e., $H^m = H$.\n*   Applying this, we get $G^k = G^{2^a \\cdot m} = (G^{2^a})^m$. Since $G^{2^a}$ is a subgroup of the 2-group $G$, it is also a 2-group. Therefore, $(G^{2^a})^m = G^{2^a}$.\n*   This shows that $G^k = G^{2^a}$, where $2^a$ is the largest power of 2 that divides $k$. This significantly simplifies the problem: we only need to count the number of distinct subgroups in the sequence $G^1, G^2, G^4, G^8, \\dots, G^{2^a}, \\dots$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the power subgroups $G^{2^a}$**\n\nThe elements of $G=SD_{512}$ are of two forms: $r^i$ (where $0 \\le i < 256$) and $r^i s$ (where $0 \\le i < 256$). The subgroup $G^{2^a}$ is generated by the $2^a$-th powers of all these elements.\n\n*   **Case a = 0 ($k=1$):**\n    $G^1 = \\langle g^1 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle = G = SD_{512}$.\n    This is our first distinct power subgroup.\n\n*   **Case a â‰¥ 1:**\n    We need to find the generators of $G^{2^a}$.\n    1.  Powers of elements of the form $r^i$: $(r^i)^{2^a} = r^{i \\cdot 2^a}$. The subgroup generated by all these elements for $i=0, \\dots, 255$ is $\\langle r^{2^a} \\rangle$.\n    2.  Powers of elements of the form $r^i s$: We first find the square of such an element. Using the relation $srs = r^{127}$, we have $sr^i s = (srs)^i = (r^{127})^i = r^{127i}$.\n        $(r^i s)^2 = r^i s r^i s = r^i (sr^i s) = r^i (r^{127i}) = r^{128i}$. (Note: $128=2^{9-2}=2^7$).\n        Now we can find the $2^a$-th power for $a \\ge 1$:\n        $(r^i s)^{2^a} = ((r^i s)^2)^{2^{a-1}} = (r^{128i})^{2^{a-1}} = r^{128i \\cdot 2^{a-1}} = r^{i \\cdot 2^7 \\cdot 2^{a-1}} = r^{i \\cdot 2^{a+6}}$.\n        The subgroup generated by all these elements is $\\langle r^{2^{a+6}} \\rangle$.\n\n    Combining these, for $a \\ge 1$, $G^{2^a}$ is generated by the elements of $\\langle r^{2^a} \\rangle$ and $\\langle r^{2^{a+6}} \\rangle$. So, $G^{2^a} = \\langle r^{2^a}, r^{2^{a+6}} \\rangle$.\n    Since $a+6 > a$ for all $a \\ge 1$, the number $2^{a+6}$ is a multiple of $2^a$. This implies that any power of $r^{2^{a+6}}$ is also a power of $r^{2^a}$. Therefore, $\\langle r^{2^{a+6}} \\rangle$ is a subgroup of $\\langle r^{2^a} \\rangle$.\n    This simplifies the generator set, giving us:\n    $G^{2^a} = \\langle r^{2^a} \\rangle$ for all $a \\ge 1$.\n\n**Step 4: List the distinct subgroups and count them**\n\nNow we can list the distinct subgroups by calculating $G^{2^a}$ for increasing values of $a$.\n\n*   $a=0$: $G^1 = SD_{512}$. This is a non-abelian group of order 512.\n*   $a=1$: $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $256/2 = 128$.\n*   $a=2$: $G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $256/4 = 64$.\n*   $a=3$: $G^8 = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $256/8 = 32$.\n*   $a=4$: $G^{16} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $256/16 = 16$.\n*   $a=5$: $G^{32} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $256/32 = 8$.\n*   $a=6$: $G^{64} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $256/64 = 4$.\n*   $a=7$: $G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $256/128 = 2$.\n*   $a=8$: $G^{256} = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\langle r^0 \\rangle = \\{1\\}$. This is the trivial subgroup of order 1.\n*   $a>8$: For any $a > 8$, $2^a$ is a multiple of 256. So, $r^{2^a} = (r^{256})^{2^{a-8}} = 1^{2^{a-8}} = 1$. This means for all $a > 8$, $G^{2^a}$ is also the trivial subgroup $\\{1\\}$. No new subgroups are generated.\n\nLet's list all the unique subgroups we found:\n1.  $SD_{512}$ (order 512)\n2.  $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$ (order 128)\n3.  $\\langle r^4 \\rangle$ (order 64)\n4.  $\\langle r^8 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n5.  $\\langle r^{16} \\rangle$ (order 16)\n6.  $\\langle r^{32} \\rangle$ (order 8)\n7.  $\\langle r^{64} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n8.  $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n9.  $\\{1\\}$ (order 1)\n\nThese 9 subgroups are all distinct. $SD_{512}$ is non-abelian, while the rest are cyclic. The cyclic subgroups are distinguished by their orders, which are all different powers of 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThere are exactly 9 distinct power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512."
