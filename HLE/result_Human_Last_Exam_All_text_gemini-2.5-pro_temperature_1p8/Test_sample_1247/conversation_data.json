    "The question asks for \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), which is the number of permutations of length \\(n=333\\) with exactly \\(k=3\\) inversions that avoid the pattern 1324.\n\nA permutation \\(\\pi\\) avoids the pattern 1324 if there are no indices \\(i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < i_4\\) such that \\(\\pi(i_1) < \\pi(i_3) < \\pi(i_2) < \\pi(i_4)\\).\n\nFor a fixed number of inversions \\(k\\), the number of \\(\\sigma\\)-avoiding permutations of length \\(n\\), \\(av_n^k(\\sigma)\\), is constant for all sufficiently large \\(n\\). Here, \\(n=333\\) is much larger than \\(k=3\\) and the length of the pattern (4), so we can treat \\(n\\) as being large. We can analyze the structure of permutations with 3 inversions and check if they avoid the 1324 pattern.\n\nLet's classify permutations \\(\\pi \\in S_n\\) with 3 inversions. A permutation has 3 inversions if it can be obtained from the identity permutation by a sequence of operations that create 3 pairs of \\((i, j)\\) with \\(i < j\\) and \\(\\pi(i) > \\pi(j)\\). Such permutations must be \"close\" to the identity permutation. Any significant rearrangement of elements far from each other tends to create more than 3 inversions or form a 1324 pattern.\n\nThe structure of a 1324-avoiding permutation forces its inversions to be localized. If a permutation has disjoint \"disturbances\" (sets of elements not in their natural sorted order), they can interact to form a 1324 pattern. For example, a permutation like \\(\\pi = (..., a, ..., c, ...)\\) where \\((a, c)\\) is an inversion, combined with another inversion \\((..., b, ..., d, ...)\\) somewhere else, can easily form the pattern \\(a' < c < b < d'\\) required for 1324. To avoid this, any \"disturbed\" elements must be clustered at the beginning or the end of the permutation.\n\nLet's list the possible structures of permutations with 3 inversions that can avoid the 1324 pattern for large \\(n\\). The disturbances must be at the very beginning or the very end of the permutation.\n\n**Case 1: A single block of disturbed elements**\nThe permutation consists of a block of \\(m\\) permuted elements at one end, and the rest of the elements are fixed.\nLet \\(\\pi = (\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\ldots, \\sigma_m, m+1, m+2, \\ldots, n)\\) where \\(\\sigma\\) is a permutation of \\(\\{1, \\ldots, m\\}\\) with 3 inversions.\nWe need to check which \\(\\sigma \\in S_m\\) with \\(inv(\\sigma)=3\\) don't create a 1324 pattern when extended. A pattern \\(\\pi(i_1) < \\pi(i_3) < \\pi(i_2) < \\pi(i_4)\\) can be formed if we can choose \\(i_1, i_2, i_3 \\in \\{1, \\ldots, m\\}\\) and \\(i_4 > m\\). This is possible if there exist \\(i_1 < i_2 < i_3 \\le m\\) such that \\(\\pi(i_1) < \\pi(i_3) < \\pi(i_2)\\). The element \\(\\pi(i_4)\\) can be any number larger than \\(\\pi(i_2)\\), which is easy to find for large \\(n\\).\nTo avoid the 1324 pattern, the prefix \\(\\sigma\\) must not contain a 132 pattern. Permutations \\(\\sigma\\) avoiding 132 are those for which there are no indices \\(i<j<k\\) with \\(\\sigma(i) < \\sigma(k) < \\sigma(j)\\).\nThe only permutations \\(\\sigma\\) of length \\(m \\le 4\\) with 3 inversions that avoid the 132 pattern are:\n- \\(m=3\\): \\(\\sigma=321\\). inv=3. \\((3,2,1)\\) has no 132 pattern. This gives the permutation \\(\\pi_1 = (3, 2, 1, 4, 5, \\ldots, n)\\). This permutation avoids 1324. (1 permutation)\n- \\(m=4\\): Permutations of \\(\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\) with 3 inversions are 1432, 2413, 3142, 3214, 4123.\n  - \\(1432\\) contains 132 pattern (1,3,2 on indices 1,3,4).\n  - \\(2413\\) contains 132 pattern (2,3,1 on indices 1,4,3). Wait, no, values 2,3,1.\n  - \\(3142\\) contains 132 pattern (1,4,2 on indices 2,3,4).\n  - \\(3214\\) has no 132 pattern.\n  - \\(4123\\) has no 132 pattern.\nThis gives two more permutations:\n- \\(\\pi_2 = (3, 2, 1, 4, 5, \\ldots, n)\\) but 3214 has only 3 invs on 4 elements. The permutation is \\(3214\\). \\(\\pi_2=(3,2,1,4,5,...,n)\\). This is just \\(\\pi_1\\). So we take \\(\\sigma=3214\\). \\(\\pi_2=(3,2,1,4,5,\\dots,n)\\). I used \\(\\sigma=321\\) which has 3 inversions. \\(3214\\) has invs (3,2),(3,1),(2,1) -- 3 invs. Ok. So \\(\\pi_2=(3,2,1,4,5...,n)\\).\n- \\(\\pi_3 = (4, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\ldots, n)\\). (2 permutations total from this type).\n\nSymmetrically, we can place the block at the end: \\(\\pi = (1, 2, \\ldots, n-m, \\sigma'_1, \\ldots, \\sigma'_m)\\), where \\(\\sigma'\\) is a permutation of \\(\\{n-m+1, \\ldots, n\\}\\).\nTo avoid 1324, this requires that no \\(\\pi(j_4)\\) can be found to complete the pattern. This occurs if for any potential \\(i_1<i_2<i_3\\), \\(\\pi(i_2)\\) is the maximum element, \\(n\\).\nSo we need permutations where every inversion involves the value \\(n\\).\n- \\(\\sigma'= (n, n-1, n-2)\\) on \\(\\{n-2, n-1, n\\}\\). The permutation is \\((...,n-3, n, n-1, n-2)\\). All 3 inversions involve \\(n\\). No, \\((n-1,n-2)\\) is an inversion.\nLet's analyze differently. To avoid the pattern, \\(\\sigma'\\) must avoid the 213 pattern (the reverse of 132).\n- \\(\\sigma'=321 \\to (n,n-1,n-2)\\) avoids 213. This gives \\(\\pi_4 = (1, \\ldots, n-3, n, n-1, n-2)\\). (1 permutation)\n- On 4 elements \\(\\{n-3, \\ldots, n\\}\\). We need 213-avoiding perms with 3 inversions. These are the reverses of the 132-avoiding ones: reverse(3214)=4123, reverse(4123)=3214.\n  - \\(\\sigma'\\) is the 4123-pattern on \\(\\{n-3, \\dots, n\\}\\). Values \\((n, n-3, n-2, n-1)\\). \\(\\pi_5 = (1, \\ldots, n-4, n, n-3, n-2, n-1)\\).\n  - \\(\\sigma'\\) is the 3214-pattern on \\(\\{n-3, \\dots, n\\}\\). Values \\((n-1,n-2,n-3,n)\\). Does not avoid 213 pattern (\\((n-1, n-2, n)\\) form a 213).\nSo from single blocks, we get \\(2+2=4\\) permutations:\n1. \\((3,2,1,4, \\ldots, n)\\)\n2. \\((4,1,2,3,5, \\ldots, n)\\)\n3. \\((1, \\ldots, n-3, n,n-1,n-2)\\)\n4. \\((1, \\ldots, n-4, n,n-3,n-2,n-1)\\)\n\n**Case 2: Two disjoint blocks of disturbed elements**\nFor the permutation to have only 3 inversions, the only possibility is one block with 2 inversions and another with 1 inversion.\n- Block 1 (2 inversions): Permuting \\(\\{a, a+1, a+2\\}\\) into \\((a+2, a, a+1)\\) (a `312` pattern) or \\((a+1, a+2, a)\\) (a `231` pattern).\n- Block 2 (1 inversion): Permuting \\(\\{b, b+1\\}\\) into \\((b+1, b)\\) (a `21` pattern).\nTo avoid 1324, these two blocks must be at the two ends of the permutation.\n- **Possibility A:** `312` at the beginning, `21` at the end.\n  The permutation starts with a `312` pattern on \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\), giving \\((3,1,2)\\). It ends with a `21` pattern on \\(\\{n-1, n\\}\\), giving \\((n, n-1)\\).\n  \\(\\pi_5 = (3, 1, 2, 4, \\ldots, n-2, n, n-1)\\).\n  Inversions are: \\((\\pi_1,\\pi_2)=(3,1), (\\pi_1,\\pi_3)=(3,2), (\\pi_{n-1},\\pi_n)=(n,n-1)\\). Total 3. This avoids 1324. (1 permutation)\n- **Possibility B:** `21` at the beginning, `312` at the end.\n  The permutation starts with \\((2,1)\\) and ends with a `312` permutation of \\(\\{n-2, n-1, n\\}\\) which is \\((n, n-2, n-1)\\).\n  \\(\\pi_6 = (2, 1, 3, \\ldots, n-3, n, n-2, n-1)\\).\n  Inversions are: \\((\\pi_1,\\pi_2)=(2,1), (\\pi_{n-2},\\pi_{n-1})=(n,n-2), (\\pi_{n-2},\\pi_n)=(n,n-1)\\). Total 3. This avoids 1324. (1 permutation)\n\nAny other arrangements, like three disjoint `21` blocks, or blocks in the middle of the permutation, will create a 1324 pattern for large \\(n\\).\n\nIn total, we have found \\(4+2=6\\) permutations of length \\(n=333\\) with 3 inversions that avoid the pattern 1324.\n\nFinal list:\n1. \\((3,2,1,4,...,333)\\)\n2. \\((4,1,2,3,5,...,333)\\)\n3. \\((1,2,...,330,333,332,331)\\)\n4. \\((1,2,...,329,333,330,331,332)\\)\n5. \\((3,1,2,4,...,331,333,332)\\)\n6. \\((2,1,3,...,330,333,331,332)\\) -- this one ends in 312 pattern on \\{331,332,333\\}, i.e. (333,331,332). Inversions (333,331), (333,332). Correct.\n\nSo, the total number is 6."
