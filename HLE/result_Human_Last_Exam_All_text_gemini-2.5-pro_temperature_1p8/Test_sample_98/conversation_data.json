    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Shape and its Properties**\nThe tank is in the shape of an icosahedron. An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron, which means all its faces, edges, and angles are identical.\n*   **Faces:** It has 20 faces, and each face is an equilateral triangle.\n*   **Symmetry:** A key property of the icosahedron is that it is centrally symmetric. This means there is a point at its geometric center such that any line passing through this center will intersect the surface of the icosahedron at two points equidistant from the center.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Setup of the Tank**\n*   **Orientation:** The icosahedron is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of its 20 triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base. Because of the icosahedron's symmetry, there is another triangular face on the exact opposite side that is parallel to the base, serving as the top. The vertical axis of the tank is a line passing through the centers of the base and top faces. This is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   **Filling Level:** The tank is \"half-filled with water.\" This means the volume of the water is exactly 50% of the total volume of the icosahedron tank.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Position of the Water Surface**\n*   In a stationary container under gravity, the surface of any liquid, like water, will be a perfectly horizontal plane.\n*   For any centrally symmetric object (like the icosahedron), a plane passing through its geometric center will divide its volume into two equal halves.\n*   Since the tank is half-filled, the water surface must be the horizontal plane that passes directly through the geometric center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Shape of the Water Surface**\nThe shape of the water surface is the shape of the cross-section created when the icosahedron is cut by this central horizontal plane.\n*   **Using Symmetry:** The plane of the water is perpendicular to the vertical axis of the tank. As established in Step 2, this vertical axis is a 3-fold axis of rotational symmetry. Therefore, the shape of the cross-section must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   Additionally, because the plane passes through the icosahedron's center of symmetry (inversion center), the resulting 2D shape must also be centrally symmetric (have 2-fold rotational symmetry).\n*   A planar polygon that has both 3-fold and 2-fold rotational symmetry must have 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   The only convex polygon with 6-fold rotational symmetry is a **regular hexagon**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Distinguish from other orientations:** If the icosahedron were balanced on a vertex instead of a face, the vertical axis would be a 5-fold symmetry axis. The central horizontal cross-section would then be a regular decagon (a 10-sided polygon). The problem explicitly states it is standing on a face.\n2.  **Convexity:** The intersection of a convex solid (like an icosahedron) with a plane is always a convex polygon. This rules out star-shaped polygons like the hexagram.\n3.  **Half-full implies central plane:** This is a crucial connection that relies on the symmetry of the icosahedron. For an irregularly shaped tank, \"half-full\" would not necessarily mean the water level is at the halfway point of its height or at its geometric center.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the symmetry of the icosahedron when stood on a face and the fact that the water fills half its volume, the water surface forms a horizontal plane through the center. This cross-section is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
