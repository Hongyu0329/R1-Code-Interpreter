    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the differences between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Movement - Cambré Derrière\nA cambré is a bend of the body from the waist in any direction. A \"cambré derrière\" specifically refers to a bend backwards. It is a fundamental movement in ballet that tests flexibility, strength, and control of the spine and core.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Vaganova Method for Cambré Derrière\n*   **Core Principle:** The Vaganova method, developed in Russia, emphasizes a holistic and anatomical approach. The primary goal is to create clean, strong lines with a stable foundation.\n*   **Hip Placement:** In a Vaganova cambré derrière, the hips must remain strictly square and directly over the supporting legs. There is no forward thrust or displacement of the pelvis. The dancer must maintain their weight evenly over both feet (or the single supporting foot).\n*   **Initiation of Movement:** The bend originates from the upper back (thoracic spine), lifting the sternum towards the ceiling first. The movement then sequences down the spine. The lower back (lumbar) participates, but it is supported and elongated, not compressed.\n*   **Aesthetic Goal:** The line is one of a pure, unbroken curve from the waist up, while the lower body from the hips down remains a solid, stable base. It emphasizes spinal flexibility and core strength without compromising the vertical alignment of the lower body.\n*   **Head and Arms:** The head follows the line of the spine, looking up and back naturally. The arms (port de bras) are coordinated but the core difference is not in the arm placement itself, but in the torso's action.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Balanchine Method for Cambré Derrière\n*   **Core Principle:** The Balanchine style, developed in America by George Balanchine, is known for its speed, athleticism, and pushing classical lines to their extremes. It often favors a more dynamic, \"off-balance\" aesthetic.\n*   **Hip Placement:** This is the most critical point of divergence. To achieve a deeper and more dramatic backbend, the Balanchine method explicitly teaches dancers to **press their hips forward**. The pelvis moves forward of the vertical axis of the legs.\n*   **Initiation of Movement:** The entire body is involved to create a more extreme shape. The forward press of the hips acts as a cantilever, allowing for a much deeper backward bend.\n*   **Aesthetic Goal:** The result is a more angled, broken line. Instead of a simple curve in the upper body, it's a dramatic sweep of the entire torso and pelvis. This allows for greater visual impact and dynamics.\n*   **Head and Arms:** The head and arm positions are often more stylized to accentuate this extreme line.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Methods and Evaluate the Answer Choices\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there are stylistic differences in port de bras between the two methods, the fundamental mechanical difference in a cambré derrière lies in the torso and hips, not the arms. The arm placement is secondary to the core body action.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the primary and most defining difference. Vaganova demands stable, stacked hips. Balanchine uses a forward-pressed hip. This single technical difference changes the entire mechanic, alignment, and aesthetic of the movement.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine choreography is often faster, a cambré in either technique can be performed at any tempo. Speed is a choreographic choice, not a defining technical element of how the cambré itself is formed.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The backbend is often deeper in the Balanchine style, but this is a *result* of the hip placement. By pressing the hips forward (Choice B), the dancer can achieve a greater degree of backbend (Choice D). Therefore, the hip placement is the *cause*, and the degree of the bend is the *effect*. Choice B is the more fundamental difference.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** Like arm placement, head placement is a stylistic detail that follows the main action of the body. The different line created by the hip placement necessitates a different head placement to complete the picture, but it's not the root cause of the difference.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe most fundamental and critical technical distinction between a Vaganova cambré derrière and a Balanchine cambré derrière is the action of the hips. The Vaganova method insists on keeping the hips stable and vertically aligned, while the Balanchine method uses a forward press of the hips to facilitate a deeper, more dynamic bend.\n\n<<<B>>>"
