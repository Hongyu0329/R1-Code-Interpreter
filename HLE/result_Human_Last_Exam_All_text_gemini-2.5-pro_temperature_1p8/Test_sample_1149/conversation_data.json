    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Anatomical Feature:** The question asks about the \"lacrimal recess\" in the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*. The lacrimal is a bone in the skull that sits between the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the prefrontal/frontal bones, typically forming the anterior (front) margin of the eye socket and the posterior (rear) margin of the antorbital fenestra (a large opening in front of the eye). The lacrimal recess is a depression or fossa on the surface of this bone, usually within the larger antorbital fossa.\n\n2.  **Consult the Primary Scientific Literature:** To answer a specific anatomical question about a fossil species, we must refer to the primary scientific paper that describes it. The most detailed description of the *Irritator challengeri* holotype skull (specimen number SMNS 58022) is in the paper:\n    *   Sues, H.-D., Frey, E., Martill, D. M., & Scott, D. M. (2002). *Irritator challengeri*, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil. *Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology*, 22(3), 535-547.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Description of the Lacrimal Bone:** In this paper, the authors provide a detailed description of each bone in the skull. When describing the lacrimal, they note the presence of the lacrimal recess on its lateral (outward-facing) surface.\n\n4.  **Find the Specific Detail about Depressions:** The key information is found in the description of this recess. The authors state that the deep, pocket-like lacrimal recess is **\"subdivided by a vertical lamina of bone into a smaller, anterodorsal and a larger, posteroventral depression.\"**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The single anatomical feature known as the lacrimal recess is internally divided by a thin wall of bone (a lamina). This division creates two smaller, distinct depressions within the larger recess.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Primary Source is Crucial:** The answer relies entirely on the published description of the only known skull of *Irritator*. Anatomical interpretations can change, but this is the established scientific description.\n*   **Anatomical Terminology:** It's important to understand the difference between the \"lacrimal recess\" as a whole feature and the \"depressions\" it contains. The question specifically asks for the number of depressions *within* the recess.\n*   **Specific Species:** This anatomical detail is specific to *Irritator challengeri*. Other spinosaurids or theropods might have a different configuration (e.g., a single, undivided recess or more subdivisions).\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* contains two depressions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
