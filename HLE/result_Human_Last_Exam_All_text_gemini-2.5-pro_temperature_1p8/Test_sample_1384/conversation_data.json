    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$.\n\n**Step 1: Set up the problem using logarithms**\n\nLet our number be $x = e^{-7^{13}}$. To find its first non-zero digits, we should analyze its base-10 logarithm. The decimal representation of $x$ will be of the form $0.00...d_1d_2...$, where $d_1$ is the first non-zero digit. We can express $x$ in scientific notation as $y \\times 10^{-k}$, where $1 \\le y < 10$ and $k$ is a positive integer. The digits of $y$ will be the non-zero digits of $x$. Our goal is to find the first two digits of $y$, which means we want to find the value of $\\lfloor 10y \\rfloor$.\n\nLet's take the base-10 logarithm of $x$:\n$\\log_{10}(x) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}})$\nUsing the logarithm power rule, $\\log(a^b) = b \\log(a)$, we get:\n$\\log_{10}(x) = -7^{13} \\log_{10}(e)$\n\nLet $Z = 7^{13} \\log_{10}(e)$. Then $\\log_{10}(x) = -Z$.\nWe can write $-Z$ as the sum of its integer and fractional parts. Let $I = \\lfloor Z \\rfloor$ and $f = \\{Z\\} = Z - I$.\n$\\log_{10}(x) = -I - f$\nTo have a positive fractional part for the logarithm, we rewrite this as:\n$\\log_{10}(x) = -(I+1) + (1-f)$\n\nNow, we can find $x$ by taking the antilogarithm:\n$x = 10^{\\log_{10}(x)} = 10^{-(I+1) + (1-f)} = 10^{1-f} \\times 10^{-(I+1)}$\n\nComparing this with $x = y \\times 10^{-k}$, we can identify:\n$y = 10^{1-f} = 10^{1-\\{Z\\}}$\n$k = I+1 = \\lfloor Z \\rfloor + 1$\n\nThe value of $y$ will be between $1$ and $10$, since $0 \\le \\{Z\\} < 1$ implies $0 < 1-\\{Z\\} \\le 1$, and thus $1 < y \\le 10$. If $\\{Z\\}=0$, $y=10$. If $\\{Z\\} \\neq 0$, then $1 < y < 10$.\nWe need to calculate the value of $y$. This requires computing $Z = 7^{13} \\log_{10}(e)$ with high precision.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the numerical value of $Z = 7^{13} \\log_{10}(e)$**\n\nThis step involves two main components: calculating the integer $N=7^{13}$ and using a high-precision value for the constant $\\log_{10}(e)$.\n\n*   **Calculate $N = 7^{13}$:**\n    $7^2 = 49$\n    $7^4 = 49^2 = 2401$\n    $7^8 = 2401^2 = 5,764,801$\n    $7^{12} = 7^8 \\times 7^4 = 5,764,801 \\times 2401 = 13,841,287,201$\n    $7^{13} = 7^{12} \\times 7 = 13,841,287,201 \\times 7 = 96,889,010,407$\n\n*   **Determine the required precision for $\\log_{10}(e)$:**\n    The value we need is $y=10^{1-\\{Z\\}}$. To determine the first two digits of $y$, we need the exponent $1-\\{Z\\}$ to be accurate to about 3-4 decimal places. This means we need to know the fractional part of $Z$, $\\{Z\\}$, with similar accuracy. The error in $Z$ is approximately $N \\times (\\text{error in } \\log_{10}(e))$. Since $N \\approx 10^{11}$, to get the fractional part of $Z$ accurate to $10^{-4}$, we need the error in $\\log_{10}(e)$ to be less than $10^{-4} / 10^{11} = 10^{-15}$.\n    We'll use a high-precision value for $\\log_{10}(e)$:\n    $\\log_{10}(e) = \\frac{1}{\\ln(10)} \\approx 0.4342944819032518...$\n\n*   **Calculate $Z$ and its fractional part:**\n    $Z = 96,889,010,407 \\times 0.4342944819032518...$\n    This multiplication requires a high-precision calculator. Performing the multiplication gives:\n    $Z \\approx 42080517782.3533722288...$\n\nFrom this, we extract the integer and fractional parts of $Z$:\n$\\lfloor Z \\rfloor = 42,080,517,782$\n$\\{Z\\} \\approx 0.3533722288$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate $y$ and find its first two digits**\n\nNow we compute the value of $y$:\n$y = 10^{1-\\{Z\\}} = 10^{1 - 0.3533722288...} = 10^{0.6466277712...}$\n\nTo find the first two digits of $y$, we need to find which two-digit number `d` satisfies $d/10 \\le y < (d+1)/10$. This is equivalent to finding the value of $\\lfloor 10y \\rfloor$. We can do this by comparing $\\log_{10}(y)$ with the logarithms of numbers like 4.1, 4.2, etc.\n$\\log_{10}(y) = 0.6466277712...$\n\nLet's use some known logarithm values for comparison:\n$\\log_{10}(4) = 2 \\log_{10}(2) \\approx 2 \\times 0.30103 = 0.60206$\n$\\log_{10}(5) = \\log_{10}(10/2) = 1 - \\log_{10}(2) \\approx 1 - 0.30103 = 0.69897$\nSince $0.60206 < \\log_{10}(y) < 0.69897$, we know that $4 < y < 5$. The first digit of $y$ is 4.\n\nTo find the second digit, we check values between 4 and 5:\n$\\log_{10}(4.4) = \\log_{10}(44/10) = \\log_{10}(4.4) \\approx 0.64345$\n$\\log_{10}(4.5) = \\log_{10}(9/2) = 2\\log_{10}(3) - \\log_{10}(2) \\approx 2 \\times 0.47712 - 0.30103 = 0.95424 - 0.30103 = 0.65321$\n\nWe have:\n$\\log_{10}(4.4) \\approx 0.64345$\n$\\log_{10}(y) \\approx 0.64663$\n$\\log_{10}(4.5) \\approx 0.65321$\n\nSince $0.64345 < 0.64663 < 0.65321$, it follows that $4.4 < y < 4.5$.\nThis means the decimal representation of $y$ starts with $4.4...$.\n\nThe first non-zero digit of $e^{-7^{13}}$ is the first digit of $y$, which is 4.\nThe second non-zero digit of $e^{-7^{13}}$ is the second digit of $y$, which is 4.\n\nThe first two non-zero digits are 4 and 4."
