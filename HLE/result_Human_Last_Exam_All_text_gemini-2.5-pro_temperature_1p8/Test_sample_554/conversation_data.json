    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the term \"perfluoronanocar\".**\n\n*   **Nanocar:** This refers to a specific, well-known molecule designed and synthesized by the research group of Professor James Tour at Rice University. It is a single molecule designed to resemble a macroscopic car, with a chassis, axles, and wheels.\n*   **Perfluoro-:** This is a standard prefix in organic chemistry. It means \"fully fluorinated,\" indicating that all hydrogen (H) atoms in the parent molecule have been replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.\n\nThe question is a hypothetical exercise asking us to take the known structure of a Nanocar and determine how many fluorine atoms it would have if it were perfluorinated.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the chemical structure and formula of the standard Nanocar.**\n\nTo determine the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluorinated version, we must first know the number of hydrogen atoms in the original Nanocar. The most iconic and widely referenced Nanocar is the one reported in 2005.\n\n*   **Chassis and Axles:** The \"body\" of the car, which includes the chassis and axles, is a complex organic structure. This part of the molecule contains all the hydrogen atoms. Its chemical formula is **C₂₄₄H₁₃₂**.\n*   **Wheels:** The wheels of the Nanocar are four fullerene molecules, specifically buckminsterfullerene, which has the formula **C₆₀**. Fullerenes are composed solely of carbon atoms and have no hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in a single Nanocar molecule.**\n\nWe combine the components to get the formula for the complete Nanocar.\n\n*   Number of hydrogens from the chassis/axles = 132\n*   Number of hydrogens from the four C₆₀ wheels = 4 x 0 = 0\n*   **Total number of hydrogen atoms in one Nanocar molecule = 132 + 0 = 132.**\n\nThe full chemical formula of the standard Nanocar is C(₂₄₄ + 4*₆₀)H₁₃₂ = **C₄₈₄H₁₃₂**.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the \"perfluoro-\" rule to find the number of fluorine atoms.**\n\nThe process of perfluorination involves replacing every hydrogen atom with a fluorine atom. The carbon skeleton remains the same.\n\n*   Original number of hydrogen atoms = 132\n*   In the perfluoronanocar, each of these 132 hydrogen atoms would be replaced by one fluorine atom.\n*   Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluoronanocar is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original Nanocar.\n\n**Number of fluorine atoms = 132.**\n\nThe hypothetical formula for the perfluoronanocar would be C₄₈₄F₁₃₂.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correct Identification of the Molecule:** It is crucial to identify the correct \"Nanocar\" structure, as several \"nanovehicles\" exist. The analysis relies on the widely recognized 2005 Nanocar with C₆₀ wheels.\n2.  **Understanding of Chemical Nomenclature:** A precise understanding of the prefix \"perfluoro-\" is essential. It specifically means the substitution of all hydrogen atoms with fluorine atoms, not any other type of atomic replacement.\n3.  **Atom Counting:** Careful accounting of atoms in each component (chassis/axles vs. wheels) is necessary. The key is recognizing that the fullerene wheels contain no hydrogen.\n4.  **Hypothetical Nature:** The question is hypothetical. The actual synthesis of a perfluoronanocar would be extremely challenging, if not impossible, due to steric hindrance and altered chemical properties. The question, however, is purely a structural and stoichiometric one.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.  Parent Molecule: Nanocar (C₄₈₄H₁₃₂)\n2.  Number of Hydrogen Atoms (H): 132\n3.  Perfluorination: Replace every H with an F.\n4.  Number of Fluorine Atoms (F) in perfluoronanocar: 132\n\n<<<132>>>"
