    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe core of the question requires identifying two pieces of information:\n*   The **first book of the Bible**, following the standard canonical order, that is mentioned by its actual name within a Shakespeare play.\n*   The **name of the Shakespeare play** in which this first mention occurs.\n\n**2. List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Canonical Order:** The order of the books of the Bible must follow the Protestant canon, which was the standard in Elizabethan and Jacobean England (e.g., the Geneva Bible, the Bishops' Bible, and later the King James Version). The order begins with Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 & 2 Samuel, etc.\n*   **Mentioned by Name:** This is the most critical constraint. The analysis must find the explicit *name* of the biblical book (e.g., \"Genesis,\" \"Exodus,\" \"Psalms\"). Simply alluding to a story or character from a book (like Adam and Eve from Genesis, or Samson from Judges) does not count.\n*   **Distinguishing Common Words:** Several biblical book titles are also common English words (e.g., Numbers, Judges, Kings, Proverbs). It is essential to verify from the context that Shakespeare is referring to the biblical book and not just the common meaning of the word. For instance, the word \"numbers\" appears hundreds of times in Shakespeare, but always in the context of counting or poetry, never as a reference to the Book of Numbers.\n*   **Systematic Search:** The correct method is to proceed through the books of the Bible one by one, in canonical order, and search for their names within Shakespeare's complete works. The very first book for which a match is found is the answer.\n\n**3. Acquiring the Final Answer**\n\n*   **Step 1: Begin with the first book, Genesis.**\n    A search of Shakespeare's complete works shows that while characters and stories from Genesis are mentioned frequently (Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel, Noah's flood), the word \"Genesis\" itself does not appear.\n*   **Step 2: Proceed through the next books in the canon.**\n    A search for \"Exodus,\" \"Leviticus,\" \"Numbers\" (as the book title), \"Deuteronomy,\" \"Joshua,\" \"Judges\" (as the book title), \"Ruth,\" \"Samuel,\" \"Kings\" (as the book title), \"Chronicles\" (as the biblical books), \"Ezra,\" \"Nehemiah,\" \"Esther,\" and \"Job\" reveals no direct mention of these books by name in any of Shakespeare's plays.\n*   **Step 3: Arrive at the Book of Psalms.**\n    This is the first book in the canonical order where we find a direct mention.\n    *   In ***The Merry Wives of Windsor*** (Act 2, Scene 1), Mistress Ford complains that Falstaff's professions of piety and his actual behavior \"do no more adhere and keep pace together than the **Hundredth Psalm** to the tune of 'Green Sleeves.'\" This is an undeniable reference to a specific text within the Book of Psalms.\n    *   An even more direct reference to the book itself appears in ***2 Henry IV*** (Act 2, Scene 4). Speaking of Doll Tearsheet, Poins notes that she has some pretense of piety: \"She has a **book of Psalms** or two to her name...\" This explicitly names the book.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nHaving checked the biblical books in canonical order, the first one to be named is the **Book of Psalms**. It is mentioned in several plays, with clear and direct references found in both *The Merry Wives of Windsor* and *2 Henry IV*. The latter provides the most unambiguous mention of the text as a collected book.\n\n***\n\nThe first book in the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name is the **Book of Psalms**, which is mentioned in the play ***2 Henry IV***."
