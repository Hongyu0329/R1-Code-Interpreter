    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide. The stereochemistry (1S, 2R) on adjacent carbons (C1, C2) indicates that the bromine and methyl groups are *cis* to each other.\n    *   **Reagent and Solvent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) in tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH). Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. Tert-butyl alcohol is a polar aprotic solvent.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:**\n    The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction. Substitution reactions (SN1, SN2) are disfavored. SN2 is hindered by the bulky base. SN1 is disfavored because a strong base is present.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Conformational Requirements for E2 Reaction:**\n    The E2 elimination mechanism requires a specific stereochemical arrangement: the leaving group (Bromine) and a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon (a β-hydrogen) must be in an **anti-periplanar** configuration. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means the leaving group and the β-hydrogen must both be in **axial** positions and on opposite sides of the ring (one pointing up, one pointing down). This is often called a *trans-diaxial* arrangement.\n\n4.  **Draw and Analyze the Chair Conformations of the Substrate:**\n    Since the substrate is a *cis*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, it exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations:\n    *   **Conformation A:** The substituent on C1 is axial (a), and the substituent on C2 is equatorial (e). In our case: Br is axial, and the CH₃ group is equatorial.\n    *   **Conformation B:** The substituent on C1 is equatorial (e), and the substituent on C2 is axial (a). In our case: Br is equatorial, and the CH₃ group is axial.\n\n5.  **Identify the Reactive Conformation:**\n    For the E2 reaction to occur, the bromine atom must be in an axial position. Therefore, the reaction must proceed through **Conformation A (Br-axial, CH₃-equatorial)**. The molecule must adopt this conformation to react, even if it's the less stable one.\n    *   *Note on stability:* The A-value (a measure of steric strain for an axial substituent) of a methyl group (~1.7 kcal/mol) is much larger than that of a bromine atom (~0.4-0.6 kcal/mol). The most stable conformer is the one that places the bulkier group (methyl) in the equatorial position. Thus, Conformation A is not only the reactive conformer but also the more stable, major conformer at equilibrium.\n\n6.  **Identify Possible Elimination Pathways (Regiochemistry):**\n    In the reactive conformer (Br-axial, CH₃-equatorial), we need to find all β-hydrogens that are also axial. The β-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2:** The methyl group is equatorial, which means the hydrogen on C2 is **axial**. This axial hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1. Abstraction of this proton would lead to a double bond between C1 and C2, forming **1-methylcyclohexene**.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is equatorial, and one is **axial**. This axial hydrogen is also anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1. Abstraction of this proton would lead to a double bond between C1 and C6, forming **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n7.  **Apply Zaitsev's and Hofmann's Rules to Determine the Major Product:**\n    We have two possible products. The regioselectivity is determined by the nature of the base.\n    *   **Zaitsev's Rule:** Predicts the formation of the more substituted (more stable) alkene. This would be **1-methylcyclohexene** (a trisubstituted alkene). This rule applies for small, non-hindered bases (e.g., ethoxide).\n    *   **Hofmann's Rule:** Predicts the formation of the less substituted (less sterically hindered) alkene. This rule applies for bulky, sterically hindered bases like **potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK)**. This would be **3-methylcyclohexene** (a disubstituted alkene).\n    The reason for Hofmann selectivity is that the bulky base can more easily access the sterically less hindered β-proton.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** The axial proton on C2 is sterically shielded by the equatorial methyl group on the same carbon. The axial proton on C6 is relatively unhindered.\n    *   Therefore, the bulky t-BuO⁻ base will preferentially abstract the proton from C6.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    The reaction is an E2 elimination that proceeds via the conformer with an axial bromine. Due to the use of the bulky base potassium tert-butoxide, the reaction will favor the abstraction of the less sterically hindered β-proton (on C6). This leads to the formation of the less substituted alkene, the Hofmann product.\n\nThe product formed is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
