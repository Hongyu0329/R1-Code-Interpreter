    "This is a question of counterfactual historical linguistics. To determine the hypothetical modern word, we need to identify the original Old English word and apply the known sound changes that occurred between Old English and Modern English.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the current word's origin.**\n    The modern English word \"sister\" is a borrowing from Old Norse. During the Viking Age (roughly 8th to 11th centuries), extensive contact and settlement in parts of England (the Danelaw) led to Old Norse words entering the English language. \"Sister\" comes from the Old Norse word `systir`.\n\n2.  **Identify the original Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word.**\n    Before the Norse influence became dominant, the native word for \"sister\" in Old English was `sweoster`. This word and the Old Norse `systir` are \"cognates,\" meaning they both evolved from the same ancestor word in an earlier language, in this case, Proto-Germanic (`*swestēr`). The existence of this native word is key to our analysis. Other Germanic languages show similar forms, like German `Schwester` and Dutch `zuster`.\n\n3.  **Trace the hypothetical phonological development of `sweoster`.**\n    If the Norse word `systir` had not replaced `sweoster`, the Old English word would have undergone the natural sound changes that transformed Old English into Middle and then Modern English.\n    *   **The Vowel `eo`:** The most crucial change affects the vowel diphthong `eo` in `sweoster`. In the transition to Middle English, the short `eo` diphthong most regularly simplified to a short `e` (pronounced /ɛ/). We can see this exact change in other words:\n        *   Old English `seofon` became `seven`.\n        *   Old English `heofon` became `heven` (heaven).\n        *   Following this primary pattern, `sweoster` would have become `swester` in Middle English.\n    *   **The Final Syllable:** In Old English, many nouns of relation ended in `-or` or `-ur` (e.g., `mōdor`, `brōþor`, `sweoster`). In unstressed final syllables, this ending regularly weakened to `-er` (pronounced /ər/) in Middle English. We see this in `mother` and `brother`. Thus, the `-or` ending of `sweoster` would have become `-er`.\n    *   **Combining these changes:** The Old English `sweoster` would have evolved into the Middle English form `swester`.\n\n4.  **Trace the development from Middle English to Modern English.**\n    The hypothetical Middle English word `swester` (pronounced /ˈswɛstər/) would have been phonologically stable. The Great Vowel Shift, the series of sound changes that marks the biggest difference between Middle and Modern English pronunciation, primarily affected long vowels. The vowel `e` (/ɛ/) in `swester` is short, positioned before a consonant cluster (`-st-`), so it would not have been affected by this shift. Therefore, the pronunciation would have remained largely the same into the modern era.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **An Alternative Development:** One could point to the word `sword` (from Old English `sweord`) where the `eo` was rounded by the preceding `w` to become `o`. This could suggest an alternative path to `swoster`. However, the change in `sword` is less regular than the `eo` > `e` shift seen in words like `seven`. The parallel with `seven` and the evidence from the German cognate `Schwester` (which retains a front vowel) make `swester` the far more probable outcome.\n*   **Loss of \"w\":** In some related languages like Dutch (`zuster`), the `w` was lost. This did not happen in English words starting with `sw-` (e.g., `swim`, `sweet`), so we can confidently assume the `w` would have been retained.\n*   **Final Spelling:** The spelling would most likely have been regularized to match its pronunciation, resulting in the modern spelling `swester`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the most regular and well-documented sound changes from Old English to Modern English, the native word `sweoster` would have evolved into `swester`.\n\n<<<swester>>>"
