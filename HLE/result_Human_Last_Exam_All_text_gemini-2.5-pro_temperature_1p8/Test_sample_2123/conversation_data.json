    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core components are:\n    *   **Language:** A Russian translation of an essay.\n    *   **Subject:** The surname of an English poet.\n    *   **Context:** A description of the wide boulevards of Vienna.\n    *   **The Crux:** The surname itself is part of the description, not just a passing mention of a person. This suggests a specific literary allusion or a play on words.\n\n2.  **Identify the Author and Work:** The question alludes to a well-known passage from the essays of the Russian-American poet and Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky. Brodsky often wrote about cities, and his essays are famous for their dense, allusive style. The city in question is Vienna.\n\n3.  **Identify the Poet:** The poet Brodsky refers to is W. H. Auden. There are several important connections:\n    *   Brodsky deeply admired Auden, considering him one of the greatest poets of the 20th century. He even wrote a famous elegy, \"Verses on the Death of W. H. Auden.\"\n    *   Crucially, Auden spent the final years of his life in a house in Kirchstetten, a town near Vienna, and he is buried there. This makes the connection between Auden and Vienna very strong and personal for Brodsky.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Specific Phrase:** In his writings, while reflecting on the vast, imposing, and somewhat empty scale of Vienna's architecture, Brodsky makes a direct comparison. The phrase in the Russian text is: \"широки, как проспект Одена\" (shiroki, kak prospekt Odena).\n\n5.  **Interpret the Phrase:**\n    *   A direct translation is \"as wide as an Auden avenue\" or \"as wide as the prospect of Auden.\"\n    *   The Russian word \"проспект\" (prospekt) cleverly means both \"a wide, straight street/avenue\" (like a boulevard) and \"prospect\" (in the sense of a view, outlook, or vista).\n    *   Brodsky is not just saying the boulevards are physically wide. He is making a sophisticated literary allusion. He equates the physical grandeur and scale of Vienna's boulevards with the intellectual and poetic \"prospect\" or stature of W. H. Auden, the great poet who chose this region as his final home. The emptiness of the space also reflects themes present in Auden's later work.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The surname that appears in the description of Vienna's wide boulevards in the Russian translation of Brodsky's essay is that of the English poet W. H. Auden.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The connection is not a simple pun where the surname sounds like a descriptive Russian word. It's a deep literary allusion based on a real-life connection between the poet and the location.\n*   Knowing the relationship between Brodsky and Auden is key to understanding the reference.\n*   The dual meaning of the Russian word \"проспект\" (prospekt) adds a layer of depth to Brodsky's observation, making the allusion particularly fitting.\n\n<<<Auden>>>"
