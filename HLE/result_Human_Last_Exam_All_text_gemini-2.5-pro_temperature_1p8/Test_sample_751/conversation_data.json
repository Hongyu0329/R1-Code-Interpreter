    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form and find the new matrix C.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and the Duality Principle**\nWe are given a discrete-time system defined by matrices A and C:\nx(k+1) = Ax(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nwith:\nA = [[1, 1, 0],\n     [2, 1, 1],\n     [0, 2, 0]]\n\nC = [[0, 1, 0],\n     [1, 1, 0]]\n\nWe need to find a state transformation z(k) = Px(k) that converts the system into observer canonical form. The new system will be:\nz(k+1) = A_o z(k)\ny(k) = C_o z(k)\nwhere A_o = PAP⁻¹ and C_o = CP⁻¹. The question asks for the value of the new matrix C_o.\n\nThe duality principle connects observability with controllability. A system (A, C) is observable if and only if its dual system (Aᵀ, Cᵀ) is controllable. The structure of the observer canonical form of (A, C) is dual to the structure of the controllable canonical form of (Aᵀ, Cᵀ). This principle guides the method for finding the canonical form, which is based on observability indices, the duals of controllability indices.\n\n**Step 2: Check for Observability**\nA system can be transformed into observer canonical form only if it is observable. The observability of the system (A, C) is determined by the rank of the observability matrix, O.\nO = [C; CA; CA²; ... ; CAⁿ⁻¹]\nwhere n is the dimension of the state vector x (n=3).\n\nLet's compute the matrices C and CA:\nC = [[0, 1, 0],\n     [1, 1, 0]]\n\nCA = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\n   = [[(0*1+1*2+0*0), (0*1+1*1+0*2), (0*0+1*1+0*0)],\n      [(1*1+1*2+0*0), (1*1+1*1+0*2), (1*0+1*1+0*0)]]\n   = [[2, 1, 1],\n      [3, 2, 1]]\n\nThe observability matrix is:\nO = [C; CA] = [[0, 1, 0],\n                 [1, 1, 0],\n                 [2, 1, 1],\n                 [3, 2, 1]]\n\nThe rank of O must be n=3 for the system to be observable. We can check the rank by taking the first 3 rows:\ndet([[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1]]) = 0 - 1*(1*1 - 0*2) + 0 = -1 ≠ 0.\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the rank of this 3x3 submatrix is 3. Therefore, the rank of O is 3, and the system is observable.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the Transformation Matrix**\nThe transformation matrix `P` is constructed from the first `n` linearly independent rows of the observability matrix `O`. Let's denote the rows of C as c₁ and c₂:\nc₁ = [0, 1, 0]\nc₂ = [1, 1, 0]\n\nThe rows of O, in order, are c₁, c₂, c₁A, c₂A, ...\nWe select the first n=3 linearly independent rows:\n1. Row 1: c₁ = [0, 1, 0] (LI)\n2. Row 2: c₂ = [1, 1, 0] (LI with row 1)\n3. Row 3: c₁A = [2, 1, 1] (LI with rows 1 and 2, as shown by the non-zero determinant in Step 2)\n\nThese three rows form the transformation matrix `P`:\nP = [[0, 1, 0],\n     [1, 1, 0],\n     [2, 1, 1]]\n\n**Step 4: Find the Inverse of the Transformation Matrix**\nThe state transformation is z = Px, which means the new system matrices are related by A_o = PAP⁻¹ and C_o = CP⁻¹. We need to compute P⁻¹.\nThe determinant of P is det(P) = -1.\n\nThe matrix of cofactors is:\nCof(P) = [[ (1*1 - 0*1), -(1*1 - 0*2),  (1*1 - 1*2)],\n          [-(1*1 - 0*1),  (0*1 - 0*2), -(0*1 - 1*2)],\n          [ (1*0 - 1*0), -(0*0 - 0*1),  (0*1 - 1*1)]]\n       = [[ 1, -1, -1],\n          [-1,  0,  2],\n          [ 0,  0, -1]]\n\nThe adjugate matrix is the transpose of the cofactor matrix:\nadj(P) = [[ 1, -1,  0],\n          [-1,  0,  0],\n          [-1,  2, -1]]\n\nThe inverse matrix is P⁻¹ = (1/det(P)) * adj(P):\nP⁻¹ = (1/-1) * [[ 1, -1,  0], [-1,  0,  0], [-1,  2, -1]]\n    = [[-1,  1,  0],\n       [ 1,  0,  0],\n       [ 1, -2,  1]]\n\n**Step 5: Compute the New C Matrix (C_o)**\nThe new C matrix in the observer canonical form is C_o = CP⁻¹.\nC = [[0, 1, 0],\n     [1, 1, 0]]\nP⁻¹ = [[-1, 1, 0],\n       [ 1, 0, 0],\n       [ 1,-2, 1]]\n\nC_o = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[-1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, -2, 1]]\n    = [[(0*-1 + 1*1 + 0*1), (0*1 + 1*0 + 0*-2), (0*0 + 1*0 + 0*1)],\n       [(1*-1 + 1*1 + 0*1), (1*1 + 1*0 + 0*-2), (1*0 + 1*0 + 0*1)]]\n    = [[1, 0, 0],\n       [0, 1, 0]]\n\nThe new matrix C is [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]]. This is a standard observer canonical form where the first two state variables of the new system are the system outputs y₁(k) and y₂(k).\n\nFinal Answer: The value of the new matrix C is [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]].\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]]>>>"
