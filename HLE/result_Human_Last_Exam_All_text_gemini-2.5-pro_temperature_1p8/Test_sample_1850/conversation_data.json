    "Answering this question requires a careful step-by-step analysis of the term \"historical saint\" and a thorough search of John Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Step 1: Defining \"Historical Saint\" in the Context of Milton\n\nThe first crucial point is to define what \"historical saint\" means for the purpose of this question. Milton was a devout Puritan with strong anti-Catholic sentiments. He was highly critical of the Catholic Church's veneration of saints, which he considered a form of idolatry. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that he would mention saints from the post-Apostolic Catholic tradition (like St. Augustine or St. Francis) in a positive or even neutral light.\n\nA \"historical saint\" can be defined as a figure from history who is recognized as a saint by major Christian traditions. For Milton, history is fundamentally salvation history as recorded in the Bible. Therefore, our search should focus on figures from the Old and New Testaments who are named in the poem and are also considered saints.\n\n### Step 2: The Conspicuous Absence of New Testament Saints\n\nA careful reading of *Paradise Lost* reveals a deliberate and significant omission. Milton **does not mention by name** the most prominent saints of the New Testament.\n*   **The Virgin Mary:** She is central to the story of the incarnation, which is prophesied in Book XII. However, Milton refers to her only allusively as \"a pure Virgin\" or \"the Virgin,\" consciously avoiding her name to sidestep Marian devotion.\n*   **The Apostles:** Figures like Saint Peter and Saint Paul are foundational to the Christian church. Milton alludes to their work and the authority claimed by their successors (particularly criticizing the Papacy's claim to be the heir of Peter), but he never once mentions them by name.\n\nThis omission is a key part of Milton's theological argument: he is pointing the reader away from venerating human figures and towards the sole authority of Christ and Scripture.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying Named Old Testament Saints\n\nWhile Milton omits New Testament saints, he freely names major figures from the Old Testament as part of Michael's narration of future history in Books XI and XII. Many of these figures are considered saints in Catholic, Orthodox, and other traditions.\n\n1.  **Abel:** Mentioned as the first righteous man whose sacrifice is accepted and who becomes the first martyr (Book XI).\n2.  **Enoch:** Described as the righteous man who \"walked with God\" and was translated to Heaven without dying (Book XI).\n3.  **Noah:** Named as \"the one just man alive\" who is saved from the Flood (Book XI).\n4.  **Abraham:** Named as the faithful patriarch and \"Father of the faithful\" (Book XII).\n5.  **Moses:** Named as the great lawgiver who leads the Israelites out of Egypt (mentioned in Book I and Book XII).\n6.  **Joshua:** Named as the successor to Moses who leads the people into the promised land (Book XII).\n7.  **David:** Named as the great king from whose line the Messiah will come (Book XII).\n\nThese seven figures are all part of biblical history and are venerated as saints.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying Named Angelic Saints\n\nThe plot of *Paradise Lost* features several angels as main characters. The archangels are explicitly referred to as \"saints\" in many Christian traditions (e.g., Saint Michael).\n\n8.  **Michael:** The warrior archangel who leads God's army and later serves as Adam's guide to future history (Books VI, XI, XII).\n9.  **Gabriel:** The chief of the angelic guard in Paradise (Book IV).\n10. **Raphael:** The \"sociable spirit\" sent to warn and instruct Adam (Books V-VIII).\n11. **Uriel:** The \"regent of the Sun\" who is tricked by Satan but later reports his presence (Book III).\n\nThese four angels are historical in the context of the poem's biblical narrative and are undeniably saints in Christian tradition.\n\n### Step 5: Final Tally\n\nBy combining the Old Testament figures and the archangels who are mentioned by name in the poem and are considered saints, we arrive at a final count.\n\n*   **7 Old Testament Saints:** Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Joshua, David.\n*   **4 Angelic Saints:** Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel.\n\nThe total number of historical saints mentioned by name is 7 + 4 = 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
