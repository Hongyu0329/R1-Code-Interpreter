    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Problem\nLet the new sequence be `y(n)`. It is formed by interleaving the sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\nThis is an 8-point sequence. We can define it as:\n*   `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n*   `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n\nWe are asked to find the 4-point DFT of this 8-point sequence `y(n)`. Let's call the result `Y_4(k)`.\n\n### Step 2: Write the DFT Formula\nThe definition of the N-point DFT of a sequence is `S(k) = sum_{n} s(n) * e^(-j*2*pi*nk/N)`.\nIn this problem, we are calculating a 4-point DFT (`N=4`) of an 8-point sequence (`n` goes from 0 to 7). Let `W_4 = e^(-j*2*pi/4) = -j`.\nThe formula for `Y_4(k)` is:\n`Y_4(k) = sum_{n=0}^{7} y(n) * W_4^(nk)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n### Step 3: Decompose the Summation\nWe can split the summation over `n` into even and odd indices to utilize the interleaved structure of `y(n)`.\nLet `n = 2m` for even indices and `n = 2m+1` for odd indices, where `m` ranges from 0 to 3.\n\n`Y_4(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} y(2m) * W_4^((2m)k) + sum_{m=0}^{3} y(2m+1) * W_4^((2m+1)k)`\n\n### Step 4: Substitute `x(m)` and `h(m)` and Simplify\nSubstitute `y(2m) = x(m)` and `y(2m+1) = h(m)` into the equation:\n\n`Y_4(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_4^(2mk) + sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_4^((2m+1)k)`\n\nWe can simplify the exponential terms: `W_4^((2m+1)k) = W_4^(2mk) * W_4^k`.\n\n`Y_4(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * (W_4^2)^(mk) + W_4^k * sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * (W_4^2)^(mk)`\n\n### Step 5: Relate to the Given DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`\nThe problem provides the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`. The definition of the 4-point DFT of `x(m)` is `X(p) = sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_4^(mp)`.\n\nLet's evaluate the term `W_4^2`:\n`W_4^2 = (e^(-j*2*pi/4))^2 = e^(-j*pi) = -1`\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for `Y_4(k)`:\n`Y_4(k) = [sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * (-1)^(mk)] + W_4^k * [sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * (-1)^(mk)]`\n\nNow, let's analyze the sum `sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * (-1)^(mk)`. This can be rewritten as `sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * (W_4^2)^(mk) = sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_4^(m*(2k))`.\nThis is exactly the 4-point DFT of `x(m)` evaluated at the frequency index `p = 2k`. Therefore, this sum is equal to `X(2k mod 4)`.\nSimilarly, the sum involving `h(m)` is equal to `H(2k mod 4)`.\n\nThis gives us the final formula to calculate `Y_4(k)`:\n`Y_4(k) = X(2k mod 4) + W_4^k * H(2k mod 4)`\n\n### Step 6: Calculate `Y_4(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n\nWe are given:\n*   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n*   The twiddle factors are `W_4^0 = 1`, `W_4^1 = -j`, `W_4^2 = -1`, `W_4^3 = j`.\n\n**For k = 0:**\n`Y_4(0) = X(2*0 mod 4) + W_4^0 * H(2*0 mod 4)`\n`Y_4(0) = X(0) + 1 * H(0) = 1 + 0 = 1`\n\n**For k = 1:**\n`Y_4(1) = X(2*1 mod 4) + W_4^1 * H(2*1 mod 4)`\n`Y_4(1) = X(2) + (-j) * H(2) = -1 - j * 1 = -1 - j`\n\n**For k = 2:**\n`Y_4(2) = X(2*2 mod 4) + W_4^2 * H(2*2 mod 4)`\n`Y_4(2) = X(0) + (-1) * H(0) = 1 - 1 * 0 = 1`\n\n**For k = 3:**\n`Y_4(3) = X(2*3 mod 4) + W_4^3 * H(2*3 mod 4)`\n`Y_4(3) = X(6 mod 4) + (j) * H(6 mod 4) = X(2) + j * H(2) = -1 + j * 1 = -1 + j`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining the results, the 4-point DFT is:\n`Y_4(k) = [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
