    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Question\nThe user wants to know whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his specific 1905 paper on Brownian motion. The key elements are \"Albert Einstein,\" \"1905 paper on Brownian motion,\" \"cited,\" and \"lectures.\"\n\n### Step 2: Locate the Specific Paper and its Content\nThe paper in question is one of Einstein's four *Annus Mirabilis* (miracle year) papers. Its title in German is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"). This paper aimed to provide theoretical and observable evidence for the existence of atoms by explaining the random motion of particles in a fluid.\n\n### Step 3: Examine the Citation Practices of the Era and the Paper Itself\nIn the early 20th century, scientific papers did not always have a formal bibliography or reference list like modern papers. Citations were often made directly in the text, crediting an idea to a person without listing a specific publication. Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion has no formal reference list at the end. The only formal citation in a footnote is to his own PhD dissertation, which he had recently submitted.\n\n### Step 4: Search for Direct Mentions of other Scientists in the Paper\nTo find who Einstein cited, we must look at the text of the paper. In the second paragraph, while setting up the theoretical background, Einstein writes about the kinetic theory of heat and its application to solutions. He credits two individuals for pioneering the application of these ideas to dissolved molecules. The text states (translation): \"...a state of affairs to which **Boltzmann and Nernst**, in particular, have drawn attention.\"\n\n### Step 5: Connect the Mentioned Scientist to the Term \"Lectures\"\nNow we must connect this finding to the specific word \"lectures\" in the user's question.\n\n*   **Ludwig Boltzmann:** He was a foundational figure in statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of gases. His most important and comprehensive work on this subject was a two-volume book published in 1896 and 1898. The title of this book is ***Vorlesungen über Gastheorie***, which translates directly to ***Lectures on Gas Theory***. This book was the primary source for Boltzmann's ideas on the subject.\n*   **Walther Nernst:** He was a physical chemist who also contributed to this field. However, his main work was a textbook titled *Theoretical Chemistry*, not a volume of \"lectures.\"\n\nGiven that Boltzmann's definitive work was titled *Lectures on Gas Theory*, it is widely understood that when Einstein cited Boltzmann's ideas on kinetic theory, he was referring to the work contained within these famous published lectures.\n\n### Step 6: Conclude the Analysis\nAlbert Einstein did not provide a formal bibliographic citation with a page number in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion. However, he did explicitly credit **Ludwig Boltzmann** in the text for the foundational ideas he was building upon. Boltzmann's seminal work was published under the title *Lectures on Gas Theory*. Therefore, Einstein cited the work from Ludwig Boltzmann's lectures.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
