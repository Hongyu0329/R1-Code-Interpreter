    "This problem requires finding the equilibrium expressions for mean energy and entropy for a gas of photons (light quanta), which obey Bose-Einstein statistics. The prompt asks to frame the solution using the language and principles of large deviation theory (LDT), specifically the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### **Step 1: Interpreting the Large Deviation Framework**\n\nThe foundation of statistical mechanics, the principle of maximum entropy, can be understood through the lens of large deviation theory.\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Principle:** Sanov's theorem deals with the probability of an empirical distribution deviating from a true underlying distribution. The \"Boltzmann-Sanov\" connection implies that the thermodynamic entropy `S` is the statistical mechanics counterpart to the entropy-like rate function in LDT. The equilibrium state of a system corresponds to the most probable macroscopic configuration, which is found by maximizing the entropy functional `S[{n_j}]` that describes the system. For a quantum gas, this functional is derived from the quantum statistical counting of microstates (`S = k_B log W`).\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Principle:** Cramer's theorem deals with large deviations of a sample mean. The thermodynamic procedure of fixing the average energy `<E>` of a system corresponds to conditioning the system on a specific value of an observable (the mean energy). The equilibrium distribution is thus the one that maximizes the entropy `S` subject to the constraint that the mean energy is fixed, `E = Σ n_j ε_j`.\n\nIn essence, the problem is to apply the standard principle of maximum entropy to a Bose gas with a non-conserved number of particles.\n\n### **Step 2: Defining the Entropy for a Bose Gas**\n\nFor a system of bosons, particles are indistinguishable, and multiple particles can occupy the same quantum state.\nLet `{ε_j}` be the set of discrete energy levels.\nLet `{n_j}` be the number of bosons (photons) occupying the energy level `ε_j`.\n\nThe number of microstates `W` corresponding to a specific distribution `{n_j}` of particles among the energy levels (assuming for now each level `ε_j` is non-degenerate, i.e., `g_j=1`) is `W=1` for a specific set of `{n_j}` since they are indistinguishable. However, the correct entropy is found by considering the grand canonical ensemble or by using the proper combinatorial factor for distributing `n_j` particles among `g_j` degenerate states. The resulting entropy functional for a Bose gas is:\n\n`S[{n_j}] = k_B * Σ_j [ (n_j + g_j)log(n_j + g_j) - n_jlog(n_j) - g_jlog(g_j) ]`\n\nAssuming non-degenerate levels (`g_j = 1` for all `j`) for simplicity in the derivation, this becomes:\n\n`S[{n_j}] = k_B * Σ_j [ (1 + n_j)log(1 + n_j) - n_jlog(n_j) ]`\n\nThis is the entropy functional to be maximized (the **Boltzmann-Sanov** part).\n\n### **Step 3: Imposing the Constraints**\n\nFor a gas of light quanta (photons) in thermal equilibrium:\n\n1.  **Mean Energy Constraint:** The system has a well-defined average total energy `E`, determined by the temperature of its surroundings. We impose this via a Lagrange multiplier:\n    `Σ_j n_j ε_j = E`\n    This corresponds to the **Cramer-Chernoff** part of the framework.\n\n2.  **Particle Number:** The total number of photons is not conserved (they can be created or annihilated). This means there is no constraint on `Σ_j n_j`, which is equivalent to setting the chemical potential `μ` to zero.\n\n### **Step 4: Maximizing Entropy via Lagrange Multipliers**\n\nWe find the equilibrium distribution `{n_j^{eq}}` by maximizing `S` subject to the energy constraint. We define the Lagrangian `L`:\n\n`L = S/k_B - β(Σ_j n_j ε_j - E)`\n\nWhere `β` is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the energy constraint. The equilibrium condition is `∂L/∂n_k = 0` for all `k`.\n\n`∂/∂n_k (S/k_B) = ∂/∂n_k [ (1+n_k)log(1+n_k) - n_klog(n_k) ] = log(1+n_k) - log(n_k) = log((1+n_k)/n_k)`\n\n`∂/∂n_k [-β(Σ_j n_j ε_j)] = -β ε_k`\n\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n`log((1+n_k)/n_k) - β ε_k = 0`\n`log(1 + 1/n_k) = β ε_k`\n`1 + 1/n_k = exp(β ε_k)`\n`n_k^{eq} = 1 / (exp(β ε_k) - 1)`\n\nThis is the celebrated Bose-Einstein distribution for particles with zero chemical potential, where `n_k^{eq}` is the average occupation number of the energy level `ε_k`. The Lagrange multiplier is identified with the inverse temperature: `β = 1/(k_B T)`.\n\n### **Step 5: Finding the Equilibrium Mean Energy**\n\nThe equilibrium mean energy is the value of the energy function evaluated at the equilibrium distribution `{n_j^{eq}}`.\n\n`E_{eq} = Σ_j n_j^{eq} ε_j`\n\nSubstituting the expression for `n_j^{eq}`:\n\n**`E_{eq} = Σ_j [ ε_j / (exp(β ε_j) - 1) ]`**\n\nThis is the formal expression for the equilibrium mean energy of a photon gas.\n\n### **Step 6: Finding the Equilibrium Entropy**\n\nThe equilibrium entropy is the value of the entropy functional evaluated at the equilibrium distribution `{n_j^{eq}}`.\n\n`S_{eq} = k_B * Σ_j [ (1 + n_j^{eq})log(1 + n_j^{eq}) - n_j^{eq} log(n_j^{eq}) ]`\n\nThis expression can be rewritten in terms of `β` and `{ε_j}` by substituting the relations derived in Step 4. A more direct form is obtained from the grand canonical potential (`Ω = -k_B T log Z`), where `S = (E - Ω)/T`. For photons `(μ=0)`, this gives:\n`S_{eq} = k_B [ β E_{eq} + log(Z) ]`\nWhere `Z` is the grand partition function, `log(Z) = - Σ_j log(1 - exp(-β ε_j))`.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `E_{eq}` and `log(Z)`:\n\n**`S_{eq} = k_B * Σ_j [ (β ε_j / (exp(β ε_j) - 1)) - log(1 - exp(-β ε_j)) ]`**\n\nThis is the formal expression for the equilibrium entropy of a photon gas.\n\n---\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe equilibrium values are expressed as functions of the system's energy levels `{ε_j}` and the inverse temperature `β = 1/(k_B T)`.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy (E):**\n    `E = Σ_j [ ε_j / (exp(β ε_j) - 1) ]`\n\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\n    `S = k_B * Σ_j [ (β ε_j / (exp(β ε_j) - 1)) - log(1 - exp(-β ε_j)) ]`\n\n<<<**Equilibrium Mean Energy**: `E = Σ_j [ ε_j / (exp(β ε_j) - 1) ]`\n**Equilibrium Entropy**: `S = k_B * Σ_j [ (β ε_j / (exp(β ε_j) - 1)) - log(1 - exp(-β ε_j)) ]`\nwhere `β=1/(k_B T)`, `{ε_j}` are the energy levels, and `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.>>>"
