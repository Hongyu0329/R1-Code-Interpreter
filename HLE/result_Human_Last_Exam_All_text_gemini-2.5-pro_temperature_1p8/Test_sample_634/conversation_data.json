    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nFind the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the matrices:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2]\nP2 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1]\n\n**Step 1: Understand the concept of GCRD**\nA polynomial matrix G(s) is the GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s) if:\n1.  G(s) is a common right divisor of both P1(s) and P2(s). This means there exist polynomial matrices Q1(s) and Q2(s) such that P1(s) = Q1(s)G(s) and P2(s) = Q2(s)G(s).\n2.  Any other common right divisor D(s) is a right divisor of G(s). This means there exists a polynomial matrix H(s) such that G(s) = H(s)D(s).\nThe GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant non-zero determinant). We will find a GCRD in a simplified (row-echelon) form.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Euclidean Algorithm for polynomial matrices**\nThe standard method to find the GCRD is to use elementary row operations to reduce the stacked matrix M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)]. The non-zero rows of the resulting matrix in row-echelon form constitute a GCRD.\n\n**Step 3: Form the stacked matrix M(s)**\nM(s) =\n[ s^2 + s   -s      ]  (Row 1)\n[ -s^2 - 1  s^2     ]  (Row 2)\n[ s         0       ]  (Row 3)\n[ -s - 1    1       ]  (Row 4)\n\n**Step 4: Perform elementary row operations to simplify M(s)**\nThe goal is to transform the matrix into a row-echelon form. It's generally easier to work with rows that have lower-degree polynomials.\n\n1.  **Reorder the rows:** Swap Row 1 with Row 3, and Row 2 with Row 4 to bring the lower-degree rows to the top.\n    [ s         0       ]\n    [ -s - 1    1       ]\n    [ s^2 + s   -s      ]\n    [ -s^2 - 1  s^2     ]\n\n2.  **Eliminate higher-order terms in the first column:**\n    *   Perform `R3 -> R3 - (s+1) * R1`:\n        `[s^2 + s, -s] - (s+1)[s, 0] = [s^2 + s - (s^2+s), -s - 0] = [0, -s]`\n    *   Perform `R4 -> R4 + s * R1`:\n        `[-s^2 - 1, s^2] + s[s, 0] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^2, s^2 + 0] = [-1, s^2]`\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [ s         0       ]\n    [ -s - 1    1       ]\n    [ 0         -s      ]\n    [ -1        s^2     ]\n\n3.  **Create a leading '1'**: A constant '1' or '-1' in the first column is very useful for elimination. We have a '-1' in Row 4. Swap Row 1 and Row 4.\n    [ -1        s^2     ]\n    [ -s - 1    1       ]\n    [ 0         -s      ]\n    [ s         0       ]\n    Now, multiply the first row by -1 (`R1 -> -1 * R1`) to make the leading element '1'.\n    [ 1         -s^2    ]\n    [ -s - 1    1       ]\n    [ 0         -s      ]\n    [ s         0       ]\n\n4.  **Clear the first column**: Use the new Row 1 to make other elements in the first column zero.\n    *   Perform `R2 -> R2 + (s+1) * R1`:\n        `[-s - 1, 1] + (s+1)[1, -s^2] = [-s-1+s+1, 1 + (s+1)(-s^2)] = [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]`\n    *   Perform `R4 -> R4 - s * R1`:\n        `[s, 0] - s[1, -s^2] = [s-s, 0 - (-s^3)] = [0, s^3]`\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [ 1         -s^2            ]\n    [ 0         1 - s^2 - s^3   ]\n    [ 0         -s              ]\n    [ 0         s^3             ]\n\n5.  **Reduce the second column**: Now we focus on the submatrix formed by rows 2, 3, and 4. We can use the polynomial Euclidean algorithm on the elements of the second column.\n    *   Use Row 3 `[0, -s]` to simplify Row 4 `[0, s^3]`. Perform `R4 -> R4 + s^2 * R3`:\n        `[0, s^3] + s^2[0, -s] = [0, s^3 - s^3] = [0, 0]`\n    *   Now use Row 3 `[0, -s]` to simplify Row 2 `[0, 1 - s^2 - s^3]`. We divide `(1 - s^2 - s^3)` by `(-s)`.\n        The quotient is `(s^2+s)` and the remainder is `1`.\n        `(1 - s^2 - s^3) = (s^2+s)(-s) + 1`\n        So, `1 = (1 - s^2 - s^3) - (s^2+s)(-s)`.\n        The corresponding row operation is `R2 -> R2 - (s^2+s) * R3`:\n        `[0, 1 - s^2 - s^3] - (s^2+s)[0, -s] = [0, (1 - s^2 - s^3) - (-s^3 - s^2)] = [0, 1]`\n    The matrix now is:\n    [ 1         -s^2    ]\n    [ 0         1       ]\n    [ 0         -s      ]\n    [ 0         0       ]\n\n6.  **Final reduction (back-substitution)**: Use the `[0, 1]` in Row 2 to clear the second column.\n    *   Perform `R1 -> R1 + s^2 * R2`:\n        `[1, -s^2] + s^2[0, 1] = [1, -s^2 + s^2] = [1, 0]`\n    *   Perform `R3 -> R3 + s * R2`:\n        `[0, -s] + s[0, 1] = [0, -s + s] = [0, 0]`\n    The final matrix in row-echelon form is:\n    [ 1    0 ]\n    [ 0    1 ]\n    [ 0    0 ]\n    [ 0    0 ]\n\n**Step 5: Extract the GCRD**\nThe non-zero rows of the reduced matrix form the GCRD.\nG(s) = [ 1  0 ]\n       [ 0  1 ]\n\nThis is the 2x2 identity matrix, which we denote as I. When the GCRD is the identity matrix, the matrices P1 and P2 are called **right coprime**."
