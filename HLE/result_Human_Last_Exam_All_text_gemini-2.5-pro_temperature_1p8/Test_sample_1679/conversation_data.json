    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Components of the Question**\n\n*   **\"Academy Award for Best Picture winner\":** This requires a specific, chronological list of winning films.\n*   **\"Luxor Obelisk\":** This is the key object that must appear on-screen. It's crucial to know where these obelisks are located.\n*   **\"First\":** The answer must be the earliest film on the chronological list that meets the criteria.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Locations of the Luxor Obelisks**\n\nA search reveals there are two obelisks originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n1.  One remains at the entrance to the **Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt**.\n2.  The other was transported to France in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the **Place de la Concorde in Paris, France**.\n\nTherefore, the film in question must feature scenes set in either Luxor or Paris that show one of these specific landmarks.\n\n**Step 3: Chronological Review of Best Picture Winners**\n\nWe will now go through the list of Best Picture winners in order, looking for films set in Paris or Luxor.\n\n*   **1927/28 - 1936:** Winners like *Wings*, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, *Grand Hotel*, and *Mutiny on the Bounty* are set in various locations (WWI battlefields, Berlin, the high seas) but not Paris or Luxor in a way that would feature the obelisk.\n\n*   **1937: *The Life of Emile Zola***\n    *   **Analysis:** This film is set in Paris. It is the first Best Picture winner set in a city containing a Luxor Obelisk, making it a strong potential candidate. However, the film's key scenes, like the military degradation of Alfred Dreyfus, historically took place in the courtyard of the Ã‰cole Militaire, not the Place de la Concorde. While there might be establishing shots of Paris, a clear on-screen depiction of the obelisk is not a noted or prominent feature of the film.\n\n*   **1938 - 1950:** This period includes winners like *Gone with the Wind*, *Rebecca*, *Casablanca*, and *All About Eve*. None of these films are set in locations that would depict either obelisk.\n\n*   **1951: *An American in Paris***\n    *   **Analysis:** This film is famously set in Paris and celebrates the city's beauty. Its climactic 17-minute ballet sequence features elaborate, stylized sets representing various Parisian landmarks. One of these prominent sets is a recreation of the Place de la Concorde, which explicitly features the Luxor Obelisk. This is a definite and confirmed on-screen depiction.\n\n*   **1952 - onward:**\n    *   **_Around the World in 80 Days_ (1956):** Features Paris and would show the obelisk. However, it comes after *An American in Paris*.\n    *   **_Gigi_ (1958):** Is also set in Paris and shows landmarks, but it too is later.\n    *   **_Lawrence of Arabia_ (1962):** Has scenes in Egypt, but they are primarily in Cairo and the desert, not at the Luxor Temple.\n    *   **_Cleopatra_ (1963):** A Best Picture nominee but not a winner.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nWhile *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) is the first winner set in Paris, a verifiable depiction of the obelisk is not confirmed. The first Best Picture winner with a clear, definite, and well-documented on-screen depiction of a Luxor Obelisk (the one in Paris) is **_An American in Paris_**. The film's famous final ballet makes a point of showcasing Parisian landmarks, including the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
