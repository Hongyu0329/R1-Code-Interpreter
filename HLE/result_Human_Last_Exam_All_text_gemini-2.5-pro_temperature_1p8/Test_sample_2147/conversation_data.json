    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key figure and context.**\nThe question centers on Pavel Milyukov, a significant Russian politician, historian, and leader of the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party (the Kadets) in the early 20th century. The context is his critique of \"Western culture of his time\". This places his comments roughly between the 1890s and the Russian Revolution of 1917, a period often referred to as Russia's \"Silver Age.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the specific quote.**\nMilyukov is said to have denounced \"X-Ys as a 'stagnant swamp'\". This is a very harsh criticism. The metaphor 'stagnant swamp' suggests something decadent, morbid, lifeless, unproductive, and cut off from the main currents of healthy national life. It implies a sense of decay and uselessness.\n\n**Step 3: Consider Milyukov's own intellectual and cultural position.**\nMilyukov was a positivist and a rationalist. He believed in progress, science, and reason. In terms of art and culture, he championed realism and the 19th-century tradition of art serving a social purpose. He believed culture should enlighten and contribute to the betterment of society. This makes him a natural opponent of artistic movements that prioritize aestheticism (\"art for art's sake\"), mysticism, individualism, and subjective experience over social realism.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the dominant \"Western\" influenced cultural movement of that era in Russia.**\nDuring Russia's Silver Age, the most prominent and controversial artistic and literary movement was Symbolism. Russian Symbolism was heavily influenced by its French and Belgian predecessors but developed its own unique characteristics. It focused on spirituality, mysticism, metaphysics, and the artist's inner world, often using complex, allusive imagery. Leading Russian Symbolists included figures like Andrei Bely, Alexander Blok, and Dmitry Merezhkovsky.\n\n**Step 5: Connect Milyukov's critique to the Symbolist movement.**\nGiven Milyukov's rationalist and civic-minded worldview, he was a vehement public critic of Symbolism. He saw it as a retreat from reality, a decadent and morbid fascination with the esoteric, and a complete betrayal of the socially-engaged tradition of Russian literature. The term 'stagnant swamp' perfectly encapsulates his view of Symbolism as something unhealthy, self-absorbed, and disconnected from the real needs of the Russian people.\n\n**Step 6: Deduce the term \"X-Ys\".**\nThe question uses the placeholder \"X-Ys\" to refer to the adherents of the movement Milyukov was denouncing. The practitioners of Symbolism are called **Symbolists**. This term fits the structure \"X-Ys\" (Symbol-ists). Historical accounts of the cultural debates of the era confirm that Milyukov's attacks were directed squarely at the Symbolists and their work.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nPavel Milyukov, a champion of rationalism and realism, saw the contemporary modernist movement of Symbolism as a decadent and socially useless import from the West. He denounced its practitioners, the **Symbolists**, as inhabitants of a 'stagnant swamp'.\n\n<<<Symbolists>>>"
