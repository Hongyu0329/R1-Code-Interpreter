    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Components:**\n    *   **Chern Insulator:** A two-dimensional material that is an insulator in the bulk (has an energy gap) but conducts electricity along its edges. This edge conduction is carried by special states called \"chiral edge states\".\n    *   **Chern Number (C):** A topological integer that characterizes a Chern insulator. Its absolute value, |C|, tells you the number of chiral edge states at the boundary of the material. A material with C=1 has one such edge state. The sign of C determines the direction of propagation (chirality) of these states.\n    *   **The System:** We have two distinct Chern insulators. Let's call them CI1 and CI2.\n    *   **Given Information:**\n        *   Chern number of CI1 is C₁ = 1.\n        *   Chern number of CI2 is C₂ = 1.\n        *   They are connected \"laterally\" (side-by-side).\n        *   The \"tunneling barrier is negligible,\" which means the edge states from each insulator can interact freely at the interface where they meet.\n\n2.  **Analyze the \"Junction\":**\n    The question asks for the \"Chern number of this junction.\" This phrase refers to the Chern number of the new, larger system formed by combining CI1 and CI2. The Chern number is a property of the bulk of a material, not just the interface.\n\n3.  **Principle of Additivity of Chern Numbers:**\n    The Chern number is a topological invariant that is additive. When two systems are brought together to form a larger system, the Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers, assuming the interaction at the junction doesn't fundamentally change the bulk properties of the original systems.\n\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   We are combining a system with C₁ = 1 and another system with C₂ = 1.\n    *   The Chern number of the combined system (C_total) is the sum:\n        C_total = C₁ + C₂ = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Bulk vs. Boundary:** The Chern number (C=2) is a property of the bulk of the combined system. This bulk property dictates what happens at the boundaries.\n2.  **The Internal Interface:** What happens at the interface between CI1 and CI2? The number of net chiral edge states at an interface between two materials (A and B) is given by the difference in their Chern numbers: N_edge = C_A - C_B.\n    *   In our case, at the internal junction, N_edge = C₁ - C₂ = 1 - 1 = 0.\n    *   **Physical Interpretation:** CI1 wants to create one edge state moving in a certain direction along this boundary. CI2 also wants to create one edge state, but its chirality means it will move in the *opposite* direction. Since the tunneling barrier is negligible, these two counter-propagating states hybridize and cancel each other out, creating a \"gapped\" interface with no conducting states.\n3.  **The External Boundary:** What happens at the outer boundary of the combined system (the boundary with the vacuum, which has C=0)?\n    *   The number of edge states is determined by the total Chern number of the system: N_edge = C_total - C_vacuum = 2 - 0 = 2.\n    *   **Physical Interpretation:** The new, larger system acts as a single Chern insulator with a Chern number of 2. It will therefore host two co-propagating (moving in the same direction) chiral edge states on its outer perimeter.\n\nThe two pictures are perfectly consistent. The internal edge states have been eliminated, and the entire system now behaves as a single entity with C=2.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe question asks for the Chern number of the combined system. Based on the principle of additivity for topological invariants like the Chern number, we simply sum the Chern numbers of the individual components.\n\n*   Chern Number of System 1: C₁ = 1\n*   Chern Number of System 2: C₂ = 1\n*   Total Chern Number: C_total = C₁ + C₂ = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n<<<2>>>"
