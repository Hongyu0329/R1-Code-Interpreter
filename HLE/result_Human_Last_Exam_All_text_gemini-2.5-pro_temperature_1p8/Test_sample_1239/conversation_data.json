    "This problem asks for the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the equations**\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for a fluid with velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ are:\n1.  Momentum equation: $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  Incompressibility condition: $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$, $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity, $\\nabla$ is the gradient operator, and $\\Delta$ is the Laplacian operator. We treat $(t, \\mathbf{x})$ as independent variables and $(\\mathbf{u}, p)$ as dependent variables.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Lie Group Symmetries**\n\nA Lie group of symmetries is a group of continuous transformations of the independent and dependent variables that maps any solution of the equations to another solution. The dimension of the Lie group is the dimension of its associated Lie algebra, which is the vector space of the infinitesimal generators of these transformations. We are looking for the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional Lie algebra of point symmetries.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Symmetry Generators**\n\nWe list the infinitesimal generators corresponding to known physical invariances and mathematical properties of the equations.\n\n1.  **Time Translation:** The equations are autonomous (no explicit dependence on $t$), so they are invariant under time shifts $t \\rightarrow t + c$. This gives one generator:\n    *   $T = \\partial_t$ (1 generator)\n\n2.  **Space Translation:** The equations have constant coefficients and are defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}^3$, so they are invariant under spatial shifts $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{c}$. This gives three generators:\n    *   $P_i = \\partial_{x_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$ (3 generators)\n\n3.  **Spatial Rotation:** The equations are covariant under rotations of the coordinate system $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow R\\mathbf{x}$, where $R$ is a rotation matrix. The velocity vector $\\mathbf{u}$ also rotates, while the scalar pressure $p$ remains unchanged. This corresponds to the Lie algebra of the rotation group SO(3).\n    *   $J_k = \\sum_{i,j} \\epsilon_{ijk} (x_i \\partial_{x_j} + u_i \\partial_{u_j})$ for $k=1, 2, 3$ (3 generators)\n\n4.  **Galilean Boosts:** The equations are invariant under a transformation to a frame of reference moving at a constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}$. The transformation is:\n    $t' = t$\n    $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{v}t$\n    $\\mathbf{u}'(t', \\mathbf{x}') = \\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}) - \\mathbf{v}$\n    $p'(t', \\mathbf{x}') = p(t, \\mathbf{x})$\n    This can be verified by substituting into the equations. This gives three generators, one for each component of $\\mathbf{v}$.\n    *   $G_i = -t \\partial_{x_i} - \\partial_{u_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$ (3 generators)\n\n5.  **Scaling (Dilation):** The equations possess a scaling symmetry. If $(\\mathbf{u}(t,\\mathbf{x}), p(t,\\mathbf{x}))$ is a solution, then so is $(\\mathbf{u}'(t',\\mathbf{x}'), p'(t',\\mathbf{x}'))$ for the transformation:\n    $t' = \\lambda^2 t$\n    $\\mathbf{x}' = \\lambda \\mathbf{x}$\n    $\\mathbf{u}' = \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}$\n    $p' = \\lambda^{-2} p$\n    This gives a one-parameter group, corresponding to one generator.\n    *   $D = 2t\\partial_t + \\sum_i x_i\\partial_{x_i} - \\sum_i u_i\\partial_{u_i} - 2p\\partial_p$ (1 generator)\n\n6.  **Pressure Shift:** The pressure $p$ appears in the momentum equation only through its gradient, $\\nabla p$. Therefore, if $(\\mathbf{u}, p)$ is a solution, then so is $(\\mathbf{u}, p+C)$ for any constant $C$. This corresponds to a symmetry transformation $p \\rightarrow p + C$. The generator for this is:\n    *   $\\Pi = \\partial_p$ (1 generator)\n\n**Step 4: Careful points and final dimension count**\n\n*   **Infinite-dimensional part:** The pressure shift symmetry is actually larger. Since $\\nabla(p+h(t)) = \\nabla p$ for any arbitrary function $h(t)$, the transformation $p \\rightarrow p+h(t)$ is a symmetry for any $h(t)$. This generates an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra. Typically, when asked for \"the dimension\", one refers to the dimension of the maximal *finite-dimensional* subalgebra, or the dimension of the \"non-trivial\" part of the symmetry group (i.e., the symmetry group modulo these pressure shifts).\n\n*   **Maximal Finite-Dimensional Subalgebra:** Let's count the generators from the finite-dimensional symmetries we've found. These are the symmetries that do not belong to the infinite-dimensional ideal generated by pressure shifts (except for the constant shift, which is the zeroth-order term).\n    *   Time translation: 1\n    *   Space translations: 3\n    *   Rotations: 3\n    *   Galilean boosts: 3\n    *   Scaling: 1\n    *   Constant pressure shift: 1\n*   These 12 generators form a closed Lie algebra, meaning the commutator of any two generators is a linear combination of these 12 generators. This is the maximal finite-dimensional point symmetry algebra of the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of generators for the maximal finite-dimensional Lie group of point symmetries is the sum of the dimensions from each type of symmetry:\nDimension = $1 (\\text{time}) + 3 (\\text{space}) + 3 (\\text{rotations}) + 3 (\\text{Galilean}) + 1 (\\text{scaling}) + 1 (\\text{pressure shift}) = 12$.\n\nThe full Lie group of symmetries is infinite-dimensional. However, the standard interpretation of the question asks for the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional subalgebra.\n\n<<<12>>>"
