    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb root *seh₂g-.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyzing the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form**\n\n*   **PIE Form:** *seh₂gieti '(s)he’s giving a sign'. The root is *seh₂g- meaning 'to track, perceive, seek out'. The cognates provided, Hittite *sākizzi* and Latin *sāgīre*, confirm this root.\n*   **Careful Point:** The Germanic languages typically derive their Class 1 weak verbs from the o-grade of the PIE root. The form *seh₂gieti* is an e-grade present tense. We need to look at the corresponding o-grade form.\n*   **Reconstruction:** The o-grade of *seh₂g-* is **\\*soh₂g-**. This is the form that serves as the basis for the Proto-Germanic verb.\n\n### **Step 2: Deriving the Proto-Germanic (PGmc) Form**\n\nWe will trace the sound changes from PIE *soh₂g- to Proto-Germanic.\n\n1.  **Vowel Change (Laryngeal Coloring and Lengthening):** The PIE laryngeal *h₂* following an *o* vowel lengthens and colors it to what becomes Proto-Germanic long *ā*.\n    *   PIE *soh₂g- → Pre-Germanic **\\*sāg-**\n2.  **Germanic Vowel Shift:** In all Germanic languages except Gothic, Pre-Germanic *ā* becomes *ō*.\n    *   Pre-Germanic *sāg- → PGmc **\\*sōg-**\n3.  **Grimm's Law (First Consonant Shift):** This law changes the stop consonants. The PIE voiced velar stop *g* becomes a voiceless velar stop *k*.\n    *   PGmc *sōg- → PGmc **\\*sōk-**\n4.  **Verb Formation:** The PIE present suffix *-ye-/*-yo-* becomes the infinitive suffix for Class 1 weak verbs in Proto-Germanic: **\\*-janą**.\n5.  **Putting It Together:** The root *sōk-* combines with the infinitive suffix *-janą*. The semantic development from 'to track/perceive' to 'to look for/seek' is very common.\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic Result:** **\\*sōkijaną** ('to seek')\n\n### **Step 3: Deriving the Old Norse (ON) Form**\n\nWe trace the sound changes from PGmc *sōkijaną* to Old Norse.\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut:** The *j* in the suffix *-janą* causes the preceding back vowel *ō* to front. In Old Norse, the i-umlaut of *ō* [oː] is **œ̄** [øː] (written as `œ`).\n    *   *sōk- → *sœk-\n2.  **Infinitive Ending:** The PGmc infinitive ending *-janą* becomes **-ja** in Old Norse. The *j* is retained.\n\n*   **Old Norse Result:** **sœkja**\n\n### **Step 4: Deriving the Old English (OE) Form**\n\nWe trace the sound changes from PGmc *sōkijaną* to Old English.\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut (i-mutation):** The *j* causes the back vowel *ō* to front. In Old English, the i-umlaut of *ō* [oː] is **ē** [eː].\n    *   *sōk- → *sēc-\n2.  **Loss of Medial *j*:** In Old English, the *j* is dropped after a heavy syllable (a syllable with a long vowel or a short vowel plus two consonants). The root *sēc-* is a heavy syllable.\n3.  **Palatalization:** The velar consonant *c* [k] is followed by the new front vowel *ē*. This environment causes the *c* to become a palatal affricate [tʃ], written as **ċ** or simply **c**.\n    *   *sēc- → *sēċ-\n4.  **Infinitive Ending:** The PGmc infinitive ending *-janą* becomes **-an** in Old English.\n\n*   **Old English Result:** **sēċan** (also written *sēċan*)\n\n### **Step 5: Deriving the Old High German (OHG) Form**\n\nWe trace the sound changes from PGmc *sōkijaną* to Old High German.\n\n1.  **High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift):** The PGmc voiceless stop *k* shifts to a voiceless fricative after a vowel. This fricative, [xx], was written as **hh** between vowels in early OHG.\n    *   *sōkijaną → *sōhhijan* (intermediate step)\n2.  **OHG Diphthongization:** The PGmc long vowel *ō* becomes the diphthong **uo** in Old High German.\n    *   *sōhhijan → *suohhijan*\n3.  **Infinitive Ending:** The PGmc suffix *-janą* reduces to **-en**.\n    *   *suohhijan → *suohhen*\n4.  **Careful Point (I-Umlaut):** The *j* (realized as *i* in the suffix *-ien*) would normally cause i-umlaut (*uo* → *üe*). However, in Old High German, i-umlaut is not consistently applied or recorded in infinitive forms of Class 1 weak verbs, especially in earlier texts. The non-umlauted form is the standard citation form.\n\n*   **Old High German Result:** **suohhen** (or *suochen*)\n\n---\nHere is the final answer, compiling the results from the analysis.\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: \\*sōkijaną; Old Norse: sœkja; Old English: sēċan (or sēcan); Old High German: suohhen (or suochen)>>>"
