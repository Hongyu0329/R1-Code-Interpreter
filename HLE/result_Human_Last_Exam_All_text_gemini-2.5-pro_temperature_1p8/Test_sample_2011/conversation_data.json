    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\n\nFirst, let's understand the key terms:\n*   **Graph on n = 128 vertices:** We are working with a graph `G` that has exactly 128 nodes.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices in a graph where every vertex in the subset is directly connected to every other vertex in the subset. A clique of size `k` is also known as a complete graph `K_k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** Given a graph `G=(V, E)` and a subset of vertices `S ⊆ V`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` is the graph whose vertex set is `S`, and its edge set consists of *all* edges from `E` that have both endpoints in `S`. This is a crucial detail; we're not just looking for subgraphs, but specifically *induced* subgraphs.\n*   **Different clique sizes:** We are interested in the number of distinct values of `k` for which `G` contains an induced `K_k`.\n*   **Maximum possible number:** We need to find the absolute maximum number of different clique sizes that any single graph on 128 vertices can have.\n\nSo, the problem asks: For any graph `G` with 128 vertices, let `C(G)` be the set of integers `k` such that `G` contains an induced subgraph isomorphic to `K_k`. We want to find the maximum possible value of `|C(G)|`.\n\n### Step 2: Establishing an Upper Bound\n\nLet `G` be a graph with `n=128` vertices.\nFor `G` to have an induced clique of size `k`, it must have a subset of `k` vertices that form that clique. This means that `k` cannot be larger than the total number of vertices in the graph.\nTherefore, any possible clique size `k` must satisfy `1 ≤ k ≤ 128`.\nThe set of all possible clique sizes that can appear in `G`, denoted `C(G)`, must be a subset of `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`.\nThe number of elements in `C(G)`, which is `|C(G)|`, can therefore be no larger than the number of elements in `{1, 2, ..., 128}`.\nThis establishes a theoretical upper bound: the maximum number of different clique sizes is at most 128.\n\n### Step 3: Proving the Upper Bound is Achievable (Constructive Proof)\n\nTo show that 128 is not just an upper bound but the *maximum possible number*, we must demonstrate the existence of at least one graph `G` on 128 vertices that actually contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n\nConsider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted `K_{128}`.\nA complete graph is a graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. `K_{128}` has 128 vertices and all possible edges between them.\n\nNow, let's see what sizes of induced cliques exist in `K_{128}`.\nLet `k` be any integer such that `1 ≤ k ≤ 128`.\nCan we find an induced subgraph of `K_{128}` that is a `K_k`?\n\n1.  **Select Vertices:** Choose any subset of `k` vertices from the 128 vertices of `K_{128}`. Let this subset be `S`.\n2.  **Form the Induced Subgraph:** Consider the induced subgraph `K_{128}[S]`. The vertices of this subgraph are the `k` vertices in `S`.\n3.  **Check Edges:** By the definition of an induced subgraph, the edges of `K_{128}[S]` are all edges from the original graph (`K_{128}`) that connect two vertices within `S`.\n4.  **Verify Clique Property:** Since the original graph is a complete graph (`K_{128}`), *every* pair of its vertices is connected. Therefore, for our subset `S`, every pair of vertices within `S` must also be connected in the original graph. These are precisely the edges that form the induced subgraph `K_{128}[S]`.\n5.  **Conclusion for `k`:** This means that the induced subgraph `K_{128}[S]` is a complete graph on `k` vertices, i.e., a `K_k`.\n\nSince we can perform this process for any integer `k` from 1 to 128, the graph `K_{128}` contains induced subgraphs of all sizes {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}.\nThe set of clique sizes for `G = K_{128}` is `C(K_{128}) = {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`.\nThe number of different clique sizes is `|C(K_{128})| = 128`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\n*   We established an upper bound of 128 for the number of different clique sizes.\n*   We constructed an example, the complete graph `K_{128}`, which achieves this upper bound.\n*   Therefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on 128 vertices is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
