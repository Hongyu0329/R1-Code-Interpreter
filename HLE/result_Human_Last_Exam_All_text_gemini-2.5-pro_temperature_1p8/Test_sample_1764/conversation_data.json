    "An analysis of the question follows.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The question asks for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space, $X$, into a Banach space, $B$, of cardinality $K$. Let's denote the number of such embeddings as $N(X, B)$. The question is asking for the value of $\\min_{X, B} N(X, B)$, where the minimum is taken over all possible choices for $X$ and $B$ that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Components:**\n    *   **Finite Ultrametric Space (X):** This is a finite set with a distance function $d(x,y)$ that satisfies the standard metric axioms plus the strong triangle inequality: $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$. A key property is that for any three points, the two largest distances between them must be equal. We are free to choose any such space $X$.\n    *   **Banach Space (B):** This is a complete normed vector space. The base field is typically $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$. The distance is given by $d_B(u, v) = \\|u - v\\|_B$. We are free to choose any such space $B$. The cardinality of $B$, denoted by $K$, is a given property of the space. For example, if $B=\\mathbb{R}^n$ ($n>0$), $K = |\\mathbb{R}| = \\mathfrak{c}$. If $B = \\{0\\}$, $K=1$.\n    *   **Isometric Embedding:** This is a function $f: X \\to B$ that preserves distances, i.e., for all $x, y \\in X$, $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\|_B = d(x, y)$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Nature of the Quantity to be Minimized:** The number of embeddings, $N(X, B)$, must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the smallest possible value it can take is 0.\n\n4.  **Check if Zero is an Achievable Value:** The crucial part of the analysis is to determine if it is possible to choose a valid finite ultrametric space $X$ and a valid Banach space $B$ such that the number of isometric embeddings is exactly zero. If we can find such a case, then 0 must be the minimum possible number.\n\n5.  **Construct an Example where the Number of Embeddings is Zero:**\n    *   Let's choose a simple Banach space. The simplest one is the zero-dimensional space $B = \\{0\\}$. This is a valid Banach space. Its norm is $\\|0\\|_B=0$. Its cardinality is $K=1$.\n    *   Now, let's choose a finite ultrametric space $X$. For an embedding to be non-trivial, $X$ should have at least two points. Let's take $X = \\{x_1, x_2\\}$, a space with two points.\n    *   We must define a metric on $X$. Let the distance be $d(x_1, x_2) = 1$. The other distances are $d(x_1, x_1) = 0$ and $d(x_2, x_2) = 0$. This is a valid ultrametric space.\n    *   Now, let's search for an isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$.\n        *   Since $B = \\{0\\}$, there is only one possible function from $X$ to $B$: the function that maps every point in $X$ to the zero vector in $B$. That is, $f(x_1) = 0$ and $f(x_2) = 0$.\n        *   We must check if this function $f$ preserves distances. An embedding requires $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|_B = d(x_1, x_2)$.\n        *   Let's compute the distance in $B$: $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|_B = \\|0 - 0\\|_B = 0$.\n        *   The distance in $X$ is $d(x_1, x_2) = 1$.\n        *   The condition for an isometric embedding is $0 = 1$, which is false.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible map from our chosen $X$ to our chosen $B$ is not an isometric embedding. There are no other maps. This means the number of isometric embeddings, $N(X, B)$, is 0 for this specific choice of $X$ and $B$.\n\n6.  **Consider Other Cardinalities K:** The same conclusion can be reached for other cardinalities $K$. For instance, let $K = \\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum). We can choose $B = \\mathbb{R}$, the real line with the standard absolute value norm. Consider the three-point ultrametric space $X=\\{a, b, c\\}$ with distances $d(a, b) = 1$, $d(b, c) = 2$, and $d(a, c) = 2$. If there were an isometric embedding $f:X \\to \\mathbb{R}$, the images $u=f(a)$, $v=f(b)$, $w=f(c)$ would need to satisfy $|u-v|=1$, $|v-w|=2$, and $|u-w|=2$. From $|u-w|=2$ and $|v-w|=2$, it follows that $w$ must be the midpoint of two points, one at distance 2 from $u$ and another at distance 2 from $v$. The only way for a point to be the midpoint of two others, say $u$ and $v$, is if $w = (u+v)/2$. But this would imply $|u-w| = |u-(u+v)/2| = |u-v|/2 = 1/2$. This contradicts the condition that $|u-w|=2$. Thus, no such embedding exists, and the number of embeddings for this pair $(X, B)$ is 0.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** We have demonstrated that it is possible to find a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is 0. Since the number of embeddings cannot be negative, 0 is the lowest possible value.\n\nThe analysis shows that the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 0. This arises because there is no general guarantee that an arbitrary finite ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded into an arbitrary Banach space.\n\n<<<0>>>"
