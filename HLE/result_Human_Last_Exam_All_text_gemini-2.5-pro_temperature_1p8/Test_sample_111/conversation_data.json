    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death.**\nBlanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt and the subject of Chaucer's poem *The Book of the Duchess*, died from the plague. Historical records confirm her death date as **12 September 1368**.\n\n**Step 2: Examine Geoffrey Chaucer's documented activities in 1368.**\nTo find out where Chaucer was on that specific date, we must look at the official records of his life, known as the *Life-Records*.\n*   On **17 July 1368**, Chaucer was granted letters of protection for travel abroad on King Edward III's service. This means he was preparing for, or had just begun, a diplomatic mission on the European continent.\n*   Records from **Christmas 1368** show Chaucer back in England, where he, along with other members of the royal household, received money for mourning clothes.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the timeline.**\nChaucer left for his diplomatic mission sometime after mid-July 1368 and was back in England by late December 1368. Blanche's death on September 12, 1368, falls squarely within this travel window. Therefore, it is almost certain that Chaucer was not in England when she died; he was abroad on the continent. This allows us to eliminate choice C (England) and choice E (Scotland).\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the potential locations abroad.**\nThe historical records authorizing Chaucer's travel do not specify his exact destination.\n*   **France (B):** It is highly likely that his mission involved travel to or through France, a common destination for English diplomats at the time. Some sources suggest a specific mission to Montreuil-sur-Mer.\n*   **Italy (A):** Some scholars have speculated that this trip in 1368 might have taken him to Milan to assist with marriage negotiations for Lionel, Duke of Clarence. However, the evidence for this is circumstantial and not universally accepted. His first *confirmed* trip to Italy was later, in 1372-73.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude based on the evidence.**\nWe know with high certainty that Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission on the European continent on September 12, 1368. However, the historical record is not precise enough to state with certainty whether he was in France, Italy, or perhaps travelling between locations on that specific day. Because his exact whereabouts cannot be definitively proven, the most accurate and intellectually honest answer is that his location is unknown.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  The key is the date: September 12, 1368.\n2.  The primary evidence is the *Life-Records* which confirm travel abroad but lack a specific itinerary or return date.\n3.  We can confidently rule out England and Scotland.\n4.  While France and Italy are possibilities debated by scholars, neither can be proven as his location *on that exact day*.\n5.  Therefore, acknowledging the limits of the historical evidence is crucial.\n\n<<<D>>>"
