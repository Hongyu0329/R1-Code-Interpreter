    "Answering the question \"How many subgroups of index 4 does the Grigorchuk group have?\" requires a step-by-step analysis of the group's structure and its possible quotients.\n\n### Step 1: Framework for Counting Subgroups\n\nThe number of subgroups of index `n` in a group `G` is equal to the number of distinct transitive group actions of `G` on a set of `n` elements. Each such action is defined by a homomorphism `φ: G -> S_n` where `S_n` is the symmetric group on `n` letters, and the image `Im(φ)` is a transitive subgroup of `S_n`. The subgroup corresponding to this action is the stabilizer of a point.\n\nFor our problem, `G` is the Grigorchuk group `Γ` and `n=4`. We need to count the number of subgroups of index 4, which is equivalent to counting transitive homomorphisms `φ: Γ -> S_4` up to a certain equivalence. A more direct approach is to classify subgroups `H` based on their core, `Core_Γ(H) = ∩_{g∈Γ} gHg⁻¹`, which is the kernel of the homomorphism `φ`.\n\n### Step 2: Properties of the Grigorchuk Group Γ\n\n*   **Finitely generated:** `Γ` is generated by four elements, typically denoted `a, b, c, d`.\n*   **Torsion group:** `Γ` is a 2-group, meaning every element has an order that is a power of 2.\n*   **Consequence:** Any finite quotient of `Γ` must be a finite 2-group. The possible transitive subgroups of `S_4` that `Γ` can have as a quotient are therefore limited to its Sylow 2-subgroups. The transitive subgroups of `S_4` are `C_4` (cyclic, order 4), `V` (Klein four-group, order 4), `D_8` (dihedral, order 8), `A_4` (order 12), and `S_4` (order 24). Since `A_4` and `S_4` have elements of order 3, they cannot be quotients of `Γ`. Thus, the image of any transitive homomorphism `φ: Γ -> S_4` can only be `C_4`, `V`, or `D_8`.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Possible Quotients\n\nWe categorize the subgroups of index 4 based on the structure of the quotient group `Γ/Core_Γ(H)`.\n\n**Case 1: The quotient is `C_4` (Cyclic group of order 4)**\nA homomorphism `φ: Γ -> C_4` must factor through the abelianization of `Γ`, which is `Γ_ab = Γ/[Γ, Γ]`. It is a known result that the abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is `Γ_ab ≅ (Z/2Z)³`.\nThis group has exponent 2 (every element `g` satisfies `g²=1`). `C_4`, however, has an element of order 4. No homomorphism from a group of exponent 2 to a group with an element of order 4 can be surjective. Therefore, `Γ` has no quotient isomorphic to `C_4`.\n*   **Number of subgroups of this type = 0.**\n\n**Case 2: The quotient is `V` (Klein four-group)**\nThis case corresponds to `H` being a **normal subgroup** of index 4, with `Γ/H ≅ V`. Since `V` is abelian, any such subgroup `H` must contain the commutator subgroup `Γ'`. These subgroups are therefore in one-to-one correspondence with the subgroups of `Γ/Γ'` that have index 4.\n`Γ/Γ' ≅ (Z/2Z)³`, which is a group of order 8. A subgroup of index 4 in `(Z/2Z)³` must have order `8/4 = 2`. The number of subgroups of order 2 in `(Z/2Z)³` is equal to the number of non-identity elements, which is `2³ - 1 = 7`.\nEach of these 7 subgroups corresponds to a unique normal subgroup of `Γ` of index 4.\n*   **Number of normal subgroups of index 4 = 7.**\n\n**Case 3: The quotient is `D_8` (Dihedral group of order 8)**\nThis case corresponds to **non-normal subgroups** of index 4. Let `H` be such a subgroup. Its core is `K = Core_Γ(H)`. The action on the cosets `Γ/H` induces an isomorphism `Γ/K ≅ D_8`.\nThe index is related by `[Γ:H] = [Γ:K] / [H:K]`. Since `[Γ:H]=4` and `[Γ:K]=8`, we must have `[H:K]=2`. This means `H/K` is a subgroup of order `8/2 = 4` in `Γ/K \\cong D_8`. Oh, careful with the formula. It's `[Γ : K] = [Γ : H] [H : K]` for `K ⊂ H`. Correct. Wait, `K` is the core. `K \\subset H`. So `[Γ:H] = 4`. `[Γ:K] = |D_8| = 8`. `[H:K] = [Γ:K]/[Γ:H]` is not a formula. Let's use the quotient correspondence: `H/K` is a subgroup of `Γ/K`, and `[Γ/K : H/K] = [Γ:H] = 4`. So `H/K` is a subgroup of `D_8` of index 4, meaning it has order `8/4 = 2`.\nSince `H` is not normal, `H/K` cannot be a normal subgroup of `D_8`.\n\nSo, the task is to count non-normal subgroups `H` of index 4. This can be rephrased as counting subgroups `H` that contain a normal subgroup `K` (where `Γ/K ≅ D_8`) such that `H/K` is a non-normal subgroup of order 2 in `D_8`.\n\nIt is a known (and non-trivial) result that the Grigorchuk group has a unique normal subgroup `K` such that `Γ/K ≅ D_8`. Let's denote this `K_{D_8}`. Therefore, all non-normal subgroups of index 4 must contain `K_{D_8}`.\n\nThe problem now reduces to counting the non-normal subgroups of order 2 within `D_8`.\nThe group `D_8` has 5 elements of order 2 (involutions), which generate 5 distinct subgroups of order 2.\n*   One involution forms the center of `D_8` (`Z(D_8)`). This subgroup is normal.\n*   The other four involutions (the reflections) form two conjugacy classes and their corresponding subgroups are not normal in `D_8`.\n\nThese 4 non-normal subgroups of order 2 in `D_8` correspond to 4 distinct non-normal subgroups of index 4 in `Γ`.\n*   **Number of non-normal subgroups of index 4 = 4.**\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nThe total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of the numbers from all possible cases.\n\n*   Number of normal subgroups (quotient type `V`): 7\n*   Number of non-normal subgroups (quotient type `D_8`): 4\n*   Number of subgroups of `C_4` type: 0\n\nTotal number = 7 + 4 + 0 = 11."
