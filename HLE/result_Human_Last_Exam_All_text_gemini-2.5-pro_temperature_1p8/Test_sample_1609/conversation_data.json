    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables, a(4).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Boolean Function:** A function with `n` binary inputs (`x1, x2, ..., xn`) and a single binary output. For `n=4`, there are `2^4 = 16` possible input combinations (minterms).\n*   **Implicant:** A product term (e.g., `x1*x2'`) is an implicant of a function `F` if, whenever the product term is true, the function `F` is also true.\n*   **Prime Implicant (PI):** A prime implicant is an implicant that cannot be simplified by removing any of its literals. For example, if `x1` is an implicant, then `x1*x2` cannot be a prime implicant because it is covered by the simpler term `x1`. The set of all prime implicants for a given function `F` represents all the largest possible groupings of '1's in the function's Karnaugh map.\n*   **a(n):** The variable `a(n)` represents the maximum number of prime implicants that *any* Boolean function of `n` variables can have. Our goal is to find this value for `n=4`.\n\n**2. The Key Theoretical Result**\n\nThe problem of finding the maximum number of prime implicants is a classic result in switching theory. The key points are:\n\n*   The set of all prime implicants for any single Boolean function must form an **antichain**. An antichain is a set of elements where no element covers or is covered by another. In this context, a product term `P1` covers `P2` if `P1` can be obtained by removing one or more literals from `P2` (e.g., `xy` covers `xyz`). Therefore, if `xy` and `xyz` were both prime implicants of the same function, this would be a contradiction, as `xyz` would be covered by the larger implicant `xy`.\n*   The maximum number of prime implicants `a(n)` is therefore the size of the largest possible antichain of product terms that can be formed using `n` variables.\n*   Such an antichain is formed by taking all product terms of a specific size (number of literals), `k`. We need to find the value of `k` that maximizes the number of these terms.\n\n**3. The Formula**\n\nThe number of distinct product terms of size `k` for a function of `n` variables is given by the formula:\n\n`Number of terms = C(n, k) * 2^k`\n\nWhere:\n*   `C(n, k)` is the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\", which counts the number of ways to select `k` variables out of `n`.\n*   `2^k` accounts for the fact that each of the `k` chosen variables can be in either its complemented (`x'`) or uncomplemented (`x`) form.\n\n**4. Calculation for n=4**\n\nTo find `a(4)`, we need to calculate the value of `C(4, k) * 2^k` for all possible values of `k` (from 0 to 4) and find the maximum.\n\n*   **For k = 0:**\n    *   Number of terms = `C(4, 0) * 2^0 = 1 * 1 = 1`\n    *   This corresponds to the term '1' (the function that is always true).\n\n*   **For k = 1:**\n    *   Number of terms = `C(4, 1) * 2^1 = 4 * 2 = 8`\n    *   These are terms like `x1`, `x1'`, `x2`, `x2'`, etc.\n\n*   **For k = 2:**\n    *   Number of terms = `C(4, 2) * 2^2 = 6 * 4 = 24`\n    *   These are terms like `x1*x2`, `x1'*x3`, etc. `C(4,2) = 4!/(2!2!) = 6`.\n\n*   **For k = 3:**\n    *   Number of terms = `C(4, 3) * 2^3 = 4 * 8 = 32`\n    *   These are terms like `x1*x2*x3'`, `x1'*x2*x4`, etc. `C(4,3) = 4!/(3!1!) = 4`.\n\n*   **For k = 4:**\n    *   Number of terms = `C(4, 4) * 2^4 = 1 * 16 = 16`\n    *   These are the 16 minterms (e.g., `x1*x2'*x3*x4'`).\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nComparing the calculated values: {1, 8, 24, 32, 16}.\nThe maximum value is 32, which occurs when the terms have `k=3` literals.\nTherefore, the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of 4 variables, a(4), is 32.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Distinction from other concepts:** `a(n)` is not the Dedekind number `M(n)` (the number of monotone Boolean functions) or the total number of Boolean functions (`2^(2^n)`). It is a specific property related to the complexity of the Sum-of-Products representation.\n2.  **Existence of the Function:** The analysis relies on a known theorem that a function actually exists whose set of prime implicants is precisely the set of all product terms of the optimal size `k`. Proving this existence is complex, but the result itself is standard. For this question, we only need to use the result to find the number.\n3.  **Optimal `k`:** The value of `k` that maximizes `C(n, k) * 2^k` is generally `k ≈ 2n/3`. For `n=4`, `k ≈ 8/3 ≈ 2.67`, so it makes sense that the maximum is at `k=3` rather than `k=2`. Our calculations confirmed this.\n\n<<<32>>>"
