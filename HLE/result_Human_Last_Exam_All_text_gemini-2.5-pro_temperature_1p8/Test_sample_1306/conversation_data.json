    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Object of Study\nThe question asks about the representations of the algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$. This is the quantum group associated with the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C}$. The parameter $q$ is a primitive third root of unity, meaning $q^3=1$ and $q \\neq 1$. We can take $q=e^{2\\pi i/3}$. The integer associated with this root of unity is $\\ell=3$.\n\nThe structure of the representation theory of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is drastically different depending on whether $q$ is a root of unity or not. The fact that $q$ is a root of unity is the most crucial part of this problem.\n\nThere are two common versions of the quantum group: the \"big\" one, often denoted $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, and the \"small\" one, $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. The small one is the finite-dimensional algebra obtained by adding the relations $E^\\ell=0$, $F^\\ell=0$, and $K^\\ell=1$. The problem mentions $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$, and standard literature conventions (as well as the well-posedness of the question) strongly suggest we should work with the small quantum group, since the representation theory of the big quantum group involves infinite families of irreducible representations, making the percentage ill-defined. We will proceed assuming we are working with the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ where $\\ell=3$.\n\n### Step 2: Classifying the Irreducible Representations\nThe irreducible (or simple) representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at an $\\ell$-th root of unity are well-known. They are highest weight representations, analogous to the classical case.\n\n*   They are indexed by their highest weight, or equivalently, their dimension. Let's denote the simple module of dimension $d$ by $L_d$.\n*   For $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ with $q$ a primitive $\\ell$-th root of unity, there are exactly $\\ell$ non-isomorphic simple modules. Their dimensions are $1, 2, \\dots, \\ell$.\n*   In our case, $\\ell=3$. So there are **three** simple (irreducible) modules:\n    1.  $L_1$: The trivial module of dimension 1.\n    2.  $L_2$: A 2-dimensional simple module.\n    3.  $L_3$: A 3-dimensional simple module (often called the Steinberg module in analogous theories).\n\nSo, the total number of non-isomorphic irreducible objects in the category is 3.\n\n### Step 3: Classifying the Indecomposable Representations\nThe question asks for a percentage, so we need to know the total number of indecomposable representations. An indecomposable representation is one that cannot be written as a direct sum of two non-trivial sub-representations. Every irreducible representation is indecomposable, but the converse is not true if the algebra is not semisimple (which is the case here).\n\nThe representation theory of an algebra is classified as being of finite, tame, or wild type.\n*   **Finite type:** Only a finite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations exist.\n*   **Tame type:** The indecomposable representations can be classified. For each dimension, they fall into a finite number of discrete modules and a finite number of one-parameter families. Crucially, this means there are infinitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable modules.\n*   **Wild type:** The classification problem is considered hopeless; it contains the representation theory of any finitely generated algebra.\n\nFor the algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{s l}_2)$ where $q$ is a primitive $\\ell$-th root of unity, the representation type is known to be:\n*   Finite for $\\ell < 3$.\n*   **Tame for $\\ell=3$.**\n*   Wild for $\\ell > 3$.\n\nSince our problem has $\\ell=3$, the algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is of **tame representation type**.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Objects and Calculating the Percentage\n*   **Number of irreducible objects:** As determined in Step 2, there are 3 isomorphism classes of irreducible representations.\n*   **Number of indecomposable objects:** Since the algebra is of tame representation type, there are infinite families of indecomposable representations. For example, for $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ with $\\ell=3$, there is a well-known 1-parameter family of indecomposable modules of dimension 6 (parametrized by $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^*$), in addition to other discrete indecomposable modules (like the projective covers of the simples). Therefore, the total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable objects is **infinite**.\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of indecomposable objects that are irreducible. This is the ratio:\n$$ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Irreducible Objects}}{\\text{Number of Indecomposable Objects}} \\times 100\\% $$\nSubstituting the counts we found:\n$$ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{3}{\\infty} \\times 100\\% $$\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe ratio of a finite number to an infinite number is zero. Therefore, the percentage of indecomposable representations that are irreducible is 0%. The core of the problem lies in recognizing that while there is a finite, small number of building blocks (the irreducibles), the number of ways to assemble them into larger, indivisible (indecomposable) structures is infinite.\n\nList of careful points:\n1.  Correctly identifying the parameter $\\ell=3$ from the fact that $q$ is a primitive third root of unity.\n2.  Interpreting $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ as the small quantum group, for which the number of irreducibles is finite. This is the only interpretation under which the question has a definitive, non-indeterminate answer.\n3.  Knowing the classification of the representation type of this algebra, specifically that it is of tame type for $\\ell=3$.\n4.  Understanding that \"tame type\" implies an infinite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations.\n5.  Calculating the percentage as the ratio of the number of irreducibles to the total number of indecomposables.\n\nThe final calculation is straightforward once these points are established."
