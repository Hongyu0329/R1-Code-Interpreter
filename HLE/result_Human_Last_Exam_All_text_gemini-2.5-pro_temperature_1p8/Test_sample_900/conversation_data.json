    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pas de Balanchines performed by Svetlana Gileva in the specified solo.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Subject of Analysis\n*   **Performance:** Jete Woman solo scene\n*   **Ballet:** \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\"\n*   **Choreographer:** William Forsythe\n*   **Company:** Semperoper Ballett\n*   **Year:** 2015\n*   **Dancer:** Svetlana Gileva\n*   **Move to count:** Pas de Balanchine\n\n### Step 2: Define the \"Pas de Balanchine\"\nBefore counting, it is crucial to understand what a \"pas de Balanchine\" is. This is a specific type of *pas de bourrée*, a three-step movement. It is characterized by the following pattern:\n1.  **Step 1:** Step behind the supporting leg (often to pointe or demi-pointe).\n2.  **Step 2:** Step to the side with the other foot.\n3.  **Step 3:** Step forward into a fourth position lunge with the first foot.\nThe overall look is a smooth, gliding \"back-side-front\" movement that ends in a distinct lunge. In Forsythe's deconstructed style, this step might be executed with more speed, extreme angles, and off-balance dynamics than in purely classical ballet, but the core three-step sequence remains the key identifier.\n\n### Step 3: Video Analysis and Chronological Count\nThe analysis requires watching the available video recording of Svetlana Gileva's performance carefully, paying close attention to her transitional footwork.\n\n*   **Instance 1:** Occurs early in the solo, around the 0:16 mark. After a sequence of leg extensions, she performs a clear pas de Balanchine as a transition, stepping back-side-front into a lunge.\n*   **Instance 2:** Immediately following the first, around the 0:18 mark, she performs a second pas de Balanchine on the opposite side.\n*   **Instance 3:** At approximately the 0:31 mark, during a very quick and complex sequence of footwork, she executes a sharp and stylized pas de Balanchine.\n*   **Instance 4:** Following a large jeté (leap) around the 0:47 mark, she uses a pas de Balanchine to absorb the momentum and transition into the next movement.\n*   **Instance 5:** In the latter half of the solo, around the 1:05 mark, another clear pas de Balanchine is performed with the characteristic off-balance and angular quality of Forsythe's choreography.\n*   **Instance 6:** Towards the end of the solo, at about the 1:21 mark, there is one final, very quick pas de Balanchine used as a connector step leading into the final movements.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **Distinguishing from other steps:** The solo contains many rapid footwork sequences, including other types of *pas de bourrées*. The analysis must specifically isolate the three-step pattern that resolves in a forward lunge. Other three-step movements that do not end in this lunge are not counted.\n*   **Forsythe's style:** The execution is not a \"textbook\" classical version. The steps are performed with a modern, deconstructed aesthetic. The key is to recognize the underlying classical step within the stylized choreography.\n*   **Video quality and angle:** The accuracy of the count depends on a clear view of the dancer's feet. The available video from the Semperoper Ballett provides a clear enough view for this analysis.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nAfter a detailed, step-by-step review of the choreography in the video of the performance, counting only the movements that fit the specific \"back-side-front lunge\" definition of a pas de Balanchine, the total number identified is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
