    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the equation.\n\n**Step 1: Identify and convert each Roman numeral to a modern number.**\n\nThe equation provided is `XXIV / CXCI - CMLXXXVII = ?`. We need to convert each Roman numeral part into its modern (Arabic) numeral equivalent.\n\n*   **XXIV:**\n    *   `XX` represents 10 + 10 = 20.\n    *   `IV` represents 5 - 1 = 4 (subtractive principle).\n    *   Therefore, `XXIV` = 20 + 4 = **24**.\n\n*   **CXCI:**\n    *   `C` represents 100.\n    *   `XC` represents 100 - 10 = 90 (subtractive principle).\n    *   `I` represents 1.\n    *   Therefore, `CXCI` = 100 + 90 + 1 = **191**.\n\n*   **CMLXXXVII:**\n    *   `CM` represents 1000 - 100 = 900 (subtractive principle).\n    *   `LXXX` represents 50 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 80.\n    *   `VII` represents 5 + 1 + 1 = 7.\n    *   Therefore, `CMLXXXVII` = 900 + 80 + 7 = **987**.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly apply the rules of Roman numerals, especially the subtractive principle where a smaller numeral placed before a larger one is subtracted (e.g., IV, XC, CM).\n\n**Step 2: Substitute the modern numbers into the equation.**\n\nReplacing the Roman numerals with their modern values, the equation becomes:\n\n`24 / 191 - 987 = ?`\n\n**Step 3: Solve the equation using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).**\n\nAccording to the order of operations, division must be performed before subtraction.\n\n*   **First, perform the division:**\n    `24 / 191 ≈ 0.12565445`\n\n*   **Next, perform the subtraction:**\n    `0.12565445 - 987 = -986.87434555`\n\n**Careful Point:** Always follow the mathematical order of operations. Performing subtraction before division would lead to a completely different and incorrect result.\n\n**Step 4: Round the final answer.**\n\nThe result is a long decimal. Rounding it to a reasonable number of decimal places, for example, four, gives us:\n\n`≈ -986.8743`\n\nFinal Answer Acquisition:\n1.  Convert Roman Numerals: XXIV = 24, CXCI = 191, CMLXXXVII = 987.\n2.  Formulate the equation: 24 / 191 - 987.\n3.  Calculate division: 24 / 191 ≈ 0.1257.\n4.  Calculate subtraction: 0.1257 - 987 = -986.8743.\n\nThe solution to the equation is approximately -986.8743.\n\n<<<-986.8743455497382>>>"
