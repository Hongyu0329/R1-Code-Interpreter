    "This problem asks for the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan (2D square) lattice, which we denote as a(10).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** A 2D grid of points with integer coordinates (x, y).\n*   **Walk:** A sequence of points starting from an origin, say (0,0), where each new point is a single step away from the previous one.\n*   **Step:** A move from a point (x,y) to an adjacent point. The four possible adjacent points are (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), and (x, y-1). These correspond to moves East, West, North, and South.\n*   **n-step walk:** A walk consisting of n consecutive steps.\n*   **Self-avoiding walk (SAW):** A walk that never visits the same point more than once.\n*   **a(n):** The total number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks. We count walks that follow different sequences of moves as distinct, even if they result in a shape that is a rotation or reflection of another.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating for Small `n`\nTo understand the problem, let's calculate the first few values of a(n) by hand. We can assume the walk starts at (0,0) without loss of generality.\n\n*   **a(1):**\n    From the origin (0,0), there are 4 possible moves: North, South, East, or West. All of these are 1-step self-avoiding walks.\n    So, **a(1) = 4**.\n\n*   **a(2):**\n    We start with the 4 paths of length 1. For each of these, we take a second step. The only rule for a 2-step SAW is that the second step cannot return to the origin. This means we cannot immediately reverse the first step.\n    For each of the 4 initial moves, there are 3 valid moves for the second step.\n    For example, if the first step was East to (1,0), the second step can be North, East, or South, but not West (which would lead back to (0,0)).\n    Total number of walks = (Choices for 1st step) × (Choices for 2nd step) = 4 × 3 = 12.\n    So, **a(2) = 12**.\n\n*   **a(3):**\n    We extend the 12 paths of length 2. A walk is (p0, p1, p2). We add a third step to a point p3.\n    The path is self-avoiding if p3 is not p0, p1, or p2.\n    - p3 cannot be p2 because we cannot immediately reverse a step.\n    - Can p3 be p0? Let p0=(0,0). A 2-step SAW endpoint p2 will be at coordinates like (2,0), (-2,0), (0,2), (0,-2), (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), or (-1,-1). None of these points are adjacent to the origin p0=(0,0). Therefore, a single step from p2 cannot land on p0. So, p3 can never be p0.\n    - p3 cannot be p1 by the same token as it can't be p2 (immediate reversal).\n    This means for any of the 12 paths of length 2, we have 3 valid choices for the third step.\n    Total number of walks = 12 × 3 = 36.\n    So, **a(3) = 36**.\n\n*   **a(4):**\n    We extend the 36 paths of length 3. Let a path be (p0, p1, p2, p3). We add a fourth step to p4.\n    The path is self-avoiding if p4 is not in {p0, p1, p2, p3}.\n    - p4 ≠ p3 (no immediate reversal).\n    - p4 ≠ p2 (A 2-step SAW p2-p3-p4 cannot have p4=p2 unless p3=p2, which isn't the case).\n    - **Careful Point:** Can p4 = p0? This would happen if the endpoint of a 3-step walk, p3, is adjacent to the starting point, p0.\n    Let's count how many 3-step walks have this property. An example is East-North-West, which is the path (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (0,1). The endpoint p3=(0,1) is adjacent to p0=(0,0).\n    A systematic count reveals there are exactly **8** such 3-step paths (they form three sides of a 1x1 square).\n    For these 8 paths, one of the 3 possible non-reversing moves for the fourth step would land on p0, which is forbidden. So, these 8 paths have only **2** valid extensions. (8 paths × 2 extensions = 16 new paths).\n    For the remaining 36 - 8 = **28** paths of length 3, the endpoint p3 is not adjacent to p0. Therefore, a fourth step cannot land on p0. For these paths, there are **3** valid extensions. (28 paths × 3 extensions = 84 new paths).\n    Total number of 4-step walks = 16 + 84 = 100.\n    So, **a(4) = 100**.\n\n### Step 3: Complexity for Larger `n`\nAs `n` increases, this manual calculation becomes extremely difficult. For an n-step walk, the new point p_n cannot be any of the previously visited points {p0, p1, ..., p_{n-1}}.\nA key observation (the **parity argument**) is that after `k` steps from (0,0) to a point (x,y), the sum of coordinates `x+y` must have the same parity as `k`. This means `p_n` can only intersect with `p_k` if `n` and `k` are both even or both odd.\nFor `n=10`, the new point `p10` could potentially land on previous points `p8, p6, p4, p2, p0`. Calculating how many `(n-1)`-step paths have endpoints adjacent to these previous points is a major combinatorial challenge.\n\n### Step 4: Finding a(10)\nThis is a famous problem in computational physics and combinatorics. The sequence `a(n)` is well-studied, and its values have been computed and tabulated. It corresponds to sequence A001411 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). Manual calculation for n=10 is not feasible. We rely on these known computational results.\n\nThe sequence begins (starting with a(0)=1):\n*   a(0) = 1\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   **a(10) = 44,100**\n\nThus, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
