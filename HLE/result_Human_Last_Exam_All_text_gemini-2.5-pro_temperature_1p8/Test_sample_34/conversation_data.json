    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Game Conditions**\n\n*   **Game:** 100BB No-Limit Hold'em cash game. This is the standard for deep-stacked play, where post-flop maneuverability is very important.\n*   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the most powerful position in poker. You are guaranteed to act last on every post-flop street (flop, turn, river). This positional advantage allows you to realize your hand's equity more effectively, making it profitable to play a much wider range of hands.\n*   **Action:** Open-raising to 2.5x. This is a standard open size from late position, designed to steal the blinds or build a pot with a strong range while having position.\n*   **Rake:** Rake-free. This is a critical detail. In a normal game, rake is taken from the pot, which slightly discourages playing marginal hands that win small pots. In a rake-free environment, any hand that can be opened for a marginal profit becomes a clear open-raise because you keep 100% of your winnings. This pushes us to open an even wider, more aggressive range.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Hand Selection from the Button**\n\nGiven the immense advantage of the button and the rake-free structure, a Game Theory Optimal (GTO) strategy involves opening a very wide range of hands, typically 45-55% of all possible starting hands. The goal is to apply pressure on the blinds and be able to play profitably post-flop with a positional advantage.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the \"Suited Jacks\" Category (JXs)**\n\nWe need to rank the suited Jack hands from best to worst to find the one at the very bottom of the opening range. The value of these hands comes from a combination of:\n1.  **Flush Potential:** All suited hands have this.\n2.  **Straight Potential (Connectivity):** How easily the hand can make a straight. Hands with cards close in rank (connectors like JTs) are better than gappers (like J8s) or large gappers (like J4s).\n3.  **High Card Value:** The Jack provides decent high-card strength, but the kicker (the 'X' card) also matters.\n\nLet's rank them:\n*   **Best (Premium Connectors):** JTs, J9s. These are extremely strong hands with excellent flush and straight potential.\n*   **Good (Suited Gappers):** J8s, J7s. Still very playable, good flush potential, and reasonable straight draws.\n*   **Playable (Wider Gappers):** J6s, J5s. Straight potential is decreasing, but still present. J5s is slightly better than J6s as it can connect to make a \"wheel\" straight (A-2-3-4-5) as well as a Jack-high straight.\n*   **Weakest (Bottom-Tier Gappers):** J4s, J3s, J2s. These hands have the weakest kickers and the worst connectivity. Their value comes almost exclusively from their flush potential and occasionally flopping two pair or trips.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the \"Worst\" Hand to Open**\n\nThe question asks for the \"worst\" suited Jack you *should* open. In this specific scenario (BTN, 100BB, rake-free), GTO strategies advocate for opening *all* suited Jack hands. The profitability of stealing the blinds, combined with having position and the ability to make the nut flush, makes even the weakest suited Jack a profitable open-raise.\n\nSince all suited Jacks are correct opens, the \"worst\" one is simply the one that is objectively the weakest hand in the JXs category. We need to compare the bottom-tier hands:\n*   **J4s vs. J3s vs. J2s:**\n    *   All have identical flush potential.\n    *   The primary difference is their straight potential. J4s has a 3-gap to a straight (needs 5-6-7). J3s has a 4-gap (needs 4-5-6). J2s has a 5-gap (needs 3-4-5).\n    *   The connectivity gets progressively worse as the second card gets lower. Therefore, **J2s** has the worst straight potential. Its low card offers almost no synergistic value with the Jack.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nA GTO opening range from the button in a 100BB rake-free game is extremely wide and includes all suited Jacks. The weakest hand within this sub-category, and therefore the one that is just barely clearing the profitability hurdle, is J2s. It has the worst kicker and the poorest connectivity, making it the \"worst\" suited jack you should still open.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
