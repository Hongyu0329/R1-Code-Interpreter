    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Basics of Surface Code Encoding:**\n    *   **Surface Code Patch:** A surface code is a topological quantum error-correcting code defined on a 2D lattice of physical qubits. A single, standard \"patch\" of planar surface code is constructed to have boundaries that allow it to encode exactly **one** logical qubit. This is the baseline capacity of one patch.\n    *   **The Role of Holes:** A \"hole\" is a region created within the surface code patch where stabilizers are intentionally not measured. Topologically, a hole is a new boundary inside the main patch. Each hole that is introduced allows for the encoding of **one additional** logical qubit. The logical operators for this new qubit are defined relative to the hole's boundary (e.g., a loop operator around the hole and a string operator from the hole to an outer edge).\n    *   **Formula for a Single Patch:** Based on the above points, the number of logical qubits ($k$) that can be encoded in a single patch with $h$ holes is given by the formula:\n        $k = 1 + h$\n        (1 for the patch itself, plus 1 for each hole).\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Problem's Configuration:**\n    *   We are given **two** independent patches of surface code. Let's call them Patch A and Patch B.\n    *   We have a total of **two** holes to use.\n    *   Our goal is to distribute these two holes between the two patches in a way that maximizes the total number of encoded logical qubits.\n\n3.  **Enumerating Possible Hole Distributions:**\n    Let $h_A$ be the number of holes in Patch A and $h_B$ be the number of holes in Patch B. The constraint is that the total number of holes is two:\n    $h_A + h_B = 2$\n    Since the number of holes must be a non-negative integer, there are two possible ways to distribute the holes (the order doesn't matter, so (2,0) is the same as (0,2)):\n\n    *   **Case 1: Both holes in one patch.**\n        *   Patch A gets 2 holes ($h_A = 2$).\n        *   Patch B gets 0 holes ($h_B = 0$).\n\n    *   **Case 2: One hole in each patch.**\n        *   Patch A gets 1 hole ($h_A = 1$).\n        *   Patch B gets 1 hole ($h_B = 1$).\n\n4.  **Calculating the Total Logical Qubits for Each Case:**\n    The total number of logical qubits ($K_{total}$) is the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n    $K_{total} = (\\text{qubits in Patch A}) + (\\text{qubits in Patch B})$\n    $K_{total} = (1 + h_A) + (1 + h_B)$\n\n    *   **Calculation for Case 1 (2 holes in one patch, 0 in the other):**\n        *   Qubits in Patch A: $k_A = 1 + h_A = 1 + 2 = 3$\n        *   Qubits in Patch B: $k_B = 1 + h_B = 1 + 0 = 1$\n        *   Total Qubits: $K_{total} = 3 + 1 = 4$\n\n    *   **Calculation for Case 2 (1 hole in each patch):**\n        *   Qubits in Patch A: $k_A = 1 + h_A = 1 + 1 = 2$\n        *   Qubits in Patch B: $k_B = 1 + h_B = 1 + 1 = 2$\n        *   Total Qubits: $K_{total} = 2 + 2 = 4$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both possible distributions of the two holes result in the same total number of logical qubits: 4. Therefore, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in this configuration is 4.\n\n    Alternatively, we can see this directly from the formula for the total number of qubits:\n    $K_{total} = (1 + h_A) + (1 + h_B) = 2 + (h_A + h_B)$\n    Since the total number of holes is fixed at $h_A + h_B = 2$, the total number of logical qubits is always:\n    $K_{total} = 2 + 2 = 4$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Definition of a \"Patch\":** It is crucial to understand that a standard planar code \"patch\" is assumed to be capable of encoding one logical qubit by itself.\n*   **Independence of Patches:** The problem states \"two patches,\" implying they are separate and do not interact. Their logical qubit capacities simply add up.\n*   **Counting Holes:** Holes are distinct features within a patch. The method for distributing them is a simple integer partition problem.\n*   **The formula $k = 1+h$:** This is the key to solving the problem and relies on the standard interpretation of how logical qubits are created in planar surface codes with defects (holes).\n\n<<<4>>>"
