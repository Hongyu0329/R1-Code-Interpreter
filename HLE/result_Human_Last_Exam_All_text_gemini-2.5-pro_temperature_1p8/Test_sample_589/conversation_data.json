    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The query asks for a specific film with several key visual and contextual elements:\n    *   **Type of Production:** A Hollywood feature film.\n    *   **Producer:** A major film studio.\n    *   **Character:** A teenager.\n    *   **Prop:** A pink bike.\n    *   **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike *directly toward* an oncoming car.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Elimination:**\n    *   **Teen Movies:** Films like *Pretty in Pink* or *Sixteen Candles* come to mind due to the \"teenager\" and \"pink\" elements, but they do not feature this specific scene.\n    *   **Horror Films:** *A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge* has a memorable scene with a vehicle and a pink bike/tricycle. However, the riders are two very young girls, not a teenager, and the vehicle is a school bus that swerves to avoid them, not a car they are pedaling toward. This does not fit the criteria.\n    *   **Action/Sci-Fi Films:** Movies like *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* have famous bike scenes but do not match the specific details of a pink bike being ridden toward a car.\n\n3.  **Focusing on the Specific Scene:** The action of \"pedaling directly toward an oncoming car\" suggests a moment of confrontation, defiance, or awkwardness rather than a simple accident. This narrows the search to films with a quirky or confrontational tone.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Correct Film:** The 2004 cult classic **Napoleon Dynamite** contains a scene that matches all the criteria perfectly.\n    *   **Hollywood Feature Film from a Major Studio:** It was produced by Fox Searchlight Pictures (the specialty division of 20th Century Fox) and MTV Films. Fox Searchlight is considered a major player in Hollywood, satisfying this condition.\n    *   **Teenager:** The character in the scene is **Deb Bradshaw**, a high school student and friend of the titular character.\n    *   **Pink Bike:** Deb is shown riding a distinctive light pink bicycle.\n    *   **Pedaling Toward an Oncoming Car:** In one scene, Deb is riding her pink bike down a dirt road. Uncle Rico drives his orange van (a type of car/automotive vehicle) directly toward her. Instead of moving out of the way, Deb continues to pedal straight at him, forcing Rico to swerve his van off the road while yelling, \"Idiot!\"\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Vehicle Type:** The question specifies a \"car.\" In the film, the vehicle is a large passenger van. For the purpose of a general description, a van is typically acceptable as a type of \"car\" or motor vehicle, and the confrontation dynamic is the same.\n*   **Studio Classification:** While Fox Searchlight Pictures was a \"specialty division,\" it was owned and operated by a major studio (20th Century Fox) and is widely regarded as a major producer of feature films, especially award-winning ones.\n*   **Character Specificity:** It is not the main character (Napoleon) on the bike, but a prominent teenage supporting character (Deb).\n\nBy carefully analyzing all the specific details provided in the question, we can confidently identify the film.\n\nThe film is **Napoleon Dynamite**.\n\n<<<Napoleon Dynamite>>>"
