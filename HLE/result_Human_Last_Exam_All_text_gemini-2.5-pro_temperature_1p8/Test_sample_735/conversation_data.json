    "Answering this question requires analyzing the properties of maximal product-free sets and applying known theorems from group theory, particularly a classification theorem for the groups in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions.**\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A non-empty subset S of a group G is product-free if for any two elements a, b ∈ S (which can be the same element), their product `ab` is not in S. In set notation, this is `S · S ∩ S = ∅`.\n*   **Maximality by Inclusion:** A product-free set S is maximal if it cannot be extended by adding any element from the group without losing the product-free property. That is, for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is *not* product-free.\n*   **The Question:** We are looking for the number of non-isomorphic finite groups G that contain at least one maximal product-free set S with `|S| = 3`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the condition of maximality.**\n\nLet S be a maximal product-free set. For any `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S' = S ∪ {g}` is not product-free. This means there exist `x, y ∈ S'` such that `xy ∈ S'`.\nSince S itself is product-free, we cannot have both x and y in S. So, at least one of x or y must be g. This leads to the following possibilities for any `g ∈ G \\ S`:\n1.  `g · g ∈ S ∪ {g}` (i.e., `g² ∈ S` or `g² = g`).\n2.  `g · s ∈ S ∪ {g}` for some `s ∈ S` (i.e., `gs ∈ S` or `gs = g`).\n3.  `s · g ∈ S ∪ {g}` for some `s ∈ S` (i.e., `sg ∈ S` or `sg = g`).\n\nA few careful points:\n*   The identity element `e` cannot be in a product-free set S, because if `e ∈ S`, then for any `s ∈ S`, `e · s = s ∈ S`, which violates the product-free condition (unless S is the empty set, which is disallowed).\n*   Since `e ∉ S`, `e` must be in `G \\ S`. Thus, the maximality condition must apply to `g = e`. For `g = e`, we have `g² = e² = e`, so `g² ∈ S ∪ {g}` is satisfied. This means the maximality condition for the identity element `e` provides no special constraints on the group or the set S.\n*   The conditions `gs = g` or `sg = g` imply `s = e`. Since `e ∉ S`, these cases are impossible.\n\nSo, for any `g ∈ G \\ (S ∪ {e})`, one of the following must hold:\n*   `g² ∈ S`\n*   `gs ∈ S` for some `s ∈ S`\n*   `sg ∈ S` for some `s ∈ S`\n\n**Step 3: Apply a known theorem for small groups.**\n\nA key theorem by Street and Whitehead states that if S is a product-free set in a group G of order n, and `|S| > n/3`, then S must be a coset of a normal subgroup H of G, where `|H| = |S|`.\n\nWe are given `|S| = 3`. The condition `|S| > |G|/3` is `3 > |G|/3`, which simplifies to `|G| < 9`. So, for any group G with order less than 9 that has such a set, the order of the group, `|G|`, must be divisible by `|H| = |S| = 3`.\n\nLet's check groups with `|G| < 9`:\n*   **|G| = 1, 2, 3:** Too small to contain a set of size 3.\n*   **|G| = 4, 5:** Not divisible by 3. They cannot have a maximal product-free set of size 3.\n*   **|G| = 7, 8:** Not divisible by 3. They cannot have a maximal product-free set of size 3.\n*   **|G| = 6:** Divisible by 3. We check the two groups of order 6, C₆ (cyclic) and S₃ (dihedral).\n    *   **C₆:** Let S = {x², x³, x⁵}. This set is product-free and can be shown to be maximal. For instance, the elements of `S` form a coset of the subgroup H = {e, x², x⁴}. (In additive notation, G=Z₆, S={3,5,1}. S is max sum-free). So, **C₆** is one such group.\n    *   **S₃:** Let S be the set of transpositions, S = {(12), (13), (23)}. The product of any two distinct elements is a 3-cycle, and the square of any element is the identity, so `S · S = {e, (123), (132)}`. `S` is product-free. It can also be shown to be maximal. So, **S₃** is another such group.\n\n**Step 4: Consider groups with `|G| ≥ 9`.**\n\nFor `|G| ≥ 9`, the condition `|S| > |G|/3` does not hold, so we cannot use the Street-Whitehead theorem. Proving the full classification from first principles is extremely complex and requires re-deriving results from advanced research papers. The definitive result comes from a 2016 paper by M. Giudici and S. Hart, \"Maximal product-free sets in finite groups,\" which provides a complete classification. We will use their result.\n\nAccording to their findings, a finite group G has a maximal product-free set of size 3 if and only if G is isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1.  **C₆** (Cyclic group of order 6)\n2.  **S₃** (Symmetric group on 3 elements, order 6)\n3.  **C₉** (Cyclic group of order 9)\n4.  **C₃ × C₃** (Elementary abelian group of order 9)\n5.  **D₁₀** (Dihedral group of order 10)\n6.  **C₁₂** (Cyclic group of order 12)\n7.  **C₂ × C₆** (Abelian group of order 12)\n8.  **Dic₃** (Dicyclic group of order 12, also denoted T or Q₁₂)\n9.  **PSL(2,7)** (Projective special linear group, order 168)\n\n**Step 5: Verify the groups are non-isomorphic and count them.**\n\nWe check if the groups in the list are distinct up to isomorphism.\n*   Groups of order 6: **C₆** is abelian, **S₃** is non-abelian. (2 groups)\n*   Groups of order 9: **C₉** is cyclic, **C₃ × C₃** is not. Both are abelian. (2 groups)\n*   Group of order 10: **D₁₀** is the only one listed. (1 group)\n*   Groups of order 12: **C₁₂** (abelian, cyclic), **C₂ × C₆** (abelian, non-cyclic), **Dic₃** (non-abelian). These three are non-isomorphic. (3 groups)\n*   Group of order 168: **PSL(2,7)** is the only one listed. (1 group)\n\nAll the groups in the list are indeed non-isomorphic.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\n\nSumming the number of groups from each order:\n2 (from order 6) + 2 (from order 9) + 1 (from order 10) + 3 (from order 12) + 1 (from order 168) = 9.\n\nThere are 9 such non-isomorphic finite groups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
