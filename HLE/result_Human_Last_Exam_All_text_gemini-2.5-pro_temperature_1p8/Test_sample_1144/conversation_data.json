    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Question**\n\nThe core task is to determine the ratio of two quantities:\n1.  **The uncertainty in the momentum of an electron ($\\Delta p$)**: This must be calculated using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n2.  **The momentum of the electron ($p$)**: This must be calculated based on the Bohr model for the first orbit ($n=1$).\n\nWe are given one piece of information:\n*   The uncertainty in the electron's position, $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$.\n\n### **2. Careful Points and Required Formulas**\n\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**: This principle states the fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties can be known. For position and momentum, the relation is:\n    $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$\n    For the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality:\n    $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$\n\n2.  **Bohr's Model for Momentum**: Bohr's model quantizes the angular momentum ($L$) of an electron in an orbit:\n    $L = mvr = n\\frac{h}{2\\pi}$\n    where $p=mv$ is the linear momentum. So, for the first orbit ($n=1$), the equation becomes:\n    $p \\cdot r_1 = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$\n    where $r_1$ is the radius of the first Bohr orbit.\n\n3.  **Constants**: We will need the following physical constants:\n    *   Planck's constant, $h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ JÂ·s}$.\n    *   Radius of the first Bohr orbit (Bohr radius), $r_1 = a_0 = 0.529 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}$.\n\n4.  **Unit Consistency**: The given uncertainty $\\Delta x$ is in picometers (pm), while the Bohr radius is typically given in meters or angstroms. We must ensure the units are consistent before calculating the final ratio.\n    *   $1 \\text{ pm} = 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$.\n    *   So, $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$.\n    *   $r_1 = 0.529 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m} = 52.9 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m} = 52.9 \\text{ pm}$.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n#### **Step 1: Express the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$)**\n\nFrom the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n$\\Delta p = \\frac{h}{4\\pi \\Delta x}$\n\n#### **Step 2: Express the momentum ($p$) in the first Bohr orbit**\n\nFrom the Bohr model for $n=1$:\n$p = \\frac{h}{2\\pi r_1}$\n\n#### **Step 3: Formulate the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$**\n\nNow we divide the expression from Step 1 by the expression from Step 2:\nRatio $= \\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{h}{4\\pi \\Delta x}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{h}{2\\pi r_1}\\right)}$\n\nWe can simplify this expression by multiplying the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator:\nRatio $= \\left(\\frac{h}{4\\pi \\Delta x}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{2\\pi r_1}{h}\\right)$\n\nThe Planck's constant $h$ and the term $2\\pi$ cancel out:\nRatio $= \\frac{2\\pi r_1 h}{4\\pi \\Delta x h} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\nThis simplified formula allows us to directly calculate the ratio without needing the value of Planck's constant.\n\n#### **Step 4: Substitute the given values and calculate the final answer**\n\nWe have:\n*   $r_1 = 0.529 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}$ (or 52.9 pm)\n*   $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$\n\nUsing the simplified ratio formula (it's easiest to use picometers for both lengths):\nRatio $= \\frac{52.9 \\text{ pm}}{2 \\times 10 \\text{ pm}}$\nRatio $= \\frac{52.9}{20}$\nRatio $= 2.645$\n\nThe ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum is 2.645.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
