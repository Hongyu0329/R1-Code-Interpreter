    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the probability of finding the particle in the specified interval.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Question**\n\n*   **System:** A quantum particle confined to a one-dimensional (1D) box.\n*   **Box dimensions:** The box has length `a`, extending from `x = 0` to `x = a`.\n*   **Quantum State:** The particle is in the second energy level, which corresponds to the principal quantum number `n = 2`.\n*   **Objective:** Calculate the probability of finding the particle within the small interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n\n**2. Recall the Relevant Physics Principles**\n\n*   **Wavefunction:** The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is given by:\n    ψₙ(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n*   **Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle per unit length at a position `x` is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction, |ψₙ(x)|². This is the probability density function, `P(x)`.\n    P(x) = |ψₙ(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)\n*   **Probability over an Interval:** To find the probability of the particle being in a finite interval [x₁, x₂], we must integrate the probability density function over that interval:\n    Probability = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] P(x) dx = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a) dx\n\n**3. Set Up the Calculation for n = 2**\n\n*   For `n = 2`, the probability density is:\n    P(x) = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n*   The interval is [0.495a, 0.505a]. So, the integral we need to solve is:\n    Probability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\n**4. Analyze the Integrand and the Interval (Careful Points)**\n\n*   **The interval is small:** The width of the interval is Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a.\n*   **The interval is centered at a node:** The center of the interval is x = 0.5a (or a/2). Let's evaluate the probability density at this point for n=2:\n    P(a/2) = (2/a) * sin²(2π(a/2)/a) = (2/a) * sin²(π) = (2/a) * (0)² = 0.\n    For the n=2 state, there is a node (zero probability) exactly at the center of the box.\n*   **Approximation issue:** Since the probability density is zero at the center of our interval, a simple approximation like `Probability ≈ P(center) * Δx` would give an answer of 0, which is incorrect. The probability is small, but not exactly zero because the interval has a finite width.\n*   **Better approach:** We must either perform the exact integration or use a more suitable approximation (like a Taylor series expansion) that accounts for how the function changes around the node. The approximation method is often easier for calculation.\n\n**5. Calculation using Taylor Series Approximation**\n\nSince the interval is small and centered around the node at x = a/2, we can approximate the `sin²` function near this point.\n\n*   Let's define a new variable `ε = x - a/2`. This represents the displacement from the center. The interval for `ε` is from `(0.495a - a/2) = -0.005a` to `(0.505a - a/2) = +0.005a`.\n*   Rewrite the argument of the sine function in terms of `ε`:\n    2πx/a = 2π(a/2 + ε)/a = π + 2πε/a\n*   Substitute this into the `sin²` function:\n    sin²(2πx/a) = sin²(π + 2πε/a)\n*   Using the trigonometric identity sin(π + θ) = -sin(θ), we get:\n    sin²(π + 2πε/a) = [-sin(2πε/a)]² = sin²(2πε/a)\n*   Now, for a very small argument `y`, we can use the small-angle approximation `sin(y) ≈ y`. Here, `y = 2πε/a` is very small.\n    sin²(2πε/a) ≈ (2πε/a)² = 4π²ε²/a²\n*   Substitute this approximation back into the integral for the probability. The variable of integration also changes from `dx` to `dε`.\n    Probability ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] (2/a) * (4π²ε²/a²) dε\n    Probability ≈ (8π²/a³) ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] ε² dε\n*   Now, perform the integration:\n    ∫ ε² dε = ε³/3\n*   Evaluate the definite integral:\n    Probability ≈ (8π²/a³) * [ε³/3] from -0.005a to +0.005a\n    Probability ≈ (8π²/3a³) * [(+0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³]\n    Probability ≈ (8π²/3a³) * [2 * (0.005a)³]\n    Probability ≈ (16π²/3a³) * (0.005³ * a³)\n    The `a³` terms cancel out.\n    Probability ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\n*   Calculate the final numerical value:\n    π² ≈ 9.8696\n    (0.005)³ = (5 x 10⁻³)³ = 125 x 10⁻⁹ = 1.25 x 10⁻⁷\n    Probability ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)\n    Probability ≈ (52.638) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)\n    Probability ≈ 65.7975 x 10⁻⁷ ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶\n\nThe probability that the particle is located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n = 2 is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
