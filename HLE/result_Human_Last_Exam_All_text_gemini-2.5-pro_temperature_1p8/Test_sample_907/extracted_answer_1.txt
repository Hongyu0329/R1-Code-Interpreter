The equations for the absorption cross-section $\sigma(\omega)$ are:

**a) The interaction between molecules can be neglected:**
The absorption spectrum consists of a single peak at the excitation energy of an isolated molecule, $E_0$. The intensity is the incoherent sum of the absorptions of all $N$ molecules.
$$ \sigma_a(\omega) = \frac{N \pi \omega |\vec{\mu}_{\text{mol}}|^2}{\hbar c n \epsilon_0} \delta\left(\omega - \frac{E_0}{\hbar}\right) $$

**b) The interaction between near-neighbors should be considered:**
Due to exciton formation, a selection rule arises allowing transitions only to the $k=0$ exciton state. This concentrates the entire absorption strength into a single peak, shifted in energy by the interaction.
$$ \sigma_b(\omega) = \frac{N \pi \omega |\vec{\mu}_{\text{mol}}|^2}{\hbar c n \epsilon_0} \delta\left(\omega - \frac{E_0 - 2J}{\hbar}\right) $$

where:
*   $N$ is the number of molecules in the chain.
*   $\omega$ is the angular frequency of light.
*   $|\vec{\mu}_{\text{mol}}|$ is the magnitude of the transition dipole moment of a single molecule.
*   $E_0$ is the excitation energy of a single molecule.
*   $J$ is the nearest-neighbor coupling energy.
*   $\hbar, c, n, \epsilon_0$ are physical constants (reduced Planck constant, speed of light, refractive index, vacuum permittivity).
*   $\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta function, representing an infinitely sharp absorption line.
