    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category $\\mathcal{C}$ from an object $A$ to an object $B$ is a pair of 1-morphisms $f: A \\to B$ and $g: B \\to A$ together with 2-morphisms (the unit and counit) $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_A \\Rightarrow g \\circ f$ and $\\epsilon: f \\circ g \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_B$ satisfying certain coherence conditions (the triangle identities).\n\nIn this problem, the 2-category is the simplex category $\\Delta$ viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$.\n\n**Step 1: Unpacking the definitions**\n*   **Objects of $\\Delta$**: The objects are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$. These are totally ordered sets. In this question, the objects are $[23]$ and $[37]$.\n*   **1-Morphisms in $\\Delta$**: A morphism $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is an order-preserving map, i.e., if $i \\leq j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\leq f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n*   **2-Morphisms in $\\Delta$**: Since $\\Delta$ is a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, for any two parallel morphisms $h_1, h_2: [m] \\to [n]$, a 2-morphism $h_1 \\Rightarrow h_2$ exists if and only if $h_1 \\leq h_2$ in the pointwise order. That is, $h_1(i) \\leq h_2(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n\n**Step 2: Characterizing an internal adjunction in $\\Delta$**\nAn internal adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ consists of a pair of order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and $g: [n] \\to [m]$ such that the unit and counit inequalities hold:\n1.  **Unit**: $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\leq g \\circ f$. This means for all $i \\in [m]$, $i \\leq (g \\circ f)(i) = g(f(i))$.\n2.  **Counit**: $f \\circ g \\leq \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$. This means for all $j \\in [n]$, $(f \\circ g)(j) = f(g(j)) \\leq j$.\n\nThis pair of conditions is precisely the definition of a Galois connection between the posets $[m]$ and $[n]$, where $f$ is the left adjoint and $g$ is the right adjoint. This is often written as $f \\dashv g$. The conditions are equivalent to the single statement:\nFor all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$, $f(i) \\leq j \\iff i \\leq g(j)$.\n\n**Step 3: Reducing the counting problem**\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by either its left adjoint or its right adjoint. For instance, if we know $f$, its right adjoint $g$ is uniquely determined by the formula $g(j) = \\max \\{i \\in [m] \\mid f(i) \\leq j\\}$. Similarly, if $g$ is known, $f(i) = \\min \\{j \\in [n] \\mid i \\leq g(j)\\}$.\n\nThus, counting the number of adjunctions is equivalent to counting the number of possible left adjoint maps $f: [23] \\to [37]$.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the condition for a map to be a left adjoint**\nA map between posets is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins).\nFor an order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ between two totally ordered sets, preservation of non-empty suprema (which are just maxima) is automatically satisfied.\nThe only remaining condition is that $f$ must preserve the supremum of the empty set, which is the bottom element of the poset.\nSo, an order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if $f(0_{[m]}) = 0_{[n]}$. In our case, this condition is $f(0) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to count the number of order-preserving maps $f: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $f(0) = 0$.\n\n**Step 5: Solving the combinatorial problem**\nAn order-preserving map $f: [23] \\to [37]$ is specified by the sequence of its values:\n$f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$\nThis must be a non-decreasing sequence of integers:\n$f(0) \\leq f(1) \\leq \\dots \\leq f(23)$\nThe values must be in the codomain $[37]$, so $0 \\leq f(i) \\leq 37$ for all $i$.\n\nThe condition for $f$ to be a left adjoint is $f(0)=0$. This fixes the first term of the sequence.\nSo we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences:\n$0 \\leq f(1) \\leq f(2) \\leq \\dots \\leq f(23) \\leq 37$.\n\nLet $y_k = f(k)$ for $k=1, \\dots, 23$. We are looking for the number of sequences $(y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_{23})$ such that $0 \\leq y_1 \\leq y_2 \\leq \\dots \\leq y_{23} \\leq 37$.\n\nThis is a classic stars and bars problem. It is equivalent to choosing 23 numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ with replacement, where the order of selection doesn't matter (since we arrange them in non-decreasing order).\n*   The number of items to choose is $k = 23$.\n*   The number of categories to choose from is $n = |\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}| = 38$.\n\nThe formula for combinations with repetition is $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$.\nSubstituting our values:\nNumber of adjunctions = $\\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n**Alternative Check (counting right adjoints)**\nWe could also count the number of right adjoints $g: [37] \\to [23]$. A map is a right adjoint if it preserves all infima (meets). For totally ordered sets, this reduces to preserving the top element, i.e., $g(37)=23$.\nWe need to count order-preserving maps $g: [37] \\to [23]$ with $g(37)=23$.\nThis means counting non-decreasing sequences $z_0, z_1, \\dots, z_{37}$ where $z_j = g(j)$ such that:\n$0 \\leq z_0 \\leq z_1 \\leq \\dots \\leq z_{37} \\leq 23$ and $z_{37}=23$.\nSo we must count sequences $0 \\leq z_0 \\leq \\dots \\leq z_{36} \\leq 23$.\nThis is choosing $k=37$ numbers (for $z_0, \\dots, z_{36}$) from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$, which has $n=24$ elements.\nThe number is $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nUsing the identity $\\binom{N}{K} = \\binom{N}{N-K}$, we have $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$. The result is consistent.\n\nThe final answer is the binomial coefficient $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<Binomial(60, 23)>>>"
