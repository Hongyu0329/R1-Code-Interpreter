It is impossible to count the stars directly. Astronomers estimate by counting the stars in a small section of the sky and then extrapolating that number for the entire sky. To estimate the total for the universe, they multiply the estimated number of galaxies by the average number of stars per galaxy. The current approximate number is 10^24, or one septillion.
