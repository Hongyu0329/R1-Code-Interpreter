    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object and the question**\n*   $X$ is a smooth hypersurface in complex projective 3-space, $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n*   It is defined by a single homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n*   $X$ is a complex submanifold of dimension 2, which means it is a real manifold of dimension 4.\n*   $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a complex manifold of dimension 3, and a real manifold of dimension 6.\n*   We want to find the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$. The rank of an abelian group is the dimension of its free part, or equivalently, the dimension of its rationalization $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ as a vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem to determine the connectivity of X**\nThe Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem relates the topology of a submanifold to its ambient space. The homotopy version states:\n*   Let $Y$ be a smooth complex projective variety of complex dimension $n$, and let $X$ be a smooth hyperplane section of $Y$. The inclusion map $i: X \\to Y$ induces isomorphisms $i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(Y)$ for $k < n-1$ and a surjection for $k = n-1$.\n\nIn our case, $Y = \\mathbb{CP}^3$, so the complex dimension is $n=3$. $X$ is a smooth hypersurface (a generalized hyperplane section). Thus, the theorem applies.\n*   The isomorphisms hold for $k < 3-1 = 2$.\n*   For $k=1$, we have an isomorphism: $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$.\n*   It is a standard fact that complex projective spaces are simply connected, i.e., $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^n)=0$ for all $n \\ge 1$. Thus, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$.\n*   Therefore, $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. This means $X$ is a simply connected space.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the rank of homotopy groups to the rank of homology groups**\nThe rank of a homotopy group can be determined from homology using the rational Hurewicz theorem.\n*   **Rational Hurewicz Theorem:** For a simply connected topological space $Y$, the Hurewicz map $h_k: \\pi_k(Y) \\to H_k(Y; \\mathbb{Z})$ induces an isomorphism on the rationalizations for all $k \\ge 1$:\n    $\\pi_k(Y) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong H_k(Y; \\mathbb{Q})$\n*   The rank of $\\pi_k(Y)$ is defined as $\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\pi_k(Y) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q})$.\n*   The rank of $H_k(Y; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the $k$-th Betti number $b_k(Y)$, which is defined as $\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(H_k(Y; \\mathbb{Q}))$.\n*   Since $X$ is simply connected (from Step 2), we can apply this theorem. For $k=3$, we have:\n    $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z})) = b_3(X)$.\n\nSo, the problem is reduced to finding the third Betti number of $X$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the third Betti number $b_3(X)$**\nWe can find $b_3(X)$ using Poincaré duality and the homology version of the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem.\n*   **Poincaré Duality:** $X$ is a smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, so it is a compact complex manifold. Any compact complex manifold is orientable. The real dimension of $X$ is 4. For any compact, orientable, $m$-dimensional manifold $M$, Poincaré duality implies $b_k(M) = b_{m-k}(M)$.\n    For $X$, with $m=4$, we have $b_3(X) = b_{4-3}(X) = b_1(X)$.\n\n*   **Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem (Homology Version):** This theorem states that for a smooth hyperplane section $X$ of a complex projective manifold $Y$ of dimension $n$, the inclusion map induces isomorphisms $H_k(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_k(Y; \\mathbb{Z})$ for $k < n-1$.\n    Again, with $Y=\\mathbb{CP}^3$ and $n=3$, this holds for $k < 2$.\n    For $k=1$, we have an isomorphism: $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n*   **Homology of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$:** The first homology group is the abelianization of the fundamental group, $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)_{\\text{ab}}$. Since $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$, its abelianization is also the trivial group. So, $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z})=0$.\n\n*   **Conclusion for $b_3(X)$:**\n    1.  $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n    2.  This means the first Betti number is $b_1(X) = \\text{rank}(H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})) = 0$.\n    3.  By Poincaré duality, $b_3(X) = b_1(X) = 0$.\n\n**Step 5: Final conclusion**\nFrom Step 3, we established that $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = b_3(X)$.\nFrom Step 4, we computed that $b_3(X) = 0$.\nTherefore, the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 0. This means that $\\pi_3(X)$ is a purely torsion group.\n\nFinal check of the logical flow:\n1.  Lefschetz on homotopy $\\implies \\pi_1(X)=0$ (X is simply connected).\n2.  Rational Hurewicz Thm $\\implies \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = b_3(X)$.\n3.  Poincaré Duality $\\implies b_3(X) = b_1(X)$.\n4.  Lefschetz on homology $\\implies b_1(X) = b_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$.\n5.  Standard topology $\\implies b_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$.\n6.  Putting it all together: $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = b_3(X) = b_1(X) = b_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$.\n\nThe argument is sound.\n\n<<<0>>>"
