    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The problem asks for the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$. These are the steady-state probabilities of a system described by the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations, which is a continuous-time Markov chain. Let's denote the steady-state probabilities as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. In the steady state, the probabilities no longer change over time, meaning their time derivatives are zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Steady-State Equations:** We set the derivatives in the given system of differential equations to zero. This transforms the system of ODEs into a system of linear algebraic equations:\n    *   Equation (1): $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1$\n    *   Equation (2): $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_1 + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_2 + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n    *   Equation (3): $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_1 - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_2$\n    *   Equation (4): $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_2 - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n\n3.  **Include the Normalization Condition:** For probabilities, the sum over all states must be 1. This gives us another equation:\n    *   Equation (5): $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n\n4.  **Careful Points & Simplifications:**\n    *   **Redundancy:** The system of equations (1)-(4) is linearly dependent. Summing them up yields $0=0$. This means one of the equations is redundant and can be ignored. We will use equations (1), (3), (4) along with the normalization equation (5) to solve for the probabilities $\\pi_i$.\n    *   **Ergodicity:** For a unique steady-state distribution to exist, the Markov chain must be ergodic (the graph of states is strongly connected). The transitions are $0 \\leftrightarrow 1$, $1 \\leftrightarrow 2$, $2 \\to 3$, and $3 \\to 1$. Any state can be reached from any other state, so a unique steady-state solution exists.\n    *   **Parameter Values:** It's important to carefully substitute the given values:\n        $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$, $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$, $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$, $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$, $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$.\n        Notice that some values are chosen to simplify calculations:\n        *   In Equation (3), we have the term $\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23} = 0.392 + 0.008 = 0.4$, which is equal to $\\lambda_{12}$.\n        *   In Equation (4), we have $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$ and $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$, which are equal.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Solve the system of linear equations:** We will express $\\pi_0$, $\\pi_2$, and $\\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$.\n\n    *   From Equation (1):\n        $\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 = \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1 \\implies 0.019 \\pi_0 = 0.65 \\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1$\n\n    *   From Equation (3) and the parameter values:\n        $\\lambda_{12}\\pi_1 = (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_2 \\implies 0.4 \\pi_1 = (0.392 + 0.008) \\pi_2 \\implies 0.4 \\pi_1 = 0.4 \\pi_2 \\implies \\pi_1 = \\pi_2$\n\n    *   From Equation (4) and the parameter values:\n        $\\lambda_{23}\\pi_2 = \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3 \\implies 0.008 \\pi_2 = 0.008 \\pi_3 \\implies \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$\n\n    *   Combining these results, we get:\n        $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$\n\n2.  **Use the normalization equation to find $\\pi_1$:**\n    Substitute the expressions for $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ into Equation (5):\n    $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n    $(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1) + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1$\n    $(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3) \\pi_1 = 1$\n\n    Now, we solve for $\\pi_1$:\n    $\\pi_1 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}} = \\frac{0.019}{0.65 + 0.057} = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n3.  **Calculate $\\pi_0$:**\n    Now that we have an expression for $\\pi_1$, we can find $\\pi_0$:\n    $\\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the final desired quantity, $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$:**\n    $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\n5.  **Compute the numerical value:**\n    $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to a reasonable number of decimal places, we get 0.946252."
