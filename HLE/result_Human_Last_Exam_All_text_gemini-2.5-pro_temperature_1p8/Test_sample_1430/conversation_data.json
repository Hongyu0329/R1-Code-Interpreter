    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the varieties and the Neron-Severi group\n*   **C:** A genus 3 Riemann surface. This is a compact complex curve of genus $g=3$.\n*   **X = C^(15):** The 15th symmetric power of C. This is the space of effective divisors of degree 15 on C. It is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   **Neron-Severi group NS(X):** This is the group of divisors on X modulo algebraic equivalence. For a smooth complex projective variety, it is a finitely generated abelian group.\n*   **Rank of the Neron-Severi group $\\rho(X)$:** This is the rank of the group $NS(X)$, also known as the Picard number of X. It is the dimension of the vector space $NS(X) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$. By the Lefschetz theorem on (1,1)-classes, $\\rho(X)$ is the dimension of the space of rational (1,1)-classes in the second cohomology group of X: $\\rho(X) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}} (H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cap H^{1,1}(X, \\mathbb{C}))$.\n\n### Step 2: Relating the Neron-Severi group of X to the Jacobian of C\nThe key to solving this problem is to relate the Neron-Severi group of the symmetric power $X = C^{(d)}$ to the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of the curve C, denoted $J(C)$.\n\n1.  **Cohomology of the Symmetric Power:** The second cohomology group of the symmetric power $C^{(d)}$ is described by a formula of MacDonald. For any $d \\ge 1$:\n    $H^2(C^{(d)}, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^2(C, \\mathbb{Q}) \\oplus \\Lambda^2 H^1(C, \\mathbb{Q})$.\n    *   $H^2(C, \\mathbb{Q})$ is 1-dimensional, generated by the fundamental class of the curve C. This corresponds to an algebraic cycle class in $H^2(C^{(d)}, \\mathbb{Q})$ (for instance, the class of the divisor formed by fixing one point and letting the other $d-1$ points vary).\n    *   $H^1(C, \\mathbb{Q})$ is the first cohomology group of C, which is a $2g$-dimensional vector space. In our case, $g=3$, so it has dimension 6.\n\n2.  **Connection to the Jacobian:** The Jacobian of C, $J(C)$, is a complex torus of dimension $g=3$ defined as $J(C) = H^0(C, \\Omega^1)^*/H_1(C, \\mathbb{Z})$. It is a principally polarized abelian variety. There is an isomorphism of cohomology groups $H^1(C, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^1(J(C), \\mathbb{Q})$. Therefore, we can write:\n    $\\Lambda^2 H^1(C, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\Lambda^2 H^1(J(C), \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{Q})$.\n    So, $H^2(C^{(d)}, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^2(C, \\mathbb{Q}) \\oplus H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\n3.  **The Picard Number Formula:** An algebraic class in $H^2(C^{(d)}, \\mathbb{Q})$ is a sum of an algebraic class from the $H^2(C, \\mathbb{Q})$ component and an algebraic class from the $H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{Q})$ component.\n    *   The 1-dimensional space $H^2(C, \\mathbb{Q})$ is always represented by an algebraic class.\n    *   A class in $H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{Q})$ is algebraic if and only if its image in $H^2(C^{(d)}, \\mathbb{Q})$ is algebraic. The space of these classes has dimension $\\rho(J(C))$.\n    This leads to the fundamental relation for the Picard number (valid for $d \\ge 1$):\n    $\\rho(C^{(d)}) = 1 + \\rho(J(C))$.\n    In our case, $X=C^{(15)}$, so we need to find the range of possible values for $\\rho(X) = 1 + \\rho(J(C))$.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the possible range of the Picard number of the Jacobian\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values of $\\rho(J(C))$ for a genus 3 curve C.\n\n*   **Bounds on $\\rho(J(C))$:** For any abelian variety A of dimension g, its Picard number is bounded by $1 \\le \\rho(A) \\le h^{1,1}(A)$, where $h^{1,1}(A)$ is the Hodge number $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} H^{1,1}(A, \\mathbb{C})$. For the Jacobian $J(C)$ of a genus g curve, $h^{1,1}(J(C)) = g^2$.\n*   For our case with $g=3$, we have $h^{1,1}(J(C)) = 3^2 = 9$. Thus, we have the bounds:\n    $1 \\le \\rho(J(C)) \\le 9$.\n\n### Step 4: Determining the smallest possible rank\nThe smallest possible rank for $\\rho(J(C))$ is achieved for a \"very general\" curve C.\n*   The moduli space of genus 3 curves, $M_3$, has dimension $3g-3 = 6$.\n*   For a curve C in a dense Zariski open subset of $M_3$, its Jacobian $J(C)$ is simple and has the smallest possible endomorphism ring, $End(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   For such an abelian variety, the Neron-Severi group is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor). Thus, its rank is 1.\n*   So, the minimum possible value is $\\rho(J(C))_{\\min} = 1$.\n*   Therefore, the smallest possible rank for $NS(X)$ is:\n    $\\rho(X)_{\\min} = 1 + \\rho(J(C))_{\\min} = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n### Step 5: Determining the largest possible rank\nThe largest possible rank for $\\rho(J(C))$ is bounded by $h^{1,1}(J(C))=9$. We need to show that this bound can be achieved.\n*   The equality $\\rho(J(C)) = h^{1,1}(J(C))$ holds if $J(C)$ is an abelian variety of \"CM-type\" (with sufficiently large complex multiplication), for which every Hodge (1,1)-class is algebraic.\n*   We need to ascertain whether a genus 3 curve C exists whose Jacobian $J(C)$ has a Neron-Severi rank of 9.\n*   Such a Jacobian can be constructed if it is isogenous to a product of three elliptic curves, each with complex multiplication (CM). Let E be an elliptic curve with CM (e.g., $y^2 = x^3 - x$, with CM by $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$). Then the Neron-Severi rank of the product abelian variety $A = E \\times E \\times E$ is $\\rho(A) = g^2 = 3^2 = 9$.\n*   The existence of a genus 3 curve C whose Jacobian is isogenous to such a product $A$ is well-known. A prominent example is the Fermat curve of degree 4, given by the affine equation $x^4 + y^4 = 1$. This is a genus 3 curve, and its Jacobian is isogenous to the product of three copies of the CM elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - x$.\n*   Since isogeny preserves the rank of the Neron-Severi group, the Jacobian of the Fermat curve has $\\rho(J(C)) = 9$.\n*   So, the maximum possible value is $\\rho(J(C))_{\\max} = 9$.\n*   Therefore, the largest possible rank for $NS(X)$ is:\n    $\\rho(X)_{\\max} = 1 + \\rho(J(C))_{\\max} = 1 + 9 = 10$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$ is given by $\\rho(X) = 1 + \\rho(J(C))$.\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve C can range from $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$ (for a generic curve) to $\\rho(J(C)) = 9$ (for a curve with maximal complex multiplication).\n*   **Smallest rank:** $\\rho(X)_{\\min} = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n*   **Largest rank:** $\\rho(X)_{\\max} = 1 + 9 = 10$.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
