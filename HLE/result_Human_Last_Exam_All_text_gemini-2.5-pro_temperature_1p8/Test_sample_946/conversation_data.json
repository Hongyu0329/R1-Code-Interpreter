    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core components of the question are:\n    *   **Source:** The online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n    *   **Specific Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n    *   **Event:** The Junior prom.\n    *   **Object:** A cardboard cutout.\n    *   **Identity:** A fictional singer.\n\n2.  **Locate the Scene:** The question directs us to the Junior Prom scene within \"Teen Girl Squad #15\". In the episode, the girls (Cheerleader, So Totally, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) arrive at the prom, which is called the \"Dancin' Dancery\".\n\n3.  **Analyze the Dialogue and Visuals:**\n    *   Upon arriving, Cheerleader asks who the musical guest is.\n    *   So Totally spots the \"performer\" on stage and exclaims, \"ooh! it's that guy from that band i like! arrowed!\"\n    *   What's Her Face then confirms, \"no way! i can't believe they got a cardboard cutout of arrowed!\"\n    *   Visually, the stage features a cardboard cutout of a rock singer-type character. The character is known for being impaled by various objects, hence the name.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:** The dialogue from two of the main characters, So Totally and What's Her Face, explicitly identifies the cardboard cutout as being of the fictional singer named \"Arrowed\".\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The performer is not a live band:** It is crucial to note that the question specifies a *cardboard cutout*, which the episode clearly depicts.\n*   **The name is explicitly stated:** The name \"Arrowed\" is not just implied; it is spoken aloud by the characters.\n*   **Fictional within a fictional universe:** Arrowed is a fictional singer within the fictional world of Homestar Runner, just as the Teen Girl Squad itself is a cartoon drawn by the character Strong Bad.\n*   **Episode specificity:** The events of Teen Girl Squad #15 are unique to that episode. This specific singer is the musical act for this particular prom.\n\nBased on this analysis, the name of the fictional singer is clearly identified.\n\n<<<Arrowed>>>"
