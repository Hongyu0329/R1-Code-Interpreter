    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the integral of the given function.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe need to compute the definite integral of a piecewise function `p(x)` over the interval `[0, 4]`. The function is defined as:\n*   `p(x) = (2x^3) / 8` for `0 ≤ x ≤ 3`\n*   `p(x) = (e^x * (1 + sin x)) / (1 + cos x)` for `3 ≤ x ≤ 5`\n\n**2. Split the Integral**\n\nThe definition of the function `p(x)` changes at `x = 3`. Since the integration interval `[0, 4]` contains this point, we must split the integral into two parts:\n`∫[0, 4] p(x) dx = ∫[0, 3] p(x) dx + ∫[3, 4] p(x) dx`\n\n**3. Evaluate the First Part of the Integral**\n\nLet `I_1 = ∫[0, 3] p(x) dx`. In the interval `[0, 3]`, the function is `p(x) = (2x^3) / 8 = x^3 / 4`.\n\n*   **Find the antiderivative:**\n    `∫ (x^3 / 4) dx = (1/4) ∫ x^3 dx = (1/4) * (x^4 / 4) = x^4 / 16`\n*   **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:**\n    `I_1 = [x^4 / 16]_0^3 = (3^4 / 16) - (0^4 / 16) = 81 / 16`\n*   **Result for the first part:**\n    `I_1 = 81 / 16 = 5.0625`\n\n**4. Evaluate the Second Part of the Integral**\n\nLet `I_2 = ∫[3, 4] p(x) dx`. In the interval `[3, 4]`, the function is `p(x) = (e^x * (1 + sin x)) / (1 + cos x)`.\n\n*   **Simplify the integrand:** This expression looks complex, but we can simplify the trigonometric part `(1 + sin x) / (1 + cos x)` using half-angle identities.\n    *   **Careful point:** We use the identities `1 + cos x = 2cos^2(x/2)` and `1 + sin x = 1 + 2sin(x/2)cos(x/2)`. To make the numerator match a common form, we also use `1 = sin^2(x/2) + cos^2(x/2)`.\n    *   Numerator: `1 + sin x = (sin^2(x/2) + cos^2(x/2)) + 2sin(x/2)cos(x/2) = (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))^2`\n    *   Denominator: `1 + cos x = 2cos^2(x/2)`\n    *   The fraction becomes: `[(sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))^2] / [2cos^2(x/2)]`\n    *   `= (1/2) * [(sin(x/2) + cos(x/2)) / cos(x/2)]^2`\n    *   `= (1/2) * [tan(x/2) + 1]^2`\n    *   `= (1/2) * (tan^2(x/2) + 2tan(x/2) + 1)`\n    *   Using the identity `tan^2(θ) + 1 = sec^2(θ)`, we get: `(1/2) * (sec^2(x/2) + 2tan(x/2))`\n*   **Rewrite the integrand for `I_2`:**\n    `p(x) = e^x * [(1/2)sec^2(x/2) + tan(x/2)]`\n*   **Find the antiderivative:**\n    *   **Careful point:** This integrand is in the special form `e^x(f'(x) + f(x))`, where the integral is `e^x * f(x)`.\n    *   Let `f(x) = tan(x/2)`.\n    *   Then, using the chain rule, the derivative is `f'(x) = sec^2(x/2) * (1/2) = (1/2)sec^2(x/2)`.\n    *   Our integrand perfectly matches the form `e^x(f(x) + f'(x))`.\n    *   Therefore, the antiderivative is `∫ e^x[(1/2)sec^2(x/2) + tan(x/2)] dx = e^x * tan(x/2)`.\n*   **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:**\n    `I_2 = [e^x * tan(x/2)]_3^4 = (e^4 * tan(4/2)) - (e^3 * tan(3/2))`\n    `I_2 = e^4 * tan(2) - e^3 * tan(1.5)`\n*   **Calculate the numerical value:**\n    *   **Careful point:** Make sure your calculator is in **radian mode**.\n    *   `e^4 ≈ 54.5982`\n    *   `e^3 ≈ 20.0855`\n    *   `tan(2) ≈ -2.1850`\n    *   `tan(1.5) ≈ 14.1014`\n    *   `I_2 ≈ (54.5982 * -2.1850) - (20.0855 * 14.1014)`\n    *   `I_2 ≈ -119.2970 - 283.2307 = -402.5277`\n\n**5. Combine the Results**\n\nNow, we add the results of the two parts to get the final answer.\n`Total Integral = I_1 + I_2`\n`Total Integral ≈ 5.0625 + (-402.5277)`\n`Total Integral ≈ -397.4652`\n\nThe exact answer is `81/16 + e^4 * tan(2) - e^3 * tan(1.5)`.\n\n<<<-397.4652>>>"
