    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the initial position and orientation of the cubes.**\nLet's place the first cube, which we'll call Cube A, in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. For simplicity, we can align its edges with the axes and place one of its vertices at the origin (0, 0, 0). Since the side length is 1, Cube A occupies the space defined by the following inequalities:\n*   0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\nThis cube has a volume of 1³ = 1. The second cube, Cube B, is identical in size and orientation.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the shift.**\nThe problem states that one cube is shifted \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" relative to the other.\n*   **Identify the main diagonal:** The main diagonal of Cube A connects opposite vertices. The longest diagonal connects the origin (0, 0, 0) to the vertex (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n*   **Determine the shift vector:** A shift \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" means that the displacement vector is half of the main diagonal vector. We can parameterize the path along the diagonal from the origin to (1, 1, 1) by a parameter `t` from 0 to 1. A shift \"by 1/2\" corresponds to t=1/2. Therefore, the shift vector **s** is:\n    **s** = (1/2) * **d** = (1/2) * (1, 1, 1) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This is the most standard and logical interpretation. An alternative, like a shift of Euclidean distance 1/2 in the direction of the diagonal, would result in a more complex shift vector and is unlikely to be the intended meaning for such a problem. The fact that different logical interpretations (e.g., a shift for half the diagonal's length) lead to the same shift vector, **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), further solidifies this choice.\n\n**Step 3: Define the position of the shifted cube.**\nCube B is the result of shifting Cube A by the vector **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). To find the coordinates of Cube B, we add the shift vector to the coordinates of Cube A.\nA point (x, y, z) is in Cube B if it satisfies:\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n\n**Step 4: Find the volume of the intersection.**\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that belongs to both Cube A and Cube B. To find this region, we need to find the points (x, y, z) that satisfy the inequalities for both cubes simultaneously. We do this by finding the overlap for each coordinate.\n\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** The point must be in the interval [0, 1] (from Cube A) AND in the interval [1/2, 3/2] (from Cube B). The intersection of these two intervals is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)] = [1/2, 1].\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** Similarly, the point must be in [0, 1] AND [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection is [1/2, 1].\n*   **For the z-coordinate:** Again, the point must be in [0, 1] AND [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection is [1/2, 1].\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final volume.**\nThe intersection region is defined by:\n*   1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\nThis is the definition of a cube. Let's find its side length:\n*   Side length = (upper bound) - (lower bound) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nThe volume of this intersection cube is (side length)³.\n*   Volume = (1/2)³ = 1/8.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe volume of the intersection of the two cubes is 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
