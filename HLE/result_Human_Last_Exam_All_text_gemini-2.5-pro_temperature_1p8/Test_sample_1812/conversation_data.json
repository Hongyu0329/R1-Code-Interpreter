    "**Step-by-step Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The question asks for the computation of the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix, `A`.\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & -1 & 2\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    The context \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" provides background information but the mathematical object to be analyzed is the matrix `A` itself.\n\n2.  **List Careful Points and Choose a Method:**\n    *   **Method 1: Direct Calculation (Sarrus' Rule or Cofactor Expansion).** This is a standard method but can be prone to arithmetic errors, especially with signs.\n    *   **Method 2: Using Properties of Determinants.** This is often more elegant and less calculation-intensive if a property applies. We should check for properties like linearly dependent rows or columns.\n\n3.  **Step-by-step Analysis (Using Properties of Determinants):**\n    *   Let the columns of matrix A be C1, C2, and C3.\n        *   C1 = \\( \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\)\n        *   C2 = \\( \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\)\n        *   C3 = \\( \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\)\n    *   Let's check if there is a simple linear relationship between them. A good first check is to sum them.\n    *   Sum the columns: C1 + C2 + C3 = \\( \\begin{bmatrix} 2 + (-1) + (-1) \\\\ -1 + 2 + (-1) \\\\ -1 + (-1) + 2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\).\n    *   Since the sum of the column vectors is the zero vector, the columns are linearly dependent.\n    *   A fundamental theorem in linear algebra states that if the columns (or rows) of a square matrix are linearly dependent, its determinant is zero.\n    *   This observation is sufficient to conclude the value of the determinant.\n\n4.  **Verification (Using Cofactor Expansion):**\n    To be absolutely sure, we can quickly verify this with the standard formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\n    det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n    Where a=2, b=-1, c=-1, d=-1, e=2, f=-1, g=-1, h=-1, i=2.\n    *   det(A) = 2( (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) ) - (-1)( (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) ) + (-1)( (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) )\n    *   det(A) = 2( 4 - 1 ) + 1( -2 - 1 ) - 1( 1 - (-2) )\n    *   det(A) = 2(3) + 1(-3) - 1(3)\n    *   det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3\n    *   det(A) = 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth methods confirm that the determinant of the matrix A is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
