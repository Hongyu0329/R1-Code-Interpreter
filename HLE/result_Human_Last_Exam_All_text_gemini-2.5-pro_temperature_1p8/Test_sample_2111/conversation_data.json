    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question lies in a specific quote from Paul Morand, which was utilized by the historian Fernand Braudel. The key elements are:\n    *   **Author:** Fernand Braudel.\n    *   **Source:** A quote from Paul Morand.\n    *   **Core Idea:** A certain \"conceptual entity\" should be \"inscribed within a sphere.\" This \"sphere\" metaphor is crucial; it implies the ability to view the subject from all possible angles and perspectives.\n    *   **Example Provided:** \"The symbol of a nation\" is given as an example of this entity.\n    *   **The Goal:** Identify the general \"conceptual entity\" that a nation exemplifies.\n\n2.  **Locate the Source:** The reference is found in Fernand Braudel's work, specifically in the preface to his book, *The Identity of France* (Volume 1). Braudel's adoption of this idea fits perfectly with his advocacy for *histoire totale* or \"total history\"—a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach to historical study.\n\n3.  **Examine the Exact Quote:** Braudel writes: \"Paul Morand once wrote that **every major phenomenon**, and above all every great nation, ought to be inscribed inside a sphere so that the reader could turn it around at leisure.\"\n\n4.  **Identify the Key Components of the Quote:**\n    *   **The General Entity:** The quote explicitly states that the thing to be inscribed in a sphere is \"**every major phenomenon**\". This is the broad, conceptual category.\n    *   **The Specific Example:** The quote then provides a prime example of such a phenomenon: \"...and **above all every great nation**...\"\n\n5.  **Connect the Quote to the Question:** The user's question asks for the \"conceptual entity\" and states that it is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\"\n    *   The quote's general category, \"**every major phenomenon**,\" is the \"conceptual entity.\"\n    *   The quote's specific example, \"**every great nation**,\" matches the example given in the question.\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** The entity that should be inscribed within a sphere, according to the Morand quote used by Braudel, is \"every major phenomenon.\" A nation is simply the most significant example of such a phenomenon, worthy of this comprehensive, multi-perspectival analysis.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Attribution:** It's important to remember that while Braudel uses the quote and makes the idea his own, the original assertion comes from Paul Morand.\n*   **The Sphere Metaphor:** The sphere isn't just a container; it represents the idea of holistic, 360-degree analysis, which is central to Braudel's historical methodology (*longue durée*, global perspective).\n*   **General vs. Specific:** The question correctly distinguishes between the general entity and its specific example. The answer must be the general entity itself, not the example. The example (a nation) serves only to clarify what kind of thing the entity is.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the conceptual entity is a \"major phenomenon.\"\n\n<<<a major phenomenon>>>"
