    "Answering this competitive programming problem requires a careful focus on memory efficiency, as specified by the prompt.\n\n### Step-by-Step Question Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary task is to reorder the numbers in a given sum. The input is a string (e.g., \"3+1+2+2\") consisting of numbers and '+' signs. The output must be the same numbers, sorted in non-decreasing order, also formatted as a string (e.g., \"1+2+2+3\").\n2.  **Identify Input Properties:** The sum consists only of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. The input string is non-empty and has a maximum length of 1000 characters.\n3.  **Core Constraint:** The solution must be the \"most memory-efficient C program\". This means we should minimize the amount of memory allocated for variables. The final answer `m` is the total memory used by these variables in bytes.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Memory Optimization:** This is the most critical requirement. A naive solution might be to read the whole string into a large buffer, parse it, store the numbers in another large array, sort it, and then build an output string. This would consume kilobytes of memory. A more efficient approach is needed.\n2.  **Counting Sort:** Since the numbers are limited to a very small set {1, 2, 3, 4}, the most efficient sorting algorithm is Counting Sort. We only need to count the occurrences of each number.\n3.  **Input Handling:** To be memory-efficient, we should avoid reading the entire 1000-character string into memory if possible. We can process the input as a character stream using a function like `getchar()`.\n4.  **Data Type Selection:** Using the smallest appropriate data types for variables is crucial. For example, using a `short int` (typically 2 bytes) is better than an `int` (typically 4 bytes) if the range of values allows for it. The maximum number of terms is around 501 (for a string like \"1+1+...+1\" of length 999), so a `short int` is sufficient for counters.\n5.  **Minimizing Variables:** The program logic should be structured to use the fewest variables possible. For example, clever loop construction can eliminate the need for extra flag variables or loop counters.\n\n### Step-by-Step Path to the Final Answer\n\nBased on the points above, the most memory-efficient algorithm is as follows:\n\n1.  **Algorithm: Stream-based Counting Sort.**\n    *   Do not use a large character array to store the input string. Instead, read it character by character.\n    *   Use a small array of counters for the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   After counting, generate the output string by printing directly to standard output, which avoids allocating an output buffer.\n\n2.  **Variable and Memory Analysis:**\n    *   **Counters:** We need to count four different numbers. An array is suitable. The maximum count for any number will not exceed 501. A `short int` has a range that easily covers this.\n        *   `short counts[4];` -> Memory = `4 * sizeof(short)` = `4 * 2` = **8 bytes**.\n    *   **Input Character:** Reading character-by-character with `getchar()` requires a variable that can hold any `char` value plus the special `EOF` marker. The C standard specifies that `getchar()` returns an `int`.\n        *   `int ch;` -> Memory = `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n    *   **Loop Variable:** We need a variable to loop through our counters (from 0 to 3). A `short int` is sufficient.\n        *   `short i;` -> Memory = `sizeof(short)` = **2 bytes**.\n    *   **Output Logic:** To print the `+` symbols correctly without a special flag variable, we can first find and print the absolute first number. Then, in a subsequent loop, print all remaining numbers, each preceded by a `+`. This logic can be implemented using the single loop variable `i` and `while` loops on the counters, eliminating the need for a second, nested loop variable (`k`) or a boolean flag (`is_first`).\n\n3.  **Final Memory Calculation:**\n    The minimal set of variables required to implement this efficient algorithm is:\n    *   The `counts` array: 8 bytes\n    *   The `ch` variable for input: 4 bytes\n    *   The `i` loop index: 2 bytes\n\n    Total Memory (m) = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 bytes.\n\nThis represents the total stack memory allocated for variables within the `main` function for the most memory-conscious implementation.\n\n<<<14>>>"
