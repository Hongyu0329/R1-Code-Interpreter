The approach is not valid. The primary reason is that the ecological function of mimicry is dependent on the perception of natural predators (e.g., birds), not humans. Avian predators can see ultraviolet (UV) light, which humans cannot. Since bumblebee color patterns often include UV signals that are a key part of their warning coloration, a study based on human visual perception will miss a critical component of the mimicry signal. This can lead to incorrect clustering that does not reflect how predators actually group the species, making the method ecologically invalid.
