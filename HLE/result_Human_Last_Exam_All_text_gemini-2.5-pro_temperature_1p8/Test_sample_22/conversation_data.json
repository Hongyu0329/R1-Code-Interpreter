    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Define the key terms**\n\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a population parameter that represents the proportion of variation in a phenotype (a trait or disease) that can be explained by the additive effects of all common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. It is a theoretical maximum. It essentially asks: \"If we knew the true causal effect of every single SNP perfectly, how much of the trait's variance could we explain?\" This is typically estimated using methods like GCTA or LDSC on large population datasets, without building an explicit predictive model.\n\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** A PGS (also called a Polygenic Risk Score, PRS) is a concrete predictive tool. It is a single value calculated for an individual that summarizes their estimated genetic predisposition for a phenotype. It's constructed by summing up the number of risk alleles an individual has at many different SNPs, with each allele's contribution weighted by its estimated effect size. These effect sizes are derived from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n\n*   **Predictive Ability of a PGS (R²_PGS):** This is a measure of how well a specific PGS performs when applied to a *new, independent* group of people (a test set). It's commonly measured by the coefficient of determination (R²), which is the proportion of the variance in the phenotype that is successfully predicted by the PGS.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the terms**\n\nThe core of the question is the relationship between the theoretical maximum (SNP heritability) and the performance of a practical tool (PGS).\n\n1.  **SNP heritability is the ceiling.** By definition, h²_SNP is the upper bound on how much variance can possibly be explained by the SNPs used. It assumes perfect knowledge of the true effect sizes of all causal SNPs.\n\n2.  **PGS is a model with estimated parameters.** A PGS does not use the *true* effect sizes. It uses *estimated* effect sizes from a GWAS of a finite sample size. This estimation process is imperfect and introduces several limitations:\n    *   **Estimation Error:** Because the GWAS sample is not infinitely large, the estimated effect sizes will have some error (noise) compared to the true effect sizes. This noise reduces the accuracy of the final PGS.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** SNPs are not independent; they are often inherited together in blocks (LD). Statistical methods used to build a PGS must account for this, but these methods are not perfect. Inaccurately modeling LD reduces predictive power.\n    *   **Population Mismatch:** The GWAS used to generate the weights (the training set) and the sample the PGS is applied to (the test set) may have different genetic ancestries, allele frequencies, or LD patterns. Any mismatch will degrade the PGS's performance.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize and draw a conclusion**\n\nSince the SNP heritability (h²_SNP) represents the *total available* variance to be explained under ideal conditions (a perfect model with true effect sizes), and the PGS's predictive ability (R²_PGS) represents the variance *actually explained* by an imperfect, real-world model built on estimated effect sizes, the PGS performance will always be limited by the imperfections of its construction.\n\nTherefore, the predictive ability of the PGS must be lower than the SNP heritability. The R² of the PGS can get closer to the SNP heritability as the size of the GWAS training sample increases (reducing estimation error), as methods for handling LD improve, and as the training and test populations become better matched, but it cannot exceed this theoretical ceiling. The term \"**necessarily**\" holds true in this context because the factors limiting PGS performance are inherent to the process of building a predictive model from finite data.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Heritability vs. SNP Heritability:** Total heritability includes all genetic factors (rare variants, structural variants, gene-gene interactions), while SNP heritability only includes the contribution of common SNPs typically measured on genotyping arrays. SNP heritability is thus lower than total heritability. The question specifically refers to SNP heritability.\n*   **Theoretical vs. Estimated:** In a single experiment, due to sampling noise in the test set, it's hypothetically possible to observe an R² for a PGS that is slightly higher than a particular *estimate* of h²_SNP (which also has an error margin). However, the question is about the fundamental relationship between the true values of these quantities, not their noisy estimates in one specific study. The *true* predictive ability cannot exceed the *true* SNP heritability.\n*   **The gap is informative:** The difference between the SNP heritability and the best current PGS predictive ability highlights the room for improvement, primarily by increasing GWAS sample sizes to get more accurate effect size estimates.\n\nFinal conclusion: The statement is accurate.\n\nTrue\n<<<True>>>"
