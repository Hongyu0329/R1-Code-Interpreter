    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core of the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The key identifying detail is a very specific feeling: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This implies a character who is not only homesick but also feels a sense of guilt or weakness associated with that homesickness.\n\n**Step-2: Analyze the Characters and their Relationship with Earth**\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist. The film opens and closes with him on Earth, surrounded by nature, including the sound of rustling leaves. He is deeply connected to Earth, and his journey is defined by his memories of it. However, his primary struggle on the station is with his guilt over his deceased wife, manifested as the Visitor, Hari. While he certainly misses Earth, the specific emotion of being *ashamed* of this feeling is more articulated by another character.\n\n*   **B. Hari:** She is a \"Visitor,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memory of his dead wife. She is not a human from Earth and has no genuine memories of it. Therefore, she cannot miss something she has never experienced.\n\n*   **C. Dr. Snaut:** One of the two surviving scientists on the station when Kris arrives. He is cynical, weary, and has been in space for a long time. He acts as a philosophical guide for Kris, often delivering long monologues about humanity's purpose, the nature of Solaris, and the psychological toll of their situation. He is the character most likely to have contemplated the nuances of homesickness over a long period.\n\n*   **D. Dr. Sartorius:** The other surviving scientist. He is cold, rigid, and almost inhumanly dedicated to science. He views emotions and the \"Visitors\" as contemptible distractions from his research. It would be highly out of character for him to admit to, let alone philosophize about, a feeling as sentimental as missing rustling leaves.\n\n*   **E. Gibarian:** Kris's friend and the scientist who commits suicide just before Kris arrives. We only see him in a distressed video recording. While he is clearly tormented, his message is a frantic warning about the phenomena on the station. We don't get enough information about his character to attribute this specific sentiment to him.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Dialogue or Scene**\nThe key to answering this question lies in a specific conversation. Dr. Snaut has a pivotal discussion with Kris Kelvin about why humanity is really in space. Snaut suggests that they are not there for conquest or pure science, but are essentially looking for a mirror. In this context, he speaks about the weakness of nostalgia and the longing for Earth. He is the one who articulates the idea that the cosmonauts feel a pang of longing for simple Earthly things, but they are simultaneously ashamed of this \"pathetic\" human feeling, as it distracts from their supposed grand mission. It is Snaut who connects this shame to the very specific sensation of missing the rustling leaves.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Analysis**\nBased on the character analysis and the specific philosophical monologue in the film, Dr. Snaut is the character who expresses the complex emotion of being ashamed to miss the sounds of Earth. He encapsulates the psychological conflict between the \"heroic\" endeavor of space exploration and the simple, profound human need for home.\n\n<<<C>>>"
