    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary goal is to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$, where $m$ is the number of stable equilibrium points of the given differential equation:\n$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$\n\n**2. Finding the Equilibrium Points**\nEquilibrium points are the constant solutions to the differential equation, which occur when the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$. Let's denote the right-hand side of the equation as $f(x)$.\nSo we need to solve $f(x) = 0$:\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0$\n\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$\n\nThe quadratic term inside the parenthesis is a perfect square:\n$x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$-x(x-1)^2 = 0$\n\nThe roots of this equation are the equilibrium points:\n$x = 0$\n$x = 1$\n\n**3. Analyzing the Stability of Equilibrium Points**\nTo determine the stability of each equilibrium point, we can use the first derivative test. An equilibrium point $x_0$ is:\n-   **Stable** if $f'(x_0) < 0$.\n-   **Unstable** if $f'(x_0) > 0$.\n-   **Inconclusive** (possibly semi-stable) if $f'(x_0) = 0$.\n\nLet's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$\n$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, let's test each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For x = 0:**\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For x = 1:**\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We need to analyze the sign of $f(x)$ on either side of $x=1$.\n\n**4. Alternative Stability Analysis (Phase Line Analysis)**\nLet's analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the intervals around the equilibrium points.\n\n*   **When $x < 0$ (e.g., $x=-1$):**\n    $f(-1) = -(-1)(-1-1)^2 = 1(-2)^2 = 4 > 0$.\n    Since $x'(t) > 0$, the solution $x(t)$ increases towards 0.\n\n*   **When $0 < x < 1$ (e.g., $x=0.5$):**\n    $f(0.5) = -0.5(0.5-1)^2 = -0.5(-0.5)^2 = -0.125 < 0$.\n    Since $x'(t) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ decreases towards 0.\n    \n    *Conclusion for $x=0$:* Solutions on both sides of $x=0$ move towards $x=0$. Therefore, $x=0$ is a **stable** equilibrium point.\n\n*   **When $x > 1$ (e.g., $x=2$):**\n    $f(2) = -2(2-1)^2 = -2(1)^2 = -2 < 0$.\n    Since $x'(t) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ decreases towards 1.\n\n    *Conclusion for $x=1$:* Solutions to the right of $x=1$ move towards it, but solutions to the left of $x=1$ (in the interval $(0, 1)$) move away from it. This type of equilibrium is called **semi-stable**. Semi-stable points are not considered stable in the strict sense.\n\n**5. Determine the Value of m**\nThe question asks for the number of **stable** equilibrium points. Based on our analysis, only $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\nTherefore, $m=1$.\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\nThis is the final result.\n\n<<<1-2^4048>>>"
