The final product, Compound 1, is the S-allyl thiocarbonate formed via a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of the initially formed O-allyl thionocarbonate. Its structure is O-(p-tolyl) S-(3,7-dimethylocta-1,6-dien-3-yl) thiocarbonate, which can be represented as (CH₃)₂C=CH−CH₂−CH₂−C(CH₃)(S−C(=O)O−p-tolyl)−CH=CH₂.
