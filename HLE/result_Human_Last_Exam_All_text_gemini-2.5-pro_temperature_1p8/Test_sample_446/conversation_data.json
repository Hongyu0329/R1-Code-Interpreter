    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Motif:** The question presents five peptides. The first step is to observe any common features among them. All five peptides begin with the sequence RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid).\n2.  **Recall the Biological Significance of the RGD Motif:** The RGD sequence is a famous and well-characterized cell adhesion motif. It is the principal recognition site for a large family of cell surface receptors known as integrins. Integrins bind to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that contain the RGD sequence, such as fibronectin, vitronectin, and fibrinogen. This binding is fundamental to processes like cell adhesion, migration, and signaling.\n3.  **Understand the Role of Flanking Residues:** While the RGD sequence itself is essential for binding, the amino acids surrounding this tripeptide core (the \"flanking residues\") play a crucial role. They influence the conformation of the RGD loop and contribute significantly to the binding affinity and specificity for different types of integrin receptors (e.g., α5β1 vs. αvβ3). The question implicitly asks which of the given RGD-containing peptides has the most effective or biologically relevant flanking sequence.\n4.  **Evaluate Each Option by Comparing to Known Natural Ligands:** The most effective way to answer this is to compare the given peptide sequences to the RGD sequences found in major natural integrin ligands.\n    *   **Fibronectin:** This is arguably the most-studied integrin-binding ECM protein. Its primary cell attachment site contains the sequence `GRGDSPK`. A very common and potent peptide used in cell biology research to study integrin binding is derived from this sequence, often simply **RGDSP**.\n    *   **Vitronectin:** Contains the sequence `RGDV`.\n    *   **Fibrinogen:** Contains `RGDF` and `RGDS` sequences.\n    *   **Laminin:** Contains `RGDN`.\n5.  **Analyze the Specific Peptides Provided:**\n    *   A. RGDMAA: The flanking sequence `MAA` is not a characteristic sequence from a major natural integrin ligand.\n    *   B. **RGDSPSS**: This peptide contains the sequence **RGDSP**, which is the canonical binding motif from fibronectin. This sequence is known to be a potent ligand for integrins, particularly α5β1. Therefore, a peptide containing this sequence has definitively been found to bind and is highly likely to bind an integrin receptor in an assay.\n    *   C. RGDLTTP: The flanking sequence `LTTP` is not a characteristic sequence from a major natural integrin ligand.\n    *   D. RGDQVSK: The flanking sequence `QVSK` is not a characteristic sequence from a major natural integrin ligand.\n    *   E. RGDARGG: The flanking sequence `ARGG` is not a characteristic sequence from a major natural integrin ligand.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe peptide in option B, RGDSPSS, contains the `RGDSP` sequence. This sequence is derived directly from the cell-binding domain of fibronectin, one of the most important natural ligands for integrins. Peptides containing the RGDSP motif are extensively documented in scientific literature as effective binders of integrin receptors and are commonly used as research tools for this purpose. The other options feature flanking sequences that are not characteristic of major natural integrin ligands, making them much less likely to be potent or specific binders. Therefore, RGDSPSS is the peptide that has been found to bind, and is most likely to bind, an integrin receptor.\n\n<<<B>>>"
