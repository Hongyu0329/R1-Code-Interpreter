    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Theoretical Framework**\nThe problem asks for the specific heat scaling exponent α using the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion in the context of Renormalization Group (RG) theory. The specific heat ($C$) near the critical temperature ($T_c$) is described by the power law $C \\sim |T-T_c|^{-\\alpha}$.\n\n**2. Define the Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) Expansion**\nThe $\\epsilon$-expansion is a perturbative technique used to calculate critical exponents. It performs an expansion in the small parameter $\\epsilon = d_c - d$, where:\n*   $d$ is the spatial dimension of the system.\n*   $d_c$ is the upper critical dimension, which is the dimension above which mean-field theory exponents are exact. For a wide range of systems (including those in the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg universality classes, described by the O(n) model), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$.\n\nGiven the system has a spatial dimension $d=3$, the parameter $\\epsilon$ is:\n$\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\n**3. Utilize Hyperscaling Relations**\nRG theory establishes relationships between different critical exponents, known as hyperscaling relations. The Josephson relation connects the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$, the correlation length exponent $\\nu$, and the spatial dimension $d$:\n$2 - \\alpha = d\\nu$\n\nThis relation is valid for $d < d_c$. We can rearrange it to find $\\alpha$:\n$\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$\n\n**4. Find the Expression for the Exponent $\\nu$**\nTo find $\\alpha$, we first need the $\\epsilon$-expansion for the exponent $\\nu$. For an O(n) model (which describes systems with an n-component order parameter), the one-loop RG calculation gives the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ as:\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**5. Derive the Expression for the Exponent $\\alpha$**\nNow we substitute the expression for $\\nu$ and $d = 4-\\epsilon$ into the hyperscaling relation $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$. We work to the first order in $\\epsilon$:\n$\\alpha = 2 - (4-\\epsilon) \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right)$\n\nExpand the product, keeping terms up to order $\\epsilon^1$:\n$\\alpha \\approx 2 - \\left[ 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 4 \\cdot \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon - \\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\right]$\n$\\alpha \\approx 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\left( \\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\epsilon \\right]$\n$\\alpha \\approx - \\left( \\frac{2(n+2) - (n+8)}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon$\n$\\alpha \\approx - \\left( \\frac{2n + 4 - n - 8}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon$\n$\\alpha \\approx - \\left( \\frac{n-4}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon$\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon$\n\n**6. Apply the Specific System Parameters**\nThe question describes \"a system\" without specifying the number of components of the order parameter, 'n'. In this common scenario, the default assumption is the simplest and most frequently studied case: the Ising universality class, where the order parameter is a scalar.\n*   For the Ising model, $n=1$.\n\nSubstitute $n=1$ into the expression for $\\alpha$:\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)}\\epsilon = \\frac{3}{18}\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{6}\\epsilon$\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Value**\nFinally, we use the value $\\epsilon = 1$ (since $d=3$):\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Universality Class:** The result for $\\alpha$ depends on the number of components 'n' of the order parameter. We assumed the Ising model ($n=1$), as is standard when no other information is provided.\n*   **Validity of $\\epsilon=1$:** The $\\epsilon$-expansion is formally a Taylor series in a small parameter $\\epsilon$. Setting $\\epsilon=1$ is a significant extrapolation. However, it is a standard calculation in statistical physics, and for many exponents, the results are surprisingly close to more precise values obtained from other methods (e.g., numerical simulations or higher-order expansions).\n*   **Order of Expansion:** This calculation is performed to the first order in $\\epsilon$. Higher-order calculations ($O(\\epsilon^2)$, etc.) exist and provide more accurate results, but are significantly more complex. The first-order calculation is a cornerstone result of RG theory.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis leads to the first-order approximation for the specific heat exponent.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
