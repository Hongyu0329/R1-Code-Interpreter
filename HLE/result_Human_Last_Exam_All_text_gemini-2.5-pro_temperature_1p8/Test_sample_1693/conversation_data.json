    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstructing the Question**\nTo answer the question accurately, we must identify and adhere to four key criteria:\n1.  **Nationality:** The ship must be French.\n2.  **Cause of Loss:** It must have been sunk by a German U-boat.\n3.  **Timeframe:** The sinking must have occurred before the Franco-German armistice, which was signed on June 22, 1940. This means the relevant period is from September 3, 1939, to June 21, 1940.\n4.  **Size Metric:** The ship must be the \"largest\" as measured by displacement tonnage, which is the actual weight of the ship.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing Potential Candidates (Warships vs. Merchant Ships)**\nFirst, we consider major warships of the French Navy (Marine Nationale). During this period, the French Navy's capital ships (battleships and heavy cruisers) did not suffer any losses to U-boats. While several French destroyers were sunk during the Battle of France in May-June 1940, their losses were attributed to mines, aircraft, or German surface craft (E-boats), not U-boats. Therefore, the ship in question must be a merchant vessel.\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying Large French Merchant Ships Sunk in the Period**\nNext, we review the records of French merchant marine losses to U-boats between September 1939 and June 21, 1940. We can create a shortlist of the largest vessels sunk, initially using Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), a common measure of a ship's internal volume, as a preliminary filter.\n\nThe most significant French merchant ships sunk by U-boats in this timeframe include:\n*   **SS *Flandre***: Passenger liner, 8,118 GRT, sunk by *U-47* on October 13, 1939.\n*   **SS *Bretagne***: Passenger liner, 10,123 GRT, sunk by *U-45* on October 14, 1939.\n*   **SS *Champollion***: Passenger liner, 12,546 GRT, sunk by *U-45* on October 1, 1939.\n*   **SS *Sheherazade***: Oil tanker, 13,467 GRT, sunk by *U-48* on March 10, 1940.\n\nBased on GRT, the largest of these is the oil tanker *Sheherazade*.\n\n### **Step 4: Comparing Candidates by Displacement**\nThe crucial part of the question is the metric of \"displacement.\" Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) measures volume, while displacement measures weight. For different types of ships, the relationship between GRT and displacement varies significantly.\n\n*   **SS *Champollion***: As a passenger liner, its structure was relatively light for its large volume. Historical records place its displacement at approximately **17,680 tons**.\n*   **SS *Sheherazade***: As a modern oil tanker, it was designed to carry a massive weight of cargo (oil). Its size is better understood by its deadweight tonnage (DWT), which was over 17,500 tons. The ship's fully loaded displacement is the sum of its own weight (lightship tonnage) and its cargo capacity (DWT). Historical naval sources note the *Sheherazade* had a full load displacement of approximately **24,000 tons**.\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\nComparing the displacement figures, the oil tanker *SS Sheherazade* at ~24,000 tons was significantly larger by weight than the passenger liner *SS Champollion* at ~17,680 tons. The *Sheherazade* meets all the criteria: it was French, sunk by a U-boat (*U-48*) on a date before the armistice (March 10, 1940), and it had the largest displacement of any French ship lost under these circumstances.\n\n***\n\nThe largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the oil tanker **SS Sheherazade**.\n\n<<<SS Sheherazade>>>"
