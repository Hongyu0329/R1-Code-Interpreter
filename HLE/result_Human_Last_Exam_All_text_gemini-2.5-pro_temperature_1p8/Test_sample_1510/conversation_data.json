    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the core concepts:**\n    *   **Wallpaper groups:** These are the 17 possible two-dimensional repeating patterns of symmetry, also known as the plane crystallographic groups.\n    *   **Point group:** For each wallpaper group, there is an associated point group. This is the group of symmetries (rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point fixed. It is derived by considering the rotational and reflectional parts of the wallpaper group's symmetries while ignoring the translational components.\n    *   **Order of a group:** The number of distinct symmetry operations (elements) in the group.\n    *   **The question:** We need to find the number of wallpaper groups whose associated point group has exactly two elements (order 2).\n\n2.  **Identify the possible point groups of order 2:**\n    The symmetries in a 2D crystallographic point group are restricted to rotations of order 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, and reflections. The point groups are denoted by $C_n$ (cyclic groups with n-fold rotation) and $D_n$ (dihedral groups with n-fold rotation and reflections).\n    *   The order of the point group $C_n$ is $n$.\n    *   The order of the point group $D_n$ is $2n$.\n    We need to find the groups with order 2.\n    *   For $C_n$: If $n=2$, the order of $C_2$ is 2. This group consists of the identity and a 180Â° rotation.\n    *   For $D_n$: If $2n=2$, then $n=1$. The order of $D_1$ is 2. This group consists of the identity and a single reflection. In crystallographic notation, this point group is often denoted as 'm'.\n\n    Therefore, we are looking for wallpaper groups whose point group is either $C_2$ (also denoted '2') or $D_1$ (also denoted 'm').\n\n3.  **List the 17 wallpaper groups and identify their point groups:**\n    We will now go through the 17 wallpaper groups and determine the order of their respective point groups.\n\n    *   **Groups with point group $C_1$ (order 1):**\n        *   `p1`\n    *   **Groups with point group $C_2$ (order 2):**\n        *   `p2`\n    *   **Groups with point group $D_1$ ('m') (order 2):**\n        *   `pm` (contains reflection lines)\n        *   `pg` (contains glide reflection lines)\n        *   `cm` (centered cell, contains reflection lines)\n    *   **Groups with point group $C_3$ (order 3):**\n        *   `p3`\n    *   **Groups with point group $D_2$ ('2mm') (order 4):**\n        *   `p2mm` (or `pmm`)\n        *   `p2mg` (or `pmg`)\n        *   `p2gg` (or `pgg`)\n        *   `c2mm` (or `cmm`)\n    *   **Groups with point group $C_4$ (order 4):**\n        *   `p4`\n    *   **Groups with point group $D_3$ ('3m') (order 6):**\n        *   `p3m1`\n        *   `p31m`\n    *   **Groups with point group $C_6$ (order 6):**\n        *   `p6`\n    *   **Groups with point group $D_4$ ('4mm') (order 8):**\n        *   `p4mm` (or `p4m`)\n        *   `p4gm` (or `p4g`)\n    *   **Groups with point group $D_6$ ('6mm') (order 12):**\n        *   `p6mm` (or `p6m`)\n\n4.  **Count the relevant groups:**\n    Based on the list above, we count the number of wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2. These are the groups with point groups $C_2$ and $D_1$.\n\n    *   Groups with point group $C_2$ (order 2): **`p2`** (1 group)\n    *   Groups with point group $D_1$ (order 2): **`pm`**, **`pg`**, **`cm`** (3 groups)\n\n    The total number of such groups is $1 + 3 = 4$.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 are p2, pm, pg, and cm.\n\n<<<4>>>"
