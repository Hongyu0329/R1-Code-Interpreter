No. Free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the material to have a non-zero second-order susceptibility (`χ^(2)`). A material can only possess a non-zero `χ^(2)` if its crystal structure lacks a center of inversion (i.e., is non-centrosymmetric). The stable, common phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases) are centrosymmetric. Due to this inversion symmetry, their bulk `χ^(2)` is necessarily zero, thus forbidding the SPDC process.
