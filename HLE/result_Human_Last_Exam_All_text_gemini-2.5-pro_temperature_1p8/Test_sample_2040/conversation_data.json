    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Material:** \"free-standing boron nanosheets\" (also known as borophene). This specifies the material under investigation. \"Free-standing\" implies there is no substrate, which simplifies the analysis by removing potential substrate-induced effects.\n    *   **Excitation:** \"excited by incident light.\" This is the trigger for the optical process.\n    *   **Phenomenon:** \"spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC).\" This is the specific physical process we need to evaluate.\n\n2.  **Understand Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC):**\n    *   SPDC is a quantum optical process where a single high-energy photon (the \"pump\") interacts with a nonlinear optical material and spontaneously splits into a pair of lower-energy photons (the \"signal\" and \"idler\").\n    *   This process is governed by the laws of conservation of energy (`ω_pump = ω_signal + ω_idler`) and conservation of momentum (`k_pump = k_signal + k_idler`).\n    *   Crucially, SPDC is a **second-order nonlinear optical process**. The strength of this process in a material is determined by its second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, denoted as `χ^(2)` (chi-two).\n\n3.  **Identify the Core Requirement for SPDC:**\n    *   For any second-order nonlinear process, including SPDC, to occur, the material must possess a **non-zero `χ^(2)` susceptibility**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the `χ^(2)` Susceptibility and its Relation to Crystal Symmetry:**\n    *   `χ^(2)` is a third-rank tensor that describes how a material polarizes in response to the square of an applied electric field.\n    *   A fundamental rule of crystal physics dictates that for a material to have a non-zero `χ^(2)` tensor, its crystal structure must **lack a center of inversion**. Such materials are called **non-centrosymmetric**.\n    *   In a material that has a center of inversion (i.e., it is **centrosymmetric**), the `χ^(2)` tensor is identically zero. This is because inverting the coordinates through a center of symmetry must leave the crystal unchanged, but this operation would flip the sign of the electric field and the resulting polarization, leading to a mathematical contradiction unless `χ^(2)` is zero.\n    *   Therefore, the central question becomes: Is the crystal structure of free-standing boron nanosheets centrosymmetric or non-centrosymmetric?\n\n5.  **Examine the Crystal Structure and Symmetry of Boron Nanosheets:**\n    *   Boron nanosheets (borophene) are 2D allotropes of boron. Several different atomic arrangements (polymorphs) have been predicted and synthesized.\n    *   The most stable and commonly studied phases of free-standing borophene are the β₁₂ sheet and the χ₃ sheet.\n    *   The β₁₂ borophene sheet belongs to the *Pmmm* space group. This space group includes a center of inversion. Therefore, β₁₂ borophene is **centrosymmetric**.\n    *   The χ₃ borophene sheet belongs to the *Pmmn* space group. This space group also includes a center of inversion. Therefore, χ₃ borophene is also **centrosymmetric**.\n    *   Other known stable phases also generally possess inversion symmetry.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Findings and Reach a Conclusion:**\n    *   SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process requiring a non-zero `χ^(2)`.\n    *   A non-zero `χ^(2)` is only possible in non-centrosymmetric materials.\n    *   The common, stable structures of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n    *   Because they are centrosymmetric, their bulk `χ^(2)` susceptibility is zero by symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to support SPDC.\n\n### Careful Points and Nuances\n\n*   **Ideal vs. Real Systems:** The conclusion is based on the ideal, perfect crystal structure. In real nanosheets, effects like edges, defects, strain, or structural ripples could locally break the inversion symmetry. While this might lead to a very weak, localized second-order response (e.g., second-harmonic generation from an edge), it would not support an efficient, bulk SPDC process as seen in conventional nonlinear crystals.\n*   **Third-Order Processes:** While `χ^(2)` is zero, the third-order susceptibility `χ^(3)` is non-zero in all materials, including borophene. This means borophene can exhibit third-order nonlinear effects, such as four-wave mixing. Photon pairs can be generated via *spontaneous four-wave mixing* (SFWM), but this is a different physical process than SPDC.\n*   **External Fields:** The application of a strong, static DC electric field can break the inversion symmetry of a centrosymmetric material, inducing an effective `χ^(2)`. This phenomenon is known as Electric-Field-Induced Second-Harmonic Generation (EFISH). In principle, this could enable a form of SPDC, but the question implies a standard setup with only incident light and no external static fields.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the fundamental symmetry of the material—boron nanosheets being centrosymmetric—prohibits the second-order nonlinear optical process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\n<<<No. Free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the material to have a non-zero second-order susceptibility (`χ^(2)`). A material can only possess a non-zero `χ^(2)` if its crystal structure lacks a center of inversion (i.e., is non-centrosymmetric). The stable, common phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases) are centrosymmetric. Due to this inversion symmetry, their bulk `χ^(2)` is necessarily zero, thus forbidding the SPDC process.>>>"
