    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of $K$.\n\n**1. Define the Tensor**\n\nLet the given function be $T(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$, where $x, y, z \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n$.\nThis function can be viewed as a tensor in the space $V^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V^{\\otimes n}$, where $V$ is the space of functions from $\\{0, 1\\}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. This space is a $2^n \\times 2^n \\times 2^n$ dimensional space.\n\nThe tensor $T$ can be written as the difference of two tensors: $T = P - J$, where:\n*   $P(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$\n*   $J(x, y, z) = 1$ for all $x, y, z$.\n\n**2. Understand Slice Rank**\n\nThe slice rank of a 3-tensor is the smallest integer $r$ such that the tensor can be written as a sum of $r$ \"slices\". A slice is a tensor that depends non-trivially on at most two of its three indices (partitions of variables). For our tensor $T(x,y,z)$, a slice is a function of one of the following forms:\n1.  $A(x) B(y, z)$\n2.  $C(y) D(x, z)$\n3.  $E(z) F(x, y)$\n\nThe slice rank of $T$, denoted $\\text{slicerank}(T)$, is the minimum number of such slice terms that sum up to $T$.\n\n**3. Relate Slice Rank of T, P, and J**\n\nThe triangle inequality for slice rank states that $\\text{slicerank}(A+B) \\le \\text{slicerank}(A) + \\text{slicerank}(B)$ and $|\\text{slicerank}(A) - \\text{slicerank}(B)| \\le \\text{slicerank}(A+B)$.\nThe tensor $J$ (the constant-1 function) can be written as $1 \\cdot 1$, where the first '1' is a function of $x$ and the second is a function of $(y,z)$. Thus, $J$ is a slice and $\\text{slicerank}(J)=1$.\nSo, we have $|\\text{slicerank}(P) - 1| \\le \\text{slicerank}(T) \\le \\text{slicerank}(P) + 1$.\nFor large $n$, the asymptotic behavior of $\\text{slicerank}(T)$ will be the same as that of $\\text{slicerank}(P)$. The $\\pm 1$ term will be absorbed by the sub-exponential factor $e^{o(n)}$. Our goal is to find the asymptotic value of $\\text{slicerank}(P)$.\n\n**4. Find an Upper Bound for the Slice Rank of P**\n\nLet's analyze the tensor $P(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$.\nWe can expand this product by grouping variables. Let's group $z$ variables separately from $x, y$ variables:\n$P(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n ((x_i + y_i) + z_i)$\nExpanding this product gives:\n$P(x, y, z) = \\sum_{S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}} \\left(\\prod_{i \\in S} z_i\\right) \\left(\\prod_{j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\setminus S} (x_j + y_j)\\right)$\nEach term in this sum is a product of a function of $z$ (namely $\\prod_{i \\in S} z_i$) and a function of $(x, y)$ (namely $\\prod_{j \\notin S} (x_j + y_j)$). This means each term is a slice of type 3 (z-slice).\nThe sum has $2^n$ terms, as there are $2^n$ subsets $S$ of $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThis shows that $P$ can be decomposed into a sum of $2^n$ slices of type 3. Therefore, its slice rank is at most $2^n$.\n$\\text{slicerank}(P) \\le 2^n$.\n\n**5. Find a Lower Bound for the Slice Rank of P**\n\nA key property connecting slice rank to standard matrix rank is that for any fixed value of one variable, say $z_0$, the slice rank of the original tensor is at least the rank of the resulting matrix (or tensor of lower order).\nLet $P_{z_0}(x,y) = P(x, y, z_0)$. For any slice $S(x,y,z)$, its restriction $S(x,y,z_0)$ is a matrix of rank at most 1.\nIf $S(x,y,z) = A(x)B(y,z)$, $S(x,y,z_0) = A(x)B(y,z_0)$ which has rank 1 (unless one factor is zero).\nIf $S(x,y,z) = C(y)D(x,z)$, $S(x,y,z_0) = C(y)D(x,z_0)$ which has rank 1.\nIf $S(x,y,z) = E(z)F(x,y)$, $S(x,y,z_0) = E(z_0)F(x,y)$ which has rank at most 1 (it is a scalar multiple of $F(x,y)$).\nIf $P = \\sum_{k=1}^r S_k$ where $r=\\text{slicerank}(P)$, then $P_{z_0} = \\sum_{k=1}^r S_k(x,y,z_0)$.\nSo, $\\text{rank}(P_{z_0}) \\le \\sum_{k=1}^r \\text{rank}(S_k(x,y,z_0)) \\le \\sum_{k=1}^r 1 = r = \\text{slicerank}(P)$.\n\nLet's choose $z_0 = (0, 0, \\dots, 0)$. The slice of the tensor $P$ at $z=0$ is the matrix $M(x,y) = P(x, y, 0)$.\n$M(x, y) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + 0) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i)$.\nThis matrix is the $n$-th Kronecker power of the $2 \\times 2$ matrix $M_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0+0 & 0+1 \\\\ 1+0 & 1+1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe rank of a tensor product of matrices is the product of their ranks.\n$\\text{rank}(M_1) = 2$ since its determinant is $0 \\cdot 2 - 1 \\cdot 1 = -1 \\ne 0$.\nSo, $\\text{rank}(M) = \\text{rank}(M_1^{\\otimes n}) = (\\text{rank}(M_1))^n = 2^n$.\nThus, we have the lower bound $\\text{slicerank}(P) \\ge \\text{rank}(M) = 2^n$.\n\n**6. Conclude the Slice Rank and Find K**\n\nFrom steps 4 and 5, we have $2^n \\le \\text{slicerank}(P) \\le 2^n$. This implies that $\\text{slicerank}(P) = 2^n$.\nAs argued in step 3, the asymptotic slice rank of $T$ is the same as that of $P$.\nSo, $\\text{slicerank}(T)$ is asymptotically $2^n$.\nThe problem states that the slice rank is $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. The term $e^{o(n)}$ accounts for any sub-exponential factors, leaving the base of the exponential as the primary term.\nTherefore, we must have:\n$2^n \\sim (3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$\nTaking the $n$-th root on both sides and letting $n \\to \\infty$, we get:\n$2 = 3/2^K$\nNow, we solve for $K$:\n$2 \\cdot 2^K = 3$\n$2^{K+1} = 3$\n$K+1 = \\log_2(3)$\n$K = \\log_2(3) - 1$\nUsing the property $\\log_a(b) - \\log_a(c) = \\log_a(b/c)$, we get:\n$K = \\log_2(3) - \\log_2(2) = \\log_2(3/2)$.\n\nFinal Answer format: <<<answer content>>>. The content should be the value of K.\n$K = \\log_2(1.5)$"
