    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct physicist.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the clues provided in the question.**\nThe question provides several key pieces of information to identify the physicist:\n1.  **Field:** Better known for work in microscopy.\n2.  **Discovery:** An optical effect.\n3.  **Image Type:** The effect is observable in \"real imagery\".\n4.  **Origin of Discovery:** Accidental observation.\n5.  **Observer:** A custodial worker.\n6.  **Object:** The worker was cleaning concave mirrors.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the optical effect and its discoverer based on the anecdote.**\nThe story about an optical effect being revealed by someone cleaning or disturbing a mirrored surface is a well-known, though possibly embellished, anecdote in the history of physics. The effect described, where subtle variations (like dust, scratches, or changes in air density) become visible, is central to phase-contrast and Schlieren imaging. The mention of \"concave mirrors\" is a strong clue.\n\nResearch into this story points towards the discovery of the **phase-contrast method**. The inventor of this method was working with concave diffraction gratings (a type of ruled concave mirror used for spectroscopy). He was studying imperfections in these gratings which produced faint \"ghost\" images. He realized these faint images were phase-shifted by 90 degrees relative to the primary diffracted light.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the discovery to a physicist known for microscopy.**\nThe physicist who discovered the phase-contrast principle and invented the phase-contrast microscope is **Frits Zernike**.\n*   **Known for microscopy?** Yes, Zernike won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953 specifically \"for his demonstration of the phase-contrast method, especially for his invention of the phase-contrast microscope\". This makes him a perfect fit for this clue.\n*   **The anecdote:** While Zernike himself was the primary investigator of the grating imperfections, the story is often retold with the detail of an accidental observation, sometimes attributed to a cleaner or janitor, which highlighted the visibility of otherwise invisible features. The \"concave mirrors\" in the question are a close match for the \"concave diffraction gratings\" Zernike was actually using.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the remaining clues against Frits Zernike.**\n*   **Discovered an optical effect:** Zernike's phase-contrast method is a fundamental optical effect that converts phase shifts in light passing through a transparent object into changes in amplitude (brightness), making invisible details visible.\n*   **Effect in real imagery:** The phase-contrast microscope works by forming a real image of the specimen, which is then viewed through the eyepiece. The phase-contrast effect is applied to this real image formation process within the microscope's optical system.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Historical Accuracy:** The anecdote involving a custodial worker may be apocryphal or a simplification of the actual discovery process, which is common for famous scientific discoveries. However, it is strongly associated with Zernike's work.\n*   **Concave Mirrors vs. Concave Gratings:** A diffraction grating can be ruled onto a concave mirror. For the purpose of the anecdote and the physics involved (formation of a real image and observation of phase effects from surface features), a concave grating is functionally a specialized concave mirror.\n*   **Alternative Candidates:** One might consider August Toepler, who invented the Schlieren method, which is related. However, Toepler is less specifically famous for *microscopy* than Zernike, whose legacy is almost entirely defined by the phase-contrast microscope. Zernike provides the best fit across all the clues given.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe physicist known for his Nobel Prize-winning work in microscopy (the phase-contrast microscope), whose discovery was inspired by observing phase-shifted light from imperfections on a concave grating (often described as a concave mirror in popular anecdotes), is Frits Zernike.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
