    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the kanji 謄.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Decomposition of the Kanji:**\n    The character 謄 can be broken down into two parts: a left-side component and a right-side component.\n    *   Left side: 言\n    *   Right side: 滕 (This component primarily serves a phonetic purpose, providing the sound *TŌ*).\n\n2.  **Identification of the Radical (Bushu):**\n    For dictionary lookup and semantic classification, one of these components is designated as the primary radical (部首, bushu). In kanji with a left-right structure, the radical is very often the left-side component, known as a \"hen\" (へん). In the case of 謄, the left-side component 言 is the radical.\n\n3.  **Meaning of the Radical:**\n    The radical 言 means \"words,\" \"to say,\" or \"speech.\" Kanji containing this radical typically relate to speaking, language, or written records (e.g., 話 - talk, 読 - read, 記 - record). The meaning of 謄, \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe,\" fits well within this category.\n\n4.  **Naming the Radical:**\n    While the radical's general name is \"gen\" (from its on'yomi) or \"kotoba\" (its kun'yomi), radicals have specific names based on their position within a character. When 言 appears on the left side of a kanji, its specific name is **ごんべん (gonben)**.\n\n5.  **Hepburn Transcription:**\n    The question requires the answer in Hepburn transcription. The Hepburn transcription of ごんべん is **Gonben**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Component Recognition:** It is crucial not to misidentify the left-hand radical. It is clearly 言 (gon), not a similar-looking radical like 月 (tsuki).\n*   **Positional Name:** The most accurate answer is the radical's positional name. Just as 女 on the left is \"onnahen\" (as in the example 媛), 言 on the left is \"gonben.\" Using the general name \"gen\" would be less precise.\n*   **Radical vs. Phonetic Component:** One must distinguish between the semantic radical (which indicates meaning, here 言) and the phonetic component (which indicates sound, here 滕). The radical is the part used for classification.\n\nFollowing this analysis, the name of the radical in the character 謄 is Gonben.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
