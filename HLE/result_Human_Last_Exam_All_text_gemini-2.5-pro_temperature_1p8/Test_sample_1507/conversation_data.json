    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Object - The Great Icosahedron**\nThe great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are regular non-convex (star) polyhedra. It is composed of 20 intersecting equilateral triangular faces. It has 12 vertices and 30 edges. The key feature here is that its faces pass through its interior, intersecting one another.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the \"Outer-Hull\"**\nThe question asks about the \"outer-hull\" of the great icosahedron. In geometry, the \"hull\" or more formally, the \"convex hull\" of a set of points (like the vertices of a polyhedron) is the smallest convex shape that contains all the points. For the great icosahedron, its 12 vertices are located at the same positions as the vertices of a regular (convex) icosahedron. Therefore, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the \"Triangulation\" Requirement**\nThe question asks for the \"minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull\". Triangulating a surface means dividing it into a set of non-overlapping triangles. We need to find the number of triangles that make up the surface of the outer-hull we identified in Step 2.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Concepts**\n*   The \"outer-hull of the great icosahedron\" is a **regular icosahedron**.\n*   The question is asking for the number of triangles on the surface of this regular icosahedron.\n*   A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid, and by definition, its surface is already composed of identical triangular faces. No further division or triangulation is needed, so the minimal number of triangles is simply its total number of faces.\n*   The phrase \"visible triangles from the outside\" confirms that we are dealing with the external faces of the convex hull, not the internal intersecting faces of the original great icosahedron.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Number of Faces of a Regular Icosahedron**\nA regular icosahedron is a well-known geometric shape. It is defined as a polyhedron with 20 faces. Each of these faces is an equilateral triangle.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe problem, once broken down, is simply asking for the number of faces on a regular icosahedron.\n\n*   **Object:** Great Icosahedron\n*   **Target:** Its outer-hull (Convex Hull) -> which is a Regular Icosahedron\n*   **Question:** Minimal number of triangles for its surface -> which is the number of faces of the Regular Icosahedron.\n*   **Number of faces on a Regular Icosahedron:** 20.\n\nAll 20 triangular faces of the regular icosahedron make up its outer surface. Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed to form this surface is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
