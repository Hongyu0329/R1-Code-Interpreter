    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:**\n    The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula expresses the logarithm of the product of two matrix exponentials, `log(exp(X)exp(Y))`, as a series of nested commutators of X and Y.\n    $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty Z_n(X, Y)$\n    where $Z_n(X, Y)$ is the sum of all terms of total degree `n`. The question asks for the number of linearly independent terms with nonzero coefficients in $Z_{10}(X, Y)$.\n\n2.  **Relate to Free Lie Algebras:**\n    The terms in the BCH expansion of a given order `n` form a basis for the `n`-th homogeneous component of the free Lie algebra generated by `X` and `Y`. A key theorem in this area (by Dynkin, Specht, and Wever) states that when expressed in a suitable basis (like the Lyndon basis), all coefficients in the BCH expansion are non-zero. Therefore, the number of non-zero coefficients of order `n` is equal to the dimension of the `n`-th homogeneous component of the free Lie algebra on two generators (`X` and `Y`).\n\n3.  **Use Witt's Formula:**\n    The dimension of the `n`-th homogeneous component of the free Lie algebra on `k` generators is given by Ernst Witt's formula:\n    $L_n(k) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\n    -   `n` is the order (degree) of the terms.\n    -   `k` is the number of generators.\n    -   `d|n` means `d` is a positive divisor of `n`.\n    -   `\\mu(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\n4.  **Identify Parameters for the Problem:**\n    -   The order is `n = 10`.\n    -   The generators are `X` and `Y`, so `k = 2`.\n\n5.  **Find the Divisors of `n = 10`:**\n    The positive divisors of 10 are `d = 1, 2, 5, 10`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Möbius Function `μ(d)` for each divisor:**\n    The Möbius function is defined as:\n    -   `μ(1) = 1`\n    -   `μ(d) = (-1)^r` if `d` is a product of `r` distinct primes.\n    -   `μ(d) = 0` if `d` has a squared prime factor.\n    -   For `d = 1`: `μ(1) = 1`\n    -   For `d = 2` (prime): `μ(2) = -1`\n    -   For `d = 5` (prime): `μ(5) = -1`\n    -   For `d = 10 = 2 * 5` (product of 2 distinct primes): `μ(10) = (-1)^2 = 1`\n\n7.  **Apply Witt's Formula - Calculate Each Term in the Sum:**\n    We will now compute `μ(d) * k^(n/d)` for each divisor `d`.\n    -   **For d = 1:**\n        -   `n/d = 10/1 = 10`\n        -   `μ(1) * 2^(10/1) = 1 * 2^10 = 1024`\n    -   **For d = 2:**\n        -   `n/d = 10/2 = 5`\n        -   `μ(2) * 2^(10/2) = -1 * 2^5 = -32`\n    -   **For d = 5:**\n        -   `n/d = 10/5 = 2`\n        -   `μ(5) * 2^(10/5) = -1 * 2^2 = -4`\n    -   **For d = 10:**\n        -   `n/d = 10/10 = 1`\n        -   `μ(10) * 2^(10/10) = 1 * 2^1 = 2`\n\n8.  **Sum the Terms and Finalize the Calculation:**\n    -   Sum the values calculated in the previous step:\n        Sum = `1024 + (-32) + (-4) + 2 = 1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 = 990`\n    -   Divide the sum by `n = 10`:\n        $L_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} * 990 = 99$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is the dimension of the 10th-degree component of the free Lie algebra on two generators, which is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
