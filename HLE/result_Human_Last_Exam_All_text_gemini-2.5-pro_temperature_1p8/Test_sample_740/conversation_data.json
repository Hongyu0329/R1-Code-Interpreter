    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the values of `λ` for which the given integral equation has no solutions.\n\n**1. Re-writing the Integral Equation**\n\nThe given equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y)`\n\nFirst, we simplify the kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series (or polynomial division), we have:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + xⁿ⁻³y² + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`\n\nThe kernel is a \"degenerate\" or \"separable\" kernel as it is a finite sum of products of functions of `x` and functions of `y`.\nLet `f_k(x) = x^{n-1-k}` and `g_k(y) = y^k`. The equation becomes:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} f_k(x) g_k(y)) u(y)`\n`u(x) = 1 + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`\n\n**2. Converting to a System of Linear Equations**\n\nLet's define a set of constants `c_k`:\n`c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`, for `k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for `u(x)`, we see that the solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}`\n\nTo find the constants `c_j` (using `j` as the index to avoid confusion), we substitute this expression for `u(y)` back into the definition of `c_j`:\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^j [1 + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k}] dy`\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k ∫₀¹ y^j y^{n-1-k} dy`\n`c_j = [y^(j+1) / (j+1)]₀¹ + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k ∫₀¹ y^(n+j-1-k) dy`\n`c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k [y^(n+j-k) / (n+j-k)]₀¹`\n`c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} (c_k / (n+j-k))`\n\nThis is a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknown constants `c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}`. We can write it in matrix form. Let `c` be the column vector `[c_0, ..., c_{n-1}]ᵀ` and `b` be the column vector `[1/1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]ᵀ`. The system is:\n`c = b + λAc`, or `(I - λA)c = b`\nwhere `I` is the `n x n` identity matrix and `A` is the `n x n` matrix with entries `A_jk = 1/(n+j-k)` for `j,k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\n**3. Applying the Fredholm Alternative**\n\nThe original integral equation `u = 1 + λTu` has been reduced to the linear system `(I - λA)c = b`. The existence of a solution depends on the properties of the matrix `(I - λA)`.\n\n*   If `det(I - λA) ≠ 0`, a unique solution for `c` exists, and therefore a unique solution `u(x)` exists. This is true if `1/λ` is not an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`.\n*   If `det(I - λA) = 0`, which means `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of `A`, then there are two possibilities:\n    1.  Infinitely many solutions if `b` is in the range of `(I - λA)` (i.e., `b` is orthogonal to the null space of `(I - λA)ᵀ`).\n    2.  No solutions if `b` is not in the range of `(I - λA)`.\n\nThe question asks for the values of `λ` for which there are no solutions. These are the values `λ` such that `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of `A`, and the condition for the existence of solutions (case 2.1) fails.\n\n**4. Analysis of the Condition for No Solution**\n\nLet's use the operator theory framework, which is equivalent. The equation is `(I - λT)u = 1`.\nThe kernel `K(x,y) = (x^n-y^n)/(x-y)` is symmetric since `K(y,x) = (y^n-x^n)/(y-x) = (-(x^n-y^n))/(-(x-y)) = K(x,y)`.\nThus, the integral operator `T` is self-adjoint (`T=T^*`).\n\nAccording to the Fredholm Alternative for self-adjoint operators, if `λ` is a characteristic value (i.e., `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of `T`), the equation `(I - λT)u = f` has a solution if and only if `f` is orthogonal to the null space of `(I - λT)`.\nIn our case, `f(x) = 1`. The null space of `(I - λT)` is the eigenspace `N_μ` of `T` corresponding to the eigenvalue `μ = 1/λ`.\nSo, a solution exists if and only if `⟨1, v⟩ = 0` for all `v` in the eigenspace `N_μ`. If there is at least one eigenfunction `v ∈ N_μ` for which `⟨1, v⟩ ≠ 0`, then `1` is not orthogonal to `N_μ` and there is **no solution**.\n\nLet's check this condition. Let `v` be an eigenfunction with eigenvalue `μ`.\n`T(v)(x) = μ v(x)`.\n`∫₀¹ K(x,y)v(y)dy = μv(x)`.\nIntegrating both sides with respect to `x` from 0 to 1:\n`∫₀¹ [∫₀¹ K(x,y)v(y)dy] dx = ∫₀¹ μv(x)dx`\n`∫₀¹ v(y) [∫₀¹ K(x,y)dx] dy = μ⟨1,v⟩`.\nSince `K(x,y)` is symmetric, `∫₀¹ K(x,y)dx = ∫₀¹ K(y,x)dx`. The integral `∫₀¹ K(y,x)dx` is simply `T(1)(y)`. Let's call `J(y) = T(1)(y)`.\nThe relation is: `⟨v, J⟩ = μ⟨v, 1⟩`, or `⟨v, J - μ*1⟩ = 0`.\n\nIf we assume a solution exists for the characteristic value `λ=1/μ`, then `⟨v, 1⟩ = 0` for all `v ∈ N_μ`. The relation above implies that we must also have `⟨v, J⟩ = 0`. So the entire eigenspace `N_μ` must be orthogonal to the subspace `S = span{1, J}`.\n\nThe range of `T` consists of polynomials of degree at most `n-1`, denoted `P_{n-1}`. Any eigenfunction `v` must be in `P_{n-1}`. The operator `T` can be restricted to `P_{n-1}`.\nLet's analyze the subspace `S` and its orthogonal complement `S^⊥` within `P_{n-1}`.\nIf `N_μ` is contained in `S^⊥`, then since `T` is self-adjoint, `S^⊥` must be an invariant subspace of `T`. This is equivalent to `S` being an invariant subspace of `T`.\n\nWe can check if `S = span{1, J}` is invariant under `T`.\n*   `T(1) = J`, which is in `S`.\n*   We need `T(J)` to be in `S`. A detailed calculation shows that `T(J)` is a linear combination of `1` and `J` only when `n=1` and `n=2`. For `n>2`, `S` is not an invariant subspace.\n\n**Conclusion for n > 2**:\nSince `S` is not an invariant subspace, `S^⊥` is not an invariant subspace. This means `S^⊥` cannot contain any eigenfunctions. Therefore, there can be no eigenspace `N_μ` that is completely contained in `S^⊥`. This implies that for any `N_μ`, it cannot be fully orthogonal to `S`. In particular, `N_μ` cannot be fully orthogonal to `1`.\nSo, for any eigenvalue `μ`, there must be an eigenfunction `v` with `⟨1, v⟩ ≠ 0`. By the Fredholm alternative, there is **no solution** for any `λ=1/μ`.\n\n**Conclusion for n=1, 2**:\nFor `n=1`, `J(x)=1`. So `S=span{1}`. The space of eigenfunctions is `P_0` (constants). `S^⊥` in `P_0` is `{0}`.\nFor `n=2`, `J(x) = x + 1/2`. `S=span{1, x}`. The space of eigenfunctions is `P_1`. `S` is all of `P_1`. So `S^⊥` in `P_1` is `{0}`.\nIn both cases, `S^⊥` contains no non-zero vectors, so it cannot contain any eigenfunctions. The same conclusion holds: for any eigenvalue `μ`, its eigenspace is not orthogonal to `1`. Thus, there is **no solution** for any `λ=1/μ`.\n\nTherefore, for any `n ≥ 1`, the equation has no solution for any `λ` that is a characteristic value of the integral operator `T`.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\nThe non-zero eigenvalues `μ` of the operator `T` are the same as the non-zero eigenvalues of the matrix `A` that we derived. So, the values of `λ` for which no solution exists are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `A`.\n\nThe matrix `A` has entries `A_jk = 1/(n+j-k)` for `j,k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\nLet `μ` be any eigenvalue of this matrix `A`. If `μ≠0`, then `λ=1/μ` is a value for which the equation has no solution. The number of such values is equal to the rank of `A`, which is `n`.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the non-zero eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A whose entries are given by A(j,k) = 1/(n+j-k), for j,k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.>>>"
