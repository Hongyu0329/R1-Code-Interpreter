The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for maximizing catalytic performance is not a single value and is highly dependent on the specific reaction.

*   **For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction**, the optimal atomic Ni/Ce ratio is generally in the range of **0.3 to 0.5**. This corresponds to a Ni loading of about 10-15 wt%, which balances high nickel dispersion with a maximum number of active interface sites between Ni and the ceria support.

*   **For the Water Splitting (WS) reaction**, the ideal ratio varies significantly with the method:
    *   In **electrocatalytic water splitting** (especially for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction), where Ni is the primary catalyst and CeOâ‚‚ is a promoter, a much higher atomic Ni/Ce ratio of **3 to 7** is often optimal.
    *   In **thermochemical water splitting** cycles, where Ni acts as a dopant to enhance the redox properties of ceria, a much lower atomic Ni/Ce ratio of around **0.1** is ideal.
