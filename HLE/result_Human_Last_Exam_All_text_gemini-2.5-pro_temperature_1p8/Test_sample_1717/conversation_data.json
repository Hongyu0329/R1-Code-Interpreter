    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Health in Expert Mode:**\n    First, we need the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player. According to the game's data, the Eye of Cthulhu has:\n    *   Normal Mode Health: 2800\n    *   **Expert Mode Health (1 Player): 3640**\n\n2.  **Determine the Multiplayer Health Scaling Formula:**\n    In Terraria's Expert Mode, boss health increases as more players join the game. The formula for this scaling is well-documented and based on the game's source code.\n    *   Let `n` be the number of players.\n    *   The health multiplier is calculated as: `Multiplier = 1 + 0.35 * (n - 1)`\n    *   This means the multiplier starts at 1x for the first player and increases by 0.35 for each additional player.\n    *   The total health `H(n)` is the base Expert Mode health multiplied by this factor:\n        `H(n) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (n - 1))`\n\n3.  **Analyze the Formula with an Infinite Number of Players:**\n    The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. This requires us to analyze the limit of the health formula as `n` approaches infinity.\n    *   We can simplify the formula:\n        `H(n) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35n - 0.35)`\n        `H(n) = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35n)`\n        `H(n) = 2366 + 1274n`\n    *   This is a linear function. As the number of players (`n`) increases, the health `H(n)` increases without any mathematical bound.\n    *   Mathematically, `lim (n -> ∞) (2366 + 1274n) = ∞`.\n    *   If we only consider the formula, the health would be infinite.\n\n4.  **Consider the Constraints of the Source Code:**\n    The question crucially specifies \"According to the source code\". This directs us to look beyond the mathematical formula and consider the technical limitations of the game's engine.\n    *   In the source code of Terraria (written in C#), the property that stores the maximum health of an NPC (`NPC.lifeMax`) is a 32-bit signed integer (`int`).\n    *   A 32-bit signed integer has a fixed range of values it can store.\n\n5.  **Identify the Technical Limit (Data Type Maximum Value):**\n    The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer (`System.Int32`) is **2³¹ - 1**.\n    *   `int.MaxValue = 2,147,483,647`\n    *   The game's code cannot assign or store a health value for any NPC that is greater than this number. Even if the scaling formula calculates a higher value, it would either be clamped to this maximum or cause an integer overflow (likely resulting in a negative number, which would be a bug), but the highest legitimate value it can hold is `int.MaxValue`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the health scaling formula tends towards infinity as the number of players increases, the game's implementation imposes a hard limit. The theoretical maximum health for any NPC, including the Eye of Cthulhu, is constrained by the maximum value of the data type used to store its health in the source code. Therefore, the theoretical maximum health is the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
