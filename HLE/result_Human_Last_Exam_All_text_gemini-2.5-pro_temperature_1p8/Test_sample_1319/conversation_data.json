    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question requires us to identify all the *historical* (i.e., real, non-mythical) mountains mentioned in Homer's *Iliad*, find their modern elevations, and then identify the tallest among them, specifically excluding Mount Olympus.\n\n**2. List the Historical Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad***\nWe must find passages in the *Iliad* that name specific, identifiable mountains.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, mentioned frequently throughout the epic. It is the highest mountain in Greece.\n    *   **Elevation:** 2,918 meters (9,573 ft). This serves as our point of exclusion.\n\n*   **Mount Ida:** A crucial setting in the *Iliad*. Located near Troy (in modern-day Turkey), it's the vantage point from which Zeus often observes the Trojan War. Its highest peak is Gargarus.\n    *   **Mention:** For example, in Book 8, Zeus goes \"...to Ida of the many springs, mother of wild beasts, to Gargarus...\"\n    *   **Elevation:** 1,774 meters (5,820 ft).\n\n*   **Mount Athos:** Mentioned by Homer during Hera's journey from Olympus to Lemnos in Book 14.\n    *   **Mention:** \"From Athos she stepped upon the sea...\". It is a prominent mountain on a peninsula in northeastern Greece.\n    *   **Elevation:** 2,033 meters (6,670 ft).\n\n*   **The Peak of Samothrace (Mount Fengari/Saos):** In Book 13, Poseidon uses this peak as his own observation post to watch the battle.\n    *   **Mention:** \"...he had gone up and sat on the highest peak of wooded Samos of Thrace, whence all Ida was to be seen...\".\n    *   **Elevation:** 1,611 meters (5,285 ft).\n\n*   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain in Thessaly, Greece, is mentioned in connection with Achilles' famous spear, which was made from an ash tree from its summit.\n    *   **Mention:** In Book 16, Achilles' armor is described, including \"...the Pelian ash, which Chiron had given to his father from the peak of Pelion...\".\n    *   **Elevation:** 1,624 meters (5,328 ft).\n\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** This mountain is mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2) as a landmark in Maeonia (Lydia), the homeland of Iphition.\n    *   **Mention:** \"...the Meiones, whose birthplace was under snowy Tmolos...\". It is a real mountain range (modern name: BozdaÄŸlar) in what is now western Turkey.\n    *   **Elevation:** The highest peak is approximately 2,159 meters (7,083 ft).\n\n**3. Compare the Elevations**\nNow, let's list the candidate mountains and their elevations to find the tallest after Olympus:\n\n*   Mount Olympus: 2,918 m (Excluded)\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** ~2,159 m\n*   **Mount Athos:** ~2,033 m\n*   **Mount Ida:** ~1,774 m\n*   **Mount Pelion:** ~1,624 m\n*   **The Peak of Samothrace:** ~1,611 m\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\nBy comparing the elevations of the historical mountains explicitly mentioned in the *Iliad*, Mount Tmolus is the tallest after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Careful Points Noted\n*   The question specifies *historical* mountains, meaning we must confirm that the named locations correspond to real geographical features. All the mountains listed above are real.\n*   The question explicitly excludes Mount Olympus, so it must be identified first and then set aside from the final ranking.\n*   Elevations can have slight variations depending on the source, but the relative ranking of these specific mountains is consistent.\n*   It is crucial to verify that each mountain is actually mentioned *within the text of the Iliad* and not just associated with its mythology in other sources. All the mountains in the final comparison have direct textual references in the epic.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
