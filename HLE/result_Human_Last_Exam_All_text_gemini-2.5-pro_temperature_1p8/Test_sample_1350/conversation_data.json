    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct character.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for a specific character in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*. This character must meet three criteria:\n1.  They must have visited a Roman city.\n2.  They describe the religious practices or foundational myths of the Romans.\n3.  This description must contain elements that a reader would recognize as the story of Romulus and Remus, specifically their connection to a she-wolf.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the Novel's Plot and Characters**\n*The House of the Wolfings* is about a Gothic tribe, the Wolfings, preparing to defend their homeland from an invading Roman army. The central conflict involves their leader, Thiodolf. Since the Romans are the antagonists, discussions about their nature, customs, and origins are expected. The key is to find a character who has *direct experience* with the Romans.\n\n**Step 3: Search for a Character with Roman Experience**\nMost of the Wolfings have only heard tales of the Romans or encountered them in battle. We need to look for a character who has lived among them. In the early part of the book, as the Wolfings gather in their great hall to discuss the threat, different characters share their views.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the Relevant Scene and Speaker**\nIn Chapter IV, \"They Talk of the Romans,\" the chieftains are discussing the approaching war. One of the speakers is introduced as having unique knowledge. The text states:\n> \"Then spake Otter, the son of Hiarandi the Hun-Slayer; he was a man of the Wolfings... but one who had travelled far, and had been a thrall in the cities of the Romans, and had gotten his freedom by his stoutness and his valiancy...\"\n\nThis establishes that the character **Otter** has visited Roman cities, fulfilling the first criterion.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Character's Speech for the Mythological Reference**\nOtter proceeds to describe the Romans to his kinsmen. He talks about their might, their organized society, and their beliefs. In his speech, he directly addresses their origin myth:\n> \"...And as for their Gods, they are many... But this is the story of their first fathers, that they were **Wolf-sucklings**; though forsooth I deem that this is but a tale; for if the Wolf had been their foster-mother, and she of our sacred kindred, then had these men been other than they be.\"\n\n**Step 6: Connect the Description to Romulus and Remus**\nThe term **\"Wolf-sucklings\"** is a clear and direct reference to the foundational myth of Rome. In the legend, the twin infants Romulus and Remus are left to die but are saved and suckled by a she-wolf (Lupa). This description is a deliberate allusion by William Morris that his educated Victorian readers would immediately recognize. This fulfills the second and third criteria of the question.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe character who has been a captive (\"thrall\") in Roman cities and who describes their origin story as being founded by \"Wolf-sucklings\" (a reference to Romulus and Remus) is Otter.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
