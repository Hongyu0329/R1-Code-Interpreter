    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of MLB Triple Crown winners.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Batting Triple Crown\nThe first step is to understand what constitutes a \"Triple Crown\" in baseball. The batting Triple Crown is one of the most prestigious and rare achievements for a hitter. To win it, a player must lead their respective league (American League or National League) in all three of the following statistical categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average (BA)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n### Step 2: Identify the American League (AL) Triple Crown Winners\nWe need to list all the players who have accomplished this feat in the American League.\n\n*   **1901:** Nap Lajoie\n*   **1909:** Ty Cobb\n*   **1933:** Jimmie Foxx\n*   **1934:** Lou Gehrig\n*   **1942:** Ted Williams\n*   **1947:** Ted Williams (**Careful Point:** This is the second win for the same player. He still counts as one unique winner).\n*   **1956:** Mickey Mantle\n*   **1966:** Frank Robinson\n*   **1967:** Carl Yastrzemski\n*   **2012:** Miguel Cabrera\n\nCounting the unique players from this list, we have **9** distinct winners in the American League. The Triple Crown has been won 10 times in the AL.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the National League (NL) Triple Crown Winners\nNext, we list all the players who have won the Triple Crown in the National League. This includes players from recognized predecessor Major Leagues like the American Association (AA).\n\n*   **1878:** Paul Hines\n*   **1887:** Tip O'Neill (**Careful Point:** This was in the American Association, which MLB recognizes as a Major League).\n*   **1894:** Hugh Duffy\n*   **1912:** Heinie Zimmerman\n*   **1922:** Rogers Hornsby\n*   **1925:** Rogers Hornsby (**Careful Point:** This is the second win for the same player. He still counts as one unique winner).\n*   **1933:** Chuck Klein\n*   **1937:** Joe Medwick\n\nCounting the unique players from this list, we have **7** distinct winners in the National League. The Triple Crown has been won 8 times in the NL.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Unique Winners\nThe question asks for the total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB, which means combining the lists from both leagues and counting the total number of unique individuals.\n\n*   Unique Winners from the American League: 9\n*   Unique Winners from the National League: 7\n\nSince no player has won the Triple Crown in both the AL and NL, we can simply add the two numbers together.\n\nTotal Unique Winners = 9 (from AL) + 7 (from NL) = 16\n\n### Final Answer\nThere have been a total of 16 different players who have won the MLB batting Triple Crown.\n\n<<<16>>>"
