    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends in the same leg position as it starts.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe question asks to identify a classical ballet step where the configuration of the legs (which foot is in front/back) is the same at the end of the movement as it was at the beginning. We will analyze a typical execution of each step starting from the 5th position. Let's assume for our examples that the right foot is in front (RFF) at the start. The step must end with the right foot still in front.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each answer choice.**\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** 5th position (e.g., RFF).\n    *   **Movement:** 'Entrechat' means interwoven or braided. 'Six' refers to six movements of the legs crossing (open-close-open-close-open-close), which results in three changes of the feet in the air.\n    *   **Ending Position:** An odd number of changes (three) means the feet will be reversed. Starting with RFF, the dancer will land with the left foot in front (LFF).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** 5th position (e.g., RFF).\n    *   **Movement:** 'Échappé' means to escape, describing the legs opening from a closed position (5th) to an open one (2nd or 4th). 'Battu' means beaten, so the legs beat together on the way out. 'Changé' explicitly means \"changed.\" After opening to 2nd position, the dancer jumps and closes the feet back to 5th position, but in the opposite configuration.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Because of the 'changé' directive, the dancer will land with the left foot in front (LFF).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** 5th position (e.g., RFF).\n    *   **Movement:** 'Assemblé' means \"to assemble\" or \"bring together.\" In a standard assemblé (e.g., assemblé côté, or side assemblé), the working leg (either front or back) brushes out to the side. The dancer then jumps off the supporting leg, and both legs are brought together (\"assembled\") in the air to land simultaneously in 5th position. Unless specified otherwise (like 'assemblé dessus' or 'dessous'), the legs land in their original configuration. If the right foot brushes out from the front, it lands back in the front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in the same 5th position they started in (RFF).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is the same as the starting position.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** 5th position (e.g., RFF).\n    *   **Movement:** 'Glissade' means to glide. 'Derrière' means \"behind.\" This specifies that the movement finishes by closing the working foot to the back. Starting with RFF, the back (left) foot will glide to the side, the weight will transfer to it, and then the original front (right) foot will close *behind* the left foot.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The original back foot is now in front. The dancer ends in 5th position with the left foot in front (LFF).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** 5th position (e.g., RFF).\n    *   **Movement:** This is a complex, decorative step, similar to a pas de chat but with a double rond de jambe en l'air. The first leg (the one starting in front) is picked up and does an outward circle (rond de jambe en dehors) as the dancer lands on it, while the second leg (starting in back) does an inward circle (rond de jambe en dedans) and typically closes in front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Because the leg that starts in the back closes in the front, the feet have changed positions. The dancer ends with the left foot in front (LFF).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion**\nAfter analyzing all the steps, the only one whose standard execution results in the same starting and ending leg position is the **Assemblé**. All other options involve an explicit or inherent change in the feet's front/back placement.\n\n<<<C>>>"
