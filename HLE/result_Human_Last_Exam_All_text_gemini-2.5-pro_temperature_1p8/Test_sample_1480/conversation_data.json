    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The fundamental task is to calculate the \"rule activation level\". In the context of fuzzy logic, this means determining the output of a fuzzy rule's implication step. The implication combines the firing strength of the rule's antecedent (the \"IF\" part) with the membership function of the rule's consequent (the \"THEN\" part).\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Given Information:**\n    *   `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`: This value represents the firing strength of the antecedent for the k-th rule. It is a single scalar value indicating the degree to which the input `x'` matches the condition of the rule's antecedent.\n    *   `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`: This is the membership grade of a specific output value `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k`. It tells us how strongly `y_j` belongs to the output fuzzy set defined by the rule.\n    *   **Operation:** The problem specifies that a \"t-norm operation\" should be used. This operation is the standard way to model logical \"AND\" and is used for implication in Mamdani-type fuzzy systems.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation:** The activation level of the rule's consequent for a specific output `y_j` is calculated by applying the t-norm to the antecedent firing strength and the consequent membership grade.\n    *   `Activation Level = t_norm (Antecedent Firing Strength, Consequent Membership Grade)`\n    *   `Activation Level = t_norm (Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n    *   `Activation Level = t_norm (0.7, 0.9)`\n\n4.  **Choose the Specific T-norm:** A \"t-norm\" is a class of functions. The most common t-norms used in fuzzy systems are:\n    *   **Minimum t-norm:** `t(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n    *   **Product t-norm:** `t(a, b) = a * b`\n    Since the problem does not specify which t-norm to use, we follow the most common convention in fuzzy logic, which is to use the **Minimum** t-norm. This is the standard operator for the Mamdani implication method.\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:** Using the minimum t-norm with the given values:\n    *   `Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n    *   `Activation Level = 0.7`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **The \"Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set\" Context:** The question mentions IT3 FSs, which are very complex. However, the inputs provided are simple scalars (`0.7`, `0.9`). This indicates that the problem is not about the intricate details of IT3 FSs, but rather about the fundamental fuzzy operation (the t-norm) that is common to all types of fuzzy systems. The given scalars could represent, for instance, the upper bounds of the actual IT3 FS firing levels and memberships, for which a single activation level calculation is required.\n2.  **T-Norm Ambiguity:** As mentioned, \"t-norm\" is a general term. If a different t-norm were intended, the answer would change (e.g., using the product t-norm would yield `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`). However, without other information, the **minimum** operator is the standard and safest assumption.\n3.  **Mamdani Implication:** The process described (applying the antecedent firing strength to the consequent fuzzy set via a t-norm) is characteristic of a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system. This is the most common type of fuzzy system where consequents are themselves fuzzy sets.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nFollowing the analysis, the problem simplifies to applying the standard minimum t-norm to the two provided scalar values.\n\n*   **Antecedent Firing Strength:** 0.7\n*   **Consequent Membership:** 0.9\n*   **Operation:** `min(0.7, 0.9)`\n*   **Result:** 0.7\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
