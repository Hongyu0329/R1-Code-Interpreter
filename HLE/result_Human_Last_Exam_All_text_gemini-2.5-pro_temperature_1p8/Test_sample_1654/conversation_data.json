    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe question asks for the number of times Anton Chekhov described Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat in a way that symbolizes his shifting mentality in the short story \"The Chameleon.\" This symbolic description is primarily conveyed through the actions of Otchumyelov taking his coat off and putting it back on. Each action corresponds to a change in his attitude based on his evolving understanding of the dog's ownership.\n\n1.  **Initial Scene:** The story begins with Otchumyelov wearing his \"new overcoat.\" This sets the stage but is not a description of a shift in mentality. The shifts begin when the conflict arises.\n\n2.  **First Instance (Fear):** After Otchumyelov begins his investigation, someone in the crowd suggests the dog belongs to General Zhigalov. Fearing the wrath of a person of high rank, Otchumyelov feels a sudden chill.\n    *   **Action:** He asks the policeman, Yeldyrin, \"Help me on with my overcoat... I feel a cold shiver.\"\n    *   **Mentality Shift:** From authoritative police officer to a fearful, subservient official.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n3.  **Second Instance (Assertiveness):** A moment later, Yeldyrin states with certainty that the dog does not belong to the General. Relieved and feeling his authority return, Otchumyelov suddenly feels hot.\n    *   **Action:** He says, \"Take my coat off, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot!\"\n    *   **Mentality Shift:** Back to being a stern, domineering figure, now that the threat of a powerful owner seems gone.\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n4.  **Third Instance (Renewed Fear):** Someone in the crowd speculates that it still might be the General's dog, noting they saw a similar one in his yard recently. The uncertainty and fear return.\n    *   **Action:** Otchumyelov once again feels a chill and tells Yeldyrin, \"Help me on with my coat... I think the wind's getting up.\"\n    *   **Mentality Shift:** Reverting to the cautious and fearful state, protecting himself from potential trouble.\n    *   **Count: 3**\n\n5.  **Fourth Instance (Renewed Assertiveness):** The General's cook, Prokhor, arrives and says the dog does not belong to the General. Otchumyelov is once again relieved.\n    *   **Action:** He again feels hot and orders, \"Take my coat off...\"\n    *   **Mentality Shift:** He snaps back to his authoritative self, ready to punish the dog and its owner.\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n6.  **Fifth Instance (Final Resolution):** Prokhor clarifies that the dog belongs to the General's brother, who is visiting. This identifies the owner as still being connected to power. Otchumyelov's demeanor changes completely to one of fawning admiration for the \"dear little dog.\" As he leaves the scene, his final action with the coat signifies his settled state of mind.\n    *   **Action:** Chekhov writes that Otchumyelov, after threatening the victim Khryukin, \"wraps himself in his greatcoat\" and continues on his way. This act of wrapping the coat around himself symbolizes his retreat into a \"safe\" position of deference to social superiors.\n    *   **Mentality Shift:** A final shift to subservience and obsequiousness, having found the \"correct\" social position to take.\n    *   **Count: 5**\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The analysis must focus on the *symbolic* descriptions, specifically the actions that represent a *shift* in mentality, not just every mention of the coat.\n*   The first two actions are putting the coat on and taking it off.\n*   The next two actions are a repeat of putting it on and taking it off.\n*   The final action, \"wrapping himself in his greatcoat,\" is a distinct and final symbolic gesture that concludes the sequence of his mental shifts. It must be counted as a separate instance of symbolic description.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBy systematically tracking Otchumyelov's psychological shifts and the corresponding actions with his coat, we can count five distinct descriptions that serve a symbolic purpose.\n\n1.  Putting it on (fear).\n2.  Taking it off (relief/authority).\n3.  Putting it on again (renewed fear).\n4.  Taking it off again (renewed relief/authority).\n5.  Wrapping it around himself (final subservient resolution).\n\nTherefore, Chekhov described the coat in this symbolic manner five times.\n\n<<<5>>>"
