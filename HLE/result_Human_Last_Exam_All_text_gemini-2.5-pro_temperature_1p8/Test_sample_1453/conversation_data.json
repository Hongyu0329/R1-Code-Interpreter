    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the protein sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Coiled-Coil Structure and the Heptad Repeat**\n\nCoiled-coils are formed by two or more alpha-helices that wrap around each other. Their sequences are characterized by a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern called a heptad repeat, denoted by the positions `(a b c d e f g)n`.\n\n*   The **`a` and `d` positions** are the most critical. They are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues (like L, I, V, A, M, W) and form the hydrophobic core that holds the oligomer together.\n*   The **`e` and `g` positions** are often occupied by charged or polar residues. They are located on the periphery of the hydrophobic core and frequently form stabilizing salt bridges or hydrogen bonds between the helices.\n*   The **`b`, `c`, and `f` positions** are solvent-exposed and are usually occupied by hydrophilic residues.\n\nThe specific identity and size of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions are the primary determinants of the oligomeric state due to the constraints of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Heptad Repeat in the Given Sequence**\n\nThe sequence is: `G E I A Q S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G` (32 amino acids)\n\nWe need to find the correct \"frame\" or starting position for the `(a b c d e f g)` repeat. We test all seven possible frames by looking for the most chemically sensible arrangement, which is a consistent, non-polar hydrophobic core at the `a` and `d` positions.\n\nLet's test the frame where the 4th residue, `A`, is at an `a` position. This implies the 1st residue, `G`, is at an `e` position.\n\nSequence with numbered positions:\n`1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32`\n`G  E  I  A  Q  S  L  K  E  I  A  K  S  L  K  E  I  A  W  S  L  K  E  I  A  Q  S  L  K  G`\n\nLet's assign the `(e f g a b c d)` register to the first heptad (positions 1-7):\n`e f g a b c d`\n`G E I A Q S L`\n\nThis gives `a`=A and `d`=L. Let's see if this pattern holds for the entire sequence.\n*   **'a' positions:** (4, 11, 18, 25) -> **A, A, A, A** (Alanine)\n*   **'d' positions:** (7, 14, 21, 28) -> **L, L, L, L** (Leucine)\n\nThis alignment results in a perfectly consistent and hydrophobic core. The `a` positions are all occupied by the small hydrophobic residue Alanine, and the `d` positions are all occupied by the larger hydrophobic residue Leucine. Other frames result in unfavorable polar or charged residues within the hydrophobic core, making them highly unlikely. For instance, the large hydrophobic Tryptophan (`W`) at position 19 falls on a `b` position (`K-E-I-A-W-S-L` is `e-f-g-a-b-c-d`), which is solvent-exposed and perfectly acceptable.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Knobs-into-Holes Packing Rules**\n\nThe oligomeric state is determined by how efficiently the side chains (\"knobs\") from the `a` and `d` positions of one helix pack into the spaces (\"holes\") on the surface of the adjacent helix/helices.\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Often characterized by a mix of residue sizes or patterns like `L-x-x-x-A-x-x-`. The tight packing makes having large residues at all core positions difficult.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Has a less strained core. It is classically defined by having large, bulky hydrophobic residues at both `a` and `d` positions. Common patterns are `I-x-x-x-L-x-x-` or `L-x-x-x-I-x-x-`.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** To relieve steric hindrance in the very crowded core of a four-helix bundle, the optimal packing arrangement often involves having a **small** residue at the `a` position and a **large** residue at the `d` position.\n\nOur sequence has the pattern: **A**lanine at `a`, **L**eucine at `d` (`A-x-x-x-L-x-x-`).\nThis is the textbook motif for a **parallel tetramer**. The small Alanine \"knobs\" from the `a` positions pack neatly into the center of the bundle, while the larger Leucine \"knobs\" from the `d` positions fit into the more accommodating pockets on the outside of the core.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence contains a clear heptad repeat with Alanine (A) at all `a` positions and Leucine (L) at all `d` positions. Based on the principles of knobs-into-holes packing, this specific `(a=A, d=L)` pattern is known to drive the formation of a **tetramer (4-helix bundle)** for maximum packing efficiency and stability.\n\nThe oligomeric state would therefore be 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
