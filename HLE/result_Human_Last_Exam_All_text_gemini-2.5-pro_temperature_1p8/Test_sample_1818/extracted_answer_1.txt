The optimal setting is the combination with the **lowest possible Spreading Factor** (starting from SF7) for which the link can be closed with a PER not exceeding 1%, and at that Spreading Factor, the **lowest possible Transmit Power** (in 2 dBm increments from 2 dBm) that achieves this reliability target.
