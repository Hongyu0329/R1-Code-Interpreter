    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal area of the convex domain.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and the family of lines.**\nWe are looking for the minimum area of a convex set `K` in the Euclidean plane `R^2`.\nThis set `K` must intersect every line `L_{p,q}` given by the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (`gcd(p, q) = 1`).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the condition of intersection for a convex set.**\nA convex set `K` intersects a line `px + qy = 1` if and only if the values of the linear function `f(x,y) = px + qy` on `K` span across 1. That is:\n`inf_{(x,y) \\in K} (px+qy) \\le 1 \\le sup_{(x,y) \\in K} (px+qy)`\nThis condition must hold for all pairs of coprime integers `(p,q)`.\n\n**Step 3: Derive necessary conditions on the geometry of K.**\nLet's test some specific lines from the family `L_{p,q}`.\n*   Let `(p,q) = (1,0)`. `gcd(1,0)=1`. The line is `x=1`. So `K` must intersect the line `x=1`.\n*   Let `(p,q) = (-1,0)`. `gcd(-1,0)=1`. The line is `-x=1`, or `x=-1`. So `K` must intersect the line `x=-1`.\n*   Let `(p,q) = (0,1)`. `gcd(0,1)=1`. The line is `y=1`. So `K` must intersect the line `y=1`.\n*   Let `(p,q) = (0,-1)`. `gcd(0,-1)=1`. The line is `-y=1`, or `y=-1`. So `K` must intersect the line `y=-1`.\n\n**Step 4: Use the properties of convexity to establish bounds on the width of K.**\nSince `K` is a convex set, if it contains a point on the line `x=1` and a point on the line `x=-1`, it must contain the entire line segment connecting these two points. The projection of this segment onto the x-axis is the interval `[-1, 1]`.\nTherefore, the projection of `K` onto the x-axis must contain the interval `[-1, 1]`.\nThe \"width\" of `K` in the x-direction, `w_x`, is defined as `w_x = sup_{(x,y)\\in K} x - inf_{(x,y)\\in K} x`.\nFrom the above, `sup x \\ge 1` and `inf x \\le -1`. Thus, `w_x \\ge 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n\nSimilarly, using the lines `y=1` and `y=-1`, we can conclude that the width of `K` in the y-direction, `w_y`, must satisfy `w_y \\ge 2`.\n\n**Step 5: Relate the widths of a convex set to its area.**\nThere is a fundamental result in convex geometry relating the area of a planar convex set to its widths in any two perpendicular directions. For any convex set `K`, its area `A` satisfies the inequality:\n`A \\ge (1/2) * w_x * w_y`\nwhere `w_x` and `w_y` are the widths in two orthogonal directions (like the x and y axes).\n\nUsing the minimum widths we derived in Step 4, we find a lower bound for the area of `K`:\n`A \\ge (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2`.\nThis means any convex set `K` that satisfies the given conditions must have an area of at least 2.\n\n**Step 6: Construct a candidate set and verify it meets the area bound.**\nTo show that 2 is the minimum possible area, we need to find an example of a convex set that satisfies the conditions and has an area of exactly 2.\n\nConsider the square `S` defined by the inequality `|x| + |y| \\le 1`.\n*   **Convexity:** This region is a square with vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`. A square is a convex set.\n*   **Area:** The side length of this square is `\\sqrt{1^2+1^2} = \\sqrt{2}`. The area is `(\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2`.\n*   **Intersection Condition:** We must verify that `S` intersects every line `px + qy = 1` for coprime integers `p, q`.\n    Let's find the minimum and maximum values of `f(x,y) = px+qy` on the square `S`. Since `S` is a convex polygon, the extrema will occur at its vertices.\n    *   At `(1,0)`, `f(1,0) = p`.\n    *   At `(0,1)`, `f(0,1) = q`.\n    *   At `(-1,0)`, `f(-1,0) = -p`.\n    *   At `(0,-1)`, `f(0,-1) = -q`.\n    The supremum of `px+qy` on `S` is `sup_{S}(px+qy) = max(p, -p, q, -q) = max(|p|, |q|)`.\n    The infimum is `inf_{S}(px+qy) = min(p, -p, q, -q) = -max(|p|, |q|)`.\n    The intersection condition `inf \\le 1 \\le sup` becomes `-max(|p|,|q|) \\le 1 \\le max(|p|,|q|)`.\n    This simplifies to `max(|p|,|q|) \\ge 1`.\n    Since `p` and `q` are coprime integers, they cannot both be zero. Therefore, at least one of `|p|` or `|q|` must be at least 1. This means `max(|p|,|q|) \\ge 1` is always true for any pair of coprime integers `(p,q)`.\n    Thus, the square `S` intersects every line in the family `L_{p,q}`.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion.**\nWe have shown that any convex set `K` satisfying the problem's conditions must have an area of at least 2. We have also shown that the square `|x|+|y| \\le 1` is a convex set that satisfies the conditions and has an area of exactly 2.\nTherefore, the minimal area of such a convex domain is 2."
