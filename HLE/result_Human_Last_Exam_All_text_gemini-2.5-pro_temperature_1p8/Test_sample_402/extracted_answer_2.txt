The proposed filtering strategy involves a two-pass analysis. First, perform a preliminary differential expression analysis comparing the CAR-IL15 samples against the CAR-only samples. From these results, identify contaminant genes by selecting those with a highly significant negative log2 fold change (e.g., log2FC < -2 and adjusted p-value < 0.05), which reflects their high abundance in the CAR-only group and absence in the cleaner CAR-IL15 group. This creates a list of contaminant gene IDs. This list is then used to remove these specific genes from the original raw count matrix using a command-line tool like `grep`. Finally, the entire bioinformatics pipeline, including normalization, differential expression, and pathway analysis, is re-run from the beginning using this newly generated clean count matrix to obtain accurate and unbiased results.
