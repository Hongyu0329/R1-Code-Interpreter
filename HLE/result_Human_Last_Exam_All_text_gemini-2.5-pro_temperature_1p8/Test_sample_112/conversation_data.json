    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the \"Sir Launfal\" in question.**\nThe question refers to \"Sir Launfal,\" a 14th-century Middle English romance poem written by Thomas Chestre. It's an adaptation of an earlier Old French poem, \"Lanval,\" by Marie de France.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the meaning of \"preserved alongside.\"**\nThis phrase strongly suggests that the poem and the book of manners were kept together in the same physical object, which for texts from this period would be a manuscript.\n\n**Step 3: Find the manuscript containing \"Sir Launfal.\"**\nThomas Chestre's \"Sir Launfal\" survives in only one medieval manuscript. This manuscript is **Cotton MS Caligula A.II**, which is held in the British Library.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the contents of the manuscript.**\nCotton MS Caligula A.II is an anthology, meaning it contains several different works bound together. By examining the table of contents for this manuscript, we can see what other texts were \"preserved alongside\" Sir Launfal.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the \"book of manners\" within the manuscript.**\nAmong the various romances and religious texts in Cotton MS Caligula A.II, there is a specific poem on etiquette and proper behavior. This text is a classic example of a \"book of manners\" or courtesy book. Its title is **\"The Boke of Curtasye\"** (The Book of Courtesy).\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the answer.**\nSince \"The Boke of Curtasye\" is included in the same manuscript (Cotton MS Caligula A.II) as the only surviving copy of Thomas Chestre's \"Sir Launfal,\" it is the book of manners that was preserved alongside it.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   It is crucial to identify the correct \"Sir Launfal\" (the Middle English version by Chestre, not the French original).\n*   The key to the answer lies in understanding that \"preserved alongside\" refers to being part of the same manuscript collection.\n*   Knowing the name of the specific manuscript (Cotton MS Caligula A.II) confirms the direct physical connection between the two works.\n\n***\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
