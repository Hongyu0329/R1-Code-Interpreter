    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the system of differential equations:**\n    $$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1 - u(t))$$\n    $$u'(t) = (u(t) - 1)u^2(t)$$\n    We can write this as:\n    $$\\frac{dd}{dt} = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^3(u - 1)$$\n    $$\\frac{du}{dt} = u^2(u - 1)$$\n    The analysis is on the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n2.  **Find the equilibrium points:**\n    Equilibrium points are where $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\n    From $u'(t) = 0$, we have $u^2(u-1) = 0$, which gives $u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\n    *   If $u = 0$: Substitute into $d'(t) = 0$.\n        $2d^2 + (0 - 0)d + 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\n        So, $(0, 0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n\n    *   If $u = 1$: Substitute into $d'(t) = 0$.\n        $2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d + 1^3(1 - 1) = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1) = 0$.\n        This gives $d = 0$ or $d = -1$.\n        So, $(1, 0)$ and $(1, -1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\n    The equilibrium points in the domain $u \\geq 0$ are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Classify the equilibrium points:**\n    We compute the Jacobian matrix $J(u,d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial u'/\\partial u & \\partial u'/\\partial d \\\\ \\partial d'/\\partial u & \\partial d'/\\partial d \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $\\partial u'/\\partial u = 3u^2 - 2u$\n    $\\partial u'/\\partial d = 0$\n    $\\partial d'/\\partial u = (10u-3)d + 3u^2(u-1) + u^3 = (10u-3)d + 3u^3-3u^2+u^3 = (10u-3)d + 4u^3 - 3u^2$\n    $\\partial d'/\\partial d = 4d + 5u^2 - 3u$\n    $J(u,d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (10u-3)d + 4u^3 - 3u^2 & 4d + 5u^2 - 3u \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n    *   At $(1, 0)$: $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3-2 & 0 \\\\ 4-3 & 5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=2$. Both are positive, so $(1, 0)$ is an unstable node (source).\n\n    *   At $(1, -1)$: $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ (10-3)(-1)+4-3 & 4(-1)+5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7+1 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=-2$. Since they have opposite signs, $(1, -1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n4.  **Find the separatrix:**\n    A separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different qualitative behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are separatrices. The most significant separatrix often connects two equilibrium points (a heteroclinic orbit) or connects a saddle point to itself (a homoclinic orbit).\n    The saddle point is $(1, -1)$. Let's find its unstable manifold. The eigenvector for the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=1$ determines the direction of the unstable manifold at the saddle point.\n    $(J(1,-1) - I)v = 0 \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\implies -6v_u-3v_d=0 \\implies v_d = -2v_u$.\n    The eigenvector is proportional to $(1, -2)$. This means the unstable manifold leaves the point $(1, -1)$ with a slope of $dv_d/dv_u = -2$.\n\n5.  **Look for an invariant curve:**\n    We are looking for a special trajectory, which is often a simple curve. Let's test if a simple polynomial curve of the form $d=f(u)$ could be an invariant manifold and act as the separatrix.\n    Let's hypothesize a trajectory connecting the saddle point $(1,-1)$ with another equilibrium point, for instance $(0,0)$.\n    Let's test the curve $d = -u^2$.\n    *   This curve passes through $(0,0)$ since $0 = -0^2$.\n    *   It passes through $(1,-1)$ since $-1 = -(1)^2$.\n    *   The slope of this curve is $dd/du = -2u$. At the saddle point $(u=1)$, the slope is $-2(1)=-2$. This matches the direction of the unstable manifold.\n    This strongly suggests that $d=-u^2$ could be the equation of the unstable manifold leaving $(1,-1)$.\n\n6.  **Verify that $d=-u^2$ is an invariant manifold:**\n    If $d(t) = -u(t)^2$, then by the chain rule, $d'(t) = -2u(t) u'(t)$. We can substitute this and $d=-u^2$ into the first differential equation to check for consistency.\n    LHS: $d'(t) = -2u \\cdot u'(t) = -2u \\cdot (u^2(u-1)) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n    RHS: $d'(t) = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^3(u - 1)$\n    Substitute $d = -u^2$:\n    RHS = $2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) + u^4 - u^3$\n         $= 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3$\n         $= (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3$\n         $= -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n    Since LHS = RHS, the equation holds for any $u(t)$ that is a solution to the second ODE. Therefore, any trajectory that starts on the curve $d=-u^2$ stays on that curve. The curve is an invariant manifold.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The curve $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold of the system. It is a trajectory that connects the saddle point $(1,-1)$ to the equilibrium point $(0,0)$. Such a connecting orbit is a separatrix. For $u \\in (0,1)$, the flow along this curve is from $(1,-1)$ to $(0,0)$ because $u' = u^2(u-1) < 0$. This curve separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. Thus, it is the separatrix we are looking for."
