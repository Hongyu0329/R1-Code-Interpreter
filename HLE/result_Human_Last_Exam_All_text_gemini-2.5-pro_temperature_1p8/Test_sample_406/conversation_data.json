    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a concept in fixed point theory, an area of mathematical analysis. To provide the conditions, we first need to clarify the definitions, as the function signatures in the question appear to contain typos when compared to the standard literature.\n\n### Analysis of the Question and Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Goal:** We need to find the conditions under which a set of three functions, F, G, and H, possess a \"tripled fixed point.\"\n\n2.  **Function Definitions and Typos:** The question defines the functions as:\n    *   `F: X * Y * Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y * X * Y → Y`\n    *   `G: Z * Y * X → Z` (The second G is likely a typo for H)\n\n    The standard definition for an **FGH-tripled fixed point**, as established in the field, uses a more symmetric set of function signatures. It's highly probable that the question intends to refer to this standard definition.\n\n3.  **Standard Definition:** Let X, Y, and Z be non-empty sets. The standard mappings are:\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × Z × X → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × X → Z` (Correction: standard is `H: Z × X × Y → Z`)\n\n    An element `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` is called an FGH-tripled fixed point if it satisfies the following system of equations:\n    *   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    *   `G(y, z, x) = y`\n    *   `H(z, x, y) = z`\n\n4.  **Mathematical Framework:** The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are typically established within the framework of **complete metric spaces**. This is a generalization of the Banach Fixed Point Theorem.\n\n5.  **Core Requirement (Contraction):** The central condition is that the triplet of functions must be \"contractive.\" This means that when you apply the functions, the distances between the resulting points are smaller than the distances between the original points, scaled by a factor less than 1. This \"shrinking\" property is what guarantees that an iterative process will converge to a single, unique fixed point.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Conditions\n\nThe conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point are laid out in what is known as the Tripled Fixed Point Theorem. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of these conditions.\n\n**Step 1: Set up the Space**\nFor the theorem to apply, the sets X, Y, and Z must be metric spaces. For simplicity and as is common in the standard theorem, we assume they are the same non-empty set, denoted as `(S, d)`, where `S` is the set and `d` is a distance function (a metric).\n*   **Condition on the Space:** The metric space `(S, d)` must be **complete**. A complete metric space is one in which every Cauchy sequence of points converges to a point that is also within the space.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Mappings**\nLet `F`, `G`, and `H` be three mappings, each from the product space `S × S × S` into `S`.\n*   `F: S × S × S → S`\n*   `G: S × S × S → S`\n*   `H: S × S × S → S`\n\n**Step 3: State the Contractive Condition**\nThis is the most critical condition. It ensures the \"shrinking\" property necessary for convergence to a fixed point.\n*   **Condition on the Mappings:** There must exist three non-negative constants `α, β, γ` such that their sum is less than 1 (i.e., `α + β + γ < 1`), and for any two triples of points `(x, y, z)` and `(u, v, w)` from `S`, the following set of inequalities holds:\n\n    1.  `d(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ α d(x, u) + β d(y, v) + γ d(z, w)`\n    2.  `d(G(y, z, x), G(v, w, u)) ≤ α d(y, v) + β d(z, w) + γ d(x, u)`\n    3.  `d(H(z, x, y), H(w, u, v)) ≤ α d(z, w) + β d(x, u) + γ d(y, v)`\n\n    This condition links the distance between the outputs of the functions to the distances between their inputs. The factor `α + β + γ < 1` ensures that the overall mapping is a contraction.\n\n**Step 4: The Consequence**\nIf the conditions from Step 1 and Step 3 are met, the theorem guarantees the following conclusion.\n*   **Conclusion:** There exists a **unique** triple of points `(x*, y*, z*) ∈ S × S × S` such that:\n    *   `F(x*, y*, z*) = x*`\n    *   `G(y*, z*, x*) = y*`\n    *   `H(z*, x*, y*) = z*`\n\nThis unique triple `(x*, y*, z*)` is the FGH-tripled fixed point of the mappings.\n\n<<<The conditions for functions `F, G, H` (mapping a product of spaces `X, Y, Z` to `X, Y, Z` respectively) to have an FGH-tripled fixed point are typically given by a theorem in the setting of metric spaces. Assuming `X=Y=Z=S` and adopting the standard definition of the FGH-tripled fixed point, the primary conditions are:\n\n1.  **Complete Metric Space:** The set `S` must be a **complete metric space** with respect to a distance function `d`. This ensures that sequences that \"should\" converge actually have a limit within the space.\n\n2.  **Contractive Condition:** The functions `F, G, H: S × S × S → S` must collectively satisfy a mixed contractive condition. This means there exist non-negative constants `α, β, γ` such that `α + β + γ < 1`, and for any two sets of points `(x, y, z)` and `(u, v, w)` in `S`, the following inequalities must all be true:\n    *   `d(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ α d(x, u) + β d(y, v) + γ d(z, w)`\n    *   `d(G(y, z, x), G(v, w, u)) ≤ α d(y, v) + β d(z, w) + γ d(x, u)`\n    *   `d(H(z, x, y), H(w, u, v)) ≤ α d(z, w) + β d(x, u) + γ d(y, v)`\n\nIf these two conditions are met, then there is guaranteed to be one and only one triple `(x*, y*, z*)` in `S` that is an FGH-tripled fixed point, satisfying `F(x*, y*, z*) = x*`, `G(y*, z*, x*) = y*`, and `H(z*, x*, y*) = z*`.>>>"
