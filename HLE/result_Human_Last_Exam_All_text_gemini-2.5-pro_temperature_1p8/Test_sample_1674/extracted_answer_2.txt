Yes, the theory that the system is reversible in the described manner does not hold if a birefringent medium is added. The birefringent element couples the polarization and spatial degrees of freedom of the light beam. The original reversal theory only accounts for inverting the spatial transformations (free-space propagation and the random medium) and is inherently blind to changes in polarization. Since the birefringent plate alters the polarization state, a simple spatial-only reversal cannot restore the initial state of the beam (which had a specific, pure polarization). A full reversal would require knowledge of the birefringent element's properties and the application of an additional polarization-reversing operation, which is not part of the posited theory.
