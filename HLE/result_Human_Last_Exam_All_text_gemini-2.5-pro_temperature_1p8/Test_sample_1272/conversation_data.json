    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Historical Context:** The question refers to the military campaigns of Ming Dynasty General Mu Sheng (沐晟) in Vietnam. This primarily relates to the Lam Sơn uprising (1418–1427), led by Lê Lợi, against the Fourth Era of Ming Domination in Vietnam.\n\n2.  **Pinpoint Mu Sheng's Major Campaigns and Defeats:** Mu Sheng was involved in multiple campaigns in Vietnam. His most critical involvement came during the final phase of the Lam Sơn Uprising. In 1427, the Ming Emperor sent two large reinforcement armies to save the besieged Ming forces in Đông Quan (modern-day Hanoi).\n    *   One army, led by Liu Sheng (柳升), advanced from Guangxi.\n    *   The second army, led by Mu Sheng, advanced from Yunnan.\n\n3.  **Identify the Specific \"First Major Defeat\":**\n    *   Liu Sheng's army was ambushed and annihilated in the Battle of Chi Lăng Pass. This was a catastrophic defeat for the Ming, but it was Liu Sheng's defeat, not Mu Sheng's.\n    *   Upon hearing the news of Liu Sheng's complete destruction, Mu Sheng's army, which was advancing along the Thao River (the upper section of the Red River), lost its will to fight.\n    *   Sensing the panic and hesitation in Mu Sheng's ranks, the Vietnamese forces, under the command of generals like Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, seized the opportunity to attack.\n    *   Mu Sheng's army was decisively defeated in a series of engagements at Lãnh Câu (冷溝) and Đan Xá (丹舍). His forces were routed, and he was forced into a panicked retreat back to Yunnan, abandoning vast amounts of supplies and equipment. This was a clear, major defeat and his most significant one during this war. Given that his earlier campaigns in the war did not result in such a rout, this is considered his first major defeat of the conflict.\n\n4.  **Locate the Battlefield on a Modern Map:**\n    *   The battles of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá took place along Mu Sheng's line of advance and retreat, which followed the Thao River in what was then the historical region of Quy Hóa.\n    *   Historical and geographical analysis of the Lam Sơn Uprising campaign maps place these locations within the territory of what is now **Phú Thọ Province**. This province lies in the northeastern region of Vietnam and is traversed by the Thao River.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Distinguishing between commanders:** It's crucial not to confuse Mu Sheng's defeat with the more famous defeat of Liu Sheng at Chi Lăng Pass, which happened just before and triggered Mu Sheng's retreat.\n*   **Defining \"major defeat\":** Mu Sheng had faced setbacks before, but the rout at Lãnh Câu-Đan Xá in 1427 was his first unequivocal and large-scale battlefield disaster during this war.\n*   **Historical vs. Modern Geography:** The names of administrative regions have changed over centuries. The battlefield locations (Lãnh Câu, Đan Xá) in the historical territory of Quy Hóa must be mapped to their corresponding modern province. Research confirms this area is now Phú Thọ Province.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nThe current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat at the battles of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá in 1427 is Phú Thọ Province.\n\n<<<Phú Thọ Province>>>"
