    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the type of the differential equation.**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nWe can rewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1) \\cdot x^2 $$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation. We can see that the variables $x$ and $t$ can be separated. The terms involving $x$ (i.e., $dx$ and $x^2$) can be moved to one side of the equation, and the terms involving $t$ (i.e., $dt$ and $(t-1)$) can be moved to the other side. Therefore, this is a separable differential equation.\n\n**2. Separate the variables.**\nTo separate the variables, we divide both sides by $x^2$ and multiply both sides by $dt$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt $$\n**Careful point:** Division by $x^2$ assumes that $x(t) \\neq 0$. We can check if $x(t) = 0$ is a solution to the differential equation. If $x(t)=0$, then $x'(t)=0$. The right side of the equation becomes $(t-1) \\cdot 0^2 = 0$. Since $0=0$, $x(t)=0$ is a constant (or equilibrium) solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, which is not zero. Therefore, the solution we are looking for is not the constant solution $x(t)=0$, and our division by $x^2$ is justified.\n\n**3. Integrate both sides.**\nNow, we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nLet's compute each integral:\n*   **Left-hand side:** The integral of $\\frac{1}{x^2}$ is $\\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$.\n*   **Right-hand side:** The integral of $(t-1)$ is $\\int t dt - \\int 1 dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$.\n\nCombining these results, we get the general solution in implicit form. We only need one constant of integration, which we will call $C$:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n**4. Use the initial condition to find the constant of integration, C.**\nThe initial condition is given as $x(0)=-8$. This means that when $t=0$, $x=-8$. We substitute these values into our equation:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C $$\n$$ C = \\frac{1}{8} $$\n**Careful point:** Pay close attention to the signs. The left side is $-\\frac{1}{-8}$, which simplifies to $+\\frac{1}{8}$.\n\n**5. Write the particular solution.**\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into our integrated equation:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**6. Find the value of x(1).**\nThe question asks for the value of $x(1)$. We can find this by substituting $t=1$ into our particular solution:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{(1)^2}{2} - (1) + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo simplify the right-hand side, we find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8} $$\nNow, we can solve for $x(1)$. Multiply both sides by -1:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nFinally, take the reciprocal of both sides to find $x(1)$:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\n*Alternative Step 6: Find the explicit solution for x(t) first.*\nFrom the particular solution $-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}$, we can solve for $x(t)$.\nMultiply by -1:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x} = - \\left( \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} \\right) = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTake the reciprocal:\n$$ x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\nNow, substitute $t=1$:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1^2}{2} + 1 - \\frac{1}{8}} = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{2} + 1 - \\frac{1}{8}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\nUsing a common denominator of 8 in the denominator:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{1}{8}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{8}} = \\frac{8}{3} $$\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe final answer is $8/3$.\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
