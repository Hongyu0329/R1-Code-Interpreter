    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6.\n\n**Step 1: Factorize the conductor N**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the character**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\n$\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\chi_{9} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$,\nwhere $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a character modulo $p^a$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the primitivity condition**\n\nA character $\\chi$ is primitive with conductor $N = \\prod p_i^{a_i}$ if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_{p_i^{a_i}}$ is primitive with conductor $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\nLet's analyze the primitivity condition for each component:\n*   **Modulo $4 = 2^2$**: The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(4)=2$. It contains the principal character (order 1, conductor 1) and one character of order 2. For $\\chi_4$ to be primitive, it cannot be induced from a character of a smaller modulus (like 2 or 1). The only non-primitive character is the principal character. Thus, $\\chi_4$ must be the character of order 2. There is **1** such character.\n*   **Modulo $9 = 3^2$**: The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. A character modulo 9 is primitive if it is not induced from a character modulo 3. The characters induced from modulo 3 are those whose order divides $\\phi(3)=2$. So, for $\\chi_9$ to be primitive, its order cannot be 1 or 2. In a cyclic group of order 6, the possible orders are 1, 2, 3, 6. Thus, $\\chi_9$ must have order 3 or 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 2 + 2 = \\mathbf{4}$.\n*   **Modulo $p$ (a prime)**: For a prime modulus $p$, a character is primitive if and only if it is not the principal character.\n    *   **Modulo 7**: $\\chi_7$ must be a non-principal character. The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(7)-1 = 5$. The orders of these characters are 2, 3, or 6. Number of characters: $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2 = \\mathbf{5}$.\n    *   **Modulo 11**: $\\chi_{11}$ must be a non-principal character. Number of primitive characters is $\\phi(11)-1 = 10$.\n    *   **Modulo 13**: $\\chi_{13}$ must be a non-principal character. Number of primitive characters is $\\phi(13)-1 = 12$.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the order condition**\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\nThis implies that the order of each component character must divide 6. Let's see how this constrains our choices.\n\n*   **For $\\chi_4$**: Must be primitive, so order is 2. Since $2|6$, this is consistent. We have **1** choice for $\\chi_4$.\n*   **For $\\chi_9$**: Must be primitive, so order is 3 or 6. Both divide 6. We have **4** choices for $\\chi_9$.\n*   **For $\\chi_7$**: Must be primitive. The order of any character modulo 7 divides $\\phi(7)=6$. So any of the 5 primitive characters are valid choices. We have **5** choices for $\\chi_7$.\n*   **For $\\chi_{11}$**: Must be primitive (non-principal). Its order must divide $\\phi(11)=10$ and must also divide 6. So, its order must divide $\\gcd(10, 6) = 2$. Since it's non-principal, its order must be 2. The number of characters of order 2 in a cyclic group of order 10 is $\\phi(2)=1$. We have **1** choice for $\\chi_{11}$.\n*   **For $\\chi_{13}$**: Must be primitive (non-principal). Its order must divide $\\phi(13)=12$ and must also divide 6. So, its order must divide $\\gcd(12, 6) = 6$. Since it's non-principal, its order can be 2, 3, or 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2 = \\mathbf{5}$.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the lcm is exactly 6 and calculate the total count**\n\nWe need to check if the lcm of the orders is guaranteed to be 6 for any combination of the allowed characters.\nLet the orders be $(k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13})$.\n*   The possible orders are: $k_4=2$; $k_9 \\in \\{3,6\\}$; $k_7 \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$; $k_{11}=2$; $k_{13} \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$.\n*   Let $L = \\text{lcm}(k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13})$.\n*   Since $k_4=2$, the lcm $L$ must be divisible by 2.\n*   Since $k_9$ is either 3 or 6, the lcm $L$ must be divisible by 3.\n*   Since $L$ is divisible by both 2 and 3, it must be divisible by $\\text{lcm}(2,3)=6$.\n*   Since every component order $k_i$ divides 6, their lcm must also divide 6.\n*   So, we have $6|L$ and $L|6$, which means $L=6$ for any combination of our selected characters.\n\nTherefore, any combination of the valid primitive component characters (whose orders divide 6) will result in a character of order exactly 6. The total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component.\n\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1 (order 2)\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_9$: 4 (orders 3, 6)\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_7$: 5 (orders 2, 3, 6)\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1 (order 2)\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: 5 (orders 2, 3, 6)\n\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$."
