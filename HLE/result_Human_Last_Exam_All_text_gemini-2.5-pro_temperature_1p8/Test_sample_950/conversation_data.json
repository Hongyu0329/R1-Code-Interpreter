    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Space:** The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $Gr(3, 5)$ or $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. This is a compact, smooth manifold of dimension $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Mathematical Object:** We are asked to analyze the integral cohomology ring, $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$. This is a graded ring, which is also an abelian group under addition. The question focuses on its **torsion subgroup**, which we'll denote by $T$. The torsion subgroup of the entire ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of the cohomology group in each degree:\n    $T = T(H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})) = \\bigoplus_{i \\ge 0} T(H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n\n3.  **Define the \"Rank\" of an Abelian Group:** The central part of the question is to find the **rank** of the abelian group $T$. In the context of abelian groups (or modules over a principal ideal domain like $\\mathbb{Z}$), the term \"rank\" has a standard, precise definition:\n    *   The rank of an abelian group $A$ is the dimension of the vector space $A \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   Alternatively, for a finitely generated abelian group, the Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups states that $A$ is isomorphic to a direct sum $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^r \\oplus T_{finite}$, where $T_{finite}$ is a finite abelian group (the torsion subgroup of $A$). The integer $r$ is the rank of $A$. It represents the number of independent generators of infinite order.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Properties of the Group in Question:** The group whose rank we need to find is $T = T(H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}))$. By its very definition, this is the subgroup consisting of all elements of finite order under the group operation (addition). Therefore, $T$ is a **torsion group**. This means for any element $t \\in T$, there exists a non-zero integer $n$ such that $nt = 0$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Rank of a Torsion Group:** Let's apply the definition of rank to our group $T$. Since $T$ is a torsion group, for any element $t \\in T$, there is a non-zero integer $n_t$ such that $n_t t = 0$. Consider the tensor product $T \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$. Any element in this tensor product is a finite sum of simple tensors of the form $t \\otimes q$, where $t \\in T$ and $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    For any such simple tensor, we can write:\n    $t \\otimes q = t \\otimes \\frac{n_t q}{n_t} = (n_t t) \\otimes \\frac{q}{n_t} = 0 \\otimes \\frac{q}{n_t} = 0$.\n    Since every generator of $T \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$ is zero, the entire group is the zero group: $T \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q} = \\{0\\}$.\n    The dimension of the zero vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is 0.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The rank of the torsion subgroup $T$ is 0.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Rank\":** In some contexts, particularly for finite groups, \"rank\" might informally refer to the minimum number of generators. For instance, the \"p-rank\" of a group is the dimension of its elementary abelian p-subgroup. If the question intended this, we would need to compute the full structure of the torsion subgroup. Based on modern calculations (e.g., by J. Korba≈°), the torsion subgroup of $H^*(Gr(3,5);\\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^5$, which has a 2-rank of 5. However, the term \"rank\" without any qualifiers (like \"p-rank\") has the standard meaning given in Step 3.\n\n*   **Is the torsion subgroup non-trivial?** A detailed calculation, while not necessary for the final answer, would show that the torsion subgroup is indeed non-trivial. For example, $H^2(Gr(3,5);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$. The fact that the torsion is non-zero might seem to suggest a non-zero rank, but this is a confusion between the group being non-trivial and its rank being non-zero. A non-trivial group can have a rank of 0 if it is a torsion group.\n\n*   **\"Red Herring\":** The complexity of the space $Gr(3,5)$ and its cohomology is a \"red herring\". The answer relies solely on the definition of \"rank\" and the properties of a \"torsion subgroup\", not on the specific structure of this particular group. The logical path is short and direct, bypassing a complicated calculation.\n\nThe question is a test of understanding fundamental algebraic definitions in the context of algebraic topology. The rank of any torsion group is, by definition, zero.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is, by definition, a torsion group. The rank of any torsion abelian group is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
