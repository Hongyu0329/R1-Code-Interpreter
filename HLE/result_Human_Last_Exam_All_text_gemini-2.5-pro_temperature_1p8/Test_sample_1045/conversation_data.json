    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecule\n*   **Molecule:** Toluene\n*   **Chemical Formula:** C7H8\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   7 Carbon (C) atoms\n    *   8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the 6-31G Basis Set\nThe notation \"6-31G\" describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs). We need to understand what this means for each type of atom in the molecule (Carbon and Hydrogen).\n\n*   **For heavy atoms (non-hydrogen atoms) like Carbon:**\n    *   **Core Orbitals (1s):** The '6' indicates that the core 1s orbital is described by a single contracted Gaussian function, which is a fixed linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs). This contributes **1 CGF**.\n    *   **Valence Orbitals (2s, 2p):** The valence shell is \"split\" into two parts, as indicated by '31'. This means each valence atomic orbital is represented by two basis functions.\n        *   **Inner Valence (2s, 2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z):** The '3' means the inner part is described by one set of CGFs. Each CGF in this set is a combination of 3 PGFs. Since there is one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals, this part contributes 1 (for s) + 3 (for p) = **4 CGFs**.\n        *   **Outer Valence (2s, 2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z):** The '1' means the outer part is described by a second set of CGFs. Each CGF in this set is composed of just a single PGF (it is uncontracted). This also contributes 1 (for s) + 3 (for p) = **4 CGFs**.\n    *   **Total CGFs for one Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 CGFs**.\n\n*   **For Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   **Core Orbitals:** Hydrogen has no core electrons. The notation applies only to its valence 1s orbital.\n    *   **Valence Orbital (1s):** The '31' splitting is applied to the 1s orbital.\n        *   **Inner Valence:** The '3' indicates the inner part of the 1s orbital is represented by one CGF (built from 3 PGFs). This contributes **1 CGF**.\n        *   **Outer Valence:** The '1' indicates the outer part of the 1s orbital is represented by another CGF (built from 1 PGF). This contributes **1 CGF**.\n    *   **Total CGFs for one Hydrogen atom:** 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 CGFs**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of CGFs for Toluene (C7H8)\nNow, we combine the information from the previous steps.\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon:**\n    *   Number of C atoms = 7\n    *   Number of CGFs per C atom = 9\n    *   Total CGFs from Carbon = 7 atoms * 9 CGFs/atom = **63 CGFs**\n\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen:**\n    *   Number of H atoms = 8\n    *   Number of CGFs per H atom = 2\n    *   Total CGFs from Hydrogen = 8 atoms * 2 CGFs/atom = **16 CGFs**\n\n*   **Total for the molecule:**\n    *   Total CGFs = (Total from Carbon) + (Total from Hydrogen)\n    *   Total CGFs = 63 + 16 = **79**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Molecule Identification:** Correctly identify the chemical formula for toluene (C7H8). A common mistake could be miscounting atoms, especially in a ring structure with a substituent.\n*   **Basis Set Interpretation:** Understand that the notation (X-YZG) applies differently to core vs. valence electrons and to hydrogen vs. heavier atoms.\n*   **Distinguish CGFs from PGFs:** The question specifically asks for *contracted* functions (also known as basis functions), not the underlying *primitive* functions.\n*   **Orbital Count:** Remember that for second-row atoms, the p-shell consists of three orbitals (p_x, p_y, p_z), which must all be accounted for in the valence shell calculation.\n\n<<<79>>>"
