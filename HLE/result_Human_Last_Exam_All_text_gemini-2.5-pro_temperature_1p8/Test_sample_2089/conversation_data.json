    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\nThe question asks for the title of a specific film with several key identifying elements:\n1.  The film must be Oscar-nominated.\n2.  A character in the film \"seals his fate.\" This implies a negative outcome, such as capture or death, as a direct result of their action.\n3.  The specific fatal action is saying the words \"Thank you.\"\n4.  The context for this action is the character boarding a bus.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Film and Scene\nThe scene described occurs in the 2015 film **Sicario**, directed by Denis Villeneuve.\n\n*   **The Character:** The character is Silvio (played by Maximiliano Hernández). He is a corrupt Sonora state police officer in Mexico who also works for the drug cartel.\n*   **The Context:** The scene is the infamous Juarez border-crossing sequence. A US special operations team, including Alejandro Gillick (Benicio Del Toro) and Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), is stuck in a traffic jam at the border checkpoint. They are escorting a high-value cartel member back to the US. They are ambushed by cartel gunmen, leading to a brutal and intense firefight in the middle of civilian traffic.\n*   **The Fatal Action:** During the chaos, Silvio, who was one of the cartel men in the convoy, escapes his vehicle. He sheds his tactical gear and, still in his police uniform, attempts to blend in with panicked civilians who are being evacuated onto a bus. As he calmly steps onto the bus, he instinctively says **\"Gracias\"** (Spanish for \"Thank you\") to the person who makes way for him.\n*   **Sealing His Fate:** Alejandro, the ruthless assassin working with the US team, is scanning the crowd for any surviving hostiles. A regular civilian would be terrified and scrambling, not calmly and politely boarding a bus. Silvio's composed demeanor and his polite \"Gracias\" make him stand out to the hyper-vigilant Alejandro as someone trained and disciplined, not a panicked civilian. This act of courtesy flags him as an enemy combatant trying to escape. Alejandro immediately identifies him, walks onto the bus, and kills him without a word.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the \"Oscar-Nominated\" Criteria\nTo confirm this is the correct answer, we must check if *Sicario* was nominated for any Academy Awards. The film received three Oscar nominations at the 88th Academy Awards:\n*   Best Cinematography (Roger Deakins)\n*   Best Original Score (Jóhann Jóhannsson)\n*   Best Sound Editing\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Final Answer\nThe analysis confirms that *Sicario* fits every detail of the question. A character (Silvio) seals his fate (he is identified and killed) because he says \"Gracias\" (\"Thank you\") while boarding a bus, and the film is Oscar-nominated.\n\n<<<Sicario>>>"
