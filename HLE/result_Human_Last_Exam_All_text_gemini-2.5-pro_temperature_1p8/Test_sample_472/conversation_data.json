    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Meter:** The line is from the Roman comedian Plautus. His plays are typically written in an **iambic senarius** (also called an iambic trimeter), which consists of six iambic (S L) feet. This meter allows for frequent substitutions, making it flexible and speech-like. Common substitutions for an iamb (S L) include a spondee (L L), anapest (S S L), dactyl (L S S), or tribrach (S S S).\n\n2.  **Identify Careful Points and Prosodic Rules:**\n    *   **Long by Position:** A syllable is long if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants, or a double consonant (x, z), even across word boundaries.\n    *   **Natural Quantity:** Vowels can be naturally long (marked with a macron, e.g., ā) or short. Diphthongs (ae, oe, au, etc.) are always long.\n    *   **Iambic Shortening (*Brevis Brevians*):** This is a critical rule in early Latin comedy. A short syllable followed by a long syllable (an iamb, S L) can be \"shortened\" to a pyrrhic (S S) if the iambic word is unstressed. Words like `tibi`, `bene`, `sibi`, and `male` are classic candidates for this rule.\n    *   **Syllaba Anceps:** The very last syllable of the line can be metrically either long or short, but it is scanned to fit the required pattern (usually as the final long of an iamb).\n    *   **Feet and Word Breaks:** The metrical feet do not need to align with word boundaries. A foot can end in the middle of a word, or a word can be split across two feet.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Syllable's Quantity:**\n\n    *   `et`: The `e` is followed by `t` and the `t` of `tibi`. It is **long (L)** by position.\n    *   `tibi`: Normally scanned as an iamb (S L), but due to iambic shortening, it is scanned as a pyrrhic (**S S**).\n    *   `bene`: Another candidate for iambic shortening. It is scanned as a pyrrhic (**S S**).\n    *   `esse`: `es-` is followed by a double `s`, so it's **long (L)** by position. `-se` has a short `e`, so it's **short (S)**.\n    *   `soli`: The `o` in *sōlus* is naturally long, and the dative ending `i` is also naturally long. So, **L L**.\n    *   `quom`: This is an archaic form of `cum` and is treated as **long (L)**.\n    *   `sibi`: Like `tibi`, this is shortened to a pyrrhic (**S S**).\n    *   `sit`: The `i` is followed by `t` and the `m` of `male`. It is **long (L)** by position.\n    *   `male`: The `ma-` has a short `a` (**S**). The final `-le` is the *syllaba anceps*. To fit the meter's final iambic foot, it is scanned as **long (L)**.\n\n4.  **Group Syllables into Six Feet:**\n\n    The full sequence of quantities is: `L S S S S L S L L L S S L S L`\n    We group these into six valid metrical feet.\n\n    *   **Foot 1:** `et ti bi` → **L S S**\n        This forms a **dactyl**, a valid substitution for an iamb. The resolution `S S` comes from the shortened `tibi`.\n\n    *   **Foot 2:** `be ne es-` → **S S L**\n        This forms an **anapest**, a valid substitution. The resolution `S S` comes from `bene`. The foot ends on the first syllable of `esse`.\n\n    *   **Foot 3:** `-se so-` → **S L**\n        This is a perfect **iamb**. It is formed from the second syllable of `esse` and the first syllable of `soli`.\n\n    *   **Foot 4:** `-li quom` → **L L**\n        This is a **spondee**, a valid substitution. It is formed from the second syllable of `soli` and the word `quom`.\n\n    *   **Foot 5:** `si bi sit` → **S S L**\n        This is another **anapest**. The resolution `S S` comes from `sibi`.\n\n    *   **Foot 6:** `ma le` → **S L**\n        This is a perfect **iamb**, with the final syllable `-le` scanned as long (*syllaba anceps*).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final scansion, with each foot separated by a space, is as follows.\n\n<<<L S S S S L S L L L S S L S L>>>"
