    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ in $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Theory and Renormalization Group Setup\nThe theory in question is the scalar $\\phi^4$ theory. The Euclidean action in $d$ dimensions is given by:\n$S = \\int d^d x \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}r_0 \\phi^2 + \\frac{u_0}{4!} \\phi^4 \\right]$\nHere, $\\phi$ is a single-component scalar field, $r_0$ is the bare mass parameter, and $u_0$ is the bare coupling constant.\n\nWe analyze the theory near the critical dimension $d=4$. Let $d=4-\\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive parameter.\nFrom dimensional analysis, the action $S$ must be dimensionless. In units where $\\hbar=1, c=1$, length has mass dimension -1, so $[d^d x] = -d$. The kinetic term $\\int d^dx (\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2$ implies that the scalar field has mass dimension $[\\phi] = (d-2)/2$. For the interaction term $\\int d^d x \\, u_0 \\phi^4$ to be dimensionless, the coupling $u_0$ must have mass dimension $[u_0] = d - 4[\\phi] = d - 4(d-2)/2 = d - 2(d-2) = 4-d = \\epsilon$.\n\nSince $u_0$ is not dimensionless, it is convenient to introduce a dimensionless coupling constant, let's call it $u$, by factoring out an arbitrary momentum scale $\\mu$:\n$u_0 = u \\mu^\\epsilon$\nThe renormalization group (RG) approach studies how the effective coupling $u$ changes with the scale $\\mu$. This change is described by the beta function, $\\beta(u) = \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu}$.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Beta Function\nThe beta function can be calculated using perturbative quantum field theory. It consists of two parts: the classical (or engineering) part and the quantum correction part.\n$u_0$ is a bare parameter and does not depend on our choice of scale $\\mu$. Therefore, $\\mu \\frac{du_0}{d\\mu} = 0$.\nDifferentiating $u_0 = u \\mu^\\epsilon$ with respect to $\\mu$ gives:\n$0 = \\mu \\frac{d}{d\\mu} (u \\mu^\\epsilon) = (\\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu})\\mu^\\epsilon + u(\\epsilon \\mu^{\\epsilon-1})\\mu = \\beta(u) \\mu^\\epsilon + \\epsilon u \\mu^\\epsilon$\n$\\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + (\\text{quantum corrections})$\n\nThe quantum corrections arise from loop diagrams. For the $\\phi^4$ theory, we need to compute the one-loop correction to the four-point vertex. There are three one-loop diagrams (the s, t, and u channels), which are topologically identical.\n\nThe standard calculation using the minimal subtraction (MS) scheme in dimensional regularization yields the following result for the beta function to one-loop order:\n$\\beta(u) = \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu} = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3 u^2}{16\\pi^2} + O(u^3)$\n\n**Careful points in the derivation of the beta function:**\n*   **Normalization of the coupling:** The interaction term is taken to be $\\frac{u_0}{4!} \\phi^4$. Different normalizations (e.g., $\\frac{g}{4}\\phi^4$) would change the combinatorial factors and thus the coefficient of the $u^2$ term. The choice $\\frac{u}{4!}\\phi^4$ corresponds to a Feynman rule for the vertex of just $-u$.\n*   **Loop calculation:** The calculation involves evaluating a momentum loop integral. The total contribution comes from three diagrams, leading to a factor of 3. Each diagram also has a symmetry factor of $1/2$.\n*   **Dimensional regularization:** Using $d=4-\\epsilon$ regularizes the ultraviolet divergence of the loop integral, turning it into a pole of the form $1/\\epsilon$.\n*   **Scheme dependence:** The exact form of the beta function beyond the first two terms can depend on the renormalization scheme. However, the first two terms, which determine the leading order behavior of the fixed point, are universal for a wide class of mass-independent schemes. The coefficient $\\frac{3}{16\\pi^2}$ is standard for the given normalization.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Fixed Point\nA fixed point of the renormalization group flow, denoted by $u^*$, is a value of the coupling where the beta function vanishes:\n$\\beta(u^*) = 0$\nSubstituting the expression for the beta function:\n$-\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3(u^*)^2}{16\\pi^2} = 0$\n\nThis equation has two solutions for $u^*$:\n1.  $u^*_G = 0$. This is the **Gaussian fixed point**. It corresponds to a free, non-interacting theory.\n2.  The non-trivial solution is found by factoring out $u^*$:\n    $u^* \\left( -\\epsilon + \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} \\right) = 0$\n    Assuming $u^* \\neq 0$, we solve the expression in the parenthesis:\n    $-\\epsilon + \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = 0$\n    $\\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = \\epsilon$\n\nSolving for $u^*$ gives:\n$u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} \\epsilon$\nThis is the **Wilson-Fisher fixed point**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\nThe calculation was performed to the lowest non-trivial order in both the coupling constant $u$ and the parameter $\\epsilon$. The result $u^* \\propto \\epsilon$ shows that for small $\\epsilon$, the fixed point coupling is also small, which self-consistently justifies the use of one-loop perturbation theory. Therefore, this is the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling.\n\nThe leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ in terms of $\\epsilon$ is $\\frac{16\\pi^2}{3}\\epsilon$.\n\n<<<>>>\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{16\\pi^2}{3}\\epsilon}$."
