    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key figure:** The question centers on a specific individual, Andre Vernault.\n2.  **Establish the context:** The time is World War II, and the location is the UK.\n3.  **Understand the situation:** Vernault, a Belgian refugee, is being interrogated by British counterintelligence (MI5).\n4.  **Identify the problem:** MI5 falsely believes he is a German spy.\n5.  **Determine the cause of the false belief:** Vernault concealed his true profession from his interrogators.\n6.  **State the objective:** The goal is to identify what this concealed profession was.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   The core of the problem lies in the interpretation of Vernault's secrecy. In a high-stakes counterintelligence environment, any form of concealment or dishonesty is a major red flag and often presumed to be evidence of espionage training.\n*   Vernault's motivation for hiding his profession was personal, not political or military. He was not a spy.\n*   The profession in question must be something that a man in the 1940s might feel a sense of shame or embarrassment about, especially in the hyper-masculine context of a world war.\n*   This case is a classic example of how intelligence agencies can be led astray by incorrect assumptions and how innocent individuals can get caught up in the net of counter-espionage.\n\n**Acquiring the final answer through step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  Historical accounts of MI5's work during World War II, particularly those detailing the \"Double-Cross System\" (the effort to turn captured German spies into double agents), mention the case of Andre Vernault.\n2.  Sources, such as the book \"Double Cross: The True Story of the D-Day Spies\" by Ben Macintyre, detail this specific incident.\n3.  According to these records, Andre Vernault arrived in Britain and was routinely interrogated as a refugee. His evasiveness about his past, specifically his refusal to state his profession, immediately aroused suspicion.\n4.  The interrogators, trained to look for spies, concluded that his secrecy was a sign of a cover story and that he must be an enemy agent.\n5.  After prolonged interrogation and investigation, the truth was finally revealed. Vernault was not a spy. He was a **hairdresser**.\n6.  He was deeply embarrassed by his profession, considering it \"unmanly\" and fearing the ridicule of the British military men interrogating him during a time of war. This personal shame was the sole reason for his concealment, which was misinterpreted as espionage.\n\n<<<hairdresser>>>"
