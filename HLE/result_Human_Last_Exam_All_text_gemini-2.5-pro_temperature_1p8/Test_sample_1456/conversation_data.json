    "This is an advanced question in topology, specifically in the area of continuum theory. Let's break down the problem methodically.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the core definitions**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[0,1]`, a circle `S^1`, a closed disk `D^2`, and more exotic spaces like the topologist's sine curve (closure) or the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that is not a single point. This is a crucial condition. If a continuum `Y` were a single point `{p}`, then `X x Y` would be homeomorphic to `X`, and the problem would be about the number of composants of a single continuum. The \"nondegenerate\" condition ensures both spaces `X` and `Y` have some \"substance\".\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, its composant, `Comp(p)`, is the set of all points `q` in `X` such that there exists a *proper subcontinuum* of `X` containing both `p` and `q`. A subcontinuum is a closed, connected subset. A proper subcontinuum is one that is not equal to the entire space `X`.\n    *   All composants of a continuum partition the space.\n    *   Each composant is a dense subset of the continuum *if* there is more than one composant.\n*   **Product of two continua:** Given two continua `X` and `Y`, their product `X x Y` is the Cartesian product with the product topology. The product of two continua is also a continuum.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the number of composants for a single continuum**\n\nThe number of composants a nondegenerate continuum can have varies greatly.\n*   **One Composant:** If a continuum is *decomposable* (can be written as the union of two proper subcontinua), it often has only one composant. For example, the interval `[0,1]`, a disk, or a sphere each has exactly one composant. The entire space is one big composant.\n*   **Finitely many Composants:** It is possible to construct continua with any finite number of composants `n >= 2`.\n*   **Countably infinitely many Composants:** It is possible to construct continua with `ℵ_0` (countably infinite) composants.\n*   **Uncountably many Composants:** A continuum is called *indecomposable* if it cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua. A key theorem states that a nondegenerate continuum `X` is indecomposable if and only if it has uncountably many composants. The number of composants in this case is `c` (or `mathfrak{c}`), the cardinality of the continuum (`|ℝ| = 2^ℵ_0`). Each composant is a dense, path-connected, but non-locally-connected subset. The pseudo-arc is a famous example of an indecomposable continuum.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The maximum number of composants for a single nondegenerate continuum is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n**Step 3: Relating the composants of the product space to the composants of the factor spaces**\n\nThis is the most critical step. There is a fundamental theorem concerning the composants of a product space.\n\n**Theorem (Mazurkiewicz):** Let `X` and `Y` be continua. The composants of the product continuum `X x Y` are precisely the sets of the form `A x B`, where `A` is a composant of `X` and `B` is a composant of `Y`.\n\n*Let's sketch a brief justification for this theorem:*\nLet `(x, y)` be a point in `X x Y`. Let `Comp_X(x)` be the composant of `x` in `X` and `Comp_Y(y)` be the composant of `y` in `Y`. We want to show the composant of `(x, y)` in `X x Y`, denoted `Comp_{XxY}(x, y)`, is equal to `Comp_X(x) x Comp_Y(y)`.\n\n1.  `Comp_X(x) x Comp_Y(y) ⊆ Comp_{XxY}(x, y)`:\n    Take any point `(x', y')` in `Comp_X(x) x Comp_Y(y)`. By definition, there is a proper subcontinuum `K_x ⊂ X` containing `x` and `x'`, and a proper subcontinuum `K_y ⊂ Y` containing `y` and `y'`.\n    The set `K_x x {y'}` is a proper subcontinuum of `X x Y` containing `(x, y')` and `(x', y')`.\n    The set `{x} x K_y` is a proper subcontinuum of `X x Y` containing `(x, y)` and `(x, y')`.\n    The union `({x} x K_y) U (K_x x {y'})` is a continuum containing `(x, y)` and `(x', y')`. Since `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate, this union is a *proper* subcontinuum of `X x Y`. Thus, `(x', y')` is in the same composant as `(x, y)`.\n\n2.  The other direction, `Comp_{XxY}(x, y) ⊆ Comp_X(x) x Comp_Y(y)`, also holds true by considering the projections of a proper subcontinuum in `X x Y`.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The key insight is this direct correspondence. The number of composants of `X x Y` is the product of the number of composants of `X` and the number of composants of `Y`. Let `|C(Z)|` be the number (cardinality) of composants of a continuum `Z`. Then, `|C(X x Y)| = |C(X)| * |C(Y)|`, where the multiplication is cardinal multiplication.\n\n**Step 4: Maximizing the number of composants**\n\nOur goal is to find the largest possible value for `|C(X x Y)|`. Based on the formula from Step 3, we need to maximize `|C(X)|` and `|C(Y)|`.\n\nFrom Step 2, we know the maximum possible number of composants for any single nondegenerate continuum is `c` (the cardinality of the continuum). This maximum is achieved when the continuum is indecomposable.\n\nSo, to achieve the maximum for the product, we should choose both `X` and `Y` to be indecomposable continua. For example, let `X` and `Y` both be the pseudo-arc.\n\nIn this case:\n*   `|C(X)| = c`\n*   `|C(Y)| = c`\n\nThe number of composants of the product `X x Y` would be `|C(X)| * |C(Y)| = c * c`.\n\n**Step 5: Final calculation using cardinal arithmetic**\n\nWe need to compute the cardinal product `c * c`.\n\n*   `c` is defined as `2^ℵ_0`.\n*   So, `c * c = (2^ℵ_0) * (2^ℵ_0)`.\n*   By the laws of cardinal exponentiation, `a^b * a^d = a^(b+d)`.\n*   Therefore, `(2^ℵ_0) * (2^ℵ_0) = 2^(ℵ_0 + ℵ_0)`.\n*   For infinite cardinals, `κ + κ = κ`. Thus, `ℵ_0 + ℵ_0 = ℵ_0`.\n*   So, `2^(ℵ_0 + ℵ_0) = 2^ℵ_0 = c`.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Cardinal arithmetic is different from regular arithmetic. The product of two infinite sets with cardinality `c` results in a set that also has cardinality `c`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe largest possible number of composants for the product `X x Y` is achieved when both `X` and `Y` have the maximum possible number of composants (`c` each). The total number is `c * c`, which is equal to `c`. The \"number\" here is a cardinal number, specifically, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n---\nFinal Answer Acquisition:\n1.  Identify the mathematical objects: Nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y`, and their product `X x Y`.\n2.  Identify the property to be maximized: The number of composants of `X x Y`.\n3.  Relate the property of the product to the properties of the factors: The set of composants of `X x Y` is the Cartesian product of the sets of composants of `X` and `Y`. Therefore, the number of composants is `|C(X x Y)| = |C(X)| * |C(Y)|`.\n4.  Determine the maximum value for the property of a single factor: The maximum number of composants for a single continuum is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum.\n5.  Perform the maximization: To maximize the product, choose `|C(X)| = c` and `|C(Y)| = c`.\n6.  Calculate the final value: The maximum number is `c * c = c`.\n\nThe largest possible number of composants is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
