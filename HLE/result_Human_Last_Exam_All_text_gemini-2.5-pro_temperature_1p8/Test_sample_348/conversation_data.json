    "This problem requires finding the total welfare, which is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus, at the market equilibrium.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Define the Supply and Demand Functions:**\n    *   Supply: $P = S(Q_S) = \\ln(Q_S^3 - 2)$\n    *   Demand: $P = D(Q_D) = 18e^{-\\arctan(Q_D)}$\n    *   **Careful Point:** For the supply function to be defined, the argument of the natural logarithm must be positive. This means $Q_S^3 - 2 > 0$, which implies $Q_S > \\sqrt[3]{2} \\approx 1.26$.\n\n2.  **Find the Market Equilibrium:**\n    *   Equilibrium occurs when quantity supplied equals quantity demanded ($Q_S = Q_D = Q_E$) and the price is the same ($P_S = P_D = P_E$).\n    *   We set the price functions equal to each other to find the equilibrium quantity $Q_E$:\n        $\\ln(Q_E^3 - 2) = 18e^{-\\arctan(Q_E)}$\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a transcendental equation, meaning it mixes different classes of functions (logarithmic, polynomial, exponential, and trigonometric). Such equations generally do not have an analytical solution; they cannot be solved using standard algebraic manipulations. We must check for a simple integer solution or use numerical methods.\n    *   Let's test some values for Q:\n        *   If $Q = 4$:\n            *   Supply Price: $P = \\ln(4^3 - 2) = \\ln(62) \\approx 4.13$\n            *   Demand Price: $P = 18e^{-\\arctan(4)} \\approx 18e^{-1.326} \\approx 4.78$\n            *   Here, Demand Price > Supply Price.\n        *   If $Q = 5$:\n            *   Supply Price: $P = \\ln(5^3 - 2) = \\ln(123) \\approx 4.81$\n            *   Demand Price: $P = 18e^{-\\arctan(5)} \\approx 18e^{-1.373} \\approx 4.56$\n            *   Here, Supply Price > Demand Price.\n    *   Since the supply price goes from being less than the demand price at $Q=4$ to greater than the demand price at $Q=5$, the equilibrium quantity $Q_E$ must lie between 4 and 5. This confirms that there is no simple integer solution for $Q_E$.\n\n3.  **Define Total Welfare:**\n    *   Total welfare (TW) is the total surplus generated in the market. It is the area between the demand curve and the supply curve, from $Q=0$ up to the equilibrium quantity $Q_E$.\n    *   The formula for total welfare is:\n        $TW = \\int_{0}^{Q_E} [D(Q) - S(Q)] dQ$\n    *   Substituting the functions:\n        $TW = \\int_{0}^{Q_E} [18e^{-\\arctan(Q)} - \\ln(Q^3-2)] dQ$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Total Welfare Integral:**\n    *   To find the total welfare, we need to solve this definite integral. This involves finding the antiderivatives (indefinite integrals) of the demand and supply functions.\n    *   **Careful Point:**\n        *   The integral of the demand function, $\\int 18e^{-\\arctan(Q)} dQ$, is non-elementary. This means its solution cannot be expressed in terms of standard functions (polynomials, logarithms, exponential, trigonometric functions, etc.).\n        *   Similarly, the integral of the supply function, $\\int \\ln(Q^3 - 2) dQ$, is also non-elementary.\n    *   Because both parts of the integral are non-elementary and the limit of integration $Q_E$ cannot be found analytically, it is impossible to calculate the exact value of the total welfare using standard calculus techniques.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe problem as stated cannot be solved analytically. The determination of both the equilibrium point and the total welfare would require numerical approximation software. It is highly probable that the question contains typos in one or both of the functions, and a simpler, solvable problem was intended. Without knowing the intended functions, a numerical answer cannot be derived.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is impossible to provide a final numerical answer."
