    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of the Church integer `n` and then calculate `log_2(n)`.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Tools\n\nThe problem asks for the value of `log_2(n)`, where `n` is the integer represented by a given SKI combinator expression. We need to evaluate this expression to find `n`.\n\nThe fundamental rules of SKI combinator calculus are:\n*   `S x y z = x z (y z)`\n*   `K x y = x`\n*   `I x = x`\n\nChurch numerals are representations of non-negative integers as higher-order functions. The Church numeral for `n`, denoted as `c_n`, is a function that takes another function `f` and an argument `x`, and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times.\n*   `c_n f x = f(f(...f(x)...))` (n applications of f)\n*   `c_n f x = f^n(x)`\n\n### Step 2: Parse and Simplify the Expression\n\nLet's denote the given expression as `E`:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nTo solve this, we will identify and simplify common sub-expressions from the inside out.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Identifying Church Numerals `c_1` and `c_2`**\n\n*   `I`: The identity combinator `I` is the Church numeral for 1, `c_1`, because `I f x = f x = f^1(x)`.\n*   `S(I)(I)`: Let's evaluate this expression by applying it to `f` and `x`.\n    `S(I)(I) f x = S I I f x = I f (I f) x = f (f x) = f^2(x)`.\n    This matches the definition of `c_2`. So, `S(I)(I) = c_2`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Identifying the Successor Combinator `SUCC`**\n\n*   Let's analyze the sub-expression `S(S(K(S))(K))`. This is a well-known combinator for the successor function (`SUCC`) on Church numerals. `SUCC c_n = c_{n+1}`.\n*   Let's verify this. Let `B = S(KS)K` (the composition combinator, `B f g x = f(g x)`). Then `SUCC = S B`.\n    `SUCC c_n f x = (S B c_n) f x = B f (c_n f) x = f((c_n f) x)`.\n    Since `(c_n f) x = f^n(x)`, we have `SUCC c_n f x = f(f^n(x)) = f^{n+1}(x)`.\n    This confirms `S(S(K(S))(K))` is the successor combinator `SUCC`.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Simplifying the Arguments**\n\nNow we can simplify the two main arguments within the expression `E`.\n\n1.  The first argument to `K`: `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n    This is `SUCC` applied to `I`. Since `I = c_1`, this is `SUCC c_1`, which equals `c_2`.\n    So, `S(S(K(S))(K))(I) = c_2`.\n\n2.  The second main argument: `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n    This is `SUCC` applied to `S(I)(I)`. Since `S(I)(I) = c_2`, this is `SUCC c_2`, which equals `c_3`.\n    So, `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)) = c_3`.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Simplified Expression\n\nBy substituting our simplified parts back into the main expression `E`, we get:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(c_2)))(c_3))`\n\nNow, let's evaluate this simplified expression.\n\n**Careful Point 4: The `K` Combinator's Role**\n\n*   The innermost part of the expression is `(K(c_2))(c_3)`.\n*   According to the rule `K x y = x`, `K(c_2)(c_3)` evaluates to `c_2`.\n*   This means the entire `c_3` term is discarded. This is a crucial simplification.\n\nThe expression `E` is now further simplified to:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(c_2)))`\n\n### Step 4: Final Evaluation to find `n`\n\nWe need to determine what integer `n` this final form represents. We do this by applying it to `f` and `x` and seeing how many times `f` is applied to `x`.\n\nLet `E' = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(c_2)))`. We evaluate `E' f x`:\n\n1.  `E' f x = [S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(c_2)))] f x`\n    Using `S x y z = x z (y z)`, where `x=I` and `y=S(I)(S(I)(c_2))`:\n    `= I f ([S(I)(S(I)(c_2))] f) x`\n    Using `I f = f`:\n    `= f ([S(I)(S(I)(c_2))] f x)`\n\n2.  Let's evaluate the new inner part `[S(I)(S(I)(c_2))] f x`:\n    `= f (I f ([S(I)(c_2)] f) x)`\n    `= f (f ([S(I)(c_2)] f x))`\n\n3.  We repeat this for the next level:\n    `= f (f (I f (c_2 f) x))`\n    `= f (f (f (c_2 f x)))`\n\n**Careful Point 5: Final Composition**\n\nWe have reduced the expression to `f (f (f (c_2 f x)))`. We know that `c_2 f x = f^2(x)`. Substituting this in:\n\n`E' f x = f (f (f (f^2(x))))`\n\nThis is `f` applied three times to the result of `f^2(x)`.\n`E' f x = f^3(f^2(x)) = f^{3+2}(x) = f^5(x)`\n\nSince the expression `E` evaluates to `f^5(x)`, it represents the Church numeral for 5.\nTherefore, `n = 5`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer\n\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(n) = log_2(5)`\nUsing a calculator, we find the value:\n`log_2(5) â‰ˆ 2.321928`\n\nThe result is a non-integer value, as expected.\n\n<<<2.321928>>>"
