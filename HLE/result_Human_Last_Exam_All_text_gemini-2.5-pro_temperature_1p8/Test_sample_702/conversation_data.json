    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the connectivity of the map.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the spaces**\n\n*   The source space is $Y = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n*   The target space is $Z = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. Since $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\simeq S^{10}$, the target space is homotopy equivalent to $\\Omega S^{10}$.\n*   So the map is $\\phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega S^{10}$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the origin and nature of the map $\\phi$**\n\nThe description \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" suggests a canonical construction arising from standard homotopy theory fibrations. This points towards the relationship established by the Hilton-Milnor theorem and G. W. Whitehead's theorem on the homotopy type of $X \\times Y / (X \\vee Y)$.\n\nCombining these results leads to a fundamental homotopy equivalence:\n$e: \\Omega(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\to \\Omega S^{10}$\n\nLet's rewrite this with our notation for the source space $Y = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$:\n$e: \\Omega(\\Sigma Y) \\to \\Omega S^{10}$\n\nThe most natural map from $Y$ to $\\Omega S^{10}$ is constructed using this equivalence. There is a canonical map, the unit of the $(\\Sigma, \\Omega)$ adjunction, denoted $\\eta_Y: Y \\to \\Omega \\Sigma Y$. This map is adjoint to the identity map on $\\Sigma Y$.\n\nThe map $\\phi$ in the question is the composition:\n$\\phi = e \\circ \\eta_Y: Y \\to \\Omega \\Sigma Y \\to \\Omega S^{10}$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the connectivity of $\\phi$**\n\nThe connectivity of a map is determined by its effect on homotopy groups. A map $f: A \\to B$ is $m$-connected if $f_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$ is an isomorphism for $i < m$ and a surjection for $i = m$.\n\nSince $e: \\Omega \\Sigma Y \\to \\Omega S^{10}$ is a homotopy equivalence, it is $\\infty$-connected (i.e., it induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups). Therefore, the connectivity of the composite map $\\phi = e \\circ \\eta_Y$ is the same as the connectivity of the map $\\eta_Y$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the connectivity of the map $\\eta_Y: Y \\to \\Omega \\Sigma Y$**\n\nThe connectivity of $\\eta_Y$ is given by the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem. The theorem states that for an $n$-connected CW complex $A$, the suspension homomorphism $E: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_{i+1}(\\Sigma A)$ is an isomorphism for $i < 2n$ and a surjection for $i = 2n$. (Using Hatcher's convention for connectivity and the theorem's statement).\n\nThe map on homotopy groups induced by $\\eta_Y$ is precisely this suspension homomorphism, $(\\eta_Y)_*: \\pi_i(Y) \\to \\pi_i(\\Omega \\Sigma Y) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(\\Sigma Y)$.\n\nTo apply the theorem, we must first find the connectivity of the source space $Y = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the connectivity of the source space $Y$**\n\n1.  The connectivity of a loop space $\\Omega S^p$ is $(p-2)$.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2)=2$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2)=4$-connected.\n\n2.  For two based CW complexes $A$ and $B$, if $A$ is $c_A$-connected and $B$ is $c_B$-connected, then their smash product $A \\wedge B$ is $(c_A + c_B + 1)$-connected.\n    *   Let $X = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$. Its connectivity is $(2 + 4 + 1) = 7$. So, $X$ is 7-connected.\n\n3.  The suspension $\\Sigma X$ of an $n$-connected space $X$ (with $n \\ge 0$) is $(n+1)$-connected.\n    *   Our source space is $Y = \\Sigma X = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Since $X$ is 7-connected, $Y$ is $(7+1)=8$-connected.\n\n**Step 6: Apply the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem**\n\nNow we apply the theorem to the map $\\eta_Y: Y \\to \\Omega \\Sigma Y$. The space $Y$ is 8-connected, so we use $n=8$ in the theorem.\n\nThe theorem states that $(\\eta_Y)_*: \\pi_i(Y) \\to \\pi_i(\\Omega \\Sigma Y)$ is:\n*   an isomorphism for $i < 2n = 2(8) = 16$.\n*   a surjection for $i = 2n = 16$.\n\n**Step 7: Final conclusion on the connectivity of the map $\\phi$**\n\nWe are looking for the largest integer $m$ such that $\\phi$ is $m$-connected. The map $\\phi$ (and $\\eta_Y$) induces isomorphisms on $\\pi_i$ for all $i < 16$ and a surjection on $\\pi_{16}$.\n\nAccording to the definition of an $m$-connected map (isomorphism for $i < m$, surjection for $i=m$), we test values of $m$:\n*   Let $m=16$. The condition is \"isomorphism for $i<16$\" and \"surjection for $i=16$\". Both are satisfied. Thus, the map is 16-connected.\n*   Let $m=17$. The condition is \"isomorphism for $i<17$\". This would require the map on $\\pi_{16}$ to be an isomorphism, but we only know it is a surjection. Therefore, the map is not, in general, 17-connected.\n\nThe connectivity of the map is 16."
