    "This problem asks for the number of distinct topological types of a specific kind of mathematical object. To find the answer, we must break down the question into its components and understand the key mathematical results that provide the classification.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Terminology**\n\nFirst, let's understand the properties of the object we are looking for:\n\n*   **Continuum:** In topology, a continuum is a **compact** and **connected** metric space. Informally, think of it as a single, bounded piece without any gaps or missing points. Examples include a line segment, a disk, or a sphere.\n*   **Planar:** A planar continuum is one that can be embedded in the Euclidean plane ($R^2$). This means it can be \"drawn\" on a flat sheet of paper without any parts crossing over themselves.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A space is homogeneous if it \"looks the same\" from every point. More formally, for any two points *x* and *y* in the space, there exists a homeomorphism (a continuous, invertible mapping) of the space onto itself that sends *x* to *y*.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** We are asked for the number of homeomorphism classes. Two spaces are in the same class if they are topologically equivalent (one can be continuously deformed into the other). For example, a square and a circle are in the same homeomorphism class. The question is asking: \"How many fundamentally different shapes fit all these descriptions?\"\n\n**Step 2: The Major Bifurcation (Plane-Separating vs. Non-Plane-Separating)**\n\nThe key to classifying these objects is a major theorem by the topologist R.H. Bing (1960). It splits the problem into two distinct categories:\n\n1.  Homogeneous planar continua that **separate the plane** (like a circle, which has an \"inside\" and an \"outside\").\n2.  Homogeneous planar continua that **do not separate the plane**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Plane-Separating Case**\n\nThis case is completely resolved by Bing's 1960 theorem.\n\n*   **Theorem (Bing):** The *only* homogeneous planar continuum that separates the plane is the **simple closed curve** (also called a Jordan curve).\n*   **Conclusion:** All simple closed curves (circles, squares, triangles, etc.) are homeomorphic to each other. Therefore, this category contributes exactly one homeomorphism class.\n\n**Class 1: The Circle (or Simple Closed Curve)**\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the Non-Plane-Separating Case**\n\nThis category is more complex. We must consider all homogeneous planar continua that, when embedded in the plane, do not cut it into separate regions.\n\n*   **The Trivial Case:** First, we consider the simplest possible continuum: a **single point**. A point is compact, connected, planar, and trivially homogeneous. It does not separate the plane. This gives us our second class.\n\n**Class 2: The Point**\n\n*   **The Non-Trivial Cases:** For non-degenerate (not a point) continua in this category, further classification is needed. The work of several topologists, including F. Burton Jones, C.L. Hagopian, and James T. Rogers Jr., provides the answer. A key theorem by Hagopian (1977) states that every non-degenerate, homogeneous, non-separating planar continuum is either \"tree-like\" or \"circle-like\".\n    *   **Subcase A: Tree-like Continua:** A \"tree-like\" continuum is one that can be arbitrarily closely approximated by finite trees. Another theorem by Bing (1951) identifies the only object in this sub-category.\n        *   **Theorem (Bing):** The only non-degenerate homogeneous tree-like continuum is the **pseudo-arc**.\n        *   The pseudo-arc is a famously complex, snake-like object. It is known to be planar and does not separate the plane. This gives us our third class.\n\n**Class 3: The Pseudo-arc**\n\n    *   **Subcase B: Circle-like Continua:** A \"circle-like\" continuum can be arbitrarily closely approximated by circles. A theorem by Rogers (1985) settles this final sub-category.\n        *   **Theorem (Rogers):** The only homogeneous, circle-like, non-separating planar continuum is the **circle of pseudo-arcs**.\n        *   This object can be visualized as a circle where each point has been replaced by a pseudo-arc. This is our fourth and final class.\n\n**Class 4: The Circle of Pseudo-arcs**\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nBy following this logical path, which is based on major theorems in topology, we have covered all possibilities:\n*   **The Trivial Case:** The point.\n*   **The Separating Case:** The circle.\n*   **The Non-Separating, Non-Trivial Cases:** The pseudo-arc (tree-like) and the circle of pseudo-arcs (circle-like).\n\nThese four classes are topologically distinct and represent the complete classification of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Exclusions:** Many famous continua are *not* on this list. The closed interval `[0,1]` is not homogeneous. The Sierpinski carpet is not homogeneous. The Menger sponge and solenoids are homogeneous but are *not planar*.\n*   **Uniqueness:** There is only one topological type of pseudo-arc and only one type of circle of pseudo-arcs.\n*   **Complexity:** The proofs of the theorems cited here are highly advanced and were the culmination of decades of research in topology.\n\nThere are exactly four such homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
