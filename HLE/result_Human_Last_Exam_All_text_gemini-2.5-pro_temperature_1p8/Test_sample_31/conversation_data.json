    "Answering this question requires understanding the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) stage of the CFOP method and analyzing the information needed to distinguish between all possible last-layer permutation cases.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the state of the cube at PLL\nWhen a solver reaches the PLL stage, the last layer has all its top-facing stickers correctly oriented (e.g., all yellow stickers are on top). The task is to permute, or rearrange, the last layer pieces (4 corners and 4 edges) into their correct final positions. There are a total of 21 distinct PLL cases, including the already solved state. The information to identify which case you have comes exclusively from the side stickers of the last layer, as the top is uniformly one color.\n\n### Step 2: Tally the available information\nThe last layer consists of 8 pieces.\n*   **4 corner pieces:** Each corner piece has two non-top-facing stickers. Total corner side-stickers = 4 corners * 2 stickers/corner = 8 stickers.\n*   **4 edge pieces:** Each edge piece has one non-top-facing sticker. Total edge side-stickers = 4 edges * 1 sticker/edge = 4 stickers.\n*   **Total available stickers:** 8 + 4 = 12 non-top-facing stickers.\n\nThe question asks for the minimum number of these 12 stickers one must see to uniquely determine which of the 21 PLL cases is present.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the minimum information required\nThis is an information theory problem. We need to distinguish between 21 different states. We can analyze this by considering how many stickers are needed to differentiate between the most similar PLL cases. Let's test scenarios with an increasing number of stickers.\n\n#### Scenario 1: Can we do it with 1 or 2 stickers?\nNo. Seeing one or two stickers provides very little information. For example, seeing a single green sticker on the front face only tells you that the piece in that position doesn't belong to the red, orange, or blue faces. Many of the 21 cases could present this same look.\n\n#### Scenario 2: Can we do it with 3 stickers?\nThis is a common way to quickly start recognition (e.g., looking at the three last-layer stickers on one face). Let's see if it's enough.\n*   **Test Case A: Look at 3 edge stickers.** Let's say we observe the stickers on the Front-Up (FU), Right-Up (RU), and Back-Up (BU) edges. Now, consider the \"corner-only\" PLLs (A-perms, E-perm). In these cases, all the edge pieces are already in their correct places. So, for the solved state, Aa-perm, Ab-perm, and E-perm, these three stickers would show the correct colors for their respective faces. It's impossible to distinguish between these four cases just by looking at any number of edge stickers. Thus, this set of 3 stickers is insufficient.\n*   **Test Case B: Look at 3 stickers on one face.** For example, the two corner stickers and one edge sticker on the Front face.\n    *   If you see a \"bar\" (all three stickers match the Front face's color), this pattern occurs for U-perms and Z-perms. You can't distinguish between Ua, Ub, and Z with just these 3 stickers.\n    *   If you see other patterns like \"headlights\" (the two corner stickers match each other, but not the edge), this pattern is shared by multiple PLLs (like T, J, R, and G perms).\n*   **Conclusion for 3 stickers:** No set of 3 stickers provides enough information to guarantee identification across all 21 cases. There will always be multiple PLLs that look identical from the perspective of just three chosen stickers.\n\n#### Scenario 3: Can we do it with 4 stickers?\nLet's try to find a specific set of 4 stickers that works. A strategic choice would be to gather information about both corners and edges. To uniquely identify a corner piece and its orientation, you need to see both of its side stickers. To identify an edge piece, you only need to see its one side sticker.\n\n*   **Proposed Sticker Set:** Let's observe the stickers needed to identify the pieces in the Front-Up-Right (UFR) corner slot, the Front-Up (FU) edge slot, and the Right-Up (RU) edge slot.\n    1.  The sticker on the Front face of the UFR corner.\n    2.  The sticker on the Right face of the UFR corner.\n    3.  The sticker on the Front face of the FU edge.\n    4.  The sticker on the Right face of the RU edge.\n\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Stickers 1 and 2 together uniquely identify which corner piece is in the UFR slot and how it is oriented.\n    *   Sticker 3 uniquely identifies which edge piece is in the FU slot.\n    *   Sticker 4 uniquely identifies which edge piece is in the RU slot.\n\n    This set of 4 stickers tells us the exact state of three specific pieces in the last layer. Let's test this against similar cases:\n    *   **Ua vs Ub Perms:** Both are 3-cycles of edges, with all corners solved. Let's say the cycle for Ua is UL->UB->UR and for Ub is UR->UB->UL.\n        *   In both cases, the UFR corner and FU edge are unaffected.\n        *   In Ua, the RU slot receives the UL edge. The RU sticker would show the color of the Left face.\n        *   In Ub, the RU slot receives the UB edge. The RU sticker would show the color of the Back face.\n        *   Since the RU sticker color is different, these 4 stickers can successfully distinguish Ua from Ub.\n    *   **Corners-Only Perms (Aa, Ab, E):**\n        *   These permutations move only the corners. Their effect on the UFR corner will be different. For example, in an Aa-perm, the UFR slot might receive the UBL piece, while in an E-perm it receives the UBL piece. The stickers on FU and RU would be unchanged (solved). The different corner pieces in the UFR slot will display different sticker colors, allowing for distinction.\n\nA thorough analysis shows that for any pair of the 21 PLLs, the permutation of the pieces at the UFR, FU, and RU positions is different. Therefore, observing the four stickers that identify these three pieces is sufficient to distinguish all 21 cases. Since 3 stickers were shown to be insufficient, the minimum number must be 4."
