    "This puzzle requires figuring out a rule that transforms an input grid of numbers into an output grid. The core transformation in the examples involves a single digit '2' moving to an adjacent position that contains a '0'.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Basic Transformation:**\n    In both `Input_A` -> `Output_A` and `Input_B` -> `Output_B`, a single '2' moves its position.\n    *   **The '2' moves to an adjacent cell (sharing an edge or a corner).**\n    *   **The destination cell must originally be a '0'.**\n    *   **The original cell of the '2' becomes a '0'.**\n\n2.  **Determine the Destination Selection Rule:**\n    The main challenge is to figure out which adjacent '0' the '2' moves to if multiple options are available. Let's analyze the examples.\n\n    *   **Example A:**\n        *   Input Grid:\n            ```\n            0 0 1 1 1 1\n            1 2 1 1 1 1\n            1 1 1 1 1 1\n            ```\n        *   The '2' is at position (row=1, col=1).\n        *   Its adjacent '0's are at (0,0) and (0,1). There are **two** choices.\n        *   The output shows the '2' moved to **(0,0)**.\n\n    *   **Example B:**\n        *   Input Grid:\n            ```\n            ...\n            ...000011110...\n            ...002111111...\n            ...\n            ```\n        *   The '2' is at position (row=3, col=6).\n        *   Its adjacent '0's are at (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), and (3,5). There are **four** choices.\n        *   The output shows the '2' moved to **(2,7)**.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:**\n    The choice of destination seems to depend on the number of available '0' neighbors and their coordinates. Let `S` be the set of coordinates of all adjacent '0's.\n\n    *   In Example A, `|S| = 2`, and the chosen destination `(0,0)` has the minimum row index, and then the minimum column index among all choices (`min(row), min(col)`).\n    *   In Example B, `|S| = 4`. The choices are `(2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5)`. The chosen destination is `(2,7)`. This location corresponds to the minimum row index, and then the maximum column index among the candidates with that minimum row (`min(row), max(col)`).\n\n    This suggests a conditional rule:\n    *   **Rule 1:** If the number of adjacent '0's is 2 or less, the '2' moves to the '0' with the smallest row index. If there's a tie, it moves to the one with the smallest column index.\n    *   **Rule 2:** If the number of adjacent '0's is more than 2, the '2' moves to the '0' with the smallest row index. If there's a tie, it moves to the one with the largest column index.\n    *   **Rule 3:** If there are no adjacent '0's, the '2' does not move.\n\n    This set of rules correctly explains the transformations for both A and B.\n\n### Solving for Input_C\n\nNow, we apply this rule to `Input_C` to find the value of `MISSING`.\n\n1.  **Parse `Input_C`:**\n    *   `Input_C='000000,011120,111111'`\n    *   Grid Representation:\n        ```\n        0 0 0 0 0 0  (row 0)\n        0 1 1 1 2 0  (row 1)\n        1 1 1 1 1 1  (row 2)\n        ```\n\n2.  **Locate the '2' and its '0' Neighbors:**\n    *   The '2' is at position (row=1, col=4).\n    *   The adjacent cells and their values are:\n        *   (0,3): 0\n        *   (0,4): 0\n        *   (0,5): 0\n        *   (1,3): 1\n        *   (1,5): 0\n        *   (2,3): 1\n        *   (2,4): 1\n        *   (2,5): 1\n    *   The set of adjacent '0's is `S = {(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5)}`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Selection Rule:**\n    *   The number of '0' neighbors is `|S| = 4`.\n    *   Since `4 > 2`, we use **Rule 2**: select the destination with the minimum row, then maximum column.\n    *   The candidates are `(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5)`.\n    *   The minimum row index is `0`. The candidates in this row are `(0,3), (0,4), (0,5)`.\n    *   Among these, we pick the one with the maximum column index, which is `5`.\n    *   The destination is **(0,5)**.\n\n4.  **Construct the Output Grid:**\n    *   The '2' moves from (1,4) to (0,5).\n    *   The original cell (1,4) becomes '0'.\n    *   The destination cell (0,5) becomes '2'.\n    *   Initial Grid:\n        ```\n        0 0 0 0 0 0\n        0 1 1 1 2 0\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   Final Grid:\n        ```\n        0 0 0 0 0 2\n        0 1 1 1 0 0\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n\n5.  **Format the Final Answer:**\n    Convert the final grid back into a comma-separated string.\n    *   Row 0: `000002`\n    *   Row 1: `011100`\n    *   Row 2: `111111`\n    *   Result: `000002,011100,111111`\n\nThis is the value for `MISSING`.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
