    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two Nobel laureates featured in the Enron commercial.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the context of the question.**\nThe question asks to identify two specific individuals who meet several criteria:\n1.  They are Nobel laureates.\n2.  They were featured in a commercial for the company Enron.\n3.  The commercial aired around the year 2000.\n4.  The commercial was part of the \"Ask Why\" campaign.\n\n**Step 2: Research Enron's \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign.**\nEnron's \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major corporate branding effort that ran from 1999 to 2001. Its goal was to portray Enron as an innovative and intelligent company that was challenging the old ways of the energy industry. The commercials often featured intellectuals and thinkers discussing complex ideas, associating that brainpower with the Enron brand. This makes it plausible that Nobel prize winners would have been sought for the ads.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the first featured laureate.**\nResearch into the cast of the \"Ask Why\" commercials reveals that economist Myron Scholes was a prominent participant.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must verify his Nobel laureate status. Myron S. Scholes was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997, along with Robert C. Merton, for developing a new method to determine the value of derivatives (the famous Black-Scholes model). Since the prize was awarded in 1997, he was already a Nobel laureate at the time the commercial aired in 2000.\n*   **Careful Point (Infamy):** Scholes was also a founding partner of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), which collapsed spectacularly in 1998, requiring a massive Federal Reserve-organized bailout. His appearance in an ad for another company that would soon collapse in a major scandal is a significant source of the commercial's infamy.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the second featured laureate.**\nThe other economist featured alongside Myron Scholes in the commercial was Paul Krugman.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must verify his Nobel laureate status. Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his analysis of trade patterns and the location of economic activity.\n*   **Careful Point (Timing):** It is important to note that while Paul Krugman is a Nobel laureate, he had not yet received the prize when the commercial was filmed in 2000. He was, however, a highly respected and well-known economist from MIT at the time. The question asks which \"two Nobel laureates\" were featured, which is factually correct since both individuals ultimately became Nobel laureates.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the findings to confirm the answer.**\nThe two individuals who were featured in Enron's infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial and are Nobel laureates are Myron Scholes and Paul Krugman. The irony of Scholes (linked to the LTCM collapse) and Krugman appearing in an ad for a company on the verge of its own massive fraud-driven collapse has made the commercial a well-known case study in business and advertising.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"
