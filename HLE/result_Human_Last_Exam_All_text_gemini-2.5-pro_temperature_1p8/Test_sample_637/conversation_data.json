    "An analysis of the problem is as follows:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\nWe are given a discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system:\n*   State equation: `x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)`\n*   Output equation: `y(k) = Cx(k)`\nWith matrices:\n`A = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]`\n`B = [0; 1; -1; 1]`\n`C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n\nThe system has state dimension `n=4`, input dimension `m=1`, and output dimension `p=2`.\n\nThe goal is to design a full-state observer of the form:\n`x_hat(k + 1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - C*x_hat(k))`\nsuch that the observation error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` becomes zero in the shortest possible number of time steps. This is a \"deadbeat observer\" design problem.\n\n**2. Analyze the Error Dynamics**\n\nThe dynamics of the observation error `e(k)` are given by:\n`e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`\nFor the error to become zero and stay zero, the matrix `(A - LC)` must be nilpotent, meaning `(A - LC)^v = 0` for some integer `v`. This implies that all eigenvalues of `(A - LC)` must be zero. Our task is to find the observer gain matrix `L` (a 4x2 matrix) that places all four eigenvalues of `(A - LC)` at the origin of the complex plane.\n\n**3. The Shortest Possible Time and Observability**\n\nThe shortest number of steps `v` for the error to be guaranteed to be zero is the observability index `v_o` of the system `(A, C)`.\n*   A deadbeat observer can be designed if and only if the system is observable.\n*   The condition for the error to go to zero in the minimum time `v_o` is that the minimal polynomial of `(A - LC)` must be `λ^(v_o)`.\n*   The characteristic polynomial must be `λ^n = λ^4`.\n\nTo find the observability index, we examine the rank of the observability matrices.\n*   `rank(C) = rank([1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]) = 2`.\n*   `CA = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`.\n*   `rank([C; CA]) = rank([1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1; -1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]) = 3`.\n*   `CA^2 = [0 0 1 -2; 2 1 0 -3]`.\n*   `rank([C; CA; CA^2]) = 4 = n`.\nSince the rank first reaches `n=4` after including terms up to `A^2`, the observability index of the system is `v_o = 3`. The system is observable. The observability indices are `v1=3` and `v2=1`.\n\nThis implies we need to find `L` such that `(A-LC)^3 = 0`. This is satisfied if the Jordan form of `A-LC` has Jordan blocks for `λ=0` with the largest block size being 3. Since there are `p=2` outputs, the Jordan form will have two blocks. The indices `(3,1)` dictate that the block sizes should be 3 and 1.\nThe number of Jordan blocks is `n - rank(A-LC)`. For two blocks, we need `rank(A-LC) = 4 - 2 = 2`.\n\n**4. The Pole Placement Problem (Duality)**\n\nFinding `L` to place the eigenvalues of `A - LC` is equivalent to finding a state-feedback gain `K` for the dual system `(A^T, C^T)` to place the eigenvalues of `A^T - C^T K`.\nWe let `K = L^T`, which is a 2x4 matrix. The problem is to find `K` such that the matrix `M = A^T - C^T K` has `rank(M) = 2` and a characteristic polynomial of `λ^4`.\n\n**5. Solving for the Gain Matrix K**\n\nLet's compute `M = A^T - C^T K`.\n`A^T = [-1 1 0 -1; 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 1; 1 2 -1 -1]`\n`C^T = [1 1; 0 0; 0 0; 0 1]`\n`K = [k11 k12 k13 k14; k21 k22 k23 k24]`\n\n`C^T K = [k11+k21  k12+k22  k13+k23  k14+k24; 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; k21 k22 k23 k24]`\n`M = A^T - C^T K =`\n`[-1-(k11+k21)  1-(k12+k22)  -(k13+k23)  -1-(k14+k24);`\n` 0               0             1            0;`\n` 0               0             0            1;`\n` 1-k21           2-k22       -1-k23       -1-k24     ]`\n\nFor `rank(M)` to be 2, rows 1 and 4 must be linear combinations of rows 2 and 3. Since the first two elements of rows 2 and 3 are zero, the first two elements of rows 1 and 4 must also be zero.\n1.  `-1-(k11+k21) = 0`\n2.  `1-(k12+k22) = 0`\n3.  `1-k21 = 0   => k21 = 1`\n4.  `2-k22 = 0   => k22 = 2`\n\nSubstituting `k21` and `k22` into the first two equations:\n1.  `-1 - (k11+1) = 0   => k11 = -2`\n2.  `1 - (k12+2) = 0   => k12 = -1`\n\nWith these values, `M` becomes:\n`[0 0 -(k13+k23)  -1-(k14+k24);`\n` 0 0  1            0;`\n` 0 0  0            1;`\n` 0 0 -1-k23       -1-k24     ]`\nNow we must ensure `char(M) = λ^4`.\n`det(λI - M) = det([λ 0 k13+k23  1+k14+k24; 0 λ -1 0; 0 0 λ -1; 0 0 1+k23 λ+1+k24])`\n`det = λ * λ * det([λ -1; 1+k23 λ+1+k24]) = λ^2(λ(λ+1+k24) + (1+k23)) = λ^3(λ+1+k24) + λ^2(1+k23)`\nFor this to equal `λ^4`, we need the coefficients of `λ^3` and `λ^2` to be zero.\n*   `λ^3`: `1+k24 = 0   => k24 = -1`\n*   `λ^2`: `1+k23 = 0   => k23 = -1`\n\nThis determines all values in `K` except for `k13` and `k14`. These can be chosen freely. For simplicity, we choose `k13 = 0` and `k14 = 0`.\n\nThe resulting state-feedback gain for the dual system is:\n`K = [-2 -1  0  0;`\n     ` 1  2 -1 -1]`\n\n**6. Determine the Observer Gain L**\n\nThe observer gain matrix `L` is the transpose of `K`.\n`L = K^T`\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nFrom the analysis, we have:\n`K = [[-2, -1, 0, 0], [1, 2, -1, -1]]`\n`L = K^T = [[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [0, -1], [0, -1]]`\n\nThis gain matrix `L` ensures that the closed-loop observer error matrix `A-LC` has a rank of 2 and its characteristic polynomial is `λ^4`. This corresponds to a Jordan form with blocks of size 3 and 1, resulting in `(A-LC)^3=0`. Therefore, the error converges to zero in a maximum of 3 steps, which is the minimum possible time.\n\nThe observer gain matrix is:\n`L = [-2 1; -1 2; 0 -1; 0 -1]`\n\n<<<[[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [0, -1], [0, -1]]>>>"
