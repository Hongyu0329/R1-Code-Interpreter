    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Reverse Turn:** A fundamental figure in ballroom dancing where the couple turns to the left. The exact mechanics and timing vary between dances.\n    *   **Overturning:** This means turning more than the prescribed amount for a given figure according to the official technique syllabus. For example, if a turn is defined as making a 3/4 rotation over three steps, overturning it would mean trying to make a full 1 rotation or more in those same three steps.\n    *   **\"Without disregarding the technique\":** This is the crucial part of the question. It's not about physical impossibility, but about whether the action can be performed while still adhering to the fundamental principles and character of the specific dance.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Dance:**\n\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz & B. English Waltz & D. Slow Foxtrot:** These three dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Viennese Waltz) are classified as \"swing\" dances. A core technical element is the creation of momentum through body swing, which facilitates rotation.\n        *   **Careful Point:** In these dances, while a syllabus figure has a defined amount of turn, advanced dancers often manipulate this for choreography or to navigate the dance floor. Adding extra rotation (\"overturning\") is achieved by increasing the swing and momentum. While this may deviate from the basic syllabus, it does not violate the *fundamental principle* of the dance, which is built on swing and rotation. Therefore, overturning is technically possible within the character of these dances.\n\n    *   **E. Quickstep:** This is also a swing dance, known for its speed, dynamism, and energetic \"pepperpot\" character. It incorporates hops, skips, and fast rotational figures like Spin Turns.\n        *   **Careful Point:** Overturning a figure might be part of a specific choreographic interpretation to add flair or a spinning effect. Given the high energy and speed of the dance, extra rotation is not fundamentally alien to its technique. It's difficult to control, but not \"impossible\" without violating the dance's nature.\n\n    *   **C. European Tango:** The Tango stands apart from the other dances listed.\n        *   **Careful Point 1 (No Rise and Fall):** Tango has no rise and fall. The dancers maintain a constant level, moving with bent knees. This contrasts with the swing dances, where rise and fall help generate and control rotational momentum.\n        *   **Careful Point 2 (Staccato Action & No Swing):** The technique of Tango is based on a progressive, \"walking\" or \"stalking\" action. The movements are sharp and staccato, not smooth and flowing. There is no body swing in the same way as in a Waltz or Foxtrot.\n        *   **Careful Point 3 (Progressive Nature):** The Reverse Turn in Tango is designed to change direction while maintaining a strong progressive movement along the line of dance. It is not a continuous rotational turn. To \"overturn\" it would require adding a swinging, rotational action that is fundamentally contrary to Tango technique. You would have to stop the progressive \"walk\" and introduce a type of movement (swing) that is explicitly excluded from the dance's technical definition. This action would completely disregard the staccato, progressive, and non-swinging character of the Tango.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep, overturning a reverse turn is a matter of adding more of an existing technical element (swing/rotation). In Tango, overturning a reverse turn would require introducing a technical element (swing/rotation) that is fundamentally absent from and contrary to the core principles of the dance. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn in European Tango without disregarding its essential technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
