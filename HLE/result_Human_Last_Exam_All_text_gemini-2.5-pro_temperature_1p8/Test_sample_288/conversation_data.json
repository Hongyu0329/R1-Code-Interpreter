    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main projection target of ASJ axons in adult C. elegans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the components of the question.**\n*   **C. elegans:** A nematode worm, a key model organism in neuroscience because its entire nervous system (the connectome) has been mapped.\n*   **ASJ:** A specific class of sensory neurons. It is a bilaterally symmetric pair, consisting of ASJL (left) and ASJR (right). These neurons are known to be involved in sensing pheromones, regulating dauer formation, and promoting lifespan.\n*   **Axon Projection Target:** The downstream neuron(s) that the ASJ axon connects to via synapses.\n*   **Main Target in terms of Synapse Number:** The specific postsynaptic neuron or neuron class that receives the highest number of synaptic connections from ASJ axons.\n*   **Adult:** The analysis should be based on the connectome of the adult C. elegans, as neural wiring can change during development.\n\n**Step 2: Consult the C. elegans Connectome Data.**\nTo answer this question, we must refer to the anatomical data of the C. elegans nervous system. The original connectome was published by White et al. in 1986. More recent and detailed reconstructions using serial section electron microscopy have been published (e.g., Cook et al., 2019; Witvliet et al., 2021). These newer datasets provide more precise synapse counts.\n\n**Step 3: Examine the Synaptic Outputs of ASJ Neurons.**\nWe need to look at the list of postsynaptic partners for both ASJL and ASJR and find the one with the highest synapse count.\n\n*   **Synaptic Outputs from ASJR (right neuron):**\n    *   Based on recent connectome data (Witvliet et al., 2021), the ASJR neuron makes synapses onto several other neurons. The primary target is the **AIYR** interneuron.\n    *   Approximate synapse counts:\n        *   ASJR -> **AIYR**: ~14 synapses\n        *   ASJR -> RIFL: ~8 synapses\n        *   ASJR -> PVQR: ~7 synapses\n        *   Other targets like RIFR, AIBR, ASKL receive fewer synapses.\n\n*   **Synaptic Outputs from ASJL (left neuron):**\n    *   Following the system's bilateral symmetry, the ASJL neuron primarily targets its ipsilateral (same-side) partner, the **AIYL** interneuron.\n    *   Approximate synapse counts:\n        *   ASJL -> **AIYL**: ~11 synapses\n        *   ASJL -> RIFR: ~8 synapses\n        *   ASJL -> PVQL: ~7 synapses\n        *   Other targets like RIFL, AIBL, ASKR receive fewer synapses.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Main Target.**\nBy comparing the synapse numbers, it is clear that for each ASJ neuron (left and right), the corresponding AIY interneuron (left and right, respectively) is the top postsynaptic partner. When considering the ASJ class as a whole, its main projection target is undeniably the **AIY** interneuron class. The connection to AIY is significantly stronger than to any other neuron class like RIF or PVQ.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Data Source:** Synapse counts can vary slightly between different reconstructions of the connectome. However, the identity of the *main* target (AIY) is consistent across all major reconstructions, from the original White et al. (1986) paper to the most recent datasets.\n2.  **Symmetry:** While C. elegans is largely bilaterally symmetric, the wiring is not perfect. It is important to check both ASJL and ASJR. In this case, the connectivity pattern is conserved: ASJ projects most heavily to its ipsilateral AIY partner.\n3.  **Neuron Class vs. Individual Neuron:** The question asks for \"what cell\". Since ASJ is a pair of neurons (ASJL/ASJR) that project most strongly to another pair (AIYL/AIYR), the most accurate and comprehensive answer is the neuron class **AIY**. The single cell receiving the most synapses from any one ASJ neuron is AIYR (from ASJR).\n4.  **Synapse Type:** The analysis is based on chemical synapses, which are the primary means of directed information flow between neurons and are the standard metric for such questions. ASJ also forms electrical synapses (gap junctions) with other neurons, but its principal output projection is via chemical synapses to AIY.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis of the adult C. elegans connectome shows that the ASJ sensory neurons make the largest number of synapses onto the AIY interneurons. This makes AIY the main functional and structural downstream target of ASJ.\n\n<<<AIY>>>"
