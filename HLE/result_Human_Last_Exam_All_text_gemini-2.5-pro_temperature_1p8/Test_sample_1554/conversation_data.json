    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A philosopher.\n    *   **Affiliation:** Belongs to the \"Lviv-Warsaw School\" of philosophy. This was a prominent Polish intellectual movement in the early 20th century known for its focus on logic, language, and scientific philosophy.\n    *   **Specific Contribution:** The philosopher \"decomposes the notion of hallmark into symptoms and signals.\" This indicates a specific analytical distinction within the philosophy of language or semiotics (the study of signs).\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Philosophical Concepts:**\n    *   **Hallmark:** This is a general term for a characteristic, a distinguishing mark, or a sign that indicates something.\n    *   **Symptom:** A type of sign that has a natural, often causal, connection to what it signifies. For example, a fever is a symptom of illness; smoke is a symptom of fire. The connection is not arbitrary.\n    *   **Signal:** A type of sign whose meaning is established by convention, rule, or intention. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; words are signals whose meanings are based on linguistic conventions. The connection is arbitrary and must be learned.\n\n3.  **Survey the Lviv-Warsaw School Philosophers:**\n    *   The school included many famous thinkers, such as its founder Kazimierz Twardowski, and his students Stanisław Leśniewski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Alfred Tarski, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n    *   While many worked on logic and language, we need to find the one who specifically made the distinction between these two types of signs.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Candidates:**\n    *   Łukasiewicz, Leśniewski, and Tarski were primarily formal logicians and mathematicians. While their work is foundational to the analysis of language, this specific semiotic distinction is not central to their main contributions.\n    *   Tadeusz Kotarbiński worked on ontology (reism) and praxiology (the theory of efficient action), which involved language analysis, but his focus was different.\n    *   **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** is the most promising candidate. He worked extensively on epistemology and the philosophy of language. His major work, *Pragmatic Logic* (*Logika pragmatyczna*, 1965), contains detailed analyses of language, meaning, and signs.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the Specific Contribution:**\n    *   In his works, particularly *Pragmatic Logic*, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz explicitly analyzes the concept of a sign (*znak* in Polish).\n    *   He distinguishes between:\n        1.  **Natural Signs (Symptoms):** He calls these *oznaki* or *symptomy*. He identifies them by their natural (e.g., causal) relationship to the thing they signify.\n        2.  **Conventional Signs (Signals):** He calls these *znaki umowne* (conventional signs) or *sygnały*. Their meaning is based on an established convention for the purpose of communication.\n    *   This distinction perfectly matches the decomposition mentioned in the question. The general notion of a \"hallmark\" or \"sign\" is thus broken down by Ajdukiewicz into these two fundamental categories.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Translation:** The English terms \"hallmark,\" \"symptom,\" and \"signal\" are translations of philosophical terms likely written in Polish or German. \"Hallmark\" corresponds to a general sign (*znak*) or distinguishing feature (*znamię*). \"Symptom\" and \"signal\" are direct parallels to Ajdukiewicz's *symptom* and *sygnał*.\n*   **Context:** This distinction is fundamental to semiotics and helps clarify how language works. Natural signs (symptoms) are a subject of science (e.g., medicine), while conventional signs (signals) are the basis of language and human communication.\n*   **School's Influence:** This type of clear, analytical distinction is highly characteristic of the Lviv-Warsaw School's general philosophical method, which prioritized clarity and logical rigor.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the contributions of the major figures of the Lviv-Warsaw School, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz is the philosopher who introduced the formal distinction between natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (signals) as a way to analyze the broader concept of a sign or hallmark.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
