    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) to determine the coldest efficient production temperature.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Reaction**\nThe most common and direct method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is the reaction between Xenon (Xe) gas and Fluorine (F₂) gas. The balanced chemical equation for this synthesis is:\nXe (g) + 2 F₂ (g) → XeF₄ (s)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Conditions**\nThe synthesis of xenon fluorides is highly sensitive to the reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the molar ratio of the reactants.\n\n*   **Reactant Ratio:** To favor the formation of XeF₄ over other xenon fluorides like XeF₂ or XeF₆, a specific molar ratio is used. A mixture with an excess of fluorine, typically in a ratio of 1 part Xenon to 5 parts Fluorine (1:5 Xe:F₂), is required.\n*   **Pressure:** The reaction is typically carried out under elevated pressure, commonly around 6 atmospheres.\n*   **Temperature:** This reaction is exothermic, but it has a high activation energy. This means that a significant amount of energy, usually in the form of heat, must be supplied to initiate the reaction and allow it to proceed at a practical rate.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Effect of Temperature on Reaction Efficiency**\n\"Efficiency\" in this context refers to achieving a good yield of the desired product (XeF₄) in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n*   **High Temperatures (e.g., > 400 °C):** At temperatures significantly above 400 °C, such as 600 °C, the XeF₄ product can become unstable and may decompose back into XeF₂ and F₂. Alternatively, with a large excess of fluorine and high pressure, the reaction might proceed further to form XeF₆. Thus, very high temperatures are not efficient for isolating pure XeF₄.\n*   **Low Temperatures (e.g., < 400 °C):** At temperatures considerably lower than 400 °C, the activation energy barrier is not easily overcome. The rate of reaction becomes very slow. At temperatures like 200 °C, 78 °C, 0 °C, or -78 °C, the thermal reaction would be too slow to be considered efficient for preparative purposes. A negligible amount of product would be formed in a practical timeframe.\n*   **Optimal Temperature:** Decades of chemical research have established that heating the 1:5 Xe:F₂ mixture at **400 °C** provides the necessary activation energy for the reaction to proceed quickly and produce a high yield of XeF₄. This temperature strikes a balance between being high enough to ensure a rapid reaction but not so high as to cause decomposition of the product.\n\n**Step 4: Consider Alternative Synthesis Methods**\nThe question mentions \"any method of synthesis\". While methods like using electric discharge or highly reactive fluorinating agents (like O₂F₂) can sometimes produce xenon fluorides at lower temperatures, they come with significant drawbacks.\n*   **Electric Discharge:** Often produces a mixture of XeF₂, XeF₄, and unreacted gases, requiring difficult separation steps. This is generally not considered an \"efficient\" method for producing pure XeF₄.\n*   **Highly Reactive Reagents:** Reagents like O₂F₂ are extremely dangerous and unstable, making the synthesis impractical and unsafe.\nTherefore, the most reliable and \"efficient\" method remains the direct thermal synthesis.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion and Selection of Answer**\nBased on the analysis, the standard, proven, and efficient method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride is the direct thermal reaction. The established optimal temperature for this process is 400 °C. While reactions can occur at other temperatures, they are not efficient.\n\n*   **A. 600 C:** Too high; can lead to decomposition.\n*   **B. 400 C:** The well-established temperature for efficient synthesis.\n*   **C. 200 C:** Too low; the reaction rate is impractically slow.\n*   **D. 78 C:** Far too low for the thermal reaction.\n*   **E. 0 C:** Far too low for the thermal reaction.\n*   **F. -78 C:** Far too low for the thermal reaction.\n\nThus, 400 °C is the coldest temperature listed at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently.\n\n<<<B>>>"
