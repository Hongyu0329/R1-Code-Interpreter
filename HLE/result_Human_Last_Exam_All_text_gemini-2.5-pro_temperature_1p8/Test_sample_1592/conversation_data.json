    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Locate Waskaganish**\nWaskaganish is a Cree community located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec. It is situated on the southern coast of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River. Its approximate geographic coordinates are 51°11′N latitude, 78°45′W longitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories**\nQuebec shares borders with the following Canadian provinces and territories:\n*   **Ontario:** To the west.\n*   **Nunavut:** To the north. The border with Nunavut runs through Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, and Ungava Bay. Importantly, the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay belong to Nunavut.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** To the east.\n*   **New Brunswick:** To the southeast.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proximity of Each Neighbor**\nWe need to determine which of these neighboring provinces or territories has a border point closest to Waskaganish.\n\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador & New Brunswick:** These provinces are far to the east and southeast of Waskaganish. The distances are in the hundreds of kilometers, making them unlikely candidates.\n*   **Nunavut:** The closest parts of Nunavut to Waskaganish are the islands within James Bay. The closest significant islands belonging to Nunavut are the Twin Islands, located approximately 130 kilometers (about 80 miles) to the north-northwest of Waskaganish, across a stretch of open water.\n*   **Ontario:** The border between Quebec and Ontario is a long, North-South land border. This border meets the southern coast of James Bay just to the west of Waskaganish. The land border is located at approximately 79°31′W longitude. Since Waskaganish is at 78°45′W longitude, the land border with Ontario is only a short distance directly to the west. The straight-line distance from the community of Waskaganish to the Ontario border is less than 60 kilometers (about 37 miles).\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Distances**\n*   Distance to Ontario's land border: Less than 60 km.\n*   Distance to Nunavut's closest islands: Approximately 130 km.\n*   Distance to Newfoundland and Labrador or New Brunswick: Several hundred kilometers.\n\n**Conclusion**\nComparing the distances, the land border with the province of Ontario is significantly closer to Waskaganish than the nearest territory of Nunavut or any other province.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Exact Location:** Knowing that Waskaganish is in *northwestern* Quebec on the coast of James Bay is critical.\n2.  **Border Definitions:** It's essential to know that while Quebec has a long coastline on James Bay, the islands within the bay belong to Nunavut.\n3.  **Type of Border:** The border with Ontario is a land border very close to Waskaganish, whereas the border with Nunavut is across the water. The shortest distance will be to the land border.\n4.  **Elimination:** Quickly ruling out the provinces to the east and southeast simplifies the problem to a comparison between Ontario and Nunavut.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
