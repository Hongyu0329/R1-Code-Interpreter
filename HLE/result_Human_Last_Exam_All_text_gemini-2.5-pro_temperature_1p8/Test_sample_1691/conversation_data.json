    "An analytical formula that approximates the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ for small $\\epsilon$ can be developed using asymptotic analysis. Here is a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identification of the Singular Behavior**\n\nLet the integral be $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + h(x)} dx$, where $h(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$. We are interested in the regime where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive parameter ($\\epsilon \\to 0^+$).\n\nThe denominator is $\\epsilon + h(x)$. Since $h(x) = x^5(9 + 5x + 9x^3)$, we can see that $h(x) > 0$ for $x > 0$ and $h(0) = 0$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the term $\\epsilon$ becomes very small. For any $x > 0$, the integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + h(x)}$ approaches $\\frac{1}{h(x)}$. However, at $x=0$, $h(0)=0$, and the denominator becomes $\\epsilon$. The integrand at $x=0$ is $1/\\epsilon$, which blows up as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$.\n\nThis indicates that the dominant contribution to the integral comes from a very small region near $x=0$. This is a classic singular perturbation problem where the singularity is at one of the endpoints of the integration interval.\n\n**2. Approximation of the Denominator in the Dominant Region**\n\nNear the point of singularity, $x=0$, we can approximate the function $h(x)$ by its term with the lowest power of $x$. This is because for $x \\ll 1$, higher powers of $x$ are much smaller.\n$h(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$.\nFor small $x$, $x^6 \\ll x^5$ and $x^8 \\ll x^5$. Thus, we can approximate $h(x)$ by its leading term:\n$h(x) \\approx 9x^5$ for $x \\to 0$.\n\nThis approximation allows us to simplify the integral. The major contribution to the integral comes from a small region near $x=0$ where this approximation is valid.\n\n**3. Simplification of the Integral**\n\nWe replace $h(x)$ in the integral with its small-$x$ approximation:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$.\n\n**4. Extending the Limit of Integration**\n\nThe integrand is significant only when $\\epsilon$ is comparable to $9x^5$. This implies $x$ must be of the order of $(\\epsilon/9)^{1/5}$. Since $\\epsilon$ is small, this region is very close to $x=0$. For larger $x$, for example, $x=15$, the integrand is approximately $1/(9 \\cdot 15^5)$, which is very small. The contribution from the upper part of the integration range (e.g., from some small $\\delta$ to 15) is negligible compared to the contribution from the region near $x=0$.\nTherefore, extending the upper limit of integration from 15 to $\\infty$ simplifies the calculation significantly without affecting the leading-order asymptotic behavior. The error introduced by this extension is of a lower order than the leading term.\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$.\n\n**5. Calculation of the Approximate Integral**\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we perform a change of variables to factor out the $\\epsilon$ dependence. Let the new variable $u$ be defined by $9x^5 = \\epsilon u$.\nFrom this, we derive the expressions for $x$ and $dx$:\n$x^5 = \\frac{\\epsilon u}{9} \\implies x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} u^{1/5}$.\n$dx = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} \\frac{1}{5} u^{1/5 - 1} du = \\frac{1}{5}\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} u^{-4/5} du$.\n\nThe integration limits for $u$ are from $u(0)=0$ to $u(\\infty)=\\infty$.\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon u} \\left( \\frac{1}{5}\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} u^{-4/5} \\right) du$.\n\nNow, we simplify the expression:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon(1 + u)} \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{1/5} u^{-4/5} du$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\cdot \\epsilon} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1 + u} du$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{1/5 - 1} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1 + u} du$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1 + u} du$.\n\n**6. Using the Beta Function Integral**\n\nThe remaining integral is a standard integral representation of the Beta function, which relates to the Gamma function. The general formula is:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{p-1}}{1+t} dt = B(p, 1-p) = \\Gamma(p)\\Gamma(1-p) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(p\\pi)}$.\n\nIn our case, the exponent is $-4/5$. So, we have $p-1 = -4/5$, which gives $p = 1/5$.\nThus, the value of the integral is:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1+u} du = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\n**7. Final Analytical Formula**\n\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\nThis is the desired analytical formula that approximates $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$. We can write it as:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)}\\right) \\epsilon^{-4/5}$.\n\nThe constants are taken from the problem description, where the leading term has coefficient $a=9.0$ and power $p=5.0$. The formula can be written with these values:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5.0} \\sin(\\pi/5.0)} \\epsilon^{(1.0-5.0)/5.0} = \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{0.2} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-0.8}$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   The approximation relies on $\\epsilon$ being small. The formula becomes more accurate as $\\epsilon \\to 0$.\n*   The method correctly identifies the leading-order behavior. Higher-order terms in the approximation (e.g., constant term, or terms with other powers of $\\epsilon$) could be calculated using more advanced techniques like matched asymptotic expansions, but the leading term is typically what is required.\n*   The replacement of the upper integration limit from 15 to $\\infty$ is justified because the contribution from the tail end of the integral is of a lower order than the singular term we are calculating.\n*   The approximation of $h(x)$ by $9x^5$ is the crucial step. The neglected terms ($5x^6$, $9x^8$) lead to higher-order corrections in the asymptotic series for $I(\\epsilon)$.\n\n<<<$\\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$>>>"
