    "An involution in a group is an element `g` such that `g^2 = 1` and `g \\ne 1`. We want to find the number of involutions in the group `G = PSU(4, 997)`.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the group PSU(4, 997):**\n    The group is `PSU(n, q) = SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))`, where `SU(n, q)` is the Special Unitary Group and `Z` is its center.\n    Here, `n=4` and `q=997`.\n    The center `Z(SU(n, q))` consists of scalar matrices `cI` such that `c^{q+1}=1` and `c^n=1`. Its order is `d = \\gcd(n, q+1)`.\n    For our case, `d = \\gcd(4, 997+1) = \\gcd(4, 998)`. Since `998 = 2 \\cdot 499` and `4 = 2^2`, we have `d=2`.\n    Thus, `Z(SU(4, 997)) = \\{I, -I\\}`.\n    `PSU(4, 997) = SU(4, 997) / \\{I, -I\\}`.\n\n2.  **Relating involutions in PSU(n, q) to elements in SU(n, q):**\n    An element `g = A \\cdot Z` in `PSU(4, 997)` (where `A \\in SU(4, 997)` and `Z` is the center) is an involution if `g \\neq 1` (the identity coset) and `g^2 = 1`.\n    *   `g \\neq 1` means `A \\notin Z`. So `A \\neq I` and `A \\neq -I`.\n    *   `g^2 = (A \\cdot Z)^2 = A^2 \\cdot Z = Z`. This implies `A^2 \\in Z`.\n    So, we need to count elements `A \\in SU(4, 997)` such that `A^2 \\in \\{I, -I\\}` and `A \\notin \\{I, -I\\}`.\n    Let `S = \\{ A \\in SU(4, 997) \\mid A^2 \\in \\{I, -I\\} \\}`. The set of preimages of involutions in `PSU` is `S \\setminus Z`.\n    Since each involution in `PSU(4, 997)` corresponds to `|Z| = 2` distinct elements in `SU(4, 997)` (if `A` is a preimage, so is `-A`, and `A \\ne -A`), the number of involutions is `|S \\setminus Z| / |Z| = (|S| - 2) / 2`.\n    `S` is the disjoint union of `X_I = \\{ A \\mid A^2=I \\}` and `X_{-I} = \\{ A \\mid A^2=-I \\}`.\n    So the number of involutions is `( |X_I| + |X_{-I}| - 2 ) / 2`.\n\n3.  **Counting `|X_I| = |\\{ A \\in SU(4, q) \\mid A^2 = I \\}|$:**\n    Elements `A` with `A^2=I` are diagonalizable with eigenvalues `\\pm 1` (since `\\text{char} \\neq 2`). Let `k` be the multiplicity of the eigenvalue `-1`.\n    Since `A \\in SU(4, q)`, we must have `det(A)=1`. As `det(A) = (-1)^k`, `k` must be an even integer.\n    Also, `A` is determined by its `-1`-eigenspace `W_k`, which must be a non-degenerate subspace of dimension `k`.\n    The possible values for `k` are `0, 2, 4`.\n    *   `k=0`: `A` is the identity matrix `I`. This gives 1 element.\n    *   `k=4`: `A` is `-I`. `det(-I)=(-1)^4=1`, so `-I \\in SU(4,q)`. This gives 1 element.\n    *   `k=2`: `A` corresponds to a non-degenerate 2-dimensional subspace `W_2`. The number of such subspaces equals the number of these involutions. This number is given by the size of the corresponding conjugacy class in `GU(4,q)`, which is `|GU(4,q)| / |GU(2,q) \\times GU(2,q)|`.\n        Using the formula `|GU(m, q)| = q^{m(m-1)/2} \\prod_{i=1}^m (q^i - (-1)^i)`:\n        `|GU(2, q)| = q(q+1)(q^2-1)`\n        `|GU(4, q)| = q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`\n        The number of these involutions, let's call it `C_1`, is:\n        `C_1 = \\frac{q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{[q(q+1)(q^2-1)]^2} = q^4 \\frac{(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{(q+1)(q^2-1)} = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`.\n    So, `|X_I| = 1 + 1 + C_1 = C_1 + 2 = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + 2`.\n\n4.  **Counting `|X_{-I}| = |\\{ A \\in SU(4, q) \\mid A^2 = -I \\}|$:**\n    Eigenvalues of such `A` must be roots of `t^2=-1`, which we denote as `i, -i`. We need to check if these exist in `GF(q^2)`. They always do.\n    Crucially, we must know if they are in `GF(q)`. This depends on `q \\pmod 4`.\n    `q=997 = 4 \\cdot 249 + 1`, so `q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`. This implies that `-1` is a quadratic residue in `GF(q)`, so `i, -i \\in GF(q)`.\n    The eigenvalues of `A` are `\\{i, i, -i, -i\\}` to satisfy `det(A) = i^2(-i)^2=1`.\n    For `q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`, all elements `A` with `A^2=-I` form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4, q)`. The size of this class is `|SU(4,q)| / |C_{SU(4,q)}(A)|`.\n    The centralizer `C_{GU(4,q)}(A)` is isomorphic to `GL(2, q)`. `|GL(2,q)| = (q^2-1)(q^2-q) = q(q-1)(q^2-1)`.\n    The centralizer in `SU(4,q)` is `C_{SU(4,q)}(A) = C_{GU(4,q)}(A) \\cap SU(4,q)`.\n    For `h \\in C_{GU(4,q)}(A)` corresponding to `M \\in GL(2,q)`, `det(h) = (det(M))^2`. For `h` to be in `SU`, we need `(det(M))^2=1`, which implies `det(M) = \\pm 1`.\n    The number of matrices in `GL(2,q)` with determinant `1` is `|SL(2,q)| = q(q^2-1)`.\n    The number of matrices with determinant `-1` is also `|SL(2,q)|`.\n    So, `|C_{SU(4,q)}(A)| = 2 |SL(2,q)| = 2q(q^2-1)`.\n    The number of elements with `A^2=-I`, which we call `C_2`, is:\n    `C_2 = |X_{-I}| = \\frac{|SU(4,q)|}{2q(q^2-1)} = \\frac{q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{2q(q^2-1)} = \\frac{1}{2}q^5(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    The number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` is `N_{inv} = (|X_I| + |X_{-I}| - 2) / 2`.\n    `N_{inv} = ( (C_1 + 2) + C_2 - 2 ) / 2 = (C_1 + C_2) / 2`.\n    Substituting the expressions for `C_1` and `C_2` with `q=997`:\n    `N_{inv} = \\frac{1}{2} [q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + \\frac{1}{2}q^5(q^3+1)(q^4-1)]_{q=997}`.\n    Let's combine the terms into a single expression:\n    `N_{inv} = \\frac{1}{2} C_1 + \\frac{1}{2} C_2`\n    `= \\frac{1}{2}q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + \\frac{1}{4}q^5(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`\n    Factor out common terms:\n    `C_2 = \\frac{1}{2}q^5(q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2-1)(q^2+1) = \\frac{1}{2}q(q^2-1)(q+1) \\cdot C_1 / q^4` ... mistake in this line\n    Let's factor out `\\frac{1}{4}q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`\n    `N_{inv} = \\frac{1}{4}q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) [ 2 + q(q^3+1)(q^4-1)/( (q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) ) ]`\n    `N_{inv} = \\frac{1}{4}q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) [ 2 + q(q+1)(q^2-1) ]`\n    `N_{inv} = \\frac{1}{4}q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) [ 2 + q(q+1)^2(q-1) ]`\n    The term `q(q+1)^2(q-1)+2` can be expanded to `q(q^2-1)(q^2+2q+1)+2 ...` wait, `q(q^2-1)(q+1)+2 = q(q^3+q^2-q-1)+2 = q^4+q^3-q^2-q+2`.\n    So the final expression is:\n    `N_{inv} = \\frac{1}{4}q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)(q^4+q^3-q^2-q+2)`.\n    This is the number of involutions for `q=997`.\n\n<<<`1/4 * q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1) * (q^4 + q^3 - q^2 - q + 2)`, where `q = 997`.>>>"
