    "Answering this question requires classifying positive definite even lattices of a given dimension and determinant. This is a problem in the arithmetic theory of quadratic forms.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the object:** We are looking for the number of isomorphism classes of lattices $L$ that satisfy the following properties:\n    *   $L$ is a free $\\mathbb{Z}$-module of rank $n=17$.\n    *   $L$ is equipped with a symmetric bilinear form $B(x, y)$ that is positive definite (so the signature is $(17,0)$).\n    *   $L$ is an *even* lattice: $B(x,x) \\in 2\\mathbb{Z}$ for all $x \\in L$.\n    *   The determinant of the Gram matrix of $L$ is $\\det(L) = 2$.\n\n2.  **Genus vs. Class:** The classification of such lattices proceeds in two stages: first, group them into *genera*, and second, count the number of isomorphism *classes* within each genus. Two lattices are in the same genus if they are locally isomorphic everywhere (i.e., over the $p$-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ for all primes $p$, and over $\\mathbb{R}$).\n\n3.  **Local structure (determining the genera):**\n    *   For any prime $p$ that does not divide the determinant $d=2$, the localized lattice $L_p = L \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}_p$ must be unimodular. For $p \\neq 2$, $L_p$ is isomorphic to the standard lattice $I_{17}$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_p$.\n    *   The structure of $L_2 = L \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is crucial. Since $\\det(L) = 2$, the 2-adic valuation of the determinant is 1. The theory of Jordan decomposition for lattices over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ implies that $L_2$ must be an orthogonal sum of a unimodular part and a 2-modular part.\n        *   $L_2 \\cong U \\oplus M$, where $U$ is a unimodular $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-lattice and $M$ is a 2-modular $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-lattice.\n        *   The rank of $L_2$ is $n=17$.\n        *   The condition $\\nu_2(\\det L_2) = 1$ forces the unimodular part $U$ to have rank 16 and the 2-modular part $M$ to have rank 1. So, $L_2 \\cong U_{16} \\oplus M_1$.\n        *   Since $L$ is an even lattice, $L_2$ must be an even lattice over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. This implies that its unimodular part, $U_{16}$, must be an even unimodular lattice. Over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, an even unimodular lattice must have even rank, which 16 is. There are two non-isomorphic even unimodular lattices of rank 16 over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. These are distinguished by their \"type\" or Arf invariant. Let's call them Type I (built from hyperbolic planes $U$) and Type II (built from copies of the $E_8$ lattice form).\n        *   The 2-modular part, $M_1$, has rank 1. Its Gram matrix is of the form $\\langle 2u \\rangle$ where $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2^\\times$ is a 2-adic unit.\n    *   **Constraint from the determinant:** The determinant of $L$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is 2. So the determinant of $L_2$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ is in the square class of 2.\n        *   $\\det(L_2) = \\det(U_{16}) \\cdot \\det(M_1) = \\det(U_{16}) \\cdot 2u$.\n        *   The determinant of any even unimodular lattice of rank 16 over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ (both Type I and Type II) is a 2-adic unit which is $\\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$.\n        *   So $\\det(L_2) = 1 \\cdot 2u = 2u$. For this to be in the same square class as 2, the unit $u$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. A unit is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ if and only if it is congruent to $1 \\pmod 8$.\n        *   This severely restricts the possibilities for $M_1$. Its Gram matrix must be $\\langle 2u \\rangle$ with $u \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$. Over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, all such lattices are isomorphic to the one with matrix $\\langle 2 \\rangle$.\n    *   **Constraint from the signature:** The signature $\\sigma=17$ must be compatible with the local structures. A fundamental theorem states that the signature of an even lattice is congruent modulo 8 to the signature of its discriminant quadratic form, $\\sigma \\equiv \\text{sign}(q_L) \\pmod 8$.\n        *   Our lattice is positive definite, so its signature is $\\sigma=17 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$.\n        *   The discriminant form $q_L$ acts on the discriminant group $L^\\#/L \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. Its structure is determined by the local data at $p=2$, specifically by $u$. The signature of the discriminant form for $q_L(g) \\propto u/2$ is 1 if $u \\equiv 1,5 \\pmod 8$ and -1 if $u \\equiv 3,7 \\pmod 8$.\n        *   The condition $\\sigma \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$ requires $\\text{sign}(q_L)=1$. This implies $u \\equiv 1$ or $5 \\pmod 8$.\n    *   Combining the constraints from the determinant ($u \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$) and the signature ($u \\equiv 1$ or $5 \\pmod 8$), we find that we must have $u \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$.\n    *   **Conclusion on Genera:** The above constraints are all consistent. There are exactly two possible genera for such a lattice, corresponding to the two possible types (I or II) for the 16-dimensional unimodular part of its 2-adic completion $L_2$.\n\n4.  **Counting the Classes within Each Genus:** The final step is to find the number of isomorphism classes (the \"class number\") for each of these two genera. This is a difficult computation that requires advanced techniques (like Kneser's method of neighboring lattices) or consulting existing classifications.\n    *   **Genus I:** This genus corresponds to the 2-adic structure $L_2 \\cong (8U) \\oplus \\langle 2 \\rangle$. The integral lattices in this genus are related to the unimodular lattice $D_{16}^+$. The class number for this genus is known to be 1. The only class is the decomposable lattice $D_{16}^+ \\oplus A_1$, where $A_1$ is the rank 1 lattice with Gram matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   **Genus II:** This genus corresponds to the 2-adic structure $L_2 \\cong (2E_8) \\oplus \\langle 2 \\rangle$. The integral lattices are related to the root lattice $E_8$. The class number for this genus is known to be 2. One class is the decomposable lattice $(E_8 \\oplus E_8) \\oplus A_1$. The other class is an indecomposable lattice.\n\n5.  **Final Count:** Adding the number of classes in each genus gives the total number of non-isomorphic lattices.\n    Total number = (Class number of Genus I) + (Class number of Genus II) = $1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nThus, there are 3 such lattices. They are:\n1.  $D_{16}^+ \\oplus A_1$\n2.  $(E_8 \\oplus E_8) \\oplus A_1$\n3.  An indecomposable lattice in the same genus as the second one."
