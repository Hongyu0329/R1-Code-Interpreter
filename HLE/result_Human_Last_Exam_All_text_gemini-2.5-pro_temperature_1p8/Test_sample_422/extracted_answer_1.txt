The two problems the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition runs into are:

1.  **The Problem of Circularity/Contradiction:** The JTB definition states that Belief is a necessary component of Knowledge. However, the constraint establishes Knowledge and Belief as two mutually exclusive epistemic states. This creates a paradox: to attain the state of Knowledge, one must possess a belief, but being in the state of "Belief" prevents one from being in the state of "Knowledge". This makes Knowledge logically unattainable.

2.  **The Problem of Problematic Equivalence:** Since the state of "Belief" is defined as any epistemic state that is not "Knowledge," it lumps together fundamentally different situations. Specifically, a **Justified False Belief** (a rational mistake) and an **Unjustified True Belief** (a lucky guess) are both categorized simply as "Belief." This makes the two states epistemically equivalent, failing to distinguish between a failure of justification and a failure of truth, which is a critical flaw for an epistemic framework.
