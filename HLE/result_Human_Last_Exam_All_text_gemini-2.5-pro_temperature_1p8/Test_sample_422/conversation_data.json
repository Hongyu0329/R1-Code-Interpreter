    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Premises:**\n    *   **The Theory of Knowledge:** We must use the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition, where Knowledge (K) is equivalent to having a Belief (B) that is both Justified (J) and True (T). So, K = J ∧ T ∧ B.\n    *   **The World Model Constraint:** The universe of possible epistemic states (a person's mental stance towards a proposition) is limited to only two: \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\". This implies that for any proposition, a person is either in the state of Knowing it or in the state of Believing it.\n    *   **The Exclusion:** We must ignore Gettier problems. This means we should not focus on cases where J, T, and B are all present, but intuition suggests it isn't knowledge due to epistemic luck. Instead, we must find other flaws in the JTB framework under the given constraint.\n\n2.  **Analyze the \"Two States\" Constraint:**\n    *   The statement that \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" are the only two available states suggests they are mutually exclusive. If one has Knowledge, one does not *merely* have Belief. If a person's state is \"Belief\", it is by definition \"Not-Knowledge\". This mutual exclusivity is central to the problems that arise.\n\n3.  **Find the First Problem: The Contradiction of the Belief Condition**\n    *   **Premise 1 (from JTB):** To have Knowledge, you must have Belief. Belief is a necessary condition for Knowledge (K → B).\n    *   **Premise 2 (from the constraint):** Knowledge and Belief are mutually exclusive states. If you are in the state of Knowledge, you are not in the state of Belief (K → ¬B_state), and vice versa.\n    *   **The Conflict:** This creates a logical contradiction or circularity. The JTB definition requires a person to have a \"belief\" as a component to achieve \"Knowledge\". However, the world model states that if a person's state *is* \"Belief\", they cannot have \"Knowledge\". Therefore, the very prerequisite for entering the state of Knowledge (having a belief) simultaneously disqualifies one from being in that state. Knowledge becomes logically impossible to attain in this system.\n\n4.  **Find the Second Problem: The Coarse-Graining of Non-Knowledge**\n    *   **Defining \"Belief\":** Given the constraint, the state of \"Belief\" encompasses all epistemic stances that fail to meet the JTB criteria for Knowledge. A failure to meet `J ∧ T ∧ B` means having at least one of the following: a lack of Justification (¬J) or a lack of Truth (¬T). (A lack of belief, ¬B, means the person has no stance, so we focus on cases where a belief is held).\n    *   **Consider two distinct scenarios that are not Knowledge:**\n        *   **Scenario A (Rational Error):** A person holds a Justified but False belief. For example, they rationally conclude something based on strong evidence, but the conclusion happens to be wrong. This is a (J ∧ ¬T ∧ B) case.\n        *   **Scenario B (Lucky Guess):** A person holds an Unjustified but True belief. For example, they win the lottery based on a random guess. This is a (¬J ∧ T ∧ B) case.\n    *   **The Problem:** The JTB framework, when combined with the two-state constraint, forces both of these radically different situations into the single category of \"Belief\". It renders a rational error epistemically equivalent to a lucky guess. This lumping together, or \"coarse-graining,\" is a significant problem because it loses the crucial distinction between being rational (justification) and being correct (truth). Any useful epistemic model should be able to differentiate between a reasonable mistake and a dumb luck success, but this model cannot.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<\nThe two problems the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition runs into are:\n\n1.  **The Problem of Circularity/Contradiction:** The JTB definition states that Belief is a necessary component of Knowledge. However, the constraint establishes Knowledge and Belief as two mutually exclusive epistemic states. This creates a paradox: to attain the state of Knowledge, one must possess a belief, but being in the state of \"Belief\" prevents one from being in the state of \"Knowledge\". This makes Knowledge logically unattainable.\n\n2.  **The Problem of Problematic Equivalence:** Since the state of \"Belief\" is defined as any epistemic state that is not \"Knowledge,\" it lumps together fundamentally different situations. Specifically, a **Justified False Belief** (a rational mistake) and an **Unjustified True Belief** (a lucky guess) are both categorized simply as \"Belief.\" This makes the two states epistemically equivalent, failing to distinguish between a failure of justification and a failure of truth, which is a critical flaw for an epistemic framework.\n>>>"
