    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concept: Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL)**\nTrisyllabic Laxing is a specific historical sound change in English. It has three main conditions:\n1.  It applies to a word that has **three or more syllables**.\n2.  It affects a **tense (long) vowel**.\n3.  That tense vowel must be in the **antepenultimate syllable** (the third syllable from the end of the word).\nWhen these conditions are met, the tense vowel becomes **lax (short)**. A classic example is the change from *ser**e**ne* (/iː/, a tense vowel) to *ser**e**nity* (/ɛ/, a lax vowel), where the 'e' is in the third-to-last syllable.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each word based on the TSL rule**\nWe need to determine if each word shows evidence of this process. This usually involves comparing the word to a related base word with a tense vowel.\n\n*   **derivative**:\n    *   **Syllables:** de-riv-a-tive (4 syllables).\n    *   **Related Word:** *derive* (pronounced /dɪˈraɪv/). The vowel in the stressed syllable is /aɪ/, which is a tense diphthong.\n    *   **Analysis:** In *derivative* (/dɪˈrɪvətɪv/), the corresponding syllable is \"-riv-\", which is the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable. The vowel has changed from tense /aɪ/ to lax /ɪ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This word **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**:\n    *   **Syllables:** se-ren-i-ty (4 syllables).\n    *   **Related Word:** *serene* (pronounced /səˈriːn/). The vowel is /iː/, which is tense.\n    *   **Analysis:** In *serenity* (/səˈrɛnɪti/), the corresponding syllable \"-ren-\" is antepenultimate. The vowel has changed from tense /iː/ to lax /ɛ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This word **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **gratitude**:\n    *   **Syllables:** grat-i-tude (3 syllables).\n    *   **Related Word:** The root is related to words like *grateful* or *grade*, which have a tense vowel /eɪ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** In *gratitude* (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/), the first syllable \"grat-\" is antepenultimate. The vowel /æ/ is the lax counterpart to the tense /eɪ/ in the root.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This word **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **southern**:\n    *   **Syllables:** south-ern (2 syllables).\n    *   **Related Word:** *south* (/saʊθ/). The vowel is a tense diphthong /aʊ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** The derived word *southern* only has two syllables. The rule for TSL requires an antepenultimate syllable, which a two-syllable word does not have.\n    *   **Conclusion:** While vowel shortening has occurred (/aʊ/ -> /ʌ/), it is not due to trisyllabic laxing. This word **has not** undergone TSL.\n\n*   **pleasant**:\n    *   **Syllables:** pleas-ant (2 syllables).\n    *   **Related Word:** *please* (/pliːz/). The vowel is tense /iː/.\n    *   **Analysis:** *pleasant* is a two-syllable word and does not have an antepenultimate syllable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Like *southern*, it shows vowel shortening (/iː/ -> /ɛ/) but **has not** undergone TSL.\n\n*   **shadow**:\n    *   **Syllables:** shad-ow (2 syllables).\n    *   **Related Word:** *shade* (/ʃeɪd/). The vowel is a tense diphthong /eɪ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** *shadow* is a two-syllable word and does not have an antepenultimate syllable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This word **has not** undergone TSL.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve the ambiguity**\nWe have three words that have not undergone *trisyllabic laxing*: `southern`, `pleasant`, and `shadow`. Since the question asks for a single answer, there must be a deeper distinction. The question is about sound **development**. Let's look at the history.\n\n*   `southern` and `pleasant` both exhibit a lax vowel that resulted from the **shortening/laxing** of a historically long vowel (from *sūth* and related to *plēsen*). So, while it's not TSL, a laxing process did occur.\n*   `shadow`, however, is different. It comes from the Old English word *sceadu*, where the vowel 'a' was already **short**. The related word *shade* comes from a different Old English word, *scead*, which had a long vowel. Therefore, the vowel in *shadow* was never long to begin with, so it could not have been \"laxed\" or \"shortened\". It simply inherited its short vowel.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nOf all the words listed, `shadow` is the only one whose relevant vowel did not become lax through a shortening process from a long vowel at any point in its history. The other words either underwent Trisyllabic Laxing specifically, or a different kind of vowel shortening. Thus, `shadow` is the word that most definitively has not undergone this type of sound development.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
