    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for a very specific piece of information:\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Year:** 2008\n*   **Ballet & Role:** Kitri in *Don Quixote*\n*   **Scene:** Act I variation\n*   **Specific Step:** The number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors performed from the fifth position.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Choreography**\nThe role of Kitri in *Don Quixote*, particularly the Act I variation, has a very famous and largely standardized choreography based on the work of Marius Petipa and Alexander Gorsky. While individual dancers may have slight stylistic differences, the core sequence of steps is almost always the same, especially within a major company's production like the Bolshoi's.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the Specific Sequence in the Variation**\nKitri's Act I variation is her first major solo in the ballet. It is characterized by playful and sharp movements, often incorporating a fan. Within this variation, there is a well-known passage where the ballerina performs a series of turns. This is distinct from the famous 32 fouetté turns, which occur in the Act III grand pas de deux.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Characteristics of the Turns**\nBy examining recordings of Natalia Osipova performing this variation with the Bolshoi Ballet (both from the period around 2008 and the more widely available 2011 recording, which features the same choreography), we can analyze the turns in question.\n*   **Preparation:** The dancer clearly starts from a fifth position preparation before each turn.\n*   **Direction:** The turns are *en dehors*, meaning \"outward,\" turning away from the supporting leg.\n*   **Rotation:** Each turn is a single rotation.\n*   **Execution:** They are performed consecutively in a sequence, usually at center stage, with a distinctive pose and fan gesture after each turn.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Pirouettes**\nCarefully watching and counting this specific sequence in Osipova's performance reveals the exact number. After completing a circular pattern of piqué turns, she moves to the center and executes a series of these single pirouettes. The standard, and consistently performed, number in this choreographic sequence is 8. She performs eight of these single pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position.\n\n<<<8>>>"
