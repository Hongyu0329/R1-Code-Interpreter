No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not considered radial; it follows the Parker Spiral, which is typically angled at about 45 degrees to the radial direction. The reason for using magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (e.g., Y and Z in a GSE or RTN coordinate system) to calculate helicity is not based on the magnetic field's direction, but on the **solar wind's velocity direction**.

The justification is as follows:
1.  **Taylor's Hypothesis:** To analyze the spatial structure of waves from a single point time-series measurement, scientists use Taylor's "frozen-in" hypothesis, which assumes the wave structure is swept past the spacecraft by the solar wind.
2.  **Radial Flow:** The solar wind velocity is almost perfectly radial from the Sun.
3.  **Coordinate System Choice:** It is therefore standard practice to align one axis of the analysis coordinate system with the radial flow direction. The helicity is then calculated in the plane perpendicular to this axis.

This method is a practical convenience, not a statement of ideal physics. It is a good approximation only when the magnetic field itself happens to be aligned with the radial flow. The most accurate method for a single wave event is to use Minimum Variance Analysis (MVA) to find the wave's own propagation direction and calculate helicity in the plane perpendicular to that direction.
