    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Question**\nThe question asks for the specific range of verses (bayt) in the poem *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* where the names of the prophets of Islam are mentioned. *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* is a well-known didactic poem that summarizes the essential articles of faith in Sunni Islam for the \"layman\".\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Relevant Section of the Poem**\nOne of the core articles of Islamic faith is the belief in all the prophets (*rusul* and *anbiya'*). Islamic theology commonly requires knowing the 25 prophets mentioned by name in the Qur'an. Therefore, we should expect a section in the poem dedicated to listing these names. We need to find the text of the poem and locate these verses.\n\n**Step 3: Examining the Verses Preceding the List**\nBefore the list of names begins, there is often an introductory verse that sets the stage. Let's look at the standard numbering of the poem:\n*   **Bayt 28:**\n    تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ  ۞  كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    *Translation:* The details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding upon every accountable person, so verify and seize [this knowledge].\n*   **Careful Point:** This verse states that 25 prophets will be detailed. It introduces the topic but does *not* contain any of their names. Therefore, it is the prelude to the list, not the beginning of the list of names itself.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the Verses that Contain the Names**\nWe will now examine the verses that follow Bayt 28, where the names are explicitly enumerated.\n\n*   **Bayt 29:**\n    فَهُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ  ۞  صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُّتَّبَعْ\n    *Translation:* They are: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim - each is to be followed.\n    * **Analysis:** This is the first verse that begins the actual enumeration of the prophets' names. It lists 6 prophets.\n\n*   **Bayt 30:**\n    لُوْطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيْلُ إِسْحَاقُ كَذَا  ۞  يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى\n    *Translation:* Lut and Isma'il, Ishaq as well; Ya'qub, Yusuf and Ayyub, whose example is followed.\n    * **Analysis:** This verse continues the list with another 6 prophets.\n\n*   **Bayt 31:**\n    شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ  ۞  ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\n    *Translation:* Shu'ayb, Harun, and Musa, and al-Yasa'; Dhu'l-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman followed.\n    * **Analysis:** This verse continues the list with 7 more prophets.\n\n*   **Bayt 32:**\n    إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى  ۞  عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n    *Translation:* Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya; 'Isa and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ), the Seal [of the Prophets], so leave deviation.\n    * **Analysis:** This verse concludes the list with the final 6 prophets, ending with Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, and confirming his status as the final prophet.\n\n**Step 5: Examining the Verse Following the List**\nLet's check the verse that comes immediately after the list to confirm the section has ended.\n\n*   **Bayt 33:**\n    عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ  ۞  وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ\n    *Translation:* Upon them be peace and blessings, and upon their families, for as long as the days endure.\n*   **Careful Point:** This verse is a concluding prayer of peace and blessings upon the prophets just mentioned. It is not part of the list of names.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nThe question asks for the range of verses where the *names* are mentioned. Based on the step-by-step examination:\n-   Bayt 28 is an introduction to the list.\n-   Bayt 29 is the first verse to mention names.\n-   Bayt 32 is the last verse to mention names.\n-   Bayt 33 is a concluding prayer after the list has finished.\n\nTherefore, the names of the prophets are explicitly mentioned from Bayt 29 to Bayt 32.\n\n<<<From bayt 29 to bayt 32.>>>"
