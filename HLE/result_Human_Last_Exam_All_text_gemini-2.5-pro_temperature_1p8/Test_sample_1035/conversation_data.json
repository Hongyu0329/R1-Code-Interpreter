    "This problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices required for a family of bipartite graphs to cover all edges of a complete graph $K_n$ with $n=35$. This is a classic problem in extremal graph theory.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Formalizing the problem:**\n    Let $V_n$ be the set of $n$ vertices of the complete graph $K_n$. We want to find the smallest integer $m$ for which there exists a set of vertices $W$ with $|W| = m$, a family of bipartite graphs $\\mathcal{H} = \\{H_1, H_2, \\ldots, H_k\\}$, and an identification of $V_n$ with a subset of $W$, such that:\n    *   The vertex set of each graph $H_i$ is a subset of $W$, i.e., $V(H_i) \\subseteq W$.\n    *   The union of the edge sets of the graphs in $\\mathcal{H}$ covers all edges of $K_n$. That is, for every pair of distinct vertices $\\{u, v\\} \\subseteq V_n$, the edge $(u,v)$ is present in at least one of the graphs $H_i$.\n    *   It is standard in this context to assume the bipartite graphs are complete bipartite (bicliques). Let $H_i = K_{A_i, B_i}$, where $A_i$ and $B_i$ are disjoint subsets of $W$. An edge $(u,v)$ is in $H_i$ if one vertex is in $A_i$ and the other is in $B_i$.\n\n2.  **Relating to a known theorem:**\n    This problem was solved by G. Hansel in 1964. He determined the maximum number of vertices, $n$, of a complete graph $K_n$ that can be covered by a family of bipartite graphs on a set of $m$ vertices. Let's denote this maximum number by $f(m)$. The theorem states:\n    $f(m) = \\max \\left\\{ \\prod_{i=1}^p k_i \\right\\}$\n    where the maximum is taken over all partitions of the integer $m$ into a sum of positive integers, i.e., $m = k_1 + k_2 + \\dots + k_p$ with $k_i \\ge 1$.\n\n3.  **Solving the inverse problem:**\n    The question asks for the minimum $m$ required for $n=35$. This is the inverse problem: we need to find the smallest integer $m$ such that $f(m) \\ge 35$.\n\n4.  **Maximizing the product for a fixed sum:**\n    To find the value of $f(m)$, we need to find the partition of $m$ that maximizes the product of its parts. The principles for this optimization are:\n    *   The parts $k_i$ should be as close to the base of the natural logarithm, $e \\approx 2.718$, as possible. For integers, this means using only parts of size 2 and 3.\n    *   Any part of size 4 can be replaced by two parts of size 2, keeping the sum the same ($4=2+2$) and the product the same ($4=2\\times2$).\n    *   Any part $k_i \\ge 5$ can be replaced by smaller parts (e.g., $5$ by $2+3$, product $6 > 5$) to increase the product while keeping the sum fixed.\n    *   Using as many 3s as possible is optimal because $3 \\times 3 = 9$ is greater than $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$ for the same sum of 6.\n\n    So, to calculate $f(m)$, we express $m$ in the form $m = 3q + r$, where $r \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n    *   If $m = 3q$ (remainder is 0), the optimal partition is $q$ threes. $f(m) = 3^q$.\n    *   If $m = 3q + 1$ (remainder is 1), it's better to have $(q-1)$ threes and two twos instead of $(q-1)$ threes, one three, and one one. So, $m = 3(q-1)+4 = 3(q-1)+2+2$. $f(m) = 3^{q-1} \\times 2^2 = 4 \\cdot 3^{q-1}$.\n    *   If $m = 3q + 2$ (remainder is 2), the optimal partition is $q$ threes and one two. $f(m) = 3^q \\times 2$.\n\n5.  **Calculating $f(m)$ for successive values of $m$:**\n    We can now compute $f(m)$ for small values of $m$ and find the first value for which $f(m) \\ge 35$.\n    *   $f(1) = 1$\n    *   $f(2) = 2$\n    *   $f(3) = 3$\n    *   $f(4) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$\n    *   $f(5) = 3 \\times 2 = 6$\n    *   $f(6) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$\n    *   $f(7) = 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 12$\n    *   $f(8) = 3 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 18$\n    *   $f(9) = 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27$\n    *   $f(10) = 3 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 36$ (or using the formula for $m=10=3 \\cdot 3 + 1$: $f(10)=4 \\cdot 3^{3-1}=4 \\cdot 9=36$)\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    From the calculations, we see that for $m=9$ vertices, we can cover at most $K_{27}$. Since $27 < 35$, we need more vertices. For $m=10$ vertices, we can cover up to $K_{36}$. Since $36 \\ge 35$, it is possible to cover $K_{35}$ with a family of bipartite graphs on 10 vertices. Therefore, the minimum number of vertices required is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
