    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\nFirst, we need to define the terms used in the question accurately.\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a non-empty, compact, and connected topological space. The parenthetical remark \"(not necessarily metric)\" is crucial, as it specifies that the space must be a compact, connected Hausdorff space, not necessarily a metric space. Most standard continuum theory is developed for metric spaces, so this generalization is important.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is called indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua. A subcontinuum is any subspace that is itself a continuum (i.e., closed and connected).\n*   **Composant:** For a point $p$ in a continuum $X$, the composant of $p$, denoted $C(p)$, is the set of all points $x \\in X$ for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $p$ and $x$. Essentially, a composant is the union of all proper subcontinua that contain a given point.\n\nThe question asks for the **smallest possible number of composants** that an indecomposable continuum can have.\n\n### Step 2: Properties of Composants in Indecomposable Continua\n\nTo answer the question, we need to leverage some fundamental theorems about the structure of indecomposable continua and their composants.\n\n1.  **Partition Property:** For any continuum $X$, the collection of its composants forms a partition of $X$. This means that any two distinct composants are disjoint, and their union is the entire space $X$.\n2.  **Density Property:** In an *indecomposable* continuum, every composant is a dense subset of the space.\n3.  **Nowhere Dense Subcontinua:** A key theorem states that in an indecomposable continuum, every proper subcontinuum is nowhere dense (i.e., its closure has an empty interior).\n\n### Step 3: Analysis for Metric Continua\n\nLet's first consider the more common case of a **metric continuum**. This case is illuminating because it reveals a famous paradox and its resolution.\n\n*   **A Flawed Argument for Countability:** If we take a metric continuum $X$, it must be separable. Let $D$ be a countable dense subset of $X$. Since every composant is dense, it might seem that every composant must intersect $D$. As the composants are disjoint, we could map each composant to a point in $D$ that it contains, implying there can be at most a countable number of them. However, this reasoning is flawed. A dense set does not necessarily intersect every other dense set. For instance, in the real numbers, the set of irrational numbers is dense but is disjoint from the countable dense set of rational numbers. So this argument fails.\n\n*   **A Correct Argument for Uncountability (Baire Category Theorem):** The correct approach for metric spaces uses the Baire Category Theorem (BCT).\n    1.  Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that an indecomposable metric continuum $X$ has a countable number of composants, $\\{C_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$. Thus, $X = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n$.\n    2.  In a metric continuum, each composant $C_n$ can be shown to be an $F_{\\sigma}$ set (a countable union of closed sets). Specifically, $C_n = \\bigcup_{k=1}^{\\infty} K_{nk}$, where each $K_{nk}$ is a proper subcontinuum.\n    3.  Substituting this into the union for $X$, we get $X = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\bigcup_{k=1}^{\\infty} K_{nk}$. This expresses $X$ as a countable union of the closed sets $K_{nk}$.\n    4.  As established earlier, each $K_{nk}$ is a proper subcontinuum of an indecomposable continuum, which means it is a closed, nowhere dense set.\n    5.  Therefore, $X$ is represented as a countable union of nowhere dense sets. Such a set is called a **meager set** (or a set of the first category).\n    6.  However, a compact metric space is a complete metric space. The Baire Category Theorem states that a non-empty complete metric space cannot be meager; it must be non-meager (of the second category).\n    7.  This is a contradiction. The initial assumption that the number of composants is countable must be false.\n\nThis proves that any indecomposable *metric* continuum must have an **uncountable** number of composants. In fact, a stronger result by S. Mazurkiewicz shows that the number of composants is always exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum ($2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n\n### Step 4: Extending to Non-Metric Continua\n\nThe question explicitly states \"not necessarily metric\". We must check if the result holds for the broader class of compact, connected, Hausdorff spaces.\n\n*   The BCT argument presented above relies on the property that composants are $F_{\\sigma}$ sets. The proof of this property typically uses the metrizability of the space and is not guaranteed to hold in a general compact Hausdorff setting.\n*   Therefore, a different line of reasoning is required to handle the non-metric case. This is a non-trivial problem in topology.\n*   The definitive answer was provided by S. Mardešić in a 1960 paper (\"On the number of composants of indecomposable continua\"). He generalized Mazurkiewicz's result and proved that **any indecomposable continuum (metric or not) has exactly $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nSince every indecomposable continuum, regardless of whether it is metric, has a fixed number of composants ($\\mathfrak{c}$), the smallest number of composants it can have is this number itself.\n\nThe smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n\n<<<C>>>"
