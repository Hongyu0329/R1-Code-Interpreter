    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial sequence**\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\nLet's denote the terms as `a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, ...`\nSo, `a_1 = 2`, `a_2 = 11`, `a_3 = 23`, `a_4 = 51`, `a_5 = 119`.\n\n**Step 2: Look for a simple relationship between consecutive terms**\nLet's try to find a pattern based on multiplication and addition/subtraction. A common pattern is `a_n = k * a_{n-1} + C`. Let's test with `k=2`.\n*   For `a_2`: `2 * a_1` = `2 * 2` = 4. To get 11, we need to add 7. So, `a_2 = 2 * a_1 + 7`.\n*   For `a_3`: `2 * a_2` = `2 * 11` = 22. To get 23, we need to add 1. So, `a_3 = 2 * a_2 + 1`.\n*   For `a_4`: `2 * a_3` = `2 * 23` = 46. To get 51, we need to add 5. So, `a_4 = 2 * a_3 + 5`.\n*   For `a_5`: `2 * a_4` = `2 * 51` = 102. To get 119, we need to add 17. So, `a_5 = 2 * a_4 + 17`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the derived sequence of added numbers**\nThe relationship seems to be `a_n = 2 * a_{n-1} + c_n`, where `c_n` is the sequence of numbers we added in each step.\nThe sequence `c` is: {7, 1, 5, 17, ...}.\nThe next term in the original sequence will be `a_6 = 2 * a_5 + c_6 = 2 * 119 + c_6`. We need to find the next term in the `c` sequence, `c_6`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the pattern within the `c` sequence**\nLet's examine the `c` sequence: 7, 1, 5, 17, ...\nThe first term, 7, seems to be an exception. Let's analyze the sequence starting from the second term: {1, 5, 17, ...}. Let's call this sequence `c'`.\nLet's find the difference between consecutive terms in `c'`.\n*   `5 - 1 = 4`\n*   `17 - 5 = 12`\n\n**Step 5: Find the pattern within the differences of the `c'` sequence**\nThe sequence of differences is {4, 12, ...}.\nWe can observe a clear pattern here: this is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 to get the next term.\n*   `4 * 3 = 12`\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next difference should be:\n*   `12 * 3 = 36`\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the next term in the `c'` sequence (and thus the `c` sequence)**\nThe next term in the sequence of differences is 36. We add this to the last term of the `c'` sequence (which is 17) to find the next term.\n*   Next term of `c'` = `17 + 36 = 53`.\nThis is our `c_6`.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final answer**\nNow we have all the pieces to find the missing number in the original sequence, `a_6`.\n*   `a_6 = 2 * a_5 + c_6`\n*   `a_6 = 2 * 119 + 53`\n*   `a_6 = 238 + 53`\n*   `a_6 = 291`\n\nThe number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
