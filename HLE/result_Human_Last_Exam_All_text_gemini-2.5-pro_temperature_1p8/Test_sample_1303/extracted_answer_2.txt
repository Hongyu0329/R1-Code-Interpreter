**1. Small Molecules targeting the Main Protease (Mpro/3CLpro):**
*   **Nirmatrelvir (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4596434):** Forms a strong inhibitory interaction with Mpro, a key enzyme for viral replication. It has a measured inhibition constant (Ki) of 3.1 nM, indicating very high potency.
*   **Ensitrelvir (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4790074):** Forms a potent inhibitory interaction with Mpro. It has a measured half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 13 nM.
*   **Boceprevir (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL1650):** Forms a moderate inhibitory interaction with Mpro, with a reported IC50 of 1.63 µM, demonstrating a lower potency compared to specifically designed inhibitors like Nirmatrelvir.

**2. Small Molecules targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp):**
*   **Remdesivir (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4077659):** This is a prodrug. Its active triphosphate metabolite is the ligand that directly interacts with and inhibits the RdRp enzyme, terminating viral RNA synthesis. Its cell-based antiviral activity (EC50) is 0.77 µM.
*   **Molnupiravir (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4296229):** This is also a prodrug whose active triphosphate form interacts with the RdRp. It gets incorporated into the viral RNA and causes catastrophic mutations, inhibiting replication. Its cell-based antiviral activity (EC50) is 0.3 µM.
