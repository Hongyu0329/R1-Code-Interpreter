    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the value used to compute Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the specific name of the \"value between heartbeats\" that is captured using PPG and used to calculate HRV. This \"value\" is a measurement of time.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement Process:**\n    *   **PPG (Photoplethysmography):** This technology, used in smartwatches and fitness trackers, shines a light through the skin to measure changes in blood volume. Each time the heart beats, it pushes a pulse of blood through the vessels, causing them to expand. The PPG sensor detects this expansion as a \"pulse wave\" or \"beat.\"\n    *   **Beat-to-Beat Interval:** The core measurement captured is the time duration from the peak of one pulse wave to the peak of the very next one. This is the \"beat-to-beat interval.\"\n\n3.  **Define Heart Rate Variability (HRV):**\n    *   HRV is not the interval itself, but rather the measurement of the *variation* in a sequence of these consecutive beat-to-beat intervals. For example, a device will record a series of intervals like 850ms, 875ms, 840ms, 860ms, etc. HRV is a statistical analysis (e.g., standard deviation) of this sequence of numbers.\n\n4.  **Identify the Terminology for the Interval:**\n    *   The crucial piece of data—the time between two consecutive heartbeats—has several names depending on the context and technology.\n    *   **From ECG (Electrocardiogram):** The gold standard for heart rhythm measurement is the ECG. On an ECG waveform, the most prominent spike representing the main heartbeat contraction is called the \"R-wave.\" Therefore, the time between two consecutive R-waves is called the **R-R Interval**. This is the most common and standard term in scientific and medical literature.\n    *   **General/Technology-Agnostic Term:** A more general term for this measurement, regardless of the technology used (ECG, PPG, etc.), is the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**.\n    *   **From PPG (as per the question):** Since PPG measures the peak of a pulse wave, the term **Peak-to-Peak Interval (PPI)** is also technically correct and specific to this technology.\n\n5.  **Conclusion and Careful Points:**\n    *   **Key Point 1:** Although the data is captured by PPG, the term **R-R Interval** (borrowed from ECG terminology) is the most widely used and recognized name for the beat-to-beat interval in the context of HRV analysis.\n    *   **Key Point 2:** **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)** is also a very common and correct answer. It is more general than \"R-R Interval.\"\n    *   **Key Point 3:** The question asks for the name of the *value* itself. This value is the time duration, measured in milliseconds (ms). The sequence of these time durations is the raw data used to compute higher-level HRV metrics (like RMSSD, SDNN, etc.).\n\nTherefore, the most precise and standard answer for the \"value between heartbeats\" is the R-R Interval.\n\n<<<R-R Interval (or Inter-beat Interval)"
