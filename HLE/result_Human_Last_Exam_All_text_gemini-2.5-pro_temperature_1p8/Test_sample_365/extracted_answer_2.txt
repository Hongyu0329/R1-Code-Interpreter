The product is the tricyclic ketone formed via an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement of the starting material. Key structural features of the product are: 1) The tertiary alcohol at C2 is converted to a ketone. 2) The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton is rearranged: the C1-C2 bond is broken, and a new C-C bond is formed between the original C5 and C2' of the cyclopentenyl group. 3) The double bond in the norbornene moiety moves from the C5=C6 position to the C1=C6 position. 4) The double bond of the original cyclopentenyl group is no longer present. 5) The TBS silyl ether and the 7,7-dimethoxy ketal protecting groups remain intact. The overall reaction is a skeletal isomerization.
