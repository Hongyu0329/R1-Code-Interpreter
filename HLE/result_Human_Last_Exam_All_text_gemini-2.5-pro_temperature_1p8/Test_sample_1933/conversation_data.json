    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the components of the question\n\n1.  **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates, let's call them $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A unary predicate is a property that an element of the domain can either possess or not. For any element `a` from the universe, $P_i(a)$ is either true or false. This means any element can be characterized by a 4-bit binary vector representing the truth values of the four predicates for that element. For example, an element `a` might have the type $(true, false, true, false)$, meaning $P_1(a)$ and $P_3(a)$ are true, while $P_2(a)$ and $P_4(a)$ are false. There are $2^4 = 16$ such possible types.\n\n2.  **The Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of First-Order Logic. The formulas in this language are built using:\n    *   **Atomic formulas**: $P_i(v)$ where $v$ is a variable.\n    *   **Connectives**: Conjunction ($\\land$).\n    *   **Quantifiers**: Existential quantifier ($\\exists$).\n    *   **Constants**: True ($\\top$) and False ($\\bot$).\n    The question asks for the VC dimension of this language, which means we are interested in formulas with one free variable, say `x`, which act as classifiers on the elements of the universe. A formula $\\phi(x)$ classifies an element `a` as 'positive' if the model satisfies $\\phi(a)$, and 'negative' otherwise.\n\n3.  **VC Dimension**: The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension is a measure of the expressive power of a class of classifiers (hypotheses).\n    *   A set of points $X = \\{x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\}$ is said to be **shattered** by a hypothesis class $\\mathcal{H}$ if for every possible subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there is a hypothesis $h \\in \\mathcal{H}$ that correctly classifies all points in $X$, accepting those in $Y$ and rejecting those in $X \\setminus Y$.\n    *   The **VC dimension** of $\\mathcal{H}$ is the size of the largest set of points that can be shattered by $\\mathcal{H}$.\n\n### Step 2: Characterizing the Hypothesis Class\n\nOur hypothesis class $\\mathcal{H}$ consists of all the sets of elements that can be defined by a formula $\\phi(x)$ from our logic fragment. Let's analyze the structure of such a formula $\\phi(x)$.\n\nA formula $\\phi(x)$ can have existential quantifiers, but no universal quantifiers, negation, or disjunction. A typical formula might look like $\\exists y (P_1(x) \\land P_2(y)) \\land P_3(x)$.\n\nLet's simplify such formulas. Variables that are existentially quantified are independent of the free variable `x` (since we don't have equality or binary relations to link them). Consider a subformula like $\\exists y (\\dots \\land P_i(y) \\land \\dots)$. This can be simplified. For example:\n$\\phi(x) = \\psi(x) \\land \\exists y (\\chi(y))$ is equivalent to $(\\psi(x) \\land \\top)$ if the sentence $\\exists y (\\chi(y))$ is true in the model, and equivalent to $(\\psi(x) \\land \\bot)$ (which is $\\bot$) if the sentence is false.\n\nAny formula $\\phi(x)$ in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ can be rewritten into an equivalent form $C(x) \\land S$, where $C(x)$ is a quantifier-free formula with the free variable $x$, and $S$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables).\n*   $C(x)$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas involving $x$, i.e., $C(x) = P_{i_1}(x) \\land P_{i_2}(x) \\land \\dots \\land P_{i_k}(x)$.\n*   $S$ is a sentence built from the allowed symbols. For any given model, $S$ is either true or false.\n\nIf the sentence $S$ is false in a model, the entire formula $\\phi(x)$ is false for every `x`, which is equivalent to the formula $\\bot$. This defines the empty set.\nIf the sentence $S$ is true, the formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $C(x)$.\n\nTherefore, for any given model, any classifier $\\phi(x)$ from our language is equivalent to either $\\bot$ (selecting no points) or a conjunction of some of the base predicates $\\{P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)\\}$. Such a conjunction is also known as a **monotone monomial**.\n\nThe set of hypotheses $\\mathcal{H}$ is thus the set of all monotone monomials over the 4 predicates, plus the hypothesis that rejects everything (the empty set). There are $2^4 = 16$ such monomials (one for each subset of predicates, including the empty conjunction which is $\\top$).\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the VC Dimension\n\nWe need to find the size of the largest set that can be shattered by this hypothesis class. Let $d=4$ be the number of predicates. The VC dimension of the class of monotone monomials over $d$ variables is known to be $d$.\n\n**Lower Bound (VC-dim $\\ge 4$)**\n\nTo show the VC dimension is at least 4, we must find a set of 4 points that can be shattered.\nLet's construct a model with 4 points $X = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\\}$. We define the truth values of the predicates for these points as follows:\n*   For point $a_1$: $P_1$ is false, $P_2, P_3, P_4$ are true.\n*   For point $a_2$: $P_2$ is false, $P_1, P_3, P_4$ are true.\n*   For point $a_3$: $P_3$ is false, $P_1, P_2, P_4$ are true.\n*   For point $a_4$: $P_4$ is false, $P_1, P_2, P_3$ are true.\nIn general, for point $a_i$, $P_j(a_i)$ is false if $i=j$ and true if $i \\neq j$.\n\nNow, we must show that for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we can find a formula in our class that selects exactly the points in $Y$.\nLet $Y$ be an arbitrary subset of $X$. Let $J = \\{ j \\mid a_j \\notin Y \\}$ be the set of indices of the points we want to *exclude*.\nConsider the formula $\\phi_Y(x) = \\bigwedge_{j \\in J} P_j(x)$.\n\nLet's test this formula:\n1.  Pick a point $a_i \\in Y$. We need $\\phi_Y(a_i)$ to be true. For this, all conjuncts $P_j(a_i)$ for $j \\in J$ must be true. By our construction, $P_j(a_i)$ is true if and only if $j \\neq i$. Since $a_i \\in Y$, its index $i$ is not in $J$. So, for all $j \\in J$, $j \\neq i$. Thus, $\\phi_Y(a_i)$ is true.\n2.  Pick a point $a_k \\in X \\setminus Y$. We need $\\phi_Y(a_k)$ to be false. Since $a_k \\notin Y$, its index $k$ is in $J$. This means the predicate $P_k(x)$ is one of the conjuncts in the formula $\\phi_Y(x)$. When we evaluate at $a_k$, we must evaluate $P_k(a_k)$. By our construction, $P_k(a_k)$ is false. This makes the entire conjunction false.\n\nSo, for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we found a formula that selects it. This means the set $X$ of size 4 can be shattered. Therefore, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**Upper Bound (VC-dim $< 5$)**\n\nTo show the VC dimension is less than 5, we must show that no set of 5 points can be shattered.\nLet $X$ be any set of 5 points. To shatter $X$, we must be able to realize all $2^5 = 32$ possible labellings (subsets) of $X$.\nOur hypothesis class consists of classifiers defined by monotone monomials and the empty set classifier ($\\bot$). The number of distinct monotone monomials we can form from 4 predicates is $2^4 = 16$.\nSo, the total number of distinct classifiers we have at our disposal is at most $16 + 1 = 17$ (16 monomials + 1 for the empty set).\nSince we only have at most 17 distinct classifiers, we cannot possibly realize the 32 different labellings required to shatter a set of 5 points.\nTherefore, no set of 5 points can be shattered. This implies the VC dimension is less than 5.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nFrom the analysis, we have:\n*   VC dimension $\\ge 4$\n*   VC dimension $< 5$\n\nCombining these results, the VC dimension must be exactly 4.\n\n>>>4"
