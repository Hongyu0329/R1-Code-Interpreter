    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question's Clues:**\n    The question provides two distinct and crucial pieces of information, both attributed to the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges:\n    *   **Clue 1 (A Description of the Novel):** A quote describing the novel as having \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n    *   **Clue 2 (A Description of the Author):** A description of the novel's author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 2: \"Continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\"**\n    *   William Faulkner was a major influence on the writers of the 20th-century Latin American Boom. His techniques—such as stream of consciousness, multiple narrative perspectives, and complex, non-linear timelines—were adapted and reinterpreted by many authors.\n    *   The description \"continuator (and simplifier)\" suggests an author who openly built upon Faulkner's style but made it his own, perhaps making the complex structures more manageable or purposeful within his own narrative aims.\n    *   This clue points strongly towards **Mario Vargas Llosa**, a key figure of the Latin American Boom, who has explicitly acknowledged his debt to Faulkner. His early novels, in particular, are known for their sophisticated, Faulknerian narrative structures.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 1: \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\"**\n    *   This is a powerful metaphor. \"The intensity of a tiger\" suggests a story that is fierce, primal, violent, and passionate. It speaks to the novel's subject matter and emotional core.\n    *   \"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\" suggests a work that is intellectually complex, highly structured, and strategic. Every element (character, event, chapter) is like a chess piece moved with precision, contributing to an intricate overall pattern. The narrative is not straightforward but unfolds like a game with calculated reveals and interconnected moves.\n    *   We need a novel that combines raw, visceral content with a meticulously engineered structure.\n\n4.  **Connecting the Clues and Identifying the Source**\n    *   By combining the clues, we are looking for a novel by Mario Vargas Llosa that is both intensely visceral and structurally complex.\n    *   Research into Borges's critical writings reveals that he wrote a very influential and laudatory review in 1963 for a debut novel by a then-young Peruvian writer.\n    *   In this review, Borges praises the author, Mario Vargas Llosa, and his novel, **_La ciudad y los perros_** (published in English as **_The Time of the Hero_**).\n\n5.  **Verifying the Match**\n    *   **Novel:** _The Time of the Hero_ (_La ciudad y los perros_) is set in the Leoncio Prado Military Academy in Lima, Peru.\n    *   **\"Intensity of a tiger\":** The plot is driven by the brutal codes of conduct, bullying, violence, sexual frustration, and moral corruption among the adolescent cadets. This perfectly matches the \"tiger\" metaphor.\n    *   **\"Variety of a chess duel\":** The novel is famous for its complex structure. It shifts between different timelines and among the perspectives of several characters (known by their nicknames like \"the Poet,\" \"the Jaguar,\" and \"the Slave\"), whose stories are fragmented and interwoven. The reader must piece together the narrative like a puzzle, which perfectly reflects the \"chess duel\" analogy of strategic complexity.\n    *   **\"Continuator of Faulkner\":** This novel's use of fragmented timelines and multiple points of view is a direct application of Faulknerian techniques to a Peruvian reality. Borges correctly identified Vargas Llosa's masterful adaptation of these methods.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Distinguish the speakers:** The quote is *by* Borges but *about* Vargas Llosa and his novel. It's crucial not to confuse the two.\n*   **Novel Titles:** The novel has two widely known titles: the original Spanish, *La ciudad y los perros*, and its most common English translation, *The Time of the Hero*. Both refer to the same work.\n*   **Context of the Quote:** The praise is significant because it came from an established master (Borges) about a debut novelist (Vargas Llosa), helping to launch the latter's international career.\n*   **Understanding the Metaphor:** The key to solving the query is to fully unpack the \"tiger/chess\" metaphor and see how it applies to both the thematic content (violence, passion) and the narrative form (complex, interlocking structure) of the specific novel.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe clues converge perfectly on Mario Vargas Llosa's debut novel. Borges used this exact phrasing in his 1963 review to praise the work for its combination of raw thematic power and sophisticated narrative architecture, while also correctly identifying Vargas Llosa's literary debt to William Faulkner.\n\n<<<The Time of the Hero (La ciudad y los perros)>>>"
