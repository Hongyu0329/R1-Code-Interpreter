    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Board and Non-Attacking Rules\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 toroidal chessboard. This means the board wraps around from top to bottom and from left to right. Row 0 is adjacent to row 4, and column 0 is adjacent to column 4.\n*   **Queens:** We are placing 4 queens. Queens attack any piece in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n*   **Non-Attacking Conditions:** Let the positions of the 4 queens be `(r1, c1)`, `(r2, c2)`, `(r3, c3)`, and `(r4, c4)`. For the queens to be non-attacking, the following conditions must be met:\n    1.  **Rows:** All row indices must be unique. `{r1, r2, r3, r4}` must be a set of 4 distinct numbers.\n    2.  **Columns:** All column indices must be unique. `{c1, c2, c3, c4}` must be a set of 4 distinct numbers.\n    3.  **Diagonals:** On a toroidal board, diagonals are defined by modular arithmetic. Two queens at `(ra, ca)` and `(rb, cb)` attack each other diagonally if:\n        *   `ra - ca ≡ rb - cb (mod 5)` (they are on the same main diagonal)\n        *   `ra + ca ≡ rb + cb (mod 5)` (they are on the same anti-diagonal)\n    Therefore, for the 4 queens to be non-attacking, the values of `(ri - ci) mod 5` must be distinct for all 4 queens, and the values of `(ri + ci) mod 5` must also be distinct.\n\n### Step 2: Rephrasing the Problem\n\nThe problem is to find the number of ways to choose 4 cells `(ri, ci)` from the 25 cells of the board such that the following four sets each contain 4 distinct elements:\n1.  The set of row coordinates: `{r1, r2, r3, r4}`\n2.  The set of column coordinates: `{c1, c2, c3, c4}`\n3.  The set of main diagonal indices: `{(r1 - c1) mod 5, (r2 - c2) mod 5, (r3 - c3) mod 5, (r4 - c4) mod 5}`\n4.  The set of anti-diagonal indices: `{(r1 + c1) mod 5, (r2 + c1) mod 5, (r3 + c3) mod 5, (r4 + c4) mod 5}`\n\nLet's denote the number of ways to place `k` non-attacking queens on an `n x n` toroidal board as `Q(n, k)`. We are looking for `Q(5, 4)`.\n\n### Step 3: Relating the 4-Queen Problem to the 5-Queen Problem\n\nInstead of trying to count the 4-queen placements directly, we can relate this problem to the simpler-to-characterize problem of placing 5 queens, `Q(5, 5)`.\n\nA full solution of 5 non-attacking queens would completely fill all 5 rows, 5 columns, 5 main diagonals (mod 5), and 5 anti-diagonals (mod 5).\n\n*   **From 5 Queens to 4 Queens:** If we have a valid placement of 5 non-attacking queens, we can remove any one of these 5 queens. The remaining 4 queens will still be non-attacking, thus forming a valid 4-queen placement. Since there are 5 queens to choose from, every 5-queen solution generates five different 4-queen solutions.\n*   **From 4 Queens to 5 Queens (The Completion Theorem):** The crucial question is whether every 4-queen placement can be generated this way. This is equivalent to asking: can any valid placement of 4 non-attacking queens be extended to a valid placement of 5 non-attacking queens? And if so, is that extension unique?\n\n### Step 4: Proving that Every 4-Queen Placement can be Uniquely Extended\n\nLet's consider a valid placement of 4 queens.\n*   There is exactly one unused row, let's call its index `r_5`.\n*   There is exactly one unused column, `c_5`.\n*   There is exactly one unused main diagonal index, `d_5`. (`d_5` is the value in `{0,1,2,3,4}` not present in the set `{(ri - ci) mod 5}`).\n*   There is exactly one unused anti-diagonal index, `s_5`. (`s_5` is the value in `{0,1,2,3,4}` not present in the set `{(ri + ci) mod 5}`).\n\nTo extend the 4-queen placement, we must place the 5th queen at the only available spot `(r_5, c_5)`. For this to be a valid placement, this new queen must not attack the other four. Since it's in the only empty row and column, it doesn't have a row/column conflict. We only need to check the diagonal conditions. The placement is valid if and only if:\n1.  `r_5 - c_5 ≡ d_5 (mod 5)`\n2.  `r_5 + c_5 ≡ s_5 (mod 5)`\n\nWe can prove that these two conditions are always satisfied. This relies on the property that for `n=5` (and any odd `n`), the sum of integers from 0 to `n-1` is a multiple of `n`.\n`sum_{i=0 to 4} i = 0+1+2+3+4 = 10 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`.\n\nLet `R = {r1,r2,r3,r4}`, `C = {c1,c2,c3,c4}`, `D = {(ri-ci) mod 5}`, `S = {(ri+ci) mod 5}`.\n`sum(R) + r_5 = 0 (mod 5) ⇒ sum(R) ≡ -r_5 (mod 5)`\n`sum(C) + c_5 = 0 (mod 5) ⇒ sum(C) ≡ -c_5 (mod 5)`\n`sum(D) + d_5 = 0 (mod 5) ⇒ sum(D) ≡ -d_5 (mod 5)`\n`sum(S) + s_5 = 0 (mod 5) ⇒ sum(S) ≡ -s_5 (mod 5)`\n\nNow, check the first condition:\n`sum(D) = sum(ri - ci) = sum(R) - sum(C) ≡ (-r_5) - (-c_5) ≡ c_5 - r_5 (mod 5)`.\nSince `sum(D) ≡ -d_5 (mod 5)`, we get `-d_5 ≡ c_5 - r_5`, which is `d_5 ≡ r_5 - c_5 (mod 5)`. The first condition holds.\n\nCheck the second condition:\n`sum(S) = sum(ri + ci) = sum(R) + sum(C) ≡ (-r_5) + (-c_5) ≡ -(r_5 + c_5) (mod 5)`.\nSince `sum(S) ≡ -s_5 (mod 5)`, we get `-s_5 ≡ -(r_5 + c_5)`, which is `s_5 ≡ r_5 + c_5 (mod 5)`. The second condition also holds.\n\nThis proves that any valid placement of 4 non-attacking queens can be completed to a valid placement of 5 non-attacking queens, and the position of the 5th queen is uniquely determined.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Final Answer\n\nThis one-to-one correspondence between (4-queen solutions) and (5-queen solutions with one queen marked for removal) allows us to count the number of 4-queen solutions `Q(5, 4)` based on the number of 5-queen solutions `Q(5, 5)`.\n\nNumber of 4-queen solutions = (Number of 5-queen solutions) × 5\n`Q(5, 4) = Q(5, 5) * 5`\n\nThe number of ways to place 5 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board, `Q(5, 5)`, is a known result in combinatorics.\n`Q(5, 5) = 30`.\n\nTherefore, we can calculate the number of ways to place 4 queens:\n`Q(5, 4) = 30 * 5 = 150`.\n\nThere are 150 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<150>>>"
