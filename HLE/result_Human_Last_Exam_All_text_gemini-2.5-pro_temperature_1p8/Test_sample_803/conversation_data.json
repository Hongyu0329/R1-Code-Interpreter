    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's ensure we have a precise understanding of the terms used in the question.\n\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if the product of any two elements in `S` (including the square of an element) is not in `S`. Mathematically, this is expressed as `S ⋅ S ∩ S = ∅`, where `S ⋅ S = {ab | a, b ∈ S}`. A direct consequence of this is that the identity element `1` cannot be in any non-empty product-free set, as `1 ⋅ 1 = 1`.\n\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set (MPF Set):** A product-free set `S` is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means that for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n\n*   **A Set `S` Fills `G`:** A subset `S` of `G` is said to fill `G` if `G = S ∪ S⁻¹ ∪ {1}`, where `S⁻¹ = {s⁻¹ | s ∈ S}`. This condition means that every non-identity element of `G` is either in `S` or its inverse is in `S` (or both).\n\n*   **Filled Group:** A group `G` is \"filled\" if **every** maximal by inclusion product-free set in `G` fills `G`. This is a very strong condition, as it must hold for all MPF sets.\n\n### Step 2: A Key Property of Groups with an Index-2 Subgroup\n\nLet's analyze the structure of any group `G` that possesses a subgroup `H` of index 2.\n\n1.  **Existence of a specific MPF set:** If `H` is a subgroup of `G` with index `[G:H]=2`, then `H` must be a normal subgroup. Let `S = G \\ H` be the non-identity coset of `H`. Let's analyze this set `S`.\n    *   **Is `S` product-free?** Let `s₁, s₂ ∈ S`. We can write `G = H ∪ aH` for some `a ∉ H`, so `S = aH`. The product `s₁s₂` is in `(aH)(aH) = a(Ha)H = a(aH)H = a²H`. Since the quotient group `G/H` is isomorphic to `C₂`, we have `(aH)² = H`, which means `a² ∈ H`. Thus, `s₁s₂ ∈ H`. Since `S ∩ H = ∅`, no product of elements from `S` can be in `S`. Therefore, `S = G \\ H` is a product-free set.\n    *   **Is `S` a maximal product-free set?** To check for maximality, we must show that for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S' = S ∪ {g}` is not product-free. If `g ∈ G \\ S`, then `g` must be in `H`. Let `s` be any element of `S`. Consider the product `gs`. Since `g ∈ H` and `s ∈ S`, `gs` must be in `HS = S`. Thus, we have found two elements, `g` and `s`, in `S' = S ∪ {g}` whose product `gs` is also in `S`, and therefore in `S'`. This violates the product-free condition for `S'`. Hence, `S = G \\ H` is a maximal by inclusion product-free set.\n\n2.  **Does this MPF set `S = G \\ H` fill `G`?**\n    *   The filling condition is `G = S ∪ S⁻¹ ∪ {1}`.\n    *   Since `H` is a subgroup, `H⁻¹ = H`. The set of inverses of elements in `S` is `S⁻¹ = (G \\ H)⁻¹ = G \\ H⁻¹ = G \\ H = S`.\n    *   So, the filling condition simplifies to `G = S ∪ S ∪ {1} = S ∪ {1}`.\n    *   Substituting `S = G \\ H`, we get `G = (G \\ H) ∪ {1}`.\n    *   This equality can only hold if the set of elements we removed, `H`, consists only of the identity element, i.e., `H = {1}`.\n\n3.  **Conclusion for groups with an index-2 subgroup:** A group `G` that has a subgroup `H` of index 2 is filled **only if** `H = {1}`. If `H` is non-trivial (`|H| > 1`), then `G` contains a maximal product-free set `S = G \\ H` which does not fill `G`, so `G` cannot be a filled group.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Groups of Order 2q^m\n\nNow we apply this finding to the specific class of groups given in the question.\n\n*   `G` is a nonabelian group of order `|G| = 2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number (`m ≥ 1`).\n\n1.  **Sylow Subgroups:** By Sylow's Theorems, `G` has a Sylow `q`-subgroup, let's call it `Q`, of order `|Q| = q^m`. The number of such subgroups, `n_q`, must divide the order of the group divided by the order of the subgroup, i.e., `n_q` divides `2q^m / q^m = 2`. So `n_q` can be 1 or 2. Also, `n_q` must be congruent to `1` modulo `q`, i.e., `n_q ≡ 1 (mod q)`.\n    *   Since `q` is an odd prime, `q ≥ 3`.\n    *   If `n_q = 2`, then `2 ≡ 1 (mod q)`, which implies `q` divides `1`. This is impossible for a prime `q`.\n    *   Therefore, `n_q` must be `1`.\n\n2.  **Existence of a Normal Subgroup of Index 2:** A unique Sylow subgroup must be a normal subgroup. So, `Q` is a normal subgroup of `G`.\n    *   The order of `Q` is `|Q| = q^m`. Since `q ≥ 3` and `m ≥ 1`, the order is at least 3, so `Q` is a non-trivial subgroup (`Q ≠ {1}`).\n    *   The index of `Q` in `G` is `[G:Q] = |G| / |Q| = 2q^m / q^m = 2`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have established two points:\n1.  Any group with a non-trivial subgroup of index 2 is not a filled group.\n2.  Any group of order `2q^m` (for odd prime `q`, `m≥1`) has a non-trivial normal subgroup of order `q^m` and index 2.\n\nCombining these two points, we conclude that any group `G` of order `2q^m` has a non-trivial subgroup `Q` of index 2. Following the logic from Step 2, the set `S = G \\ Q` is a maximal product-free set. However, since `Q ≠ {1}`, this set `S` does not fill `G`.\n\nSince we have found at least one maximal product-free set that does not fill `G`, the condition that *every* such set must fill `G` is violated. Therefore, no group of order `2q^m` (for odd prime `q` and `m ≥ 1`) can be a filled group.\n\nThis reasoning applies to both abelian and nonabelian groups of this order. As the question asks for the nonabelian filled groups, and we have shown that no group of this order can be filled, the answer is that there are none.\n\nThere are no nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m`.\n\n<<<There are no such groups.>>>"
