    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we need to find the canonical representation of the game whose value is $\\frac{13}{16}$. The number of pieces corresponds to the number of edges in this canonical game graph.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand Game Values in Hackenbush:** Finite Red-Blue Hackenbush positions have values that are dyadic rationals (numbers of the form $m/2^n$). The standard way to construct a game for any dyadic rational is to express the number as a sum of signed powers of 2, and then sum the corresponding canonical games for each term.\n\n2.  **Canonical Representation using Non-Adjacent Form (NAF):** The most efficient and canonical representation of a number in base 2 uses signed digits $\\{1, 0, -1\\}$ such that no two consecutive digits are non-zero. This is known as the Non-Adjacent Form (NAF). The total number of pieces will be the sum of the pieces of the component games from this NAF expansion.\n\n3.  **Convert $\\frac{13}{16}$ to its NAF:**\n    *   First, write $\\frac{13}{16}$ in binary.\n        $13_{10} = 8 + 4 + 1 = 1 \\cdot 2^3 + 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 1 \\cdot 2^0 = 1101_2$.\n        So, $\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{1101_2}{10000_2} = 0.1101_2$.\n    *   Next, convert this binary representation to its NAF. The rule for conversion is to replace any run of ones of the form $011...1$ (with $k$ ones) by $100...0\\bar{1}$ (where $\\bar{1}$ represents -1).\n        In $0.1101$, we have the block $0.11$. This can be rewritten as $1 - 0.01$.\n        So, $0.1101_2 = (1 - 0.01)_2 + 0.0001_2 = 1.0\\bar{1}_2 + 0.0001_2 = 1.0\\bar{1}01_2$.\n    *   This NAF representation corresponds to the sum:\n        $1 \\cdot 2^0 + 0 \\cdot 2^{-1} - 1 \\cdot 2^{-2} + 0 \\cdot 2^{-3} + 1 \\cdot 2^{-4} = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16}$.\n        (Check: $1 - \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{16-4+1}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}$. Correct.)\n\n4.  **Find the Games for Each Term:** The total game for $\\frac{13}{16}$ is a sum of the games for each term in the NAF expansion: $G = G_1 + G_{-1/4} + G_{1/16}$. We place these games side-by-side, each connected to the ground.\n\n5.  **Calculate Pieces for Each Component Game:**\n    *   **Game for 1 ($G_1$):** The game with value 1 is a single red edge connected to the ground.\n        *   Number of pieces = 1 (1 red).\n    *   **Game for -1/4 ($G_{-1/4}$):** The game for $-1/2^k$ is constructed from a single blue \"stem\" connected to the ground, with $k$ red \"petals\" branching from the top of the stem. For $-1/4$, we have $k=2$.\n        *   Pieces = 1 blue stem + 2 red petals = 3 pieces.\n    *   **Game for 1/16 ($G_{1/16}$):** The game for $1/2^k$ is constructed from a single red \"stem\" with $k$ blue \"petals\". For $1/16$, we have $k=4$.\n        *   Pieces = 1 red stem + 4 blue petals = 5 pieces.\n\n6.  **Calculate Total Number of Pieces:** The total number of pieces is the sum of the pieces required for each component game.\n    *   Total Pieces = (Pieces for $G_1$) + (Pieces for $G_{-1/4}$) + (Pieces for $G_{1/16}$)\n    *   Total Pieces = $1 + 3 + 5 = 9$.\n\n### Careful Points:\n\n*   The representation of a number as a game might not be unique, but the question \"how many pieces are needed\" implies finding the most efficient (minimal) representation.\n*   The canonical form of a game, often related to the Non-Adjacent Form of its value, generally provides this minimal representation. Using the standard binary expansion ($1/2 + 1/4 + 1/16$) would have resulted in $2 + 3 + 5 = 10$ pieces, which is not the minimum.\n*   The structure of the games for $1/2^k$ (a single stem with k petals) is a standard construction in combinatorial game theory.\n\nFinal calculation: $1 + 3 + 5 = 9$.\n\n>>> 9"
