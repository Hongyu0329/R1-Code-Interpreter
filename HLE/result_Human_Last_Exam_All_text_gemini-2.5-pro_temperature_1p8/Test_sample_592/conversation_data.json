    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the US city Tommaso moves to in the movie *Ovosodo*.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The user wants to know the specific US city that the character Tommaso moves to in the 1997 Italian film *Ovosodo*.\n\n2.  **Identify the key entities:**\n    *   **Movie:** *Ovosodo* (English title: *Hard Boiled Egg*), released in 1997.\n    *   **Character:** Tommaso.\n    *   **Actor:** Marco Cocci (This confirms we are talking about the correct character).\n    *   **Action:** Moves to the United States.\n\n3.  **Recall or research the plot of the film:** The film centers on the life of the protagonist, Piero Mansani, growing up in Livorno, Italy. Tommaso is his best friend from a wealthy background.\n\n4.  **Focus on Tommaso's character arc:** Tommaso is depicted as a rebellious and restless spirit who feels stifled by life in his provincial hometown. This dissatisfaction leads to a pivotal decision in his life.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the specific plot point of his departure:** A significant event in the narrative is when Tommaso decides to leave Italy to seek a different life. He moves to the United States, separating from his best friend, Piero.\n\n6.  **Identify the destination city:** Film synopses and detailed plot analyses confirm that Tommaso moves to **San Francisco**, California. In the movie, his life in the US is communicated to Piero and the audience through postcards he sends from that city.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Character Distinction:** It's important not to confuse Tommaso (the best friend who leaves) with the protagonist, Piero (who stays in Livorno for most of the film). The question correctly identifies Tommaso.\n*   **Confirmation:** The detail about San Francisco is a specific plot point that can be verified through multiple reliable sources, such as film databases (like IMDb) and detailed movie reviews or summaries.\n*   **Significance:** Tommaso's move to San Francisco is narratively important as it symbolizes a different life path and the dreams of escape, contrasting with Piero's more grounded existence in Livorno.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the movie's plot, Tommaso moves to San Francisco.\n\n<<<San Francisco>>>"
