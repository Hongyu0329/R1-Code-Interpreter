    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Christian theologian.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe core of the question seeks to identify a specific Christian theologian who achieved the following:\n*   He was a Christian theologian.\n*   He developed \"specialized terminology.\" This implies a formal, defined set of terms, not just a general discussion.\n*   This terminology is used to describe \"changes in the laws of nature.\"\n*   This framework must be applicable to two distinct scenarios:\n    1.  A singular, miraculous event: the virgin birth of Jesus.\n    2.  A universal, systemic alteration: possible changes in natural laws resulting from the Fall of Man.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Potential Candidates and Their Doctrines**\n\n*   **Early Church Fathers (e.g., Augustine of Hippo):** St. Augustine is a major figure who wrote extensively on creation, miracles, and the Fall. He used the concept of *rationes seminales* or \"seminal reasons,\" which he adapted from Stoic philosophy. This theory suggests that God embedded the potential for all future developments, including miracles, into creation from the very beginning. A miracle, then, is not a violation of nature but the activation of a pre-planned, hidden potential within it.\n    *   **Applicability to Virgin Birth:** This works well. The virgin birth could be seen as an actualization of a \"seminal reason\" placed in creation by God.\n    *   **Applicability to the Fall:** One could argue that potentials for decay and death were also \"seminal reasons,\" activated by human sin.\n    *   **Critique:** While a powerful concept, *rationes seminales* is more about explaining how novel events can emerge from within a pre-programmed natural order rather than describing a *change in the laws* themselves. It explains exceptions *within* the system. The question asks for terminology about *changes* to the laws.\n\n*   **Reformation Theologians (e.g., John Calvin):** Calvin wrote about God's Providence, distinguishing between General Providence (God upholding the natural order) and Special Providence (miracles). This is a valid distinction, but it doesn't represent the creation of a unique, specialized philosophical terminology for the mechanics of natural law in the way the question implies. It's more of a descriptive categorization.\n\n*   **High Scholastic Theologians (e.g., Thomas Aquinas):** Thomas Aquinas is renowned for synthesizing Christian theology with Aristotelian philosophy. In his work, particularly the *Summa Theologiae*, he made a crucial distinction concerning God's power that became standard in later theology.\n    *   **The Specialized Terminology:** Aquinas formalized the distinction between God's **ordained power (*potentia ordinata*)** and His **absolute power (*potentia absoluta*)**.\n        *   ***Potentia Ordinata***: This refers to God's power as He has chosen to exercise it within the created order He established. This established order includes the laws of nature. It's the \"ordinary\" way God runs the universe.\n        *   ***Potentia Absoluta***: This refers to God's sheer ability to do anything that is not logically impossible. It is the power of God considered in itself, not limited by the current created order. God can, by his absolute power, act outside of or contrary to the laws of nature He ordained.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Terminology of Thomas Aquinas to the Specific Scenarios**\n\n*   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** The normal laws of human reproduction are part of God's *potentia ordinata*. The virgin birth is a classic example of God using His *potentia absoluta* to bring about an event that suspends or bypasses the ordained natural order for a specific, salvific purpose. It is a miracle.\n\n*   **Application to Changes at the Fall:** The framework can also describe a systemic change. The state of nature before the Fall (e.g., without death, disease, or certain types of decay) can be understood as the original *potentia ordinata*. The Fall can be seen as an event that led God to institute a new or altered *potentia ordinata* for the fallen world. The \"laws\" of nature themselves were changed. Thus, phenomena like death and decay are now part of the *ordained* course of nature in its post-Fall state.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nThomas Aquinas's distinction between *potentia ordinata* and *potentia absoluta* provides the most precise and specialized terminological framework that addresses all parts of the user's question. It was developed by a major theologian and is sophisticated enough to describe both singular exceptions to natural law (miracles like the virgin birth) and a fundamental change in the entire system of natural laws (a consequence of the Fall). While Augustine laid important groundwork, Aquinas's terms are more directly tailored to the relationship between God's power and the laws of nature He instituted.\n\n<<<Thomas Aquinas>>>"
