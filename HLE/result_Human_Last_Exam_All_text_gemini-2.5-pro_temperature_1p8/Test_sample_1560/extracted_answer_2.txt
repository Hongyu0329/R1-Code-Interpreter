After the gate `Q` is applied to the first ququint and that ququint is measured, the system collapses into one of the following five states with the specified probabilities:
1.  With probability **1/5**, the final state is $|0\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B)$.
2.  With probability **1/5**, the final state is $|1\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B)$.
3.  With probability **3/10**, the final state is $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
4.  With probability **1/5**, the final state is $|3\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
5.  With probability **1/10**, the final state is $|4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$.
