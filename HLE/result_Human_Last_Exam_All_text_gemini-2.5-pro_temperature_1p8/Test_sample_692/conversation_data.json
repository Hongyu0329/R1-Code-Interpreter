    "Answering this question requires distinguishing between the earliest evidence of writing, the earliest use of a calendar, and the earliest recording of a specific, non-repeating date.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**: The key elements are \"earliest known date,\" \"recorded,\" \"pre-Columbian,\" and \"aboriginal writing system.\" This directs us to look for a specific artifact with a date written on it in a native script, which can be correlated to our modern calendar. It is not just the oldest writing, but the oldest written *date*.\n\n2.  **Identify Early Writing and Calendrical Systems**:\n    *   **Earliest Writing**: The oldest confirmed writing in the Americas is on the **Cascajal Block**, an Olmec artifact dated to approximately 900 BCE. However, this block contains signs and glyphs, but no recognizable date or calendar.\n    *   **Earliest Calendrical Inscriptions**: The Zapotec civilization at Monte Alb√°n produced monuments (Stelae 12 and 13) with calendrical inscriptions around 500-400 BCE. These inscriptions include day names from the 260-day ritual calendar (e.g., \"1 Earthquake\"). While this is a form of date, it is a repeating one; the day \"1 Earthquake\" occurs every 260 days and doesn't anchor the event to a specific year in a linear timeline.\n\n3.  **Focus on Specific, Linear Dates (The Long Count)**: To find a specific, non-repeating date, we must turn to the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar. This system counts the total number of days that have passed since a mythical creation date, which most scholars correlate to August 11, 3114 BCE. A date recorded in the Long Count is absolute and can be precisely located in history. The primary contenders for the earliest Long Count date come from two key artifacts.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Contenders**:\n    *   **Contender 1: Stela C from Tres Zapotes**: Found in the Veracruz region of Mexico and associated with the Epi-Olmec culture. This monument has an inscription on one side showing a Long Count date. Although the first number (the *b'ak'tun*) is partially eroded, it is reconstructed based on the artistic style and other numerals as **7.16.6.16.18**. Using the standard correlation, this date corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE**.\n    *   **Contender 2: Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo**: Discovered in Chiapas, Mexico, a region on the periphery of the Maya heartland. This stela fragment clearly depicts a figure and an adjacent column of glyphs. The glyphs record a Long Count date of **7.16.3.2.13**. This date is fully legible and not a reconstruction. It corresponds to **December 7, 36 BCE**.\n\n5.  **Compare and Conclude**:\n    *   Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 Date: **36 BCE**\n    *   Tres Zapotes Stela C Date: **32 BCE**\n\n    By comparing the two Gregorian calendar equivalents, the date recorded on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo is four years earlier than the one on Stela C from Tres Zapotes.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Writing vs. Date**: The oldest writing (Cascajal Block) is much older than the oldest recorded date.\n*   **Repeating vs. Non-Repeating Dates**: Early Zapotec calendar inscriptions are older than Long Count inscriptions, but they record repeating day names, not a specific point in linear history. The question asks for \"the date,\" implying a unique point in time.\n*   **Reconstruction vs. Legibility**: The date on Stela C requires the reconstruction of a missing number, whereas the date on Stela 2 is fully legible, making it a more certain piece of evidence.\n*   **Cultural Affiliation**: The earliest Long Count dates are not from the Classic Maya period but from earlier cultures on the Maya periphery or from the Epi-Olmec, showing that this sophisticated calendar system predates the Maya Classic era.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the direct comparison of the earliest known, specific, non-repeating dates recorded in the Long Count calendar, the inscription on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo is the earliest.\n\n<<<December 7, 36 BCE>>>"
