    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    The starting compound is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n    *   **Benzamide:** A benzene ring attached to a C(=O)N group. This group is considered to be at position 1 of the ring.\n    *   **N,N-diethyl:** The nitrogen of the amide group is bonded to two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The full group is -C(=O)N(Et)₂.\n    *   **3-dimethylamino:** A dimethylamino group, -N(CH₃)₂, is attached to position 3 of the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Reaction Step:**\n    The starting material is treated with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF).\n    *   **sec-BuLi** is a very strong organometallic base. Its primary function here is to deprotonate the most acidic proton in the starting material.\n    *   **TMEDA** is a chelating agent that complexes with the lithium ion (Li⁺). This breaks up sec-BuLi aggregates and increases its basicity. TMEDA also helps stabilize the resulting organolithium intermediate.\n    *   This combination of reagents is classic for a reaction known as **Directed Ortho Metalation (DoM)**. In a DoM reaction, a substituent on the benzene ring directs the lithiation (replacement of H with Li) to a position ortho (adjacent) to it.\n\n3.  **Determine the Site of Deprotonation (Lithiation):**\n    We need to identify the most acidic proton, which will be the one removed by sec-BuLi. This is determined by the \"Directing Metalation Groups\" (DMGs) present on the ring.\n    *   The **N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt₂) at C1** is a very powerful DMG. The carbonyl oxygen and amide nitrogen can chelate the lithium ion, directing the base to deprotonate one of the ortho positions: C2 or C6.\n    *   The **dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) at C3** is also a DMG, although weaker than the amide group. The nitrogen lone pair can direct lithiation to its ortho positions: C2 or C4.\n\n    Both groups direct lithiation to the **C2 position**. This is a cooperative or synergistic effect. The C2 proton is ortho to both the strong -CONEt₂ director and the -NMe₂ director. This makes the C2 proton significantly more acidic than any other proton on the ring (C4, C5, or C6). Therefore, deprotonation occurs selectively and exclusively at the C2 position. An aryllithium intermediate is formed where a lithium atom is bonded to C2.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Reaction Step:**\n    The aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step is then reacted with methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n    *   The C-Li bond in the aryllithium intermediate is highly polarized, making the C2 carbon atom strongly nucleophilic (like a carbanion).\n    *   **Methyl iodide (CH₃I)** is an electrophile. The carbon atom in the methyl group is electron-deficient because it is bonded to the more electronegative iodine atom.\n    *   The nucleophilic C2 carbon attacks the electrophilic methyl group of CH₃I, forming a new carbon-carbon bond and displacing the iodide ion (I⁻) in an Sₙ2-type reaction.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    The overall result of the two-step sequence is the replacement of the hydrogen atom at the C2 position with a methyl group.\n    *   Starting Material: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n    *   Final Product: The parent name is N,N-diethylbenzamide. A methyl group has been added at position 2, and the dimethylamino group remains at position 3.\n    *   The final compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The key is to understand Directed Ortho Metalation and the directing power of substituents. The -CONEt₂ group is a premier DMG. The -NMe₂ group is also a DMG. The cooperative effect of both groups on the C2 position ensures high regioselectivity.\n*   **Reagent Roles:** Recognize sec-BuLi as a strong base for deprotonation, TMEDA as an activator and stabilizer, and methyl iodide as an electrophile for C-C bond formation.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The overall process is a DoM reaction followed by electrophilic quenching.\n*   **Avoiding Side Reactions:** In DoM reactions with amides, ortho deprotonation is generally much faster than nucleophilic addition of the organolithium to the carbonyl group.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
