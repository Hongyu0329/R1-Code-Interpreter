    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the functions**\nWe are given a sequence of functions defined recursively:\n*   F₀(x) = x\n*   F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n*   F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n*   F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the integral**\nWe need to evaluate the definite integral:\nV = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\n\nThe integrand, `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`, is a specific form that relates to the derivative of a logarithmic function. Specifically, for any differentiable function `f(x)`, the derivative of `ln|f(x)|` is `f'(x)/f(x)`.\nSo, `d/dx (ln|F₃(x)|) = F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\nThe integral of a derivative of a function is the function itself. Therefore, we can evaluate the definite integral as follows:\nV = ∫[from 0 to 1] d/dx(ln|F₃(x)|) dx\nV = [ln|F₃(x)|] (evaluated from x=0 to x=1)\nV = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate F₃(x) at the limits of integration**\n\n*   **At x = 0:**\n    *   F₀(0) = 0\n    *   F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0\n    *   F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1\n    *   F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\n*   **At x = 1:**\n    *   F₀(1) = 1\n    *   F₁(1) = sin(1) (Here, 1 is in radians)\n    *   F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))\n    *   F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n\n**Step 5: Handle the absolute values**\nWe need to determine if F₃(0) and F₃(1) are positive or negative.\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.693`, which is positive. So, `|F₃(0)| = ln(2)`.\n*   For `F₃(1)`, we know that 1 radian is approximately 57.3 degrees. Since `0 < 1 < π/2`, `sin(1)` is positive.\n*   Because `sin(1) > 0`, `e^(sin(1)) > e⁰ = 1`.\n*   This means `1 + e^(sin(1)) > 2`.\n*   Therefore, `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) > ln(2) > 0`. It is positive.\n*   So, `|F₃(1)| = F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the value of V**\nNow we can substitute the values back into our expression for V:\nV = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\nV = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we get:\nV = ln( [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)] )\n\n**Step 7: Perform the numerical calculation**\nWe will now calculate the numerical value of V.\n*   sin(1) ≈ 0.84147098\n*   e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.84147098 ≈ 2.31977755\n*   1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 3.31977755\n*   ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(3.31977755) ≈ 1.20000085  (This is F₃(1))\n*   ln(2) ≈ 0.69314718  (This is F₃(0))\n\nNow, substitute these into the expression for V:\nV = ln(1.20000085 / 0.69314718)\nV = ln(1.73123404)\nV ≈ 0.5488461\n\n**Step 8: Find the final result**\nThe question asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.5488461 = 5488.461\n\nThe closest integer to 5488.461 is 5488."
