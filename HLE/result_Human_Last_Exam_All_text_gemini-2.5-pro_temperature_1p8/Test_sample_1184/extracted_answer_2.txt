Here is the final answer based on the analysis. The residue numbering refers to the human beta-1b subunit isoform (UniProt: P54289-1).

**1. Hotspots for interaction (binding) with the alpha-1 subunit:**
These residues are located in the guanylate kinase-like (GK) domain and form the AID-binding pocket.

*   **Valine 363 (V363)**
*   **Tyrosine 390 (Y390)**
*   **Methionine 425 (M425)**
*   **Tryptophan 440 (W440)**
*   **Tyrosine 442 (Y442)**

**2. Hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties (gating modulation) of the alpha-1 subunit:**
These residues and regions are crucial for the allosteric modulation of channel function and are distinct from the primary binding site.

*   **Tryptophan 284 (W284):** Located in the SH3 domain, this residue is essential for the structural integrity of the domain, which is a prerequisite for its modulatory function.
*   **N-terminal Region (Residues 1-70):** This entire segment acts as a key modulatory domain, influencing the kinetics of channel activation and inactivation.
