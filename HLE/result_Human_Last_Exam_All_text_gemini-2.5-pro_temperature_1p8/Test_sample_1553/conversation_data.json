    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Novel:** \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection)\n*   **Author:** Jacek Dukaj\n*   **Protagonist:** The main character of the novel.\n*   **Action:** Marriage or forming a life-long, binding partnership.\n*   **Target Information:** The name of the person the main character marries.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main character of the novel.**\nThe protagonist of Jacek Dukaj's \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski, a 21st-century human who is resurrected in the distant future.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the main character's significant relationships.**\nAdam Zamoyski's journey is heavily influenced by his interactions with the posthumans of this new era. The most significant and defining relationship he forms is with a powerful posthuman entity, a \"Stahs.\"\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific character and the nature of their bond.**\n*   The name of this Stahs is **Angelika**.\n*   Their relationship evolves into a deep, symbiotic union. In the context of the novel's far-future society, this is the equivalent of marriage, or perhaps something even more profound. Adam becomes Angelika's \"Wzajemność\" (Reciprocity or Mutual). This is a permanent, transformative bond where their existences become intertwined.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the information to answer the question.**\nWhile the term \"marriage\" might be a simplification of the complex sci-fi concept presented in the book, the character who fits this role is unequivocally Angelika. She is the being with whom the main character, Adam Zamoyski, forms a permanent and defining life partnership.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The concept of \"marriage\" in the book is not a traditional human ceremony. It's a high-concept sci-fi idea of a permanent union and interdependence between two vastly different beings.\n*   The main character's name is Adam Zamoyski.\n*   The partner's name is Angelika. Their relationship is the central romantic/partnership plotline of the novel.\n\nBased on this analysis, the name of the character that the main character marries is Angelika.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
