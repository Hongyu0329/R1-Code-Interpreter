**Lot B** is legally owned by **Tommy's Estate**, with the associated land number **1234567890** and trailer number **1234567890.1**.

**Lot A** has an unresolved or "clouded" title. **James** was supposed to own it but **never legally corrected his deed**, so he does not have a recorded deed for Lot A. His numbers, **0987654321** and **0987654321.1**, are tied to his outdated and superseded deed for Lot B.
