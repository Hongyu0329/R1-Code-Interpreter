    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Poet and the Work:** The question mentions Andrei Voznesensky, a prominent Russian poet. The phrases \"a joy-discovering sailor\" and \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" are direct references to his famous poem which became the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\").\n\n2.  **Identify the Protagonist:** The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is a real historical figure. He is the one described as a \"sailor\" who undertakes a long voyage. This character is Count Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. He was a Russian nobleman and statesman who, in the early 19th century, sailed from Russian Alaska to Spanish California.\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"Sailor\" Clue:** Nikolai Rezanov was the commander of the expedition on the ships *Juno* and *Avos*. His mission was to establish trade for the Russian-American Company. This role fits the description of a \"sailor\" perfectly, albeit a high-ranking one. The \"joy-discovering\" part alludes to the romantic and hopeful nature of his story as depicted in the opera.\n\n4.  **Analyze the \"Grave\" Clue:** The line \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" points to the mystery surrounding the protagonist's final resting place.\n    *   **Historical Context:** On his return journey to St. Petersburg to seek the Tsar's permission to marry Concepción Argüello of California, Nikolai Rezanov fell ill, fell from his horse, and died in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk in 1807.\n    *   **The Lost Grave:** He was buried in the cemetery of the Voskresensky Cathedral. However, during the Soviet era, the cathedral and its cemetery were demolished in the 1930s, and the exact location of his grave was lost. For many decades, nobody knew precisely where he was buried, which is the situation Voznesensky's poem refers to.\n\n5.  **Analyze the \"Late 1980s\" Clue:** The question states that the answer to the location of the grave \"emerged in the late 1980s\".\n    *   **The Rediscovery:** The immense popularity of the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" sparked renewed public and academic interest in Rezanov's life and death. This led to research and archaeological efforts in Krasnoyarsk. In the late 1980s, researchers were able to identify the likely location of the grave. In 2000, a memorial cross was erected on the presumed burial site with a plaque that reads, in part, \"I will never forget you\" and \"I will never see you,\" famous lines from the rock opera. This historical event perfectly aligns with the timeline given in the question.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The man in question is the protagonist of Voznesensky's \"Juno and Avos.\" The clues about being a \"sailor\" and having a grave that was lost and then rediscovered in the late 1980s all point directly to the historical figure, Count Nikolai Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n**Careful points:**\n*   It's important to connect Voznesensky to his specific work, \"Juno and Avos,\" as it's the key to identifying the subject.\n*   One must recognize that the character in the opera is based on a real person, and the clues refer to the real person's life.\n*   The clue about the grave's rediscovery in the \"late 1980s\" is crucial. It confirms the identity by aligning with the historical timeline of the search for Rezanov's lost grave, a search heavily influenced by the poem itself.\n\nThe final answer is the last name of Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
