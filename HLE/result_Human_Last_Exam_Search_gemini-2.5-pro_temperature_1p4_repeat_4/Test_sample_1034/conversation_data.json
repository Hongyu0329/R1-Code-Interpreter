    "To determine the number of possible integer values for side AC, we first need to establish the conditions under which two different triangles can be formed.\n\nIn triangle ABC, let `a = BC`, `b = AC`, and `c = AB`. We are given `a = S` and the angle `m∠B = 30°`. The problem of finding the number of possible triangles given two sides and a non-included angle is known as the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines.\n\nFor there to be two possible values for the side length AB (side *c*), the following conditions must be met for the length of side AC (side *b*):\n1.  The side *b* must be longer than the altitude from vertex C to the line containing side AB. This altitude *h* is given by `h = a * sin(B)`.\n2.  The side *b* must be shorter than the side *a*.\n\nCombining these gives the inequality: `a * sin(B) < b < a`.\n\nWe are given `a = S` and `m∠B = 30°`, so `sin(B) = sin(30°) = 0.5`. Substituting these values into the inequality, we get:\n`S * 0.5 < b < S`, or `S/2 < b < S`.\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the value of S from the cryptic expression `$S=S N Y W R$`. This expression is likely a puzzle where the letters represent numbers. A common method for such puzzles is to assign a numerical value to each letter based on its position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, C=3, ...). The letters in `SNYWR` correspond to the following numbers:\n*   S = 19\n*   N = 14\n*   Y = 25\n*   W = 23\n*   R = 18\n\nAssuming that S is the sum of these values:\n`S = 19 + 14 + 25 + 23 + 18 = 99`.\n\nNow, we substitute `S = 99` back into our inequality for *b*:\n`99/2 < b < 99`\n`49.5 < b < 99`\n\nThe question asks for the number of *integer* values of AC (*b*). The integers *b* that satisfy this inequality are 50, 51, 52, ..., up to 98.\n\nTo find the number of integers in this range, we can calculate `98 - 50 + 1`:\nNumber of integer values = `49`.\n\nThus, there are 49 possible integer values for the side length AC.\n\n<<<49>>>"
