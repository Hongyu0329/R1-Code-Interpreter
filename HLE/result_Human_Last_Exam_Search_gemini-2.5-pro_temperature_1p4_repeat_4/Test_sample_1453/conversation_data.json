    "The oligomeric state of a coiled-coil protein is primarily determined by the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing of amino acid side chains at the hydrophobic core positions, designated as 'a' and 'd' within a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern known as the heptad repeat (`abcdefg`). The identity and arrangement of the amino acids at these 'a' and 'd' positions dictate the packing efficiency and, consequently, the number of helices that can favorably assemble.\n\nTo determine the oligomeric state of the sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we first need to identify the heptad repeat. Coiled-coil sequences are characterized by a pattern of hydrophobic residues, typically at positions 'a' and 'd'. By aligning the given sequence to maximize the placement of hydrophobic residues at these core positions, the most chemically plausible heptad register is as follows:\n\n<pre>\nSequence: G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G\nHeptad:     c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a\n</pre>\n\nThis alignment reveals the following residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions:\n\n*   **'a' positions:** L, A, S, A\n*   **'d' positions:** I, I, I, I\n\nEstablished rules based on experimental studies guide the prediction of the oligomeric state:\n*   **Dimer:** Favored by Isoleucine (I) at 'a' positions and Leucine (L) at 'd' positions.\n*   **Trimer:** Often favored by having Isoleucine (I) at both 'a' and 'd' positions.\n*   **Tetramer:** Favored by Leucine (L) at 'a' positions and Isoleucine (I) at 'd' positions.\n\nThe analyzed sequence predominantly features hydrophobic residues at its core. Specifically, the 'd' positions are consistently occupied by Isoleucine (I), while the 'a' positions are mostly occupied by Leucine (L) and Alanine (A). The pattern of having a larger hydrophobic residue (Leucine) at the 'a' position and a beta-branched hydrophobic residue (Isoleucine) at the 'd' position strongly promotes the formation of a four-helix bundle, or a tetramer. The smaller Alanine residues at the other 'a' positions are also compatible with the tight packing required in a tetrameric interface. The single polar Serine (S) at an 'a' position is a minor deviation in an otherwise strong hydrophobic pattern favoring tetramerization.\n\nBased on the prevalence of the Leucine/Alanine at 'a' and Isoleucine at 'd' pattern, the most likely oligomeric state for this coiled-coil sequence is a tetramer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
