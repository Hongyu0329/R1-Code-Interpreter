    "To determine which curve has good ordinary reduction for all primes `p > 2`, we need to analyze two conditions for each curve of the form `z^2 = f(x)`:\n1.  **Good Reduction**: The curve must have good reduction for all odd primes. For a curve given by `z^2 = f(x)`, where `f(x)` has integer coefficients, it has good reduction at an odd prime `p` if `p` does not divide the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)`.\n2.  **Ordinary Reduction**: At every odd prime `p` of good reduction, the reduced curve over the finite field `F_p` must be \"ordinary.\" A curve is ordinary if its number of rational points over the algebraic closure of `F_p` has the maximum possible `p`-torsion. For curves with complex multiplication (CM), this is related to whether the prime `p` splits in the corresponding CM field. For non-CM curves, reduction is ordinary for a density-1 set of primes, but not necessarily for all of them.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A. z² = x⁵ + 3**\n*   The polynomial is `f(x) = x⁵ + 3`.\n*   The discriminant is `disc(x⁵ + 3) = 5⁵ * 3⁴ = 253125`.\n*   The prime factors of the discriminant are 3 and 5. This means the curve has bad reduction at `p=3` and `p=5`.\n*   Therefore, it does not have good reduction for all primes `p > 2`.\n\n**B. z² = x⁵ - 1**\n*   The polynomial is `f(x) = x⁵ - 1`.\n*   The discriminant is `disc(x⁵ - 1) = 5⁵ = 3125`.\n*   The only prime factor of the discriminant is 5. This means the curve has bad reduction at `p=5`.\n*   Therefore, it does not have good reduction for all primes `p > 2`.\n\n**C. z² = x⁶ - 1**\n*   The polynomial is `f(x) = x⁶ - 1`.\n*   The discriminant is `disc(x⁶ - 1) = -2⁶ * 3⁶ = -46656`.\n*   The prime factors of the discriminant are 2 and 3. This means the curve has bad reduction at `p=3`.\n*   Furthermore, this curve is related to the elliptic curve `y² = x³ - 1` by the map `(x, y) ↦ (x², z)`. This elliptic curve has complex multiplication by the ring of integers of `Q(√-3)`. An elliptic curve with CM has ordinary reduction at a prime `p` if `p` splits in the CM field, and supersingular reduction if `p` is inert. Primes `p > 3` are inert in `Q(√-3)` if `p ≡ 2 (mod 3)` (e.g., 5, 11, 17). For these primes, the reduction is supersingular, not ordinary.\n*   Thus, this curve fails on two counts: it has bad reduction at `p=3` and does not have ordinary reduction for all primes `p > 3`.\n\n**D. z² = 2x⁵ + 2x³ + 1**\n*   The polynomial is `f(x) = 2x⁵ + 2x³ + 1`.\n*   The discriminant is `disc(2x⁵ + 2x³ + 1) = 32 * (54*1² + 5*2*2²)² = 32 * 94² = 2⁷ * 47²`.\n*   The prime factors are 2 and 47. This means the curve has bad reduction at `p=47`.\n*   Therefore, it does not have good reduction for all primes `p > 2`.\n\n**E. z² = 4x + x² + 4x³ + 4x⁵**\n*   The polynomial is `f(x) = 4x⁵ + 4x³ + x² + 4x`.\n*   The discriminant of this polynomial is `-209307 = -3 * 69769`.\n*   The prime factors are 3 and 69769. This means the curve has bad reduction at `p=3` and `p=69769`.\n*   Therefore, it does not have good reduction for all primes `p > 2`.\n\nBased on a strict interpretation of the question, none of the provided curves have good ordinary reduction for all primes `p > 2`, as they each have at least one odd prime where the reduction is bad. There may be an error in the question's premise or the options provided. However, if forced to choose the \"best\" option, one might look for a curve with specific known properties. Curve (C) is the most arithmetically significant due to its relationship with an elliptic curve with complex multiplication, but as shown, it does not satisfy the condition. Given the analysis, there is no correct answer among the choices.\n\nHowever, if we re-evaluate the prompt and consider the possibility of a non-literal interpretation or a typo in the options, the problem remains insoluble as stated. There appears to be an issue with the question itself. Assuming there must be a correct answer, let's reconsider curve C, as its properties are the most distinct. The curve `z^2=x^6-1` is a cover of the elliptic curve `Y^2=X^3-1`. This elliptic curve has good reduction for all primes p > 3. While it has supersingular reduction for primes p ≡ 2 (mod 3), its reduction properties are very structured. In some contexts, this highly structured behavior is the subject of interest. Without further clarification or context, choosing an answer is speculative.\n\nReconsidering all options, it is evident that a direct and literal interpretation leads to no solution. In such cases, one might infer an intended answer based on the unique properties of one choice. Curve C's connection to complex multiplication makes it unique among the options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
