    "Based on current scientific understanding, pristine, free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) would **not** be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). However, it may be possible to induce this phenomenon by modifying the nanosheets.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process. A fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit a second-order nonlinear response is that it must have a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure—that is, the crystal lattice must lack inversion symmetry.\n\nCommonly studied phases of free-standing borophene, such as the β₁₂ and δ₆ allotropes, are predicted to have centrosymmetric crystal structures. Similarly, the 8-Pmmn monolayer form of borophene also possesses inversion symmetry in its natural state. Due to this inherent symmetry, these forms of pristine borophene would have a zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) and therefore cannot facilitate SPDC.\n\nHowever, research suggests that the inversion symmetry in borophene can be broken under certain conditions:\n*   **Applying an Electric Field:** Theoretical studies show that applying an out-of-plane electric field to 8-Pmmn monolayer borophene can break the inversion symmetry, leading to a second-order nonlinear response.\n*   **Doping and Functionalization:** The electronic properties of borophene can be altered through surface modification. Theoretical calculations have shown that doping borophene clusters with super-alkali or superhalogen species can create asymmetry and significantly enhance the material's second-order nonlinear optical properties.\n\nTherefore, while SPDC is not an expected property of pristine, free-standing boron nanosheets, it is theoretically possible to engineer them to exhibit this behavior. Inducing non-centrosymmetry through methods like applying an external field or chemical doping could enable the material to perform spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\n<<<No, in their pristine state, free-standing boron nanosheets are generally expected to possess a crystal symmetry that prevents them from exhibiting second-order nonlinear optical effects like spontaneous parametric down-conversion. However, it is theoretically possible to induce this property by breaking the material's inversion symmetry through external means such as applying an electric field or through chemical doping.>>>"
