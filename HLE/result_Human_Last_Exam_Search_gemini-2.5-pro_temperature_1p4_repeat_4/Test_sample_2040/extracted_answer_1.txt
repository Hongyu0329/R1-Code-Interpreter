No, in their pristine state, free-standing boron nanosheets are generally expected to possess a crystal symmetry that prevents them from exhibiting second-order nonlinear optical effects like spontaneous parametric down-conversion. However, it is theoretically possible to induce this property by breaking the material's inversion symmetry through external means such as applying an electric field or through chemical doping.
