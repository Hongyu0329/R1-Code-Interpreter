    "### Eigenvalues Determined for p-Electron in Spin-Orbit Coupling\n\nIn the quantum mechanical problem of a p-electron considering spin-orbit coupling, the common eigenvalues of the total angular momentum squared ($J^2$) and its z-component ($J_z$) have been determined. The total angular momentum **J** is the sum of the orbital angular momentum **L** and the spin angular momentum **S**. Because the operators $J^2$ and $J_z$ commute, they share a common set of eigenstates, allowing for simultaneous eigenvalues.\n\nFor a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=1`. As an electron, its intrinsic spin quantum number is `s=1/2`. The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, can take values ranging from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n\nThis yields two possible values for `j`:\n*   `j = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2`\n*   `j = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2`\n\nThe eigenvalues for $J^2$ are given by the formula `ħ²j(j+1)`, and the eigenvalues for $J_z$ are given by `ħm_j`, where `m_j` can take `2j + 1` values from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n\nThis results in two sets of common eigenvalues, corresponding to the two possible values of `j`:\n\n**For the j = 3/2 state:**\n*   The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is `ħ² * (3/2) * (3/2 + 1) = (15/4)ħ²`.\n*   The possible eigenvalues of $J_z$ are `(3/2)ħ`, `(1/2)ħ`, `(-1/2)ħ`, and `(-3/2)ħ`, corresponding to `m_j` values of `3/2, 1/2, -1/2,` and `-3/2`.\n\n**For the j = 1/2 state:**\n*   The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is `ħ² * (1/2) * (1/2 + 1) = (3/4)ħ²`.\n*   The possible eigenvalues of $J_z$ are `(1/2)ħ` and `(-1/2)ħ`, corresponding to `m_j` values of `1/2` and `-1/2`.\n\nThese sets of eigenvalues represent the possible quantized values for the total angular momentum and its projection along the z-axis for a p-electron under spin-orbit interaction. This interaction lifts the degeneracy of the electronic states, leading to the fine structure observed in atomic spectra."
