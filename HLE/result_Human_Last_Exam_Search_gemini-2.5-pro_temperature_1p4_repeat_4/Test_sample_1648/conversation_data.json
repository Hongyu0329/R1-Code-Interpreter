    "The largest natural number n such that the (2n)th K-group of the ring of integers modulo 27, denoted K₂ₙ(ℤ/27), is nonzero is 2.\n\nThe computation of the algebraic K-groups of finite rings like ℤ/27 is a deep problem in mathematics. For degrees greater than one, these groups are finite abelian 3-groups. The calculation relies on advanced tools, particularly the relationship between algebraic K-theory and topological cyclic homology (TC), a refinement of Connes' cyclic homology.\n\nA theorem by Dundas, Goodwillie, and McCarthy implies that for a nilpotent extension of rings, the cyclotomic trace map from K-theory to TC is an equivalence for the p-primary components. Since Kₖ(ℤ/27) is a 3-group for k ≥ 2, its structure is identical to that of the 3-primary part of the topological cyclic homology group TCₖ(ℤ/27).\n\nThe definitive computation of these topological cyclic homology groups was carried out by Angeltveit, Gerhardt, Hill, and Lawson. Their paper provides explicit calculations for TCₖ(ℤ/pⁿ) for various p and n. For the case of ℤ/27 (where p=3, n=3), their results show:\n*   K₂(ℤ/27) is isomorphic to TC₂(ℤ/27) = ℤ/9. This is nonzero, so n=1 is a valid solution.\n*   K₄(ℤ/27) is isomorphic to TC₄(ℤ/27) = ℤ/3. This is nonzero, so n=2 is a valid solution.\n*   K₆(ℤ/27) is isomorphic to TC₆(ℤ/27) = 0.\n*   K₈(ℤ/27) is isomorphic to TC₈(ℤ/27) = 0.\n\nBased on the general formulas derived in their work, all higher even-degree K-groups K₂ₙ(ℤ/27) for n ≥ 3 are also zero. Therefore, the largest natural number n for which the group is nonzero is 2. Recent work by Antieau, Krause, and Nikolaus has developed algorithms that confirm these calculations and extend them, affirming the vanishing of the even K-groups in high degrees.\n\n<<<2>>>"
