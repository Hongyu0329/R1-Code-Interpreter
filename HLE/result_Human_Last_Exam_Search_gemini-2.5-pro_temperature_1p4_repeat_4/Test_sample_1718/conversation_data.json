    "On a general Riemannian manifold of real dimension $m$, the Riemann curvature tensor possesses a number of symmetries which reduce the number of its independent components. These symmetries are:\n*   Antisymmetry in its first two and last two indices: $R_{abcd} = -R_{bacd}$ and $R_{abcd} = -R_{abdc}$.\n*   Symmetry under the exchange of the first and second pair of indices: $R_{abcd} = R_{cdab}$.\n*   The first Bianchi identity, which is a cyclic symmetry over the last three indices: $R_{abcd} + R_{acdb} + R_{adbc} = 0$.\n\nDue to these symmetries, the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor on a generic $m$-dimensional Riemannian manifold is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{12}m^2(m^2-1)$.\n\nA Kähler manifold is a special type of Riemannian manifold. It is a complex manifold of complex dimension $n$ (and therefore real dimension $m=2n$) equipped with a Riemannian metric and a compatible complex structure $J$. This additional structure imposes further symmetries on the Riemann tensor.\n\nOn a Kähler manifold, in a local holomorphic coordinate system, the only potentially non-vanishing components of the curvature tensor are of the type $R_{i\\bar{j}k\\bar{l}}$, where indices $i, j, k, l$ run from 1 to $n$. These components satisfy the following additional symmetries beyond the standard ones translated into complex coordinates:\n*   $R_{i\\bar{j}k\\bar{l}} = R_{k\\bar{j}i\\bar{l}}$\n*   $R_{i\\bar{j}k\\bar{l}} = R_{i\\bar{l}k\\bar{j}}$\n\nThese identities imply that the tensor is symmetric in its unbarred indices ($i,k$) and also symmetric in its barred indices ($\\bar{j},\\bar{l}$). The number of ways to choose an unordered pair of indices with replacement from a set of $n$ is $\\binom{n+1}{2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. Since the choices for the unbarred and barred indices are independent, the number of independent complex components $R_{i\\bar{j}k\\bar{l}}$ is the product of the number of choices for each pair of indices.\n\nTherefore, the number of independent real components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension $n$ is given by the square of the number of components of a symmetric tensor of rank 2 on a space of dimension $n$.\n\nThe number of independent entries is:\n$(\\binom{n+1}{2})^2 = \\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)^2$\n\nFor instance:\n*   For a complex dimension $n=1$ (a Riemann surface), the real dimension is 2. The formula gives $(\\frac{1(2)}{2})^2 = 1$ independent component. This matches the result for any 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold.\n*   For a complex dimension $n=2$, the real dimension is 4. The formula gives $(\\frac{2(3)}{2})^2 = 9$ independent components. This is significantly less than the 20 independent components of the Riemann tensor on a general 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold.\n\n<<<The number of independent entries of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension $n$ is $\\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)^2$.>>>"
