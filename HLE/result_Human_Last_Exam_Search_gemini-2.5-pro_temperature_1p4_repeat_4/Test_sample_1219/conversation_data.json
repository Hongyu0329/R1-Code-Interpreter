    "To determine the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we must utilize the periodic nature of the tangent function. The tangent function has a period of π, which means that tan(x) = tan(x + kπ) for any integer k. Therefore, tan(10^100) is equivalent to tan(10^100 mod π).\n\nThe calculation of 10^100 mod π involves finding the remainder when 10^100 is divided by π. This can be expressed as:\n10^100 = kπ + y\nwhere *k* is an integer and *y* is the remainder, with 0 ≤ y < π. Consequently, tan(10^100) = tan(y).\n\nTo find *y*, we can calculate the fractional part of the division of 10^100 by π and then multiply it by π. Let's denote the fractional part of a number *x* as {*x*}.\ny = π * {10^100 / π}\n\nCalculating the fractional part of 10^100 / π requires a high-precision value of 1/π. The decimal expansion of 1/π begins as follows:\n1/π ≈ 0.31830988618379067153...\n\nWhen we multiply 1/π by 10^100, the decimal point shifts 100 places to the right. The resulting integer part corresponds to the first 100 digits of 1/π, and the fractional part is formed by the digits starting from the 101st position.\n\nA high-precision calculation of 1/π reveals that the digits starting from the 101st decimal place are 91041696... Therefore, the fractional part we are interested in is approximately 0.91041696.\n\nNow, we can approximate *y*:\ny ≈ π * 0.91041696\ny ≈ 3.14159265 * 0.91041696 ≈ 2.86018036\n\nFinally, we calculate the tangent of this value (in radians):\ntan(y) ≈ tan(2.86018036) ≈ -0.290036\n\nThe value is negative, which is expected since the angle 2.86018036 radians lies in the second quadrant (π/2 < y < π).\n\nThus, the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are 290.\n\n<<<290>>>"
