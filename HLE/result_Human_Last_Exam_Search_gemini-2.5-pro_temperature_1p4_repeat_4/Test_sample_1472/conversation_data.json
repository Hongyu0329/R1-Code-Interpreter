    "The molecule bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper can exist with copper in a +1 or +2 oxidation state, which significantly affects its geometry and, consequently, its symmetry point group.\n\n**Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)**\n\nIn the copper(I) complex, [Cu(dth)₂]⁺, the central copper atom has a d¹⁰ electron configuration and typically adopts a tetrahedral coordination geometry. The two bidentate 2,5-dithiahexane ligands (CH₃SCH₂CH₂SCH₃) each bind to the copper atom through their two sulfur atoms.\n\nThe crystal structure of the perchlorate salt, [Cu(2,5-dth)₂]ClO₄, reveals that the complex cation possesses a crystallographically imposed S₄ axis of improper rotation. This is a key symmetry element that defines the overall point group. The structure consists of the copper atom at the center of a tetrahedron of four sulfur atoms. The two five-membered chelate rings (Cu-S-C-C-S) are perpendicular to each other, a conformation dictated by the steric requirements of the ligands. The presence of an S₄ axis and the lack of other symmetry elements like mirror planes or an inversion center lead to the assignment of the **S₄** point group for the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) cation.\n\n**Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)**\n\nFor the copper(II) complex, [Cu(dth)₂]²⁺, the central atom has a d⁹ configuration. The crystal structure of [Cu(2,5-dth)₂(BF₄)₂] shows a different geometry. The copper(II) ion is located at a center of inversion. It is coordinated to the four sulfur atoms from the two ligands in a square planar arrangement. Additionally, there are weaker interactions with two fluoride atoms from the tetrafluoroborate counterions in the axial positions, resulting in a distorted octahedral geometry. The core [CuS₄] unit is planar. This centrosymmetric arrangement places the molecule in the **Cᵢ** point group, characterized by the presence of an inversion center (i).\n\n<<<S₄ for the Cu(I) complex and Cᵢ for the Cu(II) complex>>>"
