    "My initial breakdown was correct. Let's confirm with the search results.\n\n*   **For Hydrogen (H):** A 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set. For hydrogen, the 1s valence orbital is split into two parts: an inner part described by a contracted function of 3 primitive Gaussians, and an outer part described by a single primitive Gaussian. This results in **2 contracted basis functions** for each hydrogen atom.\n\n*   **For Carbon (C):** Carbon is a \"heavy atom\" (heavier than H or He).\n    *   **Core (1s):** The `6` in 6-31G indicates that the 1s core orbital is represented by a single contracted function made from 6 primitive Gaussians. So that's **1 basis function**.\n    *   **Valence (2s and 2p):** The `31` in 6-31G means the valence shell is split into two basis functions for each atomic orbital.\n        *   An inner set (2s' and 2p') is described by contracted functions of 3 primitive Gaussians each.\n        *   An outer set (2s'' and 2p'') is described by contracted functions of 1 primitive Gaussian each.\n    *   Since there is one `s` orbital and three `p` orbitals (px, py, pz) in the valence shell, this gives:\n        *   Inner: 1s-type function + 3 p-type functions = 4 basis functions.\n        *   Outer: 1s-type function + 3 p-type functions = 4 basis functions.\n    *   Total for Carbon = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 contracted basis functions**. This is confirmed by multiple sources.\n\n*   **For Toluene (C7H8):**\n    *   7 Carbon atoms × 9 basis functions/carbon = 63 basis functions.\n    *   8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 basis functions/hydrogen = 16 basis functions.\n    *   Total contracted Gaussian functions = 63 + 16 = 79.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward based on the definition of the 6-31G basis set. I have confirmed the number of functions for both Carbon and Hydrogen and performed the final calculation. I am confident in the result.\n\n<<<For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), the number of contracted Gaussian functions can be determined by calculating the functions for each atom and summing them.\n\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n    *   The 6-31G basis set treats core and valence electrons differently.\n    *   The core 1s orbital is represented by **1 contracted function** (from the `6` in 6-31G).\n    *   The valence shell (2s and 2p orbitals) is split. An inner set of orbitals (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz) is described by **4 contracted functions**, and an outer set is also described by **4 contracted functions**.\n    *   This gives a total of 1 + 4 + 4 = **9 contracted basis functions per carbon atom**.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n    *   Hydrogen only has a valence 1s orbital.\n    *   The 6-31G basis set splits this into two parts: an inner part and an outer part, resulting in **2 contracted basis functions per hydrogen atom**.\n\n*   **Total for Toluene (C7H8):**\n    *   There are 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total functions from carbon: 7 atoms * 9 functions/atom = 63 functions.\n    *   Total functions from hydrogen: 8 atoms * 2 functions/atom = 16 functions.\n    *   The total number of contracted Gaussian functions is 63 + 16 = 79.\n\n>>>79"
