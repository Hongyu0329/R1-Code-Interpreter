    "There are four non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nFinite Weyl groups are classified by irreducible root systems, which are in turn classified by connected Dynkin diagrams. The rank of the Weyl group corresponds to the number of nodes in its associated Dynkin diagram.\n\nThe irreducible Dynkin diagrams of rank 4 are:\n*   **A₄**\n*   **B₄**\n*   **C₄**\n*   **D₄**\n*   **F₄**\n\nThis gives rise to the Weyl groups W(A₄), W(B₄), W(C₄), W(D₄), and W(F₄). However, it is a known result in the theory of Lie algebras and reflection groups that the Weyl groups of type Bₙ and Cₙ are isomorphic for n ≥ 2. Therefore, W(B₄) and W(C₄) are isomorphic.\n\nCounting the distinct isomorphism classes, we have:\n1.  W(A₄)\n2.  W(B₄) ≅ W(C₄)\n3.  W(D₄)\n4.  W(F₄)\n\nThus, there are 4 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
