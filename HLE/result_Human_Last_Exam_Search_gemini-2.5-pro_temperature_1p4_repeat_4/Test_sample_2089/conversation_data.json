    "In the Oscar-winning 1969 film *Midnight Cowboy*, the character of Enrico \"Ratso\" Rizzo, played by Dustin Hoffman, seals his fate with a quiet \"Thank you\" while on a bus to Florida with his friend Joe Buck, portrayed by Jon Voight.\n\nThe poignant scene unfolds as the two are on a Greyhound bus, fulfilling Ratso's dream of escaping the harsh streets of New York City for the warmth of Miami. Ailing and frail, Ratso's health deteriorates rapidly during the journey. After Joe helps him get comfortable by pulling down the window shade, a barely audible Ratso whispers, \"Thanks, Joe.\" These are among his final words.\n\nShortly after this moment, Joe, full of optimistic plans for their new life in Florida, discovers that Ratso has quietly passed away in his sleep. The bus continues to its destination with Joe sitting beside his deceased friend, a tragic culmination of their unlikely bond.\n\n*Midnight Cowboy* was a critical success, earning Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director for John Schlesinger, and Best Adapted Screenplay for Waldo Salt. Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman received Oscar nominations for their performances.\n\n<<<Midnight Cowboy>>>"
