    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue (which is green) and blue itself is **G**.\n\nIn his work, Newton created an analogy between the seven colors of the spectrum and the seven notes of a musical scale. He arranged the colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet in a circular pattern, associating them with the notes of the Dorian musical mode, which begins on the note D.\n\nThe color produced by mixing yellow and blue is green. According to Newton's system, the primary colors of red, yellow, and blue correspond to the primary triad of the D scale. Specifically, red is associated with the note D, yellow with the note F, and blue with the note A. Following the sequence of the Dorian scale (D, E, F, G, A, B, C), the color green falls between yellow and blue and is therefore associated with the musical note G.\n\nTherefore, the range between green and blue on Newton's color circle corresponds to the musical note G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
