In the context of the functional integral representation of the partition function in finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product $(\phi, D_\phi)$ is given by the kinetic part of the Euclidean action. It is expressed as: $(\phi, D_\phi) = \int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^d x \, \phi(x, \tau) (-\partial^2_E) \phi(x, \tau)$, where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature, $\tau$ is the imaginary time, $x$ are the spatial coordinates, and $-\partial^2_E = -(\partial_\tau^2 + \nabla^2)$ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator. After integration by parts, this becomes $\int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^d x [(\partial_\tau \phi)^2 + (\nabla \phi)^2]$.
