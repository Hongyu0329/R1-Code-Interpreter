    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function for a neutral scalar field $\\phi$ is given by a functional integral over all field configurations. The inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ corresponds to the kinetic part of the Euclidean action in the exponent of this integral.\n\nThe partition function $Z$ is defined as:\n\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{D}\\phi$ is the functional measure and $S_E[\\phi]$ is the Euclidean action for the scalar field. The theory is formulated in Euclidean spacetime, where the time coordinate is compactified to a circle of circumference $\\beta = 1/T$, with $T$ being the temperature.\n\nThe Euclidean action for a neutral scalar field $\\phi$ is given by:\n\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\left( \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + V(\\phi) \\right)$\n\nHere, $\\tau$ is the imaginary time, $x$ represents the spatial coordinates, and $V(\\phi)$ is the potential for the field. The kinetic part of this action can be written using the four-dimensional Euclidean Laplacian, $\\partial^2_E = \\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2$.\n\nThe kinetic term of the action can be expressed as:\n\n$S_{E, \\text{kin}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(-\\partial^2_E) \\phi$\n\nwhere $d^4x_E = d\\tau d^d x$.\n\nIn this context, the operator $D_\\phi$ is the negative of the Euclidean d'Alembertian operator, which is the Klein-Gordon operator in Euclidean space:\n\n$D_\\phi = -\\partial^2_E = -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2)$\n\nThe inner product of $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ in the functional integral representation of the partition function is therefore given by the integral of $\\phi$ multiplied by the action of the operator $D_\\phi$ on $\\phi$. After an integration by parts and neglecting boundary terms (which is justified by the periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time for a bosonic field), this inner product is equivalent to the kinetic part of the Euclidean action.\n\nTherefore, the inner product is:\n\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(x, \\tau) (-\\partial^2_E) \\phi(x, \\tau) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\left( (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2 \\right)$\n\nThis expression represents the kinetic energy of the scalar field in the finite-temperature setting.\n\n<<<In the context of the functional integral representation of the partition function in finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is given by the kinetic part of the Euclidean action. It is expressed as: $(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(x, \\tau) (-\\partial^2_E) \\phi(x, \\tau)$, where $\\beta$ is the inverse temperature, $\\tau$ is the imaginary time, $x$ are the spatial coordinates, and $-\\partial^2_E = -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2)$ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator. After integration by parts, this becomes $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x [(\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2]$.>>>"
