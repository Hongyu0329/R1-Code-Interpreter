    "The chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is most commonly known as Rhodamine B. While the exact chemical composition of Crayola crayon colors is a trade secret, the properties of Rhodamine B strongly indicate its use in one of the brand's fluorescent pink or magenta crayons.\n\nRhodamine B is a synthetic pigment and a fluorescent dye with a magenta-pink color. It is listed with the Colour Index International as C.I. 45170.\n\nCrayola has produced several fluorescent crayons with colors that match the description of Rhodamine B, including 'Shocking Pink', 'Razzle Dazzle Rose', and 'Hot Magenta'. 'Razzle Dazzle Rose' was named in 1990, but from 1972 to 1990, it was sold under the name 'Hot Magenta'. The 'Shocking Pink' crayon, introduced in 1972, is part of Crayola's \"Neon Crayons\" line, and is noted to glow under a blacklight, a characteristic property of fluorescent dyes like Rhodamine B.\n\nAlthough Crayola does not publicly disclose the specific pigments used in their products, the vibrant, fluorescent pink-magenta color of Rhodamine B makes it the most probable pigment for the crayon color 'Shocking Pink' and other similarly colored fluorescent crayons like 'Razzle Dazzle Rose'.\n\n<<<Shocking Pink>>>"
