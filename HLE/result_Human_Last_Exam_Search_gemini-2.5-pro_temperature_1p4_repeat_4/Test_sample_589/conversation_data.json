    "After a thorough investigation, there is no definitive evidence of a widely recognized Hollywood feature film from a major studio that contains a scene where a teenager rides a pink bike and pedals directly toward an oncoming car.\n\nNumerous searches across various platforms and forums have been conducted to identify such a film. While there are discussions and recollections of similar scenes, none have pointed to a specific, verifiable movie that matches all the described criteria.\n\nMentions of bicycles in films are common, and some movies feature pink bicycles, such as in the 1985 film *The Goonies*. However, the specific scene of a teenager confronting an oncoming car on a pink bike is not a well-documented or recognized moment in a major Hollywood feature film. It is possible the scene is from a lesser-known independent film, a foreign film, a television show, or that the details have been misremembered.\n\nDue to the lack of a conclusive match after extensive searching, it is not possible to name a specific film that fits the user's description.\n\n<<<I am unable to identify the film based on the information provided and the search results.>>>"
