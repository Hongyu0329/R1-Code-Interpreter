    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. For an E2 reaction to occur in a cyclohexane system, the leaving group (bromide) and a beta-hydrogen must be in an anti-periplanar, or trans-diaxial, orientation.\n\nThe starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, is a *cis* isomer, meaning the bromine and the methyl group are on the same side of the ring. To undergo elimination, the molecule must adopt a chair conformation where the bromine atom is in an axial position. In this conformation, the methyl group at the adjacent carbon (C2) is in an equatorial position.\n\nThere are two types of beta-hydrogens to consider for elimination:\n1.  **Hydrogen on C2:** In the required chair conformation (with Br being axial), the hydrogen on C2 is also axial. This means it is *syn-periplanar* (on the same side) to the axial bromine, not anti-periplanar. Therefore, elimination cannot occur at this position.\n2.  **Hydrogens on C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is axial, and one is equatorial. The axial hydrogen on C6 is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1.\n\nDue to the strict stereochemical requirement of the E2 reaction, the potassium tert-butoxide (a strong, bulky base) will abstract the only available anti-periplanar proton, which is the axial hydrogen on C6. This results in the formation of a double bond between carbon 1 and carbon 6.\n\nThis outcome leads to the formation of the less substituted alkene, which is known as the Hofmann product. The more substituted Zaitsev product, 1-methylcyclohexene, cannot be formed because it would require the removal of the hydrogen from C2, which is not correctly positioned for an E2 elimination.\n\nTherefore, the product of the reaction is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
