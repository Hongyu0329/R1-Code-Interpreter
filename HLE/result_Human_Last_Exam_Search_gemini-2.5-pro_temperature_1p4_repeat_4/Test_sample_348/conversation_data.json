    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand functions are equal. Total welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus.\n\nGiven functions:\n*   **Supply:** \\(P = \\ln(Q^3 - 2)\\)\n*   **Demand:** \\(P = 18e^{-\\arctan(Q)}\\)\n\n**1. Market Equilibrium**\n\nWe set the supply and demand equations equal to each other to find the equilibrium quantity (\\(Q_E\\)):\n\\(\\ln(Q_E^3 - 2) = 18e^{-\\arctan(Q_E)}\\)\n\nThis equation does not have a simple analytical solution and must be solved numerically. By using computational methods, we find the equilibrium quantity to be approximately:\n\\(Q_E \\approx 4.7176\\)\n\nSubstituting \\(Q_E\\) into the demand function gives the equilibrium price (\\(P_E\\)):\n\\(P_E = 18e^{-\\arctan(4.7176)} \\approx 18e^{-1.361} \\approx 4.6346\\)\n\n**2. Total Welfare Calculation**\n\nTotal welfare is the area between the demand curve and the supply curve from the minimum quantity to the equilibrium quantity. It can be calculated by summing the consumer surplus and producer surplus.\n\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS)** is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price.\n    \\(CS = \\int_{0}^{Q_E} D(Q) dQ - P_E \\cdot Q_E\\)\n\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS)** is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price. The supply function is defined for \\(Q^3 - 2 > 0\\), so the integration starts from \\(Q = \\sqrt{2}\\).\n    \\(PS = P_E \\cdot Q_E - \\int_{\\sqrt{2}}^{Q_E} S(Q) dQ\\)\n\nTotal Welfare (TW) is the sum of these two surpluses:\n\\(TW = CS + PS = \\int_{0}^{Q_E} D(Q) dQ - \\int_{\\sqrt{2}}^{Q_E} S(Q) dQ\\)\n\nWe perform numerical integration to find the values of these definite integrals:\n\n*   Integral of the demand function from 0 to \\(Q_E\\):\n    \\(\\int_{0}^{4.7176} 18e^{-\\arctan(Q)} dQ \\approx 33.323\\)\n\n*   Integral of the supply function from \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) to \\(Q_E\\):\n    \\(\\int_{1.2599}^{4.7176} \\ln(Q^3 - 2) dQ \\approx 11.000\\)\n\nFinally, the total welfare is the difference between these two integrals:\n\\(TW \\approx 33.323 - 11.000 = 22.323\\)\n\n<<<22.323>>>"
