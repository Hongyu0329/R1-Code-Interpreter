    "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$, where $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are cubic polynomials with derivatives that are always positive.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of f(x) and g(x)\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3.\n$f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$, with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\n$g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$, with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n\nThe derivatives are quadratic polynomials:\n$f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$\n$g'(x) = 3b_3x^2 + 2b_2x + b_1$\n\nWe are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$. For a quadratic function $Ax^2 + Bx + C$ to be always positive, it must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  The parabola must open upwards, which means the leading coefficient is positive. So, $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$ and $3b_3 > 0 \\implies b_3 > 0$.\n2.  The quadratic must have no real roots, meaning its discriminant is negative.\n    *   For $f'(x)$: $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 - 12a_1a_3 < 0 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$.\n    *   For $g'(x)$: $(2b_2)^2 - 4(3b_3)(b_1) < 0 \\implies 4b_2^2 - 12b_1b_3 < 0 \\implies b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\n\nThe condition that the derivatives are always positive implies that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions for all $x$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the composite function h(x) = f(g(x))\nWe are looking for the number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$, which are the solutions to the equation $h(x) = x$.\n\n*   **Degree of the composite function:** Since $f$ and $g$ are both of degree 3, their composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   **The equation for fixed points:** The fixed points are the roots of the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. Since $f(g(x))$ is a degree 9 polynomial, $P(x)$ is also a degree 9 polynomial.\n*   **Upper bound on the number of roots:** By the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n### Step 3: Determine if 9 fixed points are achievable\nNow, we must determine if it is possible to find polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and for which $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0$ has 9 distinct real roots.\n\nBy Rolle's Theorem, if a differentiable function $P(x)$ has $k$ distinct real roots, then its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least $k-1$ distinct real roots.\n*   If $P(x)$ were to have 9 real roots, then its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least 8 real roots.\n*   If $P'(x)$ were to have 8 real roots, then its derivative $P''(x)$ must have at least 7 real roots.\n\nLet's examine the derivatives of $P(x)$:\n$P(x) = h(x) - x = f(g(x)) - x$\n\n**First Derivative:**\n$P'(x) = h'(x) - 1 = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\nThe degree of $h'(x)$ can be calculated as follows:\n*   deg($f'(x)$) = 2\n*   deg($g(x)$) = 3\n*   deg($g'(x)$) = 2\n*   deg($f'(g(x))$) = deg($f'$) $\\times$ deg($g$) = 2 $\\times$ 3 = 6.\n*   deg($h'(x)$) = deg($f'(g(x))$) + deg($g'(x)$) = 6 + 2 = 8.\nSo, $P'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. A polynomial of degree 8 can have at most 8 real roots. This is consistent with our requirement.\n\n**Second Derivative:**\n$P''(x) = h''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} [f'(g(x))g'(x)]$.\nUsing the product rule and chain rule:\n$h''(x) = f''(g(x)) \\cdot (g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x)) \\cdot g''(x)$.\nLet's determine the degree of $h''(x)$:\n*   deg($f''(x)$) = 1\n*   deg($g''(x)$) = 1\n*   deg($f''(g(x))$) = 1 $\\times$ 3 = 3\n*   deg($(g'(x))^2$) = 2 $\\times$ 2 = 4\n*   deg($f''(g(x)) (g'(x))^2$) = 3 + 4 = 7\n*   deg($f'(g(x)) g''(x)$) = 6 + 1 = 7\nThe leading terms of both parts do not cancel out (the leading coefficients are $54a_3b_3^3$ and $18a_3b_3^3$, both positive). Thus, the degree of $h''(x)$ is 7.\n\nSo, $P''(x) = h''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7. A polynomial of degree 7 can have up to 7 distinct real roots.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe argument proceeds as follows:\n1.  It is possible to choose the coefficients of a general degree 7 polynomial such that it has 7 distinct real roots. While $h''(x)$ has a specific structure determined by the coefficients of $f$ and $g$, the constraints $f'>0$ and $g'>0$ still allow enough freedom to construct an $h''(x)$ with 7 distinct real roots.\n2.  If we choose $f$ and $g$ such that $h''(x)$ has 7 distinct real roots, then $h'(x)$ (a polynomial of degree 8) will have 7 distinct local extrema.\n3.  The graph of the 8th-degree polynomial $h'(x)$ has 4 local minima and 3 local maxima. It is possible to choose the parameters of $f$ and $g$ to adjust the vertical position of this graph. We can set it up such that the 3 local maxima are all greater than 1 and the 4 local minima are all less than 1. This would ensure that the equation $h'(x) = 1$ (or $P'(x)=0$) has 8 distinct real roots.\n4.  If $P'(x)$ has 8 distinct real roots, then by Rolle's Theorem, its integral $P(x)$ can have at most $8+1=9$ distinct real roots.\n5.  Since $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9, it is indeed possible for it to have 9 real roots.\n\nThus, it is theoretically possible to construct cubic polynomials $f$ and $g$ with positive derivatives such that $f(g(x))$ has 9 fixed points.\n\nThe maximum number of fixed points is the maximum number of real roots of a degree 9 polynomial, which is 9.\n\n"
