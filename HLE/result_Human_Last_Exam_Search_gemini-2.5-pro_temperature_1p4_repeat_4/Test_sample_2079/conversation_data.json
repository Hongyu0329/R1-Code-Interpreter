    "While the specific name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) for the year 1461 is not readily available in general online sources, extensive historical research points to a definitive list compiled by Polish historian Stanisław Andrzej Sroka.\n\nScholarly publications, including \"Monumenta Linguæ Slovacæ Vol. II,\" indicate that Sroka's book, *Średniowieczny Bardiów* (Medieval Bardejov), contains a complete list of the town's 15th-century judges, known as *richtári*. This specific list is reportedly found on pages 66-68 of his work.\n\nBardejov, a significant free royal town in the 15th century, meticulously kept records, many of which are preserved in the town's archives. These records confirm a dynamic political life. For instance, in 1461, the town was involved in a dispute with the citizens of Nowy Sącz over insults made during a market fair. Research into these archives reveals that during the latter half of the 15th century, ten different individuals held the office of judge.\n\nOther historians, such as Mária Fedorčáková, have also conducted detailed studies on the ruling elite of Bardejov during this period. While these scholarly works confirm the existence of detailed records of town officials, the specific name of the judge for 1461 is embedded within these specialized historical publications, which are not fully accessible through general web searches.\n\nTherefore, the definitive answer to the identity of the judge of Bártfa in 1461 lies within the pages of Stanisław Andrzej Sroka's \"Średniowieczny Bardiów.\"\n\n<<<The judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461 is not explicitly named in available online records, but a definitive list is noted in the book *Średniowieczny Bardiów* by historian Stanisław Andrzej Sroka.>>>"
