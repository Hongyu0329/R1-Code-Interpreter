It is not definitively true that the second postulate of special relativity is superfluous and can be deduced from the first. While applying the first postulate to Maxwell's equations suggests the constancy of the speed of light, this argument relies on implicit assumptions. The mainstream scientific view is that the two postulates are independent, and a rigorous derivation of the Lorentz transformations requires an explicit assumption about the invariance of a particular speed.
