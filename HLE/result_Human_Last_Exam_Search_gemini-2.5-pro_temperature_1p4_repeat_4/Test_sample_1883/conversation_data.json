    "Under thermal conditions, (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene undergoes an 8π electrocyclic ring closure. This pericyclic reaction's stereochemistry is governed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, which can be rationalized using Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory.\n\nFor an 8π electron system, which is a 4n system where n=2, the thermal electrocyclization proceeds in a conrotatory fashion. This is determined by the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the linear tetraene. In the ground state, the HOMO of an octatetraene is ψ₄. The p-orbitals at the termini (C-2 and C-9) of the conjugated system have lobes of the same phase on opposite sides of the plane of the molecule. To achieve constructive, in-phase overlap to form the new sigma bond, the termini must rotate in the same direction, i.e., both clockwise or both counter-clockwise.\n\nThe stereochemistry of the starting material, (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, dictates the stereochemistry of the products. Let's analyze the two possible conrotatory pathways:\n\n**Pathway 1: Inward rotation of methyl groups**\nIf both terminal methyl groups rotate inwards, they will both end up on the same side of the newly formed eight-membered ring, resulting in the *cis*-isomer (A). However, this pathway involves significant steric hindrance between the two methyl groups in the transition state as they are forced towards each other.\n\n**Pathway 2: Outward rotation of methyl groups**\nIf both terminal methyl groups rotate outwards, they will end up on opposite sides of the ring, leading to the formation of the *trans*-isomer (B). This pathway avoids the severe steric clash present in the inward rotation.\n\nAccording to FMO theory and considering steric effects, the transition state leading to the *trans*-isomer (B) is significantly lower in energy than the transition state leading to the *cis*-isomer (A). The outward rotation of the substituents is generally preferred to minimize steric repulsion. Therefore, the reaction will overwhelmingly favor the path of outward rotation.\n\nThis leads to the prediction that the *trans*-isomer (B) will be the major product, while the *cis*-isomer (A) will be the minor product. The ratio of B to A is expected to be very high. Experimental evidence confirms that for similar 8π electrocyclizations, the conrotatory process leading to the less sterically hindered product is strongly favored.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of A to B will be small, meaning B is the major product. While an exact numerical ratio requires detailed computational analysis, qualitatively, the trans-isomer (B) is heavily favored.\n\n<<<The ratio of A:B will be significantly less than 1, with B being the major product."
