    "During the period of World War II preceding the armistice of June 22, 1940, the largest French warship sunk by a German U-boat was the submarine **Doris**.\n\nThe *Doris*, a *Circ√©*-class submarine, was sunk by the German submarine U-9 on May 8, 1940, off the Dutch coast. The submarine had a surface displacement of 552 tons (615 tonnes) and a submerged displacement of 773 tons (820 tonnes). At the time of its sinking, the *Doris* was operating under British command.\n\nSeveral other French warships were lost during this period, including destroyers off Dunkirk in May and June 1940. However, these losses were attributed to aerial bombardments and subsequent scuttling or torpedoing by friendly forces to prevent capture, rather than direct U-boat action. Another submarine, the *Morse*, was lost to a mine in May 1940.\n\n<<<Doris>>>"
