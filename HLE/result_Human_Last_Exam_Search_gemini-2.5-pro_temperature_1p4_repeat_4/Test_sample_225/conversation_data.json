    "The curve described by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t) is a type of graph known as a Lissajous curve. To find the number of self-intersection points, we can use a specific formula for Lissajous curves of the form x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are integers.\n\nA self-intersection occurs when the curve crosses over itself at the same point for different values of the parameter 't'. For Lissajous curves where 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers, the number of self-intersection points can be calculated. In the interior of the curve's bounding box, this number is given by the formula (a-1)(b-1)/2.\n\nIn this specific case, the parametric equations are given by:\n*   x(t) = cos(9t)\n*   y(t) = sin(5t)\n\nHere, a = 9 and b = 5. First, we check if 'a' and 'b' are coprime, which means their greatest common divisor is 1. The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5 is indeed 1, so they are coprime.\n\nNow, we can apply the formula for the number of self-intersection points:\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = (8)(4) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 32 / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 16\n\nTherefore, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
