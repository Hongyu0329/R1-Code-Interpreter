    "In the context of surface codes, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded depends on the topology of the surface on which the code is defined. For a given patch of surface code, introducing holes is a way to increase its capacity for storing logical information.\n\nHere's how to determine the number of logical qubits:\n\n*   **Single Patch with Holes:** For a single, planar patch of surface code (which has a genus of 0), the number of logical qubits it can encode is equal to the number of holes created within it. So, a patch with *h* holes can encode *h* logical qubits. A figure in one study, for instance, shows a surface code with two closed holes that encodes two logical qubits.\n\n*   **Multiple Patches:** When you have multiple, separate patches of surface code, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits encoded in each individual patch. These patches can be used to perform operations between the logical qubits they contain.\n\nGiven the problem of \"two patches of surface code with two holes,\" this is most commonly interpreted as each of the two patches having two holes.\n\nFollowing this interpretation:\n*   Each patch has 2 holes, so each patch can encode 2 logical qubits.\n*   With two such patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum from both: 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, at most, 4 logical qubits can be encoded.\n\n<<<4>>>"
