    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function, G(r, t), is fundamentally known as the **dynamic structure factor**, often denoted as S(k,ω). This quantity is central to the theory of scattering physics.\n\nHowever, in the context of the nuclear criticality community, the most commonly used term for the experimentally measured quantity that is directly proportional to the dynamic structure factor is the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**. Specifically, it can be referred to as the Auto-Power Spectral Density (APSD) if a single detector's signal is analyzed, or the Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD) if signals from two different detectors are correlated.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function G(**r**, t) describes the probability of finding a particle at position **r** at time t, given that there was a particle at the origin at time t=0. Its double Fourier transform with respect to space and time provides the dynamic structure factor S(**k**,ω), where **k** is the wavevector (related to momentum transfer) and ω is the angular frequency (related to energy transfer).\n\nIn nuclear criticality analysis, experimental techniques known as \"neutron noise analysis\" are used to study the correlations in the neutron population. These techniques measure the fluctuations in detector signals over time. The Power Spectral Density of these signals, which is the Fourier transform of the temporal autocorrelation function of the detector counts, is a primary observable. The PSD of the neutron noise is directly related to the dynamic structure factor and provides information about the kinetic parameters of the nuclear system, such as the prompt neutron decay constant (α). Therefore, while S(k,ω) is the underlying physical quantity, the PSD is the common operational term used in the criticality safety community.\n\n<<<Power Spectral Density>>>"
