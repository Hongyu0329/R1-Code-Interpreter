    "While there are several mushroom species that are blue in color, there is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print. Spore print color is a key characteristic for mushroom identification, and blue is not a documented color for spore prints.\n\nSome well-known blue mushrooms and their actual spore print colors include:\n\n*   ***Entoloma hochstetteri***: This vibrant blue mushroom, native to New Zealand, has a reddish-pink spore print. The \"pinkgill\" in its common name, blue pinkgill, refers to the color of its spore-bearing gills.\n*   ***Lactarius indigo***: Known as the indigo milk cap, this mushroom bleeds a blue milky latex when cut. However, its spore print is a yellowish-cream color.\n*   ***Stropharia caerulea***: Commonly called the blue roundhead, this mushroom has a purple-black spore print.\n*   ***Panaeolus cyanescens***: This species, which turns blue when bruised, produces a black spore print.\n*   ***Cortinarius rotundisporus***: This elegant blue webcap has a reddish-brown spore print.\n\nThe color of a mushroom's spores is determined by the pigments they contain, and while various shades of white, cream, yellow, pink, brown, purple, and black are common, a true blue spore print has not been observed in the fungal kingdom.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
