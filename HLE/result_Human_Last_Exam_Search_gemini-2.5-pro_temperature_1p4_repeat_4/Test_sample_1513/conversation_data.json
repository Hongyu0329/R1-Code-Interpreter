Its nearest inhabited neighbor is Pitcairn Island, which is approximately 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) away.\n*   **Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera:** The town of Hanga Roa is situated on the island's west coast, nestled in the lowlands between the extinct volcanoes of Terevaka and Rano Kau. The island itself is of volcanic origin, and the prominent Rano Kau is a large volcanic caldera with a crater lake. Hanga Roa sits on a bay that is an integral part of this volcanic landscape.\n*   **Shares the town's name:** The town and the bay it sits on are both named Hanga Roa, which means \"long bay\" or \"wide bay\" in the Rapa Nui language.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
