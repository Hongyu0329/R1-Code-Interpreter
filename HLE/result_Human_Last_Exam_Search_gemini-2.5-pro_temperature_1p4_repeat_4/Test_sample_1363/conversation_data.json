    "The technique of the European Tango is distinct from the other standard ballroom dances. A core principle of the Tango is its staccato movement, proceeding in straight lines without the sway or rise and fall characteristic of the waltz or foxtrot. Turns in Tango are executed with precise foot placements and body rotation (Contra Body Movement or CBM), maintaining a flat, grounded connection to the floor.\n\nIn swing dances like the Waltz or Foxtrot, a degree of overturning on a reverse turn is possible and can be used to navigate a corner, for example. This is facilitated by the use of body sway. In contrast, attempting to overturn a reverse turn in Tango would force a dancer to introduce sway, which is fundamentally incorrect technique for this dance. The feet in a Tango turn are meant to track with precision; overturning would disrupt this, leading to incorrect footwork and a loss of the characteristic staccato action. While there are advanced Tango figures like the \"Overturned Five Step\" or an overturned \"Natural Twist Turn,\" these are specific, named variations and distinct from simply overturning a standard reverse turn, which would violate the foundational technique.\n\nThe other dances listed—Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep—all incorporate sway and continuous, flowing movement, which allows for more flexibility in the amount of rotation in a turn without it being a technical violation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
