    "In group theory, a \"power subgroup\" refers to a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element. To determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, we first need to understand its structure and then count its distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group Q_2n is of order 2^n. For Q_128, the order is 128 = 2^7, so n=7. These groups are defined by the presentation:\n\nQ_2n = < x, y | x^(2^(n-1)) = 1, x^(2^(n-2)) = y^2, yxy^(-1) = x^(-1) >\n\nFor Q_128, this becomes:\n\nQ_128 = < x, y | x^64 = 1, x^32 = y^2, yxy^(-1) = x^(-1) >\n\nThe cyclic subgroups of Q_128 can be divided into two categories: those that are subgroups of the cyclic group <x>, and those that are not.\n\n1.  **Cyclic subgroups within <x>**: The subgroup <x> is a cyclic group of order 64. A cyclic group of a given order has exactly one subgroup for each divisor of its order. The divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. This gives a total of 7 cyclic subgroups.\n\n2.  **Cyclic subgroups not contained in <x>**: The elements outside of <x> are of the form x^k * y, where k is an integer from 0 to 63. The order of any such element is 4. Each of these elements generates a cyclic subgroup of order 4. To find the number of distinct subgroups, we must account for the fact that each cyclic group of order 4 has two generators. There are 64 elements of the form x^k * y, so there are 64 / 2 = 32 distinct cyclic subgroups of this type.\n\nCombining these two sets of subgroups, we have 7 subgroups from <x> and 32 additional subgroups, none of which are duplicates. This gives a total of 7 + 32 = 39 power subgroups.\n\nThis result is confirmed by a known formula for the number of cyclic subgroups, c(G), in a generalized quaternion group Q_2n. The formula is:\n\nc(Q_2n) = 2^(n-2) + n\n\nFor Q_128, where n=7, the calculation is:\n\nc(Q_128) = 2^(7-2) + 7 = 2^5 + 7 = 32 + 7 = 39\n\nTherefore, there are 39 power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n<<<39>>>"
