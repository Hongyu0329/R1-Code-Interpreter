The quantum correction to the conductivity for an electron in a bulk semiconductor due to weak localization is negative (meaning it increases resistivity) and is proportional to the inverse of the phase coherence length, l_φ. The correction can be expressed as **Δσ ≈ - C \* (e²/ħ) \* (1/l_φ)**, where 'e' is the elementary charge, 'ħ' is the reduced Planck constant, and 'C' is a constant of order unity. The phase coherence length is temperature-dependent (l_φ ∝ T^(-p/2)), which gives the quantum correction a characteristic power-law dependence on temperature. In the case of electron-electron scattering being the dominant dephasing mechanism, p can take values such as 3/2, leading to **Δσ ∝ -T^(3/4)**.
