This case requires a multi-phased approach. **Immediate Management** involves medical consultation to stabilize her diabetes, delayed replantation of the avulsed teeth (left lateral incisor, canine, first premolar) after extra-oral root canal treatment to act as bone-preserving space maintainers, and flexible splinting for four weeks. The key **cells of interest** are the necrotic periodontal ligament cells, which will lead to healing by ankylosis driven by osteoclasts and osteoblasts. **Definitive Management** will occur after her diabetes is controlled. The recommended long-term solution is a **removable partial denture (RPD)** with a Cobalt-Chromium framework and acrylic base, which is necessary due to the challenging long span and the patient's Class III skeletal pattern (SNB 88Â°). The **abutment teeth** will be the left second premolar and left central incisor as primary abutments, with the right first molar and first premolar used as secondary abutments to provide cross-arch stabilization and indirect retention.
