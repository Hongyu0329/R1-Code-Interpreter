    "To solve this problem with maximum memory efficiency, we must avoid storing the second string in memory. The first string must be stored in a buffer because we need to access its characters while reading the second string from the subsequent input line.\n\nThe most memory-efficient C program would:\n1.  Declare a character array to store the first string. The problem states a maximum length of 100, so a buffer of size 101 is required to accommodate the 100 characters plus the null terminator (`\\0`).\n2.  Declare a single character variable to hold each character of the second string as it is read.\n3.  Declare a small integer-type variable to use as an index for traversing the first string's buffer.\n\nHere is the most memory-efficient C program:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n    // A buffer for the first string (100 chars + 1 null terminator).\n    char str1[101];\n\n    // A variable to hold one character of the second string at a time.\n    char char2;\n\n    // An index for str1. Max length is 100, so a char is sufficient.\n    unsigned char i = 0;\n\n    // Read the first string into the buffer.\n    scanf(\"%s\", str1);\n\n    // Loop while there are characters in the first string.\n    while (str1[i]) { // This is equivalent to while(str1[i] != '\\0')\n        // Read a single character from the second string, skipping whitespace.\n        // The space in \" %c\" is crucial for consuming the newline after the first string.\n        scanf(\" %c\", &char2);\n\n        // Convert characters to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n        int lower1 = tolower((unsigned char)str1[i]);\n        int lower2 = tolower((unsigned char)char2);\n\n        if (lower1 < lower2) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        if (lower1 > lower2) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        \n        i++; // Move to the next character.\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation\n\nWe calculate the total memory (`m`) by summing the sizes of the variables declared in the program:\n\n*   **`char str1[101];`**: This is an array of 101 characters. In C, `sizeof(char)` is guaranteed to be 1 byte. So, this array uses `101 * 1 = 101` bytes.\n*   **`char char2;`**: A single character variable. This uses `sizeof(char) = 1` byte.\n*   **`unsigned char i;`**: An index variable. Since the string length is at most 100, an `unsigned char` (which can hold values from 0 to 255) is sufficient and more memory-efficient than a standard `int` (which is typically 4 bytes). This uses `sizeof(unsigned char) = 1` byte.\n\nTemporary variables used within expressions, like `lower1` and `lower2`, are typically optimized by the compiler to use CPU registers and may not occupy stack memory. Therefore, we only count the explicitly defined variables with scope across the loop.\n\nTotal memory `m` = (size of `str1`) + (size of `char2`) + (size of `i`)\nm = 101 bytes + 1 byte + 1 byte = 103 bytes.\n\n<<<103>>>"
