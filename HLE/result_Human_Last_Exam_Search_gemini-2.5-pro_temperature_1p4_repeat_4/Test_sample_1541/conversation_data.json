    "To solve this problem with maximum memory efficiency, we should avoid storing the entire input string in a large buffer if possible. The most memory-efficient method is to process the input stream character by character, count the occurrences of the numbers, and then print the result based on these counts. This approach avoids allocating over 1000 bytes for an input buffer.\n\nThe strategy is as follows:\n1.  Read the input one character at a time using a function like `getchar()`.\n2.  Count the occurrences of the digits '1', '2', '3', and '4'.\n3.  After counting, print the numbers in non-decreasing order. To correctly format the output with \"+\" signs, a flag can be used to ensure a plus is not printed before the very first number.\n\nHere is the C program that implements this memory-efficient logic:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/**\n * This program solves the \"Xenia and the Sum\" problem with a focus on\n * memory efficiency.\n *\n * The most memory-efficient approach is to process the input character by\n * character instead of storing the entire string in a large buffer. This\n * avoids the need for a char array of ~1001 bytes.\n *\n * 1. Counting Occurrences: We read the input using getchar() in a loop.\n *    We only need to count the occurrences of the digits '1', '2', '3', and '4'.\n *    A small array, `count`, of type `short int` is used for this, as the\n *    number of summands (max 501) fits comfortably within a short's range.\n *\n * 2. Printing the Sorted Sum: After counting, we loop from 1 to 4. For each\n *    number, we print it as many times as it was counted. A `char` flag,\n *    `is_first`, is used to correctly handle the '+' separators, ensuring a\n *    '+' is printed before every number except the first one.\n *\n * This method uses only a few small variables, resulting in minimal memory usage.\n */\nint main() {\n    // --- Variable Memory Calculation ---\n\n    // count: Stores frequencies of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4. Max summands is 501,\n    // which fits in a short int.\n    // 4 * sizeof(short int) = 4 * 2 = 8 bytes.\n    short int count[4] = {0};\n\n    // i, j: Loop counters. Max values are small and fit in short int.\n    // 2 * sizeof(short int) = 2 * 2 = 4 bytes.\n    short int i, j;\n\n    // c: getchar() returns an int to accommodate the special EOF value.\n    // 1 * sizeof(int) = 4 bytes.\n    int c;\n\n    // is_first: A flag for printing '+'. A char is the smallest type (1 byte).\n    // 1 * sizeof(char) = 1 byte.\n    char is_first = 1;\n\n    // --- Total Memory (m) = 8 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 17 bytes ---\n\n\n    // 1. Read input character by character and count the numbers.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        if (c >= '1' && c <= '4') {\n            // '1' maps to index 0, '2' to 1, etc.\n            count[c - '1']++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // 2. Print the numbers in sorted order based on counts.\n    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        for (j = 0; j < count[i]; j++) {\n            if (is_first) {\n                is_first = 0; // The first number is now being printed.\n            } else {\n                printf(\"+\");  // Print '+' before any subsequent number.\n            }\n            printf(\"%d\", i + 1);\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation\n\nThe total memory `m` used for the variables in this program is calculated by summing the sizes of each variable declared in `main`. On a typical competitive programming platform (like a 64-bit system using GCC), the data type sizes are as follows: `char` is 1 byte, `short int` is 2 bytes, and `int` is 4 bytes.\n\n*   `short int count[4]`: An array to count the four numbers (1, 2, 3, 4). Size = 4 * `sizeof(short int)` = 4 * 2 = 8 bytes.\n*   `short int i, j`: Two loop counters. Size = 2 * `sizeof(short int)` = 2 * 2 = 4 bytes.\n*   `int c`: Variable to hold the return value of `getchar()`, which is an `int`. Size = 1 * `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n*   `char is_first`: A flag variable to manage printing separators. Size = 1 * `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of these amounts:\nm = 8 (for `count`) + 4 (for `i`, `j`) + 4 (for `c`) + 1 (for `is_first`) = 17 bytes.\n\n<<<17>>>"
