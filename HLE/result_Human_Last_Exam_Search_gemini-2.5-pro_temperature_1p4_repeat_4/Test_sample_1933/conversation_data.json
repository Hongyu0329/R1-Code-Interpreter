    "### The VC Dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ with 4 Unary Predicates is 4\n\nThe Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of the specified first-order logic fragment is determined by the number of unary predicates in the schema $S$. With $S$ containing 4 unary predicates, the VC dimension is 4.\n\nThis conclusion is reached through the following analysis:\n\n#### 1. Defining the Concept Class\nThe VC dimension measures the complexity of a \"concept class.\" In this context, the concepts are sets of elements from a universe that can be defined by formulas in the language $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ with one free variable, say `x`. Let the four unary predicates in the schema $S$ be $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x),$ and $P_4(x)$.\n\n#### 2. Analyzing the Logical Fragment\nThe allowed logical connectives are existential quantification ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the constants for true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$). A key step is to analyze the structure of any formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable `x` that can be constructed in this language.\n\nAny such formula $\\phi(x)$ can be shown to be logically equivalent to a formula of the form:\n$\\phi_{qf}(x) \\land S_{sent}$\n\nHere, $\\phi_{qf}(x)$ is a quantifier-free formula consisting only of a conjunction of the base predicates. For example, $\\phi_{qf}(x)$ could be $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$. $S_{sent}$ is a sentence, meaning it is a formula with no free variables. An example of $S_{sent}$ is $\\exists y. (P_2(y) \\land P_4(y))$.\n\nFor any fixed model (a universe with specific interpretations for the predicates), the sentence $S_{sent}$ will be either true or false.\n*   If $S_{sent}$ evaluates to true, the formula $\\phi(x)$ defines the same set of elements as $\\phi_{qf}(x)$.\n*   If $S_{sent}$ evaluates to false, the entire formula $\\phi(x)$ becomes false and defines the empty set.\n\nThis means that the set of all possible concepts that can be defined by the full language is composed of the sets definable by simple conjunctions of the predicates, plus the empty set.\n\n#### 3. The VC Dimension of Intersections\nThe concepts defined by the quantifier-free formulas like $\\phi_{qf}(x)$ are precisely the intersections of the sets defined by the base predicates. For example, the formula $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$ defines the intersection of the set of elements satisfying $P_1$ and the set of elements satisfying $P_3$.\n\nThe concept class is therefore the collection of all possible intersections of the four base predicate sets. A well-established result in computational learning theory states that the VC dimension of a concept class formed by all intersections of $k$ base sets is exactly $k$. For this problem, $k=4$.\n\n#### 4. Proof of VC Dimension\nTo formally establish the VC dimension as 4, we must show two things:\n1.  **There exists a set of 4 elements that can be shattered.** We can construct a model to demonstrate this. Let the universe be $U = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$. We can define the interpretation of the predicates such that they can isolate any subset of $U$. For example, setting the extension of $P_i$ to be $U \\setminus \\{x_i\\}$ for $i=1, \\dots, 4$ allows us to form any subset of $U$ by taking appropriate intersections. This proves the VC dimension is at least 4.\n2.  **No set of 5 elements can be shattered.** The total number of distinct concepts that can be formed by intersecting four base sets is at most $2^4 = 16$. To shatter a set of 5 elements, one must be able to generate all $2^5 = 32$ of its subsets. Since we only have at most 16 distinct concepts (plus the empty set, making 17 at most), it is impossible to generate 32 distinct subsets. Therefore, no set of size 5 can be shattered, and the VC dimension is at most 4.\n\nCombining these two points, the VC dimension of the concept class is exactly 4. The presence of existential quantifiers, as analyzed, does not increase the expressive power in a way that would raise the VC dimension.\n\n<<<4>>>"
