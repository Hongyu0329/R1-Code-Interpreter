    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Factorize the conductor $d$\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\nWe can test for divisibility by small prime numbers.\n*   $53599$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   $53599 \\div 7 = 7657$.\n*   $7657 \\div 13 = 589$.\n*   $589 \\div 19 = 31$.\nSo, the prime factorization of $d$ is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThe conductor is a product of four distinct odd primes.\n\n### 2. Properties of Primitive Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$, where each $\\chi_p$ is a primitive character modulo the prime $p$. A character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if and only if it is non-trivial (i.e., not the character that is always 1).\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31}))$.\n\nWe require the order of $\\chi$ to be 6. This imposes constraints on the orders of the component characters $\\chi_p$. Specifically, for each prime $p$ dividing $d$:\n*   The order of $\\chi_p$ must be a divisor of 6.\n*   Since each $\\chi_p$ must be non-trivial, its order must be greater than 1.\nTherefore, the order of each component character $\\chi_p$ must belong to the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n### 3. Counting Characters of Specific Orders\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo a prime $p$ is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ in this group is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n\nLet's check the condition for our primes:\n*   For $p=7$, $p-1 = 6$. Orders 2, 3, and 6 are all possible.\n*   For $p=13$, $p-1 = 12$. Orders 2, 3, and 6 are all possible.\n*   For $p=19$, $p-1 = 18$. Orders 2, 3, and 6 are all possible.\n*   For $p=31$, $p-1 = 30$. Orders 2, 3, and 6 are all possible.\n\nFor each prime $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, we can calculate the number of available primitive characters with orders dividing 6:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\nFor each prime factor $p$ of $d$, the total number of non-trivial characters whose order divides 6 is $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### 4. Combining the Component Characters\nWe need to find the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that each $\\chi_p$ is non-trivial with order dividing 6, and their combined order is exactly 6.\n\nLet's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\n1.  **Total characters with order dividing 6**: For each of the four primes, there are 5 possible choices for the character $\\chi_p$. This gives a total of $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$ characters whose order is a divisor of 6. These are all primitive with conductor $d=53599$ because each component character is non-trivial.\n\n2.  **Characters with order dividing 2**: For the order of $\\chi$ to divide 2, the order of each component $\\chi_p$ must divide 2. Since the components must be non-trivial, their order must be exactly 2. For each prime, there is $\\phi(2) = 1$ such character. Thus, there is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$ character whose order is 2.\n\n3.  **Characters with order dividing 3**: For the order of $\\chi$ to divide 3, the order of each component $\\chi_p$ must divide 3. Since the components must be non-trivial, their order must be exactly 3. For each prime, there are $\\phi(3) = 2$ such characters. Thus, there are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$ characters whose order is 3.\n\nA character whose order divides 6 can have an order of 1, 2, 3, or 6. Since all components are non-trivial, the order of the combined character cannot be 1. The set of primitive characters with conductor $d$ and order dividing 6 is the disjoint union of those with order 2, order 3, and order 6.\n\nNumber of characters of order 6 = (Total characters with order dividing 6) - (Number of characters of order 2) - (Number of characters of order 3)\nNumber of characters = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
