    "The three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic poem, the Aeneid, are the Araxes, the Tiber, and the Acheloüs. The poem includes a mix of real-world rivers and mythological streams of the underworld. When considering the geographical rivers with measurable lengths, these three stand out for their significant size.\n\nThe longest of these is the **Araxes River**, which flows through modern-day Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran. The Araxes is mentioned in the Aeneid, and its total length is 1,072 kilometers (666 miles).\n\nThe second-longest river featured in the epic is the **Tiber**. This river is central to the narrative as it flows through Rome, the destined home of Aeneas and his Trojan followers. The Tiber is the third-longest river in Italy, with a length of 406 kilometers (252 miles).\n\nThe third is the **Acheloüs River**, the longest river in Greece. Virgil mentions this river, and its length is 220 kilometers (137 miles).\n\nBeyond these three, the Aeneid references several other real rivers. The **Alpheus River**, also in Greece, is noted in the epic and has a length of about 110-112 kilometers. Other smaller rivers in Sicily are also named, such as the **Gela** (59-74 km), the **Helorus** (modern Tellaro, 49 km), and the **Crimisus** (23 km). The **Simois**, **Numicus**, and **Pantagias** are also mentioned but are described as small rivers without specific lengths provided in the sources.\n\nThe mythological rivers of the underworld—Styx, Acheron, Phlegethon, Cocytus, and Lethe—play a significant role in Aeneas's journey through the afterlife in Book VI but, as mythical entities, do not have physical lengths to be measured.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Araxes, the Tiber, and the Acheloüs.>>>"
