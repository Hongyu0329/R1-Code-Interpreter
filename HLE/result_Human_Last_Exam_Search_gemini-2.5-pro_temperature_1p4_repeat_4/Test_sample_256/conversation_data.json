    "The symmetry group of the best-known packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C_1.\n\nThis information is based on the comprehensive database of circle packings provided by Eckard Specht. For the packing of 1135 circles, the designated symmetry group in Schoenflies notation is C_1. A C_1 symmetry group implies that the arrangement has no rotational or reflectional symmetry; it is asymmetric.\n\n<<<C_1>>>"
