    "To solve the equation, we first need to convert the Roman numerals to modern numbers.\n\n*   **CIV** = 100 + (5 - 1) = 104\n*   **CXI** = 100 + 10 + 1 = 111\n*   **CXIX** = 100 + 10 + (10 - 1) = 119\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the equation:\n\n104 / 111 - 119\n\nNext, perform the calculation:\n\n104 ÷ 111 ≈ 0.9369369...\n\n0.9369369... - 119 = -118.063063...\n\nRounding to four decimal places, the answer is -118.0631.\n\n<<<-118.063063063>>>"
