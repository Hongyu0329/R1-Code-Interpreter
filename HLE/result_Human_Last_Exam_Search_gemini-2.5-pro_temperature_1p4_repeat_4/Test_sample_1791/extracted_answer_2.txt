The effective electron-electron interaction, mediated by phonons for a given momentum transfer **q**, is given by the following term in the effective Hamiltonian:

$H_{eff}(\mathbf{q}) = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{j, \omega_n} \frac{g^2 q_j^2}{m(w_q^2 + \omega_n^2)} \rho_{\mathbf{q}}(i\omega_n) \rho_{-\mathbf{q}}(-i\omega_n)$

Here, the sum is over the phonon polarization index *j* and the bosonic Matsubara frequencies $\omega_n = 2n\pi k_B T$. $\rho_{\mathbf{q}}(i\omega_n)$ is the Fourier component of the electron density operator. This represents an attractive interaction between electrons, where the strength depends on the momentum transfer **q**, the energy transfer $i\omega_n$, and the phonon frequency $w_q$.
