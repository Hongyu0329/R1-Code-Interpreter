    "Yes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$. The upper bound is $2^{\\aleph_0}$, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nHere is a step-by-step argument to establish this bound:\n\n1.  **The dense open subset $U$ is separable.**\n    The set $U$ is a metric space, and each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$. Any open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ is a separable space (for instance, the rational numbers within the interval form a countable dense subset). A metric space that is locally separable is also separable. To see this, consider an open cover of $U$ by separable neighborhoods. Since a metric space is paracompact, and for metric spaces being separable is equivalent to being Lindelöf, $U$ is a Lindelöf space. Therefore, the open cover has a countable subcover, $\\{N_i\\}_{i=1}^{\\infty}$. Since $U$ is the union of a countable collection of separable spaces, it is itself separable. Let $D_i$ be a countable dense subset of $N_i$. Then $\\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} D_i$ is a countable dense subset of $U$.\n\n2.  **The space $X$ is separable.**\n    Let $D_U$ be a countable dense subset of $U$. We are given that $U$ is a dense open subset of $X$. Since $D_U$ is dense in $U$ and $U$ is dense in $X$, it follows that $D_U$ is dense in $X$.\n    To prove this, let $x$ be any point in $X$ and let $O_x$ be any open neighborhood of $x$. Since $U$ is dense in $X$, the intersection $O_x \\cap U$ is a non-empty open set in $U$. Because $D_U$ is dense in $U$, the intersection $(O_x \\cap U) \\cap D_U$ must be non-empty. This implies that $O_x \\cap D_U$ is non-empty. Therefore, $D_U$ is a countable dense subset of $X$, which means $X$ is a separable space.\n\n3.  **Separable metric spaces have a bounded cardinality.**\n    A separable metric space is second-countable. That is, it has a countable basis for its topology. Let $\\mathcal{B}$ be a countable basis for the topology on $X$. For any point $x \\in X$, we can associate a subset of the basis, $\\mathcal{B}_x = \\{B \\in \\mathcal{B} \\mid x \\in B\\}$. Since $X$ is a metric space, it is Hausdorff. For any two distinct points $x, y \\in X$, there exist disjoint open sets $O_x$ and $O_y$ containing $x$ and $y$, respectively. By the definition of a basis, there must be a basis element $B_x \\in \\mathcal{B}$ such that $x \\in B_x \\subseteq O_x$. This means $y \\notin B_x$, so the set $\\mathcal{B}_x$ is different from $\\mathcal{B}_y$. Therefore, the mapping $x \\mapsto \\mathcal{B}_x$ is an injection from $X$ to the power set of $\\mathcal{B}$, denoted $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{B})$.\n    The cardinality of the power set of a countable set is $|\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{B})| = 2^{|\\mathcal{B}|} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. Since there is an injection from $X$ into $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{B})$, the cardinality of $X$ is at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on the upper bound.**\n    The argument above shows that $|X| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0}$. Thus, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$.\n\nFurthermore, since $X$ is a connected metric space and contains an open subset homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$, $X$ cannot be a single point. A connected metric space with more than one point must be uncountable and, in fact, has cardinality of at least $2^{\\aleph_0}$. Combining this with the upper bound we found, the cardinality of $X$ must be exactly $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n<<<An upper bound on the cardinality of $X$ is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.>>>"
