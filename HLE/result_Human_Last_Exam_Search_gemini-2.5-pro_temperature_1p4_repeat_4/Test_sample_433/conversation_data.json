    "The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose container ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment is a critical aspect of safe medication practices, governed by standards from organizations like the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities (NAPRA).\n\nFor a single-dose **ampule**, which is a sealed glass container that is broken open, storage is **not permitted** after it has been opened. It must be used immediately for a single patient and any unused portion must be discarded. The rationale is that an open ampule cannot be resealed, leaving the contents exposed to potential microbial contamination.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between single-dose ampules and single-dose vials, as their BUDs differ significantly. A single-dose vial is a container with a rubber stopper that is punctured by a needle.\n\nFor a **single-dose vial**:\n\n*   When entered or punctured only in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner air quality environment, it may be used for up to **12 hours** after the initial entry or puncture, provided the labeled storage requirements are maintained during that period. Some older guidelines specified a 6-hour BUD.\n*   If a single-dose vial is punctured or opened in an environment with an air quality worse than ISO Class 5, the BUD is **1 hour**.\n\nIn summary, once an ampule is opened, it must be used immediately and cannot be stored. In contrast, a single-dose vial punctured in a sterile environment can be used for up to 12 hours under the latest USP <797> guidelines.\n\n<<<For a single-dose ampule, there is no storage permitted after opening; it must be used immediately and any remaining contents discarded.>>>"
