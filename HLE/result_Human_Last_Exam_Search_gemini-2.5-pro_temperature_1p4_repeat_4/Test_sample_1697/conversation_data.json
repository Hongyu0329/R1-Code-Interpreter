    "The reaction described is a classic example of directed ortho-metalation (DoM), followed by quenching with an electrophile.\n\n**Step 1: Directed ortho-Metalation**\n\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This molecule has two functional groups attached to a benzene ring that can direct the lithiation: the N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂) and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂). Both are known as Directed Metalation Groups (DMGs) because they can coordinate to the lithium atom of the organolithium reagent (sec-BuLi), directing the deprotonation to an adjacent (ortho) position.\n\nThe two DMGs are located meta to each other on the benzene ring. In such cases, the two groups work together in a synergistic fashion, promoting lithiation at the position that is ortho to both groups (the C-2 position). This cooperative effect is highly efficient for regioselective deprotonation. The combination of sec-Butyllithium (a strong base) and TMEDA (a chelating agent that enhances the reactivity of the organolithium) is a standard reagent system for this type of reaction.\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n*   The lithium atom of sec-BuLi coordinates to the Lewis basic oxygen of the amide group and the nitrogen of the dimethylamino group.\n*   The highly basic sec-butyl anion then removes a proton from the C-2 position, which is the most acidic and sterically accessible site due to this chelation.\n*   This forms a stable 2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Quench**\n\nThe aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step is a powerful nucleophile. It readily reacts with an electrophile, in this case, methyl iodide (CH₃I). The nucleophilic carbon at the C-2 position attacks the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide, displacing the iodide ion. This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond at the C-2 position.\n\nTherefore, the final compound obtained is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
