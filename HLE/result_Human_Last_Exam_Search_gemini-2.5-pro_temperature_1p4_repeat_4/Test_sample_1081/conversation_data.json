    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is determined by the classification of these tori up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy.\n\nFor a connected reductive group $G$ defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the set of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational conjugacy classes of maximal tori is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group $W$. This correspondence holds true when the group $G$ is split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, which is a standard assumption unless specified otherwise. The Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the root system of a split group, and in this case, the so-called $\\sigma$-conjugacy classes simply become the ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group.\n\nThe reductive group in question is of type $E_8$. Its corresponding Weyl group is denoted by $W(E_8)$. Therefore, the problem is reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. The Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a large but well-studied finite group.\n\nThe number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$ has been computed and is known to be 112. This result was established by R. Carter in 1972.\n\nTherefore, for a split reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
