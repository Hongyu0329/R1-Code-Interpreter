    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 is a triethynyl-substituted triangulene. The central core of the molecule is triangulene, which is known for its threefold symmetric planar structure.\n\nThe symmetry of the molecule is determined by the arrangement of its atoms. The unsubstituted triangulene molecule, being a planar structure with threefold symmetry, belongs to the D3h point group. This high symmetry is often preserved in its derivatives, especially when the substituents are arranged symmetrically. For instance, a tris(dicyanomethylene) substituted triangulene has been described as having threefold symmetry.\n\nIn the given molecule, three ethynyl (-C≡CH) groups are attached to the triangulene core. The SMILES notation suggests a symmetrical placement of these linear groups. Assuming the molecule maintains its planarity with the ethynyl groups lying in the same plane and pointing outwards from the center in a symmetrical fashion, all the symmetry elements of the D3h group would be conserved. These elements include a principal three-fold rotation axis (C₃), three two-fold rotation axes (C₂) perpendicular to the main axis, a horizontal mirror plane (σh), three vertical mirror planes (σᵥ), and a three-fold improper rotation axis (S₃). There is no indication from the available data that the ethynyl substitution would cause a distortion from this high-symmetry planar arrangement.\n\nTherefore, based on the inherent symmetry of the triangulene core and the symmetrical substitution pattern of the ethynyl groups, the symmetry group of the molecule is D3h.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
