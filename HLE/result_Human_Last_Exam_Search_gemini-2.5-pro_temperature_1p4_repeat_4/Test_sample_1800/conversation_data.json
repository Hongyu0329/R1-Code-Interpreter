    "Determining the ideal Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles to maximize catalytic performance is a complex task as the optimal ratio is highly dependent on the specific application, namely the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction or water splitting. Research indicates that there is no single ratio that is optimal for both processes.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, and more specifically the reverse WGS (rWGS) reaction, studies on Ni/La-doped Ceria catalysts have identified an optimal nickel proportion of around **7% molar**. A catalyst with the specific composition of Ni₀.₀₇/(Ce₀.₉La₀.₁)₀.₉₃ demonstrated high CO production and excellent stability. While increasing the nickel loading to 10% molar showed similar performance to the 7% loading, a lower loading of 1% molar was found to be less effective. This suggests a \"volcano-type\" relationship between Ni concentration and catalytic activity, where performance peaks at a specific loading.\n\nIt is important to note that the support material can influence the ideal ratio. For instance, in a different system using a Ni/CeO₂-TiO₂ catalyst, a higher dispersion of Ni on the support surface was key to improved catalytic activity.\n\n### Water Splitting (WS)\n\nThe ideal Ni/Ce ratio for water splitting is more nuanced as it depends on which half-reaction is being targeted: the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) or the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER).\n\n**Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER):**\nFor the OER, research on Ni<sub>y</sub>Ce₁₀₀−yOₓ electrocatalysts suggests that nickel-rich compositions are more effective. Specifically, catalysts with **Ni to Ce ratios of 3:1 (Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ) and 1:1 (Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ)** exhibited the highest OER activities. This enhanced performance is attributed to a greater concentration of oxygen vacancies in these materials.\n\n**Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER):**\nIn contrast to the OER, a cerium-rich composition appears to be more favorable for the HER. A study on Ni₃N-CeO₂ catalysts found that the optimal performance was achieved with a **Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2:1**.\n\n**Overall Water Splitting:**\nIn systems where Ni-Ceria is used for overall water splitting, often in combination with other elements, the ratios vary. For example, in a study using Ni and Fe co-doped ceria, a high level of 20 mol% total dopants with a 1:1 ratio of Ni to Fe was shown to be effective for both HER and OER. Another study highlights that atomically dispersing just 2.5 atomic % Ni in a CeO₂ aerogel can be highly effective for the WGS reaction while completely suppressing the undesirable side reaction of methanation.\n\nIn summary, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not a single value but rather a range that is highly dependent on the target reaction and the overall composition of the catalyst. For the WGS reaction, a nickel content of around 7% molar in doped ceria has shown excellent results. For water splitting, a higher nickel content (50-75% molar) is beneficial for the OER, while a lower nickel content (around 33% molar) is better for the HER.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is approximately 7% molar for the Water Gas Shift reaction and varies for water splitting, with higher Ni content (50-75% molar) favoring the Oxygen Evolution Reaction and lower Ni content (around 33% molar) being optimal for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction.>>>"
