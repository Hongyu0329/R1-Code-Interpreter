    "To determine the probability that a particle in a one-dimensional box is located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for the n=2 state, we follow the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\nThe state of the particle is described by its wave function. For a particle in a 1D box of length 'a', the normalized wave function for the n-th energy level is:\n\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\nFor the n=2 state, the wave function is:\n\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in a specific region is determined by the probability density, which is the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |ψ(x)|². The probability density for the n=2 state is:\n\nP(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\nAn important feature of the n=2 state is the presence of a node at the center of the box (x = a/2). A node is a point where the wave function, and therefore the probability density, is zero. This means there is zero probability of finding the particle exactly at the midpoint of the box. The interval of interest, from 0.495a to 0.505a, is centered on this node.\n\nTo find the probability of the particle being in this interval, we must integrate the probability density function over the specified range:\n\nP(0.495a ≤ x ≤ 0.505a) = ∫(from 0.495a to 0.505a) (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nBecause the interval is very small and centered around a point of zero probability, we expect the resulting probability to be very small. A detailed calculation shows that the probability is approximately:\n\nP ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶\n\nThis result confirms that while the probability is not exactly zero (since the interval has a finite, albeit small, width), it is extremely low.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
