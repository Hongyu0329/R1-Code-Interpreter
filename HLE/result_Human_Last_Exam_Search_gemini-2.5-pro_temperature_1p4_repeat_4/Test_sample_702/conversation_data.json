    "Answering the query about the connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ requires a step-by-step analysis of the spaces involved and the map itself, using fundamental concepts from algebraic topology such as loop spaces, smash products, and connectivity.\n\n### Analysis of the Spaces\n\nFirst, let's determine the connectivity of the domain and codomain spaces. A space is said to be *n-connected* if all its homotopy groups up to and including dimension *n* are trivial.\n\n*   **Domain Space: $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$**\n    *   The 4-sphere, $S^4$, is 3-connected, meaning $\\pi_i(S^4) = 0$ for $i \\le 3$.\n    *   The 6-sphere, $S^6$, is 5-connected, meaning $\\pi_i(S^6) = 0$ for $i \\le 5$.\n    *   The loop space functor, $\\Omega$, shifts homotopy groups up by one degree: $\\pi_i(\\Omega X) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(X)$.\n        *   Therefore, $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected.\n        *   Similarly, $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected.\n    *   The connectivity of a smash product of two spaces, say a $p$-connected space $A$ and a $q$-connected space $B$, is $(p+q+1)$.\n        *   Thus, the smash product $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected.\n    *   The suspension functor, $\\Sigma$, increases the connectivity of a space by one.\n        *   Consequently, the domain $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\n\n*   **Codomain Space: $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$**\n    *   The smash product of spheres $S^m \\wedge S^n$ is homeomorphic to $S^{m+n}$.\n        *   Hence, $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\simeq S^{10}$.\n    *   The codomain is therefore homotopy equivalent to $\\Omega S^{10}$.\n    *   Since $S^{10}$ is 9-connected, its loop space, $\\Omega S^{10}$, is 8-connected.\n\n### Analysis of the Map and its Connectivity\n\nBoth the domain and the codomain are 8-connected spaces. To determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we must examine its effect on the first non-trivial homotopy groups.\n\n1.  **Lowest Non-trivial Homotopy Groups:**\n    *   For both spaces, the first non-trivial homotopy group occurs at dimension 9.\n    *   Using the Hurewicz theorem and the Freudenthal suspension theorem, we can determine these groups.\n    *   $\\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong H_4(S^4) \\otimes H_6(S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n2.  **The Nature of the Map:**\n    This map is an instance of the generalized Whitehead product (or Samelson product) construction. The map on the level of the 9th homotopy groups, $\\pi_9(f): \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$, can be shown to be an isomorphism, mapping a generator to a generator.\n\n3.  **Connectivity via Homotopy Fiber:**\n    A map is defined as *n*-connected if its homotopy fiber is (*n*-1)-connected. Let $F$ be the homotopy fiber of the map $f$. The long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the fibration $F \\to \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ includes the segment:\n    ... $\\to \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\xrightarrow{\\pi_9(f)} \\pi_9(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)) \\to \\pi_8(F) \\to$ ...\n    Since $\\pi_9(f)$ is an isomorphism, the five-lemma implies that the map before and after $\\pi_8(F)$ are zero, which forces $\\pi_8(F) = 0$. As both the domain and codomain are 8-connected, $F$ must be at least 7-connected. The vanishing of $\\pi_8(F)$ shows it is 8-connected.\n\n    Looking at the next term in the sequence:\n    ... $\\to \\pi_{10}(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)) \\to \\pi_9(F) \\to \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\xrightarrow{\\pi_9(f)} \\pi_9(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)) \\to$ ...\n    Because $\\pi_9(f)$ is an isomorphism, exactness implies that the map from $\\pi_9(F)$ is the zero map, and the map into $\\pi_9(F)$ is also the zero map. Thus, $\\pi_9(F) = 0$.\n\n    This shows that the homotopy fiber $F$ is 9-connected. By definition, if the fiber of a map is (*n*-1)-connected, the map itself is *n*-connected. Since $F$ is 9-connected, the map $f$ is 10-connected.\n\nThe phrase \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" likely refers to a specific construction of this map, which, in the standard context, is identified with the generalized Whitehead or Samelson product. This information does not alter the analysis of the map's connectivity based on its domain and codomain.\n\n<<<10>>>"
