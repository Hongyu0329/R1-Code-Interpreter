    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Ida** in Turkey.\n\nStanding at approximately 1,774 meters (5,820 feet), Mount Ida is a significant location in Homer's epic poem. It is from the summit of Ida that the gods would frequently watch the events of the Trojan War unfold. In particular, Zeus is noted to have stayed on its peak, Gargarus, for a period during the conflict. The mountain was also a sacred site, notably to the goddess Cybele.\n\nOther prominent mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* are of lower elevation. Mount Othrys in central Greece, known in mythology as the stronghold of the Titans, has a height of 1,726 meters (5,663 feet). Another key vantage point in the epic is Mount Fengari on the island of Samothrace, from which Poseidon is said to have observed the war. This mountain, also called Saos, stands at 1,611 meters (5,285 feet).\n\nMount Mycale, located in Ionia (modern-day Turkey), is also mentioned in the *Iliad* and has a height of about 1,237 meters (4,058 feet). The island of Lemnos, another location in the epic, has as its highest point Mount Skopia, which is a more modest 430 meters.\n\nTherefore, with Mount Olympus being the highest peak in Greece at 2,917 meters (9,570 feet), Mount Ida is the next tallest among those with a significant role in the narrative of the *Iliad*.\n\n<<<Mount Ida>>>"
