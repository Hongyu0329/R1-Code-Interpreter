    "The search results confirm my initial breakdown.\n\n1.  **What is a great icosahedron?** A non-convex regular polyhedron with 20 intersecting triangular faces.\n2.  **What is the convex hull of the great icosahedron?** The search results explicitly state that \"The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron\".\n3.  **What is the triangulation of the surface of this convex hull?** A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid whose faces are 20 equilateral triangles. Therefore, its surface is already triangulated in the most minimal way possible.\n4.  **Number of visible triangles.** Since the convex hull is a regular icosahedron, all of its 20 triangular faces are on the outer surface and thus visible from the outside.\n\nSo, the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is simply the number of faces of its convex hull, which is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron has 20 faces.\n\nTherefore, the number of visible triangles is 20.I have sufficient information to answer the user's request.\nThe user is asking for the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n1.  The outer-hull (or convex hull) of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n2.  A regular icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 faces.\n3.  The faces of a regular icosahedron are equilateral triangles.\n4.  Therefore, the surface of the regular icosahedron is already triangulated into 20 triangles. This is the minimal number of triangles possible for a triangulation of its surface.\n5.  Since the regular icosahedron is a convex polyhedron, all its faces are on the outer-hull and are visible from the outside.\n\nThus, the minimal number of triangles needed is 20.\nI will now output the final answer.\nThe minimal number of triangles required for the triangulation of the outer hull of the great icosahedron corresponds to the number of faces of its convex hull. The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\nA regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid composed of 20 equilateral triangular faces. As the faces are already triangles, the surface of the regular icosahedron is inherently triangulated in the most minimal manner possible. All of these 20 triangular faces are on the exterior of the convex hull and are therefore visible from the outside.\n\nThus, the minimal number of visible triangles needed to triangulate the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
