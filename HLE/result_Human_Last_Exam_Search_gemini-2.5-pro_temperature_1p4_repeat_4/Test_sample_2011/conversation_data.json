    "To determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on 128 vertices, we first need to understand the relationship between cliques and induced subgraphs.\n\nA **clique** in a graph is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. An **induced subgraph** on a set of vertices `S` is the graph formed by `S` and all the edges that connect pairs of vertices in `S` within the original graph.\n\nIf a graph `G` contains a clique of size `k`, let the set of vertices in this clique be `S`. The subgraph induced by `S` is, by definition, a complete graph on `k` vertices, denoted as `K_k`. Conversely, if a graph has an induced subgraph that is a `K_k`, the corresponding set of vertices forms a `k`-clique. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum number of different sizes of cliques that can exist in a graph with 128 vertices.\n\nLet's denote the set of all possible clique sizes in a graph `G` as `C(G)`. The largest possible clique size in `G` is called the clique number, denoted as `ω(G)`.\n\nIf a graph `G` has a clique of size `ω(G)`, let this clique be formed by the vertex set `S_max`. Any subset of `S_max` is also a clique. Thus, for any integer `k` from 1 to `ω(G)`, we can select a subset of `S_max` of size `k`, which will form a `k`-clique. This means that if a graph has a clique of size `ω(G)`, it necessarily has cliques of all integer sizes from 1 to `ω(G)`.\n\nFurthermore, by the definition of `ω(G)` as the maximum clique size, there can be no clique of a size larger than `ω(G)`. Consequently, the set of all possible clique sizes in any graph `G` is precisely `{1, 2, ..., ω(G)}`. The number of different clique sizes is therefore equal to `ω(G)`.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the maximum possible value of `ω(G)` for a graph `G` with `n = 128` vertices. The clique number of a graph cannot exceed its number of vertices, so `ω(G) ≤ 128`.\n\nThis upper bound can be achieved. Consider the complete graph on 128 vertices, `K_128`. In this graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. The entire set of 128 vertices forms a clique. Thus, the clique number of `K_128` is 128. For this graph, the set of induced clique sizes is `{1, 2, ..., 128}`, and the number of distinct sizes is 128.\n\nSince no graph on 128 vertices can have a clique number greater than 128, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
