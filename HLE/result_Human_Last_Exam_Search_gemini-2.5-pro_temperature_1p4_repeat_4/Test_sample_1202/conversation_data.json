    "After a gene duplication event, the new duplicate gene is often redundant. The most common fate for such a gene is **pseudogenization** (B), where it accumulates mutations and becomes non-functional, as there is no selective pressure to maintain it. Therefore, pseudogenization is a mechanism of gene loss, not retention.\n\n**Gene conversion** (A) is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange that makes two homologous DNA sequences identical. This process tends to homogenize duplicated genes, working against their divergence, although it can also help spread advantageous mutations within a gene family. It is a mechanism of interaction between duplicates rather than the primary force driving their long-term retention and functional divergence.\n\n**Adaptive radiation** (E) is a macroevolutionary process where a single ancestral species rapidly diversifies into many new species, each adapted to a different ecological niche. While the genetic novelty provided by gene duplication can fuel the evolutionary changes seen in adaptive radiation, adaptive radiation itself is not a molecular mechanism for retaining genes within a single genome.\n\nThis leaves **neofunctionalization** (C) and **subfunctionalization** (D) as the primary mechanisms responsible for the retention and subsequent divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization** is a process where one of the duplicated copies acquires a novel, beneficial function through mutation, while the other copy retains the original function. Natural selection then maintains both genes.\n*   **Subfunctionalization** describes a scenario where the ancestral gene had multiple functions (or expression domains), and the two duplicate copies each lose different functions through mutation. As a result, both genes are now required to perform the complete set of functions that the single ancestral gene originally had, ensuring the retention of both copies.\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are crucial for the evolution of new gene functions. However, there is considerable discussion about which is more common or more likely to occur initially. Subfunctionalization can occur through the accumulation of neutral, degenerative mutations, which are generally more frequent than the specific, advantageous gain-of-function mutations required for neofunctionalization. For this reason, subfunctionalization is often considered a more common and parsimonious route for the initial preservation of duplicate genes. This initial retention then provides the evolutionary time for one of the copies to potentially develop a new function, meaning subfunctionalization can be a transitional state to neofunctionalization.\n\nGiven that subfunctionalization relies on a more common type of mutation (neutral loss-of-function) to ensure the retention of both copies, it is considered a highly likely mechanism for preventing the immediate pseudogenization of a duplicate gene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
