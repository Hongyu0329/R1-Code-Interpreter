    "To determine the symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram with two vertices and four field contractions in perturbative Green's function analysis, we first need to clarify the structure of the diagram based on the provided information.\n\n### Interpretation of the Diagram's Structure\n\n1.  **Vertices**: The diagram contains two vertices. In a common quantum field theory like $\\phi^4$ theory, each vertex connects four field lines. Therefore, two vertices provide a total of eight field lines to be connected.\n2.  **Field Contractions**: In the context of Feynman diagrams, a \"field contraction\" corresponds to a propagator (an internal line of the diagram). A single propagator is formed by the contraction of a pair of field operators. Therefore, four field contractions imply the existence of four propagators.\n3.  **Topology**: With two vertices and four propagators, all eight available field lines from the vertices are used to form these internal lines. This means the diagram has no external lines and is a \"vacuum diagram\". The topology consists of two vertices connected to each other by four separate propagators.\n\n### Calculation of the Symmetry Factor\n\nThe symmetry factor, denoted by *S*, for a Feynman diagram is the number of permutations of its internal lines and vertices that leave the diagram unchanged. There is a general formula for calculating the symmetry factor:\n\n$S = g \\cdot 2^\\beta \\cdot \\prod_n (n!)^{\\alpha_n}$\n\nWhere:\n*   **g** is the number of permutations of vertices that leave the diagram topologically unchanged. In this case, the two vertices are identical and can be swapped, so **g = 2! = 2**.\n*   **β** is the number of lines that connect a vertex to itself. In this diagram, all lines connect one vertex to the other, so **β = 0**.\n*   **αn** is the number of sets of *n* identical lines connecting the same two vertices. Here, there is one set of four identical lines connecting the two vertices. Thus, **α₄ = 1**, and all other αn are zero.\n\nApplying these values to the formula:\n\n*   The term for permutations of vertices is g = 2.\n*   The term for lines connecting a vertex to itself is $2^0 = 1$.\n*   The term for identical lines between vertices is $(4!)^1 = 24$.\n\nTherefore, the total symmetry factor is the product of these individual factors:\n\nS = 2 × (4!) = 2 × 24 = 48.\n\nThis can also be understood by directly counting the symmetries: the four identical propagators can be permuted in 4! = 24 ways, and the two identical vertices can be swapped in 2! = 2 ways. Since these are independent symmetry operations, the total symmetry factor is the product, 24 × 2 = 48.\n\n<<<48>>>"
