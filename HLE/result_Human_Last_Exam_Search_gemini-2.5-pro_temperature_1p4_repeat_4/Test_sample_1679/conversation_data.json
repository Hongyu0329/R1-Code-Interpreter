    "An analysis of Academy Award for Best Picture winners reveals that **\"The Last Time I Saw Paris\" (1954)** is the first film to hold this prestigious title while also featuring a Luxor Obelisk on-screen. The movie, which won the Oscar for Best Picture at the 27th Academy Awards, includes scenes filmed on location in Paris, and a review of the film confirms that the Place de la Concorde is among the famous sites captured. The Luxor Obelisk is a prominent monument in this square.\n\nWhile other Best Picture winners have been set in the French capital, earlier films did not definitively feature the obelisk. Notably, \"An American in Paris\" (1951), though a celebrated musical set in the city, utilized a stylized backlot set for its Place de la Concorde sequence and did not show the actual monument. Another Paris-based winner, \"Gigi\" (1958), was released four years after \"The Last Time I Saw Paris.\"\n\nThe investigation also considered films potentially set in Luxor, Egypt, where the other obelisk is located. However, no Best Picture-winning film with confirmed scenes of the Luxor Temple obelisk predates \"The Last Time I Saw Paris.\" For instance, while \"The English Patient\" (1996) had scenes set in Egypt, they were primarily filmed in Tunisia, with locations in Italy and Venice substituting for Cairo. Therefore, based on filming locations and release dates, \"The Last Time I Saw Paris\" stands as the first Best Picture laureate to depict the historic Luxor Obelisk.\n\n<<<The Last Time I Saw Paris>>>"
