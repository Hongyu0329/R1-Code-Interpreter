    "There are exactly four finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called \"product-free\" if for any two elements *a* and *b* in *S* (including the case where *a* and *b* are the same element), their product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is \"maximal by inclusion\" (also referred to as \"locally maximal product-free\") if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set within the same group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 2 was accomplished by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart. The four groups are:\n\n*   **C₅**, the cyclic group of order 5.\n*   **C₆**, the cyclic group of order 6.\n*   **S₃**, the symmetric group on three elements (which is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 6, D₆).\n*   **Q₈**, the quaternion group of order 8.\n\nFor instance, in the cyclic group C₆ = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} under addition modulo 6, the set S = {2, 3} is a maximal by inclusion product-free set. In the quaternion group Q₈ = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k}, the set S = {i, j} is a maximal by inclusion product-free set.\n\n<<<4>>>"
