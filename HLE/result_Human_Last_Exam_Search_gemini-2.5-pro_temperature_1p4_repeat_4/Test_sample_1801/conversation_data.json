    "There is no credible evidence to suggest that two Nobel laureates were featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron with the tagline \"Ask Why.\"\n\nExtensive research and searches for the cast of the \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign, as well as any official ties between Nobel laureates and Enron's marketing, have failed to produce any information supporting this claim.\n\nWhile the work of certain Nobel laureates in economics, notably Myron Scholes and Robert Merton, was highly relevant to Enron's complex financial strategies, there is no indication that they appeared in the company's commercials. A single, unverified mention on a Reddit forum suggests that physicist and Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann may have appeared in an Enron commercial, but this has not been corroborated by any other sources. There is also a record of Nobel laureate Nelson Mandela receiving an award from Enron, though this is unrelated to the advertising campaign in question.\n\nGiven the lack of verifiable information, the assertion that two Nobel laureates were featured in the Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial remains unconfirmed.\n\n<<<I have not been able to identify two Nobel laureates who were featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why\".>>>"
