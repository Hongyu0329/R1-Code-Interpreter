    "The number of negative fundamental discriminants with a class number of 48 is 1374. This result is based on the complete determination of the class number problem for imaginary quadratic fields up to class number 100, a result largely attributed to the work of M. Watkins.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, in this context, seeks to provide a complete list of imaginary quadratic fields for each class number *n*. This is equivalent to finding all negative fundamental discriminants *d* for which the class number *h(d)* equals a given *n*. It has been proven that for any given class number, there exists only a finite number of such discriminants.\n\nThe On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) contains the sequence A046125, which lists the number of negative fundamental discriminants for each class number *n*. The 48th term of this sequence corresponds to the number of discriminants with class number 48. The value for the 48th term in this sequence is 1374.\n\nThe data in this OEIS sequence is supported by the comprehensive work of M. Watkins, who in his 2004 paper \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields,\" completed the classification for all class numbers up to 100.\n\n<<<1374>>>"
