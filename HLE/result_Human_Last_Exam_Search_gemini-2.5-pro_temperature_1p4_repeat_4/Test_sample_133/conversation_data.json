    "Based on a logical analysis of the provided Connect 4 board, there are two optimal moves for player 'O' to win as quickly as possible. A winning move is one that creates a situation where the opponent cannot block all threats, leading to a guaranteed win for 'O' on their next turn. This is often achieved by creating a \"fork\" or a line of three pieces with two open ends, which the opponent can only partially block.\n\nThe two optimal moves are:\n\n*   **c4**: Placing a disc here creates a horizontal line of three for 'O' at `c4, d4, e4`. This presents two winning spots on the next turn, `b4` and `f4`. Player 'X' can only block one of these, allowing 'O' to place their next disc in the unblocked spot and win.\n*   **f4**: This move creates a horizontal line of three for 'O' at `d4, e4, f4`. This creates two potential winning spots at `c4` and `g4`. Player 'X' can only block one, which allows 'O' to win on their next turn by playing in the other spot.\n\nBoth of these moves establish an unstoppable threat, ensuring 'O' wins on their subsequent move, making them the fastest routes to victory.\n\n<<<c4, f4>>>"
