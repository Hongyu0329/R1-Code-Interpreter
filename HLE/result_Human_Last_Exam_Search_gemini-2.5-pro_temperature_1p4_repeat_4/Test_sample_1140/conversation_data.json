    "Synthesizing a 100-amino acid peptide containing an unnatural amino acid like azido-phenylalanine presents a significant challenge that pushes the boundaries of standard synthetic methods. The most helpful technique would be either **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)** or **Recombinant Protein Expression with an Expanded Genetic Code**. The choice between them depends on the desired quantity of the peptide and the available laboratory resources.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the most viable techniques:\n\n### 1. Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)\nNCL is a powerful technique for constructing large peptides (over 50 amino acids) by joining smaller, more manageable peptide fragments. For a 100-amino acid target, this method is highly advantageous.\n\n*   **How it works:** The 100aa peptide would be broken down into two or more smaller fragments. One fragment, containing the unnatural amino acid azido-phenylalanine, would be synthesized using Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS). SPPS is ideal for incorporating unnatural amino acids into shorter peptides. The other fragment(s) can be made using either SPPS or recombinant methods. These unprotected fragments are then chemically and selectively joined together in solution to form the full-length peptide.\n*   **Advantages:** NCL bypasses the significant yield and purity problems that occur when trying to synthesize a 100aa peptide in one go using SPPS. It allows for the production of proteins of moderate size, around 150 amino acids or more. The key requirement is the presence of a cysteine residue at the ligation point, and the provided partial sequence \"M...[KAVCLXVIGATR[...]A\" conveniently contains a cysteine.\n\n### 2. Recombinant Protein Expression with Genetic Code Expansion\nThis biological approach allows for the direct incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins within a host organism, such as *E. coli*.\n\n*   **How it works:** This method requires engineering the cell's translational machinery. An orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair is introduced, which is specifically designed to recognize the unnatural amino acid (in this case, azido-phenylalanine) and assign it to a rare or unused codon, typically the amber stop codon (UAG). When the cell synthesizes the protein, it reads through the reassigned codon and inserts the azido-phenylalanine at the desired position.\n*   **Advantages:** This technique is excellent for producing long peptides and proteins with high fidelity. Systems for incorporating azido-phenylalanine are well-established and have been used to produce a variety of modified proteins. It is particularly suitable if large quantities of the peptide are required.\n\n### Why Not Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)?\nWhile SPPS is the workhorse for chemical peptide synthesis and is excellent for including unnatural amino acids, it has significant length limitations.\n\n*   **The Challenge:** Synthesizing a peptide of 100 amino acids via a stepwise, one-by-one addition is extremely challenging. With each successive amino acid coupling, the overall yield decreases exponentially. This results in a final product that is difficult to purify from a complex mixture of shorter, failed sequences. While some modern automated synthesizers have successfully produced peptides of this length, it remains a difficult task with a high risk of failure. Therefore, for a 100aa peptide, SPPS is often combined with fragment ligation techniques like NCL rather than used directly.\n\nIn conclusion, for a one-off synthesis where feasibility and purity are the main concerns, **Native Chemical Ligation** is arguably the most helpful and robust strategy. If larger quantities are needed and the specialized molecular biology tools are available, **Recombinant Expression with an Expanded Genetic Code** is an equally powerful and suitable option.\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) or Recombinant Protein Expression with an Expanded Genetic Code.>>>Synthesizing a 100-amino acid peptide containing an unnatural amino acid like azido-phenylalanine presents a significant challenge that pushes the boundaries of standard synthetic methods.
