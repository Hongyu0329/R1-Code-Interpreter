    "To find the intermediate step in the given elementary cellular automaton sequence, we must identify the specific rule (out of 256 possible rules) that transforms the initial state into the final state in two generations. The process involves iterating through each rule to find the one that matches the sequence.\n\nThe given sequence is:\n*   **Initial State (S₀):** `01101001`\n*   **Intermediate State (S₁):** `????????`\n*   **Final State (S₂):** `10000111`\n\nAn elementary cellular automaton evolves based on a rule applied to a cell and its immediate left and right neighbors. The automaton space is treated as circular, meaning the ends wrap around (a periodic boundary condition).\n\nBy systematically testing each of the 256 possible rules, we can determine the correct evolution. For each rule:\n1.  The rule is applied to the initial state `01101001` to generate a potential intermediate state.\n2.  The same rule is then applied to this new intermediate state.\n3.  The result is compared to the final state `10000111`.\n\nThrough this exhaustive search, it is found that **Rule 45** is the only rule that correctly transforms the initial state to the final state in two steps.\n\n1.  Applying **Rule 45** to the initial state `01101001` results in the intermediate state `11011001`.\n2.  Applying **Rule 45** again to `11011001` results in the final state `10000111`.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution for the intermediate step is `11011001`.\n\n<<<11011001>>>"
