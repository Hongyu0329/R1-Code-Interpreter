    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts an aldehyde or a ketone into an alkene by reacting it with a phosphorus ylide (also known as a Wittig reagent). The byproduct of this reaction is triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\nThe specific reactants for this reaction are:\n1.  **Pivalaldehyde:** An aldehyde with the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO, which has a bulky tert-butyl group attached to the carbonyl.\n2.  **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane:** This is the phosphorus ylide. The name indicates a triphenylphosphine group (Ph₃P) is double-bonded to an ethylidene group (=CH-CH₃) which is substituted at the second carbon. The structure is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl).\n\nIn the Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the aldehyde's carbonyl group is exchanged with the carbon group of the ylide to form a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n(CH₃)₃C-CHO + Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄) → (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄) + Ph₃PO\n\nTo name the resulting alkene, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond. This chain is five carbons long (a pentene). Numbering from the end closest to the double bond gives the IUPAC name **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nThe stereochemistry of the double bond (E/Z isomerism) is determined by the stability of the ylide.\n*   **Non-stabilized ylides**, where the group attached to the ylidic carbon is an alkyl or hydrogen, are highly reactive. The reaction is kinetically controlled and typically yields the (Z)-alkene (cis) as the major product.\n*   **Stabilized ylides**, which have an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl or ester) on the ylidic carbon, are less reactive. This leads to a thermodynamically controlled reaction that predominantly forms the more stable (E)-alkene (trans).\n\nIn this case, the ylide is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄). The group on the ylidic carbon is -CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄), which is a substituted alkyl group. As it is not an electron-withdrawing group, this is a **non-stabilized ylide**. Therefore, the reaction will favor the formation of the (Z)-isomer.\n\nThe final product from the Wittig reaction of pivalaldehyde with (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane is primarily **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<<**(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**>>>"
