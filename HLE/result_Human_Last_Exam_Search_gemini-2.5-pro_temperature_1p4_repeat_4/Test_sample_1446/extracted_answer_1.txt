The value of the critical exponent ν is not a single number but is determined by the spatial dimension (d) and the symmetry (N) of the system's order parameter within the φ⁴-theoretical framework. Key values are: ν = 1/2 for d ≥ 4; ν ≈ 0.63 for the 3D Ising model (N=1); and ν = 1 for the 2D Ising model (N=1).
