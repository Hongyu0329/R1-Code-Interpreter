    "Based on current research, there are exactly **three** finite groups, up to isomorphism, that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA product-free set in a group G is a subset S where for any two elements a and b in S (including when a and b are the same element), their product a*b is not in S. A product-free set is considered maximal by inclusion if it cannot be extended by adding any other element from the group without losing the product-free property.\n\nInitially, a 2019 paper by V. A. Petrov identified five such groups. However, subsequent analysis and a formal correction by the author have revised this number. The confirmed list of groups is:\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 7 (C₇ or Z₇):** In this group, the set {1, 3, 5} is an example of a maximal product-free set of size 3.\n2.  **The dihedral group of order 8 (D₈):** This group, representing the symmetries of a square, also contains such a set.\n3.  **The non-abelian group of order 27 with exponent 9:** This is a specific group of order 27 where not all elements cube to the identity.\n\nThe two groups that were initially and incorrectly included in this list were the cyclic group of order 5 (C₅) and the quaternion group of order 8 (Q₈). It has been established through earlier and independent work that the largest possible size for a product-free set in these two groups is actually 2.\n\nTherefore, the definitive number of finite groups possessing a maximal product-free set of size 3 is three.\n\n<<<3>>>"
