The minimal resources required to simulate the correlations of a singlet state with an LHV model depend on the type of measurement. For projective measurements, the minimal resource is, on average, **1 bit of communication** or **1 PR-Box**. For the more general set of all POVM measurements, the minimal average communication cost is approximately **5.7 bits**.
