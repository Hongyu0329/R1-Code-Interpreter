The "value" of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is defined by the Berezin integration rules: \( \int d\theta = 0 \) and \( \int d\theta \, \theta = 1 \). These rules ensure that the integration is consistent with the anti-commuting nature of Grassmann variables (\( \theta_i \theta_j = -\theta_j \theta_i \)), which leads to the property \( \theta^2 = 0 \). This latter property is the mathematical representation of the Pauli exclusion principle in the formalism.
