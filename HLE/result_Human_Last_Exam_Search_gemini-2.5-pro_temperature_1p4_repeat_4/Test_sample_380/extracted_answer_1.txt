The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not considered radial due to the Parker Spiral nature of the interplanetary magnetic field. However, the use of magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (denoted by Y and Z) for calculating the normalized magnetic helicity of Alfven Ion Cyclotron (AIC) waves is a justified and standard practice. This is because the high-speed solar wind allows for the application of the Taylor Hypothesis, where the spacecraft effectively samples the plasma along the radial flow direction. The definition of reduced magnetic helicity is based on the magnetic field fluctuations transverse to this sampling direction. The Geocentric Solar Ecliptic (GSE) coordinate system, commonly used for L1 data, aligns its X-axis with the radial direction, making the Y and Z components the natural choice for representing these transverse fluctuations.
