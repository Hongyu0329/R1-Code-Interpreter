    "## The Dawn of Writing in the Americas: A Tale of Three Artifacts\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is a subject of ongoing scholarly debate, with three key archaeological finds at the center of the discussion. While the Olmec civilization presents the oldest potential evidence, the most securely dated and interpreted example comes from the Zapotecs in the Oaxaca Valley of Mexico.\n\nThe most widely accepted and securely dated example of early Mesoamerican writing that records a date is **Monument 3 from the Zapotec site of San José Mogote in Oaxaca, Mexico**. Dated to around 600 BCE, this carved stone slab depicts a naked and sacrificed captive. Between the figure's feet are glyphs that have been interpreted as his name, \"1 Eye\" or \"1 Motion,\" which corresponds to a day in the 260-day sacred calendar used throughout Mesoamerica. The fact that the stone was found *in situ* in a corridor where it could be walked upon, and stratigraphically sealed, provides a strong basis for its dating and context as a form of political propaganda. This makes \"1 Eye\" the earliest known named individual in the Americas.\n\nHowever, two other significant discoveries from the Olmec civilization are contenders for the title of the earliest American writing, though their claims are subject to more debate.\n\nThe **Cascajal block**, a serpentine slab discovered in the Olmec heartland of Veracruz, Mexico, contains 62 incised glyphs. It has been dated to approximately 900 BCE, which would make it the oldest known writing in the New World. This dating is based on the ceramic shards and other artifacts found with it. However, the block was not excavated by archaeologists in a controlled setting but was found by road builders, leading to skepticism about its true age and context. Additionally, the script is arranged in horizontal rows, unlike other known vertical or linear Mesoamerican writing systems, and the glyphs do not resemble those of later scripts. Despite these concerns, geological analyses have supported the block's antiquity.\n\nThe second Olmec find comes from **San Andrés**, an elite satellite community of the major center of La Venta in Tabasco, Mexico. Artifacts, including a ceramic cylinder seal and greenstone plaque fragments, were discovered in a refuse dump from a feast and are securely dated by radiocarbon to about 650 BCE. The cylinder seal depicts a bird with symbols emanating from its beak, which some researchers interpret as spoken words, specifically the calendrical name \"3 Ajaw,\" which also means \"king.\" This would represent a direct recording of a date and a royal title. However, other scholars argue that these symbols are sophisticated iconography rather than a true writing system.\n\nIn summary, while the Cascajal block and the San Andrés artifacts present tantalizing possibilities of even earlier writing, the glyphs on Monument 3 from San José Mogote currently stand as the most widely accepted and archaeologically secure evidence for the earliest recorded date in a pre-Columbian writing system.\n\n<<<The calendrical name \"1 Eye\" or \"1 Motion\" on Monument 3 from the Zapotec site of San José Mogote, dated to around 600 BCE.>>>"
