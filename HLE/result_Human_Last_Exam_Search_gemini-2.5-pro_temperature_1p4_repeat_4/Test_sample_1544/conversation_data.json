    "In the provided chess position, with the FEN `8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1`, White's optimal move is a queen sacrifice to ensure the promotion of the d-pawn.\n\nThe key to White's advantage is the advanced passed pawn on d6. However, Black's queen on c5 controls the promotion square (d8) and poses a significant threat.\n\nThe winning move for White is:\n\n<<<Qxc6+>>>"
