**Inside the rod (r < R):**
The Poynting vector is given by:
`$$ \vec{S}_{in} = -\frac{E \rho v r}{2} \hat{r} + \frac{\rho^2 v r^2}{4 \epsilon_0} \hat{z} $$`

**Outside the rod (r > R):**
The Poynting vector is given by:
`$$ \vec{S}_{out} = -\frac{E \rho v R^2}{2r} \hat{r} + \frac{\rho^2 v R^4}{4 \epsilon_0 r^2} \hat{z} $$`

where:
*   `E` is the magnitude of the external electric field.
*   `ρ` is the uniform volume charge density.
*   `v` is the speed of the rod.
*   `R` is the radius of the rod.
*   `r` is the radial distance from the axis of the rod.
*   `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space.
*   `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.
*   `ẑ` is the unit vector along the axis of the rod.
