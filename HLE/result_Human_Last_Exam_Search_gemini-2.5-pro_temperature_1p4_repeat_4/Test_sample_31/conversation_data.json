    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case in the CFOP method for a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, a solver must be able to see a minimum of **8** non-top-facing stickers.\n\nThe process of identifying a PLL case involves observing the permutation of the corner and edge pieces of the last layer, after they have all been oriented (meaning the top face is a solid color). There are 21 possible PLL cases to distinguish between.\n\nSpeedcubers often use \"2-sided PLL recognition,\" which involves looking at the stickers on only two adjacent faces of the last layer to determine the case. By examining the patterns of these stickers, it is possible to deduce the entire permutation of the last layer.\n\nLet's break down the sticker count on two adjacent faces of the last layer:\n*   Each of the two faces has 3 non-top-facing stickers: 2 on the corners and 1 on the edge.\n*   This would initially suggest a total of 6 stickers.\n\nHowever, to differentiate between certain cases, particularly those that may appear similar from one two-sided view, it is necessary to see the stickers on the third edge piece of one of those faces. This means looking at one full face (three stickers) and the adjacent two side stickers of the neighboring last layer pieces. More comprehensive recognition guides confirm that observing the six stickers on two adjacent sides is a common technique. For instance, recognizing \"headlights\" (two corners on a face with the same color sticker) or blocks of solved pieces are key visual cues.\n\nTo be absolutely certain and to distinguish between all 21 cases without any ambiguity from a single viewing angle, a solver would need to observe the stickers on three of the four side faces of the top layer. This amounts to:\n*   **Three edge pieces:** 3 stickers\n*   **Four corner pieces (the two stickers on the sides):** 8 stickers\nIn practice, however, efficient recognition relies on recognizing patterns from just two sides. The minimum information needed from these two sides to differentiate all cases includes the three stickers on one face and the three stickers on an adjacent face, which totals six stickers. However, to resolve ambiguities between certain similar cases from this view, one more piece of information is often required, which can be gained by looking at one more adjacent sticker. A common method involves looking at the colors of the three stickers on one side face and the colors of the three stickers on an adjacent side face, plus one more sticker on a third side to resolve any ambiguity.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of stickers required to be seen is eight, which corresponds to the four corner side-stickers and the four edge stickers of the last layer.\n\n<<<8>>>"
