    "In a game of chess where two players cooperate to place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares, 14 squares would be left without bishops. Here is a breakdown of how this is determined.\n\nA standard 8x8 chessboard has 28 edge squares. The challenge is to place as many bishops as possible on these squares so that no two bishops threaten each other. A solution to this problem shows that the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on a chessboard is 14. For an n x n board, this number is generally 2n - 2.\n\nOne way to achieve this maximum placement is to place bishops on all the squares of the first row, and then on all the squares of the last row except for the corners. However, since the problem specifies placing bishops only on the edge squares, a different configuration is needed. The maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed *only* on the edge squares is indeed 14.\n\nTherefore, with the successful placement of 14 bishops on the 28 available edge squares, there would be 14 edge squares left empty.\n\n<<<14>>>"
