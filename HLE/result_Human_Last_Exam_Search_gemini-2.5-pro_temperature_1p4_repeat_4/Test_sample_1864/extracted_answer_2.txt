For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment with streptavidin beads, you should prepare a minimum of 10 essential control samples, with the recommendation to include additional Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls for each channel where precise gating is critical. The essential controls include: 5 single-stained compensation controls (one for each fluorochrome: AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750), 1 unstained cell control, 1 unstained bead control, 1 viability dye control, 1 bead-only with staining mix control, and at least one FMO control.
