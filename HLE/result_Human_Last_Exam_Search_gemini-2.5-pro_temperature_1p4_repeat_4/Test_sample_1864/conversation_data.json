    "For a successful five-color flow cytometry sorting experiment using streptavidin beads with AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750 detection channels, preparing a comprehensive set of controls is critical for accurate data interpretation and successful sorting. Here are the essential controls you should prepare:\n\n### **1. Compensation Controls (Single-Stained Controls)**\n\nDue to the use of five different fluorochromes, there will be significant spectral overlap between the channels. Compensation is the process of correcting for this spillover. You will need a single-stained control for each fluorochrome in your panel. These can be prepared using either cells or beads.\n\n*   **AF350 single stain**\n*   **GFP single stain**\n*   **PE single stain**\n*   **AF647 single stain**\n*   **AF750 single stain**\n\nFor each compensation control, it is crucial that the positive and negative populations have the same level of autofluorescence and that the fluorochrome used is identical to the one in your experiment. The signal from the positive control should be at least as bright as the signal you expect in your experimental sample.\n\n### **2. Unstained Controls**\n\nThese are necessary to assess the natural fluorescence (autofluorescence) of both your cells and the streptavidin beads.\n\n*   **Unstained Cells:** This sample will help you determine the baseline fluorescence of your cellular population in each detector.\n*   **Unstained Streptavidin Beads:** This will show the autofluorescence of the beads alone, which is important as beads can have their own fluorescent properties.\n\n### **3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls**\n\nFMO controls are critical for accurately setting the gates for your sorted populations, especially in a multi-color experiment. An FMO control contains all the fluorochromes in your panel except for one. This allows you to see the spread of the other fluorochromes into the channel of the missing one, which is essential for distinguishing true positive signals from background. For a five-color panel, you would ideally have five FMO controls, though they are most critical for channels where the signal is dim or the positive and negative populations are not clearly separated.\n\n*   **FMO for AF350:** Stained with GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750.\n*   **FMO for GFP:** Stained with AF350, PE, AF647, and AF750.\n*   **FMO for PE:** Stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, and AF750.\n*   **FMO for AF647:** Stained with AF350, GFP, PE, and AF750.\n*   **FMO for AF750:** Stained with AF350, GFP, PE, and AF647.\n\n### **4. Biological and Staining Controls**\n\nThese controls are designed to ensure the specificity of your staining.\n\n*   **Viability Dye Control:** Dead cells can non-specifically bind antibodies and exhibit increased autofluorescence, leading to false positives. Including a viability dye is essential for excluding dead cells from your analysis and sort. You will need an unstained sample and a sample with only the viability dye to properly set the gate for live cells. Note that this adds another color to your panel, so the viability dye must be spectrally compatible with your other five fluorochromes.\n*   **Negative Control Cells:** A population of cells that does not express the antigen of interest can serve as a true negative control for gating.\n*   **Positive Control Cells:** A population of cells known to express the antigen of interest helps to confirm that your staining protocol is working correctly.\n\n### **5. Streptavidin Bead-Specific Controls**\n\nGiven the use of streptavidin beads, additional controls are necessary to account for potential non-specific interactions.\n\n*   **Beads + Staining Mix (without biotinylated target):** This control consists of streptavidin beads incubated with your full cocktail of fluorescently labeled antibodies (or secondary reagents). This will reveal any non-specific binding of your detection reagents to the streptavidin beads themselves.\n*   **Isotype Controls (Optional and use with caution):** Isotype controls are antibodies of the same isotype (e.g., IgG1, IgG2a) and fluorochrome as your primary antibody, but they target an antigen not present in your sample. While their use is debated and they should not be used for setting positive gates, they can sometimes help to identify issues with non-specific binding, particularly Fc-mediated binding to cells. FMO controls are generally considered a more robust alternative for accurate gating.\n\nIn summary, for a rigorous five-color sorting experiment with streptavidin beads, you should prepare a minimum of the following control tubes:\n\n1.  Unstained Cells\n2.  Unstained Beads\n3.  AF350 Single Stain\n4.  GFP Single Stain\n5.  PE Single Stain\n6.  AF647 Single Stain\n7.  AF750 Single Stain\n8.  Viability Dye Only Control\n9.  Beads + Staining Mix (no biotinylated molecule)\n10. At least one, and ideally five, FMO controls, prioritizing the markers that are dimmest or most critical for your sort gates.\n\nThis comprehensive set of controls will allow for proper compensation, accurate gating, and confident interpretation of your sorting results.\n\n<<<For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment with streptavidin beads, you should prepare a minimum of 10 essential control samples, with the recommendation to include additional Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls for each channel where precise gating is critical. The essential controls include: 5 single-stained compensation controls (one for each fluorochrome: AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750), 1 unstained cell control, 1 unstained bead control, 1 viability dye control, 1 bead-only with staining mix control, and at least one FMO control.>>>"
