    "The next letter in the sequence should be **M**.\n\nThe sequence `ZXXCVYBN` is a classic letter puzzle based on the layout of a standard QWERTY keyboard. The core of the sequence is the bottom row of letters, which are Z, X, C, V, B, N, and M.\n\nThe extra \"X\" and the \"Y\" are typically included as distractors to make the pattern less obvious. The fundamental pattern is the order of keys on the keyboard's bottom row. Following this pattern, the letter that appears after \"N\" is \"M\".\n\n<<<M>>>"
