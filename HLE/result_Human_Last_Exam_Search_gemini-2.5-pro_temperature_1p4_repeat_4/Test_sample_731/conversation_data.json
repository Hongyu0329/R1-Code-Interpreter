    "A power subgroup is a subgroup that can be generated by a single element; this is also known as a cyclic subgroup. To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we must determine the number of distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\nThe semidihedral group of order 512, denoted as SD_512, can be represented by the presentation:\nSD_512 = ⟨a, b | a^256 = 1, b^2 = 1, bab = a^127⟩\n\nThe elements of this group are of two forms: a^i and a^i * b, where 0 ≤ i < 256.\n\n1.  **Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form a^i:**\n    These elements form a cyclic subgroup ⟨a⟩ of order 256. For any cyclic group of order 'n', the number of subgroups is equal to the number of divisors of 'n'. The number 256 (which is 2^8) has 9 divisors (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256). Each of these corresponds to a unique cyclic subgroup within ⟨a⟩. This gives us 9 power subgroups.\n\n2.  **Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form a^i * b:**\n    We must analyze the order of these elements to determine the subgroups they generate.\n    *   The square of an element (a^i * b) is (a^i * b)^2 = a^(128i).\n    *   If 'i' is an even number (i.e., i = 2k), the order of (a^i * b) is 2. There are 128 such even values for 'i' (0, 2, 4, ..., 254), and each generates a distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2. This accounts for 128 power subgroups.\n    *   If 'i' is an odd number (i.e., i = 2k+1), the order of (a^i * b) is 4. There are 128 such odd values for 'i' (1, 3, 5, ..., 255). These elements generate cyclic subgroups of order 4. However, some of these subgroups are identical. Specifically, the subgroup generated by a^i * b is the same as the one generated by a^(i+128) * b. This results in 128 / 2 = 64 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n\nThe subgroups generated by elements of the form a^i * b do not overlap with the non-trivial subgroups from ⟨a⟩, as they contain elements not in ⟨a⟩.\n\nTherefore, the total number of power subgroups is the sum of the subgroups from both cases:\nTotal Subgroups = (subgroups from ⟨a⟩) + (subgroups from a^i * b with even 'i') + (subgroups from a^i * b with odd 'i')\nTotal Subgroups = 9 + 128 + 64 = 201\n\n<<<201>>>"
