    "Yes, if $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a Schwartz class function such that all its moments are zero, it does follow that $f$ must be the zero function.\n\nHere is a step-by-step argument to explain why this is true:\n\n1.  **The Fourier Transform:** The first step is to consider the Fourier transform of the function $f(x)$. Let's denote the Fourier transform as $\\hat{f}(t)$. A key property of the Schwartz space, often denoted as $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, is that the Fourier transform maps this space to itself. This means that if $f$ is a Schwartz function, its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ is also a Schwartz function.\n\n2.  **Relating Moments to Derivatives:** The condition that all moments of $f$ are zero connects to the derivatives of its Fourier transform at the origin. The k-th derivative of the Fourier transform is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{dt^k}(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-2\\pi i x)^k f(x) e^{-2\\pi i xt} dx $$\n    Evaluating this at $t=0$ gives a direct relationship to the k-th moment of $f$:\n    $$ \\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{dt^k}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx $$\n\n3.  **Condition on the Fourier Transform:** The initial assumption is that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$. From the formula above, this directly implies that all derivatives of the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(t)$ at $t=0$ are zero:\n    $$ \\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{dt^k}(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\ge 0 $$\n\n4.  **Quasi-Analyticity of Schwartz Functions:** Now, the problem is reduced to showing that if a Schwartz function $\\hat{f}(t)$ and all of its derivatives are zero at a single point, then the function must be identically zero. This property is known as quasi-analyticity. While not all infinitely differentiable functions are analytic (meaning determined by their Taylor series), the class of Schwartz functions has this uniqueness property.\n\n5.  **Conclusion for the Fourier Transform:** Because $\\hat{f}(t)$ is a Schwartz function and all its derivatives vanish at $t=0$, it must be that $\\hat{f}(t) = 0$ for all $t$.\n\n6.  **Invertibility of the Fourier Transform:** The Fourier transform is an invertible operation on the Schwartz space. This means that if the Fourier transform of a function is zero, the function itself must be zero. Since we have concluded that $\\hat{f}(t) \\equiv 0$, it follows that $f(x) \\equiv 0$.\n\nIn summary, the condition that all moments of a Schwartz function are zero forces its Fourier transform to have a zero of infinite order at the origin. The properties of Schwartz functions are strong enough to imply that such a Fourier transform must be the zero function, which in turn implies the original function must also be zero.\n\n<<<Yes, it follows that f = 0.>>>"
