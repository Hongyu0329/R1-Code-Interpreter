    "To determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ above 2, we need to analyze the curve over the 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The valuation $v$ is normalized such that $v(2)=1$.\n\n### Step 1: Initial analysis and model transformation\nLet $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. The curve is $C: z^2 = f(x)$.\nWe first determine the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f(x)=0$. We use the Newton polygon for $f(x)$ with respect to the 2-adic valuation. The vertices of the polygon are determined by the points $(i, v(a_i))$, where $a_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$.\nThe points are $(0, v(1)=0)$, $(3, v(2)=1)$, and $(5, v(2)=1)$. The lower convex hull is the single line segment from $(0,0)$ to $(5,1)$.\nThe slope of this segment is $(1-0)/(5-0) = 1/5$. This implies that all five roots of $f(x)$, let's call them $\\alpha_i$, have valuation $v(\\alpha_i) = -(-1/5) = 1/5$. However, this leads to a contradiction when substituting back into the polynomial.\n\nA correct application of the Newton polygon method finds the valuations of the roots of the reciprocal polynomial to analyze roots with negative valuation. Let $x=1/y$. The equation becomes $z^2 = 2/y^5+2/y^3+1$, which isn't a polynomial equation for y. The standard approach is to analyze the Newton polygon of $f(x)$ itself. Let's re-examine the vertices of the lower convex hull of the points $(i, v(a_i))$: $(0, v(1)=0), (1, \\infty), (2, \\infty), (3, v(2)=1), (4, \\infty), (5, v(2)=1)$.\nThe lower convex hull is the single segment connecting $(0,0)$ and $(5,1)$. The slope is $(1-0)/(5-0)=1/5$. This implies that there are 5 roots with valuation $-1/5$. This means the roots are large (not in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$).\n\nThis valuation indicates that a ramified extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ is necessary to analyze the curve's reduction. Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}_2(\\pi)$, where $\\pi^5 = 2$. In this field, the valuation is extended such that $v(\\pi) = 1/5$.\nTo work with a model over the ring of integers $O_K = \\mathbb{Z}_2[\\pi]$, we perform a change of variables. Let $x = y/\\pi$. Substituting this into the curve's equation:\n$z^2 = 2(y/\\pi)^5 + 2(y/\\pi)^3 + 1$\n$z^2 = (2/\\pi^5)y^5 + (2/\\pi^3)y^3 + 1$\nSince $\\pi^5 = 2$, this simplifies to:\n$z^2 = y^5 + \\pi^2 y^3 + 1$.\nLet's call this new model $C'$. It is defined over $O_K$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the special fiber of the new model\nThe special fiber is the reduction of the model $C'$ modulo the maximal ideal generated by $\\pi$. The residue field is $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$\\bar{C'}: z^2 = y^5 + 1$.\nTo determine if this reduced curve is smooth, we check for singular points. A point is singular if the partial derivatives of $F(y,z) = z^2 - y^5 - 1$ are zero. In characteristic 2:\n$\\partial F / \\partial z = 2z = 0$\n$\\partial F / \\partial y = -5y^4 = y^4 = 0$, which implies $y=0$.\nSubstituting $y=0$ into the curve equation gives $z^2 = 1$, so $z=1$.\nThus, the point $(y,z) = (0,1)$ is a singular point on the special fiber $\\bar{C'}$. The presence of this singularity means the curve has bad reduction over $K$. The stable reduction is not this model; it is obtained by resolving this singularity.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the valuation of the discriminant to the thickness\nFor a curve of genus $g$, the valuation of the minimal discriminant is related to the stable reduction through the conductor formula. For a curve with semistable reduction, this is given by the formula:\n$v(\\Delta_{\\text{min}}) = (2g-2) + \\sum_i \\delta_i$\nwhere $\\Delta_{\\text{min}}$ is the discriminant of the minimal model, $g$ is the genus, and $\\delta_i$ are the thicknesses of the double points of the stable reduction.\n\nThe genus of the curve $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ is $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\nWe need the valuation of the discriminant of our new model $C': z^2 = g(y)$, where $g(y) = y^5 + \\pi^2 y^3 + 1$. The discriminant of the curve model is $2^{4(g-1)}\\Delta(g(y))$, where $\\Delta(g(y))$ is the discriminant of the polynomial $g(y)$.\nLet's compute the valuation of $\\Delta(g(y))$ over $K$.\n$\\Delta(g(y)) \\equiv \\Delta(y^5+1) \\pmod \\pi$.\nThe discriminant of $y^n-c$ is $(-1)^{n(n-1)/2} n^n c^{n-1}$. For $y^5+1$, this is $5^5 (-1)^4 = 3125$.\nThe 2-adic valuation of $3125 = 5^5$ is $v(3125) = 0$. Since the valuation is 0, the discriminant of $g(y)$ is a unit in $O_K$.\nThe valuation of the curve's discriminant is:\n$v(\\Delta_{C'}) = v(2^{4(g-1)} \\Delta(g(y))) = v(2^4 \\Delta(g(y))) = v(2^4) + v(\\Delta(g(y)))$\n$v(\\Delta_{C'}) = 4v(2) + 0 = 4$.\n\nAssuming our model $C'$ is minimal (or that its discriminant valuation is minimal), we can use the formula. The problem implies a single double point. Let its thickness be $\\delta$.\n$v(\\Delta_{\\text{min}}) = (2 \\cdot 2 - 2) + \\delta$\n$4 = 2 + \\delta$\n$\\delta = 2$.\n\nThe thickness of the double point is a measure of the degeneracy of the model. The value $\\delta=2$ indicates that the stable reduction has a single double point of thickness 2. This typically corresponds to an irreducible stable curve of geometric genus 1 (an elliptic curve with a node).\n\n<<<2>>>"
