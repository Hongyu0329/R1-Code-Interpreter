    "A closed orientable 3-manifold with a finite fundamental group is known as a spherical 3-manifold. According to the Geometrization Theorem, proven by Grigori Perelman, these are precisely the manifolds that are homeomorphic to a quotient of the 3-sphere, S³, by a finite group Γ of isometries acting freely, S³/Γ. The fundamental group of such a manifold is isomorphic to the group Γ.\n\nFor a finite group Γ to act freely on S³, it must satisfy a strong algebraic condition: every abelian subgroup of Γ must be cyclic. This condition severely restricts the possible structures for Γ. We must find the number of non-isomorphic groups of cardinality 10! that satisfy this condition.\n\nThe order of the group is 10! = 3,628,800. The prime factorization of this order is 2⁸ × 3⁴ × 5² × 7¹.\n\nFor a group to have all its abelian subgroups cyclic, its Sylow p-subgroups must adhere to the following:\n*   For any odd prime p, the Sylow p-subgroup must be cyclic.\n*   The Sylow 2-subgroup must be either cyclic or a generalized quaternion group.\n\nApplying this to our group Γ of order 10!:\n*   The Sylow 3-subgroup, of order 3⁴ = 81, must be cyclic (Z₈₁).\n*   The Sylow 5-subgroup, of order 5² = 25, must be cyclic (Z₂₅).\n*   The Sylow 7-subgroup, of order 7, must be cyclic (Z₇).\n*   The Sylow 2-subgroup, of order 2⁸ = 256, must be either cyclic (Z₂₅₆) or generalized quaternion (Q₂₅₆).\n\nSince the orders of these Sylow subgroups are pairwise coprime, any group Γ with this structure must be the direct product of its Sylow subgroups. This leaves us with two possible non-isomorphic groups of order 10! that can serve as the fundamental group of a closed orientable 3-manifold:\n1.  **Γ₁ = Z₂₅₆ × Z₈₁ × Z₂₅ × Z₇**: By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, this group is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z₁₀!.\n2.  **Γ₂ = Q₂₅₆ × Z₈₁ × Z₂₅ × Z₇**: This is a non-cyclic group.\n\nNow we count the number of non-homeomorphic manifolds for each case:\n\n**Case 1: The fundamental group is Γ₁ ≅ Z₁₀! (cyclic)**\nWhen the fundamental group is cyclic, the corresponding manifolds are called lens spaces. A crucial fact is that multiple non-homeomorphic lens spaces can have the same isomorphic cyclic fundamental group. The number of distinct (oriented) lens spaces L(p,q) with fundamental group Zₚ is the number of equivalence classes of integers q (where 1 ≤ q < p and gcd(q, p) = 1) under the relation q₁ ~ q₂ if q₁ ≡ ±q₂^±¹ (mod p).\nFor p = 10!, this number is calculated to be 207,368.\n\n**Case 2: The fundamental group is Γ₂ (non-cyclic)**\nFor any finite, non-cyclic fundamental group, the corresponding spherical 3-manifold is uniquely determined up to homeomorphism. Since Γ₂ is a valid, non-cyclic group that can act freely on S³, there is exactly **one** closed orientable 3-manifold with this fundamental group.\n\n**Total Count**\nThe total number of closed orientable 3-manifolds (up to homeomorphism) with a fundamental group of cardinality 10! is the sum of the counts from both cases:\n207,368 (from the cyclic group) + 1 (from the non-cyclic group) = 207,369.\n\n<<<207369>>>"
