Based on the evidence, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 are predicted to exhibit a more robust and potent release of key anti-tumor effector cytokines, such as IFN-Î³, upon antigen stimulation compared to those made without IL-15. This enhanced cytokine secretion contributes to their superior anti-tumor activity. However, the effect on the overall cytokine profile related to Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) is more complex, with some evidence suggesting a potential for increased CRS, while other studies indicate a possibly more favorable safety profile with lower levels of certain CRS-associated cytokines.
