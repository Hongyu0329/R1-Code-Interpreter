    "The user wants the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 method.\n\nBased on the search results, here's what I've found:\n- A method is A($\\alpha$)-stable if its stability region includes the sector {$z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| < \\alpha$} for $\\alpha \\in (0, \\pi/2)$.\n- For the BDF4 method, the angle of A($\\alpha$)-stability is approximately 73.35°.\n- A paper by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis provides precise expressions for the maximum angles of A($\\vartheta$)-stability for BDF methods.\n- Another paper by Gander and Wanner simplifies the derivation of these exact values using Maple. It mentions a polynomial whose largest root is needed to compute the tangent of the angle.\n- The root locus curve for the k-step BDF method is given by $w = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{j}(1-z^{-1})^j$, where $z$ is on the unit circle. This curve describes the boundary of the stability domain.\n- The angle $\\alpha$ is related to the tangent lines from the origin to the stability boundary.\n\nTo find the exact value, I need to follow the procedure outlined by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis or Gander and Wanner. The process involves:\n1.  Defining the stability polynomial for BDF4.\n2.  Parametrizing the boundary of the stability region.\n3.  Finding the maximum angle of a line from the origin that is contained within the stability region.\n\nThe paper by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis gives the following result for BDF4:\n$\\tan(\\vartheta_4) = \\frac{3(20-3\\sqrt{10})}{20\\sqrt{2}-21}$.\n\nLet's double check this with another source. The Gander and Wanner paper mentions that for k=4, the value of $t_0^2$ (where $t = \\tan(\\phi/2)$ and $\\phi$ defines the point on the unit circle) that gives the extremal angle is rational. This leads to an expression for $p_0 = \\tan(\\alpha)$ containing a square root.\n\nThe provided information appears to be sufficient. The papers by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis and by Gander and Wanner directly address the question of the exact value of the stability angle for BDF methods. I can use the expression from these papers to formulate the final answer.\n\nI will proceed to state the final answer based on the formula found. The user wants the answer in terms of $\\arctan()$. So, $\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3(20-3\\sqrt{10})}{20\\sqrt{2}-21}\\right)$. However, the question asks for the angle $\\alpha$ in radians, so I should be careful. The question asks for the value of the angle $\\alpha$ of A($\\alpha$)-stability. The angle $\\alpha$ is half of the angle of the stability sector. The search results refer to $\\vartheta_q$ as the maximum half-angle of the stability sector. The question seems to use $\\alpha$ for this half-angle.\n\nLet me verify the expression for $\\tan(\\vartheta_4)$. The paper by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis states: \"For q = 4, the largest real root of the polynomial... leads to... $c_4 = \\frac{3(20-3\\sqrt{10})}{20\\sqrt{2}-21}$\". They define $c_q = \\tan(\\vartheta_q)$. So this is indeed the expression for the tangent of the stability angle.\n\nTherefore, the angle $\\alpha$ is $\\arctan\\left(\\frac{3(20-3\\sqrt{10})}{20\\sqrt{2}-21}\\right)$.\n\nI have all the necessary information and can now provide the final answer.The A($\\alpha$) stability of a numerical method refers to its ability to solve stiff differential equations. The stability region of the method must contain a sector in the left-half of the complex plane defined by the angle $\\alpha$. Specifically, a method is A($\\alpha$)-stable if its stability region S contains the wedge $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} | |\\arg(-z)| < \\alpha, z \\neq 0\\}$, for some $\\alpha \\in (0, \\pi/2)$.\n\nFor the fourth-order Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF4), the stability region is not the entire left-half plane, but it does contain a wedge with a specific angle $\\alpha$. The exact value of this angle has been a subject of study, with recent work providing a precise analytical expression.\n\nThe boundary of the stability region for the BDF methods is determined by the root locus curve of the stability polynomial. The angle $\\alpha$ is found by determining the angle of the tangent lines from the origin to this boundary curve.\n\nWhile numerical approximations for the A($\\alpha$) stability angle of BDF4 are often cited as approximately 73.35°, the exact value has been determined by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis. They found that the tangent of the stability angle $\\vartheta_4$ (denoted as $\\alpha$ in the query) is given by a formula involving square roots.\n\nThe exact value for the tangent of the angle of A($\\alpha$)-stability for the BDF4 scheme is:\n$\\tan(\\alpha) = \\frac{3(20 - 3\\sqrt{10})}{20\\sqrt{2} - 21}$\n\nTherefore, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ in radians is given by the arctangent of this expression.\n\n<<<$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3(20 - 3\\sqrt{10})}{20\\sqrt{2} - 21}\\right)$>>>"
