    "The initial search has confirmed that the problem of packing equal circles into a larger circle is a well-studied area of mathematics. I found resources that discuss optimal packings for various numbers of circles, including 14. Specifically, some results mention that the optimal packing for n=14 has been proven. Some search results provide diagrams and mention properties like the number of contacts or the presence of \"loose\" or \"rattling\" circles. However, the exact geometric arrangement and a formula or a calculated radius of the larger circle for 14 smaller circles of radius 1 are not explicitly and clearly provided in a single document. I need to find a more detailed description or a precise diagram of the optimal packing of 14 circles to perform the calculation.The second search has provided more specific information. I found a PDF document from E. Specht that gives a value for the radius of the larger circle when 14 smaller circles are packed inside. The document states a \"ratio\" of 1.670183528370, which is the ratio of the radius of the large circle to the radius of the small circles. If the small circles have a radius of 1, then the large circle's radius is simply this ratio. The search also confirms that the optimal packing for n=14 has been proven. Another source provides a table with values for the radius of the containing circle for up to N=2600 circles, and indicates that the results for N=14 are proven to be optimal. The data from E. Specht seems reliable and directly answers the question. I will now proceed to calculate the final answer based on this information.\n\nI have found a reliable source that provides the ratio of the radius of the large circle to the radius of the small circles for the optimal packing of 14 circles. The ratio is given as 1.670183528370. Since the small circles have a radius of one, the radius of the large circle is this value. I just need to round this to 4 significant digits.\n\n1.670183528370 rounded to 4 significant digits is 1.670.\n\nI will now provide the final answer.\nThe search results from my previous steps have provided a definitive answer. A document from E. Specht on circle packing gives the ratio of the radius of the large circle to the radius of the small circles for n=14 as 1.670183528370. Since the small circles have a radius of one, the radius of the large circle is this value. The question asks for the answer up to 4 significant digits.\n\nRounding 1.670183528370 to 4 significant digits gives 1.670.\n\nTherefore, I have sufficient information to answer the user's request.\nThe radius of the large circle is the given ratio multiplied by the radius of the small circles.\nRadius of large circle = 1.670183528370 * 1 = 1.670183528370.\n\nRounding to 4 significant digits, the radius is 1.670.The problem of finding the radius of the smallest circle that can enclose fourteen circles of radius one is a well-documented problem in the field of mathematics known as circle packing. The solution to this problem has been proven to be optimal.\n\nFor a configuration of fourteen smaller circles, each with a radius of one, the radius of the larger, enclosing circle is a known value. According to the data compiled by E. Specht, a recognized resource in this area, the ratio of the radius of the enclosing circle to the radius of the one of the smaller circles is approximately 1.67018.\n\nTherefore, for fourteen tightly packed circles of radius one, the radius of the enclosing circle is approximately 1.6702. When rounded to four significant digits, the radius is 1.670.\n\n<<<1.670>>>"
