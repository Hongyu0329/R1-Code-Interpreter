    "A comprehensive analysis is required to determine the number of true boolean expressions that can be formed using exactly 5 of the symbols T, F, !, &, |, (, ). The symbols can be used more than once. The standard operator precedence is `!` > `&` > `|`, and operators with the same precedence are evaluated left-to-right.\n\nWe can categorize the expressions based on their top-level structure. An expression of length 5 can be formed in one of the following ways:\n1.  `(A)`: An expression `A` enclosed in parentheses.\n2.  `!A`: An expression `A` preceded by a negation operator.\n3.  `A | B`: Two expressions `A` and `B` joined by an OR operator.\n4.  `A & B`: Two expressions `A` and `B` joined by an AND operator.\n\nLet's systematically count the number of true expressions in each category. This requires knowing the number of true and false expressions of shorter lengths. Through a combinatorial construction, we can determine the counts for expressions of lengths 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n*   **Length 1:**\n    *   True: `T` (1)\n    *   False: `F` (1)\n*   **Length 2:**\n    *   True: `!F` (1)\n    *   False: `!T` (1)\n*   **Length 3:**\n    *   True: `(T)`, `!!T`, `T&T`, `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T` (6)\n    *   False: `(F)`, `!!F`, `F&F`, `F|F`, `T&F`, `F&T` (6)\n*   **Length 4:**\n    *   True: 15 expressions\n    *   False: 15 expressions\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of true expressions of length 5:\n\n**1. Form `(A)` where `A` is a true expression of length 3.**\nThe parentheses add 2 to the length. For the total length to be 5, `A` must have length 3. The expression `(A)` is true if `A` is true.\nThere are 6 true expressions of length 3: `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`, `(!!T)`, and `((T))`.\n*   **Count: 6**\n\n**2. Form `!A` where `A` is a false expression of length 4.**\nThe `!` operator adds 1 to the length. For the total length to be 5, `A` must have length 4. The expression `!A` is true if `A` is false. There are 15 distinct false expressions of length 4.\nExamples include `!(!T)`, `!(T&T)`, and `!(!F|T)`.\n*   **Count: 15**\n\n**3. Form `A | B` where the total length is 5.**\nThe `|` operator has the lowest precedence. This structure will be true if `A` is true or `B` is true. We sum the combinations of lengths for `A` and `B` that add up to 4 (since the `|` symbol takes one position).\n*   **Length 1 and 3:** `A` (length 1) | `B` (length 3).\n    *   If `A` is `T`, the expression is always true. `B` can be any of the 12 valid expressions of length 3. This gives 12 expressions.\n    *   If `A` is `F`, `B` must be true. There are 6 true expressions of length 3. This gives 6 expressions.\n    *   Total for this part: 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Length 2 and 2:** `A` (length 2) | `B` (length 2).\n    *   `!F|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!T|!F` are true. This gives 3 expressions.\n*   **Length 3 and 1:** `A` (length 3) | `B` (length 1).\n    *   This is symmetric to the length 1 and 3 case, giving another 18 expressions.\n*   Total for this category: 18 + 3 + 18 = 39.\n*   **Count: 39**\n\n**4. Form `A & B` where the total length is 5.**\nFor `A & B` to be true, both `A` and `B` must be true. Due to the precedence rules, the top-level operator will be `&` only if `A` and `B` do not have `|` as their top-level operator.\n*   **Length 1 and 3:** `T & B`, where `B` is a true length-3 expression not containing a top-level `|`. There are 3 such expressions for `B`: `(T)`, `!!T`, `T&T`. This gives 3 expressions.\n*   **Length 2 and 2:** `!F & !F`. This gives 1 expression.\n*   **Length 3 and 1:** `A & T`, where `A` is a true length-3 expression not containing a top-level `|`. This is symmetric to the first case, but we must account for identical strings. The expression `T&T&T` is counted in both, while the other expressions like `T&(T)` and `(T)&T` are unique. The unique true expressions are: `T&(T)`, `T&!!T`, `(T)&T`, `!!T&T`, `T&T&T`, and `!F&!F`.\n*   **Count: 6**\n\nSumming the counts from all categories:\n6 (from `(A)`) + 15 (from `!A`) + 39 (from `A | B`) + 6 (from `A & B`) = 66.\n\nThere are 66 possible true boolean expressions that can be written with exactly 5 symbols from the given set.\n\n<<<66>>>"
