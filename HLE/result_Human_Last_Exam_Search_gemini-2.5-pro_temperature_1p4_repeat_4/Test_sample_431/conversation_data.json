    "A study on the human GABAAρ1 receptor revealed that each ρ1 subunit contains a single cysteine residue located in the intracellular linker domain between the third and fourth transmembrane segments (TM3-TM4). This specific cysteine is found at position 364 of the amino acid sequence.\n\nA homomeric receptor is composed of five identical subunits. Therefore, in a human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor, there is one cysteine residue in the TM3-TM4 linker of each of the five subunits.\n\n<<<1>>>"
