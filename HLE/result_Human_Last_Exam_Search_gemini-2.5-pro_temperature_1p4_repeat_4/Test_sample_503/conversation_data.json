    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, when viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, is equivalent to a Galois connection (or an adjunction) between the corresponding posets.\n\nLet the two objects be $[m]$ and $[n]$, which are the finite totally ordered sets $[m] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$ and $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$. For this problem, we have $m=23$ and $n=37$.\n\nAn adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ consists of a pair of order-preserving maps, a left adjoint $u: [m] \\to [n]$ and a right adjoint $f: [n] \\to [m]$, such that for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$, the following equivalence holds:\n$u(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le f(j)$\n\nThis is equivalent to the two conditions:\n1.  $f(u(i)) \\ge i$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n2.  $u(f(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [n]$.\n\nA pair of maps $(u, f)$ forming an adjunction is uniquely determined by either the left adjoint $u$ or the right adjoint $f$. A monotone map $u: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all joins. Since any monotone map between chains preserves all existing joins, any such map could potentially be a left adjoint. However, for its right adjoint $f$ to be well-defined for all elements in $[n]$, a specific condition must be met. The right adjoint is given by the formula $f(j) = \\max\\{i \\in [m] \\mid u(i) \\le j\\}$. For this maximum to be well-defined for all $j \\in [n]$, the set must be non-empty for all $j$. This implies that for $j=0$, there must be an $i$ such that $u(i) \\le 0$. Since $u$ is order-preserving, this means $u(0)=0$.\n\nConversely, any order-preserving map $u: [m] \\to [n]$ with $u(0)=0$ has a unique right adjoint. Therefore, the number of adjunctions is equal to the number of order-preserving maps $u: \\to$ satisfying $u(0)=0$.\n\nSuch a map is defined by a sequence of values $u(0), u(1), \\dots, u(23)$ such that:\n$u(0) \\le u(1) \\le \\dots \\le u(23)$\nThe values are in the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. With the condition $u(0)=0$, we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences:\n$0 = u(0) \\le u(1) \\le \\dots \\le u(23) \\le 37$\n\nSince $u(0)$ is fixed, we need to choose the 23 values for $u(1), \\dots, u(23)$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ (which contains 38 elements) with replacement, and the order is determined by the non-decreasing condition. This is a classic stars-and-bars problem. The number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $n$ with replacement is given by the multiset coefficient $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$.\n\nHere, $k=23$ (the number of values to choose) and $n=38$ (the number of available options, 0 to 37). The number of such maps is:\n$\\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$\n\nCalculating this value gives:\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!(60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!} = 23,385,332,420,868,600$\n\n"
