    "The maximum number of colors needed to properly color the vertices of a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices, which is not a complete graph, is determined by Brooks's Theorem.\n\nAccording to Brooks's Theorem, the chromatic number of a connected graph $G$, denoted $\\chi(G)$, is at most its maximum degree, $\\Delta(G)$, unless $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle. If $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is $\\Delta(G) + 1$.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph $G$:\n*   It has $n = 12345$ vertices.\n*   It is not a complete graph. A complete graph with $n$ vertices, $K_n$, requires $n$ colors.\n*   The maximum degree, $\\Delta(G)$, of any graph with $n$ vertices is at most $n-1$. Therefore, for this graph, $\\Delta(G) \\leq 12344$.\n\nApplying Brooks's Theorem:\nIf the graph $G$ is connected, we consider two cases:\n1.  **G is an odd cycle:** An odd cycle with 12345 vertices would have a maximum degree $\\Delta(G) = 2$. According to Brooks's Theorem, its chromatic number would be $\\chi(G) = \\Delta(G) + 1 = 3$. This is a very small number of colors.\n2.  **G is not an odd cycle:** Since the graph is also not a complete graph, Brooks's Theorem directly applies, stating that $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$.\n\nGiven that $\\Delta(G) \\le 12344$, it follows that $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$. This establishes an upper bound for the number of colors. If the graph is not connected, its chromatic number is the maximum chromatic number of its connected components, and the same logic applies to each component, yielding the same upper bound.\n\nTo determine the maximum number of colors, we must check if this upper bound can be achieved. Consider the graph constructed by taking a complete graph with 12345 vertices, $K_{12345}$, and removing a single edge.\n*   This graph is not a complete graph.\n*   The maximum degree of this graph is $12344$.\n*   This graph contains a clique of size 12344 (a subgraph that is a complete graph on 12344 vertices). A clique of size $k$ requires $k$ colors for a proper coloring.\n*   Therefore, the chromatic number of this specific graph is at least 12344.\n\nSince we have shown that for any non-complete graph with 12345 vertices the chromatic number is at most 12344, and we have found a specific graph that requires exactly 12344 colors, the maximum number of colors required is 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
