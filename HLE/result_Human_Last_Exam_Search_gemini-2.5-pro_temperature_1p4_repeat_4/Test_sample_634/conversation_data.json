    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s;\n-s^2 - 1, s^2]\nand\nP2 = [s, 0;\n-s - 1, 1]\n\nWe can use the Euclidean algorithm on a stacked matrix formed by P1 and P2. Let's denote the rows of the matrices as R11, R12 for P1 and R21, R22 for P2.\n\nThe stacked matrix M is:\nM = [R11; R12; R21; R22] =\n[s^2 + s,  -s]\n[-s^2 - 1,  s^2]\n[s,        0]\n[-s - 1,   1]\n\nOur goal is to reduce this matrix using elementary row operations, which correspond to pre-multiplication by unimodular matrices. The resulting non-zero rows will form a basis for the GCRD.\n\nLet's denote the rows of M as r1, r2, r3, r4.\nr1 = [s^2 + s,  -s]\nr2 = [-s^2 - 1,  s^2]\nr3 = [s,        0]\nr4 = [-s - 1,   1]\n\nWe perform the following row operations:\n1.  Replace r1 with r1 - (s+1)r3:\n    r1' = [s^2 + s - s(s+1), -s - 0] = [0, -s]\n2.  Replace r2 with r2 + s*r3:\n    r2' = [-s^2 - 1 + s^2, s^2] = [-1, s^2]\n3.  Replace r4 with r4 + r3:\n    r4' = [-s - 1 + s, 1 + 0] = [-1, 1]\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n[0,      -s]\n[-1,     s^2]\n[s,      0]\n[-1,     1]\n\nLet's now use the new fourth row, r4' = [-1, 1], to simplify the matrix further. Let's call the current rows q1, q2, q3, q4.\nq1 = [0, -s]\nq2 = [-1, s^2]\nq3 = [s, 0]\nq4 = [-1, 1]\n\n1.  Replace q2 with q2 - q4:\n    q2' = [-1 - (-1), s^2 - 1] = [0, s^2 - 1]\n2.  Replace q3 with q3 + s*q4:\n    q3' = [s + s(-1), 0 + s(1)] = [0, s]\n\nThe matrix is now:\n[0,   -s]\n[0,   s^2 - 1]\n[0,   s]\n[-1,  1]\n\nLet the current rows be h1, h2, h3, h4.\nh1 = [0, -s]\nh2 = [0, s^2 - 1]\nh3 = [0, s]\nh4 = [-1, 1]\n\n1.  Replace h1 with h1 + h3:\n    h1' = [0 + 0, -s + s] =\n2.  Replace h2 with h2 - (s-1)h3 is not a valid elementary operation as s-1 is not a polynomial. Let's use h3 to simplify h2. Replace h2 with h2 - s*h3:\n    h2' = [0, s^2 - 1 - s*s] = [0, -1]\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n[0,   0]\n[0,  -1]\n[0,   s]\n[-1,  1]\n\nFinally, let the rows be k1, k2, k3, k4.\nk1 =\nk2 = [0, -1]\nk3 = [0, s]\nk4 = [-1, 1]\n\n1.  Replace k3 with k3 + s*k2:\n    k3' = [0 + s*0, s + s*(-1)] =\n2.  Replace k4 with k4 + k2:\n    k4' = [-1 + 0, 1 + (-1)] = [-1, 0]\n\nThe matrix reduces to:\n\n[0,-1]\n\n[-1,0]\n\nThe non-zero rows form the GCRD. We can write them as a matrix:\nG = [-1, 0;\n      0, -1]\n\nThis matrix is a greatest common right divisor. The GCRD is unique only up to pre-multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant non-zero determinant). The determinant of G is (-1)(-1) - (0)(0) = 1, which is a non-zero constant, so G is unimodular.\n\nA simpler, equivalent GCRD can be found by multiplying G by another unimodular matrix. For instance, multiplying by G itself (or by -I):\n[-1, 0; 0, -1] * [-1, 0; 0, -1] = [1, 0; 0, 1] = I\n\nThe identity matrix I is also a unimodular matrix and is a valid GCRD. When the GCRD is a unimodular matrix (like the identity matrix), the original matrices are said to be right coprime.\n\n<<<[1, 0; 0, 1]>>>"
