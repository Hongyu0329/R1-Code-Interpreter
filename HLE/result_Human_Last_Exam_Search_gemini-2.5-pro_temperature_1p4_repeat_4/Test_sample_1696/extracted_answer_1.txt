We have shown that $P(1)=1$, $P(2)=\sqrt{\pi}$, $P(3)=2\pi^{3/2}/\sqrt{3}$, and $P(4)=2\sqrt{2}\pi^3/\sqrt{3}$. These values do not suggest a simple closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions of $n$. The detailed analysis indicates that the expression is a product of complex values derived from the Gamma function, and such products are not typically known to simplify. Therefore, there is no simple closed-form formula for $P(n)$.
