    "I have found the Whitehead integral formula for the Hopf charge, which is a key component of the user's request. The formula is given as H = - (1 / (16 * pi^2)) * integral(F * A dV), where F is the emergent magnetic field (or more generally, the curl of the vector potential A). The vector field is given by (nx, ny, nz), which in the context of magnetism, represents the magnetization vector field m. Some sources refer to this as the spin vector field S. The emergent magnetic field F is related to the derivatives of this vector field.\n\nThe provided equations for nx, ny, and nz involve trigonometric functions of G and f. I need to understand how F and A in the Whitehead formula relate to the given vector field (nx, ny, nz) and its defining functions. The search results indicate that for a normalized vector field m, the emergent magnetic field F_i is given by epsilon_ijk * m . (dm/dx_j x dm/dx_k). This looks more complex than a simple curl. However, some sources also state F = curl(A), where A is a gauge potential. I need to clarify the exact expression for F and A in terms of the given (nx, ny, nz).\n\nI also found that the Hopf charge can be an integer and represents a linking number. For some specific configurations, the Hopf charge is calculated to be the product of two integers, n and m, which characterize the winding of the vector field. In the user's problem, the functions f and G might correspond to these winding numbers.\n\nTo proceed, I need to find the explicit relationship between the vector field (nx, ny, nz) and the fields F and A in the Whitehead formula. I will then need to see how the specific functional forms of f, r2, and G simplify the calculation of the Hopf charge. It is possible that for this particular field, the calculation simplifies to a product of integers.I have gathered substantial information about the Whitehead formula for the Hopf charge and its application to vector fields. The formula is H = - (1 / (4 * pi)^2) * integral( B . A dV), where B is the \"emergent magnetic field\" and A is the corresponding vector potential (B = curl A). For a normalized vector field n, the components of B are given by B_i = (1/8pi) * epsilon_ijk * n . (d_j n x d_k n). Some sources use slightly different normalization factors, but the core expression remains the same.\n\nCrucially, some sources point out that for a vector field parameterized by two angles, say Theta(r) and Phi(r), the Hopf charge can sometimes be calculated as the product of two integer winding numbers, H = n*m. The user's problem defines the vector field (nx, ny, nz) in terms of spherical-like coordinates G and f. It seems highly probable that the structure of the given vector field is designed to fall into this simplified case.\n\nThe angle `f = atan2(y, x)` corresponds to the azimuthal angle in cylindrical or spherical coordinates, which typically relates to the winding number 'n' around the z-axis. The function `G` depends on `r2`, which is a measure of the distance from a circle of radius sqrt(0.5) in the z=0 plane. This structure is characteristic of a hopfion, where the vector field twists around a central ring. The form `nz = cos(G)` and `nx, ny` involving `sin(G)` is a standard spherical parameterization where G acts as a polar angle.\n\nGiven this, I will hypothesize that the Hopf charge is the product of the winding numbers associated with the angles f and G. The winding number for f, which covers a full 2*pi range, is likely 1. I need to determine the winding associated with G. The function `G = PI*(exp(-10*r2))` will vary from PI to 0 as r2 goes from 0 to infinity. In the context of hopfions, this change in the polar angle G often corresponds to a winding number of 1.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with the assumption that the Hopf charge can be determined as the product of the winding numbers of the two angles parameterizing the vector field. Based on the provided equations, it seems these winding numbers are 1 and 1. I believe I have sufficient information to calculate the answer without further searches.\n\nThe Hopf charge, a topological invariant, can be determined for the given three-dimensional vector field (nx, ny, nz) using the Whitehead integral formula. This formula relates the Hopf charge to the integral of the dot product of an emergent magnetic field and its vector potential. However, for vector fields with a specific toroidal structure, the calculation can often be simplified.\n\nThe provided vector field is defined as:\n*   `f = atan2(y,x)`\n*   `r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)*(x*x+y*y-0.5)+z*z)`\n*   `G = PI*(exp(-10*r2))`\n*   `nx = sin(G)*cos(f)`\n*   `ny = sin(G)*sin(f)`\n*   `nz = cos(G)`\n\nThis represents a normalized vector field, where `G` and `f` act as spherical coordinates on a unit sphere, with `G` as the polar angle and `f` as the azimuthal angle. The structure of this field is that of a hopfion, a topological soliton where the spin texture is twisted in a specific way.\n\nFor such configurations, the Hopf charge can be determined by the product of two winding numbers, typically denoted as *n* and *m*. These integers correspond to the number of times the vector field wraps around the target sphere as one traverses the spatial coordinates.\n\nThe angle `f = atan2(y,x)` is the standard azimuthal angle in cylindrical coordinates. As one circuits the z-axis, `f` covers a range of 2π, which corresponds to a winding number of `n = 1`.\n\nThe function `G` determines the polar angle of the vector field. It is a function of `r2`, which measures the distance from a central ring of radius `sqrt(0.5)` in the z=0 plane. At the core of this ring (`r2 = 0`), `G = PI`. As one moves far away from the ring (`r2` -> ∞), `G` approaches 0. This full sweep of the polar angle from π to 0 corresponds to a poloidal winding number of `m = 1`.\n\nTherefore, the Hopf charge `H` is the product of these two winding numbers.\n\nH = n * m = 1 * 1 = 1\n\n<<<1>>>"
