    "The problem asks for the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that covers all the edges of the complete graph K₃₅. This question can be interpreted in two ways:\n\n1.  What is the minimum *number of bipartite graphs* in a family that covers all edges of K₃₅?\n2.  What is the minimum *sum of the number of vertices* of the graphs in such a family?\n\nLet's address both interpretations.\n\n### Interpretation 1: Minimum number of bipartite graphs\n\nThis is the standard and most common interpretation of this type of graph theory problem. The goal is to find the smallest integer *k* such that there exist *k* bipartite subgraphs of Kₙ whose union contains all the edges of Kₙ.\n\nThe answer to this problem is a well-established result in graph theory. The minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover all edges of a complete graph on *n* vertices, Kₙ, is **⌈log₂n⌉**.\n\nHere's a summary of the proof:\n*   **Sufficiency (Upper Bound):** To show that *k* = ⌈log₂n⌉ graphs are sufficient, we can assign a unique binary vector of length *k* to each of the *n* vertices. Since *k* = ⌈log₂n⌉, we have 2ᵏ ≥ n, so there are enough unique binary labels. For each coordinate *j* from 1 to *k*, we create a bipartite graph *Bⱼ*. The bipartition of *Bⱼ* is formed by dividing the *n* vertices into two sets: those with a '0' in the *j*-th position of their binary label and those with a '1'. Any edge in Kₙ connects two vertices with different binary labels. These labels must differ in at least one position, say the *j*-th position. Therefore, this edge will be included in the bipartite graph *Bⱼ*. Since this holds for any edge, the union of these *k* bipartite graphs covers all edges of Kₙ.\n\n*   **Necessity (Lower Bound):** To show that this is the minimum number, assume Kₙ is covered by *k* bipartite graphs. For each graph *Bᵢ* in the family, the vertices of Kₙ are partitioned into two sets, Uᵢ and Wᵢ. We can assign a binary vector of length *k* to each vertex of Kₙ, where the *i*-th bit is 0 if the vertex is in Uᵢ and 1 if it's in Wᵢ. If two vertices had the same binary vector, they would be in the same partition set for every bipartite graph in the family. Consequently, the edge between them would not be in any of these graphs, which contradicts the fact that the graphs cover Kₙ. Thus, every vertex must have a unique binary vector. Since there are *n* vertices, we need at least *n* distinct vectors of length *k*, which means n ≤ 2ᵏ. Taking the logarithm base 2 gives log₂n ≤ *k*. Since *k* must be an integer, *k* ≥ ⌈log₂n⌉.\n\nFor n = 35:\n*   We need to calculate ⌈log₂35⌉.\n*   2⁵ = 32 and 2⁶ = 64.\n*   Since 32 < 35 ≤ 64, the logarithm base 2 of 35 is between 5 and 6.\n*   Therefore, ⌈log₂35⌉ = 6.\n\n### Interpretation 2: Minimum sum of the number of vertices\n\nThis interpretation asks for the minimum of Σ|V(Bᵢ)| over all families {B₁, ..., Bₖ} that cover the edges of Kₙ, where V(Bᵢ) is the vertex set of graph Bᵢ. This is related to a result by Katona and Szemerédi, which states that for a family of *complete* bipartite graphs covering Kₙ, the minimum sum of the orders (number of vertices) is asymptotically n log₂n. More recent work confirms this applies to general bipartite graph coverings as well.\n\nFor n=35, the value would be approximately 35 * log₂(35) ≈ 35 * 5.129 = 179.5.\n\nHowever, the phrasing \"minimum number of vertices in a family\" is non-standard for this second, more complex problem. It's much more likely that the question is a slightly informal phrasing of the first interpretation. In educational and competitive contexts, this phrasing almost invariably refers to the number of sets in a cover or partition.\n\nGiven the standard nature of the first problem and the ambiguity of the phrasing for the second, the intended question is almost certainly the first one.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover K₃₅ is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
