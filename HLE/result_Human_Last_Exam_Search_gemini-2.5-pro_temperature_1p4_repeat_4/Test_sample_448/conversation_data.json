    "Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002.\n\nThe noble gases, found in Group 18 of the periodic table, are helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon. Of these naturally occurring elements, radon is the rarest. Argon is the most abundant noble gas, making up about 0.934% of the Earth's atmosphere. The abundances of the other noble gases in the atmosphere are significantly lower, with neon at approximately 0.0018%, krypton at 0.00011%, and xenon at about 0.0000087%.\n\nWhile xenon is exceedingly rare, radon is even less abundant due to its radioactive nature. Radon's most stable isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days. This rapid decay means that it exists in only minute quantities at any given time, making it one of the rarest elements on the planet.\n\nRadon is continuously generated in the Earth's crust through the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium. Despite its constant production, its concentration in the Earth's crust is exceptionally low, estimated at 4 x 10⁻¹³ milligrams per kilogram. Its atmospheric concentration is also extremely low and variable.\n\nThe year 2002 is noted, as the synthetic element Oganesson, also a member of Group 18, was first synthesized in that year. However, as a synthetic element, it does not occur naturally in terrestrial matter. Therefore, based on natural abundance, radon remains the rarest noble gas.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
