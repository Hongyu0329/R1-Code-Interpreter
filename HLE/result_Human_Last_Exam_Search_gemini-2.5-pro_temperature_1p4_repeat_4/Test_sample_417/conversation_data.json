    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we must analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\n### Molecular Structure Analysis\n\n1.  **Central Core**: The molecule has a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) ring.\n2.  **Substituents**: Three identical groups are attached to the 1, 3, and 5 positions of the benzene ring. Each group consists of a methylene bridge (`-CH₂-`) attached to a complex, chiral substituent.\n3.  **Chiral Ligand**: The substituent is `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazole`. This is a rigid, chiral, bicyclic system derived from camphor. The specific stereochemistry (4S,7R) indicates that a single enantiomer is present.\n\n### Symmetry Considerations\n\nThe molecule possesses a C₃ rotational axis of symmetry that passes through the center of the benzene ring. This symmetry makes the three large substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5 chemically equivalent. It also makes the three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 equivalent.\n\nBecause of this symmetry, we only need to count the number of chemically distinct protons on the central ring and in one of the three identical arms.\n\n### Counting the Chemically Distinct Protons\n\nWe will count the number of unique proton signals by examining each part of a single repeating unit.\n\n1.  **Central 2,4,6-Trimethylbenzene Core**:\n    *   The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the C₃ symmetry. Their nine protons will produce a single peak in the NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Peak Count: 1**\n\n2.  **Methylene (`-CH₂-`) Linker**:\n    *   This `-CH₂-` group is bonded to the benzene ring and the nitrogen of the chiral indazole ligand.\n    *   Because the methylene group is adjacent to a chiral center (the entire indazole moiety), its two protons are diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will resonate at different chemical shifts, thus producing two separate signals.\n    *   **Peak Count: 2**\n\n3.  **The `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazole` Ligand**:\n    This rigid, bicyclic camphor derivative lacks any internal symmetry that would make its protons equivalent. We need to count each unique proton environment. The structure is essentially a pyrazole ring fused to a camphor skeleton.\n    *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton**: There is one proton on the pyrazole ring (at position 3). This gives one unique signal.\n    *   **Bridgehead Proton**: There is one proton at the bridgehead position (C4). This is a unique environment.\n    *   **Methylene Groups (C5 and C6)**: The camphor skeleton has two methylene groups. In this rigid, chiral structure, the two protons of the C5-methylene group are non-equivalent (diastereotopic), as are the two protons of the C6-methylene group. This results in four distinct signals.\n    *   **Methyl Groups (C7 and C8)**: There are three methyl groups. One is at the C7 bridgehead. The other two are geminal (on the same carbon, C8). Because of the rigid and asymmetric environment of the camphor skeleton, these three methyl groups are all chemically distinct. The two geminal methyls at C8 are diastereotopic. The 1H NMR spectra of camphor and its derivatives consistently show separate signals for these methyl groups.\n    *   **Total for the indazole ligand**:\n        *   1 (H at C3)\n        *   1 (H at C4)\n        *   2 (H's at C5)\n        *   2 (H's at C6)\n        *   1 (CH₃ at C7)\n        *   2 (CH₃'s at C8)\n    *   **Peak Count: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9**\n\n### Total Peak Calculation\n\nSumming the peaks from each distinct part of the molecule:\n*   From the central ring's methyl groups: 1 peak\n*   From the linking methylene groups: 2 peaks\n*   From one indazole ligand: 9 peaks\n\nTotal Expected Peaks = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12\n\n<<<H>>>"
