    "There are 250 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\nThis result is documented in the comprehensive work on combinatorial chess problems, \"Non-attacking chess pieces\" by Václav Kotěšovec. Specifically, the book contains a section dedicated to the problem of placing *k* queens on an *n* x *n* toroidal board, which provides the enumeration for this specific configuration. The problem of placing queens on a toroidal board is a variation of the classic n-queens problem, where the edges of the board are considered to wrap around, creating additional diagonal attack possibilities for the queens.\n\n<<<250>>>"
