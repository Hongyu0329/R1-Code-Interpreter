    "When a standard origami crane is unfolded, the intricate network of creases divides the square paper into a surprisingly large number of regions. The process of folding and unfolding creates a complex geometric pattern.\n\nBy carefully examining the complete crease pattern of a traditional origami crane, it has been determined that the paper is divided into 158 separate regions. This pattern is the result of a sequence of folds that includes creating a preliminary base (or square base), followed by a bird base, and then the final shaping folds that form the head, tail, and wings of the crane. Each of these steps contributes to the final network of creases. The bird base itself, a common starting point for many origami figures, already introduces a significant number of these lines and resulting areas.\n\nIt is worth noting that some complex origami models have crease patterns that are intentionally designed and can be even more elaborate. However, for the classic and widely recognized origami crane, the specific set of traditional folds consistently produces this number of regions.\n\n<<<158>>>"
