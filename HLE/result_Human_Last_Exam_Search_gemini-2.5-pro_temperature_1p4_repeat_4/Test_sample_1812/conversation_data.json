    "The determinant of the given matrix is 0.\n\nTo find the determinant of the matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nwe can use the formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\ndet(A) = 2 * (2 * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) - (-1) * ((-1) * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) + (-1) * ((-1) * (-1) - 2 * (-1))\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * 3 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6 = 0\n\nAlternatively, we can observe that the sum of the elements in each row is 0. For example, in the first row, 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0. When the sum of the rows of a matrix is zero, it means the vector (1, 1, 1) is an eigenvector of the matrix with an eigenvalue of 0. A matrix having an eigenvalue of 0 implies that its determinant is 0.\n\nThe reference to the Markov quiver and \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) provides context related to cluster algebras and Diophantine equations, but it is not necessary for the calculation of the determinant of the explicitly provided matrix.\n\n<<<0>>>"
