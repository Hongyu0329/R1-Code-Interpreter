    "The best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8, which corresponds to the affine space AG(8,3) or $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^8$, can be determined using known values for smaller dimensions and established construction methods.\n\nA cap set is a collection of points in which no three points are collinear. The size of the largest cap set in $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$ is denoted by $a(n)$. The exact values are only known for $n \\le 6$. The known values are:\n*   $a(1) = 2$\n*   $a(2) = 4$\n*   $a(3) = 9$\n*   $a(4) = 20$\n*   $a(5) = 45$\n*   $a(6) = 112$\n\nFor higher dimensions, lower bounds can be established using construction methods.\n\n### Product Construction\nA simple method is the product construction. If there is a cap of size $|A|$ in dimension $n_1$ and a cap of size $|B|$ in dimension $n_2$, then their Cartesian product is a cap of size $|A| \\times |B|$ in dimension $n_1+n_2$. To find a lower bound for dimension 8, we can combine known values:\n*   $a(2) \\times a(6) = 4 \\times 112 = 448$\n*   $a(3) \\times a(5) = 9 \\times 45 = 405$\n*   $a(4) \\times a(4) = 20 \\times 20 = 400$\n\nThe best known lower bound for the size of a cap in dimension 7, $a(7)$, is 236. Using this, we can also calculate:\n*   $a(1) \\times a(7) \\ge 2 \\times 236 = 472$\n\nSo, the product construction gives a lower bound of at least 472.\n\n### Doubling Construction\nA more advanced method is the \"doubling construction\" (also known as the concatenation construction). This method states that if there is a cap of size $m$ in the projective space PG(n-1,q), then a cap of size $2m$ can be constructed in the affine space AG(n,q).\n\nFor dimension 8 (where n=8), we can use a known cap from the projective space PG(7,3). The largest known cap in PG(7,3) has a size of 248. Applying the doubling construction:\n*   Lower bound for AG(8,3) = $2 \\times (\\text{size of largest known cap in PG(7,3)})$\n*   Lower bound for AG(8,3) = $2 \\times 248 = 496$\n\nThis constructed lower bound of 496 is better than the one obtained by the simple product construction (472). Comparing this result to the given answer choices, 496 is the highest and most accurate known lower bound provided.\n\n<<<F>>>"
