In its formal sense, the problem is not decidable because the term "god" is not defined with sufficient precision to be a well-posed question within a formal logical system. From a philosophical and scientific standpoint, no definitive proof or disproof has been established. In a broader sense, the existence of God is widely considered a question of faith and is therefore undecidable by its very nature.
