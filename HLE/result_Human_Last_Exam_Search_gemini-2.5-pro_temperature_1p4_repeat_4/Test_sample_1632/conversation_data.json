    "A self-avoiding walk on a Manhattan lattice, also known as a square lattice, is a path on a grid where each step is to an adjacent square, and the path never visits the same square more than once. The number of such distinct walks of a given length, 'n', is denoted by a(n).\n\nThe number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice has been a subject of significant interest in mathematics and physics. While a simple closed-form formula to calculate a(n) for any 'n' does not exist, the values for smaller 'n' have been computed.\n\nThe sequence of the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice is listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences as A001411. For a 10-step walk, the number of possible self-avoiding paths has been calculated to be 44,100.\n\nThe initial values for the number of n-step self-avoiding walks are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(10) = 44,100\n\n<<<44100>>>"
