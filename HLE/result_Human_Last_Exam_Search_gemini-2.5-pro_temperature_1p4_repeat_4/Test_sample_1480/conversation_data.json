    "In the context of a fuzzy logic system, the activation level of a rule is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the rule's antecedent and the membership function of the consequent. The antecedent firing strength is given by `Φ_k(x′)=0.7`, and the consequent membership degree is `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n\nA t-norm, or triangular norm, is a function that generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation in fuzzy logic. The specific t-norm to be used is often a design choice for the fuzzy system. The two most common t-norms are the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm.\n\nThe calculation for the rule activation level using these t-norms is as follows:\n\n*   **Using the Minimum t-norm:** This is also known as the Gödel t-norm. The formula is T(a, b) = min(a, b).\n    *   Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n*   **Using the Product t-norm:** The formula is T(a, b) = a * b.\n    *   Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\nWithout a specified t-norm, the rule activation level will depend on the chosen operation. Based on the most common t-norms, the value would be **0.7** (for minimum) or **0.63** (for product).\n\n<<<The rule activation level is calculated by applying the specified t-norm operation to the antecedent firing strength (0.7) and the consequent membership value (0.9). Since a specific t-norm was not mentioned, the results for the most common t-norms are:\n- Using the **minimum t-norm**: min(0.7, 0.9) = **0.7**\n- Using the **product t-norm**: 0.7 * 0.9 = **0.63**>>>"
