The rule activation level is calculated by applying the specified t-norm operation to the antecedent firing strength (0.7) and the consequent membership value (0.9). Since a specific t-norm was not mentioned, the results for the most common t-norms are:
- Using the **minimum t-norm**: min(0.7, 0.9) = **0.7**
- Using the **product t-norm**: 0.7 * 0.9 = **0.63**
