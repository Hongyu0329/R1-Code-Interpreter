The optimal Spreading Factor will be the lowest possible value (from SF7 to SF12) that allows for a reliable connection, and the optimal Transmission Power will be the lowest level (from 2 dBm to 14 dBm) that maintains a Packet Error Rate below 1% for that selected Spreading Factor, as determined by the Adaptive Data Rate algorithm.
