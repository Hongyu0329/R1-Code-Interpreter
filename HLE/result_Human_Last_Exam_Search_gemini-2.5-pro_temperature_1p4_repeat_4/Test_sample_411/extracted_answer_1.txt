(a) The diversity orders for the codes are as follows:
*   $\mathbf{S}_a$: Diversity order 1.
*   $\mathbf{S}_b$: Diversity order 1.
*   $\mathbf{S}_c$: Diversity order 2.

(b) Code $\mathbf{S}_c$ provides the maximum directivity. In the context of space-time codes, where the primary goal is to achieve diversity, "maximum directivity" is best interpreted as achieving the best performance. Code $\mathbf{S}_c$ is the only one to achieve the full diversity order of 2, and as an orthogonal design, it provides superior performance over codes $\mathbf{S}_a$ and $\mathbf{S}_b$.
