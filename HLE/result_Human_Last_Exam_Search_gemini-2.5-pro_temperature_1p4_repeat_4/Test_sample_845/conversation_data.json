    "The value computed between heartbeats, derived from beat-to-beat intervals, is called the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**.\n\nHeart Rate Variability (HRV) is the physiological phenomenon of the variation in the time of these Inter-beat Intervals. In other words, HRV is a measurement of how much the time between consecutive heartbeats is constantly changing.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown:\n*   **Inter-beat Interval (IBI):** This is the time, usually measured in milliseconds, between two consecutive heartbeats. It is also referred to as the beat-to-beat interval.\n*   **Source of Measurement:**\n    *   When using an electrocardiogram (ECG), the IBI is specifically called an **R-R interval**. This measures the time between the peaks of two consecutive R-waves in the QRS complex, which represents the electrical signal of a heartbeat.\n    *   When using photoplethysmography (PPG), as mentioned in the question, the device detects the pulse wave created by blood flow. The interval between consecutive pulse wave peaks is measured. This is often called a **peak-to-peak interval (PPI)**, but it serves as an estimate of the R-R interval and is still fundamentally referred to as the IBI.\n*   **HRV Analysis:** HRV is not a single value between two beats, but rather the analysis of the variability of a series of IBIs over time. Time-domain HRV metrics like SDNN (the standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals) and RMSSD (the root mean square of successive differences) are calculated from these IBI values.\n\nIn summary, while HRV is the analysis of the *variation*, the specific value measured between each beat is the Inter-beat Interval (IBI).\n\n<<<Inter-beat Interval (IBI)>>>"
