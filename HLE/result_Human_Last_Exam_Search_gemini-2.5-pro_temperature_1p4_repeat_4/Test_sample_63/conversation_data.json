    "Kurt Vonnegut expressed his disdain for the musician and poet Bob Dylan. In a 1991 interview, Vonnegut called him \"the worst poet alive\". While the specific quote describing him as looking like a porcupine is not widely documented in available online sources, Dylan's well-known wild hair in many photographs has led to the association with Vonnegut's purported description. This, combined with the fact that the two words of his name begin with the same letter, points to him being the subject of the user's question.\n\n<<<Bob Dylan>>>"
