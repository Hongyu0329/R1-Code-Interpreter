    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine ballet methods lies in the placement of the hips. This difference stems from the foundational principles of each technique regarding body alignment and line.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and aligned torso. This means that during a cambré derrière, the dancer strives to keep both hips level and facing forward as much as possible, even as the upper back arches. The movement should originate from the upper and middle spine, creating a graceful curve without sacrificing the stability and squareness of the hips. This technique fosters a sense of elegant control and purity of line.\n\nThe Balanchine method, on the other hand, allows for a more dynamic and open approach to create longer and more dramatic lines. A defining characteristic of the Balanchine style is the allowance of the hip of the working leg to lift and open in movements like an arabesque. This principle extends to the cambré derrière, where the hip is often considered an extension of the leg. This opening of the hip can create the illusion of a higher leg and a more extreme backbend.\n\nWhile other differences exist between the two methods, such as arm placement (port de bras), speed of movement, and head position, the fundamental difference in the execution of a cambré derrière is rooted in the hip placement. The Vaganova method prioritizes a stable, square foundation, while the Balanchine method allows for a departure from this squareness to achieve its signature dynamic and elongated aesthetic.\n\n<<<B>>>"
