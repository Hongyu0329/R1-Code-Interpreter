    "When applying cellular automaton Rule 110 starting from a single cell in state 1 (a \"black\" cell) and evolving for 20 iterations, the resulting binary pattern is **111111001111010001**.\n\nRule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton where the state of a cell (either 0 or 1) in the next generation is determined by its current state and the state of its two immediate neighbors. The rule's name, 110, comes from the binary sequence `01101110`, which defines the output for each of the eight possible neighborhood patterns.\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n\n| Current Neighborhood | New State for Center Cell |\n|:--------------------:|:-------------------------:|\n|         111          |             0             |\n|         110          |             1             |\n|         101          |             1             |\n|         100          |             0             |\n|         011          |             1             |\n|         010          |             1             |\n|         001          |             1             |\n|         000          |             0             |\n\nStarting with an initial state of a single '1' surrounded by '0's, the system evolves step-by-step. Each new line is generated by applying these rules simultaneously to every cell in the previous line. The evolution of the pattern for the first few steps is as follows, with leading and trailing zeros omitted for clarity:\n*   **Step 0:** 1\n*   **Step 1:** 11\n*   **Step 2:** 111\n*   **Step 3:** 1101\n*   **Step 4:** 11111\n*   **Step 5:** 110001\n\nThis process continues, and after 20 applications of the rule, the specific binary pattern emerges.\n\n<<<111111001111010001>>>"
