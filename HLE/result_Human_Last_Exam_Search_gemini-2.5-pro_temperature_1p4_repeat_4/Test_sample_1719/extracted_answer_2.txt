The homotopy-theoretic obstructions are elements of a group which is an extension of $\pi_1(SO(2k))$ by $[X, \Omega SO(2k)]$. The list of groups that constitute the potential obstructions is:
*   $H^{n-1}(X; \pi_n(SO(2k)))$
*   $H^{n}(X; \pi_{n+1}(SO(2k)))$
*   ...
*   $H^{n-1+j}(X; \pi_{n+j}(SO(2k)))$ for $j \ge 0$
*   $\pi_1(SO(2k))$
