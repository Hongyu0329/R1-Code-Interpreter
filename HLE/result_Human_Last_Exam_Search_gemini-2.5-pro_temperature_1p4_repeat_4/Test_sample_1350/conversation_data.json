    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, it is an unnamed warrior of the Wolfing tribe who describes visiting a Roman city and recounts their religious practices in a manner that clearly alludes to the legend of Romulus and Remus.\n\nThis warrior, who had spent time among the Romans as a hostage, addresses the Wolfing assembly at their Thing-stead (a governing council). He speaks of a Roman city he witnessed, describing its impressive stone and lime walls and the great houses within. Central to his account is his description of a Roman temple where he saw an image of a \"she-wolf mothering two man-children.\"\n\nThis imagery is a direct reference to the foundation myth of Rome, in which the twin brothers Romulus and Remus, abandoned as infants, were said to have been suckled and cared for by a she-wolf. The Wolfing warrior's description serves to highlight the cultural and religious differences between the Germanic tribes and the Roman Empire they are preparing to battle.\n\n<<<An unnamed Wolfing warrior>>>"
