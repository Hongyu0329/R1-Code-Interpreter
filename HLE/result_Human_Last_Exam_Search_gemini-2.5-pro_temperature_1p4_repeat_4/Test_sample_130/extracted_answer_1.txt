As the local median function is iteratively applied to a binary image, the edges will evolve according to a process known as motion by mean curvature. This means that sharp corners will be rounded, and the boundaries of the black and white regions will become progressively smoother. Over an infinite number of iterations ($t \rightarrow \infty$), any isolated or non-convex features will be eliminated, and the shapes will tend to become circular and shrink, eventually disappearing. The overall effect is a simplification and rounding of the image's edges.
