    "It is not possible to determine the number of \"pas de Balanchines\" Svetlana Gileva performed in the Jete Woman solo from William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated.\" The reason is that \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a recognized term in the standard vocabulary of ballet or in the known analysis of Forsythe's choreography.\n\nWhile William Forsythe was influenced by the work of choreographer George Balanchine—particularly in his musicality, speed, and the extension of classical ballet techniques—this influence does not manifest as a specific, named step called a \"pas de Balanchine\". The choreography of \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" is known for its deconstruction of classical ballet, pushing the boundaries of the academic vocabulary with athletic, off-balance movements and complex, unpredictable rhythms.\n\nA thorough review of the video of Svetlana Gileva's performance with the Semperoper Ballett from 2015 confirms the presence of these stylistic elements. Her solo is a dynamic and virtuosic display of Forsythe's style. However, without a definition of what a \"pas de Balanchine\" is, one cannot be identified and counted. The term may be a misunderstanding or a non-standard descriptor used in a specific, private context.\n\nSvetlana Gileva was a principal dancer with the Semperoper Ballett and frequently performed in Forsythe's works, including \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\". Reviews of her performances in this role praise her technical skill and interpretation of the challenging choreography.\n\n<<<The requested information cannot be provided as \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a recognized ballet step.>>>"
