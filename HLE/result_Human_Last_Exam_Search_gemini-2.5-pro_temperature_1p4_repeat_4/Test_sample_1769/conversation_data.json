    "Without the influence of the Norse invasions, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely have evolved from the Old English word \"sweostor.\" Following the typical patterns of linguistic change from Old English to Modern English, the word would probably be \"**suster**.\"\n\nThe contemporary word \"sister\" originates from a combination of the Old English \"sweostor\" (also found in variations like \"swuster\") and the Old Norse word \"systir\". The introduction of the \"i\" vowel sound in the first syllable is a direct result of the interaction between the Anglo-Saxons and Norse invaders. The Old Norse language had a significant impact on English, contributing many core vocabulary words.\n\nIf we trace the hypothetical development of the purely Old English \"sweostor,\" we can predict its modern form:\n\n*   The \"eo\" diphthong in \"sweostor\" would have likely simplified. One of the existing variants in Old English was \"swuster,\" and this \"u\" sound (as in \"put\") is a plausible path for the word's evolution. In Middle English, the word was commonly written as \"suster\" before the Norse-influenced \"sister\" became dominant.\n*   The initial \"sw\" sound at the beginning of \"sweostor\" would probably have simplified to \"s,\" a common linguistic phenomenon (for example, \"sword\" is pronounced \"sord\").\n*   The unstressed final syllable \"-or\" would have been reduced to a schwa sound, typically represented by \"-er\" in Modern English spelling, similar to how \"brōþor\" became \"brother.\"\n\nConsidering these changes, the Old English \"sweostor\" or \"swuster\" would most plausibly have become \"suster\" in Modern English.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
