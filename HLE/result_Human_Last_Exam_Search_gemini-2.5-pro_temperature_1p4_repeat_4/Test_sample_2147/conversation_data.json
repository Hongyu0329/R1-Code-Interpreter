    "Pavel Milyukov did not denounce a specific aspect of Western culture as a 'stagnant swamp'. The historical record indicates that this particular phrase was used by a different individual in a completely different context.\n\nThe denouncement of a group as a \"stagnant swamp\" was actually made by the Porokhovsky district representative of the Bolshevik party on July 10, 1917, at a meeting of the Petersburg Committee. The representative was not referring to Western culture, but rather to **the workers of his district**.\n\nThis characterization came in the aftermath of the \"July Days\" uprising in Petrograd. Following the failed Bolshevik-led insurrection, the political mood among many workers turned against the party. The Porokhovsky district representative, who himself was one of six Bolsheviks expelled from his factory, used the term \"stagnant swamp\" to describe the workers' political consciousness at that moment. He lamented their reliance on rumors and the mainstream \"boulevard press\" for information, which contributed to their political passivity and opposition to the Bolsheviks.\n\nTherefore, the \"X-Y\" in the user's query refers to **the workers of the Porokhovsky district** in the view of their Bolshevik representative in July 1917.\n\n<<<the workers of the Porokhovsky district>>>"
