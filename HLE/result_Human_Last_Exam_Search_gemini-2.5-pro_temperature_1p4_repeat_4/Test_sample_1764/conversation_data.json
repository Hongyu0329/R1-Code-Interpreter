    "It has been established that for any finite ultrametric space `X` and any infinite-dimensional Banach space `B`, there exists an isometric embedding of `X` into `B`. This guarantees that the number of embeddings is at least 1 when the Banach space is infinite-dimensional.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings, allowing for any choice of a finite ultrametric space `X` and any Banach space `B` of cardinality `K`. A Banach space can be finite-dimensional. For instance, any `n`-dimensional real vector space with a norm, such as `ℝ^n` with the Euclidean norm, is a Banach space. The cardinality of such a space is `K = c` (the cardinality of the continuum) for `n ≥ 1`.\n\nLet's consider the specific case where the number of embeddings could be zero. This would occur if there exists a finite ultrametric space `X` and a Banach space `B` such that no isometric embedding is possible.\n\n1.  **Choose a finite ultrametric space `X`**:\n    Let `X` be a set of four points, `{p₁, p₂, p₃, p₄}`, with the metric `d(pᵢ, pⱼ) = 1` for `i ≠ j` and `d(pᵢ, pᵢ) = 0`. This space is ultrametric because for any three distinct points, the ultrametric inequality `d(pᵢ, pₖ) ≤ max{d(pᵢ, pⱼ), d(pⱼ, pₖ)}` becomes `1 ≤ max{1, 1}`, which is true.\n\n2.  **Choose a Banach space `B`**:\n    Let `B` be the two-dimensional Euclidean space `ℝ²` with the standard Euclidean norm, `||v||₂`. `ℝ²` is a complete normed vector space, and therefore a Banach space. Its cardinality is `K = c`.\n\n3.  **Determine the number of isometric embeddings**:\n    An isometric embedding of `X` into `B = ℝ²` would be a function `f: X → ℝ²` such that `||f(pᵢ) - f(pⱼ)||₂ = d(pᵢ, pⱼ) = 1` for all `i ≠ j`. This means that the images of the four points in `X` must form a set of four points in the Euclidean plane where the distance between any two points is 1. Such a configuration is known as an equilateral tetrahedron with a side length of 1.\n\n    It is a well-established fact in geometry that an equilateral tetrahedron cannot be embedded in a two-dimensional Euclidean space. To demonstrate this, assume three of the points, `f(p₁)`, `f(p₂)`, and `f(p₃)`, are placed in the plane to form an equilateral triangle with side length 1. The fourth point, `f(p₄)`, must be at a distance of 1 from each of these three vertices. The only point in the plane equidistant from the three vertices of an equilateral triangle is its circumcenter. The distance from the circumcenter to any vertex of an equilateral triangle with side length `s` is `s/√3`. For `s=1`, this distance is `1/√3`, which is not equal to 1. Therefore, it is impossible to place the fourth point, and no such isometric embedding exists.\n\nSince there exists a finite ultrametric space `X` and a Banach space `B` for which there are no isometric embeddings, the number of such embeddings is 0. As the number of embeddings cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0. The fact that the four-point space `X` can be embedded in other Banach spaces (for example, `ℝ³` with the Euclidean norm, or `ℝ²` with the `ℓ₁` norm) is irrelevant, as the question asks for the smallest possible number across all valid choices of `X` and `B`.\n\n<<<0>>>"
