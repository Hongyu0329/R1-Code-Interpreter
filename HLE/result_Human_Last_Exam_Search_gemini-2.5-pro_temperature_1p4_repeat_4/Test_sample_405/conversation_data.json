    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in four primary colors: white, red, black, and violet. Other colors are also associated with phosphorus, but they are either due to impurities or describe forms that are not distinct bulk allotropes.\n\nThe distinct colors of the well-established phosphorus allotropes are:\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** In its pure form, white phosphorus is a colorless or white waxy solid. It is often referred to as yellow phosphorus because it tends to develop a yellowish appearance upon exposure to light, which causes a gradual transformation to the more stable red phosphorus. However, \"yellow phosphorus\" is not considered a distinct allotrope.\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This allotrope has a characteristic deep red color. It is an amorphous or crystalline solid that is significantly more stable and less reactive than white phosphorus.\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** As the most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus, black phosphorus is black and flaky with a metallic luster, bearing a resemblance to graphite.\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this crystalline allotrope is violet or purple-red in color. It can be formed by heating red phosphorus to high temperatures.\n\nAdditionally, other terms for colored phosphorus exist, but their classification as distinct, pure allotropes is less clear:\n\n*   **Scarlet Phosphorus:** This form is described as a scarlet-colored powder. However, it is often considered to be a fine or amorphous form of red phosphorus rather than a unique allotrope.\n\n*   **Blue Phosphorus:** This is a more recently synthesized form of phosphorus, primarily existing as a two-dimensional material, often on a substrate like gold. While model calculations predicted its existence and gave it its name, it is not typically observed as a bulk material in the same way as the other four allotropes.\n\nIn summary, based on well-established and observable bulk allotropes, there are four distinct colors.\n\n<<<4>>>"
