The laboratory's mistake in believing the evidence stemmed from a fundamentally flawed Quality Control (QC) process. They incorrectly used a bacterium (*Bacillus subtilis*) to test a medium (PDA with chloramphenicol) that is designed to inhibit bacteria. The primary error, however, was in the preparation of Batch 3, where the heat-sensitive antibiotic chloramphenicol was added *before* autoclaving, which destroyed its antibacterial properties. The flawed QC test failed to detect this inactivation because the expected result (no growth of the test bacterium) was likely observed, leading to the false conclusion that the batch was effective and safe to use.
