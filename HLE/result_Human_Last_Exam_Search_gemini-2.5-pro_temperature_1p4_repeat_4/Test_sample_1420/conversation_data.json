    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat of a system with spatial dimension d=3 is determined using the epsilon (ε) expansion.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n\n1.  **Upper Critical Dimension (d_c)**: For a system with a scalar order parameter, described by φ⁴ theory (like the Ising universality class), the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4. Above this dimension, the critical exponents are given by their mean-field theory values.\n\n2.  **Epsilon (ε)**: The epsilon expansion is a perturbative technique where calculations are performed in d = d_c - ε dimensions, treating ε as a small parameter. For a system with a spatial dimension of d=3, epsilon is:\n    ε = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1\n\n3.  **Epsilon Expansion for α**: The critical exponent α, which describes the divergence of the specific heat at the critical point (C ∼ |T - T_c|⁻ᵃ), can be expressed as a series in ε. To the first order in ε, the relationship is:\n    α = (4-n)ε / (2(n+8))\n    For the Ising model (n=1), this simplifies to:\n    α = ε / 6\n    This result is derived from renormalization group calculations.\n\nBy substituting the value ε=1 for a three-dimensional system into the first-order expansion, we get the value for the scaling exponent α.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
