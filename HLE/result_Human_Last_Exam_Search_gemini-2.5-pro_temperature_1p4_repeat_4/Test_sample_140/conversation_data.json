    "The volume of the cube is 15 x 15 x 15 = 3375 cubic units.\nThe volume of a single block is 9 x 1 x 1 = 9 cubic units.\n\nTheoretically, the maximum number of blocks that could fit is the total volume of the cube divided by the volume of a single block:\n3375 / 9 = 375 blocks.\n\nHowever, we must consider the geometry of packing the blocks. Since the edge length of the cube (15) is not a multiple of the block length (9), it is not possible to achieve a perfect packing with zero wasted space. Therefore, the maximum number of blocks must be less than 375.\n\nA standard method to maximize the number of packed blocks is a greedy approach, where we fill sections of the cube in layers.\n\n1.  First, we can place blocks with their 9-unit length aligned along one of the cube's axes. Let's call this the x-axis. This allows us to completely fill a 9 x 15 x 15 section of the cube. The number of blocks in this section is (9/9) * (15/1) * (15/1) = 225 blocks. After this, a space of 6 x 15 x 15 remains.\n\n2.  Next, we take the remaining 6 x 15 x 15 space. We cannot align the 9-unit length of the blocks along the 6-unit dimension. We must align it with one of the 15-unit dimensions (let's say the y-axis). This fills a 6 x 9 x 15 section of the remaining space. The number of blocks in this section is (6/1) * (9/9) * (15/1) = 90 blocks. The remaining space is now 6 x 6 x 15.\n\n3.  Finally, in the 6 x 6 x 15 space, we align the 9-unit length of the blocks along the remaining 15-unit dimension (the z-axis). This fills a 6 x 6 x 9 section. The number of blocks placed here is (6/1) * (6/1) * (9/9) = 36 blocks.\n\nThis leaves a final remaining space of 6 x 6 x 6. A 9 x 1 x 1 block cannot fit into this space, as its longest side (9) is greater than any dimension of the remaining space (6).\n\nThe total number of blocks that can be fitted is the sum of the blocks from each step:\n225 + 90 + 36 = 351 blocks.\n\n<<<351>>>"
