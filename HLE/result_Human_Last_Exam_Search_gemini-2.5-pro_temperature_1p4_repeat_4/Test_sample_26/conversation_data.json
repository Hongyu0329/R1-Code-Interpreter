    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$, of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can use results from algebraic topology concerning complex hypersurfaces.\n\nThe rank of an abelian group is the cardinality of a maximal linearly independent subset, which is equivalent to the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring the group with the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. Abelian groups that are finite have a rank of 0.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of $\\pi_3(X)$:\n\n1.  **Relative Homotopy Groups**: A crucial result from algebraic topology, by Libgober and Wood, describes the relative homotopy groups of the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^n, V)$, where $V$ is a non-singular hypersurface. For a smooth hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ (so $n=3$), the theorem states that $\\pi_i(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) = 0$ for $i \\leq 3$.\n\n2.  **Long Exact Sequence of a Pair**: We consider the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$. A segment of this sequence is:\n    $\\dots \\to \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\dots$\n\n3.  **Homotopy Groups of Projective Space**: The homotopy groups of complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ are related to those of spheres. For $k > 2$, $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n) \\cong \\pi_k(S^{2n+1})$.\n    *   For our case, $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_3(S^7)$. From standard tables of homotopy groups of spheres, $\\pi_3(S^7) = 0$.\n    *   Similarly, $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_4(S^7) = 0$.\n\n4.  **Simplifying the Exact Sequence**: Substituting the vanishing homotopy groups of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ into the sequence from step 2, we get:\n    $\\dots \\to 0 \\to \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to 0 \\to \\dots$\n    For this sequence to be exact, the map from $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ to $\\pi_3(X)$ must be an isomorphism. Therefore, $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$.\n\n5.  **Relative Hurewicz Theorem**: The problem is now to compute $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$. The relative Hurewicz theorem connects relative homotopy groups to relative homology groups. The theorem states that if a pair $(Y, A)$ is $(n-1)$-connected (meaning $\\pi_i(Y, A) = 0$ for $i < n$) and $\\pi_1(A)$ is trivial, then the Hurewicz homomorphism $h_n: \\pi_n(Y, A) \\to H_n(Y, A; \\mathbb{Z})$ is an isomorphism.\n    *   In our case, $(Y, A) = (\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$. From step 1, the pair is 3-connected ($\\pi_i=0$ for $i \\le 3$).\n    *   By the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$.\n    *   The conditions of the relative Hurewicz theorem are met for $n=4$. Thus, we have an isomorphism $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n6.  **Relative Homology Groups**: We compute the relative homology group $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ using the long exact sequence in homology for the pair:\n    $\\dots \\to H_4(X) \\xrightarrow{i_*} H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to H_3(X) \\to \\dots$\n    *   By PoincarÃ© duality, $H_3(X) \\cong H^1(X)$. Since $\\pi_1(X)=0$, the first homology group $H_1(X)$ is also 0, which in turn implies $H^1(X)=0$. Therefore, $H_3(X)=0$.\n    *   The sequence simplifies to show that $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ is the cokernel of the map $i_*: H_4(X) \\to H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$.\n    *   $H_4(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The map $i_*$ sends the fundamental class of $X$ to $d$ times the generator of $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$, where $d$ is the degree of the hypersurface.\n    *   For a quintic hypersurface, $d=5$. The map is multiplication by 5. The cokernel is $\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: Combining the results, we have:\n    $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is the cyclic group of order 5. Since this is a finite group, its rank is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
