    "In Major League Baseball (MLB), there are two types of Triple Crowns a player can achieve: one for hitting and one for pitching.\n\nThe **hitting Triple Crown** is awarded to a batter who leads their league in three specific statistical categories in a single season: batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs). In the history of MLB, including the recently integrated statistics from the Negro Leagues, there have been 17 different players who have won the batting Triple Crown. Some players have accomplished this feat multiple times, with Ted Williams, Rogers Hornsby, Oscar Charleston, and Josh Gibson each winning it twice.\n\nThe most recent batting Triple Crown winner in MLB was Miguel Cabrera, who achieved the feat in 2012 while playing for the Detroit Tigers. Prior to Cabrera, the last player to win the batting Triple Crown was Carl Yastrzemski in 1967.\n\nThe **pitching Triple Crown** is awarded to a pitcher who leads their league in three key categories: wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA). There have been 35 pitchers who have won the pitching Triple Crown in MLB history. This accomplishment has also seen several players win it on multiple occasions. Seven pitchers have won the award more than once: Christy Mathewson (2), Walter Johnson (3), Grover Alexander (3), Lefty Grove (2), Lefty Gomez (2), Sandy Koufax (3), and Roger Clemens (2).\n\nWhen combining both batting and pitching Triple Crown winners, there have been a total of 52 players who have achieved this prestigious honor.\n\n<<<52>>>"
