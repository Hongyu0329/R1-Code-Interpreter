    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Factorize the conductor $N$\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N = 36036$.\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\nSo, the prime power factorization is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n### Step 2: Properties of primitive Dirichlet characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be decomposed into a product of primitive characters modulo each of the prime power factors of $N$.\nLet $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$, where:\n*   $\\chi_1$ is a primitive character modulo $4$.\n*   $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character modulo $9$.\n*   $\\chi_3$ is a primitive character modulo $7$.\n*   $\\chi_4$ is a primitive character modulo $11$.\n*   $\\chi_5$ is a primitive character modulo $13$.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters. Let $k_i$ be the order of $\\chi_i$. The order of $\\chi$ is $\\operatorname{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4, k_5)$. We require this to be 6.\n\nThis implies that each individual order $k_i$ must be a divisor of 6.\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of suitable primitive characters for each factor\n\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor $p^a$ whose order divides 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$)**:\n    The group of Dirichlet characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. There is one primitive character modulo 4, and its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, this is a valid choice.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_1$: 1 (the order is $k_1=2$).\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$)**:\n    The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. A character modulo 9 is primitive if it is not a character modulo 3. The characters modulo 3 have orders 1 and 2. Therefore, any character modulo 9 of order 3 or 6 must be primitive.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Both orders 3 and 6 divide 6. So, the number of choices for $\\chi_2$ is $2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7**:\n    The group of characters modulo 7 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. All non-trivial characters are primitive. We need to count the characters whose orders divide 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_3$ is $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11**:\n    The group of characters modulo 11 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$. The order of a character for our purpose must divide $\\gcd(10, 6) = 2$. All non-trivial characters modulo 11 are primitive.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    The number of choices for $\\chi_4$ is 1 (the order is $k_4=2$).\n\n*   **Modulo 13**:\n    The group of characters modulo 13 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$. The order must divide $\\gcd(12, 6) = 6$. All non-trivial characters are primitive.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_5$ is $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the results\nWe need to find the total number of combinations of these characters such that the lcm of their orders is exactly 6.\nLet the orders be $(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4, k_5)$. Based on our analysis:\n*   $k_1 = 2$.\n*   $k_2 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$.\n*   $k_3 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n*   $k_4 = 2$.\n*   $k_5 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nLet $L = \\operatorname{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4, k_5)$.\n1.  Since all possible orders $k_i$ are divisors of 6, their lcm, $L$, must also divide 6.\n2.  The order $k_1$ is exactly 2, so $L$ must be a multiple of 2.\n3.  The order $k_2$ is either 3 or 6, which means $k_2$ is always a multiple of 3. Thus, $L$ must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSince $L$ is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of $\\operatorname{lcm}(2, 3) = 6$.\nCombining this with the fact that $L$ must divide 6, we conclude that $L$ must be exactly 6 for any combination of the selected component characters.\n\nTherefore, the total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nNumber of characters = (choices for $\\chi_1$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_2$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_3$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_5$)\nNumber of characters = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n<<<100>>>"
