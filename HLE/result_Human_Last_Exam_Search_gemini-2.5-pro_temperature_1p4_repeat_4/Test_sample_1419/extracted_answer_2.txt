The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ in the $\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions depends on the convention used for the coupling constant. A common convention, where the loop factors are absorbed into the definition of the coupling, yields $u^* = \frac{\epsilon}{3}$. Another convention leads to $u^* = \frac{2}{3}\epsilon$. In terms of the bare coupling constant $g$ appearing in the Lagrangian, the fixed point is $g^* = \frac{16\pi^2}{3}\epsilon$.
