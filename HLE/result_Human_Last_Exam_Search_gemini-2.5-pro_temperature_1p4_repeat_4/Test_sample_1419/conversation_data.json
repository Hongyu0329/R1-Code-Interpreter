    "The leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as $u^*$, in the $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions is determined by finding the non-trivial zero of the one-loop beta function. The calculation is performed in $d = 4 - \\epsilon$ dimensions, where $\\epsilon$ is a small parameter.\n\nThe one-loop beta function for the coupling constant $g$ in the $\\phi^4$ theory (which corresponds to the O(N) model with N=1) is given by:\n$$ \\beta(g) = \\frac{dg}{d\\ln\\mu} = -\\epsilon g + \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2} g^2 + O(g^3) $$\nHere, $\\mu$ is the renormalization scale. A fixed point, $g^*$, is a value of the coupling where the beta function vanishes, i.e., $\\beta(g^*) = 0$. Setting the above equation to zero gives:\n$$ -\\epsilon g^* + \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2} (g^*)^2 = 0 $$\nThis equation has two solutions. One is the trivial Gaussian fixed point, $g^*=0$. The other is the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point, which to leading order in $\\epsilon$ is:\n$$ g^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3}\\epsilon $$\nOften, a dimensionless coupling $u$ is defined by absorbing the loop factor of $1/(16\\pi^2)$. With the definition $u = \\frac{g}{16\\pi^2}$, the beta function becomes:\n$$ \\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + 3u^2 $$\nThe non-trivial fixed point for this rescaled coupling is then:\n$$ u^* = \\frac{\\epsilon}{3} $$\nThis result represents the leading order term in the $\\epsilon$-expansion for the fixed point coupling. It is a central result in the study of critical phenomena using the renormalization group. Another convention for the coupling constant gives the fixed point at $u^* = \\frac{2}{3}\\epsilon$. The specific numerical factor depends on the convention used for the coupling constant, but the linear dependence on $\\epsilon$ is a universal feature.\n\n<<<The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ in the $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions depends on the convention used for the coupling constant. A common convention, where the loop factors are absorbed into the definition of the coupling, yields $u^* = \\frac{\\epsilon}{3}$. Another convention leads to $u^* = \\frac{2}{3}\\epsilon$. In terms of the bare coupling constant $g$ appearing in the Lagrangian, the fixed point is $g^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3}\\epsilon$.>>>"
