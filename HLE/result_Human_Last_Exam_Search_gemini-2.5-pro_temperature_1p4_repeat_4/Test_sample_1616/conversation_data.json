    "Trisyllabic laxing is a rule in English phonology where a tense vowel (a long vowel or diphthong) becomes lax (a short vowel) when it is in a syllable that is followed by two or more syllables, the first of which is unstressed. This typically occurs in words of Latin and Greek origin when suffixes are added.\n\nLet's analyze each word:\n*   **southern**: This word underwent trisyllabic laxing. It derives from the Old English *sūþerne*. The long vowel in the first syllable of the older, three-syllable word was shortened. The modern word *south* (/saʊθ/) has a tense diphthong, while *southern* (/'sʌðərn/) has a lax vowel.\n*   **derivative**: This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The tense diphthong /aɪ/ in the second syllable of *derive* becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ in the four-syllable word *derivative*.\n*   **serenity**: This is another clear case. The tense vowel /iː/ in the second syllable of *serene* becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ in the four-syllable word *serenity*.\n*   **pleasant**: This two-syllable word has a lax vowel /ɛ/, while the related verb *please* has a tense vowel /iː/. However, because \"pleasant\" only has two syllables, the change is not due to trisyllabic laxing, which requires the vowel to be followed by at least two syllables.\n*   **gratitude**: This word demonstrates trisyllabic laxing. The tense diphthong /eɪ/ in the related word *grateful* becomes a lax vowel /æ/ in the three-syllable word *gratitude*.\n*   **shadow**: This two-syllable word has a lax vowel /æ/ which corresponds to the tense diphthong /eɪ/ in *shade*. The laxing in this case is an example of a different process called disyllabic laxing, not trisyllabic laxing, because the word only has two syllables.\n\nBoth \"pleasant\" and \"shadow\" are two-syllable words and therefore have not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing. However, the vowel change in *shade* to *shadow* is explicitly cited in linguistic sources as an example of a different rule (disyllabic laxing) which contrasts with trisyllabic laxing.\n\n<<<shadow"
