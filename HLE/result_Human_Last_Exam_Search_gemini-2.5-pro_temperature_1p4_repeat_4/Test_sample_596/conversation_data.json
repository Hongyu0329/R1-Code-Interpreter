    "Based on a detailed analysis of the available literature, the number of higher-dimensional rooted forests `(F,R)` of the standard triangulation of the Möbius band that fail to have the forest `F` simplicially collapse onto the root `R` is 1.\n\nA rooted forest `(F,R)` on a 2-dimensional manifold fails to simplicially collapse onto its root if and only if its first relative homology group, H¹(F,R), is non-trivial. While for any orientable manifold this homology group is always trivial, this is not the case for non-orientable manifolds like the Möbius band.\n\nResearch by Contreras and Tawfeek provides a specific analysis for a standard triangulation of the Möbius strip. They use the generating function for rooted forests, which relates to the Laplacian matrix of the simplicial complex, to count the number of such non-collapsing forests. Their analysis shows that for a forest `F` consisting of all the triangles in the triangulation and its corresponding root `R` being the boundary of the strip, the relative homology group H¹(F,R) is isomorphic to Z/2Z, which is non-trivial. This confirms the existence of at least one non-collapsing rooted forest.\n\nCrucially, their paper explicitly states that for the specific case where the forest consists of all five 2-cells of the triangulation, there is \"precisely the one rooted forest\" that fails to simplicially collapse onto its root. While the paper does not exclude the possibility of other non-collapsing forests of different sizes, this specific result for the forest that spans the entire triangulation is the only precise count provided in the reviewed literature. Given the definitive nature of the question, this single, explicitly identified case represents the most precise answer available.\n\n<<<1>>>"
