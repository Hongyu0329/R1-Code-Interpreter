    "To determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X = C^(15), where C is a genus 3 Riemann surface, we need to analyze the formula for the rank, which depends on the type of the curve C.\n\nLet ρ(V) denote the rank of the Néron-Severi group of a variety V. The Néron-Severi group, NS(V), is the group of divisors modulo algebraic equivalence, and its rank is also known as the Picard number. An important property is that ρ(V) is less than or equal to the second Betti number, h²(V, ℚ).\n\nFirst, we calculate the second Betti number of X = C^(15). The Poincaré polynomial P_X(t) = Σ b_i(X)t^i can be found using the Macdonald formula, which gives a generating function for the Poincaré polynomials of symmetric powers of a curve C of genus g:\nΣ_{d≥0} P_{C^(d)}(t) u^d = (1+tu)^{2g} / ((1-u)(1-t²u)).\nFor g=3, we have (1+tu)⁶ / ((1-u)(1-t²u)). The second Betti number, b₂(C^(15)), is the coefficient of t² in the polynomial P_{C^(15)}(t), which is the coefficient of u¹⁵ in the generating function.\nThe coefficient of u¹⁵ in (Σ_{i=0}^6 \\binom{6}{i} t^i u^i) * (Σ_{j≥0} u^j) * (Σ_{k≥0} t^{2k} u^k) that contains a t² term comes from two cases:\n1.  From the term with i=2 in the first factor (binom(6,2)t²u²) and k=0 in the third factor. This gives 15t².\n2.  From the term with i=0 in the first factor and k=1 in the third factor (t²u). This gives t².\nSumming these up, the coefficient of t² in P_{C^(15)}(t) is 15 + 1 = 16. So, h²(C^(15)) = 16.\nThis provides an upper bound for the rank: ρ(C^(15)) ≤ 16.\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of C^(d) depends on whether the curve C is hyperelliptic.\n\n**Case 1: C is a non-hyperelliptic curve.**\nA general curve of genus 3 is non-hyperelliptic. For a non-hyperelliptic curve C of genus g ≥ 3 and d ≥ g-1, the rank of the Néron-Severi group is given by the formula:\nρ(C^(d)) = ρ(J(C)) + 1, where J(C) is the Jacobian of C.\nIn our case, g=3 and d=15, so the condition is satisfied.\n*   **Smallest Rank:** To find the smallest rank, we need the minimum possible value of ρ(J(C)). For a very general curve C, the endomorphism ring of its Jacobian is just the integers, End(J(C)) = ℤ, which implies that ρ(J(C)) = 1. This gives the smallest possible rank for this case:\n    ρ(C^(15)) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n*   **Largest Rank (in this case):** To find the largest rank, we need the maximum possible value of ρ(J(C)) for a non-hyperelliptic genus 3 curve. An example of such a curve with a large Picard number for its Jacobian is the Fermat quartic curve, F₄: x⁴ + y⁴ + z⁴ = 0. The Jacobian J(F₄) has complex multiplication, and its Néron-Severi rank is ρ(J(F₄)) = 9. This gives a rank of:\n    ρ(C^(15)) = 9 + 1 = 10.\n\n**Case 2: C is a hyperelliptic curve.**\nFor a hyperelliptic curve C of genus g and d ≥ g, a plausible formula for the rank is:\nρ(C^(d)) = ρ(J(C)) + d - g + 1.\nFor g=3 and d=15, this becomes:\nρ(C^(15)) = ρ(J(C)) + 15 - 3 + 1 = ρ(J(C)) + 13.\nWe must respect the bound ρ(C^(15)) ≤ 16, which implies ρ(J(C)) + 13 ≤ 16, so ρ(J(C)) ≤ 3.\n*   **Smallest Rank (in this case):** For a generic hyperelliptic curve, we again have ρ(J(C)) = 1. This yields a rank of:\n    ρ(C^(15)) = 1 + 13 = 14.\n*   **Largest Rank (in this case):** To maximize the rank, we need a hyperelliptic curve of genus 3 with the largest possible value of ρ(J(C)), subject to the constraint ρ(J(C)) ≤ 3. It is known that there exist hyperelliptic curves with CM Jacobians. For example, the curve C defined by y² = x⁷ - 1 is a genus 3 hyperelliptic curve whose Jacobian has complex multiplication by ℤ[ζ₇], and for which ρ(J(C)) = 3. This is the maximum value allowed by our constraint. This gives a rank of:\n    ρ(C^(15)) = 3 + 13 = 16.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy comparing the possible ranks from both cases:\n*   The possible ranks for non-hyperelliptic curves are in the range (based on known examples).\n*   The possible ranks for hyperelliptic curves are in the range.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is the minimum of {2, 14}, which is 2.\nThe largest possible rank is the maximum of {10, 16}, which is 16.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 2, and the largest is 16.\n\n"
