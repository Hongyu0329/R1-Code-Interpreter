    "White can win in 3 moves.\n\nThe winning sequence is a forced checkmate, which assumes optimal play from both sides. The move order is as follows:\n\n1.  **Qxf7+**\n    This opening move forces the black king to the corner, as it is the only legal move. Black's response is `Kh7`.\n\n2.  **Rxe1**\n    White captures the threatening black rook on e1. This move sets up the final checkmate. Black's best response, though futile, is to capture the white rook with their own rook on e8 (`Rxe1`).\n\n3.  **Qf8#**\n    This is checkmate. The white queen moves to f8, and the black king on h7 has no escape squares. The queen on f8 covers the g8, h8, g7, and h6 squares, while the white bishop on h5 covers the g6 square.\n\nTherefore, with optimal play, White can achieve checkmate in 3 moves.\n\n<<<3>>>"
