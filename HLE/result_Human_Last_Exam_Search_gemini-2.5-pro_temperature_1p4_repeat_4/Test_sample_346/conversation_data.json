    "To solve this problem, we must evaluate the given SKI combinator expression to find the Church integer `n`, and then compute the base-2 logarithm of `n`.\n\n### Step 1: Parsing the Expression\n\nThe expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nLet's break it down into its components. The expression is structured with nested applications of the `S(I)` combinator.\n\n*   `A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n*   `B = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n\nThe overall structure can be seen as:\n`E = S(I) ( S(I) ( S(I)(K(A)) ) (B) )`\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating the Innermost Components\n\nFirst, let's determine the value of `A`. The combinator `S(S(K(S))(K))` is the standard SKI representation of the successor function for Church numerals (`succ`). The `I` combinator (`λx.x`) is used in some contexts, and when the successor function is applied to it, it yields the Church numeral for 2.\n\n`A = succ(I) = (λn.λf.λx. f (n f x)) (λy.y) = λf.λx. f (I f x) = λf.λx. f (f x)`\n\nThis is the definition of the Church numeral **2**.\n\nThe component `B` is the successor function applied to `S(I)(I)`. The combinator `S(I)(I)` reduces to `λx.xx`, which is a self-application combinator. As it turns out, the value of `B` is irrelevant to the final result due to how the `K` combinator functions.\n\n### Step 3: Reducing the Expression\n\nWe evaluate the expression from the inside out. Let's start with the innermost complex term:\n`Z = S(I)(K(A))(B)`\n\nThe `S(I)` combinator has the reduction rule `S(I)xy = x(xy)`. Therefore:\n`Z = K(A) (K(A) B)`\n\nThe `K` combinator (`Kxy = x`) discards its second argument.\n*   `K(A)(B)` reduces to `A`.\n*   The expression for `Z` then becomes `K(A)(A)`.\n*   This again reduces to `A`.\n\nSo, the complex inner expression `S(I)(K(A))(B)` simplifies to `A`, which is the Church numeral **2**.\n\nNow, we substitute this result back into the main expression:\n`E = S(I) ( S(I) (A) )`\nSince `A = 2`, the expression is:\n`E = S(I) ( S(I) (2) )`\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating `S(I)` on Church Numerals\n\nThe combinator `S(I)` when applied to a Church numeral `m` results in the Church numeral for `m` squared (`m²`). Let's verify this.\n*   `S(I)m = λf. m(mf)`\n*   The Church numeral for exponentiation, `pow m n`, is `n m`.\n*   So, `pow m 2` is `2 m = λf.λx. m(mf)x`.\n\nThe term `S(I)m = λf. m(mf)` represents the Church numeral `m^2`.\n\nApplying this rule to our simplified expression:\n1.  `S(I)(2)` evaluates to the Church numeral for `2^2 = 4`.\n2.  The expression becomes `S(I)(4)`.\n3.  `S(I)(4)` evaluates to the Church numeral for `4^2 = 16`.\n\nThus, the given expression `E` is the Church numeral for `n = 16`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Final Answer\n\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(16) = 4`\n\n<<<4>>>"
