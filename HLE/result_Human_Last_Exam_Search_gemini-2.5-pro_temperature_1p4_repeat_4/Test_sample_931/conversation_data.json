    "Adult Raphidiopterans, or snakeflies, are primarily predatory insects. Their diet mainly consists of soft-bodied arthropods, with a notable preference for aphids. In pear orchards, for instance, they are considered important predators of the pear psylla.\n\nIn addition to preying on other insects, some adult snakeflies have been recorded feeding on pollen and nectar. Pollen has been discovered in the digestive tracts of snakeflies, though it is not definitively known if this is a required food source or simply a favored one. While many species are carnivorous, some non-predatory species subsist on nectar, pollen, or honeydew.\n\nThere is no scientific record of adult snakeflies consuming fungus or leaf tissue. Both larvae and adults are known to be predators, with larvae feeding on the eggs and young of other arthropods.\n\nBased on the available evidence, adult snakeflies have been recorded feeding on both nectar and aphids.\n\n*   **A. Nectar:** Supported by multiple sources indicating that some adults feed on nectar and other sugary substances.\n*   **B. Māhoe pollen:** While adults do eat pollen, there is no specific record of them eating pollen from the New Zealand native Māhoe, especially since snakeflies are not established in New Zealand.\n*   **C. Fungus:** Not supported by evidence.\n*   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** Not supported by evidence; they are predators, not herbivores.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** Supported, as aphids are a primary food source. \"Totara Aphids\" specify a type of aphid, which falls under their general diet.\n\nTherefore, the correct choices are A and E.\n\n<<<F>>>"
