To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must be in a flat, extended state during the night. At sunrise, with the appearance of sunlight (specifically UV light), it must bend or fold into a compact, V-shape. At sunset, in the absence of UV light, it must slowly relax and return to its flat state.
