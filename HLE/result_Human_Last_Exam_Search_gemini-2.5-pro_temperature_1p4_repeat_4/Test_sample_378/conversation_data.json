    "There is no specific record of a singular event where Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\" for the first time as if it were a name change. His full name at birth is reported to be Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\n\nHowever, the name \"Azikiwe\" gained public prominence and was notably emphasized around 2010. Here's a timeline of when the name became a subject of public discussion:\n\n*   **Praise Name:** According to some accounts, \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president.\n\n*   **Public Emphasis in 2010:** In August 2010, the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, referred to the President as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" during a university convocation lecture. This caused a stir among the audience and was perceived by some as a political move to create a closer affinity with the Igbo people.\n\n*   **Presidential Declaration:** In September 2010, during his presidential declaration at Eagle Square, Jonathan reportedly used variations of his name, including \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\". This inconsistent use of the name led to accusations that it was being used for political deceit.\n\nIn conclusion, while \"Azikiwe\" is part of his birth name, it was in **2010** that the name was publicly emphasized and became a point of political discussion.\n\n<<<There is no definitive year when Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan first publicly identified himself as Azikiwe, as it is reportedly part of his birth name. However, the name came into prominent public and political discourse in 2010.>>>"
