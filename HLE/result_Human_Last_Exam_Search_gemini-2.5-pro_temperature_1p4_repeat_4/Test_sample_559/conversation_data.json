    "The analysis is confirmed. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different qualitative behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are classic examples of separatrices. In particular, a trajectory that connects two different equilibrium points, known as a heteroclinic orbit, often acts as a separatrix.\n\nMy analysis identified the following:\n*   **Equilibrium points:** (0, 0) which is a non-hyperbolic saddle-node, (1, 0) which is an unstable node, and (1, -1) which is a saddle point.\n*   **Saddle point manifolds:** The saddle point is at (1, -1). Its stable manifold is the line `u=1` (for d > -1 and d < 0), and its unstable manifold is the trajectory defined by the curve `d = -u^2`.\n*   **Heteroclinic Orbit:** The curve `d = -u^2` is an exact solution to the system's trajectory equation, $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^4 - u^3}{u^2(u-1)}$. This curve passes through the saddle point (1, -1) and the non-hyperbolic equilibrium (0, 0). An orbit connecting two different equilibria is called a heteroclinic orbit.\n*   **Separating Behavior:** I've shown that the curve `d = -u^2` separates trajectories. Those starting above it in the region 0 < u < 1 tend to move towards $d=+\\infty$, while those starting below it are attracted towards the curve itself and end up at the origin (0,0). This curve is therefore a separatrix.\n\nThe question asks for \"the\" separatrix. While the stable manifold $u=1$ is also technically a separatrix, the more significant one that dictates the fate of a larger portion of the phase plane is the unstable manifold of the saddle point, which is the curve $d = -u^2$. This is the feature that organizes the global dynamics in the phase plane. It's common in such problems for \"the separatrix\" to refer to such a prominent heteroclinic or homoclinic connection.\n\nThe final answer is the equation of this curve.\n\nFinal check of the calculations:\n*   Equilibrium points: Confirmed.\n*   Jacobian at (1, -1): $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues 1, -2. It's a saddle. Confirmed.\n*   Eigenvector for $\\lambda=1$: $(J-I)v = 0 \\Rightarrow \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\Rightarrow -6v_u-3v_d=0 \\Rightarrow v_d = -2v_u$. Vector is $(1, -2)$.\n*   Tangent to $d=-u^2$ at $u=1$: $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u \\Rightarrow \\frac{dd}{du}|_{u=1} = -2$. The tangent vector is $(1, -2)$. Confirmed.\n*   Check if $d=-u^2$ is a solution:\n    *   LHS of trajectory equation: $(u-1)u^2 \\frac{dd}{du} = (u-1)u^2(-2u) = -2u^4+2u^3$.\n    *   RHS: $2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^4 - u^3 = 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) + u^4 - u^3 = 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n    *   LHS = RHS. Confirmed.\n\nThe logic holds. The curve $d = -u^2$ is a trajectory that corresponds to the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$ and connects it to the origin. This curve separates the phase plane into regions with distinct long-term behaviors, making it the primary separatrix of the system.\n\n<<<The separatrix is given by the curve $d = -u^2$.>>>"
