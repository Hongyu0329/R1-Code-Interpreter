    "The ground space degeneracy of the toric code depends on the topology of the surface on which it is defined. The formula for the number of logical qubits, `k`, on an orientable surface of genus `g` with `b_s` smooth boundaries and `b_r` rough boundaries is given by `k = 2g + b_s + b_r - 1`, for `b_s + b_r > 0`. The ground state degeneracy is then `2^k`.\n\nThe term \"toric code\" can either refer to the model on a torus (a surface with genus `g=1`) or more generally to the planar code, which is the toric code model on a surface with boundaries, topologically equivalent to a sphere (genus `g=0`) with punctures.\n\nLet's consider the case of a planar code, which corresponds to a sphere (genus `g=0`) with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. These `n+m` holes constitute the inner boundaries. There is also an outer boundary for the planar surface.\n\nWe have two scenarios for the outer boundary:\n\n1.  **The outer boundary is smooth:** In this case, the total number of smooth boundaries is `b_s = n + 1` (the `n` inner holes plus the outer boundary) and the number of rough boundaries is `b_r = m`.\n    The number of logical qubits is `k = 2*0 + (n + 1) + m - 1 = n + m`.\n\n2.  **The outer boundary is rough:** Here, the number of smooth boundaries is `b_s = n` and the number of rough boundaries is `b_r = m + 1`.\n    The number of logical qubits is `k = 2*0 + n + (m + 1) - 1 = n + m`.\n\nIn both scenarios, the number of logical qubits is `k = n + m`. Therefore, the ground space degeneracy is `2^k = 2^(n+m)`.\n\nThis result is consistent with specialized cases. For instance, for a planar lattice with `b` smooth holes and no rough holes (`n=b`, `m=0`), the formula gives `k=b`, which means the degeneracy is `2^b`. This is a known result for surface codes.\n\n<<<A>>>"
