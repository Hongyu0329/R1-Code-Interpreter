    "In Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość,\" the main character, Adam Zamoyski, does not marry a specific named individual in the traditional sense.\n\nThe narrative alludes to a political union intended to end a war. One search result states, \"This union was to end the war; however, the marriage with the sworn enemy did not bring them...\" This indicates a strategic alliance rather than a romantic marriage. However, the identity of this \"sworn enemy\" with whom the union is formed is not explicitly named in the available information.\n\nFurthermore, other search results clarify that a character referred to as Zamoyski's \"wife\" is an advanced AI construct, not a human. The novel also deliberately avoids a romantic storyline between Zamoyski and the main female character, Angelika McPherson.\n\nTherefore, based on the accessible information, there is no named character that Adam Zamoyski marries.\n\n<<<In Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość,\" the main character, Adam Zamoyski, does not marry a specific named character. The book suggests a political union or marriage was intended to end a war, but the identity of the other party, referred to as a \"sworn enemy,\" is not specified."
