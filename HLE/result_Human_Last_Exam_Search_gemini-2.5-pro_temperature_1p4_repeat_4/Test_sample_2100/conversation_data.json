    "The man Andrei Voznesensky immortalized as \"a joy-discovering sailor\" was the Russian diplomat and explorer Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov.\n\nThe questions in the poem reference the real-life story of Rezanov, who was a central figure in Voznesensky's renowned rock opera, \"Juno and Avos\". In 1806, while on a mission to secure provisions for Russian colonies in Alaska, Rezanov arrived in Spanish California. There, he fell in love with Concepción \"Conchita\" Argüello, the fifteen-year-old daughter of the commandant of the San Francisco Presidio.\n\nAfter becoming engaged, Rezanov began the arduous journey back to St. Petersburg to gain the Tsar's permission to marry a Catholic. However, he fell ill and died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807. For many years, the exact location of his grave was uncertain. The answer to Voznesensky's question, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" emerged in the late 20th century with the rediscovery and confirmation of his burial site in Krasnoyarsk.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
