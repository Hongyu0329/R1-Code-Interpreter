    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the primary mountain and establish the baseline.**\nThe question explicitly names Mount Olympus as the tallest. Mount Olympus is the highest mountain in Greece, with its peak, Mytikas, reaching an elevation of 2,918 meters (9,573 feet). It serves as the home of the gods in the *Iliad* and is mentioned frequently. Our task is to find the *second* tallest mountain from the text.\n\n**Step 2: Compile a list of other mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*.**\nWe must carefully scan the epic for explicit mentions of other mountains. A mention can be a major setting (like Zeus's vantage point) or a geographical marker in a list (like the Catalogue of Ships in Book 2). The key candidates are:\n\n*   **Mount Ida:** Located in the Troad (modern-day Turkey), near the site of Troy. It is a very prominent mountain in the *Iliad*, often used by Zeus as a vantage point to watch the Trojan War.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Mount Fengari/Saos):** In Book 13, the god Poseidon watches the battle from \"the topmost peak of wooded Samothrace.\" This is a real island with a significant mountain.\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, the goddess Hera's journey from Olympus is described: \"From the peak of Athos she fared across the billowy sea.\"\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Mentioned several times, most famously as the source of the ash wood for Achilles's great spear, which was a gift from his father Peleus.\n*   **Mount Parnassus:** This mountain is mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2), which lists the contingents of the Greek army. The entry for the Phocians notes that they came from towns around \"rocky Pytho\" (Delphi), which lies on the slopes of Mount Parnassus.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** This mountain in Lydia (modern-day Turkey) is also mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2) as the homeland of the Maeonians.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the real-world elevations of these historical mountains.**\nTo find the tallest, we need the actual height of each mountain listed above.\n\n*   **Mount Parnassus:** 2,457 meters (8,061 feet)\n*   **Mount Tmolus (Bozdağ):** 2,157 meters (7,077 feet)\n*   **Mount Athos:** 2,033 meters (6,670 feet)\n*   **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı):** 1,774 meters (5,820 feet)\n*   **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 meters (5,328 feet)\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Fengari):** 1,611 meters (5,285 feet)\n\n**Step 4: Compare the elevations and identify the tallest after Olympus.**\nNow we arrange the mountains in descending order of height, with Olympus for reference.\n\n1.  Mount Olympus: 2,918 m\n2.  **Mount Parnassus: 2,457 m**\n3.  Mount Tmolus: 2,157 m\n4.  Mount Athos: 2,033 m\n5.  Mount Ida: 1,774 m\n6.  Mount Pelion: 1,624 m\n7.  Mount Samothrace: 1,611 m\n\nFrom this comparison, Mount Parnassus is clearly the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Narrative Importance vs. Physical Height:** One might assume Mount Ida is the answer because it plays a much larger role in the narrative than Mount Parnassus. However, the question asks for the \"tallest historical mountain,\" which is an objective geographical fact, not a measure of its importance to the plot.\n2.  **Verifying the Mention:** It is crucial to confirm that the mountain is mentioned in the *Iliad* itself, not just in general Greek mythology or in the *Odyssey*. The mention of Parnassus in the Catalogue of Ships is a valid, though less dramatic, reference.\n3.  **Identifying the Correct \"Mount Ida\":** There are two famous Mount Idas in the Greek world. The one in the *Iliad* is in the Troad, Turkey. The other, located on Crete and associated with the birth of Zeus, is taller (2,456 m) but is not the one referenced in the context of the Trojan War.\n4.  **Using Modern Elevation Data:** The answer relies on modern geological data for mountain heights, which is the standard way to answer such a \"historical geography\" question.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBy systematically identifying all mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* and comparing their known elevations, we exclude Mount Olympus (the tallest) and find that the next tallest on the list is Mount Parnassus.\n\n<<<Mount Parnassus>>>"
