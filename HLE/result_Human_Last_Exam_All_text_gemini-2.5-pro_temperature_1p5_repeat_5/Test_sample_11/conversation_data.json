    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the very first law passed by the Knesset (the parliament of the modern State of Israel, established in 1948) that explicitly used the legal term \"good faith.\" The Hebrew equivalent for \"good faith\" is \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*). The question has specific formatting requirements for the final answer: do not include the preceding \"the\" or the year of the statute.\n\n2.  **Historical Context:** After its establishment in 1948, the State of Israel inherited a legal system composed mainly of Ottoman law and British Mandate law. Over the subsequent decades, the Knesset undertook a major project of replacing this inherited legislation with original Israeli statutes. The introduction of the \"good faith\" principle was a key feature of this new wave of civil codification, which largely drew inspiration from continental European legal systems rather than the English common law.\n\n3.  **Identify Potential Candidates:**\n    *   Many people associate \"good faith\" in Israeli law with the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Its sections 12 and 39 elevated the principle of good faith to a cornerstone of Israeli contract law, applying it to both pre-contractual negotiations and the performance of contractual obligations. However, while this law was highly influential in expanding the doctrine, it was not the *first* to introduce the concept.\n    *   This means we must look at legislation enacted *before* 1973. The main period for the new civil codification began in the mid-1960s. Several important laws from this era are candidates:\n        *   **Sale Law, 1968:** This law explicitly uses the term. For example, Section 6 requires obligations to be fulfilled \"in the customary manner and in good faith.\"\n        *   **Agency Law, 1965:** This law also uses the term. Section 8 establishes the agent's duty of loyalty to the principal, stating that the agent must act \"in good faith\" (*be-tom lev*).\n        *   **Succession Law, 1965:** This major piece of legislation also explicitly uses the term \"good faith\" in several provisions. For example, Section 71 discusses a person who acquired a right in estate property \"in good faith,\" and Section 154 discusses payments made \"in good faith\" by someone holding estate property.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the First Statute:** To determine which was first, we need to compare the enactment dates of the laws from 1965.\n    *   The **Succession Law, 5725-1965** was passed by the Knesset in February 1965.\n    *   The **Agency Law, 5725-1965** was passed by the Knesset in May 1965.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since both the Succession Law and the Agency Law explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" into the statutory framework of the modern State of Israel, and the Succession Law was enacted several months before the Agency Law, the **Succession Law** is the correct answer. It precedes other famous laws like the Sale Law (1968) and the Contracts (General Part) Law (1973) in explicitly codifying this principle.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **\"Statute in the modern State of Israel\":** This is a crucial constraint. While some British Mandate-era ordinances (like the Bills of Exchange Ordinance) used the term \"good faith,\" they were not statutes passed by the Knesset and thus do not qualify as statutes \"in the modern State of Israel.\" The question refers to original Israeli legislation.\n*   **\"Explicitly introduce\":** The law must use the actual words \"good faith\" (or *tom lev*). It is not enough for the law to imply a principle of fairness or honesty. The Succession Law meets this criterion with its repeated use of the phrase *be-tom lev*.\n*   **\"First\":** Chronological order is key. The legislative activity of 1965 was a turning point, and comparing the enactment dates of the statutes from that year is necessary to find the correct answer.\n*   **Formatting:** The final answer must strictly adhere to the user's instructions: no \"the\" and no year.\n\n<<<Succession Law>>>"
