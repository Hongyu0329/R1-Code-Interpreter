A finite group G is filled if every non-identity element of G belongs to at least one maximal product-free set. A finite nilpotent group is filled if and only if each of its Sylow p-subgroups is a filled p-group. The classification of filled p-groups is an open problem, but based on known results, a finite nilpotent group G must be a direct product of Sylow subgroups chosen from the following list:
1. For p=2, the Sylow 2-subgroup is either C₂ or C₄.
2. For p=3, the Sylow 3-subgroup is either C₃ or C₃ × C₃.
3. For primes p ≥ 5, the Sylow p-subgroup is Cₚ. It is conjectured that for p ≥ 5, Cₚ is the only filled p-group.
Therefore, the finite filled nilpotent groups are all groups that can be formed by taking a direct product of groups, at most one for each prime, from this list of filled p-groups.
