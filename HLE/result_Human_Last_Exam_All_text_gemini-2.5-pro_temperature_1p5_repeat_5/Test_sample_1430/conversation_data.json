    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the objects and the question**\n*   **C:** A genus 3 Riemann surface. This is a complex algebraic curve.\n*   **X = C^(15):** The 15th symmetric power of C. This is the variety whose points correspond to unordered sets of 15 points on C. Equivalently, it is the space of effective divisors of degree 15 on C. It is a smooth projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   **Neron-Severi group NS(X):** This is the group of algebraic divisor classes on X modulo algebraic equivalence.\n*   **Rank of the Neron-Severi group, œÅ(X):** This is also known as the Picard number of X.\n*   **The goal:** Find the minimum and maximum possible values of $\\rho(X) = \\rho(C^{(15)})$ as C varies over all genus 3 Riemann surfaces.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Neron-Severi group of X to the properties of C**\nA fundamental result in the study of symmetric powers of curves relates the Neron-Severi group of $C^{(d)}$ to the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian variety of C.\n\n*   Let $J(C)$ be the Jacobian variety of C. Since C has genus g=3, $J(C)$ is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety.\n*   There is a well-defined map, the Abel-Jacobi map, $u: C^{(d)} \\to J(C)$.\n*   A classical result, established by MacDonald and further clarified by others, states that the Neron-Severi group of the d-th symmetric power of a curve is generated by the pullback of the Neron-Severi group of its Jacobian and one additional generator (often called the tautological class).\n*   This leads to the formula for the rank:\n    $$ \\rho(C^{(d)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1 $$\n*   In our specific case, $d=15$ and the genus of C is 3. The formula applies directly:\n    $$ \\rho(X) = \\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1 $$\n*   Therefore, the problem is reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for $\\rho(J(C))$, the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n**Step 3: Find the smallest possible rank of NS(J(C))**\n*   The rank $\\rho(J(C))$ depends on the algebraic structure of the endomorphism ring of $J(C)$.\n*   For a **generic** genus 3 curve C, its Jacobian $J(C)$ is a simple abelian variety with the minimal possible endomorphism ring, which is just the integers, $End(J(C)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   In this case, the Neron-Severi group $NS(J(C))$ is generated solely by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor).\n*   Thus, for a generic curve C, the rank is minimal:\n    $$ \\min \\rho(J(C)) = 1 $$\n*   This minimum value is achieved for almost all genus 3 curves, as curves with extra endomorphisms form a lower-dimensional subvariety in the moduli space of curves.\n\n**Step 4: Find the largest possible rank of NS(J(C))**\n*   The rank of the Neron-Severi group of a g-dimensional abelian variety A is bounded above by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}(A)$.\n*   For an abelian variety, $h^{1,1}(A) = g^2$. In our case, $g=3$, so:\n    $$ \\rho(J(C)) \\le h^{1,1}(J(C)) = 3^2 = 9 $$\n*   This maximum rank is achieved if and only if the abelian variety is of **CM-type** (Complex Multiplication type). An abelian variety is of CM-type if its endomorphism algebra contains a commutative semisimple algebra over $\\mathbb{Q}$ of rank $2g$.\n*   We must verify that there exist genus 3 curves C whose Jacobians $J(C)$ are of CM-type.\n*   Such curves exist. A prime example is the **Fermat quartic curve**, defined by the equation $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$. This is a smooth plane curve of genus 3. Its Jacobian $J(C)$ is known to be isogenous to the product $E \\times E \\times E$, where E is the elliptic curve with complex multiplication by $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ (the Gaussian integers). An abelian variety that is isogenous to a product of CM elliptic curves is itself of CM-type.\n*   For such a curve C, the rank of the Neron-Severi group of its Jacobian achieves the theoretical maximum:\n    $$ \\max \\rho(J(C)) = 9 $$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer**\nNow we use the formula from Step 2 and the minimum and maximum values for $\\rho(J(C))$ found in Steps 3 and 4.\n\n*   **Smallest possible rank of NS(X):**\n    $\\rho_{min}(X) = \\min \\rho(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$\n\n*   **Largest possible rank of NS(X):**\n    $\\rho_{max}(X) = \\max \\rho(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe smallest possible rank occurs for a generic genus 3 curve, and the largest possible rank occurs for a special curve with a CM-type Jacobian, like the Fermat quartic.\n\nThe smallest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X is 2.\nThe largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest rank is 2 and the largest rank is 10.>>>"
