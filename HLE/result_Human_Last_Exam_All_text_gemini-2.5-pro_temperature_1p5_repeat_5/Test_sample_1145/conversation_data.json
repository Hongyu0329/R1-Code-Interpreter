    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of finding the particle in the specified interval.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the System and Identify Key Formulas\n*   **System:** A particle in a 1-dimensional box.\n*   **Box Length:** `a`. The box extends from `x=0` to `x=a`.\n*   **Quantum State:** `n = 2` (the first excited state).\n*   **Interval:** `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a`.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the probability, `P`, of finding the particle in this interval.\n\nThe probability of finding a particle in an interval [x1, x2] is given by the integral of the probability density function, `|ψ(x)|²`, over that interval.\n\nThe normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is:\n`ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n\nThe probability density is:\n`P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx / a)`\n\n### Step 2: Set Up the Specific Integral for n=2\nFor the `n=2` state, the probability density is:\n`P(x) = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)`\n\nThe probability, `P`, is the integral of this function from `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a`:\n`P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx`\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Integral\nTo solve the integral, we use the trigonometric power-reduction identity: `sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ)) / 2`.\nHere, `θ = 2πx / a`. Therefore, `2θ = 4πx / a`.\n\nSubstituting the identity into our integral:\n`P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * [(1 - cos(4πx / a)) / 2] dx`\n`P = (1/a) * ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1 - cos(4πx / a)) dx`\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Integral\nWe now perform the integration:\n`∫ (1 - cos(4πx / a)) dx = x - (a / 4π) * sin(4πx / a)`\n\nNow, we evaluate this result at the limits of integration:\n`P = (1/a) * [ (x - (a / 4π) * sin(4πx / a)) ]` from `0.495a` to `0.505a`\n`P = (1/a) * [ (0.505a - 0.495a) - (a / 4π) * (sin(4π * 0.505a / a) - sin(4π * 0.495a / a)) ]`\n\nSimplify the terms inside the bracket:\n`P = (1/a) * [ 0.01a - (a / 4π) * (sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)) ]`\n\n### Step 5: Simplify the Sine Terms\nWe use the properties of the sine function: `sin(2π + θ) = sin(θ)` and `sin(2π - θ) = -sin(θ)`.\n*   `sin(2.02π) = sin(2π + 0.02π) = sin(0.02π)`\n*   `sin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)`\n\nSubstituting these back:\n`sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π) = sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π)) = 2 * sin(0.02π)`\n\nNow the probability expression becomes:\n`P = (1/a) * [ 0.01a - (a / 4π) * (2 * sin(0.02π)) ]`\n`P = 0.01 - (1 / 2π) * sin(0.02π)`\n\n### Step 6: Use Small-Angle Approximation\nThe argument of the sine function, `y = 0.02π`, is very small. For a small angle `y`, the Taylor series expansion for `sin(y)` is `sin(y) ≈ y - y³/6`. Using just `sin(y) ≈ y` would lead to `P = 0`, which is incorrect because the interval has a finite width.\n`P ≈ 0.01 - (1 / 2π) * [ (0.02π) - (0.02π)³/6 ]`\n`P ≈ 0.01 - [ (0.02π / 2π) - (0.02π)³ / (12π) ]`\n`P ≈ 0.01 - [ 0.01 - (0.02π)³ / (12π) ]`\n`P ≈ (0.02π)³ / (12π)`\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the Final Numerical Value\n`P ≈ (0.000008 * π³) / (12π)`\n`P ≈ (0.000008 * π²) / 12`\n`P ≈ (2 * 10⁻⁶ * π²) / 3`\n\nUsing the value `π² ≈ 9.8696`:\n`P ≈ (2 * 10⁻⁶ * 9.8696) / 3`\n`P ≈ (19.7392 * 10⁻⁶) / 3`\n`P ≈ 6.5797 * 10⁻⁶`\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n1.  **Correct State (n=2):** The wavefunction `sin(2πx/a)` must be used, not `sin(πx/a)` (which is for n=1).\n2.  **Node at the Center:** For n=2, there is a node (zero probability) exactly at the center of the box (`x=a/2`). The requested interval is centered on this node, so the probability is expected to be very small.\n3.  **Approximation Method:** A simple approximation `P ≈ P(center) * Δx` would give an incorrect answer of 0. The curvature of the probability density function must be accounted for.\n4.  **Taylor Expansion:** When using the small-angle approximation for `sin(y)` in the expression `k - sin(k*y)`, it is crucial to use at least two terms (`y - y³/6`) to get a non-zero result.\n5.  **Units:** Probability is dimensionless. All factors of the box length `a` should cancel out in the final expression, which they do.\n\nThe final answer is approximately 0.00000658.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
