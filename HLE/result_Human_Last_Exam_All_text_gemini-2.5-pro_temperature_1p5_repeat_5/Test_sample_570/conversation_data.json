    "An elegant problem in convex geometry and the geometry of numbers. Let's analyze it step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Family of Lines\nThe problem requires a convex domain `K` to intersect every line in the family `L` given by the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (`gcd(p, q) = 1`).\n\n*   **What is this set of lines?** This set `L` consists of all lines in the plane that pass through at least one integer lattice point. This is a direct consequence of Bézout's identity, which states that for any coprime integers `p` and `q`, there exist integers `m` and `n` such that `pm + qn = 1`. This means the line `px + qy = 1` passes through the integer point `(m, n)`.\n*   **Examples of lines in L:**\n    *   If `(p,q)=(1,0)`, we get `x=1`. `gcd(1,0)=1`.\n    *   If `(p,q)=(-1,0)`, we get `x=-1`.\n    *   If `(p,q)=(0,1)`, we get `y=1`.\n    *   If `(p,q)=(0,-1)`, we get `y=-1`.\n    *   If `(p,q)=(1,1)`, we get `x+y=1`.\n    *   If `(p,q)=(1,-1)`, we get `x-y=1`.\n    *   If `(p,q)=(-1,-1)`, we get `-x-y=1`, which is `x+y=-1`.\n    *   And so on, for all coprime integer pairs `(p,q)`.\n\n### Step 2: Formulating the Condition for a Convex Domain\nLet `K` be a convex domain. For `K` to intersect a line `px + qy = 1`, the set of values of the linear function `f(x,y) = px + qy` for `(x,y)` in `K` must contain the value 1.\n\nLet `sup_K(p,q)` be the supremum of `px+qy` over `(x,y) \\in K`, and `inf_K(p,q)` be the infimum. The condition is:\n`inf_K(p,q) ≤ 1 ≤ sup_K(p,q)` for all coprime integer pairs `(p,q)`.\n\n### Step 3: Using Symmetry to Find a Stronger Condition\nThe set of lines `L` is centrally symmetric. If `px+qy=1` is a line in `L` (with `(p,q)` being coprime), then so is `(-p)x+(-q)y=1` (since `gcd(-p,-q)=gcd(p,q)=1`). Let `p` represent the vector `(p,q)`. The set of primitive integer vectors `S'` is centrally symmetric (`p ∈ S' ⇒ -p ∈ S'`).\n\n1.  From the condition in Step 2, for any `p ∈ S'`, we have:\n    `inf_K(p) ≤ 1 ≤ sup_K(p)`\n\n2.  Since `-p` is also in `S'`, we must also satisfy:\n    `inf_K(-p) ≤ 1 ≤ sup_K(-p)`\n\n3.  For any convex set `K`, `inf_K(-p) = -sup_K(p)` and `sup_K(-p) = -inf_K(p)`. Substituting this into the second inequality gives:\n    `-sup_K(p) ≤ 1 ≤ -inf_K(p)`\n    This is equivalent to `sup_K(p) ≥ -1` and `inf_K(p) ≤ -1`.\n\n4.  Combining the results from (1) and (3), for any `p ∈ S'`, we must satisfy both `sup_K(p) ≥ 1` and `inf_K(p) ≤ -1`.\n\n5.  This means that for any such line `px+qy=1`, the interval of values `[inf_K(p), sup_K(p)]` must contain the interval `[-1, 1]`.\n\n### Step 4: Reduction to a Centrally Symmetric Domain\nThe width of the convex set `K` in the direction of the vector `p` is `W_K(p) = sup_K(p) - inf_K(p)`. From the result in Step 3, we have `W_K(p) ≥ 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n\nNow, consider the Minkowski symmetral of `K`, defined as `K_s = (K - K)/2`.\n*   `K_s` is a centrally symmetric convex domain (symmetric about the origin).\n*   It is a known property that `Area(K_s) ≤ Area(K)`.\n*   The support function of `K_s`, `h_{K_s}(p)`, which is the maximum projection of `K_s` onto the vector `p`, is equal to half its width: `h_{K_s}(p) = W_K(p) / 2`.\n\nFrom `W_K(p) ≥ 2`, we get `h_{K_s}(p) ≥ 1` for all `p ∈ S'`.\nSo, if `K` is a solution, its symmetral `K_s` must be a centrally symmetric convex set satisfying `h_{K_s}(p) ≥ 1` for all primitive integer vectors `p`, and `Area(K) ≥ Area(K_s)`. This means the minimal area will be achieved by a centrally symmetric set satisfying this stronger condition.\n\n### Step 5: Solving the Problem for a Centrally Symmetric Domain using Duality\nWe need to find the minimum area of a centrally symmetric convex set `K_s` such that its support function `h_{K_s}(p) ≥ 1` for all `p ∈ S'`.\n\nThis problem can be solved using the concept of duality in convex geometry.\n*   The dual of a centrally symmetric convex body `B` is `B* = {u | u·v ≤ 1 for all v ∈ B}`. The condition `h_B(p) ≥ 1` means that the point `p` is not in the interior of the dual body `B*`.\n*   So, the dual of our desired set, `(K_s)^*`, must be a centrally symmetric convex body whose interior contains no primitive integer lattice points.\n*   We want to minimize `Area(K_s)`. By the Blaschke-Santaló inequality, for a centrally symmetric convex body `B` in the plane, `Area(B)·Area(B*) ≥ 8` (with equality for parallelograms). To minimize `Area(K_s)`, we need to maximize `Area((K_s)^*)`.\n*   So the problem is now: **Find the centrally symmetric convex body `C` of maximum area whose interior contains no primitive integer lattice points.**\n*   By Minkowski's first theorem, any centrally symmetric convex body with area greater than 4 must contain a non-zero integer lattice point `z`. If this point is in the interior, then the primitive point `z/gcd(z)` is also in the interior. Therefore, `Area(C)` must be at most 4.\n*   The square `C = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]` is a centrally symmetric convex body with area 4. Its interior `(-1, 1) × (-1, 1)` contains no non-zero integer points, and thus no primitive integer points.\n*   So, the maximum possible area for `(K_s)^*` is 4.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Minimal Area\nWe choose `(K_s)^*` to be the square `[-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`. Since this is a parallelogram, the equality `Area(K_s)·Area((K_s)^*) = 8` holds.\n`Area(K_s) = 8 / Area((K_s)^*) = 8 / 4 = 2`.\n\nThe minimum possible area for `K_s` is 2. Since `Area(K) ≥ Area(K_s)`, the minimal area for `K` is at least 2.\n\n### Step 7: Verifying a Candidate Solution\nWe need to show that an area of 2 is achievable. The set `K_s` that is dual to the square `[-1, 1] × [-1, 1]` is the rotated square (a diamond shape) defined by:\n`K_0 = {(x,y) | |x| + |y| ≤ 1}`\nThe vertices of this square are at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`. Its area is `(1/2) * d1 * d2 = (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2`.\n\nLet's check if `K_0` intersects `px+qy=1` for all coprime `(p,q)`.\nThe support function of `K_0` is `h_{K_0}(p,q) = sup {px+qy | |x|+|y|≤1} = max(|p|, |q|)`.\nSince `K_0` is centrally symmetric, the interval of values is `[-max(|p|,|q|), max(|p|,|q|)]`.\nThe condition for intersection is `1 ≤ max(|p|,|q|)`.\nFor any pair of coprime integers `(p,q)`, they cannot both be zero. So at least one of them has an absolute value of at least 1. Thus, `max(|p|,|q|) ≥ 1`.\nThe condition is satisfied.\n\nConclusion: The minimal area is 2, and it is achieved by the convex domain `K = {(x,y) | |x|+|y| ≤ 1}`."
