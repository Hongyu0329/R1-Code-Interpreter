    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe question asks whether free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light. To answer this, we need to understand the physical requirements for SPDC and the material properties of boron nanosheets.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **The Physics of SPDC:** Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process. In this process, a high-energy \"pump\" photon, passing through a suitable nonlinear medium, spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons, conventionally called the \"signal\" and \"idler.\"\n2.  **The Material Requirement for SPDC:** The occurrence of second-order nonlinear optical phenomena, including SPDC and second-harmonic generation (SHG), is governed by the material's second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, denoted as χ⁽²⁾.\n3.  **Symmetry Condition:** A fundamental principle in nonlinear optics is that for the χ⁽²⁾ tensor to be non-zero in the electric-dipole approximation, the material's crystal structure must lack a center of inversion. Such materials are called non-centrosymmetric. In materials that are centrosymmetric (possessing a center of inversion), χ⁽²⁾ is identically zero, and thus second-order nonlinear effects like SPDC are forbidden in the bulk of the material.\n4.  **Structure of Boron Nanosheets:** Boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are two-dimensional allotropes of boron. Unlike graphene, which has a single stable honeycomb structure, borophene exists in several different atomic arrangements (polymorphs). The most common and experimentally synthesized phases are the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases, typically grown on a silver substrate.\n5.  **Symmetry of Boron Nanosheets:** The critical step is to determine the crystal symmetry of these borophene structures. Both the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases of borophene, which are the most widely studied, have been shown to have an orthorhombic crystal structure belonging to the space group *Pmmn*.\n6.  **\"Free-standing\" Condition:** The question specifies \"free-standing\" nanosheets. This is important because it means we must consider the intrinsic symmetry of the borophene layer itself, without any symmetry-breaking influence from a substrate.\n7.  **Possible Exceptions:** While the bulk material properties are dominant, one must also consider other potential contributions. Symmetry is broken at the edges of a finite sheet, and defects or applied strain could also break the inversion symmetry locally. Furthermore, higher-order effects (like electric quadrupole contributions) can exist even in centrosymmetric materials, but they are typically several orders of magnitude weaker than the electric-dipole-driven processes and are not what is generally meant by SPDC.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Confirm the Process:** The process in question is spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC).\n2.  **Identify the Key Material Property:** SPDC relies on a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility, χ⁽²⁾.\n3.  **State the Symmetry Rule:** A non-zero χ⁽²⁾ requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n4.  **Examine Boron Nanosheet's Structure:** We look at the established crystal structures of the most stable, free-standing borophene polymorphs, specifically the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases.\n5.  **Determine the Crystal Symmetry:** Both the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases of borophene belong to the space group *Pmmn*.\n6.  **Check for Inversion Symmetry in *Pmmn*:** The space group *Pmmn* is centrosymmetric. It contains inversion centers within its unit cell.\n7.  **Apply the Symmetry Rule to Boron Nanosheets:** Since the intrinsic crystal structure of common boron nanosheets is centrosymmetric, their bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) must be zero.\n8.  **Draw the Final Conclusion:** Because their χ⁽²⁾ is zero, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit the standard, electric-dipole-mediated spontaneous parametric downconversion. The material lacks the necessary non-centrosymmetric crystal structure required for this nonlinear optical effect.\n\n<<<No>>>"
