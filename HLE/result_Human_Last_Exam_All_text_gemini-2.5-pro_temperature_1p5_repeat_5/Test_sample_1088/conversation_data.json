    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Basis Set Name: 6-311G**\n\nThe name of a Pople-style basis set encodes how the atomic orbitals are constructed from primitive Gaussian functions.\n*   **G**: Indicates that Gaussian-type functions are used.\n*   **Split-Valence description (6-311)**: This part describes how core and valence electrons are treated. The number of primitives depends on the atom (e.g., a first-row atom like Hydrogen vs. a second-row atom like Carbon).\n    *   **6-**: This prefix describes the *core* orbitals. It means each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function, which is a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions. This applies only to heavy atoms (non-Hydrogen).\n    *   **-311**: This describes the *valence* orbitals. The valence shell is \"split\" into three parts, represented by three separate contracted functions.\n        *   The first function (inner valence) is a contraction of **3** primitive Gaussians.\n        *   The second function (middle valence) is a single, uncontracted **1** primitive Gaussian.\n        *   The third function (outer valence) is also a single, uncontracted **1** primitive Gaussian.\n*   **Polarization Functions (**)**: The asterisks indicate the addition of polarization functions, which allow for more flexible orbital shapes and are crucial for describing chemical bonds accurately.\n    *   The first asterisk (`*`) adds a single set of **d-type** polarization functions to heavy atoms (all atoms other than H and He).\n    *   The second asterisk (`*`) adds a single set of **p-type** polarization functions to light atoms (H and He).\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points\n\n1.  **Atom Dependence**: The number of primitive Gaussians is not a single value for the entire basis set; it is defined on a **per-atom** basis. The rules are different for hydrogen versus heavier atoms.\n2.  **Core vs. Valence**: It's important to correctly identify which electrons are core and which are valence for a given atom.\n3.  **Number of p and d functions**: A set of p-functions (px, py, pz) consists of 3 functions. A set of d-functions, by default in most quantum chemistry software, consists of 6 Cartesian functions (dxx, dyy, dzz, dxy, dxz, dyz), not the 5 \"pure\" spherical harmonic functions. Each of these polarization functions is a single primitive Gaussian.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze for a Second-Row Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon)\n\nA Carbon atom has the electron configuration 1s², 2s²2p².\n*   **Core orbital (1s):** The `6-` rule applies. The 1s orbital is represented by one contracted function made from **6** primitive s-type Gaussians.\n*   **Valence orbitals (2s and 2p):** The `-311` rule applies to both the 2s and 2p orbitals.\n    *   **For the 2s orbital:** It is described by three functions, which are composed of (3 + 1 + 1) = **5** primitive s-type Gaussians.\n    *   **For the 2p orbitals (px, py, pz):** Each of the three p orbitals is described similarly. The total number of primitive p-type Gaussians is 3 × (3 + 1 + 1) = 3 × 5 = **15** primitive p-type Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization functions (`*`):** The first asterisk adds a set of d-functions. This is a set of **6** primitive d-type Gaussians. The second asterisk has no effect on heavy atoms.\n\n**Total Primitive Gaussians for a Second-Row Heavy Atom:**\nTotal = (Primitives for 1s) + (Primitives for 2s) + (Primitives for 2p) + (Primitives for d-pol)\nTotal = 6 + 5 + 15 + 6 = **32**\n\n### Step 4: Analyze for a Hydrogen Atom\n\nA Hydrogen atom has the electron configuration 1s¹. It has no core electrons.\n*   **Valence orbital (1s):** The `6-` prefix does not apply. The `311` rule describes the 1s valence orbital. It is represented by three functions composed of (3 + 1 + 1) = **5** primitive s-type Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization functions (`**`):** The second asterisk adds a set of p-functions to hydrogen. This is a set of **3** primitive p-type Gaussians (px, py, pz).\n\n**Total Primitive Gaussians for a Hydrogen Atom:**\nTotal = (Primitives for 1s) + (Primitives for p-pol)\nTotal = 5 + 3 = **8**\n\n### Final Answer Summary\n\nThe number of primitive Gaussians in the 6-311G** basis set depends on the identity of the atom.\n*   For each second-row heavy atom (like C, N, O, F): **32 primitive Gaussians**.\n*   For each hydrogen atom: **8 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n<<<A 6-311G** basis set contains 32 primitive Gaussians for each second-row heavy atom (Li-Ne) and 8 primitive Gaussians for each hydrogen atom.>>>"
