    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the pitch accent of 「弟」.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Word and its Reading:**\n    The word in question is the kanji 「弟」. Its standard Japanese reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n2.  **Determine the Morae:**\n    Pitch accent in Japanese is based on morae (the basic rhythmic units of sound, roughly equivalent to a short syllable). We must break down 「おとうと」 into its morae:\n    *   お (o) - 1st mora\n    *   と (to) - 2nd mora\n    *   う (u) - 3rd mora (This is the long vowel part of \"to-u\")\n    *   と (to) - 4th mora\n    So, 「おとうと」 is a four-mora word.\n\n3.  **Consult Standard Pitch Accent Resources:**\n    To find the standard pitch accent, we refer to Japanese pitch accent dictionaries (based on the Tokyo dialect, which is considered the standard). For the word 「おとうと」, the pitch accent is designated with the number [0].\n\n4.  **Interpret the Pitch Accent Notation [0]:**\n    The numerical notation corresponds to specific pitch patterns:\n    *   **[0]**: This indicates a **Heiban (平板)** pattern. The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word and any following grammatical particles.\n    *   **[1]**: This indicates an **Atamadaka (頭高)** pattern. The pitch is high only on the first mora and then drops.\n    *   **[2], [3], etc.**: These indicate a **Nakadaka (中高)** pattern. The number shows which mora has the last high pitch before the drop. For example, in a [2] word, the second mora is high and the pitch drops on the third.\n    *   **Odaka (尾高)**: This pattern is where the pitch rises after the first mora and stays high until the end of the word, dropping on a following particle. It is denoted by a number equal to the number of morae in the word (e.g., [4] for a 4-mora word).\n\n5.  **Apply the Pattern to 「弟」 (おとうと):**\n    Since the notation for 「おとうと」 is [0], it follows the Heiban pattern. Let's visualize this with the particle 「が」 (ga):\n    *   お (low)\n    *   と (high)\n    *   う (high)\n    *   と (high)\n    *   が (high)\n    The pitch can be represented as: L-H-H-H-(H). The pitch does not fall.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the standard [0] notation, the pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (おとうと) is Heiban.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Morae vs. Syllables:** It's crucial to count morae, not syllables. The long vowel in 「とう」 (tou) consists of two morae (to + u).\n*   **Heiban vs. Odaka:** The primary difference between Heiban and Odaka is the pitch of a following particle. In Heiban, the particle is high. In Odaka, the particle is low. Since the particle following 「おとうと」 remains high, it is classified as Heiban.\n*   **Standard Accent:** The question asks for the \"standard\" pattern, which refers to the Tokyo dialect. Pitch accent can vary significantly in other dialects of Japanese.\n\nMatching our conclusion to the answer choices, the correct pattern is Heiban.\n\n<<<A>>>"
