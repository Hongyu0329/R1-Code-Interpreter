    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the current word and its origin.**\n    The Modern English word is \"sister\". Its etymology traces back to the Middle English \"sister,\" which was borrowed from the Old Norse word \"systir.\" This borrowing occurred due to the extensive interaction, settlement, and linguistic blending between the Old Norse-speaking Vikings and the Old English-speaking Anglo-Saxons.\n\n2.  **Identify the original Anglo-Saxon word.**\n    Before the Norse influence, the native Old English word for the same concept was \"sweostor.\" This word shares a common ancestor with the Old Norse \"systir\" in the Proto-Germanic word *\\*swestēr*, which itself comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *\\*swésōr*. The question asks what \"sweostor\" would have become in Modern English if it had not been replaced by the Norse-derived \"sister.\"\n\n3.  **Analyze the likely phonetic evolution of \"sweostor\".**\n    To predict how \"sweostor\" would have evolved, we can look at two things:\n    a) How other Old English words with similar sounds evolved into Modern English.\n    b) Actual documented forms of the word that existed in Middle English dialects, particularly those with less Norse influence (like in the South and West of England).\n\n4.  **Examine the evolution of the word's components.**\n    *   **The \"sw-\" beginning:** In some words, the \"sw-\" sound was simplified to \"s-\". For example, Old English `swā` became `so`. However, in many other cases, it was retained, as in `swimman` -> `swim` or `sweord` -> `sword`. The Dutch word for sister is `zuster`, showing a simplification, while the German word is `Schwester`, which retains a related consonant cluster. In Middle English, forms with and without the \"w\" are recorded. Dialects in the south and west of England, which had less Norse contact, often used the simplified form \"suster\" or \"soster.\"\n    *   **The \"-eo-\" vowel:** The Old English short diphthong `eo` had a complex evolution. In many cases, it changed to `u` or `o` in Middle English. The Old English \"sweostor\" is documented as becoming Middle English \"suster\" or \"soster.\"\n    *   **The \"-or\" ending:** Unstressed endings in Old English were often reduced to `-er` in Middle and Modern English. This is seen in other kinship terms like `mōdor` -> `mother` and `brōþor` -> `brother`. Therefore, the `-or` in `sweostor` would very likely have become `-er`.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the most likely modern form.**\n    Combining these points, the Old English \"sweostor\" would have likely evolved into a Middle English form like \"suster.\" This form was, in fact, common in dialects not heavily influenced by Norse. Following the pattern of similar words (like `dust`, `rust`), the \"u\" in \"suster\" would most likely come to be pronounced with the STRUT vowel /ʌ/, the same sound as in \"brother\" or \"mother.\"\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion.**\n    Without the influence of the Old Norse \"systir,\" the native Old English \"sweostor\" would have undergone natural phonetic changes. The most probable evolutionary path, supported by documented dialectal forms in Middle English, would have led to a standardized Modern English word spelled **Suster** and pronounced to rhyme with \"duster.\"\n\n***\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Counterfactual Nature:** This is a linguistic thought experiment. We can't know for certain, but we can make a highly educated guess based on established patterns of language change.\n*   **Dialectal Variation:** English has always had significant dialectal differences. In our hypothetical timeline, perhaps \"Swester\" might have survived in some regions while \"Suster\" became the standard, or vice versa. The choice of \"Suster\" is based on it being a common, simplified form that appeared in areas less impacted by the historical event in question.\n*   **The Great Vowel Shift:** The pronunciation of \"suster\" would have been affected by this major sound change in the late Middle English / Early Modern English period, leading to the /ʌ/ vowel sound (as in \"cup\").\n*   **Standardization:** The process of standardizing English spelling and vocabulary, heavily influenced by the London dialect, printing, and later dictionaries, would have eventually picked one dominant form. \"Suster\" is a strong candidate for what that form would have been.\n\n***\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Suster}$."
