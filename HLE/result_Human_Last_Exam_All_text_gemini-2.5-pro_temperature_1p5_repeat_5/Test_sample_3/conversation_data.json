    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The goal is to find the maximum possible size (order) of the torsion subgroup, $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$, of an elliptic curve $E$ defined over the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, with the condition that this subgroup must be non-cyclic.\n\n2.  **Structure of Torsion Subgroups:**\n    *   For any elliptic curve $E$ defined over a number field $K$, the torsion subgroup $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ is a finite abelian group.\n    *   By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ is isomorphic to a direct sum of two cyclic groups:\n        $E(K)_{\\text{tors}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$\n        where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $m$ divides $n$.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The group is cyclic if and only if $m=1$. The question asks for non-cyclic subgroups, so we are interested in cases where $m > 1$.\n\n3.  **Classification of Torsion Subgroups over Quadratic Fields:**\n    *   While Mazur's theorem classifies torsion subgroups over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, we need the classification for quadratic number fields. The possible torsion structures for elliptic curves over quadratic fields have been completely classified by the work of S. Kenku and F. Momose.\n    *   A list of all possible groups includes the ones from Mazur's theorem plus several others that can only appear over number fields of degree 2 or higher.\n\n4.  **Focus on the Specific Field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:**\n    *   The general list of possible torsion groups over any quadratic field is extensive. However, specific torsion structures can often only be realized over very specific quadratic fields.\n    *   The field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is a special case. It is the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$ containing the 3rd roots of unity. Its ring of integers is $\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{-1+\\sqrt{-3}}{2}]$, which is a unique factorization domain (UFD) and a principal ideal domain (PID). This field is the field of complex multiplication for elliptic curves with j-invariant 0.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must use the classification of torsion groups that are known to be possible specifically over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n5.  **List Possible Torsion Groups over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:**\n    Based on established results in number theory (and verifiable in databases like the LMFDB), the possible torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve defined over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n    *   **Cyclic Groups:** $\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 18\\}$.\n    *   **Non-Cyclic Groups:**\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n\n6.  **Identify Orders of Non-Cyclic Groups:**\n    The question asks for the *largest order* of a *non-cyclic* group. We calculate the order (size) of each of the non-cyclic groups listed above:\n    *   Order of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    *   Order of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ is $2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n    *   Order of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ is $2 \\times 6 = 12$.\n    *   Order of $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n    *   Order of $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n7.  **Determine the Largest Order:**\n    By comparing the orders calculated in the previous step {4, 8, 12, 9, 36}, the maximum value is 36.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe largest possible order for a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ corresponds to the group $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. It is a known result that this specific torsion structure is realizable over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, and in fact, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is the *only* quadratic field over which this group can be realized as the full torsion subgroup.\n\nThe final answer is the order of this group.\n\n<<<36>>>"
