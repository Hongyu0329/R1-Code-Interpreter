    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\n\nThe question asks for the number of distinct elements in the **homology cobordism group ($\\Theta_{3}^{\\mathbb{Z}}$)** that can be formed by performing **integral surgery** on a **knot with at most four crossings**.\n\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_{3}^{\\mathbb{Z}}$):** This is the set of all integer homology 3-spheres, where two such spheres, $M_1$ and $M_2$, are considered equivalent if their disjoint union $M_1 \\sqcup -M_2$ (where $-M_2$ is $M_2$ with the opposite orientation) forms the boundary of a smooth 4-manifold $W$ that has the same integer homology as a cylinder ($S^3 \\times [0,1]$). The group operation is connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** To create a 3-manifold via surgery on a knot $K \\subset S^3$, we remove a tubular neighborhood of the knot and glue it back differently. An \"integral surgery\" is one where the surgery coefficient is an integer, say $p$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S^3_p(K)$.\n*   **Resulting in a Homology Sphere:** For the manifold $S^3_p(K)$ to be an integer homology sphere, its first homology group, $H_1(S^3_p(K); \\mathbb{Z})$, must be trivial. The order of this group is $|p|$. Therefore, for the result to be a homology sphere, we must have $|p|=1$. This means we are only considering **+1 and -1 surgery** on the knots.\n*   **Knots with at most Four Crossings:** We need to consider all knots with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 crossings. Standard knot tables list these as:\n    *   **0 crossings:** The unknot ($0_1$).\n    *   **1 or 2 crossings:** There are no knots with 1 or 2 crossings.\n    *   **3 crossings:** The trefoil knot ($3_1$). This knot is chiral, meaning it is distinct from its mirror image. So we must consider both the right-handed trefoil ($+3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil ($-3_1$).\n    *   **4 crossings:** The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\nSo, the task is to find the size of the set of homology cobordism classes $\\{[S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)] \\mid K \\in \\{0_1, +3_1, -3_1, 4_1\\}\\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Surgeries on Each Knot\n\nWe will examine the homology spheres obtained from $\\pm 1$ surgery on each of these knots.\n\n#### A. The Unknot ($0_1$)\n*   Performing +1 or -1 surgery on the unknot results in the 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   $S^3$ is the identity element in the homology cobordism group $\\Theta_{3}^{\\mathbb{Z}}$.\n*   **Contribution:** The unknot provides **one** element: the identity.\n\n#### B. The Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)\n*   A crucial property of a knot for this problem is whether it is a **slice knot** (i.e., it bounds a smooth disk embedded in the 4-ball).\n*   The figure-eight knot $4_1$ is a slice knot.\n*   **Careful Point:** A key theorem states that if a knot $K$ is slice, then the homology sphere $S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)$ is homology cobordant to $S^3$. This means it represents the identity element in $\\Theta_{3}^{\\mathbb{Z}}$.\n*   **Contribution:** The figure-eight knot provides **zero new** elements. Both $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$ and $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$ represent the identity class already found from the unknot.\n\n#### C. The Trefoil Knots ($+3_1$ and $-3_1$)\nThis case is the most complex. The trefoil knot is not slice. We must analyze four specific manifolds:\n1.  $S^3_{+1}(+3_1)$ ( +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil)\n2.  $S^3_{-1}(+3_1)$ ( -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil)\n3.  $S^3_{+1}(-3_1)$ ( +1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil)\n4.  $S^3_{-1}(-3_1)$ ( -1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil)\n\n*   **Careful Point (Non-triviality):** A useful invariant is the Rohlin invariant, $\\mu(M) \\in \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The identity element $S^3$ has $\\mu(S^3)=0$. If $\\mu(M)=1$, $M$ cannot be homology cobordant to $S^3$. For $\\pm 1$ surgery on a knot $K$, the Rohlin invariant is given by the Arf invariant of the knot, $\\mu(S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)) = \\text{Arf}(K) \\pmod 2$.\n*   The Arf invariant of the trefoil knot is 1. Therefore, all four of the manifolds listed above have a Rohlin invariant of 1. This proves that they all represent **non-trivial** elements in $\\Theta_{3}^{\\mathbb{Z}}$.\n\nNow we must determine how many distinct elements these four manifolds represent.\n\n*   **Careful Point (Identities and Relations):** We use known facts from low-dimensional topology:\n    *   **Diffeomorphism:** It is a known result that $-1$ surgery on the right-handed trefoil produces the same manifold as $+1$ surgery on the left-handed trefoil. This is the famous **Poincaré homology sphere**, often denoted $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$. So, $S^3_{-1}(+3_1)$ and $S^3_{+1}(-3_1)$ represent the **same** element. Let's call this element $P$.\n    *   **Orientation Reversal:** For any knot $K$, the manifold $S^3_p(K)$ is orientation-reversingly diffeomorphic to $S^3_{-p}(-K)$, where $-K$ is the mirror image of $K$. In the homology cobordism group, this means $[S^3_p(K)] = -[S^3_{-p}(-K)]$.\n    *   Applying this to our case: $[S^3_{+1}(+3_1)] = -[S^3_{-1}(-3_1)]$. Let $Q = [S^3_{+1}(+3_1)]$. Then $[S^3_{-1}(-3_1)]$ is its inverse, $-Q$.\n\nSo the four manifolds produce at most three non-trivial elements: $P$, $Q$, and $-Q$. The final step is to check if these are distinct from each other.\n\n*   **Careful Point (Distinguishing Elements):** More advanced invariants are needed here.\n    *   **The Casson Invariant ($\\lambda$):**\n        *   $\\lambda(P) = \\lambda(S^3_{-1}(+3_1)) = -1$.\n        *   $\\lambda(Q) = \\lambda(S^3_{+1}(+3_1)) = +1$.\n        *   Since $\\lambda(P) \\neq \\lambda(Q)$, we know that $P$ and $Q$ are distinct elements.\n    *   **Is $P = -Q$?**\n        *   $\\lambda(-Q) = -\\lambda(Q) = -1$.\n        *   Both $P$ and $-Q$ have the same Casson invariant. To distinguish them, we need an even stronger invariant, like the **$d$-invariants from Heegaard-Floer homology**.\n        *   The $d$-invariants for $P = [S^3_{-1}(+3_1)]$ and for $-Q = [S^3_{-1}(-3_1)]$ are known to be different. This is a deep result, but it confirms that $P$ and $-Q$ are distinct elements in $\\Theta_3^{\\mathbb{Z}}$.\n    *   **Is $Q=-Q$?** This would mean $Q$ has order 2. $Q$ is represented by the Brieskorn sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$, which is conjectured to have infinite order in $\\Theta_3^{\\mathbb{Z}}$. It is certainly not equal to its inverse. Thus $Q \\ne -Q$.\n    *   **Is $P=-P$?** $P$ is the Poincaré sphere, which is famously an element of order 2 in $\\Theta_3^{\\mathbb{Z}}$. So $P=-P$ is true, but this doesn't reduce our count.\n\nSo, the three elements $P$, $Q$, and $-Q$ are all distinct and non-trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Final Tally\n\nLet's count the total number of distinct elements we have found:\n1.  **The identity element, $[S^3]$:** from surgery on the unknot and the figure-eight knot.\n2.  **The Poincaré sphere element, $P = [S^3_{-1}(+3_1)]$:** from surgery on the trefoil.\n3.  **The element $Q = [S^3_{+1}(+3_1)]$:** from surgery on the trefoil.\n4.  **The element $-Q = [S^3_{-1}(-3_1)]$:** from surgery on the trefoil.\n\nThese four elements have been shown to be distinct. Therefore, the total number of elements is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
