    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the User's Request:**\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the radical (部首, bushu) for the kanji 謄.\n    *   **Format:** Provide the name of the radical using Hepburn transcription.\n    *   **Example:** For the character 媛, the radical is 女 on the left (hen), so the answer is \"Onnahen\". This indicates that the common name, which often includes the radical's position, is required.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Kanji 謄:**\n    *   Visually, the character 謄 appears to be composed of two parts: a left side and a right side.\n    *   The left side is ⺼, which is a variant of the radical 月. This form is often called にくづき (nikuzuki) and is derived from the radical 肉 (niku), meaning \"flesh\".\n    *   The right side is 朕 (chin).\n    *   A purely visual decomposition might lead one to believe the radical is 月 (tsuki / nikuzuki).\n\n3.  **Determine the Official Radical:**\n    *   The visual appearance of a kanji can sometimes be misleading. The official radical is determined by the character's etymology and its classification in standard dictionaries (like the Kangxi dictionary).\n    *   The meaning of 謄 is \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe\". This meaning is strongly related to \"words\" or \"speech\".\n    *   Consulting authoritative Japanese character dictionaries (e.g., Jisho.org, Kanji Jiten Online) reveals that the official radical for 謄 is **言**.\n    *   The character 謄 is a phono-semantic compound (形声文字).\n        *   **Semantic component (meaning):** 言 (gen/gon) - \"words\", \"speech\".\n        *   **Phonetic component (sound):** The rest of the character provides the sound.\n    *   Over time, the shape of the character has been simplified, and the 言 component is no longer visually obvious in the modern typeface. However, it remains classified under the 言 radical.\n\n4.  **Identify the Name of the Radical:**\n    *   The radical is **言**.\n    *   The next step is to find its common Japanese name and transcribe it.\n    *   The radical 言 most commonly appears on the left side of a character (e.g., in 話, 語, 説).\n    *   When a radical is on the left side, it is called a \"hen\" (偏), which can also be read as \"ben\".\n    *   The name for the 言 radical when it is on the left is **ごんべん (gonben)**. (言 = gon, 偏 = ben).\n    *   Even though the 言 radical is not positioned on the left side in 謄, \"Gonben\" is the most common and widely recognized name for the 言 radical in general. Dictionaries will group characters like 謄 under the \"Gonben\" heading.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Visual vs. Etymological Radical:** Do not rely solely on the visual parts of a modern kanji. The official radical is often based on the character's origin and meaning.\n*   **Radical Naming Convention:** The name of a radical often includes its typical position (e.g., -hen for left, -kamae for enclosure, -kanmuri for top).\n*   **Common Usage:** The most common name for a radical is often used even for characters where the radical appears in a non-standard position or is not visually apparent. \"Gonben\" is the standard name for the 言 radical.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe official radical for 謄 is 言. The most common name for this radical is ごんべん. The Hepburn transcription of ごんべん is \"Gonben\".\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
