No, it is not possible. According to the Hobart-Derrick scaling argument (or Virial theorem), a localized soliton in 3D cannot be stabilized by only the Heisenberg exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction terms. The total energy functional for a scaled soliton of size $\lambda$ behaves as $E(\lambda) = \lambda E_{ex} + \lambda^2 E_{DM}$. For a stationary solution, the energy must be an extremum at $\lambda=1$, leading to the condition $E_{ex} + 2E_{DM} = 0$. Since the exchange energy $E_{ex}$ must be positive for a non-uniform soliton, the DMI energy $E_{DM}$ must be negative. However, for the solution to be a stable minimum, the second derivative of the energy must be positive, which requires $E_{DM} > 0$. These two conditions are contradictory. Therefore, no stable localized soliton can exist; any such structure would be unstable to either collapse or indefinite expansion.
