    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride ($XeF_4$).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Reaction:**\n    The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride involves the direct reaction of Xenon (Xe) gas and Fluorine ($F_2$) gas.\n    The balanced chemical equation is:\n    $Xe(g) + 2F_2(g) \\rightarrow XeF_4(s)$\n\n2.  **Analyze the Conditions for Synthesis of Xenon Fluorides:**\n    The reaction between Xenon and Fluorine can produce three different stable fluorides: $XeF_2$, $XeF_4$, and $XeF_6$. The specific product that is formed predominantly depends on three key reaction conditions:\n    *   The molar ratio of the reactants (Xe:$F_2$).\n    *   The temperature.\n    *   The pressure.\n\n3.  **Focus on the Synthesis of Xenon Tetrafluoride ($XeF_4$):**\n    To produce $XeF_4$ as the main product, specific conditions must be met to ensure the reaction proceeds past the formation of $XeF_2$ but does not go all the way to $XeF_6$.\n    *   **Stoichiometry:** A molar excess of fluorine is required. The standard literature method uses a Xe:$F_2$ ratio of approximately 1:5.\n    *   **Temperature:** The reaction requires a significant input of thermal energy to overcome the activation energy and proceed at a reasonable rate.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Role of Temperature and the Meaning of \"Efficient\":**\n    *   The term \"efficiently\" implies that the reaction must occur at a practical rate and give a good yield of the desired product, $XeF_4$.\n    *   **If the temperature is too low:** The kinetic energy of the reactant molecules will be insufficient to overcome the activation energy barrier. As a result, the reaction rate will be extremely slow, making the synthesis impractical and therefore not \"efficient\". For example, at temperatures like 0°C or -78°C, the reaction is essentially frozen.\n    *   **If the temperature is too high:** While the reaction rate might be very fast, it could lead to the formation of undesired byproducts like $XeF_6$, or it could cause the decomposition of the $XeF_4$ product.\n    *   Therefore, there is an optimal temperature range for an efficient synthesis.\n\n5.  **Examine Standard Literature Values for the Synthesis:**\n    According to standard inorganic chemistry textbooks and scientific literature (e.g., the original synthesis by Claassen, Selig, and Malm in 1962), the established method for producing $XeF_4$ is to heat a mixture of Xenon and Fluorine (in a 1:5 molar ratio) in a sealed nickel vessel.\n    *   The standard temperature cited for this efficient synthesis is **400°C**. At this temperature, the reaction proceeds smoothly over several hours to give a high yield of crystalline $XeF_4$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. 600 C:** This temperature is higher than necessary and increases the risk of forming other products. It is not the *coldest* efficient temperature.\n    *   **B. 400 C:** This is the well-documented, standard temperature for the efficient production of $XeF_4$.\n    *   **C. 200 C:** At this temperature, the reaction rate would be significantly lower than at 400°C, making the process much less efficient.\n    *   **D. 78 C, E. 0 C, F. -78 C:** These temperatures are far too low for the thermal reaction between Xe and $F_2$ to proceed at any practical or efficient rate.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Product Selectivity:** The conditions must be carefully chosen to favor $XeF_4$ over $XeF_2$ and $XeF_6$.\n*   **Kinetics vs. Thermodynamics:** The reaction is thermodynamically favorable, but it is kinetically hindered at low temperatures, requiring heat to proceed efficiently.\n*   **\"Efficient\" is Key:** This word guides us to look for the established, practical laboratory condition, not a temperature where trace amounts might form over an extremely long time. 400°C provides the best balance of reaction rate and product yield among the choices.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the established chemical literature for the synthesis of noble gas compounds, 400°C is the standard and efficient temperature used to produce Xenon tetrafluoride. While the reaction might proceed very slowly at lower temperatures, 400°C is considered the coldest temperature among the choices at which the production is reliably *efficient*.\n\n<<<B>>>"
