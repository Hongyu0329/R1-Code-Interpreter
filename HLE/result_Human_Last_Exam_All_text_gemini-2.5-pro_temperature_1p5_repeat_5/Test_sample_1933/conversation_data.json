    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Components of the Question\n\n*   **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$. Unary predicates describe properties of single elements.\n*   **Logic $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of first-order logic.\n    *   Formulas are built using only the predicates from $S$.\n    *   The allowed logical connectives are existential quantification ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), true ($\\top$), and false ($\\bot$).\n    *   Negation ($\\lnot$), disjunction ($\\lor$), and universal quantification ($\\forall$) are not allowed.\n    *   We assume standard first-order logic semantics, which includes equality ($=$).\n*   **VC Dimension**: The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension is a measure of the expressive power of a set of classifiers. In this context, the classifiers are the formulas from our logic with one free variable, say $\\phi(x)$.\n\n### Step 2: Define VC Dimension for a Logic\n\nFor a given logic $\\mathcal{L}$ and a fixed schema $S$, the VC dimension is the size of the largest finite set of elements $X$ that can be **shattered** by the formulas in $\\mathcal{L}$.\n\nA set $X = \\{c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k\\}$ is shattered if we can find a single database instance (an $S$-structure) $\\mathcal{A}$ containing $X$ in its domain, such that for **every** possible subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there exists a formula $\\phi_Y(x) \\in \\mathcal{L}$ for which:\n$$ \\{ c \\in X \\mid \\mathcal{A} \\models \\phi_Y(c) \\} = Y $$\nIn other words, the formulas in $\\mathcal{L}$ can \"pick out\" any arbitrary subset of $X$.\n\n### Step 3: Characterize the Formulas in the Logic\n\nLet's analyze the structure of any formula $\\phi(x)$ in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. These formulas are a subset of what are known as **conjunctive queries (CQs)**. A general formula $\\phi(x)$ has the form:\n$$ \\phi(x) := \\exists y_1 \\ldots \\exists y_m . \\psi(x, y_1, \\ldots, y_m) $$\nwhere $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas. Since our schema only has unary predicates, the atomic formulas are of the form $P_i(z)$ or $z_1 = z_2$, where $z, z_1, z_2$ are variables from $\\{x, y_1, \\ldots, y_m\\}$.\n\nThe equality atoms partition the variables into equivalence classes. Any formula $\\phi(x)$ can be rewritten into an equivalent one of the form:\n$$ M(x) \\land C $$\nwhere:\n*   $M(x)$ is a conjunction of all atomic formulas involving the variable $x$ or any variable equivalent to $x$ through a chain of equalities. Since all predicates are unary, $M(x)$ is equivalent to a **monotone conjunction** of the form $P_{i_1}(x) \\land \\dots \\land P_{i_j}(x)$.\n*   $C$ is a **sentence** (a formula with no free variables) that consists of the rest of the original formula. It has the form $\\exists z_1 \\ldots \\exists z_p . \\chi(z_1, \\ldots, z_p)$.\n\nWhen we evaluate $\\phi(x)$ within a fixed database instance $\\mathcal{A}$, the sentence part $C$ is either true for the whole instance or false.\n*   If $\\mathcal{A} \\models C$, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $M(x)$.\n*   If $\\mathcal{A} \\not\\models C$, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bot$ (which defines the empty set).\n\nTherefore, for any fixed structure $\\mathcal{A}$, the set of concepts (subsets of the domain) we can define is limited to those definable by monotone conjunctions of the predicates, plus the empty set.\n\n### Step 4: Relate the Problem to the VC Dimension of Monotone Conjunctions\n\nThe problem now simplifies. The VC dimension of our logic is the VC dimension of the class of concepts definable by monotone conjunctions over the 4 unary predicates. These 4 predicates can be viewed as 4 boolean attributes for each element in the domain.\n\nIt is a standard result in learning theory that the VC dimension of the class of monotone conjunctions over $d$ boolean variables is exactly $d$. In our case, $d=4$.\n\nLet's formally establish this.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Upper Bound**\nThe VC dimension of our logic cannot exceed the VC dimension of monotone conjunctions over 4 variables. Since the VC dimension of the latter is 4, we have:\n$$ \\text{VCdim}(\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]) \\le 4 $$\n\n**Careful Point 2: Lower Bound**\nTo show the VC dimension is at least 4, we must demonstrate that a set of size 4 can be shattered. This involves constructing a specific database instance $\\mathcal{A}$ with a set of 4 elements $X = \\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\\}$ and showing that for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there's a formula $\\phi_Y(x)$ in our logic that picks out exactly $Y$. We can do this using only quantifier-free monotone conjunctions.\n\n1.  **Construct the Database Instance $\\mathcal{A}$**:\n    Let the universe be $X = \\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\\}$.\n    We define the extensions of the predicates $P_1, \\dots, P_4$ based on the vector representation $\\mathbf{1} - e_i$, where $\\mathbf{1}=(1,1,1,1)$ and $e_i$ is the $i$-th standard basis vector.\n    *   Type of $c_1$: $(0,1,1,1)$. $P_1$ is false, $P_2, P_3, P_4$ are true.\n    *   Type of $c_2$: $(1,0,1,1)$. $P_2$ is false, $P_1, P_3, P_4$ are true.\n    *   Type of $c_3$: $(1,1,0,1)$. $P_3$ is false, $P_1, P_2, P_4$ are true.\n    *   Type of $c_4$: $(1,1,1,0)$. $P_4$ is false, $P_1, P_2, P_3$ are true.\n\n2.  **Show Shattering**:\n    Let $Y \\subseteq X$ be an arbitrary target subset. Let $I_Y = \\{i \\mid c_i \\in Y\\}$ be the index set of elements in $Y$.\n    We need to find a formula $\\phi_Y(x)$ that is true for $c_i$ if and only if $i \\in I_Y$.\n\n    Consider the formula:\n    $$ \\phi_Y(x) := \\bigwedge_{j \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\setminus I_Y} P_j(x) $$\n    This is a monotone conjunction, which is a valid formula in our logic.\n\n    Let's test this formula on an element $c_k \\in X$:\n    *   $\\mathcal{A} \\models \\phi_Y(c_k)$ if and only if for all $j \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\setminus I_Y$, $\\mathcal{A} \\models P_j(c_k)$.\n    *   By our construction of $\\mathcal{A}$, $P_j(c_k)$ is false if and only if $j=k$.\n    *   So, the conjunction is true if and only if for all $j \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\setminus I_Y$, we have $j \\neq k$.\n    *   This condition is equivalent to stating that $k$ is not in the set $\\{1,2,3,4\\} \\setminus I_Y$.\n    *   This is equivalent to $k \\in I_Y$.\n\n    So, $\\mathcal{A} \\models \\phi_Y(c_k) \\iff c_k \\in Y$. This construction works for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$. Therefore, the set $X$ of size 4 is shattered. This proves that:\n    $$ \\text{VCdim}(\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]) \\ge 4 $$\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the upper and lower bounds:\n*   VCdim $\\le 4$\n*   VCdim $\\ge 4$\n\nThe VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is exactly 4."
