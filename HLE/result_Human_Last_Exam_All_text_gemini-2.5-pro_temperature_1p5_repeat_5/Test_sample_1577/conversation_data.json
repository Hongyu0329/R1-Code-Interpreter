    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code with $n$ smooth holes and $m$ rough holes.\n\n**1. Understanding the Toric Code and Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD)**\n\nThe toric code is a topological stabilizer code. Its Hamiltonian is a sum of commuting operators, $H = -\\sum_s A_s - \\sum_p B_p$, where $A_s$ are star operators (product of $\\sigma^x$ on edges meeting at a vertex $s$) and $B_p$ are plaquette operators (product of $\\sigma^z$ on edges of a face $p$).\n\nThe ground states are the states that are +1 eigenstates of all stabilizer operators ($A_s$ and $B_p$). The GSD is the number of linearly independent ground states. This number is determined by the topology of the surface on which the code is defined. Specifically, it's equal to $2^k$, where $k$ is the number of logical qubits.\n\n**2. Understanding the Surface and Boundaries**\n\nThe problem specifies a surface with \"$n$ smooth holes and $m$ rough holes\". This is typically interpreted as starting with a simple surface (like a sphere or a plane) and creating punctures or removing regions. The edges of these holes form boundaries.\n\n*   **Smooth Boundary:** At a smooth boundary, the plaquette operators $B_p$ that would cross the boundary are removed from the Hamiltonian. The star operators $A_s$ are kept for all vertices, including those on the boundary. A physical consequence is that electric-like anyons (violations of $B_p$) can be created or annihilated at a smooth boundary without energy cost. A string of $\\sigma^z$ operators can terminate on a smooth boundary without creating an excitation.\n\n*   **Rough Boundary:** At a rough boundary, the star operators $A_s$ for vertices on the boundary are removed from the Hamiltonian. The plaquette operators $B_p$ are kept for all plaquettes. A physical consequence is that magnetic-like anyons (violations of $A_s$) can be created or annihilated at a rough boundary without energy cost. A string of $\\sigma^x$ operators can terminate on a rough boundary without creating an excitation.\n\n**3. The Formula for GSD on a Surface with Boundaries**\n\nFor the toric code on a surface of genus $g$ with $n_s$ smooth boundary components and $n_r$ rough boundary components, the number of logical qubits $k$ is given by a well-known formula in topological quantum computation literature:\n$k = 2g + n_s + n_r - 1$\n\nThe GSD is therefore $2^k = 2^{2g + n_s + n_r - 1}$.\n\n**4. Applying the Formula to the Specific Problem**\n\nThe problem statement \"with n smooth holes and m rough holes\" is most commonly interpreted in the context of a planar code, meaning the code is laid out on a 2D plane (or equivalently, a disk, which is a sphere with one large hole). The $n$ smooth and $m$ rough holes are then additional holes within this disk.\n\n*   The initial surface is a plane (or disk), which has a genus $g=0$.\n*   The $n$ smooth holes contribute $n$ smooth boundary components.\n*   The $m$ rough holes contribute $m$ rough boundary components.\n*   The crucial point is that the plane/disk itself has an outer boundary. The nature of this outer boundary needs to be considered. Let's analyze the two possibilities for the outer boundary:\n\n    *   **Case 1: The outer boundary is smooth.**\n        In this case, the total number of smooth boundaries is $n_s = n + 1$.\n        The total number of rough boundaries is $n_r = m$.\n        The number of logical qubits is $k = 2g + n_s + n_r - 1 = 2(0) + (n+1) + m - 1 = n+m$.\n\n    *   **Case 2: The outer boundary is rough.**\n        In this case, the total number of smooth boundaries is $n_s = n$.\n        The total number of rough boundaries is $n_r = m + 1$.\n        The number of logical qubits is $k = 2g + n_s + n_r - 1 = 2(0) + n + (m+1) - 1 = n+m$.\n\nIn both cases, the number of logical qubits is $k = n+m$.\n\n**5. Calculating the Final Ground Space Degeneracy**\n\nThe ground space degeneracy is $2^k$. With $k=n+m$, the GSD is $2^{n+m}$.\n\nThis result matches option A among the choices.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n\n*   **Model:** Assumed to be the standard Toric Code.\n*   **Surface:** The term \"holes\" implies punctures on a larger surface. Interpreting this as a planar code (a disk with inner holes) is a standard and consistent approach. A disk has genus $g=0$.\n*   **Boundaries:** Correctly identified that smooth/rough holes correspond to boundary components with specific properties. Crucially, remembered to account for the outer boundary of the planar patch.\n*   **GSD Formula:** Used the established formula $k=2g+n_s+n_r-1$ for the number of logical qubits for a mixed-boundary scenario.\n*   **Calculation:** Performed the substitution correctly for the two possible types of the outer boundary and found the result to be independent of that choice.\n*   **Final Answer:** Derived the GSD as $2^{n+m}$.\n\nFinal answer is $2^{m+n}$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
