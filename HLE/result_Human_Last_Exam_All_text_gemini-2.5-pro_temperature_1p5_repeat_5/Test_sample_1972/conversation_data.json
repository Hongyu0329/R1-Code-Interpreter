    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Source:** The quote and description come from Jorge Luis Borges.\n    *   **Clue 1 (Description of the novel):** It has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\" This suggests a work that is both tense and intellectually complex.\n    *   **Clue 2 (Description of the author):** Borges considers him a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\" This points to a 20th-century author whose style is influenced by William Faulkner's modernism (e.g., complex narrative structures, psychological depth) but is perhaps more direct or concise.\n\n2.  **Locate the Source Text:**\n    *   The two clues are very specific and likely come from a single text by Borges, probably a prologue or a critical essay where he introduces another author's work.\n    *   A search for the phrases \"Borges intensity of a tiger\" and \"Borges continuator Faulkner\" points directly to a prologue he wrote in 1961.\n\n3.  **Identify the Author and Novel:**\n    *   The prologue in question was written for the novel **_El astillero_** (published in English as **_The Shipyard_**) by the Uruguayan writer **Juan Carlos Onetti**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Clues within the Source:**\n    *   In the prologue to *El astillero*, Borges makes both statements.\n    *   He writes that Onetti is a \"continuador y simplificador de Faulkner\" (a continuator and simplifier of Faulkner).\n    *   He then describes Onetti's work, and specifically *El astillero*, as having \"la intensidad contenida de un tigre que va a saltar y la variedad que puede alcanzar una partida de ajedrez\" (the contained intensity of a tiger about to pounce and the variety that a game of chess can achieve).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Source is Key:** The fact that the critique comes from Borges is crucial. His prologues were highly influential and often provided concise, memorable summaries of an author's style.\n*   **The Faulkner Comparison:** This is not a casual remark. It places Onetti within a specific tradition of literary modernism. Faulkner's influence on Latin American writers of the \"Boom\" generation was immense, but Borges's addition of \"simplifier\" is a unique and precise observation about Onetti's distinct style.\n*   **The Tiger and Chess Metaphor:** This is a perfect encapsulation of the atmosphere in Onetti's novels. They are not action-packed but are filled with immense psychological tension (the tiger) that unfolds through meticulous, almost strategic, narrative structures and character interactions (the chess duel).\n*   **The Novel Itself:** *El astillero* (*The Shipyard*) is a quintessential Onetti novel, centered on the character of Larsen returning to the mythical, decaying town of Santa Mar√≠a to try and revive a defunct shipyard. It is a story of failure, decay, and existential despair, fitting the description perfectly.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy cross-referencing the specific quote about the tiger and chess with the description of the author as a \"continuator and simplifier of Faulkner,\" all evidence points to Jorge Luis Borges's prologue for Juan Carlos Onetti's novel, *El astillero*.\n\n<<<El astillero (The Shipyard) by Juan Carlos Onetti>>>"
