    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the philosopher in question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A philosopher.\n    *   **School of Thought:** The Lviv-Warsaw School of logic and philosophy. This narrows down the candidates to a specific group of Polish thinkers from the early to mid-20th century (e.g., Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz).\n    *   **Key Philosophical Concept:** The decomposition of the notion of a \"hallmark\" (or more broadly, a \"sign\" or \"mark\").\n    *   **Specific Terms of Decomposition:** The hallmark is broken down into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\". This specific terminological distinction is the main clue.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Concepts:**\n    *   **Hallmark/Mark (Polish: *oznaka*):** This is a general term for something that indicates the presence of something else. It is a sign in the broadest sense.\n    *   **Symptom (Polish: *objaw*):** This term implies a natural or causal connection between the sign and what it signifies. For example, a fever is a symptom of an illness. Smoke is a symptom of fire. The relationship exists independently of human convention. We infer the cause from the effect (the symptom).\n    *   **Signal (Polish: *sygnał*):** This term implies a conventional or intentional connection. The relationship between the sign and what it signifies is established by a rule, an agreement, or a deliberate act of communication. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop. A referee's whistle is a signal to stop play. The meaning is not natural but created.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Candidates from the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   **Kazimierz Twardowski:** As the founder, his work on signs and presentations was foundational, but this specific distinction (symptom/signal) is not his most noted contribution. He laid the groundwork for his students.\n    *   **Tadeusz Kotarbiński:** He worked on praxiology (the theory of efficient action) and reism. While his work involves analyzing human actions which can include signaling, this specific semiotic (theory of signs) distinction is not central to his main philosophical projects.\n    *   **Jan Łukasiewicz & Alfred Tarski:** Their primary focus was on formal logic and semantics, not on this type of general semiotic or epistemological distinction.\n    *   **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz:** He made significant contributions to logic, epistemology, and the philosophy of language. A central part of his work involved analyzing the nature of language, meaning, and inference. The analysis of signs was crucial to this project. He is widely credited with developing and popularizing this precise distinction as part of his epistemological and semantic theories.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Connection to Ajdukiewicz:**\n    *   In his works, notably *Pragmatic Logic* and other writings on language and knowledge, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz explicitly analyzes the concept of a sign or \"mark\" (*oznaka*).\n    *   He formally distinguishes between marks that are **symptoms** (natural signs linked by causality) and those that are **signals** (conventional signs established by rule).\n    *   This distinction was fundamental to his analysis of different types of inference. Inferring from a symptom is a form of inductive or empirical reasoning, while understanding a signal is based on knowing a rule or convention.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposed the notion of a hallmark (or mark/sign) into the categories of symptoms and signals is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Translation:** The term \"hallmark\" is a plausible English translation of the Polish *oznaka*, which can also be translated as \"mark\" or \"sign\". Understanding the original Polish terminology (*oznaka*, *objaw*, *sygnał*) helps confirm the source.\n*   **Context:** This distinction is not merely a linguistic one; it is a fundamental part of Ajdukiewicz's epistemology and philosophy of science, explaining how we gain knowledge from different kinds of evidence.\n*   **Influence:** While other philosophers before and within the school discussed types of signs (e.g., Twardowski), Ajdukiewicz is the one who systemized and became famous for this particular \"symptom vs. signal\" dichotomy.\n\nThe final answer is the name of the philosopher who fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
