    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition and Formula\n\nThe problem asks for the Crawley-Nordström invariant, denoted as CN(L), for a Calabi-Yau link L. This link is defined as the intersection of the sphere $S^9 \\subset \\mathbb{C}^5$ with the zero set of a weighted homogeneous polynomial $F(z_1, ..., z_5) = 0$.\n\nThe key components are:\n1.  The ambient weighted projective space, defined by the weights $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n2.  The defining polynomial $F$. The link is specified to be \"Calabi-Yau\". For a hypersurface in a weighted projective space, this imposes a condition on the degree 'd' of the polynomial.\n3.  The formula for the Crawley-Nordström invariant for such a link is:\n    $CN(L) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i=1}^{5} (d-2w_i) \\binom{d/w_i}{2}$\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Degree 'd'\n\nFor a hypersurface defined by $F=0$ in $\\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, ..., w_5)$ to be Calabi-Yau, its weighted degree 'd' must equal the sum of the weights.\n\n*   **Weights:** $w_1 = 22, w_2 = 29, w_3 = 49, w_4 = 50, w_5 = 75$.\n*   **Sum of weights:** $d = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n\nThus, the degree of the polynomial must be **d = 225**.\n\n**Careful Point:** We should verify if the given polynomial $F = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$ is indeed weighted homogeneous with degree 225.\n*   $z_1^8z_3 \\implies 8(22) + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$. (Correct)\n*   $z_1^4z_2^3z_3 \\implies 4(22) + 3(29) + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$. (Incorrect)\n*   $z_1z_2^7 \\implies 1(22) + 7(29) = 22 + 203 = 225$. (Correct)\n*   $z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5 \\implies 22+29+49+50+75 = 225$. (Correct)\n*   $z_2z_3^4 \\implies 1(29) + 4(49) = 29 + 196 = 225$. (Correct)\n*   $z_4^3z_5 \\implies 3(50) + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$. (Correct)\n*   $z_5^3 \\implies 3(75) = 225$. (Correct)\n\nThere is an inconsistency in the provided polynomial (the second term has the wrong degree). However, the calculation of the Crawley-Nordström invariant depends only on the weights $w_i$ and the degree $d$, not on the specific form of the polynomial. Given the problem specifies a \"Calabi-Yau Link\", we must use the degree $d=225$ dictated by the Calabi-Yau condition. We assume the second term in the polynomial is a typo.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Terms in the CN Formula\n\nThe formula is $CN(L) = \\frac{1}{225} \\sum_{i=1}^{5} (225-2w_i) \\binom{225/w_i}{2}$.\nA critical part of this formula is the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$, which is conventionally defined for a non-negative integer $n$.\n\n**Careful Point:** We must check if the ratios $d/w_i = 225/w_i$ are integers for each weight $w_i$.\n*   **i = 1:** $225 / w_1 = 225 / 22 \\approx 10.227$. Not an integer.\n*   **i = 2:** $225 / w_2 = 225 / 29 \\approx 7.758$. Not an integer.\n*   **i = 3:** $225 / w_3 = 225 / 49 \\approx 4.591$. Not an integer.\n*   **i = 4:** $225 / w_4 = 225 / 50 = 4.5$. Not an integer.\n*   **i = 5:** $225 / w_5 = 225 / 75 = 3$. **This is an integer.**\n\nFor the cases where $n = d/w_i$ is not an integer, the combinatorial interpretation of the binomial coefficient does not apply. The standard convention in such mathematical contexts is that $\\binom{n}{k} = 0$ if $n$ is not a non-negative integer. Therefore, the terms in the sum for $i=1, 2, 3, 4$ will be zero.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Crawley-Nordström Invariant\n\nFollowing the convention from Step 3, we only need to calculate the term for $i=5$, as all other terms are zero.\n\n*   **Term for i=1:** 0\n*   **Term for i=2:** 0\n*   **Term for i=3:** 0\n*   **Term for i=4:** 0\n*   **Term for i=5:**\n    *   This term is $(d-2w_5) \\binom{d/w_5}{2}$.\n    *   Substitute the values: $d=225$ and $w_5=75$.\n    *   $(225 - 2 \\cdot 75) \\binom{225/75}{2}$\n    *   $= (225 - 150) \\binom{3}{2}$\n    *   $= 75 \\cdot \\frac{3 \\cdot (3-1)}{2 \\cdot 1}$\n    *   $= 75 \\cdot \\frac{3 \\cdot 2}{2}$\n    *   $= 75 \\cdot 3 = 225$.\n\nNow, we compute the sum:\nSum = $0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 225 = 225$.\n\nFinally, we apply the full formula for the invariant:\n$CN(L) = \\frac{1}{d} \\cdot (\\text{Sum})$\n$CN(L) = \\frac{1}{225} \\cdot 225$\n$CN(L) = 1$\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
