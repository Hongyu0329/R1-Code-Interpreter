    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions**\n    *   **Torus ($T^2$)**: The 2-torus is the surface of a donut. It is a compact, connected, orientable manifold without boundary. We can think of it as a square with opposite edges identified, or as the product of two circles, $S^1 \\times S^1$.\n    *   **Smooth Function**: A function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is infinitely differentiable.\n    *   **Critical Point**: A point $p \\in T^2$ where the derivative (differential) of $f$ is zero. In local coordinates $(x, y)$, this means $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(p) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(p) = 0$.\n\n2.  **Establish a Basic Lower Bound**\n    *   The torus $T^2$ is a compact space.\n    *   A continuous function on a compact space must attain a global maximum and a global minimum.\n    *   For a smooth function, any local extremum (maximum or minimum) must be a critical point.\n    *   If the function is constant, every point is a critical point, so there are infinitely many.\n    *   If the function is non-constant, the global maximum and global minimum must be distinct points.\n    *   Therefore, any non-constant smooth function on the torus must have at least **two** critical points.\n\n3.  **Refine the Lower Bound using Topology (Morse Theory)**\n    This problem is a classic application of Morse Theory, which connects the number of critical points of a function to the topology of the manifold.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Morse Functions.** It is sufficient to find the minimum for a special class of functions called *Morse functions*. A Morse function is a smooth function whose critical points are all non-degenerate (meaning the Hessian matrix of second derivatives is non-singular at those points). This is because any arbitrary smooth function can be slightly perturbed to become a Morse function, and this perturbation process can only split a degenerate critical point into multiple non-degenerate ones, thus not decreasing the total number of critical points. Therefore, the minimum for any smooth function will be achieved by a Morse function.\n\n    *   For a Morse function on a 2-dimensional manifold, there are three types of non-degenerate critical points, classified by their **index** (the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian):\n        *   Index 0: Local minimum ($c_0$ denotes the number of such points).\n        *   Index 1: Saddle point ($c_1$ denotes the number of such points).\n        *   Index 2: Local maximum ($c_2$ denotes the number of such points).\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Poincaré-Hopf Theorem.** This fundamental theorem relates the critical points to a topological invariant called the **Euler characteristic**, denoted $\\chi(M)$. For any Morse function $f$ on a compact manifold $M$, the alternating sum of the number of critical points of each index equals the Euler characteristic of the manifold.\n        *   $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim(M)} (-1)^k c_k(f) = \\chi(M)$.\n        *   For the 2-torus, this formula is: $c_0 - c_1 + c_2 = \\chi(T^2)$.\n\n    *   **Topological Properties of the Torus $T^2$**:\n        *   The Euler characteristic of the torus is $\\chi(T^2) = 0$. (This can be seen by triangulating it, e.g., on the square representation: V-E+F = 1-2+1=0, or from its Betti numbers $\\beta_0=1, \\beta_1=2, \\beta_2=1$, giving $\\chi = 1-2+1=0$).\n        *   Therefore, for any Morse function on the torus, we must have the relation: $c_0 - c_1 + c_2 = 0$, which implies $c_1 = c_0 + c_2$.\n\n    *   **Calculating the Minimum**:\n        1.  As established in Step 2, any non-constant function must have at least one global minimum and one global maximum. So, for a Morse function, we must have $c_0 \\ge 1$ and $c_2 \\ge 1$.\n        2.  Using the relation from the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, $c_1 = c_0 + c_2$, we can find a lower bound for the number of saddle points: $c_1 \\ge 1 + 1 = 2$.\n        3.  The total number of critical points is $C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2$.\n        4.  Substituting $c_1 = c_0 + c_2$, we get $C = c_0 + (c_0 + c_2) + c_2 = 2(c_0 + c_2)$.\n        5.  Since $c_0 \\ge 1$ and $c_2 \\ge 1$, the minimum value for $c_0+c_2$ is $1+1=2$.\n        6.  Therefore, the minimum total number of critical points is $C \\ge 2(1 + 1) = 4$.\n\n    *   This shows that any smooth function on the torus must have at least **four** critical points (assuming it has a finite number, which is true for Morse functions).\n\n4.  **Construct an Example to Show the Lower Bound is Achievable**\n    We need to find an explicit smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that has exactly four critical points.\n    *   Let's represent the torus as a square $[0, 2\\pi] \\times [0, 2\\pi]$ with opposite sides identified. Let the coordinates be $(\\theta, \\phi)$.\n    *   Consider the function $f(\\theta, \\phi) = \\cos(\\theta) + \\cos(\\phi)$. This function is periodic in both variables, so it is well-defined on the torus.\n    *   Find the critical points by setting the partial derivatives to zero:\n        *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta} = -\\sin(\\theta) = 0 \\implies \\theta = 0$ or $\\pi$.\n        *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\phi} = -\\sin(\\phi) = 0 \\implies \\phi = 0$ or $\\pi$.\n    *   This gives exactly four critical points in the domain $[0, 2\\pi) \\times [0, 2\\pi)$:\n        1.  $(\\theta, \\phi) = (0, 0)$\n        2.  $(\\theta, \\phi) = (0, \\pi)$\n        3.  $(\\theta, \\phi) = (\\pi, 0)$\n        4.  $(\\theta, \\phi) = (\\pi, \\pi)$\n    *   Classify these points using the Hessian matrix: $H = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\cos(\\theta) & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos(\\phi) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        1.  At $(0, 0)$: $H = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are both negative. This is a **local maximum** (index 2).\n        2.  At $(0, \\pi)$: $H = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues have opposite signs. This is a **saddle point** (index 1).\n        3.  At $(\\pi, 0)$: $H = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues have opposite signs. This is a **saddle point** (index 1).\n        4.  At $(\\pi, \\pi)$: $H = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are both positive. This is a **local minimum** (index 0).\n    *   This function has exactly four critical points: one minimum, one maximum, and two saddles. This matches the minimal configuration predicted by Morse theory ($c_0=1, c_1=2, c_2=1$).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis from Morse theory shows that any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least 4 critical points. The construction of the function $f(\\theta, \\phi) = \\cos(\\theta) + \\cos(\\phi)$ demonstrates that this minimum is achievable. Therefore, the minimal number of critical points is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
