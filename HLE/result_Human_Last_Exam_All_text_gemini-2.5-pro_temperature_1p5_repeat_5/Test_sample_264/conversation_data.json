    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Set up a Coordinate System\n\nThe problem asks for the volume of the intersection of two identical cubes.\n*   **Object:** Two cubes.\n*   **Size:** Each cube has a side length of 1.\n*   **Relative Position:** They are shifted relative to each other.\n*   **Shift Details:** The shift is \"by 1/2\" and occurs \"along the main diagonal\".\n\nTo make the problem concrete, let's place the first cube, which we'll call Cube A, in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. The most convenient placement is with one vertex at the origin (0,0,0) and the opposite vertex at (1,1,1).\n*   **Cube A** is defined by the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n    *   0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n    *   0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n    *   0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\n### Step 2: List and Analyze Careful Points - Interpreting the Shift\n\nThis is the most critical part of the problem.\n1.  **Main Diagonal:** For Cube A positioned as above, the \"main diagonal\" connects the vertex at the origin (0,0,0) to the opposite vertex at (1,1,1). The vector representing this diagonal is **v** = (1, 1, 1).\n2.  **\"Shifted by 1/2\":** This phrase can be interpreted in a few ways.\n    *   **Interpretation 1 (Most likely):** A shift \"along the main diagonal\" by \"1/2\" implies a shift of 1/2 unit in each of the coordinate directions that define the diagonal. This means the second cube (Cube B) is translated by the vector **d** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n    *   **Interpretation 2 (Supporting Interpretation 1):** The shift could be half the length of the main diagonal itself. The length of the main diagonal of a unit cube is √(1²+1²+1²) = √3. Half this length is √3/2. A displacement of this distance in the direction of the diagonal vector **v**=(1,1,1) (whose unit vector is (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3)) results in a shift vector of (√3/2) * (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This confirms the first interpretation.\n    *   **Interpretation 3 (Less likely):** The shift distance itself is 1/2. This would imply a displacement vector of (1/2) * (unit vector) = (1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3)). This would lead to a more complex calculation and is generally not the intended meaning in such problems.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most reasonable interpretation is that the shift vector is **d** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n### Step 3: Define the Second Cube and Find the Intersection\n\n*   **Define Cube B:** Cube B is simply Cube A translated by the vector **d** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). We find its boundaries by adding 1/2 to the coordinate ranges of Cube A.\n    *   **Cube B** is defined by the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n        *   0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n        *   0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n        *   0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n\n*   **Find the Intersection:** The intersection is the region of space that is part of both Cube A and Cube B. To find it, we must find the overlap for each coordinate's range.\n    *   **For x:** The region must satisfy 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 AND 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2. The overlapping interval is [1/2, 1].\n    *   **For y:** The region must satisfy 0 ≤ y ≤ 1 AND 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2. The overlapping interval is [1/2, 1].\n    *   **For z:** The region must satisfy 0 ≤ z ≤ 1 AND 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2. The overlapping interval is [1/2, 1].\n\nThe resulting intersection is a new rectangular prism (in fact, a cube) defined by 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1, 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1, and 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Volume\n\nThe shape of the intersection is a cube. We need to find its side lengths to calculate its volume.\n*   Side length in x-direction = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n*   Side length in y-direction = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n*   Side length in z-direction = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nThe volume of this intersection cube is the product of its side lengths.\nVolume = (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/8.\n\nAs a decimal, this is 0.125.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
