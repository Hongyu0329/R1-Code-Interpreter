    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\n*   **Who:** Curt Querner, a German painter.\n*   **When:** 1933.\n*   **What:** A self-portrait.\n*   **Context:** Painted after escaping from the Gestapo (or more accurately, the SA acting as auxiliary police in the early days of the Nazi regime).\n*   **Core Question:** What object is he holding in his hand, and what does it symbolize? The question specifically states it's a symbol of resistance.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific artwork**\nThe painting in question is famously known as \"Selbstbildnis mit rotem Tuch\" (Self-Portrait with Red Cloth) or \"Selbstbildnis nach der Flucht vor der Gestapo\" (Self-Portrait after Escaping the Gestapo). This title already gives a strong clue about the object.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the historical and personal context**\n*   In early 1933, following the Nazi seizure of power and the Reichstag Fire, political opponents, especially communists and socialists, were arrested en masse.\n*   Curt Querner was a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). He was arrested and held in a so-called \"protective custody\" camp.\n*   He managed to escape and went into hiding, during which time he painted this self-portrait.\n*   The painting is a direct response to his persecution. His gaunt face and intense, defiant stare reflect the hardship he endured and his unbroken will.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the object and its symbolism**\n*   Upon viewing the portrait, Querner is clearly seen clutching an object in his right hand. This object is a **red cloth** or a red rag.\n*   The symbolism of this object is deeply political and contextual. Red is the internationally recognized color of communism and the socialist workers' movement.\n*   By holding a red cloth, Querner is not hiding his political convictions, which were the very reason for his arrest. Instead, he is defiantly affirming them.\n*   **Careful Point:** In the face of a regime that sought to eliminate him for his beliefs, displaying the symbol of those beliefs is a powerful act of resistance and a declaration of his unbroken spirit. He is essentially saying, \"You can imprison my body, but you cannot crush my convictions.\"\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the findings to form a conclusive answer**\nCurt Querner was arrested by the Nazis because of his communist political affiliation. After escaping, he painted a self-portrait where he holds a red cloth. This red cloth is a direct and defiant symbol of the communist cause for which he was being persecuted, thereby functioning as a powerful symbol of his personal and political resistance to the Nazi regime.\n\n<<<He holds a red cloth.>>>"
