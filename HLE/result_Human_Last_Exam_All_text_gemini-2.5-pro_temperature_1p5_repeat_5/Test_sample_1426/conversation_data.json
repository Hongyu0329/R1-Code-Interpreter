    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes for the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Correct Musical Piece and Section**\nThe question specifies Dvořák's \"Symphony no. 2, Op. 4\". We need to analyze the very end of the piece, which is the conclusion of the fourth and final movement (IV. Allegro con fuoco). The specific instrument part to examine is that of the first violin (Violino I).\n\n**Step 2: Locate and Examine the Score**\nConsulting the orchestral score for this symphony, we look at the last few measures of the first violin part. The symphony ends in the key of B-flat major. The final measures build excitement toward a concluding tonic note.\n\n**Step 3: Transcribe the Final Notes for the First Violin**\nThe last two measures for the first violin are as follows:\n*   **Penultimate Measure:** This measure contains a rapid, ascending flourish of four sixteenth notes. The notes are F5, G5, A5, and B♭5. (The '5' denotes the octave, where C4 is middle C).\n*   **Final Measure:** This measure consists of a single whole note, B♭5, which is marked with a fermata, indicating it should be held for a prolonged duration until the conductor cuts it off.\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the Phrase \"ends on three notes\"**\nThe phrase \"ends on three notes\" refers to the final melodic figure played by the instrument. The symphony's concluding sound is the long B♭5. The immediate musical gesture leading to this final note is the ascending run. We need to identify the last three notes played in this sequence.\n\nThe sequence of individual notes played at the very end is ...F5, G5, A5, B♭5, followed by the sustained B♭5. The last three notes played in this sequence are G5, A5, and B♭5.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Lowest Note**\nThe three notes that form the final melodic gesture are:\n1.  G5\n2.  A5\n3.  B♭5\n\nComparing these three pitches, G5 is the lowest note in this sequence. A5 is a whole step higher than G5, and B♭5 is a half step higher than A5.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe last three notes the first violin plays are G5, A5, and B♭5. The lowest of these three is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
