    "This problem asks for `a(4)`, which represents the maximal number of prime implicants a Boolean function of 4 variables can have.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Prime Implicants\n\nA Boolean function of `n` variables can be represented by a set of minterms (input combinations for which the function output is 1). In a Karnaugh map (K-map), these are the cells containing a '1'.\n\nAn **implicant** is a product term (a grouping of '1's in a K-map) that covers only minterms of the function.\nA **prime implicant (PI)** is an implicant that cannot be simplified further. In a K-map, this corresponds to a rectangular grouping of '1's that is not fully contained within any other single larger rectangular grouping.\n\nThe goal is to find a function of 4 variables (i.e., an arrangement of '1's in a 4x4 K-map) that results in the largest possible number of these maximal groupings (PIs).\n\n### Step 2: Strategy for Maximizing the Number of Prime Implicants\n\nTo maximize the *number* of prime implicants, the intuitive strategy is to make each prime implicant as small as possible. A single large PI covering many minterms would reduce the total PI count compared to if those same minterms formed multiple smaller, distinct PIs.\n\nThe smallest possible PI is a single minterm (a 1x1 group). A minterm becomes a prime implicant if and only if it cannot be combined with any of its adjacent neighbors. This means all of its adjacent cells in the K-map must be '0's.\n\n### Step 3: Relating to Graph Theory\n\nWe can model the relationships between minterms using a graph called the **n-cube (or hypercube)**.\n*   **Vertices:** The `2^n` vertices of the graph correspond to the `2^n` possible minterms (from `00...0` to `11...1`).\n*   **Edges:** An edge connects two vertices if and only if their binary representations differ by exactly one bit. This corresponds to adjacency in a K-map.\n\nIn this graph context, our strategy is to choose a set of vertices (minterms for which the function is '1') such that no two vertices in the set are connected by an edge (i.e., no two minterms are adjacent). Such a set is called an **independent set** in the graph.\n\nTo maximize the number of PIs using this strategy, we need to find the largest possible independent set in the 4-cube graph (`Q_4`). The size of this set is known as the **independence number** of the graph.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Maximum Independent Set of the n-cube\n\nThe n-cube graph `Q_n` has a special property: it is **bipartite**. This means its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, let's call them `A` and `B`, such that every edge in the graph connects a vertex in `A` to one in `B`.\n\nWe can create these two sets based on the **parity** of the number of '1's in the binary representation of the minterms:\n1.  **Set A (V_even):** The set of all minterms with an even number of '1's.\n2.  **Set B (V_odd):** The set of all minterms with an odd number of '1's.\n\nAn edge only exists between minterms that differ by one bit. This means one minterm must have `k` ones and its neighbor must have `k-1` or `k+1` ones. Therefore, an edge always connects a minterm of even parity to one of odd parity. No two minterms within the same parity set are adjacent.\n\nThis means that both `V_even` and `V_odd` are independent sets. For `n >= 1`, the number of minterms with even parity is equal to the number with odd parity:\n`|V_even| = |V_odd| = 2^n / 2 = 2^(n-1)`\n\nSince these two sets partition the entire graph, the largest possible independent set must be one of these two sets. Therefore, the size of the maximum independent set of the n-cube `Q_n` is `2^(n-1)`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating a(4)\n\nBy choosing the function's minterms to be the members of a maximum independent set (e.g., all minterms with an even number of 1s), we ensure that no two '1's are adjacent. This means every single minterm is its own prime implicant. The number of prime implicants is thus equal to the number of minterms, which is the size of the maximum independent set.\n\nFor a function of `n=4` variables:\nThe maximal number of prime implicants `a(4)` is the size of the maximum independent set of the 4-cube `Q_4`.\n\n`a(4) = 2^(4-1) = 2^3 = 8`\n\n**Example Function:** The function `f(w, x, y, z)` that is '1' for all inputs with an even number of '1's has 8 minterms (`0000`, `0011`, `0101`, `0110`, `1001`, `1010`, `1100`, `1111`). In the K-map, this creates a \"checkerboard\" pattern where no two '1's are adjacent. Each of these 8 minterms is a prime implicant, giving a total of 8 PIs. It can be proven that no arrangement can produce more than 8 PIs.\n\n<<<8>>>"
