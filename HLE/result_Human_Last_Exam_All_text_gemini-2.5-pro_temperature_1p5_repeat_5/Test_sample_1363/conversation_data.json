    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in ballroom dancing where the couple executes a turn to their left (in an anti-clockwise direction).\n*   **Overturn:** To rotate more than the standard or textbook amount for a given figure. For example, if a standard turn is 3/4 of a circle (270 degrees), an overturned version might be a full circle (360 degrees).\n*   **Technique:** The set of fundamental principles and rules governing movement in a specific dance. This includes footwork (e.g., heel leads, toe pivots), body action (e.g., CBM - Contrary Body Movement), rise and fall, sway, and timing.\n*   **\"Without disregarding the technique\":** This is the crucial part of the question. It means the overturn must be possible while still adhering to the core, defining principles of the dance style. If you have to break a fundamental rule of the dance (like adding CBM where there should be none) to achieve the overturn, then it's considered \"impossible\" under the question's conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Dance Option**\n\nLet's examine the Reverse Turn in each of the International Standard dances listed.\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz:** This dance is characterized by continuous rotation. The Reverse Turn is a full 360-degree turn over six steps. While the standard is a full turn, the flowing and continuous nature of the dance allows for slight variations in rotation (overturning or underturning) to navigate the floor without breaking the fundamental technique. It is not impossible.\n\n*   **B. English Waltz:** This is a \"swing dance,\" characterized by sway, CBM, and rise and fall. The standard Reverse Turn rotates 3/4 of a turn over six steps. It is very common for dancers to overturn the second half of this figure (steps 4-6) to change their alignment for the next figure. This is achieved by using more body rotation and sway, which are core components of Waltz technique, not a violation of it. Therefore, overturning is possible.\n\n*   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** Like the Waltz, Foxtrot is a swing dance defined by its long, gliding movements and CBM. The Reverse Turn in Foxtrot also commonly turns 3/4. Dancers can and do overturn this figure, particularly the latter half, to transition smoothly into other figures from different alignments. This is a standard choreographic choice that uses the existing Foxtrot technique. Therefore, overturning is possible.\n\n*   **E. Quickstep:** This is a dynamic and energetic swing dance. Its figures are often adapted with more or less turn to create complex and fast-moving choreography. Overturning a Reverse Turn or other figures is common and is achieved by applying Quickstep's energetic technique more powerfully. It is not impossible.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:** This dance stands apart from the others. Its technique is fundamentally different.\n    *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dance is kept level and grounded.\n    *   **No Swing:** Movements are staccato and sharp, not flowing and swinging.\n    *   **Specific Footwork:** The Tango Reverse Turn involves very precise foot placements (e.g., the man's second step is \"Right Foot to side and slightly back\").\n    *   **No CBM:** Crucially, on the second step of the Reverse Turn, there is no CBM. The turn is generated by a sharp swivel or pivot on the standing foot, not by the body swinging into position.\n\n    To overturn the Tango Reverse Turn, a dancer would need to generate more rotation than the figure's mechanics allow. This would almost certainly require introducing elements foreign to Tango technique, such as:\n    1.  Using body swing to create momentum (disregarding the \"no swing\" rule).\n    2.  Using CBM to initiate more turn (disregarding the \"no CBM\" rule for that step).\n    3.  Altering the prescribed footwork from \"side and slightly back\" to a more rotational placement.\n\n    Doing any of these would mean \"disregarding the technique.\" The inherent staccato nature and the specific mechanics of the Tango Reverse Turn make it structurally resistant to being overturned.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nIn the swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep), overturning is a valid technical variation achieved by applying more of the core principles of the dance (e.g., more sway, more CBM, more body rotation). In Tango, the core principles themselves (staccato action, no swing, no CBM on key steps) physically restrict the amount of turn. Attempting to force an overturn would require breaking these fundamental rules. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a Tango Reverse Turn *without disregarding the technique*.\n\n<<<C>>>"
