    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the board and the goal**\nThe problem is set on a standard 8x8 chessboard. The goal is to place the maximum possible number of bishops on the \"edge squares\" without any bishop attacking another. An edge square is any square on the first rank, eighth rank, 'a' file, or 'h' file. We need to find how many of these edge squares will be empty.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and count the edge squares**\nAn 8x8 board has 8 squares on each of its 4 sides. To find the total number of unique edge squares, we can sum the squares on each side and subtract the 4 corner squares that are counted twice.\nAlternatively: 8 squares on the top rank + 8 squares on the bottom rank + 6 squares on the left file (excluding corners) + 6 squares on the right file (excluding corners).\nTotal edge squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the rules of bishop movement**\nA key rule for bishops is that they always stay on the squares of the same color. A bishop on a light square can only ever attack other light squares, and a bishop on a dark square can only ever attack other dark squares. This means we can solve the problem for light squares and dark squares completely independently and then combine the results.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the dark edge squares**\nFirst, we need to list all the edge squares that are dark. Assuming a standard board where 'a1' is a dark square:\n*   **Rank 1:** a1, c1, e1, g1 (4 squares)\n*   **Rank 8:** b8, d8, f8, h8 (4 squares)\n*   **File 'a':** a3, a5, a7 (3 squares)\n*   **File 'h':** h2, h4, h6 (3 squares)\nTotal dark edge squares = 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 14 squares.\n\nNow, we want to place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on these 14 squares. Let's try a strategic placement:\n*   Place bishops on all the dark squares on the first rank: {a1, c1, e1, g1}. This is a valid placement of 4 bishops, as they are on the same rank and don't attack each other.\n*   Let's check which other dark edge squares are attacked by this set. A bishop at (x1, y1) attacks another at (x2, y2) if |x1 - x2| = |y1 - y2|.\n    *   a1 attacks h8.\n    *   c1 attacks a3 and h6.\n    *   e1 attacks a5 and h4.\n    *   g1 attacks a7 and h2.\n*   The squares attacked are: {h8, a3, h6, a5, h4, a7, h2}.\n*   The squares we've placed bishops on and the squares they attack cover 11 of the 14 dark squares. The three remaining dark edge squares are {b8, d8, f8}.\n*   Are any of {b8, d8, f8} attacked by our placed bishops {a1, c1, e1, g1}? No.\n*   Do the bishops at {b8, d8, f8} attack any of our placed bishops? No.\n*   Do the bishops at {b8, d8, f8} attack each other? No, they are on the same rank.\n*   Therefore, we can add bishops on {b8, d8, f8} to our set.\nThe final set of dark-squared bishops is {a1, c1, e1, g1, b8, d8, f8}. This is a total of **7** bishops. These 7 bishops occupy 7 squares and attack the other 7 dark edge squares, so no more can be added. The maximum is 7.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the light edge squares**\nThe problem is symmetrical for the light squares.\n*   There are also 14 light edge squares:\n    *   **Rank 1:** b1, d1, f1, h1 (4 squares)\n    *   **Rank 8:** a8, c8, e8, g8 (4 squares)\n    *   **File 'a':** a2, a4, a6 (3 squares)\n    *   **File 'h':** h3, h5, h7 (3 squares)\n*   We can use a similar strategy. Place bishops on all light squares on the first rank: {b1, d1, f1, h1}.\n*   These 4 bishops attack the following light edge squares: {a2, h7, a4, h5, a6, h3, a8}.\n*   The squares that are not occupied or attacked are {c8, e8, g8}.\n*   We can safely add bishops to these three squares.\n*   The final set of light-squared bishops is {b1, d1, f1, h1, c8, e8, g8}. This is a total of **7** bishops.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the total number of bishops and empty squares**\n*   Maximum bishops on dark edge squares = 7\n*   Maximum bishops on light edge squares = 7\n*   Since the two sets don't interact, the total maximum number of bishops is 7 + 7 = **14**.\n*   The question asks how many edge squares would *lack* bishops.\n*   Total edge squares = 28\n*   Number of placed bishops = 14\n*   Number of empty squares = Total Squares - Placed Bishops = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{14}$."
