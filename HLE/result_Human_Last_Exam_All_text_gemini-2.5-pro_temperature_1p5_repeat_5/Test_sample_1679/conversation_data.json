    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Elements of the Question**\nThe question has three main components:\n1.  **The film must have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.**\n2.  **It must depict a \"Luxor Obelisk\" on-screen.**\n3.  We are looking for the **first** such film chronologically.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"Luxor Obelisk\" and Its Locations**\nThe \"Luxor Obelisks\" are a pair of ancient Egyptian obelisks. It's crucial to know their locations to identify films that might depict them.\n*   **Location 1:** One obelisk still stands at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   **Location 2:** The second obelisk was transported to Paris, France, in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the **Place de la Concorde**.\n\nTherefore, a qualifying film would need to show either the Luxor Temple in Egypt or the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\n\n**Step 3: Chronological Review of Best Picture Winners**\nWe will go through the list of Best Picture winners, starting from the first one, and look for films set in either Luxor or Paris.\n\n*   **1920s - 1930s:** No winners from this era are set in Paris or Luxor in a way that would feature the obelisk. *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), set in Paris, focuses on courtrooms and other settings, not the Place de la Concorde.\n*   **1940s:** The most likely candidate from this decade is *Casablanca* (1943), which features a significant flashback sequence set in Paris. However, the famous Paris scenes in the film show the Arc de Triomphe and the Seine riverbanks, but do not include a clear depiction of the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk.\n*   **1950s:** This decade presents several strong candidates.\n    *   ***An American in Paris* (1951):** As the title suggests, this film is set entirely in Paris. Its famous, 17-minute-long climactic ballet sequence is a visual tour of Paris through stylized sets inspired by French painters. One of the prominent locations featured in this sequence is a beautiful, painterly re-creation of the Place de la Concorde, with the Luxor Obelisk clearly visible as a central element of the scenery.\n    *   ***Around the World in 80 Days* (1956):** This film's plot involves a global journey that includes a stop in Paris. During the Paris sequence, the film does show the Place de la Concorde with the obelisk. However, this film won the award five years after *An American in Paris*.\n    *   ***Gigi* (1958):** Another musical set in Paris. While it showcases many Parisian locations, *An American in Paris* precedes it.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion of the Analysis**\nBy examining the list of Best Picture winners in chronological order, we find:\n1.  No winner before 1951 clearly depicts a Luxor Obelisk.\n2.  *An American in Paris* (1951) definitively depicts the Luxor Obelisk located in Paris's Place de la Concorde during its finale.\n3.  Later films, such as *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956), also show the obelisk, but they are not the *first*.\n\nTherefore, the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen is *An American in Paris*.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **Actual location vs. a set:** The question asks for the obelisk to be \"depict[ed] on-screen.\" This includes stylized representations on a set, like the one in *An American in Paris*, not just on-location footage.\n*   **Both obelisk locations are valid:** The obelisk in Paris is explicitly known as the \"Luxor Obelisk,\" so scenes in the Place de la Concorde qualify.\n*   **Chronological order is key:** The most important constraint is finding the \"first\" winner, making the year of the win the deciding factor between multiple candidates.\n\n***\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
