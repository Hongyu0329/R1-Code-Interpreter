    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe question asks to identify crystal classes that have three specific properties:\n*   **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This means its point group must contain an improper symmetry operation, which includes a center of inversion (i or -1), a mirror plane (m), or a rotoinversion axis (-n).\n*   **Non-polar:** The crystal structure does not have a net dipole moment. This means there is no unique direction in the crystal that is not mapped onto its opposite direction by a symmetry operation. The 10 polar (and also pyroelectric) crystal classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n*   **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity:** Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarized light. This phenomenon is possible only in crystal classes that lack a center of inversion (i). Such classes are called non-centrosymmetric. There are 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes. The property is described by the gyration tensor, which is non-zero for these 21 classes. Note that the term \"optical activity\" is sometimes strictly used for chiral media, but here it must be interpreted more broadly as \"the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light\" (optical gyration), which can occur in certain achiral classes for specific directions of light propagation.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Filtering of the 32 Crystal Classes**\n\nWe need to find the crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions. We will apply the conditions sequentially.\n\n*   **Condition 1: Allows for Optical Activity (Non-centrosymmetric)**\n    There are 11 centrosymmetric classes for which optical activity is strictly forbidden: -1, 2/m, mmm, -3, 4/m, 6/m, -3m, m3, 4/mmm, 6/mmm, m3m.\n    This leaves the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes as potential candidates.\n\n*   **Condition 2: Achiral**\n    From the list of 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, we must select those that are achiral. This means we eliminate the 11 chiral classes (those containing only proper rotation axes): 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432.\n    The remaining classes are both non-centrosymmetric and achiral. There are 10 such classes:\n    m, mm2, -4, 4mm, -42m, 3m, -6, 6mm, -62m, -43m.\n\n*   **Condition 3: Non-polar**\n    From the list of 10 classes derived above, we must now select the ones that are non-polar. The polar classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm.\n    We remove the polar classes from our list of 10 candidates:\n    - `m` is polar.\n    - `mm2` is polar.\n    - `3m` is polar.\n    - `4mm` is polar.\n    - `6mm` is polar.\n    After removing these, we are left with the final set of crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions:\n    **-4, -42m, -6, -62m, -43m**\n\n**3. Analyze the Answer Choices**\n\nNow we compare our derived list with the given options.\n\n*   A. `m` and `mm2`: These classes are polar. So, A is incorrect.\n*   B. `-6`, `-62m`, and `-43m`: All three of these classes are in our final derived list. They are all achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity. So, B is a correct statement.\n*   C. `3m`, `4m` (typographical error, should be `4mm`), and `6mm`: These classes are all polar. So, C is incorrect.\n*   D. `-4` and `-42m`: Both of these classes are in our final derived list. They are both achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity. So, D is also a correct statement.\n*   E. `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `6`: These classes are all chiral and polar. So, E is incorrect.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nBoth option B and option D list crystal classes that correctly satisfy all the conditions laid out in the question. The complete set of such classes is {-4, -42m, -6, -62m, -43m}. Option B lists the members from the hexagonal and cubic systems. Option D lists the members from the tetragonal system.\n\nIn a single-choice question format, having two correct options suggests a flaw in the question's design. However, if a choice must be made, one might consider which option is \"more\" correct. Option B contains three valid examples, while option D contains two. Without further clarification or context, selecting the more comprehensive list among the correct choices is a reasonable strategy.\n\nFinal check of the classes in option B:\n- **-6** (C3h): Achiral (has horizontal mirror plane), non-polar (mirror plane is perpendicular to the 3-fold axis), non-centrosymmetric (can be optically active). Correct.\n- **-62m** (D3h, also written -6m2): Achiral (has mirror planes), non-polar (has horizontal mirror plane and multiple C2 axes), non-centrosymmetric. Correct.\n- **-43m** (Td): Achiral (has mirror planes), non-polar (multiple non-parallel C3 axes), non-centrosymmetric. Correct.\n\nTherefore, option B is a valid answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
