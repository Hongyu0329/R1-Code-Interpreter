    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:**\n    *   **Game:** 100BB deep-stacked cash game. This is a standard stack depth, so typical preflop strategies apply.\n    *   **Rake-free:** This is a critical detail. Rake is the fee the house takes from each pot. In a normal game, the rake makes very marginal hands unprofitable. In a rake-free environment, any hand that can generate even a tiny amount of profit becomes a correct play. This significantly widens all profitable ranges.\n    *   **Position:** You are on the Button (BTN). This is the most powerful position in poker because you are last to act on every post-flop street (flop, turn, river). This positional advantage allows you to realize your equity more effectively and bluff more successfully, justifying the widest opening range of any position.\n    *   **Action:** Open-raising to 2.5x. This is a standard opening size that puts pressure on the blinds without risking too much.\n\n2.  **Define the Hand Category:**\n    *   We are looking for a \"suited jack.\" This means a hand of the form JXs, where X is a card lower than a Jack, and both cards are of the same suit.\n    *   The possible hands in descending order of strength are: JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Hands:**\n    *   The value of these hands comes from a combination of high-card strength (making a pair of Jacks), flush potential (being suited), and straight potential (connectivity).\n    *   **JTs:** A premium hand. It has two broadway cards and can make the nut straight.\n    *   **J9s, J8s:** Still very strong hands with good connectivity to make straights.\n    *   **J7s down to J2s:** As the kicker gets lower, the hand's value decreases. The main reason is the loss of connectivity. J5s has some straight potential (e.g., with a 4-3-2 flop), but hands like J4s, J3s, and J2s have almost no straight potential that involves both cards. Their value relies heavily on making a Jack-high flush or a pair of Jacks.\n\n4.  **Determine the Opening Range:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"worst suited jack you *should* open.\" This means we need to find the weakest hand in this category that is still a profitable open-raise according to Game Theory Optimal (GTO) strategy.\n    *   In a standard *raked* 100BB game, GTO solvers show that the button's opening range is already extremely wide (often 45-50% of hands). This range almost always includes *all* suited Jack combinations, from JTs down to J2s. The positional advantage is simply too great to fold them.\n    *   Now, factor in the **rake-free** condition. Since the house isn't taking a cut of the pot, the bar for profitability is lowered. Hands that were barely profitable (or even slightly losing) in a raked game become clear opens.\n    *   Therefore, if J2s is a standard open from the button in a raked game, it is unequivocally a profitable open in a rake-free game. The optimal strategy is to open all suited jacks.\n\n5.  **Identify the \"Worst\" Hand in the Range:**\n    *   Since the correct strategy is to open all suited jacks (from JTs to J2s), the \"worst\" one that you *should* open is the one with the lowest intrinsic value.\n    *   Comparing the bottom of the range, J2s is objectively worse than J3s, which is worse than J4s, and so on. J2s has the lowest kicker and the absolute worst connectivity.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Rake-Free is Key:** Do not underestimate this factor. It transforms marginal hands into standard opens.\n*   **Button's Power:** Positional advantage is the single most important factor in No-Limit Hold'em. It allows you to play a much wider range of hands profitably.\n*   **\"Should Open\" vs. \"Best Hand\":** The question is not \"what is the best suited jack\" (JTs) but \"what is the worst one that is still in your opening range.\"\n*   **GTO Baseline:** The analysis is based on established GTO principles. In practice, players might deviate, but the theoretically correct range is what's being asked for.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on GTO principles for a rake-free, 100BB game, a player on the button should open an extremely wide range. This range includes all suited Jack combinations. The weakest of these hands, and therefore the \"worst suited jack you should open,\" is the one with the lowest kicker and least connectivity.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
