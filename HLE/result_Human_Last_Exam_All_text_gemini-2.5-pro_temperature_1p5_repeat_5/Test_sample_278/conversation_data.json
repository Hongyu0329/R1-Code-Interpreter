    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure.\n\n**1. Analyze the Curve in Two Parts**\n\nThe curve is defined piecewise based on the parameter `t`. We need to analyze the shape and extent of the curve for each interval.\n\n*   **Part 1: For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\n    *   In this interval, $b=1$. The parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\n    *   These are the standard parametric equations for a circle. Since $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, this describes a portion of a unit circle centered at the origin.\n    *   As `t` varies from $0$ to $\\pi$:\n        *   The point starts at $(\\cos 0, \\sin 0) = (1, 0)$.\n        *   It moves through $(\\cos(\\pi/2), \\sin(\\pi/2)) = (0, 1)$.\n        *   It ends at $(\\cos \\pi, \\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$.\n    *   This part of the curve is the **upper semi-circle** of a unit circle.\n    *   For this part, the range of x-values is $[-1, 1]$ and the range of y-values is $[0, 1]$.\n\n*   **Part 2: For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\n    *   In this interval, $b=5$. The parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5 \\sin t$.\n    *   These equations describe an ellipse. We can see this from the relation $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is an ellipse centered at the origin with a horizontal semi-axis of 1 and a vertical semi-axis of 5.\n    *   As `t` varies from just after $\\pi$ to just before $2\\pi$:\n        *   The point starts near $(\\cos \\pi, 5\\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$, connecting with the end of the first part.\n        *   It moves through $(\\cos(3\\pi/2), 5\\sin(3\\pi/2)) = (0, -5)$.\n        *   It ends near $(\\cos(2\\pi), 5\\sin(2\\pi)) = (1, 0)$, connecting with the start of the first part.\n    *   This part of the curve is the **lower semi-ellipse**.\n    *   For this part, the range of x-values is $[-1, 1]$ and the range of y-values is $[-5, 0]$.\n\n**2. Determine the Bounding Box of the Entire Figure**\n\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the overall minimum and maximum values for `x` and `y` by combining the ranges from both parts. This defines the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that contains the figure.\n\n*   **X-dimension (Width):**\n    *   From Part 1: $x \\in [-1, 1]$\n    *   From Part 2: $x \\in [-1, 1]$\n    *   Overall range for x: $x_{min} = -1$ and $x_{max} = 1$.\n    *   The total width of the figure is $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Y-dimension (Height):**\n    *   From Part 1: $y \\in [0, 1]$\n    *   From Part 2: $y \\in [-5, 0]$\n    *   Overall range for y: $y_{min} = -5$ and $y_{max} = 1$.\n    *   The total height of the figure is $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**3. Find the Smallest Enclosing Square**\n\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle that is 2 units wide and 6 units high. A square that \"outcircles\" or encloses this figure must have a side length that is at least as large as the largest dimension of the bounding box.\n\n*   The dimensions of the bounding box are width = 2 and height = 6.\n*   The side length of the smallest enclosing square must be equal to the maximum of these two dimensions.\n*   Side length of the square = $\\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Area of the Square**\n\nThe area of a square is the square of its side length.\n\n*   Side length = 6\n*   Area = $(\\text{side length})^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n*   Recognized the piecewise nature of the curve.\n*   Correctly identified the geometric shapes (semi-circle and semi-ellipse).\n*   Correctly determined the full range of x and y values over the entire interval $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n*   Understood that the side of the smallest enclosing square is determined by the larger dimension (height or width) of the figure.\n*   Calculated the width and height correctly from the min/max coordinates.\n*   Computed the final area.\n\n<<<36>>>"
