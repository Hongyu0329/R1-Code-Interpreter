    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Write down the governing equations.**\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of a viscous, incompressible fluid. In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, for a velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}) = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$, the equations are:\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity of the fluid. The variables are the independent variables time $t$ and space $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$, and the dependent variables are the velocity $\\mathbf{u}$ and pressure $p$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the concept of a Lie group of symmetries.**\nA Lie group of symmetries of a system of differential equations is a group of transformations on the independent and dependent variables that maps any solution of the system to another solution. The dimension of this group is the dimension of its corresponding Lie algebra, which is the vector space of the infinitesimal generators of these transformations. The standard method is to find all linearly independent infinitesimal generators to determine the dimension.\n\n**Step 3: Distinguish between the full symmetry group and the physically relevant one.**\nA full analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations as a PDE system, without any boundary conditions, reveals an **infinite-dimensional** Lie group of symmetries. This large group includes transformations corresponding to moving into an arbitrarily accelerating and rotating frame of reference. The resulting inertial forces (like Coriolis, centrifugal, and translational acceleration forces) can be absorbed into the pressure term by modifying it (e.g., $p' = p + \\text{terms linear/quadratic in } \\mathbf{x}$).\n\nHowever, these transformations are generally considered \"unphysical\" or are excluded by imposing typical physical boundary conditions, such as requiring the velocity to vanish and the pressure to be constant at infinity ($\\mathbf{u} \\to 0, p \\to p_\\infty$ as $|\\mathbf{x}| \\to \\infty$). Such conditions are not preserved by the transformations corresponding to accelerating frames, as the required pressure modifications are unbounded at infinity.\n\nTherefore, the question is interpreted as asking for the dimension of the maximal **finite-dimensional** symmetry group that is compatible with such physical boundary conditions. This involves identifying the symmetries that do preserve these conditions.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the basis of the Lie algebra of symmetries.**\nWe list the infinitesimal generators that form a basis for this finite-dimensional Lie algebra. Each generator corresponds to a one-parameter family of symmetry transformations.\n\n1.  **Time Translation (1 generator):** The equations are autonomous (no explicit time dependence).\n    *   Transformation: $t' = t + \\epsilon$\n    *   Generator: $\\partial_t$\n\n2.  **Space Translations (3 generators):** The equations are homogeneous in space.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\epsilon \\mathbf{c}$ (for a constant vector $\\mathbf{c}$)\n    *   Generators: $\\partial_{x_1}, \\partial_{x_2}, \\partial_{x_3}$\n\n3.  **Spatial Rotations (3 generators):** The equations are isotropic (invariant under rotations).\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x}' = R\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}' = R\\mathbf{u}$ (for a rotation matrix $R$)\n    *   Generators: $J_i = \\epsilon_{ijk} (x_j \\partial_{x_k} + u_j \\partial_{u_k})$ (generators of rotations about the $x_i$-axis)\n\n4.  **Galilean Boosts (3 generators):** The equations are invariant under a change to a uniformly moving reference frame.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\epsilon t \\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u} + \\epsilon \\mathbf{v}$\n    *   Generators: $G_i = t\\partial_{x_i} + \\partial_{u_i}$\n\n5.  **Scaling (or Dilation) (1 generator):** This is a specific scaling that balances the inertial and viscous terms.\n    *   Transformation: $t' = e^{2\\epsilon} t, \\mathbf{x}' = e^{\\epsilon} \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}' = e^{-\\epsilon} \\mathbf{u}, p' = e^{-2\\epsilon} p$\n    *   Generator: $D = 2t\\partial_t + x_i\\partial_{x_i} - u_i\\partial_{u_i} - 2p\\partial_p$\n\n6.  **Pressure Shift (1 generator):** Only the gradient of the pressure, $\\nabla p$, appears in the equations, so shifting the pressure by a constant leaves the momentum equation unchanged.\n    *   Transformation: $p' = p + \\epsilon$\n    *   Generator: $P = \\partial_p$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the dimension.**\nThe total number of linearly independent generators is the sum of the generators from each category:\nDimension = 1 (time translation) + 3 (space translations) + 3 (rotations) + 3 (Galilean boosts) + 1 (scaling) + 1 (pressure shift)\nDimension = $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\n\nThese 12 generators form a closed Lie algebra, meaning the commutator of any two generators is a linear combination of the generators in the set.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **3D vs. 2D:** The symmetry analysis is specific to the dimension. The 2D Navier-Stokes equations have a different, larger symmetry group (a Kac-Moody-Virasoro type algebra which is infinite-dimensional even after imposing some physical constraints). The question explicitly asks for the 3D case.\n*   **Role of Viscosity:** The non-zero viscosity term $\\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$ is crucial. It breaks the particle-relabeling symmetry of the ideal Euler equations ($\\nu=0$) and establishes the specific scaling symmetry found here.\n*   **Implicit Assumptions:** The key point is recognizing the implicit assumption that the question asks for the finite-dimensional physical symmetry group, not the infinite-dimensional group of the bare differential equations. This assumption is standard in physics contexts.\n*   **Inclusion of Pressure Symmetries:** Formulations of the problem that eliminate pressure (e.g., using a vector potential) may lead to an 11-dimensional algebra (the \"Galilean similarity algebra\"). However, the question concerns the symmetries of the original Navier-Stokes equations in terms of $(\\mathbf{u}, p)$, for which the pressure shift is a valid symmetry.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nThe dimension of the Lie group is the number of independent parameters required to specify a transformation in the group, which equals the dimension of the associated Lie algebra. By systematically identifying all physical symmetries (time and space translations, rotations, Galilean boosts, scaling, and pressure shifts) and their corresponding infinitesimal generators, we arrive at a basis for the Lie algebra. Summing the number of basis vectors gives the dimension.\n- Basis: $\\{\\partial_t\\} \\cup \\{\\partial_{x_i}\\}_{i=1}^3 \\cup \\{J_i\\}_{i=1}^3 \\cup \\{G_i\\}_{i=1}^3 \\cup \\{D\\} \\cup \\{P\\}$\n- Count: $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\n\nFinal answer is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
