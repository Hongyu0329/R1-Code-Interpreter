    "Answering this question requires analyzing the structure of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion and counting the number of independent Lie algebra elements that appear with non-zero coefficients at a specific order.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula:**\n    The BCH formula provides the solution $Z$ to the equation $e^X e^Y = e^Z$ for non-commuting variables $X$ and $Y$. The solution is an infinite series of nested Lie brackets (commutators) of $X$ and $Y$:\n    $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Z_n(X,Y)$\n    where $Z_n(X,Y)$ is the homogeneous component of degree $n$, meaning it is a linear combination of commutators involving a total of $n$ instances of $X$ and $Y$. These terms $Z_n$ belong to the free Lie algebra generated by $X$ and $Y$.\n\n2.  **Decomposition by Bidegree:**\n    Each homogeneous component $Z_n$ can be further decomposed based on the number of $X$'s ($p$) and $Y$'s ($q$), where $p+q=n$:\n    $Z_n = \\sum_{p+q=n, p,q\\ge 1} Z_{p,q}(X,Y)$\n    Each component $Z_{p,q}$ is an element of the subspace of the free Lie algebra spanned by commutators with $p$ $X$'s and $q$ $Y$'s. This subspace is denoted $L(p,q)$.\n\n3.  **The Question:**\n    The question asks for the \"number of nonzero coefficients of order 10\". This means we need to find the number of linearly independent basis elements of the Lie algebra of degree 10 that have non-zero coefficients in the expansion of $Z_{10}$. It is widely conjectured and supported by evidence that if a component $Z_{p,q}$ is not identically zero, then its expansion in any standard basis of $L(p,q)$ will have all non-zero coefficients. Therefore, the problem reduces to identifying which components $Z_{p,q}$ are non-zero for $p+q=10$ and summing their dimensions.\n\n4.  **Identifying Non-Zero Components:**\n    There are important known properties and theorems about which $Z_{p,q}$ components vanish. A crucial result from a paper by F. Casas and A. Iserles (\"Explicit contributors to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff series\") states:\n    - For $n=p+q=2k$ (even degree), the component $Z_{k,k}$ (where the number of $X$'s and $Y$'s is equal) is zero if and only if $k$ is odd.\n    - For $p \\neq q$, the component $Z_{p,q}$ is never zero.\n\n    For our case, the total order is $n=10$.\n    -   Consider the component with an equal number of $X$'s and $Y$'s: $p=q=5$. Here, $n=10=2k$, so $k=5$. Since $k=5$ is odd, the theorem implies that **$Z_{5,5}(X,Y) = 0$**. Thus, there are no non-zero coefficients for any commutator with 5 $X$'s and 5 $Y$'s.\n    -   For all other components where $p+q=10$ but $p \\neq q$, the theorem states that $Z_{p,q}(X,Y)$ is non-zero. These components are for bidegrees $(1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6)$ and their symmetric counterparts $(9,1), (8,2), (7,3), (6,4)$.\n\n5.  **Counting the Number of Coefficients:**\n    The number of non-zero coefficients is the sum of the dimensions of the subspaces $L(p,q)$ for which $Z_{p,q} \\neq 0$.\n    The dimension of the space $L(p,q)$ is given by Witt's formula for multilinear components:\n    $\\dim L(p, q) = \\frac{1}{p+q} \\sum_{d|\\gcd(p,q)} \\mu(d) \\frac{((p+q)/d)!}{(p/d)! (q/d)!}$\n    where $\\mu$ is the MÃ¶bius function.\n\n6.  **Calculating Dimensions:**\n    We need to calculate $\\dim L(p,q)$ for $p+q=10$ and $p<q$:\n    -   **p=1, q=9:** $\\gcd(1,9)=1$.\n        $\\dim L(1,9) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\mu(1) \\frac{10!}{1!9!} \\right] = \\frac{1}{10} \\cdot 10 = 1$.\n    -   **p=2, q=8:** $\\gcd(2,8)=2$. Divisors are 1, 2.\n        $\\dim L(2,8) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\mu(1) \\frac{10!}{2!8!} + \\mu(2) \\frac{5!}{1!4!} \\right] = \\frac{1}{10} [45 + (-1) \\cdot 5] = \\frac{40}{10} = 4$.\n    -   **p=3, q=7:** $\\gcd(3,7)=1$.\n        $\\dim L(3,7) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\mu(1) \\frac{10!}{3!7!} \\right] = \\frac{1}{10} \\cdot 120 = 12$.\n    -   **p=4, q=6:** $\\gcd(4,6)=2$. Divisors are 1, 2.\n        $\\dim L(4,6) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\mu(1) \\frac{10!}{4!6!} + \\mu(2) \\frac{5!}{2!3!} \\right] = \\frac{1}{10} [210 + (-1) \\cdot 10] = \\frac{200}{10} = 20$.\n\n7.  **Final Summation:**\n    The total number of non-zero coefficients is the sum of dimensions for all pairs $(p,q)$ where $p \\neq q$. Since $\\dim L(p,q) = \\dim L(q,p)$, we can sum the dimensions for $p<q$ and multiply by 2.\n    Total Number = $2 \\times (\\dim L(1,9) + \\dim L(2,8) + \\dim L(3,7) + \\dim L(4,6))$\n    Total Number = $2 \\times (1 + 4 + 12 + 20)$\n    Total Number = $2 \\times 37 = 74$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is the sum of the dimensions of the spaces of Lie polynomials $L(p,q)$ for which the corresponding term $Z_{p,q}$ in the expansion is non-zero. For order 10, this includes all bidegrees $(p,q)$ such that $p+q=10$ except for $(5,5)$. The sum of the dimensions of these spaces is 74.\n\n<<<74>>>"
