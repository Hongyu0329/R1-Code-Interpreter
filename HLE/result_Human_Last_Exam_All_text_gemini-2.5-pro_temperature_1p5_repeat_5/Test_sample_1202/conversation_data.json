    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the core question:** The question asks for the primary mechanism that allows a duplicated gene to be kept (retained) in the genome and to evolve a different sequence/function (diverge), rather than being lost. Gene duplication creates a redundant copy of a gene. This redundancy means the new copy is not essential and is free from the usual purifying selection, allowing it to accumulate mutations.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Answer Choice A (Gene conversion):** Gene conversion is a process where a DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, making them more similar or identical. This process actively works *against* divergence. It homogenizes gene copies, so it does not explain how they diverge in function. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Answer Choice B (Pseudogenization):** This is the most common fate of a duplicate gene. The redundant copy accumulates mutations that disable it (e.g., stop codons, frameshifts), turning it into a non-functional pseudogene. While this involves sequence divergence, it results in the *loss* of the gene's function, not its *retention* as a functional element. The question specifies retention. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Answer Choice C (Neofunctionalization):** This model proposes that one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original function, while the second copy is free to accumulate mutations. By chance, a mutation may arise that gives this second copy a completely new, beneficial function. Selection will then maintain both copies: one for the old function and one for the new one. This explains both retention and divergence. This is a plausible and important mechanism.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Answer Choice D (Subfunctionalization):** This model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation model) proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex regulation. After duplication, each copy accumulates mutations that disable different, complementary subfunctions. For example, if the original gene was active in two tissues (heart and brain), one copy might lose the ability to function in the heart, while the other loses the ability to function in the brain. Now, both copies are required to perform the full range of the original gene's functions. This partitioning of labor ensures both copies are retained and diverge. This is also a very plausible and important mechanism.\n\n6.  **Evaluate Answer Choice E (Adaptive radiation):** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern where a single lineage diversifies rapidly to fill many different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is a macroevolutionary concept, not a specific molecular mechanism for the retention of an individual duplicate gene. Therefore, E is incorrect.\n\n7.  **Compare the most plausible options (C and D):** Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. The question asks for the \"most likely\" mechanism.\n    *   **Neofunctionalization** requires a rare event: a beneficial, gain-of-function mutation. Before such a mutation occurs, the duplicate gene is redundant and at high risk of being disabled by more common deleterious mutations (leading to pseudogenization).\n    *   **Subfunctionalization** relies on much more common loss-of-function mutations. By \"dividing the labor\" of the ancestral gene, both copies can quickly become essential for survival, thus \"rescuing\" them from the fate of pseudogenization.\n    *   Because subfunctionalization provides a more rapid and probable pathway to making both gene copies indispensable, many evolutionary biologists consider it a more likely mechanism for the *initial* retention of duplicate genes. It solves the \"waiting problem\" inherent in the neofunctionalization model. Once a gene pair is retained via subfunctionalization, it has a much longer evolutionary lifespan during which neofunctionalization might subsequently occur.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven that subfunctionalization relies on more common mutational events (loss-of-function) to secure the retention of both duplicates compared to neofunctionalization (which requires rare gain-of-function mutations), it is often considered the more probable or \"likely\" initial mechanism for preserving duplicate genes from loss.\n\n<<<D>>>"
