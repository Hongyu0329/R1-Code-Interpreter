    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the given curve.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the curve and the problem.**\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$.\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve. Let $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. The degree of $f(x)$ is $d=5$.\nThe genus of a hyperelliptic curve $y^2 = f(x)$ over a field of characteristic not 2 is given by $g = \\lfloor(d-1)/2\\rfloor$. Here, the curve is over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, which has characteristic 0.\nSo, the genus of the curve $C$ is $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of double points (also called nodes or ordinary double points) on the stable reduction of this curve over the 2-adic field $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\nThe stable reduction of a curve $C$ is a stable curve $C_s$ over the residue field (here $\\mathbb{F}_2$) that is birationally equivalent to $C$. An important property is that the arithmetic genus of the stable reduction $C_s$ is equal to the genus of the original curve $C$. So, the arithmetic genus of $C_s$ is $g_a(C_s) = 2$.\n\nA stable curve is a connected, reduced curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of the stable reduction.**\nThe stable reduction $C_s$ is a union of irreducible components $C_i$. Let $c$ be the number of components, $\\delta$ be the number of double points (nodes), and $g_i$ be the geometric genus of the component $C_i$. The arithmetic genus of $C_s$ is given by the formula:\n$g_a(C_s) = \\sum_{i=1}^{c} g_i + \\delta - c + 1$.\nSince we know $g_a(C_s)=2$, we have the relation:\n$2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{c} g_i + \\delta - c + 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the components of the stable reduction.**\nThe structure of the stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve $y^2 = f(x)$ is determined by the clustering of the roots of the polynomial $f(x)$ in the algebraic closure of the base field $\\bar{\\mathbb{Q}}_2$.\nThe roots $r_i$ and $r_j$ are said to belong to the same cluster if their 2-adic distance is small, which means $v_2(r_i - r_j)$ is large. A common criterion for ramified primes like $p=2$ is to group roots $r_i, r_j$ if $v_2(r_i - r_j) \\ge 1$.\n\nFirst, we need to find the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8)$. One root is $r_1=0$, so $v_2(r_1) = \\infty$. Let $g(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$.\nWe use the Newton polygon for $g(x)$ with respect to the 2-adic valuation $v_2$. The coefficients of $g(x)$ are $b_4=8, b_3=4, b_2=4, b_1=1, b_0=8$. Their 2-adic valuations are $v_2(b_4)=3, v_2(b_3)=2, v_2(b_2)=2, v_2(b_1)=0, v_2(b_0)=3$.\nThe points for the Newton polygon are $(i, v_2(b_i))$: $(4,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,0), (0,3)$.\nThe lower convex hull of these points consists of two segments:\n1.  A segment from $(1,0)$ to $(0,3)$ with slope $(3-0)/(0-1) = -3$. The horizontal length is 1. This corresponds to one root, let's call it $\\alpha$, with valuation $v_2(\\alpha) = -(-3) = 3$.\n2.  A segment from $(4,3)$ to $(1,0)$ with slope $(3-0)/(4-1) = 1$. The horizontal length is 3. This corresponds to three roots, $\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3$, each with valuation $v_2(\\beta_i) = -1$.\n\nSo, the five roots of $f(x)$ have valuations: $v_2(0)=\\infty$, $v_2(\\alpha)=3$, and $v_2(\\beta_i)=-1$ for $i=1,2,3$.\nNow we form clusters based on the condition $v_2(r_i - r_j) \\ge 1$:\n*   $v_2(\\alpha - 0) = v_2(\\alpha) = 3 \\ge 1$. So, $0$ and $\\alpha$ are in the same cluster.\n*   $v_2(\\beta_i - 0) = v_2(\\beta_i) = -1 < 1$. So, the $\\beta_i$ are not in the same cluster as 0.\n*   $v_2(\\beta_i - \\alpha) = \\min(v_2(\\beta_i), v_2(\\alpha)) = \\min(-1, 3) = -1 < 1$. So, the $\\beta_i$ are not in the same cluster as $\\alpha$.\n*   To check the distance between the $\\beta_i$, we can examine the residual polynomial associated with the slope 1 segment. It is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, which implies that $v_2(\\beta_i-\\beta_j)=-1$ for $i \\ne j$. Thus, they are not in the same cluster.\n\nThis partitions the roots into four clusters:\n$S_1 = \\{0, \\alpha\\}$\n$S_2 = \\{\\beta_1\\}$\n$S_3 = \\{\\beta_2\\}$\n$S_4 = \\{\\beta_3\\}$\n\nThe number of irreducible components of the stable reduction $C_s$ is equal to the number of root clusters. Thus, $c=4$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the genus of each component.**\nThe genus $g_i$ of the component $C_i$ corresponding to a cluster $S_i$ of size $k = |S_i|$ is given by $g_i = \\lfloor(k-1)/2\\rfloor$.\n*   For $S_1$, $k=2$, so $g_1 = \\lfloor(2-1)/2\\rfloor = 0$.\n*   For $S_2, S_3, S_4$, $k=1$, so $g_2=g_3=g_4 = \\lfloor(1-1)/2\\rfloor = 0$.\nAll components of the stable reduction are rational curves ($\\mathbb{P}^1$), so their genera are all zero. $\\sum g_i = 0$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the number of double points.**\nNow we use the genus formula from Step 2 with the values we found:\n$2 = \\sum g_i + \\delta - c + 1$\n$2 = 0 + \\delta - 4 + 1$\n$2 = \\delta - 3$\n$\\delta = 5$\n\nThe number of double points in the stable reduction is 5.\n\nFinal verification: This situation (genus drop to 0, Jacobian has good reduction, stable reduction is a graph of rational curves) occurs for curves with potentially good reduction. The genus formula implies that the dual graph of the components has first Betti number $b_1(\\Gamma) = \\delta - c + 1$. Here, $b_1(\\Gamma) = 5-4+1=2$. This means the graph of components has two independent loops, which is a known possibility for the stable reduction of a genus 2 curve.\n\nThe number of double points on the stable reduction is 5."
