    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **What:** The Beyond-Use Date (BUD).\n    *   **For:** A single dose container ampule.\n    *   **When:** From the time of puncture (i.e., when it is opened).\n    *   **Where:** In a sterile environment (such as an ISO Class 5 hood).\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Components and Their Significance:**\n    *   **BUD (Beyond-Use Date):** This is the date and/or time after which a compounded preparation should not be used. It is determined by the potential for microbial contamination, chemical degradation, and physical changes.\n    *   **Single-Dose Container:** This type of container is intended for a single use in a single patient. Crucially, it lacks antimicrobial preservatives. The absence of preservatives means that if microbes are introduced, they can grow freely.\n    *   **Ampule:** An ampule is a sealed glass container with a neck that is broken to access the medication. Once broken, it is an **open system** and **cannot be resealed**. This is the most critical feature for determining its BUD.\n    *   **Puncture:** In the context of an ampule, \"puncture\" means breaking the glass neck to open it. It is not like puncturing a rubber vial stopper with a needle.\n    *   **Sterile Environment:** This refers to a controlled space, like an ISO Class 5 Primary Engineering Control (PEC), which minimizes the introduction of airborne contaminants.\n\n3.  **Apply Pharmaceutical Compounding Standards (USP <797>):**\n    *   The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797> sets the standards for sterile compounding.\n    *   USP <797> makes a clear distinction between different types of containers based on their ability to resist contamination after being opened.\n    *   Because an ampule is an open system once the neck is broken, it is highly susceptible to contamination from the surrounding environment (even a sterile one) and touch.\n    *   The guidelines state that contents from a single-dose ampule must be used immediately after opening. It cannot be stored for any period.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Contrast with Other Containers:**\n    *   **Ampule:** Open system. Cannot be stored. Must be used immediately.\n    *   **Single-Dose Vial:** Closed system (rubber stopper provides a barrier). If punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment, it can be used for up to 12 hours (per the 2023 USP <797> revision). If punctured outside an ISO Class 5 environment, it must be used within 1 hour or discarded.\n    *   **Multi-Dose Vial:** Closed system with preservatives. Can be used for up to 28 days after the first puncture, unless the manufacturer specifies otherwise.\n\n    The fact that the container is an **ampule** is the determining factor. The sterile environment does not change the fact that the container is fundamentally open and unsealable.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Do not confuse an ampule with a vial.** The BUD rules for these two container types are drastically different because one (vial) can be resealed by its stopper while the other (ampule) cannot.\n2.  **\"Immediate Use\" is the BUD.** The concept of a BUD isn't always a long period like hours or days. For an opened ampule, the BUD is effectively zero storage time. The medication must be withdrawn and used right away.\n3.  **Discard unused portions.** Any medication remaining in an opened ampule after the required dose has been drawn must be discarded immediately. It cannot be saved for later.\n4.  **The sterile environment does not grant extended time.** While working in an ISO Class 5 environment is essential for aseptic technique, it does not override the physical limitations of an open ampule. The rule for immediate use still applies.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, a single-dose ampule, once opened, is an un-resealable container. According to USP <797> standards, its contents are highly susceptible to contamination and must be used immediately. There is no allowable storage time.\n\n<<<The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) is for **immediate use only**. Any unused portion must be discarded immediately and cannot be stored for any length of time.>>>"
