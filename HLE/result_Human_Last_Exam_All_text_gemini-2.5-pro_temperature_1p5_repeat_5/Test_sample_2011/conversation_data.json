    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes in a graph with 128 vertices.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** A graph `G` with a set of vertices `V` where `|V|=128`.\n*   **Clique:** A subset of vertices, `C ⊆ V`, where every two distinct vertices in `C` are connected by an edge. A clique of size `k` is a clique with `k` vertices.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `C ⊆ V`, the induced subgraph `G[C]` is the graph whose vertex set is `C` and whose edge set consists of all edges in the original graph `G` that have both endpoints in `C`.\n*   **Clique size appearing as an induced subgraph:** A number `k` is a possible clique size if there exists a subset of vertices `C` with `|C|=k` such that the induced subgraph `G[C]` is a complete graph (`K_k`). This is equivalent to `C` being a clique in `G`.\n*   **The Goal:** We want to find a single graph `G` on 128 vertices for which the number of different values of `k` (where `k` is a possible induced clique size) is maximized.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the set of possible clique sizes**\n\nLet `G` be an arbitrary graph on `n=128` vertices. Let `S` be the set of all integers `k` such that `G` contains an induced clique of size `k`. We want to maximize `|S|`.\n\nLet's establish a key property of the set `S`. Suppose `k` is a size in `S`, with `k > 1`.\n*   By definition, this means there is a set of vertices `C` in `G` with `|C| = k` such that `G[C]` is a complete graph `K_k`.\n*   This implies that every vertex in `C` is connected to every other vertex in `C`.\n*   Now, let's consider a subset of `C`, call it `C'`, with `|C'| = k-1`. We can form such a subset by simply removing any single vertex from `C`.\n*   Since all vertices in `C` are pairwise connected, all vertices in the subset `C'` must also be pairwise connected.\n*   Therefore, the subgraph induced by `C'`, `G[C']`, is a complete graph of size `k-1`, i.e., a `K_{k-1}`.\n*   This means that if `k ∈ S` (and `k>1`), then it must be that `k-1 ∈ S`.\n\nBy applying this property repeatedly, if the largest clique size in `G` is `k_max`, then `S` must contain `k_max`, `k_max-1`, `k_max-2`, ..., down to 1. (A single vertex is always a clique of size 1, so `1 ∈ S` for any non-empty graph).\nThis means that for any graph `G`, the set of its induced clique sizes is always of the form `S = {1, 2, 3, ..., k_max}`, where `k_max` is the size of the largest clique in `G`.\n\n**Step 3: Reformulate the problem**\n\nThe number of different clique sizes is `|S|`, which, based on the analysis in Step 2, is equal to `k_max`. The value `k_max` is the size of the largest clique in the graph `G`, which is known as the **clique number** of `G`, denoted `ω(G)`.\n\nSo, the original question is equivalent to the following simpler question: \"What is the maximum possible clique number, `ω(G)`, for a graph `G` with `n=128` vertices?\"\n\n**Step 4: Solve the reformulated problem**\n\nThe clique number `ω(G)` of any graph `G` on `n` vertices can be at most `n`. This is because a clique is a subset of the vertices, so its size cannot exceed the total number of vertices.\n`ω(G) ≤ n`.\n\nWe need to check if this maximum value is achievable. We can construct a graph `G` on `n` vertices with `ω(G) = n`. The **complete graph** on `n` vertices, denoted `K_n`, is a graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n*   The entire set of `n` vertices in `K_n` forms a clique.\n*   Therefore, the clique number of `K_n` is `ω(K_n) = n`.\n\n**Step 5: Apply to n = 128 and find the final answer**\n\nFor `n=128`, the maximum possible clique number is 128. This can be achieved by choosing our graph `G` to be the complete graph on 128 vertices, `K_{128}`.\n\nLet's verify the number of clique sizes for `G = K_{128}`:\n*   For any integer `k` between 1 and 128 (i.e., `1 ≤ k ≤ 128`), we can choose any subset of `k` vertices from the 128 available vertices.\n*   Since all vertices in `K_{128}` are pairwise connected, this subset of `k` vertices will form a clique of size `k`.\n*   Therefore, `K_{128}` has induced cliques of every size from 1 to 128.\n*   The set of different clique sizes is `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`.\n*   The number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\nSince we have shown that the number of different clique sizes cannot exceed 128 and we have found a graph that achieves this number, 128 is the maximum possible value.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The distinction between a \"clique\" and a \"maximal clique\" is important. The question asks about cliques, not maximal cliques. If it were about maximal cliques, the answer would be much smaller (15 for `n=128`).\n*   The use of \"induced subgraphs\" is key. A set of `k` vertices forms a clique if and only if the subgraph induced by these vertices is a `K_k`. So the wording is precise.\n*   The logic that the set of clique sizes is always a continuous interval `[1, k_max]` is the central step that simplifies the problem.\n\nFinal Answer is the maximum value of `k_max`, which is `n=128`.\n\n<<<128>>>"
