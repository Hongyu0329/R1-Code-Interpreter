    "An analysis of the question is as follows, with step-by-step analysis and careful points listed.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Goal**\n\nWe are asked to find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s)$. This means we need to find two matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy the following conditions:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$.\n2.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are matrices whose entries are **stable** and **proper** rational functions. A rational function is stable if all its poles are in the open left-half of the complex plane (Re(s) < 0). It is proper if the degree of the numerator is less than or equal to the degree of the denominator.\n3.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are **left coprime**. This is a technical condition which, for our purposes, can be verified by checking that the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all $s$ in the closed right-half plane (CRHP), i.e., for all $s$ such that Re(s) $\\geq$ 0.\n\n### **2. Analyzing the Transfer Function H(s)**\n\nFirst, let's write out the given transfer function and identify its poles.\n\\[\nH(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe poles of the elements of $H(s)$ are the roots of the denominators. We have poles at:\n*   $s = -1$ (from the terms $\\frac{1}{s+1}$ and $\\frac{1}{s^2-1}$)\n*   $s = 1$ (from the term $\\frac{1}{s^2-1}$)\n\nThe pole at $s = -1$ is in the left-half plane, so it is a **stable** pole.\nThe pole at $s = 1$ is in the right-half plane, so it is an **unstable** pole.\n\nThe goal of the factorization is essentially to move this unstable pole from the \"denominator\" part of the system ($D(s)$) to the \"numerator\" part ($N(s)$), ensuring both $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are stable.\n\n### **3. Algebraic Method of Factorization**\n\nThis method involves constructing $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ directly from the equation $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$. We need to choose the elements of $D(s)$ such that all elements of both $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are stable and proper.\n\nLet $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. Then $N(s)$ is given by:\n\\[\nN(s) = D(s)H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11} \\\\ d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Careful Point 1: Ensuring Stability of N(s).**\nThe entries of $N(s)$ must be stable. The unstable pole at $s=1$ appears in the $(2,1)$ entry of $H(s)$.\nLet's analyze the entries of $N(s)$:\n*   $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s)$ and $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)$. For $N(s)$ to be stable, $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{21}(s)$ must be stable.\n*   $n_{11}(s) = d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)}$. The term with $d_{12}$ has the unstable pole. To make $n_{11}(s)$ stable, the term $d_{12}(s)$ must cancel the $(s-1)$ in the denominator. This means $d_{12}(s)$ must have a zero at $s=1$.\n*   $n_{21}(s) = d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)}$. Similarly, to make $n_{21}(s)$ stable, $d_{22}(s)$ must have a zero at $s=1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Choosing a simple D(s).**\nLet's construct the simplest possible $D(s)$ that satisfies the stability conditions.\n*   The first row of $H(s)$, $[\\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\quad 1]$, is already stable. So, we can try to decouple the first row of $D(s)$ from the second by choosing $d_{12}(s) = 0$. Since this satisfies the condition ($d_{12}(1)=0$), it's a good choice. For simplicity, let's set $d_{11}(s)=1$. This is stable and proper. So the first row of $D(s)$ is $[1 \\quad 0]$.\n*   For the second row, we need $d_{22}(s)$ to have a zero at $s=1$. The simplest stable, proper rational function with a zero at $s=1$ is of the form $k \\frac{s-1}{s+\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha > 0$. A common choice is $\\alpha=1$. So let's try $d_{22}(s) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}$. To keep things simple, let's set $d_{21}(s)=0$. This is stable and proper.\n\nThis gives us the candidate matrix:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe entries of this $D(s)$ are stable (pole at $s=-1$) and proper.\n\n### **4. Calculating N(s) and Verifying the Factorization**\n\nNow we calculate $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + 0 & 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\\\ 0 + \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\cdot \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 0+0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe entries of this $N(s)$ are stable (poles at $s=-1$) and proper.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Verification of $H = D^{-1}N$.**\nLet's compute $D^{-1}(s)$:\n\\[\nD^{-1}(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & (\\frac{s-1}{s+1})^{-1} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s+1}{s-1} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nNow, let's compute $D^{-1}(s)N(s)$:\n\\[\nD^{-1}(s)N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s+1}{s-1} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{s+1}{s-1} \\cdot \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = H(s)\n\\]\nThe factorization is mathematically correct.\n\n### **5. Verifying Coprimeness**\n\n**Careful Point 4: Coprimeness check.**\nThe final step is to check if $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. We must check that the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank (rank 2) for all $s$ in the CRHP (Re(s) $\\geq$ 0). The rank can only drop at values of $s$ where a determinant of some submatrix becomes zero.\nThe \"weakest\" point is $s=1$, because $\\det(D(1)) = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1-1}{1+1} = 0$.\nLet's check the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ at $s=1$:\n\\[\n[D(1) \\quad N(1)] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc|cc} 1 & 0 & \\frac{1-1}{1+1} & 1 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1-1}{1+1} & \\frac{2}{(1+1)^2} & 0 \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc|cc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{2}{4} & 0 \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1/2 & 0 \\end{array} \\right]\n\\]\nThe two rows of this matrix are linearly independent, so the rank is 2. The coprimeness condition is satisfied at $s=1$. For other $s$ in the CRHP where $\\det(D(s)) \\ne 0$, the matrix $[D(s) \\ N(s)]$ will have rank 2 because $D(s)$ itself is invertible.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ is given by:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n<<<\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix}$, $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n>>>"
