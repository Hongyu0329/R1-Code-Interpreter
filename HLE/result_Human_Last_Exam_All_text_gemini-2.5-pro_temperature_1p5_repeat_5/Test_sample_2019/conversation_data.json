    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem of placing 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Board and Constraints**\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid.\n*   **Toroidal:** The board wraps around on all four edges. If you go off the right edge, you reappear on the left. If you go off the top, you reappear on the bottom.\n*   **Queens:** We are placing 4 queens.\n*   **Non-attacking condition:** No two queens can threaten each other. On a toroidal board, a queen at `(r, c)` (row, column) attacks:\n    1.  All squares in row `r`.\n    2.  All squares in column `c`.\n    3.  All squares on its two diagonals. Due to the toroidal nature, the diagonals also wrap around. This can be expressed mathematically. For a queen at `(r1, c1)` and another at `(r2, c2)`, they are on the same:\n        *   **Main diagonal** if `c1 - r1 ≡ c2 - r2 (mod 5)`.\n        *   **Anti-diagonal** if `c1 + r1 ≡ c2 + r2 (mod 5)`.\n\nThis means for any valid placement of 4 queens at `(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), (r4, c4)`:\n*   All `r_i` values must be distinct.\n*   All `c_i` values must be distinct.\n*   All `(c_i - r_i) mod 5` values must be distinct.\n*   All `(c_i + r_i) mod 5` values must be distinct.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **The \"Toroidal\" property is crucial:** It changes the nature of diagonal attacks completely compared to a standard board. There are 5 main diagonals and 5 anti-diagonals, and each contains exactly 5 squares.\n2.  **Partial Problem (`k < n`):** We are placing 4 queens on a 5x5 board, not 5 queens. This suggests that the problem might be related to the full 5-queen solution.\n3.  **The \"Completion\" Argument:** The most elegant way to solve this is to see if there's a relationship between a 4-queen arrangement and a full 5-queen solution. Specifically, can any valid 4-queen arrangement be extended to a 5-queen solution?\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The \"Completion\" Insight**\n\nConsider any valid placement of 4 non-attacking queens.\n*   Since the 4 queens must be in different rows, there is exactly one empty row. Let's call its index `r_empty`.\n*   Similarly, there is exactly one empty column, `c_empty`.\n*   The 4 queens occupy 4 distinct main diagonals (`(c-r) mod 5`). So there is exactly one unoccupied main diagonal, `d_empty`.\n*   The 4 queens occupy 4 distinct anti-diagonals (`(c+r) mod 5`). So there is exactly one unoccupied anti-diagonal, `a_empty`.\n\nNow, let's consider placing a 5th queen at the intersection of the empty row and empty column, at coordinate `(r_empty, c_empty)`. By construction, this 5th queen does not attack any of the other 4 queens by row or column. We need to check if it attacks on a diagonal.\n\n**Step 2: Proving the \"Completion\" Argument**\n\nThis step uses a property of modular arithmetic. The sum of all indices from 0 to 4 is `0+1+2+3+4 = 10`, which is `0 (mod 5)`.\n\nLet the coordinates of the four queens be `(r_i, c_i)` for `i=1,2,3,4`.\n*   `r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 + r_empty = 10 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`  =>  `r_empty ≡ -(r_1+r_2+r_3+r_4) (mod 5)`\n*   `c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + c_4 + c_empty = 10 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`  =>  `c_empty ≡ -(c_1+c_2+c_3+c_4) (mod 5)`\n*   The occupied main diagonal indices are `d_i = c_i - r_i`.  The sum of all 5 main diagonal indices is also 0 (mod 5).\n    `d_empty ≡ -(d_1+d_2+d_3+d_4) ≡ -Σ(c_i - r_i) ≡ Σr_i - Σc_i (mod 5)`\n*   The occupied anti-diagonal indices are `a_i = c_i + r_i`.\n    `a_empty ≡ -(a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4) ≡ -Σ(c_i + r_i) ≡ -Σc_i - Σr_i (mod 5)`\n\nNow, let's find the diagonal indices for the 5th queen at `(r_empty, c_empty)`:\n*   **Main Diagonal:** `c_empty - r_empty ≡ (-Σc_i) - (-Σr_i) ≡ Σr_i - Σc_i (mod 5)`. This is exactly `d_empty`.\n*   **Anti-Diagonal:** `c_empty + r_empty ≡ (-Σc_i) + (-Σr_i) ≡ -Σc_i - Σr_i (mod 5)`. This is exactly `a_empty`.\n\nThis proves that placing the 5th queen in the empty row and column uniquely fills the empty diagonals. Therefore, **any valid 4-queen arrangement is a sub-arrangement of exactly one valid 5-queen solution.**\n\n**Step 3: Counting the 5-Queen Solutions**\n\nThe problem now transforms into finding the number of ways to take a full 5-queen solution and remove one queen. This is `(Number of 5-queen solutions) × 5`.\n\nA 5-queen solution can be represented by a permutation `p` of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`, where the queens are at `(i, p(i))` for `i=0,..,4`. The diagonal constraints require that `p(i) - i (mod 5)` and `p(i) + i (mod 5)` also result in permutations of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n\nSolutions to this are known as \"complete permutations\". For a prime board size `n`, these are given by linear congruences `p(i) = a*i + b (mod n)`.\n1.  `p` is a permutation if `a` is not 0.\n2.  `p(i) - i = (a-1)i + b` is a permutation if `a-1` is not 0. So `a ≠ 1`.\n3.  `p(i) + i = (a+1)i + b` is a permutation if `a+1` is not 0. So `a ≠ -1 ≡ 4 (mod 5)`.\n\nThe possible values for `a` in `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` are thus restricted to `a=2` and `a=3`.\nThe value `b` simply shifts the solution vertically and can be any of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` (5 choices).\n\nSo, the total number of 5-queen solutions is:\n`2 (choices for a) × 5 (choices for b) = 10` solutions.\n\n**Step 4: Final Calculation**\n\nWe have established a one-to-many correspondence: each 4-queen solution comes from exactly one 5-queen solution by removing a queen.\n*   Number of 5-queen solutions = 10.\n*   Number of ways to remove one queen from a 5-queen solution = `C(5, 1) = 5`.\n\nTotal ways to place 4 non-attacking queens = (Number of 5-queen solutions) × 5\nTotal ways = 10 × 5 = 50.\n\n<<<50>>>"
