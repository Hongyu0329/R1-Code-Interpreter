The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by:
$Z = \int \mathcal{D}\bar{\psi} \mathcal{D}\psi \, e^{-S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi]}$
where the path integral is performed over Grassmann fields $\psi(\tau, \vec{x})$ and $\bar{\psi}(\tau, \vec{x})$ that satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction $\tau$:
$\psi(0, \vec{x}) = -\psi(\beta, \vec{x})$
$\bar{\psi}(0, \vec{x}) = -\bar{\psi}(\beta, \vec{x})$
Here, $S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi]$ is the Euclidean action of the fermionic system and $\beta$ is the inverse temperature.
