    "To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$, we proceed with the following steps.\n\n**Step 1: The K端nneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology**\n\nThe central tool for calculating the bounded cohomology of a direct product of groups is the K端nneth formula. For any two discrete groups $G_1$ and $G_2$, and any integer $n \\ge 0$, there is a natural isomorphism for bounded cohomology with real coefficients:\n\n$H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p+q=n} H_b^p(G_1, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{R}} H_b^q(G_2, \\mathbb{R})$\n\nThis formula allows us to express the bounded cohomology of the product group in terms of the bounded cohomology of its factors.\n\n**Step 2: Applying the K端nneth Formula to the specific problem**\n\nWe are interested in the case where $G_1 = T$, $G_2 = T$, and the degree is $n=4$. Substituting these into the formula, we get:\n\n$H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p+q=4} H_b^p(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^q(T, \\mathbb{R})$\n\nWe need to consider all pairs of non-negative integers $(p,q)$ such that $p+q=4$. These pairs are (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), and (4,0). The formula expands to the following direct sum:\n\n$H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\left( H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\right) \\oplus \\left( H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\right) \\oplus \\left( H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\right) \\oplus \\left( H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\right) \\oplus \\left( H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\right)$\n\n**Step 3: Bounded Cohomology of Thompson's Group T**\n\nTo evaluate the terms in the direct sum, we must know the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of Thompson's group $T$. These are well-established results in the field:\n*   **Degree 0:** For any non-empty group, $H_b^0(G, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $\\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$.\n*   **Degree 1:** For any group, $H_b^1(G, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$. Thus, $\\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$.\n*   **Degree 2:** A significant result by E. Ghys shows that $H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, which is generated by the restriction of the bounded Euler class. Thus, $\\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$.\n*   **Degree $\\ge 3$:** A result by M. Burger and N. Monod establishes that the higher bounded cohomology groups of $T$ vanish. For $n \\ge 3$, $H_b^n(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$. Thus, $\\dim H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ and $\\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Dimension**\n\nWe now compute the dimension of each term in the K端nneth formula expansion using the fact that $\\dim(V \\otimes W) = (\\dim V) \\cdot (\\dim W)$.\n\n*   **Term (0,4):** $\\dim(H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 1 \\times 0 = 0$.\n*   **Term (1,3):** $\\dim(H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 0 \\times 0 = 0$.\n*   **Term (2,2):** $\\dim(H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n*   **Term (3,1):** $\\dim(H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 0 \\times 0 = 0$.\n*   **Term (4,0):** $\\dim(H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 0 \\times 1 = 0$.\n\nThe dimension of a direct sum of vector spaces is the sum of the dimensions of the individual spaces. Therefore, we sum the dimensions of all the terms:\n\n$\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 1$.\n\nThe only non-zero contribution to the fourth bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ comes from the tensor product of the second bounded cohomology groups of the two factors.\n\n<<<1>>>"
