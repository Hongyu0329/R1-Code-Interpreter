    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Locate Waskaganish**\nFirst, we need to pinpoint the location of Waskaganish. Waskaganish is a Cree community located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec, Canada. It sits on the southeastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories**\nNext, we identify the provinces and territories that are geographically near Waskaganish.\n*   **Quebec:** Waskaganish is located within Quebec, so this is excluded by the question.\n*   **Ontario:** The province of Ontario lies to the west and south of James Bay. The Ontario-Quebec border runs south from the southernmost point of James Bay.\n*   **Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut includes all the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay. The largest and most prominent island in James Bay is Akimiski Island, which is part of Nunavut.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** This province is located far to the east of Waskaganish.\n*   **New Brunswick:** This province is located far to the southeast of Waskaganish.\n\nBased on this initial assessment, the two most likely candidates for the closest province or territory are **Ontario** and **Nunavut**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proximity of Ontario**\nWaskaganish is located on the coast, a relatively short distance east of where the Quebec-Ontario border begins at the southern end of James Bay. The border between the two provinces is a land border in this region. The straight-line distance from the community of Waskaganish to the Ontario land border is quite short, estimated to be around 50-60 kilometers to the southwest.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Proximity of Nunavut**\nThe closest part of the territory of Nunavut to Waskaganish is Akimiski Island, which lies to the northwest, out in James Bay. To reach Nunavut from Waskaganish, one must cross a significant stretch of open water. The distance from Waskaganish to the southern coast of Akimiski Island is approximately 170 kilometers.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Distances and Conclude**\nComparing the two shortest distances:\n*   Distance to Ontario (land border): ~50-60 km\n*   Distance to Nunavut (Akimiski Island): ~170 km\n\nThe distance to the Ontario border is significantly shorter than the distance to the nearest part of Nunavut.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The question asks for the closest \"province or territory,\" which means we are looking for the shortest straight-line (geodesic) distance from Waskaganish to the boundary of another province or territory.\n*   It's important to distinguish between land borders and maritime borders. In this case, Waskaganish is much closer to a land border (Ontario) than to the closest piece of land belonging to another territory (Nunavut's Akimiski Island).\n*   Visual inspection on a map confirms that Waskaganish is situated near the \"corner\" where the southern and eastern shores of James Bay meet, placing it very close to the Ontario border.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is Ontario.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
