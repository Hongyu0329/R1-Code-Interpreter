The final answer is a structured list of amino acid residues and regions for each part of the question based on established structural and functional data.

**1) Residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues are located in the conserved hydrophobic groove (the Beta Interaction Domain, or BID) within the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain of the beta-1 subunit and are essential for high-affinity physical binding. The residue numbering corresponds to the human CACNB1 canonical sequence (UniProt P54283).
*   **Y320** (Tyrosine at position 320)
*   **W323** (Tryptophan at position 323)
*   **M339** (Methionine at position 339)
*   **V342** (Valine at position 342)
*   **I346** (Isoleucine at position 346)
*   **L395** (Leucine at position 395)
*   **V402** (Valine at position 402)

**2) Residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties of the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues and regions are critical for the allosteric modulation of channel function (e.g., activation, inactivation) that occurs upon binding.
*   **The N-terminal Region (residues ~1-30):** This entire variable region, particularly in the beta-1b splice isoform, acts as a functional domain that significantly modulates channel inactivation kinetics.
*   **W237** (Tryptophan at position 237): Located in the RT-loop of the SH3 domain, this residue is a key hotspot for modulating voltage-dependent inactivation.
*   **E459** (Glutamate at position 459): Located in the "Hook region" of the GK domain, this residue is involved in allosterically transmitting the binding signal to alter channel gating, particularly inactivation.
