    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific paper:** The question refers to one of Einstein's \"Annus Mirabilis\" (Miracle Year) papers from 1905. The paper on Brownian motion is titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen,\" which translates to \"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat.\"\n\n2.  **Examine the paper for direct citations:** If one inspects the original 1905 paper published in *Annalen der Physik*, there are no formal bibliographic citations to other scientists in the way we use them today. The paper is notable for its originality and lack of references to prior work on the subject. A direct search for names like \"Boltzmann\" in the paper's text will not yield a result.\n\n3.  **Analyze the paper's title and intellectual framework:** The key to answering the question lies in the paper's full title. Einstein explicitly states that the motion he is describing is a requirement of the **\"molecular-kinetic theory of heat.\"** This is a crucial point.\n\n4.  **Identify the key figure behind the theory:** In the early 20th century, the molecular-kinetic theory of heat was inextricably linked to one primary figure: **Ludwig Boltzmann**. He was the theory's most powerful and influential proponent, having developed its statistical foundations. By invoking the theory by name, Einstein was making a clear intellectual acknowledgment of Boltzmann's foundational work.\n\n5.  **Connect the theory to the term \"lectures\":** Ludwig Boltzmann's most famous and comprehensive work on this subject was his book titled ***Vorlesungen über Gastheorie***, which translates to ***Lectures on Gas Theory***. This book, published in two volumes (1896 and 1898), was the definitive text on the subject, and it is known from Einstein's letters that he studied this work intensively on his own.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the conclusion:** While Einstein did not formally cite \"Boltzmann\" with a footnote or in-text reference, he cited the theory that Boltzmann was the chief architect of. The canonical work encapsulating this theory was Boltzmann's published \"Lectures\". Therefore, by citing the \"molecular-kinetic theory of heat,\" Einstein was, in effect, citing the work contained in Ludwig Boltzmann's published lectures.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Indirect vs. Direct Citation:** The citation is intellectual and implicit, not a formal bibliographic citation as used in modern academic papers.\n*   **\"Lectures\" as a Published Work:** The question refers to \"lectures,\" which in this case points to Boltzmann's famous book, *Vorlesungen über Gastheorie* (*Lectures on Gas Theory*). Einstein studied this book, but did not attend Boltzmann's actual classroom lectures.\n*   **Distinction from other works:** It's important not to confuse this paper with Einstein's PhD dissertation from the same year, where he thanked his supervisors, Professors Alfred Kleiner and Heinrich Burkhardt.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the person whose lectures were conceptually cited is Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
