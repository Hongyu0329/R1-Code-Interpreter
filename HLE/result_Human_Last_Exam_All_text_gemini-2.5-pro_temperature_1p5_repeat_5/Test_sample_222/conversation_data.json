    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an 8-point sequence. Let's denote the 8-point sequence as `y(n)`:\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\nFinding the N-point DFT of a sequence with length M > N implies time-domain aliasing. We need to create a 4-point sequence, let's call it `y_a(n)`, by aliasing `y(n)`. This is done by \"wrapping\" the sequence and adding the parts:\n`y_a(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nA key property of the DFT states that the DFT of this aliased sequence `y_a(n)` is equivalent to taking the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of the original sequence `y(n)`. If `Y(k)` is the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`, the desired 4-point DFT, let's call it `Z(k)`, is given by:\n`Z(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nOur goal is to find `Z(k)`. We can do this without explicitly finding `x(n)` and `h(n)` in the time domain by using frequency domain properties.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` to `X(k)` and `H(k)`\nThe sequence `y(n)` is formed by interleaving the sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`. Specifically:\n`y(2m) = x(m)`\n`y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nThis is the standard decomposition used in the decimation-in-time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The 8-point DFT `Y(k)` of the interleaved sequence `y(n)` can be expressed in terms of the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)` as:\n`Y(k) = X(k \\pmod 4) + W_8^k H(k \\pmod 4)`\nwhere `W_N^k = e^{-j2\\pi k/N}` is the DFT twiddle factor. Since `X(k)` and `H(k)` are 4-point DFTs, they are periodic with period 4, so `X(k \\pmod 4) = X(k)` and `H(k \\pmod 4) = H(k)`.\n\n### Step 3: Derive the Formula for the Desired 4-point DFT `Z(k)`\nAs established in Step 1, we need to calculate `Z(k) = Y(2k)`. We can substitute `2k` into the formula from Step 2:\n`Z(k) = Y(2k) = X(2k \\pmod 4) + W_8^{2k} H(2k \\pmod 4)`\n\nWe can simplify the twiddle factor:\n`W_8^{2k} = (e^{-j2\\pi/8})^{2k} = e^{-j4\\pi k/8} = e^{-j2\\pi k/4} = W_4^k`\n\nSo, the formula for our target DFT `Z(k)` becomes:\n`Z(k) = X(2k \\pmod 4) + W_4^k H(2k \\pmod 4)`\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Calculation\nWe are given the input DFTs:\n`X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n`H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n\nWe will calculate `Z(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n**For k = 0:**\n`Z(0) = X(0 \\pmod 4) + W_4^0 H(0 \\pmod 4)`\n`Z(0) = X(0) + 1 \\cdot H(0)`\n`Z(0) = 1 + 1 \\cdot (0) = 1`\n\n**For k = 1:**\n`Z(1) = X(2 \\pmod 4) + W_4^1 H(2 \\pmod 4)`\n`Z(1) = X(2) + (-j) \\cdot H(2)`\n`Z(1) = -1 + (-j) \\cdot (1) = -1 - j`\n\n**For k = 2:**\n`Z(2) = X(4 \\pmod 4) + W_4^2 H(4 \\pmod 4)`\n`Z(2) = X(0) + (-1) \\cdot H(0)`\n`Z(2) = 1 + (-1) \\cdot (0) = 1`\n\n**For k = 3:**\n`Z(3) = X(6 \\pmod 4) + W_4^3 H(6 \\pmod 4)`\n`Z(3) = X(2) + (j) \\cdot H(2)`\n`Z(3) = -1 + (j) \\cdot (1) = -1 + j`\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\nBy combining the results, the 4-point DFT `Z(k)` is:\n`Z(k) = [Z(0), Z(1), Z(2), Z(3)]`\n`Z(k) = [1, -1 - j, 1, -1 + j]`\n\n<<<[1, -1 - j, 1, -1 + j]>>>"
