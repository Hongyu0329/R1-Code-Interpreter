    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Pauli Channel\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acts on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit). The state of such a system is represented by a $d \\times d$ density matrix $\\rho$. The channel is defined as:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{jk} U_{jk} \\rho U_{jk}^\\dagger $$\nwhere:\n*   $\\{p_{jk}\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_{jk} \\ge 0$ for all $j,k$ and $\\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{jk} = 1$.\n*   $\\{U_{jk} = X^j Z^k\\}_{j,k=0}^{d-1}$ are the generalized Pauli operators (or discrete Weyl-Heisenberg operators). Here, $X$ and $Z$ are the shift and phase operators acting on the computational basis $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle, \\dots, |d-1\\rangle\\}$:\n    *   $X|l\\rangle = |l+1 \\pmod d\\rangle$\n    *   $Z|l\\rangle = e^{2\\pi i l / d} |l\\rangle$\n*   The set of $d^2$ Pauli operators $\\{U_{jk}\\}$ forms an orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbb{C}^d)$. They are also unitary operators.\n\nThe Kraus operators for this channel are $\\{K_{jk} = \\sqrt{p_{jk}} U_{jk}\\}$. To simplify notation, let's re-index the $d^2$ Kraus operators by a single index $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, d^2\\}$. The channel is then $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{i} K_i \\rho K_i^\\dagger$, where $K_i = \\sqrt{p_i} U_i$. Let $S$ be the set of indices $i$ for which $p_i > 0$. The sum can be taken over $i \\in S$.\n\n### Step 2: The Complementary Channel and its Choi Matrix\n\nAny quantum channel $\\Lambda$ has a complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$. The rank of a channel is defined as the rank of its Choi-JamioÅ‚kowski matrix $J(\\Lambda)$. We are interested in the rank of $J(\\Lambda^c)$.\n\nGiven a channel $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_i K_i \\rho K_i^\\dagger$, the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ can be constructed. The Choi matrix of this complementary channel, $J(\\Lambda^c)$, which acts on the space $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E \\cong \\mathbb{C}^d \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{|S|} $, is given by the formula:\n$$ J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i,j \\in S} (K_j^\\dagger K_i)^T \\otimes |i\\rangle\\langle j|_E $$\nwhere $\\{|i\\rangle_E\\}_{i \\in S}$ forms an orthonormal basis for the environment Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_E$.\n\nSubstituting the Kraus operators for the Pauli channel, $K_i = \\sqrt{p_i} U_i$:\n$$ J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i,j \\in S} \\left( (\\sqrt{p_j} U_j)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_i} U_i) \\right)^T \\otimes |i\\rangle\\langle j|_E $$\n$$ J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i,j \\in S} \\sqrt{p_i p_j} (U_j^\\dagger U_i)^T \\otimes |i\\rangle\\langle j|_E $$\nHere, we have used the fact that $p_i, p_j$ are real. Since we assume $p_i>0$ for $i \\in S$, the square roots are well-defined and positive.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Rank of the Choi Matrix\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the dimension of its column space. We can view $J(\\Lambda^c)$ as a block matrix where the blocks are indexed by $(i,j)$. The rank is the number of linearly independent block columns. Let's test for linear independence.\n\nA linear combination of the block columns is of the form $\\sum_{j \\in S} c_j \\cdot (\\text{j-th block column})$. Setting this to zero means:\n$$ \\sum_{j \\in S} c_j \\left( \\sum_{i \\in S} \\sqrt{p_i p_j} (U_j^\\dagger U_i)^T \\otimes |i\\rangle\\langle j|_E \\right) = 0 $$\nfor some complex coefficients $\\{c_j\\}$. Since we are interested in the span of the columns, we can absorb the constant factors and analyze the linear independence of the vectors $|\\Phi_j\\rangle = \\sum_{i \\in S} (U_j^\\dagger U_i)^T \\otimes |i\\rangle_E$ for $j \\in S$.\nA linear combination being zero means:\n$$ \\sum_{j \\in S} c_j \\sum_{i \\in S} (U_j^\\dagger U_i)^T \\otimes |i\\rangle_E = 0 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i \\in S} \\left( \\sum_{j \\in S} c_j (U_j^\\dagger U_i)^T \\right) \\otimes |i\\rangle_E = 0 $$\nSince the vectors $\\{|i\\rangle_E\\}$ are orthonormal, they are linearly independent. Thus, the coefficient of each $|i\\rangle_E$ must be zero:\n$$ \\sum_{j \\in S} c_j (U_j^\\dagger U_i)^T = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i \\in S $$\nUsing the property $(AB)^T = B^T A^T$, we get $(U_j^\\dagger U_i)^T = (U_i)^T (U_j^\\dagger)^T = (U_i)^T (U_j^*)$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\sum_{j \\in S} c_j (U_i)^T (U_j^*) = (U_i)^T \\left( \\sum_{j \\in S} c_j U_j^* \\right) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i \\in S $$\n\n### Step 4: Leveraging Properties of Pauli Operators\n\nA key property of the Pauli operators $\\{U_i\\}$ is that they are unitary, and therefore invertible. This implies their transposes $\\{U_i^T\\}$ are also invertible.\nFrom the equation $(U_i)^T \\left( \\sum_{j \\in S} c_j U_j^* \\right) = 0$, since $(U_i)^T$ is an invertible matrix, its kernel is trivial. This implies that for any choice of $i \\in S$, we must have:\n$$ \\sum_{j \\in S} c_j U_j^* = 0 $$\nNow, we use another key property: the set of all $d^2$ Pauli operators $\\{U_j\\}$ forms a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. This implies that the set of their complex conjugates, $\\{U_j^*\\}$, also forms a basis. Any subset of a basis is a linearly independent set. Since $\\{U_j^*\\}_{j \\in S}$ is a subset of a basis, these operators are linearly independent.\nTherefore, the equation $\\sum_{j \\in S} c_j U_j^* = 0$ implies that all coefficients $c_j$ must be zero.\n\nThis proves that the block columns of $J(\\Lambda^c)$ are linearly independent. The number of such columns is the number of Kraus operators in the sum, which is the size of the set $S$, denoted by $|S|$.\nSo, the rank of the complementary channel is $\\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c) = |S|$, which is the number of non-zero probabilities $p_{jk}$ defining the Pauli channel.\n\n### Step 5: Maximizing the Rank\n\nTo find the maximal rank of the complementary channel, we need to find the maximum possible value for $|S|$. The number of generalized Pauli operators is $d^2$. We can define a Pauli channel where all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero. For example, the completely depolarizing channel can be written as a Pauli channel with $p_{jk} = 1/d^2$ for all $j,k \\in \\{0, \\dots, d-1\\}$. In this case, $|S| = d^2$.\n\nSince the rank is $|S|$, the maximal rank is the maximum possible size of $S$, which is $d^2$.\n\nFinal conclusion: The rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel is equal to the number of Pauli operators that are applied with non-zero probability. The maximal rank is achieved when all $d^2$ Pauli operators are used, and this rank is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
