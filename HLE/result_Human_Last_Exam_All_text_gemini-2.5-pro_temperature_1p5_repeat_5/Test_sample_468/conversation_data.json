    "This question requires a two-part answer: the current common name for the bee genus *Perdita* and the year that name was coined.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Genus and its Characteristics:** The genus in question is *Perdita* (Smith, 1853). Bees in this genus are native to North and Central America. They are known for being exceptionally small, with many species measuring less than 5 millimeters in length. They also often exhibit bright, metallic coloration (e.g., green, blue) or pale, ghost-like markings, which contribute to their ethereal appearance.\n\n2.  **Determine the Current Common Name:** Based on their tiny size and jewel-like appearance, the most widely used and accepted common name for the genus *Perdita* in 2024 is **\"Fairy bees\"**. This name is consistently used in modern field guides (e.g., \"The Bees in Your Backyard\" by Wilson & Carril), conservation literature (e.g., by The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation), and online entomological resources (e.g., BugGuide.net). While they are sometimes referred to more generally as \"sand bees\" or \"mining bees\" due to their nesting habits, \"Fairy bees\" is the most specific and evocative common name for the genus as a whole.\n\n3.  **Trace the Origin of the Common Name:** Pinpointing the exact moment a common name was \"coined\" can be challenging, as such names often arise informally. They are not governed by the same strict rules as scientific names. We must therefore look for the earliest significant publication that introduced or popularized the name to a wide audience.\n    *   The name \"Fairy bees\" does not appear to be an officially approved common name by the Entomological Society of America (ESA), which means its origin lies in popular or semi-scientific literature.\n    *   Research points to the work of noted entomologist and photographer **Edward S. Ross**. In a photo-essay for **National Geographic** magazine, he documented the lives of various insects.\n    *   In the **May 1959** issue, in an article titled \"The Little-Known World of the Insect,\" Ross featured a photograph of these tiny bees and described them as \"tiny ‘fairy bees’,\" bringing the term to millions of readers. This publication is the most solid and widely-cited origin point for the popularization of the name. While the term might have been used colloquially by entomologists prior to this, the 1959 article represents its effective introduction into the public lexicon.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:** The common name is \"Fairy bees\" and the most verifiable year for its coining or popularization is 1959.\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   **Specificity:** Avoid general terms like \"mining bee,\" as this applies to many unrelated genera. \"Fairy bees\" is specific to *Perdita*.\n*   **\"Coined\" vs. \"Popularized\":** For an informal common name, the date of its introduction to a wide audience via a major publication is the most reasonable interpretation of when it was \"coined\" for public use.\n*   **Authority:** Checking reliable sources like academic publications, major conservation groups, and established field guides is crucial to confirm the current usage.\n*   **Formatting:** The final answer must strictly follow the requested \"<name>, <year>\" format. Common names are generally written in lowercase.\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 1959>>>"
