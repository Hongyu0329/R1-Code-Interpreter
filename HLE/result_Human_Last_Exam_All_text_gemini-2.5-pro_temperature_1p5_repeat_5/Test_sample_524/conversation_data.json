    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's break down the terms in the question \"How many homeomorphism classes are there of homogeneous planar continua?\":\n\n*   **Continuum:** In topology, a continuum is a non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. Examples include a line segment, a disk, or a circle.\n*   **Planar:** A topological space is planar if it can be embedded in the Euclidean plane, $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This means there is a homeomorphism from the space onto a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space $X$ is homogeneous if for any two points $x, y \\in X$, there exists a homeomorphism $f: X \\to X$ such that $f(x) = y$. Intuitively, this means the space \"looks the same\" from every point.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** A set of all topological spaces that are homeomorphic to each other. We are looking for the number of distinct \"types\" or \"shapes\" of spaces that satisfy all the above conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates and Apply the Conditions\n\nWe are looking for spaces that are simultaneously a continuum, planar, and homogeneous. Let's start with simple examples and see if they fit.\n\n*   **A single point:**\n    *   Is it a continuum? Yes, it is non-empty, compact, and connected.\n    *   Is it planar? Yes, it's a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n    *   Is it homogeneous? Yes, trivially. For any two points (which must be the same point), the identity map works.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The single point constitutes one homeomorphism class. This is often called the *degenerate* case.\n\n*   **A closed interval [0, 1]:**\n    *   Is it a continuum? Yes.\n    *   Is it planar? Yes.\n    *   Is it homogeneous? No. An endpoint (like 0) is topologically different from an interior point (like 0.5). For instance, removing an endpoint leaves the space connected, while removing an interior point disconnects it. No homeomorphism can map an endpoint to an interior point.\n\n*   **The circle ($S^1$):**\n    *   Is it a continuum? Yes.\n    *   Is it planar? Yes.\n    *   Is it homogeneous? Yes. For any two points on the circle, a rotation can map one to the other.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The circle constitutes a second homeomorphism class.\n\n*   **A disk ($D^2$):**\n    *   Is it a continuum? Yes.\n    *   Is it planar? Yes.\n    *   Is it homogeneous? No, for the same reason as the interval. A boundary point is different from an interior point.\n\n### Step 3: Consult the Major Classification Theorems\n\nThe problem now is to determine if there are any other examples besides the point and the circle. This question was a major research topic in point-set topology during the 20th century, and its resolution relies on several deep theorems. The classification breaks down based on whether the continuum separates the plane.\n\n**Case A: The continuum does not separate the plane.**\n\nA famous theorem by R.H. Bing (1960) states that a *locally connected* non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to the circle. The circle is locally connected. This covers one possibility.\n\nHowever, what if the continuum is *not* locally connected? F. Burton Jones (1951) showed that a non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum that does not separate the plane must be either the circle or another object called the **pseudo-arc**.\n\n*   **The Pseudo-arc:**\n    *   Is it a continuum? Yes, it's a specific type of snake-like, indecomposable continuum.\n    *   Is it planar? Yes.\n    *   Is it homogeneous? Yes, this is a highly non-trivial result proven by Bing.\n    *   Is it homeomorphic to the circle? No. The pseudo-arc is famously *not* locally connected at any point, whereas the circle is. It also has different algebraic topological properties (e.g., its first ÄŒech cohomology group is trivial).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The pseudo-arc constitutes a third homeomorphism class.\n\nSo, for continua that do not separate the plane, we have two non-degenerate classes (circle, pseudo-arc) and one degenerate class (point).\n\n**Case B: The continuum separates the plane.**\n\nThis case is even more complex. A continuum that separates the plane must \"enclose\" something. An example of a homogeneous continuum that separates the plane is a **solenoid**. However, most solenoids are not planar. A major result by James T. Rogers, Jr. (1980s) completed the classification. He proved that any homogeneous planar continuum that separates the plane must be homeomorphic to a specific object.\n\n*   **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:**\n    *   This space can be constructed by taking a circle and replacing each point with a copy of a pseudo-arc in a continuous fashion.\n    *   Is it a continuum? Yes.\n    *   Is it planar? Yes.\n    *   Is it homogeneous? Yes.\n    *   Does it separate the plane? Yes.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The circle of pseudo-arcs is the only remaining possibility and constitutes a fourth, distinct homeomorphism class.\n\n### Step 4: Final Summary and Count\n\nThe complete classification of homogeneous planar continua shows that every such space must be homeomorphic to one of exactly four distinct types:\n\n1.  **The Point:** A degenerate continuum.\n2.  **The Circle:** A non-degenerate, non-separating, locally connected continuum.\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc:** A non-degenerate, non-separating, non-locally connected continuum.\n4.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** A non-degenerate continuum that separates the plane.\n\nThese four spaces are topologically distinct from one another. Therefore, there are exactly four such homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
