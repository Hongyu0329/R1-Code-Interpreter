    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Historical Context:** The question refers to the period of the Ming Dynasty's rule in Vietnam, specifically during the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427) led by Lê Lợi against Ming occupation. General Mu Sheng (沐晟) was a key Ming commander involved in campaigns in this region.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mu Sheng's Role and Campaigns:** Mu Sheng had been involved in Vietnam since the initial successful invasion in 1406-1407 that overthrew the Hồ dynasty. However, the question asks for his first *major defeat*. During the early and middle stages of the Lam Sơn Uprising, other Ming generals, like Wang Tong (王通), were the primary commanders in the field and suffered significant defeats (e.g., at Tốt Động–Chúc Động in 1426).\n\n3.  **Pinpoint the Specific Campaign of Defeat:** Mu Sheng's most significant and ultimately disastrous campaign came at the end of the war in 1427. The Ming emperor dispatched two large reinforcement armies to save the besieged Ming forces in Vietnam.\n    *   One army, led by Liu Sheng (柳升), advanced from Guangxi.\n    *   The other army, numbering 50,000 troops, was commanded by Mu Sheng himself and advanced from Yunnan.\n\n4.  **Identify the \"Major Defeat\":** The army under Liu Sheng was completely destroyed at the Battle of Chi Lăng - Xương Giang. When news of this catastrophe reached Mu Sheng's army, which was still advancing, the troops' morale collapsed. Mu Sheng immediately ordered a retreat back to Yunnan.\n\n5.  **Locate the Site of the Defeat:** While Mu Sheng avoided a single pitched battle on the scale of Chi Lăng, his campaign was an unmitigated disaster. Vietnamese forces, led by generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, had anticipated his advance and had set up ambushes along his route. As Mu Sheng's army fled in panic, the Vietnamese forces relentlessly attacked and harassed them. The retreat turned into a rout, with the Ming army abandoning vast quantities of supplies, weapons, and food. This complete strategic failure and the routing of his army is considered Mu Sheng's first and greatest defeat in the war.\n\n6.  **Determine the Modern-Day Province:** Mu Sheng's army advanced from Yunnan (China) into Vietnam, following the traditional route along the Red River valley. The ambushes and the final rout occurred in the mountainous border passes between the two countries. Historical accounts pinpoint the locations of these clashes at places like **ải Lê Hoa** (Lê Hoa Pass) and **Cần Trạm**. These historical sites are located within the territory of the modern-day **Lào Cai Province** of Vietnam, which shares a border with China's Yunnan Province.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Defining \"Defeat\":** The defeat was not a single, formal battle but a campaign-ending rout and strategic failure. However, for a commander of a 50,000-strong army, this panicked flight and loss of control is undeniably a major military defeat.\n*   **Distinguishing Commanders:** It is crucial to distinguish Mu Sheng's actions from those of other Ming generals like Liu Sheng and Wang Tong, who suffered different defeats at different locations. Mu Sheng's defeat was unique to his Yunnan-based army.\n*   **Geographical Correlation:** The analysis relies on correlating historical battle/ambush sites (Lê Hoa Pass) with modern administrative boundaries. The route from Yunnan into the Red River Delta logically passes through what is now Lào Cai Province.\n\nBased on this analysis, the province where Mu Sheng's army was routed and he experienced his first major defeat during the Lam Sơn war is Lào Cai.\n\n<<<Lào Cai Province>>>"
