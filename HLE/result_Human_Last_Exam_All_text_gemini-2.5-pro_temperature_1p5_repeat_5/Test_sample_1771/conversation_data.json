    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical linguistic development from the given Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root to its reflexes in Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form\n\n*   **PIE Form:** The question gives `*seh₂gieti`. This breaks down into:\n    *   Root: `*seh₂g-`. The presence of the laryngeal `*h₂` (the \"a-coloring\" laryngeal) before `*g` is confirmed by cognates like Latin `sāgīre`, where `*eh₂` has resulted in a long `ā`.\n    *   Suffix: `*-ie-ti`. This is a present tense suffix combination (a \"yo-present\").\n*   **Meaning:** '(s)he’s giving a sign', related to perception and tracking.\n*   **Careful Point (Ablaut):** While the provided PIE form is in the **e-grade** (`*seh₂g-`), many verbs of this type in Proto-Germanic were formed from the **o-grade** of the root, especially when they had a causative or iterative meaning ('to cause to perceive' -> 'to seek'). Therefore, to find the Germanic reflex, we must start with the o-grade form of the root: `*soh₂g-`.\n\n### Step 2: From PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)\n\nWe start with the reconstructed o-grade causative verb, which would look something like PIE `*soh₂g-éyeti` (\"to cause to track/perceive\").\n\n1.  **Vowel Change:** The PIE combination `*oh₂` regularly develops into a long `*ō` in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   `*soh₂g-` → Pre-Germanic `*sōg-`\n2.  **Grimm's Law:** This is a systematic consonant shift affecting stops. The relevant part here is that voiced stops become voiceless stops.\n    *   PIE `*g` → PGmc `*k`\n    *   Therefore, the Pre-Germanic root `*sōg-` becomes the Proto-Germanic root `*sōk-`.\n3.  **Verb Class:** The PIE causative suffix `*-eye-` corresponds to the Proto-Germanic Class 1 weak verb suffix, which is `*-janą` for the infinitive. Verbs in this class have an `-i-` or `-j-` in their stem.\n4.  **Combining the Parts:** We combine the root `*sōk-` with the suffix `*-janą`.\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic Result:** **`*sōkijaną`** (meaning 'to seek').\n\n### Step 3: From Proto-Germanic to Daughter Languages\n\nWe now trace the development of PGmc `*sōkijaną` into the individual languages.\n\n#### 1. Old Norse (ON)\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut:** The `*-i-` or `*-j-` in the suffix `*-janą` causes the preceding back vowel `*ō` to be fronted. In Norse, `*ō` subjected to i-umlaut becomes `œ` (later written as `æ`).\n    *   `*sōk-` → `*sœk-` → `sæk-`\n2.  **Consonants:** The cluster `*kj` is preserved, written `kj`.\n3.  **Ending:** The infinitive ending `*-aną` is reduced to `-a`.\n\n*   **Old Norse Result:** **`sækja`**\n\n#### 2. Old English (OE)\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut:** As in Old Norse, the `*-i-` or `*-j-` triggers umlaut. PGmc `*ō` becomes a front rounded vowel `*ø̄`, which subsequently unrounds to become a long `ē` in West Saxon Old English.\n    *   `*sōk-` → `*sø̄k-` → `sēc-`\n2.  **Palatalization:** The velar consonant `*k` is palatalized to an affricate `[tʃ]` when it comes before a front vowel (like the new `ē`) or the semi-vowel `*j`. This sound is written as `ċ` in modern grammars or simply `c` in original manuscripts.\n    *   `*-kjan` → `-ċan` (`[tʃan]`)\n3.  **Ending:** The infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an`. The `*j` is absorbed, its only trace being the palatalization of the preceding consonant.\n\n*   **Old English Result:** **`sēċan`** (also spelled `sēcan`)\n\n#### 3. Old High German (OHG)\n\n1.  **Vowel Change:** PGmc `*ō` was not subject to i-umlaut in the infinitive in Old High German. Instead, it regularly underwent a change where it became a diphthong, `uo`.\n    *   `*sōk-` → `suoh-`\n2.  **High German Consonant Shift:** This major sound change affected the consonants. The relevant rule is that a voiceless stop (`*k`) after a vowel becomes a geminated (doubled) voiceless fricative `hh` (`[xx]`). The original `*-j-` in the suffix triggers this gemination before being lost.\n    *   `*-kjan-` → `-hhen-` (`[xxen]`)\n3.  **Ending:** The infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an`.\n\n*   **Old High German Result:** **`suohhen`**\n\n### Final Summary of Results\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkijaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sækja`\n*   **Old English:** `sēċan`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhen`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną; Old Norse: sækja; Old English: sēċan; Old High German: suohhen>>>"
