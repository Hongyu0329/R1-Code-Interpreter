    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat**\n\nCoiled-coils are formed by alpha-helices that wrap around each other. Their sequences are characterized by a seven-amino-acid pattern called a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at the `a` and `d` positions are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the structure, packing together in a \"knobs-into-holes\" arrangement. The `e` and `g` positions are often charged or polar and mediate electrostatic interactions between helices. The `b`, `c`, and `f` positions are typically exposed to the solvent.\n\n**Step 2: Assign Heptad Positions to the Sequence**\n\nThe given sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` (30 amino acids long).\n\nTo find the correct heptad phasing, we must identify the repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues that can form the core. The key hydrophobic residues are Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), and Tryptophan (W).\n\nLet's examine the positions of the most frequent hydrophobic residues, `I` and `L`:\n*   `I` appears at positions 3, 10, 17, 24. The spacing is exactly 7 residues (10-3=7, 17-10=7, 24-17=7).\n*   `L` appears at positions 7, 14, 21, 28. The spacing is also exactly 7 residues (14-7=7, 21-14=7, 28-21=7).\n\nThis regular seven-residue spacing confirms that `I` occupies one specific position in the heptad repeat, and `L` occupies another. In a heptad repeat, the `a` and `d` core positions are separated by two amino acids (e.g., `a`-b-c-`d`). The `d` position of one heptad is separated from the `a` position of the next heptad by three amino acids (`d`-e-f-g-`a`). This means the `d` and `a` positions are 4 residues apart in the linear sequence (`i` and `i+4`).\n\nLet's check the spacing in our sequence. Isoleucine is at position 3, and the next core residue, Leucine, is at position 7. The distance is 7 - 3 = 4. This confirms that one of them is at position `d` and the other is at position `a`. Specifically, if residue `i` is at `d`, residue `i+4` will be at `a`.\n\nTherefore, we can make the following assignment:\n*   **d positions:** All are **Isoleucine (I)**.\n*   **a positions:** All are **Leucine (L)**.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Principles of \"Knobs-into-Holes\" Packing and Packing Efficiency**\n\nThe identity of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions is the primary determinant of the oligomeric state of a parallel coiled-coil. Landmark studies by Harbury, Kim, and Alber established these rules based on the packing efficiency of different amino acid side chains.\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Favored by `a=Isoleucine`, `d=Leucine`. This is the classic leucine zipper structure. The beta-branched Ile fits well into the `a` position.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Favored by `a=Isoleucine`, `d=Isoleucine`. The packing of Ile at both core positions is optimal in a 3-helix bundle.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Favored by `a=Leucine`, `d=Isoleucine`. The bulky, beta-branched Isoleucine side chain creates unfavorable steric hindrance at the `d` position in a dimer. This strain is relieved in a tetrameric arrangement where the packing geometry is different, allowing the `I` at the `d` position to fit efficiently.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Oligomeric State**\n\nOur analysis of the sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` has unambiguously identified:\n*   All `a` positions are occupied by **Leucine (L)**.\n*   All `d` positions are occupied by **Isoleucine (I)**.\n\nBased on the established rules of coiled-coil packing, the `a=L, d=I` combination strongly directs the formation of a **tetramer**.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric state of this protein coiled-coil would be 4.\n\nFinal check of other positions:\nThe `e` and `g` positions, which flank the hydrophobic core, are often involved in electrostatic interactions. In our sequence, the `g` positions are consistently Serine (S), and the `e` positions are mostly Alanine (A), Lysine (K), and Glutamine (Q). While these can contribute to stability, the primary determinant of the oligomerization state is the steric packing of the `a` and `d` core residues. The `a=L`, `d=I` core is the dominant signal for tetramerization.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe sequence has Leucine (L) at all 'a' positions and Isoleucine (I) at all 'd' positions. This specific arrangement of core residues is known to strongly favor the formation of a tetramer due to optimal packing efficiency in a four-helix bundle.\n\n<<<C>>>"
