    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Definition of GCRD:**\n    The greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` is a common right divisor `G(s)` that is right-divisible by any other common right divisor `D(s)`. That is:\n    *   `P1(s) = Q1(s)G(s)` for some polynomial matrix `Q1(s)`.\n    *   `P2(s) = Q2(s)G(s)` for some polynomial matrix `Q2(s)`.\n    *   For any other common right divisor `D(s)`, `G(s) = H(s)D(s)` for some polynomial matrix `H(s)`.\n    The GCRD is not unique; if `G(s)` is a GCRD, then `U(s)G(s)` is also a GCRD, where `U(s)` is any unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant).\n\n2.  **Method for finding the GCRD:**\n    A standard algorithm to find the GCRD is a matrix version of the Euclidean algorithm. We form a composite matrix by stacking `P1` and `P2`, and then reduce this matrix to a simplified form using elementary row operations. The non-zero rows of the final matrix form the GCRD.\n    The allowed elementary row operations are:\n    *   Swapping any two rows.\n    *   Multiplying any row by a non-zero constant.\n    *   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n\n3.  **Applying the Algorithm:**\n    The given matrices are:\n    `P1 = [s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2]`\n    `P2 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1]`\n\n    First, form the stacked matrix `M(s)`:\n    `M(s) = [P1; P2]`\n    `M(s) =`\n    `[R1: s^2 + s,  -s     ]`\n    `[R2: -s^2 - 1, s^2    ]`\n    `[R3: s,        0      ]`\n    `[R4: -s - 1,   1      ]`\n\n4.  **Perform Elementary Row Operations:**\n    The goal is to simplify this 4x2 matrix into a 2x2 matrix (plus zero rows) that represents the GCRD. We can use `R4` as a pivot row because its second element is a constant `1`, which simplifies eliminating other elements in the second column.\n\n    *   **Operation 1:** `R1 -> R1 + s * R4`\n        The new `R1` will be:\n        `[ (s^2 + s) + s(-s - 1),  -s + s(1) ] = [ s^2 + s - s^2 - s, 0 ] = [0, 0]`\n\n    *   **Operation 2:** `R2 -> R2 - s^2 * R4`\n        The new `R2` will be:\n        `[ (-s^2 - 1) - s^2(-s - 1), s^2 - s^2(1) ] = [ -s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, 0 ] = [s^3 - 1, 0]`\n\n    After these operations, the matrix `M(s)` becomes:\n    `[ 0,         0 ]`\n    `[ s^3 - 1,   0 ]`\n    `[ s,         0 ]`\n    `[ -s - 1,    1 ]`\n\n5.  **Continue Row Reduction:**\n    Now we have three rows with a zero in the second column. We can simplify these rows amongst themselves. Let's focus on `[s^3 - 1, 0]` and `[s, 0]`. We can apply the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials to `s^3 - 1` and `s`.\n    `s^3 - 1 = (s^2) * s - 1`\n    This implies that a linear combination of these polynomials can give `-1`.\n\n    *   **Operation 3:** `R2 -> R2 - s^2 * R3` (using the original `R2` and `R3` after the first steps, which are now `[s^3-1, 0]` and `[s, 0]`)\n        The new `R2` will be:\n        `[ (s^3 - 1) - s^2(s), 0 - s^2(0) ] = [ -1, 0 ]`\n\n    Now the matrix is equivalent to:\n    `[ 0,       0 ]`\n    `[ -1,      0 ]`\n    `[ s,       0 ]`\n    `[ -s - 1,  1 ]`\n\n6.  **Further Simplification:**\n    We can use the new row `[-1, 0]` to simplify other rows.\n\n    *   **Operation 4:** `R3 -> R3 + s * R2` (where `R2` is now `[-1, 0]`)\n        The new `R3` will be:\n        `[ s + s(-1), 0 + s(0) ] = [0, 0]`\n\n    *   **Operation 5:** `R4 -> R4 - (s+1) * R2` (where `R2` is `[-1, 0]`)\n        The new `R4` will be:\n        `[ (-s - 1) - (s+1)(-1), 1 - (s+1)(0) ] = [ -s - 1 + s + 1, 1 ] = [0, 1]`\n\n7.  **Final Result:**\n    After all these operations, the set of non-zero rows we have generated is `[-1, 0]` and `[0, 1]`. The other rows have become `[0, 0]`.\n    We collect these non-zero rows to form the GCRD matrix `G(s)`.\n\n    `G(s) =`\n    `[-1, 0]`\n    `[ 0, 1]`\n\n    The determinant of this matrix is `(-1)(1) - (0)(0) = -1`, which is a non-zero constant. This means `G(s)` is a unimodular matrix. When the GCRD is unimodular, the original matrices `P1` and `P2` are said to be **right coprime**. Other unimodular matrices like the identity matrix `I` are also valid GCRDs. However, the matrix obtained directly from the algorithm is a correct and standard answer.\n\nFinal Answer: The greatest common right divisor of the given polynomial matrices `P1` and `P2` is:\n`[-1, 0]`\n`[ 0, 1]`\n\n<<<[[-1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
