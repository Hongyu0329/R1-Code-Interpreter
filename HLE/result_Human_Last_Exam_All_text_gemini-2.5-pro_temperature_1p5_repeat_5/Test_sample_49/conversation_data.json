    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the f-vector of the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Problem and Key Terms\n\n*   **Polytope:** A convex polytope in 4-dimensional Euclidean space (a 4-polytope).\n*   **f-vector:** A vector `(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3)` where `f_i` is the number of i-dimensional faces (vertices, edges, 2-faces, and facets or 3-faces).\n*   **Constraints:**\n    1.  Dimension `d = 4`.\n    2.  Number of vertices `f_0 = 6`.\n    3.  The polytope is **non-simplicial**. A polytope is simplicial if all its facets are simplices (i.e., tetrahedra for a 4-polytope). A non-simplicial polytope has at least one facet that is not a tetrahedron.\n*   **Objective:** Maximize the number of 2-faces, `f_2`.\n\n### Step 2: Use Fundamental Polytope Properties\n\n1.  **Euler-Poincaré Formula for 4-Polytopes:** For any 4-polytope, the numbers of faces are related by the formula:\n    `f_0 - f_1 + f_2 - f_3 = 0`\n    Substituting `f_0 = 6`, we get:\n    `6 - f_1 + f_2 - f_3 = 0`\n    This can be rearranged to express `f_2`:\n    `f_2 = f_1 - 6 + f_3`\n    To maximize `f_2`, we need to maximize `f_1` (the number of edges) and `f_3` (the number of facets).\n\n2.  **Duality:** Every convex polytope `P` has a dual polytope `P*`. The f-vector of the dual `P*` is the reverse of the f-vector of `P`:\n    `f_i(P*) = f_{d-1-i}(P)`\n    For our 4-polytope `P`:\n    *   `f_0(P*) = f_3(P)`\n    *   `f_1(P*) = f_2(P)`\n    *   `f_2(P*) = f_1(P)`\n    *   `f_3(P*) = f_0(P) = 6`\n\n    Furthermore, the dual of a non-simplicial polytope is non-simplicial.\n\n### Step 3: Reframe the Problem using Duality\n\nThe original problem is to find a non-simplicial 4-polytope `P` with `f_0(P)=6` that maximizes `f_2(P)`.\nUsing the dual perspective, this is equivalent to finding a non-simplicial 4-polytope `P*` with `f_3(P*)=6` that maximizes `f_1(P*)`.\n\nThe problem is now: **Among all non-simplicial 4-polytopes with exactly 6 facets, which one has the most edges?**\n\n### Step 4: Use Known Classification Results\n\nThe f-vectors of 4-polytopes with a small number of facets have been completely classified. For 4-polytopes with `f_3 = 6` facets, the possible pairs of `(f_0, f_1, f_2)` for their f-vectors `(f_0, f_1, f_2, 6)` are known:\n*   (6, 13, 13)\n*   (7, 14, 13)\n*   (7, 15, 14)\n*   (8, 16, 14)\n*   (8, 17, 15)\n*   (9, 18, 15)\n\nOur goal is to find the polytope `P*` from this list that maximizes `f_1(P*)`. Looking at the list, the maximum value for `f_1` is 18.\n\nThis maximum is achieved by a polytope `P*` with the f-vector `(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3) = (9, 18, 15, 6)`.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Maximizing Polytope and Verify Constraints\n\n1.  **Identify `P*`:** The polytope with the f-vector `(9, 18, 15, 6)` is the **product of two triangles** (`C_3 × C_3`).\n2.  **Verify `P*` is non-simplicial:** The facets of `C_3 × C_3` are 6 triangular prisms. A triangular prism is not a simplex (it has square faces). Since its facets are not all simplices, `C_3 × C_3` is a non-simplicial polytope. This matches the requirement for `P*`.\n\n### Step 6: Determine the Final f-vector\n\nWe have found the dual polytope `P* = C_3 × C_3` with `f(P*) = (9, 18, 15, 6)`. Now we can find the f-vector of the original polytope `P` by reversing the f-vector of `P*`.\n\n*   `f_0(P) = f_3(P*) = 6`\n*   `f_1(P) = f_2(P*) = 15`\n*   `f_2(P) = f_1(P*) = 18`\n*   `f_3(P) = f_0(P*) = 9`\n\nThe resulting f-vector is `(6, 15, 18, 9)`.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n*   The polytope is non-simplicial. Our final choice, `P = (C_3 × C_3)^*`, is the dual of a non-simplicial polytope and is therefore itself non-simplicial. This is satisfied.\n*   The polytope has 6 vertices. `f_0 = 6`. This is satisfied.\n*   The number of 2-faces `f_2` is maximal. Our analysis of all possible f-vectors for polytopes with 6 facets showed that `f_2(P) = f_1(P*) = 18` is the maximum possible value.\n*   The f-vector satisfies the Euler-Poincaré formula: `6 - 15 + 18 - 9 = -9 + 9 = 0`. This is satisfied.\n\nInterestingly, this f-vector is the same as the f-vector for the simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices that maximizes the number of faces. However, the underlying combinatorial structure of the polytopes is different. The question specifically asks for the non-simplicial case, and our derived polytope `(C_3 × C_3)^*` fulfills this condition.\n\n<<< (6, 15, 18, 9) >>>"
