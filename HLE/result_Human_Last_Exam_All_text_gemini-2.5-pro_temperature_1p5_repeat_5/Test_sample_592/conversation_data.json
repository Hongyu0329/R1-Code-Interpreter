Tommaso is his best friend from a wealthy family. A significant event in their friendship and in the plot is when Tommaso decides to leave Livorno to pursue a different life abroad.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the specific scene or dialogue where the destination is mentioned.**\nIn the movie, there is a key scene where Tommaso informs his friend Piero of his plans to leave. He explicitly states that he is moving to the United States.\n\n**Step 5: Pinpoint the exact city named by the character.**\nDuring his farewell conversation with Piero, Tommaso specifies his destination. He says he is moving to New York to start a new life and pursue new opportunities, which contrasts sharply with Piero's decision to stay in their hometown of Livorno.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Character Distinction:** It's important not to confuse the character in question, Tommaso (played by Marco Cocci), with the main protagonist, Piero Mansani (played by Edoardo Gabbriellini). The question is specifically about Tommaso.\n*   **Source Verification:** This plot point is a well-established detail of the film, confirmed in various plot summaries and analyses of *Ovosodo*.\n*   **Specificity:** The question asks for the city, not just the country. The country is the United States, and the specific city mentioned in the film is New York.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the correct city.\n\n<<<New York>>>"
