    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the color of the Crayola crayon containing the specified chemical.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Compound**\nThe chemical name provided is 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride. This is the systematic IUPAC name for a common synthetic dye. By searching for this name or by analyzing its chemical structure (a xanthene derivative), we can identify it by its common name, **Rhodamine B**. In the Colour Index system, it is known as C.I. 45170 or Basic Violet 10.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Color and Properties of Rhodamine B**\nRhodamine B is a well-known fluorescent dye. When dissolved or used as a pigment, it produces a very bright, intense reddish-pink or magenta color. This specific vibrant hue is often described as **cerise**.\n\n**Step 3: Link Rhodamine B to Crayola Crayon Pigments**\nWhile the exact formulations of Crayola crayons are proprietary, chemical analyses have been performed by third parties to identify the pigments used. These analyses show that Crayola uses Rhodamine B in several of its crayon colors, particularly for bright and fluorescent shades.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Specific Crayola Crayon Color**\nThe key is to find a crayon color that uses Rhodamine B as a pigment.\n*   **Direct Color Match:** Since Rhodamine B produces a cerise color, it is logical to look for a crayon of that color. Chemical analysis has confirmed that the Crayola crayon named **Cerise** uses Rhodamine B as its primary pigment. The name of the crayon itself is a direct reference to the color produced by the dye.\n*   **Other Uses:** It's important to note that Rhodamine B is also used for its fluorescent properties in other crayon colors. For instance, it is mixed with a yellow pigment (like PY74) to create the color **Screamin' Green**. In this case, the Rhodamine B absorbs green light and fluoresces red-orange, making the overall crayon appear exceptionally bright. However, the most direct answer relates the pigment's own color to the crayon's color.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe chemical 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is Rhodamine B. This dye has a characteristic cerise (vivid reddish-pink) color and is used as the primary pigment in the Crayola crayon of the same name.\n\n<<<Cerise>>>"
