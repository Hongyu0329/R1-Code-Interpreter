    "This problem requires us to find all second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in $\\phi^4$ scalar field theory, calculate their respective symmetry factors, and then sum these factors.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Diagrams\n\nIn $\\phi^4$ theory, the interaction vertex involves four $\\phi$ fields. A second-order diagram corresponds to a factor of $\\lambda^2$ in the perturbation series, which means the diagram must contain exactly two vertices.\n\nA vacuum bubble diagram is a connected Feynman diagram with no external lines. This means all the field lines originating from the vertices must be connected to other lines within the diagram, forming propagators.\n\nEach of the two vertices has 4 \"legs\" or half-lines. In total, we have 8 half-lines that must be paired up to form propagators. Let the two vertices be $V_1$ and $V_2$. A propagator can either connect $V_1$ to $V_2$ or connect $V_1$ to itself (a loop), or $V_2$ to itself.\n\nTo classify the diagrams, we can count the number of propagators connecting $V_1$ and $V_2$ ($n_{12}$), the number of loops on $V_1$ ($n_{11}$), and the number of loops on $V_2$ ($n_{22}$).\nThe total number of propagators is 4, so $n_{12} + n_{11} + n_{22} = 4$.\nThe degree of each vertex (number of lines connected to it) must be 4. A loop contributes 2 to the degree.\nSo, for $V_1$: $n_{12} + 2n_{11} = 4$.\nFor $V_2$: $n_{12} + 2n_{22} = 4$.\nFor the diagram to be connected, we must have at least one line connecting the vertices, so $n_{12} \\ge 1$.\n\nWe find the integer solutions to this system of equations:\n1.  From $n_{12} + 2n_{11} = 4$ and $n_{12} \\ge 1$, the possibilities for $(n_{12}, n_{11})$ are:\n    *   If $n_{11}=0$, then $n_{12}=4$.\n    *   If $n_{11}=1$, then $n_{12}=2$.\n    *   If $n_{11}=2$, then $n_{12}=0$, which is disallowed.\n\n2.  Case 1: $(n_{12}, n_{11}) = (4, 0)$.\n    *   Using $n_{12} + 2n_{22} = 4$, we get $4 + 2n_{22} = 4 \\implies n_{22}=0$.\n    *   This gives the solution $(n_{12}, n_{11}, n_{22}) = (4, 0, 0)$. This diagram consists of two vertices connected by four propagators. Let's call this **Diagram A**. It is sometimes called a \"melon\" diagram.\n\n3.  Case 2: $(n_{12}, n_{11}) = (2, 1)$.\n    *   Using $n_{12} + 2n_{22} = 4$, we get $2 + 2n_{22} = 4 \\implies n_{22}=1$.\n    *   This gives the solution $(n_{12}, n_{11}, n_{22}) = (2, 1, 1)$. This diagram consists of two vertices connected by two propagators, with one loop on each vertex. Let's call this **Diagram B**. It is often called a \"figure-8\" or \"dumbbell\" diagram.\n\nThese are the only two possible connected second-order vacuum bubble diagrams.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculation of the Symmetry Factors\n\nThe symmetry factor, $S$, of a diagram is the order of its automorphism group, which counts the number of ways the lines and vertices can be permuted without changing the diagram's overall structure.\n\n**Diagram A: The \"Melon\" Diagram**\nThis diagram has two vertices connected by four propagators.\n\n*   **Vertex Permutations:** The two vertices are identical. Swapping them leaves the diagram unchanged. This gives a factor of 2.\n*   **Propagator Permutations:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are identical. They can be permuted in any way. This gives a factor of $4! = 24$.\n\nThe total symmetry factor for Diagram A is the product of these factors:\n$S_A = 2 \\times 4! = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n**Diagram B: The \"Figure-8\" Diagram**\nThis diagram has two vertices connected by two propagators, with a self-loop on each vertex.\n\n*   **Vertex Permutations:** The two vertices are identical (each has a loop and is connected to the other vertex by two lines). Swapping them leaves the diagram unchanged. This gives a factor of 2.\n*   **Propagator Permutations:** The two propagators connecting the vertices are identical. Swapping them leaves the diagram unchanged. This gives a factor of 2.\n*   **Loop Symmetries:** Each loop propagator connects a vertex to itself. The two \"ends\" of the propagator line that attach to the vertex can be swapped without changing the diagram. Since there is a loop on each of the two vertices, this gives a factor of 2 for each loop. Total factor = $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\nThe total symmetry factor for Diagram B is the product of these independent symmetry operations:\n$S_B = (\\text{swap vertices}) \\times (\\text{swap connecting lines}) \\times (\\text{flip loop on } V_1) \\times (\\text{flip loop on } V_2)$\n$S_B = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Sum of the Symmetry Factors\n\nThe final step is to sum the symmetry factors for all the identified diagrams.\n*   Symmetry factor of Diagram A: $S_A = 48$\n*   Symmetry factor of Diagram B: $S_B = 16$\n\nTotal Sum = $S_A + S_B = 48 + 16 = 64$.\n\n<<<64>>>"
