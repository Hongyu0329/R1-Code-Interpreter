No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry in *Bombus* is to present a shared warning signal to natural predators, such as birds. The validity of the researcher's approach hinges on the assumption that human perception of visual similarity is an accurate proxy for the perception of a non-human predator, which is a critically flawed assumption.

The primary reasons for its invalidity are:

1.  **Different Visual Systems:** The key predators of bumblebees, particularly birds, have a different visual system than humans. Birds have tetrachromatic vision and can perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, whereas humans have trichromatic vision and cannot. Color patterns on bumblebees may have significant components in the UV spectrum that are crucial for how they are perceived by a predator but are completely invisible to a human observer. Two species that appear identical to a human may look distinctly different to a bird, and therefore would not function as co-mimics in an ecological context.

2.  **Incomplete Information from Photographs:** Standard cameras used for field photography are designed to capture light in the visible spectrum (RGB) and typically filter out UV light. The images shown to the undergraduates are thus already stripped of a potentially vital layer of information that a natural predator would use. The research is based on data that is incomplete from an ecological perspective.

Because the study's methodology is based on the wrong sensory system (human instead of predator) and incomplete data (standard photos lacking UV), the resulting clusters of "similar" species are unlikely to represent the true, functional mimicry syndromes that have been shaped by predator-prey interactions. The approach fundamentally misunderstands the ecological context of mimicry.
