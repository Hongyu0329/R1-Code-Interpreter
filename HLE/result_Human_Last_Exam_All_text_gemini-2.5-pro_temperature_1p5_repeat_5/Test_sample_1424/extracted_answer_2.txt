In the frequency-momentum representation, the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \omega)$ is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\epsilon_k$ as the inverse of their difference from the frequency-energy term $\hbar\omega$. The precise mathematical form, which accounts for causality via the Feynman prescription, is:

$G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\hbar\omega - \epsilon_k + i\eta \, \text{sgn}(\epsilon_k - E_F)}$

where $\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal and $E_F$ is the Fermi energy.
