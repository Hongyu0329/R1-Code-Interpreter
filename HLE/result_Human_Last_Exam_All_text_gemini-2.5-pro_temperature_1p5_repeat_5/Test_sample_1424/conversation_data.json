    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Feynman Path Integral Formalism:** This is a method in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory where the probability amplitude for a process (the \"propagator\" or \"Green's function\") is calculated by summing over all possible histories or paths the system can take between initial and final states. Each path is weighted by a phase factor $e^{iS/\\hbar}$, where $S$ is the classical action for that path.\n*   **Bare Green's Function ($G_0$):** This is the propagator for a **non-interacting** system. The subscript '0' denotes that the Hamiltonian, $H_0$, contains only single-particle terms (e.g., kinetic energy and an external potential) and no interaction terms between particles. In the language of second quantization, $G_0(x,t; x',t') = -i\\langle 0 | T[\\psi(x,t) \\psi^\\dagger(x',t')] | 0 \\rangle$, where $|0\\rangle$ is the ground state of the non-interacting system.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$):** These are the energies of the stationary states of the non-interacting system. They are the eigenvalues of the single-particle Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H}_0$, where $k$ is a quantum number (like momentum) that labels the eigenstate.\n\nThe question asks for the mathematical relationship between $G_0$ and $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n**Step 2: Express the Green's Function as a Path Integral**\n\nThe Green's function can be formally written as a functional integral over all possible field configurations $\\psi(x,t)$:\n\n$G_0(x,t; x',t') = \\frac{\\int D[\\psi^*,\\psi] \\psi(x,t) \\psi^*(x',t') e^{iS_0[\\psi^*,\\psi]/\\hbar}}{\\int D[\\psi^*,\\psi] e^{iS_0[\\psi^*,\\psi]/\\hbar}}$\n\nThe action for the non-interacting system, $S_0$, is given by:\n\n$S_0 = \\int dt \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(x,t) (i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0) \\psi(x,t)$\n\nThis integral is very difficult to compute in this form. The key to simplifying it is to change the basis.\n\n**Step 3: Diagonalize the Action**\n\nThe crucial step is to expand the field $\\psi(x,t)$ in the basis of the eigenfunctions of $\\hat{H}_0$. Let $\\phi_k(x)$ be the eigenfunctions with corresponding energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$:\n$\\hat{H}_0 \\phi_k(x) = \\epsilon_k \\phi_k(x)$\n\nWe can expand the field as:\n$\\psi(x,t) = \\sum_k c_k(t) \\phi_k(x)$\n\nSubstituting this into the action and using the orthonormality of the eigenfunctions ($\\int \\phi_k^*(x) \\phi_{k'}(x) dx = \\delta_{kk'}$), the action becomes diagonal in the index $k$:\n\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int dt \\, c_k^*(t) (i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k) c_k(t)$\n\n**Step 4: Fourier Transform to Frequency Space**\n\nThe calculation becomes even simpler if we Fourier transform from the time domain ($t$) to the frequency domain ($\\omega$).\nLet $c_k(t) = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} e^{-i\\omega t} c_k(\\omega)$.\nThe time derivative operator becomes a simple multiplication: $i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow \\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe action now takes on a purely algebraic form:\n\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\, c_k^*(\\omega) (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k) c_k(\\omega)$\n\n**Step 5: Invert the Operator to Find the Green's Function**\n\nIn the path integral formalism, the Green's function in a diagonal basis is the inverse of the operator appearing between the fields in the action. Looking at the expression for $S_0$ in the $(\\omega, k)$ space, the operator for each mode is simply the algebraic term $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\nTherefore, the Green's function for mode $k$ in frequency space, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\nThis is the fundamental functional dependence: the bare Green's function is the inverse of the difference between the Fourier energy ($\\hbar\\omega$) and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ($\\epsilon_k$).\n\n**Step 6: Handle the Pole (A Careful Point)**\n\nThe expression derived in Step 5 has a singularity, or a \"pole,\" when $\\hbar\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. This corresponds physically to an on-shell particle. In a real physical calculation, we need a prescription to handle this. The Feynman path integral (which calculates the time-ordered Green's function) provides this prescription automatically.\n\nThe rule, known as the Feynman prescription, is to add a small imaginary part to the denominator. The sign of this imaginary part depends on whether the energy level $\\epsilon_k$ is occupied or unoccupied in the ground state.\n\n*   For an **unoccupied** state (a particle state, e.g., for fermions with $\\epsilon_k > E_F$, the Fermi energy), the pole is shifted by $+i\\eta$.\n*   For an **occupied** state (a hole state, e.g., for fermions with $\\epsilon_k < E_F$), the pole is shifted by $-i\\eta$.\n\nHere, $\\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal ($\\eta \\to 0^+$). This ensures causality and correctly describes the propagation of particles forward in time and holes backward in time.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\n\nCombining the results of the previous steps, we arrive at the complete expression for the bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - E_F)}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\hbar\\omega$ is the energy variable from the Fourier transform.\n*   $\\epsilon_k$ is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for state $k$.\n*   $E_F$ is the Fermi energy (for fermions; for bosons, the ground state is typically the vacuum, and all states are \"unoccupied\").\n*   $\\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal.\n*   $\\text{sgn}(x)$ is the sign function.\n\nThis expression explicitly shows that the functional dependence of $G_0$ on $\\epsilon_k$ is that of an inverse linear relationship, with the pole at $\\hbar\\omega = \\epsilon_k$ regulated by a term whose sign also depends on $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n<<<In the frequency-momentum representation, the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ as the inverse of their difference from the frequency-energy term $\\hbar\\omega$. The precise mathematical form, which accounts for causality via the Feynman prescription, is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - E_F)}$\n\nwhere $\\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal and $E_F$ is the Fermi energy.>>>"
