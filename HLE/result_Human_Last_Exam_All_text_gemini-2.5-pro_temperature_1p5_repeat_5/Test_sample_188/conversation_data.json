  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This is an information theory problem disguised in a story. Let's break it down to find the necessary information and discard the irrelevant parts.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main question is to find the maximum possible length of a secret message. The length of a message is measured by the number of characters it contains.\n\n2.  **Identify the Message Alphabet:** The problem states, \"This message is also written using the letters in the Shu.\" It further clarifies, \"the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters.\" Therefore, the set of characters available to write the message (the alphabet) consists of 120 distinct characters.\n\n3.  **Identify the Encryption Medium:** The message is encrypted in the 'Ching'. The 'Ching' \"contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing.\" These symbols are the building blocks used to encode the message characters.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Encoding Units (the symbols):** A single symbol is described as \"yinyang-wuxing\".\n    *   \"Yinyang\" represents 2 possibilities (yin or yang).\n    *   \"Wuxing\" (the Five Elements: metal, wood, water, fire, earth) represents 5 possibilities.\n    *   Therefore, one symbol can represent `2 * 5 = 10` distinct states. This means the encryption system is essentially a base-10 system.\n\n5.  **Determine How Many Symbols Encode One Character:** To encode a message, we need to map a sequence of symbols from the 'Ching' to each character of the message alphabet. We need to find the minimum number of symbols required to represent all 120 possible characters. Let `k` be the number of symbols needed for one character.\n    *   With 1 symbol, we can represent `10^1 = 10` different characters. This is not enough for 120.\n    *   With 2 symbols, we can represent `10^2 = 100` different characters. This is still not enough for 120.\n    *   With 3 symbols, we can represent `10^3 = 1000` different characters. This is more than enough to give a unique code to each of the 120 characters.\n    *   Therefore, the most efficient encoding requires a sequence of **3 symbols** from the 'Ching' to represent one character of the secret message.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Maximum Message Length:** Now we can find the maximum number of characters in the message by dividing the total number of available symbols by the number of symbols required for each character.\n    *   Total available symbols in the 'Ching' = 9999\n    *   Symbols needed per message character = 3\n    *   Maximum message length = Total Symbols / Symbols per Character\n    *   Maximum message length = `9999 / 3` = `3333`\n\n**Careful Points and Discarded Information:**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The core of the problem is realizing that it's about encoding 120 possibilities using a base-10 system.\n*   **Discarded:** \"The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters.\" This is irrelevant; the key information is the size of the alphabet (120), not the length of the book where the alphabet was found.\n*   **Discarded:** \"The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms.\" This is information about the *discovery process*, not about the properties of the message itself.\n*   **Discarded:** \"Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\" This is also irrelevant technical detail about the discovery process.\n\nThe maximum length of the message is the total number of 3-symbol blocks that can be formed from the 9999 available symbols.\n\nFinal Calculation: 9999 / 3 = 3333.\n\n<<<3333>>>"
