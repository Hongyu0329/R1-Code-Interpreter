    "This problem requires us to determine the number of logical qubits that can be stored in a specific surface code configuration. Let's break down the problem methodically.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Basics of Surface Code Encoding**\n\nThe number of logical qubits (`k`) that can be encoded in a surface code depends on the topology of the surface on which the code is defined. The general formula is:\n\n`k = 2g + b - c`\n\nWhere:\n*   `g` is the genus of the surface (the number of \"handles\" or \"donuts\"). For a flat plane or a sphere, `g=0`. For a torus, `g=1`.\n*   `b` is the number of boundaries (holes or outer edges) on the surface.\n*   `c` is the number of connected components (or separate \"patches\").\n\nSince the problem states we have two separate patches, we can analyze each patch individually and sum the results. For a single connected patch (`c=1`), the formula simplifies to:\n\n`k = 2g + b - 1`\n\nA \"patch\" of surface code is typically laid out on a simple planar surface, which means its genus `g` is 0. Thus, for a single patch, the formula becomes:\n\n`k = b - 1`\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Problem Statement**\n\nThe question describes a system of \"two patches of surface code with two holes.\" There are two possible interpretations:\n1.  There is a total of two holes distributed between the two patches.\n2.  Each of the two patches has two holes.\n\nThe phrasing \"two X's with two Y's\" (e.g., \"two cars with four wheels\") typically means that each X has two Y's. This is the most common interpretation in a technical context. Furthermore, the question asks for the maximum number of logical qubits, and this interpretation will yield a larger result. We will proceed with the assumption that *each* patch has two holes.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze a Single Patch**\n\nLet's calculate the number of logical qubits for a single patch with two holes.\n\n*   **Genus (`g`):** As established, for a standard surface code patch, `g = 0`.\n*   **Boundaries (`b`):** The number of boundaries is the sum of the internal holes and the outer perimeter of the patch.\n    *   Number of internal holes = 2.\n    *   Number of outer boundaries = 1.\n    *   Total boundaries `b = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n\n*   **Logical Qubits per Patch (`k_patch`):** Now we use the simplified formula `k = b - 1`.\n    *   `k_patch = 3 - 1 = 2`.\n\nSo, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode 2 logical qubits.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Logical Qubits**\n\nThe system consists of two separate, non-interacting patches. The total number of logical qubits is simply the sum of the logical qubits that can be encoded in each patch.\n\n*   Number of logical qubits in Patch 1 = 2.\n*   Number of logical qubits in Patch 2 = 2.\n*   Total logical qubits `k_total = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Topology Formula:** Ensure the correct formula (`k = 2g + b - c`) is used and correctly simplified for the specific case of planar codes (`g=0`) and separate components.\n2.  **Boundary Counting:** A common mistake is to forget the outer edge of the patch as a boundary. A patch with `n` holes has `n+1` total boundaries.\n3.  **Interpretation of the Question:** The ambiguity in \"with two holes\" is the most critical point. Choosing the interpretation where each patch has two holes is standard and also aligns with the \"at most\" part of the question, as it maximizes the result.\n4.  **Independent Patches:** Recognizing that separate patches mean their quantum information capacities add up linearly is crucial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, each of the two patches has 2 internal holes and 1 outer boundary, for a total of 3 boundaries. This allows each patch to encode `3 - 1 = 2` logical qubits. Since there are two such independent patches, the total number of logical qubits is `2 + 2 = 4`.\n\n<<<4>>>"
