    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected, metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[0,1]`, a circle `S^1`, a square `[0,1]x[0,1]`, but also more complex spaces like the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point.\n*   **Product of Continua:** If `X` and `Y` are continua, their Cartesian product `Z = X x Y` with the product topology is also a continuum. Since `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate, `Z` is also nondegenerate.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum that is itself a continuum. A *proper* subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not equal to the whole space.\n*   **Decomposable vs. Indecomposable Continuum:**\n    *   A continuum is **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. For example, the interval `[0,2]` is the union of `[0,1]` and `[1,2]`, both of which are proper subcontinua.\n    *   A continuum is **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable. Examples include the pseudo-arc and solenoids.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p` is the set of all points `q` in `X` such that `p` and `q` are contained together in some proper subcontinuum of `X`. The collection of all composants partitions the space `X`.\n\n**2. Relate Decomposability to the Number of Composants**\n\nThis is the most crucial part of the analysis. There is a fundamental theorem in continuum theory regarding the number of composants:\n\n*   A continuum `X` has **exactly one** composant if and only if it is **decomposable**. In this case, the single composant is the entire space `X` itself.\n*   A continuum `X` has **uncountably many** composants if and only if it is **indecomposable**. The cardinality of the set of composants is `c` (the cardinality of the continuum, `2^{\\aleph_0}`).\n\nA key point is that a continuum cannot have a finite number of composants greater than 1, nor can it have a countably infinite number of composants. The number is either 1 or `c`.\n\n**3. Analyze the Decomposability of the Product Space `X x Y`**\n\nOur goal is to find the *largest possible* number of composants for `Z = X x Y`. Based on the above, the possibilities are 1 and `c`. The largest is `c`. We now need to determine if it is possible for `X x Y` to have `c` composants. This would require `X x Y` to be indecomposable.\n\nThis leads us to another key theorem from continuum theory:\n\n*   The product `X x Y` of two continua is **decomposable** if and only if at least one of the factors, `X` or `Y`, is decomposable.\n\nFrom this theorem, we can deduce its contrapositive:\n\n*   The product `X x Y` of two continua is **indecomposable** if and only if **both** `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.\n\n**4. Find the Largest Possible Number**\n\nWe want to maximize the number of composants of `X x Y`.\n\n*   **Case 1: At least one of `X` or `Y` is decomposable.**\n    Let's say `X` is decomposable (e.g., `X = [0,1]`). Then, according to the theorem, the product `Z = X x Y` is also decomposable, regardless of whether `Y` is decomposable or indecomposable. Since `Z` is decomposable, it has exactly **1** composant.\n\n*   **Case 2: Both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.**\n    To achieve this, we need to choose `X` and `Y` to be indecomposable nondegenerate continua. Such continua exist; the pseudo-arc is a prime example. If we let `X` be a pseudo-arc and `Y` be a pseudo-arc, then both are indecomposable. According to the theorem, their product `Z = X x Y` is also indecomposable. Since `Z` is an indecomposable continuum, it has `c` (uncountably many) composants.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe number of composants of the product space `X x Y` can be either 1 (if at least one factor is decomposable) or `c` (if both factors are indecomposable). Since the question asks for the largest *possible* number, we compare these two possibilities. The number `c` (the cardinality of the continuum) is an uncountable infinity, which is larger than 1.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of composants is `c`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Generality of \"Continuum\":** The question applies to all continua, not just \"nice\" ones like arcs or disks (which are all decomposable). The existence of indecomposable continua is essential to the solution.\n2.  **Meaning of \"Number\":** In this context, \"number\" refers to the cardinality of the set of composants.\n3.  **No Intermediate Values:** A crucial fact is that the number of composants for any continuum is either exactly 1 or uncountably many (`c`). There are no other possibilities.\n4.  **Existence is Key:** The argument rests on the existence of indecomposable continua, which can be chosen as the factors `X` and `Y` to achieve the maximum number of composants in their product.\n\nThe final answer is the cardinality of the continuum, which is represented by the symbol `c`.\n\n<<<c>>>"
