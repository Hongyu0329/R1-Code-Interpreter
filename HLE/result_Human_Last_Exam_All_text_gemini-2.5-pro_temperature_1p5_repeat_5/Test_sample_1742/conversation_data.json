    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice for the path algebra $A = \\mathbb{C}(1 \\to 2 \\to 3)$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Modules\nThe algebra $A$ is the path algebra of the quiver $Q: 1 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} 2 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 3$. This is a hereditary algebra of finite representation type $A_3$.\n\nThe indecomposable $A$-modules can be indexed by intervals $[i, j]$ with $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$. Let $M_{ij}$ be the module with dimension vector having 1s at vertices from $i$ to $j$ and 0s elsewhere, and identity maps between them.\nThere are $\\frac{3(3+1)}{2} = 6$ indecomposable modules:\n*   $S_1 = M_{11}$: Representation $\\mathbb{C} \\to 0 \\to 0$. Simple at vertex 1.\n*   $S_2 = M_{22}$: Representation $0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to 0$. Simple at vertex 2.\n*   $S_3 = M_{33}$: Representation $0 \\to 0 \\to \\mathbb{C}$. Simple at vertex 3.\n*   $I_2 = M_{12}$: Representation $\\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to 0$.\n*   $P_2 = M_{23}$: Representation $0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}$.\n*   $P_1 = I_3 = M_{13}$: Representation $\\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nThe projective and injective modules are:\n*   Projectives: $P_1 = M_{13}$, $P_2 = M_{23}$, $P_3 = S_3 = M_{33}$. The projective module $A = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$.\n*   Injectives: $I_1 = S_1 = M_{11}$, $I_2 = M_{12}$, $I_3 = P_1 = M_{13}$. The injective cogenerator is $D(A) = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus I_3$.\n\n### Step 2: Understand $\\tau$-tilting modules and Slice modules\n*   **$\\tau$-tilting module**: For a hereditary algebra, an $A$-module $T$ is a **tilting module** if $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T, T) = 0$ and it has $n=3$ non-isomorphic indecomposable summands. The modern notion of a **$\\tau$-tilting module** (as defined by Adachi-Iyama-Reiten) is a module $T$ that is **$\\tau$-rigid** (i.e., $\\text{Hom}_A(T, \\tau T) = 0$) and has $n=3$ summands. For hereditary algebras, the Auslander-Reiten duality formula $\\text{Ext}_A^1(M, N) \\cong D\\text{Hom}_A(N, \\tau M)$ shows that these two definitions are equivalent, provided $N$ has no injective summands. A more careful check shows they are equivalent for all modules.\n*   **Auslander-Reiten translation $\\tau$**: For the quiver $1\\to2\\to3$:\n    *   $\\tau(M_{ij}) = M_{i-1,j-1}$ does not apply here. The correct action is calculated via AR-sequences.\n    *   $\\tau(M_{33}) = M_{22}$, i.e., $\\tau S_3 = S_2$.\n    *   $\\tau(M_{22}) = M_{11}$, i.e., $\\tau S_2 = S_1$.\n    *   $\\tau(M_{23}) = M_{12}$, i.e., $\\tau P_2 = I_2$.\n    *   Modules $M_{1j}$ are injective, so $\\tau(M_{11}) = \\tau(M_{12}) = \\tau(M_{13}) = 0$.\n*   **Slice module**: A tilting module $T = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^n T_i$ is a slice module if the set of its summands $\\{T_1, \\dots, T_n\\}$ forms a **slice** in the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver of $A$. A key property of a slice in the AR quiver is that it is connected (as a subgraph of the AR quiver).\n\nThe AR-quiver for $A = \\mathbb{C}(1 \\to 2 \\to 3)$ is:\n```\n         M_33 (S_3=P_3)\n         /\n     M_23 (P_2)\n     /   \\\n M_13 (P_1=I_3)  M_22 (S_2)\n     \\   /\n     M_12 (I_2)\n      \\\n      M_11 (S_1=I_1)\n```\n\nA module that is \"not a slice\" would correspond to a tilting module whose set of summands is not a connected subgraph of the AR quiver.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Candidate Module\nWe are looking for a tilting module $T=T_1 \\oplus T_2 \\oplus T_3$ whose summands $\\{T_1, T_2, T_3\\}$ are disconnected in the AR quiver. By inspecting the AR quiver, a possible disconnected set of 3 vertices is $\\{M_{13}, M_{12}, M_{33}\\}$. Let's test if $T = M_{13} \\oplus M_{12} \\oplus M_{33}$ is a tilting module.\n\nThis module is $T = P_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_3$.\n\nTo check if $T$ is a tilting module, we must verify that $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T_i, T_j) = 0$ for all pairs of its summands $T_i, T_j \\in \\{P_1, I_2, S_3\\}$.\n\n1.  If $T_i$ is projective or $T_j$ is injective, $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T_i, T_j) = 0$.\n    *   $P_1$ is projective and injective. So all $\\text{Ext}^1$ involving $P_1$ are zero.\n    *   $I_2$ is injective. So $\\text{Ext}^1(-, I_2) = 0$.\n    *   $S_3 (=P_3)$ is projective. So $\\text{Ext}^1(S_3, -) = 0$.\n\n2.  The only pair left to check is $\\text{Ext}_A^1(I_2, S_3)$. Since $S_3=P_3$ is projective, $\\text{Ext}_A^1(I_2, P_3) = 0$.\n\nAll Ext groups are zero, so $T = P_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_3$ is indeed a tilting module.\n\n### Step 4: Verify it is not a slice and is unique\n*   **Not a slice**: The set of summands $\\{M_{13}, M_{12}, M_{33}\\}$ is a disconnected set of vertices in the AR quiver. A slice must be a connected subgraph. Therefore, $T$ is not a slice module.\n\n*   **Uniqueness**: For a path algebra of type $A_n$, it is a known result that there can be tilting modules which are not slices. For $A_3$, there are two such modules, which are dual to each other. One is $T=P_1\\oplus I_2\\oplus S_3$. The other is its dual over the opposite algebra $A^{op}$, which is not a tilting module over $A$. Let's briefly check the dual module $D(T)$ over $A^{op}$. The algebra $A^{op}$ corresponds to the quiver $1 \\leftarrow 2 \\leftarrow 3$. The dual module is $D(T)=D(P_1)\\oplus D(I_2)\\oplus D(S_3) = I'_1 \\oplus P'_2 \\oplus S'_3$, where the primes denote modules over $A^{op}$. A similar analysis for $A^{op}$ shows that this dual module is a tilting module over $A^{op}$, and also not a slice. The question asks for a module in mod-$A$. The existence of this dual shows there's another non-slice tilting module, but for the opposite algebra. Within mod-A, we should investigate if any other combination works. It turns out that any other non-slice tilting module for A is isomorphic to T. Therefore, $T = P_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_3$ is the unique tilting module over $A$ that is not a slice.\n\nThe module is the direct sum of the indecomposable projective module at vertex 1, the indecomposable injective module at vertex 2, and the simple module at vertex 3.\n\n$T = P_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_3$.\n\n<<< $P_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_3$ >>>"
