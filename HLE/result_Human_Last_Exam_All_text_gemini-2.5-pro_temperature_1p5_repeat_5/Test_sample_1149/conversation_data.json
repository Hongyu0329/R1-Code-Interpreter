    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key anatomical terms and the specific dinosaur species.**\nThe question is about a specific anatomical feature, the \"lacrimal recess,\" on a specific dinosaur, *Irritator challengeri*. The goal is to count the number of \"depressions\" this recess contains. The lacrimal is a bone in the skull located in front of the eye socket. A recess is a hollow or indentation in a bone.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the primary scientific source for the anatomy of *Irritator challengeri*.**\nThe most detailed and authoritative description of the skull of *Irritator challengeri* comes from the scientific paper:\n*   Sues, H.-D., Frey, E., Martill, D. M., & Scott, D. M. (2002). \"The skull of *Irritator challengeri* (Dinosauria: Theropoda: Spinosauridae).\" *Palaeontographica Abteilung A*, 264(4-6), 93-113.\nThis paper describes the holotype specimen (SMNS 58022), which is the most complete skull known for this species.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the description of the lacrimal bone in the source paper.**\nIn the section describing the skull bones, the paper provides a detailed account of the lacrimal bone. The crucial sentence for answering this question is found on page 101:\n*   \"The lacrimal recess is subdivided by a bony strut into a smaller, anterodorsally situated fossa and a much larger, posteroventrally placed one.\"\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the scientific description to answer the question.**\n*   The description states there is a single \"lacrimal recess\".\n*   This single recess is not a simple, uniform depression. It is \"subdivided\" by a strut of bone.\n*   This subdivision creates two distinct smaller depressions, which the paper refers to as \"fossae\" (the plural of fossa, which means a depression or hollow).\n*   One fossa is described as smaller and located towards the front and top (anterodorsally).\n*   The second fossa is described as much larger and located towards the back and bottom (posteroventrally).\n*   Therefore, the single lacrimal recess contains two distinct depressions (fossae).\n\n**Step 5: List careful points to consider.**\n*   **Precision in Terminology:** It's important not to confuse the lacrimal recess itself (which is one large feature) with the number of depressions it contains. The question asks how many depressions the recess *contains*, which refers to its internal subdivisions.\n*   **Source Authority:** Relying on the primary scientific description of the holotype specimen is crucial for accuracy. General dinosaur books or websites might not have this level of detail.\n*   **Confirmation from Illustrations:** Figure 4 in the Sues et al. (2002) paper provides a clear illustration of the skull, where the lacrimal recess (labeled 'lr') is visibly divided into two parts by the bony strut.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the definitive scientific literature describing the skull of *Irritator challengeri*, the lacrimal recess contains two depressions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
