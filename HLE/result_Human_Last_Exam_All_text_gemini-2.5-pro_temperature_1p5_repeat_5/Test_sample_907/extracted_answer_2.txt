The equations for the absorption cross-section $\sigma(\omega)$ are as follows, where $C$ is a constant incorporating fundamental physical constants, $N$ is the number of molecules in the chain, $\omega$ is the photon frequency, the sum is over transitions from all occupied orbitals $o$ to unoccupied orbitals $u$, $\mu_{ou,z}$ is the z-component of the single-molecule transition dipole moment for the transition, and $\epsilon_u, \epsilon_o$ are the single-electron orbital energies. The $\delta$ function represents an ideally sharp absorption line.

**a) The interaction between molecules can be neglected:**
The cross-section is the sum of the cross-sections of $N$ independent molecules.

$\sigma(\omega) = C \cdot N \cdot \omega \sum_{o,u} |\mu_{ou,z}|^2 \delta(\hbar\omega - (\epsilon_u - \epsilon_o))$

**b) The interaction between near-neighbors should be considered:**
The interaction creates delocalized exciton states. A selection rule makes only the $k=0$ exciton optically active, leading to an energy-shifted absorption peak.

$\sigma(\omega) = C \cdot N \cdot \omega \sum_{o,u} |\mu_{ou,z}|^2 \delta(\hbar\omega - (\epsilon_u - \epsilon_o + D_{ou} + 2J_{ou}))$

Here, $D_{ou}$ is the environmental energy shift and $J_{ou}$ is the nearest-neighbor excitation transfer integral for the specific $(o,u)$ transition. The term $(D_{ou} + 2J_{ou})$ represents the exciton energy shift.
