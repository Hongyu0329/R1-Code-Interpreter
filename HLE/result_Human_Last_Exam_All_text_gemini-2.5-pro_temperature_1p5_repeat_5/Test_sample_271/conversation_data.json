    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial**\n\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We can try to factor this polynomial by grouping terms:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nLet $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $h(x) = x^2 - 2$. The roots of $f(x)$ are the union of the roots of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$. The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois group of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the factors $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ separately.\n\n*   **Analysis of $h(x) = x^2 - 2$:**\n    The roots of $h(x)$ are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field of $h(x)$ is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a normal extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ of degree 2, and its Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$ (the cyclic group of order 2).\n\n*   **Analysis of $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:**\n    1.  **Irreducibility:** We use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The leading coefficient is 1 ($3 \\nmid 1$), all other coefficients are divisible by 3 ($-9$, $0$, $0$, $3$), and the constant term 3 is not divisible by $3^2=9$. Thus, $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    2.  **Number of Real Roots:** We analyze the derivative $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $g'(x)$, which are $x = \\pm\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. This means $g(x)$ has two local extrema.\n        $g(-\\infty) \\to -\\infty$, $g(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) < 0$, $g(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) > 0$, $g(+\\infty) \\to \\infty$.\n        Let's evaluate $g(x)$ at some integer points:\n        $g(-2) = -32 + 18 + 3 = -11$\n        $g(0) = 3$\n        $g(1) = 1 - 9 + 3 = -5$\n        $g(2) = 32 - 18 + 3 = 17$\n        There are roots in $(-2, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(1, 2)$. So, $g(x)$ has exactly three real roots. The remaining two roots must be a complex conjugate pair.\n    3.  **Galois Group:** For an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with exactly two non-real roots, its Galois group is the full symmetric group $S_p$. Here $p=5$, so the Galois group of $g(x)$ is $S_5$. Let $K_g$ be the splitting field of $g(x)$. Then $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$, and $[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n*   **The Galois Group of the Compositum Field $K = K_g K_h$**\n    The Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of the direct product $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$. It is equal to the direct product if and only if $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The intersection is non-trivial if and only if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\subseteq K_g$.\n    The group $S_5$ has only one subgroup of index 2, the alternating group $A_5$. By Galois correspondence, $K_g$ has a unique quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g})$, where $\\Delta_g$ is the discriminant of $g(x)$.\n    The discriminant of $x^n+ax+b$ is $\\Delta = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n b^{n-1} + (1-n)^{n-1}a^n)$.\n    For $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we have $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n    $\\Delta_g = (-1)^{10} (5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-4)^4 (-9)^5) = 253125 + 256(-59049) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\n    So the unique quadratic subfield of $K_g$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$.\n    For $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ to be this subfield, we would need $\\sqrt{2} = q \\sqrt{-14863419}$ for some $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. This would imply $2 = q^2(-14863419)$, which is impossible for a rational $q$.\n    Therefore, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\not\\subseteq K_g$, so $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    This means the Galois group of $K = K_g(\\sqrt{2})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$. The degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| \\cdot |C_2| = 120 \\cdot 2 = 240$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the degrees of intermediate normal extensions**\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G=S_5 \\times C_2$ such that $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$. The degree of the extension is given by $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nWe need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G=S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $G$ include:\n1.  **Products of normal subgroups:**\n    *   $H_1 = \\{e\\} \\times C_2$. $|H_1| = 2$. Index $[G:H_1] = 240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $H_2 = A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$. $|H_2| = 60$. Index $[G:H_2] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $H_3 = A_5 \\times C_2$. $|H_3| = 60 \\times 2 = 120$. Index $[G:H_3] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $H_4 = S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$. $|H_4| = 120$. Index $[G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n2.  **\"Twisted\" or \"Diagonal\" normal subgroups:** These can be found using Goursat's Lemma. They correspond to isomorphisms between quotients of normal subgroups.\n    The non-trivial quotients of normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$, $A_5/\\{e\\} \\cong A_5$, and $S_5/\\{e\\} \\cong S_5$.\n    The non-trivial quotient of normal subgroups of $C_2$ is $C_2/\\{e\\} \\cong C_2$.\n    The only possible isomorphism between non-trivial quotients is $\\phi: S_5/A_5 \\to C_2/\\{e\\}$.\n    This gives rise to a normal subgroup $H_5 = \\{(\\sigma, c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\phi(\\sigma A_5) = c \\}$. Let's identify the non-identity element of $C_2$ as $-1$ and the non-identity coset of $A_5$ with sign $-1$. Then $H_5 = \\{(\\sigma, c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\text{sgn}(\\sigma) = c \\}$.\n    The order of this subgroup is $|H_5| = |A_5| \\times 1 + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| \\times 1 = 60+60=120$.\n    The index is $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n**Step 4: Consolidate the results**\n\nThe possible orders of proper non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ are 2, 60, and 120.\nThe possible degrees of the corresponding normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ are the indices of these subgroups:\n*   For $|H|=2$, the degree is $240/2 = 120$.\n*   For $|H|=60$, the degree is $240/60 = 4$.\n*   For $|H|=120$, the degree is $240/120 = 2$.\n\nThus, the set of all possible degrees for such extensions $L$ is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
