The proposed design outlines a Schnorr-based threshold signature scheme. It begins with a Distributed Key Generation (DKG) phase to establish a group public key `PK` and individual secret shares `sk_i`. The signing protocol proceeds in two rounds. In Round 1 (Commitment), each of the `t` participating parties generates a random nonce `r_i`, computes its commitment `R_i = r_i * G`, and broadcasts `R_i`. In Round 2 (Partial Signature), after receiving all `R_j` commitments, each party `P_i` computes a binding factor `b_j` for each participant `j` based on a hash of the full context (message, PK, and all `R_j` commitments). Then, it computes the group nonce point `R = Σ(b_j * R_j)`, the challenge `c = H(PK, R, m)`, and its partial signature `s_i = r_i * b_i + c * L_i * sk_i`, which it broadcasts. Finally, an aggregator combines the partial signatures by summation `s = Σs_j` to form the final signature `(R, s)`. This design achieves tight security by using the binding factors `b_j` to prevent malleability attacks, thus ensuring that each partial signature is uniquely tied to its specific signing context.
