    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Question**\nThe core task is to compute the determinant of a given 3x3 matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} \n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & -1 & 2 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe problem provides context that this matrix is the \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\". However, since the matrix `A` is explicitly provided, we do not need to use the contextual information to derive the matrix. Our goal is simply to find the determinant of `A`.\n\n**2. List of Careful Points**\n*   **Focus on the given matrix:** The most important information is the matrix `A` itself. The terminology \"Markov quiver\" and the value \"m_{1/2} = 13\" serve to identify the matrix's origin but are not required for the calculation.\n*   **Recognize the matrix type:** This matrix is a special type known as a Laplacian matrix, specifically for the complete graph on 3 vertices (Kâ‚ƒ). This recognition can provide a shortcut but is not necessary for the solution.\n*   **Check for simple properties:** Before diving into calculation, it's wise to check for properties that simplify finding the determinant. For instance, are there linearly dependent rows or columns?\n*   **Choose a reliable calculation method:** For a 3x3 matrix, the standard cofactor expansion (or Sarrus's rule) is a reliable method.\n\n**3. Acquiring the Final Answer**\n\nWe can compute the determinant using two different methods.\n\n**Method 1: Direct Calculation using Cofactor Expansion**\n\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix\n\\[ \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nis `det = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n\nFor our matrix `A`:\n*   a = 2, b = -1, c = -1\n*   d = -1, e = 2, f = -1\n*   g = -1, h = -1, i = 2\n\nLet's substitute these values into the formula:\n*   `det(A) = 2 * ( (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) ) - (-1) * ( (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) ) + (-1) * ( (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) )`\n*   `det(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 - (-2))`\n*   `det(A) = 2 * (3) + 1 * (-3) - 1 * (1 + 2)`\n*   `det(A) = 6 - 3 - 1 * (3)`\n*   `det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3`\n*   `det(A) = 0`\n\n**Method 2: Using Properties of the Matrix**\n\nA key property of a square matrix is that if its rows or columns are linearly dependent, its determinant is zero. Linear dependence means that one row/column can be written as a linear combination of the others.\n\nLet's examine the columns of matrix `A`: C1, C2, and C3.\n*   C1 = `[2, -1, -1]`\n*   C2 = `[-1, 2, -1]`\n*   C3 = `[-1, -1, 2]`\n\nLet's add them together:\n*   C1 + C2 + C3 = `[2-1-1, -1+2-1, -1-1+2]` = `[0, 0, 0]`\n\nSince the sum of the three column vectors is the zero vector, the columns are linearly dependent. (For example, C1 = -C2 - C3).\nA matrix with linearly dependent columns is singular, and a singular matrix always has a determinant of 0.\n\nThis confirms the result from the direct calculation.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBoth methods show that the determinant of the given matrix `A` is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
