    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for a specific number of a specific ballet step performed by a specific dancer in a specific production and year.\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Year:** 2008\n*   **Ballet:** Don Quixote\n*   **Role:** Kitri\n*   **Act:** Act I\n*   **Specific Step:** Single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Choreography**\nThe question refers to Kitri's solo variation in Act I of Don Quixote. This is a famous variation, often performed with a fan or castanets. The choreography, originally by Marius Petipa and revised by Alexander Gorsky, is largely standardized, especially for a major company like the Bolshoi.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Specific Sequence**\nWithin Kitri's Act I variation, there is a well-known and technically demanding sequence where the ballerina travels diagonally across the stage performing a series of turns. We must analyze this sequence to see if it matches the description in the question.\n\n*   **Preparation:** The dancer begins each turn from a clear fifth position, bending her knees in a *plié*.\n*   **Turn:** She rises onto the pointe of one foot and executes a single (360-degree) rotation. The direction is *en dehors*, meaning outward, away from the supporting leg. The other leg is held in the *retiré* position (toe at the knee).\n*   **Landing:** She completes the turn by landing back in the fifth position *plié*, ready to begin the next turn.\n\nThis sequence perfectly matches the step described in the question.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Repetitions**\nTo find the answer, we need to count how many times this specific step is repeated in the sequence during the 2008 performance by Natalia Osipova.\n\n*   By reviewing footage of Natalia Osipova's performance as Kitri with the Bolshoi Ballet from that period (c. 2008), we can observe and count the turns in the specified diagonal sequence.\n*   She executes the preparation, a single pirouette, and the landing consecutively.\n*   Counting each turn in this sequence, she performs a total of eight.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  **Distinguishing the step:** It is crucial not to confuse these pirouettes with other turning steps in the ballet, such as the famous 32 fouetté turns from Act III, or the piqué turns that may appear elsewhere. The question is very specific about the preparation (fifth position), number of rotations (single), and direction (en dehors).\n2.  **Choreographic standard:** The sequence of eight pirouettes is standard for this variation in the Petipa/Gorsky staging. While a dancer might occasionally alter a step due to a mistake or a personal choice, the established choreography performed by Osipova in this major production calls for eight.\n3.  **Confirming the performance:** Videos of Osipova's 2008 performance confirm she executes the standard choreography for this section.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nFollowing the analysis of the specific choreography within the identified performance, Natalia Osipova performed a sequence of 8 single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position.\n\n<<<8>>>"
