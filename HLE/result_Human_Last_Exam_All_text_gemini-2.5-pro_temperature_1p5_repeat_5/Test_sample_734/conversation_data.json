    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question asks to identify a specific Christian theologian who satisfies four main criteria:\n1.  They must be a **Christian theologian**.\n2.  They must be the **first** to develop a particular conceptual framework.\n3.  This framework must include **specialized terminology** to describe how the **laws of nature can change**.\n4.  This terminology must be applicable to two distinct events: the **virgin birth** (a singular, miraculous event) and the **Fall** (a foundational, systemic change in the natural order).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates**\nBased on the history of Christian thought on creation, miracles, and natural law, several major figures come to mind:\n*   **Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD):** An early Church Father who wrote extensively on creation, providence, and miracles. He is a strong candidate for being the \"first\" to systematize these ideas.\n*   **Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274 AD):** A medieval scholastic theologian who developed a highly detailed system integrating Aristotelian philosophy with Christian doctrine. His work on God's power and natural law is extremely influential.\n*   **Reformation and Modern Theologians (e.g., Calvin, C.S. Lewis):** While they discussed these topics, they are generally building on earlier foundations and are less likely to be the *first* to develop the core terminology. The question points towards a foundational figure.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Augustine of Hippo's Contribution**\nAugustine was one of the first theologians to grapple systematically with how an omnipotent God interacts with the natural order He created.\n\n*   **Specialized Terminology:** Augustine developed several key concepts and terms to explain this interaction.\n    *   ***Rationes Seminales* (Seminal Reasons):** Augustine proposed that God embedded \"seeds\" or latent potentials into creation from the very beginning. These are the causal principles for everything that would later come into being, including things that appear miraculous.\n    *   ***Cursus Usitatus Naturæ* (The Usual Course of Nature):** This phrase describes the regular, predictable way nature operates, which we observe as the \"laws of nature.\"\n    *   **Miracles as *Contra Quam Notum Est Nobis Naturam* (Against Nature as It is Known to Us):** Crucially, Augustine argued that a miracle is not truly \"against nature\" (*contra naturam*) as God created it in its totality. Instead, it is an event that runs contrary to our limited human experience and understanding of nature's usual course. It is an expression of a higher, hidden aspect of God's natural order.\n\n*   **Application to the Test Cases:**\n    *   **Virgin Birth:** For Augustine, the virgin birth is not a violation of nature itself, but an event outside its *usual course*. It was made possible by a *ratio seminalis*, a potential for this unique event that God had placed within creation's fabric from the beginning, to be actualized at the chosen moment.\n    *   **The Fall:** Augustine taught that the Fall resulted in a fundamental change in the state of human nature. Before the Fall, humanity was in a state of *posse non mori* (\"able not to die\"). After sin, this changed to a state of *non posse non mori* (\"not able not to die\"), where mortality and corruption became an inescapable part of our natural condition. This represents a systemic alteration in the laws governing human physical life as a direct consequence of a spiritual event.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Thomas Aquinas's Contribution**\nAquinas, writing centuries later, built upon Augustine's foundation. He is famous for the distinction between:\n*   ***Potentia Ordinata* (Ordained Power):** God's power as it is expressed through the consistent, established laws of nature that He ordained.\n*   ***Potentia Absoluta* (Absolute Power):** God's sheer ability to do anything that is not logically contradictory, including acting outside the established \"ordained\" order.\n\nWhile this terminology is highly specialized and applicable, Augustine's work precedes it and lays the conceptual groundwork. Augustine was the *first* to create a coherent philosophical system with its own terminology to address these specific problems. Aquinas's terms are a later refinement and development within the scholastic tradition.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nGiven the criterion of being the **first** to develop such a system and terminology, Augustine of Hippo is the correct answer. He established the foundational concepts that miracles are not violations of God's ultimate natural order but expressions of a deeper, hidden potential within it, and that the laws governing nature (specifically human nature) could undergo a systemic change due to an event like the Fall. His concepts of *rationes seminales* and miracles being against nature *as we know it* represent the first specialized theological framework designed to explain these phenomena.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
