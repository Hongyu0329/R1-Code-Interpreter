    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the physicist in question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key criteria.**\nThe question is asking for a specific physicist who meets four distinct criteria:\n1.  **Field of Fame:** The person is primarily known for their work in the field of microscopy.\n2.  **Discovery:** The discovery was an optical effect.\n3.  **Nature of the Effect:** The effect is related to the formation of \"real imagery\".\n4.  **Circumstance of Discovery:** The effect was first noticed accidentally by a custodial worker who was cleaning concave mirrors.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the \"Circumstance of Discovery\" clue.**\nThis is the most unique and telling part of the question. A story about a custodian or cleaner discovering an optical illusion is a specific anecdote that can be researched. The story describes a cleaner working with large, precision, front-surface concave mirrors (like those used in astronomical telescopes). While dusting the mirror, the cleaner was startled by what appeared to be a \"ghostly\" or three-dimensional cloud of dust floating in mid-air in front of the mirror.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the optical effect.**\nThis \"ghostly\" image is a **real image**. A concave mirror can form a real, inverted image at a focal point in space. When the object (the dust on the mirror's surface) and the observer are positioned correctly relative to the mirror's center of curvature and focal point, the scattered light from the dust particles is focused to create a three-dimensional, pseudoscopic (depth-inverted) image that appears to float in space. This is the \"optical effect in real imagery\" mentioned in the question.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the physicist associated with this effect and anecdote.**\nThe physicist who is famously credited with investigating, explaining, and popularizing this phenomenon after it was reported by the cleaner is **Georges (or Jerzy) Nomarski**. He was working at the Institut d'Optique Théorique et Appliquée in France when this incident is said to have occurred. He created demonstrations of the effect, which are sometimes referred to as \"Nomarski's Ghost\" or an aerial image illusion.\n\n**Step 5: Verify that the physicist meets all the criteria.**\n*   **Physicist?** Yes, Georges Nomarski (1919-1997) was a Polish-French physicist and optical engineer.\n*   **Known for work in the microscopy field?** Yes. This is the crucial confirmation. Georges Nomarski is *best known* and celebrated for his invention of **Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy**. This technique is so closely associated with him that it is often simply called **Nomarski microscopy**. It is a major advancement in light microscopy that allows for visualizing unstained, transparent specimens. This perfectly satisfies the \"better known for work in the microscopy field\" criterion.\n*   **Discovered an optical effect in real imagery?** Yes, as described in Step 3 & 4, he investigated and explained the 3D real image formed by the concave mirror.\n*   **Accidental observation by a custodial worker?** Yes, this specific anecdote is widely attributed to Nomarski's investigation.\n\n**Conclusion:** All points in the question clearly point to Georges Nomarski. He is the physicist better known for Nomarski (DIC) microscopy who investigated the real image optical effect first seen by a custodian cleaning a concave mirror.\n\n<<<Georges Nomarski>>>"
