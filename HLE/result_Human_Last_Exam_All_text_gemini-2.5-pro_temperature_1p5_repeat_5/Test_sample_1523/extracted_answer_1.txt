The inner product $(\phi, D_\phi)$ for a neutral scalar field in the functional integral is given by the expression: $\int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^3x \, \phi(x, \tau) (-\partial_\tau^2 - \nabla^2 + m^2) \phi(x, \tau)$, where $\beta=1/T$ is the inverse temperature, $m$ is the mass of the scalar field, $\tau$ is the imaginary time, and the integration is over Euclidean spacetime.
