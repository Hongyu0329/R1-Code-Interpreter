    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Musical Terminology\n\nFirst, let's break down the key terms in the question:\n\n*   **The Beatles:** The artist is specified, so we only need to consider their official discography.\n*   **Starts with:** This indicates the chord progression must happen at the very beginning of the song, as part of the introduction.\n*   **Tonic:** In music theory, the tonic is the first note of a scale and the chord built on that note (designated as the 'I' chord). It's the \"home\" chord of the key, providing a sense of rest and resolution. For example, in the key of G major, the tonic chord is G major.\n*   **Minor fifth chord:** This is the crucial part. In a standard major key, the fifth degree of the scale forms a major chord (known as the 'V' chord or the dominant). For example, in the key of G major, the fifth note is D, and the standard chord is D major. A \"minor fifth chord\" (designated as a 'v' chord) is a non-diatonic or \"borrowed\" chord, meaning it's taken from the parallel minor key. In our G major example, the minor fifth would be a D minor chord.\n\n### Step 2: Translating the Theory into a Concrete Progression\n\nWe are looking for a song that starts with a **I -> v** chord change. Let's create an example to make this clear:\n*   If the song is in the key of **A major**:\n    *   The tonic (I) chord is **A major**.\n    *   The fifth note of the A major scale is E. The standard dominant (V) chord would be E major.\n    *   The **minor fifth (v) chord** would be **E minor**.\n*   Therefore, the progression we are searching for is a direct jump from an **A major chord to an E minor chord**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Beatles Songs\n\nNow, we need to go through the Beatles' catalogue, focusing on the intros of their songs, to find this specific I -> v progression.\n\n*   **\"Yesterday\"**: Starts on F major (I), but the next chord is Em7. While this is a minor chord, E is the seventh degree in the key of F, not the fifth. So, this is incorrect.\n*   **\"Michelle\"**: Starts on an Fm chord. This is a minor tonic (i), not a major tonic (I). So, this is incorrect.\n*   **\"A Hard Day's Night\"**: Starts with the famous, complex G11sus4 chord. This is not a simple tonic chord. Incorrect.\n*   **\"Help!\"**: The opening guitar line is played over an A major chord (the tonic), but the next chord in the progression is a C# minor. C# is the third degree of the A major scale. Incorrect.\n*   **\"I'll Be Back\"** (from the album *A Hard Day's Night*):\n    *   Let's analyze the opening. The song begins immediately with strummed acoustic guitars.\n    *   The very first chord is **A major**. This establishes the key and is the **tonic (I)**.\n    *   The very next chord played is **E minor**. E is the fifth degree of the A major scale, and this is the minor version of that chord, making it the **minor fifth (v)**.\n    *   The intro continues by alternating between these two chords (A -> Em). This pattern perfectly matches the I -> v progression described in the question.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe song \"I'll Be Back\" starts with a distinctive and melancholy chord change, jumping from the tonic A major chord directly to the non-diatonic E minor chord (the minor fifth). This unique harmonic shift is a hallmark of the song's introduction.\n\n<<<I'll Be Back>>>"
