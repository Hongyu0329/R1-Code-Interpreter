    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The question asks for the number of times Anton Chekhov describes the police superintendent Otchumyelov's coat in the short story \"The Chameleon.\" The description can be a direct statement about the coat or an action involving it (putting it on, taking it off).\n\n2.  **Understand the symbolism:** As the question correctly states, the coat is a powerful symbol. When Otchumyelov feels authoritative and aligned with the powerful, he wears his coat. When he is flustered, afraid of making a mistake, or siding with the common folk, he takes it off. His excuses, like being hot or cold, are just pretexts for his rapidly changing mentality.\n\n3.  **Chronological review of the story for mentions of the coat:**\n\n    *   **Instance 1:** At the very beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is introduced.\n        > *\"Police Superintendent Otchumyelov was walking across the market-square. He was wearing a new overcoat...\"*\n        This establishes his initial state of authority.\n\n    *   **Instance 2:** The first shift occurs when someone in the crowd suggests the dog belongs to General Zhigalov. Otchumyelov's authoritative stance crumbles.\n        > *\"‘Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain.’\"*\n        He takes the coat off, symbolizing his sudden fear and shift away from accusing the dog.\n\n    *   **Instance 3:** The policeman, Yeldyrin, states that the dog is not the general's. Otchumyelov's confidence returns.\n        > *\"‘Help me on with my coat, Yeldyrin my friend... there's a wind getting up.... I feel chilly.’\"*\n        He puts the coat back on, reassuming his authoritative posture to condemn the dog.\n\n    *   **Instance 4:** The policeman then speculates that the dog might belong to the General's *brother*. This introduces new uncertainty and fear.\n        > *\"‘Take my coat off, Yeldyrin...’\"*\n        He removes the coat again, as the potential connection to power makes him nervous.\n\n    *   **Instance 5:** The general's cook, Prokhor, arrives. When initially questioned, he says, \"We've never had one of that sort.\" Otchumyelov assumes this means the dog is a stray and his authority is safe.\n        > *\"‘Put my coat on, brother Yeldyrin...’\"*\n        He quickly puts the coat back on, ready to be decisive and punish the dog's owner.\n\n    *   **Instance 6:** Prokhor clarifies that the dog belongs to the general's brother, who has recently arrived in town. The case is closed in favour of the dog.\n        > *\"He wraps himself in his coat and continues on his way across the square.\"*\n        This final action shows him bundling himself in his authority, having successfully navigated the situation by siding with the powerful, and he leaves the scene.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   The question asks how many times the coat is *described*. This includes both static descriptions (\"wearing a new overcoat\") and descriptive actions (\"Help me off with my coat,\" \"wraps himself in his coat\").\n*   Each description or action involving the coat is a deliberate choice by Chekhov to signal a change in Otchumyelov's state of mind.\n*   The excuses Otchumyelov gives for his actions with the coat (heat, wind, chill) are ironic and highlight his lack of integrity. He is a \"chameleon,\" changing to match his environment, and the coat is the most visible sign of his change.\n*   Counting requires a careful reading of the text to identify every single instance, as they happen in quick succession.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBy systematically going through the short story and counting each instance where the coat is mentioned or its state is changed, we find a total of 6 distinct descriptions.\n\n1.  Wearing the coat at the start.\n2.  Taking the coat off.\n3.  Putting the coat on.\n4.  Taking the coat off again.\n5.  Putting the coat on again.\n6.  Wrapping the coat around himself at the end.\n\nThe total number of times Chekov described the coat is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
