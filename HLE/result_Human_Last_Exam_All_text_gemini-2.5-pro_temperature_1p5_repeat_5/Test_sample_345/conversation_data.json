    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key elements of the question:**\n    *   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n    *   **Artwork:** \"The Radionist\" (Original German title: \"Der Radionist\")\n    *   **Year of creation:** 1927\n    *   **Medium:** Tempera\n    *   **Year of acquisition:** 1967\n    *   **Information needed:** The name of the museum that acquired the painting.\n\n2.  **Initial Search and Location:** A search for the painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther consistently points to its location in a major German museum. This museum is the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections).\n\n3.  **Specify the Collection/Gallery:** Within the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, the painting is part of the **Galerie Neue Meister** (New Masters Gallery). This gallery is housed in the **Albertinum** building in Dresden.\n\n4.  **Verify the Acquisition Date:** The crucial part of the question is confirming the acquisition year of 1967. To do this, we must consult the official records or database of the museum itself. The online collection database of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden provides detailed provenance information for its artworks.\n\n5.  **Confirm via Museum Records:** The entry for Kurt Günther's \"Der Radionist\" (Inventory number: Gal.-Nr. 3436) in the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden database explicitly states \"Erworben 1967,\" which translates to \"Acquired in 1967.\"\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Museum vs. Gallery:** The painting is held by the Galerie Neue Meister, which is a specific gallery or collection. This gallery is located within the Albertinum museum building and is part of the larger organization known as the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden. For clarity, \"Galerie Neue Meister, Dresden\" is the most precise answer.\n*   **Language:** The original title is in German (\"Der Radionist\"). Using the original title in searches can often yield more precise results from German museum sources.\n*   **Verification:** It is essential not just to find the painting's current location but to verify the specific detail of the acquisition year (1967) from a reliable source like the museum's own records.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the official records of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, the Galerie Neue Meister acquired the painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther in 1967.\n\n<<<Galerie Neue Meister, Dresden (New Masters Gallery, Dresden)"
