    "This is an excellent question that requires a close reading of the famous didactic poem, *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam*. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the specific range of verses (*abyāt*, singular: *bayt*) in Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi's poem that enumerates the 25 prophets one must know by name in the Ash'ari school of theology.\n\n2.  **Contextual Verses:** Before the list begins, the author sets the stage. It's important to note the verse that introduces the list, as it provides the context and the number of prophets to be named.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The author first establishes the necessary attributes of the prophets (Truthfulness, Trustworthiness, Conveying the Message, and Intelligence) in *bayt* 26.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** The verse that directly precedes the list and announces it is **Bayt 29**. This verse is crucial for context. It says:\n        > وَتَفْصِيْلُهُمْ خَمْسَةٌ وَعِشْرُوْنَ لَزِمْ\n        >\n        > كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n        >\n        *Translation: \"Their detailed list is twenty-five, which is binding upon every accountable person, so verify and take this as a prize.\"*\n        This verse explicitly states that 25 prophets will be named, but it does not contain any of their names. Therefore, the list itself starts in the *next* verse.\n\n3.  **The Beginning of the List:** We now look for the first verse that starts naming the prophets.\n    *   **Bayt 30** begins the enumeration:\n        > هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ\n        >\n        > صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n        >\n        *Translation: \"They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed.\"*\n        This is the **starting point** of the list.\n\n4.  **The Continuation of the List:** The poem continues to list the prophets in the subsequent verses.\n    *   **Bayt 31** names Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n    *   **Bayt 32** names Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n\n5.  **The End of the List:** We need to find the verse where the 25th and final prophet is mentioned.\n    *   **Bayt 33** concludes the list:\n        > إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى\n        >\n        > عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n        >\n        *Translation: \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (a title for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ), the Seal of the Prophets, so leave misguidance.\"*\n        This verse contains the last of the 25 prophets, ending with Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. This is the **ending point** of the list.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** By tracking the verses, we can confirm that the names of the prophets are mentioned starting from **Bayt 30** and ending at **Bayt 33**.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n\n*   Recognize that Bayt 29 is the *introduction* to the list but does not contain any names itself.\n*   Identify Bayt 30 as the actual *start* of the enumeration.\n*   Trace the names through Bayts 31 and 32.\n*   Identify Bayt 33 as the *end* of the list, concluding with the Seal of the Prophets, Muhammad ﷺ.\n*   Verify the count: The verses from 30 to 33 indeed contain a total of 25 names as promised in Bayt 29.\n\nBased on this analysis, the names of the Prophets in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam are mentioned from Bayt 30 to Bayt 33.\n\n<<<From bayt 30 to bayt 33.>>>"
