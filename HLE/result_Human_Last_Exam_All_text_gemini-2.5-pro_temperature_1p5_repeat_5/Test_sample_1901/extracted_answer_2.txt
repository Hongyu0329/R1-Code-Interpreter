The optimal design for a liquid crystal material with a single benzene ring and nematic/smectic phases around room temperature is **4-octylcyanobenzene**.

**General Structure:** CnH2n+1-[Benzene Ring]-CN

**Specific Structure:** C8H17-[Benzene Ring]-CN (where substitution is at the 1 and 4 positions)

**Justification:**
1.  **Core:** A single para-substituted benzene ring provides the required rigid, linear core.
2.  **Functional Groups:** The terminal cyano (-CN) group provides a strong dipole moment to promote molecular alignment, while the flexible octyl (C8H17-) chain lowers the melting point sufficiently to reveal a liquid crystal phase.
3.  **Properties:** 4-octylcyanobenzene (8CB) exhibits both a Smectic A and a Nematic phase. Its transition from a solid crystal occurs at 21.5°C, and it becomes an isotropic liquid at 40.5°C. This temperature range squarely encompasses room temperature, making it an ideal fulfillment of the design requirements. The initial suggestion to use a pentyl (n=5) chain is flawed, as shorter chains in this series do not form stable liquid crystal phases.
