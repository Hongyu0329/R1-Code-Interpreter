    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of the given molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Molecular Structure**\nThe molecule is 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene. Let's break down this name to understand the structure.\n\n*   **Central Core:** The core is a hexasubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   At positions 2, 4, and 6, there are methyl (-CH3) groups.\n    *   At positions 1, 3, and 5, there are `[((...)-yl)methyl]` groups. This corresponds to a -CH2-R substituent, where R is the complex heterocyclic group.\n*   **The R group (Substituent Arm):** The R group is `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`. Let's call this complex chiral group \"Pz*\". It is derived from camphor and is a rigid bicyclic system fused to a pyrazole ring. The `2-yl` indicates it attaches to the linker `-CH2-` group via the nitrogen atom at position 2.\n*   **Overall Structure:** We have a central benzene ring with three -CH3 groups and three -CH2-Pz* groups arranged in an alternating pattern. All three Pz* groups have the same defined stereochemistry (4S,7R).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Symmetry of the Molecule**\nThe molecule has a C3 rotational axis of symmetry passing through the center of the benzene ring. This means that rotating the molecule by 120Â° results in an identical structure.\nThis C3 symmetry has a key consequence for the NMR spectrum:\n*   The three methyl groups (-CH3) at positions 2, 4, and 6 are chemically equivalent.\n*   The three substituent arms (-CH2-Pz*) at positions 1, 3, and 5 are also chemically equivalent.\nTherefore, to find the total number of signals, we can count the number of unique proton environments in one of the -CH3 groups and one of the -CH2-Pz* arms and sum them up.\n\n**Step 3: Count the Signals from the Methyl Groups on the Benzene Ring**\n*   The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry.\n*   All 9 protons of these three groups will produce a single resonance.\n*   **Number of signals = 1**\n\n**Step 4: Count the Signals from one -CH2-Pz* Arm**\nWe need to analyze the proton environments within one of the three identical -CH2-Pz* arms. This arm consists of a linker (-CH2-) and the Pz* group.\n\n*   **Linker (-CH2-) Protons:**\n    *   This CH2 group is attached to the achiral benzene ring on one side and the chiral Pz* group on the other.\n    *   Protons on a methylene group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic. This means they are in chemically different environments and will have different chemical shifts.\n    *   Therefore, the two protons of the CH2 linker will give rise to two separate signals (likely an AB quartet).\n    *   **Number of signals from -CH2- = 2**\n\n*   **Pz* Group Protons:**\n    *   The Pz* group is a rigid, chiral structure based on a camphor skeleton. We must identify all the chemically non-equivalent protons within it.\n    *   **H3 proton:** There is one proton on the pyrazole part of the indazole system. It is in a unique electronic environment. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **H4 proton:** This is a bridgehead proton (a CH group) on the bicyclic frame. It is unique. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **H5 protons:** This is a methylene (-CH2-) group. Due to the rigid, asymmetric (chiral) nature of the bicyclic system, the two protons (often labeled exo and endo) are diastereotopic. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **H6 protons:** This is another methylene (-CH2-) group. For the same reason as H5, its two protons are also diastereotopic. Furthermore, the C6 group is in a different environment than the C5 group (C6 is adjacent to the C7-Me bridgehead, while C5 is adjacent to the C4-H bridgehead). Therefore, the protons of C6 are distinct from those of C5. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **7-methyl group:** There is a single methyl group on the C7 bridgehead. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **8,8-dimethyl group:** There is a gem-dimethyl group on the C8 methano bridge. Due to the asymmetry of the overall bicyclic framework, these two methyl groups are diastereotopic (one is *syn* and one is *anti* with respect to the pyrazole ring). They are chemically non-equivalent. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **Total signals from one Pz* group = 1 (H3) + 1 (H4) + 2 (H5) + 2 (H6) + 1 (Me7) + 2 (Me8) = 9 signals.**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Signals**\nThe total number of expected peaks is the sum of the signals from all unique parts of the molecule.\n*   Signals from the three Ar-CH3 groups = 1\n*   Signals from one -CH2-Pz* arm = (Signals from -CH2-) + (Signals from Pz*) = 2 + 9 = 11\n\n*   Total Signals = (Signals from Ar-CH3 groups) + (Signals from one -CH2-Pz* arm)\n*   Total Signals = 1 + 11 = 12\n\nTherefore, we expect a total of 12 distinct signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nFinal breakdown of the 12 signals:\n1.  Ar-CH3 (9H)\n2.  Ar-CHa-N (3H, one of the diastereotopic protons)\n3.  Ar-CHb-N (3H, the other diastereotopic proton)\n4.  Pz*-H3 (3H)\n5.  Pz*-H4 (3H)\n6.  Pz*-H5a (3H)\n7.  Pz*-H5b (3H)\n8.  Pz*-H6a (3H)\n9.  Pz*-H6b (3H)\n10. Pz*-Me7 (9H)\n11. Pz*-Me8syn (9H)\n12. Pz*-Me8anti (9H)\n\n<<<H>>>"
