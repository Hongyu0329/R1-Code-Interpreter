The product is a bicyclic ketone formed through an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement. The original bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton rearranges into a fused bicyclo[7.3.0]dodecane skeleton, which consists of a nine-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. The original tertiary alcohol is converted to a ketone. The silyl ether and dimethoxy ketal functional groups remain intact.
