    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to derive the analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$.\n\n**1. Analyze the integral and the integrand**\nThe integral is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\nLet $g(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. The integral is $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + g(x)} dx$.\nWe are interested in the behavior for small positive $\\epsilon$.\n\nThe function $g(x)$ is zero at $x=0$ and positive for $x>0$. For small $\\epsilon$, the denominator $\\epsilon + g(x)$ becomes very small when $x$ is close to 0. This means the integrand becomes very large near $x=0$, and this region will give the dominant contribution to the integral. The integral is a classic example of a singular perturbation problem.\n\n**2. Develop the approximation strategy**\nSince the main contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$, we can approximate $g(x)$ by its behavior for small $x$. The Taylor expansion of $g(x)$ around $x=0$ is $g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$. For small $x$, the term $9x^5$ is dominant.\n\nThe standard method for this type of integral is to:\na. Approximate the integral by focusing on the behavior of the integrand near the point where the unperturbed denominator vanishes (i.e., $x=0$).\nb. Extend the integration limit from $15.0$ to $\\infty$. The error introduced by this is small and contributes to lower-order terms in the asymptotic expansion, as the integrand decays rapidly for large $x$.\nc. Approximate the integrand by expanding it in terms of the smaller parts of $g(x)$.\n\n**3. Derivation of the leading term**\nThe leading term of the asymptotic expansion is obtained by keeping only the most dominant part of $g(x)$ near $x=0$, which is $9x^5$.\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx I_0(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$.\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we make a substitution. Let $u^5 = \\frac{9x^5}{\\epsilon}$, so $x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} u$. Then $dx = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} du$.\n$I_0(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon u^5} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} du = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du$\n$I_0(\\epsilon) = \\epsilon^{-4/5} 9^{-1/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du$.\nThe integral is a standard one, related to the Beta function, with the value $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^p} du = \\frac{\\pi/p}{\\sin(\\pi/p)}$. For $p=5$, this is $\\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\nSo, the leading term is:\n$I_0(\\epsilon) = 9^{-1/5} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)} = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$.\n\n**4. Derivation of the second term (first correction)**\nThe next term in the approximation comes from including the next term in $g(x)$, which is $5x^6$. We can write:\n$\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5 + 5x^6 + \\dots} = \\frac{1}{(\\epsilon+9x^5)(1 + \\frac{5x^6}{\\epsilon+9x^5} + \\dots)} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\epsilon+9x^5}\\left(1 - \\frac{5x^6}{\\epsilon+9x^5}\\right)$.\nThe correction term to the integral, $I_1(\\epsilon)$, is:\n$I_1(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{\\infty} -\\frac{5x^6}{(\\epsilon+9x^5)^2} dx$.\n\nWe use the same substitution as before: $x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} u$.\n$I_1(\\epsilon) = -5 \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\left[ (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} u \\right]^6}{\\left( \\epsilon + 9 \\left[ (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} u \\right]^5 \\right)^2} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} du$\n$I_1(\\epsilon) = -5 \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\epsilon/9)^{6/5} u^6}{(\\epsilon(1+u^5))^2} (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} du = -5 \\cdot 9^{-7/5} \\epsilon^{7/5} \\epsilon^{-2} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^6}{(1+u^5)^2} du$\n$I_1(\\epsilon) = -5 \\cdot 9^{-7/5} \\epsilon^{-3/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^6}{(1+u^5)^2} du$.\n\nTo evaluate the integral, let $v=u^5$, so $u=v^{1/5}$ and $du = \\frac{1}{5}v^{-4/5}dv$.\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^6}{(1+u^5)^2} du = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{v^{6/5}}{(1+v)^2} \\frac{1}{5}v^{-4/5} dv = \\frac{1}{5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{v^{2/5}}{(1+v)^2} dv$.\nThis integral can be solved using integration by parts and the Beta function:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{v^a}{(1+v)^2} dv = a B(a, 1-a) = a \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi a)}$.\nFor $a=2/5$, the integral is $\\frac{2}{5}\\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(2\\pi/5)}$.\nSo, $\\frac{1}{5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{v^{2/5}}{(1+v)^2} dv = \\frac{1}{5} \\left( \\frac{2}{5}\\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(2\\pi/5)} \\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{25\\sin(2\\pi/5)}$.\n\nThe correction term is:\n$I_1(\\epsilon) = -5 \\cdot 9^{-7/5} \\epsilon^{-3/5} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{25\\sin(2\\pi/5)} \\right) = -\\frac{10\\pi}{25} 9^{-7/5} \\frac{\\epsilon^{-3/5}}{\\sin(2\\pi/5)} = -\\frac{2\\pi}{5 \\sin(2\\pi/5)} 9^{-7/5} \\epsilon^{-3/5}$.\n\n**5. Final Analytical Formula**\nCombining the leading term and the first correction gives a two-term asymptotic formula for $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx I_0(\\epsilon) + I_1(\\epsilon)$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5} - \\frac{2\\pi}{5 \\sin(2\\pi/5)} (9.0)^{-7/5} \\epsilon^{-3/5}$.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Singularity:** The crucial observation is that for $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the integrand develops a non-integrable singularity at $x=0$. The parameter $\\epsilon$ regularizes this singularity, and the value of the integral depends strongly on $\\epsilon$.\n2.  **Dominant Contribution:** The dominant contribution to the integral comes from a very small region near $x=0$, which justifies approximating the function $g(x)$ by its leading term(s) near $x=0$.\n3.  **Integration Limit:** The upper limit of integration (15.00) can be extended to infinity. This is because the contribution from the tail end of the integral ($x > 15$) is a very small constant that does not depend on $\\epsilon$ at leading orders and thus does not affect the singular terms (terms with fractional powers of $\\epsilon$).\n4.  **Asymptotic Series:** The resulting approximation is the first two terms of an asymptotic series in fractional powers of $\\epsilon$. Higher-order terms can be derived by including more terms from $g(x)$ (like $9x^8$) and higher-order terms in the expansion of the fraction.\n5.  **Coefficients:** The coefficients of the expansion depend on the coefficients of the polynomial $g(x)$ (here, 9.0 and 5.0) and involve mathematical constants ($\\pi$) and trigonometric functions of rational multiples of $\\pi$.\n\nThe final answer is the derived two-term formula.\n\n<<<\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 (9.0)^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5} - \\frac{2\\pi}{5 \\sin(2\\pi/5)} (9.0)^{-7/5} \\epsilon^{-3/5}$\n>>>"
