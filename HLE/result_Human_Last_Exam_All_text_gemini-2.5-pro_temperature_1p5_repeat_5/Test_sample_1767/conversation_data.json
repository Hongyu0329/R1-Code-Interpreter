    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Building Blocks: Chern Insulators**\n\n*   A Chern insulator is a two-dimensional (2D) topological material that is an electrical insulator in its bulk but conducts electricity along its edges.\n*   This property is characterized by a topological invariant called the **Chern number (C)**, which is an integer.\n*   The **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence** is a fundamental principle connecting the bulk topology to the edge properties. It states that a Chern insulator with Chern number $C$ will host $|C|$ chiral (one-way) conducting edge states on its boundary.\n*   The sign of the Chern number determines the direction of propagation (chirality) of these edge states. For example, we can define $C=+1$ to correspond to a clockwise propagation of charge around the insulator's boundary and $C=-1$ to correspond to a counter-clockwise propagation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Initial Systems**\n\n*   We start with two separate Chern insulators, let's call them Insulator A and Insulator B.\n*   Both are given to have a Chern number of 1. So, $C_A = 1$ and $C_B = 1$.\n*   According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, both Insulator A and Insulator B have one chiral edge state propagating along their respective boundaries. Since their Chern numbers are the same, these edge states have the same chirality (e.g., both are clockwise).\n\n**3. Model the Junction**\n\n*   The two insulators are connected \"laterally\" (side-by-side). Let's imagine placing Insulator A on the left and Insulator B on the right.\n*   The boundary where they meet forms the \"junction\". This junction is the right edge of Insulator A and the left edge of Insulator B.\n*   The combined system (A + B) is now a new, larger 2D system.\n\n**4. Analyze the Edge States at the Junction**\n\n*   Let's trace the clockwise edge state of Insulator A. On its right boundary (at the junction), the state will be propagating downwards.\n*   Now let's trace the clockwise edge state of Insulator B. On its left boundary (at the junction), the state will be propagating upwards.\n*   Therefore, at the interface between the two insulators, we have two edge states propagating in opposite directions: one moving down (from A) and one moving up (from B).\n\n**5. Consider the \"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\"**\n\n*   This condition is crucial. It means that the two counter-propagating edge states at the junction can interact and couple with each other.\n*   When a right-moving state and a left-moving state (or in this case, an up-moving and a down-moving state) exist at the same location and can interact, they can hybridize. This hybridization typically opens an energy gap, causing the states to \"annihilate\" each other.\n*   As a result, the junction itself becomes gapped and insulating, just like the bulk of the individual insulators. The junction is now effectively part of the bulk of the new composite system.\n\n**6. Analyze the New Composite System**\n\n*   Now we must consider the entire A+B system as a single entity and look at its *outer* boundaries.\n*   **Outer Top Edge:** The top edge of Insulator A had a right-moving state. The top edge of Insulator B also had a right-moving state. When joined, these two states now both exist on the top edge of the new, larger system. We now have **two** co-propagating edge states moving to the right.\n*   **Outer Bottom Edge:** Similarly, the bottom edges of A and B both had left-moving states. The new composite system therefore has **two** co-propagating edge states moving to the left on its bottom boundary.\n*   By the bulk-boundary correspondence, a system that supports two chiral edge states on its boundary must have a bulk Chern number of $C=2$.\n\n**7. Confirmation using the Additivity of Chern Numbers**\n\n*   A more direct and formal way to find the Chern number of a composite system is to use the principle of additivity. The Chern number, being a topological invariant derived from integrating the Berry curvature over the Brillouin zone, is additive.\n*   For a composite system formed by joining two systems (without breaking fundamental symmetries), the total Chern number is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n*   $C_{total} = C_A + C_B$\n*   $C_{total} = 1 + 1 = 2$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Meaning of \"Junction\":** The question asks for the Chern number \"of this junction\". This refers to the Chern number of the new, larger material formed by the junction. The interface itself becomes insulating (gapped), and the topological property (the Chern number) is a characteristic of the entire 2D bulk.\n2.  **Same Chirality:** The result depends critically on both insulators having the same sign for their Chern number ($C=1$ and $C=1$). If one had $C=1$ and the other had $C=-1$, the total Chern number would be $C = 1 + (-1) = 0$, and the system would be a trivial insulator.\n3.  **Interaction:** The \"negligible tunneling barrier\" is essential for the counter-propagating states at the interface to annihilate and make the interface insulating.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBoth the physical picture of edge state counting and the formal rule of additivity lead to the same conclusion. The Chern number of the composite system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\n$C_{total} = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n<<<2>>>"
