    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n**The System of Differential Equations**\n\nWe are given the system:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n2.  $u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nLet's write this as:\n$d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^4 - u^3$\n$u' = u^3 - u^2$\n\nWe consider the phase plane for $u \\ge 0$.\n\n**Step 1: Find the Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points $(d, u)$ are found by setting $d' = 0$ and $u' = 0$.\n\nFrom $u' = 0$:\n$u^2(u-1) = 0 \\implies u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\nNow, we substitute these values of $u$ into the equation for $d'$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (0 - 0)d + 0 - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\n    So, one equilibrium point is **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d + 1^4 - 1^3 = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d + 1 - 1 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1) = 0$.\n    This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, two more equilibrium points are **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\nThe equilibrium points are (0, 0), (0, 1), and (-1, 1).\n\n**Step 2: Linearize the System and Classify the Equilibrium Points**\n\nTo understand the behavior of trajectories near the equilibrium points, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system.\nLet $F(d,u) = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^4 - u^3$ and $G(d,u) = u^3 - u^2$.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix $J(d,u)$ is:\n$J(d,u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d + 5u^2 - 3u & (10u - 3)d + 4u^3 - 3u^2 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at each equilibrium point.\n\n*   **At (0, 1):**\n    $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) & (10(1) - 3)(0) + 4(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both are positive, **(0, 1) is an unstable node (a source)**.\n\n*   **At (-1, 1):**\n    $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) & (10(1) - 3)(-1) + 4(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -4 + 2 & -7 + 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since one is positive and one is negative, **(-1, 1) is a saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Linearization is inconclusive. This is a non-hyperbolic fixed point.\n\n**Step 3: Understand and Find the Separatrix**\n\nA separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different qualitative behavior. Separatrices are typically the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points. Since we have a saddle point at (-1, 1), its stable and unstable manifolds will be separatrices.\n\nLet's find the invariant curves passing through the saddle point (-1, 1). An invariant curve is a trajectory of the system.\n\nLet's test if a simple algebraic curve of the form $d=f(u)$ can be an invariant curve. For it to pass through the saddle point (-1, 1), we must have $f(1) = -1$.\nLet's try a simple polynomial form. Let's test $d = -u^2$.\n*   This curve passes through (-1, 1), since $-1 = -(1)^2$.\n*   It also passes through (0, 0), since $0 = -(0)^2$.\n\nNow, we must verify if $d=-u^2$ is an actual trajectory (an invariant curve) of the system. If it is, then the relation $d(t) = -u(t)^2$ must be preserved over time. We can check this by substituting $d=-u^2$ into the first differential equation and see if it is consistent with the second.\n\nIf $d = -u^2$, then using the chain rule, its time derivative is $d' = -2u u'$.\nNow we substitute $d=-u^2$ into the RHS of the first ODE:\n$2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^4 - u^3 = 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(-u^2) + u^4 - u^3$\n$= 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3$\n$= (-2u^4 + 3u^3 - u^3)$\n$= -2u^4 + 2u^3$\n\nNow let's evaluate the LHS, $d' = -2uu'$. From the second ODE, we have $u' = u^3 - u^2$.\n$d' = -2u(u^3 - u^2) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nSince the LHS equals the RHS, the curve $d = -u^2$ is indeed an invariant manifold of the system.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have found an invariant curve, $d = -u^2$, that passes through the saddle point (-1, 1). An invariant curve that contains a saddle point is a separatrix. Specifically, this curve is the unstable manifold of the saddle point. It is an orbit that connects the saddle point (-1, 1) to the equilibrium point (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the equation for the separatrix is $d = -u^2$.\n\nFinal check on careful points:\n1.  Correctly identified all equilibrium points.\n2.  Correctly classified the hyperbolic equilibrium points using the Jacobian matrix. Identified the saddle point at (-1, 1).\n3.  Understood that the separatrix is likely an invariant manifold associated with the saddle point.\n4.  Posited a candidate curve $d=-u^2$ that passes through the saddle point.\n5.  Rigorously verified that $d=-u^2$ is an invariant manifold by showing it satisfies the system's differential equations.\n6.  Concluded that this invariant manifold is the separatrix.\n\nThe separatrix is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
