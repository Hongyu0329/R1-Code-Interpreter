The optimal combination is a single-site catalyst comprising the **Zirconium (Zr)** metal center, stabilized by two **pentamethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp*)** ligands, and supported on **sulfated alumina (Al₂O₃-SO₄)**. This system is typically prepared by reacting the `(Cp*)₂Zr(CH₃)₂` precursor with the support.
