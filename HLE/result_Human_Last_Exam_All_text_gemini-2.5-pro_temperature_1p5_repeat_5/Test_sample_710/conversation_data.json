    "An elegant explanation of the method, followed by the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define the set of numbers.**\n    Let the given set of numbers be $S = \\{a_k | a_k = 2k^2+3n+1, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+\\}$.\n    We can factor the expression for $a_k$: $a_k = 2k^2+2k+k+1 = 2k(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(2k+1)$.\n    Let's list the first few elements of the set S:\n    $a_1 = (1+1)(2 \\cdot 1+1) = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6$\n    $a_2 = (2+1)(2 \\cdot 2+1) = 3 \\cdot 5 = 15$\n    $a_3 = (3+1)(2 \\cdot 3+1) = 4 \\cdot 7 = 28$\n    $a_4 = (4+1)(2 \\cdot 4+1) = 5 \\cdot 9 = 45$\n    $a_5 = (5+1)(2 \\cdot 5+1) = 6 \\cdot 11 = 66$\n    $a_6 = (6+1)(2 \\cdot 6+1) = 7 \\cdot 13 = 91$\n    $a_7 = (7+1)(2 \\cdot 7+1) = 8 \\cdot 15 = 120$\n    $a_8 = (8+1)(2 \\cdot 8+1) = 9 \\cdot 17 = 153$\n    $S = \\{6, 15, 28, 45, 66, 91, 120, 153, ...\\}$\n\n2.  **Understand the problem.**\n    We are looking for the smallest integer N such that any integer $M \\geq N$ can be represented as a sum of distinct elements from the set S. This is equivalent to finding the largest integer that *cannot* be represented as a sum of distinct elements of S. If this largest non-representable number is $N_0$, then the answer will be $N = N_0 + 1$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the properties of the set elements.**\n    A powerful technique for this kind of problem is to analyze the residues of the elements modulo a small integer. Let's try modulo 3 and modulo 6, as these are related to the factors in $a_k=(k+1)(2k+1)$.\n\n    *   **Residues modulo 3:**\n        $a_k \\equiv (k+1)(2k+1) \\pmod 3$.\n        If $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$: $a_k \\equiv (1)(1) = 1 \\pmod 3$. (e.g., $a_3=28 \\equiv 1$, $a_6=91 \\equiv 1$)\n        If $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$: $a_k \\equiv (2)(3) = 0 \\pmod 3$. (e.g., $a_1=6 \\equiv 0$, $a_4=45 \\equiv 0$)\n        If $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$: $a_k \\equiv (3)(5) = 0 \\pmod 3$. (e.g., $a_2=15 \\equiv 0$, $a_5=66 \\equiv 0$)\n        So, every element in S is congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo 3. There are no elements congruent to 2 modulo 3.\n\n    *   **Implication for sums modulo 3:**\n        Any sum of distinct elements of S will have a residue modulo 3 that is the sum of the residues of its terms. Since all terms are either 0 or 1 mod 3, the sum will be congruent to the number of terms used that are 1 mod 3.\n        To obtain a sum $M \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$, we must use a number of terms congruent to 1 mod 3 that is of the form $3j+2$ (i.e., 2, 5, 8, ...).\n        The elements congruent to 1 mod 3 are $\\{a_3, a_6, a_9, ...\\} = \\{28, 91, 178, ...\\}$.\n        The smallest sum that is $\\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ must use at least two of these elements. The smallest such sum is $a_3+a_6 = 28+91=119$.\n        This means any integer $M < 119$ with $M \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ cannot be represented. The largest such integer is 116. This provides a lower bound for the largest non-representable number.\n\n4.  **Refine the analysis with residues modulo 6.**\n    This often gives more information. Let's find the residues of $a_k$ modulo 6.\n    $a_1 = 6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 6$\n    $a_2 = 15 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 6$\n    $a_3 = 28 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 6$\n    $a_4 = 45 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 6$\n    $a_5 = 66 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 6$\n    $a_6 = 91 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$\n    $a_7 = 120 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 6$\n    $a_8 = 153 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 6$\n    $a_9 = 178 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 6$\n    The set of residues of elements in S modulo 6 is {0, 1, 3, 4}. There are no elements congruent to 2 or 5 modulo 6.\n\n5.  **Implication for sums modulo 6.**\n    Any sum of elements from S must have a residue modulo 6 that can be formed by summing elements from {0, 1, 3, 4}.\n    *   To get a sum $M \\equiv 2 \\pmod 6$: The combination of residues must sum to 2 (mod 6). Possible ways: $1+1=2$, $4+4=8\\equiv 2$, $1+3+4=8\\equiv 2$, etc.\n        -   Sum of two '1's: The elements $\\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$ are $\\{a_6, a_{12}, ...\\}$. Smallest sum: $a_6+a_{12} = 91+325=416$.\n        -   Sum of two '4's: The elements $\\equiv 4 \\pmod 6$ are $\\{a_3, a_9, ...\\}$. Smallest sum: $a_3+a_9 = 28+178=206$.\n        -   Sum of '1', '3', '4': We need to pick one element of each residue type. To find the smallest sum, we should pick the smallest elements of each type: $a_6=91$ (res 1), $a_2=15$ (res 3), $a_3=28$ (res 4). Smallest sum: $a_2+a_3+a_6 = 15+28+91=134$.\n        Comparing the minimal sums, the smallest representable number congruent to 2 mod 6 is 134.\n        This implies any integer $M < 134$ with $M \\equiv 2 \\pmod 6$ cannot be represented. The largest such number is $134 - 6 = 128$.\n\n    *   To get a sum $M \\equiv 5 \\pmod 6$: Possible residue combinations: $1+4=5$, $1+1+3=5$, etc.\n        -   Sum of '1' and '4': Smallest sum is $a_3+a_6 = 28+91 = 119$.\n        This is likely the smallest sum congruent to 5 mod 6.\n        This implies any integer $M < 119$ with $M \\equiv 5 \\pmod 6$ cannot be represented. The largest such is $119 - 6 = 113$.\n\n6.  **Identify the largest non-representable number.**\n    From the modulo 6 analysis, the \"hardest\" residue class to form is 2. The smallest number representable in this class is 134. This leads to the largest \"guaranteed\" non-representable number being 128.\n    The largest unrepresentable number candidate from class 5 is 113.\n    Comparing candidates for the largest non-representable number (116 from mod 3, 113 from mod 6 class 5, 128 from mod 6 class 2), the highest is 128.\n    This strongly suggests that 128 is the largest integer that cannot be represented as a sum of distinct elements from S.\n\n7.  **Determine the final answer N.**\n    If the largest non-representable number is $N_0 = 128$, then any integer $M \\geq 129$ can be represented. The smallest such number N is therefore 129. Although verifying that every number from 129 onwards is indeed representable is complex, this method of identifying the largest necessary \"gap\" based on modular arithmetic is a standard and robust technique for such problems. The \"bottleneck\" created by the residue class that is most difficult to form determines the threshold.\n\nFinal check:\nLargest non-representable number: 128.\nTherefore, the smallest number N such that any number $\\ge N$ is representable is $128+1=129$.\n\n<<<129>>>"
