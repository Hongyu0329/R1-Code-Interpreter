    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Terminology**\n\n*   **Nanocar:** This refers to a single-molecule vehicle, a type of molecular machine. It is designed with a chassis-like body and wheel-like structures that allow it to \"roll\" across a surface. The term is not for one specific molecule but a class of molecules.\n*   **Perfluoro-:** This is a standard chemical prefix. It signifies that all hydrogen (H) atoms in the original hydrocarbon molecule have been replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.\n*   **Hypothetically:** This indicates that \"perfluoronanocar\" is not a known, synthesized molecule. We must base our analysis on a known structure of a regular (hydrocarbon-based) nanocar.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Representative Nanocar Structure**\n\nSince \"nanocar\" can refer to several different molecular designs, we need to select a well-defined and representative example. A strong candidate is the **\"Bobcat Nanowagon\"** developed by the team at Ohio University. This molecule is an excellent choice because:\n1.  It was a competitor in the first-ever Nanocar Race in 2017, making it a famous and well-documented example.\n2.  Its structure is composed entirely of carbon and hydrogen, making the concept of \"perfluorination\" straightforward.\n3.  It has a clear \"chassis\" and four \"wheels,\" fitting the description perfectly.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Chemical Structure and Formula of the Parent Nanocar**\n\nThe chemical name of the Bobcat Nanowagon is **4,5,11,12-tetrakis(p-tolyl)dibenzo[g,p]chrysene**. Let's break this down to find the number of hydrogen atoms.\n\n1.  **The Chassis:** The core of the molecule is **dibenzo[g,p]chrysene**.\n    *   This is a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH).\n    *   By looking up its established chemical formula, we find it is **C₃₀H₁₈**. So, the isolated chassis has 30 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\n2.  **The Wheels:** The \"wheels\" are four **p-tolyl** groups.\n    *   A tolyl group is a toluene molecule (a benzene ring with a methyl group, -CH₃) acting as a substituent.\n    *   Its formula is -C₆H₄CH₃.\n    *   Let's count the hydrogens on one `p-tolyl` group: 4 on the benzene ring and 3 on the methyl group, for a total of **7 hydrogens** per wheel.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Nanocar:** The four `p-tolyl` groups are attached to the chassis at positions 4, 5, 11, and 12. Each attachment replaces one hydrogen atom on the dibenzo[g,p]chrysene chassis.\n    *   Hydrogen atoms removed from the chassis = 4.\n    *   Hydrogen atoms remaining on the chassis = 18 - 4 = 14.\n    *   Hydrogen atoms added by the four `p-tolyl` wheels = 4 wheels × 7 hydrogens/wheel = 28.\n\n4.  **Total Hydrogen Count:** The total number of hydrogen atoms in one Bobcat Nanowagon molecule is the sum of the hydrogens on the modified chassis and the hydrogens on the wheels.\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 14 (from chassis) + 28 (from wheels) = **42**.\n    *   (For completeness, the full chemical formula of the parent hydrocarbon is C₅₈H₄₂).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Number of Fluorine Atoms in the Perfluoronanocar**\n\nThe prefix \"perfluoro-\" means we must replace every hydrogen atom with a fluorine atom.\n\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in the parent nanocar = 42.\n*   Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in the hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar\" would also be **42**. The formula would be C₅₈F₄₂.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of a well-defined and representative nanocar molecule (the Bobcat Nanowagon), a hypothetical perfluorinated version would contain 42 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<42>>>"
