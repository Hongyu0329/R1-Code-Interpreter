    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to design the deadbeat observer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\n\nThe problem asks for the design of a full-state observer for a discrete-time system:\nx(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nThe observer has the form:\nx̂(k + 1) = Ax̂(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - ŷ(k))\n\nwhere L is the observer gain matrix. The state observation error is e(k) = x(k) - x̂(k), and its dynamics are governed by:\ne(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)\n\nA \"deadbeat\" observer is one where the observation error e(k) becomes identically zero in the shortest possible number of steps. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues of the observer error matrix (A - LC) at the origin, i.e., making (A - LC) a nilpotent matrix. The shortest time is determined by the observability index `ν` of the pair (A, C), such that `(A - LC)^ν = 0`.\n\n**Step 2: System Matrices**\n\nThe given matrices are:\nA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]]\nB = [[0], [1], [-1], [1]]\nC = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]\n\nThe state dimension is n = 4, and the output dimension is p = 2.\n\n**Step 3: Check Observability**\n\nFor a deadbeat observer to exist, the system `(A, C)` must be observable. The observability matrix is `O = [C^T; (CA)^T; (CA^2)^T; (CA^3)^T]`. The system is observable if `rank(O) = n = 4`. The observability index `ν` is the smallest integer such that the rank of the truncated observability matrix `O_ν = [C^T; ...; (CA^(ν-1))^T]` is `n`.\nCalculating the rank reveals that the system is observable with an observability index `ν = 3`. This means the error can be made zero in 3 steps.\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the Problem using Output Transformation**\n\nDirectly calculating `L` can be complicated. We can simplify the problem by noticing the structure of the `C` matrix. Let the outputs be `y1(k)` and `y2(k)`.\ny1(k) = x1(k)\ny2(k) = x1(k) + x4(k)\n\nFrom this, we can compute `x1(k)` and `x4(k)` directly from the outputs:\nx1(k) = y1(k)\nx4(k) = y2(k) - y1(k)\n\nThis suggests a change of output coordinates. Let `y'(k) = T * y(k)`, where\nT = [[1, 0], [-1, 1]]\ny'(k) = [[y1(k)], [y2(k)-y1(k)]] = [[x1(k)], [x4(k)]]\n\nThe new output equation is `y'(k) = C'x(k)`, where the new output matrix `C'` is:\nC' = T * C = [[1, 0], [-1, 1]] * [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]] = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]]\n\nWe can design an observer for the system `(A, C')` with a gain `L'` and then relate it back to the original gain `L`. The observer equation with the new output is:\nx̂(k+1) = Ax̂(k) + Bu(k) + L'(y'(k) - C'x̂(k))\nx̂(k+1) = Ax̂(k) + Bu(k) + L'T(y(k) - Cx̂(k))\nComparing this to the original observer form, we see that `L = L'T`.\n\n**Step 5: Design the Observer Gain L' for the Simplified System**\n\nWe need to find a gain matrix `L'` such that the eigenvalues of `(A - L'C')` are all zero. The characteristic polynomial should be `det(λI - (A - L'C')) = λ^4`.\nLet `L'` be a 4x2 matrix:\nL' = [[l1, l2], [l3, l4], [l5, l6], [l7, l8]]\n\nThen `L'C'` is:\nL'C' = [[l1, l2], [l3, l4], [l5, l6], [l7, l8]] * [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]] = [[l1, 0, 0, l2], [l3, 0, 0, l4], [l5, 0, 0, l6], [l7, 0, 0, l8]]\n\nThe matrix `(A - L'C')` is:\nA - L'C' = [[-1-l1, 0, 0, 1-l2], [1-l3, 0, 0, 2-l4], [-l5, 1, 0, -1-l6], [-1-l7, 0, 1, -1-l8]]\n\nThe characteristic polynomial `det(λI - (A + L'C'))` can be computed. Equating its coefficients to the coefficients of the desired polynomial `λ^4` (which are all zero except for the `λ^4` term) yields a system of equations for `l1, ..., l8`:\n1.  `l1 + l8 + 2 = 0`\n2.  `l1 + l6 + l8 + l1*l8 + 2 = 0`\n3.  `(1 + l1)(1 + l6) - l5(l2 - 1) + l4 - 2 = 0`\n4.  `(1 + l1)(l4 - 2) - (l2 - 1)(l3 - 1) = 0`\n\nNote that `l7` does not appear in these equations, so it can be chosen arbitrarily. We set `l7 = 0`.\nThis is an underdetermined system. We can find a simple solution by setting some variables.\nLet `l1 = 0`.\nFrom (1): `l8 = -2`.\nFrom (2): `0 + l6 - 2 + 0 + 2 = 0` => `l6 = 0`.\nThe equations (3) and (4) become:\n3. `(1)(1) - l5(l2 - 1) + l4 - 2 = 0` => `l5(l2 - 1) - l4 = -1`\n4. `(1)(l4 - 2) - (l2 - 1)(l3 - 1) = 0` => `l4 - 2 = (l2 - 1)(l3 - 1)`\n\nAgain, we have choices. Let `l5 = 0`.\nFrom (3): `-l4 = -1` => `l4 = 1`.\nSubstitute `l4 = 1` into (4):\n`1 - 2 = (l2 - 1)(l3 - 1)` => `-1 = (l2 - 1)(l3 - 1)`\nChoose `l2 = 2`. Then `-1 = (1)(l3 - 1)` => `l3 - 1 = -1` => `l3 = 0`.\n\nSo, one possible solution is:\n`l1=0, l2=2, l3=0, l4=1, l5=0, l6=0, l7=0, l8=-2`\nThis gives the gain matrix `L'`:\nL' = [[0, 2], [0, 1], [0, 0], [0, -2]]\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Gain Matrix L**\n\nNow we transform `L'` back to the original `L` using the relation `L = L'T`:\nL = L' * T = [[0, 2], [0, 1], [0, 0], [0, -2]] * [[1, 0], [-1, 1]]\nL = [[0*1 + 2*(-1), 0*0 + 2*1],\n     [0*1 + 1*(-1), 0*0 + 1*1],\n     [0*1 + 0*(-1), 0*0 + 0*1],\n     [0*1 + (-2)*(-1), 0*0 + (-2)*1]]\n\nL = [[-2, 2], [-1, 1], [0, 0], [2, -2]]\n\nThis is the gain matrix for the deadbeat observer.\n\n<<<[[-2, 2], [-1, 1], [0, 0], [2, -2]]>>>"
