The second player has a winning strategy if and only if the number of tokens `T` is a member of the Fibonacci sequence. Using the standard definition for this problem (`F_1=1, F_2=2, F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}`), the values of `T` for which the second player wins are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ... and so on.
