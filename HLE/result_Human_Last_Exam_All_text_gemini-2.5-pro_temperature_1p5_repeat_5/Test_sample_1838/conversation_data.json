    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the central pixel of the line using Bresenham's line algorithm.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Input Line**\n\n*   Start point (x₁, y₁) = (1, 1)\n*   End point (x₂, y₂) = (11, 5)\n*   Calculate the change in x and y (delta x and delta y):\n    *   dx = x₂ - x₁ = 11 - 1 = 10\n    *   dy = y₂ - y₁ = 5 - 1 = 4\n*   Determine the slope:\n    *   The slope `m = dy / dx = 4 / 10 = 0.4`.\n    *   Since `0 < m < 1`, the x-coordinate will be incremented by 1 at each step, and we will use the Bresenham algorithm to decide whether to increment the y-coordinate.\n\n**Step 2: Initialize Bresenham's Algorithm**\n\n*   The first pixel is the starting point (1, 1).\n*   The decision parameter `P` is initialized. The formula for this case is `P = 2*dy - dx`.\n    *   `P = 2 * 4 - 10 = 8 - 10 = -2`.\n*   The update rules for the decision parameter `P` are:\n    *   If `P < 0`, the next point is (x+1, y), and `P` is updated by `P = P + 2*dy`.\n    *   If `P ≥ 0`, the next point is (x+1, y+1), and `P` is updated by `P = P + 2*dy - 2*dx`.\n\n**Step 3: Generate All Pixels on the Line**\n\nWe start at (1, 1) and iterate `dx = 10` times to find the subsequent pixels.\n\n*   **Pixel 1:** (1, 1). `P = -2`.\n*   **Iteration 1:** Since `P < 0`, y does not change. Next pixel is (2, 1).\n    *   Update `P`: `P = -2 + 2*4 = 6`.\n    *   **Pixel 2:** (2, 1).\n*   **Iteration 2:** Since `P ≥ 0`, y is incremented. Next pixel is (3, 2).\n    *   Update `P`: `P = 6 + 2*4 - 2*10 = 6 + 8 - 20 = -6`.\n    *   **Pixel 3:** (3, 2).\n*   **Iteration 3:** Since `P < 0`, y does not change. Next pixel is (4, 2).\n    *   Update `P`: `P = -6 + 2*4 = 2`.\n    *   **Pixel 4:** (4, 2).\n*   **Iteration 4:** Since `P ≥ 0`, y is incremented. Next pixel is (5, 3).\n    *   Update `P`: `P = 2 + 2*4 - 2*10 = 2 + 8 - 20 = -10`.\n    *   **Pixel 5:** (5, 3).\n*   **Iteration 5:** Since `P < 0`, y does not change. Next pixel is (6, 3).\n    *   Update `P`: `P = -10 + 2*4 = -2`.\n    *   **Pixel 6:** (6, 3).\n*   **Iteration 6:** Since `P < 0`, y does not change. Next pixel is (7, 3).\n    *   Update `P`: `P = -2 + 2*4 = 6`.\n    *   **Pixel 7:** (7, 3).\n*   **Iteration 7:** Since `P ≥ 0`, y is incremented. Next pixel is (8, 4).\n    *   Update `P`: `P = 6 + 2*4 - 2*10 = 6 + 8 - 20 = -6`.\n    *   **Pixel 8:** (8, 4).\n*   **Iteration 8:** Since `P < 0`, y does not change. Next pixel is (9, 4).\n    *   Update `P`: `P = -6 + 2*4 = 2`.\n    *   **Pixel 9:** (9, 4).\n*   **Iteration 9:** Since `P ≥ 0`, y is incremented. Next pixel is (10, 5).\n    *   Update `P`: `P = 2 + 2*4 - 2*10 = 2 + 8 - 20 = -10`.\n    *   **Pixel 10:** (10, 5).\n*   **Iteration 10:** Since `P < 0`, y does not change. Next pixel is (11, 5).\n    *   **Pixel 11:** (11, 5).\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Central Pixel**\n\n1.  **List all the generated pixels in order:**\n    (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 3), **(6, 3)**, (7, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4), (10, 5), (11, 5)\n2.  **Count the total number of pixels:** There are `dx + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11` pixels.\n3.  **Find the middle pixel:** Since there is an odd number of pixels (11), the central pixel is the `(11 + 1) / 2 = 6th` pixel in the sequence.\n4.  Looking at the list, the 6th pixel is (6, 3).\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Correct Algorithm Case:** It's important to correctly identify that the slope is between 0 and 1, which dictates the main loop increments `x` and decides on `y`. For other slopes (e.g., > 1 or negative), the roles of `x` and `y` might be swapped.\n*   **Decision Parameter:** The initialization `P = 2*dy - dx` and the update rules must be applied correctly. A mix-up in the formulas will lead to an incorrect set of pixels.\n*   **Counting Pixels:** The total number of pixels drawn is `max(|dx|, |dy|) + 1`. In this case, `10 + 1 = 11`. This is crucial for finding the correct index of the central pixel.\n*   **Central Pixel Index:** For a list of `n` items, if `n` is odd, the middle index is `(n+1)/2`. If `n` were even, there would be two central pixels.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBy following Bresenham's algorithm, we generate a sequence of 11 pixels. The 6th pixel in this sequence is the central one.\n\nList of pixels: (1,1), (2,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,3), **(6,3)**, (7,3), (8,4), (9,4), (10,5), (11,5)\n\nThe central pixel is the 6th one in the list.\n\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
