    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the algorithm's computational time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Components of the Algorithm:**\n    The algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` consists of three main parts:\n    *   **Step 1: Initialization.** A fixed set of initial assignments and calculations are performed before the main loop.\n    *   **Step 2: The `while` loop.** This is the main part of the algorithm, which iteratively computes the digits of the base `c` representation.\n    *   **Step 3: Return.** The final result is returned.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Cost of Initialization (Step 1):**\n    *   The operations are `i := 0`, `x := n`, `q := ⌊x/c⌋`, and `a_{0} := x — qc`.\n    *   This involves a few assignments, one division, one multiplication, and one subtraction.\n    *   Assuming that these basic arithmetic operations on integers take constant time, this step has a constant time complexity, which we denote as O(1).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Cost of the `while` Loop (Step 2):**\n    This is the most critical part for determining the overall complexity. We need to find out two things: how many times the loop runs, and what the cost of each iteration is.\n\n    *   **Cost of a Single Iteration:**\n        *   Inside the loop (Step 2.1), we have the operations: `i := i + 1`, `x := q`, `q := ⌊x/c⌋`, and `a_{i} := x — qc`.\n        *   Similar to the initialization step, these are all basic arithmetic and assignment operations. Under the standard assumption that they take constant time, the cost of a single iteration is O(1).\n\n    *   **Number of Iterations:**\n        *   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`.\n        *   Let's track the value of the variable `q`. In the first step, `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n        *   Inside each loop iteration, the variable `x` takes the value of the previous `q`, and the new `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`.\n        *   This means that in each pass of the loop, the value of the variable that controls the loop's continuation (`q`) is roughly divided by the base `c`.\n        *   The process starts with a value proportional to `n` and repeatedly divides by `c`. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` before the result becomes less than 1 (at which point the integer division will result in `q=0`) is given by the logarithm.\n        *   Specifically, the loop will execute `k` times, where `k` is the largest integer such that `n / c^k ≥ 1`. This means `k ≤ log_c(n)`. The number of iterations is precisely `⌊log_c(n)⌋` for `n ≥ c`. If `0 ≤ n < c`, the loop does not execute at all.\n        *   Therefore, the number of iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`. We can write this as `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Cost of the Return Statement (Step 3):**\n    *   The `return` statement itself takes constant time, O(1).\n\n5.  **Combine the Costs to Find the Total Complexity:**\n    *   Total Time Complexity = (Time for Step 1) + (Number of Iterations × Time per Iteration) + (Time for Step 3)\n    *   Total Time Complexity = O(1) + (O(log_c(n)) × O(1)) + O(1)\n    *   Total Time Complexity = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) + O(1)\n    *   In Big-O notation, we take the dominant term. The dominant term is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Assumption of O(1) Arithmetic:** The analysis relies on the common assumption that basic arithmetic operations (division, multiplication, etc.) take constant time. For arbitrarily large numbers (bignums), this is not true. Division of a number of size `log(n)` by a number of size `log(c)` can take `O(log(n) * log(c))` time, which would lead to an overall complexity of `O((log n)²)`. However, for typical algorithm analysis questions of this type, the O(1) arithmetic assumption is standard.\n*   **Base of the Logarithm:** The complexity is `O(log_c(n))`. Using the change of base formula for logarithms, `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`. Since `c` is a constant `(c ≥ 2)`, `log(c)` is also a constant. In Big-O notation, constant factors are omitted, so the complexity can also be written as `O(log n)`. However, `O(log_c(n))` is a more precise representation that shows the dependency on the base `c`.\n*   **Edge Cases:** For small `n` (e.g., `0 ≤ n < c`), the loop doesn't run, and the algorithm takes O(1) time. The `O(log_c(n))` complexity is an asymptotic analysis, which describes the behavior for large `n`.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the time complexity is determined by the number of iterations of the while loop. Each iteration effectively reduces the magnitude of the number being processed by a factor of `c`. This repeated division by a constant factor implies a logarithmic number of iterations. Since each iteration takes constant time (under standard assumptions), the total computational time complexity is proportional to the number of iterations.\n\nFinal Answer: The computational time complexity of the algorithm is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n<<<O(log_c(n))>>>"
