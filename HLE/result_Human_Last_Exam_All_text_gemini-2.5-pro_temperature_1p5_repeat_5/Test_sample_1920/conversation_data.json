    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Conductor**\n\nThe first step is to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d=53599$.\n*   $d$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   Let's test division by other small primes:\n    *   $53599 \\div 7 = 7657$\n    *   $7657 \\div 13 = 589$\n    *   $589 \\div 19 = 31$\n*   Since 7, 13, 19, and 31 are all prime numbers, the prime factorization of the conductor is:\n    $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$\n    We note that the conductor $d$ is square-free.\n\n**2. Understand Primitive Characters for a Square-Free Conductor**\n\n*   A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo a composite number $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$ can be uniquely factored into a product of characters modulo its prime factors:\n    $\\chi = \\chi_{p_1} \\chi_{p_2} \\cdots \\chi_{p_r}$, where each $\\chi_{p_i}$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $p_i$.\n*   For a character $\\chi$ to be **primitive** with conductor $d$, its conductor must be exactly $d$. The conductor of the product character $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of its components: $c(\\chi) = c(\\chi_{p_1}) c(\\chi_{p_2}) \\cdots c(\\chi_{p_r})$.\n*   For a character $\\psi$ modulo a prime $p$, its conductor $c(\\psi)$ is 1 if $\\psi$ is the principal character (order 1), and $p$ otherwise (order > 1).\n*   For the conductor of $\\chi$ to be $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$, we need the conductor of each component character $\\chi_p$ to be $p$. This means that for each prime $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, the character $\\chi_p$ must **not** be the principal character. In other words, its order must be greater than 1.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The primitivity of $\\chi$ requires that *every* component character $\\chi_p$ is non-principal.\n\n**3. Analyze the Order Requirement**\n\n*   We are given that the order of the character $\\chi$ must be 6.\n*   The order of a product character is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters. Let $k_p = \\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$. Then we must have:\n    $\\text{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31}) = 6$\n*   This condition implies that the order of each component character, $k_p$, must be a divisor of 6. So, $k_p \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n**4. Combine Conditions and Count the Characters**\n\nLet's combine the conditions from Steps 2 and 3:\n1.  For each $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, the order $k_p = \\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$ must be greater than 1.\n2.  For each $p$, $k_p$ must be a divisor of 6.\n\nCombining these, the order $k_p$ of each component character $\\chi_p$ must be in the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nNow, we count how many characters exist for each of these orders.\n*   The group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n*   Let's check if the required orders {2, 3, 6} are possible for our primes:\n    *   **mod 7:** $p-1=6$. Orders 2, 3, 6 all divide 6. All are possible.\n    *   **mod 13:** $p-1=12$. Orders 2, 3, 6 all divide 12. All are possible.\n    *   **mod 19:** $p-1=18$. Orders 2, 3, 6 all divide 18. All are possible.\n    *   **mod 31:** $p-1=30$. Orders 2, 3, 6 all divide 30. All are possible.\n*   Let's find the number of characters for each allowed order:\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 2$\n*   So for each of the four primes, we have $1+2+2=5$ possible characters whose orders are in the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n**5. Apply the `lcm` Condition Using Inclusion-Exclusion**\n\nWe need to select one character $\\chi_p$ for each of the four primes such that their orders $k_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ satisfy $\\text{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31}) = 6$.\n\n*   Let's first find the total number of ways to choose one character $\\chi_p$ for each prime $p$ with an order $k_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$. Since there are 5 choices for each of the 4 primes, the total number of such combinations is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n*   This total of 625 counts primitive characters whose resulting order is 2, 3, or 6. We must subtract the cases where the order is 2 or 3.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** We must exclude cases where the lcm is a proper divisor of 6.\n*   **Case A: The order of $\\chi$ is 2.**\n    This occurs if $\\text{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31}) = 2$. This requires that every $k_p$ must be a divisor of 2. Since $k_p \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$, this forces $k_p=2$ for all four primes.\n    The number of ways to choose a character of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$. So the total number of such characters is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n*   **Case B: The order of $\\chi$ is 3.**\n    This occurs if $\\text{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31}) = 3$. This requires that every $k_p$ must be a divisor of 3. Since $k_p \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$, this forces $k_p=3$ for all four primes.\n    The number of ways to choose a character of order 3 is $\\phi(3)=2$. So the total number of such characters is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n*   There is no overlap between Case A and Case B (an order cannot be both 2 and 3).\n\nThe number of characters with order 6 is the total number of possibilities (625) minus the numbers from Case A and Case B.\nNumber of characters = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$ is calculated as follows:\n1.  Factorize the conductor: $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n2.  Recognize that a primitive character of this conductor is a product $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$, where each $\\chi_p$ is a non-principal character modulo $p$.\n3.  The order of $\\chi$ is $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\n4.  This means the order of each $\\chi_p$, let's call it $k_p$, must be in the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n5.  The number of characters of order $k$ modulo any of these primes is $\\phi(k)$.\n    *   Choices for order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$\n    *   Choices for order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$\n    *   Choices for order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$\n6.  The total number of ways to pick one character for each prime with order in $\\{2,3,6\\}$ is $(1+2+2)^4 = 5^4 = 625$.\n7.  We subtract the cases where the lcm is not 6:\n    *   lcm is 2: This requires all orders to be 2. Number of ways: $1^4 = 1$.\n    *   lcm is 3: This requires all orders to be 3. Number of ways: $2^4 = 16$.\n8.  The final count is $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
