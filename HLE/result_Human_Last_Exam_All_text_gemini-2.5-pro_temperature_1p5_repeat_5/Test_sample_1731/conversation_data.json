    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons) using the principles of large deviation theory.\n\n### Conceptual Framework: Large Deviations and Statistical Mechanics\n\nThe connection between large deviation theory (LDT) and statistical mechanics is fundamental. The central idea of statistical mechanics is that a system in equilibrium will be found in its most probable macrostate. A macrostate is defined by macroscopic properties like energy, pressure, etc., while a microstate is a specific configuration of all its constituent particles. The macrostate with the largest number of corresponding microstates is the one with the highest entropy and is, therefore, the most probable.\n\nLarge deviation theory provides a mathematical framework for this principle.\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem relates the probability of an empirical measure (e.g., the distribution of particles across energy levels) to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from the true underlying distribution. In statistical mechanics, Boltzmann's entropy formula can be seen as a rate function. The probability of observing a macrostate $\\{n_i\\}$ is proportional to its multiplicity $W(\\{n_i\\})$, and $P(\\{n_i\\}) \\propto e^{S(\\{n_i\\})/k_B}$. Maximizing entropy $S$ is equivalent to finding the state of minimum deviation or maximum probability.\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem gives the rate function for the large deviations of a sample mean from the true mean. The mathematical structure it uses (the Legendre-Fenchel transform) is mirrored in the relationship between thermodynamic potentials in different statistical ensembles (e.g., between entropy in the microcanonical ensemble and free energy in the canonical ensemble).\n\nIn essence, \"using\" these theorems means applying the principle of maximizing the entropy functional, which acts as the rate function for the system's macroscopic state.\n\n### Step 1: Deriving the Entropy Functional for a Bose Gas\n\nA system of light quanta (photons) is a Bose gas. We need the entropy expression for this system.\n\n1.  A macrostate is defined by the set of occupation numbers $\\{n_i\\}$, where $n_i$ is the number of photons in the energy level $\\epsilon_i$, which has a degeneracy of $g_i$ (i.e., $g_i$ distinct quantum states have the same energy $\\epsilon_i$).\n2.  For bosons, the number of ways to arrange $n_i$ indistinguishable particles in $g_i$ states is given by the Bose-Einstein combinatorial factor:\n    $W_i = \\binom{n_i + g_i - 1}{n_i} = \\frac{(n_i + g_i - 1)!}{n_i! (g_i - 1)!}$\n3.  The total multiplicity for the macrostate $\\{n_i\\}$ is $W = \\prod_i W_i$.\n4.  Boltzmann's entropy is $S = k_B \\ln W$. For large $n_i$ and $g_i$, we use Stirling's approximation ($\\ln x! \\approx x \\ln x - x$):\n    $S = k_B \\sum_i \\ln W_i \\approx k_B \\sum_i [(n_i+g_i)\\ln(n_i+g_i) - n_i\\ln n_i - g_i\\ln g_i]$\n5.  Let $\\bar{n}_i = n_i/g_i$ be the average occupation number per state at level $i$. The entropy functional can be written as:\n    $S[\\{\\bar{n}_i\\}] = k_B \\sum_i g_i [(1+\\bar{n}_i)\\ln(1+\\bar{n}_i) - \\bar{n}_i\\ln\\bar{n}_i]$\n\nThis expression for entropy is the key quantity to be maximized. According to the large deviation principle, the equilibrium state corresponds to the set of occupation numbers $\\{\\bar{n}_i\\}$ that maximizes this function under the system's physical constraints.\n\n### Step 2: Maximizing Entropy to Find the Equilibrium Distribution\n\nWe find the equilibrium distribution by maximizing $S$ subject to the constraints of the system. For a gas of photons:\n1.  **Fixed Total Energy:** $E = \\sum_i n_i \\epsilon_i = \\sum_i g_i \\bar{n}_i \\epsilon_i = \\text{constant}$.\n2.  **Non-conserved Particle Number:** Photons can be created and annihilated. This means there is no constraint on the total number of particles, which is equivalent to setting the chemical potential $\\mu=0$.\n\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We maximize $\\mathcal{L} = S/k_B - \\beta(E - \\sum_i g_i \\bar{n}_i \\epsilon_i)$, where $\\beta$ is the Lagrange multiplier for the energy constraint.\n\n$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\bar{n}_j} = g_j \\left[ \\ln(1+\\bar{n}_j) - \\ln \\bar{n}_j \\right] - \\beta g_j \\epsilon_j = 0$\n$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1+\\bar{n}_j}{\\bar{n}_j}\\right) = \\beta \\epsilon_j$\n$1 + \\frac{1}{\\bar{n}_j} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}$\n$\\bar{n}_j = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\n\nThis is the famous **Planck distribution**, which describes the equilibrium occupation number for a photon gas. The Lagrange multiplier is identified with the inverse temperature, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy, `<E>`\n\nThe total mean energy is found by summing the energy of all photons, which in the continuous limit becomes an integral.\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\cdot \\bar{n}(\\epsilon) \\cdot g(\\epsilon) \\, d\\epsilon$\n\n*   **Density of States, g(ε):** For photons (massless, spin-1 particles) in a 3D volume $V$, including two polarization states, the density of states is:\n    $g(\\epsilon) = \\frac{V \\epsilon^2}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3}$\n*   **Integration:**\n    $\\langle E \\rangle = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\left(\\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{V \\epsilon^2}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3}\\right) \\, d\\epsilon = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} \\, d\\epsilon$\n*   **Solving the integral:** We use the substitution $x = \\beta\\epsilon$:\n    $\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} \\frac{1}{\\beta^4} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} \\, dx$\n    The integral is a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function, with value $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x-1}dx = \\Gamma(4)\\zeta(4) = 6 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^4}{90} = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\n*   **Final Result for Mean Energy:** Substituting the integral's value and $\\beta=1/(k_B T)$:\n    $\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} \\left(\\frac{k_B^4 T^4}{1}\\right) \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} = \\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} V T^4$\n    This is the celebrated Stefan-Boltzmann law for the energy of black-body radiation.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy, S\n\nWe can calculate the entropy by plugging the equilibrium distribution back into the entropy functional. However, a much simpler method is to use a general thermodynamic relation derived from the grand potential, $\\Omega$.\n\n*   **Grand Potential, Ω:** For bosons, $\\Omega = k_B T \\sum_i g_i \\ln(1 - e^{-(\\epsilon_i - \\mu)/k_B T})$. For photons, $\\mu=0$.\n    $\\Omega = k_B T \\int_0^\\infty g(\\epsilon) \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}) \\, d\\epsilon = \\frac{V k_B T}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon^2 \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}) \\, d\\epsilon$\n*   **Integrating by parts** shows a direct relationship between $\\Omega$ and $\\langle E \\rangle$:\n    $\\Omega = -\\frac{V}{3\\pi^2(\\hbar c)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon}-1} d\\epsilon = -\\frac{1}{3} \\langle E \\rangle$\n    This relation, $P V = \\frac{1}{3} E$ (since $\\Omega = -PV$), is characteristic of an ultra-relativistic gas.\n*   **Thermodynamic Relation for Entropy:** The Gibbs-Duhem relation is $E = TS - PV + \\mu N$. For a photon gas, $\\mu=0$, so $E = TS - PV$.\n    Using $\\Omega = -PV$, we have $E = TS + \\Omega$.\n    $S = \\frac{E - \\Omega}{T}$\n*   **Final Result for Entropy:** Substituting $\\Omega = -1/3 \\langle E \\rangle$:\n    $S = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle - (-\\frac{1}{3}\\langle E \\rangle)}{T} = \\frac{4\\langle E \\rangle}{3T}$\n    Now, substituting our expression for $\\langle E \\rangle$:\n    $S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left(\\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} V T^4\\right) = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 k_B^4}{45 (\\hbar c)^3} V T^3$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas are:\n\n**Mean Energy:**\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} V T^4$\n\n**Entropy:**\n$S = \\frac{4\\pi^2 k_B^4}{45 (\\hbar c)^3} V T^3$\n\nWhere:\n*   $V$ is the volume.\n*   $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n*   $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Mean Energy: $\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} V T^4$\nEquilibrium Entropy: $S = \\frac{4\\pi^2 k_B^4}{45 (\\hbar c)^3} V T^3$\n>>>"
