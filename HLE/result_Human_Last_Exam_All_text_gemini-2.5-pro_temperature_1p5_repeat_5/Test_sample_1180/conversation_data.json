    "An analysis of the stable reduction of the curve defined by the equation $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is required to find the thickness of the resulting double point.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Model and Reduction**\nLet the curve be $C$. The equation is $F(x, z) = z^2 - (2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1) = 0$. We work over the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ with the 2-adic valuation $v$ normalized by $v(2)=1$.\nThe reduction of the curve modulo 2 is obtained by reducing the coefficients of the equation modulo 2:\n$z^2 \\equiv 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1 \\pmod{2}$\n$z^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$\n$z^2 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\n$(z - 1)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\nThe reduced curve is the line $z=1$ with multiplicity 2. This is a non-reduced scheme, which means the curve $C$ has bad reduction at $p=2$.\n\n**Step 2: Change of Variables and a Better Model**\nTo analyze the singularity, we perform a change of variables to center the singular locus at the origin. Let $z_1 = z-1$. Substituting $z = z_1+1$ into the original equation gives:\n$(z_1+1)^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n$z_1^2 + 2z_1 + 1 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n$z_1^2 + 2z_1 = 2x^5 + 2x^3$\nLet's make another change of variables to simplify the analysis. Let $Y = z_1/2$. This corresponds to a blow-up. To keep the coordinates in an affine space over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, this is not ideal. A better way is to set $z = 1+2Y$.\n$(1+2Y)^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n$1+4Y+4Y^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n$4Y^2+4Y = 2x^5+2x^3$\nDividing by 2, we obtain a new model for the curve:\n$2Y^2+2Y = x^5+x^3$\nLet's call this Model $\\mathcal{C}_1$. Its reduction modulo 2 is:\n$0 \\equiv x^5+x^3 \\pmod{2}$\n$x^3(x^2+1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\n$x^3(x+1)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\nThe special fiber of this model consists of two components in the affine $(x,Y)$-plane: the line $L_1: x=0$ (with multiplicity 3) and the line $L_2: x=1$ (with multiplicity 2). These components are disjoint in the affine plane. To understand how they connect, we must study the curve at infinity.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis at Infinity**\nWe need to find a projective model that describes the behavior at infinity. We start from Model $\\mathcal{C}_1$: $x^5+x^3 - 2Y^2 - 2Y = 0$.\nWe homogenize this equation with respect to a new variable $Z$. A suitable weighted homogenization can be complicated. A standard homogenization for a degree 5 curve in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ is:\n$x^5 + x^3Z^2 - 2Y^2Z^3 - 2YZ^4 = 0$\nThe special fiber (reduction mod 2) of this projective model is:\n$x^5 + x^3Z^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2 \\implies x^3(x^2+Z^2) \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2 \\implies x^3(x+Z)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nThe components are the lines $X=0$ (our $L_1$) and $X+Z=0$ (our $L_2$, since in the affine chart $Z=1$, this is $x+1=0$).\nThese two lines intersect at the point where $X=0$ and $X+Z=0$, which implies $X=0$ and $Z=0$. This corresponds to the point $[0:1:0]$ in projective coordinates $(X:Y:Z)$. This point is the singular point of the special fiber where the two components meet.\n\n**Step 4: Local Analysis of the Singularity**\nTo analyze the singularity at $[0:1:0]$, we dehomogenize with respect to $Y$. Let $u=X/Y$ and $v=Z/Y$. The point $[0:1:0]$ becomes the origin $(u,v)=(0,0)$. The equation becomes:\n$u^5 + u^3v^2 - 2v^3 - 2v^4 = 0$\nThis is the local equation of the model $\\mathcal{C}_1$ at the singular point. We need to resolve this singularity. We perform a blow-up at the origin $(u,v)=(0,0)$. The blow-up is covered by two affine charts. Let's analyze the chart $u=U, v=UV$. Substituting into the equation:\n$(U)^5 + (U)^3(UV)^2 - 2(UV)^3 - 2(UV)^4 = 0$\n$U^5 + U^5V^2 - 2U^3V^3 - 2U^4V^4 = 0$\nDividing by $U^3$ (the equation of the exceptional divisor in this chart is $U=0$):\n$U^2 + U^2V^2 - 2V^3 - 2UV^4 = 0$\n$U^2(1+V^2) = 2V^3(1+UV)$\nThis equation describes the situation after one blow-up. This model is still singular. Near the origin $(U,V)=(0,0)$, the units $(1+V^2)$ and $(1+UV)$ are approximately 1. The local equation simplifies to:\n$U^2 = 2V^3$\n\nThis is not yet the form $XY = \\pi^k$. Let's try the other chart of the blow-up: $v=V, u=UV$.\n$(UV)^5 + (UV)^3V^2 - 2V^3 - 2V^4 = 0$\n$U^5V^5 + U^3V^5 - 2V^3 - 2V^4 = 0$\nDividing by $V^3$ (the exceptional divisor is $V=0$):\n$U^5V^2 + U^3V^2 - 2 - 2V = 0$\n$V^2(U^5+U^3) = 2(1+V)$\nLet's analyze this model near the point $(U,V)=(0,0)$. The local equation is approximately $V^2U^3(U^2+1) = 2(1+V)$. As $U^2+1$ and $1+V$ are units near the origin, the local structure is given by:\n$V^2U^3 = 2 \\cdot (\\text{unit})$\nLet's analyze this local equation $V^2U^3 = 2$. Let $v_2$ be the 2-adic valuation.\n$v_2(V^2U^3) = v_2(2) \\implies 2v_2(V) + 3v_2(U) = 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Finding the Thickness**\nA double point on a stable model has a local equation of the form $A B = \\pi^k$, where $\\pi$ is the uniformizer of the valuation ring (here $\\pi=2$) and $k$ is the thickness of the double point.\nWe need to find a birational transformation $(U,V) \\to (A,B)$ that transforms $V^2U^3=2$ into $AB=2^k$.\nLet's try a monomial transformation:\n$A = U^a V^b$\n$B = U^c V^d$\nThis transformation is invertible if $ad-bc = \\pm 1$. We want $AB = U^{a+c}V^{b+d}$ to be related to $2^k$.\nWe have the relation $2v_2(V) + 3v_2(U) = 1$.\n$v_2(AB) = (a+c)v_2(U) + (b+d)v_2(V) = k$.\nThis implies that the vector $(a+c, b+d)$ must be a multiple of $(3,2)$. Let's say $(a+c, b+d) = \\lambda(3,2)$. Then:\n$v_2(AB) = \\lambda(3v_2(U) + 2v_2(V)) = \\lambda(1) = \\lambda$.\nSo, the thickness $k$ would be $\\lambda$.\nWe look for the simplest integer solution, so let's try $\\lambda=1$.\nWe need to find integers $a, b, c, d$ such that:\n1) $a+c = 3$\n2) $b+d = 2$\n3) $ad-bc = \\pm 1$\n\nLet's try to solve this system. For example, choose $a=1, c=2$. Then from (1), $1+2=3$. This works.\nChoose $b=1, d=1$. Then from (2), $1+1=2$. This works.\nCheck condition (3): $ad-bc = (1)(1) - (1)(2) = 1-2 = -1$. This works.\nSo we found a valid transformation: $A = UV, B = U^2V$.\nLet's apply this transformation to the equation $U^3V^2=2$.\nWe need to express $U,V$ in terms of $A,B$:\n$B/A = (U^2V)/(UV) = U$. So $U = B/A$.\n$A = (B/A)V \\implies V = A^2/B$.\nSubstituting this into the local equation:\n$(B/A)^3 (A^2/B)^2 = 2$\n$(B^3/A^3) (A^4/B^2) = 2$\n$AB = 2$\nThis is in the standard form $AB = 2^k$ with $k=1$.\nThe thickness of the double point is $k$.\n\nThus, the thickness of the double point is 1."
