    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the **rule activation level** (also known as the firing strength or firing level) of a fuzzy rule within an Interval Type-3 Fuzzy System.\n\n**2. Define \"Rule Activation Level\"**\nIn any fuzzy inference system (Type-1, Type-2, or Type-3), a rule has the general structure: `IF [antecedent conditions] THEN [consequent action]`.\n*   The **antecedent** is the \"IF\" part of the rule (e.g., `IF temperature is High`).\n*   The **consequent** is the \"THEN\" part of the rule (e.g., `THEN fan_speed is Fast`).\nThe **rule activation level** is a measure of the degree to which the antecedent conditions are met by the current input values. This calculation **only** involves the inputs and the antecedent fuzzy sets.\n\n**3. Analyze the Given Information**\nWe are provided with two values:\n*   `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`: This notation represents the evaluation of the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the k-th rule for a given input `x'`. It signifies the degree to which the input `x'` satisfies the condition of the k-th rule. This is, by definition, the rule's activation level.\n*   `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`: This notation represents the membership grade of an output value `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G`. The letter `G` is standard notation for a consequent set. This value is used in a later step of the fuzzy inference process (implication) to determine the shape of the rule's output fuzzy set, but it is not used to calculate the initial activation level.\n\n**4. List the Careful Points**\n*   **Separation of Concepts:** It is crucial to distinguish between the calculation of the rule activation level and the subsequent inference step (implication). The activation level depends only on the antecedent. The consequent's membership value comes into play *after* the activation level is known.\n*   **The Role of the t-norm:** The question mentions a \"t-norm operation\". A t-norm (like MIN or product) is used to combine membership values when a rule has multiple antecedent clauses connected by \"AND\" (e.g., `IF temperature is High AND humidity is Low`). In this problem, `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` is given as a single value. This implies that if multiple antecedents existed, the t-norm operation has already been performed to result in this single firing strength.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The value `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9` is information about the consequent. For the specific question of finding the \"rule activation level\", this information is extraneous. It is a distractor. The complexity of the system being \"Interval Type-3\" does not change this fundamental principle.\n\n**5. Acquire the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Logic**\n*   **Step 1:** The goal is to find the rule activation level.\n*   **Step 2:** The rule activation level is determined by evaluating the antecedent part of the rule for the given inputs.\n*   **Step 3:** The provided value `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` represents the result of this antecedent evaluation.\n*   **Step 4:** The other value, `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`, pertains to the consequent and is not relevant for calculating the activation level.\n*   **Step 5:** Therefore, the rule activation level is simply the value provided for the antecedent evaluation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The rule activation level is 0.7. Even if one were to incorrectly assume that both values should be combined using the specified t-norm (e.g., the MIN t-norm), the result would be `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`. However, the correct reasoning is that only the antecedent value determines the activation level.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
