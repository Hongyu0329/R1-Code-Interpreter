    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the ballet steps to determine which one ends with the same leg position as it started.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The question asks to identify the ballet step from the given options where the final leg position is identical to the initial leg position. This means if the dancer starts in fifth position with the right foot in front, they must also end in fifth position with the right foot in front.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Answer Choice:**\n\n    *   **A. Entrechat six:**\n        *   **Starting Position:** Typically begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n        *   **Description:** \"Entrechat\" means interweaving or braiding. \"Six\" refers to the number of leg movements or crossings in the air. In an entrechat six, the dancer jumps vertically, beats the legs three times, and lands. The rule for entrechats is that even-numbered ones (like *quatre* and *six*) land in the same position they started from. Odd-numbered entrechats (like *trois* and *cinq*) land on one foot with the other changed.\n        *   **Ending Position:** Lands on both feet in the original fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are the same.\n\n    *   **B. Échappé battu changé:**\n        *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n        *   **Description:** This is a compound step. \"Échappé\" means to escape, involving a jump from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second) and back to a closed one. \"Battu\" means beaten, so the legs beat together as they close. \"Changé\" means changed. The term \"changé\" explicitly indicates that the feet will change their position.\n        *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot in front).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n    *   **C. Assemblé:**\n        *   **Starting Position:** Usually fifth position (e.g., right foot back).\n        *   **Description:** \"Assemblé\" means to assemble or join together. The dancer slides one foot out, jumps off the supporting leg, and brings (assembles) the legs together in the air before landing in fifth position. In a standard *assemblé dessus* (over), the foot that started in the back moves to the front. In an *assemblé dessous* (under), the foot that started in front moves to the back. In both common cases, the feet change.\n        *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position with the feet switched (e.g., the right foot is now in front).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n    *   **D. Glissade derrière:**\n        *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n        *   **Description:** \"Glissade\" means to glide. \"Derrière\" means to the back. In this step, the dancer slides the back foot out to the side, transfers weight, and then slides the front foot to close in fifth position *behind* the other foot.\n        *   **Execution:** If starting with the right foot front, the left (back) foot glides out, and the right foot closes behind the left.\n        *   **Ending Position:** The new position is fifth with the left foot in front.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The feet have changed places, so the ending position is different.\n\n    *   **E. Gargouillade:**\n        *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n        *   **Description:** This is a complex, decorative jump. It is similar to a *pas de chat*, but each leg performs a small *rond de jambe* (circular movement) in the air. The sequence of the jump and the rond de jambe action results in the dancer landing with the opposite foot in front.\n        *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot in front).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Key Terminology:** Understand the meaning of French ballet terms like *changé* (changed), *derrière* (behind), and *dessus* (over), as they often dictate the outcome of the step.\n*   **Even vs. Odd Entrechats:** A crucial rule in ballet technique is that even-numbered entrechats (deux, quatre, six) always land in the same position they started in. Odd-numbered ones do not.\n*   **Standard Forms:** Unless specified otherwise (e.g., \"sans changer\" - without changing), assume the standard execution of the step. Standard *assemblés* and *glissades* (like glissade derrière/devant) involve a change of feet.\n*   **Deconstruction:** Break down compound steps like *échappé battu changé* into their components to understand the full movement. The word *changé* is the deciding factor here.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the only step that, by its definition, starts and ends in the same leg position is the **Entrechat six**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
