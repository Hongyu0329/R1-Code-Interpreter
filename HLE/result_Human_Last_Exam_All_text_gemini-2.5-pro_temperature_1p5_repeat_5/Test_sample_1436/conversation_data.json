    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Feynman Diagram's Topology\n\nThe question describes a Feynman diagram with the following characteristics:\n*   **Two vertices:** Let's call them vertex 1 (`v1`) and vertex 2 (`v2`).\n*   **Four field contractions:** In a diagram, field contractions are represented by lines (propagators).\n*   **Perturbative Green's function analysis:** This implies the diagram is part of the expansion of a correlation function, and it may not have external lines (i.e., it could be a vacuum diagram).\n\nGiven these constraints, the simplest and most common interaction that produces such a diagram is from a theory with a four-field interaction vertex, like the `λφ⁴` theory. In this theory, each vertex has four lines attached.\n\nThe only way to connect two four-point vertices with four lines is for all four lines from `v1` to connect to `v2`. This creates a diagram that looks like two points connected by four parallel arcs. This is a vacuum bubble diagram, as it has no external lines.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Concept of a Symmetry Factor\n\nThe symmetry factor, `S`, is a purely combinatorial number associated with a Feynman diagram. It corrects for overcounting when we generate diagrams from the perturbative expansion. A diagram's contribution to a physical quantity is multiplied by its symmetry factor.\n\nThe symmetry factor is defined as the inverse of the order of the automorphism group of the diagram, `S = 1/|Aut(G)|`. The automorphism group `Aut(G)` consists of all permutations of the internal vertices and lines that leave the diagram's topology unchanged.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Symmetries of the Diagram\n\nWe need to count the number of ways we can permute the internal components (vertices and lines) of the diagram while leaving it looking identical.\n\n1.  **Vertex Permutations:** The diagram consists of two vertices, `v1` and `v2`. Since they are both of the same type (e.g., `λφ⁴` vertices) and are connected to each other in an identical manner, we can swap their positions (`v1 ↔ v2`) without changing the diagram. This is a single swap, which corresponds to a group of order `2` (or `2!`).\n    *   Contribution to `|Aut(G)|`: `2`\n\n2.  **Line (Propagator) Permutations:** There are four identical lines connecting `v1` and `v2`. We can permute these four lines among themselves in any way, and the diagram will remain unchanged. The number of ways to permute `n` identical objects is `n!`. In this case, `n=4`.\n    *   Contribution to `|Aut(G)|`: `4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Order of the Automorphism Group\n\nThe total number of symmetries of the diagram is the product of the number of independent vertex and line permutations.\n\n*   `|Aut(G)| = (Number of vertex permutations) × (Number of line permutations)`\n*   `|Aut(G)| = 2 × 4!`\n*   `|Aut(G)| = 2 × 24 = 48`\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Symmetry Factor\n\nThe symmetry factor `S` is the inverse of the order of the automorphism group.\n\n*   `S = 1 / |Aut(G)|`\n*   `S = 1 / 48`\n\n### Careful Points and Alternative Confirmation\n\n*   **Theory Dependence:** The analysis assumes the vertices and lines are indistinguishable. This is true in a simple scalar theory like `λφ⁴`. If the fields or vertices were of different types, the symmetries would be reduced. However, the problem description implies identical components.\n*   **Origin in Perturbation Theory:** We can confirm this result by considering the diagram's origin in the perturbative expansion.\n    1.  The diagram has two vertices, so it comes from the second-order term in the expansion of `exp(i∫L_int)`, which has a factor of `1/2!`.\n    2.  For `L_int = (λ/4!)φ⁴`, each vertex contributes a `1/4!`. For two vertices, this is `(1/4!)²`.\n    3.  The combinatorial factor from Wick's theorem for connecting the four fields at vertex `x` to the four fields at vertex `y` is `4!`.\n    4.  The total coefficient is the product of these factors: `Total Coefficient = (1/2!) × (1/4!)² × 4! = (1/2) × (1/(24×24)) × 24 = 1/48`.\n    This confirms the result obtained from the automorphism group method.\n\nThe final answer is the symmetry factor `S`.\n\n<<<1/48>>>"
