    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the smallest size of a set $A \\subset G$ such that every cyclic subgroup of $G$ contains at least one element of $A$, where $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Group and its Cyclic Subgroups**\n    The group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This is an abelian group where every element has an order that divides 49. The possible orders of elements (and thus of cyclic subgroups) are 1, 7, and 49.\n    The problem asks for the minimum size of a set $A \\subseteq G$ that is a \"hitting set\" for the collection of all cyclic subgroups of $G$. This means for any $g \\in G$, the intersection of $A$ with the cyclic subgroup generated by $g$, $\\langle g \\rangle$, must be non-empty ($A \\cap \\langle g \\rangle \\neq \\emptyset$).\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Hitting Set Condition**\n    *   **Subgroup of order 1:** The only cyclic subgroup of order 1 is $\\{0\\}$, generated by the identity element. To ensure this subgroup is \"hit\", the set $A$ must contain 0. So, $0 \\in A$.\n    *   **Subgroups of order 7 and 49:** Let's consider the relationship between subgroups of different orders. A crucial observation is that any cyclic subgroup of order 49, say $H_{49} = \\langle g \\rangle$, contains a unique cyclic subgroup of order 7, which is $H_7 = \\langle 7g \\rangle$.\n    *   This inclusion property suggests a strategy: if we choose an element from $H_7$ to be in our set $A$, we not only hit $H_7$ but also $H_{49}$ (since any element of $H_7$ is also an element of $H_{49}$). This implies we should focus our attention on the \"smallest\" non-trivial cyclic subgroups, which are those of order 7.\n\n3.  **Establishing a Lower Bound for the Size of A**\n    Let $\\mathcal{H}_7$ be the set of all cyclic subgroups of order 7 in $G$.\n    A key property of these subgroups is that any two distinct subgroups in $\\mathcal{H}_7$ intersect only at the identity element.\n    *   **Proof:** Let $H_1, H_2 \\in \\mathcal{H}_7$ with $H_1 \\neq H_2$. Suppose there is a non-zero element $x \\in H_1 \\cap H_2$. Since the order of $H_1$ is the prime number 7, any non-zero element, including $x$, must be a generator of $H_1$. So $\\langle x \\rangle = H_1$. By the same logic, $\\langle x \\rangle = H_2$. This implies $H_1 = H_2$, which contradicts our assumption that they are distinct. Therefore, $H_1 \\cap H_2 = \\{0\\}$.\n    *   To hit every subgroup in $\\mathcal{H}_7$, the set $A$ must contain at least one element from each. Since these subgroups are disjoint except for the identity, $A$ must contain a unique non-zero element for each subgroup in $\\mathcal{H}_7$.\n    *   Combining this with the fact that $0 \\in A$, the minimum size of $A$ must be at least $1 + |\\mathcal{H}_7|$.\n\n4.  **Constructing a Set A to Establish an Upper Bound**\n    We can construct a set $A^*$ that achieves this lower bound. Let's define $A^*$ as follows:\n    1.  Include the identity element: $0 \\in A^*$.\n    2.  For each cyclic subgroup $H \\in \\mathcal{H}_7$, choose exactly one of its 6 generators and add it to $A^*$.\n    The size of this set is exactly $|A^*| = 1 + |\\mathcal{H}_7|$.\n\n    Now we verify if this set $A^*$ hits every cyclic subgroup of $G$:\n    *   **Order 1:** The subgroup $\\{0\\}$ is hit because $0 \\in A^*$.\n    *   **Order 7:** By construction, for every $H \\in \\mathcal{H}_7$, we added one of its elements to $A^*$, so it is hit.\n    *   **Order 49:** Let $H' = \\langle g \\rangle$ be any cyclic subgroup of order 49. This subgroup contains a unique cyclic subgroup of order 7, namely $H = \\langle 7g \\rangle$. Since $H \\in \\mathcal{H}_7$, by our construction, $A^*$ contains an element from $H$. As $H \\subset H'$, this element is also in $H'$, so $H'$ is hit.\n\n    Since our constructed set $A^*$ hits all cyclic subgroups and its size matches the lower bound, the minimum size of $A$ is $1 + |\\mathcal{H}_7|$.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Number of Cyclic Subgroups of Order 7**\n    To find $|\\mathcal{H}_7|$, we first count the number of elements of order 7 in $G$.\n    *   An element $g = (g_1, \\dots, g_{2024}) \\in G$ has an order that divides 7 if and only if $7g = 0$. This is equivalent to $7g_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49}$ for each component $g_i$.\n    *   In $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$, the elements $x$ satisfying $7x=0$ are the multiples of 7: $\\{0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42\\}$. There are 7 such elements.\n    *   Since there are 7 choices for each of the 2024 components of $g$, the number of elements in $G$ whose order divides 7 is $7^{2024}$.\n    *   These are the elements of the subgroup $G[7] = \\{g \\in G \\mid 7g=0\\}$. This subgroup is an $\\mathbb{F}_7$-vector space of dimension 2024.\n    *   The elements of order 7 are all elements in $G[7]$ except for the identity element. So, there are $7^{2024}-1$ elements of order 7.\n    *   Each cyclic subgroup of order 7 contains $\\phi(7) = 6$ generators (elements of order 7).\n    *   Therefore, the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of order 7 is:\n        $|\\mathcal{H}_7| = \\frac{\\text{Number of elements of order 7}}{\\phi(7)} = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**\n    The smallest size of the set $A$ is:\n    $|A| = 1 + |\\mathcal{H}_7| = 1 + \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\n    We can simplify this expression:\n    $|A| = \\frac{6}{6} + \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6} = \\frac{6 + 7^{2024} - 1}{6} = \\frac{7^{2024}+5}{6}$.\n    Note that $7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$, so $7^{2024} \\equiv 1^{2024} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$. Thus, $7^{2024}-1$ is divisible by 6, and our result is an integer.\n\nThe final answer is the expression we derived.\n\n<<<1 + (7^2024 - 1)/6>>>"
