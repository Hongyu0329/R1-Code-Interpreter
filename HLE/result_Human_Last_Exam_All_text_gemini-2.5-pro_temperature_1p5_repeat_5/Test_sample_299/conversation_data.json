    "An elegant problem in functional equations. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Analyze the properties of the function `f`**\n\nThe given equation is $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\nThe function $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n*   **Injectivity of `f`**:\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since the exponential function is injective (one-to-one), we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ is an injective function.\n\n*   **Monotonicity of `f`**:\n    A continuous and injective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. Thus, $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n**2. Case 1: `f` is strictly decreasing**\n\n*   If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then the composition $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing. This is because if $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$, and applying the decreasing function $f$ again reverses the inequality, so $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$.\n*   The function $g(x) = e^x$ is strictly increasing, so this case is possible so far.\n*   Let $R = \\text{Ran}(f)$ be the range of $f$. Since $f$ is a continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range $R$ must be an interval. As $f$ is decreasing, its range is an open interval $R = (\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x), \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x))$. Let's denote these limits by $L_1$ and $L_2$ respectively, so $R=(L_1, L_2)$ with $L_1 \\le L_2$.\n*   The equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$ implies that the range of the composition $f \\circ f$ is the range of $e^x$, which is $(0, \\infty)$. The range of $f \\circ f$ is $f(R)$. So, we must have $f(R) = (0, \\infty)$.\n*   Substituting $R=(L_1, L_2)$, we get $f((L_1, L_2)) = (0, \\infty)$.\n*   Since $f$ is strictly decreasing, the image of the interval $(L_1, L_2)$ under $f$ is $(\\lim_{y \\to L_2^-} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to L_1^+} f(y))$.\n*   Equating this with $(0, \\infty)$, we get:\n    1.  $\\lim_{y \\to L_2^-} f(y) = 0$.\n    2.  $\\lim_{y \\to L_1^+} f(y) = \\infty$.\n*   From condition 2, if $L_1$ were a finite real number, it would imply that $f$ has a vertical asymptote at $y=L_1$. However, $f$ is defined and continuous on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, so it cannot have a vertical asymptote. Therefore, $L_1$ cannot be a finite real number, which implies $L_1 = -\\infty$.\n*   If $L_1 = -\\infty$, then since $L_1 \\le L_2$, the range of $f$ is either $R=(-\\infty, L_2)$ or $R=(-\\infty, \\infty)$.\n    *   If $R=\\mathbb{R}$, then $f(R)=f(\\mathbb{R})=R=\\mathbb{R}$. But we need $f(R)=(0, \\infty)$. This leads to the contradiction $\\mathbb{R}=(0,\\infty)$.\n    *   If $R=(-\\infty, L_2)$ with $L_2$ finite, then $f(R) = f((-\\infty, L_2)) = (\\lim_{y\\to L_2^-} f(y), \\lim_{y\\to -\\infty} f(y))$. Since $\\lim_{y\\to -\\infty} f(y) = L_2$, this gives $f(R) = (f(L_2), L_2)$. We need this to equal $(0, \\infty)$, which implies $L_2 = \\infty$, a contradiction to $L_2$ being finite.\n*   All possibilities for a strictly decreasing function lead to a contradiction. Thus, no such function exists.\n\n**3. Case 2: `f` is strictly increasing**\n\n*   If $f$ is increasing, $f \\circ f$ is also increasing, which is consistent with $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n*   Let's compare $f(x)$ with $x$. If there were a fixed point $x_0$ such that $f(x_0)=x_0$, then $f(f(x_0))=f(x_0)=x_0$, which would mean $e^{x_0}=x_0$. However, the equation $e^x=x$ has no real solutions (since $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$). Therefore, $f$ has no fixed points.\n*   Since $f$ is continuous with no fixed points, we must have either $f(x) > x$ for all $x$ or $f(x) < x$ for all $x$.\n    *   If $f(x) < x$ for all $x$, then since $f$ is increasing, $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. This would imply $e^x < x$, which is false.\n    *   Therefore, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n*   The fact that $f$ is strictly increasing and satisfies $f(x) > x$ ensures that for any starting point $x_0$, the sequence $x_0, f(x_0), f(f(x_0)), \\ldots$ is strictly increasing.\n*   This structure allows for a multitude of solutions. We can construct these solutions as follows:\n    1.  Choose an arbitrary starting point, for instance, $x_0 = 0$.\n    2.  The value $f(x_0)=f(0)$ must satisfy $x_0 < f(x_0) < f(f(x_0))$. Substituting the values, we need $0 < f(0) < e^0=1$. Let's call $y_0 = f(0)$. So we must have $y_0 \\in (0, 1)$.\n    3.  Choose an arbitrary value for $y_0$ in the interval $(0,1)$. For each choice of $y_0$, we can proceed. Let's fix $y_0 = 1/2$.\n    4.  Now define $f$ on the interval $[x_0, y_0] = [0, 1/2]$. We require $f$ to be a continuous, strictly increasing function that maps the interval $[0, 1/2]$ onto the interval $[f(0), f(1/2)]$. From the governing equation, $f(y_0)=f(f(x_0))=e^{x_0}$, so $f(1/2) = e^0=1$. Thus, we need to define $f$ as a continuous increasing bijection from $[0, 1/2]$ to $[1/2, 1]$.\n    5.  Let $\\phi: [0, 1/2] \\to [1/2, 1]$ be such a function. There are infinitely many ways to choose $\\phi$. For any two distinct such functions $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$, the resulting solutions for $f$ will be different. The number of such functions $\\phi$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. For example, for every real number $\\alpha > 0$, the function $\\phi(x) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}(2x)^\\alpha$ is a valid choice, giving a family of solutions parameterized by $\\alpha$. More complex constructions show there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices.\n    6.  Once $f$ is defined on the initial interval $[x_0, y_0]$, its definition is uniquely determined everywhere else by the functional equation.\n        *   For $x \\in [y_0, e^{x_0}]$, we can write $x=f(w)$ for some unique $w \\in [x_0, y_0]$. We must define $f(x) = f(f(w)) = e^w$.\n        *   This process can be continued to define $f$ on a sequence of intervals that covers $[x_0, \\infty)$.\n        *   Similarly, we can extend the definition backwards to cover $(-\\infty, x_0)$.\n    7.  The construction is guaranteed to produce a continuous, strictly increasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that solves the equation.\n\n**4. Conclusion on Cardinality**\n\n*   We have ruled out the possibility of any strictly decreasing solutions.\n*   We have shown a method for constructing strictly increasing solutions. The method has a step with a degree of freedom corresponding to choosing a continuous increasing bijection between two intervals. The number of ways to make this choice is $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n*   This implies that there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ distinct solutions to the equation.\n*   The set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. This is because a continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on a dense subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, such as the set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. The cardinality of such functions is $|\\mathbb{R}^{Q}| = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\times \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   Since the set of solutions is a subset of the set of all continuous functions, its cardinality cannot exceed $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   Given that the cardinality is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ and at most $\\mathfrak{c}$, it must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nFinal answer is the cardinality of the continuum."
