    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the main allotropes of phosphorus.**\nThe element phosphorus (P) can exist in several different structural forms, known as allotropes. The most common and well-characterized allotropes are:\n1.  White Phosphorus\n2.  Red Phosphorus\n3.  Violet Phosphorus\n4.  Black Phosphorus\n\n**Step 2: Determine the color of each pure allotrope.**\nWe need to identify the observable color for each of these distinct forms when they are in their pure state.\n\n*   **White Phosphorus (P₄):**\n    *   In its pure form, this allotrope is a colorless or **white** waxy solid.\n    *   It is often seen with a yellowish tint because it slowly converts to the more stable red allotrope upon exposure to light. However, the color of the pure substance itself is white.\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus (Pₙ):**\n    *   This is a polymeric allotrope. As its name suggests, its characteristic color is **red**.\n    *   The shade can vary from orange-red to dark purplish-red depending on preparation methods and particle size.\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Phosphorus):**\n    *   This is a specific crystalline, polymeric form that is distinct from the more common amorphous red phosphorus.\n    *   Its name accurately describes its color, which is **violet**.\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus:**\n    *   This is the most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus. It has a layered, crystalline structure.\n    *   It appears as a **black**, flaky solid with a metallic sheen, similar in appearance to graphite.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of distinct colors.**\nBased on the analysis of the main allotropes, we have identified four unique colors:\n1.  White\n2.  Red\n3.  Violet\n4.  Black\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Purity:** The question specifies \"pure allotropes.\" The common yellowish appearance of white phosphorus is due to trace amounts of red phosphorus forming, so it is not the color of the pure form.\n*   **Distinction between Allotropes:** Red and Violet phosphorus are sometimes grouped together, but they are structurally distinct. Red phosphorus is generally amorphous, while violet (Hittorf's) phosphorus has a well-defined monoclinic crystal structure. They are considered separate allotropes with distinct colors.\n*   **Excluding Minor/Exotic Forms:** Other named forms like \"scarlet phosphorus\" or \"brown phosphorus\" are generally considered to be less-crystalline varieties of red phosphorus rather than distinct allotropes. \"Blue phosphorus\" is a recently synthesized 2D monolayer (phosphorene) and not a bulk material with a conventional observable color. The question focuses on established, bulk allotropes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere are four primary, well-characterized allotropes of phosphorus, each with its own distinct color. Therefore, four different colors can be observed.\n\n<<<4>>>"
