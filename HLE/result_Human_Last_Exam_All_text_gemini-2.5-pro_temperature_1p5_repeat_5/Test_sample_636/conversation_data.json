    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the state feedback gain matrix `F`.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Problem Statement**\n\nWe are given a linear time-invariant system defined by two matrices, A and B.\n*   State matrix `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n*   Input matrix `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe goal is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system matrix, defined as `A_cl = A + BF`, has its eigenvalues at specific locations in the complex plane.\n*   Desired eigenvalues: `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe eigenvalues of a matrix are the roots of its characteristic polynomial. If the desired eigenvalues are `λ₁ = -1 + j` and `λ₂ = -1 - j`, we can construct the desired characteristic polynomial, `p_des(λ)`.\n\n`p_des(λ) = (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)`\n`p_des(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p_des(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\n\nUsing the difference of squares formula `(a - b)(a + b) = a² - b²`, where `a = (λ + 1)` and `b = j`:\n`p_des(λ) = (λ + 1)² - j²`\n`p_des(λ) = (λ² + 2λ + 1) - (-1)`\n`p_des(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2`\n\nThis is the target characteristic polynomial for our closed-loop matrix `A + BF`.\n\n**3. Define the Closed-Loop System Matrix `A + BF`**\n\nThe state feedback gain matrix `F` must have dimensions compatible for the product `BF`. Since `B` is a 2x2 matrix and the state vector `x` is 2x1, `F` must be a 2x2 matrix. Let's define `F` with unknown elements:\n`F = [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]`\n\nNow, we calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]`\n`BF = [[1*f₁ + 2*f₃, 1*f₂ + 2*f₄], [1*f₁ + 0*f₃, 1*f₂ + 0*f₄]]`\n`BF = [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]`\n\nNext, we form the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f₁ + 2f₃, 1 + f₂ + 2f₄], [1 + f₁, f₂]]`\n\n**4. Simplify the Problem**\n\nIf we calculate the characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` in its current form, we will have an expression with four unknowns (`f₁, f₂, f₃, f₄`). Comparing the coefficients of this polynomial with our desired polynomial will yield two equations. With two equations and four unknowns, the system is underdetermined, meaning there are infinite solutions for `F`.\n\nThis is typical for multi-input systems. Since the problem asks for *a* gain matrix `F`, we can find one of the possible solutions by simplifying `F`. A common approach is to assume one of the system's inputs is not used for feedback, which corresponds to setting a row of `F` to zeros.\n\n*   **Careful point:** This simplification is valid only if the system is still controllable through the remaining input. The system `(A, B)` is controllable, and it can be shown that using only the first input (associated with the first column of B) is sufficient for pole placement.\n\nLet's simplify by setting the second row of `F` to zero: `f₃ = 0` and `f₄ = 0`.\n`F = [[f₁, f₂], [0, 0]]`\n\n**5. Recalculate with the Simplified `F`**\n\nWith this simplified `F`, the closed-loop matrix `A_cl` becomes:\n`BF = [[f₁, f₂], [f₁, f₂]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f₁, f₂], [f₁, f₂]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f₁, 1 + f₂], [1 + f₁, f₂]]`\n\n**6. Find the Actual Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nNow we calculate the characteristic polynomial, `p_act(λ)`, of this simplified `A_cl`:\n`p_act(λ) = det(λI - A_cl)`\n`p_act(λ) = det([[λ - (-1 + f₁), -(1 + f₂)], [-(1 + f₁), λ - f₂]])`\n`p_act(λ) = (λ + 1 - f₁)(λ - f₂) - (-(1 + f₂))(-(1 + f₁))`\n`p_act(λ) = (λ² - f₂λ + λ - f₂) - (f₁λ - f₁f₂ + f₁) - (1 + f₁ + f₂ + f₁f₂)`\n`p_act(λ) = λ² + (1 - f₁ - f₂)λ - (f₂ + f₁ - f₁f₂) - (1 + f₁ + f₂ + f₁f₂)`\nWait, the algebra looks complex, let's re-calculate `(λ+1-f₁)(λ-f₂) - (1+f₂)(1+f₁)` more carefully.\n`p_act(λ) = λ² - f₂λ + λ - f₂ - f₁λ + f₁f₂ - (1 + f₁ + f₂ + f₁f₂)`\n`p_act(λ) = λ² + (1 - f₁ - f₂)λ - f₂ + f₁f₂ - 1 - f₁ - f₂ - f₁f₂`\n`p_act(λ) = λ² + (1 - f₁ - f₂)λ + (-1 - f₁ - 2f₂)`\n\n**7. Equate Coefficients and Solve for `f₁` and `f₂`**\n\nWe now match the coefficients of our actual polynomial, `p_act(λ)`, with those of our desired polynomial, `p_des(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2`.\n\n*   Comparing coefficients of the `λ¹` term:\n    `1 - f₁ - f₂ = 2`\n    `-f₁ - f₂ = 1`\n    `f₁ + f₂ = -1`  (Equation 1)\n\n*   Comparing coefficients of the `λ⁰` term (the constant term):\n    `-1 - f₁ - 2f₂ = 2`\n    `-f₁ - 2f₂ = 3`\n    `f₁ + 2f₂ = -3` (Equation 2)\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for `f₁` and `f₂`:\n1.  `f₁ + f₂ = -1`\n2.  `f₁ + 2f₂ = -3`\n\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n`(f₁ + 2f₂) - (f₁ + f₂) = -3 - (-1)`\n`f₂ = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f₂ = -2` into Equation 1:\n`f₁ + (-2) = -1`\n`f₁ = 1`\n\n**8. Construct the Final Feedback Gain Matrix `F`**\n\nWe have found the values `f₁ = 1` and `f₂ = -2`. With our earlier simplification `f₃ = 0` and `f₄ = 0`, the state feedback gain matrix `F` is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\nThis is one possible solution. Other solutions exist if a different simplification for `F` is chosen."
