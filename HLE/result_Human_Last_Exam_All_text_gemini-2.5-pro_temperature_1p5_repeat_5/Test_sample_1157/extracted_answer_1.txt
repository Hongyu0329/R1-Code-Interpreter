The appropriate management involves a phased approach. **Phase 1 (Immediate)**: First, an urgent medical referral is required to start treatment for her uncontrolled diabetes. Dentally, the sockets of the avulsed teeth (which cannot be replanted after 28 hours) will be cleaned and sutured. Prophylactic antibiotics and analgesics will be prescribed due to her high infection risk. **Phase 2 (Definitive)**: After her diabetes is medically controlled and the sockets have healed for 3-6 months, a definitive prosthesis can be made.
The **cells of interest** are those critical for healing and immunity, whose function is impaired by high blood sugar: **fibroblasts** (for tissue formation), **osteoblasts** (for bone formation), and immune cells like **neutrophils and macrophages** (for infection control).

If choosing a denture, the best option is a **Cast Metal (Cobalt-Chromium) Removable Partial Denture** because it is strong, hygienic, and tooth-supported, which protects the underlying bone.
The **abutment teeth** would be the **Left Second Premolar** and **Left First Molar** for distal support, with a rest on the **Left Central Incisor**. For cross-arch stability and indirect retention, which is crucial, clasps/rests would also be placed on the **Right Canine** and **Right First Molar**. This design distributes forces across multiple strong teeth, ensuring a stable and long-lasting outcome, especially considering her Class III jaw relationship.
