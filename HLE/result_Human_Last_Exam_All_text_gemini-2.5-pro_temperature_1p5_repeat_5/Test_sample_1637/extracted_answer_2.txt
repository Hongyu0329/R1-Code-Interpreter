Yes, changing the amide group to a PEG group is a well-established and highly effective strategy for increasing the aqueous solubility of hydrophobic molecules and would very likely solve the precipitation problem. The addition of a hydrophilic and flexible poly(ethylene glycol) chain would increase the overall polarity of the probe and sterically hinder the aggregation of the hydrophobic thioxanthenone cores, thus keeping the compound dissolved in the cell culture medium.
