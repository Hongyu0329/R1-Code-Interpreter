    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the connectivity of the map $\\phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the map and the problem**\n\nThe question asks for the connectivity of a map $\\phi: A \\to B$, where the source is $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ and the target is $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. A map $f: A \\to B$ is said to be $k$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and an epimorphism (surjection) for $i = k$. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of $f$ being $(k-1)$-connected.\n\nThe map $\\phi$ is the adjoint of the Samelson product map $\\lambda: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the connectivity of the source and target spaces**\n\nWe use the following rules:\n*   $\\Omega X$ (the loop space of $X$) decreases connectivity by 1.\n*   $\\Sigma X$ (the suspension of $X$) increases connectivity by 1.\n*   If $X$ is $m$-connected and $Y$ is $n$-connected, their smash product $X \\wedge Y$ is $(m+n+1)$-connected.\n*   The sphere $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected.\n\n**Connectivity of the source space $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$:**\n1.  $S^4$ is 3-connected. So, $\\Omega S^4$ is $(3-1)=2$-connected.\n2.  $S^6$ is 5-connected. So, $\\Omega S^6$ is $(5-1)=4$-connected.\n3.  The smash product $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected.\n4.  The source space $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\nThis means $\\pi_i(A) = 0$ for all $i \\le 8$.\n\n**Connectivity of the target space $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$:**\n1.  $S^4$ is 3-connected and $S^6$ is 5-connected.\n2.  The smash product $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is $(3+5+1) = 9$-connected.\n3.  The target space $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is $(9-1) = 8$-connected.\nThis means $\\pi_i(B) = 0$ for all $i \\le 8$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the map on low-dimensional homotopy groups**\n\nSince both $A$ and $B$ are 8-connected, the groups $\\pi_i(A)$ and $\\pi_i(B)$ are trivial for $i \\le 8$. Therefore, the map $\\phi_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$ is an isomorphism (the map $0 \\to 0$) for $i \\le 8$.\nAccording to the definition of connectivity, this tells us the map is at least 9-connected. To check for 9-connectivity, we need to analyze $\\phi_*$ on $\\pi_9$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the map on $\\pi_9$**\n\nWe first compute the 9th homotopy groups of $A$ and $B$.\n*   $\\pi_9(A) = \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    By the Hurewicz theorem and the Kunneth formula for homology, the first non-trivial homotopy group of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is in dimension 8, and $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    So, $\\pi_9(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   $\\pi_9(B) = \\pi_9(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n    Similarly, the first non-trivial homotopy group of the 9-connected space $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is in dimension 10, and $\\pi_{10}(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\cong H_{10}(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\cong H_4(S^4) \\otimes H_6(S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    So, $\\pi_9(B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe map $\\phi_*: \\pi_9(A) \\to \\pi_9(B)$ is a map from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$. It is a standard result in homotopy theory that this map, arising from the Samelson product, is an isomorphism on the lowest-dimensional non-trivial homotopy groups.\nThus, $\\phi_*$ is an isomorphism on $\\pi_9$.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the map on $\\pi_{10}$**\n\nSince $\\phi_*$ is an isomorphism for $i<10$, we check for 10-connectivity by determining if $\\phi_{10}$ is an epimorphism.\n*   $\\pi_{10}(A) = \\pi_{10}(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    A known (but non-trivial) calculation shows $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   $\\pi_{10}(B) = \\pi_{10}(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)) \\cong \\pi_{11}(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n    Since $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{10}$ in a range of dimensions, we can approximate $\\pi_{11}(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\approx \\pi_{11}(S^{10}) = \\pi_1^S = \\mathbb{Z}_2$, where $\\pi_1^S$ is the first stable homotopy group of spheres.\nSo, $\\phi_*: \\pi_{10}(A) \\to \\pi_{10}(B)$ is a map $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$. It is another standard result that this map is an epimorphism (it is non-trivial, so its image is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$).\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the connectivity of the map**\n\n*   For $i < 9$, $\\phi_i$ is an isomorphism ($0 \\to 0$).\n*   For $i = 9$, $\\phi_9$ is an isomorphism ($\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$).\n*   For $i = 10$, $\\phi_{10}$ is an epimorphism ($\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$).\n\nCombining these, we see that $\\phi_i$ is an isomorphism for $i < 10$ and an epimorphism for $i=10$. By definition, the map $\\phi$ is 10-connected.\n\n**Step 7: Verify the connectivity is not higher**\n\nTo confirm the connectivity is exactly 10, we must show that the map is not 11-connected. This means showing that $\\phi_*: \\pi_{11}(A) \\to \\pi_{11}(B)$ is not an epimorphism. We can do this by analyzing the homotopy fiber $F_\\phi$ of the map $\\phi$.\nThe long exact sequence in homotopy for the fibration $F_\\phi \\to A \\to B$ includes the segment:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_{11}(A) \\xrightarrow{\\phi_{11}} \\pi_{11}(B) \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\pi_{10}(F_\\phi) \\xrightarrow{i} \\pi_{10}(A) \\xrightarrow{\\phi_{10}} \\pi_{10}(B) \\to \\dots $$\nFor the map $\\phi$ to be 11-connected, its fiber $F_\\phi$ must be 10-connected, which means $\\pi_{10}(F_\\phi)$ must be zero.\nFrom the exact sequence, we have $\\text{Im}(i) = \\text{ker}(\\phi_{10})$. Since $\\phi_{10}: \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is an epimorphism, its kernel is $\\ker(\\phi_{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nSo, the image of the map $i: \\pi_{10}(F_\\phi) \\to \\pi_{10}(A)$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. This implies that the domain of $i$, $\\pi_{10}(F_\\phi)$, cannot be the zero group.\nSince $\\pi_{10}(F_\\phi) \\neq 0$, the fiber $F_\\phi$ is not 10-connected. This implies that the map $\\phi$ is not 11-connected.\n\nTherefore, the connectivity of the map is exactly 10."
