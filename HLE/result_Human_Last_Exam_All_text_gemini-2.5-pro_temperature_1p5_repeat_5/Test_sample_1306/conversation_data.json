    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage of irreducible objects in the category of indecomposable finite-dimensional $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ representations for $q$ a primitive third root of unity.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algebraic Structure\nLet $q$ be a primitive third root of unity, i.e., $q=e^{2\\pi i / 3}$. The order of $q$ is $l=3$.\nThe algebra in question is the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$, often denoted simply as $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. It is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra over $\\mathbb{C}$ of dimension $l^3=3^3=27$.\nThe category of finite-dimensional representations of this algebra is of finite representation type, which means there is a finite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations. Our goal is to count them.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Irreducible Representations\nThe irreducible (or simple) representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ are highest weight modules. The possible highest weights $\\lambda$ are constrained by the relation $K^3=1$ in the algebra, which means any eigenvalue of $K$ must be a third root of unity. So, $\\lambda \\in \\{1, q, q^2\\}$. Each of these gives rise to a distinct simple module:\n1.  **$L(1)$**: The module with highest weight $\\lambda=1$. This is the one-dimensional trivial representation. Let's call it $S_1$.\n2.  **$L(q)$**: The module with highest weight $\\lambda=q$. This module is two-dimensional. Let's call it $S_2$.\n3.  **$L(q^2)$**: The module with highest weight $\\lambda=q^2$. This module is three-dimensional. Let's call it $S_3$.\n\nThese are all the simple modules. Thus, there are **3** non-isomorphic irreducible representations.\n\n### Step 3: Identify all Indecomposable Representations\nThe category of representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ for $l=3$ is well-understood. We can determine the complete list of indecomposable modules by analyzing the block structure and extensions between simple modules.\n1.  **Simple Modules**: The 3 simple modules ($S_1, S_2, S_3$) are by definition indecomposable.\n2.  **Projective Modules**: The simple module $S_3$ (of dimension $l=3$) is also projective. Thus, its projective cover is itself, $P(S_3) = S_3$. $S_3$ forms a block of its own.\n3.  **The Principal Block**: The modules $S_1$ and $S_2$ belong to the principal block. This block contains all the remaining indecomposable modules. For a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra, this block is a self-injective algebra.\n4.  **Extensions between Simples**: We examine the first extension groups, $\\mathrm{Ext}^1(S_i, S_j)$. For the principal block with $l=3$, we have:\n    *   $\\dim \\mathrm{Ext}^1(S_1, S_2) = 1$\n    *   $\\dim \\mathrm{Ext}^1(S_2, S_1) = 1$\n    *   All other $\\mathrm{Ext}^1$ groups between simples in this block are zero.\n    This gives us two non-simple, indecomposable modules of length 2:\n    *   **$M_{21}$**: The unique non-split extension $0 \\to S_1 \\to M_{21} \\to S_2 \\to 0$. It has socle $S_1$ and head $S_2$. Its dimension is $\\dim(S_1) + \\dim(S_2) = 1+2=3$.\n    *   **$M_{12}$**: The unique non-split extension $0 \\to S_2 \\to M_{12} \\to S_1 \\to 0$. It has socle $S_2$ and head $S_1$. Its dimension is $\\dim(S_2) + \\dim(S_1) = 2+1=3$.\n5.  **Projective Covers**: $S_1$ and $S_2$ are not projective, so their projective covers, $P(S_1)$ and $P(S_2)$, are additional indecomposable modules.\n    *   **$P(S_1)$**: The projective cover of $S_1$. For this self-injective block, it must have socle $S_1$ and head $S_1$. Its radical must be an indecomposable module with head $S_2$ and socle $S_1$. This is precisely the module $M_{21}$. So $P(S_1)$ has composition factors $S_1, S_2, S_1$ (from head to socle). Its dimension is $1+2+1=4$.\n    *   **$P(S_2)$**: The projective cover of $S_2$. It has socle $S_2$ and head $S_2$. Its radical must be $M_{12}$. So $P(S_2)$ has composition factors $S_2, S_1, S_2$. Its dimension is $2+1+2=5$.\n\n### Step 4: Count and Calculate the Percentage\nLet's list all non-isomorphic indecomposable modules:\n1.  $S_1$ (irreducible, dim 1)\n2.  $S_2$ (irreducible, dim 2)\n3.  $S_3$ (irreducible and projective, dim 3)\n4.  $M_{21}$ (indecomposable, dim 3)\n5.  $M_{12}$ (indecomposable, dim 3)\n6.  $P(S_1)$ (indecomposable projective, dim 4)\n7.  $P(S_2)$ (indecomposable projective, dim 5)\n\nIn total, there are **7** non-isomorphic indecomposable representations.\n\nThe number of irreducible representations is 3.\nThe total number of indecomposable representations is 7.\n\nThe percentage of objects of $C$ (isomorphism classes of indecomposable representations) that are irreducible is:\n$$ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{\\text{Number of irreducible representations}}{\\text{Total number of indecomposable representations}} \\times 100\\% $$\n$$ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{3}{7} \\times 100\\% \\approx 42.857... \\% $$\n\nFinal Answer: The question asks for the percentage. We provide this value.\n\n<<<42.857>>>"
