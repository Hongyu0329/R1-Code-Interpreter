No, polynucleotides are not, structurally, polysaccharides. They differ fundamentally in their monomeric units (nucleotides vs. monosaccharides), backbone composition (sugar-phosphate vs. sugar-only), the chemical bonds linking the monomers (phosphodiester vs. glycosidic), and their elemental makeup (polynucleotides contain nitrogen and phosphorus, which polysaccharides lack).
