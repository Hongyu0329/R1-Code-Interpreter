    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Geometric Shape in Question**\n\nThe question asks about the \"outer-hull of the great icosahedron\".\n*   The **great icosahedron** is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra. It is composed of 20 intersecting equilateral triangles.\n*   The **outer-hull** is another term for the **convex hull**. The convex hull of a geometric object is the smallest convex shape that completely encloses it.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Convex Hull of the Great Icosahedron**\n\nTo find the convex hull of the great icosahedron, we need to consider its vertices.\n*   The great icosahedron has 12 vertices.\n*   A key property of the great icosahedron is that its vertices are in the same positions as the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n*   The convex hull of a set of points (or a polyhedron defined by them) is the convex polyhedron formed by taking those points as its vertices.\n*   Therefore, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a **regular icosahedron**.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Task: Triangulating the Surface**\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating\" the surface of this convex hull (the regular icosahedron).\n*   A **triangulation** of a surface means dividing it into a set of non-overlapping triangles whose union is the entire surface.\n*   The surface of a regular icosahedron is, by its very definition, composed of 20 triangular faces.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Minimal Number of Triangles**\n\n*   The set of the 20 faces of the regular icosahedron already forms a perfect triangulation of its surface.\n*   The question asks for the *minimal* number of triangles. Since the surface is composed of 20 distinct, non-coplanar triangular faces, any triangulation must have at least 20 triangles to cover the surface.\n*   As we have found a valid triangulation with exactly 20 triangles (the faces themselves), this is the minimal number.\n\n**Step 5: Use Euler's Formula for Verification**\n\nWe can verify this result using topology. The surface of an icosahedron is topologically equivalent to a sphere. For any triangulation of a sphere:\n*   Let V be the number of vertices, E the number of edges, and F the number of triangular faces.\n*   Euler's formula states: V - E + F = 2.\n*   In any triangulation, each edge is shared by exactly two triangles, and each triangle has three edges. Thus, 2E = 3F.\n*   We can solve for F in terms of V:\n    *   From 2E = 3F, we get E = 3F/2.\n    *   Substitute this into Euler's formula: V - (3F/2) + F = 2.\n    *   V - F/2 = 2.\n    *   F = 2V - 4.\n*   To minimize the number of triangles (F), we must use the minimum possible number of vertices (V). To define the shape of the icosahedron, we must use at least its own vertices.\n*   A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices. So, the minimum V is 12.\n*   Plugging V = 12 into the formula: F = 2(12) - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20.\n*   This confirms that the minimal number of triangles in any triangulation of a shape defined by 12 vertices (like an icosahedron) is 20.\n\n**Step 6: Consider the \"Visible from the Outside\" Clause**\n\nThis phrase reinforces that we are concerned with the external surface of the shape. For a convex object like the regular icosahedron, all its faces are on the exterior and thus are visible from the outside. This confirms that our interpretation of analyzing the surface of the convex hull is correct.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate the outer-hull (convex hull) of the great icosahedron is equal to the number of faces of its convex hull, which is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron has 20 faces.\n\n<<<20>>>"
