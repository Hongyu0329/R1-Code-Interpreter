    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image.\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique axis, meaning its properties are the same in a given direction and its opposite.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity:** The crystal structure allows for the rotation of the plane of polarized light.\n\n**2. Analyze the \"Careful Points\"**\n\n*   **Point 1: The Definition of \"Symmetry for Optical Activity\"**\n    This is the most critical point. There is a potential contradiction between being \"achiral\" and being \"optically active\".\n    *   **Strict/Classical Definition:** Optical activity is only possible in chiral crystal classes. Chiral classes are those that lack *any* improper rotation axes (i.e., no center of inversion and no mirror planes). Under this definition, an \"achiral\" crystal class cannot be optically active, and the answer to the question would be \"none\".\n    *   **Modern/Physical Definition:** The physical property underlying optical activity is described by the gyration tensor. This tensor is non-zero for *any* crystal class that lacks a center of symmetry (inversion center, `ī`). These are known as non-centrosymmetric classes. In this broader sense, 21 of the 32 crystal classes \"have the correct symmetry for optical activity\". In the achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes, the optical activity may be masked or only observable along specific directions, but it is not forbidden by symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion for Analysis:** Given the request for a detailed analysis, we will proceed with the modern definition, as it reveals the nuance of the topic. So, **\"symmetry for optical activity\" = non-centrosymmetric**.\n\n*   **Point 2: The Definition of Achiral Symmetry**\n    A crystal class is achiral if it possesses at least one improper rotation operation. These are:\n    *   Center of inversion (`ī` or `-1`)\n    *   Mirror plane (`m`, which is `2̄`)\n    *   Rotoinversion axes (`3̄`, `4̄`, `6̄`)\n\n*   **Point 3: The Definition of Non-Polar Symmetry**\n    A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique directional axis. The presence of a center of inversion, or multiple rotation axes in different orientations, or a mirror plane perpendicular to a rotation axis will render a class non-polar. There are 10 specific polar classes (which are also pyroelectric). Our target classes must not be one of these 10.\n\n**3. Acquiring the Answer Step-by-Step**\n\n*   **Step A: Start with all classes that have the symmetry for optical activity.**\n    Based on our interpretation, these are the 21 **non-centrosymmetric** crystal classes:\n    1, 2, m, 222, mm2, 3, 32, 3m, 4, 4̄, 422, 4mm, 4̄2m, 6, 6̄, 622, 6mm, 6̄m2, 23, 432, 4̄3m\n\n*   **Step B: Filter for Achiral classes.**\n    Now we must remove all the chiral classes from the list in Step A. A class is chiral if it contains only proper rotation axes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6). The 11 chiral classes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432.\n    Removing these from our list of 21 leaves the 10 **non-centrosymmetric and achiral** classes:\n    m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, 4̄, 4̄2m, 6̄, 6̄m2, 4̄3m\n\n*   **Step C: Filter for Non-polar classes.**\n    Finally, we take our list from Step B and remove any classes that are polar. The 10 polar (pyroelectric) classes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm.\n    Let's check our list of 10 candidates against the polar list:\n    *   `m` is polar. Remove it.\n    *   `mm2` is polar. Remove it.\n    *   `3m` is polar. Remove it.\n    *   `4mm` is polar. Remove it.\n    *   `6mm` is polar. Remove it.\n    *   `4̄` is not polar. Keep it.\n    *   `4̄2m` is not polar. Keep it.\n    *   `6̄` is not polar. Keep it.\n    *   `6̄m2` is not polar. Keep it.\n    *   `4̄3m` is not polar. Keep it.\n\n**4. Final Answer Derivation**\nThe filtering process leaves us with five crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions of the question. They are non-centrosymmetric (allowing for optical activity), achiral (containing improper rotations), and non-polar (not having a unique axis).\n\nThe final list of crystal classes is:\n*   **4̄** (Schoenflies: S₄)\n*   **6̄** (Schoenflies: C₃h)\n*   **4̄2m** (Schoenflies: D₂d)\n*   **6̄m2** (Schoenflies: D₃h)\n*   **4̄3m** (Schoenflies: Td)\n\n<<<The five crystal classes are 4̄, 6̄, 4̄2m, 6̄m2, and 4̄3m.>>>"
