    "Answering the question: \"How many power subgroups are there in the generalized quaternion group of size 128?\" requires a step-by-step analysis of the group's structure and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Generalized Quaternion Group Q_128**\n\nA \"power subgroup\" is another term for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element of the group. The question is asking for the number of distinct cyclic subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of order 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $2^{n+1}$ (for $n \\ge 2$) is given by the presentation:\n$Q_{2^{n+1}} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2^n} = 1, x^{2^{n-1}} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$\n\nFor our group of size 128, we have $128 = 2^7$. So, $n+1=7$, which implies $n=6$.\nThe presentation for $Q_{128}$ is:\n$Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$\n\nThe elements of $Q_{128}$ can be uniquely written in the form $x^k$ or $x^k y$ for $0 \\le k < 64$. This gives a total of $64 + 64 = 128$ elements.\nThe group has a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Count the Cyclic Subgroups**\n\nTo find all cyclic subgroups, we can consider the subgroups generated by each element of $Q_{128}$. We can partition the elements into two disjoint sets:\n1.  Elements within the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n2.  Elements outside the subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$, which are of the form $x^k y$.\n\n**Case 1: Cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$**\n\nThe subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64. The number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order $m$ is equal to the number of divisors of $m$, denoted $\\tau(m)$. For each divisor $d$ of $m$, there is exactly one subgroup of order $d$.\n\n*   The order of $\\langle x \\rangle$ is $m=64$.\n*   We need to find the number of divisors of 64. Since $64 = 2^6$, the divisors are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6$.\n*   The number of divisors is $\\tau(64) = 6+1=7$.\n*   These 7 subgroups are $\\langle x \\rangle$, $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$, $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$, $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$, $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$, $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$, and $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$.\n*   All of these are cyclic by definition, and they are all distinct.\n\nSo, there are **7** cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n**Case 2: Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $x^k y$**\n\nLet's consider an element $g = x^k y$ where $0 \\le k < 64$. We first determine the order of such an element.\n*   $g^2 = (x^k y)^2 = x^k y x^k y$.\n*   Using the relation $yx = x^{-1}y$, we get $yx^k = x^{-k}y$.\n*   So, $g^2 = x^k (x^{-k}y) y = (x^k x^{-k}) y^2 = y^2$.\n*   From the group presentation, we know $y^2 = x^{32}$. So, $g^2 = x^{32}$.\n*   The order of $x^{32}$ is $\\frac{o(x)}{\\gcd(32, o(x))} = \\frac{64}{\\gcd(32, 64)} = \\frac{64}{32} = 2$.\n*   Since $g^2 = x^{32}$, it follows that $g^4 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n*   Therefore, every element of the form $x^k y$ has order 4.\n\nThis means that any element not in $\\langle x \\rangle$ generates a cyclic subgroup of order 4. Now, we must count how many *distinct* subgroups of this type exist.\n\n*   Let's find when two such subgroups, $\\langle x^k y \\rangle$ and $\\langle x^j y \\rangle$, are the same.\n*   A cyclic group of order 4, say $\\langle g \\rangle$, has two generators: $g$ and $g^3$. The generators of $\\langle x^k y \\rangle$ are $x^k y$ and $(x^k y)^3$.\n*   $(x^k y)^3 = (x^k y)^2(x^k y) = x^{32} x^k y = x^{k+32} y$.\n*   So, $\\langle x^k y \\rangle = \\langle x^j y \\rangle$ if and only if $x^j y$ is one of the generators of $\\langle x^k y \\rangle$.\n*   This means either $x^j y = x^k y$ or $x^j y = x^{k+32} y$.\n*   This implies either $j \\equiv k \\pmod{64}$ or $j \\equiv k+32 \\pmod{64}$.\n*   These two conditions can be combined into a single condition: $j \\equiv k \\pmod{32}$.\n*   This means that the subgroups $\\langle x^k y \\rangle$ are distinct for each residue class modulo 32. We can choose $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, 31$ to get all the unique subgroups.\n*   Thus, there are **32** distinct cyclic subgroups of this type.\n\n**Careful Point: No Overlaps**\n\nThe subgroups found in Case 1 are all subgroups of $\\langle x \\rangle$. This means all their elements are powers of $x$. The subgroups found in Case 2 all contain elements of the form $x^k y$, which are not powers of $x$. Therefore, the set of subgroups from Case 1 and the set of subgroups from Case 2 are disjoint.\n\n**Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\nThe total number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) is the sum of the numbers of subgroups from the two disjoint cases.\n\nTotal number = (Number from Case 1) + (Number from Case 2)\nTotal number = 7 + 32 = 39\n\nSo, there are 39 power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n<<<39>>>"
