    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Stats:**\n    First, we need to find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player. By examining the Terraria source code (specifically for NPC ID 4), we can find its stats.\n    *   In Normal Mode, its base `lifeMax` is 2800.\n    *   The code includes a specific check for Expert Mode: `if (Main.expertMode) { lifeMax = 3640; ... }`.\n    *   So, the starting base health for our calculation in Expert Mode is **3640**. This value is set before any multiplayer scaling is applied.\n\n2.  **Understand Multiplayer Health Scaling:**\n    Next, we need to understand how the game increases boss health based on the number of players. This is often called \"health scaling\".\n    *   In Expert Mode, the game calculates a health multiplier based on the number of active players.\n    *   The formula used to find this multiplier is `1.0 + (NumberOfPlayers * 0.35)`. Let's call the number of players `N`. The formula is `1 + 0.35N`.\n    *   This multiplier is applied directly to the boss's Expert Mode base health.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Health Equation:**\n    Combining the base health and the multiplayer scaling, we can write a formula for the Eye of Cthulhu's final health, `H`, as a function of the number of players, `N`.\n    *   `H(N) = (Expert Base Health) * (Multiplayer Multiplier)`\n    *   `H(N) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * N)`\n\n4.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:**\n    The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. This requires us to analyze the behavior of the formula `H(N)` as `N` approaches infinity (`N -> ∞`).\n    *   Mathematically, as `N` increases, the term `(1 + 0.35 * N)` increases without any upper bound. This means the resulting health, `H(N)`, also approaches infinity.\n    *   `lim (N -> ∞) [3640 * (1 + 0.35N)] = ∞`\n\n5.  **Consider Technical Limitations (The \"Careful Point\"):**\n    While the mathematical formula goes to infinity, the question is about a video game's source code. We must consider the technical limitations of the game engine.\n    *   In Terraria's source code, an NPC's health (`lifeMax`) is stored as a 32-bit signed integer (`int`).\n    *   A 32-bit signed integer has a maximum possible value, which is 2^31 - 1, or **2,147,483,647**.\n    *   If the calculation `3640 * (1 + 0.35 * N)` results in a number greater than this value, it will cause an integer overflow when stored in the `lifeMax` variable, leading to unexpected behavior (like having negative health).\n    *   Therefore, the true *theoretical maximum health* that the game can handle for any NPC is limited by the maximum value of its data type.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The question assumes an \"infinite number of players,\" which means we can assume `N` is large enough for the health calculation to reach this data type limit. The health scaling formula increases continuously and will eventually exceed 2,147,483,647. At that point, the game engine's limitation becomes the deciding factor. Thus, the theoretical maximum health the Eye of Cthulhu can have is the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\nThe maximum value for a signed 32-bit integer is 2^31 - 1.\n`2^31 = 2,147,483,648`\n`2,147,483,648 - 1 = 2,147,483,647`\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
