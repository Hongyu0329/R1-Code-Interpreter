    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all edges of the complete graph $K_{35}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Complete Graph \\(K_n\\):** We are given the complete graph $K_n$ with $n=35$. This graph has 35 vertices, and every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n*   **Family of Bipartite Graphs:** We need to find a collection of bipartite graphs, let's call them $B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_k$.\n*   **Covering the Edges:** The union of the edge sets of these bipartite graphs must contain all the edges of $K_{35}$. That is, for any edge $(u,v)$ in $K_{35}$, there must be at least one bipartite graph $B_i$ in our family that contains the edge $(u,v)$. The vertices of each $B_i$ are a subset of the vertices of $K_{35}$.\n*   **Quantity to Minimize:** The question asks for the \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\". In the context of graph decompositions and coverings, this standardly refers to the sum of the number of vertices in each graph of the family. If $|V(B_i)|$ is the number of vertices in graph $B_i$, we need to find the minimum possible value of the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(B_i)|$.\n\n**2. Formulate the Problem Mathematically**\n\nLet $V$ be the set of 35 vertices of $K_{35}$.\nWe are looking for a family of bipartite graphs $\\{B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_k\\}$ such that:\n1.  Each $B_i$ is a subgraph of $K_{35}$ (i.e., $V(B_i) \\subseteq V$ and $E(B_i) \\subseteq E(K_{35})$).\n2.  $\\bigcup_{i=1}^{k} E(B_i) = E(K_{35})$.\nOur goal is to minimize the total sum of vertices: $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(B_i)|$.\n\n**3. Identify the Relevant Mathematical Result**\n\nThis is a well-known problem in extremal graph theory. The solution relies on a theorem by Helge Tverberg (1982).\n\n**Tverberg's Theorem:** If the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ are covered by a family of $k$ bipartite graphs $B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_k$, then the sum of the number of vertices in these graphs satisfies the inequality:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(B_i)| \\ge n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil $$\nThis theorem provides a lower bound for the quantity we want to minimize.\n\n**4. Check if the Lower Bound is Achievable (Upper Bound)**\n\nTo show that this lower bound is the minimum value, we need to demonstrate a construction that achieves this sum.\n\n*   **Determine the number of graphs:** First, let's calculate the value of $\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$ for $n=35$.\n    *   We know that $2^5 = 32$ and $2^6 = 64$.\n    *   Since $32 < 35 < 64$, it follows that $5 < \\log_2 35 < 6$.\n    *   Therefore, the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\\log_2 35$ is $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6$.\n\n*   **Construct the covering family:** We can construct a covering family of $k=6$ bipartite graphs as follows:\n    1.  **Assign Addresses:** Assign a unique binary vector (or \"address\") of length 6 to each of the 35 vertices. Let $c(v)$ be the 6-bit binary vector assigned to vertex $v$. This is possible because there are $2^6 = 64$ unique 6-bit vectors, which is more than enough for the 35 vertices.\n    2.  **Define Bipartite Graphs:** For each coordinate position $j$ from 1 to 6, define a bipartite graph $B_j$. The vertex set of $B_j$ will be all 35 vertices of $K_{35}$. The partitions of $B_j$ are defined based on the $j$-th bit of the vertices' addresses:\n        *   The first partition, $U_j$, contains all vertices $v$ whose address $c(v)$ has a 0 in the $j$-th position.\n        *   The second partition, $W_j$, contains all vertices $v$ whose address $c(v)$ has a 1 in the $j$-th position.\n        The edges of $B_j$ are all possible edges between a vertex in $U_j$ and a vertex in $W_j$.\n    3.  **Verify the Cover:** Consider any two distinct vertices, $u$ and $w$. Since their addresses $c(u)$ and $c(w)$ are unique, they must differ in at least one bit position. Let's say they differ in the $j$-th position. This means one address has a 0 and the other has a 1 at this position. By our construction, one vertex belongs to $U_j$ and the other to $W_j$. Therefore, the edge $(u,w)$ is included in the graph $B_j$. Since this is true for any pair of vertices, the family of graphs $\\{B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4, B_5, B_6\\}$ covers all the edges of $K_{35}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Vertices for the Construction**\n\nIn our construction, we have $k=6$ bipartite graphs. For each graph $B_j$, its vertex set $V(B_j)$ includes all 35 vertices of $K_{35}$.\n*   $|V(B_j)| = 35$ for each $j \\in \\{1, \\ldots, 6\\}$.\n*   The sum of the number of vertices is $\\sum_{j=1}^{6} |V(B_j)| = \\sum_{j=1}^{6} 35 = 6 \\times 35$.\n\n**Calculation:**\n$6 \\times 35 = 210$.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\n*   From Tverberg's theorem, the minimum possible sum of vertices is at least $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil = 35 \\times 6 = 210$.\n*   Our construction achieves exactly this sum.\n*   Therefore, the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all edges of $K_{35}$ is 210.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph $K_{35}$ is given by the formula $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\nFor $n=35$:\n1.  Calculate $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil$:\n    *   $2^5 = 32$\n    *   $2^6 = 64$\n    *   Since $32 < 35 < 64$, $\\log_2 35$ is between 5 and 6.\n    *   $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6$.\n2.  Calculate the final result:\n    *   $35 \\times 6 = 210$."
