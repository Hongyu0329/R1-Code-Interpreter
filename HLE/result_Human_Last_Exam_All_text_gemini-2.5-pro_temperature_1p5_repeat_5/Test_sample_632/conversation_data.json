    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n    *   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n    *   **Action:** It was \"removed\".\n    *   **Timeframe:** In 1950.\n    *   **Authority:** The \"city administration\".\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Elimination:**\n    *   What are the main features of the Piazza della Rotonda? The Pantheon itself, the Fontana del Pantheon (the fountain with the obelisk in the center), and the surrounding buildings.\n    *   Was the Pantheon altered or anything removed from it in 1950? No major features were removed from the Pantheon church at that time.\n    *   Was the fountain removed? No, the Fontana del Pantheon is still there today.\n    *   Were any of the surrounding buildings demolished? There is no historical record of a major building in the square being demolished in 1950 for this reason.\n    *   Therefore, the feature must be something else that was part of the square's fabric but is no longer present.\n\n3.  **Researching Historical Changes:**\n    *   A search into the history of Roman public transportation reveals that the city had an extensive tram network in the first half of the 20th century.\n    *   Historical photographs and maps of the Piazza della Rotonda from the period before 1950 show tram tracks running through the square.\n\n4.  **Identifying the \"Unique\" Feature:**\n    *   The tram line in the Piazza della Rotonda was not just a straight line passing through. It formed a complete, circular loop or \"ring\" around the central fountain (Fontana del Pantheon).\n    *   This circular tram track was a highly unusual and distinctive feature of urban design, allowing trams to turn around in the very center of the bustling square. It defined the flow of traffic and people in the piazza for decades.\n\n5.  **Confirming the Removal and Date:**\n    *   Following World War II, Rome's city administration began a process of modernizing public transport. This involved replacing many tram lines, especially in the crowded historic center, with more flexible bus routes.\n    *   The tram lines in the historic center were considered noisy, outdated, and aesthetically intrusive.\n    *   The dismantling of these lines occurred throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s. The tram ring in the Piazza della Rotonda was a famous casualty of this modernization process, and its removal fits the 1950 timeframe specified in the question.\n\n6.  **Addressing the term \"Architectural Feature\":**\n    *   While a tram line is more accurately described as \"urban infrastructure,\" its permanent, structural, and uniquely designed nature within the context of a historic square allows it to be considered an \"architectural feature\" in a broader sense. It was a man-made element that profoundly shaped the space's design, appearance, and function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe unique feature that existed in the Piazza della Rotonda until its removal around 1950 was a circular tram track that formed a ring around the central fountain.\n\n<<<A circular tram ring>>>"
