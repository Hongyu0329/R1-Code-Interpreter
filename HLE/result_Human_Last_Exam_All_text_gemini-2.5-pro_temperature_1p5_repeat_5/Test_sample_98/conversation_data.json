    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Setup:**\n    *   **The Object:** The tank is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 identical edges, and 12 vertices. A key property is that it is centrally symmetric, meaning it has a center point of inversion.\n    *   **The Orientation:** The tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of the equilateral triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base.\n    *   **The Filling Level:** The tank is \"half-filled with water.\" This means the volume of the water is exactly one-half of the total volume of the icosahedron.\n\n2.  **Determine the Position of the Water Surface:**\n    *   Due to gravity, the surface of the water will be a flat, horizontal plane.\n    *   Since the base of the tank is horizontal, the water's surface must be parallel to the base face.\n    *   Because the icosahedron has a center of symmetry, any plane passing through this center divides the icosahedron into two parts of equal volume.\n    *   Since the tank is exactly half-filled, the horizontal water surface must be the specific plane that passes through the geometric center of the icosahedron.\n\n3.  **Identify the Geometric Shape:**\n    *   Combining the points from the previous step, the problem is reduced to a purely geometric question: What is the shape of the cross-section of a regular icosahedron when it is sliced by a plane that passes through its center and is parallel to one of its faces?\n    *   To visualize this, imagine the icosahedron resting on its triangular base. There will be an identical triangular face at the very top, parallel to the base. The central slicing plane lies exactly halfway between this top and bottom face.\n    *   This plane does not pass through any of the icosahedron's vertices. Instead, it cuts through a set of its edges.\n    *   Due to the high degree of symmetry, we can determine the shape of this cross-section. The axis connecting the centers of the top and bottom faces is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. The cross-section must also possess this 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n    *   The plane cuts through 6 of the icosahedron's edges that connect the lower half of the figure to the upper half.\n    *   The intersection points of the plane with these 6 edges form the vertices of the shape of the water surface.\n    *   Because of the overall symmetry of the icosahedron (including inversion symmetry through the center), these 6 intersection points are equidistant from the center and are spaced equally around it. They form a **regular hexagon**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to recognize that \"half-filled\" in a centrally symmetric object implies the water level is at the center plane.\n*   The orientation \"standing on one of its faces\" is key, as it defines the orientation of the central plane (parallel to the base face).\n*   The high symmetry of the regular icosahedron is what dictates that the resulting hexagon is regular, not just any hexagon. If the object were not a regular icosahedron, the shape could be an irregular polygon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhen the icosahedron tank is placed on a face and filled to half its volume, the water surface forms a horizontal plane that passes through the center of the icosahedron. The intersection of this plane with the icosahedron is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
