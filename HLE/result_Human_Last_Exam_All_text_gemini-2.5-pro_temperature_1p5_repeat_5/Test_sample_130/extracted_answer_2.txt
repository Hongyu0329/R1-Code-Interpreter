The edges of the image become smoother, curved sections straighten, and shapes defined by closed boundaries shrink until they disappear. This happens because the edge movement is governed by its local curvature; convex sections of a boundary move inwards and concave sections are filled in, a process that minimizes the total edge length in the image.
