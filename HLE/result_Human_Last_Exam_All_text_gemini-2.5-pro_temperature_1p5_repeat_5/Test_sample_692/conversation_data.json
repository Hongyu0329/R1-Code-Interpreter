    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core of the Question\nThe question asks for the \"earliest known date recorded...in the aboriginal writing system.\" This requires a few key elements to be present simultaneously:\n*   **An artifact:** A physical object like a stela (stone monument), tablet, or other inscribed item.\n*   **A writing system:** A system of glyphs or characters developed by an indigenous American civilization.\n*   **A calendar system:** The writing must represent a date within a formal calendar.\n*   **Specificity:** The date needs to be specific enough to be placed on a linear timeline, not just a repeating day name (e.g., \"5 Flint\"). The Mesoamerican Long Count calendar is the primary system that allows for this type of specific, non-repeating dating over long periods.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Potential Civilizations and Systems\nThe most advanced and earliest dating systems in the pre-Columbian Americas were developed in Mesoamerica. Key candidates include:\n*   **Olmec/Epi-Olmec:** Successors to the Olmec civilization are credited with some of the earliest use of the Long Count calendar.\n*   **Zapotec:** Developed very early writing and a calendar system in the Oaxaca Valley.\n*   **Maya:** Famously used the Long Count calendar extensively, but their earliest recorded dates are later than those of the Epi-Olmec.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Artifacts and Their Dates\nWe must differentiate between the earliest *writing* and the earliest *recorded date*. While Zapotec writing from sites like San José Mogote (c. 600 BCE) is among the oldest, it typically features names of days within the 260-day ritual calendar. These are not fixed to a specific year. For a specific, absolute date, we look to artifacts inscribed with the Long Count.\n\nHere are the primary contenders for the earliest Long Count date:\n\n1.  **Tres Zapotes Stela C:**\n    *   **Civilization:** Epi-Olmec.\n    *   **Discovery:** Found in Tres Zapotes, Veracruz, Mexico.\n    *   **The Date:** The monument is inscribed with the Long Count date **7.16.6.16.18**.\n    *   **Modern Calendar Equivalent:** This date corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE**. For many years, this was considered the earliest known date in the Americas.\n\n2.  **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2:**\n    *   **Civilization:** The inscription is from the period of transition between the Zoque and Maya cultures in the region.\n    *   **Discovery:** Found at the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico.\n    *   **The Date:** This stela fragment is inscribed with the Long Count date **7.16.3.2.13**.\n    *   **Modern Calendar Equivalent:** This date corresponds to **December 7, 36 BCE**.\n\n### Step 4: Comparing the Candidates and Reaching a Conclusion\nComparing the dates from the two key artifacts:\n*   Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2: **36 BCE**\n*   Tres Zapotes Stela C: **32 BCE**\n\nThe date on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is four years earlier than the date on Tres Zapotes Stela C. Therefore, it is currently the record holder.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **Linear vs. Cyclical Time:** The Long Count calendar is crucial because it tracks days in a linear fashion from a mythical start date (in 3114 BCE), allowing archaeologists to pinpoint dates with precision. This is different from the cyclical 260-day and 365-day calendars that were used concurrently.\n*   **Writing vs. Dated Inscription:** The Cascajal Block (c. 900 BCE) may represent the earliest *writing* in Mesoamerica, but it does not contain a decipherable date.\n*   **Correlation Constant:** The conversion of Long Count dates to the Gregorian calendar depends on a \"correlation constant.\" The most widely accepted is the GMT (Goodman-Martínez-Thompson) correlation, which is used for the dates provided above.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nBased on the analysis, the earliest known recorded date is found on **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2**. The inscription, written in a Mesoamerican aboriginal script, records a Long Count date that translates to December of 36 BCE in the modern calendar.\n\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
