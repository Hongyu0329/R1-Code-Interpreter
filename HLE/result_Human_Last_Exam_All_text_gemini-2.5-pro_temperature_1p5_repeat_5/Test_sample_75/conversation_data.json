    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Second Great War\"**:\n    The term \"Second Great War\" in StarCraft lore refers to the large-scale conflict depicted throughout the *StarCraft II* trilogy. This includes the events of *Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, *Legacy of the Void*, and the concluding epilogue campaign, *Into the Void*. It is distinct from the first \"Great War,\" which covers the original *StarCraft* and its *Brood War* expansion.\n\n2.  **Determine the Starting Point of the War**:\n    The war begins with the sudden, renewed Zerg invasion of the Koprulu Sector, which serves as the inciting incident for the campaign of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty*. According to the official StarCraft timeline, these events start in the year **2504**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Ending Point of the War**:\n    The war has several major turning points, but it does not truly end until the primary antagonist, the fallen Xel'naga Amon, is permanently defeated. This definitive conclusion occurs in the epilogue campaign, *Into the Void*, where the combined forces of the Terrans, Zerg, and Protoss confront and destroy Amon within the Void itself. This final battle takes place in the year **2506**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Duration**:\n    The war starts in the year 2504 and ends in the year 2506. The conflict spans across parts of three calendar years:\n    *   The events of *Wings of Liberty* and *Heart of the Swarm* occur in **2504**.\n    *   The conflict continues through the year **2505**.\n    *   The final campaigns of *Legacy of the Void* and the *Into the Void* epilogue conclude in **2506**.\n    Therefore, the total elapsed time is more than two full years but less than three full years.\n\n5.  **Round the Duration as Instructed**:\n    The question specifically asks for the duration to be **rounded up** to the nearest whole year. Since the actual duration is a value greater than 2 but less than 3, rounding it up results in 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing Between Wars**: It is critical to differentiate the Second Great War (*StarCraft II*) from the First Great War (*StarCraft* and *Brood War*).\n*   **Identifying the True Conclusion**: The end of the war is not the fall of Arcturus Mengsk or the reclamation of Aiur, but the final destruction of Amon, who was the ultimate threat driving the conflict.\n*   **Correct Interpretation of \"Rounding Up\"**: The instruction is not to round to the nearest integer, but specifically to round *up*. This means any fractional year must be counted as a full year for the purpose of the final answer.\n*   **Timeline Spanning Multiple Years**: A common mistake is to simply subtract the start year from the end year (2506 - 2504 = 2). However, since the war spans *across* parts of three separate years, its duration is greater than two years.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n*   **Start**: 2504\n*   **End**: 2506\n*   **Duration**: Greater than 2 years.\n*   **Rounding Up**: Rounding up a value greater than 2 yields 3.\n\nThe Second Great War lasted approximately 3 years when rounded up.\n\n<<<3>>>"
