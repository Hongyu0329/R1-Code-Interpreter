    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points of the system.**\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$$\nEquilibrium points are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term in the parenthesis is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThis equation has two solutions, which are the equilibrium points:\n$x_1 = 0$\n$x_2 = 1$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point.**\n\nTo determine the stability, we can use the first derivative test. The stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ is determined by the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, denoted as $f'(x)$, at that point.\n- If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium is stable.\n- If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium is unstable.\n- If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and another method must be used.\n\nLet's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$\n$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n*   **For $x_1 = 0$:**\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For $x_2 = 1$:**\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive for this point.\n\nTo analyze the stability of $x=1$, we can use a phase line analysis by checking the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the regions around $x=1$.\n*   **For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x \\in (0,1)$):** Let $x=0.5$.\n    $f(0.5) = -0.5(0.5-1)^2 = -0.5(-0.5)^2 = -0.125 < 0$.\n    This means that for $x \\in (0,1)$, $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving away from $x=1$.\n*   **For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x>1$):** Let $x=2$.\n    $f(2) = -2(2-1)^2 = -2(1)^2 = -2 < 0$.\n    This means that for $x > 1$, $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving towards $x=1$.\n\nThe phase diagram around $x=1$ is `<--- (1) <---`. Since solutions starting from the left of $x=1$ move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is not stable. It is classified as a semi-stable equilibrium, which is a type of unstable equilibrium.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the value of m.**\n\nThe problem states, \"Suppose that $m$ is a number of stable equilibrium\".\nFrom our analysis in Step 2, we have found that there is only one stable equilibrium point: $x=0$.\nThe careful point here is interpreting the phrasing \"a number of stable equilibrium\". This is distinct from \"the number of stable equilibria\".\n*   \"The number of...\" refers to a count (cardinality). In this case, the count of stable equilibria is 1.\n*   \"A number of...\" refers to an element from a set. In this case, it means $m$ is a value $x$ that corresponds to a stable equilibrium.\n\nSince there is only one stable equilibrium point at $x=0$, the value of $m$ is uniquely determined to be this value.\nThus, $m = 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final expression.**\n\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=0$ we found:\n$$ m - 2^{4048} = 0 - 2^{4048} = -2^{4048} $$\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Factoring:** Ensure the polynomial $f(x)$ is factored correctly to find all equilibrium points.\n2.  **Stability Test:** Recognize that the first derivative test can be inconclusive ($f'(x^*)=0$) and be prepared to use another method like phase line analysis.\n3.  **Definition of Stability:** Understand that a stable equilibrium requires solutions from all nearby points to approach it. A semi-stable equilibrium is considered unstable.\n4.  **Interpreting the variable $m$:** The phrasing \"a number of stable equilibrium\" is a crucial detail. It indicates that $m$ is the value of a stable equilibrium point, not the count of how many there are. As there is only one, $m$ is uniquely defined.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  The equilibrium points are the roots of $-x(x-1)^2 = 0$, which are $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n2.  Stability analysis via the sign of $f'(x) = -3x^2+4x-1$ or phase line analysis of $f(x)=-x(x-1)^2$ shows that $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium and $x=1$ is a semi-stable (unstable) equilibrium.\n3.  $m$ is \"a number of stable equilibrium\". Since the only stable equilibrium value is $0$, we must have $m=0$.\n4.  The required calculation is $m - 2^{4048}$, which becomes $0 - 2^{4048}$.\n\nThe final answer is $-2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<-2^{4048}>>>"
