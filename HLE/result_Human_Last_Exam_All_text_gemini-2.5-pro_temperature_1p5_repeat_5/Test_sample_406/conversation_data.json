    "This question asks for the conditions under which a set of three functions `F`, `G`, and `H` possess a \"tripled fixed point\". This is a concept from fixed-point theory, a major topic in mathematical analysis. To answer this, we must first clarify the problem's notation and then apply a suitable fixed-point theorem, typically a generalization of the Banach Contraction Principle.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and List Careful Points\n\n1.  **Function Definitions:** The user has provided `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y`, and `G:Z*Y*X→Z`.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Typo):** There are two definitions for a function `G`. This is a typo. It's logical to assume the user meant three distinct functions, `F`, `G`, and `H`. So the third function should be `H:Z*Y*X→Z`.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Argument Structure):** The argument structures `F(x,y,z)`, `G(y,x,y)`, and `H(z,y,x)` seem asymmetric. In the context of coupled and tripled fixed point theorems, a cyclically symmetric structure is far more common and mathematically elegant. The most plausible intended structure is:\n        *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n        *   `G: Y × Z × X → Y`\n        *   `H: Z × X × Y → Z`\n        We will proceed with this standard, symmetric interpretation as it's the basis for most theorems in this area.\n\n2.  **\"FGH-tripled fixed point\" Definition:** This terminology is not standard, but its meaning can be inferred from the context of similar problems (like coupled fixed points).\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Defining the Fixed Point):** An FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` with `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z` that simultaneously satisfies a system of equations. Based on our assumed function structure, the natural definition is:\n        *   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n        *   `G(y, z, x) = y`\n        *   `H(z, x, y) = z`\n\n3.  **\"Conditions\" for Existence:** The question asks for the conditions that guarantee such a fixed point exists.\n    *   **Careful Point 4 (Mathematical Framework):** These conditions typically depend on the properties of the underlying sets (`X`, `Y`, `Z`) and the functions (`F`, `G`, `H`). The most common framework for such existence theorems is that of **complete metric spaces**. The conditions on the functions usually involve them being **contraction mappings** in some generalized sense.\n\n### Step 2: Acquire the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe will formulate a theorem based on the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem applied to the product space `X × Y × Z`.\n\n#### **A. Problem Setup**\n*   Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be **complete metric spaces**.\n*   Let `F: X × Y × Z → X`, `G: Y × Z × X → Y`, and `H: Z × X × Y → Z` be three functions.\n*   An **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a point `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` such that `F(x, y, z) = x`, `G(y, z, x) = y`, and `H(z, x, y) = z`.\n\n#### **B. The Main Theorem (Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness)**\n\nAn FGH-tripled fixed point exists and is unique if the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Lipschitz-type/Contraction Conditions:** There must exist nine non-negative constants `a₁, a₂, a₃`, `b₁, b₂, b₃`, and `c₁, c₂, c₃` such that for any points `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, and `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`, the following inequalities hold:\n\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ a₁·d_X(x₁, x₂) + a₂·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + a₃·d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁, z₁, x₁), G(y₂, z₂, x₂)) ≤ b₁·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + b₂·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + b₃·d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁, x₁, y₁), H(z₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ c₁·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + c₂·d_X(x₁, x₂) + c₃·d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n\n    These conditions essentially state that the functions don't \"stretch\" distances too much.\n\n2.  **Overall Contraction Condition:** The sum of the coefficients, when grouped according to the variable components, must be less than 1. Specifically:\n\n    *   `(a₁ + b₃ + c₂) < 1`\n    *   `(a₂ + b₁ + c₃) < 1`\n    *   `(a₃ + b₂ + c₁) < 1`\n\n    A simpler, though slightly stronger, way to state this is that the maximum of these three sums is less than 1:\n    `max { (a₁ + b₃ + c₂), (a₂ + b₁ + c₃), (a₃ + b₂ + c₁) } < 1`\n\n#### **C. Justification (Derivation Sketch)**\n\nThe proof of this theorem works by cleverly combining the three functions into one and then applying the famous Banach Fixed-Point Theorem.\n\n1.  **Define a Product Space Operator:** Let `W = X × Y × Z`. We define a single operator `T: W → W` as:\n    `T(x, y, z) = ( F(x, y, z), G(y, z, x), H(z, x, y) )`\n\n2.  **Equivalence of Fixed Points:** Notice that a point `(x, y, z)` is a fixed point of `T` (i.e., `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`) if and only if it is an FGH-tripled fixed point of `(F, G, H)`.\n\n3.  **Define a Metric on the Product Space:** Since `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are complete metric spaces, their product `W` is also a complete metric space. We can define a metric on `W`, for instance, the sum metric:\n    `d_W((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\n4.  **Show T is a Contraction:** The final step is to show that the conditions in part B force the operator `T` to be a contraction mapping on `(W, d_W)`. A mapping is a contraction if `d_W(T(u), T(v)) ≤ k · d_W(u, v)` for some constant `k < 1`.\n\n    Let's expand `d_W(T(x₁,y₁,z₁), T(x₂,y₂,z₂))`:\n    `= d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,z₁,x₁), G(y₂,z₂,x₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,x₁,y₁), H(z₂,x₂,y₂))`\n\n    Now, substitute the three inequalities from Condition 1:\n    `≤ [a₁d_X + a₂d_Y + a₃d_Z] + [b₁d_Y + b₂d_Z + b₃d_X] + [c₁d_Z + c₂d_X + c₃d_Y]`\n    where `d_X` is shorthand for `d_X(x₁, x₂)`, etc.\n\n    Group terms by metric (`d_X`, `d_Y`, `d_Z`):\n    `= (a₁ + b₃ + c₂)d_X + (a₂ + b₁ + c₃)d_Y + (a₃ + b₂ + c₁)d_Z`\n\n    Let `k = max { (a₁ + b₃ + c₂), (a₂ + b₁ + c₃), (a₃ + b₂ + c₁) }`. By Condition 2, we know `k < 1`.\n    `≤ k·d_X + k·d_Y + k·d_Z`\n    `= k · (d_X + d_Y + d_Z) = k · d_W((x₁,y₁,z₁), (x₂,y₂,z₂))`\n\n    Since `k < 1`, the operator `T` is a contraction.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** By the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, a contraction mapping on a complete metric space has a **unique fixed point**. Therefore, there exists a unique FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n---\nThe final answer is a concise statement of these conditions.\n\n<<<The existence of a unique FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions `F: X×Y×Z→X`, `G: Y×Z×X→Y`, and `H: Z×X×Y→Z` is guaranteed under the following conditions:\n1.  **Space Requirement:** `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces.\n2.  **Contraction Requirement:** There exist non-negative constants `a₁, a₂, a₃, b₁, b₂, b₃, c₁, c₂, c₃` such that for all `xᵢ∈X, yᵢ∈Y, zᵢ∈Z`:\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) ≤ a₁·d_X(x₁,x₂) + a₂·d_Y(y₁,y₂) + a₃·d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁,z₁,x₁), G(y₂,z₂,x₂)) ≤ b₁·d_Y(y₁,y₂) + b₂·d_Z(z₁,z₂) + b₃·d_X(x₁,x₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁,x₁,y₁), H(z₂,x₂,y₂)) ≤ c₁·d_Z(z₁,z₂) + c₂·d_X(x₁,x₂) + c₃·d_Y(y₁,y₂)`\n    and the crucial condition on these constants is met:\n    `max { (a₁ + b₃ + c₂), (a₂ + b₁ + c₃), (a₃ + b₂ + c₁) } < 1`>>>"
