    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, identifying the careful points and then deriving the two problems.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Premises:**\n    *   **Premise 1: JTB Definition of Knowledge.** Knowledge is defined as a belief that is simultaneously Justified (J), True (T), and held by a subject (Belief, B). So, Knowledge = J + T + B.\n    *   **Premise 2: Limited Epistemic States.** The only two available epistemic states are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\". This creates a binary system where any cognitive stance towards a proposition must be one or the other. This is a highly artificial constraint.\n    *   **Premise 3: Ignore Gettier Problems.** We must assume that JTB is a perfectly sufficient definition for knowledge. The problems we find cannot be examples of justified true beliefs that fail to be knowledge.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **The Relationship between \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" states:** The premises set up Knowledge and Belief as two distinct, mutually exclusive categories. If you are in the state of Knowledge, you are not in the state of Belief, and vice-versa.\n2.  **The Nature of the \"Belief\" State:** Since Knowledge is JTB, the state of \"Belief\" must logically be any belief that is *not* knowledge. This means the state \"Belief\" encompasses any belief that is missing at least one of the \"J\" or \"T\" conditions. Specifically, \"Belief\" would include:\n    *   Justified False Beliefs (JFB)\n    *   Unjustified True Beliefs (UTB)\n    *   Unjustified False Beliefs (UFB)\n3.  **The Internal Logic of JTB:** A core component of the JTB definition is the \"B\" (Belief). The definition states that knowledge *is a type of* belief; it is not a separate category from belief, but a special subset of it.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: The Two Problems\n\nWith this framework, we can identify two major problems that arise from these specific constraints.\n\n**Problem 1: The Problem of Conflation**\n\nThe constraint of having only two states forces the \"Belief\" state to become an overly broad and unhelpful category.\n\n*   **Analysis:** In this system, a belief that is carefully reasoned and supported by strong evidence but happens to be false (a Justified False Belief) is put into the exact same category as a belief that is a complete guess with no justification but happens to be true (an Unjustified True Belief).\n*   **Example:**\n    *   **Person A:** Believes it will rain because they have checked multiple reliable weather forecasts, seen dark clouds, and felt the barometric pressure drop. Unbeknownst to them, a sudden, unpredictable weather event clears the sky. Their belief is justified but false. Their state is \"Belief\".\n    *   **Person B:** Believes a specific horse will win a race based on a lucky feeling. They have no evidence or racing knowledge. The horse wins. Their belief is unjustified but true. Their state is also \"Belief\".\n*   **The Problem:** The system fails to distinguish between being epistemically responsible but wrong (Person A) and being epistemically irresponsible but lucky (Person B). It lumps these very different epistemic situations together, thereby losing the crucial nuance that the concept of \"justification\" is meant to provide.\n\n**Problem 2: The Problem of Self-Contradiction**\n\nThe premise that Knowledge and Belief are two separate states directly contradicts the JTB definition itself.\n\n*   **Analysis:** The JTB theory states that Knowledge *is* a Justified True **Belief**. This means that having a belief is a necessary condition for having knowledge. In other words, knowledge is a *subset* of belief.\n*   **The Contradiction:**\n    1.  According to the JTB definition: If you have Knowledge, you must have Belief (K â†’ B).\n    2.  According to the premise of the question: Knowledge and Belief are two distinct, mutually exclusive states (You can be in state K or state B, but not K and B).\n*   **The Problem:** These two conditions cannot both be true. The system is logically incoherent. You cannot define knowledge as a type of belief while simultaneously claiming that \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" are two fundamentally separate states. It's like saying \"A car is a type of vehicle\" while also stating that the only two categories for transportation are \"Cars\" and \"Vehicles,\" and they are mutually exclusive.\n\n<<<The two problems with the JTB model under these constraints are:\n1.  **The Conflation Problem:** The single epistemic state of \"Belief\" becomes a catch-all category that fails to distinguish between epistemically distinct situations. Specifically, it treats a Justified False Belief (a well-reasoned but incorrect conclusion) as the same type of state as an Unjustified True Belief (a lucky guess), thus losing the evaluative power of \"justification\" for beliefs that are not knowledge.\n2.  **The Self-Contradiction Problem:** The premise that \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" are two distinct, mutually exclusive states is logically incompatible with the JTB definition itself. The JTB definition asserts that knowledge *is a type of* belief (a justified, true one), making belief a necessary component of knowledge. This creates a direct contradiction, as a person in a state of \"Knowledge\" would have to simultaneously be in a state of \"Belief,\" which the premise forbids.>>>"
