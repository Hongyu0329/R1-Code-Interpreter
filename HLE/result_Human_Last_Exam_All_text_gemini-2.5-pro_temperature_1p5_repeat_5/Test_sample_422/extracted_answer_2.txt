The two problems with the JTB model under these constraints are:
1.  **The Conflation Problem:** The single epistemic state of "Belief" becomes a catch-all category that fails to distinguish between epistemically distinct situations. Specifically, it treats a Justified False Belief (a well-reasoned but incorrect conclusion) as the same type of state as an Unjustified True Belief (a lucky guess), thus losing the evaluative power of "justification" for beliefs that are not knowledge.
2.  **The Self-Contradiction Problem:** The premise that "Knowledge" and "Belief" are two distinct, mutually exclusive states is logically incompatible with the JTB definition itself. The JTB definition asserts that knowledge *is a type of* belief (a justified, true one), making belief a necessary component of knowledge. This creates a direct contradiction, as a person in a state of "Knowledge" would have to simultaneously be in a state of "Belief," which the premise forbids.
