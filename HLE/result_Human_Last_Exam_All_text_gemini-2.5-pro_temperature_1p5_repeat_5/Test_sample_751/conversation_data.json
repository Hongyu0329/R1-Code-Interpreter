    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality.\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\nWe are given a discrete-time linear system:\nx(k+1) = Ax(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nwith matrices:\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe goal is to find a new state representation x_o(k) = P^{-1}x(k) such that the system matrices (A_o, C_o) are in observer canonical form. The question specifically asks for the new output matrix, C_o.\n\n**2. The Duality Principle**\n\nThe principle of duality states that the properties of controllability of a system (A, B) are dual to the properties of observability of the system (A^T, B^T). We can find the transformation to observer canonical form for a system (A, C) by first finding the transformation to controller canonical form for its dual system (A^T, C^T) and then transposing the resulting canonical matrices.\n\n**3. Formulate the Dual System**\n\nLet the original system be Σ = (A, C). The dual system Σ' is defined by (A', B'), where:\nA' = A^T\nB' = C^T\n\nCalculating these matrices:\nA' = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]\nB' = C^T = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]\n\nThe dual system is: z(k+1) = A'z(k) + B'u(k). Our task is to transform this into controller canonical form.\n\n**4. Check Controllability and Find Controllability Indices of the Dual System**\n\nThe controllability of (A', B') determines the observability of (A, C). We build the controllability matrix W_c for the dual system:\nW_c = [B' | A'B' | (A')^2 B']\n\nLet the columns of B' be b'_1 and b'_2:\nb'_1 = [0, 1, 0]^T\nb'_2 = [1, 1, 0]^T\n\nCalculate A'b'_1 and A'b'_2:\nA'b'_1 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]^T = [2, 1, 1]^T\nA'b'_2 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [1, 1, 0]^T = [3, 2, 1]^T\n\nNow, we select a set of n=3 linearly independent vectors from the sequence {b'_1, b'_2, A'b'_1, A'b'_2, ...}.\n- v1 = b'_1 = [0, 1, 0]^T (Selected)\n- v2 = b'_2 = [1, 1, 0]^T (Linearly independent of v1. Selected)\n- v3 = A'b'_1 = [2, 1, 1]^T (Linearly independent of {v1, v2}, since its third component is non-zero. Selected)\n\nWe have found 3 linearly independent vectors. The dual system is controllable, which means the original system is observable.\nThe controllability indices (μ_1, μ_2) are determined by how many vectors we took from each column's chain.\n- From b'_1 chain: {b'_1, A'b'_1} -> 2 vectors. So, μ_1 = 2.\n- From b'_2 chain: {b'_2} -> 1 vector. So, μ_2 = 1.\nThe sum of indices μ_1 + μ_2 = 2 + 1 = 3, which equals the system order n.\n\n**5. Construct the Transformation Matrix for the Controller Form**\n\nWe construct a transformation matrix `T` that will convert the dual system into controller canonical form. The inverse of this transformation matrix, T^{-1}, is formed by the linearly independent vectors we selected in order:\nT^{-1} = [b'_1, A'b'_1, b'_2] = [[0, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]\n\nNow, we find T by inverting T^{-1}:\ndet(T^{-1}) = 0(0-1) - 2(0-0) + 1(1-0) = 1\nadj(T^{-1}) = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]]\nT = (1/det(T^{-1})) * adj(T^{-1}) = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]]\n\n**6. Transform the Dual System to Controller Canonical Form (A_c, B_c)**\n\nThe new state z_c is related by z_c = Tz. The transformed matrices are:\nA_c = T A' T^{-1}\nB_c = T B'\n\nLet's calculate B_c:\nB_c = T B' = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]] * [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]\nThe first column of B_c is T * b'_1 = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]] * [0, 1, 0]^T = [1, 0, 0]^T.\nThe second column of B_c is T * b'_2 = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]] * [1, 1, 0]^T = [0, 0, 1]^T.\nSo, B_c = [[1, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]\n\nWe can also calculate A_c, though it's not required for the final answer to the question.\nA_c = T A' T^{-1} = [[0, 2, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, -2, 1]]\n\n**7. Determine the Observer Canonical Form (A_o, C_o)**\n\nUsing duality, the observer canonical form matrices are the transposes of the controller canonical form matrices of the dual system:\nA_o = A_c^T\nC_o = B_c^T\n\nWe only need C_o:\nC_o = B_c^T = [[1, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]^T = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]\n\nThe new matrix C for the system in observer canonical form is C_o.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The observability indices of the original system are the same as the controllability indices of the dual system: ν_1 = μ_1 = 2, ν_2 = μ_2 = 1. The resulting C_o = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]] makes states x_o1 and x_o3 directly observable. State x_o2 is observed via the system dynamics. This structure is consistent with one of the standard multi-output observer canonical forms.\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]>>>"
