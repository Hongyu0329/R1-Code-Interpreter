    "This question asks to identify the word from the given list that did not undergo trisyllabic laxing. Trisyllabic laxing is a historical sound change in English where a long vowel becomes short when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end) of a word.\n\nLet's analyze each word step-by-step:\n\n1.  **southern**:\n    *   **Base word**: *south*. The vowel sound in *south* is /aʊ/, a diphthong which historically developed from a long vowel (Old English *sūþ*) and behaves like one in phonological rules.\n    *   **Pronunciation of *southern***: /ˈsʌðərn/. The /aʊ/ sound has become a short /ʌ/.\n    *   **Syllable Count**: The word *southern* has two syllables (*south-ern*).\n    *   **Analysis**: Since the word is only two syllables long, it cannot undergo *trisyllabic* laxing, which requires at least three syllables. However, the vowel has been shortened due to a different rule (pre-cluster shortening).\n\n2.  **derivative**:\n    *   **Base word**: *derive*. The vowel sound in the stressed syllable of *derive* is /aɪ/, a long vowel/diphthong.\n    *   **Pronunciation of *derivative***: /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/. The /aɪ/ has become a short /ɪ/.\n    *   **Syllable Count**: The word has four syllables (*de-riv-a-tive*). The vowel in question is in the syllable *-riv-*, which is the antepenultimate (third from the end).\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The long vowel /aɪ/ in *derive* shortens to /ɪ/ in *derivative* because it is now in the antepenultimate syllable. Thus, this word *has* undergone the change.\n\n3.  **serenity**:\n    *   **Base word**: *serene*. The vowel sound in *serene* is /iː/, a long vowel.\n    *   **Pronunciation of *serenity***: /səˈrɛnəti/. The /iː/ has become a short /ɛ/.\n    *   **Syllable Count**: The word has four syllables (*se-ren-i-ty*). The vowel in question is in the syllable *-ren-*, which is the antepenultimate.\n    *   **Analysis**: This is another textbook example of trisyllabic laxing. The word *has* undergone the change.\n\n4.  **pleasant**:\n    *   **Base word**: *please*. The vowel sound in *please* is /iː/, a long vowel.\n    *   **Pronunciation of *pleasant***: /ˈplɛzənt/. The /iː/ has become a short /ɛ/.\n    *   **Syllable Count**: The word *pleasant* has two syllables (*pleas-ant*).\n    *   **Analysis**: Like *southern*, this word is disyllabic and therefore cannot undergo *trisyllabic* laxing. The shortening is due to a different rule (often before a consonant cluster like *-nt*).\n\n5.  **gratitude**:\n    *   **Related word**: *grateful*. The vowel sound in *grateful* is /eɪ/, a long vowel/diphthong. This long vowel quality comes from its Latin root (*grātus*).\n    *   **Pronunciation of *gratitude***: /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/. The /eɪ/ sound is realized as a short /æ/.\n    *   **Syllable Count**: The word has three syllables (*grat-i-tude*). The vowel in question is in the first syllable, which is the antepenultimate.\n    *   **Analysis**: The vowel shortens from its long form when placed in the antepenultimate syllable. This word *has* undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n6.  **shadow**:\n    *   **Etymology**: The word comes from Old English *sceadu*. The vowel *ea* in this word was a short diphthong, not a long vowel.\n    *   **Pronunciation of *shadow***: /ˈʃædoʊ/. The first vowel is /æ/, which is short.\n    *   **Syllable Count**: The word has two syllables (*shad-ow*).\n    *   **Analysis**: This word is disyllabic, so the rule cannot apply. More importantly, the vowel in the first syllable was never long in its etymological history. Therefore, it couldn't have undergone laxing or shortening because there was no long vowel to shorten in the first place.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   *Derivative*, *serenity*, and *gratitude* are all clear examples of words that **have** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n*   *Southern* and *pleasant* have undergone vowel shortening, but not via the trisyllabic laxing rule, as they are only two syllables long.\n*   *Shadow* has not undergone trisyllabic laxing, both because it is only two syllables long and, more fundamentally, because its initial vowel was never long historically. It did not need to be shortened.\n\nTherefore, *shadow* is the most definitive answer as it has not undergone any such shortening process.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
