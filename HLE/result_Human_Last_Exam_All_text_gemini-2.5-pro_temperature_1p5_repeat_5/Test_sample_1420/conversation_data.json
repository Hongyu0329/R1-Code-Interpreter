    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Theoretical Framework and Key Parameters**\n\n*   **Theory:** The problem is set in the context of Renormalization Group (RG) theory, which is used to study critical phenomena.\n*   **Method:** We are asked to use the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion. This is a perturbative technique performed around the upper critical dimension, $d_c$.\n*   **Quantity:** We need to find the scaling exponent $\\alpha$, which describes the singularity of the specific heat ($C$) near the critical temperature ($T_c$): $C \\sim |T - T_c|^{-\\alpha}$.\n*   **System Dimension:** The physical system is in a spatial dimension of $d=3$.\n\n**2. Determine the Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$)**\n\n*   For standard models with short-range interactions and a scalar order parameter (like the Ising, XY, or Heisenberg models), the mean-field theory becomes exact above a certain dimension. This dimension is the upper critical dimension, $d_c$.\n*   For this class of models, the upper critical dimension is **$d_c = 4$**.\n\n**3. Define the Epsilon Parameter ($\\epsilon$)**\n\n*   The $\\epsilon$-expansion treats the deviation from the upper critical dimension as a small parameter.\n*   $\\epsilon$ is defined as: $\\epsilon = d_c - d$.\n*   Substituting the known values: $\\epsilon = 4 - d$.\n*   Since we are ultimately interested in the physical dimension $d=3$, we will set **$\\epsilon = 1$** at the end of the calculation.\n\n**4. Use Hyperscaling Relations to Connect Exponents**\n\n*   Critical exponents are not all independent; they are linked by scaling relations.\n*   The Josephson's hyperscaling relation connects the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ to the correlation length exponent $v$ and the spatial dimension $d$:\n    **$\\alpha = 2 - dv$**\n*   Our strategy will be to find the $\\epsilon$-expansion for $v$ and substitute it into this relation to find the expansion for $\\alpha$.\n\n**5. Find the $\\epsilon$-Expansion for the Correlation Length Exponent ($v$)**\n\n*   RG calculations for the general O(N)-symmetric vector model (where N=1 is the Ising model, N=2 is the XY model, etc.) give the following expansion for $v$ to the first order in $\\epsilon$:\n    **$v = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{N+2}{4(N+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$**\n*   The term $\\frac{1}{2}$ is the mean-field value for $v$. The second term is the first-order correction.\n\n**6. Derive the $\\epsilon$-Expansion for $\\alpha$**\n\n*   Now, we substitute the expressions for $d=4-\\epsilon$ and the expansion for $v$ into the hyperscaling relation $\\alpha = 2 - dv$.\n*   $\\alpha = 2 - (4 - \\epsilon) \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{N+2}{4(N+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right)$\n*   We expand this product, keeping only terms up to the first order in $\\epsilon$:\n    *   $\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{N+2}{4(N+8)}\\epsilon\\right) - \\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right]$\n    *   $\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\left(\\frac{N+2}{N+8}\\right)\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right]$\n    *   $\\alpha = 2 - 2 - \\left(\\frac{N+2}{N+8} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    *   $\\alpha = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{N+2}{N+8}\\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n*   Now, we combine the terms inside the parenthesis:\n    *   $\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{1(N+8) - 2(N+2)}{2(N+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    *   $\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{N+8 - 2N-4}{2(N+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    *   **$\\alpha = \\frac{4-N}{2(N+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$**\n\n**7. Specify the Model and Substitute Values**\n\n*   The question does not specify N, but the canonical example for such problems is the **Ising model**, which has a single-component order parameter (spin up/down), corresponding to **N=1**.\n*   Substituting N=1 into our formula for $\\alpha$:\n    *   $\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    *   $\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2(9)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    *   **$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$**\n\n**8. Calculate the Final Value**\n\n*   The final step is to evaluate this expression for the physical dimension of interest, $d=3$. This corresponds to setting **$\\epsilon = 1$**.\n*   Using the first-order approximation:\n    *   $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot (1)$\n    *   $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Model Assumption:** The result depends on the universality class (i.e., the value of N). We assumed the Ising model (N=1), which is standard unless stated otherwise.\n2.  **Upper Critical Dimension:** The entire calculation hinges on the correct value of $d_c=4$. This is valid for models with short-range interactions.\n3.  **Validity of Expansion:** The $\\epsilon$-expansion is an asymptotic series and works best for small $\\epsilon$. Here, we use $\\epsilon=1$, which is not small. Therefore, this result is an approximation. Higher-order terms do not necessarily improve the result's accuracy for $\\epsilon=1$. However, the leading-order result is the standard answer expected for this type of problem.\n4.  **Algebra:** Care must be taken during the algebraic expansion, especially with signs and keeping track of the order of $\\epsilon$.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe step-by-step analysis yields the first-order $\\epsilon$-expansion result for the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ in the Ising universality class. By setting $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$, we arrive at the final value.\n\n$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
