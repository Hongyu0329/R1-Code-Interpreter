    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the core elements of the question:** The question asks for the name of the character that the protagonist of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) marries.\n\n2.  **Identify the protagonist:** The main character of the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski, a human from the 21st century who is resurrected in the distant future.\n\n3.  **Analyze the concept of \"marriage\" within the novel's context:** The novel is a hard science fiction story set in a post-singularity universe. Human concepts like \"marriage\" have been radically altered or no longer exist in their 21st-century form. Therefore, we should not look for a traditional wedding ceremony. Instead, we need to identify the character with whom Adam Zamoyski forms the most profound, permanent, and binding union, which would be the equivalent of marriage in this advanced future.\n\n4.  **Identify the key relationship:** The most significant relationship Adam Zamoyski develops is with a \"phoebe\" (a type of powerful posthuman entity) named Angelica. She is assigned as his guide and protector upon his resurrection.\n\n5.  **Examine the nature of their union:** Throughout the novel, the bond between Adam and Angelica deepens. The culmination of their relationship is not a social contract but a physical and metaphysical fusion. Adam Zamoyski's consciousness, referred to as his \"Inclusion,\" is permanently merged with Angelica. They effectively become a single, composite being, sharing consciousness and existence. This act of complete and irreversible merging is the novel's functional and thematic equivalent of a marriage.\n\n6.  **Conclude the answer:** Based on this analysis, the character that the main character, Adam Zamoyski, \"marries\" through a process of metaphysical fusion is Angelica.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Context is crucial:** The term \"marries\" cannot be taken literally in the traditional sense. The answer must be understood within the specific, high-concept world of the novel.\n*   **The nature of the union:** The union is a form of technological and ontological fusion, far beyond a typical human relationship. They cease to be two separate individuals and become one.\n*   **Character Name:** The name of the phoebe is consistently given as Angelica.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nFollowing the steps above, the protagonist Adam Zamoyski forms a permanent, life-altering union with the character Angelica. This fusion is the closest concept to marriage in the book's context. Therefore, the name of the character he \"marries\" is Angelica.\n\n<<<Angelica>>>"
