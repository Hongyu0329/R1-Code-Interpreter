    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe query asks for a specific film based on a very detailed scene. The key elements are:\n1.  **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n2.  **Producer:** A major film studio.\n3.  **Protagonist of the action:** A teenager.\n4.  **Object:** A pink bike.\n5.  **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car (or truck).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Core Action - \"Pedaling toward an oncoming car\"**\nThis action describes a \"game of chicken,\" a cinematic trope used to establish a character as rebellious, reckless, or defiant. Thinking of famous \"chicken\" scenes in teen movies is a good starting point.\n*   A well-known example is in *Rebel Without a Cause* (1955), but that involves two cars driving toward a cliff.\n*   Another famous example is in *Footloose* (1984), where Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) and Chuck Cranston face off on tractors. This matches the \"teenager,\" \"defiance,\" and \"oncoming vehicle\" themes, but not the bike or car.\n\n**Step 3: Incorporate the Specific Details - \"A Teenager on a Pink Bike\"**\nThe pink bike is a highly specific visual cue that narrows the search significantly. We need to look for a film that combines this visual with the \"game of chicken\" action. Let's revisit the candidate film *Footloose*.\n\n**Step 4: Re-examine the movie *Footloose* (1984)**\nWhile the tractor scene is the most famous game of chicken in the film, there is another character who engages in similar reckless behavior.\n*   **Character:** The character of Ariel Moore (played by Lori Singer) is the rebellious daughter of the town preacher and is a teenager. This matches criterion #3.\n*   **The Scene:** Early in the film, there is a scene that establishes Ariel's daredevil personality. She is riding her bicycle on a country road. When a large truck approaches from the opposite direction, instead of moving to the side, she defiantly pedals directly into its path. The truck driver is forced to swerve violently at the last second to avoid hitting her.\n*   **The Bike:** In this scene, Ariel's bicycle is distinctively pink. This matches criterion #4.\n*   **The Action:** Her action of pedaling straight at the truck perfectly matches the description in criterion #5.\n\n**Step 5: Verify All Remaining Criteria**\n*   **Hollywood Feature Film?:** Yes, *Footloose* (1984) is a classic Hollywood movie. This matches criterion #1.\n*   **Major Film Studio?:** The film was produced and distributed by Paramount Pictures, which is a major Hollywood studio. This matches criterion #2.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll five specific points from the question are met by a scene in the 1984 film *Footloose*. The character is the teenager Ariel Moore, who rides her pink bike head-on toward an oncoming truck, forcing it to swerve. The film was produced by a major studio, Paramount Pictures.\n\n<<<Footloose (1984)>>>"
