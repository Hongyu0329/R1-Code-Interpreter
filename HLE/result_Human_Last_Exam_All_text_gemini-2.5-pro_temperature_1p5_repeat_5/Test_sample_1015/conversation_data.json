    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the term \"Cambré Derrière\"**\n*   **Cambré:** This is a French ballet term meaning \"arched.\" It refers to a bend of the body from the waist.\n*   **Derrière:** This is a French term meaning \"behind\" or \"to the back.\"\n*   **Cambré Derrière:** Therefore, this movement is a bend of the upper body backward from the waist.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Vaganova Method's approach to Cambré Derrière**\n*   **Origin:** Developed by Agrippina Vaganova in Russia, this method is the basis for most Russian ballet training.\n*   **Key Principles:** It emphasizes strength, precision, and stability in the core. The torso is meant to be a solid, controlled base.\n*   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:** In the Vaganova method, the backbend initiates from the upper thoracic spine (the upper and middle back). A critical rule is to keep the hips square and stable, directly over the supporting leg(s). The hips **do not** press forward. The focus is on creating a beautiful arch in the upper back while maintaining a strong, stable lower body and core. The head follows the line of the spine, lifting up and back.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Balanchine Method's approach to Cambré Derrière**\n*   **Origin:** Developed by choreographer George Balanchine for his New York City Ballet.\n*   **Key Principles:** This method, or style, is known for its speed, musicality, and neo-classical aesthetic. It often pushes the classical lines to create more dynamic and extreme shapes.\n*   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:** In the Balanchine style, to achieve a deeper and more dramatic backbend, the dancer is taught to **press the hips forward**. This forward displacement of the hips acts as a counterbalance and allows for a much greater degree of arch through the entire spine, not just the upper back. This creates a signature off-balance, dynamic look that is characteristic of Balanchine's choreography.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the two methods and evaluate the careful points**\n*   **Placement of Hip (Careful Point):** This is the most fundamental and defining difference. Vaganova insists on keeping the hips stable and not pushing them forward. Balanchine encourages pushing the hips forward. This is a core technical distinction.\n*   **Degree of backbend (Careful Point):** The Balanchine backbend is often visually deeper, but this is a *result* of the difference in hip placement. The forward hip action is what *allows* for the greater degree of bend. Therefore, hip placement is the cause, and the degree of bend is the effect.\n*   **Placement of head and Arm placement (Careful Points):** While there are stylistic differences in how the head and arms are held in each method, these are secondary to the primary action of the torso and hips. The head and arms follow the line created by the backbend. The Balanchine head might drop further back to follow the deeper curve, but this is a consequence of the hip action.\n*   **Speed (Careful Point):** While Balanchine's work is often fast, a cambré itself can be performed at any speed in either style, depending on the musicality of the exercise or choreography. Speed is not a fundamental technical difference in the execution of this specific step.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude and Select the Final Answer**\nThe primary, foundational difference in the technique of executing a cambré derrière between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the use of the hips. Vaganova emphasizes hip stability, while Balanchine uses a forward press of the hips to achieve a deeper line.\n\n<<<B>>>"
