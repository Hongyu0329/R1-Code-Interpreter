    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    The starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n    *   The parent structure is a benzamide, which consists of a benzene ring attached to a carboxamide group (-CONH2).\n    *   \"N,N-diethyl\" means the two hydrogens on the amide nitrogen are replaced by ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). This gives an N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CON(C2H5)2).\n    *   \"3-dimethylamino\" means there is a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) at position 3 of the benzene ring. By convention, the carbon attached to the main functional group (the carboxamide) is C1. So, the dimethylamino group is at the meta position relative to the carboxamide group.\n\n    The structure is:\n    ```\n        O\n       //\n      C - N(Et)2\n     /\n    C1--C2(H)\n   //    \\\n C6(H)     C3 - N(Me)2\n  \\     //\n   C5(H)--C4(H)\n    ```\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Reaction Step: Reagents and Conditions:**\n    *   **sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium):** This is a very strong organometallic base.\n    *   **TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine):** This is a chelating agent for the lithium cation (Li+). It breaks down the aggregates of sec-BuLi, increasing its reactivity, and stabilizes the resulting organolithium product.\n    *   **THF (tetrahydrofuran):** This is the polar aprotic solvent.\n    *   This combination of reagents is characteristic of a **Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM)** reaction. In this reaction, a substituent on the aromatic ring directs the strong base to deprotonate one of the ortho C-H bonds.\n\n3.  **Identify the Directing Groups and Determine the Site of Lithiation:**\n    *   There are two potential directing groups on the benzene ring: the **N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt2)** at C1 and the **dimethylamino group (-NMe2)** at C3.\n    *   Both groups are effective at directing ortho-metalation because their heteroatoms (O for the amide, N for the amine) can coordinate with the lithium ion of sec-BuLi, bringing the base close to the ortho protons.\n    *   To determine which site will be deprotonated, we must compare the directing ability of these two groups. The generally accepted hierarchy for DoM directing power is: **-CONR2 > -SO2NR2 > -OR > -NR2**.\n    *   Therefore, the **N,N-diethylcarboxamide group is the more powerful directing group**. It will direct the lithiation to its ortho positions, which are C2 and C6.\n    *   The dimethylamino group at C3 also has a directing effect towards its own ortho positions, which are C2 and C4.\n    *   The C2 position is ortho to *both* the powerful -CONEt2 group and the -NMe2 group. This is a **cooperative directing effect**. The C-H bond at C2 is significantly more acidic than any other C-H bond on the ring.\n    *   Therefore, sec-BuLi will selectively deprotonate the C2 position, forming a 2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide intermediate.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Reaction Step: Quenching with an Electrophile:**\n    *   The second reagent added is **methyl iodide (CH3I)**.\n    *   The aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step has a nucleophilic carbanion at the C2 position.\n    *   Methyl iodide is an electrophile, with the carbon atom being electrophilic.\n    *   The nucleophilic C2 carbanion will attack the electrophilic methyl group of CH3I, displacing the iodide ion. This reaction replaces the lithium atom at C2 with a methyl group (-CH3).\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    *   Starting with N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, the reaction introduces a methyl group at the C2 position.\n    *   The final product has the following substituents on the benzene ring:\n        *   C1: -CON(C2H5)2 (N,N-diethylcarboxamide)\n        *   C2: -CH3 (methyl)\n        *   C3: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n    *   The name of this compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Hierarchy of Directing Groups:** Correctly identifying the amide (-CONR2) as a stronger directing group than the amine (-NR2) is crucial for determining the regioselectivity.\n*   **Cooperative Effect:** Recognizing that both directing groups activate the C2 position explains the high selectivity of the reaction for that site over the C6 (ortho to amide only) or C4 (ortho to amine only) positions.\n*   **Nucleophilicity:** The aryllithium carbanion is a much stronger nucleophile than the nitrogen atoms of the amide or amine groups. Therefore, it reacts preferentially with the methyl iodide electrophile, leading to C-methylation rather than N-methylation.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via a directed ortho-metalation controlled by the stronger N,N-diethylcarboxamide directing group, with a cooperative effect from the 3-dimethylamino group. This leads to lithiation at the C2 position. Subsequent reaction with the electrophile, methyl iodide, introduces a methyl group at this C2 position.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
