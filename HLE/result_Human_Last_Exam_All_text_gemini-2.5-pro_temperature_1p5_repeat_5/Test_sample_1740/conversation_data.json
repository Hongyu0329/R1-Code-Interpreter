    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe core task is to identify the total number of distinct members of the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family found in humans (*Homo sapiens*). The phrase \"to date\" implies we should use the most current, accepted scientific consensus, primarily based on authoritative databases like miRBase.\n\n**Step 2: Define the \"let-7 Family\" and its \"Members\"**\nThe let-7 family is a group of miRNAs characterized by a highly conserved sequence, particularly in the \"seed region,\" which is critical for target recognition. A \"member\" in this context typically refers to a unique mature miRNA sequence, not the number of genes that can produce it.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Authoritative Sources**\nThe primary and most reliable source for miRNA information is **miRBase**, the central repository for all published miRNA sequences and annotations. Other resources like NCBI Gene and major genome browsers also pull data from miRBase.\n\n**Step 4: Differentiate between Genes (Precursors) and Mature miRNAs**\nThis is a crucial point of carefulness. A single type of mature miRNA can be encoded by multiple genes located at different places in the genome. For example, the mature `let-7a` miRNA is produced from three different genes (`let-7a-1`, `let-7a-2`, `let-7a-3`). The question about \"members\" is most accurately answered by counting the number of distinct mature miRNAs, not the number of precursor genes.\n\n**Step 5: List the Recognized Human let-7 Family Members**\nBased on data from miRBase and the scientific literature, the human let-7 family consists of the following distinct mature miRNAs:\n\n1.  **let-7a**: A single mature miRNA, although encoded by three different genes.\n2.  **let-7b**: A single mature miRNA.\n3.  **let-7c**: A single mature miRNA.\n4.  **let-7d**: A single mature miRNA.\n5.  **let-7e**: A single mature miRNA.\n6.  **let-7f**: A single mature miRNA, although encoded by two different genes.\n7.  **let-7g**: A single mature miRNA.\n8.  **let-7i**: A single mature miRNA.\n9.  **miR-98**: While not named \"let-7\", it is considered a core member of the let-7 family due to its high sequence and functional similarity.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Count**\nBy counting the unique mature miRNAs listed above, we arrive at the total number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n*   let-7a (1)\n*   let-7b (1)\n*   let-7c (1)\n*   let-7d (1)\n*   let-7e (1)\n*   let-7f (1)\n*   let-7g (1)\n*   let-7i (1)\n*   miR-98 (1)\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9\n\nIf the question were about the number of genes/precursors, the count would be 12 (3 for let-7a, 2 for let-7f, and 1 for each of the other 7 members). However, the standard interpretation of \"members\" refers to the 9 distinct mature products.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis confirms that there are 9 well-established, distinct mature miRNA members of the let-7 family in humans.\n\n<<<9>>>"
