    "Answering the user's request involves a step-by-step analysis of the problem, a focus on creating the most memory-efficient C program, and finally calculating the total memory used by the variables in that program.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Objective**: Compare two strings lexicographically, ignoring the case of the letters.\n2.  **Input**: Two strings, each on a new line.\n3.  **Constraints**:\n    *   The two strings have the same length.\n    *   The length of each string is between 1 and 100, inclusive.\n    *   The strings consist only of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n4.  **Comparison Rule**: Lexicographical (dictionary) order. 'A' is treated as equal to 'a', 'B' to 'b', etc.\n5.  **Output**:\n    *   Print \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second.\n    *   Print \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically larger than the second.\n    *   Print \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Memory Efficiency**: The main goal is to write a C program that uses the minimum possible memory for its variables. This means we must be judicious in our choice of data types and avoid unnecessary data storage.\n2.  **Case-Insensitive Comparison**: Before comparing two characters, they must be converted to a common case (either both to lowercase or both to uppercase). The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is suitable for this.\n3.  **Data Storage**: A naive approach would be to store both strings in memory in two separate character arrays. A more memory-efficient approach would be to store only one string and process the second one character by character as it's being read from the input. Since standard input is a forward-only stream, we must store at least the first string to compare its characters against the second string's characters.\n4.  **Variable Sizing**: To minimize memory, we should choose the smallest possible data type for each variable. For a loop counter that goes up to 100, a `char` (1 byte) is sufficient instead of a standard `int` (usually 4 bytes).\n5.  **Input Handling**: When reading character-by-character using a function like `getchar()`, it's important to remember that it returns an `int`. This is to accommodate all possible character values as well as the special End-Of-File (EOF) marker. Therefore, the variable receiving the result from `getchar()` must be an `int`.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nTo achieve the most memory-efficient solution, we will adopt the one-buffer strategy.\n\n1.  **Algorithm Design**:\n    *   Read the first string from the standard input and store it in a character array (buffer).\n    *   Read the second string from the standard input one character at a time.\n    *   As each character of the second string is read, compare it (case-insensitively) with the character at the corresponding position in the stored first string.\n    *   If a difference is found, print the result (`-1` or `1`) and terminate the program.\n    *   If we read through the entire second string and find no differences, the strings are equal, so we print `0`.\n\n2.  **Variable Declaration and Memory Calculation**:\n    Based on the algorithm, the following variables are required:\n    *   A buffer for the first string: The maximum length is 100, plus one byte for the null terminator (`\\0`).\n      `char s1[101];` -> Memory: `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n    *   A loop counter to iterate through the stored string `s1`. The index will range from 0 to 99. A `char` is sufficient.\n      `char i;` -> Memory: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n    *   A variable to hold the character being read from the second string. As `getchar()` returns an `int`, this variable must be an `int`.\n      `int c_in;` -> Memory: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes** (on typical competitive programming platforms).\n\n3.  **Total Memory Calculation (m)**:\n    The total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all declared variables.\n    m = (memory for `s1`) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `c_in`)\n    m = 101 bytes + 1 byte + 4 bytes\n    m = **106 bytes**\n\nThis one-buffer approach is more memory-efficient than a two-buffer approach, which would require `101 + 101 + 1 = 203` bytes. Thus, 106 bytes is the memory usage for the most efficient solution.\n\n<<<106>>>"
