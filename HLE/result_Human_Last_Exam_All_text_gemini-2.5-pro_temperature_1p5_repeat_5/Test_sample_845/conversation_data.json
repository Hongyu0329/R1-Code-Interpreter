    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the name of the specific value measured *between* heartbeats, which is then used to calculate Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n2.  **Identify the Measurement Process:** The prompt states that \"beat-to-beat intervals\" are captured. This is a crucial clue. It means we are measuring the duration of time that passes from one heartbeat to the next.\n3.  **Relate to Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV):**\n    *   **Heart Rate (HR)** is an average measure, typically expressed in beats per minute (BPM). For example, if the time between beats is consistently 1 second, the HR is 60 BPM.\n    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)** is not the rate itself but the *variation* in the time between consecutive beats. If the intervals are 0.9s, 1.1s, 0.95s, and 1.05s, the heart rate is still *around* 60 BPM, but the presence of this variation indicates HRV. The value used to compute this variation is the duration of each individual interval.\n4.  **Identify the Standard Terminology:**\n    *   While the prompt mentions PPG (Photoplethysmography), the gold standard for measuring this interval is ECG (Electrocardiography). In an ECG signal, the most prominent peak of a heartbeat is called the \"R-wave.\" Therefore, the time interval from one R-wave to the next is called the **R-R interval**. This term is very widely used, even when the data is derived from other sources like PPG, as the PPG peak is an approximation of the R-wave.\n    *   A more general, technology-agnostic term for this same measurement is the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**. This term is also very common and accurate.\n    *   For the specific purpose of calculating HRV, raw R-R intervals or IBIs are often \"cleaned\" to remove artifacts or abnormal beats (like premature ventricular contractions). The resulting intervals between consecutive *normal* beats are called **Normal-to-Normal intervals (NN intervals)**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **PPG vs. ECG:** The question specifies PPG. In PPG, you measure the time between peaks of the pulse wave, which is technically a \"Peak-to-Peak (PP) interval\". However, in the context of HRV, it's almost always referred to by the more common ECG-derived term, **R-R interval**, or the general term, **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**.\n*   **HRV Calculation Nuance:** The value is not HRV itself, but the raw data point *used to compute* HRV. This distinction is important. The value is a time duration (e.g., in milliseconds), while HRV is a statistical calculation based on a series of these time durations.\n*   **Synonymous Terms:** R-R interval and Inter-beat Interval (IBI) are often used interchangeably to refer to the fundamental measurement. NN interval is a more specific term for the filtered data used in HRV analysis.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the value computed between heartbeats is the time duration of that interval. The most common and correct names for this value are:\n\n1.  **R-R interval:** The time between the R-peaks of two consecutive heartbeats on an ECG. It's the most common term in clinical and research settings.\n2.  **Inter-beat Interval (IBI):** A more general term for the time between any two consecutive heartbeats, regardless of the measurement technology.\n3.  **Normal-to-Normal (NN) interval:** A filtered version of the R-R interval or IBI, where only intervals between \"normal\" sinus rhythm beats are included. This is the data directly used for most standard HRV calculations.\n\nAll of these terms accurately describe the value in question. The most fundamental and widely recognized are \"R-R interval\" and \"Inter-beat Interval (IBI)\".\n\n<<<R-R interval (or Inter-beat Interval / IBI)>>>"
