    "Answering this question involves a multi-stage process: first, analyzing the problem and the provided Java code for correctness. Second, if the code is incorrect, devising the most efficient possible C solution. Third, quantifying that efficiency in terms of character comparisons (`x`) and memory usage (`y`) as per the user's specific format.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem Statement**:\n    *   **Variable**: There is one integer variable, `x`, initialized to 0.\n    *   **Operations**: `++` increments `x` by 1, and `--` decrements `x` by 1.\n    *   **Statements**: A statement is a string containing exactly one operation (`++` or `--`) and one variable (`X`). The order is not fixed. This gives four possible valid statements: `++X`, `X++`, `--X`, `X--`.\n    *   **Program**: A sequence of `n` statements is executed.\n    *   **Goal**: Find the final value of `x` after executing all `n` statements.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Submitted Java Code**:\n    *   The code initializes a counter `tresult` to 0.\n    *   It loops `t` times (where `t` is the number of statements).\n    *   Inside the loop, it reads a statement as a string `test`.\n    *   It uses `if (test.contains(\"++X\"))` to check for an increment and `if (test.contains(\"--X\"))` to check for a decrement.\n\n3.  **Identify the Flaw in the Java Code**:\n    *   The core issue is the use of `test.contains()`.\n    *   The problem allows for statements where `X` comes first, such as `X++` and `X--`.\n    *   If the input statement is `\"X++\"`, the condition `test.contains(\"++X\")` will be **false**. The code will not increment `tresult`.\n    *   Similarly, if the input statement is `\"X--\"`, the condition `test.contains(\"--X\")` will be **false**. The code will not decrement `tresult`.\n    *   Therefore, the Java program is **incorrect** because it only handles half of the possible valid inputs.\n\n### List of Careful Points for the Optimal Solution\n\nSince the provided program is incorrect, we must design an optimal C solution and analyze it.\n\n1.  **Input Reading**: Reading the entire 3-character string with `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` is unnecessary. The operation is fully determined by a single character.\n2.  **Identifying the Operation**: The simplest way to distinguish between an increment and a decrement is to look for the `+` or `-` character. All increment statements (`++X`, `X++`) contain a `+`. All decrement statements (`--X`, `X--`) contain a `-`.\n3.  **Efficiency Insight (Speed)**: A more specific observation is that the *middle character* of any valid 3-character statement is always `+` for an increment and `-` for a decrement. Checking just this one character (`statement[1]`) is the most direct way to identify the operation.\n4.  **Minimizing Comparisons (`x`)**: A standard check like `if (op == '+')` involves a comparison and a conditional branch. To achieve the absolute *smallest* number of comparisons, we can use an arithmetic trick based on ASCII values. This avoids conditional branching entirely.\n5.  **Minimizing Memory (`y`)**: We should declare only the essential variables. To read just the middle character, we can use a specific `scanf` format string that reads and discards the first and third characters, storing only the second. This avoids needing a 3 or 4-byte character array buffer.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Correctness Verdict**: The Java program is incorrect. Thus, the answer must begin with **N**.\n\n2.  **Calculating `x` (Smallest Character Comparisons for n=100)**:\n    *   We design a C program that reads only the middle character of each statement.\n    *   Let the middle character be `op_char`. The ASCII value of `'+'` is 43, and `'-'` is 45.\n    *   We can update our result `res` without an `if` statement using the formula: `res += 44 - op_char;`\n        *   If `op_char` is `'+'` (43), this adds `44 - 43 = 1` to `res`.\n        *   If `op_char` is `'-'` (45), this adds `44 - 45 = -1` to `res`.\n    *   This logic perfectly implements the problem's requirements. Critically, it uses arithmetic and **zero character comparisons** (`==`, `!=`, etc.) inside the loop.\n    *   For 100 statements, the total number of comparisons is `100 * 0 = 0`.\n    *   Therefore, **x = 0**.\n\n3.  **Calculating `y` (Smallest Memory Size in B)**:\n    *   An optimal C program requires the following variables:\n        *   `int n;` to store the number of statements (typically 4 bytes).\n        *   `int res;` to store the result (typically 4 bytes).\n        *   `int i;` for the loop counter (typically 4 bytes).\n        *   `char op_char;` to store the middle character read from input (1 byte).\n    *   We can read the input using `scanf(\" %*c%c%*c\", &op_char);`, which reads and discards the first character (`%*c`), reads the second into `op_char` (`%c`), and reads and discards the third (`%*c`).\n    *   Total memory usage = `sizeof(int)` + `sizeof(int)` + `sizeof(int)` + `sizeof(char)`.\n    *   Assuming a standard environment where `int` is 4 bytes and `char` is 1 byte, the total memory is `4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13` bytes.\n    *   Therefore, **y = 13**.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Formulation**:\n    *   The required format is `Nx+y`.\n    *   Substituting our calculated values: `N` + `0` + `+` + `13`.\n\nFinal Answer: `N0+13`.\n\n<<<N0+13>>>"
