    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Critical-Level Views**\n\nCritical-level views in population ethics evaluate the goodness of a population based on the welfare of the individuals in it. The core idea is that a life is only worth adding to a population if its welfare level (`w`) is above a certain positive \"critical level\" (`c`).\n\n*   The value of a life with welfare `w` is calculated as `w - c`.\n*   If a person's welfare `w` is greater than the critical level `c` (`w > c`), adding this person makes the world better. The contributed value is positive.\n*   If a person's welfare `w` is less than the critical level `c` (`w < c`), adding this person makes the world worse, even if the person has a positive welfare level (a life worth living, `w > 0`). The contributed value is negative.\n*   The total value of a population is the sum of these individual values: Î£(`wi` - `c`).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Conditions of Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem**\n\nArrhenius's theorems show that it's impossible for any theory of population ethics to satisfy a list of seemingly reasonable and intuitive conditions simultaneously. Let's analyze each condition provided in the answer choices.\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** For two populations of the same size and same total welfare, the population with a more equal distribution of welfare is at least as good. Critical-level views satisfy this. Since the total value is `Sum(w) - N*c`, and `Sum(w)` and `N` are the same for both populations, their value is identical, thus satisfying the \"at least as good as\" requirement.\n\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** This condition prioritizes avoiding extreme suffering. It says that for any good life, a sufficiently large population of people enjoying that life is better than a population with very happy people but also some people in hell. Critical-level views, being aggregative, may violate this, but it's not their most characteristic violation.\n\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** This principle states that for any life with positive welfare (`w > 0`), no matter how low, a sufficient number of such lives is better than any single life, no matter how high its welfare (`h`). Formally: For any `w > 0` and any `h`, there exists a number `n` such that a population of `n` people at level `w` is better than a population of one person at level `h`.\n\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** This says that, all else equal, adding a person with a positive welfare level is always better than adding a person with a negative welfare level (a life of torture). Critical-level views satisfy this. Adding a person with welfare `w > 0` gives a value of `w-c`. Adding a person with welfare `z < 0` gives a value of `z-c`. Since `w > z`, it is always true that `w-c > z-c`.\n\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** This states that for any population, there is some high-quality life that, when added, makes the resulting population better. Critical-level views satisfy this. We can always find a welfare level `w` that is higher than the critical level `c`. Adding a person with such a life (`w > c`) will add positive value (`w-c > 0`), making the world better.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Violated Condition**\n\nLet's test Non-Elitism (C) against the critical-level view.\n\n1.  Let the critical level be `c > 0`.\n2.  The Non-Elitism condition says we can pick *any* positive welfare level `w > 0`. Let's choose one that is positive but below the critical level, so `0 < w < c`. (For example, if `c=10`, we can pick `w=2`).\n3.  The value contributed by a person at this level `w` is `w - c`, which is a negative number.\n4.  According to Non-Elitism, there should be some number `n` of these people that is better than one person at a very high welfare level `h` (where `h > c`).\n5.  Let's compare the two populations:\n    *   Population 1: `n` people at level `w`. Total value = `n * (w - c)`.\n    *   Population 2: 1 person at level `h`. Total value = `1 * (h - c)`.\n6.  Since `w < c`, the term `(w - c)` is negative. As `n` increases, the total value `n * (w - c)` becomes a larger and larger negative number.\n7.  Since `h > c`, the term `(h - c)` is positive.\n8.  Therefore, for a critical-level view, the value of Population 1 will *always* be less than the value of Population 2, no matter how large `n` becomes. A large negative number is never better than a positive number.\n\nThis directly contradicts the Non-Elitism principle. Critical-level views are \"elitist\" in the sense that they can value one \"elite\" life (above the critical level) more than any number of \"good but not good enough\" lives (below the critical level).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCritical-level views violate the condition of Non-Elitism because a sufficiently large number of lives with positive welfare below the critical level can be judged as worse than a single life with welfare above the critical level.\n\n<<<C>>>"
