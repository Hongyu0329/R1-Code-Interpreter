    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key figures and the event.**\nThe question involves two historical figures: Geoffrey Chaucer, the famous poet, and Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt. The event is the death of Blanche of Lancaster.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the date of the event.**\nWe need to find out when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records confirm that she died on **September 12, 1368**, likely from the plague, at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England.\n\n**Step 3: Investigate Geoffrey Chaucer's location in September 1368.**\nTo answer the question, we must look at biographical records for Geoffrey Chaucer for that specific year.\n*   In the 1360s, Chaucer was a member of the royal household, serving as an esquire to King Edward III.\n*   On **July 17, 1368**, royal records show that Chaucer received a license to travel abroad on the King's business. This means he was leaving England for the European continent sometime after that date.\n*   The journey would have taken place during the summer and autumn of 1368. Given that Blanche died on September 12, it is almost certain that Chaucer was on this continental mission at the time of her death.\n*   Therefore, he was not in England. This eliminates option C. He was also not in Scotland, which eliminates option E.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the possible locations on the continent.**\nNow we must determine where on the continent he might have been.\n*   Surviving documents confirm the journey but do not state the precise destination.\n*   Scholars have proposed various theories. Some suggest he may have gone to Milan, **Italy**, to attend the wedding of Lionel of Antwerp, son of Edward III. Others suggest the mission could have been to **France** or Navarre (in modern-day Spain).\n*   Because there is no definitive documentary proof of his exact location—only speculation—we cannot be certain if he was in Italy or France. He could have been traveling between locations.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude based on the available evidence.**\nWhile we know with high certainty that Chaucer was on the European continent, the historical record is silent on his exact location on September 12, 1368. Because his specific destination is not recorded and remains a matter of scholarly debate, the most accurate and cautious answer is that his whereabouts are unknown. The fact that he later wrote *The Book of the Duchess* as an elegy for Blanche indicates his connection to the event, but this was written after his return to England later in 1368 or in early 1369.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  Do not confuse the time of Blanche's death with the time Chaucer wrote the poem about her death. He wrote the poem *after* the event, upon his return to England.\n2.  Be precise about what the historical records prove. They prove he was licensed to travel abroad before her death. They do not prove his exact destination.\n3.  Evaluate all options carefully. \"Italy\" and \"France\" are plausible theories, but \"Unknown\" is the most accurate reflection of the documentary evidence.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBased on the analysis, while Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission on the continent, his exact location at the moment of Blanche of Lancaster's death is not documented.\n\n<<<D>>>"
