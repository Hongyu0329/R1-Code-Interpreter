    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris* who says they are \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This requires knowledge of the film's specific dialogue and the characters' personalities and motivations.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Context of the Film**\nThe film *Solaris* is a philosophical and psychological drama set on a space station orbiting the mysterious planet Solaris. The crew is isolated and haunted by \"visitors\"—physical manifestations of their past traumas and memories. A central theme is the conflict between cold, rational science and the complexities of human emotion, memory, and our connection to Earth. The feeling of being cut off from Earth is a source of profound psychological distress for the characters.\n\n**Step 3: List and Analyze the Characters (The Answer Choices)**\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist psychologist. His connection to Earth is established in the long opening sequence at his father's dacha. He is the one who most deeply grapples with the re-emergence of his past, but he is typically the listener during the more philosophical monologues from the other scientists.\n*   **B. Hari:** A \"visitor,\" a replica of Kris's deceased wife. She has no actual memories of Earth, only those implanted in her from Kris's mind. Therefore, she cannot miss something she never truly experienced.\n*   **C. Snaut:** The cyberneticist who has been on the station for a long time. He is cynical, often inebriated, and world-weary. However, beneath this exterior, he is deeply philosophical and prone to introspective speeches about humanity, science, and their profound isolation. He acts as a guide for Kris, explaining the strange phenomena of Solaris.\n*   **D. Sartorius:** The biologist. He is a stern, dogmatic scientist who is focused on studying Solaris with rigid objectivity. He represses his emotions and would view nostalgia or a longing for Earth as a weakness or a distraction from his scientific work.\n*   E. **Gibarian:** A fellow scientist who committed suicide just before Kris's arrival. He appears to Kris as a \"visitor\" and in a final video message. His message is one of despair and warning, but it doesn't contain this specific line.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the Dialogue and Speaker**\nThe sentiment in the question is expressed during a key philosophical conversation. It is Dr. Snaut who delivers this line to Kris Kelvin. While reflecting on their purpose in space and the nature of humanity, Snaut expresses a profound sense of loss and alienation. He laments that humanity seeks a mirror in the cosmos rather than new worlds, and that in their scientific pursuits, they have forgotten what it means to be human. He says something to the effect of being ashamed of basic human feelings, such as missing the simple, natural sound of wind in the leaves on Earth.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Character Personality:** The line fits perfectly with Snaut's character. He is the one who most eloquently articulates the crew's existential crisis and disillusionment with their scientific mission. Sartorius is too cold and scientific, while Kris is more of a recipient of these ideas as he processes his own trauma.\n*   **Source Material:** The question specifically refers to the 1972 Tarkovsky film, not the original novel by Stanisław Lem or the 2002 remake. The dialogue can differ significantly between these versions.\n*   **The \"Ashamed\" Aspect:** The word \"ashamed\" is key. It's not just simple nostalgia. It's a critique of a mindset (likely the scientific one) that has come to devalue such \"unimportant\" sensory experiences and emotions, leading to a sense of shame for even feeling them. This intellectual and self-critical sentiment is characteristic of Snaut.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nBased on the analysis of the characters and the specific dialogue in the film, the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves is Dr. Snaut. He confesses this feeling to Kris as part of a larger reflection on their isolation and lost humanity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
