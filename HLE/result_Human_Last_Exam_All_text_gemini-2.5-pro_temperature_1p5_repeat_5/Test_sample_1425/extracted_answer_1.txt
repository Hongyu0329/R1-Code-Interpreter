For a system of bosons, the partition function is $Z = \prod_i \frac{1}{1 - e^{2\beta\mu}}$. For a system of fermions, it is $Z = \prod_i (1 + e^{2\beta\mu})$. In a combined notation, this is $Z = \prod_i (1 \mp e^{2\beta\mu})^{\mp 1}$, where the upper sign is for bosons and the lower sign is for fermions.
