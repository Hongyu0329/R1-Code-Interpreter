    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first clue:** \"Andrei Voznesensky called this man 'a joy-discovering sailor'\".\n    *   This points to a poem or a major work by the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky.\n    *   The subject is likely an explorer, voyager, or someone associated with the sea. The term \"joy-discovering\" is poetic and could refer to discovering new lands, new knowledge, or even love.\n    *   Voznesensky's most famous work involving a historical voyager is the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\"). This work is about the expedition of Nikolai Rezanov.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second clue:** \"...and wondered, 'Where is your grave, even a mound?'\"\n    *   This is a direct quote or a paraphrase from Voznesensky's work. It indicates that the man's burial site was unknown or lost at the time the poem was written (the libretto for \"Juno and Avos\" was written in the 1970s).\n    *   Nikolai Rezanov died in 1807 in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, while on his way back to St. Petersburg from Russian America. His original grave was at the Voskresensky Cathedral, which was destroyed by the Soviets in the mid-20th century, and the exact location of his remains was lost. This fact aligns perfectly with the clue. The popularity of \"Juno and Avos\" created a huge public interest in finding his lost grave.\n\n3.  **Analyze the third clue:** \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\"\n    *   This provides a specific timeframe for the rediscovery of the grave.\n    *   Following the immense success of the rock opera, a movement began in Krasnoyarsk to locate Rezanov's grave.\n    *   Historical and archaeological investigations took place, and in the late 1980s, the presumed location of his grave at the Trinity Cemetery (where some remains from the destroyed cathedral were reburied) was identified. A large white cross was erected as a cenotaph in 1989, symbolically answering Voznesensky's question. This timeline matches the clue precisely.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll three clues point to the same historical figure: Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov, the protagonist of Andrei Voznesensky's rock opera \"Juno and Avos\". He was a diplomat and explorer (\"sailor\"), his grave was lost for decades (prompting the question in the poem), and its location was rediscovered in the late 1980s, largely due to the interest generated by Voznesensky's work. The question asks for the man's last name.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The term \"sailor\" is used metaphorically by the poet, as Rezanov was more of a diplomat and statesman, but he led a major sea expedition.\n*   The rediscovery of the grave was a significant cultural event in the late Soviet period, directly linking the historical figure to the contemporary art that celebrated him.\n*   The question is not about the poet (Voznesensky) but about the subject of his poem.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
