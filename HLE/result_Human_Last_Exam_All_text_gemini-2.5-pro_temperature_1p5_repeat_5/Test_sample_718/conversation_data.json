    "An analysis of the question is provided below, followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**: We are asked to find the number $n$ for which any \"tame\" functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is \"$n$-resolvable\", given that $J$ is an upper semilattice. Let's define the key terms:\n    *   **Upper Semilattice ($J$)**: A partially ordered set (poset) where every pair of elements has a least upper bound (or join, denoted by $\\vee$).\n    *   **Functor ($f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$)**: A representation of the poset $J$. We view $J$ as a category where objects are elements of $J$ and there's a unique morphism from $j_1$ to $j_2$ if and only if $j_1 \\le j_2$. The functor $f$ assigns a vector space $f(j)$ to each $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f(j_1 \\le j_2): f(j_1) \\to f(j_2)$ for each relation $j_1 \\le j_2$, respecting composition.\n    *   **Tame Functor**: The problem defines a functor $f$ as tame if it is a direct sum of indecomposable functors $M$, and for each such $M$, the dimension of the vector space $M(j)$ is at most 1 for all $j \\in J$. These indecomposable summands are often called \"0-1 representations\".\n    *   **$n$-resolvable Functor**: A functor $F$ is $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. This means there exists an exact sequence $P_n \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to F \\to 0$ where each $P_i$ is a projective object in the category of functors $\\text{Vect}_K^J$. This is equivalent to saying that the projective dimension of $F$, denoted $\\text{pd}(F)$, is at most $n$. The question asks for the smallest integer $n$ that works for all tame functors. This is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all tame functors.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functor Category**:\n    *   The category $\\text{Vect}_K^J$ is an abelian category with enough projectives.\n    *   The basic building blocks for projective objects are the **principal projective functors** $P_j$ for each $j \\in J$. The functor $P_j$ is the representable functor $K\\text{Hom}_J(j, -)$. Its definition is $P_j(k) = K$ if $j \\le k$ and $P_j(k) = 0$ otherwise.\n    *   Any projective functor is a direct sum of these $P_j$'s.\n\n3.  **Analyze an Indecomposable Tame Functor**:\n    *   Since the projective dimension of a direct sum of functors is the supremum of their individual projective dimensions, we can focus on finding the projective dimension of a single indecomposable tame functor, let's call it $M$.\n    *   By definition of tame, $\\dim_K M(j) \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. Let $S = \\{j \\in J \\mid \\dim_K M(j) = 1\\}$. For $M$ to be a valid functor, $S$ must be an **up-set** (or a filter), meaning if $s \\in S$ and $s \\le s'$, then $s' \\in S$. Let's denote such a functor by $I_S$.\n    *   For $I_S$ to be indecomposable, its support poset $S$ must be connected (as a graph of comparability relations).\n\n4.  **Construct a Projective Resolution for $I_S$**: Our goal is to find the projective dimension of $I_S$.\n    *   **Step 0 (The Zeroth Projective $P_0$)**: We can map a projective functor onto $I_S$. Let $S_{\\min}$ be the set of minimal elements of $S$. For each $s \\in S_{\\min}$, we take the projective functor $P_s$. Let $P_0 = \\bigoplus_{s \\in S_{\\min}} P_s$. We can define a surjective morphism $d_0: P_0 \\to I_S$. For any $j \\in S$, we need the map $d_0(j): P_0(j) \\to I_S(j)$ to be surjective. The domain is $P_0(j) = \\bigoplus_{s \\in S_{\\min}, s \\le j} K$ and the codomain is $I_S(j) = K$. The map is simply summing the components. Since $j \\in S$, there must be at least one minimal element $s \\in S_{\\min}$ with $s \\le j$, so the domain is non-zero and the map is surjective.\n\n    *   **Step 1 (The Kernel $K_0$ and the First Projective $P_1$)**: Now we examine the kernel, $K_0 = \\ker(d_0)$. At any point $j \\in J$, the kernel $K_0(j)$ consists of tuples $(c_s)_{s \\in S_{\\min}, s \\le j}$ such that $\\sum c_s = 0$. This vector space is spanned by elements of the form $e_s - e_{s'}$, where $e_s$ is the basis vector corresponding to the component $P_s$. Such a \"relation\" $e_s - e_{s'}$ is generated whenever we are at a point $j$ that is an upper bound of both $s$ and $s'$.\n    *   Crucially, since $J$ is an **upper semilattice**, for any pair of minimal elements $s, s' \\in S_{\\min}$, their least upper bound $s \\vee s'$ exists. The relation $e_s - e_{s'}$ can be seen as \"originating\" at $s \\vee s'$.\n    *   This suggests how to build a projective cover for $K_0$. For each pair (or for a chosen generating set) of relations like $e_s - e_{s'}$, we can use the projective $P_{s \\vee s'}$ to map onto it. Let's form the projective functor $P_1 = \\bigoplus_{s,s' \\in S_{\\min}} P_{s \\vee s'}$. We can define a morphism $d_1: P_1 \\to P_0$ where the canonical generator of a component $P_{s \\vee s'}$ maps to the element representing $e_s - e_{s'}$ in $P_0(s \\vee s')$.\n    *   A careful check shows that the image of this map $d_1$ is precisely the kernel $K_0$. The image of $d_1$ at a point $j$ is spanned by vectors $\\{e_s - e_{s'} \\mid s, s' \\in S_{\\min}, s \\vee s' \\le j\\}$. The kernel $K_0(j)$ is spanned by $\\{e_s - e_{s'} \\mid s, s' \\in S_{\\min}, s \\le j, s' \\le j\\}$. The conditions on the right of the \"|\" are equivalent: $s \\le j$ and $s' \\le j$ if and only if $s \\vee s' \\le j$ (by definition of least upper bound). Thus, $\\text{Im}(d_1) = K_0$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Projective Dimension**:\n    *   We have constructed an exact sequence: $P_1 \\xrightarrow{d_1} P_0 \\xrightarrow{d_0} I_S \\to 0$.\n    *   This is a projective resolution of $I_S$ of length 1. Therefore, the projective dimension of any indecomposable tame functor $I_S$ is at most 1, i.e., $\\text{pd}(I_S) \\le 1$.\n    *   If $I_S$ is not itself projective (which occurs when $S$ has more than one minimal element), its projective dimension is exactly 1. If $I_S$ is projective ($S$ has a unique minimal element), its dimension is 0.\n    *   The maximum possible projective dimension for an indecomposable tame functor is 1.\n    *   For any tame functor $f = \\bigoplus M_i$, its projective dimension is $\\text{pd}(f) = \\sup_i \\text{pd}(M_i) \\le 1$.\n    *   Thus, any tame functor on an upper semilattice is at most 1-resolvable. The value can be 0 or 1, but it never exceeds 1.\n\n6.  **Final Answer Formulation**: The question asks for the value of $n$ for which any such functor is $n$-resolvable. This means we are looking for the smallest $n$ that serves as an upper bound for the projective dimension of all tame functors. Based on our analysis, this upper bound is 1."
