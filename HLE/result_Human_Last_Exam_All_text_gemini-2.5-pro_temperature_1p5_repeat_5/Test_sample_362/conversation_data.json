    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Wittig reaction in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Carbonyl Compound:** The first reactant is pivalaldehyde. The \"pival-\" prefix refers to the tert-butyl group, (CH₃)₃C-. The \"-aldehyde\" suffix indicates a -CHO functional group. Therefore, the structure of pivalaldehyde (IUPAC name: 2,2-dimethylpropanal) is:\n        ```\n            CH3\n             |\n        CH3--C--CHO\n             |\n            CH3\n        ```\n    *   **Wittig Reagent (Phosphorus Ylide):** The second reactant is (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. Let's break down this name to determine its structure:\n        *   \"triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane\" is the triphenylphosphine part, P(C₆H₅)₃ or PPh₃.\n        *   \"ethylidene\" refers to a two-carbon group attached via a double bond to the phosphorus, of the form =CH-CH₃.\n        *   \"2-(2-chlorophenyl)\" means that at position 2 of the ethylidene group, there is a 2-chlorophenyl substituent (a benzene ring with a chlorine atom at the ortho position).\n        *   Combining these parts, the structure of the ylide is:\n        ```\n             Cl\n            /\n        (Ph)₃P=CH-CH₂--(Benzene ring)\n        ```\n        This molecule exists as a resonance hybrid of the ylide (P=C double bond) and the zwitterionic ylene form (P⁺-C⁻).\n\n2.  **Determine the Type of Ylide:**\n    *   Phosphorus ylides are classified as \"stabilized\" or \"unstabilized\". An ylide is stabilized if the negative charge on the carbanion (in the zwitterionic form) can be delocalized by an adjacent electron-withdrawing group (like C=O, CN, CO₂R).\n    *   In this case, the ylidic carbon (`=CH-`) is adjacent to a `-CH₂-` group, which is not electron-withdrawing. Therefore, this is an **unstabilized ylide**.\n\n3.  **Predict the Reaction Mechanism and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Wittig reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of the ylidic carbon onto the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. This forms an oxaphosphetane intermediate, which then collapses to form the alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The stereochemical outcome of a Wittig reaction depends on the type of ylide. **Unstabilized ylides**, like the one used here, react with aldehydes under standard conditions to give the **(Z)-alkene (cis-isomer)** as the major product. This is because the initial cycloaddition is kinetically controlled and leads preferentially to the cis-substituted oxaphosphetane intermediate.\n\n4.  **Form the Alkene Product:**\n    *   The core of the Wittig reaction is the replacement of the carbonyl oxygen (`=O`) with the carbon group from the ylide (`=CR₂`).\n    *   The new double bond will form between the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon and the ylide's carbon.\n        *   The aldehyde contributes: a `(CH₃)₃C` group and a `H` atom to one side of the new C=C double bond.\n        *   The ylide contributes: a `-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)` group and a `H` atom to the other side of the new C=C double bond.\n    *   The resulting product structure is:\n        `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)`\n\n5.  **Assign the Final Structure and Name:**\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** As determined in step 3, the major product will be the (Z)-isomer. We need to assign priorities based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n        *   On the carbon from the aldehyde: The priority is `(CH₃)₃C` > `H`.\n        *   On the carbon from the ylide: The priority is `-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)` > `H`.\n        *   In the (Z)-isomer, the two higher-priority groups, `(CH₃)₃C` and `-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)`, are on the same side of the double bond.\n        ```\n             (CH₃)₃C        CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)\n                  \\          /\n                   C   ===   C\n                  /          \\\n                 H            H\n        ```\n    *   **IUPAC Name:**\n        1.  Find the longest carbon chain containing the double bond: It is a 5-carbon chain (pentene).\n            `(2-chlorophenyl)-CH₂(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-C(4)(CH₃)₂-CH₃(5)`\n        2.  Number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible locant: Numbering from the end closer to the phenyl group gives the double bond starting at C2 (`pent-2-ene`).\n        3.  Identify and number the substituents:\n            *   At position 1: a `(2-chlorophenyl)` group.\n            *   At position 4: two `methyl` groups.\n        4.  Combine the parts, including the stereodescriptor: **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correctly interpreting the reactant names:** \"Pivalaldehyde\" and the complex ylide name must be accurately translated into chemical structures.\n*   **Classifying the ylide:** Identifying the ylide as unstabilized is the key to predicting the stereochemistry. A stabilized ylide would have given the (E)-alkene.\n*   **Applying stereochemistry rules:** Knowing that unstabilized ylides give (Z)-alkenes is crucial.\n*   **Systematic Naming:** Following IUPAC rules carefully is necessary to arrive at the correct name for the complex product molecule.\n\nThe final product of the reaction is the Z-isomer of 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n<<<(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
