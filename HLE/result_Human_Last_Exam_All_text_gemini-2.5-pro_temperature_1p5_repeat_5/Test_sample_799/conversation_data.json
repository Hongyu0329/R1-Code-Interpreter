    "Answering this question requires combining definitions and results from additive combinatorics and geometric measure theory. Let's break down the problem into two main parts: finding an upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set, and then showing that this bound is achievable.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Definitions**\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A set of real numbers $A \\subset [0, 1]$ is called a Sidon set (or a $B_2$ set) if for any four elements $a, b, c, d \\in A$, the equation $a+b = c+d$ implies that the multisets $\\{a, b\\}$ and $\\{c, d\\}$ are identical. This means either ($a=c$ and $b=d$) or ($a=d$ and $b=c$).\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension ($\\dim_H$)**: A measure of the \"fractal\" dimension of a set. It generalizes the notion of dimension to non-integer values. For a set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, its dimension can be any real number between 0 and 1.\n\n**2. Finding an Upper Bound**\n\nThe core idea is that the Sidon property imposes a strong structural constraint on the set, preventing it from being \"too dense\". This sparsity limits its Hausdorff dimension. We can show that if the dimension were greater than 1/2, a contradiction would arise.\n\nHere is a sketch of the argument for the upper bound:\n\n*   **Sidon property and differences:** A key insight is that the Sidon property for a set $A$ is equivalent to the property that all its non-zero differences are unique. That is, if $a, b, c, d \\in A$ and $a-b = c-d \\neq 0$, then it must be that $a=c$ and $b=d$.\n    *   *Proof sketch:* $a-b = c-d \\implies a+d = c+b$. The Sidon property on $a+d=c+b$ implies $\\{a,d\\}=\\{c,b\\}$. If $a=c$, then $d=b$. If $a=d$, then $b=c$, which means $a-b = b-a$, implying $a-b=0$, which contradicts the assumption that the difference is non-zero. So the only possibility for non-zero differences is that the pair $(a,b)$ is identical to $(c,d)$.\n\n*   **Dimension and Projections:** Let's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a Sidon set $A \\subset [0,1]$ with $\\dim_H(A) = s > 1/2$.\n    *   Consider the Cartesian product $A \\times A = \\{(x,y) : x,y \\in A\\}$. A standard result in geometric measure theory states that $\\dim_H(A \\times A) = \\dim_H(A) + \\dim_H(A) = 2s$.\n    *   Since we assumed $s > 1/2$, we have $\\dim_H(A \\times A) = 2s > 1$.\n    *   Now, consider the set of differences $A-A = \\{x-y : x,y \\in A\\}$. This set is the image of $A \\times A$ under the linear projection map $f(x,y) = x-y$.\n    *   A fundamental result, Marstrand's Projection Theorem (generalized by Mattila), states that if a set $E \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ has $\\dim_H(E) > 1$, its projection onto almost every line has positive one-dimensional Lebesgue measure. For a fixed projection like $f(x,y)=x-y$, a more specific theorem confirms that the image $A-A$ must have positive Lebesgue measure.\n\n*   **The Contradiction:** So, if $\\dim_H(A) > 1/2$, the set of differences $A-A$ must have positive Lebesgue measure (i.e., it \"fills up\" a portion of the real line). However, the property that all non-zero differences are unique implies that the set $A-A$ is very \"sparse\". It can be shown that such a set must have Lebesgue measure zero. This contradicts the conclusion from the projection theorem. Therefore, our initial assumption must be false.\n\n*   **Conclusion of Upper Bound:** We conclude that any Sidon set $A \\subset [0,1]$ must have a Hausdorff dimension $\\dim_H(A) \\le 1/2$.\n\n**3. Constructing a Sidon Set of Dimension 1/2**\n\nThe second part of the problem is to show that this upper bound of 1/2 is tight, meaning there actually exist Sidon sets that achieve this dimension. Proving this requires an explicit construction. Such constructions are non-trivial and often rely on probabilistic methods or sophisticated number-theoretic choices for digits in a Cantor-like construction.\n\n*   **Cantor-like Construction:** One can build a set by specifying its representation in some base. For example, define a set $E = \\{\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{d_k}{n_1 n_2 \\dots n_k} : d_k \\in D_k\\}$, where $D_k \\subset \\{0, \\dots, n_k-1\\}$ is a carefully chosen set of \"digits\". The dimension of this set is related to the sizes of the digit sets $|D_k|$ and the \"bases\" $n_k$.\n*   **Astels' Construction (2000):** Building on work by J.-P. Kahane, S. Astels provided a construction of this type. The idea is to choose the digit sets $D_k$ to be Sidon sets of integers modulo $n_k$. To prevent the \"carries\" in the addition from destroying the Sidon property of the resulting real numbers, the bases $n_k$ must be chosen to be very large in comparison to the size of the digit sets, $|D_k|$. Specifically, one can choose $|D_k| = d$ and $n_k \\approx 2d^2$. The Hausdorff dimension of the resulting set is then $\\frac{\\log|D_k|}{\\log n_k} \\approx \\frac{\\log d}{\\log(2d^2)} = \\frac{\\log d}{2\\log d + \\log 2}$. As we let the size of the digit sets $d$ go to infinity, this ratio approaches $1/2$.\n*   This construction demonstrates that we can create Sidon sets with Hausdorff dimensions arbitrarily close to 1/2. Therefore, the supremum of the possible dimensions is at least 1/2.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the two parts:\n1.  The Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in $[0,1]$ is at most 1/2.\n2.  There exist Sidon sets in $[0,1]$ whose Hausdorff dimension is arbitrarily close to 1/2.\n\nThus, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in $[0,1]$ is exactly 1/2.\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
