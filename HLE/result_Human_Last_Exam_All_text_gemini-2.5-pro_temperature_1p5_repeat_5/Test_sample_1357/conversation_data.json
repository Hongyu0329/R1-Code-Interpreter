    "This problem requires us to classify the possible structures of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve whose Jacobian has good reduction.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the connection between Jacobian reduction and curve reduction\n\nThe core of the problem lies in a fundamental result by Raynaud concerning the reduction of curves and their Jacobians. The theorem states:\n\nA curve $C$ of genus $g \\ge 2$ defined over a valuation field $K$ has a Jacobian variety $J(C)$ with **good reduction** if and only if the **stable reduction** of $C$, let's call it $C_s$, satisfies the following two conditions:\n1.  The dual graph of $C_s$ is a **tree**. (The dual graph has a vertex for each irreducible component of $C_s$ and an edge for each node connecting two components).\n2.  The sum of the geometric genera of the irreducible components of $C_s$ is equal to the genus of the original curve $C$.\n\nIn our case, the curve $C$ has genus 4. Therefore, we need to find the number of \"types\" of stable curves $C_s$ of arithmetic genus 4 such that:\n1.  Its dual graph is a tree.\n2.  If $C_s$ is composed of irreducible components $C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n$ with geometric genera $g_1, g_2, \\ldots, g_n$, then $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i = 4$.\n\n### Step 2: The stability condition\n\nA nodal curve is **stable** if each of its irreducible components is stable in a specific sense. For an irreducible component $C_i$ of geometric genus $g_i$ on which lie $d_i$ nodes (connecting it to other components, since the dual graph is a tree), the stability condition is:\n$2g_i - 2 + d_i > 0$\n\nHere, $d_i$ is simply the degree of the corresponding vertex in the dual graph. Our task is to classify all possible decorated graphs (trees with a genus assigned to each vertex) that satisfy these conditions.\n\n### Step 3: Systematic Classification\n\nWe can classify the types of stable reductions by the number of irreducible components, $n$, and the number of genus 0 components (rational curves, $\\mathbb{P}^1$s), which we denote by $k$.\n\nFor a component with genus $g_i=0$, the stability condition becomes $2(0) - 2 + d_i > 0$, which implies $d_i > 2$, so $d_i \\ge 3$. Any rational curve in the stable reduction must be connected to at least three other components. For a component with $g_i \\ge 1$, the stability condition $2g_i - 2 + d_i > 0$ is satisfied if $d_i \\ge 1$.\n\nLet's organize the count by $k$, the number of genus 0 components. A useful inequality, derived from graph theory and the stability conditions, is that $k \\le n_+ - 2$, where $n_+$ is the number of components with genus greater than 0. Since $\\sum g_i = 4$ and $g_i \\ge 1$ for these components, we must have $n_+ \\le 4$. This implies $k \\le 4-2=2$. So, we only need to check $k=0, 1, 2$.\n\n**Case 1: No genus 0 components ($k=0$)**\nAll components have genus $g_i \\ge 1$. The sum of genera is 4. We consider partitions of 4 into positive integers.\n\n*   **Partition {4}**: One component of genus 4. The dual graph is a single vertex. This is a smooth curve of genus 4. (1 type)\n*   **Partition {3, 1}**: A genus 3 curve connected to a genus 1 curve. (1 type)\n*   **Partition {2, 2}**: Two genus 2 curves connected to each other. (1 type)\n*   **Partition {2, 1, 1}**: Three components. The only connecting graph (tree) is a path $C_i-C_j-C_k$. The genera can be arranged in two distinct ways:\n    *   (g=1)---(g=2)---(g=1).\n    *   (g=2)---(g=1)---(g=1).\n    Both are stable. (2 types)\n*   **Partition {1, 1, 1, 1}**: Four genus 1 components. There are two non-isomorphic trees on 4 vertices:\n    *   Path graph ($P_4$).\n    *   Star graph ($K_{1,3}$).\n    Both are stable. (2 types)\n\nTotal for $k=0$: $1+1+1+2+2 = 7$ types.\n\n**Case 2: One genus 0 component ($k=1$)**\nThe $\\mathbb{P}^1$ component must have degree $d \\ge 3$. The sum of the genera of the other components is 4.\n\n*   The components with $g>0$ must form a partition of 4 into $n_+$ parts, where $n_+ \\ge 3$ since the $\\mathbb{P}^1$ must have degree at least 3.\n    *   **Partition {2, 1, 1}**: Three components (g=2, g=1, g=1) attached to a central $\\mathbb{P}^1$. (Dual graph $K_{1,3}$). This is stable. (1 type)\n*   Now consider that the total number of components is $n=n_++1$.\n    *   Let $n_+=4$, so the partition is **{1, 1, 1, 1}**. Total components $n=5$. The $\\mathbb{P}^1$ must connect to these 4 components. To be a tree, this can be done in two ways corresponding to the two non-isomorphic trees on 5 vertices that have one vertex of degree $\\ge 3$ (where the $\\mathbb{P}^1$ must be located):\n        *   Star graph ($K_{1,4}$): The $\\mathbb{P}^1$ is the center, connected to four genus 1 curves. This is stable.\n        *   A different tree: A central $\\mathbb{P}^1$ (degree 3) connected to two genus 1 curves and to a third branch which is a chain of two genus 1 curves. This is also stable.\n    (2 types)\n\nTotal for $k=1$: $1+2 = 3$ types.\n\n**Case 3: Two genus 0 components ($k=2$)**\nBoth $\\mathbb{P}^1$s must have degree $\\ge 3$. The sum of the genera of the other components is 4. The inequality $k \\le n_+ - 2$ implies $2 \\le n_+ - 2$, so we need at least $n_+=4$ positive-genus components.\n\n*   **Partition {1, 1, 1, 1}**: Four genus 1 components. The total number of components is $n=2+4=6$. We need to find a tree on 6 vertices with two specified vertices (the $\\mathbb{P}^1$s) having degree at least 3. There is only one such minimal configuration:\n    *   Two central $\\mathbb{P}^1$s are connected to each other. Each $\\mathbb{P}^1$ is also connected to two genus 1 curves (leaves). This makes the degree of each $\\mathbb{P}^1$ equal to 3, satisfying the stability condition. (1 type)\n\nTotal for $k=2$: $1$ type.\n\n### Final Count\n\nSumming the counts from all cases:\n*   Types with $k=0$: 7\n*   Types with $k=1$: 3\n*   Types with $k=2$: 1\n\nThe total number of types of stable reductions is $7 + 3 + 1 = 11$.\n\n<<<11>>>"
