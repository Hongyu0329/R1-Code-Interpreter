    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruction of the Problem Statement**\n\nFirst, let's understand the key mathematical objects and concepts involved in the question.\n\n*   **Metric Continuum:** A compact, connected, non-empty metric space.\n*   **Hereditary Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is *indecomposable* if it cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. It is *hereditary indecomposable* if every subcontinuum of $X$ is also indecomposable. A canonical example is the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Composant:** In an indecomposable continuum $K$, the composant of a point $p \\in K$ is the set of all points $q \\in K$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $K$ containing both $p$ and $q$. An indecomposable continuum is a union of its pairwise disjoint composants.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification:** For a Tychonoff space $Y$ (which includes all metric spaces), its Stone-Cech compactification, denoted $\\beta Y$, is a compact Hausdorff space containing $Y$ as a dense subspace. It has the universal property that any continuous function from $Y$ to any compact Hausdorff space $K$ can be uniquely extended to a continuous function from $\\beta Y$ to $K$.\n*   **Stone-Cech Remainder:** For a locally compact, non-compact space $Y$, its Stone-Cech remainder is the set $Y^* = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$.\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, where $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum and $x$ is a point in $X$. Let's denote this remainder by $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$.\n\n### **Step 2: Determining the Topological Nature of the Remainder R**\n\nTo find the number of composants of $R$, we must first understand what kind of topological space $R$ is. Specifically, we need to know if it is an indecomposable continuum.\n\n1.  **Is R a continuum?**\n    A continuum is a compact and connected space.\n    *   **Compactness:** The Stone-Cech remainder $R = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$ is a closed subset of the compact space $\\beta Y$, so it is always compact.\n    *   **Connectedness:** The connectedness of the remainder $R$ depends on the properties of the original space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$.\n        *   The space $Y$ is an open subspace of the compact metric space $X$. Thus, $Y$ is a locally compact, separable metric (and thus sigma-compact) space.\n        *   For such a space, a key theorem states that its Stone-Cech remainder is connected if and only if the space has exactly one \"end\".\n        *   A fundamental theorem by H. Cook (1967) states that if $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable continuum, then for any point $x \\in X$, the space $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ has exactly one end.\n    *   Combining these facts, we conclude that the remainder $R$ is a connected compact space, i.e., a continuum.\n\n2.  **Is R an indecomposable continuum?**\n    The question of composants is only meaningful for indecomposable continua.\n    *   A deep result by M. Smith (1988) answers this directly: If $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable continuum, then the remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is also a hereditary indecomposable continuum.\n    *   Therefore, $R$ is not only indecomposable but hereditarily indecomposable.\n\n### **Step 3: Determining if the Remainder R is Metrizable**\n\nThe number of composants of an indecomposable continuum is determined by whether the continuum is metrizable.\n\n1.  **Condition for Metrizability of the Remainder:** For a locally compact, sigma-compact space $Y$, its Stone-Cech remainder $R = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$ is metrizable if and only if $Y$ is **hemicompact**.\n2.  **Is Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\} hemicompact?** A space $Y$ is hemicompact if there exists a countable sequence of compact subsets $\\{K_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ of $Y$ such that every compact subset of $Y$ is contained in at least one of the $K_n$.\n    *   Let $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Since $X$ is a metric space, we can choose a countable nested neighborhood basis for the point $x$, say $\\{U_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$, where each $U_n$ is an open set in $X$ containing $x$. For instance, we could take $U_n = B(x, 1/n) \\cap X$.\n    *   Let $K_n = X \\setminus U_n$. Each $K_n$ is a closed subset of the compact space $X$, so it is compact. Since $x \\notin K_n$, each $K_n$ is a compact subset of $Y$.\n    *   Now, let $K$ be any compact subset of $Y$. This means $K$ is a compact subset of $X$ and $x \\notin K$. Since $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space, it is normal. Therefore, the disjoint closed sets $\\{x\\}$ and $K$ can be separated by disjoint open sets. This means there is an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $K \\cap U = \\emptyset$.\n    *   Since $\\{U_n\\}$ is a neighborhood basis for $x$, there must be some $m$ such that $U_m \\subseteq U$. For this $m$, we have $K \\cap U_m = \\emptyset$, which is equivalent to $K \\subseteq X \\setminus U_m = K_m$.\n    *   Thus, any compact set $K \\subseteq Y$ is contained in some $K_m$ from our countable sequence. This proves that $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is hemicompact.\n3.  **Conclusion on Metrizability:** Since $Y$ is hemicompact, its Stone-Cech remainder $R$ is a metrizable space.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Number of Composants**\n\nWe have established that for any hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and any $x \\in X$, the remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is a **hereditary indecomposable metric continuum**.\n\nNow we can answer the question about the number of its composants.\n\n1.  **A Classical Result:** For any indecomposable metric continuum $K$, the number of its composants is exactly $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n2.  **Reasoning (Baire Category Theorem):**\n    *   An indecomposable metric continuum $K$ is a complete metric space.\n    *   Each composant of $K$ is a dense $F_\\sigma$ set (a countable union of closed sets).\n    *   Each of these closed sets is a proper subcontinuum, which must be nowhere dense in $K$. Therefore, each composant is a meager set (a set of the first category).\n    *   The entire space $K$ is the union of all its composants.\n    *   The Baire Category Theorem implies that a complete metric space cannot be a meager set in itself. A stronger result states that in a Polish space (which $K$ is), the union of fewer than $2^{\\aleph_0}$ meager sets is still a meager set.\n    *   Since $K$ is not meager, it cannot be expressed as the union of fewer than $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants. Thus, there must be at least $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants.\n    *   The number of points in any non-degenerate metric continuum is $2^{\\aleph_0}$. Since each point belongs to a unique composant, there can be at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants.\n    *   Therefore, the number of composants is exactly $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nOur analysis shows that for *any* choice of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and a point $x \\in X$, the resulting Stone-Cech remainder $R$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum. Consequently, the number of composants of $R$ is always $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nThe question asks for the **maximum possible number** of a composants. Since this number is constant for all valid choices of $X$ and $x$, this constant value is also the maximum.\n\nThe maximum possible number of a composants is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n<<<2^{\\aleph_0}>>>"
