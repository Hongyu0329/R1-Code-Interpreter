    "Answering this question involves solving a complex equation with a complex exponent.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Rewrite the equation:** The given equation is $z \\cdot i = i^z$. The term $i^z$ is a multi-valued complex exponentiation. We need to express it in a more standard form.\n    The definition of complex exponentiation is $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$. Here, $a=i$ and $b=z$.\n\n2.  **Handle the complex logarithm:** The complex logarithm is multi-valued.\n    $\\log(i) = \\text{Ln}|i| + i(\\arg(i) + 2k\\pi)$, for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Since $|i|=1$ and $\\arg(i)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have:\n    $\\log(i) = \\text{Ln}(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\n    For simplicity, let's define a constant $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for each integer $k$. So, $\\log(i) = iC_k$.\n\n3.  **Substitute into the original equation:** Now, the right-hand side (RHS) becomes:\n    $i^z = e^{z \\log(i)} = e^{z \\cdot iC_k}$.\n    The original equation is now $z \\cdot i = e^{ziC_k}$.\n\n4.  **Simplify using a substitution:** This equation can be simplified significantly. Let $w = z \\cdot i$. This means the left-hand side (LHS) is just $w$. We need to express the $z$ on the RHS in terms of $w$.\n    From $w=z \\cdot i$, we can solve for $z$:\n    $z = \\frac{w}{i} = \\frac{w(-i)}{i(-i)} = -iw$.\n    Now substitute this back into the equation $w = e^{ziC_k}$:\n    $w = e^{(-iw)iC_k} = e^{-i^2wC_k} = e^{wC_k}$.\n\n5.  **Solve the simplified equation using the Lambert W function:** The equation is now $w = e^{wC_k}$. This is a standard form that can be solved using the Lambert W function, which is defined as the solution to the equation $W(x)e^{W(x)}=x$.\n    To transform $w = e^{wC_k}$ into the required form, we rearrange it:\n    $w e^{-wC_k} = 1$\n    Multiply both sides by $-C_k$:\n    $(-wC_k) e^{-wC_k} = -C_k$\n    Let $v = -wC_k$. The equation becomes $v e^v = -C_k$.\n    By the definition of the Lambert W function, the solution for $v$ is $v = W(-C_k)$.\n\n6.  **Handle the multi-valued nature of the Lambert W function:** For a complex argument, the Lambert W function is multi-valued, with branches indexed by an integer $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. We denote these branches as $W_m$. So, the complete set of solutions for $v$ is:\n    $v = W_m(-C_k)$ for all integers $k, m$.\n\n7.  **Back-substitute to find z:** Now we solve for $z$ by substituting back.\n    First, find $w$:\n    $v = -wC_k \\implies w = -\\frac{v}{C_k} = -\\frac{W_m(-C_k)}{C_k}$.\n    Next, find $z$:\n    $z = -iw = -i \\left(-\\frac{W_m(-C_k)}{C_k}\\right) = i \\frac{W_m(-C_k)}{C_k}$.\n\n8.  **Write the final answer:** Finally, substitute the expression for $C_k$ back into the solution for $z$. The solution set for $z$ depends on the two integers $k$ (from the logarithm) and $m$ (from the Lambert W function).\n    $z_{k,m} = i \\frac{W_m(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$, for all integers $k, m$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The primary source of multiple solutions is the multi-valued nature of the complex logarithm, introducing the integer parameter $k$.\n*   The equation $w=e^{cw}$ gives rise to another set of multiple solutions, which are neatly expressed using the different branches of the Lambert W function, indexed by the integer $m$.\n*   The substitution $w = z \\cdot i$ is a crucial step that simplifies the equation into a standard form. Without it, solving the system of equations for the real and imaginary parts of $z$ is significantly more complicated.\n*   The denominator $\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ is never zero for any integer $k$, so the expression is always well-defined.\n*   This general solution includes all types of solutions: purely imaginary ones (when $k \\le -1$ and $m=0$, making $W_m(-C_k)$ real) and other complex solutions for all other combinations of $k$ and $m$.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe set of all solutions $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is given by:\n$z = i \\frac{W_m(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$\nwhere $k$ and $m$ are any integers, and $W_m$ denotes the $m$-th branch of the Lambert W function.\n\n<<<z = i * (W_m(- (pi/2 + 2*k*pi)))/(pi/2 + 2*k*pi), for k, m in Z>>>"
