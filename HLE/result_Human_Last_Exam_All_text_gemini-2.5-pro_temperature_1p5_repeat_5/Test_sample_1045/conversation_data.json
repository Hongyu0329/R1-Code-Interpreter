    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem**\n\n*   **Molecule:** Toluene\n*   **Chemical Formula:** C7H8\n*   **Basis Set:** 6-31G\n*   **Question:** Determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs), which are also referred to as basis functions.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Composition of Toluene (C7H8)**\n\nFirst, we need to count the number of atoms of each element in the molecule.\n*   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n*   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 8\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 6-31G Basis Set**\n\nThe notation \"6-31G\" describes how many CGFs are used for each atom and how they are constructed from primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs). We need to determine the number of CGFs for Carbon and Hydrogen separately.\n\n**For a Carbon atom (C), a second-row element:**\n\n*   **The '6'**: This refers to the core electrons (the 1s orbital). It means the single core orbital is represented by **one contracted Gaussian function (CGF)**, which is constructed from a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    *   Contribution from core: 1 CGF\n*   **The '-31'**: This refers to the valence electrons (the 2s and 2p orbitals). The valence shell is \"split\" into two sets of basis functions: an inner part and an outer part.\n    *   **Inner Valence ('3')**: The inner part is represented by one CGF for the 2s orbital and one set of CGFs for the 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz). Each of these CGFs is constructed from 3 PGFs.\n        *   1 s-type CGF + 3 p-type CGFs = **4 CGFs**\n    *   **Outer Valence ('1')**: The outer part is also represented by one s-type CGF and three p-type CGFs. Each of these CGFs consists of just 1 PGF (they are \"uncontracted\").\n        *   1 s-type CGF + 3 p-type CGFs = **4 CGFs**\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 CGFs**.\n\n**For a Hydrogen atom (H):**\n\n*   Hydrogen has no core electrons, so only the valence description ('-31') applies to its 1s orbital.\n    *   **Inner Valence ('3')**: The 1s orbital is described by one CGF constructed from 3 PGFs.\n        *   Contribution from inner part: **1 CGF**\n    *   **Outer Valence ('1')**: The 1s orbital is described by a second CGF which consists of a single PGF.\n        *   Contribution from outer part: **1 CGF**\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of CGFs for Toluene (C7H8)**\n\nNow we multiply the number of CGFs per atom by the number of atoms of that type in the molecule and sum the results.\n\n*   **Total CGFs from Carbon:** 7 Carbon atoms × 9 CGFs/Carbon atom = 63 CGFs\n*   **Total CGFs from Hydrogen:** 8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 CGFs/Hydrogen atom = 16 CGFs\n*   **Grand Total:** 63 + 16 = **79 CGFs**\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **CGFs vs. PGFs:** The question asks for Contracted Gaussian Functions (CGFs), not Primitive Gaussian Functions (PGFs). A CGF is a single basis function, which can be a linear combination of one or more PGFs.\n2.  **Interpreting the Basis Set Name:** It's crucial to correctly interpret what \"6-31G\" means for both heavy atoms (like Carbon) and for Hydrogen. The rules are different for each.\n3.  **Valence Orbitals:** Remember that for second-row elements like Carbon, the valence shell includes both s and p orbitals (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz). The split-valence description applies to all of them.\n4.  **Atom Count:** Ensure the number of atoms for each element in toluene (C7H8) is counted correctly.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** The final step involves simple multiplication and addition, which should be performed carefully.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the final answer is 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
