The pharmacist should counsel Allison that taking Excedrin, which contains aspirin (an NSAID), while she is on fluoxetine (an SSRI) significantly increases her risk of stomach bleeding. For future headaches, a safer choice would be a medication containing only acetaminophen, like Tylenol. She should also be advised to report the new headache and the unusual smell she experienced to her doctor, as these could be side effects of the fluoxetine.
