    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the conductor and character properties\nFirst, we factorize the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$.\nSo, the prime power factorization is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters modulo each prime power factor:\n$\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nwhere $\\chi_{p^k}$ is a character modulo $p^k$.\n\nThere are two key properties we need to use:\n1.  **Conductor:** A character $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_{p^k}$ is primitive modulo $N = \\prod p^k$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_{p^k}$ is primitive modulo its corresponding prime power $p^k$.\n2.  **Order:** The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n\nWe are looking for characters where the conductor is exactly $N$ and the order is exactly 6.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the number and orders of primitive characters for each factor\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor $p^k$ of $N$. Let's denote the number of primitive characters of order $d$ modulo $q$ as $N_d(q)$.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$):** The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(4) = 2$. There is one principal character (order 1, conductor 1) and one non-principal character of order 2. For a character modulo 4 to be primitive, its conductor must be 4. The principal character is induced from modulus 1, so it is not primitive. The character of order 2 has conductor 4.\n    *   Number of primitive characters: 1. Its order is 2.\n    *   $N_2(4) = 1$.\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$):** The character group $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(9) = 6$. The non-primitive characters are those induced from modulus 3. The characters modulo 3 have orders 1 and 2. Therefore, the primitive characters modulo 9 are those with orders that are not 1 or 2. The possible orders of elements in a cyclic group of order 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6. So, the primitive characters must have orders 3 or 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order $d$ in a cyclic group of order 6 is $\\phi(d)$.\n    *   $N_3(9) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $N_6(9) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total primitive characters: $2+2=4$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7:** For a prime $p$, any non-principal character modulo $p$ is primitive. The character group $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(7) = 6$. The orders of primitive characters are the divisors of 6, except 1.\n    *   $N_2(7) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $N_3(7) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $N_6(7) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11:** The character group $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(11) = 10$. The orders of primitive characters are the divisors of 10, except 1.\n    *   Orders: 2, 5, 10.\n    *   $N_2(11) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $N_5(11) = \\phi(5) = 4$.\n    *   $N_{10}(11) = \\phi(10) = 4$.\n\n*   **Modulo 13:** The character group $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(13) = 12$. The orders of primitive characters are the divisors of 12, except 1.\n    *   Orders: 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n    *   $N_2(13) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $N_3(13) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $N_4(13) = \\phi(4) = 2$.\n    *   $N_6(13) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   $N_{12}(13) = \\phi(12) = 4$.\n\n### Step 3: Combine the component characters to have order 6\nWe need to select one primitive character for each factor $p^k$ such that the lcm of their orders is 6.\nLet the chosen characters be $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ with corresponding orders $(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$.\nFor $\\text{lcm}(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13}) = 6 = 2 \\times 3$, two conditions must be met:\n1.  Every order $o_i$ must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  At least one order must be a multiple of 2, and at least one order must be a multiple of 3.\n\nLet's count the number of available primitive characters for each factor whose order divides 6.\n*   **For $\\chi_4$**: The order is 2, which divides 6. There is **1** choice.\n*   **For $\\chi_9$**: The orders are 3 and 6. Both divide 6. There are $N_3(9) + N_6(9) = 2 + 2 = \\mathbf{4}$ choices.\n*   **For $\\chi_7$**: The orders are 2, 3, and 6. All divide 6. There are $N_2(7) + N_3(7) + N_6(7) = 1 + 2 + 2 = \\mathbf{5}$ choices.\n*   **For $\\chi_{11}$**: The orders are 2, 5, 10. Only order 2 divides 6. There is $N_2(11) = \\mathbf{1}$ choice.\n*   **For $\\chi_{13}$**: The orders are 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The orders dividing 6 are 2, 3, 6. There are $N_2(13) + N_3(13) + N_6(13) = 1 + 2 + 2 = \\mathbf{5}$ choices.\n\nNow, let's consider any combination of these selected characters. Let the tuple of their orders be $(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$.\n*   **Condition for multiple of 2:** The choice for $\\chi_4$ must be the character of order 2. So $o_4=2$. This guarantees that the lcm is a multiple of 2.\n*   **Condition for multiple of 3:** The choice for $\\chi_9$ must have order 3 or 6. Both are multiples of 3. So $o_9$ is always a multiple of 3. This guarantees that the lcm is a multiple of 3.\n\nSince every selected order $o_i$ is a divisor of 6, their lcm must also divide 6. Because the lcm is a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 3, it must be a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2,3)=6$.\nThus, any combination of characters chosen from our filtered sets will have an lcm of exactly 6.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total number\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component.\nNumber of characters = (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nNumber of characters = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nThere are 100 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6.\n\n<<<100>>>"
