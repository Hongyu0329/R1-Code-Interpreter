The laboratory's mistake was in their interpretation of the quality control (QC) results. The QC was performed with a bacterium (*Bacillus subtilis*) on a selective medium (PDA with chloramphenicol) that was designed to inhibit bacterial growth. The "expected result" for a successful QC of this selective medium should have been **no growth** of the bacterium, which would confirm the antibiotic was active. However, in Batch 3, the heat-labile chloramphenicol was destroyed during autoclaving. When the QC was performed, the bacterium grew on the agar from Batch 3. The laboratory staff mistakenly interpreted this growth as a positive sign that the media was fertile and effective, when it was actually direct evidence that the selective antibiotic was inactive and the batch was defective. They believed the evidence (bacterial growth) confirmed the media's quality, when it actually proved its failure.
