    "An analysis of the question step by step.\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Mathematical Objects**\n\n*   **A finite ultrametric space $X$**: This is a set $X$ with a finite number of points, equipped with a distance function $d(x, y)$ that satisfies the standard metric axioms plus the strong triangle inequality: $d(x, z) \\le \\max\\{d(x, y), d(y, z)\\}$. The finiteness of $X$ is crucial. The ultrametric property, as we will see, is less critical than it appears.\n\n*   **A Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$**: This is a complete normed vector space. The norm is typically over the field of real or complex numbers. The cardinality of the underlying set of vectors is denoted by $K$. If the dimension of the space is 1 or more, its cardinality $K$ is at least that of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. However, the definition of a Banach space does not forbid the zero-dimensional space $B = \\{0\\}$. In this case, $B$ has cardinality $K=1$.\n\n*   **Isometric embedding**: This is a map $f: X \\to B$ that preserves distances, meaning for any two points $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, the equality $d_B(f(x_1), f(x_2)) = d_X(x_1, x_2)$ holds. The distance in $B$ is given by the norm: $d_B(v, w) = \\|v - w\\|$.\n\n**2. Interpreting the Question**\n\nThe question asks for \"the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings\". This phrasing implies that the number of embeddings might vary depending on the specific choice of the space $X$ and the Banach space $B$. We are looking for the overall minimum value of this number, achievable by making the most suitable choices for $X$ and $B$, under the constraint that an embedding must exist.\n\nLet $N(X, B)$ be the number of isometric embeddings of $X$ into $B$. We want to find $\\min_{X, B} N(X, B)$, where the minimum is taken over all possible finite ultrametric spaces $X$ and Banach spaces $B$ for which $N(X, B) > 0$.\n\n**3. Strategy: Searching for the Minimum by Considering Simple Cases**\n\nTo find a minimum value, it is often effective to examine the simplest or most degenerate cases possible under the given definitions.\n\n*   **The simplest Banach space**: The simplest possible Banach space is the zero-dimensional space $B = \\{0\\}$. It consists of only the zero vector. Its norm is $\\|0\\|=0$, and it is complete. Its cardinality is $K=1$.\n\n*   **Embedding into $B=\\{0\\}$**: Let's see if we can embed a finite ultrametric space $X$ into $B=\\{0\\}$. An embedding $f: X \\to \\{0\\}$ must map every point $x \\in X$ to the vector $0$. For this to be an isometry, for any $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, we must have:\n    $d_X(x_1, x_2) = \\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = \\|0 - 0\\| = 0$.\n    This means that the distance between any two points in $X$ must be zero. In a metric space, $d(x_1, x_2) = 0$ if and only if $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $X$ can contain at most one point.\n\n*   **The simplest finite ultrametric space**: A space with a single point, say $X = \\{x_0\\}$, is the simplest non-empty finite ultrametric space. The only distance is $d(x_0, x_0) = 0$. The ultrametric inequality is trivially satisfied.\n\n**4. Finding a Concrete Minimum**\n\nLet's combine these simplest cases:\n*   Choose $X = \\{x_0\\}$, a one-point space.\n*   Choose $B = \\{0\\}$, the zero Banach space (with cardinality $K=1$).\n\nWe need to count the number of isometric embeddings of $X$ into $B$.\nA map $f: \\{x_0\\} \\to \\{0\\}$ must necessarily be $f(x_0) = 0$. There is only one such function.\nIs this function an isometric embedding? We check the condition:\n$d_B(f(x_0), f(x_0)) = \\|f(x_0) - f(x_0)\\| = \\|0 - 0\\| = 0$.\n$d_X(x_0, x_0) = 0$.\nThe condition is satisfied. Therefore, there is exactly one isometric embedding.\n\nSo, we have found a valid pair $(X, B)$ for which the number of embeddings is 1. Since the question assumes embeddings exist, the number must be a positive integer. Thus, the smallest possible number cannot be less than 1.\n\nWe have found that the minimum is 1.\n\n**5. Analysis of Non-degenerate Cases (Sanity Check)**\n\nWhat happens if we don't use these degenerate cases?\n*   Suppose $X$ must have at least two points. Then there exists a pair $x_1, x_2$ with $d(x_1, x_2) > 0$. This space cannot be embedded into $B=\\{0\\}$. So $B$ must be a non-trivial Banach space, with dimension at least 1.\n*   Any non-trivial Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ has a cardinality $K \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum), which is infinite.\n*   Let $f: X \\to B$ be an isometric embedding. For any vector $v \\in B$, the translated map $f_v(x) = f(x) + v$ is also an isometric embedding, since $\\|f_v(x_1) - f_v(x_2)\\| = \\|(f(x_1)+v) - (f(x_2)+v)\\| = \\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d_X(x_1, x_2)$.\n*   All these maps $f_v$ are distinct for distinct $v$. There are $|B|=K$ such maps. Thus, the number of embeddings is at least $K$.\n*   Furthermore, any embedding is a function from $X$ to $B$. The set of all such functions is $B^X$, which has cardinality $|B|^{|X|} = K^{|X|}$. Since $K$ is infinite and $|X|$ is finite and positive, $K^{|X|} = K$. The number of embeddings is therefore at most $K$.\n*   Combining these, for any non-empty finite metric space $X$ and any non-trivial Banach space $B$ (of infinite cardinality $K$) that allows for an embedding, the number of isometric embeddings is exactly $K$.\n\nSo, in any non-degenerate case, the number of embeddings would be $K$, an infinite cardinal. These values (like $\\mathfrak{c}, 2^\\mathfrak{c}, \\dots$) are all greater than 1. This confirms that the minimum value is indeed 1, achieved in the degenerate case. The explicit mention of \"cardinality K\" and the \"ultrametric\" property appear to be distractors from the simple solution based on trivial spaces. A slightly different degenerate case also yielding 1 is choosing $X$ to be the empty set (if allowed by convention), which has exactly one embedding (the empty function) into any Banach space $B$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering the simplest possible choices for the finite ultrametric space and the Banach space, we find a scenario where the number of isometric embeddings is 1. Since the number must be a positive integer, this is the minimum possible value.\n\nThe smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 1."
