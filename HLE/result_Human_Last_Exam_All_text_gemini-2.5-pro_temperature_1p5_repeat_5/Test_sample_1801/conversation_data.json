    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify two specific individuals based on a set of criteria:\n    *   **Who:** Two people.\n    *   **Distinction:** They must be Nobel laureates.\n    *   **Action:** They were featured in a commercial.\n    *   **Company:** The commercial was for Enron.\n    *   **Timeframe:** The commercial aired around the year 2000.\n    *   **Identifier:** The commercial's tagline was \"Ask Why.\"\n    *   **Qualifier:** The commercial is described as \"infamous,\" which alludes to the deep irony of its message and Enron's subsequent collapse due to massive fraud.\n\n2.  **Research the \"Ask Why\" Campaign:**\n    *   The \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major branding effort by Enron in 2000, developed by the advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather.\n    *   Its goal was to position Enron as an innovative, forward-thinking company that challenged conventional wisdom, not just an energy trading firm.\n    *   The campaign's tagline became tragically ironic after Enron's 2001 bankruptcy revealed that the company's success was built on systemic accounting fraud. The public retrospectively felt that they should have been \"asking why\" about Enron's too-good-to-be-true profits.\n\n3.  **Identify the Nobel Laureates:**\n    *   The campaign featured several thinkers to bolster its intellectual image. Research into the specific television and print ads from this campaign reveals the involvement of two economists who are also Nobel Prize winners.\n    *   **Individual 1:** Paul Krugman, a prominent economist and New York Times columnist.\n    *   **Individual 2:** Myron Scholes, an economist best known for the Black-Scholes model for pricing financial derivatives.\n\n4.  **Verify Nobel Prize Status (A Careful Point):**\n    *   A key detail is *when* they became Nobel laureates. The question asks which \"Nobel laureates\" were featured, which refers to their status as laureates, not necessarily their status *at the time* of the commercial.\n    *   **Myron Scholes** received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **1997**. He was already a Nobel laureate when he appeared in the 2000 commercial.\n    *   **Paul Krugman** received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **2008**. He was not yet a laureate when the commercial aired, but he is one now. He still fits the description of a \"Nobel laureate [who was] featured\" in the ad. Both individuals have publicly expressed regret over their participation.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the two Nobel laureates featured in Enron's infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" campaign were Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes. Their participation is a well-documented and frequently cited example of the campaign's unfortunate legacy.\n\n### Final Answer\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"
