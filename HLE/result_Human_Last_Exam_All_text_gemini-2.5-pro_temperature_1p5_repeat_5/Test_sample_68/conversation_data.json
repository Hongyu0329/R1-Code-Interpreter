    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements in the smallest algebraic structure that allows coloring the figure-eight knot.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding Knot Coloring and the Algebraic Structure**\n\n*   **Knot Coloring:** A knot diagram can be \"colored\" using a set of `n` colors, typically represented by integers `{0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}`.\n*   **The Coloring Rule:** At each crossing in the knot diagram, three arcs meet. One arc goes over the crossing (the over-arc) and two go under (the under-arcs). If the color of the over-arc is `y` and the colors of the two under-arcs are `x` and `z`, they must satisfy the relation:\n    `2y ≡ x + z (mod n)`\n*   **Admissible Coloring:** A coloring is considered valid or \"admissible\" if this rule holds for every crossing. A coloring is \"non-trivial\" if at least two different colors are used. A knot is said to be *n-colorable* if it has a non-trivial `n`-coloring.\n*   **The Algebraic Structure:** The set of `n` colors, together with the operation defined by the coloring rule, forms an algebraic structure known as a **quandle**. The question asks for the smallest integer `n > 1` for which the figure-eight knot is n-colorable. This `n` will be the number of elements (the size) of that smallest structure.\n\n**2. The Knot Determinant**\n\nA fundamental result in knot theory connects the colorability of a knot to an invariant called the **knot determinant**, denoted `det(K)`.\n*   **The Colorability Theorem:** A knot K is non-trivially n-colorable if and only if the greatest common divisor of `n` and the determinant of the knot is greater than 1, i.e., `gcd(n, det(K)) > 1`.\n*   Our goal is to find the determinant of the figure-eight knot and then find the smallest integer `n > 1` that satisfies this condition.\n\n**3. Finding the Determinant of the Figure-Eight Knot**\n\nTo find the determinant, we first need a diagram of the figure-eight knot and we label its arcs. Then, we write down the coloring equation for each crossing.\n\n*   **Diagram and Labeling:** Let's use a standard diagram for the figure-eight knot (knot `4₁`) with its four arcs labeled `x₁`, `x₂`, `x₃`, and `x₄`.\n    *   There are four crossings. The figure-eight knot is an alternating knot, meaning the crossings alternate between over and under as you trace the knot.\n*   **System of Equations:** Based on a standard diagram, the relationships at the four crossings are:\n    1.  `2x₁ ≡ x₂ + x₃`\n    2.  `2x₂ ≡ x₁ + x₄`\n    3.  `2x₃ ≡ x₁ + x₄`\n    4.  `2x₄ ≡ x₂ + x₃`\n\n    Rewriting these as a system of linear homogeneous equations (modulo `n`):\n    1.  `2x₁ - x₂ - x₃ + 0x₄ = 0`\n    2.  `-x₁ + 2x₂ + 0x₃ - x₄ = 0`\n    3.  `-x₁ + 0x₂ + 2x₃ - x₄ = 0`\n    4.  `0x₁ - x₂ - x₃ + 2x₄ = 0`\n\n*   **The Coloring Matrix:** This system of equations gives us a \"coloring matrix\" `M`:\n    ```\n       [ 2, -1, -1,  0]\n    M =[-1,  2,  0, -1]\n       [-1,  0,  2, -1]\n       [ 0, -1, -1,  2]\n    ```\n*   **Calculating the Determinant:** The determinant of the knot is the absolute value of the determinant of any `(k-1)x(k-1)` submatrix of the `k x k` coloring matrix (where `k=4` here). Let's remove the last row and last column to get a `3x3` submatrix `M'`:\n    ```\n        [ 2, -1, -1]\n    M' =[-1,  2,  0]\n        [-1,  0,  2]\n    ```\n    Now, we compute the determinant of `M'`:\n    `det(M') = 2 * det([[2, 0], [0, 2]]) - (-1) * det([[-1, 0], [-1, 2]]) + (-1) * det([[-1, 2], [-1, 0]])`\n    `det(M') = 2 * (2*2 - 0*0) + 1 * ((-1)*2 - 0*(-1)) - 1 * ((-1)*0 - 2*(-1))`\n    `det(M') = 2 * (4) + 1 * (-2) - 1 * (2)`\n    `det(M') = 8 - 2 - 2`\n    `det(M') = 4`\n\n    Wait, the calculation or the matrix must be wrong. Let's use the matrix derived in the scratchpad from another standard diagram's equations, which is known to be correct.\n\n    **Corrected approach:** Using a different but standard labeling of the figure-eight knot yields the following system:\n    1.  `2z = x + y`\n    2.  `2x = y + w`\n    3.  `2w = z + x`\n    4.  `2y = w + z`\n\n    The coloring matrix for this system is:\n    ```\n       [-1, -1,  2,  0]\n    M = [ 2, -1,  0, -1]\n       [-1,  0, -1,  2]\n       [ 0,  2, -1, -1]\n    ```\n    Let's find the determinant of the submatrix `M'` by removing the fourth row and fourth column:\n    ```\n        [-1, -1,  2]\n    M' = [ 2, -1,  0]\n        [-1,  0, -1]\n    ```\n    `det(M') = -1 * ((-1)*(-1) - 0*0) - (-1) * (2*(-1) - 0*(-1)) + 2 * (2*0 - (-1)*(-1))`\n    `det(M') = -1 * (1) + 1 * (-2) + 2 * (-1)`\n    `det(M') = -1 - 2 - 2 = -5`\n\n    The determinant of the knot is the absolute value: `det(K) = |-5| = 5`.\n\n**4. Finding the Smallest `n`**\n\n*   Now we apply the colorability theorem. The figure-eight knot is n-colorable if `gcd(n, det(K)) > 1`.\n*   We have `det(K) = 5`. So we need to find the smallest integer `n > 1` such that `gcd(n, 5) > 1`.\n*   The prime factors of 5 are just 5 itself. For the greatest common divisor to be greater than 1, `n` must share a factor of 5. This means `n` must be a multiple of 5.\n*   The smallest integer `n > 1` that is a multiple of 5 is `n = 5`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe smallest integer `n` that allows for a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot is 5. Therefore, the smallest algebraic structure (the set of colors `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`) that can be used to color the knot has 5 elements.\n\n<<<5>>>"
