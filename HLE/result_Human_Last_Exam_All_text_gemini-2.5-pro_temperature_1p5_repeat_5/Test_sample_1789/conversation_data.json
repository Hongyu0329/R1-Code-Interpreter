    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the size of the largest union of 20 antichains in the divisor poset on the set $S = [1, N]$, where $N = 823564528378596$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the problem\n*   **Poset:** The set is $S = \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$ with the partial order of divisibility (`|`).\n*   **Antichain:** A subset $A \\subseteq S$ is an antichain if for any two distinct elements $a, b \\in A$, neither $a|b$ nor $b|a$.\n*   **Union of k antichains:** We are looking for the maximum size of a set $U = A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup A_{20}$, where each $A_i$ is an antichain.\n\n### Step 2: Connection to chains (Dilworth's Theorem Generalization)\nA key theorem in poset theory states that a set is a union of $k$ antichains if and only if it does not contain a chain of length $k+1$.\n*   **Chain:** A subset $\\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_m\\} \\subseteq S$ is a chain if $x_1 | x_2 | \\dots | x_m$. We assume the elements are distinct.\n*   In our case, we want the largest union of 20 antichains. This is equivalent to finding the largest subset of $S$ that does not contain a chain of length $20+1=21$.\n\n### Step 3: Constructing a large set with no chain of length 21\nLet's try to construct a large subset of $S$ that has no chain of length 21.\n\nConsider a chain of length 21: $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{21}$ where $x_1 | x_2 | \\dots | x_{21}$.\nSince the elements are distinct integers, we must have $x_{i+1} \\ge 2x_i$ for all $i$.\nThis implies $x_{21} \\ge 2x_{20} \\ge 2^2x_{19} \\ge \\dots \\ge 2^{20}x_1$.\n\nLet's define a set $U = \\{n \\in S \\mid n > N/2^{20}\\}$.\nLet's check if $U$ can contain a chain of length 21.\nSuppose $x_1, \\dots, x_{21}$ is a chain within $U$.\nThen $x_1 \\in U$, so $x_1 > N/2^{20}$.\nFrom the property of chains, we must have $x_{21} \\ge 2^{20}x_1$.\nSubstituting the inequality for $x_1$:\n$x_{21} > 2^{20} \\cdot (N/2^{20}) = N$.\nThis means $x_{21} > N$, which contradicts the condition that $x_{21} \\in S = [1, N]$.\nTherefore, the set $U$ cannot contain a chain of length 21.\n\n### Step 4: Expressing the constructed set as a union of 20 antichains\nNow, we need to show that this set $U$ is indeed a union of 20 antichains.\nLet's define a series of sets:\n$A_1 = \\{n \\in S \\mid N/2 < n \\le N\\}$\n$A_2 = \\{n \\in S \\mid N/4 < n \\le N/2\\}$\n...\n$A_i = \\{n \\in S \\mid N/2^i < n \\le N/2^{i-1}\\}$ for $i=1, 2, \\dots, 20$.\n\nEach set $A_i$ is an antichain. To see this, let $a, b \\in A_i$ with $a < b$.\nIf $a|b$, then $b=k \\cdot a$ for some integer $k \\ge 2$.\nSo, $b \\ge 2a$.\nSince $a \\in A_i$, we have $a > N/2^i$.\nThis implies $b \\ge 2a > 2(N/2^i) = N/2^{i-1}$.\nThis contradicts the condition for being in $A_i$, which requires $b \\le N/2^{i-1}$.\nThus, no element in $A_i$ can divide another element in $A_i$, so each $A_i$ is an antichain.\n\nThe union of these 20 antichains is:\n$\\bigcup_{i=1}^{20} A_i = \\{n \\in S \\mid N/2^{20} < n \\le N\\}$.\nThis is exactly the set $U$ we defined earlier.\nThe size of this set is $|U| = N - \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor$. This set is a candidate for the largest possible union of 20 antichains. While there might be other sets with the same or larger size, this construction gives a very large set and is a standard approach for this type of problem. It's widely believed to be the largest possible size.\n\n### Step 5: Calculation\nWe need to calculate the size of this set.\n*   $N = 823564528378596$\n*   $k = 20$\n*   We need to calculate $2^{20}$.\n    $2^{10} = 1024$\n    $2^{20} = (2^{10})^2 = 1024^2 = 1048576$.\n*   Now, we find the number of elements to exclude: $\\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor$.\n    $\\lfloor 823564528378596 / 1048576 \\rfloor$\n    $823564528378596 / 1048576 \\approx 785429699.98$\n    So, $\\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor = 785429699$.\n*   The size of the union is $N - \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor$.\n    $823564528378596 - 785429699 = 822779098677$.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n  823564528378596\n-      785429699\n-------------------\n  822779098677\n\n<<<822779098677>>>"
