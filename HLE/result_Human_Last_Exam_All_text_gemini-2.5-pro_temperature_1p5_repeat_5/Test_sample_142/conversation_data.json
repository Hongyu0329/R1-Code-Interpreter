    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using the 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Determine the Total Number of Electrons (N)**\n\nFirst, we sum the electrons from each atom in the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$.\n*   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n*   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron each, and there are 3 H atoms, so 3 electrons total.\n*   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n*   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n\nTotal electrons (N) = 6 + (3 × 1) + 14 + 9 = 32 electrons.\n\n**2. Determine the Number of Basis Functions (Spatial Orbitals, K)**\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of basis functions for the 6-31G** basis set. This requires counting the functions for each atom. The `**` notation (or `(d,p)`) means that polarization functions are added to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms (a set of d-orbitals) and to hydrogen atoms (a set of p-orbitals). Standard computational chemistry programs typically use 6 cartesian d-functions.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The 6-31G part means the 1s orbital is described by two basis functions (a split valence). The second `*` (or `,p`) adds a set of three p-functions (px, py, pz).\n    *   Number of functions for H = 2 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = 5.\n*   **Carbon (C, a second-row atom):** The 6-31G basis provides 9 functions for the 1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals (1 for core 1s, and 4+4 for the split valence 2s/2p). The first `*` (or `,d`) adds a set of six d-functions.\n    *   Number of functions for C = 9 (s,p-type) + 6 (d-type) = 15.\n*   **Fluorine (F, a second-row atom):** The counting is the same as for Carbon.\n    *   Number of functions for F = 9 (s,p-type) + 6 (d-type) = 15.\n*   **Silicon (Si, a third-row atom):** The 6-31G basis provides 13 functions for the 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, and 3p orbitals. The first `*` adds six d-functions.\n    *   Number of functions for Si = 13 (s,p-type) + 6 (d-type) = 19.\n\nNow, we sum the functions for all atoms in $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$:\nTotal basis functions (K) = (1 × C) + (3 × H) + (1 × Si) + (1 × F)\nK = 15 + (3 × 5) + 19 + 15\nK = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = 64 spatial orbitals.\n\n**3. Define the CI Space**\n\nA \"Full CI\" calculation on a molecule of this size is computationally intractable if all electrons are included. Standard practice is to perform the CI calculation on the valence electrons, keeping the core electrons in their lowest energy orbitals (the \"frozen core\" approximation). It's highly probable that this is the intended meaning.\n\n*   **Core electrons:**\n    *   C: $1s^2$ -> 2 core electrons in 1 core orbital.\n    *   Si: $[Ne]$ core, $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6$ -> 10 core electrons in 5 core orbitals (1s, 2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz).\n    *   F: $1s^2$ -> 2 core electrons in 1 core orbital.\n    *   Total core electrons = 2 + 10 + 2 = 14.\n    *   Total core orbitals = 1 + 5 + 1 = 7.\n*   **Active Space:**\n    *   Active electrons ($N_{act}$) = Total electrons - Core electrons = 32 - 14 = 18.\n    *   Active orbitals ($K_{act}$) = Total orbitals - Core orbitals = 64 - 7 = 57.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the number of CSFs for 18 electrons in 57 orbitals.\n\n**4. Calculate the Number of CSFs**\n\nThe molecule has an even number of electrons, so its ground state is a singlet state (total spin S=0). The number of CSFs for a system of N electrons in K orbitals with total spin S is given by the Weyl-Paldus formula. An equivalent and computationally more stable form of this formula for singlet states (S=0) is:\n\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{K}{N/2}^2 - \\binom{K}{N/2-1} \\binom{K}{N/2+1}$\n\n*   Our parameters for the active space are: K = 57, N = 18.\n*   Therefore, N/2 = 9.\n*   The formula becomes: $N_{CSF} = \\binom{57}{9}^2 - \\binom{57}{8}\\binom{57}{10}$\n\n**5. Compute the Binomial Coefficients and the Final Answer**\n\n*   $\\binom{57}{8} = \\frac{57!}{8!49!} = 1,144,332,678$\n*   $\\binom{57}{9} = \\frac{57!}{9!48!} = 9,734,510,532$\n*   $\\binom{57}{10} = \\frac{57!}{10!47!} = 78,851,034,258$\n\nNow substitute these values into the formula:\n*   $\\binom{57}{9}^2 = (9,734,510,532)^2 = 94,750,715,198,160,246,224$\n*   $\\binom{57}{8} \\times \\binom{57}{10} = 1,144,332,678 \\times 78,851,034,258 = 90,241,194,525,488,438,204$\n\nFinally, calculate the difference:\n$N_{CSF} = 94,750,715,198,160,246,224 - 90,241,194,525,488,438,204$\n$N_{CSF} = 4,509,520,672,671,808,020$\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Basis Set Interpretation:** Correctly interpreting 6-31G** and knowing the number of functions (especially the 6 cartesian d-functions which is a common standard) is crucial. Using 5 spherical d-functions would change the result.\n*   **Full CI Interpretation:** Recognizing that a true all-electron Full CI is unfeasible and that \"Full CI\" likely implies a frozen-core (valence CI) calculation is the key to making the problem solvable.\n*   **CSF Formula:** Using the correct formula for the number of singlet CSFs is essential. The chosen formula, $N_{CSF} = \\binom{K}{N/2}^2 - \\binom{K}{N/2-1} \\binom{K}{N/2+1}$, is robust for computation.\n*   **Large Number Arithmetic:** The calculation involves very large numbers, requiring a calculator or software capable of handling arbitrary-precision integers to avoid overflow or rounding errors.\n\nThe number of CSFs in a valence-only full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using a 6-31G** basis set is 4,509,520,672,671,808,020.\n\n<<<4509520672671808020>>>"
