    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the problem mathematically.**\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3.\nThe condition that $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are positive for all real $x$ means that both $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing functions.\nA fixed point of the composite function $f(g(x))$ is a real number $x$ such that $f(g(x)) = x$.\nWe want to find the maximum possible number of such fixed points.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the degree of the equation for fixed points.**\nLet $h(x) = f(g(x))$. We are looking for the number of real roots of the equation $h(x) = x$, which can be rewritten as $h(x) - x = 0$.\nSince $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3 and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3, their composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\nLet $P(x) = h(x) - x$. Then $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, the equation $P(x) = 0$ can have at most 9 real roots. This means $f(g(x))$ can have at most 9 fixed points.\n\n**Step 3: Check if it is possible to achieve the maximum of 9 fixed points.**\nFor $P(x)$ to have 9 distinct real roots, we can use Rolle's Theorem. If a differentiable function has $k$ distinct real roots, its derivative must have at least $k-1$ distinct real roots.\n*   If $P(x)=0$ has 9 distinct real roots, then its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least $9-1=8$ distinct real roots.\n*   If $P'(x)=0$ has 8 distinct real roots, then its derivative $P''(x)$ must have at least $8-1=7$ distinct real roots.\n\nLet's analyze the derivatives of $P(x)$.\n$P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$.\n$P'(x) = f'(g(x)) g'(x) - 1$.\n$P''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (f'(g(x)) g'(x))$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the degree of the derivatives.**\nLet's determine the degrees of the polynomials involved.\n*   $f(x)$ is degree 3, so $f'(x)$ is degree 2 and $f''(x)$ is degree 1.\n*   $g(x)$ is degree 3, so $g'(x)$ is degree 2 and $g''(x)$ is degree 1.\n\nThe derivative $P'(x) = f'(g(x)) g'(x) - 1$:\n*   The degree of $g(x)$ is 3. The degree of $f'(y)$ is 2. So the degree of the composition $f'(g(x))$ is $3 \\times 2 = 6$.\n*   The degree of $g'(x)$ is 2.\n*   The degree of $f'(g(x)) g'(x)$ is the sum of the degrees: $6 + 2 = 8$.\n*   Thus, $P'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. A polynomial of degree 8 can have up to 8 real roots. So, it is possible for $P'(x)$ to have 8 real roots.\n\nThe second derivative $P''(x) = (f'(g(x)) g'(x))' = h''(x)$:\nUsing the product rule and chain rule:\n$h''(x) = (f'(g(x)))' g'(x) + f'(g(x)) g''(x)$\n$h''(x) = f''(g(x)) g'(x) g'(x) + f'(g(x)) g''(x)$\n$h''(x) = f''(g(x)) (g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x)) g''(x)$\nLet's find the degree of $h''(x)$:\n*   Degree of $f''(g(x))$ is $3 \\times 1 = 3$.\n*   Degree of $(g'(x))^2$ is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n*   Degree of the first term $f''(g(x)) (g'(x))^2$ is $3+4=7$.\n*   Degree of $f'(g(x))$ is 6.\n*   Degree of $g''(x)$ is 1.\n*   Degree of the second term $f'(g(x)) g''(x)$ is $6+1=7$.\n\nSince both terms have the same degree (7), we must check if their leading coefficients cancel out.\nLet $f(x) = a_3x^3 + \\dots$ and $g(x) = b_3x^3 + \\dots$.\nFrom the condition $f'>0, g'>0$, we must have $a_3 > 0$ and $b_3 > 0$.\nThe leading term of $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$ is $(6a_3(b_3x^3)) \\cdot (3b_3x^2)^2 = (6a_3b_3x^3)(9b_3^2x^4) = 54a_3b_3^3x^7$.\nThe leading term of $f'(g(x))g''(x)$ is $(3a_3(b_3x^3)^2) \\cdot (6b_3x) = (3a_3b_3^2x^6)(6b_3x) = 18a_3b_3^3x^7$.\nThe leading term of $h''(x)$ is the sum of these, which is $(54+18)a_3b_3^3x^7 = 72a_3b_3^3x^7$.\nSince $a_3>0$ and $b_3>0$, the coefficient is non-zero. So, $P''(x)=h''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the analysis.**\nA polynomial of degree 7 can have up to 7 distinct real roots.\nSo, it is theoretically possible to choose $f$ and $g$ such that:\n1.  $P''(x) = h''(x)$ has 7 distinct real roots.\n2.  By choosing the vertical shifts of the polynomials appropriately, this allows $P'(x)$ to have 8 distinct real roots (its graph would have 7 \"wiggles\", allowing it to cross the x-axis 8 times).\n3.  Similarly, this allows $P(x)$ to have 9 distinct real roots.\n\nThe conditions on the derivatives $f'>0$ and $g'>0$ are maintained throughout this analysis. The existence of such polynomials is not trivial to prove constructively, but the analysis shows there is no theoretical obstruction to reaching the maximum bound of 9. The problem asks for the maximum number, and we have established that it cannot be more than 9, and the analysis of the derivatives shows that 9 is a plausible maximum. Problems of this type in mathematics competitions often rely on this line of reasoning, where the maximum is attainable unless a structural feature of the equations provides a contradiction. No such contradiction was found.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe maximum number of fixed points is the maximum number of real roots of a polynomial of degree 9, which is 9.\n\n>>>9"
