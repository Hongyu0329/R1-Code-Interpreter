    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal chromatic number of the given graph \\( G \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Graph Definition\nThe question defines \\( G \\) as the \"sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\)\". In graph theory, the \"sum\" of two graphs \\( G_1 = (V_1, E_1) \\) and \\( G_2 = (V_2, E_2) \\), where \\( V_1 \\) and \\( V_2 \\) are disjoint, is most commonly defined as the **graph join**, denoted \\( G_1 + G_2 \\).\n\nThe join \\( G_1 + G_2 \\) is a graph with:\n*   Vertex set \\( V = V_1 \\cup V_2 \\).\n*   Edge set \\( E = E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup \\{uv \\mid u \\in V_1, v \\in V_2\\} \\). In other words, the join operation takes the disjoint union of the two graphs and adds all possible edges between their vertex sets.\n\nThe graph \\( G \\) is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\). Let's denote these cycles as \\( C_{n,1} \\), \\( C_{n,2} \\), and \\( C_{n,3} \\). We assume they are on disjoint sets of vertices. Let their vertex sets be \\( V_1, V_2, \\) and \\( V_3 \\) respectively. Each \\( |V_i| = n \\).\n\nThe sum operation is associative, so \\( G = C_{n,1} + C_{n,2} + C_{n,3} \\). The resulting graph \\( G \\) has the following structure:\n*   **Vertex Set**: \\( V = V_1 \\cup V_2 \\cup V_3 \\). The total number of vertices is \\( 3n \\).\n*   **Edge Set**: The edge set of \\( G \\) consists of:\n    1.  The original edges of the three cycles \\( C_{n,1}, C_{n,2}, C_{n,3} \\).\n    2.  All possible edges between \\( V_1 \\) and \\( V_2 \\).\n    3.  All possible edges between \\( V_1 \\) and \\( V_3 \\).\n    4.  All possible edges between \\( V_2 \\) and \\( V_3 \\).\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The interpretation of \"sum\" as \"join\" is crucial. Other interpretations, like edge union on a common vertex set, would lead to a different problem. The join is the standard interpretation in this context.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chromatic Number of a Graph Join\nThe chromatic number, \\( \\chi(H) \\), of a graph \\( H \\) is the minimum number of colors needed to color its vertices so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nLet's consider the structure of \\( G \\). Any vertex in \\( V_i \\) is connected to every vertex in \\( V_j \\) for \\( i \\neq j \\).\nLet \\( c \\) be a proper coloring of \\( G \\).\n*   Consider any vertex \\( u \\in V_1 \\) and any vertex \\( v \\in V_2 \\). Since they are adjacent, their colors must be different: \\( c(u) \\neq c(v) \\). This must hold for all pairs \\( (u,v) \\) with \\( u \\in V_1, v \\in V_2 \\). This implies that the set of colors used for vertices in \\( V_1 \\) must be completely disjoint from the set of colors used for vertices in \\( V_2 \\).\n*   The same logic applies to pairs of vertex sets \\( (V_1, V_3) \\) and \\( (V_2, V_3) \\).\n\nTherefore, the sets of colors used for \\( V_1, V_2, \\) and \\( V_3 \\) must be pairwise disjoint.\nLet \\( k_i \\) be the number of colors used to properly color the subgraph induced by \\( V_i \\). The total number of colors used for \\( G \\) will be \\( k_1 + k_2 + k_3 \\).\nTo find the chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\), we need to find the minimum possible value for this sum. This is achieved when each \\( k_i \\) is minimized.\nThe minimum number of colors to color the subgraph induced by \\( V_i \\) is its chromatic number, \\( \\chi(G[V_i]) \\).\nThe subgraph induced by \\( V_i \\) is the cycle \\( C_{n,i} \\).\nSo, \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_{n,1}) + \\chi(C_{n,2}) + \\chi(C_{n,3}) \\).\nSince all cycles are of length \\( n \\), their chromatic numbers are the same: \\( \\chi(C_{n,1}) = \\chi(C_{n,2}) = \\chi(C_{n,3}) = \\chi(C_n) \\).\nThus, we arrive at the formula:\n\\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\)\n\n**Careful Point 2:** This formula, \\( \\chi(G_1+G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\), is a standard result for the chromatic number of a graph join.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Chromatic Number of a Cycle \\( C_n \\)\nThe chromatic number of a cycle \\( C_n \\) depends on whether its length \\( n \\) is even or odd. The length of a cycle must be \\( n \\geq 3 \\).\n\n*   **Case A: \\( n \\) is even** (\\( n \\geq 4 \\)).\n    An even cycle is a bipartite graph. We can color its vertices by alternating between two colors. Therefore, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\) for even \\( n \\).\n*   **Case B: \\( n \\) is odd** (\\( n \\geq 3 \\)).\n    An odd cycle is not bipartite. Two colors are insufficient. We can color \\( n-1 \\) vertices with two alternating colors, but the \\(n\\)-th vertex will be adjacent to two vertices of different colors, requiring a third color. Therefore, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\) for odd \\( n \\).\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Remember the two distinct cases for the chromatic number of a cycle based on the parity of \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Chromatic Number of G and Find the Maximum\nNow we can calculate \\( \\chi(G) \\) for both cases of \\( n \\).\n\n*   **If \\( n \\) is even**:\n    \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\)\n*   **If \\( n \\) is odd**:\n    \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\)\n\nThe question asks for the **maximal** chromatic number of \\( G \\). This means we need to find the maximum possible value that \\( \\chi(G) \\) can take, considering all possible cycle lengths \\( n \\geq 3 \\).\nThe possible values for \\( \\chi(G) \\) are 6 (when \\( n \\) is even) and 9 (when \\( n \\) is odd). The maximum of these is 9.\n\n**Careful Point 4:** The \"maximal\" qualifier refers to the maximum value over the parameter \\(n\\). We have found that the value depends on \\(n\\)'s parity and the maximum occurs when \\(n\\) is odd.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe chromatic number of \\( G \\) is \\( 3 \\chi(C_n) \\). The maximum value for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 3, which occurs when \\( n \\) is any odd integer \\( \\ge 3 \\). Therefore, the maximal chromatic number for \\( G \\) is \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\)."
