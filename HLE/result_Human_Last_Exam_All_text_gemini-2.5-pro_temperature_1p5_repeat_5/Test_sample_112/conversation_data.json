    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the book of manners preserved alongside Sir Launfal.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the subject:** The question is about the poem \"Sir Launfal,\" a Middle English romance.\n2.  **Determine its preservation context:** To know what it was preserved \"alongside,\" we must identify the manuscript in which the poem survives. The poem \"Sir Launfal,\" written by Thomas Chestre, is found in a single manuscript.\n3.  **Identify the specific manuscript:** The manuscript containing \"Sir Launfal\" is a famous medieval collection known as **Cotton Caligula A.ii**, now held in the British Library.\n4.  **Analyze the manuscript's contents:** This manuscript is a miscellany, meaning it contains a variety of different texts bound together. It includes several famous Middle English romances like *Lybeaus Desconus* and *The Squire of Low Degree*, as well as other significant poems like *The Owl and the Nightingale*.\n5.  **Search for a \"book of manners\" in the manuscript:** We need to look at the list of works in Cotton Caligula A.ii and find one that fits the description of a \"book of manners\" or \"courtesy book.\" These are instructional texts on proper social conduct, etiquette, and morality.\n6.  **Pinpoint the relevant text:** Among the various romances and poems in Cotton Caligula A.ii, there is a work of instructional or \"conduct\" literature. This text is known as ***The Good Wife Taught Her Daughter***. This poem consists of advice from a mother to her daughter on how to behave properly, manage a household, and be a good wife, which squarely fits the definition of a \"book of manners.\" Another similar text sometimes found in the same manuscript is *How the Wise Man Taught His Son*.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Manuscript Specificity:** The key to answering the question is knowing that \"Sir Launfal\" exists in one specific, known manuscript and that this manuscript is a collection of various works.\n*   **Genre Identification:** One must correctly identify what constitutes a \"book of manners\" in a medieval context. This genre is often referred to as \"courtesy literature\" or \"conduct literature.\"\n*   **Exact Title:** Medieval works often had variable titles. *The Good Wife Taught Her Daughter* is the most common name for the text in question.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the book of manners that was preserved in the same manuscript as the romance of \"Sir Launfal.\"\n\n<<<The Good Wife Taught Her Daughter>>>"
