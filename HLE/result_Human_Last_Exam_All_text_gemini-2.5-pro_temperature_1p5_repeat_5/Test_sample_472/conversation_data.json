    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\n### Step 1: Write out the line and syllabify it.\n`et | ti | bi | be | ne | es | se | so | li | quom | si | bi | sit | ma | le`\n\n### Step 2: Identify any elisions.\nAn elision occurs when a word ending in a vowel (or -m) is followed by a word beginning with a vowel (or h-).\n*   In the phrase `bene esse`, the final `-e` of `bene` is elided (dropped) before the initial `e-` of `esse`.\n*   The line is therefore pronounced as: `et tibi benesse soli quom sibi sit male`.\n*   The syllabification after elision is: `et | ti | bi | ben | es | se | so | li | quom | si | bi | sit | ma | le` (14 syllables total).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the meter of the line.\nThis line is from the Roman playwright Plautus and is an **Iambic Senarius**. This meter consists of six iambic feet.\n*   The basic pattern is six iambs: `S L | S L | S L | S L | S L | S L`.\n*   However, Plautine meter is very flexible and allows for substitutions. An iamb (`S L`) can be replaced by other feet like a dactyl (`L S S`), anapest (`S S L`), spondee (`L L`), or tribrach (`S S S`).\n\n### Step 4: Determine the quantity (long 'L' or short 'S') of each syllable.\nWe will determine the length of each syllable based on standard Latin rules.\n\n1.  `et`: **L**. The vowel `e` is naturally short, but it is \"long by position\" because it is followed by two consonants: the `t` of `et` and the `t` of `tibi`.\n2.  `ti-` (of `tibi`): **S**. The `i` is short by nature and followed by a single consonant.\n3.  `-bi` (of `tibi`): **S**. The final `i` is short.\n4.  `be-` (of `bene`, which becomes `ben-` after elision): **S**. The `e` is naturally short.\n5.  `n'es-` (from `bene esse`): **L**. This syllable is long by position because its vowel is followed by two `s` consonants (`-ss-`).\n6.  `-se` (of `esse`): **S**. The final `e` is short.\n7.  `so-` (of `soli`): **L**. The `o` in `soli` is naturally long.\n8.  `-li` (of `soli`): **S**. The final `i` is short.\n9.  `quom`: **L**. `quom` (an older form of `cum`) is always a long syllable.\n10. `si-` (of `sibi`): **S**. The `i` is naturally short.\n11. `-bi` (of `sibi`): **S**. The final `i` is short.\n12. `sit`: **L**. The vowel `i` is short, but it becomes long by position as it is followed by two consonants: the `t` of `sit` and the `m` of `male`.\n13. `ma-` (of `male`): **S**. The `a` in the adverb `male` is short.\n14. `-le` (of `male`): **S**. The final `e` is short. The final syllable of a line is *syllaba anceps* (its length is indifferent), but it is naturally short.\n\n### Step 5: Group the syllables into feet according to the meter.\nNow we combine our sequence of quantities (`L S S S L S L S L S S L S S`) into six iambic senarius feet, allowing for substitutions.\n\n*   **Foot 1:** `et ti bi` -> **L S S**. This is a Dactyl, a valid substitution for an iamb.\n*   **Foot 2:** `ben es-` -> **S L**. This is a pure Iamb.\n*   **Foot 3:** `-se so-` -> **S L**. This is a pure Iamb.\n*   **Foot 4:** `-li quom` -> **S L**. This is a pure Iamb.\n*   **Foot 5:** `si bi sit` -> **S S L**. This is an Anapest, a valid substitution.\n*   **Foot 6:** `ma le` -> **S S**. This is a Pyrrhic, which is a valid final foot due to *syllaba anceps*.\n\n### Final Answer Assembly\nCombining the feet gives us the final scansion.\n\nL S S S L S L S L S S L S S\n<<<L S S S L S L S L S S L S S>>>"
