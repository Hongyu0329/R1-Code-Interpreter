    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Define \"Triple Crown\"\n\nThe question asks for the number of \"triple crowns winners\" in MLB baseball. This requires a clear definition and consideration of a few key points.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Batting vs. Pitching Triple Crown.** There are two types of Triple Crowns in baseball.\n    *   The **Batting Triple Crown** is awarded to a player who leads their league (American or National) in three key offensive categories: **batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI)**. This is the more famous and commonly referenced Triple Crown.\n    *   The **Pitching Triple Crown** is awarded to a pitcher who leads their league in three key pitching categories: **wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA)**.\n    *   Since the question doesn't specify, the standard interpretation refers to the Batting Triple Crown. We will calculate the answer based on that but acknowledge the existence of the pitching award.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: \"Winners\" vs. \"Wins\".** The question asks for the number of \"winners,\" which means the number of unique players who have accomplished the feat. Some players have won the Triple Crown more than once. The final count should be of the individual players, not the total number of times it has been won.\n\n### Step 2: List the Batting Triple Crown Winners by League\n\nWe will list every player who has won the Batting Triple Crown in either the National League (NL) or the American League (AL).\n\n**National League (NL) Batting Triple Crown Winners:**\n1.  **Paul Hines** (1878)\n2.  **Tip O'Neill** (1887)\n3.  **Hugh Duffy** (1894)\n4.  **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912)\n5.  **Rogers Hornsby** (1922 & 1925) - *Note: Hornsby won twice.*\n6.  **Chuck Klein** (1933)\n7.  **Joe Medwick** (1937)\n\n**American League (AL) Batting Triple Crown Winners:**\n1.  **Nap Lajoie** (1901)\n2.  **Ty Cobb** (1909)\n3.  **Jimmie Foxx** (1933)\n4.  **Lou Gehrig** (1934)\n5.  **Ted Williams** (1942 & 1947) - *Note: Williams won twice.*\n6.  **Mickey Mantle** (1956)\n7.  **Frank Robinson** (1966)\n8.  **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967)\n9.  **Miguel Cabrera** (2012)\n\n### Step 3: Count the Unique Winners\n\nNow, we count the number of individual players from the lists above, ensuring we don't count players who won multiple times (Hornsby and Williams) more than once.\n\n*   **Unique Winners in the National League:** There are **7** distinct players on the NL list.\n*   **Unique Winners in the American League:** There are **9** distinct players on the AL list.\n\nSince no player has won a batting Triple Crown in both the American and National Leagues, we can simply add the counts from each league.\n\nTotal Unique Batting Triple Crown Winners = 7 (NL) + 9 (AL) = 16\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the standard interpretation of the question referring to the Batting Triple Crown and counting the number of unique players to achieve it, there have been 16 different winners in MLB history.\n\n<<<16>>>"
