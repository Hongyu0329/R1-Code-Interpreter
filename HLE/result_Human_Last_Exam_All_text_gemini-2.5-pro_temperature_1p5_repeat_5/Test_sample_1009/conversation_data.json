    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions and Given Properties**\n*   **Topological Group (G):** A group with a topology where multiplication and inversion are continuous. We are told G is not necessarily Hausdorff.\n*   **Compact:** Every open cover of G has a finite subcover.\n*   **First-Countable:** Every point has a countable local base of neighborhoods. This means the character of the space, $\\chi(G)$, is $\\aleph_0$.\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. Let's denote this cardinal by $\\lambda$. So $|G|=\\lambda$.\n*   **Weight (w(G)):** The minimum cardinality of a base for the topology of G. We want to find the maximum possible value of $w(G)$.\n\n**2. Relate Cardinal Functions**\n\nThere are several fundamental inequalities relating the cardinal functions of a topological space.\n*   **Šapirovskii's Theorem:** For any topological space $X$, $|X| \\le d(X)^{\\chi(X)}$, where $d(X)$ is the density of $X$ (the minimum cardinality of a dense subset). This theorem holds without any separation axioms.\n*   **Weight, Density, and Character in Topological Groups:** For any topological group $G$, a base can be constructed from a dense subset and a local base at the identity. Specifically, if $D$ is a dense subset of $G$ and $\\mathcal{U}_e$ is a local base at the identity $e$, then the collection $\\{d \\cdot U \\mid d \\in D, U \\in \\mathcal{U}_e\\}$ is a base for the topology of $G$. This leads to the inequality $w(G) \\le d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G)$.\n\n**3. Determine the Density of G**\n\nLet's apply Šapirovskii's theorem to our group G:\n*   $|G| \\le d(G)^{\\chi(G)}$\n*   We are given $|G| = \\lambda = 2^{2^\\frak c}$ and $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   So, $2^{2^\\frak c} \\le d(G)^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nLet's analyze the expression $\\kappa^{\\aleph_0}$. By cardinal arithmetic, if $\\kappa$ is an infinite cardinal, $\\kappa^{\\aleph_0} = \\kappa$ if $\\kappa \\ge 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$, and $\\kappa^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$ if $\\kappa < \\frak c$.\n*   If we were to assume $d(G) < \\frak c$, the inequality would become $2^{2^\\frak c} \\le \\frak c$, which is false.\n*   If we assume $d(G) \\ge \\frak c$, the inequality becomes $2^{2^\\frak c} \\le d(G)$.\n\nSo, we must have $d(G) \\ge 2^{2^\\frak c} = \\lambda$.\nBy definition, the density of a space cannot be greater than its cardinality, so $d(G) \\le |G| = \\lambda$.\nCombining these two inequalities, we get $d(G) = |G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n**4. Determine the Upper Bound for the Weight of G**\n\nNow we use the inequality relating weight, density, and character:\n*   $w(G) \\le d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G)$\n*   Substituting the values we found: $w(G) \\le (2^{2^\\frak c}) \\cdot \\aleph_0$.\n*   Since $2^{2^\\frak c}$ is an infinite cardinal, its product with $\\aleph_0$ is simply the larger of the two, which is $2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   So, we have an upper bound for the weight: $w(G) \\le 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n**5. Consider if the Upper Bound is Attainable (Finding the Largest Possible Value)**\n\nThe question asks for the largest *possible* weight. We have found an upper bound. The answer will be this upper bound if there exists (or could exist) a group satisfying the conditions with this weight.\n\nLet's consider the structure of such a non-Hausdorff group.\n*   Let $K = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ be the closure of the identity element. $K$ is a closed normal subgroup of $G$.\n*   The quotient group $G/K$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n*   A key theorem (of Birkhoff and Kakutani) states that a compact Hausdorff group is first-countable if and only if it is metrizable. A compact metrizable space is second-countable ($w(G/K) = \\aleph_0$) and has cardinality at most $\\frak c$.\n*   The kernel $K$ inherits compactness and first-countability from $G$. A crucial point is that the subspace topology on $K$ is the indiscrete (or trivial) topology.\n*   The cardinality relation is $|G| = |K| \\cdot |G/K|$. Since $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$ and $|G/K| \\le \\frak c$, we must have $|K|=|G|=2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\nWe can construct an example of a group $G$ satisfying the given properties. Let $K_0$ be an abstract group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$, and give it the indiscrete topology. This makes $K_0$ a compact, first-countable topological group. Let $H$ be a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group (e.g., the circle group $S^1$ or the Cantor group $\\{0,1\\}^{\\aleph_0}$). Let $G = K_0 \\times H$ with the product topology. This group $G$ is compact, first-countable, and has cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$. Its weight is $w(G) = \\max(w(K_0), w(H)) = \\max(1, \\aleph_0) = \\aleph_0$.\nThis example shows that the weight can be as small as $\\aleph_0$.\n\nHowever, the question is about the *largest possible* weight. The analysis in steps 3 and 4 shows that the weight cannot exceed the group's cardinality, $2^{2^\\frak c}$. While the simple product construction yields a small weight, more complex (non-trivial extension) group topologies could potentially have a much larger weight. Without any further information or theorems that would constrain the weight to be smaller, the maximum possible value is the upper bound we derived. There is no theorem that forbids a group with these properties from having a weight equal to its cardinality.\n\n*(Note: One might encounter Arhangel'skii's theorem that $|X| \\le 2^{l(X)\\chi(X)}$ for regular spaces $X$. This would imply $|G| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = \\frak c$, contradicting the problem statement. This implies either the problem is ill-posed or, more likely, the theorem has hidden assumptions (like $T_1$ separation) that make it inapplicable to non-Hausdorff groups, even if they are regular.)*\n\nAssuming the problem is well-posed, we must discard this contradictory result. The firmest conclusion is the upper bound derived from general principles.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis gives a definitive value for the density, $d(G) = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, and a firm upper bound for the weight, $w(G) \\le 2^{2^\\frak c}$. As no stronger constraint seems to apply in this non-Hausdorff setting, the largest possible value for the weight is this upper bound.\n\nFinal answer: The largest possible weight of the group is $2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n<<<2^{2^\\frak c}>>>"
