    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Motif:** The central question is about identifying a peptide that binds to an integrin receptor. All five answer choices share a common sequence: **RGD**. This stands for the amino acids Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid. The RGD motif is a well-established, minimal amino acid sequence found in many extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (like fibronectin, vitronectin, laminin) that is recognized and bound by a family of cell-surface receptors called integrins.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Importance of Flanking Residues:** While the RGD sequence is the primary recognition site, it is not sufficient for high-affinity and specific binding on its own. The amino acids immediately surrounding (flanking) the RGD motif are critically important. They contribute to the three-dimensional structure of the peptide, particularly by forming a specific type of turn (often a β-turn), which presents the Arginine and Aspartic acid side chains at the optimal distance and orientation to fit into the integrin's binding pocket. Different integrins show preferences for different flanking residues, which dictates binding specificity.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Peptide Option:** We need to assess which of the given peptides has a sequence that is known from biological studies to adopt the correct conformation for integrin binding. The most reliable candidates are sequences that are identical or very similar to those found in natural ECM proteins known to be ligands for integrins.\n\n    *   **A. RGDMAA:** Methionine (M) and Alanine (A) are nonpolar. This is not a well-known canonical sequence from a major ECM protein.\n    *   **B. RGDSPSS:** This sequence contains the motif **RGDSP**. This is the classic RGD sequence from **fibronectin**, one of the most studied ECM proteins. The sequence in human fibronectin is ...TGRGDSPASS... The peptide in the answer choice is extremely similar. The Proline (P) immediately following the Aspartate (D) is particularly significant. Proline's rigid ring structure frequently induces a β-turn in the peptide backbone. This turn is known to be essential for presenting the RGD sequence in the correct conformation for high-affinity binding to the α5β1 integrin. Due to its origin and the presence of the turn-inducing proline, this peptide is an exceptionally strong candidate.\n    *   **C. RGDLTTP:** Leucine (L) is a bulky hydrophobic residue. This is not a well-known canonical sequence from a major ECM protein.\n    *   **D. RGDQVSK:** This sequence is not a canonical RGD site from a major ECM protein like fibronectin or vitronectin (vitronectin's site is RGDV). While synthetic peptides with various flanking sequences can be made to bind integrins, this is not a classic, naturally-derived sequence.\n    *   **E. RGDARGG:** Alanine (A) and Arginine (R) follow the RGD. This is also not a canonical sequence from a major ECM protein.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the peptide **RGDSPSS** is derived from the RGD-containing region of fibronectin. The RGDSP sequence is a classic, extensively studied motif known to bind effectively to integrins, particularly α5β1. The presence of Proline at the D+1 position is a strong structural indicator of a high-affinity binder. Therefore, this peptide is the one that has been found to bind and is highly likely to bind an integrin receptor in an in vitro assay.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Central Motif:** Recognize the RGD motif as the key starting point.\n*   **Flanking Sequence is Key:** Understand that the context (surrounding amino acids) is as important as the motif itself for affinity and specificity.\n*   **Natural Ligands are Best:** Peptides derived from known natural integrin ligands (like fibronectin) are the most reliable candidates.\n*   **Structural Significance:** Note the role of specific residues like Proline in establishing the correct 3D conformation (β-turn) required for binding.\n\n<<<B>>>"
