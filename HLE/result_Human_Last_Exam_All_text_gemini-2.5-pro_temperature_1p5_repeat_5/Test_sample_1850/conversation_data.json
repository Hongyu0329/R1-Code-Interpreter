    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define \"Historical Saint\"**:\n    The term \"historical saint\" typically refers to a figure, recognized for their holiness by a major Christian tradition (like the Catholic or Orthodox Church), who lived after the biblical era. This distinguishes them from foundational biblical figures like Abraham, Moses, or even the Apostles, although those figures are also considered saints. Milton, being a 17th-century Puritan, was highly critical of the Catholic Church and its veneration of saints, so any mention of such figures is likely to be critical.\n\n2.  **Initial Search Strategy**:\n    The most logical places in *Paradise Lost* to find named historical figures are the sections where future history is recounted. These are primarily:\n    *   **Book III**: God the Father foresees the future, and there is a description of the \"Limbo of Vanity\" where Milton satirizes Catholic practices.\n    *   **Books XI and XII**: The Archangel Michael shows and narrates the future of mankind to Adam.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Books XI and XII**:\n    In these concluding books, Michael recounts biblical history. Several major biblical figures, who are also considered saints, are mentioned by name:\n    *   **Enoch** (Book XI)\n    *   **Noah** (Book XI)\n    *   **Abraham** (Book XII)\n    *   **Moses** (Book XII)\n    *   **Joshua** (Book XII)\n    *   **David** (Book XII)\n    While these individuals are saints, they are biblical patriarchs and prophets rather than \"historical saints\" in the common, post-biblical sense. No post-biblical saints (like Augustine or Aquinas) are mentioned by name in this section.\n\n4.  **Analyzing Book III - The Limbo of Vanity**:\n    This section (Book III, lines 444-497) is a satirical depiction of a place where futile and vain things end up. Milton uses it to critique the Roman Catholic Church. Within this passage, he makes direct reference to specific historical saints and the monastic orders they founded.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Names**:\n    The key lines are found in Book III, lines 478-480:\n\n    > \"And they who to be sure of Paradise\n    > Dying put on the weeds of **Dominic**,\n    > Or in **Franciscan** think to pass disguised...\"\n\n    Here, Milton explicitly mentions two major historical saints by name (or by the name of their order, which serves as a direct reference to the founder):\n\n    *   **1. Saint Dominic**: Founder of the Dominican Order (the \"Black Friars\"). Milton mentions him by name.\n    *   **2. Saint Francis of Assisi**: Founder of the Franciscan Order. The adjective \"Franciscan\" is a direct and unmistakable reference to him by name.\n\n6.  **Review and Final Count**:\n    A thorough review of the text confirms that no other post-biblical, historical saints are mentioned by name. Figures like Peter, Paul, and Mary are alluded to but not explicitly named. The mentions of Dominic and Francis are unique in that they are named post-biblical saints. Although they are mentioned in a deeply satirical and critical context, the question asks how many are \"mentioned by name,\" not how many are praised.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Definition is Key**: The answer depends entirely on interpreting \"historical saints\" as post-biblical figures, which is the standard interpretation that distinguishes them from biblical patriarchs and prophets.\n*   **Context of Mention**: The mention is derogatory, which is consistent with Milton's Puritan theology and his rejection of the Catholic cult of saints.\n*   **Naming Convention**: The use of the adjective \"Franciscan\" is a clear reference that functions as a naming of St. Francis in this context.\n*   **Exclusion of Biblical Figures**: If the question were interpreted to include biblical figures, the number would be significantly higher (adding Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Joshua, and David). However, the specific, critical naming of the two medieval saints suggests the question is aimed at the post-biblical category.\n\nBased on this analysis, exactly two historical (post-biblical) saints are mentioned by name in *Paradise Lost*.\n\n<<<2>>>"
