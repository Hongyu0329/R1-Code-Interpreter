    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum number of colors needed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Terminology**\n    *   **Graph G**: A set of vertices (or nodes) and edges (or links) connecting pairs of vertices.\n    *   **Number of vertices**: The graph has $n = 12345$ vertices.\n    *   **Proper vertex coloring**: An assignment of a color to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n    *   **Chromatic Number, $\\chi(G)$**: The minimum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring of G.\n    *   **Complete Graph, $K_n$**: A graph with $n$ vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. For $K_n$, every vertex must have a unique color, so $\\chi(K_n) = n$.\n    *   **The Question**: The question asks for the maximum possible value of $\\chi(G)$ for any graph $G$ that has 12345 vertices but is *not* a complete graph.\n\n2.  **Establishing an Upper Bound**\n    *   For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is at most $n$.\n    *   The only graph that requires exactly $n$ colors is the complete graph $K_n$, because every vertex must be distinct in color from all other $n-1$ vertices.\n    *   The problem states that our graph $G$ is **not** a complete graph.\n    *   Since $G$ is not a complete graph, there must exist at least one pair of vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, that are not connected by an edge.\n    *   Because $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same color in a proper coloring.\n    *   We can devise a coloring strategy that uses at most $n-1$ colors:\n        1.  Assign Color 1 to both vertex $u$ and vertex $v$. This is valid since they are not adjacent.\n        2.  For the remaining $n-2$ vertices, assign each a unique color from Color 2, Color 3, ..., up to Color $n-1$. This is a valid assignment for these vertices amongst themselves.\n        3.  This coloring is proper for the entire graph. Any two vertices from the set of $n-2$ have different colors. Any of these vertices has a color different from Color 1, which is assigned to $u$ and $v$. Finally, $u$ and $v$ have the same color, which is allowed.\n    *   This constructive proof shows that any graph with $n$ vertices that is not complete can be colored with at most $n-1$ colors.\n    *   In our case, $n=12345$. Therefore, for our graph $G$, we must have $\\chi(G) \\le 12345 - 1 = 12344$. This means the maximum number of colors needed cannot be more than 12344.\n\n3.  **Verifying if the Upper Bound is Achievable**\n    *   Now, we need to check if there actually exists a graph $G$ (with 12345 vertices, not complete) that requires exactly 12344 colors. If we can find such a graph, it will prove that 12344 is the maximum possible value.\n    *   Consider the following construction: Let's create a graph $G$ by taking a complete graph on 12344 vertices, $K_{12344}$, and adding one more vertex, $w$, which is not connected to any of the other vertices (an isolated vertex).\n    *   Let's check if this graph $G$ meets the conditions:\n        a. **Number of vertices**: The graph has $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices.\n        b. **Not a complete graph**: The graph is not complete because the vertex $w$ is not connected to any other vertex.\n    *   Now let's find the chromatic number of this graph $G$:\n        *   The graph $G$ consists of two disconnected components: the $K_{12344}$ and the single vertex $w$.\n        *   The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components.\n        *   The $K_{12344}$ component requires 12344 colors.\n        *   The isolated vertex component requires 1 color.\n        *   Therefore, $\\chi(G) = \\max(\\chi(K_{12344}), \\chi(\\{w\\})) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n    *   Since we have successfully constructed a graph with 12345 vertices that is not complete and requires exactly 12344 colors, the maximum number of required colors is indeed 12344.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The exact wording**: \"the maximum number of colours that we need\" means we are looking for the highest possible chromatic number among all graphs that fit the description. It's not asking for a formula in terms of $\\Delta(G)$, but a specific number.\n*   **The \"not complete\" condition is crucial**: If the graph could be complete, the answer would be 12345. This condition reduces the maximum possible number of colors by exactly one.\n*   **Constructing an example**: To prove that a value is the maximum, you must not only show that no graph needs more colors (the upper bound) but also that at least one graph needs that many colors (achievability).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of any graph with $n$ vertices is $n$, which is achieved only by the complete graph $K_n$. For any graph $G$ that is not complete, there is at least one missing edge, which allows at least two vertices to share a color. This reduces the upper bound on the number of required colors to $n-1$. This bound of $n-1$ is achievable, for instance, by the graph formed by a clique of size $n-1$ and one isolated vertex.\n\nFor $n=12345$, the maximum number of colors is $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
