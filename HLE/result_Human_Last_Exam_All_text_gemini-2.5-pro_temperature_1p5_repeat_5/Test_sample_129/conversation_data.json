    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of true boolean expressions of length 5.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\n*   **Goal:** Find the number of distinct boolean expressions that evaluate to `True`.\n*   **Length:** Expressions must use exactly 5 symbols.\n*   **Symbols:** `T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`. Repetition is allowed.\n*   **Operands:** `T` (True), `F` (False).\n*   **Operators:** `!` (NOT, unary prefix), `&` (AND, binary infix), `|` (OR, binary infix).\n*   **Precedence:** `!` has the highest precedence, followed by `&`, then `|`.\n*   **Distinct Expressions:** We count the number of unique strings, e.g., `(T)|F` is different from `T|(F)`.\n\n**2. Identify All Valid Syntactic Structures of Length 5**\n\nWe must find all possible ways to combine the 7 symbols into a grammatically correct boolean expression of exactly 5 characters. Let `A`, `B`, `C` represent a literal (`T` or `F`), and `op` represent a binary operator (`&` or `|`).\n\nHere are all the mutually exclusive structures:\n\n*   **Structure 1: `A op1 B op2 C`** (e.g., `T | F & T`)\n    *   Length: 1 (A) + 1 (op1) + 1 (B) + 1 (op2) + 1 (C) = 5.\n*   **Structure 2: `( A op B )`** (e.g., `(T | F)`)\n    *   Length: 1 `(` + 1 (A) + 1 (op) + 1 (B) + 1 `)` = 5.\n*   **Structure 3: `( A ) op B`** (e.g., `(T) | F`)\n    *   Length: 1 `(` + 1 (A) + 1 `)` + 1 (op) + 1 (B) = 5.\n*   **Structure 4: `A op ( B )`** (e.g., `T | (F)`)\n    *   Length: 1 (A) + 1 (op) + 1 `(` + 1 (B) + 1 `)` = 5.\n*   **Structure 5: `! A op ! B`** (e.g., `!T | !F`)\n    *   Length: 1 `!` + 1 (A) + 1 (op) + 1 `!` + 1 (B) = 5.\n*   **Structure 6: `! ! A op B`** (e.g., `!!T | F`)\n    *   Length: 1 `!` + 1 `!` + 1 (A) + 1 (op) + 1 (B) = 5.\n*   **Structure 7: `A op ! ! B`** (e.g., `T | !!F`)\n    *   Length: 1 (A) + 1 (op) + 1 `!` + 1 `!` + 1 (B) = 5.\n*   **Structure 8: `! ( ! A )`** (e.g., `!(!T)`)\n    *   Length: 1 `!` + 1 `(` + 1 `!` + 1 (A) + 1 `)` = 5.\n*   **Structure 9: `! ! ( A )`** (e.g., `!!(T)`)\n    *   Length: 1 `!` + 1 `!` + 1 `(` + 1 (A) + 1 `)` = 5.\n*   **Structure 10: `( ! ! A )`** (e.g., `(!!T)`)\n    *   Length: 1 `(` + 1 `!` + 1 `!` + 1 (A) + 1 `)` = 5.\n*   **Structure 11: `( ( A ) )`** (e.g., `((T))`)\n    *   Length: 1 `(` + 1 `(` + 1 (A) + 1 `)` + 1 `)` = 5.\n\nAny other combination of 5 symbols is either syntactically invalid (e.g., `T ( F ) |`) or has a different length (e.g., `!(T|F)` has length 6).\n\n**3. Count True Expressions for Each Structure**\n\nNow we count how many combinations of literals (`T`/`F`) and operators (`&`/`|`) result in `True` for each structure.\n\n1.  **`A op1 B op2 C`**: (18 expressions)\n    *   `A | B & C` (parses as `A | (B & C)`): True if `A=T` (4 combos for B,C) or `A=F, B=T, C=T` (1 combo). Total: **5**.\n    *   `A & B | C` (parses as `(A & B) | C`): True if `C=T` (4 combos for A,B) or `C=F, A=T, B=T` (1 combo). Total: **5**.\n    *   `A | B | C`: True if at least one is `T`. Only `F|F|F` is false. 8 - 1 = **7**.\n    *   `A & B & C`: True only if all are `T`. `T&T&T`. Total: **1**.\n    *   Subtotal: 5 + 5 + 7 + 1 = 18.\n\n2.  **`( A op B )`**: (4 expressions)\n    *   `(A | B)`: True for `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`. Total: **3**.\n    *   `(A & B)`: True for `(T&T)`. Total: **1**.\n    *   Subtotal: 3 + 1 = 4.\n\n3.  **`( A ) op B`**: (4 expressions)\n    *   Logically equivalent to `A op B`.\n    *   `|`: 3 true. `&`: 1 true.\n    *   Subtotal: **4**.\n\n4.  **`A op ( B )`**: (4 expressions)\n    *   Symmetrical to structure 3.\n    *   Subtotal: **4**.\n\n5.  **`! A op ! B`**: (4 expressions)\n    *   `!A | !B` (`NAND`): True if not both A and B are true. 3 combos (`!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`). Total: **3**.\n    *   `!A & !B` (`NOR`): True if both A and B are false. 1 combo (`!F&!F`). Total: **1**.\n    *   Subtotal: 3 + 1 = 4.\n\n6.  **`! ! A op B`**: (4 expressions)\n    *   `!!A` is equivalent to `A`. The expression behaves like `A op B`.\n    *   `|`: 3 true. `&`: 1 true.\n    *   Subtotal: **4**.\n\n7.  **`A op ! ! B`**: (4 expressions)\n    *   Symmetrical to structure 6.\n    *   Subtotal: **4**.\n\n8.  **`! ( ! A )`**: (1 expression)\n    *   Evaluates to `A`. Is true only when `A=T`. `!(!T)`.\n    *   Subtotal: **1**.\n\n9.  **`! ! ( A )`**: (1 expression)\n    *   Evaluates to `A`. Is true only when `A=T`. `!!(T)`.\n    *   Subtotal: **1**.\n\n10. **`( ! ! A )`**: (1 expression)\n    *   Evaluates to `A`. Is true only when `A=T`. `(!!T)`.\n    *   Subtotal: **1**.\n\n11. **`( ( A ) )`**: (1 expression)\n    *   Evaluates to `A`. Is true only when `A=T`. `((T))`.\n    *   Subtotal: **1**.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nSum the counts from all the distinct structures:\nTotal = 18 (S1) + 4 (S2) + 4 (S3) + 4 (S4) + 4 (S5) + 4 (S6) + 4 (S7) + 1 (S8) + 1 (S9) + 1 (S10) + 1 (S11)\nTotal = 18 + 6 * 4 + 4 * 1\nTotal = 18 + 24 + 4\nTotal = 46"
