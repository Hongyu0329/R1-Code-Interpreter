    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Candidates**\nThe question asks about noble gases. The noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. For the purpose of natural abundance on Earth, we consider:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n(Oganesson is a synthetic element and does not exist naturally, so it is not a candidate).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Scope of the Question**\nThe question specifies \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" This means we must consider not just the atmosphere, but also the Earth's crust, oceans, and mantle. The question also specifies the year \"2002,\" but the relative abundances of these gases do not change on such short timescales, so the answer for 2002 is the same as it would be for today.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Abundance of Each Noble Gas**\nThe primary reservoir for most noble gases on Earth is the atmosphere. Let's compare their atmospheric concentrations (by volume):\n*   **Argon (Ar):** ~0.934% (or 9,340 parts per million, ppm). It is the most abundant noble gas.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** ~18.18 ppm.\n*   **Helium (He):** ~5.24 ppm. (Though abundant in the universe, it's light and escapes Earth's gravity).\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** ~1.14 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** ~0.087 ppm (or 87 parts per billion, ppb).\n\nBased on atmospheric concentration alone, Xenon is the rarest of the *stable* noble gases. However, we must also consider Radon.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the Unique Nature of Radon (Rn)**\n*   **Radioactivity:** Radon is different from the other noble gases because all its isotopes are highly radioactive.\n*   **Short Half-Life:** Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only about 3.8 days.\n*   **Source:** Radon is not a primordial gas that was trapped when Earth formed. Instead, it is continuously generated from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium found in the Earth's crust.\n*   **Transient Existence:** Because it decays so quickly, Radon cannot accumulate in the atmosphere or anywhere else. Its total amount on the entire planet at any single moment is incredibly small. It exists in a state of equilibrium, where its rate of creation is balanced by its rate of decay.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Rarest Candidates (Xenon vs. Radon)**\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** Xenon is very rare, but it is stable. Over geological time, it has accumulated in the atmosphere. The total mass of xenon in Earth's atmosphere is estimated to be about 2 trillion kilograms.\n*   **Radon (Rn):** Due to its extremely short half-life, the total amount of Radon in the entire atmosphere at any given moment is estimated to be only about 21 kilograms. Even including the radon in soil and water, the total amount on the planet is minuscule compared to xenon.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nWhile Xenon is the rarest stable noble gas, Radon is orders of magnitude rarer. Its radioactivity and rapid decay prevent it from ever accumulating. Therefore, when considering the total amount present in all terrestrial matter at any given time, Radon is the clear answer.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
