    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**1. Identify Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a substituted cyclohexane, a secondary alkyl halide. The stereochemistry is *trans*, meaning the bromine and methyl groups are on opposite faces of the ring.\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Potassium tert-butoxide ($KO^tBu$) in tert-butyl alcohol ($tBuOH$). Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. The solvent is its conjugate acid.\n\n**2. Determine the Reaction Type**\n*   The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction.\n*   Substitution reactions (SN1/SN2) are disfavored. SN2 is hindered by the bulky base, and E2 outcompetes SN1 when a strong base is used.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemical Requirements for E2 on a Cyclohexane Ring**\n*   The E2 mechanism is stereospecific. It requires the leaving group (–Br) and a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (a β-hydrogen) to be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation.\n*   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means that both the leaving group and the β-hydrogen must be in **axial** positions (one pointing up, the other pointing down).\n\n**4. Draw the Chair Conformers of the Substrate**\n*   The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, which has a *trans* relationship between the Br and Me groups. We need to draw the two possible chair conformers and determine which is more stable.\n\n    *   **Conformer A:** Bromine is **axial** and the methyl group is **equatorial**. (ax, eq)\n    *   **Conformer B:** Bromine is **equatorial** and the methyl group is **axial**. (eq, ax)\n\n*   **Stability:** Substituents are generally more stable in the equatorial position to minimize 1,3-diaxial strain. The steric strain of an axial methyl group (~1.7 kcal/mol) is much larger than that of an axial bromine atom (~0.4-0.6 kcal/mol). Therefore, **Conformer A (Br-axial, Me-equatorial) is the more stable and more populated conformer.**\n\n**5. Identify the Reactive Conformer and Possible Products**\n*   The E2 reaction can only occur from a conformer where the leaving group (Br) is **axial**.\n*   **Conformer A** has an axial bromine, so it is the **reactive conformer**.\n*   **Conformer B** has an equatorial bromine, so it cannot undergo E2 elimination directly. The molecule must be in Conformer A for the reaction to proceed.\n\n*   Now we look for available axial β-hydrogens in Conformer A:\n    1.  **On Carbon 2:** This carbon has the equatorial methyl group. Its other substituent is a hydrogen, which is in the **axial** position. Elimination of this H and the axial Br would form a double bond between C1 and C2. This product is **1-methylcyclohexene** (the Zaitsev product, more substituted).\n    2.  **On Carbon 6:** This carbon has two hydrogens, one equatorial and one **axial**. Elimination of the axial H on C6 and the axial Br on C1 would form a double bond between C1 and C6. After re-numbering for IUPAC rules, this product is **3-methylcyclohexene** (the Hofmann product, less substituted).\n\n**6. Predict the Major Product (Zaitsev vs. Hofmann)**\n*   The choice between the Zaitsev (more substituted) and Hofmann (less substituted) product depends on the steric bulk of the base.\n    *   Small bases (like ethoxide) favor the more thermodynamically stable Zaitsev product.\n    *   **Bulky bases (like tert-butoxide)** favor the **Hofmann product**. This is because the large base has difficulty accessing the sterically hindered β-hydrogen (the one on C2, near the methyl group). It preferentially attacks the more sterically accessible β-hydrogen (the one on C6).\n\n*   In this reaction, the base is potassium tert-butoxide, which is very bulky. Therefore, the reaction will favor the removal of the proton from C6.\n\n**7. Conclusion**\nThe reaction proceeds via an E2 mechanism from the more stable chair conformer where the bromine is axial. The bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide, preferentially abstracts the more sterically accessible axial proton on C6, leading to the formation of the less substituted alkene.\n\nThe name of the major product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
