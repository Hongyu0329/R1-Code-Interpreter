    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order its Coxeter number 10.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties of the H3 Reflection Group\n\nThe reflection group of type H3, denoted as `W(H3)`, is a finite Coxeter group. It is also known as the full icosahedral group. We need to know its fundamental properties:\n*   **Order of the group (`|W|`)**: The group H3 has 120 elements. `|H3| = 120`.\n*   **Coxeter Number (`h`)**: The Coxeter number for H3 is `h = 10`. The order of a Coxeter element is equal to the Coxeter number.\n*   **Degrees and Exponents**: The degrees of the fundamental invariants for H3 are `d_1=2, d_2=6, d_3=10`. The exponents of the group are given by `m_i = d_i - 1`. Thus, the exponents for H3 are `m_1=1, m_2=5, m_3=9`.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Conditions of the Question\n\nWe are looking for the number of elements `g` in the group H3 that satisfy two conditions:\n1.  `g` has a **regular eigenvector**. A vector is regular if it does not lie on any of the reflection hyperplanes of the group.\n2.  The eigenvalue `λ` corresponding to this regular eigenvector has **order 10**. This means `λ^10 = 1`, and `λ^k ≠ 1` for any positive integer `k < 10` that divides 10 (i.e., k=1, 2, 5). This is equivalent to `λ` being a primitive 10th root of unity.\n\n### Step 3: Apply Springer's Theorem on Regular Eigenvalues\n\nA crucial theorem by T.A. Springer provides a direct link between the properties we are interested in (regular eigenvectors and eigenvalues) and the structure of the group (exponents and Coxeter elements).\n**Springer's Theorem**: An element `g` in a finite Coxeter group `W` has a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of `e^(2πi*m/h)` if and only if:\n1.  `m` is an exponent of the group `W`.\n2.  `g` is conjugate to `c^m`, where `c` is a Coxeter element of `W`.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Relevant Exponents\n\nWe need to find which exponents `m` from the set `{1, 5, 9}` correspond to an eigenvalue of order 10. The eigenvalue is of the form `λ = e^(2πi*m/h)`. Since `h=10`, this is `λ = e^(2πi*m/10)`. The order of this complex number is `10 / gcd(m, 10)`.\n\nLet's check each exponent for H3:\n*   For `m=1`: The order is `10 / gcd(1, 10) = 10 / 1 = 10`. This matches our requirement.\n*   For `m=5`: The order is `10 / gcd(5, 10) = 10 / 5 = 2`. This does not match.\n*   For `m=9`: The order is `10 / gcd(9, 10) = 10 / 1 = 10`. This also matches our requirement.\n\nSo, the elements we are looking for are those that are conjugate to `c^1` or `c^9`.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Set of Elements\n\nThe set of all elements `g` satisfying the condition is the union of the conjugacy classes corresponding to the valid exponents found in the previous step.\nLet `S` be the set of elements we want to count.\n`S = C(c^1) ∪ C(c^9)`\nwhere `C(g)` denotes the conjugacy class of `g`.\n\nA key property of real reflection groups is that any element `w` is conjugate to its inverse `w^-1`. For a Coxeter element `c` of order `h=10`, its inverse is `c^-1 = c^(10-1) = c^9`. Therefore, `c^1` and `c^9` are conjugate to each other.\nThis means that their conjugacy classes are identical: `C(c^1) = C(c^9)`.\nSo, the set of elements is simply the single conjugacy class of any Coxeter element: `S = C(c)`.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Number of Elements\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the size of the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element `c`. The size of a conjugacy class `C(g)` is given by the orbit-stabilizer theorem: `|C(g)| = |W| / |Z(g)|`, where `Z(g)` is the centralizer of `g`.\n\n*   **Group Order**: `|H3| = 120`.\n*   **Centralizer of a Coxeter Element**: For any finite Coxeter group, the centralizer of a Coxeter element `c` is the cyclic group generated by `c` itself. That is, `Z(c) = <c>`.\n*   **Order of the Centralizer**: The order of this cyclic group `Z(c)` is the order of the element `c`, which is the Coxeter number `h`. For H3, `h=10`. So, `|Z(c)| = 10`.\n\nNow we can calculate the size of the conjugacy class:\n`|C(c)| = |H3| / |Z(c)| = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n\nThus, there are 12 such elements in the reflection group of type H3.\n\n<<<12>>>"
