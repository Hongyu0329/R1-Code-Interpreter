    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Question:** The core task is to identify the specific numerical imprints on two different medications: Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules.\n2.  **Identify Key Constraints and Exclusions:**\n    *   **Inclusion:** Must be numbers, must be imprinted on the capsule, must be for the specified brand (Teva) and dosages (10mg and 20mg).\n    *   **Exclusion:** Do not mention color, the word \"PLIVA\", or size. This is a crucial point as some Teva products may have \"PLIVA\" imprints, which must be ignored for this specific query.\n3.  **Research the 10mg Capsule:** I will consult official drug identification resources to find the imprint on Teva's fluoxetine 10mg capsule. The standard imprint for this capsule manufactured by Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (under NDC 0093-3108) includes the number **3108**. The capsule is typically imprinted with \"TEVA\" on one part and the number on the other.\n4.  **Research the 20mg Capsule:** Similarly, I will research the imprint on Teva's fluoxetine 20mg capsule. The standard imprint for this capsule manufactured by Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (under NDC 0093-3109) includes the number **3109**. The capsule is typically imprinted with \"TEVA\" on one part and the number on the other.\n5.  **Synthesize the Findings:** By comparing the information gathered in the previous steps and adhering to all constraints, the different numbers imprinted on the capsules are identified. The 10mg capsule has the number 3108, and the 20mg capsule has the number 3109.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Manufacturer Specificity:** It is essential to ensure the imprint code corresponds specifically to Teva Pharmaceuticals, as other manufacturers of generic fluoxetine will use different imprints.\n*   **Dosage Specificity:** The numbers on capsules are used to differentiate dosages. It's critical to match the correct number with the correct milligram strength (10mg vs. 20mg).\n*   **Adherence to Exclusions:** The final answer must strictly avoid any mention of colors, sizes, or the word \"PLIVA\" to meet the user's specific requirements. The focus must remain solely on the numerical identifiers.\n*   **Completeness:** The question asks for the \"different numbers\", so listing the distinct number for each dosage is the most direct and complete way to answer.\n\nBy following this analysis, the final answer is determined.\n\n<<<The number imprinted on the 10mg capsule is 3108, and the number on the 20mg capsule is 3109.>>>"
