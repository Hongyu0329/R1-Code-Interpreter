Charles needs to adjust the composition of his diet. A diet that severely limits protein, fat, and carbohydrates all at once is unsustainable, will lead to extreme fatigue and hunger, and is not a balanced approach to weight loss. He should first focus on creating a balanced meal plan with adequate protein for satiety, complex carbohydrates for energy, and healthy fats, while maintaining a moderate calorie deficit.
