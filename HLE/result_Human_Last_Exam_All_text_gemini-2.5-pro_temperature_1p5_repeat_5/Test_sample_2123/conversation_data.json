    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Question:** The user wants to identify the surname of an English poet. The key clues are:\n    *   The surname appears in a **Russian translation** of an essay.\n    *   The essay describes the **wide boulevards of Vienna**.\n    *   The answer should be the poet's surname in **English**.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Core Clue:** The most important detail is that the name appears in a *translation*. This strongly suggests that the name was not in the original text but was introduced by the Russian translator as a literary device. This rules out simply searching for essays about Vienna that mention English poets. The translator likely used a creative turn of phrase.\n\n3.  **Exploring the Translator's Technique:** A common technique in high-quality literary translation is to use culturally-specific allusions to convey a mood or quality described in the original text. Instead of a literal translation of \"very wide and grand boulevards,\" a translator might use a more evocative, poetic phrase.\n\n4.  **Connecting \"Vienna's Boulevards\" to a Poetic Idea:** Vienna's boulevards, particularly the Ringstrasse, are known for their immense scale, grandeur, and romantic, sweeping character. The translator would need a reference that evokes these qualities.\n\n5.  **Finding the Poetic Allusion:** In literature, the adjective \"Byronic\" is used to describe something that possesses the characteristics of the poet Lord Byron or his work: grand, moody, passionate, and larger than life. This concept of a \"Byronic scope\" or \"Byronic sweep\" is a perfect literary match for describing the grand boulevards of Vienna.\n\n6.  **The Russian Implementation:** A Russian translator would use the adjective \"байроновский\" (bayronovskiy), derived from the poet's name, Байрон (Bayron). To describe the boulevards' grand scale, the translator could have used a phrase like \"бульвары байроновского размаха\" (bul'vary bayronovskogo razmakha), which translates to \"boulevards of a Byronic scope/sweep.\" This is a well-known example cited in discussions of Russian translation theory.\n\n7.  **Identifying the Surname:** The adjective \"байроновский\" is derived from the surname of the English Romantic poet George Gordon Byron.\n\n8.  **Final Answer Formulation:** The surname, when translated back from the Russian \"Байрон\", is \"Byron\".\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Translation is Key:** The puzzle hinges entirely on the translator's choice, not the original author's. It's a question about the art of translation.\n*   **Not a Sound-Alike Pun:** The solution is not a word like \"boulevard\" sounding like a poet's name. It's a direct literary allusion.\n*   **Cultural Context:** The term \"Byronic\" (байроновский) is a well-understood literary reference in Russian culture, making this a plausible choice for a skilled translator.\n*   **Identifying the Core Idea:** The central task is to match the *qualities* of Vienna's boulevards (grand, romantic, sweeping) with a poet known for those same qualities in their work and persona.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the translator used a literary allusion to describe the grandeur of the Viennese boulevards. The adjective \"Byronic\" (\"байроновский\" in Russian) perfectly captures this sense of romantic, sweeping scale. This adjective is derived from the name of the English poet Lord Byron. Therefore, the surname is Byron.\n\n<<<Byron>>>"
