    "An internal adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ in a 2-category is a pair of 1-cells (morphisms) $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$, along with two 2-cells (2-morphisms) called the unit $\\eta: \\text{id}_{[m]} \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$ and the counit $\\varepsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\text{id}_{[n]}$, which satisfy certain coherence conditions (the triangle identities). In this specific context, the problem simplifies significantly.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the context**\n\n*   **The Category $\\Delta$:** The objects are finite ordinals $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$. The morphisms are order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$, meaning if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n*   **The 2-Category Structure:** $\\Delta$ is considered as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$. This means that for any two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, there is a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ (denoted $f \\Rightarrow g$) if and only if $f(x) \\le g(x)$ for all $x \\in [m]$.\n*   **The specific objects:** We are looking at an adjunction from $A=[23]$ to $B=[37]$.\n\n**Step 2: Translate the definition of an internal adjunction**\n\nAn internal adjunction from $[23]$ to $[37]$ consists of:\n1.  An order-preserving map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ (the left adjoint).\n2.  An order-preserving map $R: [37] \\to [23]$ (the right adjoint).\n3.  A unit 2-morphism $\\eta: \\text{id}_{[23]} \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$. According to the 2-category structure, this means $\\text{id}_{[23]}(i) \\le (R \\circ L)(i)$ for all $i \\in [23]$, which simplifies to $i \\le R(L(i))$.\n4.  A counit 2-morphism $\\varepsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\text{id}_{[37]}$. This means $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\text{id}_{[37]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [37]$, which simplifies to $L(R(j)) \\le j$.\n\nThe conditions $i \\le R(L(i))$ and $L(R(j)) \\le j$ (along with $L$ and $R$ being order-preserving) are precisely the definition of a Galois connection between the posets $[23]$ and $[37]$. This is equivalent to the standard definition of an adjunction between posets when viewed as categories: for all $i \\in [23]$ and $j \\in [37]$, we have $L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the adjoint maps**\n\nFor an adjunction $(L, R)$ to exist, either map uniquely determines the other. We can therefore count the number of adjunctions by counting the number of possible left adjoints $L$ or the number of possible right adjoints $R$.\n\n*   **Condition for L to be a left adjoint:** An order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ between finite ordinals is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). Since $[m]$ is a finite total order, any order-preserving map automatically preserves suprema of non-empty sets. The only additional constraint comes from preserving the supremum of the empty set. In $[m]$, $\\sup(\\emptyset) = 0$. So we require $L(\\sup(\\emptyset_{[m]})) = \\sup(L(\\emptyset_{[m]}))$. As $L(\\emptyset_{[m]}) = \\emptyset_{[n]}$, we need $L(0) = \\sup(\\emptyset_{[n]}) = 0$. So, $L$ must be an order-preserving map with $L(0)=0$.\n\n*   **Condition for R to be a right adjoint:** Dually, an order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets). This requires $R(\\inf(\\emptyset_{[n]})) = \\inf(R(\\emptyset_{[n]}))$. In $[n]$, $\\inf(\\emptyset) = n$. So we need $R(n) = \\inf(\\emptyset_{[m]}) = m$. So, $R$ must be an order-preserving map with $R(n)=m$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of such maps**\n\nWe can choose either approach. Let's count the number of valid right adjoints $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$ such that $R(37) = 23$.\n\nAn order-preserving map $R: [37] \\to [23]$ is a sequence of integers $R(0), R(1), \\dots, R(37)$ such that:\n$0 \\le R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(37) \\le 23$.\n\nWe are given the additional constraint that $R(37) = 23$. This implies we only need to count the number of sequences $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ such that:\n$0 \\le R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le 23$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem. It is equivalent to counting the number of ways to choose 37 numbers (the values for $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$) from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$ (which has $23+1=24$ elements) with replacement, where the order of selection doesn't matter (as it's fixed by the non-decreasing condition).\n\nThis is a multiset counting problem. The number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $n$ with replacement is given by the multiset coefficient formula (\"stars and bars\"):\n$\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$\n\nIn our case:\n*   $k$ is the number of values we are choosing: $|[36]|+1 = 37$.\n*   $n$ is the number of available options for each value: $|[23]|+1 = 24$.\n\nThe number of such maps is:\n$\\binom{24 + 37 - 1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\nAlternatively, using the equivalent formula $\\binom{n+k-1}{n-1}$:\n$\\binom{60}{24-1} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nSince $\\binom{60}{37} = \\frac{60!}{37!23!}$ and $\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!}$, these numbers are identical.\n\n*Verification:* Counting the left adjoints $L: [23] \\to [37]$ with $L(0)=0$ yields the same result. We need to count non-decreasing sequences $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ in $[37]$. This means choosing $k=23$ values from the set $\\{0, 1, ..., 37\\}$, which has $n=38$ elements. The count is $\\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$. The results are consistent.\n\nThe total number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$."
