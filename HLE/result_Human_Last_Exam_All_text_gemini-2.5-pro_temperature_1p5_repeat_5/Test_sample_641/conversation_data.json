    "An involution in a group G is an element `g` such that `g^2 = 1` and `g ≠ 1`. We are asked to find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997).\n\nLet `q = 997`. The group in question is PSU(4, q).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Group Structure:**\n    *   PSU(n, q) is defined as the quotient group PSU(n, q) = SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q)), where SU(n, q) is the special unitary group and Z denotes its center.\n    *   An element `h` in PSU(n, q) is an involution if `h^2 = 1` and `h ≠ 1`.\n    *   Let `π: SU(n, q) -> PSU(n, q)` be the natural projection map. An element `g` in SU(n, q) projects to an involution `π(g)` if `(π(g))^2 = 1` and `π(g) ≠ 1`.\n    *   `(π(g))^2 = π(g^2)`. So `π(g^2) = 1` implies `g^2 ∈ Z(SU(n, q))`.\n    *   `π(g) ≠ 1` implies `g ∉ Z(SU(n, q))`.\n\n2.  **Determining the Center Z(SU(4, q)):**\n    *   The center of SU(n, q) consists of scalar matrices `λI` such that `λ^n = 1` and `λ^(q+1) = 1`.\n    *   The order of the center is `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n    *   For our case, `n = 4` and `q = 997`. So `q+1 = 998`.\n    *   `d = gcd(4, 998) = gcd(2^2, 2 * 499) = 2`. (Since 499 is a prime number).\n    *   Therefore, the center `Z(SU(4, 997))` has order 2. It is `Z = {I, -I}`.\n\n3.  **Identifying Preimages of Involutions in SU(4, q):**\n    An element `g ∈ SU(4, q)` projects to an involution in PSU(4, q) if `g^2 ∈ {I, -I}` and `g ∉ {I, -I}`. This gives two types of preimages:\n    *   **Type 1:** `g^2 = I` and `g ≠ I`. These are the actual involutions in SU(4, q). Note that `g = -I` is an involution, but since it is in the center, it projects to the identity in PSU and is excluded.\n    *   **Type 2:** `g^2 = -I`. These are elements of order 4 in SU(4, q). Since `g^2 = -I`, `g` cannot be `I` or `-I`.\n\n4.  **Counting the Preimages by Conjugacy Classes:**\n    The total number of involutions in PSU(4, q) is the number of such preimages divided by the size of the center, which is 2. We can count the preimages by summing the sizes of the relevant conjugacy classes in SU(4, q).\n\n    **Careful Point:** We must determine the conjugacy classes for both types of preimages. The structure of these classes depends on whether `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)` or `q ≡ 3 (mod 4)`. Here, `q = 997 = 4 * 249 + 1`, so `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)`. This implies that `-1` is a square in the base field `F_q`, and `x^2+1` is reducible over `F_q`.\n\n    **Type 1 Preimages (`g^2 = I`):**\n    *   An involution `g` in SU(4, q) is semi-simple, with eigenvalues `+1` and `-1`. Let `k` be the multiplicity of the eigenvalue `-1`.\n    *   For `g` to be in SU(4, q), its determinant must be 1, so `(-1)^k = 1`. This means `k` must be even.\n    *   Since `g ≠ I`, `k > 0`. The possibilities for `k` are `k=2` and `k=4`.\n    *   If `k=4`, then `g = -I`. This element is in the center `Z` and does not project to an involution.\n    *   If `k=2`, the elements form a single conjugacy class in SU(4, q), let's call it `C_2`. Its size is given by the formula:\n        `|C_2| = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`.\n    *   The set `C_2` is closed under multiplication by `-I` (i.e., if `g ∈ C_2`, then `-g ∈ C_2`), so each pair `{g, -g}` in `C_2` maps to a single involution in PSU. The number of involutions from this source is `|C_2| / 2`.\n\n    **Type 2 Preimages (`g^2 = -I`):**\n    *   These elements are semi-simple with eigenvalues `i` and `-i` (where `i^2 = -1`). Since `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)`, `i ∈ F_q`. Let `k` be the multiplicity of the eigenvalue `i`. The determinant is `i^k (-i)^{4-k} = 1`, which is always true for `n=4`.\n    *   Such elements correspond to decompositions of the vector space `V = V_i ⊕ V_{-i}`. The theory of conjugacy classes in `SU` shows that for `n=4`, there are two such conjugacy classes:\n        1.  **Class `C_{i,1}`:** Corresponding to `k=1` (or `k=3`). The dimensions of the eigenspaces are 1 and 3. The size is given by:\n            `|C_{i,1}| = q^3(q-1)(q^2+1)`.\n            **Careful Point:** If `g` has eigenvalues `{i, -i, -i, -i}`, then `-g` has eigenvalues `{-i, i, i, i}`. The dimensions of the `i`-eigenspace are different (1 vs 3). So `g` and `-g` are in different conjugacy classes. Let `C_{i,3}` be the class of `-g`. Then `|C_{i,3}| = |C_{i,1}|`. The union `C_{i,1} ∪ C_{i,3}` is the set of all preimages of this type, and it is closed under negation. It provides `(|C_{i,1}| + |C_{i,3}|)/2 = |C_{i,1}|` involutions in PSU.\n        2.  **Class `C_{i,2}`:** Corresponding to `k=2`. The dimensions of the eigenspaces are 2 and 2. The size is identical to `|C_2|`:\n            `|C_{i,2}| = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`.\n            This class is closed under negation (if `g` has eigenvalues `{i, i, -i, -i}`, so does `-g`). It provides `|C_{i,2}| / 2` involutions in PSU.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    The total number of involutions `N` in PSU(4, q) is the sum of contributions from all sources.\n\n    `N = (Number from Type 1) + (Number from Type 2)`\n    `N = (|C_2|/2) + (|C_{i,1}| + |C_{i,2}|/2)`\n\n    Substituting the class size formulas:\n    `N = (1/2) * q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + q^3(q-1)(q^2+1) + (1/2) * q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`\n    `N = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + q^3(q-1)(q^2+1)`\n\n    Now, we factor out the common term `q^3(q^2+1)`:\n    `N = q^3(q^2+1) * [q(q^2-q+1) + (q-1)]`\n    `N = q^3(q^2+1) * [q^3 - q^2 + q + q - 1]`\n    `N = q^3(q^2+1)(q^3 - q^2 + 2q - 1)`\n\n    This formula gives the number of involutions for `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)`. We need to evaluate this for `q = 997`.\n\n    The number of involutions is `997^3 * (997^2 + 1) * (997^3 - 997^2 + 2*997 - 1)`.\n\n<<<997^3 * (997^2 + 1) * (997^3 - 997^2 + 2*997 - 1)>>>"
