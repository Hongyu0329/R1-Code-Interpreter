    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression.\n\n**1. Understand the building blocks: SKI Combinators and Church Numerals**\n\n*   **SKI Combinators:** These are the fundamental functions in this system. Their reduction rules are:\n    *   `I x = x` (Identity)\n    *   `K x y = x` (Constant)\n    *   `S x y z = x z (y z)` (Substitution)\n    Application is left-associative, so `A B C` means `((A B) C)`.\n\n*   **Church Numerals:** Natural numbers are represented as functions. A numeral `n` is a function that takes another function `f` and a value `x`, and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times.\n    *   `1 := λf.λx. f x` (which is equivalent to `I`)\n    *   `2 := λf.λx. f (f x)`\n    *   `n := λf.λx. f^n x`\n\n*   **Operations on Church Numerals in SKI:**\n    *   **Successor (`succ`):** `succ(n)` gives `n+1`. The combinator for `succ` is `S(S(K S)K)`.\n    *   **Exponentiation:** The application of one Church numeral to another, `e b`, represents exponentiation `b^e`. For example, `3 2` evaluates to the Church numeral for `2^3=8`.\n\n**2. Deconstruct and Parse the Expression**\n\nThe expression is:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`\n\nFollowing left-associativity, we parse this as `(A B) C`, where:\n*   `A = S(I)`\n*   `B = S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))))`\n*   `C = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n\n**3. Simplify the Sub-expressions B and C**\n\nFirst, let's identify common patterns within `B` and `C`.\n*   The term `S(S(K(S))(K))` is the standard combinator for the successor function, `succ`.\n*   The term `S(I)(I)` is the self-application combinator, `ω`. Let's see what Church numeral it represents:\n    `ω f x = S(I)(I) f x = I f (I f) x = f (f x)`. This is the Church numeral `2`.\n\nNow we can simplify `C`:\n*   `C = S(S(K(S))(K)) (S(I)(I)) = succ(ω) = succ(2)`\n*   The successor of 2 is 3. So, `C` is the Church numeral `3`.\n\nNext, we simplify `B`.\n*   `B = S(I)(S(I)(K( S(S(K(S))(K)) (I) )))`\n*   The term `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` is `succ(I)`. Since `I` is the Church numeral `1`, this evaluates to `succ(1) = 2`.\n*   So, `B = S(I)(S(I)(K(2)))`.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Full Expression Step by Step**\n\nThe expression `E` has the form `(A B) C`. Let's analyze the reduction of `A = S(I)`.\n*   `(S(I) X) Y` can be reduced as follows:\n    *   `S I X Y = I Y (X Y)` (by the rule of `S`)\n    *   `= Y (X Y)` (by the rule of `I`)\n*   So, `(S(I) X) Y` reduces to `Y (X Y)`.\n\nOur full expression `E = (A B) C` fits this pattern, where `X` is `B` and `Y` is `C`.\n*   `E = C (B C)`\n\nWe know `C = 3`. We need to calculate `B C = B(3)`.\n*   `B(3) = (S(I)(S(I)(K(2)))) (3)`\n*   This also fits the pattern `(S(I) X') Y'`, where `X' = S(I)(K(2))` and `Y' = 3`.\n*   The reduction gives `Y' (X' Y')`, which is `3 ( (S(I)(K(2))) 3 )`.\n\nNow we must evaluate the inner part: `(S(I)(K(2))) 3`.\n*   This again fits the pattern `(S(I) X'') Y''`, where `X'' = K(2)` and `Y'' = 3`.\n*   The reduction is `Y'' (X'' Y'')`, which is `3 ( (K(2)) 3 )`.\n*   By the rule of `K`, `K(2) 3 = 2`.\n*   So, `(S(I)(K(2))) 3` simplifies to `3(2)`.\n\nNow we use the rule for Church numeral exponentiation: `e b = b^e`.\n*   `3(2)` evaluates to the Church numeral for `2^3 = 8`.\n\nSubstitute this back into our expression for `B(3)`:\n*   `B(3) = 3 (8)`\n*   Again using the exponentiation rule, `3(8)` evaluates to the Church numeral for `8^3`.\n*   `8^3 = (2^3)^3 = 2^9 = 512`.\n*   So, `B C` evaluates to the Church numeral `512`.\n\nFinally, we can evaluate the full expression `E = C (B C)`.\n*   `E = 3 (512)`\n*   Using the exponentiation rule one last time, `3(512)` evaluates to the Church numeral `512^3`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe expression represents the Church integer `n = 512^3`.\n*   `n = (2^9)^3 = 2^(9 * 3) = 2^27`\n\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n*   `log_2(n) = log_2(2^27) = 27`."
