    "This question asks for the product of a chemical reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. To determine the product, we need to analyze the reactants and the most likely reaction pathway.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (more specifically, 1,3-butadiene). Its chemical formula is C₄H₆, and its structure is CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂. This molecule is a conjugated diene, meaning it has two double bonds separated by a single bond.\n    *   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. Its chemical formula is C₂Cl₂F₂, and its structure is CCl₂=CF₂. This molecule is a substituted alkene.\n\n2.  **Determine the type of reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (like butadiene) and an alkene (or a related molecule with a double/triple bond, known as a dienophile) is a classic example of a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition. The \"4\" represents the four π-electrons from the conjugated system of the diene, and the \"2\" represents the two π-electrons from the double bond of the dienophile.\n    *   This reaction is concerted, meaning it happens in a single step, and it forms a new six-membered ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze the reaction mechanism:**\n    *   For the reaction to occur, the butadiene molecule must adopt an *s-cis* conformation (where both double bonds are on the same side of the central single bond).\n    *   The reaction involves the rearrangement of six π-electrons to form two new sigma (σ) bonds and one new pi (π) bond.\n    *   The two terminal carbons (C1 and C4) of the butadiene will form new σ-bonds with the two carbons of the dienophile's double bond.\n    *   The double bond of the dienophile will be converted into a single bond.\n    *   The two double bonds of the diene will be broken, and a new double bond will form between the central carbons of the diene (C2 and C3).\n\n4.  **Construct the product structure:**\n    *   Let's number the carbons of the reactants to track their positions in the product:\n        *   Butadiene: CH₂(1)=CH(2)-CH(3)=CH₂(4)\n        *   Dienophile: C(Cl)₂(1')=C(F)₂(2')\n    *   The new σ-bonds will form between C1-C2' and C4-C1'.\n    *   A new π-bond will form between C2 and C3.\n    *   The result is a six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative).\n    *   The atoms and groups attached to the original carbons remain attached to them in the product.\n\n    The resulting ring will have the following connectivity:\n    *   A C=C double bond (from C2 and C3 of butadiene). The carbons in this double bond are each attached to one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Two -CH₂- groups (from C1 and C4 of butadiene), each adjacent to the double bond.\n    *   One carbon atom bonded to two chlorine atoms (-CCl₂- group from the dienophile).\n    *   One carbon atom bonded to two fluorine atoms (-CF₂- group from the dienophile).\n    *   The -CCl₂- group and the -CF₂- group are adjacent to each other and are attached to the -CH₂- groups.\n\n    The structure can be drawn as a cyclohexene ring where the substituents from the dienophile are on the carbons of the former C=C bond.\n    Structure:\n          H-C=C-H\n         /       \\\n       H₂C        CH₂\n         \\       /\n          CCl₂--CF₂\n\n5.  **Name the final product (IUPAC Nomenclature):**\n    *   The parent ring is **cyclohexene**.\n    *   The double bond is assigned the lowest possible numbers, C1 and C2.\n    *   The numbering of the ring carbons should then give the substituents the lowest possible locants (numbers). Let's try both numbering directions around the ring.\n        *   **Direction 1:** Numbering gives the CCl₂ group position 4 and the CF₂ group position 5. The locants are 4,4,5,5.\n        *   **Direction 2:** Numbering gives the CF₂ group position 4 and the CCl₂ group position 5. The locants are 4,4,5,5.\n    *   Since both numbering schemes yield the same set of locants (4,4,5,5), we use alphabetical order of the substituent names to decide the numbering.\n    *   The substituent names are \"dichloro\" and \"difluoro\". Alphabetically, \"dichloro\" comes before \"difluoro\".\n    *   Therefore, the CCl₂ group is assigned the lower number, which is 4. The CF₂ group is assigned number 5.\n    *   The full IUPAC name of the product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n*   **Reaction identification:** Correctly identifying the reaction as a Diels-Alder is the crucial first step.\n*   **Conformation:** Butadiene must be in the s-cis conformation, which it can easily adopt.\n*   **Regiochemistry:** Butadiene is a symmetrical diene. Therefore, regardless of which end of the diene attacks which end of the unsymmetrical dienophile, the same single product is formed (its name remains the same after applying IUPAC rules).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The starting dienophile is planar and has no stereocenters. The product formed also has no stereocenters (carbons with four different substituents). Thus, there are no stereoisomers to consider.\n*   **Bonding:** It is essential to correctly trace the formation of the new six-membered ring, ensuring the new double bond is in the correct position (between C2 and C3 of the original diene) and the substituents remain on their original carbons.\n\nFinal product:\nThe reaction yields a single product, a cyclohexene derivative with chlorine and fluorine substituents. Its systematic name is 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
