The primary reason a functional MRI coil may not show resonance when probed is that its integrated active components are not in their operational state during the bench test. Most commonly, the **unpowered preamplifier** presents a low impedance that heavily damps the coil's resonance (lowers its Q-factor), making the resonant dip too broad and shallow to detect. Alternatively, the coil's **active decoupling circuit** may default to a non-resonant state when unpowered, and it requires a control signal from the MRI scanner to become resonant. In either case, the coil is fully functional but requires power and control signals from the scanner to exhibit its resonant properties.
