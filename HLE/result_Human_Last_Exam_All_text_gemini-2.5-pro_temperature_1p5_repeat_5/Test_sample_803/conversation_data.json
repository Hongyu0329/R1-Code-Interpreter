    "This problem asks for a classification of a specific family of finite groupsâ€”nonabelian groups of order `2q^m` that are \"filled\". Let's break down the definitions and the structure of these groups to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x, y \\in S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be stated as `S \\cdot S \\cap S = \\emptyset`. An immediate consequence is that the identity element `e` cannot be in any product-free set, as `e \\cdot e = e`.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set (MIPFS):** A product-free set `S` is a MIPFS if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This implies that for any element `g \\in G \\setminus S`, the new set `S \\cup \\{g\\}` is *not* product-free. This maximality condition is crucial.\n*   **A Set that Fills G:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is said to \"fill\" `G` if `G = S \\cdot S \\cup S^{-1} \\cup \\{e\\}`. Here, `S \\cdot S = \\{s_1 s_2 \\mid s_1, s_2 \\in S\\}` and `S^{-1} = \\{s^{-1} \\mid s \\in S\\}`.\n*   **Filled Group:** A finite group `G` is \"filled\" if *every* MIPFS in `G` fills `G`. This is a very strong condition, as it must hold for all possible maximal product-free sets, not just some of them.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Structure of Groups of Order `2q^m`**\n\nLet `G` be a group of order `|G| = 2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number.\n\n*   **Sylow's Theorems:** We apply Sylow's theorems to understand the subgroup structure of `G`.\n    *   Let `n_q` be the number of Sylow `q`-subgroups (subgroups of order `q^m`). According to Sylow's third theorem, `n_q` must divide the order of the group divided by `q^m`, so `n_q` must divide 2. Also, `n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q`.\n    *   Since `q` is an odd prime, `n_q` can be `1, q+1, 2q+1, ...`.\n    *   The only number that divides 2 and is congruent to `1 \\pmod q` (for odd `q`) is `1`. Therefore, `n_q=1`.\n    *   This means there is a unique Sylow `q`-subgroup, which we'll call `Q`. A unique Sylow subgroup is always a normal subgroup. So, `Q \\trianglelefteq G`.\n*   **Semidirect Product:** Let `P` be a Sylow 2-subgroup. `|P|=2`. Since `Q` is a normal subgroup and `Q \\cap P = \\{e\\}`, `G` is a semidirect product of `Q` and `P`.\n    `G \\cong Q \\rtimes P \\cong Q \\rtimes C_2`.\n*   **Nonabelian Condition:** The problem specifies that `G` is nonabelian. A semidirect product `Q \\rtimes C_2` is nonabelian if and only if the homomorphism `\\phi: C_2 \\to Aut(Q)` that defines the product is non-trivial. Let `C_2 = \\langle x \\mid x^2=e \\rangle`. A non-trivial homomorphism means that `\\phi(x)` is a non-identity automorphism of `Q`. Since `x^2=e`, this automorphism `\\alpha = \\phi(x)` must have order dividing 2. As `\\alpha` is not the identity, its order must be exactly 2.\n    *   So, `G` is a nonabelian group of order `2q^m` if and only if it is isomorphic to a semidirect product `Q \\rtimes C_2`, where `Q` is a group of order `q^m` and `C_2` acts on `Q` via an automorphism `\\alpha` of order 2.\n\n**3. Connecting \"Filled\" Property to the Group Structure**\n\nThis is the core of the problem. A key result in this area of group theory (from work by Aram, Ghorbani, and others) provides a direct link between the \"filled\" property and the structure of these specific groups.\n\n**Theorem:** A non-abelian group of order `2k` where `k` is odd is a **filled group** if and only if it is a **generalized dihedral group**.\n\nOur groups have order `2q^m`, and since `q` is an odd prime, `q^m` is an odd integer. So this theorem applies directly.\n\n**4. What is a Generalized Dihedral Group?**\n\nA group `D` is called a generalized dihedral group over a group `H`, denoted `Dih(H)`, if it is constructed as a semidirect product `D = H \\rtimes C_2`, where the non-identity element of `C_2` acts on `H` via the **inversion map**, i.e., `h \\mapsto h^{-1}` for all `h \\in H`.\n\n**5. Applying the Final Constraint**\n\nFor the generalized dihedral construction `H \\rtimes C_2` to be a valid group, the inversion map must be an automorphism of `H`. Let's check when this is true.\nLet `\\iota: H \\to H` be the inversion map `\\iota(h) = h^{-1}`. For `\\iota` to be a homomorphism (and thus an automorphism, as it's its own inverse), it must satisfy `\\iota(ab) = \\iota(a)\\iota(b)` for all `a,b \\in H`.\n*   `\\iota(ab) = (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}`.\n*   `\\iota(a)\\iota(b) = a^{-1}b^{-1}`.\nFor these to be equal, we must have `b^{-1}a^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1}`. Left- and right-multiplying by `a` and `b`, this equality is equivalent to `ab=ba`.\nThis means the inversion map `\\iota` is an automorphism of `H` if and only if `H` is an **abelian** group.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nCombining all the steps:\n1.  A nonabelian group `G` of order `2q^m` must be a semidirect product `Q \\rtimes C_2`, where `Q` is a group of order `q^m`.\n2.  For `G` to be a \"filled\" group, it must be a generalized dihedral group.\n3.  A generalized dihedral group `Dih(Q) = Q \\rtimes C_2` can only be formed if the base group `Q` is abelian.\n\nTherefore, the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` are precisely the generalized dihedral groups built upon the **abelian** groups of order `q^m`.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Correctly Interpreting Definitions:** The definitions of MIPFS and \"filled\" are precise and must be used carefully. The condition for a filled group is that *every* MIPFS must fill it.\n2.  **Sylow's Theorems:** The conclusion that the Sylow `q`-subgroup `Q` is normal is fundamental. It guarantees the semidirect product structure.\n3.  **Nonabelian Condition:** This ensures that the action in the semidirect product is non-trivial.\n4.  **The Main Theorem:** Recognizing or knowing the theorem that links \"filled groups\" of this order to \"generalized dihedral groups\" is the critical step. Proving this theorem is beyond a typical analysis and relies on specialized literature.\n5.  **Automorphism Condition:** The crucial insight that the inversion map is an automorphism only for abelian groups is what restricts the possible base groups `Q`. This is the final filter on the classification.\n6.  **Scope of the Answer:** The question asks \"What are the... groups?\", which requires a description of the isomorphism classes, not just one example. The answer must encompass all possibilities for the abelian group `Q`. The number of such groups corresponds to the number of partitions of `m`, as that determines the number of non-isomorphic abelian groups of order `q^m`.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   **Group Class:** Nonabelian groups of order `2q^m` (`q` odd prime, `m \\in \\mathbb{N}`).\n*   **Structure:** They are of the form `Q \\rtimes C_2` where `|Q|=q^m` and `C_2` acts via a non-identity automorphism of order 2.\n*   **Filled Condition:** The group is filled if and only if it is a generalized dihedral group.\n*   **Generalized Dihedral Definition:** The action must be the inversion map `q \\mapsto q^{-1}`.\n*   **Constraint on `Q`:** The inversion map is an automorphism of `Q` if and only if `Q` is abelian.\n*   **Result:** The groups are the semidirect products `Q \\rtimes C_2` where `Q` is any abelian group of order `q^m`, and the `C_2` component acts by sending every element of `Q` to its inverse.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are the semidirect products `Q \\rtimes C_2`, where `Q` is any abelian group of order `q^m` and the non-identity element of `C_2` acts on `Q` via the inversion automorphism `g \\mapsto g^{-1}` for all `g \\in Q`. These are known as the generalized dihedral groups over `Q`.>>>"
