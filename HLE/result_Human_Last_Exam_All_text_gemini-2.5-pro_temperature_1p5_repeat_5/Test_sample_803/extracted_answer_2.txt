The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are the semidirect products `Q \rtimes C_2`, where `Q` is any abelian group of order `q^m` and the non-identity element of `C_2` acts on `Q` via the inversion automorphism `g \mapsto g^{-1}` for all `g \in Q`. These are known as the generalized dihedral groups over `Q`.
