    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Check for Irreducibility of the Polynomial**\n\nFirst, we need to determine if $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group of an irreducible polynomial of degree $n$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_n$.\n\n*   **Rational Root Theorem:** Any rational root $p/q$ must have $p$ dividing the constant term 14 and $q$ dividing the leading coefficient 1. Thus, possible rational roots are the integer divisors of 14: $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14$.\n    *   $f(1) = 1 + 8 + 14 = 23 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-1) = 1 - 8 + 14 = 7 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-2) = (-2)^4 + 8(-2) + 14 = 16 - 16 + 14 = 14 \\neq 0$\n    Since none of the integer divisors are roots, $f(x)$ has no rational roots. This means it cannot be factored into a linear factor and a cubic factor.\n\n*   **Check for Quadratic Factors:** We check if $f(x)$ can be factored into two quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients (by Gauss's Lemma):\n    $f(x) = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) = x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (b+d+ac)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd$.\n    Comparing coefficients with $x^4 + 8x + 14$:\n    1.  $x^3$ term: $a+c = 0 \\implies c = -a$.\n    2.  $x$ term: $ad+bc = ad-ab = a(d-b) = 8$.\n    3.  Constant term: $bd = 14$.\n    From (3), the possible integer pairs for $(b,d)$ are $(1, 14), (-1, -14), (2, 7), (-2, -7)$ and their reverses. From (2), $a$ must be an integer that divides 8.\n    *   If $(b,d) = (2,7)$, then $a(7-2)=5a=8$, which has no integer solution for $a$.\n    *   If $(b,d) = (1,14)$, then $a(14-1)=13a=8$, no integer solution.\n    *   The other pairs also do not yield integer solutions for $a$.\n    Thus, $f(x)$ cannot be factored into two quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group, order 8), $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4), and $C_4$ (cyclic group, order 4).\n\n**2. Compute the Discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant $\\Delta$ of a polynomial helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$. For a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$.\nFor $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\n\nThe Galois group is a subgroup of $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant $\\Delta$ is a perfect square of a rational number.\nLet's check if $\\sqrt{591872}$ is rational.\n$\\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{256 \\times 2312} = 16\\sqrt{2312} = 16\\sqrt{8 \\times 289} = 16 \\times 17\\sqrt{8} = 16 \\times 17 \\times 2\\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = 544\\sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**3. Construct and Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nThe resolvent cubic is a tool to further distinguish the Galois group. For a quartic $x^4 + px^2 + qx + r$, the resolvent cubic is $g(y) = y^3 - py^2 - 4ry + (4pr - q^2)$.\nFor $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $p=0, q=8, r=14$.\n$g(y) = y^3 - (0)y^2 - 4(14)y + (4(0)(14) - 8^2)$\n$g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\n\nNow, we check if the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be a divisor of -64. Let's test $y=8$:\n$g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   If the resolvent cubic is irreducible, the Galois group is $S_4$ or $A_4$.\n*   If the resolvent cubic is reducible, the Galois group is a subgroup of $D_4$, so it is one of $D_4$, $V_4$, or $C_4$.\n\nSince our resolvent cubic is reducible, the group must be $D_4$, $V_4$, or $C_4$. Combined with the conclusion from the discriminant step (the group is not a subgroup of $A_4$), this eliminates $V_4$. The possible Galois groups are now $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n**4. Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, we use the following criterion:\nLet $f(x)$ be an irreducible quartic whose resolvent cubic has a rational root. The Galois group is:\n*   $D_4$ if $f(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   $C_4$ if $f(x)$ is irreducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nIn our case, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We need to check if $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nA quartic like ours is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if at least one of the roots of its resolvent cubic is a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The roots of the resolvent cubic $g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$ are $y_1=8$ and the two roots of $y^2+8y+8=0$, which are $y_{2,3} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nLet's test the rational root $y_1 = 8$. Is 8 the square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$?\nWe want to see if there exist $u, v \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $(u+v\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$.\n$(u+v\\sqrt{2})^2 = u^2 + 2v^2 + 2uv\\sqrt{2}$.\nFor this to be equal to 8, we must have $u^2+2v^2 = 8$ and $2uv=0$.\n$2uv=0$ implies either $u=0$ or $v=0$.\n*   If $v=0$, then $u^2=8$, so $u=\\pm\\sqrt{8}=\\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is not rational.\n*   If $u=0$, then $2v^2=8$, so $v^2=4$, which means $v=\\pm 2$. These are rational numbers.\nSo, for $u=0$ and $v=2$, we have $(0+2\\sqrt{2})^2 = (2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$.\nThe element $2\\sqrt{2}$ is in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nSince one of the roots of the resolvent cubic (namely, 8) is a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nTherefore, the Galois group of $f(x)=x^4+8x+14$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the dihedral group $D_4$.\n\n**5. Final Answer: The Order of the Galois Group**\n\nThe Galois group is $D_4$. The order of the dihedral group $D_4$ (the group of symmetries of a square) is 8.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{8}$.\n<<<8>>>"
