    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The user is asking for a specific year when an individual named \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\".\n\n2.  **Verify the Individual's Name:** The first crucial step is to verify the full and correct name of the person in question. The individual referred to is the former President of Nigeria, whose widely known and official name is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**.\n\n3.  **Investigate the Name \"Azikiwe\":** The name \"Azikiwe\" is included in the question but is not part of Goodluck Jonathan's recognized name. \"Azikiwe\" is the surname of another highly prominent Nigerian political figure, **Nnamdi Azikiwe**, who was the first President of Nigeria.\n\n4.  **Search for Evidence:** The next step is to search for any credible public records, news reports, official statements, or biographical information that indicates Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever used the name \"Azikiwe\" or publicly identified with it.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Findings:** A thorough review of available data shows no evidence that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\". The name is not part of his birth name, he did not adopt it, and there are no recorded instances of him using it to refer to himself.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Conclusion:** The premise of the question is based on incorrect information. Goodluck Jonathan's name does not include \"Azikiwe\", and he has never publicly identified himself as such. Therefore, it is impossible to provide a year for an event that did not happen.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Accuracy of Names:** It is critical to verify the names of public figures, as the question itself may contain a factual error. In this case, the name \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" is incorrect.\n*   **Distinguishing Between Individuals:** The question implicitly links Goodluck Jonathan with Nnamdi Azikiwe. It is important to distinguish between these two separate individuals who were both presidents of Nigeria at different times.\n*   **Absence of Evidence:** The conclusion is based on the lack of any credible evidence. When an event is not documented in public records or reliable sources, it is reasonable to conclude that it did not occur as described.\n*   **Addressing the Flawed Premise:** A complete answer must address the core inaccuracy in the question's premise rather than attempting to find a non-existent answer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the event described in the question never occurred.\n\n<<<There is no public record or credible evidence of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever identifying himself as Azikiwe. The name \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his name, and the event described in the question never happened.>>>"
