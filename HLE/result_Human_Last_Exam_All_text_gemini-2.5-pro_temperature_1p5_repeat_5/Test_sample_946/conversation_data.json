    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n*   **Source:** The online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n*   **Specific Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n*   **Specific Event:** The Junior Prom.\n*   **Object in Question:** A cardboard cutout.\n*   **Identity of the Object:** A fictional singer.\n*   **Goal:** Identify the name of this fictional singer.\n\n**2. List of Careful Points**\n*   The episode is very specific, so information must come from \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" and not other episodes.\n*   The question specifies a \"fictional singer\". This is important because real-world people are sometimes mentioned in the series.\n*   The performer is a \"cardboard cutout,\" not an animated character or a live-action person.\n*   The Teen Girl Squad cartoons often have quick, throwaway jokes. It's important to identify what is actually shown at the prom, not just what is mentioned earlier as a possibility.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Answer**\n1.  **Initial Mention:** At the beginning of the episode, Cheerleader is announcing the prom. She says, \"This year's prom entertainment is the hot new indie sensation... a cardboard cutout of... Kaiser Wilhelm!\"\n2.  **Analysis of Initial Mention:** Kaiser Wilhelm was a real historical figure (the last German Emperor), not a fictional singer. This is a typical misdirection joke from the series and is not the actual performer at the prom.\n3.  **Scene at the Prom:** Later in the episode, the scene shifts to the Junior Prom itself. On the stage, there is entertainment set up.\n4.  **Identifying the Performer:** The narrator (Strong Bad) announces the act on stage. He says, \"Tonight's entertainment: a cardboard cutout of indie-pop-sensation **Indie-Troph**!!\"\n5.  **Visual Confirmation:** On the stage, we see the cardboard cutout of the musician. The name \"INDIE-TROPH\" is written on the bass drum of the drum kit next to the cutout.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The fictional singer represented by the cardboard cutout at the prom is named Indie-Troph.\n\n<<<Indie-Troph>>>"
