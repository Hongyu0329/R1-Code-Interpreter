    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nThe problem provides a system of four linear ordinary differential equations, known as the Kolmogorov-Chapman system, which describes the probabilities $P_i(t)$ of a system being in state $i$ at time $t$. We are also given that the sum of these probabilities is always 1. The goal is to find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, which represents the sum of the probabilities of being in state 0 and state 1 after a very long time (in the steady state).\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Steady-State Equations**\nIn the steady state, as $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ approach constant values, which we denote as $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. At this point, the rate of change of these probabilities is zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\nThe given system of differential equations is:\n$$\nP_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\nwith the constraint:\n$$\nP_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1\n$$\nand the parameters:\n$$\n\\lambda_{01} = 0.019, \\lambda_{10} = 0.65, \\lambda_{12} = 0.4, \\lambda_{21} = 0.392, \\lambda_{23} = 0.008, \\lambda_{31} = 0.008\n$$\n\n**Careful Point: System Consistency**\nFor a standard Kolmogorov-Chapman system, the total probability must be conserved, meaning $\\frac{d}{dt} \\sum P_i(t) = 0$. Let's check the sum of the given derivatives:\n$\\sum P_i'(t) = [- \\lambda_{01}P_0 + \\lambda_{10}P_1] + [-\\lambda_{01}P_0 - (\\lambda_{10}+\\lambda_{12})P_1 + \\lambda_{21}P_2 + \\lambda_{31}P_3] + [\\lambda_{12}P_1 - (\\lambda_{21}+\\lambda_{23})P_2] + [\\lambda_{23}P_2 - \\lambda_{31}P_3]$\nGrouping terms by $P_i$:\n$= (- \\lambda_{01} - \\lambda_{01})P_0 + (\\lambda_{10} - \\lambda_{10} - \\lambda_{12} + \\lambda_{12})P_1 + (\\lambda_{21} - \\lambda_{21} - \\lambda_{23} + \\lambda_{23})P_2 + (\\lambda_{31} - \\lambda_{31})P_3$\n$= -2\\lambda_{01}P_0$.\nSince we are given $\\sum P_i(t) = 1$, its derivative must be 0. Thus, $-2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t) = 0$. As $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019 \\neq 0$, this would imply $P_0(t)=0$ for all $t$. If we enforce this, the system leads to a contradiction ($p_0=p_1=p_2=p_3=0$, which violates $\\sum p_i = 1$).\nThis indicates a very likely typo in the problem statement. The second equation should represent the inflows and outflows for state 1 in a consistent manner. For a standard Markov process, the term for inflow from state 0 should be $+\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$. With this correction, the sum of derivatives becomes zero, and the system is consistent. We will proceed assuming this correction.\n\nThe corrected system for steady state ($p_i = P_i(+\\infty), p_i'=0$):\n1.  $0 = -0.019 p_0 + 0.65 p_1$\n2.  $0 = +0.019 p_0 - (0.65 + 0.4) p_1 + 0.392 p_2 + 0.008 p_3$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 p_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) p_2$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 p_2 - 0.008 p_3$\n5.  $p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n\nNotice that equation (2) is a linear combination of the others (it's the negative sum of equations 1, 3, and 4), so we can discard it.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the System of Linear Equations**\nLet's solve the system using equations (1), (3), (4), and (5).\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0 = 0.4 p_1 - (0.4) p_2 \\implies 0.4 p_1 = 0.4 p_2 \\implies p_1 = p_2$.\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0 = 0.008 p_2 - 0.008 p_3 \\implies 0.008 p_2 = 0.008 p_3 \\implies p_2 = p_3$.\n\nCombining these results, we get:\n$p_1 = p_2 = p_3$.\n\nNow, from equation (1):\n$0 = -0.019 p_0 + 0.65 p_1 \\implies 0.019 p_0 = 0.65 p_1 \\implies p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1$.\n\n**Step 4: Use the Normalization Condition**\nWe use the constraint that the sum of probabilities is 1 (equation 5). We substitute the relationships we found to express all probabilities in terms of $p_1$:\n$p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1) + p_1 + p_1 + p_1 = 1$\n$p_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3 \\right) = 1$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Required Sum $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$**\nWe want to find $p_0 + p_1$.\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1 \\right) + p_1 = p_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1 \\right)$.\n\nFrom the equation in Step 4, we have $p_1 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $p_0 + p_1$:\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1}{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3}$\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by 0.019:\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.019 \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1 \\right)}{0.019 \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3 \\right)} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}$\n\nNow, we perform the arithmetic:\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.65 + 0.057} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nFinally, we calculate the decimal value:\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to five decimal places gives 0.94625.\n\n<<<0.94625>>>"
