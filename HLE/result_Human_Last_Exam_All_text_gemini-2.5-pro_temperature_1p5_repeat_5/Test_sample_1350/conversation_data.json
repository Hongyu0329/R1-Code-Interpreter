    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Book:** *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n    *   **Action:** A character visited a Roman city.\n    *   **Event:** This character describes the religious practices of that city.\n    *   **Key Detail:** The description must contain a clear, recognizable reference to the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Characters and Scenes:**\n    The story is about a Germanic tribe (the Goths) preparing to fight the Romans. Therefore, a character who has been inside a Roman city and returned would have a unique perspective. We need to look for a scene where a character recounts their past experiences among the Romans, likely as a traveler, scout, or captive.\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Passage:**\n    In Chapter VI, titled \"A Guest from the Wild-wood,\" an elder from the allied tribe of the Laxings arrives at the hall of the Wolfings. This guest, named Asmund, tells the assembled people about his experiences as a thrall (slave) in a Roman town. He aims to warn them about the character and customs of the Romans they are about to face in battle.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Character's Description:**\n    During his speech, Asmund describes the Roman religion, which he finds strange and weak. He describes a key belief and a related image he was shown:\n    *   He mentions the Romans' \"God of their City.\"\n    *   He recounts the story he was told about this god: \"...he had a brother, a twin-fellow to wit, and that he slew him, and that the she-wolf of the forest was their mother.\"\n    *   He then describes a physical idol or image he saw: \"And they showed me the image of a she-wolf with two man-babes sucking her teats; and this they looked on and worshipped and told tales thereof.\"\n\n5.  **Connect the Description to the Myth:**\n    This account directly and unmistakably refers to the myth of Romulus and Remus.\n    *   \"a twin-fellow\" whom \"he slew\" refers to Romulus killing Remus.\n    *   \"the she-wolf of the forest was their mother\" refers to the Lupa, the she-wolf who suckled the abandoned twins.\n    *   The \"image of a she-wolf with two man-babes sucking her teats\" is a perfect description of the famous *Lupa Capitolina* (Capitoline Wolf) statue, a symbol of Rome.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The character who visits a Roman city and gives this description is the guest from the Laxings.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Indirect Reference:** The character does not use the names \"Romulus\" or \"Remus.\" The description is filtered through the perception of an outsider who finds the story odd, but the details are precise enough for the reader to recognize the myth.\n*   **Character's Name:** The character is introduced as \"the Guest\" from the Laxings, but his name is explicitly stated as Asmund.\n*   **Purpose of the Story:** Asmund's tale is not just a travelogue; it's a strategic warning to the Wolfings, characterizing the Romans as people who worship a fratricide raised by a wild animal, implying they are both treacherous and unnatural.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the character is Asmund the Laxing.\n\n<<<Asmund the Laxing>>>"
