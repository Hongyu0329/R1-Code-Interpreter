    "Answering this question requires a careful understanding of several concepts from general topology, specifically continuum theory. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the core concepts\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a compact, connected, Hausdorff topological space. The question explicitly states \"(not necessarily metric)\", which is a crucial detail.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is called indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua. A subcontinuum is a closed, connected subset of $X$, and \"proper\" means it is not equal to $X$ itself.\n*   **Composant:** For any point $x$ in a continuum $X$, the composant of $x$, denoted $C(x)$, is the set of all points $y \\in X$ for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $x$ and $y$. The set of all composants of a continuum forms a partition of that continuum (i.e., every point belongs to exactly one composant).\n\n### Step 2: Establishing a lower bound on the number of composants\n\nThe number of composants is directly related to whether a continuum is decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n*   A standard theorem in continuum theory states: **A continuum is decomposable if and only if it has exactly one composant.** If a continuum $X$ is decomposable, say $X = A \\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are proper subcontinua, then any two points in $X$ can be shown to lie in a single proper subcontinuum, meaning the entire space $X$ forms a single composant. Conversely, if $X$ has only one composant, it can be shown to be decomposable.\n*   The question asks about an **indecomposable** continuum. Based on the theorem above, an indecomposable continuum cannot have only one composant.\n*   Therefore, an indecomposable continuum must have **at least two** composants.\n\n### Step 3: Determining if the lower bound can be achieved\n\nNow we must determine if it's possible for an indecomposable continuum to have exactly two composants. Here, the \"not necessarily metric\" condition becomes critical.\n\n*   **Case 1: Metric Indecomposable Continua**\n    If we were restricted to metric spaces, the answer would be very different. It is a classical result, first proved by Stefan Mazurkiewicz, that any metric indecomposable continuum has **uncountably many** composants (specifically, $c$, the cardinality of the continuum). The proof relies on the Baire Category Theorem. It shows that each composant is a dense but meager (first category) subset. Since a complete metric space cannot be written as a countable union of meager sets, there must be uncountably many composants. Examples of metric indecomposable continua include the bucket-handle continuum and the pseudo-arc.\n\n*   **Case 2: Non-Metric Indecomposable Continua**\n    The proof for the metric case fails for general non-metric continua, as they are not necessarily separable, and a composant is not guaranteed to be the type of set (an $F_\\sigma$ set) to which the category argument applies. This opens the possibility of having a finite number of composants.\n\n    In fact, such continua exist. In his 1927 paper in *Fundamenta Mathematicae*, Mazurkiewicz mentioned that Bronis≈Çaw Knaster had constructed an example of a **non-metric indecomposable continuum with exactly two composants**.\n\n    Constructions for such spaces are non-trivial. A typical method involves taking two indecomposable continua, say $X_1$ and $X_2$, and \"gluing\" them together by identifying a specific composant from $X_1$ with a homeomorphic composant from $X_2$. The resulting space can be shown to be an indecomposable continuum whose only composants are the \"remaining parts\" of the original continua, leading to a total of two composants.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  An indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant. Thus, the minimum number is at least 2.\n2.  While metric indecomposable continua always have uncountably many composants, non-metric examples have been constructed that possess exactly 2 composants.\n3.  Combining these two facts, the smallest possible number of composants for an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
