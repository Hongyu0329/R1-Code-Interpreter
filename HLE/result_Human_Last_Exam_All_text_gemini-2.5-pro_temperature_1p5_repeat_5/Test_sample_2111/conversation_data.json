    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify a \"conceptual entity.\" We are given several clues to identify it:\n    *   It is discussed by the historian Fernand Braudel.\n    *   Braudel is quoting another writer, Paul Morand.\n    *   The entity is described metaphorically: it \"should be inscribed within a sphere.\"\n    *   An example of this entity is \"the symbol of a nation.\"\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Figures:**\n    *   **Fernand Braudel:** A prominent French historian of the Annales School, famous for his work on global history, large-scale systems, and the *longue dur√©e* (long term). His primary unit of analysis was often larger than a single nation-state.\n    *   **Paul Morand:** A French author and diplomat. Braudel was fond of his writing and quoted him.\n\n3.  **Locate the Specific Quote:** The core of the question lies in a specific quote. A search for the key phrases (\"Fernand Braudel,\" \"Paul Morand,\" \"inscribed within a sphere\") leads to a direct passage in Braudel's work. The quote is found in the introduction to his book, *A History of Civilizations*.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Quote in Context:** The full quote from Braudel is: \"As Paul Morand said, a **civilization** should be inscribed within a sphere, a circumference of which one could draw the line with a compass, first on a map and then in a man's mind.\"\n\n5.  **Connect the Quote to the Question:**\n    *   The quote explicitly names the \"conceptual entity.\" The entity that Paul Morand (and by extension, Braudel) argues should be inscribed within a sphere is a **civilization**.\n    *   This aligns with Braudel's overall historical project, which was to study the large, enduring structures of civilizations (like the Mediterranean world, the Islamic world, or Chinese civilization) rather than focusing narrowly on the political history of individual nations.\n    *   The clue \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation\" fits this analysis. A nation is a major component or a specific instance within the broader, more encompassing entity of a civilization. For Braudel, a nation's history is best understood when placed within the context of the larger civilization to which it belongs.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the direct quote from Fernand Braudel's *A History of Civilizations*, the conceptual entity he discusses is \"civilization.\"\n\n***\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing between Braudel and Morand:** While Morand originated the phrase, it is Braudel who uses it to define the central subject of his historical analysis. The question is about Braudel's emphasis.\n*   **Understanding the Metaphor:** \"Inscribed within a sphere\" means that the entity has defined (though not always rigid) geographical and cultural boundaries that can be conceptualized and mapped.\n*   **The Role of the \"Nation\" Clue:** It is crucial not to mistake \"nation\" for the final answer. It is provided as an *example* or a component part of the larger entity being defined. Braudel's work consistently aimed to look beyond the nation as the sole unit of historical study.\n\n***\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nThe question asks for the conceptual entity. The direct quote referenced is, \"a **civilization** should be inscribed within a sphere.\" Therefore, the entity is civilization.\n\n<<<Civilization>>>"
