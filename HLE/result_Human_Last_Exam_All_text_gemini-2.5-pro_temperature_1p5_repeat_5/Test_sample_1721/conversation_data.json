    "Answering the question: What is the largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c + o(1))N$ for which the sumset $A+A = \\{a_1+a_2 \\mid a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ contains no square numbers?\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Problem:**\n    *   We are looking for a subset $A$ of the first $N$ integers.\n    *   The size of $A$ should be a fraction of $N$, denoted by $c$. The term $o(1)$ indicates that we are interested in the asymptotic behavior as $N \\to \\infty$. Specifically, $\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{|A|}{N} = c$.\n    *   The condition is that for any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$ (possibly $a_1=a_2$), their sum $a_1+a_2$ must not be a perfect square.\n    *   We want to find the maximum possible value of $c$.\n\n2.  **Lower Bound for c (Construction of such sets):**\n    We can construct such sets $A$ using modular arithmetic. The idea is to find a modulus $m$ and a subset of residues $B \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_m = \\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}$ such that for any $b_1, b_2 \\in B$, the sum $b_1+b_2 \\pmod m$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $m$.\n    *   Let $Q_m = \\{k^2 \\pmod m \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ be the set of squares modulo $m$.\n    *   We choose $B \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_m$ such that $(B+B) \\cap Q_m = \\emptyset$.\n    *   Then we define the set $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\pmod m \\in B\\}$.\n    *   For any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, we have $a_1 \\equiv b_1 \\pmod m$ and $a_2 \\equiv b_2 \\pmod m$ for some $b_1, b_2 \\in B$.\n    *   Thus, $a_1+a_2 \\equiv b_1+b_2 \\pmod m$. By our choice of $B$, $b_1+b_2 \\pmod m$ is not a square modulo $m$.\n    *   If a number is a perfect square, say $k^2$, then its residue modulo $m$, $k^2 \\pmod m$, must be in $Q_m$.\n    *   Since $a_1+a_2 \\pmod m \\notin Q_m$, $a_1+a_2$ cannot be a perfect square.\n    *   The size of such a set $A$ is approximately $|A| \\approx N \\cdot \\frac{|B|}{m}$. So the density is $c = \\frac{|B|}{m}$. Our goal is to maximize this ratio.\n\n    *   **Example 1: m=3**\n        The squares modulo 3 are $Q_3=\\{0^2, 1^2, 2^2\\} \\pmod 3 = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n        The non-squares are $\\{2\\}$. We need $B+B \\subseteq \\{2\\}$.\n        If we choose $B=\\{1\\}$, then $1+1=2$, which is not a square mod 3. This works.\n        The density is $|B|/m = 1/3$. This construction shows that $c \\ge 1/3$. The set is $A=\\{n \\in \\{1,...,N\\} \\mid n\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$.\n\n    *   **Example 2: m=p² for p ≡ 1 (mod 4)**\n        It is a known result from number theory (e.g., from a paper by Leung, Ling, and Ma in the Journal of Algebra, 2012) that one can find a subset $B \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}$ of size $|B| = (p^2-p)/2$ for which $B+B$ contains no squares modulo $p^2$.\n        This gives a density of $c = \\frac{(p^2-p)/2}{p^2} = \\frac{p-1}{2p} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p}\\right)$.\n        Let's test this for some primes $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$:\n        -   For $p=5$, the density is $\\frac{5-1}{2 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$. This is greater than $1/3$.\n        -   For $p=13$, the density is $\\frac{13-1}{2 \\cdot 13} = \\frac{12}{26} = \\frac{6}{13} \\approx 0.46$.\n        As we take larger and larger primes $p$ congruent to 1 mod 4, the density $\\frac{1}{2}(1 - 1/p)$ gets closer and closer to $1/2$.\n        The supremum of these densities is $\\lim_{p\\to\\infty, p\\equiv 1(4)} \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\frac{1}{p}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n        This implies that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, we can construct a set $A$ with density $c > 1/2 - \\epsilon$ such that $A+A$ has no squares. Therefore, the largest possible value for $c$ must be at least $1/2$. So, $c \\ge 1/2$.\n\n3.  **Upper Bound for c:**\n    Now we show that $c$ cannot be greater than $1/2$.\n    *   Let $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ be a set such that $A+A$ contains no squares.\n    *   Suppose the asymptotic density is $c$, so $|A| = (c+o(1))N$.\n    *   Let's assume for contradiction that $c > 1/2$. Then for any small $\\epsilon > 0$ such that $c-\\epsilon > 1/2$, there exists an integer $M$ such that for all $m > M$, we have $|A \\cap \\{1, ..., m\\}|/m > c-\\epsilon > 1/2$.\n    *   Now, let's choose a large integer $k$ such that the square $s_k=k^2$ is large enough, specifically $s_k-1 > M$.\n    *   Consider the set of integers $\\{1, 2, \\dots, s_k-1\\}$. We can form $(s_k-1)/2$ pairs of distinct integers that sum to $s_k$:\n        $\\{1, s_k-1\\}, \\{2, s_k-2\\}, \\dots, \\left\\{\\frac{s_k-1}{2}, \\frac{s_k+1}{2}\\right\\}$.\n    *   For $A$ to be sum-free from squares, it cannot contain both elements from any pair $\\{j, s_k-j\\}$, because their sum is the square $s_k$.\n    *   Thus, from each of the $(s_k-1)/2$ pairs, $A$ can contain at most one element.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of elements from $\\{1, \\dots, s_k-1\\}$ that can be in $A$ is at most $(s_k-1)/2$.\n    *   So, $|A \\cap \\{1, \\dots, s_k-1\\}| \\le \\frac{s_k-1}{2}$.\n    *   This implies that the density of $A$ within this interval is $\\frac{|A \\cap \\{1, \\dots, s_k-1\\}|}{s_k-1} \\le \\frac{1}{2}$.\n    *   However, from our assumption that $c > 1/2$, we chose $k$ such that $s_k-1 > M$, which forces the density in this interval to be greater than $1/2$.\n    *   This is a clear contradiction. The density must be greater than $1/2$ and less than or equal to $1/2$ simultaneously, which is impossible.\n    *   Therefore, our initial assumption that $c>1/2$ must be false. This gives us the upper bound $c \\le 1/2$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Combining the lower bound ($c \\ge 1/2$) and the upper bound ($c \\le 1/2$), we find that the largest possible value for $c$ is exactly $1/2$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe largest number $c$ is $1/2$."
