    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Trisyllabic Laxing\n\nTrisyllabic Laxing (or Trisyllabic Shortening) is a phonological rule in the history of English. It states that a long vowel or diphthong becomes a short (lax) vowel when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end) of a word. For the rule to apply, the word must have at least three syllables, and the relevant syllable is typically stressed.\n\nA clear example is the pair `divine` and `divinity`.\n*   `divine` (/dɪˈvaɪn/): The base word has a long diphthong /aɪ/.\n*   `divinity` (/dɪˈvɪn.ə.ti/): When the suffix `-ity` is added, the word becomes four syllables. The stress shifts to the antepenultimate syllable (`-vin-`), and the vowel laxes from /aɪ/ to the short vowel /ɪ/.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Word\n\nWe will examine each word in the list to see if it fits the pattern of trisyllabic laxing. This involves checking its syllable count and comparing its vowel to a related word.\n\n1.  **southern**\n    *   Syllables: Two (`south-ern`, /ˈsʌðərn/).\n    *   Analysis: Since the word is not trisyllabic, it cannot undergo *trisyllabic* laxing by definition. It does show vowel shortening when compared to its base word `south` (/saʊθ/ -> /ʌ/), but this is due to a different historical process, not the trisyllabic rule.\n    *   Verdict: Has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n2.  **derivative**\n    *   Syllables: Four (`de-riv-a-tive`, /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/).\n    *   Related word: `derive` (/dɪˈraɪv/).\n    *   Analysis: The base word `derive` has a long diphthong /aɪ/. In the four-syllable word `derivative`, the stress is on the antepenultimate syllable (`-riv-`), and the vowel has laxed to /ɪ/.\n    *   Verdict: This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n3.  **serenity**\n    *   Syllables: Four (`se-ren-i-ty`, /səˈrɛnəti/).\n    *   Related word: `serene` (/səˈriːn/).\n    *   Analysis: The base word `serene` has a long vowel /iː/. In the four-syllable word `serenity`, the stress is on the antepenultimate syllable (`-ren-`), and the vowel has laxed to /ɛ/.\n    *   Verdict: This is another classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n4.  **pleasant**\n    *   Syllables: Two (`pleas-ant`, /ˈplɛzənt/).\n    *   Analysis: Like `southern`, this word is disyllabic and thus cannot have undergone *trisyllabic* laxing. It shows a vowel alternation with the word `please` (/pliːz/ -> /ɛ/), but this is an example of a different type of shortening (pre-cluster shortening).\n    *   Verdict: Has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n5.  **gratitude**\n    *   Syllables: Three (`grat-i-tude`, /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/).\n    *   Related word: `grateful` (/ˈɡreɪtfʊl/).\n    *   Analysis: The related word `grateful` has a long diphthong /eɪ/. In the three-syllable word `gratitude`, the stress is on the antepenultimate syllable (`grat-`), and the vowel is the short vowel /æ/.\n    *   Verdict: This word fits the pattern of trisyllabic laxing perfectly.\n\n6.  **shadow**\n    *   Syllables: Two (`shad-ow`, /ˈʃædoʊ/).\n    *   Analysis: This is a disyllabic word, so it cannot have undergone *trisyllabic* laxing.\n    *   Verdict: Has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Correct Answer from the Candidates\n\nWe have identified three words that have undergone or fit the pattern of trisyllabic laxing (`derivative`, `serenity`, `gratitude`). We have also identified three words that have not, because they are not trisyllabic (`southern`, `pleasant`, `shadow`). To find the single correct answer, we must find a deeper distinction.\n\nLet's compare the historical development of `southern`, `pleasant`, and `shadow`.\n*   `southern`: The vowel shortening from `south` is an active process caused by the suffix `-ern`. So, the word *did* undergo a shortening process.\n*   `pleasant`: The vowel alternation with `please` is present in Modern English, but historically, `pleasant` was borrowed from French with its short vowel. It didn't derive from `please` in English.\n*   `shadow`: This case is unique. Historically, both `shadow` (OE *sceadwe*) and its relative `shade` (OE *sceadu*) had short vowels. In Middle English, the vowel in `shade` was *lengthened* because it was in an open syllable (`sha-de`). The vowel in `shadow` remained short because the syllable was \"closed\" by the following `w` (`shad-ow`), preventing lengthening.\n\nTherefore, `shadow` is the only word on the list that did not undergo a vowel *shortening* process at all. Instead, its related word `shade` underwent a vowel *lengthening* process. This makes it the most distinct case of a word that \"has not undergone\" laxing.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
