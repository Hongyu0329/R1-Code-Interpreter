    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Who:** Two Nobel laureates.\n*   **What:** They were featured in a commercial.\n*   **For whom:** The company Enron.\n*   **When:** The year 2000.\n*   **Key Detail:** The commercial had the tagline \"Ask Why\".\n*   **Adjective:** The commercial is described as \"infamous,\" which hints at the later controversy surrounding Enron.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Research and Identification**\nA search for \"Enron commercial Ask Why Nobel\" quickly points to an advertising campaign Enron ran to position itself as an innovative, forward-thinking company. These commercials featured various intellectuals. The two individuals who are now Nobel laureates and appeared in this campaign are:\n1.  Paul Krugman\n2.  Myron Scholes\n\n**Step 3: Careful Point Analysis - Verifying their Nobel Laureate Status**\nThis step is crucial for accuracy and addresses a subtle point in the question. We must verify when each person received their Nobel Prize relative to the commercial's air date (2000).\n\n*   **Myron Scholes:** He, along with Robert C. Merton, was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **1997**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** At the time the commercial aired in 2000, Myron Scholes was already a Nobel laureate.\n\n*   **Paul Krugman:** He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **2008**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** At the time the commercial aired in 2000, Paul Krugman was a prominent economist but was *not yet* a Nobel laureate.\n\n**Step 4: Re-evaluating the Question's Phrasing**\nThe question asks, \"Which two Nobel laureates **were featured**...\". The verb \"were featured\" is in the past tense, but the noun \"Nobel laureates\" describes their current status. The question does not state \"Which two people, who were Nobel laureates at the time, were featured...\". Therefore, the most accurate answer includes both individuals, as both are now indisputably Nobel laureates who appeared in the specified commercials. The fact that Krugman won his prize later is a key piece of trivia associated with this infamous campaign.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesizing the Final Answer**\nBased on the analysis, the two individuals who were featured in Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial campaign and are known as Nobel laureates are Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes. The context that makes their appearance \"infamous\" is Enron's spectacular collapse due to fraud just a year later, which made their endorsement—intended to project intelligence and integrity—deeply ironic in hindsight.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"
