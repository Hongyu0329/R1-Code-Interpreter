    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step 1: Identify all named mountains in the *Iliad*\nFirst, we must compile a list of all specific, named mountains that are mentioned in the text of the *Iliad*. These are:\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, it is the most frequently mentioned mountain and serves as the benchmark for height.\n*   **Mount Ida:** This is the mountain near Troy (modern-day Kaz Dağı in Turkey) from which Zeus frequently observes the Trojan War. It is mentioned in numerous books, for example, in Book 8 where Zeus travels there to watch the battle.\n*   **Mount Samothrace:** In Book 13, the god Poseidon watches the battle from \"the topmost peak of wooded Samothrace\" (modern-day Fengari).\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, as the goddess Hera travels from Olympus to Lemnos, she is described as leaping from the peak of Mount Athos over the sea.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain is mentioned as the source of the ash-wood shaft for Achilles' great spear (e.g., Book 16 and Book 19).\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** In the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2), the Maeonian forces are described as being \"born in the land of Tmolus\" (modern-day Bozdağ in Turkey).\n\n### Step 2: Confirm they are \"historical\" mountains\nAll the mountains listed above are real, physical locations that can be found on modern maps of Greece and Turkey. They are not purely mythological constructs, thus they all qualify as \"historical mountains\".\n\n### Step 3: Find the elevation of each mountain\nUsing modern geographical data, we can find the height of the highest peak of each mountain:\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 meters (9,573 ft)\n*   **Mount Tmolus (Bozdağ):** 2,159 meters (7,083 ft)\n*   **Mount Athos:** 2,033 meters (6,670 ft)\n*   **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı):** 1,774 meters (5,820 ft)\n*   **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 meters (5,328 ft)\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Fengari):** 1,611 meters (5,285 ft)\n\n### Step 4: Rank the mountains by height and find the answer\nNow, we can rank the mountains from tallest to shortest to find which one comes after Mount Olympus.\n\n1.  **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 m\n2.  **Mount Tmolus:** 2,159 m\n3.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n4.  **Mount Ida:** 1,774 m\n5.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n6.  **Mount Samothrace:** 1,611 m\n\nThe question asks for the tallest mountain *after* Mount Olympus. As the list clearly shows, the second tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Tmolus.\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   **Trojan Ida vs. Cretan Ida:** The *Iliad* is set around Troy, and the context of Zeus watching the battle makes it certain that the reference is to the Trojan Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı), not the taller Mount Ida in Crete (2,456 m), which is associated with Zeus's birth.\n*   **Named Mountains vs. Regions:** The text also mentions mountainous regions like Pieria. While the Pierian Mountains have a peak taller than Tmolus (Flampouro at 2,193 m), the *Iliad* refers to \"Pieria\" as a region Hera passes through, not as a specific, named mountain peak like \"Mount Athos\" or \"Mount Tmolus\". Therefore, Tmolus is the most accurate answer for a named \"mountain\".\n*   **Excluding Mountains Not in the *Iliad*:** Some mountains prominent in Greek myth (like Ossa or Helicon) are not mentioned by name in the *Iliad* and were therefore excluded from the analysis.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
