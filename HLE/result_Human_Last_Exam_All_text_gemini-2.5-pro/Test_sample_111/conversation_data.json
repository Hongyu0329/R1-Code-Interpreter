    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n\n**Step 1: Establish the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death.**\nBlanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt and the subject of Chaucer's poem *The Book of the Duchess*, died on **September 12, 1368**. The cause of death is believed to have been the plague. She died in England, at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire.\n\n**Step 2: Examine historical records of Geoffrey Chaucer's movements in 1368.**\nTo know where Chaucer was in September 1368, we must look at the documented records of his life and travels.\n*   **July 17, 1368:** A surviving royal document, a patent of protection, was issued to Geoffrey Chaucer. This document granted him a license to travel abroad (\"to parts beyond the sea\") from the port of Dover.\n*   **October/December 1368:** Records from late 1368 (specifically an account entry from October and a royal gift noted on December 25) show that Chaucer was back in England and serving in the royal household.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the timeline.**\nBased on these records, we can construct a timeline:\n1.  Chaucer left England for the European continent sometime after July 17, 1368.\n2.  Blanche of Lancaster died in England on September 12, 1368.\n3.  Chaucer was back in England by late October 1368.\n\nThis timeline strongly indicates that Chaucer was not in England when Blanche died. He was on the continent, carrying out some form of official business for the king.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the possible locations.**\nNow we must consider the specific location of his travel.\n*   **The Problem:** The royal patent that authorized his travel does not specify his destination. This lack of detail was common for diplomatic or secret missions.\n*   **Plausible Destinations:** Given Chaucer's career as a diplomat, he could have been sent to various places. France is a strong possibility due to the ongoing political negotiations related to the Hundred Years' War. He also traveled to Spain and Flanders during his career. His famous trips to Italy occurred later, in the 1370s.\n*   **The Careful Point:** While historians can speculate that he was likely in France or a nearby region, there is no definitive historical document that confirms his exact location in September 1368. We know he was abroad, but we don't know precisely where.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude based on the evidence.**\nSince we know Chaucer was traveling \"beyond the sea\" from July to at least September 1368, but the specific destination of this trip is not recorded, the most accurate and historically responsible answer is that his location is unknown.\n\n*   **A. Italy:** Unlikely; his Italian journeys were later.\n*   **B. France:** Plausible, but not confirmed by any record for this specific trip.\n*   **C. England:** Incorrect; records show he was authorized to be abroad.\n*   **D. Unknown:** Correct; the specific destination of his mission is not documented.\n*   **E. Scotland:** No evidence supports this.\n\n<<<D>>>"
