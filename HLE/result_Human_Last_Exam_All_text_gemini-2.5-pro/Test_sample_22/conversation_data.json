    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** SNP heritability is a population-level parameter. It represents the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype (e.g., height, disease risk) that can be explained by the additive effects of all the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that are typically measured on a genotyping chip. It is the *theoretical upper limit* or the ceiling of how much phenotypic variance can be explained if we knew the true effect size of every single SNP and could combine them perfectly. It's a measure of the total signal present in the SNPs.\n\n2.  **Define Polygenic Score (PGS) and its Predictive Ability:** A polygenic score is a tool for individual-level prediction. It is a number calculated for an individual by summing up their alleles across many genetic loci, with each allele weighted by its estimated effect on the phenotype. These effect size estimates are derived from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). The predictive ability of the PGS is typically measured by the R-squared (R²) value, which quantifies the proportion of variance in the phenotype that the PGS can explain in a new, independent set of individuals (the \"test\" or \"target\" sample).\n\n3.  **Compare the Two Concepts:**\n    *   **SNP heritability (h²_SNP)** is the *potential* variance that can be explained. It assumes perfect knowledge of the true effect sizes of all SNPs.\n    *   **PGS predictive ability (R²)** is the *actual* variance that is explained by a model we build. This model is inherently imperfect.\n\n4.  **Identify Reasons for Imperfection in PGS:** The predictive ability of a PGS is almost always lower than the SNP heritability for several key reasons:\n    *   **Imperfect Effect Size Estimates:** The weights used in a PGS are *estimates* from a GWAS, not the true biological effect sizes. Because any GWAS has a finite sample size, these estimates contain statistical noise or \"estimation error.\" A larger GWAS discovery sample leads to more precise estimates and a more powerful PGS, but the estimates are never perfect.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** The SNPs identified in a GWAS are often not the causal variants themselves but are simply correlated (in LD) with the true causal variants. Methods to build a PGS try to account for these complex correlation patterns, but this modeling is imperfect.\n    *   **Population Differences:** The genetic structure (e.g., LD patterns, allele frequencies) of the population used for the GWAS discovery may differ from the population in which the PGS is being tested. This mismatch reduces the predictive accuracy.\n    *   **Genetic Architecture Assumptions:** The models used to build the PGS make simplifying assumptions about the genetic architecture of the trait (e.g., that all effects are additive) which may not perfectly reflect the underlying biology.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSNP heritability (h²_SNP) represents the theoretical ceiling of predictive power from a given set of SNPs. A polygenic score is a practical attempt to reach that ceiling. Due to unavoidable real-world limitations, primarily the estimation error in the effect sizes from finite GWAS samples, the performance of the PGS (measured by R²) will not reach this theoretical maximum. Therefore, the variance explained by a PGS is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability. The gap between the two can be reduced by using larger GWAS samples and more sophisticated methods, but it cannot be completely eliminated in practice.\n\nThe statement is **True**.\n\n<<<True>>>"
