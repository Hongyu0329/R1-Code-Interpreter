    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for the efficient production of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Synthesis of Xenon Tetrafluoride (XeF4)**\nThe primary method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) is through the direct reaction of Xenon (Xe) gas and Fluorine (F2) gas. The chemical equation for this reaction is:\nXe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Conditions Required for the Reaction**\nThis synthesis is a classic example of a reaction that requires specific conditions to be \"efficient,\" which means achieving a good reaction rate and a high yield of the desired product while minimizing side products. The key variables are temperature, pressure, and the molar ratio of the reactants.\n\n*   **Activation Energy:** The reaction between Xe and F₂ has a significant activation energy barrier. This means that a certain amount of energy, typically in the form of heat, must be supplied to initiate the reaction and allow it to proceed at a practical rate.\n*   **Temperature's Role:**\n    *   **If the temperature is too low:** The reactant molecules will not have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the activation energy barrier. The reaction rate will be extremely slow, making the process inefficient.\n    *   **If the temperature is too high:** While this increases the reaction rate, it can also lead to the formation of other xenon fluorides. Specifically, at higher temperatures (e.g., above 500 °C), the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) becomes more favorable, especially with an excess of fluorine. This would decrease the yield and purity of XeF₄, making the process inefficient for its production.\n*   **Stoichiometry:** To favor the formation of XeF₄ over other fluorides like XeF₂ or XeF₆, a specific molar ratio of reactants is used, typically around 1 part Xenon to 5 parts Fluorine (a stoichiometric excess of fluorine).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Standard Temperature for Efficient Synthesis**\nBased on established chemical literature and standard laboratory procedures, the synthesis of XeF₄ is most efficiently carried out by heating the mixture of Xenon and Fluorine in a sealed vessel (often made of nickel) to a specific temperature. The generally accepted optimal temperature for this process is **400 °C**. At this temperature, the reaction proceeds at a good rate and selectively produces XeF₄ in high yield.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Given Answer Choices**\nLet's evaluate each option based on the principles discussed above.\n\n*   **A. 600 °C:** This temperature is too high. It would favor the formation of XeF₆, thus it is not an efficient temperature for producing XeF₄.\n*   **B. 400 °C:** This is the well-documented, standard temperature for the efficient synthesis of XeF₄. It provides the necessary activation energy without promoting the formation of undesired side products.\n*   **C. 200 °C:** At this temperature, the reaction rate would be significantly slower than at 400 °C due to the high activation energy. The synthesis would not be considered efficient.\n*   **D. 78 °C:** This temperature is far too low for the thermal reaction to proceed at a meaningful rate.\n*   **E. 0 °C:** Same as above, the reaction rate would be negligible.\n*   **F. -78 °C:** At this very low temperature, there is virtually no thermal reaction.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe question asks for the coldest temperature at which the synthesis is *still efficient*. While some reaction might occur at temperatures slightly below 400 °C, the efficiency drops off quickly. Among the given choices, 400 °C is the established temperature that marks the lower bound for an efficient, practical synthesis via the common thermal method. Any colder temperatures listed would result in an inefficient process.\n\n<<<B>>>"
