    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given protein sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Coiled-Coil Heptad Repeat**\n\nCoiled-coils are characterized by a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern, known as a heptad repeat, which is conventionally labeled `abcdefg`. The residues at positions 'a' and 'd' are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the structure, mediating the interaction between helices.\n\nLet's analyze the given sequence: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nWe need to find the correct `abcdefg` frame. We can do this by looking for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues (like I, L, A, W, V) separated by two or three other residues.\nLet's highlight the major hydrophobic residues in the sequence: `GE**I**AQS**L**KE**I**AKS**L**KE**I**AWS**L**KE**I**AQS**L**KG`\n\nWe can see a clear `H-x-x-x-H-x-x` pattern (where H is hydrophobic). This corresponds to a hydrophobic residue at position 'd', followed by another at position 'a' of the next heptad (`d-e-f-g-a-b-c`).\n\nLet's assign the positions based on this pattern, starting with the first `I` as a 'd' position. We can ignore the short flanking sequences `GE` at the beginning and `KG` at the end.\n\n*   **Heptad 1:** `I` A Q S `L` K E\n    *   `d` e f g `a` b c\n*   **Heptad 2:** `I` A K S `L` K E\n    *   `d` e f g `a` b c\n*   **Heptad 3:** `I` A W S `L` K E\n    *   `d` e f g `a` b c\n*   **Heptad 4:** `I` A Q S `L` K G\n    *   `d` e f g `a` b c (truncated)\n\nThis alignment is consistent throughout the sequence.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the Core 'a' and 'd' Positions**\n\nBased on the alignment above, let's list the amino acids at the core 'a' and 'd' positions:\n\n*   **Residues at position 'a'**: L, L, L, L (Leucine)\n*   **Residues at position 'd'**: I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n\nThe core of this coiled-coil is exclusively composed of Leucine at the 'a' positions and Isoleucine at the 'd' positions.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Knobs-into-Holes Packing Principles**\n\nThe oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) is heavily influenced by how efficiently the side chains from the 'a' and 'd' positions can pack together in the hydrophobic core. This is known as \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** In a parallel dimer, the core residues pack at an angle. The \"knob\" from the 'a' position of one helix fits into a \"hole\" created by residues on the partner helix, primarily involving the 'd' position residue. This is called `a-d'` packing. The bulky, beta-branched side chains of Leucine (L) and Isoleucine (I) are known to pack very efficiently in this arrangement. The combination of `L` at 'a' and `I` at 'd' is a classic motif for stable dimers.\n\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** In a trimer, the core layers are typically formed by interactions between three 'a' residues (`a-a-a`) or three 'd' residues (`d-d-d`). Packing three bulky residues like Leucine or Isoleucine into the same layer is sterically very unfavorable. It would create significant clashes and poor packing efficiency, destabilizing a trimer. Trimers are often stabilized by smaller residues (like Alanine) or specific polar interactions (like Asparagine) in the core.\n\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** A tetramer is often described as a \"dimer of dimers.\" It involves two types of interfaces. One interface resembles a dimer (`a-d'` packing), while the other involves `a-a'` and `d-d'` packing. While the `L(a)-I(d')` interface would be stable, the `L(a)-L(a')` and `I(d)-I(d')` interfaces would suffer from the same steric hindrance issues described for the trimer. The specific combination of `I` at 'a' and `L` at 'd' is a strong predictor for tetramers, but the reverse (`L` at 'a' and `I` at 'd', as seen here) is a strong predictor for dimers.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence has a consistent heptad repeat with Leucine (L) at all 'a' positions and Isoleucine (I) at all 'd' positions. This `L(a)-I(d)` core composition strongly favors the formation of a **dimer** due to optimal knobs-into-holes packing efficiency. Higher-order oligomers like trimers or tetramers would be destabilized by steric clashes between the bulky side chains in the core. Therefore, the most likely oligomeric state is 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
