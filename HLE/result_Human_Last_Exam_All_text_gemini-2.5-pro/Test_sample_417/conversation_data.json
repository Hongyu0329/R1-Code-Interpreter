    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of the given molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the molecular structure and symmetry.**\n\nThe molecule is 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n\n*   **Central Core:** The core of the molecule is a benzene ring. It is substituted at all six positions.\n    *   At positions 2, 4, and 6, there are methyl (`-CH3`) groups.\n    *   At positions 1, 3, and 5, there are large substituent groups: `[((...)-yl)methyl]`.\n*   **Symmetry of the Core:** The substitution pattern on the benzene ring (alternating between two types of substituents) gives the molecule a three-fold rotational axis of symmetry (C3) passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n*   **Consequence of C3 Symmetry:** This C3 axis makes the three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 chemically equivalent. It also makes the three large substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5 chemically equivalent.\n*   **Conclusion for counting:** Due to this equivalence, we only need to count the number of distinct proton signals arising from one of the methyl groups (e.g., at C2) and one of the large substituents (e.g., at C1), and then sum them up to get the total number of signals for the entire molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Count the signals from the core and linker protons.**\n\n*   **2,4,6-trimethyl groups:** The three methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. Protons within each methyl group are also equivalent due to free rotation. Therefore, all 9 protons of these three methyl groups give rise to a single signal.\n    *   **Number of signals = 1**\n\n*   **1,3,5-linker groups:** The substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5 are connected to the benzene ring via a methylene (`-CH2-`) linker (`...yl)methyl]`).\n    *   The three `-CH2-` groups are chemically equivalent due to the C3 symmetry.\n    *   However, we must consider the two protons *within* each `-CH2-` group. Each `-CH2-` group is attached to a chiral substituent (the `(4S,7R)-...-indazolyl` group). Protons of a methylene group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent and will have different chemical shifts.\n    *   Therefore, the two protons of each `-CH2-` group are non-equivalent. Let's call them Ha and Hb. By C3 symmetry, all three Ha protons (one from each linker) are equivalent to each other, and all three Hb protons are equivalent to each other. But the set of Ha protons is not equivalent to the set of Hb protons.\n    *   This results in two distinct signals for the linker protons.\n    *   **Number of signals = 2**\n\n**Step 3: Count the signals from one of the chiral substituents.**\n\nThe substituent is `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`. This is a derivative of camphor fused with a pyrazole ring. The key feature is that this entire group is chiral (as indicated by the (4S,7R) designation) and has no internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, any protons that are not interchangeable by bond rotation will be chemically non-equivalent.\n\nLet's list the protons in one of these substituents:\n1.  **Pyrazole ring proton (H3):** There is one proton on the pyrazole part of the indazole system. Its chemical environment is unique.\n    *   **1 signal**\n2.  **Bridgehead proton (H4):** The proton on the C4 bridgehead is in a unique environment.\n    *   **1 signal**\n3.  **Bridgehead methyl group (C7-CH3):** The methyl group on the C7 bridgehead. The three protons of this group are equivalent due to rotation. The group itself is in a unique position.\n    *   **1 signal**\n4.  **Methano-bridge gem-dimethyl group (C8-(CH3)2):** The C8 bridge has two methyl groups. Since the overall substituent is chiral, these two methyl groups are in diastereotopic environments. They are non-equivalent.\n    *   **2 signals**\n5.  **Methylene protons at C5 (C5-H2):** The two protons on the C5 carbon are diastereotopic because C5 is adjacent to the C4 stereocenter and the molecule is chiral.\n    *   **2 signals**\n6.  **Methylene protons at C6 (C6-H2):** Similarly, the two protons on the C6 carbon are diastereotopic because C6 is adjacent to the C7 stereocenter.\n    *   **2 signals**\n\nSumming the signals from one substituent: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **9 signals**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of signals.**\n\nThe total number of signals is the sum of the signals from each chemically distinct part of the molecule.\nTotal signals = (Signals from core methyls) + (Signals from linker methylenes) + (Signals from one substituent)\nTotal signals = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12\n\nTherefore, 12 distinct peaks (signals) are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nFinal check of the points:\n*   Molecule has C3 symmetry.\n*   Three core methyl groups are equivalent -> 1 signal.\n*   Three linker CH2 groups are equivalent. Protons within each CH2 are diastereotopic due to the attached chiral group -> 2 signals.\n*   The chiral substituent has no internal symmetry. Counting its non-equivalent protons: H3 (1), H4 (1), C7-Me (1), C8-Me2 (2, diastereotopic), C5-H2 (2, diastereotopic), C6-H2 (2, diastereotopic). Total = 9 signals.\n*   Total for the molecule = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12 signals.\n\n<<<H>>>"
