    "An analysis of the problem of finding the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Initial Properties of the function *f***\n\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = e^x$. We want to find the cardinality of $S$, denoted as $|S|$.\n\n*   **Injectivity:** First, we show that any function $f \\in S$ must be injective (one-to-one).\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$.\n    Using the given equation, this means $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$.\n    Since the exponential function $g(x) = e^x$ is strictly increasing, it is injective. Thus, $x_1 = x_2$.\n    Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n*   **Monotonicity:** A key theorem in real analysis states that a continuous function on an interval (in this case, $\\mathbb{R}$) is injective if and only if it is strictly monotone.\n    Therefore, any function $f \\in S$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n**2. Case 1: *f* is strictly decreasing**\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function.\n\n*   Consider the function $h(x) = f(x) - x$. Since $f$ and $x$ are continuous, $h(x)$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n*   As $x \\to \\infty$, since $f$ is decreasing, its limit is either a finite value $L$ or $-\\infty$. In either case, the term $-x$ dominates, so $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} h(x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} (f(x) - x) = -\\infty$.\n*   As $x \\to -\\infty$, since $f$ is decreasing, its limit is either a finite value $M$ or $+\\infty$. In either case, the term $-x$ goes to $+\\infty$, so $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} h(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} (f(x) - x) = +\\infty$.\n*   Since $h(x)$ is a continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$ and its limits at $-\\infty$ and $+\\infty$ have opposite signs, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist a point $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $h(c) = 0$.\n*   $h(c) = 0$ implies $f(c) - c = 0$, which means $f(c) = c$. So, $c$ is a fixed point of $f$.\n*   If $f(c) = c$, then $f(f(c)) = f(c) = c$.\n*   From the original equation, we have $f(f(c)) = e^c$.\n*   This implies that $c = e^c$.\n*   However, the equation $x = e^x$ has no real solutions. The graph of $y=e^x$ is always above the line $y=x$. (The minimum value of $e^x - x$ is $1$, which occurs at $x=0$).\n*   This is a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption must be false.\n\n**Conclusion for Case 1:** There are no strictly decreasing continuous functions that satisfy the given equation.\n\n**3. Case 2: *f* is strictly increasing**\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a strictly increasing continuous function.\n\n*   **Fixed Points:** As in the previous case, if $f$ had a fixed point $c$, it would lead to the contradiction $c = e^c$. Therefore, $f$ has no fixed points.\n*   **Behavior relative to y=x:** Since $f$ is continuous and has no fixed points, the graph of $y=f(x)$ must lie entirely above or entirely below the line $y=x$. That is, either $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, or $f(x) < x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   If we assume $f(x) < x$ for all $x$, then since $f$ is increasing, we can apply $f$ to both sides: $f(f(x)) < f(x)$. Combining the inequalities, we get $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. This implies $e^x < x$. But this is false for all real numbers $x$.\n    *   Therefore, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n*   **Construction of Solutions:** We can construct functions that satisfy these properties. The method involves defining the function on a specific interval and then using the functional equation to extend it to all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    1.  **Find anchor points:** Let $A = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$. Since $f$ is increasing, its range is an interval $(A, B)$ where $B = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)$. The range of $f(f(x))$ is $f((A,B)) = (0, \\infty)$. Since $f$ is increasing, this implies $\\lim_{y\\to A^+} f(y) = 0$. By continuity, $f(A) = 0$. This requires $A$ to be a finite real number. Since the range of $f$ is $(A, \\infty)$, we must have $f(x) > A$ for all $x$. In particular, $f(A)=0>A$. Thus, $A$ must be a negative number.\n    2.  From $f(A)=0$, we find $f(f(A)) = e^A$, which means $f(0) = e^A$.\n    3.  **Choose a building block:** The construction can be based on defining $f$ on the interval $[A, 0]$.\n        *   Choose any real number $A < 0$. This choice will define a family of solutions.\n        *   $f$ must map the interval $[A, 0]$ to $[f(A), f(0)] = [0, e^A]$. Since $f$ must be strictly increasing and continuous on this interval, it must be a homeomorphism between these two intervals.\n        *   Choose any strictly increasing continuous bijection (homeomorphism) $h: [A, 0] \\to [0, e^A]$.\n    4.  **Extend the function:** Let $f(x) = h(x)$ for $x \\in [A, 0]$. This initial choice uniquely determines $f$ on all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n        *   For $x \\in [0, e^A]$, we can write $x=h(z)$ for a unique $z \\in [A,0]$. We must define $f(x) = f(h(z)) = f(f(z)) = e^z = e^{h^{-1}(x)}$.\n        *   This process can be continued to define $f$ on $[A, \\infty)$.\n        *   For $x < A$, we must have $e^x \\in (0, e^A)$. We define $f(x) = h^{-1}(e^x)$. This is well-defined and ensures $f(f(x)) = h(h^{-1}(e^x)) = e^x$.\n        *   The resulting function can be shown to be continuous and strictly increasing on all of $\\mathbb{R}$ and satisfies the equation.\n\n**4. Cardinality of the Set of Solutions**\n\nThe construction process depends on two choices:\n1.  The choice of the negative number $A$. The set of possible values for $A$ is $(-\\infty, 0)$, which has a cardinality of $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, $|\\mathbb{R}|$).\n2.  For each choice of $A$, the choice of the increasing homeomorphism $h$ from $[A, 0]$ to $[0, e^A]$. The set of such homeomorphisms also has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. A continuous function is determined by its values on a dense set (like the rationals). There are $\\mathfrak{c}$ ways to assign values to the rationals in $[A,0]$ in an order-preserving way into $[0, e^A]$.\n\nSince for each of the $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for $A$, we have $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for the function $h$, the total number of distinct increasing solutions we can construct is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe set $S$ is a subset of the set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. The cardinality of the set of all continuous functions is $\\mathfrak{c}$. This is because a continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on a countable dense subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, such as $\\mathbb{Q}$. So, the cardinality is $|\\mathbb{R}^{Q}| = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nSince we have constructed $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions and the total number of possible functions is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the set of solutions must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   The set of solutions can be partitioned into strictly increasing and strictly decreasing functions.\n*   The number of strictly decreasing solutions is 0.\n*   The number of strictly increasing solutions is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   Therefore, the total cardinality of the set is $0 + \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
