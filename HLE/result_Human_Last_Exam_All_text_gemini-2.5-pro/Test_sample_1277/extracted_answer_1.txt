FA2BG2S(Gc)1. The glycan is core-fucosylated (likely Fuc(α1-6)GlcNAc). It is a biantennary structure with a bisecting GlcNAc (linked β1-4 to the core mannose). The MSMS fragmentation suggests the NeuGc-containing antenna is attached to the α1-6 arm of the core, and the other antenna is attached to the α1-3 arm.
