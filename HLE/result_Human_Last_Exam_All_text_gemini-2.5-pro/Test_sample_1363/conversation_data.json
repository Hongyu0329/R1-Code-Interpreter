    "This question asks to identify the dance where overturning a reverse turn is impossible without violating its core technique. Let's analyze each dance style based on its fundamental principles.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the terms:**\n    *   **Reverse Turn:** A turn to the left. It's a fundamental figure in all five of the listed Standard Ballroom dances.\n    *   **Overturning:** Turning more than the standard, prescribed amount for a specific figure. For example, if a standard turn is 3/4 of a rotation, an overturned version would be 7/8 or a full rotation.\n    *   **\"Without disregarding the technique\":** This is the most critical part of the question. It means we must consider the defining technical rules of each dance. An action is \"impossible\" if it fundamentally breaks a core rule, not just if it's difficult or not in the basic syllabus.\n\n2.  **Analysis of each dance:**\n\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz:** The technique is based on continuous rotation. While the standard reverse turn completes one full rotation over 6 steps, it is technically possible to turn more or less to navigate the floor. Over-rotating is common and does not violate the core principles of continuous movement and rotation.\n\n    *   **B. English Waltz:** This dance is characterized by Rise and Fall, body sway, and flowing movement. Overturning turns is not only possible but is a standard part of the dance's vocabulary at higher levels. Figures like the \"Overturned Reverse Turn\" are named and taught, demonstrating that this action is well within the accepted technique of the dance.\n\n    *   **C. European Tango:** The technique of Tango is unique among the ballroom dances. Its key characteristics include:\n        *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dancers' heads should remain at a constant level. Movement is flat and grounded.\n        *   **Staccato Action:** Movements are sharp and punctuated, not smooth and flowing like in a Waltz.\n        *   **Grounded Movement:** Feet are kept in close contact with the floor, often described as \"cat-like\" or \"stalking.\" There is no \"foot rise\" (lifting onto the ball of the foot to rise).\n        *   To overturn a turn, a dancer typically needs to pivot more sharply or for a longer duration on the standing foot. In a swing dance like the Waltz, this is accommodated by rise and fall. In Tango, attempting a significant pivot to overturn the turn would almost inevitably force the dancer to rise up onto the ball of the foot, which directly violates the \"No Rise and Fall\" and \"No Foot Rise\" techniques. It would also destroy the staccato, planar character of the dance. Therefore, it is impossible to properly overturn a reverse turn in Tango without disregarding its most fundamental technical rules.\n\n    *   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** Like the Waltz, this is a smooth, flowing dance. Continuous movement is key. Overturning figures is a common and essential part of advanced Foxtrot choreography (e.g., Overturned Feather Finish, Overturned Reverse Wave). It is perfectly compatible with the dance's technique.\n\n    *   **E. Quickstep:** This dance is fast and dynamic, featuring hops, skips, and chasses. Its technique allows for a great deal of rotational variety. Overturned spins and turns are frequently used to create dynamic effects and to navigate corners at high speed. This action is fully within the technical possibilities of the dance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAmong the choices, only the European Tango has a core technical principle (\"No Rise and Fall\") that makes overturning a turn impossible without breaking that rule. The mechanics required for overturning (pivoting and rising) are fundamentally contrary to the grounded, level, and staccato nature of Tango.\n\n<<<C>>>"
