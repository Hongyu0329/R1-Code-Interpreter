    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Defining the Second Great War**\nThe \"Second Great War\" is the term used in StarCraft lore to describe the galaxy-wide conflict depicted throughout the *StarCraft II* trilogy. This includes the events of *Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*, culminating in the epilogue campaign, *Into the Void*. It is distinct from the first \"Great War,\" which refers to the events of the original *StarCraft* and its *Brood War* expansion.\n\n**Step 2: Establishing the Start Date**\nThe war begins with the start of the *Wings of Liberty* campaign. Multiple official sources, including the in-game story and supplementary materials like the *StarCraft: Field Manual*, place the beginning of these events in the year **2504**. This is four years after the conclusion of the Brood War.\n\n**Step 3: Establishing the End Date**\nThe war officially ends with the final defeat of the dark god Amon. This climactic event occurs during the *Legacy of the Void* epilogue campaign, *Into the Void*, where the united forces of the Terran, Zerg, and Protoss confront Amon within the Void itself and destroy him permanently. According to the most definitive and recent official timelines (such as the one presented in the *StarCraft: Field Manual* and the official 20th Anniversary timeline), this final battle, known as the \"End War,\" takes place in the year **2506**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Total Duration**\nWith a start date in **2504** and an end date in **2506**, we can calculate the war's duration. The conflict was active during:\n*   A portion of the year 2504.\n*   The entire year of 2505.\n*   A portion of the year 2056.\n\nThis means the total duration is definitively greater than 1 year (due to the inclusion of all of 2505) but less than 3 years. The narrative of the games depicts the campaigns happening in relatively quick succession, suggesting the total time elapsed is approximately two years. For example, if the war started in mid-2504 and ended in mid-2506, its duration would be exactly 2 years. If it started late in 2504 and ended early in 2506, its duration would be slightly over 1 year (e.g., 1 year and a few months).\n\n**Step 5: Applying the Rounding Rule**\nThe question requires the duration to be rounded *up* to the nearest whole year.\n*   If the duration was slightly over 1 year (e.g., 1.2 years), rounding up would result in **2 years**.\n*   If the duration was exactly 2 years, rounding up would also result in **2 years**.\n\nSince the war spans across three calendar years (2504, 2505, 2506), its duration must be greater than one full year. Based on the narrative pace, a duration between 1 and 2 years is the most logical conclusion. Rounding any value in this range (e.g., 1.5 years, 1.8 years, 2.0 years) up to the nearest whole number gives a final answer of 2.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Source Consistency:** Older fan wikis or interpretations sometimes condensed the timeline, but more recent official publications (*StarCraft: Field Manual*, anniversary materials) have clarified the timeline, placing the start in 2504 and the end in 2506. We must rely on the most current official lore.\n*   **War's End Point:** It's important to distinguish the end of the war (Amon's defeat in 2506) from the final cinematic of the epilogue, which takes place \"two years later\" (in 2508) and shows a peaceful aftermath. The war itself had already concluded.\n*   **\"Rounded Up\":** This instruction is key. A duration of \"about two years\" could be slightly less or slightly more, but since it's certainly more than one year, rounding it up leads to a definitive integer.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  **Start:** Year 2504\n2.  **End:** Year 2506\n3.  **Duration:** More than 1 year, and approximately 2 years. Let's call the duration `D`, where `1 < D â‰¤ 2`.\n4.  **Rounding:** The question asks to round the value of `D` up to the nearest whole number.\n5.  **Result:** `Ceiling(D)` is **2**.\n\n<<<2>>>"
