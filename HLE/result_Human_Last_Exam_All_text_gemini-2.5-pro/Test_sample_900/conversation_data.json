    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Performance:** Jete Woman solo scene.\n    *   **Ballet:** \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\".\n    *   **Choreographer:** William Forsythe.\n    *   **Company & Year:** Semperoper Ballett, 2015.\n    *   **Dancer:** Svetlana Gileva.\n    *   **Action to Count:** The number of \"pas de Balanchine\" performed.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Key Terms:**\n    *   **\"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" by William Forsythe:** This is a seminal neoclassical ballet created in 1987. Forsythe's style is known for deconstructing and pushing the limits of classical ballet technique. While he was heavily influenced by George Balanchine, his choreographic vocabulary is distinctly his own.\n    *   **\"Pas de Balanchine\":** This is the most crucial point of analysis. \"Pas de Balanchine\" is not a formal, codified step in the traditional ballet lexicon like a *plié* or a *grand jeté*. It is a colloquial term, a nickname used by dancers and balletomanes to describe a specific stylistic lunge frequently used by the choreographer George Balanchine. It typically involves a deep lunge with a thrusting hip and specific arm/torso coordination.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Core of the Question:**\n    *   The question asks to count the number of times a step named after one choreographer (George Balanchine) appears in a work by a different choreographer (William Forsythe).\n    *   A choreographer's work is a specific text of movements. A step is defined by the choreographer who created the piece. William Forsythe did not formally include a step called \"pas de Balanchine\" in his choreography for \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated.\"\n    *   While the Jete Woman solo contains numerous deep lunges, off-balance poses, and movements that might *stylistically resemble* the lunge associated with Balanchine, they are not officially \"pas de Balanchine.\" They are Forsythe's unique interpretation and sequencing of classical movements.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Counting the \"pas de Balanchine\" in a Forsythe ballet is akin to looking for a specific sentence by Shakespeare in a novel by Dickens. While both use the English language, the specific phrasing belongs to the author.\n    *   Because \"pas de Balanchine\" is not an official step in the ballet vocabulary and is not part of William Forsythe's designated choreography, the formal and technically correct number of times it is performed is zero. Any other count would be based on subjective interpretation of which lunges \"look like\" the move, which is not what the question implies with its request for a specific number.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the careful analysis that \"pas de Balanchine\" is a colloquial term for a stylistic move by choreographer George Balanchine and not a formal step included in William Forsythe's choreography for \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated,\" the number of times the step is officially performed is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
