    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the question\n\nThe question asks for the number of \"higher dimensional rooted forests\" $(F,R)$ on the \"standard triangulation of the Möbius band\" for which the forest $F$ does not simplicially collapse onto the root $R$.\n\nLet's break down the terms:\n*   **Standard triangulation of the Möbius band:** This is a simplicial complex, let's call it $M$, which is homeomorphic to the Möbius band. The specific details of the triangulation are not necessary, as the quantity we need to compute will depend only on the homotopy type of the space. The Möbius band is a 2-dimensional manifold with a boundary.\n*   **Higher dimensional rooted forest:** This is a pair of simplicial complexes $(F,R)$ such that $R$ is a subcomplex of $F$, and $F$ is a subcomplex of $M$. The term \"forest\" in this context (from the field of A-theory and higher-dimensional combinatorics) has a precise definition. A simplicial complex $F$ is called a **forest** (or **acyclic**) if all its reduced integer homology groups are trivial. That is, $\\tilde{H}_i(F; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for all $i \\ge 0$.\n    *   $\\tilde{H}_0(F; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ implies that $F$ is non-empty and path-connected.\n    *   $\\tilde{H}_k(F; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $k \\ge 1$ means $F$ has no higher-dimensional \"holes\".\n*   **Simplicial collapse:** This is a standard concept in piecewise-linear topology. We denote a simplicial collapse from $F$ to $R$ as $F \\searrow R$. The question is about the number of pairs $(F,R)$ where $F$ is a forest and $F \\not\\searrow R$.\n\n### Step 2: Finding the relevant mathematical theorem\n\nThis question belongs to a modern area of algebraic and topological combinatorics. There is a key theorem by Jakob Jonsson (and independently by others in similar forms) that directly answers this question.\n\n**Theorem (Jonsson):** Let $K$ be any simplicial complex. The number of rooted forests $(F,R)$ of $K$ (where $F$ is a forest in the sense defined above, and $R \\subseteq F$) such that $F$ does not simplicially collapse to $R$ is given by the formula:\n$$ N(K) = \\left( \\prod_{i \\ge 0} |\\text{Tor}(\\tilde{H}_i(K; \\mathbb{Z}))| \\right)^2 = |\\text{Tor}(\\tilde{H}_*(K; \\mathbb{Z}))|^2 $$\nwhere $\\text{Tor}(G)$ denotes the torsion subgroup of an abelian group $G$, and $|G|$ denotes the order (number of elements) of the group $G$.\n\nA rooted forest $(F,R)$ fails to be collapsible if and only if either the subcomplex $R$ is not a forest itself, or the inclusion map $R \\hookrightarrow F$ does not induce an isomorphism on the 0-th reduced homology group.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the theorem to the Möbius band\n\nTo use this theorem, we need to compute the reduced integer homology groups of the Möbius band, $M$, and find the order of their torsion subgroups.\n\nThe homology groups of the Möbius band are well-known:\n*   **$H_0(M; \\mathbb{Z})$:** Since the Möbius band is path-connected, $H_0(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   **$H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$:** The first homology group of the Möbius band is isomorphic to the integers, $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. This can be shown using a variety of methods, such as cellular homology or a Mayer-Vietoris sequence. The generator of this group is the homotopy class of the core circle of the band.\n*   **$H_n(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ for $n \\ge 2$:** Since the Möbius band is a 2-dimensional non-orientable manifold, its higher homology groups are trivial. $H_n(M; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for all $n \\ge 2$.\n\n### Step 4: Computing the reduced homology and torsion subgroups\n\nThe reduced homology groups $\\tilde{H}_i(K)$ are the same as the usual homology groups $H_i(K)$ for $i \\ge 1$. For $i=0$, $\\tilde{H}_0(K)$ is such that $H_0(K) \\cong \\tilde{H}_0(K) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$ (for a non-empty space).\n\n*   **$\\tilde{H}_0(M; \\mathbb{Z})$:** Since $H_0(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, we have $\\tilde{H}_0(M; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n*   **$\\tilde{H}_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$:** This is the same as $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$, so $\\tilde{H}_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   **$\\tilde{H}_n(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ for $n \\ge 2$:** These are the same as $H_n(M; \\mathbb{Z})$, so $\\tilde{H}_n(M; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $n \\ge 2$.\n\nNow, we find the torsion subgroup of each of these groups:\n*   **$\\text{Tor}(\\tilde{H}_0(M; \\mathbb{Z}))$**: The torsion subgroup of the trivial group $\\{0\\}$ is just $\\{0\\}$. Its order is $|\\{0\\}| = 1$.\n*   **$\\text{Tor}(\\tilde{H}_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}))$**: The torsion subgroup of the integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is the trivial group $\\{0\\}$. Its order is $|\\{0\\}| = 1$.\n*   **$\\text{Tor}(\\tilde{H}_n(M; \\mathbb{Z}))$ for $n \\ge 2$**: The torsion subgroup of the trivial group $\\{0\\}$ is $\\{0\\}$. Its order is $|\\{0\\}| = 1$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the final answer\n\nNow we substitute these values into Jonsson's formula:\n$$ N(M) = \\left( |\\text{Tor}(\\tilde{H}_0)| \\cdot |\\text{Tor}(\\tilde{H}_1)| \\cdot |\\text{Tor}(\\tilde{H}_2)| \\cdot \\ldots \\right)^2 $$\n$$ N(M) = (1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\ldots)^2 $$\n$$ N(M) = 1^2 = 1 $$\n\nThus, there is exactly one higher dimensional rooted forest $(F,R)$ of the standard triangulation of the Möbius band that fails to have the forest $F$ simplicially collapse onto the root $R$."
