    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\nThe first clue is a quote from the poet Andrei Voznesensky: \"a joy-discovering sailor\". This immediately points to a figure associated with Russian history, given Voznesensky's nationality. The description \"sailor\" suggests an explorer, navigator, or someone involved in maritime expeditions. \"Joy-discovering\" adds a romantic, pioneering element to this person's character.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\nThe second clue is another quote from Voznesensky about the same man: \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". This is a very specific and powerful clue. It tells us that for a long time, the burial place of this man was unknown. This often happens to explorers who die in remote locations or whose graves are lost to time or destruction.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the clues to a specific work.**\nBoth quotes are famously from Voznesensky's libretto for the Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\"). This work chronicles the real-life story of a Russian expedition to California in the early 19th century. The protagonist of this opera is the man we are looking for.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the man from the literary work.**\nThe central figure of \"Juno and Avos\" is the Russian diplomat, chamberlain, and explorer Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. He led an embassy to Japan and later sailed from Russian Alaska to Spanish California to secure provisions for the Russian colonies. The opera romanticizes his journey and his love affair with Concepción Argüello. The quotes are about him.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the final clue.**\nThe last clue states that the answer to the question \"Where is your grave?\" emerged in the late 1980s. Let's check the history of Nikolai Rezanov's burial. He died in 1807 in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, on his return journey to St. Petersburg. He was buried in the cemetery of the Voskresensky Cathedral. However, the cathedral was demolished by the Soviet regime in the 20th century, and the exact location of his grave was lost. Spurred by the immense popularity of the rock opera in the 1980s, a public campaign and historical research led to the rediscovery of the presumed grave site. A monument was placed there, effectively \"answering\" the question posed in the poem during that time frame.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll clues point directly to Nikolai Rezanov. He was the \"sailor\" from Voznesensky's poem, his grave was lost, and its location was rediscovered and publicized in the late 20th century. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
