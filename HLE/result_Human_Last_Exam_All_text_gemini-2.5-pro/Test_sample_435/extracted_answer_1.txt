It would be predicted that manufacturing CAR T cells with interleukin-15 would lead to an overall increase in sustained cytokine release upon antigen stimulation. This is because IL-15 promotes a less differentiated, memory-like T cell phenotype with superior capacity for in vivo proliferation and persistence, resulting in a larger population of effector CAR T cells that collectively produce more cytokines over time.
