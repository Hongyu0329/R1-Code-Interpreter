    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Question**\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula expresses `Z` in `e^X * e^Y = e^Z` as an infinite series of nested commutators of `X` and `Y`. The \"order\" of a term corresponds to the total number of `X`'s and `Y`'s in it.\n\n`Z = Z_1 + Z_2 + Z_3 + ...`\n\nwhere `Z_n` is the sum of all terms of order `n`. For example:\n*   `Z_1 = X + Y`\n*   `Z_2 = (1/2)[X, Y]`\n*   `Z_3 = (1/12)[X, [X, Y]] - (1/12)[Y, [X, Y]]`\n\nThe question asks for the number of \"nonzero coefficients of order 10\". This is equivalent to asking for the number of linearly independent commutators of degree 10 in two variables (`X` and `Y`). The commutators form a vector space, and the number of nonzero coefficients in a given basis is the dimension of this space.\n\n**2. Identifying the Mathematical Tool**\n\nThe set of all formal linear combinations of nested commutators of a set of generators (here, `X` and `Y`) forms a mathematical structure called a **free Lie algebra**. The terms of a specific order `n` form the `n`-th graded component of this algebra.\n\nThe dimension of the `n`-th graded component of the free Lie algebra on `k` generators is given by **Witt's formula**.\n\n**3. Witt's Formula**\n\nWitt's formula is:\n`L_n(k) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the order (or degree) of the commutators.\n*   `k` is the number of generators.\n*   The sum `Σ` is over all positive integers `d` that divide `n`.\n*   `μ(d)` is the **Möbius function**.\n\n**4. Applying the Formula to the Problem**\n\nIn our case:\n*   We are interested in order `n = 10`.\n*   The generators are `X` and `Y`, so `k = 2`.\n\nThe formula becomes:\n`L_10(2) = (1/10) * Σ_{d|10} μ(d) * 2^(10/d)`\n\n**5. Detailed Calculation**\n\nLet's break down the calculation into smaller steps.\n\n*   **Step 5.1: Find the divisors of n = 10.**\n    The positive integers `d` that divide 10 are: 1, 2, 5, 10.\n\n*   **Step 5.2: Calculate the Möbius function `μ(d)` for each divisor.**\n    The Möbius function `μ(d)` is defined as:\n    *   `μ(d) = 1` if `d` is a square-free integer with an even number of prime factors.\n    *   `μ(d) = -1` if `d` is a square-free integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n    *   `μ(d) = 0` if `d` has a squared prime factor.\n\n    For our divisors:\n    *   `μ(1) = 1` (1 has 0 prime factors, which is an even number).\n    *   `μ(2) = -1` (2 is a prime, 1 prime factor).\n    *   `μ(5) = -1` (5 is a prime, 1 prime factor).\n    *   `μ(10) = μ(2 * 5) = 1` (10 is square-free with 2 prime factors).\n\n*   **Step 5.3: Calculate the term `μ(d) * 2^(10/d)` for each divisor.**\n    *   For `d = 1`: `μ(1) * 2^(10/1) = 1 * 2^10 = 1 * 1024 = 1024`.\n    *   For `d = 2`: `μ(2) * 2^(10/2) = -1 * 2^5 = -1 * 32 = -32`.\n    *   For `d = 5`: `μ(5) * 2^(10/5) = -1 * 2^2 = -1 * 4 = -4`.\n    *   For `d = 10`: `μ(10) * 2^(10/10) = 1 * 2^1 = 1 * 2 = 2`.\n\n*   **Step 5.4: Sum the terms.**\n    `Σ = 1024 + (-32) + (-4) + 2`\n    `Σ = 1024 - 32 - 4 + 2`\n    `Σ = 990`\n\n*   **Step 5.5: Complete the calculation using Witt's formula.**\n    `L_10(2) = (1/10) * Σ`\n    `L_10(2) = (1/10) * 990`\n    `L_10(2) = 99`\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Interpretation:** The key is recognizing that \"number of nonzero coefficients\" refers to the dimension of the space of Lie polynomials of that order, not counting the actual numerical values of the coefficients themselves (which are rational numbers like 1/2, 1/12, etc.). It's a known property that for a standard basis of the free Lie algebra (like a Hall or Lyndon basis), all coefficients in the BCH expansion are non-zero.\n*   **Möbius Function:** Be careful when calculating `μ(d)`. Remember the rules for square-free integers and the number of their prime factors. For this problem, all divisors of 10 are square-free.\n*   **Arithmetic:** Double-check the powers of 2 and the final summation and division.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of linearly independent commutators of order 10, and thus the number of nonzero coefficients in the BCH expansion for that order, is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
