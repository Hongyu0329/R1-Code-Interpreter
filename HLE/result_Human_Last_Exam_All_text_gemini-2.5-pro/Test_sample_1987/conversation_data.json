    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the recursive function `f`\n\nThe function `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` is defined by three rules:\n1.  **Termination (Invalid case):** `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = 0` if `a_1 < 0` or if the sequence is not in non-decreasing order (i.e., `a_i > a_{i+1}` for some `i`). The problem states \"increasing order\", but the base case `f(0,0,...,0)=1` implies that non-decreasing order (`a_i <= a_{i+1}`) is the correct interpretation.\n2.  **Termination (Base case):** `f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 1`.\n3.  **Recursive Step:** `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = f(a_1-1, ...) + f(a_2-1, ...) + ... + f(a_n-1, ...)`.\n\nThis recurrence relation has a combinatorial interpretation. It counts the number of paths on an n-dimensional integer lattice from the point `(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` to the origin `(0, 0, ..., 0)`, where each step is a move of -1 along one of the axes (a step is of the form `-e_k`). The constraint `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n` must hold for every point on the path.\n\nThis is a classic problem in combinatorics, and its solution can be expressed by a closed-form formula, although it's not trivial to derive. By testing small cases and consulting known results for such path-counting problems (related to the Ballot Problem or Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns), we can deduce a general formula.\n\n### Step 2: Find a closed-form formula for `f`\n\nLet's test some small cases to find a pattern.\nFor `n=2`, `f(a_1, a_2)` counts paths from `(a_1, a_2)` to `(0,0)` staying in the region `x_1 <= x_2`. The formula is:\n`f(a_1, a_2) = ((a_1+a_2)! / (a_1!a_2!)) * (a_2-a_1+1) / (a_2+1)`\n\nFor `n=3`, through calculation of test cases (`f(1,1,1)=1`, `f(2,2,2)=5`, `f(1,2,3)=16`), we can deduce the formula:\n`f(a_1, a_2, a_3) = ((a_1+a_2+a_3)! / (a_1!a_2!a_3!)) * (a_2-a_1+1)/(a_2+1) * (a_3-a_2+1)/(a_3+1) * (a_3-a_1+2)/(a_3+2)`\n\nObserving the pattern, we can generalize this to `n` dimensions. The formula consists of two parts: the multinomial coefficient and a correction factor.\n`f(a_1, ..., a_n) = C(a_1+...+a_n; a_1,...,a_n) * Factor`\nwhere `C(...)` is the multinomial coefficient `(a_1+...+a_n)! / (a_1!...a_n!)`.\nThe correction factor is a product of terms:\n`Factor = [ product_{1<=i<j<=n} (a_j - a_i + j - i) ] / [ product_{1<=i<j<=n} (a_j + i) ]`\n\nThis formula holds for all the test cases we can compute manually. We will use this general formula to solve the specific questions.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate `f(2, 4, 5)`\n\nHere, `n=3`, `a_1=2`, `a_2=4`, `a_3=5`. We use the formula for `n=3`:\n1.  **Multinomial Coefficient:**\n    `C(2+4+5; 2,4,5) = 11! / (2! * 4! * 5!) = 39,916,800 / (2 * 24 * 120) = 39,916,800 / 5760 = 6930`.\n2.  **Correction Factor:**\n    *   `(a_2-a_1+1)/(a_2+1) = (4-2+1)/(4+1) = 3/5`\n    *   `(a_3-a_2+1)/(a_3+1) = (5-4+1)/(5+1) = 2/6 = 1/3`\n    *   `(a_3-a_1+2)/(a_3+2) = (5-2+2)/(5+2) = 5/7`\n3.  **Final Calculation:**\n    `f(2,4,5) = 6930 * (3/5) * (1/3) * (5/7) = 6930 * (15 / 105) = 6930 / 7 = 990`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate `f(9000, 9000, 9000)`\n\nHere, `n=3` and `a_1=a_2=a_3=a=9000`.\nUsing the same formula for `n=3`:\n1.  **Multinomial Coefficient:** `C(3a; a,a,a) = (3a)! / (a!)^3`.\n2.  **Correction Factor:**\n    *   `(a-a+1)/(a+1) = 1/(a+1)`\n    *   `(a-a+1)/(a+1) = 1/(a+1)`\n    *   `(a-a+2)/(a+2) = 2/(a+2)`\n3.  **Final Formula:**\n    `f(a,a,a) = ((3a)! / (a!)^3) * (1/(a+1)) * (1/(a+1)) * (2/(a+2)) = ((3a)! / (a!)^3) * 2 / ((a+1)^2 * (a+2))`\nSubstituting `a = 9000`:\n`f(9000,9000,9000) = (27000)! / (9000!)^3 * 2 / (9001^2 * 9002)`.\nThis number is astronomically large and cannot be computed by hand. The question asks to \"calculate the value\", and in this context, providing the exact formula is the most appropriate way to represent the value.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate `f(p, p, p, p) mod p` for prime `p = 10^9+7`\n\nLet `P = 10^9+7`. We need to calculate `f(P,P,P,P) mod P`.\nHere, `n=4` and `a_1=a_2=a_3=a_4=P`.\n1.  **General formula for `f(a,a,a,a)`:**\n    *   Multinomial: `C(4a; a,a,a,a) = (4a)! / (a!)^4`.\n    *   Numerator of factor: `product_{1<=i<j<=4} (a-a+j-i) = (1)*(2)*(1)*(3)*(2)*(1) = 12`.\n    *   Denominator of factor: `product_{1<=i<j<=4} (a+i) = (a+1) * (a+1)(a+2) * (a+1)(a+2)(a+3) = (a+1)^3(a+2)^2(a+3)`.\n    *   `f(a,a,a,a) = ((4a)! / (a!)^4) * 12 / ((a+1)^3(a+2)^2(a+3))`.\n\n2.  **Evaluate modulo P (where a=P):**\n    We need `f(P,P,P,P) mod P`.\n    *   Denominator `mod P`: `((P+1)^3(P+2)^2(P+3)) mod P = (1^3 * 2^2 * 3) mod P = 12 mod P`.\n    *   Numerator `mod P`: We need `C(4P; P,P,P,P) mod P`.\n        A known extension of Lucas's theorem states that for a prime `p`, `C(np; k_1p, ..., k_mp) = C(n; k_1, ..., k_m) mod p`.\n        Here, `p=P`, `n=4`, `(k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4)=(1,1,1,1)`.\n        `C(4P; P,P,P,P) mod P = C(4; 1,1,1,1) mod P`.\n        `C(4; 1,1,1,1) = 4! / (1!1!1!1!) = 24`.\n    *   Putting it together:\n        `f(P,P,P,P) mod P = (24 * 12) * (12^{-1} mod P)`.\n        Assuming `P` is large enough such that `12` is not a multiple of `P` (which is true for `10^9+7`), the `12` and its inverse `12^{-1}` cancel out.\n        `f(P,P,P,P) mod P = 24`.\n\nFinal answers separated by a comma.\n\n990, (27000)!/(9000!)^3 * 2/(9001^2 * 9002), 24\n\n<<<990, (27000)!/(9000!)^3 * 2/(9001^2 * 9002), 24>>>"
