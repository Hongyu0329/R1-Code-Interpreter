    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the value used to compute HRV.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Technology:** Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used. This is an optical technique common in smartwatches and fitness trackers.\n    *   **Measurement:** \"Beat-to-beat intervals\" are captured. This means the time between each consecutive heartbeat is being measured.\n    *   **Calculation:** Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is computed from a \"value between heartbeats.\"\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the name of this specific \"value between heartbeats.\"\n\n2.  **Understanding HRV:**\n    *   Heart Rate (HR) is the average number of heartbeats per minute.\n    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV), in contrast, is not an average. It is the measure of the natural variation in time *between* successive heartbeats. A healthy heart does not beat with perfect regularity; the time between beats constantly changes. HRV quantifies this variation.\n\n3.  **Connecting the Measurement to the Calculation:**\n    *   To calculate the variability (the change), you first need the raw data points.\n    *   The raw data point, as stated in the question, is the time duration between one heartbeat and the next.\n    *   For example, the time between beat 1 and beat 2 might be 850 milliseconds, between beat 2 and beat 3 might be 875 ms, and between beat 3 and beat 4 might be 840 ms. This series of time durations is the fundamental data for HRV analysis.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Correct Terminology:**\n    *   This time duration between consecutive heartbeats has a specific name.\n    *   In the context of an Electrocardiogram (ECG), the most prominent spike is the \"R-wave.\" Therefore, the time between two consecutive R-waves is called the **R-R interval**.\n    *   Since the question specifies PPG (which measures blood volume pulses, not electrical signals), a more general and widely accepted term is used. This term is the **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**. It refers to the time interval between any two consecutive beats, regardless of the sensor technology.\n    *   Sometimes, specifically for PPG, this is also called the **Peak-to-Peak Interval (PPI)**, referring to the time between the peaks of the PPG pulse waveform. However, **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)** is the most common and standard term in HRV research and applications.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **PPG vs. ECG:** While the underlying physiological event (a heartbeat) is the same, the signal and terminology can differ. R-R interval is specific to ECG. Inter-Beat Interval (IBI) is a more general term applicable to PPG and other methods.\n*   **Interval vs. Rate:** The value is a measure of *time* (usually in milliseconds), not a rate (like beats per minute). It is the interval *between* beats.\n*   **Raw Data vs. Final Metric:** The IBI is the raw data point. HRV is the statistical result *calculated from* a series of IBIs (e.g., the standard deviation of these intervals, known as SDNN). The question asks for the name of the raw data point itself.\n*   **N-N Interval:** This is a related term. It stands for \"Normal-to-Normal\" interval. It is a list of IBIs (or R-R intervals) that has been filtered to remove abnormal or ectopic beats. For most standard HRV calculations, N-N intervals are used. However, the fundamental value being measured is still the Inter-Beat Interval.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the value computed between heartbeats, which serves as the basis for HRV calculation, is called the Inter-Beat Interval (IBI).\n\n<<<Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)"
