    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Initial Analysis of the Request**\nThe core task is to solve a riddle presented in a haiku format. The title of the haiku, \"The Bays,\" is stated to be the question itself. The final answer must be presented in alphabetical order.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n1.  **The Question:** The title \"The Bays\" is a homophone. It sounds like \"The B's,\" indicating that the answer will be a set of words that start with the letter 'B'. The plural form suggests there will be more than one word.\n2.  **The Structure:** The haiku has three lines, and it is logical to assume that each line provides a clue for one of the \"B\" words.\n3.  **The Clues:** The clues are poetic and may involve wordplay, metaphors, or specific knowledge (like measurement scales).\n4.  **The Final Format:** The final answer must be a list of the discovered \"B\" words, sorted alphabetically.\n\n**Step-by-Step Riddle Analysis**\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the first line: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   A \"tempest\" is a violent, windy storm.\n    *   The line describes a powerful movement of air.\n    *   A common word for a strong gust of wind or a gale that begins with 'B' is **Blow**. This word accurately captures the essence of a tempest.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the second line: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\" is a numerical clue: 2 x 15 = 30.\n    *   This number needs to be placed in a context related to \"winds.\" The Beaufort wind scale is a scale used to measure wind speed.\n    *   A wind speed of 30 miles per hour (which falls in the 25-31 mph range) is classified on the Beaufort scale as a \"Strong **Breeze**.\"\n    *   This interpretation connects the number, the mention of \"winds,\" and a word starting with 'B'.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the third line: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   A \"divine one\" refers to a deity or a god.\n    *   The word \"yields\" means to give, grant, or produce.\n    *   The clue describes something that is given by a god. A gift, favor, or blessing from a divine source is called a **Boon**.\n    *   This word fits the poetic and slightly archaic tone of the haiku.\n\n*   **Step 4: Synthesize and Finalize the Answer**\n    *   The three \"B's\" uncovered from the haiku are: **Blow**, **Breeze**, and **Boon**.\n    *   The user's instruction is to provide the answer in alphabetical order.\n    *   Sorting these three words alphabetically results in: Blow, Boon, Breeze.\n\n<<<Blow, Boon, Breeze>>>"
