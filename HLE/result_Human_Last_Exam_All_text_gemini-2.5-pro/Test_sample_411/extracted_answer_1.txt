(a) The diversity order for each code is as follows:
-   **$\mathbf{S}_a$**: Diversity order is 1.
-   **$\mathbf{S}_b$**: Diversity order is 1.
-   **$\mathbf{S}_c$**: Diversity order is 2.

(b) The code that provides the maximum directivity is **$\mathbf{S}_c$**. This is because it achieves full diversity (order 2) and, as an Orthogonal Space-Time Block Code (OSTBC), it allows for simple linear decoding while maximizing the received signal-to-noise ratio by coherently combining the energy from both transmit antennas.
