    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 method.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Definition of A($\\alpha$)-stability**\n    A numerical method is A($\\alpha$)-stable, for $0 < \\alpha \\le \\pi/2$, if its region of absolute stability, $S$, contains the infinite angular sector $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha, z \\neq 0\\}$. The largest such $\\alpha$ is the A($\\alpha$)-stability angle of the method. Geometrically, this means the stability region $S$ must contain the cone of angle $2\\alpha$ that is symmetric about the negative real axis. The boundary of this cone consists of two rays from the origin with angles $\\pi \\pm \\alpha$. The maximum angle $\\alpha$ is found when these rays are tangent to the boundary of the stability region, $\\partial S$.\n\n2.  **Stability Function for BDF Methods**\n    The stability of a linear multistep method is analyzed by applying it to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$. This leads to a characteristic equation $\\pi(\\xi, z) = \\rho(\\xi) - z\\sigma(\\xi) = 0$, where $z = h\\lambda$. The region of absolute stability $S$ is the set of $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ for which all roots $\\xi$ of $\\pi(\\xi, z) = 0$ satisfy $|\\xi| \\le 1$.\n    The boundary of the stability region, $\\partial S$, is the set of points $z(\\theta) = \\frac{\\rho(e^{i\\theta})}{\\sigma(e^{i\\theta})}$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n\n3.  **Characteristic Polynomials for BDF4**\n    The 4-step Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF4) has the characteristic polynomials:\n    *   $\\sigma(\\xi) = \\xi^4$\n    *   $\\rho(\\xi) = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\frac{1}{j}\\xi^{4-j}(\\xi-1)^j = \\frac{25}{12}\\xi^4 - 4\\xi^3 + 3\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi + \\frac{1}{4}$\n\n4.  **Finding the Tangency Points**\n    The angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the rays from the origin that are tangent to the boundary curve $\\partial S$. The point of tangency, $z_0$, corresponds to a point where the argument of $z(\\theta)$ is at an extremum. A more advanced result from stability theory states that these points of tangency $z_0$ are the images of the critical points of the function $z(\\xi) = \\rho(\\xi)/\\sigma(\\xi)$. The critical points $\\xi$ are the solutions to $z'(\\xi) = 0$.\n    $z'(\\xi) = \\frac{\\rho'(\\xi)\\sigma(\\xi) - \\rho(\\xi)\\sigma'(\\xi)}{[\\sigma(\\xi)]^2} = 0$\n    This simplifies to solving $\\rho'(\\xi)\\sigma(\\xi) - \\rho(\\xi)\\sigma'(\\xi) = 0$.\n\n5.  **Solving for the Critical Points $\\xi$**\n    First, we find the derivatives of the polynomials:\n    *   $\\rho'(\\xi) = \\frac{d}{d\\xi}\\left(\\frac{25}{12}\\xi^4 - 4\\xi^3 + 3\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{25}{3}\\xi^3 - 12\\xi^2 + 6\\xi - \\frac{4}{3}$\n    *   $\\sigma'(\\xi) = \\frac{d}{d\\xi}(\\xi^4) = 4\\xi^3$\n\n    Now, we set up and solve the equation $\\rho'(\\xi)\\sigma(\\xi) - \\rho(\\xi)\\sigma'(\\xi) = 0$:\n    $(\\frac{25}{3}\\xi^3 - 12\\xi^2 + 6\\xi - \\frac{4}{3})\\xi^4 - (\\frac{25}{12}\\xi^4 - 4\\xi^3 + 3\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi + \\frac{1}{4})(4\\xi^3) = 0$\n    Assuming $\\xi \\neq 0$, we can divide by $\\xi^3$:\n    $(\\frac{25}{3}\\xi^4 - 12\\xi^3 + 6\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi) - 4(\\frac{25}{12}\\xi^4 - 4\\xi^3 + 3\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi + \\frac{1}{4}) = 0$\n    $(\\frac{25}{3}\\xi^4 - 12\\xi^3 + 6\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi) - (\\frac{25}{3}\\xi^4 - 16\\xi^3 + 12\\xi^2 - \\frac{16}{3}\\xi + 1) = 0$\n    Combine like terms:\n    $(\\frac{25}{3}-\\frac{25}{3})\\xi^4 + (-12+16)\\xi^3 + (6-12)\\xi^2 + (-\\frac{4}{3}+\\frac{16}{3})\\xi - 1 = 0$\n    $4\\xi^3 - 6\\xi^2 + 4\\xi - 1 = 0$\n\n6.  **Finding the Roots of the Cubic Equation**\n    We can solve $4\\xi^3 - 6\\xi^2 + 4\\xi - 1 = 0$ by testing for rational roots $p/q$. A root is found at $\\xi = 1/2$.\n    Using polynomial division, we get:\n    $(2\\xi - 1)(2\\xi^2 - 2\\xi + 1) = 0$\n    The quadratic factor gives the remaining roots:\n    $\\xi = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 4(2)(1)}}{4} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{-4}}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{1}{2}i$\n    The critical points are $\\xi_1 = 1/2$, $\\xi_2 = \\frac{1+i}{2}$, and $\\xi_3 = \\frac{1-i}{2}$.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Tangency Point $z_0$**\n    We now compute the corresponding point $z_0$ on the stability boundary. We only need to consider one of the complex conjugate roots, for instance $\\xi = \\frac{1+i}{2}$, which will give the tangency point in the upper half-plane.\n    $z_0 = \\frac{\\rho(\\xi)}{\\sigma(\\xi)} = \\frac{\\frac{25}{12}\\xi^4 - 4\\xi^3 + 3\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi + \\frac{1}{4}}{\\xi^4}$\n    Let's compute the powers of $\\xi = \\frac{1+i}{2}$:\n    *   $\\xi^2 = \\left(\\frac{1+i}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1+2i-1}{4} = \\frac{i}{2}$\n    *   $\\xi^3 = \\xi \\cdot \\xi^2 = \\frac{1+i}{2} \\cdot \\frac{i}{2} = \\frac{i-1}{4}$\n    *   $\\xi^4 = (\\xi^2)^2 = \\left(\\frac{i}{2}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{1}{4}$\n    Now substitute these into the expression for $\\rho(\\xi)$:\n    $\\rho(\\xi) = \\frac{25}{12}(-\\frac{1}{4}) - 4(\\frac{-1+i}{4}) + 3(\\frac{i}{2}) - \\frac{4}{3}(\\frac{1+i}{2}) + \\frac{1}{4}$\n    $= -\\frac{25}{48} - (-1+i) + \\frac{3i}{2} - \\frac{2(1+i)}{3} + \\frac{1}{4}$\n    $= (-\\frac{25}{48} + 1 - \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{4}) + i(-1 + \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{2}{3})$\n    $= (\\frac{-25 + 48 - 32 + 12}{48}) + i(\\frac{-6 + 9 - 4}{6})$\n    $= \\frac{3}{48} - i\\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{16} - i\\frac{1}{6}$\n    Finally, calculate $z_0$:\n    $z_0 = \\frac{\\rho(\\xi)}{\\xi^4} = \\frac{1/16 - i/6}{-1/4} = -4\\left(\\frac{1}{16} - i\\frac{1}{6}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{4} + i\\frac{4}{6} = -\\frac{1}{4} + i\\frac{2}{3}$\n\n8.  **Determining the Angle $\\alpha$**\n    The tangency point in the upper half-plane is $z_0 = -1/4 + i(2/3)$. This point lies on a ray from the origin that forms the boundary of the stability cone. The angle of this ray is $\\arg(z_0)$.\n    From the definition of A($\\alpha$)-stability, the boundary ray in the upper half-plane has an angle of $\\pi-\\alpha$.\n    Therefore, $\\arg(z_0) = \\pi - \\alpha$.\n    We can find $\\tan(\\arg(z_0))$:\n    $\\tan(\\arg(z_0)) = \\frac{\\text{Im}(z_0)}{\\text{Re}(z_0)} = \\frac{2/3}{-1/4} = -\\frac{8}{3}$\n    Now we relate this to $\\alpha$:\n    $\\tan(\\pi - \\alpha) = -\\tan(\\alpha)$\n    So, $-\\frac{8}{3} = -\\tan(\\alpha)$, which implies $\\tan(\\alpha) = \\frac{8}{3}$.\n    The exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ is given by:\n    $\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{8}{3}\\right)$\n\n<<<arctan(8/3)>>>"
