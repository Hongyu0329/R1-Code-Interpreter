    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Premise:** The question asks for a hypothetical Modern English word. The core condition is the absence of the Norse (Viking) invasions and their linguistic interaction with the Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries. This means we must remove the influence of Old Norse on the development of the English language.\n\n2.  **Examine the Etymology of the Current Word \"Sister\":**\n    *   The Modern English word \"sister\" comes from the Middle English word *sister* or *suster*.\n    *   These Middle English forms have two distinct origins. The form *sister* is a borrowing from, or heavily influenced by, the Old Norse word *systir*. The two words were cognates (descended from the same Proto-Germanic root, **swestēr*), but the phonetic form of our modern word clearly follows the Norse path.\n    *   The native Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for \"sister\" was **sweostor**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Impact of Norse Influence:**\n    *   In areas of England with heavy Norse settlement (the Danelaw), the Old Norse *systir* and the Old English *sweostor* would have been used side-by-side.\n    *   Because they were so similar in meaning and sound, they competed.\n    *   The phonetically simpler Norse form *systir* eventually won out and became the standard form in English, replacing the native cognate.\n    *   Therefore, the very existence of the word \"sister\" in its current form is a direct result of the Norse interaction.\n\n4.  **Hypothesize the Development Without Norse Influence:**\n    *   If the Norse had never invaded, the Old English word **sweostor** would have continued its natural evolution into Middle and then Modern English.\n    *   We must trace the likely sound changes that would have occurred to *sweostor*.\n\n5.  **Trace the Phonological Development of *sweostor*:**\n    *   **Old English:** *sweostor* [ˈswe͜o.stor]\n    *   **Middle English:** In Middle English, the Old English *sweostor* developed along two main lines, primarily in dialects that were less affected by Norse influence (the South and West).\n        *   **Path A:** The initial diphthong *eo* could change to *e*. This is seen in words like Old English *heofon* -> Middle English *heven* (Modern \"heaven\"). This path would yield **swester**.\n        *   **Path B:** The vowel could shift to *u*, and the initial /w/ after /s/ could be dropped (a common change, seen in Old English *swā* -> Modern \"so\"). This path would yield **suster**.\n    *   Both *swester* and *suster* were common forms in Middle English. For example, Geoffrey Chaucer used the form *suster*.\n\n6.  **Determine the Most Likely Modern Form:**\n    *   Between *swester* and *suster*, the form *suster* was more widespread in the southern dialects of Middle English, which ultimately had a greater influence on the formation of Standard Modern English than northern dialects (where Norse influence was strongest).\n    *   We can also look at related West Germanic languages that did not have the same Norse influence. The Dutch word for sister is *zuster*, which is a very close parallel to the hypothetical development of *suster*. The German word is *Schwester*, which parallels the *swester* form.\n    *   Given its prevalence in the influential southern dialects of Middle English and the parallel with Dutch, **suster** is the most probable form that would have survived into Modern English.\n    *   The pronunciation would likely be /ˈsʌstər/, rhyming with \"custom\".\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Cognate vs. Loanword:** \"Sister\" is a nuanced case. It's not a simple loanword for a new concept; instead, a Norse cognate *replaced* a native English cognate. This is a common result of language contact between closely related languages.\n2.  **Dialectal Variation:** Middle English was not a single, uniform language. The forms *sister*, *suster*, and *swester* all coexisted in different regions. The question requires us to predict which non-Norse form would have likely become the \"standard.\"\n3.  **Uncertainty of Hypotheticals:** Linguistic prediction is not an exact science. However, by following known sound laws and historical dialectal evidence, we can arrive at a highly probable answer. The path from Old English *sweostor* to a hypothetical Modern English *suster* is a well-supported and regular linguistic development.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWithout the influence from the Old Norse *systir*, the native Old English word *sweostor* would have naturally evolved. Its most common form in the influential dialects of Middle English was *suster*. This form would have likely continued into Modern English.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
