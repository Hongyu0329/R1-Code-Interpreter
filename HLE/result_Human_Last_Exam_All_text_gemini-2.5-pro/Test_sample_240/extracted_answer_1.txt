The primary reason a functional MRI coil might not show resonance when probed with a VNA is the presence of an active detuning circuit. This safety feature uses PIN diodes to make the coil non-resonant when it is not being actively controlled by the MRI scanner, in order to protect it from the high-power transmit pulse. When the coil is on the bench and unpowered, it is in this default "detuned" state. A secondary reason could be the coil's geometry, such as a gradiometer design (e.g., figure-8), which is built to reject the uniform magnetic field generated by the VNA probe and only respond to field gradients.
