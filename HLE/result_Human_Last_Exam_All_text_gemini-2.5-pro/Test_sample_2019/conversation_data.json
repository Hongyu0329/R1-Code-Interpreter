    "Answering the question step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe goal is to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid where the edges wrap around. This means calculations for position are done modulo 5. For a square at `(r, c)`, `r` is the row index (0 to 4) and `c` is the column index (0 to 4).\n*   **Queens:** We are placing 4 queens. In combinatorial problems like this, the pieces are assumed to be identical unless stated otherwise. We are counting distinct sets of 4 squares.\n*   **Non-attacking:** No two queens can threaten each other. On a toroidal board, a queen at `(r, c)` attacks:\n    1.  All other squares in the same row `r`.\n    2.  All other squares in the same column `c`.\n    3.  All other squares on the two \"diagonals\". On a toroidal board, the diagonals are defined by squares `(r', c')` such that:\n        *   `r - c = r' - c' (mod 5)` (main diagonals)\n        *   `r + c = r' + c' (mod 5)` (anti-diagonals)\n\n### Step 2: Formulating the Constraints\nLet the positions of the four queens be `(r1, c1)`, `(r2, c2)`, `(r3, c3)`, and `(r4, c4)`. The non-attacking condition means that for any two distinct queens `i` and `j`:\n1.  `ri ≠ rj`\n2.  `ci ≠ cj`\n3.  `ri - ci ≠ rj - cj (mod 5)`\n4.  `ri + ci ≠ rj + cj (mod 5)`\n\nFrom constraints 1 and 2, the four queens must be in four different rows and four different columns. This means that exactly one row and one column on the 5x5 board will be empty.\n\n### Step 3: A Structured Counting Approach\nWe can count the arrangements by first choosing the empty row and column, and then counting the valid placements within the remaining subgrid.\n\n1.  **Choose the empty row and column:**\n    *   There are 5 choices for the row that will contain no queens. Let's call this the empty row, `r_e`.\n    *   There are 5 choices for the column that will contain no queens. Let's call this the empty column, `c_e`.\n    *   This gives `5 * 5 = 25` ways to choose the 4x4 subgrid on which the queens will be placed.\n\n2.  **Count placements on a chosen subgrid:**\n    Let's fix the set of 4 rows `R` and 4 columns `C` for the queens. A placement is a bijection (a one-to-one mapping) `p: R -> C`, where the queen in row `r` is placed in column `p(r)`. The set of queen positions is `{(r, p(r)) | r ∈ R}`.\n\n    We need to find the number of such bijections `p` that satisfy the diagonal constraints:\n    *   The set of main diagonal indices, `{r - p(r) (mod 5) | r ∈ R}`, must contain 4 distinct values.\n    *   The set of anti-diagonal indices, `{r + p(r) (mod 5) | r ∈ R}`, must contain 4 distinct values.\n\n### Step 4: Using Symmetry to Simplify the Count\nLet `N(r_e, c_e)` be the number of valid placements when row `r_e` and column `c_e` are empty. The total number of ways is the sum of `N(r_e, c_e)` over all 25 possible pairs of `(r_e, c_e)`.\n\nThe toroidal board is highly symmetric. Specifically, we can translate the board by any vector `(a, b)` without changing its structure. A translation maps a solution for `(r_e, c_e)` to a solution for `(r_e+a, c_e+b) mod 5`. This means that the number of solutions `N(r_e, c_e)` is the same for all pairs `(r_e, c_e)`. Let this constant number be `k`.\n\nTotal ways = `25 * k`.\n\nTo find `k`, we can calculate it for the simplest case. Let's choose the empty row `r_e = 4` and the empty column `c_e = 4`.\nThis means our queens are on rows `R = {0, 1, 2, 3}` and columns `C = {0, 1, 2, 3}`. A placement is defined by a permutation `p` of `{0, 1, 2, 3}`. The queen positions are `(i, p(i))` for `i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating `k`\nFor `R = {0,1,2,3}` and `C = {0,1,2,3}`:\n*   The set of main diagonal indices is `D = {i - p(i) (mod 5) | i ∈ {0,1,2,3}}`.\n*   The set of anti-diagonal indices is `S = {i + p(i) (mod 5) | i ∈ {0,1,2,3}}`.\n\nWe can analyze the sum of the elements in these sets (modulo 5). Since `p` is a permutation of `{0,1,2,3}`, `sum(i) = sum(p(i)) = 0+1+2+3 = 6`.\n*   `sum(D) = sum(i - p(i)) = sum(i) - sum(p(i)) = 6 - 6 = 0 (mod 5)`.\n*   `sum(S) = sum(i + p(i)) = sum(i) + sum(p(i)) = 6 + 6 = 12 = 2 (mod 5)`.\n\nNow we check which 4-element subsets of `{0,1,2,3,4}` have these sums:\n*   Subsets with sum 0 (mod 5): Only `{1,2,3,4}` (sum=10). So, `D` must be `{1,2,3,4}`.\n*   Subsets with sum 2 (mod 5): Only `{0,1,2,4}` (sum=7). So, `S` must be `{0,1,2,4}`.\n\nSo, we are looking for permutations `p` of `{0,1,2,3}` such that:\n*   `{i - p(i) (mod 5)} = {1,2,3,4}`\n*   `{i + p(i) (mod 5)} = {0,1,2,4}`\n\nLet's test the 24 possible permutations. A more efficient way is to build the permutation step by step with these constraints.\nThis analysis (as detailed in the thought process) reveals there are exactly two such permutations:\n1.  `p1 = (1, 3, 0, 2)`. This corresponds to the queen positions `{(0,1), (1,3), (2,0), (3,2)}`.\n    *   `D = {0-1, 1-3, 2-0, 3-2} (mod 5) = {-1, -2, 2, 1} = {4, 3, 2, 1}`. Correct.\n    *   `S = {0+1, 1+3, 2+0, 3+2} (mod 5) = {1, 4, 2, 0}`. Correct.\n2.  `p2 = (2, 0, 3, 1)`. This corresponds to the queen positions `{(0,2), (1,0), (2,3), (3,1)}`.\n    *   `D = {0-2, 1-0, 2-3, 3-1} (mod 5) = {-2, 1, -1, 2} = {3, 1, 4, 2}`. Correct.\n    *   `S = {0+2, 1+0, 2+3, 3+1} (mod 5) = {2, 1, 0, 4}`. Correct.\n\nSo, for the case `(r_e, c_e) = (4, 4)`, there are `k=2` solutions.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\nSince `N(r_e, c_e) = k = 2` for all 25 choices of `(r_e, c_e)`, the total number of ways to place the 4 non-attacking queens is:\n\nTotal ways = (Number of choices for `(r_e, c_e)`) * (Number of solutions for each choice)\nTotal ways = `25 * k`\nTotal ways = `25 * 2 = 50`.\n\n<<<50>>>"
