The appropriate management involves a phased approach, starting with immediate medical referral to control her diabetes and urgent dental care including wound irrigation, antibiotics, and pain management. After medical stabilization and a healing period, the most suitable prosthetic replacement is a **Cobalt-Chromium framework Removable Partial Denture**. The key cells of interest, whose functions are impaired by her uncontrolled diabetes, are **neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts, and osteoblasts**, leading to high infection risk and poor healing. For the denture, the primary abutment teeth would be the **left second premolar** and **left central incisor**. To ensure stability and prevent damaging rotational forces, the design must include **cross-arch stabilization**, utilizing the **right canine and right first premolar** as additional abutments.
