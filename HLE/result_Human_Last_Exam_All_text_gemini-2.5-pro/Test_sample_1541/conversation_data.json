    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the memory usage of the most memory-efficient C program.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Question\nThe problem asks us to take a string representing a sum of numbers, for example, `3+2+1+1`, and reorder the numbers to be in non-decreasing order, producing `1+1+2+3`. The key constraints and details are:\n*   **Input**: A string containing single-digit numbers separated by `+`.\n*   **Numbers**: The numbers in the sum are only 1, 2, and 3.\n*   **Output**: A string representing the new sum with numbers sorted.\n*   **Primary Goal**: The solution must be implemented in C and be as memory-efficient as possible.\n*   **Final Task**: Calculate `m`, the total memory in bytes used for the variables in this optimal program.\n\n### 2. Careful Points\nTo design the most memory-efficient solution, we must pay close attention to the following:\n\n*   **Algorithm Choice**: The numbers are from a very small, fixed set ({1, 2, 3}). This strongly suggests that a counting sort approach will be far more efficient (in both time and memory) than a general-purpose sorting algorithm like quicksort or mergesort.\n*   **Input Handling**: The input string can be up to 1000 characters long. Storing this entire string in a character array (e.g., `char s[1001];`) would immediately consume over 1000 bytes. A more memory-efficient approach is to process the input stream character by character without storing the whole string.\n*   **Data Type Selection**: To minimize memory, we must select the smallest possible C data type for each variable that can still hold the required range of values. For example, using `char` or `short` instead of `int` where possible.\n*   **Variable Minimization**: We should only declare variables that are absolutely necessary for the logic to function.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Final Answer\n\nFollowing the principle of maximum memory efficiency, we will design the program and calculate the memory used by its variables.\n\n**Step 1: Choose the Algorithm**\nWe will use a counting sort. We need to count the occurrences of the numbers '1', '2', and '3'.\n\n**Step 2: Plan the Input/Output without Large Buffers**\nWe will read the input one character at a time using a function like `getchar()`. This avoids allocating a large array for the input string. Similarly, we will construct and print the output piece by piece using `putchar()` or `printf()`, avoiding the creation of a large output string in memory.\n\n**Step 3: Select Variables and their Optimal Data Types**\nLet's identify the necessary variables and choose the smallest suitable C data types. We assume a standard environment where `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte, `sizeof(short)` is 2 bytes, and `sizeof(bool)` is 1 byte.\n\n1.  **Counters for numbers**: We need to count how many '1's, '2's, and '3's are in the input. The input string length is at most 1000, so the maximum number of terms is `(999+1)/2 = 500`. A `short` integer type (range: -32,768 to 32,767) is sufficient to store a count up to 500. We need three such counters. An array is a clean way to store them.\n    *   Variable: `short counts[3];`\n    *   Memory: `3 * sizeof(short)` = `3 * 2` = **6 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Character for input**: We need a variable to hold each character as we read it from the input stream. A `char` is perfect for this.\n    *   Variable: `char c;`\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n3.  **Flag for printing '+'**: When printing the output `1+1+2+3`, we need to place `+` signs between the numbers but not before the first one. A boolean flag is a good way to track whether we are printing the very first term.\n    *   Variable: `bool is_first;` (using `<stdbool.h>`)\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(bool)` = **1 byte**.\n\n4.  **Loop counters**:\n    *   An outer loop will iterate through our counts for numbers 1, 2, and 3. Its index will go from 0 to 2. A `char` is sufficient to hold this value.\n        *   Variable: `char i;`\n        *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n    *   An inner loop will run as many times as the count of each number. As established, this count can be up to 500. A `short` is required for this counter.\n        *   Variable: `short j;`\n        *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(short)` = **2 bytes**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Total Memory (`m`)**\nNow, we sum the memory usage of all the declared variables:\n*   `counts` array: 6 bytes\n*   `c` character: 1 byte\n*   `is_first` flag: 1 byte\n*   `i` loop counter: 1 byte\n*   `j` loop counter: 2 bytes\n\nTotal Memory `m` = 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 11 bytes.\n\nThis represents the total memory allocated on the stack for the local variables in the most memory-efficient C implementation of the solution.\n\n<<<11>>>"
