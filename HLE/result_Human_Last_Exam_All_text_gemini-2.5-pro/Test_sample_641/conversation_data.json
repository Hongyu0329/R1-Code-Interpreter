    "An involution in a group is an element of order 2. We want to find the number of elements $x$ in the projective special unitary group $G = \\text{PSU}(4, 997)$ such that $x^2 = 1$ and $x \\neq 1$.\n\n**Step 1: Relate involutions in PSU(n,q) to elements in SU(n,q)**\nThe group $\\text{PSU}(n, q)$ is the quotient group $\\text{SU}(n, q) / Z(\\text{SU}(n, q))$, where $\\text{SU}(n, q)$ is the special unitary group and $Z(\\text{SU}(n, q))$ is its center. Let $\\pi: \\text{SU}(n, q) \\to \\text{PSU}(n, q)$ be the natural projection that maps an element $A$ to its coset $A Z$.\n\nAn element $x = A Z$ in $\\text{PSU}(n, q)$ is an involution if and only if:\n1.  $x \\neq 1_G$, which means $A \\notin Z(\\text{SU}(n, q))$.\n2.  $x^2 = 1_G$, which means $(AZ)^2 = A^2 Z = Z$. This implies $A^2 \\in Z(\\text{SU}(n, q))$.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of elements $A \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$ such that $A$ is not in the center and $A^2$ is in the center. Then, since each such element $A$ and its inverse image partners in the same coset map to the same involution in PSU, we divide this count by the order of the center.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the center of SU(4, 997)**\nThe center of $\\text{SU}(n, q)$ consists of scalar matrices $\\lambda I$ such that $\\lambda^n = 1$ and $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$. The order of the center is $d = \\gcd(n, q+1)$.\nIn our case, $n=4$ and $q=997$.\nSo, $d = \\gcd(4, 997+1) = \\gcd(4, 998)$.\nSince $998 = 2 \\times 499$ and $4=2^2$, we have $\\gcd(4, 998) = 2$.\nThus, the center $Z(\\text{SU}(4, 997))$ has order 2. The elements are scalar matrices $\\lambda I$ with $\\lambda^2=1$. Since the characteristic is not 2, the solutions are $\\lambda=1$ and $\\lambda=-1$.\nSo, $Z(\\text{SU}(4, 997)) = \\{I, -I\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Count the preimages of involutions in SU(4, 997)**\nWe are looking for the number of matrices $A \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$ such that:\n1.  $A \\neq I$ and $A \\neq -I$.\n2.  $A^2 = I$ or $A^2 = -I$.\n\nLet's analyze these two possibilities for $A^2$.\n\n**Case 1: $A^2 = -I$**\nIf $A \\in \\text{U}(n, q)$ and $v$ is an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda$, then $\\lambda$ must satisfy the condition $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$.\nIf $A^2 = -I$, then the minimal polynomial of $A$ must divide $x^2+1$, so its eigenvalues must be roots of $x^2=-1$.\nThis means any eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $A$ must satisfy both $\\lambda^2 = -1$ and $\\lambda^{q+1} = 1$.\nFrom $\\lambda^2=-1$, we get $\\lambda^4=1$. So $\\lambda$ must satisfy $\\lambda^{\\gcd(4, q+1)}=1$.\nFor $q=997$, we have $\\gcd(4, 997+1)=\\gcd(4, 998)=2$.\nSo, we need $\\lambda^2=1$.\nBut we also need $\\lambda^2=-1$. This would imply $1 = -1$, or $2=0$, which is impossible in a field of characteristic 997.\nTherefore, there are no eigenvalues that can satisfy both conditions. Since any matrix in $\\text{U}(n,q)$ is diagonalizable over the field $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, it must have eigenvalues. The lack of possible eigenvalues means that there are no matrices $A \\in \\text{U}(4, 997)$ such that $A^2=-I$. Consequently, there are no such matrices in the subgroup $\\text{SU}(4, 997)$.\n\nThis is a general result: for $q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, there are no elements $A \\in U(n,q)$ with $A^2=-I$. Here $997 = 4 \\times 249 + 1$, so $997 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\n\n**Case 2: $A^2 = I$**\nThis means $A$ is an involution in $\\text{SU}(4, 997)$.\nSince $A$ is diagonalizable, its eigenvalues must be $1$ or $-1$.\nLet $k$ be the multiplicity of the eigenvalue $-1$. The multiplicity of the eigenvalue $1$ is $4-k$.\nThe determinant of $A$ is $\\det(A) = (1)^{4-k}(-1)^k = (-1)^k$.\nSince $A \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$, we must have $\\det(A)=1$. This implies $k$ must be even.\nPossible values for $k$ are $0, 2, 4$.\n*   If $k=0$, all eigenvalues are 1. Since $A$ is diagonalizable, $A=I$. This is in the center.\n*   If $k=4$, all eigenvalues are -1. Then $A=-I$. This is also in the center.\n*   If $k=2$, the eigenvalues are $(1, 1, -1, -1)$. Such a matrix is not $I$ or $-I$, so it is not in the center.\n\nWe need to count the number of matrices $A$ in this last category. These are precisely the elements we are looking for: $A^2=I$ and $A \\notin Z(\\text{SU}(4, 997))$.\nThese elements form a single conjugacy class in $\\text{SU}(4, 997)$, represented by the diagonal matrix $J = \\text{diag}(1, 1, -1, -1)$.\nThe number of such elements is the size of the conjugacy class of $J$. This is given by the formula:\n$N_k = \\frac{|\\text{U}(n,q)|}{|\\text{U}(k,q)||\\text{U}(n-k,q)|}$ for the corresponding class in $\\text{U}(n,q)$.\nFor $n=4, k=2$, this is $\\frac{|\\text{U}(4,q)|}{|\\text{U}(2,q)|^2}$.\nUsing the formula for the order of the unitary group $|\\text{U}(m, q)| = q^{m(m-1)/2} \\prod_{i=1}^m (q^i - (-1)^i)$:\n$|\\text{U}(2,q)| = q(q+1)(q^2-1)$\n$|\\text{U}(4,q)| = q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)$\nThe number of such matrices is:\n$N_2 = \\frac{q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{(q(q+1)(q^2-1))^2} = \\frac{q^4(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{(q+1)(q^2-1)}$\n$= \\frac{q^4(q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2-1)(q^2+1)}{(q+1)(q^2-1)} = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\nAll these matrices have determinant 1, so they are in $\\text{SU}(4,q)$. The conjugacy class in $\\text{U}(4,q)$ does not split upon restriction to $\\text{SU}(4,q)$. So this is also the number of such elements in $\\text{SU}(4,q)$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997)**\nThe set of preimages of involutions consists solely of the $N_2$ elements of type $k=2$. Let's call this set $S$.\n$|S| = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\nThe number of involutions in $\\text{PSU}(4, q)$ is the number of these preimages divided by the order of the center, $|Z|=2$.\nNumber of involutions = $\\frac{|S|}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n\n**Step 5: Substitute q=997 and compute the final answer**\nWe need to calculate this value for $q=997$.\nNumber of involutions = $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 997^4 \\cdot (997^2 - 997 + 1) \\cdot (997^2 + 1)$.\n*   $997^2 = 994009$.\n*   $997^4 = (994009)^2 = 988053892081$.\n*   $997^2 - 997 + 1 = 994009 - 997 + 1 = 993013$.\n*   $997^2 + 1 = 994009 + 1 = 994010$.\n\nNumber of involutions = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 988053892081 \\times 993013 \\times 994010$\n$= 988053892081 \\times 993013 \\times \\frac{994010}{2}$\n$= 988053892081 \\times 993013 \\times 497005$\n$= 988053892081 \\times (993013 \\times 497005)$\n$= 988053892081 \\times 493540348565$\n$= 487561338118333313218565$."
