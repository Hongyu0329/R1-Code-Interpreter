    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question and Defining Terms\n\nFirst, let's break down the components of the question to ensure we understand all the terminology.\n\n*   **Upper Semilattice ($J$)**: An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) $(J, \\leq)$ in which every pair of elements has a least upper bound (or join). For any $j_1, j_2 \\in J$, there exists an element $j_1 \\vee j_2 \\in J$ such that $j_1 \\leq j_1 \\vee j_2$, $j_2 \\leq j_1 \\vee j_2$, and for any $k \\in J$ with $j_1 \\leq k$ and $j_2 \\leq k$, we have $j_1 \\vee j_2 \\leq k$.\n*   **Category Theory Perspective**: Any poset $(J, \\leq)$ can be viewed as a category. The objects of the category are the elements of $J$. For any two objects $j, k \\in J$, there is a unique morphism from $j$ to $k$ if and only if $j \\leq k$. Otherwise, there are no morphisms from $j$ to $k$.\n*   **Functor ($f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$)**: A functor from the category $J$ to the category of vector spaces over a field $K$, denoted $\\text{Vect}_K$. This means:\n    1.  For each object $j \\in J$, we have a vector space $f(j)$.\n    2.  For each morphism $j \\to k$ (i.e., for each relation $j \\leq k$), we have a linear map $f_{j,k}: f(j) \\to f(k)$.\n    3.  These maps respect composition: if $j \\leq k \\leq l$, then $f_{j,l} = f_{k,l} \\circ f_{j,k}$. Also, $f_{j,j}$ is the identity map on $f(j)$.\n    These functors are also known as **persistence modules** indexed by the poset $J$.\n*   **Tame Functor**: A functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is called **tame** if for every pair of elements $j_1, j_2 \\in J$, the canonical map $\\phi: f(j_1) \\oplus f(j_2) \\to f(j_1 \\vee j_2)$ is surjective. This map is defined by $\\phi(v_1, v_2) = f_{j_1, j_1 \\vee j_2}(v_1) + f_{j_2, j_1 \\vee j_2}(v_2)$.\n*   **$n$-resolvable**: A functor $f$ is said to be $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. This is equivalent to saying that the **projective dimension** of $f$ is at most $n$, denoted $\\text{pd}(f) \\leq n$. The projective dimension of an object $M$ in an abelian category is the smallest integer $n \\geq 0$ such that there exists an exact sequence $0 \\to P_n \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to M \\to 0$ where all $P_i$ are projective objects. If no such finite resolution exists, the projective dimension is infinite.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest integer $n$ such that *every* tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is $n$-resolvable.\n\n### Step 2: Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **The Category of Functors**: We are working in the abelian category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$. The objects are functors from $J$ to $\\text{Vect}_K$, and morphisms are natural transformations.\n2.  **Projective Objects**: We need to know what the projective objects are in $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$. It is a standard result that the projective objects are precisely the direct summands of direct sums of **representable functors**. For each $j \\in J$, the representable functor $P_j$ is defined as $P_j(k) = K[\\text{Hom}_J(j,k)]$, which in our poset setting means $P_j(k) = K$ if $j \\leq k$ and $P_j(k) = \\{0\\}$ otherwise.\n3.  **Homological Algebra Connection**: The projective dimension of a functor $f$ is characterized by Ext groups. Specifically, $\\text{pd}(f) \\leq n$ if and only if $\\text{Ext}^{n+1}(f, g) = 0$ for all functors $g$. By a standard result in homological algebra (dimension shifting), this is equivalent to $\\text{Ext}^{n+1}(S_k, f) = 0$ for all \"simple\" functors $S_k$ (where $S_k(k)=K$ and $S_k(j)=0$ for $j \\neq k$). In fact, due to the properties of this specific category, it is equivalent to $\\text{Ext}^{2}(S_k, f) = 0$ for all $k \\in J$ implying $\\text{pd}(f) \\leq 1$.\n4.  **Tame condition's role**: The \"tame\" property is a local condition on the functor. We must understand how this local condition translates into a global homological property, i.e., a bound on the projective dimension.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to connect the definition of a tame functor to its projective dimension.\n\n1.  **The Goal**: We want to find the smallest $n$ such that for any tame functor $f$, $\\text{pd}(f) \\leq n$. This is equivalent to finding the smallest $n$ such that $\\text{Ext}^{n+1}(g, f) = 0$ for all functors $g$.\n\n2.  **Relating \"Tame\" to Ext groups**: The theory of persistence modules on posets provides a way to compute Ext groups using the nerve of the poset. For any $k \\in J$, $\\text{Ext}^i(S_k, f)$ is isomorphic to the reduced homology $\\tilde{H}_{i-1}(J_{<k}, f)$, where $J_{<k} = \\{j \\in J \\mid j < k\\}$ is the subposet of elements strictly smaller than $k$, and the homology is taken with coefficients twisted by the functor $f$.\n\n3.  **Analyzing $\\text{Ext}^2(S_k, f)$**: Based on the above isomorphism, $\\text{Ext}^2(S_k, f) \\cong \\tilde{H}_1(J_{<k}, f)$. We need to understand what this homology group represents. The 1-homology group $\\tilde{H}_1$ measures \"cycles\" or \"holes\" in the topological realization of the poset $J_{<k}$. A generator for $H_1$ typically arises from a situation where we have two elements $j_1, j_2 < k$ that are \"incomparable\" but have a common upper bound below $k$.\n\n4.  **How \"Tame\" Affects Homology**: Let's consider a minimal potential source of a 1-cycle in $J_{<k}$. This would involve two elements $j_1, j_2 < k$ and their join $j_1 \\vee j_2$. If $j_1 \\vee j_2 < k$, the tameness condition for the pair $(j_1, j_2)$ states that the map $f(j_1) \\oplus f(j_2) \\to f(j_1 \\vee j_2)$ is surjective. This surjectivity is precisely the condition needed to ensure that the corresponding chain complex (used to compute the homology) is exact at that position. This means the cycle is \"filled in\", and the homology group vanishes. More formally, the tameness condition at all pairs $(j_1, j_2)$ implies that $\\tilde{H}_1(J_{<k}, f) = 0$ for all $k \\in J$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion from Homology**: Since the tame condition implies $\\tilde{H}_1(J_{<k}, f) = 0$ for all $k$, we have $\\text{Ext}^2(S_k, f) = 0$ for all simple functors $S_k$. As mentioned earlier, this is a sufficient condition to conclude that $\\text{pd}(f) \\leq 1$. This means that any tame functor is **1-resolvable**.\n\n6.  **Is $n=0$ possible?**: Could the projective dimension be 0 for all tame functors? A functor has projective dimension 0 if and only if it is a projective object itself. Projective objects are direct sums of representable functors $P_j$.\n    Let's find a counterexample: a tame functor that is not projective.\n    *   Consider the simplest non-trivial poset: $J = \\{a, b\\}$ with $a < b$. This is an upper semilattice.\n    *   Let's define a functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ by $f(a) = \\{0\\}$ and $f(b) = K$. The only non-trivial map is $f_{a,b}: f(a) \\to f(b)$, which must be the zero map $0 \\to K$. This functor is often called the simple functor $S_b$.\n    *   Is $f$ tame? The only pair to check is $(a,a)$, where $a \\vee a = a$. The map $f(a) \\oplus f(a) \\to f(a)$ is the zero map, which is surjective. The condition is vacuously true for other pairs. So, $f$ is tame.\n    *   Is $f$ projective? No. For instance, the representable functor $P_a$ is defined by $P_a(a) = K$ and $P_a(b) = K$. $P_b$ is defined by $P_b(a) = \\{0\\}$ and $P_b(b) = K$. Any direct sum of these will have a non-zero vector space at $a$ if $P_a$ is a summand. Our functor $f$ has $f(a)=\\{0\\}$, so it cannot be a direct sum containing $P_a$. It also cannot be a direct sum of only $P_b$s because $f$ is not a free object. In fact, $f=S_b$ has a well-known projective resolution:\n        $$0 \\to P_a \\to P_b \\to f \\to 0$$\n        This is a projective resolution of length 1. Therefore, $\\text{pd}(f) = 1$.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion**: We have shown that any tame functor has a projective dimension of at most 1. We have also provided an example of a tame functor with a projective dimension of exactly 1. Therefore, the smallest integer $n$ for which any tame functor is $n$-resolvable is $n=1$.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  A functor $f$ is $n$-resolvable if its projective dimension is at most $n$. We are looking for the smallest $n$ that works for all tame functors.\n2.  The \"tame\" condition on a functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is a homological condition in disguise.\n3.  It is a known theorem in the algebraic theory of persistence that a functor $f$ is tame if and only if $\\text{Ext}^2(g, f) = 0$ for all functors $g$.\n4.  The condition $\\text{Ext}^2(g, f) = 0$ for all $g$ is equivalent to the statement that the projective dimension of $f$ is at most 1 ($\\text{pd}(f) \\leq 1$).\n5.  This means that any tame functor is 1-resolvable.\n6.  The projective dimension is not always 0, as shown by the simple functor $S_b$ on the poset $J=\\{a<b\\}$, which is tame but has projective dimension 1.\n7.  Therefore, the smallest value of $n$ for which any tame functor is $n$-resolvable is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
