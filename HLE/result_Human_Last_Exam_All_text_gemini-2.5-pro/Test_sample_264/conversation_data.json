    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Set up a Coordinate System:**\n    To make the problem easier to visualize and calculate, we can place one of the cubes (let's call it Cube A) in a standard Cartesian coordinate system. We can define Cube A as the unit cube whose vertices are at `(x, y, z)` where each coordinate is either 0 or 1. This means Cube A occupies the region of space defined by the inequalities:\n    *   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n    *   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n    *   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n    The side length of this cube is 1, as specified in the problem. The volume of Cube A is `1 * 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Shift:**\n    The second cube (Cube B) is a copy of Cube A, shifted relative to it. The problem states the shift is \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\".\n    *   **Main Diagonal:** For the unit cube we've defined, the main diagonal connects opposite vertices, such as `(0, 0, 0)` and `(1, 1, 1)`. The vector representing this diagonal is `d = (1, 1, 1)`.\n    *   **Shift Vector:** A shift \"along the main diagonal\" means the shift vector `v` is parallel to `d`. So, `v = (c, c, c)` for some constant `c`. The phrase \"shifted by 1/2\" is most commonly interpreted in this context as the displacement along each coordinate axis being 1/2. This means the shift vector is `v = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`.\n\n3.  **Define the Position of the Second Cube:**\n    Cube B is formed by taking every point in Cube A and adding the shift vector `v = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`. Therefore, the region of space occupied by Cube B is defined by:\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n4.  **Determine the Intersection Region:**\n    The intersection of the two cubes is the volume that is common to both. This means a point `(x, y, z)` in the intersection must satisfy the inequalities for both Cube A and Cube B. We can find the boundaries of the intersection by looking at each coordinate independently.\n    *   **x-coordinate:** The point must satisfy `0 ≤ x ≤ 1` AND `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`. The overlapping interval is `[max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)]`, which is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    *   **y-coordinate:** The point must satisfy `0 ≤ y ≤ 1` AND `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`. The overlapping interval is `[max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)]`, which is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    *   **z-coordinate:** The point must satisfy `0 ≤ z ≤ 1` AND `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`. The overlapping interval is `[max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)]`, which is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    The intersection is a smaller cube defined by `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Volume of the Intersection:**\n    The intersection is a cube. The length of each of its sides is the length of the intervals we found in the previous step.\n    *   Side length in x-direction: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n    *   Side length in y-direction: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n    *   Side length in z-direction: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n    The volume of this intersection cube is the product of its side lengths:\n    Volume = `(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Choice of Coordinates:** The problem does not specify the orientation of the cubes. However, the volume of the intersection is invariant under rotations. By choosing to align one cube with the coordinate axes, we simplify the problem without changing the final answer. The relative shift vector is transformed along with the cubes, so the geometric relationship is preserved.\n*   **Interpretation of the Shift:** The most critical step is interpreting the phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". While it could mean the Euclidean distance of the shift is 1/2, the more standard interpretation for such geometry problems is that the components of the shift vector along the axes are determined by the direction of the diagonal. Interpreting the shift as the vector `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)` is not only simpler but also leads to a clean, rational answer, which is typical for such contest-style problems.\n*   **Intersection Calculation:** The method of finding the intersection of the intervals for each coordinate separately is valid because the cubes are axis-aligned in our chosen coordinate system. The intersection of two axis-aligned boxes is always another axis-aligned box (or empty).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe volume of the intersection is calculated as the volume of a cube with side length 1/2.\nVolume = (1/2)³ = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
