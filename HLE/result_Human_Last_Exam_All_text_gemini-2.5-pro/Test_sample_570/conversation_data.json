    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal area of the convex domain.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nWe are looking for the minimum possible area of a convex domain, let's call it `K`, in the Cartesian plane. This domain `K` must have a non-empty intersection with every line given by the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers. The set of coprime integers `(p,q)` is denoted by `S = {(p,q) \\in Z^2 | gcd(p,q)=1}`.\n\n### Step 2: Formulating the Condition for Intersection\n\nA convex domain `K` intersects a line `ax + by = c` if and only if `K` is not entirely contained in one of the open half-planes `ax + by > c` or `ax + by < c`.\nThis can be expressed using the support function of `K`, `h_K(u) = sup_{v \\in K} u \\cdot v`. The condition for `K` to intersect the line `l_{p,q}: px + qy = 1` is:\n`inf_{(x,y) \\in K} (px+qy) \\le 1 \\le sup_{(x,y) \\in K} (px+qy)`\n\nThe infimum can be expressed as `inf_{v \\in K} u \\cdot v = -sup_{v \\in K} (-u) \\cdot v = -h_K(-u)`.\nSo, for every pair of coprime integers `(p,q)`, the following must hold:\n`-h_K(-p,-q) \\le 1 \\le h_K(p,q)`\n\n### Step 3: Deriving Constraints on the Width of the Domain\n\nLet's analyze the condition for specific lines in the set. The set `S` of coprime integer pairs includes `(1,0)`, `(-1,0)`, `(0,1)`, and `(0,-1)`.\n\n1.  **Line `x = 1` (for `(p,q)=(1,0)`)**:\n    The condition `1 \\le h_K(1,0)` means `1 \\le sup_{(x,y) \\in K} x`. Let `x_{max} = sup_{(x,y) \\in K} x`. So, `x_{max} \\ge 1`.\n\n2.  **Line `x = -1` (for `(p,q)=(-1,0)`)**:\n    The condition `1 \\le h_K(-1,0)` means `1 \\le sup_{(x,y) \\in K} (-x)`, which is equivalent to `-1 \\ge inf_{(x,y) \\in K} x`. Let `x_{min} = inf_{(x,y) \\in K} x`. So, `x_{min} \\le -1`.\n\nThe width of the convex domain `K` in the x-direction is `w_x = x_{max} - x_{min}`. From the two conditions above, we have:\n`w_x \\ge 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n\n3.  **Line `y = 1` (for `(p,q)=(0,1)`)**:\n    Similarly, we get `y_{max} = sup_{(x,y) \\in K} y \\ge 1`.\n\n4.  **Line `y = -1` (for `(p,q)=(0,-1)`)**:\n    Similarly, we get `y_{min} = inf_{(x,y) \\in K} y \\le -1`.\n\nThe width of `K` in the y-direction is `w_y = y_{max} - y_{min}`. Therefore:\n`w_y \\ge 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n\nSo, any convex domain `K` that satisfies the problem's conditions must have a width of at least 2 in the x-direction and a width of at least 2 in the y-direction.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Minimum Area with Given Widths\n\nNow we need to find the minimum area of a convex domain `K` given `w_x \\ge 2` and `w_y \\ge 2`.\nThere is a well-known theorem in convex geometry, first established by Kubota (1923), which states that the area `A` of any convex set with widths `w_x` and `w_y` in two orthogonal directions satisfies the inequality:\n`A \\ge (1/2) w_x w_y`\n\nThe minimum area is achieved by a triangle with base `w_x` and height `w_y`.\n\nApplying this theorem to our constraints:\n`Area(K) \\ge (1/2) * (2) * (2) = 2`.\n\nThis establishes that the minimal possible area is at least 2.\n\n### Step 5: Finding a Candidate Domain and Verifying It\n\nTo show that 2 is indeed the minimum area, we must find a specific convex domain that satisfies all the conditions and has an area of exactly 2.\n\nConsider the square `Q` defined by the inequality `|x| + |y| \\le 1`.\nThis square has vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`. Its area is `(sqrt(2))^2 = 2`.\n\nLet's verify if `Q` intersects every line `px + qy = 1` for `(p,q) \\in S`.\nThe domain `Q` is centrally symmetric with respect to the origin. For such a domain, `h_Q(-u) = h_Q(u)`, so the intersection condition simplifies to `h_Q(p,q) \\ge 1`.\n\nThe support function `h_Q(p,q)` is the maximum value of `px+qy` for `(x,y)` in `Q`. The maximum must occur at one of the vertices:\n`h_Q(p,q) = max(p(1)+q(0), p(0)+q(1), p(-1)+q(0), p(0)+q(-1))`\n`h_Q(p,q) = max(p, q, -p, -q) = max(|p|, |q|)`.\n\nSo, the condition for `Q` to be a valid domain is `max(|p|, |q|) \\ge 1` for all coprime integer pairs `(p,q)`.\nLet's check this:\n- If `p=0`, `gcd(0,q)=1` implies `|q|=1`. Then `max(|0|,|1|) = 1`. The condition holds.\n- If `q=0`, `gcd(p,0)=1` implies `|p|=1`. Then `max(|1|,|0|) = 1`. The condition holds.\n- If `p \\neq 0` and `q \\neq 0`, then `|p| \\ge 1` and `|q| \\ge 1`. Thus, `max(|p|,|q|) \\ge 1`. The condition holds.\nSince `(p,q)` are coprime, they cannot both be zero. So these cases cover all possibilities.\n\nThe square `Q = {(x,y) : |x|+|y| \\le 1}` intersects all the required lines and has an area of 2.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that:\n1.  The area of any such convex domain must be at least 2.\n2.  There exists a convex domain (the square `|x|+|y| \\le 1`) that satisfies the conditions and has an area of exactly 2.\n\nTherefore, the minimal area is 2."
