    "This question asks for the number of distinct topological types (homeomorphism classes) of mathematical objects that have a specific set of properties. Let's break down the question and the properties involved.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Terminology**\n\n*   **Continuum:** In topology, a continuum is a compact and connected metric space. Since the question specifies \"planar,\" we are working within the metric space R², so this definition is appropriate.\n    *   *Compact* means it is closed and bounded when embedded in the plane.\n    *   *Connected* means it is a single, unbroken piece.\n*   **Planar:** A space is planar if it can be embedded in the Euclidean plane (R²). This means there is a homeomorphism (a continuous, one-to-one mapping with a continuous inverse) from the space to a subset of R².\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space is homogeneous if it \"looks the same\" from every point. Formally, for any two points *x* and *y* in the space, there exists a homeomorphism of the space onto itself that maps *x* to *y*.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** A collection of all topological spaces that are topologically equivalent (homeomorphic) to each other. The question is asking for the total number of these collections that satisfy the above properties.\n\nIn short, we are looking for the number of topologically unique objects that are compact, connected, can be drawn in the plane without lifting the pen, and are perfectly uniform in their local structure.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Trivial (Degenerate) Case**\n\nThe simplest possible continuum is a **single point**.\n*   It is compact (a single point is closed and bounded).\n*   It is connected.\n*   It is planar (it exists in the plane).\n*   It is trivially homogeneous (for any two points *x* and *y*... but there's only one point, so the condition holds).\n\nThus, the **point** constitutes the first homeomorphism class. This is the only \"degenerate\" continuum (a continuum with more than one point is non-degenerate).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the \"Simple\" Locally Connected Case**\n\nLet's consider non-degenerate continua that are also locally connected (every point has a neighborhood base of connected sets). A famous theorem by the Polish mathematician Stefan Mazurkiewicz (1920) states that any non-degenerate, homogeneous, locally connected, planar continuum is homeomorphic to a **circle (S¹)**.\n*   The circle is compact, connected, planar, and homogeneous (any point can be rotated to any other point).\n*   It is also locally connected.\n\nThis gives us our second homeomorphism class: the **circle**.\n\n**Step 4: Consider Cases That Are Not Locally Connected**\n\nThis is where the more exotic \"indecomposable\" continua appear. If a homogeneous planar continuum is not locally connected, it cannot contain any simple arcs. The classification of these objects was a major achievement in 20th-century topology. The work of R. H. Bing, F. Burton Jones, and J. T. Rogers Jr. led to the conclusion that there are exactly two such objects.\n\n1.  **The Pseudo-arc:**\n    *   This is a non-degenerate continuum that is planar and homogeneous.\n    *   It is famously *indecomposable*, meaning it cannot be written as the union of two of its own proper subcontinua.\n    *   It is *not* locally connected and contains no arcs.\n    *   Despite its bizarre properties, it has been proven that there is only one such object up to homeomorphism.\n    This gives us our third homeomorphism class: the **pseudo-arc**.\n\n2.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:**\n    *   This is another non-degenerate continuum that is planar and homogeneous.\n    *   Unlike the pseudo-arc, it is *decomposable*. It can be thought of as being formed by continuously replacing each point of a circle with a pseudo-arc.\n    *   Like the pseudo-arc, it is *not* locally connected and contains no arcs.\n    *   It has also been proven that this object is unique up to homeomorphism.\n    This gives us our fourth and final homeomorphism class: the **circle of pseudo-arcs**.\n\n**Step 5: The Final Classification**\n\nA deep theorem in continuum theory, culminating in the work of J. T. Rogers, Jr. in the 1980s, asserts that the list we have compiled is complete. Any homogeneous planar continuum must be homeomorphic to one of these four objects.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Distinguish between Degenerate and Non-degenerate:** The point is the only degenerate case. All others are non-degenerate.\n2.  **Distinguish by Local Connectivity:** The point and the circle are locally connected. The pseudo-arc and the circle of pseudo-arcs are not.\n3.  **Distinguish by Decomposability:** Among the non-locally connected cases, the pseudo-arc is indecomposable, while the circle of pseudo-arcs is decomposable.\n4.  **Uniqueness:** It is a non-trivial result that the pseudo-arc and the circle of pseudo-arcs are each unique up to homeomorphism.\n5.  **Exhaustiveness:** The proof that this list of four is exhaustive is a very advanced result in topology.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the complete classification theorem for homogeneous planar continua, there are exactly four such homeomorphism classes:\n\n1.  The Point\n2.  The Circle\n3.  The Pseudo-arc\n4.  The Circle of Pseudo-arcs\n\nTherefore, the total number of classes is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
