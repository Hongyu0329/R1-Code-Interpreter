    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity of the given algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Algorithm's Goal**\nThe algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` takes a non-negative integer `n` and an integer base `c >= 2` and computes the representation of `n` in base `c`. For example, `IMAG(13, 2)` would produce the binary representation `(1101)`. It does this by repeatedly finding the remainder (`x - qc`, which is `x mod c`) to get the next digit and then integer dividing the number by the base (`q := ⌊x/c⌋`) to prepare for the next digit.\n\n**2. Analyze the Initialization (Step 1)**\n*   `i := 0;`: This is a simple assignment, which takes constant time. Let's denote this as O(1).\n*   `x := n;`: Another simple assignment, taking O(1) time.\n*   `q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;`: These are basic arithmetic operations (division, multiplication, subtraction). In standard computational models, when dealing with integers that can fit within a machine's word size (e.g., 64-bit integers), these operations are considered to take constant time, O(1).\n\nTherefore, the total time for the initialization step is O(1) + O(1) + O(1) = O(1).\n\n**3. Analyze the Loop (Step 2)**\nThe core of the algorithm is the `while` loop. To find the complexity, we need to determine two things:\n    a) How many times the loop runs (number of iterations).\n    b) How much work is done in each iteration.\n\n**3a. Number of Iterations**\n*   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`.\n*   Let's trace the value of `q`. Initially, `q = ⌊n/c⌋`.\n*   In the first iteration, `x` becomes the initial `q`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊(initial q)/c⌋`, which is `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n*   In the second iteration, the new `q` becomes `⌊(n/c²)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c³⌋`.\n*   After `k` iterations, the value of `q` will be `⌊n / c^(k+1)⌋`.\n*   The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `n / c^(k+1)` drops below 1.\n*   So, we are looking for the number of iterations `k` such that `n / c^(k+1) < 1`, which is equivalent to `n < c^(k+1)`.\n*   By taking the logarithm base `c` on both sides, we get `log_c(n) < k + 1`, or `k > log_c(n) - 1`.\n*   The number of iterations is therefore `k = ⌊log_c(n)⌋`.\n*   In Big-O notation, the number of iterations is `O(log_c n)`.\n\n**3b. Work per Iteration**\n*   Inside the loop (Step 2.1), the following operations are performed:\n    *   `i := i + 1;`: Assignment/increment, O(1).\n    *   `x := q;`: Assignment, O(1).\n    *   `q :=. ⌊x/c⌋;`: Integer division, O(1).\n    *   `a_{i} := x — qc`: Multiplication and subtraction, O(1).\n*   The total work done inside each single iteration of the loop is constant: O(1) + O(1) + O(1) + O(1) = O(1).\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Computational Time**\nThe total time complexity is the sum of the time for initialization and the total time for the loop.\n*   Total Time = Time(Initialization) + (Number of Iterations) × (Time per Iteration)\n*   Total Time = O(1) + O(log_c n) × O(1)\n*   Total Time = O(log_c n)\n\n**5. Final Simplification**\nThe base of the logarithm in Big-O notation does not matter, as long as the base is a constant greater than 1. This is because of the change of base formula: `log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`. Since `c` is a constant, `log_b(c)` is also a constant. Constant factors are ignored in Big-O notation. Therefore, we can express the complexity in terms of the natural logarithm (`ln`) or the common base-2 logarithm (`log`).\n*   `O(log_c n) = O(log n)`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Cost Model:** The analysis assumes the \"uniform cost model\", where basic arithmetic operations on standard-sized integers take constant time (O(1)). This is a standard and appropriate assumption for this type of algorithm analysis. If `n` were an arbitrary-precision number (with a number of bits `k = log n`), the cost of division `n/c` would be `O(k)`, leading to an overall complexity of `O(k^2)` or `O((log n)^2)`. However, without this specific context, the `O(log n)` complexity is the standard answer.\n2.  **Loop Control Variable:** The key is to correctly identify how the variable controlling the loop (`q`) decreases. It decreases multiplicatively (by a factor of approximately `c` each time), which is characteristic of logarithmic complexity.\n3.  **Input Parameters:** The complexity is a function of the input `n`. The base `c` is treated as a constant parameter that does not grow with the size of the problem.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n*   **Step 1:** The algorithm's runtime is dominated by the `while` loop.\n*   **Step 2:** The loop's body performs a constant amount of work, O(1).\n*   **Step 3:** The loop executes `O(log_c n)` times because the variable `n` (and consequently `q`) is divided by `c` in each step.\n*   **Step 4:** The total complexity is the product of the number of iterations and the work per iteration: `O(log_c n) * O(1) = O(log_c n)`.\n*   **Step 5:** Convert to the standard notation: `O(log_c n)` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
