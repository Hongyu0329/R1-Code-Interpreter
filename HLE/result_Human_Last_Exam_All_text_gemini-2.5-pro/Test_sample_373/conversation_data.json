    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Graph Structure: The Barbell Graph**\n\n*   A barbell graph is constructed by joining two identical, separate graphs with a bridge (an edge).\n*   The question specifies a barbell graph with 10 nodes. The most common and simple construction for a barbell graph uses complete graphs (cliques) as its ends.\n*   With 10 nodes in total, the graph is formed by two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (`K_5`), connected by a single edge.\n*   Let's label the two `K_5` cliques as `C1` and `C2`.\n*   Let the single edge connecting them be `e_b`. This is the \"bottleneck edge\".\n*   This bottleneck edge connects one specific node from `C1` (let's call it `u1`) to one specific node from `C2` (let's call it `u2`). So, `e_b = (u1, u2)`.\n\n**2. Understanding the Process: Randomized Uniform Gossiping**\n\n*   Randomized uniform gossiping is a process where nodes in a network spread information.\n*   The core mechanism is as follows: A node `u` that has the information (is \"informed\") becomes active.\n*   When active, node `u` chooses one of its neighbors to send the information to.\n*   The \"uniform\" part means this choice is made uniformly at random from all of `u`'s neighbors.\n*   Therefore, if a node `u` has `k` neighbors (i.e., its degree is `k`), the probability of it choosing any single neighbor is `1/k`.\n\n**3. Framing the Question: \"Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge\"**\n\n*   The question asks for the probability of \"sampling\" the bottleneck edge `e_b`.\n*   In the context of gossiping, an edge is \"sampled\" when an informed node at one end of the edge chooses to send the gossip along that edge.\n*   This action can only be performed by the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge: `u1` and `u2`.\n*   The question is asking for the fundamental probability that, given one of these nodes (`u1` or `u2`) is gossiping, it will choose the bottleneck edge for its transmission.\n\n**4. Calculating the Probability**\n\n*   Let's focus on node `u1`. We need to determine its total number of neighbors (its degree).\n    *   `u1` is part of the complete graph `C1` (`K_5`). In a `K_5`, each node is connected to the other 4 nodes. So, `u1` has 4 neighbors within `C1`.\n    *   `u1` is also connected to `u2` via the bottleneck edge `e_b`. This is its 5th connection.\n    *   Therefore, the degree of `u1` is `deg(u1) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n*   According to the uniform gossiping model, when `u1` gossips, it picks one of its 5 neighbors with equal probability.\n*   The probability of `u1` choosing to send the gossip to `u2` (i.e., sampling the bottleneck edge) is `1 / deg(u1)`.\n*   So, the probability is `1/5`.\n*   By symmetry, the same logic applies to node `u2`. Its degree is also 5 (4 neighbors in `C2` and 1 neighbor `u1`), so the probability of it sampling the bottleneck edge when it gossips is also `1/5`.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\n*   The probability of the bottleneck edge being sampled in a single transmission event from one of its endpoints is `1/5`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Graph Interpretation:** It is crucial to correctly interpret \"barbell graph with 10 nodes\" as two `K_5` cliques connected by a single edge. Other interpretations (e.g., using a path of length greater than 1 as the bridge, or non-equal cliques) would change the result. The symmetric `K_5`-`K_5` model is standard.\n2.  **Gossiping Model:** The analysis relies on the standard \"push\" gossiping model where a single node chooses a single neighbor uniformly. The term \"uniform\" is key.\n3.  **Scope of Probability:** The question is interpreted as asking for the conditional probability of choosing the bottleneck edge, given one of its endpoints is the active gossiper. It is not asking about the probability of the gossip ever crossing the bridge or the probability of the edge being chosen out of all possible edges in the graph at once.\n4.  **Degree Calculation:** The final answer depends entirely on the correct calculation of the degree of the nodes at the ends of the bottleneck. Any mistake here would lead to an incorrect result.\n\nThe final calculated probability is `1/5`.\n\n<<<0.2>>>"
