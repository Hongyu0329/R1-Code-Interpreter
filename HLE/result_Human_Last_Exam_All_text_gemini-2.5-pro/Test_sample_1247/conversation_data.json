    "Answering this question requires finding the number of permutations \\(\\pi\\) of length \\(n=333\\) that are 1324-avoiding and have exactly \\(k=3\\) inversions.\n\nA permutation \\(\\pi\\) avoids the pattern 1324 if there are no indices \\(i<j<k<l\\) such that \\(\\pi(i) < \\pi(k) < \\pi(j) < \\pi(l)\\).\nAn inversion is a pair of indices \\((i,j)\\) such that \\(i<j\\) and \\(\\pi(i) > \\pi(j)\\). We need the total number of such pairs to be 3.\n\nWe can classify permutations with 3 inversions based on their structure. For a large \\(n\\) like 333, a permutation with only 3 inversions must be very close to the identity permutation \\(1, 2, ..., n\\). The disturbances from the identity permutation are localized.\n\nWe will systematically list the types of permutations with 3 inversions and check if they are 1324-avoiding. A common way to prove that a permutation \\(\\pi\\) contains a 1324 pattern is to find indices \\(a<b<c<d\\) such that the values \\(\\pi(a), \\pi(b), \\pi(c), \\pi(d)\\) are in the order \\(x, z, y, w\\) with \\(x<y<z<w\\). Notice that the pair of indices \\((b,c)\\) must be an inversion in \\(\\pi\\).\n\nLet's analyze the permutations based on the structure of their inversions. The shape of a permutation can be determined by its inversion table \\(d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_{n-1}\\), where \\(d_i\\) is the number of elements to the right of position \\(i\\) that are smaller than \\(\\pi(i)\\). The total number of inversions is \\(\\sum d_i\\). For \\(k=3\\), the non-zero entries in the inversion table must sum to 3. This corresponds to the integer partitions of 3: (3), (2,1), and (1,1,1).\n\nCase 1: The partition is (3). One element causes all 3 inversions.\nThis means the inversion table has a single non-zero entry: \\(d_i=3\\) for some \\(i\\).\nThis structure arises in two ways:\nType A: \\(\\pi = 1, ..., i-1, i+3, i, i+1, i+2, i+4, ..., n\\).\nThe element \\(i+3\\) at position \\(i\\) is inverted with \\(i, i+1, i+2\\). For this permutation type to be possible, we need \\(i+3 \\le n\\).\nThese permutations are 1324-avoiding only at the boundaries of \\(n\\). A pattern is formed for \\(i \\in [2, n-4]\\).\n- If \\(i=1\\): \\(\\pi = 4,1,2,3,5, ..., n\\). This is 1324-avoiding because any 1324 pattern would require an inversion \\((b,c)\\), which must have \\(b=1\\). But then no index \\(a<b\\) exists.\n- If \\(i=n-3\\): \\(\\pi = 1, ..., n-4, n, n-3, n-2, n-1\\). This is 1324-avoiding because to form a 1324 pattern \\(\\pi_a < \\pi_c < \\pi_b < \\pi_d\\), with the inversion \\((b,c)\\) being \\((n-3, c')\\), we would need \\(\\pi_d > \\pi_b = n\\), which is impossible.\nFor \\(n=333\\), these are two distinct permutations. So we get 2 permutations of this type.\n\nType E: \\(\\pi = 1, ..., i-1, i+1, i+2, i+3, i, i+4, ..., n\\). (This is based on the position of the out-of-order element).\nLet's analyze the general structure \\(\\pi = \\dots, v, \\dots, x, y, z, \\dots\\) where \\(v > x, y, z\\). My type A is one example. What if the small elements come first?\n\\(\\pi = 1,...,i-1, i+1, i+2, i+3, i, i+4,...\\). The element \\(i\\) is moved to position \\(i+3\\). It has inversions with \\(i+1, i+2, i+3\\).\nThis permutation avoids 1324 under boundary conditions.\n- If \\(i=1\\): \\(\\pi = 2,3,4,1,5, ..., n\\). This is 1324-avoiding because any inversion \\((b,c)\\) must have \\(c=4\\). Then \\(\\pi_c=1\\), so we need \\(\\pi_a<1\\), which is impossible.\n- If \\(i=n-3\\): \\(\\pi = 1, ..., n-4, n-2, n-1, n, n-3\\). This is 1324-avoiding. To form a pattern with inversion \\((b,n)\\), we'd need \\(\\pi_d > \\pi_b\\). \\(\\pi_b\\) can be \\(n-2, n-1, n\\). So \\(\\pi_d>n-2\\). But \\(d>n\\) is not possible. A more careful check shows it avoids the pattern.\nFor \\(n=333\\), we get 2 permutations of this type.\n\nCase 2: The partition is (2,1). Two elements cause the inversions.\nThis corresponds to an inversion table with \\(d_i=2\\) and \\(d_j=1\\).\nType B: A block of three elements is reversed: \\(\\pi = 1, ..., i-1, i+2, i+1, i, i+3, ..., n\\).\nThe element \\(i+2\\) has 2 inversions, and \\(i+1\\) has 1. Total 3.\nThis type is 1324-avoiding only at the boundaries.\n- If \\(i=1\\): \\(\\pi = 3,2,1,4, ..., n\\). This is 1324-avoiding.\n- If \\(i=n-2\\): \\(\\pi = 1, ..., n-3, n, n-1, n-2\\). This is 1324-avoiding.\nFor \\(n=333\\), we get 2 permutations.\n\nType F: One element jumps over two, and another separate pair is swapped.\n\\(\\pi = ... c,a,b ... e,d ...\\) where \\(c>a,b\\) and \\(e>d\\).\nThis type is generally not 1324-avoiding unless the \"action\" is at the boundaries.\n- The structure \\(\\pi = 2,1,3,...,n-3, n,n-2,n-1\\). This permutation has 3 inversions from the pairs (2,1), (n,n-2), and (n,n-1). It can be shown to be 1324-avoiding.\n- The structure \\(\\pi = 3,1,2,4,...,n-2, n,n-1\\). This permutation has 3 inversions from the pairs (3,1), (3,2), and (n,n-1). It can be shown to be 1324-avoiding.\nThis gives 2 more permutations.\n\nOther types of permutations with shape (2,1) like \\(3142...\\) and \\(2413...\\) can be shown to contain the 1324 pattern for \\(n \\ge 5\\).\n\nCase 3: The partition is (1,1,1). Three elements each cause one inversion.\nThis can be three disjoint swaps of adjacent elements, e.g., \\(\\pi = 2,1,4,3,6,5, ..., n\\).\nThis structure can be shown to always contain a 1324 pattern for \\(n \\ge 5\\).\nThe other possibility for this shape is Type E from Case 1 according to its inversion table. Let's recheck Type E's table: \\(\\pi = 1,..,i-1, i+1, i+2, i+3, i, ...\\).\n\\(\\pi_i=i+1, \\pi_{i+1}=i+2, \\pi_{i+2}=i+3, \\pi_{i+3}=i\\).\n\\(d_i = \\#\\{j>i : \\pi_j < \\pi_i=i+1\\}\\). The only such \\(\\pi_j\\) is \\(\\pi_{i+3}=i\\). So \\(d_i=1\\).\n\\(d_{i+1} = \\#\\{j>i+1 : \\pi_j < \\pi_{i+1}=i+2\\}\\). The only such \\(\\pi_j\\) is \\(\\pi_{i+3}=i\\). So \\(d_{i+1}=1\\).\n\\(d_{i+2} = \\#\\{j>i+2 : \\pi_j < \\pi_{i+2}=i+3\\}\\). The only such \\(\\pi_j\\) is \\(\\pi_{i+3}=i\\). So \\(d_{i+2}=1\\).\nThe inversion table shape is (1,1,1). My previous analysis for this type yielding 2 permutations is correct.\n\nIn summary, for \\(n=333\\), we have found:\n- From Type A (shape (3)): 2 permutations.\n- From Type B (shape (2,1)): 2 permutations.\n- From Type F (shape (2,1)): 2 permutations.\n- From Type E (shape (1,1,1)): 2 permutations.\n\nAll other types of permutations with 3 inversions can be shown to contain a 1324 pattern when \\(n=333\\).\nThe total number of such permutations is the sum of the counts from these types.\nTotal = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.\n\nThe 8 permutations are:\n1. \\(4,1,2,3,5,...,333\\)\n2. \\(1,2,...,329,333,330,331,332\\)\n3. \\(3,2,1,4,5,...,333\\)\n4. \\(1,2,...,330,333,332,331\\)\n5. \\(2,3,4,1,5,...,333\\)\n6. \\(1,2,...,329,331,332,333,330\\)\n7. \\(2,1,3,...,330,333,331,332\\)\n8. \\(3,1,2,4,...,331,333,332\\)\n\nFinal Answer is 8."
