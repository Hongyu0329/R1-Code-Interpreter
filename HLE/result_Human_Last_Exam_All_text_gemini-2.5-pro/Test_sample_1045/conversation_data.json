    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Molecule\n*   The molecule is toluene.\n*   The chemical formula is **C7H8**.\n*   This means the molecule consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the 6-31G Basis Set Notation\nThe name \"6-31G\" describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions. A contracted Gaussian function (or basis function) is a linear combination of one or more primitive Gaussian functions. The question asks for the total number of these contracted functions.\n\n*   **For Core Orbitals:** The number before the hyphen, **'6'**, indicates that each core atomic orbital is described by a single contracted Gaussian function, which is formed by summing 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n*   **For Valence Orbitals:** The numbers after the hyphen, **'31'**, describe the valence orbitals. This is a \"split-valence\" basis set, meaning the valence shell is represented by two basis functions for more flexibility.\n    *   The **'3'** means the inner part of the valence shell is described by one contracted function made from 3 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   The **'1'** means the outer part of the valence shell is described by one contracted function made from 1 primitive Gaussian.\n    *   Therefore, each valence atomic orbital is represented by **two** contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Number of Contracted Functions per Atom\n\n**A. For a single Carbon (C) atom:**\n*   **Electron Configuration:** 1s², 2s², 2p²\n*   **Core Orbitals:** The 1s orbital is a core orbital.\n    *   According to the '6' in 6-31G, the 1s orbital is represented by **1 contracted function**.\n*   **Valence Orbitals:** The 2s and 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz) are valence orbitals.\n    *   According to the '31' in 6-31G, each valence orbital is split into two functions.\n    *   For the 2s orbital: **2 contracted functions**.\n    *   For the three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz): 3 orbitals × 2 functions/orbital = **6 contracted functions**.\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom:** 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 6 (for 2p) = **9 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n**B. For a single Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n*   **Electron Configuration:** 1s¹\n*   **Core Orbitals:** Hydrogen has no core electrons.\n*   **Valence Orbitals:** The 1s orbital is a valence orbital.\n    *   According to the '31' in 6-31G, the 1s valence orbital is split into two functions.\n    *   For the 1s orbital: **2 contracted functions**.\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** **2 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Contracted Functions for Toluene (C7H8)\nNow, we sum the functions for all atoms in the molecule.\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon atoms:**\n    *   There are 7 Carbon atoms.\n    *   7 C atoms × 9 functions/C atom = **63 functions**.\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   There are 8 Hydrogen atoms.\n    *   8 H atoms × 2 functions/H atom = **16 functions**.\n*   **Total for the molecule:**\n    *   63 (from Carbon) + 16 (from Hydrogen) = **79 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n### Careful Points:\n1.  **Distinguish between Primitive and Contracted Functions:** The question asks for the number of *contracted* functions (also known as basis functions), not the total number of *primitive* Gaussians.\n2.  **Correctly Identify Core vs. Valence Orbitals:** Carbon is a second-row element with a 1s core. Hydrogen is a first-row element with no core.\n3.  **Correctly Interpret the Split-Valence Notation:** '31' means each valence orbital is represented by two basis functions, not one.\n4.  **Account for All Orbitals:** Remember that the 'p' subshell contains three distinct orbitals (px, py, pz), each of which must be accounted for.\n\n<<<79>>>"
