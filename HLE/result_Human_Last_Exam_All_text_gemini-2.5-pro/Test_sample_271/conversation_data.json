    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the polynomial**\n\nLet the given polynomial be $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe try to factor this polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$. By trying to group terms, we can find a common factor:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nSo, $f(x)$ factors into two polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}$: $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n\n**Step 2: Check the irreducibility of the factors and determine their Galois groups**\n\n*   **For $g(x) = x^2 - 2$:**\n    This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p=2$. Its roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field of $g(x)$ is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **For $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:**\n    We check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$ using Eisenstein's criterion. Let the prime be $p=3$.\n    1.  The leading coefficient, 1, is not divisible by 3.\n    2.  All other coefficients, -9 and 3, are divisible by 3.\n    3.  The constant term, 3, is not divisible by $3^2=9$.\n    Thus, $h(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    To determine the Galois group of $h(x)$, we analyze its roots. $h(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 5. Its Galois group, $G_h$, is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$.\n    Let's find the number of real roots of $h(x)$ by checking its derivative: $h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$.\n    The critical points are the roots of $h'(x)=0$, so $x^4 = 9/5$, which gives two real critical points $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n    Let's evaluate $h(x)$ at these points:\n    $h(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = (9/5)^{5/4} - 9(9/5)^{1/4} + 3 = (9/5)^{1/4}(9/5 - 9) + 3 = (9/5)^{1/4}(-36/5) + 3$. Since $(9/5)^{1/4} > 1$ and $-36/5 = -7.2$, this value is negative.\n    $h(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = -(9/5)^{5/4} + 9(9/5)^{1/4} + 3 = (9/5)^{1/4}(-9/5 + 9) + 3 = (9/5)^{1/4}(36/5) + 3$. This value is positive.\n    Since $h(x)$ has a local maximum that is positive and a local minimum that is negative, it must have exactly three real roots. The other two roots must be a complex conjugate pair.\n    A standard theorem in Galois theory states that an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ which has exactly $p-2$ real roots has the symmetric group $S_p$ as its Galois group.\n    Here, $p=5$ and there are $5-2=3$ real roots. Thus, the Galois group of $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G_h = S_5$. The order of this group is $|S_5| = 5! = 120$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of the splitting field K**\n\nThe splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields $K_g$ and $K_h$. So, $K = K_g K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_5)$, where $\\alpha_i$ are the roots of $h(x)$.\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to the direct product $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q})$ if and only if $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nLet's check the intersection $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\cap K_h$.\nThe extension $K_h/\\mathbb{Q}$ has Galois group $S_5$. The subgroups of $S_5$ of index 2 correspond to quadratic subfields of $K_h$. $S_5$ has only one subgroup of index 2, the alternating group $A_5$. The corresponding fixed field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_h})$, where $\\Delta_h$ is the discriminant of $h(x)$.\nThe discriminant of $x^n+ax+b$ is $\\Delta = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2} (n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1}a^n)$.\nFor $h(x)=x^5-9x+3$, $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n$\\Delta_h = (-1)^{5(4)/2}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-1)^4 \\cdot 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5) = 1 \\cdot (3125 \\cdot 81 + 256 \\cdot (-59049)) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\nThe only quadratic subfield of $K_h$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$. This is an imaginary quadratic field.\n$K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field.\nSince one field is real and the other is imaginary, their intersection must be $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nTherefore, the Galois group of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$.\nThe order of the group is $|G| = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find all intermediate normal extensions and their degrees**\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, a field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ is normal if and only if its corresponding subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$ is a normal subgroup of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ with $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$. The degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nWe need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$. Let $C_2 = \\langle c \\rangle$.\nThe commutator subgroup of $G$ is $G' = [C_2, C_2] \\times [S_5, S_5] = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$. $G'$ is always a normal subgroup of $G$.\nLet $H$ be any normal subgroup of $G$. Then $H \\cap G'$ must be a normal subgroup of $G$. Since $G' \\cong A_5$ is a simple group, a normal subgroup of $G$ contained in $G'$ must be either $\\{(e,e)\\}$ or $G'$ itself.\n\nCase 1: $H \\cap G' = G'$. This means $G' \\subseteq H$.\nThese normal subgroups $H$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the normal subgroups of the quotient group $G/G' = (C_2 \\times S_5) / (\\{e\\} \\times A_5) \\cong C_2 \\times (S_5/A_5) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\nThe group $C_2 \\times C_2$ has 5 subgroups, all of which are normal:\n1.  The trivial subgroup. Its preimage is $H = G' = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$. $|H|=60$. Index $[G:H]=240/60=4$.\n2.  The subgroup generated by $(1,0)$. Its preimage is $H = C_2 \\times A_5$. $|H|=2 \\cdot 60 = 120$. Index $[G:H]=240/120=2$.\n3.  The subgroup generated by $(0,1)$. Its preimage corresponds to elements $(c, \\sigma)$ in $G$ where $c=0$, so $H = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$. $|H|=120$. Index $[G:H]=240/120=2$.\n4.  The subgroup generated by $(1,1)$. Its preimage corresponds to elements $(c, \\sigma)$ where $c$ is determined by the sign of $\\sigma$. $H = \\{(\\text{sgn}(\\tau), \\tau) \\mid \\tau \\in S_5\\}$. This is a \"diagonal\" subgroup. $|H|=120$. Index $[G:H]=240/120=2$.\n5.  The whole group $C_2 \\times C_2$. Its preimage is $G$ itself.\n\nCase 2: $H \\cap G' = \\{(e,e)\\}$.\nLet $(c, \\sigma) \\in H$. For any $\\tau \\in A_5$, the commutator $[(c,\\sigma), (e,\\tau)] = (e, \\sigma\\tau\\sigma^{-1}\\tau^{-1})$ must be in $H$ (since $H$ is normal) and in $G'$ (since $G'$ is the commutator subgroup). Thus, it is in $H \\cap G' = \\{(e,e)\\}$.\nThis means $\\sigma\\tau\\sigma^{-1}\\tau^{-1} = e$ for all $\\tau \\in A_5$, which implies $\\sigma$ commutes with every element of $A_5$. The centralizer of $A_5$ in $S_5$ is trivial ($C_{S_5}(A_5) = \\{e\\}$). So, $\\sigma=e$.\nThis shows that any element of $H$ must be of the form $(c, e)$, so $H \\subseteq C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$.\nThe only proper non-trivial subgroup of $C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$ is $C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$ itself. This is a normal subgroup of $G$ as it's in the center $Z(G) = C_2 \\times Z(S_5) = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$.\nSo, $H = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$. $|H|=2$. Index $[G:H]=240/2=120$.\n\n**Step 5: List the possible degrees**\n\nThe proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$ give rise to the intermediate normal extensions $L$. The degrees of these extensions are the indices of the subgroups:\n*   From $H = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$, degree is 120.\n*   From $H = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$, degree is 4.\n*   From $H = C_2 \\times A_5$, degree is 2.\n*   From $H = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$, degree is 2.\n*   From $H = \\{(\\text{sgn}(\\tau), \\tau) \\mid \\tau \\in S_5\\}$, degree is 2.\n\nThe set of all possible degrees for such extensions $L$ is the set of these index values.\n\nThe possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
