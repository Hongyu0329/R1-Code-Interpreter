    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the relationship between the Néron-Severi groups of X and C.**\n\nLet C be a smooth complex projective curve of genus g, and let $X = C^{(n)}$ be its n-th symmetric power. The Néron-Severi group, NS(X), is the group of divisors on X modulo algebraic equivalence, and its rank, $\\rho(X)$, is the Picard number of X.\n\nThere is a fundamental formula that relates the Picard number of the symmetric power of a curve to the Picard number of its Jacobian variety, J(C). The Jacobian J(C) is a g-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety that parameterizes degree 0 line bundles on C. The Albanese map $a: C^{(n)} \\to J(C)$ sends an effective divisor $D$ of degree n to the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(D - nP_0)$ (for a fixed base point $P_0$).\n\nFor $n \\ge g$, the Néron-Severi group $NS(C^{(n)})$ is generated by the pullbacks of divisor classes from the Jacobian, $a^*NS(J(C))$, and one additional generator. This leads to the isomorphism:\n$NS(C^{(n)}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus NS(J(C))$\nTaking the ranks of these free abelian groups, we get the formula for the Picard number:\n$\\rho(C^{(n)}) = 1 + \\rho(J(C))$\n\nIn our specific problem, C is a genus $g=3$ Riemann surface and $X = C^{(15)}$. Since $n=15 \\ge g=3$, the formula applies. Thus, we have:\n$\\rho(X) = 1 + \\rho(J(C))$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for $\\rho(J(C))$, the Picard number of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the smallest possible rank.**\n\nThe rank $\\rho(J(C))$ is determined by the endomorphism algebra of $J(C)$. The endomorphism ring of an abelian variety $A$, End(A), is a ring, and $\\text{End}^0(A) = \\text{End}(A) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$ is a finite-dimensional semisimple algebra over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Picard number $\\rho(A)$ is the dimension of the subspace of $\\text{End}^0(A)$ fixed by the Rosati involution associated with a principal polarization.\n\nThe smallest possible endomorphism ring for the Jacobian of a curve occurs for a \"generic\" curve. For a generic curve C of genus g, the endomorphism ring of its Jacobian is as small as possible:\n$\\text{End}(J(C)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\nThese are the \"trivial\" endomorphisms corresponding to multiplication-by-m maps. For such a curve, the endomorphism algebra is:\n$\\text{End}^0(J(C)) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$\n\nThe Rosati involution on $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the identity. The subspace of elements fixed by the identity is the whole space $\\mathbb{Q}$. The dimension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ as a vector space over itself is 1.\nTherefore, for a generic genus 3 curve C, $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$.\nThe existence of such curves is guaranteed as they form a dense open subset of the moduli space of genus 3 curves, $\\mathcal{M}_3$.\n\nThe smallest possible rank for $\\rho(X)$ is therefore:\n$\\rho_{min}(X) = 1 + \\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the largest possible rank.**\n\nThe largest possible rank occurs for a \"special\" curve C, one whose Jacobian $J(C)$ has a large endomorphism algebra, a property known as complex multiplication (in a general sense). We need to find the maximum possible value of $\\rho(J(C))$.\n\nA crucial fact for genus $g=3$ is that the Torelli map from the moduli space of curves $\\mathcal{M}_3$ to the moduli space of principally polarized abelian threefolds $\\mathcal{A}_3$ is surjective. This means that *every* principally polarized abelian threefold is the Jacobian of some genus 3 curve. Therefore, finding the maximum $\\rho(J(C))$ is equivalent to finding the maximum $\\rho(A)$ for any principally polarized abelian threefold A.\n\nFor an abelian variety A of dimension g, the Picard number is bounded by $\\rho(A) \\le g^2$. In our case, $g=3$, so $\\rho(A) \\le 9$. We must now check if this theoretical maximum can be achieved.\n\nConsider an abelian threefold $A$ that is the product of three identical elliptic curves with complex multiplication (CM), $A = E^3 = E \\times E \\times E$. Let E be an elliptic curve with CM by an imaginary quadratic field $K$ (for example, $E: y^2 = x^3 - x$, which has CM by $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, so $K = \\mathbb{Q}(i)$). The endomorphism algebra of E is $\\text{End}^0(E) \\cong K$.\nThe endomorphism algebra of A is $\\text{End}^0(A) \\cong M_3(\\text{End}^0(E)) \\cong M_3(K)$.\nWhen A is equipped with the product polarization, the corresponding Rosati involution on $M_3(K)$ is the conjugate transpose map, $M \\mapsto M^\\dagger = \\overline{M^T}$.\nThe Picard number $\\rho(A)$ is the dimension over $\\mathbb{Q}$ of the space of Hermitian matrices in $M_3(K)$ (matrices satisfying $M=M^\\dagger$).\nA $3 \\times 3$ Hermitian matrix over $K$ has:\n*   3 diagonal entries that must be self-conjugate, i.e., they lie in $\\mathbb{Q}$. This gives 3 dimensions.\n*   3 upper-triangular entries that can be any element of $K$. Since $K$ is a 2-dimensional vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$, this contributes $3 \\times 2 = 6$ dimensions. The lower-triangular entries are then determined.\nThe total dimension is $3 + 6 = 9$. Thus, $\\rho(A) = 9$.\n\nSince any principally polarized abelian threefold is a Jacobian, there exists a genus 3 curve C such that $J(C)$ is this abelian threefold A with $\\rho(J(C))=9$. A well-known example is the Fermat quartic curve, $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$, which is a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian is isogenous to $E^3$ where E has CM by $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\nTherefore, the maximum possible value for $\\rho(J(C))$ is 9.\n\nThe largest possible rank for $\\rho(X)$ is therefore:\n$\\rho_{max}(X) = 1 + \\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 1 + 9 = 10$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The smallest possible rank occurs for a generic curve C, where $\\rho(J(C))=1$. This gives $\\rho(X) = 1+1=2$.\n*   The largest possible rank occurs for a special curve C (like the Fermat quartic) whose Jacobian is isogenous to a product of three CM elliptic curves, where $\\rho(J(C))=9$. This gives $\\rho(X) = 1+9=10$.\n\nSmallest rank: 2\nLargest rank: 10\n\n<<<2, 10>>>"
