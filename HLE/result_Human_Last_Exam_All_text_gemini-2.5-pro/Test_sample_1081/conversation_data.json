    "Answering this question requires knowledge from the theory of reductive algebraic groups over finite fields. Let's break down the problem into a series of logical steps.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Object of Study:**\n    *   We are given a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n    *   A maximal torus is a maximal connected diagonalizable subgroup of $G$.\n    *   An $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal torus is a maximal torus that is defined as an algebraic variety over the field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. We are asked to find the total number of such subgroups in $G$.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Correct Mathematical Framework:**\n    *   The set of all maximal tori of $G$ forms an algebraic variety, which can be identified with the quotient variety $G/N$, where $N = N_G(T_0)$ is the normalizer of a fixed maximal torus $T_0$.\n    *   The $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori correspond to the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of this variety, denoted by $(G/N)(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n    *   A key theorem by Robert Steinberg provides a direct formula for counting such points.\n\n3.  **Stating the Key Theorem:**\n    *   **Steinberg's Theorem:** Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in $G$ is given by the ratio:\n        $$ \\text{Number of tori} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|T_s(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} $$\n        where $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the finite group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $G$, and $T_s$ is a *split* maximal torus defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A split torus is one that is isomorphic to a product of multiplicative groups, $(\\mathbb{G}_m)^r$, over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n4.  **Applying the Theorem to the Group $E_8$:**\n    *   **Existence of a split torus:** A reductive group is called *split* over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ if it contains a split maximal torus. Groups of type $E_8$ are always split over any field. This is because the Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms, which prevents the existence of so-called \"twisted\" forms. Thus, our group $G$ is split, and Steinberg's theorem is applicable.\n    *   We need to compute the two quantities in the formula: $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$ and $|T_s(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$.\n\n5.  **Calculating $|T_s(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$:**\n    *   The rank of the group $E_8$ is $r=8$.\n    *   A split maximal torus $T_s$ in $G$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{G}_m)^8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n    *   The group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $\\mathbb{G}_m$ is the multiplicative group of the field, $\\mathbb{F}_q^\\times$, which has $q-1$ elements.\n    *   Therefore, $|T_s(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = |\\mathbb{F}_q^\\times|^8 = (q-1)^8$.\n\n6.  **Calculating $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = |E_8(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$:**\n    *   The order of a split finite group of Lie type is given by Chevalley's formula:\n        $$ |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1) $$\n        where $r$ is the rank, $N$ is the number of positive roots, and $d_1, \\dots, d_r$ are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the associated Weyl group.\n    *   For the type $E_8$:\n        *   Rank: $r=8$.\n        *   Number of roots is 240, so the number of positive roots is $N = 240/2 = 120$.\n        *   The degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ are well-known: $2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30$.\n    *   Plugging these values into Chevalley's formula gives:\n        $$ |E_8(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1) $$\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Now we compute the ratio from Steinberg's theorem:\n        $$ \\text{Number of tori} = \\frac{|E_8(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|T_s(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} = \\frac{q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{(q-1)^8} $$\n    *   This expression can be simplified. Since each term $(q^{d_i}-1)$ contains a factor of $(q-1)$, we can cancel the denominator:\n        $$ \\text{Number of tori} = q^{120} \\left(\\frac{q^2-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^8-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{12}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{14}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{18}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{20}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{24}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{30}-1}{q-1}\\right) $$\n    *   Using the notation $[n]_q = \\frac{q^n-1}{q-1} = 1+q+\\dots+q^{n-1}$, the final answer is:\n        $$ q^{120} [2]_q [8]_q [12]_q [14]_q [18]_q [20]_q [24]_q [30]_q $$\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between the number of *conjugacy classes* of rational tori and the *total number* of rational tori. The question asks for the latter. The number of conjugacy classes would be the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$, which is 112.\n*   The validity of the formula relies on the group being split. For groups with diagram automorphisms (like $A_n, D_n, E_6$), one must consider twisted forms (like unitary groups $SU_n$) for which the calculation is different. For $E_8$, this is not a concern.\n*   The parameters for $E_8$ (rank, number of roots, degrees of invariants) must be known correctly. These are standard results from the theory of Lie algebras and root systems.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is given by the formula:\n$$ \\frac{q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{(q-1)^8} $$\n\n<<<$$ \\frac{q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{(q-1)^8} $$>>>"
