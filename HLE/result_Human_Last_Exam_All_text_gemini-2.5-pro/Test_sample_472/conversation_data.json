    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line:\n\"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\nThe meter is an **iambic senarius**, which consists of six iambic feet (pattern: S L). In Roman comedy (like the plays of Terence, from whom this line comes), this pattern allows for several types of substitution.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Syllabification and Elision**\n\nFirst, we break the line into its natural syllables and identify any elisions.\n`et | ti | bi | be | ne | es | se | so | li | quom | si | bi | sit | ma | le`\nThere are 15 syllables. This is too long for a standard 12-syllable iambic senarius, so we must look for prosodic features that shorten the line.\n\n*   **Elision:** The word `bene` ends in a vowel (`-e`), and the next word `esse` begins with a vowel. This is a classic case of elision. The final `-e` of `bene` is dropped, and the words are pronounced as one: `benesse`.\n*   This reduces the syllable count from 15 to 14. An iambic senarius with 14 syllables must contain two \"resolved\" feet (feet with three syllables instead of two).\n\nThe line is now treated as: `et tibi benesse soli quom sibi sit male`.\n\n**Step 2: Determining Syllable Quantities**\n\nNext, we determine whether each syllable is long (L) or short (S).\n\n1.  `et`: The vowel is short, but it is followed by two consonants (`t` from `et` and `t` from `tibi`). This makes the syllable long by position. **L**\n2.  `ti-bi`: The vowels in `tibi` are both naturally short. **S S**\n3.  `be-nes-se`: This is the result of the elision. `be-` is short. `nes-` is followed by `ss`, making it long by position. `-se` is short. **S L S**\n4.  `so-li`: The `o` in `solus` is naturally long. The final `i` in the dative is short. **L S**\n5.  `quom`: The vowel is short, but it's followed by two consonants (`m` and the `s` from `sibi`). Long by position. **L**\n6.  `si-bi`: The vowels in `sibi` are both naturally short. **S S**\n7.  `sit`: The vowel `i` is short, but it's followed by two consonants (`t` and the `m` from `male`). This would normally make it long by position. **(L)**\n8.  `ma-le`: Both vowels are naturally short. The final syllable is technically *anceps* (can be treated as long or short), but its natural quantity is short. **S S**\n\n**Step 3: Applying Iambic Shortening (Brevis Brevians)**\n\nA key rule in comic meter is Iambic Shortening, where an iambic sequence (S L) can be treated as a pyrrhic (S S).\n*   Look at the sequence `sibi sit`. The syllables are `si-bĭ sĭt`. The quantities are `S L` (since `sit` is long by position).\n*   The rule of *brevis brevians* allows the long syllable (`sit`) to be shortened when preceded by a short one in such a sequence.\n*   Therefore, `sit` is scanned as short. **S**\n\n**Step 4: Assembling the Final Scansion Pattern**\n\nWith the elision and iambic shortening, the sequence of quantities is:\n`L S S` (et tibi) `S L S` (benesse) `L S` (soli) `L` (quom) `S S S` (sibi sit) `S S` (male)\nTotal String: `L S S S L S L S L S S S S S`\n\nNow, we group these 14 syllables into 6 feet. This requires two 3-syllable feet.\n\n*   **Foot 1:** `et ti bi` → **L S S** (Dactyl). A valid substitution in the first foot.\n*   **Foot 2:** `be nes` → **S L** (Iamb). A standard foot.\n*   **Foot 3:** `se so` → **S L** (Iamb). A standard foot.\n*   **Foot 4:** `li quom` → **S L** (Iamb). A standard foot.\n*   **Foot 5:** `si bi sit` → **S S S** (Tribrach). A valid substitution.\n*   **Foot 6:** `ma le` → **S S** (Pyrrhic). This is the one tricky part. While the last foot should be a pure iamb, in comic verse, a final pyrrhic is sometimes found, with the final syllable understood as anceps (`S X`).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the scansion is a dactyl, followed by three iambs, a tribrach, and a final pyrrhic.\n\n<<<L S S S L S L S L S S S S S>>>"
