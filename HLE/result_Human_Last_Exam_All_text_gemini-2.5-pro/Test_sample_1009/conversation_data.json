    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the described topological group.\n\n**1. Understanding the given properties**\n\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n*   $G$ is compact.\n*   $G$ is first-countable, which means its character $\\chi(G)$ is $\\aleph_0$.\n*   The cardinality of $G$ is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   $G$ is not necessarily Hausdorff. This is a crucial point.\n\nWe want to find the largest possible value for the weight of $G$, denoted by $w(G)$.\n\n**2. The role of the non-Hausdorff property**\n\nIn a topological group, the separation axioms are related. If a group is $T_0$, it is also $T_1$ and Hausdorff ($T_2$). Since $G$ might not be Hausdorff, it might also fail to be $T_1$ and $T_0$.\n\nLet $H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ be the closure of the identity element $e \\in G$.\n*   $H$ is a closed normal subgroup of $G$.\n*   $G$ is Hausdorff if and only if $H = \\{e\\}$. Since $G$ is not necessarily Hausdorff, $H$ may be a non-trivial subgroup.\n*   The quotient group $K = G/H$ is a Hausdorff topological group. The quotient map $q: G \\to K$ is continuous and open.\n\n**3. Properties of the quotient group K**\n\nLet's analyze the properties of $K = G/H$:\n*   **Compact:** Since $G$ is compact and $q$ is a continuous surjective map, $K$ is compact.\n*   **First-countable:** Since $G$ is first-countable and $q$ is an open map, $K$ is first-countable. If $\\{U_n\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ is a local base at $e \\in G$, then $\\{q(U_n)\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ is a local base at the identity $eH \\in K$. Thus, $\\chi(K) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Hausdorff:** The quotient of a topological group by the closure of its identity is always Hausdorff.\n\nSo, $K$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n**4. Relating the weight of G to the weight of K**\n\nA key step is to understand the relationship between the topology of $G$ and the topology of $K$.\n*   Let $x, y \\in G$. The points $x$ and $y$ are topologically indistinguishable if and only if they belong to the same coset of $H$. That is, for any open set $U \\subseteq G$, $x \\in U$ if and only if $y \\in U$. This is equivalent to $\\overline{\\{x\\}} = \\overline{\\{y\\}}$, which for a topological group means $xH = yH$.\n*   This implies that any open set in $G$ is a union of cosets of $H$. If $U$ is an open set and $x \\in U$, then the entire coset $xH$ must be contained in $U$.\n*   Therefore, an open set $U$ in $G$ is completely determined by the set of cosets it contains, which is the open set $q(U)$ in $K$. Specifically, $U = q^{-1}(q(U))$.\n*   This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the open sets of $G$ and the open sets of $K$. A collection of sets $\\mathcal{B}_G$ is a base for the topology of $G$ if and only if the collection $\\{q(B) \\mid B \\in \\mathcal{B}_G\\}$ is a base for the topology of $K$.\n*   This directly implies that the minimum size of a base is the same for both spaces. Thus, we have the crucial equality:\n    $w(G) = w(K)$.\n\n**5. Finding an upper bound for the weight**\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the maximum possible weight of $K=G/H$. We know $K$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n*   A celebrated theorem by A. V. Arhangel'skii (1969) states that any compact, first-countable, Hausdorff space must have a cardinality of at most $\\frak c$ (the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n*   Therefore, we must have $|K| \\le \\frak c$.\n*   For any compact Hausdorff space $X$, it is a known result that its weight is less than or equal to its cardinality: $w(X) \\le |X|$.\n*   Applying this to our group $K$, we get $w(K) \\le |K|$.\n*   Combining these two results, we get $w(K) \\le \\frak c$.\n*   Since $w(G) = w(K)$, we conclude that $w(G) \\le \\frak c$.\n\nThis establishes $\\frak c$ as an upper bound for the weight of $G$.\n\n**6. Showing the upper bound is achievable**\n\nTo show that $\\frak c$ is the largest *possible* weight, we must demonstrate that a group $G$ with the given properties and with weight $w(G) = \\frak c$ can exist. This is done by construction.\n*   First, we need the existence of a suitable building block: a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group $K$ with weight $w(K) = \\frak c$.\n    *   Such groups are known to exist. For instance, a theorem by Arhangel'skii and Tkachenko guarantees that for any cardinal $\\kappa$ satisfying $\\kappa^\\omega = \\kappa$, there exists a compact, first-countable, connected abelian group of weight $\\kappa$.\n    *   The cardinal $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ satisfies this condition: $\\frak c^\\omega = (2^{\\aleph_0})^\\omega = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\omega} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n    *   Thus, there exists a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group $K$ with $w(K) = \\frak c$.\n    *   For such a group $K$, we have $|K| \\ge w(K) = \\frak c$ (since weight is at most cardinality for compact Hausdorff spaces) and $|K| \\le \\frak c$ (by Arhangel'skii's cardinality theorem). Therefore, $|K|=\\frak c$.\n\n*   Now we construct our group $G$.\n    *   Let $K$ be a group as described above, with $w(K) = \\frak c$ and $|K| = \\frak c$.\n    *   Let $H_0$ be any group with cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$. For example, the direct sum of $2^{2^\\frak c}$ copies of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   Give $H_0$ the indiscrete topology (where the only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and $H_0$). With this topology, $H_0$ is a compact topological group.\n    *   Define $G = K \\times H_0$ with the product topology.\n\n*   Let's check the properties of our constructed $G$:\n    *   **Topological Group:** The product of two topological groups is a topological group.\n    *   **Cardinality:** $|G| = |K| \\cdot |H_0| = \\frak c \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. This matches the given cardinality.\n    *   **Compactness:** $G$ is the product of two compact spaces, so it is compact by Tychonoff's theorem.\n    *   **First-countability:** The character of a product is the product of the characters (or supremum, for infinite products). Here, $\\chi(G) = \\chi(K) \\cdot \\chi(H_0) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot 1 = \\aleph_0$. So $G$ is first-countable.\n    *   **Non-Hausdorff:** The closure of the identity in $G$ is $\\overline{\\{e_K, e_{H_0}\\}} = \\{e_K\\} \\times H_0$, which is not a singleton. So $G$ is not Hausdorff.\n    *   **Weight:** The weight of a finite product is the sum of the weights. $w(G) = w(K) + w(H_0)$. The weight of $K$ is $\\frak c$. The weight of $H_0$ with the indiscrete topology is 1. So, $w(G) = \\frak c + 1 = \\frak c$.\n\nThis construction provides an example of a group $G$ that satisfies all the conditions of the problem and has a weight of $\\frak c$.\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that the weight of any such group $G$ must be less than or equal to $\\frak c$, and that a weight of $\\frak c$ is achievable. Therefore, the largest possible weight of the group is $\\frak c$. The cardinal $\\frak c$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$."
