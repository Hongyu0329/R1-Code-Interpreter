    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for the requested calculation.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Total Number of Electrons ($N_{elec}$)\n\nFirst, we identify the atoms in the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ and sum their electrons to find the total number of electrons in this neutral molecule.\n*   Carbon (C): 1 atom, 6 electrons/atom\n*   Hydrogen (H): 3 atoms, 1 electron/atom\n*   Silicon (Si): 1 atom, 14 electrons/atom\n*   Fluorine (F): 1 atom, 9 electrons/atom\n\nTotal number of electrons, $N_{elec} = (1 \\times 6) + (3 \\times 1) + (1 \\times 14) + (1 \\times 9) = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = 32$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Spatial Orbitals (Basis Functions, K)\n\nNext, we determine the total number of basis functions ($K$) provided by the 6-31G** basis set for this molecule. The number of basis functions corresponds to the number of spatial orbitals.\n\nThe 6-31G** basis set notation means:\n*   **6-31G**: A split-valence basis set. Core electrons are described by 6 primitive Gaussians. Valence electrons are described by two basis functions: an inner one with 3 primitive Gaussians and an outer one with 1 primitive Gaussian.\n*   **First `*`**: Adds a set of d-type polarization functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms.\n*   **Second `*`**: Adds a set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms.\n\nA careful point is that d-type functions can be represented by 5 spherical harmonics (5d) or 6 Cartesian functions (6d). Pople-style basis sets like 6-31G** traditionally imply the use of Cartesian functions, which is a common default in programs like Gaussian. We will proceed with this assumption.\n\nLet's count the functions for each atom:\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: The 6-31G part gives 2s functions. The `**` adds one set of p-functions (px, py, pz).\n    *   Number of functions = 2 (s) + 3 (p) = 5 functions.\n    *   For 3 H atoms: $3 \\times 5 = 15$ functions.\n*   **Carbon (C)** and **Fluorine (F)** (First-row heavy atoms): The 6-31G part gives 3s functions (1 core, 2 valence) and 2p function sets (2px, 2py, 2pz).\n    *   Number of s,p functions = 1(1s) + 1(2s) + 1(2s') + 3(2p) + 3(2p') = 9 functions.\n    *   The `**` adds one set of Cartesian d-functions (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz).\n    *   Number of d functions = 6 functions.\n    *   Total for C = $9 + 6 = 15$ functions.\n    *   Total for F = $9 + 6 = 15$ functions.\n*   **Silicon (Si)** (Second-row heavy atom): The 6-31G part describes the [Ne] core and the valence shell. Core(1s,2s,2p) + Valence(3s,3p split).\n    *   Number of s,p functions = 1(1s) + 1(2s) + 3(2p) + 1(3s) + 1(3s') + 3(3p) + 3(3p') = 13 functions.\n    *   The `**` adds one set of Cartesian d-functions.\n    *   Number of d functions = 6 functions.\n    *   Total for Si = $13 + 6 = 19$ functions.\n\nTotal number of basis functions, $K = 15 (\\text{for 3H}) + 15 (\\text{for C}) + 15 (\\text{for F}) + 19 (\\text{for Si}) = 64$.\nSo, we have $K=64$ spatial orbitals.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Formula for the Number of CSFs\n\nA full CI calculation considers all possible ways to distribute the $N_{elec}$ electrons into the $K$ spatial orbitals. For a closed-shell molecule like $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$, the ground state is a singlet state ($S=0$). The number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a system with $N_{elec}$ electrons, $K$ spatial orbitals, and total spin $S$ is given by the Weyl-Paldus formula:\n\n$N_{CSF}(K, N_{elec}, S) = \\frac{2S+1}{K+1} \\binom{K+1}{N_{elec}/2 - S} \\binom{K+1}{N_{elec}/2 + S + 1}$\n\nFor a singlet state ($S=0$), this simplifies to:\n\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{K+1} \\binom{K+1}{N_{elec}/2} \\binom{K+1}{N_{elec}/2 + 1}$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Number of CSFs\n\nWe plug our values into the formula:\n*   $K = 64$\n*   $N_{elec} = 32$, so $N_{elec}/2 = 16$.\n\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{64+1} \\binom{64+1}{16} \\binom{64+1}{16+1} = \\frac{1}{65} \\binom{65}{16} \\binom{65}{17}$\n\nTo perform this calculation with very large numbers, we can simplify the first part of the expression using the identity $\\frac{1}{n} \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{1}{k} \\binom{n-1}{k-1}$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{65} \\binom{65}{16} = \\frac{1}{16} \\binom{64}{15}$\n\nSo the formula becomes:\n\n$N_{CSF} = \\left( \\frac{1}{16} \\binom{64}{15} \\right) \\binom{65}{17}$\n\nNow, we calculate the values for the binomial coefficients:\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} = 67,861,734,444,055,360$\n*   $\\binom{65}{17} = 610,755,610,000,000,000$\n\nFirst, we perform the division by 16:\n*   $\\frac{1}{16} \\binom{64}{15} = \\frac{67,861,734,444,055,360}{16} = 4,241,358,402,753,460$\n\nFinally, we multiply this result by the second binomial coefficient:\n*   $N_{CSF} = 4,241,358,402,753,460 \\times 610,755,610,000,000,000$\n*   $N_{CSF} = 2,590,508,993,240,751,148,685,161,000,000,000$\n\nThis can also be written in scientific notation as approximately $2.59 \\times 10^{33}$.\n\n<<<2590508993240751148685161000000000>>>"
