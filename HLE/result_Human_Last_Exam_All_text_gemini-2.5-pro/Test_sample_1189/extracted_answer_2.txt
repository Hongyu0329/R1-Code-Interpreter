Let $f_m$ be the number of sets $T$ satisfying the conditions for a given $m$. The value of $f_m$ is determined by the following recurrence relation:
The base cases for the recursion are:
- $f_1 = 0$
- $f_2 = 0$

For $m \ge 3$, the recurrence relation is:
$f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( \binom{2^n - 1}{m-1} - f_{m-1} - (2^n - m + 1)f_{m-2} \right)$
