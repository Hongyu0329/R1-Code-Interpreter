    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct and Define the Question's Terms\n\n*   **\"How many\"**: The final answer must be a specific number.\n*   **\"Historical saints\"**: This refers to revered human figures from the biblical narrative (Old and New Testaments). In the context of Milton, a Protestant, this would not be limited to saints formally canonized by the Catholic Church but would include patriarchs, prophets, and apostles who are considered holy. This category excludes divine beings (God, the Son), angels (Michael, Gabriel), fallen angels/demons (Satan, Moloch), and allegorical figures (Sin, Death). It also implicitly excludes the main subjects of the epic, Adam and Eve.\n*   **\"Mentioned by name\"**: The character's proper name (e.g., \"Moses,\" \"Mary\") must appear in the text of the poem. A description (e.g., \"that Shepherd who first taught the chosen Seed\") or an allusion is not sufficient.\n*   **\"In Milton's Paradise Lost\"**: The search must be confined strictly to the twelve books of the epic poem *Paradise Lost*. It is essential not to confuse it with other works by Milton, especially *Paradise Regained*, where many more biblical figures are named.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a Strategy\n\nThe most reliable strategy is to perform a direct search of a scholarly edition of the *Paradise Lost* text for the names of major biblical figures who would be considered saints. We will check key figures from both the Old and New Testaments. The primary location for such names would be in Books XI and XII, where the Archangel Michael reveals future history to Adam.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the Search and Analysis\n\nWe will now check for the names of major biblical figures.\n\n**Old Testament Figures:**\n\n*   **Abel, Enoch, Noah**: The events concerning these figures (the first murder, the man who walked with God, the Flood) are described in Book XI, but none of them are mentioned by name. They are referred to as \"a Shepherd,\" \"one just Man,\" etc.\n*   **Abraham**: Michael narrates the call of Abraham in Book XII, referring to him as \"a righteous Man\" and \"this Patriarch.\" Despite his importance, a search of the text confirms that the name **Abraham** is never used.\n*   **Moses**: Moses is a central figure in Michael's narration in Book XII. He is described vividly as \"that Shepherd,\" \"Amram's son,\" and the \"great Law-giver,\" but a textual search reveals that the name **Moses** does not appear in *Paradise Lost*.\n*   **David and Solomon**: King David is described in Book XII as \"a royal bard\" and his successor Solomon as his \"wiser son,\" but neither is mentioned by name.\n*   **Japhet**: In Book XII, in a prophecy about the future expansion of the church to the Gentiles, the name of Noah's son **Japhet** is mentioned. The line reads: \"But from the Tents of **Japhet** shall enlarge...\" (Book XII, line 138 in the 1674 edition). As a patriarch saved aboard the Ark, Japhet fits the criteria of a historical saint.\n\n**New Testament Figures:**\n\n*   **Jesus/Christ**: The Son of God is a major character, but he is referred to by titles such as \"the Son,\" \"Messiah,\" \"the promised Seed,\" and \"the Redeemer.\" The personal names **Jesus** or **Christ** do not appear in *Paradise Lost*. (They appear frequently in *Paradise Regained*).\n*   **Mary**: She is described in Book XII as \"a Virgin,\" but her name, **Mary**, is never mentioned.\n*   **The Apostles (Peter, John, Paul, etc.)**: They are referred to collectively as \"disciples,\" \"the twelve,\" and \"fishermen,\" but none of the apostles are mentioned individually by their proper names.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Results and List Careful Points\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Allusion vs. Naming**: The most common mistake is to confuse a clear allusion with a direct naming. Milton almost always prefers epic periphrasis (descriptive substitution) for these figures.\n*   **Careful Point 2: *Paradise Lost* vs. *Paradise Regained***: Many figures absent from *Paradise Lost* (like Moses, Jesus, Christ, and John the Baptist) are named in *Paradise Regained*. It is crucial not to conflate the two poems.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Reliability of Sources**: Many summaries and online discussions incorrectly claim figures like Abraham or Moses are named. A direct check of a scholarly text is the only reliable method.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Definition of \"Saint\"**: The interpretation of \"saint\" as any revered biblical person (patriarch, prophet) is key. Under this definition, the patriarch Japhet qualifies.\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the text, only one individual who fits the description of a historical saint is mentioned by name.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$."
