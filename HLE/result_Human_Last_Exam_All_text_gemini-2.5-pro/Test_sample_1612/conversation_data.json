    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step 1: Define the MLB Triple Crown\nThe first crucial step is to understand that in Major League Baseball (MLB), there are two different types of Triple Crowns: one for hitters (batting) and one for pitchers.\n\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** A player wins the Batting Triple Crown by leading their respective league (American League or National League) in three key offensive categories in a single season:\n    1.  **Batting Average (AVG)**\n    2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n    3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A player wins the Pitching Triple Crown by leading their respective league in three key pitching categories in a single season:\n    1.  **Wins (W)**\n    2.  **Strikeouts (K)**\n    3.  **Earned Run Average (ERA)**\n\nThe question asks for the number of \"Triple Crown winners,\" which implies counting the total number of unique players who have accomplished either of these feats.\n\n### Step 2: List and Count the Batting Triple Crown Winners\nWe need to list every player who has won the batting Triple Crown and then count the number of unique individuals.\n\n**List of Batting Triple Crown Winning Seasons:**\n*   1878: Paul Hines (NL)\n*   1887: Tip O'Neill (AA - recognized as a major league)\n*   1894: Hugh Duffy (NL)\n*   1901: Nap Lajoie (AL)\n*   1909: Ty Cobb (AL)\n*   1912: Heinie Zimmerman (NL)\n*   1922: Rogers Hornsby (NL)\n*   1925: Rogers Hornsby (NL)\n*   1933: Jimmie Foxx (AL)\n*   1933: Chuck Klein (NL)\n*   1934: Lou Gehrig (AL)\n*   1937: Joe Medwick (NL)\n*   1942: Ted Williams (AL)\n*   1947: Ted Williams (AL)\n*   1956: Mickey Mantle (AL)\n*   1966: Frank Robinson (AL)\n*   1967: Carl Yastrzemski (AL)\n*   2012: Miguel Cabrera (AL)\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Some players, like **Rogers Hornsby** and **Ted Williams**, won the award twice. For counting the number of \"winners,\" they each count as one person.\n*   Two players won in the same year (1933), but in different leagues.\n\n**Count of Unique Batting Winners:**\nBy counting each distinct player from the list above, we get **16 unique Batting Triple Crown winners**.\n\n### Step 3: List and Count the Pitching Triple Crown Winners\nNext, we do the same for pitchers.\n\n**List of Pitching Triple Crown Winning Seasons:**\n*   1877: Tommy Bond (NL)\n*   1884: Old Hoss Radbourn (NL)\n*   1888: Tim Keefe (NL)\n*   1889: John Clarkson (NL)\n*   1894: Amos Rusie (NL)\n*   1901: Cy Young (AL)\n*   1905: Rube Waddell (AL)\n*   1905: Christy Mathewson (NL)\n*   1908: Christy Mathewson (NL)\n*   1913: Walter Johnson (AL)\n*   1915: Pete Alexander (NL)\n*   1916: Pete Alexander (NL)\n*   1918: Walter Johnson (AL)\n*   1920: Pete Alexander (NL)\n*   1924: Dazzy Vance (NL)\n*   1924: Walter Johnson (AL)\n*   1930: Lefty Grove (AL)\n*   1931: Lefty Grove (AL)\n*   1939: Bucky Walters (NL)\n*   1940: Lefty Gomez (AL)\n*   1945: Hal Newhouser (AL)\n*   1963: Sandy Koufax (NL)\n*   1965: Sandy Koufax (NL)\n*   1966: Sandy Koufax (NL)\n*   1972: Steve Carlton (NL)\n*   1997: Roger Clemens (AL)\n*   1998: Roger Clemens (AL)\n*   1999: Pedro Martinez (AL)\n*   2002: Randy Johnson (NL)\n*   2006: Johan Santana (AL)\n*   2011: Clayton Kershaw (NL)\n*   2011: Justin Verlander (AL)\n*   2020: Shane Bieber (AL)\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Many pitchers have won multiple times: **Walter Johnson**, **Pete Alexander**, and **Sandy Koufax** each won three times. **Christy Mathewson**, **Lefty Grove**, and **Roger Clemens** each won twice. They each count as one unique winner.\n*   The 2020 season was shortened due to the pandemic, but Shane Bieber's Triple Crown is officially recognized by MLB.\n\n**Count of Unique Pitching Winners:**\nBy counting each distinct player from the pitching list, we get **24 unique Pitching Triple Crown winners**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Triple Crown Winners\nTo find the total number of Triple Crown winners, we need to add the number of unique batting winners to the number of unique pitching winners.\n\n*   Unique Batting Winners: 16\n*   Unique Pitching Winners: 24\n\n**Careful Point:** We must confirm that no player has won both a batting and a pitching Triple Crown. A review of the lists confirms there is no overlap.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nTotal Unique Winners = (Unique Batting Winners) + (Unique Pitching Winners)\nTotal Unique Winners = 16 + 24 = 40\n\nThere have been 40 different players in MLB history who have won a Triple Crown (either batting or pitching).\n\n<<<40>>>"
