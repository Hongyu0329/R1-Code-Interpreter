    "An analysis of the user's request is as follows.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis of the problem\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison between two strings of the same length.\n2.  **Input Specifications:**\n    *   Two strings are provided as input.\n    *   Each string is on a separate line.\n    *   The strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n    *   The lengths are guaranteed to be equal and range from 1 to 100.\n3.  **Comparison Logic:**\n    *   Lexicographical comparison means comparing the strings character by character from left to right.\n    *   The comparison is case-insensitive, meaning 'a' should be treated as equal to 'A', 'b' to 'B', and so on.\n    *   The comparison stops at the first pair of characters that are different. If `char1` from the first string is less than `char2` from the second string, the first string is lexicographically smaller. If `char1` > `char2`, the first string is larger.\n    *   If the loop completes without finding any differences, the strings are considered equal.\n4.  **Output Requirements:**\n    *   Print \"-1\" if the first string is less than the second.\n    *   Print \"1\" if the first string is greater than the second.\n    *   Print \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n5.  **Memory Efficiency Constraint:** The core of the question is to devise a C program that uses the minimum possible memory for its variables and to calculate this amount (`m`) in bytes.\n\n### Careful Points for Implementation\n\n1.  **Handling Case-Insensitivity:** Before comparing characters, they must be converted to a uniform case (either both to lowercase or both to uppercase). The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is ideal for this.\n2.  **Minimizing Memory:** To make the program as memory-efficient as possible, we must avoid allocating unnecessary memory.\n    *   A naive approach would be to store both strings in two separate character arrays (buffers). For a maximum length of 100, this would require `char str1[101];` and `char str2[101];`. This is not the most efficient method.\n    *   A more memory-efficient approach recognizes that the input is a single stream (`stdin`). We must read the first string before the second one becomes available. This implies that we have to store the first string in a buffer.\n    *   However, we do not need to store the second string entirely. We can read the second string one character at a time and immediately compare it with the corresponding character from the buffered first string.\n3.  **Input Stream Handling:** When reading the first string using a function like `scanf(\"%s\", ...)`, it will read the characters of the string and stop at the first whitespace character, which is the newline `\\n` at the end of the first line. This newline character remains in the input buffer. Before we start reading the second string character by character, we must consume this newline character (e.g., with a call to `getchar()`).\n\n### Acquiring the final answer with step-by-step analysis\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown of the memory usage for the most memory-efficient C program:\n\n1.  **Buffer for the first string:** We need to store the first string. The maximum length is 100 characters. In C, a string is terminated by a null character (`\\0`), so the buffer must be of size `100 + 1 = 101`.\n    *   Variable: `char str1[101];`\n    *   Memory Usage: `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Loop Index:** To iterate through the buffered first string, we need an index variable. An `int` is the standard type for this.\n    *   Variable: `int i;`\n    *   Memory Usage: `sizeof(int)`. On typical competitive programming platforms (using a 32-bit or 64-bit system with a standard C compiler like GCC), `sizeof(int)` is **4 bytes**.\n\n3.  **Variable for the second string's character:** As we read the second string character by character, we need a variable to hold the currently read character. The `getchar()` function, which is suitable for this, returns an `int` (to handle the special `EOF` value).\n    *   Variable: `int char_from_str2;`\n    *   Memory Usage: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n4.  **Total Memory Calculation:** We sum the memory allocated for these essential variables. No other variables are strictly necessary to solve the problem. The result (`-1`, `0`, or `1`) is printed directly without being stored in a variable.\n\n    *   `m` = (memory for `str1`) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `char_from_str2`)\n    *   `m` = 101 bytes + 4 bytes + 4 bytes\n    *   `m` = **109 bytes**\n\nThis single-buffer approach is the most memory-efficient way to solve this problem under the given constraints and standard C programming practices.\n\n<<<109>>>"
