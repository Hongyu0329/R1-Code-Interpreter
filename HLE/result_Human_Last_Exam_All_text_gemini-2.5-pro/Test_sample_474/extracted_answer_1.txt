No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry is to send a visual signal to natural predators. The validity of the study hinges on whether human perception is a good proxy for predator perception, which it is not for several key reasons:

1.  **Different Visual Systems:** The main predators of bumblebees, such as birds, can see ultraviolet (UV) light, whereas humans cannot. Bumblebee color patterns often include UV signals. Therefore, two species that look similar to humans might look very different to a bird, invalidating the human-based similarity ranking.
2.  **Incomplete Data:** Standard field photographs do not capture UV reflectance, meaning the undergraduates are working with incomplete and potentially misleading visual information from an ecological perspective.
3.  **Different Cognitive Processing:** Predators learn to associate specific visual cues with a threat (a sting). Their perception is "tuned" to recognize this threat signal. Untrained humans have no such ecological context and will simply judge overall aesthetic similarity, which may not align with the specific features a predator uses for recognition.

In essence, this study would measure human-perceived similarity, not the predator-perceived similarity that is the selective force driving the evolution of mimicry. The resulting clusters would not reliably represent functional mimicry syndromes.
