    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all relevant chemical equilibria.**\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is placed in pure water, it can dissolve via two main pathways. Additionally, the autoionization of water contributes to the hydroxide concentration.\n\n1.  **Dissolution to form free ions (K_sp):**\n    Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al^3+(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)\n    K_sp = [Al^3+][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^(-27)\n\n2.  **Dissolution to form a complex ion:** The dissolved aluminum ions can react with hydroxide ions to form the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex. We can write this as an overall reaction starting from the solid.\n    Al(OH)3(s) + OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction, let's call it K_c, can be derived by combining the K_sp and K_f reactions:\n    K_c = K_sp * K_f = (5.3 * 10^(-27)) * (1.1 * 10^31) = 5.83 * 10^4\n    So, K_c = [Al(OH)4^-]/[OH^-] = 5.83 * 10^4\n\n3.  **Autoionization of water (Kw):**\n    H2O(l) <=> H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)\n    K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 * 10^(-14)\n\n**Step 2: Define Solubility (S).**\nThe molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)3 is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the saturated solution.\nS = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\n\n**Step 3: Establish the Charge Balance Equation.**\nFor any solution to be electrically neutral, the sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges. The ions present in the solution are H^+, Al^3+, OH^-, and Al(OH)4^-.\nCharge Balance: [H+] + 3[Al^3+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)4^-]\n\n**Step 4: Express all concentrations in terms of a single variable, [OH-].**\nTo solve the system, we express each concentration in the charge balance equation as a function of [OH-], using the equilibrium constants.\n*   From K_w: [H+] = K_w / [OH-] = 1.0 * 10^(-14) / [OH-]\n*   From K_sp: [Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^(-27) / [OH^-]^3\n*   From K_c: [Al(OH)4^-] = K_c * [OH-] = (5.83 * 10^4) * [OH-]\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the equilibrium concentration of [OH-].**\nSubstitute the expressions from Step 4 into the charge balance equation from Step 3:\n(K_w / [OH-]) + 3 * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) = [OH^-] + (K_c * [OH-])\n\nMultiply the entire equation by [OH^-]^3 to clear the denominators:\nK_w * [OH-]^2 + 3 * K_sp = [OH^-]^4 + K_c * [OH^-]^4\n\nRearrange this into a standard polynomial form. This is a quadratic equation with respect to [OH-]^2.\n[OH^-]^4 * (1 + K_c) - K_w * [OH-]^2 - 3 * K_sp = 0\n\nLet x = [OH-]^2. The equation becomes Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0, where:\n*   A = 1 + K_c = 1 + 5.83 * 10^4 ≈ 5.83 * 10^4\n*   B = -K_w = -1.0 * 10^(-14)\n*   C = -3 * K_sp = -3 * (5.3 * 10^(-27)) = -1.59 * 10^(-26)\n\nSolve for x using the quadratic formula, x = [-B ± sqrt(B^2 - 4AC)] / 2A. Since x must be positive, we only take the positive root.\n*   B^2 = (-1.0 * 10^(-14))^2 = 1.0 * 10^(-28)\n*   -4AC = -4 * (5.83 * 10^4) * (-1.59 * 10^(-26)) ≈ 3.70 * 10^(-21)\n*   The B^2 term is negligible compared to the -4AC term.\n*   x ≈ [sqrt(3.70 * 10^(-21))] / (2 * 5.83 * 10^4)\n*   x ≈ (6.08 * 10^(-11)) / (1.166 * 10^5) ≈ 5.22 * 10^(-16)\n\nNow, find [OH-]:\n[OH-] = sqrt(x) = sqrt(5.22 * 10^(-16)) ≈ 2.28 * 10^(-8) M\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the solubility (S).**\nNow that we have the equilibrium hydroxide concentration, we can calculate the concentrations of the individual aluminum species and sum them to find the total solubility.\n*   [Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3 = (5.3 * 10^(-27)) / (2.28 * 10^(-8))^3 ≈ 4.47 * 10^(-4) M\n*   [Al(OH)4^-] = K_c * [OH-] = (5.83 * 10^4) * (2.28 * 10^(-8)) ≈ 1.33 * 10^(-3) M\n\nTotal Solubility S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\nS = (4.47 * 10^(-4)) + (1.33 * 10^(-3))\nS = 0.000447 + 0.00133 = 0.001777 M\n\n**Step 7: Final Answer.**\nRounding the result to two significant figures, consistent with the given constants.\nS ≈ 1.8 * 10^(-3) mol L^-1\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to consider both the simple dissolution (K_sp) and the complex ion formation (K_f) because both Al^3+ and Al(OH)4^- contribute significantly to the total solubility.\n*   Ignoring either species would lead to a significant error.\n*   The charge balance equation provides the necessary mathematical constraint to solve for the unknown equilibrium concentrations.\n*   The autoionization of water (K_w) must be included, as the equilibrium pH is not 7 and is determined by the dissolution process itself.\n*   Solving the full charge balance equation is the most rigorous method and avoids making potentially invalid simplifying assumptions about which species or reactions are dominant.\n\n<<<1.8 * 10^-3>>>"
