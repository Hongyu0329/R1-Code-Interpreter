    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the structure of $\\Delta$ as a 2-category\n\nThe simplex category $\\Delta$ is described as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$. Let's break down what this means for our problem.\n\n*   **Objects (0-cells):** The objects are the finite ordinals, represented as sets $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for non-negative integers $n$. In our case, the objects are $[23]$ and $[37]$. These are totally ordered sets under the usual relation $\\le$.\n*   **Morphisms (1-cells):** A morphism $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is an order-preserving map, i.e., a function such that for any $i, j \\in [m]$, if $i \\le j$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$.\n*   **2-Morphisms (2-cells):** For any two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, there is a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$, denoted $f \\Rightarrow g$, if and only if $f(x) \\le g(x)$ for all $x \\in [m]$. Since for any pair $(f, g)$, there is at most one such 2-morphism, the hom-sets are posets, and $\\Delta$ is a \"locally posetal\" 2-category.\n\n### Step 2: Defining an internal adjunction in $\\Delta$\n\nAn internal adjunction from $[23]$ to $[37]$ consists of:\n1.  A pair of morphisms (1-cells): $f: [23] \\to [37]$ and $g: [37] \\to [23]$.\n2.  A pair of 2-morphisms: a *unit* $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\Rightarrow g \\circ f$ and a *counit* $\\epsilon: f \\circ g \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$.\n\nThe existence of these 2-morphisms translates to the following pointwise inequalities:\n*   **Unit condition:** $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]}(i) \\le (g \\circ f)(i)$ for all $i \\in [23]$, which simplifies to $i \\le g(f(i))$.\n*   **Counit condition:** $(f \\circ g)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [37]$, which simplifies to $f(g(j)) \\le j$.\n\nIn a locally posetal 2-category, the triangle identities that these morphisms must satisfy are automatically fulfilled. Therefore, an internal adjunction is simply a pair of order-preserving maps $(f, g)$ satisfying the two conditions above.\n\n### Step 3: Recognizing the structure as a Galois connection\n\nThe conditions on the pair of order-preserving maps $(f, g)$ are precisely the definition of a **Galois connection** between the posets $([23], \\le)$ and $([37], \\le)$. Specifically, $f$ is the left adjoint and $g$ is the right adjoint. The conditions $i \\le g(f(i))$ and $f(g(j)) \\le j$ are equivalent to the more common definition:\n$f(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le g(j)$ for all $i \\in [23]$ and $j \\in [37]$.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the adjunctions by counting adjoint maps\n\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by either its left adjoint or its right adjoint. Therefore, the number of adjunctions is equal to the number of possible left adjoint maps $f: [23] \\to [37]$, which is also equal to the number of possible right adjoint maps $g: [37] \\to [23]$. We can choose either to count.\n\n**Method 1: Counting Left Adjoints**\n\nA map $f: P \\to Q$ between posets is a left adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and preserves all existing suprema (joins).\n*   The poset $[23]$ is a complete lattice, so all suprema exist.\n*   For any non-empty subset $S \\subseteq [23]$, its supremum is its maximum element. Any order-preserving map $f$ between totally ordered sets preserves suprema of non-empty sets.\n*   The crucial case is the supremum of the empty set: $\\sup(\\emptyset) = 0$ (the bottom element in $[23]$). For $f$ to be a left adjoint, it must preserve this supremum.\n*   This means $f(\\sup(\\emptyset_{[23]})) = \\sup(f(\\emptyset_{[37]}))$.\n*   $f(\\sup(\\emptyset_{[23]})) = f(0)$.\n*   $f(\\emptyset_{[37]})$ is the empty set in $[37]$, and its supremum is the bottom element of $[37]$, which is $0$.\n*   Thus, the condition for $f$ to be a left adjoint is $f(0) = 0$.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of order-preserving maps $f: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $f(0)=0$. Such a map is defined by a non-decreasing sequence of values $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$:\n$0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\nSince $f(0)$ is fixed, we only need to choose the 23 values for $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, which has $38$ elements. This is a classic \"stars and bars\" problem of choosing 23 items from 38 with replacement. The number of ways is:\n$$ \\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\n**Method 2: Counting Right Adjoints (Verification)**\n\nA map $g: Q \\to P$ between posets is a right adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and preserves all existing infima (meets).\n*   The poset $[37]$ is a complete lattice, so all infima exist.\n*   Any order-preserving map preserves infima of non-empty sets.\n*   We must check the infimum of the empty set: $\\inf(\\emptyset) = 37$ (the top element in $[37]$).\n*   The condition is $g(\\inf(\\emptyset_{[37]})) = \\inf(g(\\emptyset_{[23]}))$.\n*   $g(\\inf(\\emptyset_{[37]})) = g(37)$.\n*   $g(\\emptyset_{[23]})$ is the empty set in $[23]$, and its infimum is the top element of $[23]$, which is $23$.\n*   Thus, the condition for $g$ to be a right adjoint is $g(37) = 23$.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of order-preserving maps $g: [37] \\to [23]$ such that $g(37)=23$. This is a non-decreasing sequence $g(0), \\dots, g(37)$:\n$0 \\le g(0) \\le g(1) \\le \\dots \\le g(36) \\le g(37) = 23$.\nWe need to choose the 37 values for $g(0), \\dots, g(36)$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$, which has $24$ elements. The number of ways is:\n$$ \\binom{24 + 37 - 1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37} $$\nUsing the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we have $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming our analysis.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$ is the number of such left (or right) adjoint maps.\n\n$$ \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\n<<<$ \\binom{60}{23} $>>>"
