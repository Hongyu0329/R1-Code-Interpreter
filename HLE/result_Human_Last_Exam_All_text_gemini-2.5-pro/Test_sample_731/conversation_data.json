    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group in question.**\n\nThe group is the semidihedral group of size 512. The semidihedral group of order $2^n$ is denoted by $SD_{2^n}$.\nSince the size is $512 = 2^9$, we are dealing with the group $G = SD_{2^9}$, so $n=9$.\nThe standard presentation of the semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ for $n \\ge 4$ is:\n$G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = e, srs^{-1} = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$\nFor our group $G = SD_{2^9}$, the presentation is:\n$G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^8} = s^2 = e, srs^{-1} = r^{2^7-1} \\rangle$\n$G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = e, srs^{-1} = r^{127} \\rangle$\nThe elements of this group are of the form $r^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$ and $r^i s$ for $0 \\le i < 256$. The total number of elements is $256 + 256 = 512$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the definition of a power subgroup.**\n\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $m$ such that $H$ is the image of the $m$-th power map, i.e., $H = G^m = \\{g^m \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\nIt is a known property that for any integer $m$, $G^m = G^{\\gcd(m, \\text{exp}(G))}$, where $\\text{exp}(G)$ is the exponent of the group $G$. The exponent is the least common multiple of the orders of all elements in the group.\nTherefore, to find all distinct power subgroups, we only need to compute $G^d$ for all positive divisors $d$ of the exponent of $G$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the exponent of $G = SD_{2^9}$.**\n\nWe need to find the orders of all elements in $G$.\n1.  **Elements of the form $r^i$**: The subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ is cyclic of order 256. The orders of these elements are the divisors of 256, i.e., $2^k$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, 8$. The maximum order is $o(r) = 256$.\n2.  **Elements of the form $r^i s$**: We compute the square of such an element:\n    $(r^i s)^2 = r^i s r^i s = r^i (s r^i s^{-1}) s^2 = r^i (srs^{-1})^i = r^i (r^{127})^i = r^i r^{127i} = r^{128i} = r^{2^7 i}$.\n    *   If $i$ is even, say $i=2k$, then $(r^{2k}s)^2 = r^{2^7 \\cdot 2k} = r^{2^8 k} = (r^{256})^k = e$. So, the order of $r^i s$ is 2 when $i$ is even.\n    *   If $i$ is odd, say $i=2k+1$, then $(r^{(2k+1)}s)^2 = r^{2^7(2k+1)} = r^{2^8k}r^{2^7} = e \\cdot r^{128} = r^{128}$. The element $r^{128}$ has order 2 (since $(r^{128})^2 = r^{256} = e$). This means $(r^i s)^4 = ((r^i s)^2)^2 = (r^{128})^2 = e$. So, the order of $r^i s$ is 4 when $i$ is odd.\nThe set of all possible element orders in $G$ is $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, \\dots, 256\\}$.\nThe exponent of $G$ is $\\text{exp}(G) = \\text{lcm}(1, 2, 4, \\dots, 256) = 256$.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the divisors of the exponent.**\n\nThe exponent is $256 = 2^8$. The positive divisors of 256 are $2^k$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$.\nThese are the 9 divisors: $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$.\nWe will now compute the power subgroups $G^m$ for each of these divisors $m$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the power subgroups $G^m$.**\n\nLet $m$ be a divisor of 256. The set $G^m$ is the union of two sets:\n$G^m = \\{ (r^i)^m \\mid 0 \\le i < 256 \\} \\cup \\{ (r^i s)^m \\mid 0 \\le i < 256 \\}$\nThe first set is $\\{r^{im} \\mid 0 \\le i < 256\\}$, which is the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{\\gcd(m, 256)} \\rangle = \\langle r^m \\rangle$.\n\nLet's analyze the second set, $\\{ (r^i s)^m \\}$, for each divisor $m$.\n\n*   **Case $m=1$**:\n    $G^1 = \\{g^1 \\mid g \\in G\\} = G$. This is our first power subgroup.\n\n*   **Case $m=2$**:\n    We need to compute $(r^i s)^2$. From Step 3, we know $(r^i s)^2$ is $e$ if $i$ is even, and $r^{128}$ if $i$ is odd.\n    So, $\\{ (r^i s)^2 \\mid 0 \\le i < 256 \\} = \\{e, r^{128}\\}$.\n    $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle \\cup \\{e, r^{128}\\}$. Since $r^{128} = (r^2)^{64}$, the element $r^{128}$ is already in $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    Thus, $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $256/2 = 128$. This is our second distinct power subgroup.\n\n*   **Case $m=4, 8, 16, \\dots, 256$ (i.e., $m=2^k$ for $k \\ge 2$)**:\n    In these cases, $m$ is a multiple of 4.\n    The order of any element of the form $r^i s$ is either 2 or 4.\n    Since the order of $r^i s$ divides 4, and $m$ is a multiple of 4, it follows that $(r^i s)^m = e$ for all $i$.\n    So, for $m \\ge 4$, the set $\\{ (r^i s)^m \\mid 0 \\le i < 256 \\}$ is just the trivial element $\\{e\\}$.\n    Therefore, for $m=2^k$ where $k \\ge 2$:\n    $G^m = \\langle r^m \\rangle \\cup \\{e\\} = \\langle r^m \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 6: List all distinct power subgroups and count them.**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the set of all power subgroups of $G=SD_{512}$ is:\n1.  $G^1 = G$ (order 512)\n2.  $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$ (order 128)\n3.  $G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$ (order 64)\n4.  $G^8 = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n5.  $G^{16} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$ (order 16)\n6.  $G^{32} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$ (order 8)\n7.  $G^{64} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n8.  $G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n9.  $G^{256} = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{e\\}$ (the trivial subgroup, order 1)\n\nThese 9 subgroups all have different orders, so they are all distinct. Any other power subgroup $G^m$ will be equal to one of these, since $G^m = G^{\\gcd(m, 256)}$ and $\\gcd(m, 256)$ must be one of the 9 divisors we have already considered.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly 9 power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n<<<9>>>"
