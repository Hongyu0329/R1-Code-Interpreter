The specific biochemical reaction that initiated the process was the direct, non-covalent binding of the causative drug molecule to a specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) protein on an antigen-presenting cell. This binding event alters the complex presented to T-cells, causing it to be recognized as foreign and triggering a massive, misdirected immune attack against the patient's own skin cells.
