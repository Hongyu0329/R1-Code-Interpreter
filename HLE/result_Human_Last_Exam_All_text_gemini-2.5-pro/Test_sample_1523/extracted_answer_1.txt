The inner product $(\phi, D_\phi)$ is given by the expression $\int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^3x \, \phi(x) [-\partial_\tau^2 - \vec{\nabla}^2 + m^2] \phi(x)$, which is equivalent to twice the free part of the Euclidean action, $2S_E^{(0)}$. In momentum space, this is expressed as $T \sum_{n} \int \frac{d^3k}{(2\pi)^3} (\omega_n^2 + |\vec{k}|^2 + m^2) |\tilde{\phi}(i\omega_n, \vec{k})|^2$, where $\omega_n=2\pi nT$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies.
