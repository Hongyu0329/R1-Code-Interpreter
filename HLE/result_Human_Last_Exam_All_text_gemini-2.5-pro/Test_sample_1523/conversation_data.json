    "This problem requires us to analyze a key component of the path integral in finite-temperature quantum field theory. We will break down the problem by first understanding the framework, then defining the objects in the question, and finally calculating the desired quantity.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks for the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` for a neutral scalar field `ϕ` within the functional integral representation of the partition function at finite temperature.\n\n*   **Finite-Temperature Field Theory:** This implies we are working in the imaginary-time formalism. Time `t` is analytically continued to imaginary time `τ = it`, and the path integral is performed over field configurations on a Euclidean spacetime manifold where the `τ` dimension is compactified to a circle of circumference `β = 1/T` (in natural units where `ħ=c=k_B=1`).\n*   **Neutral Scalar Field:** The field `ϕ(x)` is real (Hermitian at the quantum level) and Lorentz-scalar. Since it's a boson, it must obey periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction: `ϕ(τ, **x**) = ϕ(τ + β, **x**)`.\n*   **Functional Integral Representation:** The partition function `Z` is given by a path integral over all possible field configurations:\n    $Z = Tr(e^{-\\beta H}) = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n    where `S_E` is the Euclidean action.\n*   **Inner Product (ϕ, D_ϕ):** This notation typically represents a quadratic form in the field `ϕ`. The `( , )` denotes an inner product on the space of field configurations, and `D_ϕ` represents a differential operator acting on `ϕ`. This quadratic form is the core of the Gaussian part of the functional integral.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Euclidean Space:** All calculations are performed in Euclidean spacetime with metric signature `(+,+,+,+)`. The four-vector is `x = (τ, **x**)` and the Euclidean d'Alembertian is `□_E = ∂_μ∂^μ = ∂_τ² + ∇²`.\n2.  **Periodic Boundary Conditions:** The periodicity in imaginary time, `ϕ(τ, **x**) = ϕ(τ + β, **x**)`, is crucial. It ensures that boundary terms vanish during integration by parts and discretizes the energy (frequency) modes in the `τ` direction.\n3.  **Matsubara Frequencies:** The periodicity condition means that the field `ϕ` can be expanded in a Fourier series in `τ`. The allowed frequencies are discrete and known as Matsubara frequencies. For a boson, they are `ω_n = 2πn/β = 2πnT`, where `n` is an integer.\n4.  **Definition of the Inner Product:** The inner product on the space of real scalar fields is naturally defined by the integral over the Euclidean spacetime volume: `(f, g) = ∫ d⁴x_E f(x)g(x) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x f(τ, **x**)g(τ, **x**)`.\n5.  **The Operator D:** The operator `D` (denoted `D_ϕ` in the question) is the kinetic operator that appears in the quadratic part of the action.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The Euclidean Action**\n\nFor a neutral scalar field with mass `m` and a potential `V(ϕ)`, the Euclidean Lagrangian density is:\n$\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)(\\partial^\\mu \\phi) + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 + V(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\tau\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\vec{\\nabla}\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 + V(\\phi)$\n\nThe part of the action that is quadratic in `ϕ` (the \"free\" part) is:\n$S_E^{(0)}[\\phi] = \\int d^4x_E \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n\n**Step 2: Rewriting the Action and Identifying the Operator D**\n\nWe can rewrite the kinetic term using integration by parts:\n$\\int d^4x_E (\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 = \\int d^4x_E \\partial_\\mu(\\phi \\partial^\\mu \\phi) - \\int d^4x_E \\phi (\\partial_\\mu \\partial^\\mu \\phi)$\n\nThe first term is a total derivative. By Gauss's theorem, it becomes a surface integral. The integral over the spatial boundary at infinity vanishes as we assume fields decay at infinity. The integral over the temporal boundary `[∫ d³x (ϕ ∂_τϕ)]` from `τ=0` to `τ=β` also vanishes due to the periodic boundary conditions on `ϕ`.\n\nThus, $\\int d^4x_E (\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 = - \\int d^4x_E \\phi (\\Box_E \\phi)$, where `□_E = ∂_τ² + ∇²` is the Euclidean d'Alembertian operator.\n\nSubstituting this back into the quadratic action `S_E⁽⁰⁾`:\n$S_E^{(0)}[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E [-\\phi (\\Box_E \\phi) + m^2\\phi^2] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E \\phi(x) [-\\Box_E + m^2] \\phi(x)$\n\nThis expression is in the form $\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)$. By comparing, we can identify the operator `D` as:\n$D = -\\Box_E + m^2 = -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\vec{\\nabla}^2) + m^2$\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Inner Product**\n\nThe question asks for `(ϕ, D_ϕ)`, which we interpret as `(ϕ, Dϕ)`. Using our definition of the inner product and the operator `D`:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x) (D\\phi)(x) = \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x) [-\\Box_E + m^2] \\phi(x)$\n\nFrom our result in Step 2, we see this is exactly twice the quadratic part of the Euclidean action:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = 2 S_E^{(0)}[\\phi]$\n\n**Step 4: Momentum Space Representation**\n\nThis expression is often more useful in momentum space. We expand the field `ϕ` using the Matsubara frequencies:\n$\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) = T \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} e^{i(\\omega_n \\tau + \\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{x})} \\tilde{\\phi}(i\\omega_n, \\vec{k})$\nwhere `T = 1/β` and `ω_n = 2πnT`.\n\nIn momentum space, the differential operators become algebraic:\n*   `∂_τ → iω_n`\n*   `∇ → i**k**`\n*   The operator `D = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²` becomes multiplication by `(- (iω_n)² - (i**k**)² + m²) = (ω_n² + |\\vec{k}|² + m²)`.\n\nApplying this transformation to the inner product expression (or to `2S_E⁽⁰⁾`), and using Plancherel's theorem, we get:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = T \\sum_n \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} \\tilde{\\phi}(-i\\omega_n, -\\vec{k}) (\\omega_n^2 + |\\vec{k}|^2 + m^2) \\tilde{\\phi}(i\\omega_n, \\vec{k})$\n\nSince `ϕ` is a real field, its Fourier transform satisfies `\\tilde{ϕ}(-K) = \\tilde{ϕ}^*(K)`, where `K = (iω_n, **k**)`. The expression simplifies to:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = T \\sum_n \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} (\\omega_n^2 + |\\vec{k}|^2 + m^2) |\\tilde{\\phi}(i\\omega_n, \\vec{k})|^2$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` is a functional of the field configuration `ϕ`. It represents the quadratic part of the Euclidean action, which governs the Gaussian fluctuations of the field around the vacuum.\n\nIn position space, the expression is:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\left[-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\vec{\\nabla}^2 + m^2\\right] \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n\nIn momentum space, which makes the finite-temperature aspects explicit, the expression is:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = T \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} \\left( (2\\pi nT)^2 + |\\vec{k}|^2 + m^2 \\right) |\\tilde{\\phi}(i\\omega_n, \\vec{k})|^2$\n\nBoth expressions are equivalent representations of the same quantity. The momentum space version is particularly useful for calculations as it represents the kinetic operator `D` by its eigenvalues `ω_n² + |**k**|² + m²` on the momentum-space basis functions.\n\n<<<The inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is given by the expression $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(x) [-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\vec{\\nabla}^2 + m^2] \\phi(x)$, which is equivalent to twice the free part of the Euclidean action, $2S_E^{(0)}$. In momentum space, this is expressed as $T \\sum_{n} \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} (\\omega_n^2 + |\\vec{k}|^2 + m^2) |\\tilde{\\phi}(i\\omega_n, \\vec{k})|^2$, where $\\omega_n=2\\pi nT$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies.>>>"
