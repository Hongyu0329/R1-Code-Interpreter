    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Quadratic Field:** A field of the form `Q(√d)` where `d` is a square-free integer. If `d < 0`, it is an imaginary quadratic field. If `d > 0`, it is a real quadratic field.\n*   **Fundamental Discriminant (D):** Every quadratic field has a unique integer associated with it called the fundamental discriminant. For a field `Q(√d)` where `d` is a square-free integer:\n    *   If `d ≡ 1 (mod 4)`, then the fundamental discriminant is `D = d`.\n    *   If `d ≡ 2 or 3 (mod 4)`, then the fundamental discriminant is `D = 4d`.\n*   **Negative Fundamental Discriminant:** This means `D < 0`, which corresponds to imaginary quadratic fields.\n*   **Class Number (h(D) or h_d):** The class number of a quadratic field is the number of elements in its ideal class group. It is a fundamental invariant that measures the extent to which unique factorization fails in the ring of integers of the field. `h(D) = 1` means the ring of integers has unique factorization (it is a UFD).\n*   **Gauss Class Number Problem:** This is the problem of classifying and enumerating quadratic fields with a given class number. For imaginary quadratic fields, the problem is to find all negative fundamental discriminants `D` that have a specific class number `h`.\n\n**Step 2: Frame the Question Precisely**\n\nThe question asks for the number of distinct negative fundamental discriminants `D < 0` for which the class number `h(D)` is exactly 48. In set notation, we want to find the cardinality of the set:\n`{ D | D is a negative fundamental discriminant and h(D) = 48 }`\n\n**Step 3: Recall the History and Status of the Problem**\n\nThe Gauss class number problem for imaginary quadratic fields is a classic problem in number theory.\n*   **Class Number 1:** Heegner, Baker, and Stark proved that there are exactly 9 negative fundamental discriminants with class number 1.\n*   **Class Number 2:** Baker and Stark proved there are 18 with class number 2.\n*   **Higher Class Numbers:** For any given class number `h`, it is known that there are only a finite number of imaginary quadratic fields with that class number. Finding a complete list for a specific `h` requires sophisticated methods.\n*   **Complete Solution for h ≤ 100:** The problem of finding all negative fundamental discriminants for a given class number `h` has been completely solved for all `h ≤ 100`. The definitive work was done by Mark Watkins in his 2004 paper, \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields\". He rigorously proved that his computed lists were complete.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Solution from Established Results**\n\nSince this problem has been solved, the task is not to re-derive the result from first principles (which is a research-level task) but to look up the established, proven answer. The primary source is Watkins's work. His paper includes tables that list the number of fundamental discriminants for each class number up to 100.\n\nBy consulting Table 4 of Watkins's paper or a reliable database like the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS, sequence A006203), we can find the value for `h = 48`.\n\nThe result from these sources states that the number of negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48 is **173**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Fundamental Discriminant vs. Square-Free d:** The class number is a function of the discriminant `D`, not just the square-free integer `d`. The problem specifically asks for the number of *discriminants*.\n2.  **Imaginary vs. Real Fields:** The question is about *negative* discriminants, which correspond to imaginary quadratic fields. The class number problem for real quadratic fields (positive discriminants) is vastly different and much harder; it is conjectured that for any `h >= 1`, there are infinitely many real quadratic fields with class number `h`.\n3.  **Completeness is Key:** The most important point is that the lists for class numbers up to 100 are known to be *complete*. This is not a partial count or a conjecture. It is a proven mathematical theorem.\n4.  **Non-Triviality:** It's important to recognize that obtaining this number is not a simple calculation. It rests on deep theoretical results (like the Brauer-Siegel theorem and its effective versions by Oesterlé) and extensive, verified computation.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  The problem asks for the number of negative fundamental discriminants `D` with class number `h(D) = 48`.\n2.  This is a specific instance of the Gauss class number problem for imaginary quadratic fields.\n3.  This problem has been solved for all class numbers up to 100 by Mark Watkins.\n4.  According to Watkins's proven results, the number of such discriminants for `h = 48` is 173.\n\nThe final answer is therefore 173.\n\n<<<173>>>"
