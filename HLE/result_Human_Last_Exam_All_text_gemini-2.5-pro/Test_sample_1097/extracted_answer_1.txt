The set M is defined as $M = \{u \in C[0, 1] : u(0) = u(1) = 0 \text{ and } \|u\|_\infty \leq R\}$, where $\|u\|_\infty$ is the supremum norm and the constant $R>0$ is chosen to satisfy the two conditions: (1) $\frac{e^R}{8} < 1$ to ensure the operator is a contraction, and (2) $\frac{e^R}{8} \le R$ to ensure the set M is invariant under the operator.
