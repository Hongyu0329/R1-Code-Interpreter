    "This is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind, given by:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 K(x, y) u(y) dy$, with the kernel $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the kernel and convert the integral equation to a system of linear equations.**\n\nThe kernel can be expanded as a finite sum:\n$K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + x^{n-3}y^2 + \\dots + y^{n-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$.\nThis is a separable (or degenerate) kernel.\nSubstituting this into the integral equation:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k \\right) u(y) dy$.\nWe can swap the summation and integration:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy$.\n\nLet's define the unknown constants $c_k$ as the moments of the solution $u(y)$:\n$c_k = \\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy$, for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nWith these constants, the solution $u(x)$ must be a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}$.\n\nNow, we derive a system of equations for the constants $c_j$ by substituting the form of $u(y)$ back into their definition:\n$c_j = \\int_0^1 y^j u(y) dy = \\int_0^1 y^j \\left( 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k} \\right) dy$.\n$c_j = \\int_0^1 y^j dy + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\int_0^1 y^{j+n-1-k} dy$.\n$c_j = \\left[ \\frac{y^{j+1}}{j+1} \\right]_0^1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\left[ \\frac{y^{j+n-k}}{j+n-k} \\right]_0^1$.\n$c_j = \\frac{1}{j+1} + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_k}{j+n-k}$.\n\nThis can be written as a system of $n$ linear equations for the $n$ unknowns $c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}$:\n$c_j - \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{j+n-k} c_k = \\frac{1}{j+1}$, for $j = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nIn matrix form, this system is $(I - \\lambda A)\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$, where:\n- $\\mathbf{c} = (c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1})^T$.\n- $\\mathbf{b} = (1, 1/2, 1/3, \\dots, 1/n)^T$.\n- $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix with entries $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$ (with $j$ being the row index and $k$ the column index, both from 0 to $n-1$).\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Fredholm Alternative Theorem.**\n\nThe linear system $(I - \\lambda A)\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$ has no unique solution if the matrix $(I - \\lambda A)$ is singular, which means $\\det(I - \\lambda A) = 0$. This condition is equivalent to $\\det(A - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}I) = 0$ (assuming $\\lambda \\neq 0$). This means $1/\\lambda$ must be an eigenvalue of the matrix $A$. The values of $\\lambda$ for which this occurs are called the characteristic values of the integral equation.\n\nLet $\\mu$ be an eigenvalue of $A$. The corresponding characteristic value is $\\lambda = 1/\\mu$. For such $\\lambda$, the equation has either no solution or infinitely many solutions.\nThe Fredholm Alternative Theorem states that for a characteristic value $\\lambda$, a solution exists if and only if the forcing term $f(x)=1$ is orthogonal to all the solutions of the homogeneous adjoint equation.\nThe homogeneous adjoint equation is $\\psi(x) = \\lambda \\int_0^1 K(y, x) \\psi(y) dy$.\nA solution exists if and only if $\\int_0^1 f(x)\\psi(x)dx = \\int_0^1 1 \\cdot \\psi(x) dx = 0$ for all eigenfunctions $\\psi$ corresponding to $\\lambda$.\nIf this condition is not met for at least one eigenfunction $\\psi$, the equation has no solution.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the condition for the existence of solutions.**\n\nLet's find the structure of the eigenfunctions $\\psi(x)$. The adjoint kernel is $K(y,x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} y^{n-1-k}x^k$.\nThe adjoint equation is $\\psi(x) = \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k \\int_0^1 y^{n-1-k} \\psi(y) dy$.\nThis shows that $\\psi(x)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$.\nWe can show that the coefficients of the polynomial representation of $\\psi(x)$ form an eigenvector of the same matrix $A$. Let $\\psi(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} d_k x^{n-1-k}$. Substituting this into the adjoint equation leads to the eigenvalue problem $A\\mathbf{d} = \\mu\\mathbf{d}$, where $\\mathbf{d} = (d_0, d_1, ..., d_{n-1})^T$ and $\\mu=1/\\lambda$.\n\nThe condition for the existence of a solution becomes $\\int_0^1 \\psi(x) dx = 0$.\n$\\int_0^1 \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} d_k x^{n-1-k}\\right) dx = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} d_k \\left[\\frac{x^{n-k}}{n-k}\\right]_0^1 = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{d_k}{n-k} = 0$.\n\nNow, let's look at the first row ($j=0$) of the matrix equation $A\\mathbf{d} = \\mu\\mathbf{d}$:\n$\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} A_{0k} d_k = \\mu d_0$.\nThe entries are $A_{0k} = \\frac{1}{0+n-k} = \\frac{1}{n-k}$.\nSo, the first row equation is $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{d_k}{n-k} = \\mu d_0$.\n\nCombining the existence condition with this result, we get:\n$\\mu d_0 = 0$.\n\nThe matrix $A$ can be shown to be non-singular (it is a non-singular Cauchy matrix), so all its eigenvalues $\\mu$ are non-zero.\nThus, the condition for the existence of a solution for the characteristic value $\\lambda=1/\\mu$ is that for ALL corresponding eigenvectors $\\mathbf{d}$, the first component $d_0$ must be zero.\n\nThe equation has NO solution for a characteristic value $\\lambda=1/\\mu$ if there exists at least one corresponding eigenvector $\\mathbf{d}$ with $d_0 \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the properties of the eigenvectors of A.**\n\nLet's analyze whether an eigenvector $\\mathbf{d}$ of $A$ can have $d_0=0$.\nIf $d_0=0$, the eigenvalue equation $A\\mathbf{d}=\\mu\\mathbf{d}$ implies that $\\mu$ must be an eigenvalue of the principal submatrix $A^{(1)}$ (formed by removing the first row and column of $A$), and the eigenvector $(d_1, \\dots, d_{n-1})^T$ must satisfy the first row equation, which becomes $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\frac{d_k}{n-k} = 0$.\n\nIt is a non-trivial property of this specific type of matrix $A$ that for any of its eigenvalues $\\mu$, the corresponding eigenvectors must have a non-zero first component ($d_0 \\neq 0$). This can be shown by proving that the set of eigenvalues of $A_n$ and its principal submatrix $A_{n-1}$ are disjoint.\nFor $n=2$, the eigenvalues of $A_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1 \\\\ 1/3 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$ are $\\mu=1/2 \\pm 1/\\sqrt{3}$. The eigenvalue of $A_1 = [1/2]$ is $1/2$. The sets are disjoint. The eigenvectors of $A_2$ are proportional to $(\\pm\\sqrt{3}, 1)^T$, and their first component is never zero.\n\nSince for any eigenvalue $\\mu$ of $A$, any corresponding eigenvector $\\mathbf{d}$ has $d_0 \\neq 0$, the condition for existence of a solution ($\\mu d_0 = 0$) is never satisfied.\nTherefore, for every characteristic value $\\lambda = 1/\\mu$, the equation has no solution.\n\nThe problem is thus reduced to finding all characteristic values of the equation, which are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$.\n\nFor a general integer $n$, the explicit calculation of the eigenvalues of $A_n$ is complicated. However, the sum of the eigenvalues is the trace of the matrix:\n$\\text{Tr}(A_n) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} A_{jj} = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{j+n-j} = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{n} = n \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} = 1$.\nSo, if $\\mu_1, \\dots, \\mu_n$ are the eigenvalues of $A_n$, then $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\mu_i = 1$.\nThe values of $\\lambda$ for which there is no solution are $\\lambda_i = 1/\\mu_i$, and they satisfy $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{\\lambda_i} = 1$.\n\nFor $n=1$, $A_1 = [1]$, so $\\mu_1=1$. The only value is $\\lambda_1 = 1$.\nFor $n=2$, $A_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1 \\\\ 1/3 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$, the eigenvalues are $\\mu = 1/2 \\pm 1/\\sqrt{3}$. The values are $\\lambda = 1/\\mu = 1/(1/2 \\pm 1/\\sqrt{3}) = -6 \\mp 4\\sqrt{3}$. (Note: $-6+4\\sqrt{3} \\approx -6+6.928 = 0.928$ and $-6-4\\sqrt{3} \\approx -12.928$).\n\nThe question asks for \"the values\", which are the set of all characteristic values of the integral equation.\n\nThe values of $\\lambda$ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ with entries $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$ for $j, k \\in \\{0, 1, ..., n-1\\}$.\n\n<<<The set of reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ defined by $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$ for $j, k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.>>>"
