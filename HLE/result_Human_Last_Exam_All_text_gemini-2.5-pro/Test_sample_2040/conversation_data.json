    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core phenomenon: Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC).**\nSPDC is a nonlinear optical process where one photon of higher energy (the pump photon, frequency ω_p) spontaneously splits into two photons of lower energy (the signal photon, ω_s, and the idler photon, ω_i) within a nonlinear optical medium. This process must conserve both energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:** ω_p = ω_s + ω_i\n*   **Momentum Conservation (Phase Matching):** **k**_p = **k**_s + **k**_i\n\nCrucially, SPDC is a **second-order nonlinear optical effect**. The strength of this effect in a material is described by its second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, denoted as χ⁽²⁾ (chi-2).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit a second-order nonlinear effect.**\nA material can only have a non-zero bulk χ⁽²⁾ if its crystal structure is **non-centrosymmetric**. This means the crystal lattice lacks a center of inversion symmetry. In a centrosymmetric material (one with inversion symmetry), the induced polarization must reverse its sign when the direction of the applied electric field is reversed. A second-order response (proportional to E²) does not have this property, so its corresponding coefficient (χ⁽²⁾) must be zero by symmetry.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the crystal structure of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene).**\nBoron nanosheets, or borophene, are 2D allotropes of boron. Unlike graphene which has one stable structure, borophene is highly polymorphic, meaning it can exist in many different crystalline structures. The most commonly synthesized and theoretically studied forms of free-standing borophene include:\n\n*   **β₁₂-sheet:** This structure has a triangular lattice with a hexagonal pattern of vacancies. Its 2D space group is *Pmmn*.\n*   **χ₃-sheet:** This structure also has a triangular lattice with a different arrangement of vacancies. Its 2D space group is *Cmcm*.\n\nBoth of these common space groups (*Pmmn* and *Cmcm*) describe structures that **possess a center of inversion symmetry**. Therefore, they are **centrosymmetric**.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the properties of borophene to the requirements of SPDC.**\nSince the common, stable polymorphs of free-standing borophene are centrosymmetric, their bulk χ⁽²⁾ susceptibility is zero. A material with a zero χ⁽²⁾ cannot support spontaneous parametric downconversion as a bulk effect. Therefore, an ideal, defect-free, flat boron nanosheet would not be expected to exhibit SPDC.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Symmetry Breaking:** While the ideal crystal lattice is centrosymmetric, real-world factors could break this symmetry.\n    *   **Edges and Defects:** Inversion symmetry is inherently broken at any surface or edge. For a 2D material, the \"surface\" is the material itself, but local defects, vacancies, or specific edge terminations could act as local centers of non-centrosymmetry, potentially allowing for a very weak and localized χ⁽²⁾ response.\n    *   **Strain and Curvature:** Applying mechanical strain or the presence of ripples and wrinkles in the nanosheet can distort the lattice, breaking the inversion symmetry and inducing a non-zero χ⁽²⁾. However, this would be an extrinsic effect, not an intrinsic property of the ideal material, and the resulting SPDC would likely be weak and highly dependent on the specific morphology of the sample.\n    *   **Substrate Interaction:** The question specifies \"free-standing\" nanosheets. If the nanosheet were on a substrate, interactions with the substrate could also break the inversion symmetry.\n\n2.  **Metallic Character:** Borophene is known to be metallic or semi-metallic.\n    *   **High Optical Absorption:** Metals have a high density of free electrons, leading to strong absorption of light across a broad range of frequencies. The pump, signal, and idler photons involved in a potential SPDC process would be heavily absorbed. This high optical loss would make the efficiency of any nonlinear process, including SPDC, extremely low, rendering it practically unobservable. Efficient SPDC requires a medium that is transparent at the pump, signal, and idler wavelengths.\n    *   **Screening:** The free electrons would also screen the incident electric field, further reducing the efficiency of the nonlinear interaction.\n\n3.  **Higher-Order Processes:** Even though a χ⁽²⁾ process like SPDC is forbidden, higher-order processes are not. All materials, regardless of symmetry, have a non-zero third-order susceptibility (χ⁽³⁾). This allows for processes like Spontaneous Four-Wave Mixing (SFWM), which can also generate photon pairs. Therefore, while borophene is not expected to exhibit SPDC, it might be able to generate photon pairs via SFWM, although the metallic nature would still present a major challenge for efficiency.\n\n### Final Conclusion with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Question:** Would free-standing boron nanosheets exhibit SPDC?\n2.  **SPDC Requirement:** SPDC is a χ⁽²⁾ process, which requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n3.  **Boron Nanosheet Structure:** The common, stable polymorphs of borophene (e.g., β₁₂ and χ₃) are centrosymmetric.\n4.  **Primary Conclusion:** Due to their inherent crystal symmetry, ideal boron nanosheets have a χ⁽²⁾ of zero and therefore are not expected to exhibit SPDC.\n5.  **Practical Consideration:** Furthermore, the metallic nature of borophene would lead to high optical absorption and screening, making it a very poor candidate for an efficient SPDC process even if symmetry were broken by external factors like strain.\n\nTherefore, based on both fundamental symmetry principles and practical material properties, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n<<<No>>>"
