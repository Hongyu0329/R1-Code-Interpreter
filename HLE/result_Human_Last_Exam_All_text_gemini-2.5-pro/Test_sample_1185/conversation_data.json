    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Curve of Genus 2:** An algebraic curve whose arithmetic genus is 2. A smooth one is topologically a double torus.\n*   **Stable Curve:** A connected algebraic curve of arithmetic genus $g \\ge 2$ is called stable if its only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes) and its automorphism group is finite.\n*   **Stable Reduction:** For a family of smooth curves over a punctured disk, the stable reduction theorem by Deligne and Mumford states that after a finite base change, the family can be extended to a family over the whole disk whose central fiber is a stable curve. The \"type\" of stable reduction refers to the combinatorial structure of this resulting stable fiber.\n*   **Combinatorial Type:** The type of a stable curve is determined by its dual graph, where vertices represent the irreducible components (decorated by their geometric genus) and edges represent the nodes connecting them. Loops represent self-nodes on a component.\n\n**2. Key Formulas and Conditions**\n\n*   **Arithmetic Genus Formula:** For a nodal curve $C$ with $k$ irreducible components $C_1, \\dots, C_k$ and a total of $\\delta$ nodes, the arithmetic genus $p_a(C)$ is given by:\n    $p_a(C) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_a(C_i) + \\delta - k + 1$\n    Since the irreducible components of a stable curve are smooth, their arithmetic genus $p_a(C_i)$ is just their geometric genus $g_i$. The formula becomes:\n    $p_a(C) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} g_i + \\delta - k + 1$\n    We are interested in curves with $p_a(C) = 2$.\n\n*   **Stability Condition:** The finiteness of the automorphism group is equivalent to the following conditions on the irreducible components:\n    *   Any rational component ($g_i=0$) must have at least 3 special points (i.e., nodes).\n    *   Any elliptic component ($g_i=1$) must have at least 1 special point (i.e., a node).\n\n**3. Bounding the Number of Components**\n\nWe can derive a strong constraint on $k$, the number of irreducible components. Let $k_0$ be the number of rational components and $k_1$ be the number of elliptic components (components with genus $\\ge 2$ are not possible, as shown in the detailed analysis).\nFrom the genus formula for $p_a(C)=2$:\n$2 = k_1 + \\delta - (k_0+k_1) + 1 \\implies \\delta = k_0 + 1$.\nThe total number of special points (nodes) counted on all components is $\\sum n_i = 2\\delta$.\nUsing the stability condition, the sum of the minimum number of nodes is $\\sum n_i \\ge 3k_0 + k_1$.\nCombining these: $2\\delta \\ge 3k_0 + k_1$.\nSubstituting $\\delta = k_0 + 1$:\n$2(k_0 + 1) \\ge 3k_0 + k_1 \\implies 2k_0 + 2 \\ge 3k_0 + k_1 \\implies 2 \\ge k_0 + k_1 = k$.\nThis proves that a stable curve of genus 2 can have at most 2 irreducible components ($k \\le 2$).\n\n**4. Enumerating the Types Case by Case**\n\nWe now check all possibilities for $k=1$ and $k=2$.\n\n**Case 1: The curve is irreducible (k=1)**\n\nThe genus formula is $2 = g_1 + \\delta$.\n*   **Subcase 1.1:** If $\\delta=0$, then $g_1=2$. This is a smooth curve of genus 2. This is the \"good reduction\" type.\n    *   **Type 1:** One component of genus 2.\n*   **Subcase 1.2:** If $\\delta=1$, then $g_1=1$. This is an irreducible curve whose normalization is an elliptic curve, with one node. This is stable.\n    *   **Type 2:** One component of geometric genus 1, with one self-node (a loop in the dual graph).\n*   **Subcase 1.3:** If $\\delta=2$, then $g_1=0$. This is an irreducible rational curve with two nodes. This curve is not stable because its automorphism group is not finite (it has a $\\mathbb{G}_m$ action). So this is not a valid type of stable reduction.\n\n**Case 2: The curve has two components (k=2)**\n\nThe genus formula is $2 = g_1 + g_2 + \\delta - 2 + 1 \\implies g_1 + g_2 + \\delta = 3$.\nLet $\\delta_{int,i}$ be internal nodes on component $C_i$, and $\\delta_{ext}$ be nodes connecting $C_1$ and $C_2$. $\\delta = \\delta_{int,1} + \\delta_{int,2} + \\delta_{ext}$. The number of nodes on component $C_i$ is $n_i = 2\\delta_{int,i} + \\delta_{ext}$.\n\n*   **Subcase 2.1: ($g_1, g_2$) = (1, 1).**\n    $1 + 1 + \\delta = 3 \\implies \\delta=1$.\n    This means $\\delta_{ext}=1$ and there are no internal nodes.\n    Stability check: $C_1$ has $n_1=1$ node, stable. $C_2$ has $n_2=1$ node, stable.\n    *   **Type 3:** Two elliptic components connected by one node.\n*   **Subcase 2.2: ($g_1, g_2$) = (1, 0).**\n    $1 + 0 + \\delta = 3 \\implies \\delta=2$.\n    We need to check stability: $n_1 \\ge 1$ and $n_2 \\ge 3$.\n    Let's check partitions of $\\delta=2$:\n    - $\\delta_{ext}=2, \\delta_{int}=0$: $n_1=2, n_2=2$. $C_2$ is not stable.\n    - $\\delta_{ext}=1, \\delta_{int,1}=1, \\delta_{int,2}=0$: $n_1=3, n_2=1$. $C_2$ is not stable.\n    - $\\delta_{ext}=1, \\delta_{int,1}=0, \\delta_{int,2}=1$: $n_1=1, n_2=3$. Both are stable.\n    *   **Type 4:** An elliptic component connected by one node to a rational component which has one self-node.\n*   **Subcase 2.3: ($g_1, g_2$) = (0, 0).**\n    $0 + 0 + \\delta = 3 \\implies \\delta=3$.\n    We need to check stability: $n_1 \\ge 3$ and $n_2 \\ge 3$.\n    Let's check partitions of $\\delta=3$:\n    - $\\delta_{ext}=3, \\delta_{int}=0$: $n_1=3, n_2=3$. Both are stable.\n    *   **Type 5:** Two rational components connected by three nodes.\n    - $\\delta_{ext}=2, \\delta_{int,1}=1, \\delta_{int,2}=0$ (or vice-versa): $n_1=4, n_2=2$. $C_2$ is not stable.\n    - $\\delta_{ext}=1, \\delta_{int,1}=2, \\delta_{int,2}=0$ (or vice-versa): $n_1=5, n_2=1$. $C_2$ is not stable.\n    - $\\delta_{ext}=1, \\delta_{int,1}=1, \\delta_{int,2}=1$: $n_1=3, n_2=3$. Both are stable.\n    *   **Type 6:** Two rational components, each with one self-node, connected to each other by one node.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCounting all the distinct stable configurations, we find there is 1 type of non-singular (\"good\") reduction and 5 types of singular stable reductions.\n\nThe 6 types are:\n1.  A smooth curve of genus 2.\n2.  An irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 with one node.\n3.  Two elliptic curves attached at a single node.\n4.  An elliptic curve attached at one node to a rational curve that has a node of its own.\n5.  Two rational curves attached at three distinct nodes.\n6.  Two rational curves, each with one node, attached to each other at a single node.\n\nIn total, there are 6 different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2."
