    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the sequence**\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\n\n**2. List careful points**\n*   We need to find the underlying pattern or rule that governs the sequence.\n*   Common patterns include arithmetic progression (constant difference), geometric progression (constant ratio), or more complex recursive relationships involving multiplication, addition, subtraction, etc.\n*   Let's denote the terms of the sequence as `a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, ...`\n    *   `a_1 = 2`\n    *   `a_2 = 11`\n    *   `a_3 = 23`\n    *   `a_4 = 51`\n    *   `a_5 = 119`\n    *   We need to find `a_6`.\n\n**3. Step-by-step analysis**\n\n*   **Step 1: Check for a simple difference (Arithmetic Progression)**\n    *   `a_2 - a_1 = 11 - 2 = 9`\n    *   `a_3 - a_2 = 23 - 11 = 12`\n    *   `a_4 - a_3 = 51 - 23 = 28`\n    *   `a_5 - a_4 = 119 - 51 = 68`\n    *   The differences are 9, 12, 28, 68. There is no constant difference, so it's not a simple arithmetic progression.\n\n*   **Step 2: Check for a simple ratio (Geometric Progression)**\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = 11 / 2 = 5.5`\n    *   `a_3 / a_2 = 23 / 11 ≈ 2.09`\n    *   `a_4 / a_3 = 51 / 23 ≈ 2.21`\n    *   The ratio is not constant, so it's not a simple geometric progression.\n\n*   **Step 3: Look for a more complex recursive pattern**\n    *   The numbers are growing, so the pattern likely involves multiplication. Let's test patterns like `a_n = k * a_{n-1} ± C`.\n    *   Let's try multiplying by 2:\n        *   `2 * a_1 = 2 * 2 = 4`. To get to 11, we add 7. (`11 = 2 * 2 + 7`)\n        *   `2 * a_2 = 2 * 11 = 22`. To get to 23, we add 1. (`23 = 2 * 11 + 1`)\n        *   `2 * a_3 = 2 * 23 = 46`. To get to 51, we add 5. (`51 = 2 * 23 + 5`)\n        *   `2 * a_4 = 2 * 51 = 102`. To get to 119, we add 17. (`119 = 2 * 51 + 17`)\n        *   The added numbers are 7, 1, 5, 17. This sequence doesn't have an obvious simple pattern.\n\n    *   Let's try multiplying by 3:\n        *   `3 * a_1 = 3 * 2 = 6`. To get to 11, we add 5. (`11 = 3 * 2 + 5`)\n        *   `3 * a_2 = 3 * 11 = 33`. To get to 23, we subtract 10. (`23 = 3 * 11 - 10`)\n        *   `3 * a_3 = 3 * 23 = 69`. To get to 51, we subtract 18. (`51 = 3 * 23 - 18`)\n        *   `3 * a_4 = 3 * 51 = 153`. To get to 119, we subtract 34. (`119 = 3 * 51 - 34`)\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the pattern found in Step 3**\n    *   The pattern appears to be `a_n = 3 * a_{n-1} - l_{n-1}`, starting from `n=3`.\n    *   The sequence of subtracted numbers (`l`) is: 10, 18, 34, ...\n    *   Let's find the pattern in this new sequence `l`.\n    *   Find the difference between its terms:\n        *   `18 - 10 = 8`\n        *   `34 - 18 = 16`\n    *   The differences are 8, 16. This is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 2.\n    *   The next difference should be `16 * 2 = 32`.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the next term**\n    *   The next term in the sequence of subtracted numbers (`l`) will be `34 + 32 = 66`.\n    *   Now, we can apply the main rule to find the missing number in the original sequence (`a_6`):\n    *   `a_6 = 3 * a_5 - 66`\n    *   `a_6 = 3 * 119 - 66`\n    *   `a_6 = 357 - 66`\n    *   `a_6 = 291`\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\nThe sequence rule is `a_n = 3 * a_{n-1} - l_{n-1}` for n ≥ 3.\nThe sequence of subtracted values is `l = {10, 18, 34, ...}`.\nThe differences in the sequence `l` are `{8, 16, ...}`, which is a geometric progression with a ratio of 2.\nThe next difference is `16 * 2 = 32`.\nThe next value in `l` is `34 + 32 = 66`.\nTherefore, the next term in the original sequence is `3 * 119 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
