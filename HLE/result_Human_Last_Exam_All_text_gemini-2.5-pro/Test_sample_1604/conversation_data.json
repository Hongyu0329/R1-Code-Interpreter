    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the painter and her primary subjects.**\nThe painter is Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler (1846–1933). She was a famous British artist specializing in military scenes and battles. The question requires us to find the most recent (latest in history) battle that she painted, not the date she painted it.\n\n**Step 2: List Lady Butler's notable battle paintings and the historical events they depict.**\nWe need to compile a list of her works and identify the date of the battle or military event shown in each.\n\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted 1875): Depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras, which took place on **16 June 1815**.\n*   ***Scotland Forever!*** (painted 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo on **18 June 1815**.\n*   ***The Roll Call*** (painted 1874): Shows the aftermath of the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War. The battle occurred on **5 November 1854**.\n*   ***Balaclava*** (painted 1876): Depicts survivors of the Charge of the Light Brigade from the Battle of Balaclava, which was fought on **25 October 1854**.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880): Illustrates the Battle of Rorke's Drift during the Anglo-Zulu War, which occurred on **22–23 January 1879**.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!*** (painted 1898): Depicts an incident at the Battle of Laing's Nek during the First Boer War on **28 January 1881**.\n*   ***Tel-el-Kebir*** (painted 1885): Shows the charge of the Highland Brigade at the Battle of Tel El Kebir during the Anglo-Egyptian War on **13 September 1882**.\n*   ***The Camel Corps*** (painted c. 1890s): Depicts the Gordon Relief Expedition, specifically a scene from around the time of the Battle of Abu Klea on **17 January 1885**.\n*   ***In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards*** (painted in the 1920s): Shows a scene from the Great Retreat from Mons at the beginning of World War I in **August 1914**.\n*   ***The Charge of the Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, Egypt*** (painted 1917): Depicts the Action of Agagia during the Senussi Campaign of World War I, which took place on **26 February 1916**.\n*   ***A Canadian Battalion at a Halt on a Belgian Road, August 1917*** (painted 1917): This painting was a Canadian commission and shows a scene from World War I. The specific event is set in **August 1917**, during the Third Battle of Ypres (also known as the Battle of Passchendaele).\n\n**Step 3: Compare the dates of the depicted events.**\nLet's list the dates of the battles in chronological order to find the latest one:\n\n1.  Battle of Quatre Bras: **1815**\n2.  Battle of Waterloo: **1815**\n3.  Battle of Balaclava: **1854**\n4.  Battle of Inkerman: **1854**\n5.  Battle of Rorke's Drift: **1879**\n6.  Battle of Laing's Nek: **1881**\n7.  Battle of Tel El Kebir: **1882**\n8.  Battle of Abu Klea: **1885**\n9.  Retreat from Mons: **1914**\n10. Action of Agagia: **1916**\n11. Third Battle of Ypres (Passchendaele): **1917**\n\n**Step 4: Conclude with the final answer.**\nBy comparing the dates of all the historical events depicted in Lady Butler's paintings, the latest one is the scene from **August 1917**. This scene is part of the larger **Third Battle of Ypres (Passchendaele)** during World War I.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The question asks for the date of the historical event, not the date the painting was created. For example, *Scotland Forever!* was painted in 1881 but depicts the Battle of Waterloo from 1815.\n*   The term \"battle\" is interpreted to include specific actions, campaigns, and scenes from a war, as all the paintings depict military engagements or events within a conflict.\n*   It's important to consider Lady Butler's lesser-known later works, particularly her World War I commissions, as they depict more recent events than her famous Victorian-era paintings.\n\nThe latest battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the Third Battle of Ypres (Passchendaele).\n\n<<<Third Battle of Ypres (Passchendaele)"
