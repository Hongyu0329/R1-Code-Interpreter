    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the best known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Vector Space:** We are working in the vector space $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^8$. This space consists of all 8-tuples (vectors) where each coordinate is an element of $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$. The total number of points in this space is $3^8 = 6561$.\n*   **Cap Set:** A cap set is a subset of this vector space that contains no \"lines\". A line consists of three distinct points $x, y, z$ such that $x+y+z = \\vec{0}$ (the zero vector). An equivalent definition is a set of three distinct points of the form $\\{a, a+d, a+2d\\}$ for some vector $a$ and non-zero vector $d$. The size of a cap set is its cardinality (the number of points it contains).\n*   **The Question:** We are looking for $r_3(8)$, which is the maximum possible size of a cap set in $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^8$. Specifically, the question asks for the \"best known lower bound\" for this value. A lower bound is a number $L$ for which we can guarantee the existence of a cap set of size at least $L$. The \"best known\" means the largest such $L$ that has been established by a mathematical proof or construction.\n\n**Step 2: Establish simple lower bounds**\n\n*   A very simple construction for a cap set is to take all vectors whose coordinates are only 0s and 1s. This set is $\\{0, 1\\}^n$. If we take three distinct vectors $x, y, z$ from this set, their sum $x+y+z$ can only be the zero vector (modulo 3) if for every coordinate $i$, $x_i+y_i+z_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$. Since the coordinates are only 0 or 1, this only happens if $x_i=y_i=z_i=0$ or $x_i=y_i=z_i=1$. But this would mean $x=y=z$, which contradicts the assumption that the points are distinct. Therefore, $\\{0, 1\\}^n$ is a cap set.\n*   For dimension $n=8$, this construction gives a lower bound of $r_3(8) \\ge 2^8 = 256$. This immediately tells us that answers A (224), B (16), D (80), and E (45) are not the best known lower bounds.\n\n**Step 3: Use product constructions to improve the bound**\n\n*   A more advanced method is the product construction. If we have a cap set $C_1$ in dimension $n_1$ and a cap set $C_2$ in dimension $n_2$, their Cartesian product $C_1 \\times C_2$ is a cap set in dimension $n_1+n_2$. The size of this new cap is $|C_1| \\times |C_2|$.\n*   We can use the known maximum sizes of caps in smaller dimensions to build a bound for dimension 8:\n    *   $r_3(1) = 2$\n    *   $r_3(2) = 4$\n    *   $r_3(3) = 9$\n    *   $r_3(4) = 20$\n    *   $r_3(5) = 45$\n    *   $r_3(6) \\ge 112$ (This is the best known lower bound for dimension 6, found by computer search.)\n*   Let's try different ways to write 8 as a sum:\n    *   $8 = 4 + 4$: Lower bound $\\ge r_3(4) \\times r_3(4) = 20 \\times 20 = 400$.\n    *   $8 = 5 + 3$: Lower bound $\\ge r_3(5) \\times r_3(3) = 45 \\times 9 = 405$.\n    *   $8 = 6 + 2$: Lower bound $\\ge r_3(6) \\times r_3(2) \\ge 112 \\times 4 = 448$.\n*   This product construction yields a lower bound of 448. This is a significant improvement over 256.\n\n**Step 4: Consult the research literature for the best known bound**\n\n*   The simple product construction is not the only way to build caps. There are more sophisticated, often ad-hoc, constructions that can yield better results. To find the \"best known\" bound, we must refer to the specialized literature in combinatorics and finite geometry.\n*   The leading expert in constructing large cap sets is Yves Edel. His papers and surveys are the authoritative source for these records.\n*   In papers published since the year 2000 (e.g., \"On the existence of some caps in AG(n,q)\" by Bierbrauer and Edel, 2000, and later surveys by Edel), the best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is stated.\n*   These sources confirm that a specific, more complex construction (different from the simple product) yields a cap set of size 496. This result has been the record for over two decades. It is also listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A090245.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude and select the final answer**\n\n*   Our step-by-step analysis has shown:\n    1.  A trivial lower bound is 256.\n    2.  A simple product construction gives a lower bound of 448.\n    3.  The research literature reports a better, record-holding lower bound of 496.\n*   Comparing this with the given choices:\n    A. 224\n    B. 16\n    C. 512\n    D. 80\n    E. 45\n    F. 496\n*   The best known lower bound, 496, is listed as option F. Option C, 512, is $2^9$, which is not a known bound for dimension 8.\n\n<<<F>>>"
