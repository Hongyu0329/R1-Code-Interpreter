    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication of two Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrices.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the HSS Matrix Structure and its Representation\n\nA Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix is a rank-structured matrix defined by a recursive partitioning of its indices. This hierarchy is represented by a tree. The key idea is that off-diagonal blocks of the matrix can be represented in a compressed low-rank format.\n\nThe actual data stored for an HSS matrix is not the full matrix, but a set of smaller matrices called **generators**. A standard and computationally efficient set of generators for an HSS matrix includes:\n1.  **Dense diagonal blocks ($D_k$):** These are stored for each leaf node of the hierarchy tree.\n2.  **Basis matrices ($U_k, V_k$):** These form the bases for the row and column spaces of the low-rank approximations. In an efficient representation, the full bases are stored only for the leaf nodes.\n3.  **Translation matrices ($R_k, T_k$):** For internal nodes, translation matrices are stored. These operators allow the construction of bases at coarser levels from the bases of their children nodes, which is the essence of the \"nested basis\" property of HSS matrices.\n4.  **Coupling matrices ($B_{ij}$):** These matrices represent the interaction between sibling blocks in the hierarchy.\n\nThe question asks for the number of \"submatrices\" accessed. This is best interpreted as the total count of these elementary generator matrices for the two input matrices being multiplied.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the HSS Tree with Depth 4\n\nThe problem specifies a tree with **depth 4**. In standard computer science terminology, the depth of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf. We assume the root is at level 0.\n*   **Levels:** The tree has 5 levels of nodes, from level 0 (root) to level 4 (leaves).\n*   **Leaf Nodes:** The leaves are at level 4. For a full binary tree, the number of leaves is $N_{leaf} = 2^{\\text{depth}} = 2^4 = 16$.\n*   **Internal Nodes:** The internal nodes are all nodes that are not leaves. These are at levels 0, 1, 2, and 3. The number of internal nodes is $N_{int} = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15$. (Alternatively, $N_{int} = N_{leaf} - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15$).\n\n### Step 3: Count the Generator Submatrices for a Single HSS Matrix\n\nUsing the generator set defined in Step 1 and the tree structure from Step 2, we can count the number of submatrices for a single HSS matrix of depth 4.\n\n1.  **Dense Leaf Blocks ($D_k$):** There is one dense block for each of the 16 leaf nodes.\n    *   Count = $N_{leaf} = 16$.\n2.  **Leaf Basis Matrices ($U_k, V_k$):** There is one pair of basis matrices ($U_k, V_k$) for each of the 16 leaf nodes.\n    *   Count = $2 \\times N_{leaf} = 2 \\times 16 = 32$.\n3.  **Translation Matrices ($R_k, T_k$):** There is one pair of translation matrices ($R_k, T_k$) for each of the 15 internal nodes.\n    *   Count = $2 \\times N_{int} = 2 \\times 15 = 30$.\n4.  **Coupling Matrices ($B_{ij}$):** Each of the 15 internal nodes is a parent to a pair of sibling children. The interaction between these siblings requires two coupling matrices ($B_{c_1,c_2}$ and $B_{c_2,c_1}$).\n    *   Count = $2 \\times N_{int} = 2 \\times 15 = 30$.\n\nThe total number of generator submatrices for one HSS matrix is the sum of these counts:\nTotal Submatrices = $16 (D) + 32 (U,V) + 30 (R,T) + 30 (B) = 108$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Submatrices Accessed During Multiplication\n\nThe HSS matrix-matrix multiplication algorithm, $C = A \\times B$, computes the HSS generators for the resulting matrix $C$. To do this, it must perform operations that involve all the elementary generators of the input matrices, $A$ and $B$. Therefore, the algorithm must \"access\" (i.e., read from memory) all the generators of both $A$ and $B$.\n\n*   Number of submatrices for matrix A = 108.\n*   Number of submatrices for matrix B = 108.\n\nTotal number of submatrices accessed = (Submatrices in A) + (Submatrices in B)\nTotal Accessed = $108 + 108 = 216$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{216}$.\n\n<<<216>>>"
