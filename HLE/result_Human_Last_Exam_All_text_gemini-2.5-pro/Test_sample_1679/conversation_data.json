    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core components of the question.**\nThe question asks for a specific film that meets three criteria:\n1.  It must have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n2.  It must depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n3.  Among all films that meet the first two criteria, it must be the earliest one.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Luxor Obelisks and their locations.**\nThere are two famous obelisks originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n*   One obelisk remains standing at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   The second obelisk was gifted to France in the 19th century and now stands at the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\nTherefore, the film in question could be set in either Luxor or Paris.\n\n**Step 3: Chronologically review Best Picture winners for relevant settings.**\nWe will search the list of Best Picture winners, starting from the first award ceremony, looking for films set in Egypt (specifically Luxor) or Paris.\n\n*   **Search for films set in Egypt:** A review of Best Picture winners reveals no films that are set in ancient or modern Luxor and show the temple. While films like *Lawrence of Arabia* (1962 winner) are set in the Middle East, they do not feature scenes at the Luxor Temple.\n*   **Search for films set in Paris:** Several Best Picture winners are set in Paris. We must examine them in chronological order.\n    *   ***The Life of Emile Zola*** **(1937):** This film is set in late 19th-century Paris. While it is a plausible candidate, the film's action primarily takes place in interiors like courtrooms and offices. There are no prominent, establishing shots of the Place de la Concorde that include the obelisk.\n    *   ***An American in Paris*** **(1951):** This musical is famous for its extensive and artistic depiction of Paris. The film's 17-minute climactic ballet sequence features a dreamlike journey through stylized Parisian locations. One of these major sequences is set in a recreation of the Place de la Concorde, where the Luxor Obelisk is clearly and centrally depicted. This is a confirmed depiction.\n    *   ***Around the World in 80 Days*** **(1956):** This film features a sequence where the main characters fly over Paris in a hot air balloon. During this journey, there are clear aerial shots of the city's landmarks, including a distinct view of the Place de la Concorde with the obelisk at its center. This is also a confirmed depiction.\n    *   ***Gigi*** **(1958):** Another musical set in Paris, this film also includes on-location filming and shots that feature the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the first film among the candidates.**\nWe have three confirmed films that won Best Picture and depict the Paris Luxor Obelisk. We need to find the earliest one.\n*   *An American in Paris* won for the year **1951**.\n*   *Around the World in 80 Days* won for the year **1956**.\n*   *Gigi* won for the year **1958**.\n\nComparing the dates, *An American in Paris* is the first among these winners.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\nThe first Academy Award winner for Best Picture to feature a Luxor Obelisk on-screen is *An American in Paris*, which won for the year 1951 and prominently displayed the obelisk located in the Place de la Concorde, Paris.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
