    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of the generalized Markov number and its associated continued fraction.**\n\nThe generalized Markov numbers, denoted \\( m_{p/q} \\), are part of a theory that connects rational numbers to quadratic irrationals via their continued fractions. For a given rational number \\( p/q \\) (where \\( 0 < p/q < 1 \\)), the \"associated continued fraction\" is not the continued fraction of the number \\( m_{p/q} \\) itself, but rather the continued fraction of a specific quadratic irrational number from which \\( m_{p/q} \\) is derived.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n1.  Find the regular continued fraction of the rational number \\( p/q \\). Let's say it is \\( [0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n] \\).\n2.  From this sequence of coefficients \\( (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\), construct a new, palindromic sequence by concatenating the original sequence with its reverse: \\( (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n, a_n, \\dots, a_2, a_1) \\).\n3.  The \"continued fraction associated with \\( m_{p/q} \\)\" is the purely periodic continued fraction whose repeating block (period) is this new palindromic sequence.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the continued fraction of the rational number \\( 4/7 \\).**\n\nWe use the Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients \\( a_i \\) for the continued fraction of \\( 4/7 \\).\n\n*   Start with \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\). Since it is less than 1, the first coefficient \\( a_0 \\) is 0. We then take the reciprocal: \\( \\frac{7}{4} \\).\n*   \\( \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} \\). So, the next coefficient \\( a_1 \\) is 1. We take the reciprocal of the remainder: \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n*   \\( \\frac{4}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\). So, the next coefficient \\( a_2 \\) is 1. We take the reciprocal of the remainder: \\( \\frac{3}{1} \\).\n*   \\( \\frac{3}{1} = 3 \\). So, the last coefficient \\( a_3 \\) is 3. The algorithm terminates.\n\nThus, the continued fraction for \\( 4/7 \\) is \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\). The sequence of coefficients (after \\( a_0 \\)) is \\( (a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 1, 3) \\).\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly apply the Euclidean algorithm to get the sequence of coefficients. A miscalculation here would lead to an incorrect final answer.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the palindromic period.**\n\nThe sequence of coefficients for \\( 4/7 \\) is \\( (1, 1, 3) \\). We form the palindrome by writing this sequence followed by its reverse.\n\n*   Original sequence: \\( (1, 1, 3) \\)\n*   Reversed sequence: \\( (3, 1, 1) \\)\n*   Palindromic sequence (period): \\( (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1) \\)\n\n**Careful Point:** The palindromic sequence is formed as \\( (a_1, \\dots, a_n, a_n, \\dots, a_1) \\), not \\( (a_1, \\dots, a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_1) \\). The last element \\(a_n\\) is repeated.\n\n**Step 4: Write down the associated continued fraction.**\n\nThe continued fraction associated with \\( m_{4/7} \\) is the purely periodic continued fraction with the period we found in the previous step. A purely periodic continued fraction is denoted by placing a bar (vinculum) over the repeating block.\n\nTherefore, the continued fraction is \\( [\\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}] \\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is the expression for the continued fraction.\n\n<<<[\\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}]>>>"
