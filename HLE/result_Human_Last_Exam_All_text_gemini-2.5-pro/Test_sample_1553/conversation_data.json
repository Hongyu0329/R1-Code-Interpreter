    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core elements of the question:** The question asks for the name of the person whom the main character of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) marries.\n2.  **Identify the main character:** The protagonist of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski, a human from the 21st century who is resurrected in the distant future.\n3.  **Analyze the main character's key relationships:** Upon his resurrection, Adam Zamoyski is assigned a guide and protector. This guide is a post-human entity known as a \"phoebe\" (pl. \"feby\"). Her name is Angelina.\n4.  **Trace the development of their relationship:** The relationship between Adam and Angelina is central to the plot. It evolves from one of dependency and guidance into a deep, complex, and intimate bond that bridges the gap between old humanity and the post-human civilization.\n5.  **Confirm the marriage event:** This bond is formally solidified in the novel when Adam Zamoyski and Angelina get married. Their wedding is a significant event, representing a symbolic and literal union of two different stages of human evolution.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Author's Name:** The user spelled the author's name as \"Jacek Duke,\" but the correct spelling is Jacek Dukaj. This is a minor point as the novel's title is specific enough to identify the work.\n*   **Concept of Marriage:** In the far-future setting of the novel, the concept and ceremony of marriage might differ from our contemporary understanding, but the text explicitly refers to the event as a marriage.\n*   **Character Identification:** While there are many complex characters, Angelina is the primary female character connected to the protagonist, Adam Zamoyski, in this romantic and formal context.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the plot of the novel, the main character, Adam Zamoyski, marries his guide and companion, the post-human Angelina.\n\n<<<Angelina>>>"
