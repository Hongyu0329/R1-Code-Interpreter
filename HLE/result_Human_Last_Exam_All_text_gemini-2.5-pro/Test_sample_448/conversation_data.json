    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring ones on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n(Oganesson is a synthetic element and does not exist naturally on Earth, so it is not a candidate).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Scope of the Question**\nThe question asks for the rarest gas as a \"percentage of all terrestrial matter\". This means we must consider the total amount of each gas in the entire Earth (atmosphere, crust, mantle, core), not just its concentration in the atmosphere. The year \"2002\" is specified, but the relative abundances of these elements do not change on such short timescales, so data from the general modern era is applicable.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Abundances of the Stable Noble Gases**\nFirst, let's consider the stable (non-radioactive or very long-lived) noble gases: He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe. Their primary reservoir on Earth is the atmosphere.\n*   **Atmospheric Abundance (by volume):**\n    *   Argon (Ar): ~0.934%\n    *   Neon (Ne): ~0.0018%\n    *   Helium (He): ~0.00052%\n    *   Krypton (Kr): ~0.00011%\n    *   Xenon (Xe): ~0.000009%\n\nBased on atmospheric concentration, Xenon is the rarest of the stable noble gases. This trend generally holds when considering the Earth's crust and mantle as well.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the Radioactive Noble Gas, Radon (Rn)**\nRadon is different from the others because it is radioactive and has a very short half-life (the most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days).\n*   **Source:** Radon is not a primordial element left over from Earth's formation. It is continuously generated from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium, which are found in the Earth's crust and mantle.\n*   **Abundance:** Because it decays so quickly, Radon does not accumulate. It exists in a state of \"secular equilibrium,\" where its rate of creation is balanced by its rate of decay. This results in an extremely small total amount of Radon being present on the entire planet at any given moment.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Rarest Stable Gas (Xenon) with Radon**\nTo find the absolute rarest, we must compare the total amount of Xenon to the total amount of Radon.\n*   **Total Mass of Xenon:** The total mass of Xenon in Earth's atmosphere is estimated to be about 160 billion kilograms (1.6 x 10^11 kg).\n*   **Total Mass of Radon:** The total mass of Radon in the entire atmosphere is estimated to be only about 40 kilograms. Even including the Radon in the soil, groundwater, and crust, the total amount on the planet at any one time is estimated to be in the range of thousands of kilograms.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe total amount of Radon on Earth at any given time is many orders of magnitude smaller than the total amount of Xenon. Therefore, as a percentage of all terrestrial matter, Radon is by far the rarest noble gas.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
