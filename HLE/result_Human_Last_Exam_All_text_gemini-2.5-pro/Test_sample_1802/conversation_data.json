    "Answering this question requires analyzing the structure of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel.\n\n### Step 1: Define a Pauli Channel\n\nA qudit is a $d$-dimensional quantum system. Its state is described by a $d \\times d$ density matrix $\\rho$. The generalized Pauli operators for a qudit system, denoted as $\\{U_i\\}_{i=1}^{d^2}$, form a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. A common choice is the set of Weyl-Heisenberg operators $U_{k,l} = X_k Z_l$ for $k,l \\in \\{0, 1, ..., d-1\\}$, where $X_k$ are the shift operators and $Z_l$ are the phase operators. These operators are unitary and orthogonal with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product: $\\text{Tr}(U_i^\\dagger U_j) = d \\delta_{ij}$.\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel that applies a random Pauli operator to the input state. Its action on a density matrix $\\rho$ is given by:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{i=1}^{d^2} p_i U_i \\rho U_i^\\dagger $$\nwhere $\\{p_i\\}$ is a probability distribution, i.e., $p_i \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_i p_i = 1$. The operators $A_i = \\sqrt{p_i} U_i$ are the Kraus operators of the channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Complementary Channel and its Rank\n\nAny quantum channel $\\Lambda$ from a system $A$ to a system $B$ can be described by a Stinespring dilation, which involves an isometry $V: \\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_B \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ and an environment system $E$. The channel is given by $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$. The complementary channel $\\Lambda^c: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ is defined by tracing over the other system: $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_B(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$.\n\nUsing the Kraus operators $\\{A_i\\}$ of $\\Lambda$, the complementary channel's output is a matrix whose elements are given by:\n$$ (\\Lambda^c(\\rho))_{ij} = \\text{Tr}(A_j^\\dagger A_i \\rho) $$\nThe environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$ has a dimension at least equal to the number of non-zero Kraus operators.\n\nThe \"rank\" of a channel typically refers to its Choi rank (or Kraus rank), which is the rank of its Choi-JamioÅ‚kowski matrix $J(\\Lambda^c)$. The question asks for the maximal rank, which means we must maximize this rank over all possible Pauli channels, i.e., all choices of the probability distribution $\\{p_i\\}$.\n\n### Step 3: Construct the Choi Matrix of the Complementary Channel\n\nThe Choi matrix of a channel $\\Phi: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_B)$ is given by $J(\\Phi) = (I_A \\otimes \\Phi)(|\\Omega\\rangle\\langle\\Omega|)$, where $|\\Omega\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_A}} \\sum_{k=0}^{d_A-1} |k\\rangle_A |k\\rangle_{A'}$. For the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$, the input system is $\\mathcal{H}_d$ and the output system is the environment $\\mathcal{H}_E$, which can have a dimension up to $d^2$. The Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda^c)$ is an operator on $\\mathcal{H}_{A'} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$. Its matrix elements are given by:\n$$ J(\\Lambda^c)_{k\\alpha, l\\beta} = (\\Lambda^c(|k\\rangle\\langle l|))_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\text{Tr}(A_\\beta^\\dagger A_\\alpha |k\\rangle\\langle l|) = \\langle l| A_\\beta^\\dagger A_\\alpha |k\\rangle $$\nSubstituting $A_i = \\sqrt{p_i} U_i$:\n$$ J(\\Lambda^c)_{k\\alpha, l\\beta} = \\sqrt{p_\\alpha p_\\beta} \\langle l| U_\\beta^\\dagger U_\\alpha |k\\rangle $$\nHere, $(k,l)$ are indices for the $d \\times d$ input space matrix, and $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ are indices for the environment space matrix, which can be up to $d^2 \\times d^2$.\n\n### Step 4: Maximize the Rank\n\nTo maximize the rank of $J(\\Lambda^c)$, we should make it as \"non-degenerate\" as possible. This suggests that we should include as many Kraus operators as possible, i.e., have $p_i > 0$ for all $i=1, ..., d^2$. A natural choice that exhibits high symmetry is the completely depolarizing channel, where all probabilities are equal: $p_i = 1/d^2$ for all $i$. In this case, the Kraus operators are $A_i = \\frac{1}{d} U_i$.\n\nFor the completely depolarizing channel, the Choi matrix of its complementary channel is:\n$$ J(\\mathcal{D}^c)_{k\\alpha, l\\beta} = \\frac{1}{d^2} \\langle l| U_\\beta^\\dagger U_\\alpha |k\\rangle $$\nThis is a $d \\cdot d^2 \\times d \\cdot d^2$ matrix. We need to find its rank.\n\nThis matrix can be represented as a block matrix:\n$$ J(\\mathcal{D}^c) = \\frac{1}{d^2} \\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta=1}^{d^2} (U_\\beta^\\dagger U_\\alpha)^T \\otimes |\\alpha\\rangle\\langle\\beta| $$\nThe rank of this specific matrix is a known result in quantum information theory. It can be shown that this matrix is invertible if viewed as a map on a specific subspace, and its rank is $d^2$.\n\nLet's briefly justify this. The rank of $J(\\mathcal{D}^c)$ equals the rank of the matrix $K$ with entries $K_{(\\alpha, k), (\\beta, l)} = \\langle k | U_\\alpha^\\dagger U_\\beta | l \\rangle$. This is the Gram matrix of the $d^2 \\times d$ vectors $|\\psi_{\\beta,l}\\rangle = U_\\beta |l\\rangle$. The set of vectors $\\{U_\\beta |l\\rangle\\}_{\\beta=1,...,d^2; l=0,...,d-1}$ spans a space of dimension $d^2$. This is because for a fixed $|l\\rangle$, the set $\\{U_\\beta |l\\rangle\\}_{\\beta}$ spans the whole space $\\mathcal{H}_d$. By choosing $d$ linearly independent vectors $|l\\rangle$, we can form $d$ sets of basis vectors, and the total dimension of the span is $d \\times d = d^2$.\n\nAny other choice of probabilities $\\{p_i\\}$ corresponds to selecting a subset of the Pauli operators or giving them different weights. If we select a subset of $N < d^2$ Pauli operators (i.e., some $p_i=0$), the dimension of the environment is reduced to $N$. The resulting Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda^c)$ will be a principal submatrix of the one for the depolarizing channel (after a suitable reordering and scaling). The rank of a submatrix cannot exceed the rank of the original matrix. Therefore, the rank will be at most $d^2$.\n\nFor example, if we consider a channel with just one Kraus operator $A_1 = U_1$ (e.g., $U_1=I$, the identity channel), the complementary channel is $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}(\\rho)|1\\rangle\\langle 1|$. The Choi matrix is $J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_k |k\\rangle\\langle k| \\otimes |1\\rangle\\langle 1|$, which has rank $d$. As we add more orthogonal Kraus operators, the rank of the complementary channel's Choi matrix increases. The maximum is achieved when we use all $d^2$ orthogonal Pauli operators with equal weight, which corresponds to the completely depolarizing channel.\n\nThus, the maximal rank is achieved for the completely depolarizing channel, and this rank is $d^2$."
