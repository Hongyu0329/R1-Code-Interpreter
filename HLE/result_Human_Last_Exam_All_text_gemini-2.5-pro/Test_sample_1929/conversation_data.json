    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Their Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Butadiene:** Its chemical structure is CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂. It is a conjugated diene, meaning it has two double bonds separated by a single bond. This 4-pi-electron system is the \"diene\" component in a Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   **1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene:** Its chemical structure is CCl₂=CF₂. It is an alkene, which is a 2-pi-electron system. In the context of a Diels-Alder reaction, it serves as the \"dienophile\".\n\n2.  **Determine the Type of Reaction:**\n    The reaction between a conjugated diene (butadiene) and a dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene) is a classic example of a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition, a type of pericyclic reaction where the 4 pi electrons of the diene and the 2 pi electrons of the dienophile rearrange in a concerted (single-step) mechanism to form a new six-membered ring. The reaction is particularly favorable because the dienophile is substituted with highly electronegative atoms (Cl and F), which are strong electron-withdrawing groups. These groups make the dienophile \"electron-poor\" and thus more reactive towards the electron-rich diene.\n\n3.  **Predict the Connectivity of the Product:**\n    *   The four carbon atoms of butadiene and the two carbon atoms of the dienophile combine to form a six-membered ring.\n    *   Two new single (sigma) bonds are formed between the ends of the diene and the carbons of the dienophile's double bond.\n    *   The two double bonds in the diene and the one double bond in the dienophile are consumed.\n    *   A new double (pi) bond is formed in the product, located between the two central carbons of the original diene.\n    *   The resulting ring structure is a cyclohexene derivative.\n\n4.  **Determine the Substituent Placement on the Product:**\n    *   The substituents originally on the dienophile (two chlorine atoms and two fluorine atoms) will be attached to the two adjacent carbons in the new ring that came from the dienophile.\n    *   One of these carbons will be bonded to two chlorine atoms (a CCl₂ group).\n    *   The adjacent carbon will be bonded to two fluorine atoms (a CF₂ group).\n    *   The final product structure is a cyclohexene ring with a CCl₂ group and a CF₂ group on adjacent saturated carbons.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Regiochemistry:** The diene (1,3-butadiene) is a symmetric molecule. Therefore, it doesn't matter which end of the diene attacks which carbon of the unsymmetrical dienophile. Only one constitutional isomer is formed as the product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific, but since the substituents on the dienophile are geminal (two on the same carbon), this aspect is simplified. The reactants are achiral, but the product molecule is chiral (it is not superimposable on its mirror image). Therefore, the reaction will produce a **racemic mixture**, which is a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers of the product.\n*   **Product Naming (IUPAC):** The parent ring is cyclohexene. The double bond is given the lowest locants (C1 and C2). Numbering is then chosen to give the substituent locants the lowest possible set, which is {3,3,4,4}. When the locant set is the same regardless of numbering direction, the substituent that comes first alphabetically (\"chloro\") is assigned the lower number. Therefore, the preferred IUPAC name is **3,3-dichloro-4,4-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring. The product is a substituted cyclohexene.\n\nThe final product is **3,3-dichloro-4,4-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3,3-dichloro-4,4-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
