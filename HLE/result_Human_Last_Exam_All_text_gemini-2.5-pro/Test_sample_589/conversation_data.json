    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Core Elements of the Question\n\nThe query asks for a specific scene in a film with the following key components:\n1.  **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n2.  **Producer:** A major film studio.\n3.  **Protagonist/Character:** A teenager.\n4.  **Key Object:** A pink bike.\n5.  **Specific Action:** The teenager rides the bike and pedals directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Brainstorming and Elimination\n\nWe can think of several movies featuring teenagers and bikes, but we must check them against all criteria.\n\n*   ***It*** **(2017):** Produced by New Line Cinema/Warner Bros. (major studio) and features teenage characters. Beverly Marsh rides a bike to escape bullies in a car, but the bike is more of a faded red/orange, and she is pedaling *away* from the car, not toward it. So, this does not match the specific action.\n*   ***Pee-wee's Big Adventure*** **(1985):** Produced by Warner Bros. (major studio). The main character is a man-child, not a teenager. The iconic bike is red, not pink. This is not a match.\n*   ***Napoleon Dynamite*** **(2004):** Features a teenager and bike riding, but it's an independent film (not a major studio at the time of production), and there is no pink bike or a scene of pedaling toward an oncoming car.\n*   ***E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*** **(1982):** Produced by Universal Pictures (major studio) and features famous bike scenes with kids/teens, but no pink bike or the specific confrontation described.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying the Most Likely Candidate\n\nThe film that most closely aligns with the very specific and unusual combination of elements is **A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge** (1985).\n\n*   **Studio:** It was produced by New Line Cinema. The success of the *Nightmare on Elm Street* franchise effectively turned New Line into a major player in the industry. It fits the \"major studio\" criterion.\n*   **Character:** The main protagonist, Jesse Walsh, is a teenager.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the Relevant Scenes in the Candidate Film\n\nThis is the most crucial step. The question is often considered a piece of movie trivia that relies on a slightly jumbled memory of two separate, surreal nightmare sequences from this film:\n\n1.  **The \"Oncoming Car\" Scene:** There is a famous opening sequence where the teenager, Jesse, is on a school bus. The bus is suddenly hijacked by Freddy Krueger, who drives it erratically at high speed through a desert, heading toward the edge of a cliff and a fiery abyss. This scene contains the \"teenager\" and \"oncoming car\" (a vehicle heading into danger) elements.\n2.  **The \"Pink Bike\" Scene:** In a different nightmare sequence, Jesse sees his little sister's pink tricycle. The tricycle begins to pedal on its own, heading directly for a fiery chasm that has opened up in the middle of the street. This scene contains the \"pink bike\" (technically a tricycle) element.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nNo single scene in the film perfectly matches the user's description of \"a teenager ride[s] a pink bike and pedal[s] directly toward an oncoming car.\" However, the film **A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge** is the only major Hollywood film that contains all of these specific elements (a teenager, a pink bicycle/tricycle, and an out-of-control vehicle heading for doom) across two of its most memorable sequences. The query is a classic trivia question that conflates these two scenes.\n\n<<<A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge>>>"
