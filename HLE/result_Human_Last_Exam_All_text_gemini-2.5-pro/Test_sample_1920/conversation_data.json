    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the conductor $d$\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n- $d$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n- Let's test for divisibility by small prime numbers:\n  - $53599 \\div 7 = 7657$.\n  - Now we factor $7657$. We test primes up to $\\sqrt{7657} \\approx 87.5$.\n  - $7657 \\div 11 = 696.09...$\n  - $7657 \\div 13 = 589$.\n  - Now we factor $589$. We test primes up to $\\sqrt{589} \\approx 24.2$.\n  - $589 \\div 17 = 34.6...$\n  - $589 \\div 19 = 31$.\nSo, the prime factorization of $d$ is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. Let's denote the prime factors as $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$.\n\n### Step 2: Structure of Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo each prime factor:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{p_1} \\chi_{p_2} \\chi_{p_3} \\chi_{p_4}$, where $\\chi_{p_i}$ is a character modulo $p_i$.\n\n### Step 3: Condition for a Primitive Character\nA character $\\chi = \\prod_{i=1}^4 \\chi_{p_i}$ is primitive with conductor $d = \\prod p_i$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_{p_i}$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i$.\nFor a character modulo a prime $p$, it is primitive if and only if it is non-trivial. The only non-primitive character modulo $p$ is the principal (trivial) character, whose order is 1.\nTherefore, for $\\chi$ to be a primitive character of conductor $d$, each $\\chi_{p_i}$ must be a non-trivial character. This means the order of each $\\chi_{p_i}$, denoted as $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_i})$, must be greater than 1.\n\n### Step 4: Condition on the Order of the Character\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31}))$.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\n\n### Step 5: Counting Characters of a specific order\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo a prime $p$ is isomorphic to the group of units $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$.\nThe number of characters of order $k$ in a cyclic group of order $m$ is given by $\\phi(k)$ if $k|m$, and 0 otherwise.\n\nLet's check the orders of the character groups for our primes:\n- Modulo 7: order $p_1-1 = 6$.\n- Modulo 13: order $p_2-1 = 12$.\n- Modulo 19: order $p_3-1 = 18$.\n- Modulo 31: order $p_4-1 = 30$.\nFor each prime factor $p_i$ of $d$, the order of the character group $p_i-1$ is a multiple of 6.\n\n### Step 6: Combining the conditions and counting\nWe need to count the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that:\n1.  For each $p_i$, $\\chi_{p_i}$ is a non-trivial character modulo $p_i$. This means $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_i}) > 1$.\n2.  $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\n\nThis lcm condition implies that for each $p_i$, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_i})$ must be a divisor of 6.\nSo, we are looking for non-trivial characters whose order divides 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n\nWe can solve this using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, or by using Mobius inversion on the lattice of divisors of 6. Let $N(k)$ be the number of primitive characters of conductor $d$ and order $k$. Let $A(n)$ be the number of primitive characters of conductor $d$ whose order divides $n$.\nThe number of characters of order 6 is given by:\n$N(6) = A(6) - A(3) - A(2) + A(1)$.\n\nLet's calculate $A(n)$ for $n=1, 2, 3, 6$.\n$A(n)$ is the number of tuples of non-trivial characters $(\\chi_{p_i})$ such that $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_i}))$ divides $n$. This is equivalent to requiring that for each $p_i$, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_i})$ divides $n$.\n\nThe number of characters modulo $p_i$ whose order divides $n$ is $\\gcd(n, p_i-1)$.\nSince we require non-trivial characters, the number of choices for each $\\chi_{p_i}$ is $\\gcd(n, p_i-1) - 1$.\nSo, $A(n) = \\prod_{i=1}^4 (\\gcd(n, p_i-1) - 1)$.\n\n-   **Calculate A(6):**\n    For each $p_i$, the number of non-trivial characters whose order divides 6 is $\\gcd(6, p_i-1) - 1$.\n    $\\gcd(6, 6) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5$.\n    $\\gcd(6, 12) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5$.\n    $\\gcd(6, 18) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5$.\n    $\\gcd(6, 30) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5$.\n    So, $A(6) = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\n-   **Calculate A(3):**\n    For each $p_i$, the number of non-trivial characters whose order divides 3 is $\\gcd(3, p_i-1) - 1$.\n    $\\gcd(3, 6) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$.\n    $\\gcd(3, 12) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$.\n    $\\gcd(3, 18) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$.\n    $\\gcd(3, 30) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$.\n    So, $A(3) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\n-   **Calculate A(2):**\n    For each $p_i$, the number of non-trivial characters whose order divides 2 is $\\gcd(2, p_i-1) - 1$.\n    $\\gcd(2, 6) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n    $\\gcd(2, 12) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n    $\\gcd(2, 18) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n    $\\gcd(2, 30) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n    So, $A(2) = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\n-   **Calculate A(1):**\n    The only character whose order divides 1 is the trivial character. We are only counting non-trivial characters. So, for each $p_i$, the number of choices is $\\gcd(1, p_i-1) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n    So, $A(1) = 0$.\n\n### Step 7: Final Calculation\nUsing the formula $N(6) = A(6) - A(3) - A(2) + A(1)$:\n$N(6) = 625 - 16 - 1 + 0 = 608$.\n\nThus, there are 608 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 53599 and order 6.\n\n<<<608>>>"
