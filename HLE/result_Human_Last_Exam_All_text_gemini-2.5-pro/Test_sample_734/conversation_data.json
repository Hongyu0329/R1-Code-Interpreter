    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a specific Christian theologian who meets several criteria:\n    *   They must be the **first** to do this.\n    *   They must have developed **specialized terminology**.\n    *   This terminology must be able to describe **changes in the laws of nature**.\n    *   The terminology must be applicable to two specific events: the **virgin birth of Jesus** and the **alterations in nature at the Fall**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Theological Concepts:**\n    *   **Virgin Birth:** This is a classic example of a miracle, understood as a singular, divine act that suspends or operates outside the normal, observable laws of biology.\n    *   **The Fall:** This refers to the consequences of Adam and Eve's disobedience. Theologically, this is often interpreted as causing a fundamental shift in the created order itself—introducing death, decay, suffering, and hardship (e.g., \"thorns and thistles\") into a previously perfect world. This implies a systemic change to how nature functions, not just a one-time event.\n    *   **The Challenge:** The theologian's conceptual framework must be robust enough to explain both a specific, localized miracle and a broad, systemic change in the natural order.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates:**\n    *   **Early Church Fathers (pre-Augustine):** Figures like Irenaeus and Origen discussed the virgin birth and the Fall, but they generally did not develop a systematic, philosophical vocabulary to describe \"laws of nature\" and their alteration in the way the question implies.\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas (13th Century):** Aquinas developed a very influential framework distinguishing between God's \"ordained power\" (*potentia ordinata*—the regular laws of nature) and his \"absolute power\" (*potentia absoluta*—what God can do outside that regular order). This terminology works well, but Aquinas was not the *first*. He built heavily on the work of an earlier thinker.\n    *   **Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD):** Augustine is the strongest candidate. He wrote extensively on creation, miracles, and the Fall, long before Aquinas. He was one of the first in the Western tradition to attempt a systematic synthesis of Christian doctrine and classical philosophy.\n\n4.  **Examine Augustine's Specialized Terminology:**\n    *   Augustine's key concept is the ***rationes seminales***, which can be translated as \"seminal reasons,\" \"seed principles,\" or \"causal reasons.\"\n    *   He argued that in the initial act of creation, God embedded within matter the latent potentialities for everything that would ever come into being, including things that appear to be outside the normal course of nature.\n    *   He distinguished between the ordinary, observable \"course of nature\" (*consuetudo naturae*) and the ultimate will of God, who planted these hidden potentials.\n\n5.  **Apply Augustine's Terminology to the Specific Examples:**\n    *   **The Virgin Birth:** For Augustine, the virgin birth was not God violating a natural law He had created. Instead, it was the activation of a *ratio seminalis* that God had placed within creation from the very beginning. It was a potentiality that existed outside the *ordinary* chain of cause and effect but was part of God's original, deeper plan for nature.\n    *   **The Fall:** Augustine's framework can also account for the changes at the Fall. The Fall can be seen as the event that triggered or \"activated\" a different set of latent potentialities within creation—those for decay, death, and hardship (\"thorns and thistles\"). The fundamental constitution of nature did not change, but its *course* and the principles that now governed its unfolding were altered by sin.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAugustine of Hippo was the first major Christian theologian to develop a specialized and systematic terminology (*rationes seminales*) to explain how events could occur outside the ordinary course of nature. This framework was uniquely capable of accounting for both singular miracles like the virgin birth and systemic shifts in the natural world's operation, such as the consequences of the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
