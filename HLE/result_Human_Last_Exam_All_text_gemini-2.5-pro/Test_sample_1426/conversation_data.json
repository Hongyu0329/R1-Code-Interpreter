    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2, Op. 4.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the correct musical piece and part.**\nThe question specifies Dvořák's \"Symphony no. 2, Op. 4\" and the \"first violin\" (Violino I) part. We must consult the musical score for this specific piece.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the end of the symphony.**\nWe need to go to the final measures of the fourth and final movement, \"Finale: Allegro con fuoco\". The ending is marked by a final, triumphant chord played by the full orchestra.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the first violin part in the final measures.**\nThe phrase \"ends... on three notes\" refers to the last three sequential notes played by the first violin leading to the conclusion. It does not refer to a three-note chord, as the first violins play a single melodic line at the end.\n*   **The Penultimate Measure:** In the measure right before the final note, the first violins play a fast, ascending passage of sixteenth notes. The last two notes in this run are E# (E-sharp) followed by F# (F-sharp). In terms of pitch register, these are E#6 and F#6, which are very high notes.\n*   **The Final Measure:** The very last note of the symphony for the first violin is a single, sustained whole note. This note is B. In terms of pitch register, it is B5, the B located just above the treble clef staff.\n\n**Step 4: List and compare the last three notes.**\nThe last three notes played in sequence by the first violin are:\n1.  E#6 (enharmonically the same as F6)\n2.  F#6\n3.  B5\n\n**Step 5: Determine the lowest note.**\nTo find the lowest note, we compare their positions on the musical staff and their pitches:\n*   B5 is the B above the staff.\n*   E#6 is the E# on the third ledger line above the staff.\n*   F#6 is the F# in the space above the third ledger line.\n\nBy comparing these pitches, B5 is significantly lower than both E#6 and F#6.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe last three notes are E#6, F#6, and B5. The lowest of these three is B5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
