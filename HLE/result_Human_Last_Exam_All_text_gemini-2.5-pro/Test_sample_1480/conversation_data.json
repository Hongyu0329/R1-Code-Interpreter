    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the \"rule activation level\". In a fuzzy logic system, this refers to the result of the implication step for a specific rule. This step determines the shape of the consequent (output) fuzzy set after it has been \"activated\" by the firing strength of the antecedent (input) part of the rule.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components:**\n    *   **Fuzzy System Type:** Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Logic System (IT3 FLS).\n    *   **Antecedent Firing Strength:** `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`. This value represents how strongly the antecedent part (the \"IF\" part) of the k-th rule is satisfied by the input `x'`.\n    *   **Consequent Membership Value:** `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. This is the membership degree of a specific output value `y_j` in the original consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j` (the \"THEN\" part) of the k-th rule.\n    *   **Operation:** A t-norm operation. This is a type of fuzzy logic operator used to implement the fuzzy `AND` as well as the implication (activation) step.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation:** The activation of the consequent is calculated by combining the antecedent firing strength with the consequent membership function using a t-norm. The formula for the activated membership value is:\n    `μ_activated(y_j) = t-norm(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation with a Chosen T-norm:** The question specifies \"a t-norm\" but does not state which one. We will analyze the result using the two most common t-norms in fuzzy logic: the Minimum and the Product.\n    *   **Minimum (Gödel) T-norm:** This is the most widely used t-norm for implication in Mamdani-type fuzzy systems.\n        *   `t-norm(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n        *   `Rule Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n        *   `Rule Activation Level = 0.7`\n    *   **Product (Goguen) T-norm:** This is another common choice.\n        *   `t-norm(a, b) = a * b`\n        *   `Rule Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9`\n        *   `Rule Activation Level = 0.63`\n\n5.  **Select the Most Appropriate Answer:** In the absence of further information, the Minimum operator is the standard and most common t-norm used for rule activation (implication). Therefore, it is the most likely intended operator.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Role of \"Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set\":** This information might seem complicating, as IT3 FLSs involve a high degree of uncertainty where membership values are Type-2 fuzzy sets. However, the problem provides crisp numerical inputs (`0.7` and `0.9`). This implies that the calculation is being performed at a specific *alpha-plane* of the IT3 FLS. At a given alpha-plane, the complex IT3 structure is \"sliced\" into a simpler form, and the operations often reduce to standard (Type-1) fuzzy logic calculations. Thus, we can proceed with the given scalar values.\n\n2.  **Ambiguity of \"T-norm\":** The term \"t-norm\" refers to a class of functions. Without a specific t-norm being named (like Minimum, Product, or Lukasiewicz), the standard convention is to use the **Minimum** operator, which is fundamental to the original definition of a Mamdani fuzzy inference system.\n\n3.  **Interpretation of \"Rule Activation Level\":** This term refers to the value of the output membership function *after* the implication step, not the antecedent firing level itself. It is the result of applying the antecedent's firing strength to the consequent's fuzzy set.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the standard practices in fuzzy logic, we will use the Minimum t-norm to compute the rule activation level.\n\n*   **Inputs:** `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`, `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n*   **Operation:** `min(0.7, 0.9)`\n*   **Result:** `0.7`\n\nThe rule activation level for the given point `y_j` is `0.7`.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
