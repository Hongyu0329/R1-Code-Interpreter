    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the parametric curve in the interval $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\nIn this interval, the parameter $b=1$. The parametric equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = \\sin t$\nThese are the standard parametric equations for a unit circle. As $t$ varies from $0$ to $\\pi$:\n*   $x$ goes from $\\cos(0)=1$ to $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$.\n*   $y$ goes from $\\sin(0)=0$ up to $\\sin(\\pi/2)=1$ and back down to $\\sin(\\pi)=0$.\nThis part of the curve traces the upper half of a unit circle centered at the origin, with radius 1. The range of x-values is $[-1, 1]$ and the range of y-values is $[0, 1]$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the parametric curve in the interval $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\nIn this interval, the parameter $b=5$. The parametric equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = 5\\sin t$\nThese are the parametric equations for an ellipse. We can see this by noting that $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, which gives the ellipse equation $x^2 + y^2/25 = 1$. As $t$ varies from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$:\n*   $x$ goes from $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi)=1$.\n*   Since $\\sin t$ is negative for $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, the y-values will be negative. $y$ goes from $5\\sin(\\pi)=0$ down to $5\\sin(3\\pi/2)=-5$ and back up to $5\\sin(2\\pi)=0$.\nThis part of the curve traces the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin, with a horizontal semi-axis of length 1 and a vertical semi-axis of length 5. The range of x-values is $[-1, 1]$ and the range of y-values is $[-5, 0)$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the overall dimensions (bounding box) of the complete figure**\nTo find the smallest enclosing square, we first need to find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates for the entire figure. This defines the smallest rectangle that encloses the figure.\n\n*   **X-dimension (Width):**\n    *   For the first part ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$), $x$ ranges from -1 to 1.\n    *   For the second part ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$), $x$ also ranges from -1 to 1.\n    *   Therefore, the overall minimum x-value is $x_{min} = -1$ and the maximum x-value is $x_{max} = 1$.\n    *   The total width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Y-dimension (Height):**\n    *   For the first part ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$), $y$ ranges from 0 to 1. The maximum y-value is $y_{max} = 1$.\n    *   For the second part ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$), $y$ ranges from -5 to 0. The minimum y-value is $y_{min} = -5$.\n    *   Therefore, the overall y-values for the entire figure range from -5 to 1.\n    *   The total height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the smallest enclosing square and its area**\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6.\nThe smallest square that can enclose this rectangle must have a side length equal to the larger of the two dimensions (width and height).\n\n*   Side length of the square, $S = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\nThe area of this square is the side length squared.\n\n*   Area = $S^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n*   The parameter `b` is defined piecewise, which means the curve is a composite of two different shapes.\n*   The term \"outcircles\" in this context means \"encloses\" or \"circumscribes\".\n*   The side length of the smallest enclosing square for a non-square rectangle is determined by the longer side of the rectangle.\n*   The range of trigonometric functions over the specified intervals is key to finding the bounds of the figure. For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $\\sin(t) \\in [0,1]$. For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $\\sin(t) \\in [-1,0)$. For $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$, $\\cos(t) \\in [-1,1]$.\n\nThe final figure consists of an upper unit semicircle and a lower semi-ellipse. The maximum y-value is 1 (from the semicircle), the minimum y-value is -5 (from the semi-ellipse), the maximum x-value is 1, and the minimum x-value is -1. This confirms the bounding box has a height of 6 and a width of 2. The smallest enclosing square must have a side length of 6.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nArea = (Side Length)^2 = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
