    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Generalized Quaternion Group Q_128**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $4n$, denoted $Q_{4n}$, has the presentation:\n$Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\nIn this problem, the order of the group is 128. So, $4n = 128$, which implies $n = 32$.\nThe group is $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\nIts elements are of the form $x^k$ for $0 \\le k < 64$ and $x^k y$ for $0 \\le k < 64$.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the term \"Power Subgroup\"**\n\nThe term \"power subgroup\" is not universally standard, but in the context of group theory, it has a specific technical meaning.\n*   **Interpretation A: Cyclic Subgroup.** A subgroup of the form $\\langle g \\rangle = \\{g^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ for some element $g$ in the group. This could be described as a \"subgroup of powers\".\n*   **Interpretation B: The Power Subgroup $G^k$.** For a group $G$ and an integer $k$, the $k$-th power subgroup, denoted $G^k$, is the subgroup generated by all the $k$-th powers of elements of $G$. That is, $G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n\nThe phrasing of the question \"How many power subgroups are there?\" suggests we need to count the number of distinct subgroups in a certain class. The class of subgroups $\\{G^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ is a standard object of study in group theory, and the name \"power subgroup\" is a direct description of its members. This interpretation is more likely to be the intended one than Interpretation A, as \"cyclic subgroup\" is the standard term for that concept. We will proceed with Interpretation B.\n\nThe question is to find the size of the set $S = \\{ G^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\}$, where $G=Q_{128}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Subgroups $G^k$**\n\nWe need to compute the subgroup $G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$ and find how many distinct subgroups we get for different values of $k$. We consider two cases for the exponent $k$.\n\n**Case 1: $k$ is odd.**\nLet $k$ be an odd integer.\n1.  Consider the powers of elements of the form $x^i$: $(x^i)^k = x^{ik}$. Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 64) = 1$. The set of all such elements, $\\{x^{ik} \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$, generates the entire cyclic group $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n2.  Consider the powers of elements of the form $x^i y$: $(x^i y)^k$. Since $k$ is odd, we can write $k = 2m+1$.\n    $(x^i y)^k = (x^i y) \\cdot (x^i y)^{2m} = (x^i y) \\cdot ((x^i y)^2)^m$.\n    We know $(x^i y)^2 = x^i y x^i y = x^i (y x^i y^{-1}) y^2 = x^i (x^{-i}) y^2 = y^2 = x^{32}$.\n    So, $(x^i y)^k = (x^i y) \\cdot (x^{32})^m = x^i y x^{32m} = x^i (y x^{32m} y^{-1}) y = x^i (x^{-32m}) y = x^{i - 32m} y$.\n    This is an element of the form $x^j y$.\nSo, if $k$ is odd, $G^k$ contains $\\langle x \\rangle$ and at least one element of the form $x^j y$. The subgroup generated by $\\langle x \\rangle$ and any element not in $\\langle x \\rangle$ is the whole group $G$.\nTherefore, for any odd $k$, $G^k = G = Q_{128}$.\n\n**Case 2: $k$ is even.**\nLet $k$ be an even integer. We can write $k = 2^a \\cdot b$, where $b$ is odd and $a \\ge 1$.\nThe subgroup $G^k = G^{2^a b} = (G^b)^{2^a}$. Since $b$ is odd, we know from Case 1 that $G^b = G$.\nSo, $G^k = G^{2^a}$. We only need to find the distinct subgroups for $k$ being a power of 2.\n\nLet's compute $G^{2^a}$ for $a \\ge 1$.\n$G^{2^a} = \\langle g^{2^a} \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n1.  For elements of the form $x^i$: $(x^i)^{2^a} = x^{i \\cdot 2^a}$. The subgroup generated by all these powers is $\\langle x^{\\gcd(2^a, 64)} \\rangle = \\langle x^{2^a} \\rangle$.\n2.  For elements of the form $x^i y$: $(x^i y)^{2^a} = ((x^i y)^2)^{2^{a-1}} = (x^{32})^{2^{a-1}} = x^{32 \\cdot 2^{a-1}} = x^{2^5 \\cdot 2^{a-1}} = x^{2^{a+4}}$.\n\nSo, $G^{2^a} = \\langle \\langle x^{2^a} \\rangle, x^{2^{a+4}} \\rangle$.\nSince $x^{2^{a+4}} = (x^{2^a})^{16}$, the element $x^{2^{a+4}}$ is already in the subgroup $\\langle x^{2^a} \\rangle$.\nTherefore, for $a \\ge 1$, $G^{2^a} = \\langle x^{2^a} \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Distinct Power Subgroups**\n\nNow we list the distinct subgroups we have found:\n*   From Case 1 ($k$ is odd, or $a=0$ in $k=2^a b$): We get one subgroup, $G$ itself.\n*   From Case 2 ($k$ is even, $a \\ge 1$): We get subgroups of the form $\\langle x^{2^a} \\rangle$. We need to see how many distinct subgroups this form gives.\n    *   $a=1: G^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (a cyclic subgroup of order 32).\n    *   $a=2: G^4 = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (a cyclic subgroup of order 16).\n    *   $a=3: G^8 = \\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (a cyclic subgroup of order 8).\n    *   $a=4: G^{16} = \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (a cyclic subgroup of order 4).\n    *   $a=5: G^{32} = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (a cyclic subgroup of order 2).\n    *   $a=6: G^{64} = \\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\langle 1 \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup).\n    *   For $a \\ge 6$, $G^{2^a} = \\langle x^{2^a} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$, since $x^{64}=1$. So no new subgroups are formed.\n\nThe set of all distinct power subgroups is:\n$S = \\{ G, \\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\} \\}$.\n\nCounting the elements in this set, we find there is 1 subgroup from the odd powers ($G$ itself) and 6 distinct non-trivial subgroups from the even powers, plus the trivial subgroup.\nTotal number of distinct power subgroups = $1 + 6 = 7$.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{7}$.\n\n<<<7>>>"
