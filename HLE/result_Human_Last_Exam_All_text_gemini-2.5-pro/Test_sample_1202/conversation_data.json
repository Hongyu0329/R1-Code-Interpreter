    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices:\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Gene Duplication:** A process that creates an extra copy of a gene in the genome. Initially, this second copy is redundant.\n*   **Fate of Duplicate Genes:** A duplicated gene has several possible fates. The most common is that one copy accumulates mutations and becomes a non-functional **pseudogene**. However, sometimes both copies are kept.\n*   **Retention:** The process by which the duplicate gene copy is kept in the genome over evolutionary time, avoiding deletion or pseudogenization.\n*   **Divergence:** The process by which the two gene copies accumulate different mutations and become distinct from each other in sequence and/or function.\n*   **The Question:** We are looking for the mechanism that best explains both *why* the duplicate copy is kept (retention) and *how* it becomes different from the original (divergence).\n\n**2. Analyze the Answer Choices Step-by-Step**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a mechanism of non-reciprocal DNA transfer between two similar sequences, like duplicate genes. Its effect is to make the two copies *more similar* to each other (homogenization). This works directly *against* divergence. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where one copy becomes non-functional. This is indeed the most common fate of a duplicated gene and involves both retention (as a non-functional sequence) and divergence (as it's no longer under selective pressure to maintain function). However, this represents a *loss* of function. The key evolutionary significance of gene duplication lies in the potential to create new functions, which requires the retention of *both copies as functional genes*. The other models (C and D) address this creative aspect. While a valid outcome, it's not the mechanism for the evolution of new, functional gene pairs.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy retains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function.\n    *   **Retention:** Both copies are retained by natural selection because one performs the original essential function and the other performs a new, advantageous function.\n    *   **Divergence:** The new copy must diverge significantly to acquire its new function.\n    *   This is a valid and important mechanism. A potential issue is that the redundant copy is not under selective pressure initially, so it may become a pseudogene before a rare, beneficial, new-function mutation occurs.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** In this model, the original ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or expression patterns (e.g., active in different tissues or at different times). After duplication, each copy accumulates degenerative mutations that inactivate *different* subfunctions. The result is that both copies are now required to perform the complete set of the original ancestral functions.\n    *   **Retention:** Both copies are retained because losing either one would result in the loss of an essential subfunction (a process called complementation).\n    *   **Divergence:** The copies diverge as they specialize and lose different parts of their original functional or regulatory sequences.\n    *   This model is considered very likely because it can happen through common, nearly neutral degenerative mutations. It provides a \"safe harbor\" that protects both copies from pseudogenization, allowing them to be maintained long enough for further evolutionary changes to occur.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of a lineage into many new species. Gene duplication can provide the genetic fuel for adaptive radiation, but it is not, by itself, a molecular mechanism for gene retention and divergence at the genome level. This option operates at the wrong biological scale.\n\n**3. Compare the Strongest Candidates (C and D)**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted models that explain the retention and divergence of functional duplicate genes. However, the question asks for the \"most likely\" mechanism.\n\n*   **Subfunctionalization** provides a more probable path for the *initial retention* of the duplicate gene pair. It relies on common degenerative mutations, which are much more frequent than the rare gain-of-function mutations required for neofunctionalization. By partitioning the ancestral functions, it quickly makes both copies essential, thus protecting them from being lost.\n*   Because it provides a plausible and common way to overcome the high probability of pseudogenization, **subfunctionalization** is often considered a more likely and widespread mechanism for the initial preservation and divergence of duplicate genes.\n\nTherefore, subfunctionalization is the most likely mechanism responsible for the widespread retention and divergence of duplicate genes observed in eukaryotic genomes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
