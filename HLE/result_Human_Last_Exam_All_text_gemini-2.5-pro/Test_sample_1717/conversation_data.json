    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Base Health in Expert Mode**\n\nFirst, we need to establish the starting health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player. This value serves as the base for all multiplayer calculations.\n\n*   In Classic Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 2,800.\n*   In Expert Mode, boss health is increased. According to Terraria's source code, the Eye of Cthulhu's health is specifically set to **3,640** when Expert Mode is active. This is our starting value.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Multiplayer Health Scaling Formula**\n\nNext, we must find the formula the game uses to increase boss health based on the number of players in the world. In Expert Mode, this scaling is more significant than in Classic Mode.\n\n*   The game calculates a \"health multiplier\" that is applied to the boss's base Expert Mode health.\n*   The formula for this multiplier is: `1.0 + (NumberOfPlayers - 1) * 0.35`.\n*   This means for every player beyond the first, the boss's health is increased by an additional 35% of its base Expert health.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Base Health and the Scaling Formula**\n\nNow we can create the complete formula for the Eye of Cthulhu's health in Expert Mode for any given number of players (`N`).\n\n*   `Total Health = BaseExpertHealth * (1.0 + (N - 1) * 0.35)`\n*   Substituting the Eye of Cthulhu's base Expert health:\n    `Total Health = 3640 * (1.0 + (N - 1) * 0.35)`\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Formula as the Number of Players Approaches Infinity**\n\nThe question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. This requires us to evaluate the limit of the health formula as `N` approaches infinity (`∞`).\n\n*   Let's analyze the scaling part of the formula: `(1.0 + (N - 1) * 0.35)`.\n*   As the number of players (`N`) grows infinitely large, the term `(N - 1)` also grows infinitely large.\n*   Multiplying an infinitely large number by a positive constant (0.35) results in an infinitely large number.\n*   Therefore, the entire health multiplier `(1.0 + (N - 1) * 0.35)` approaches infinity as `N` approaches infinity.\n*   The final health is this infinitely large multiplier multiplied by the base health of 3,640. The result is also infinity.\n\nThe formula can be simplified to `Health = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35 * N)`. As `N -> ∞`, the `0.35 * N` term dominates and goes to `∞`, making the total health also go to `∞`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Expert Mode Base Health:** It is crucial to use the correct base health. The Expert Mode health for the Eye of Cthulhu (3,640) is a specific value, not just a simple multiplier on its Classic Mode health.\n2.  **Correct Scaling Factor:** The per-player health scaling in Expert Mode is 35% (`0.35`), which is different from the Classic Mode scaling of 0%. (In Classic mode, only boss damage scales, not health).\n3.  **Linear and Uncapped Scaling:** The health scaling formula is linear and has no upper limit or \"cap\" built into the game's code. This is the key reason the theoretical health is infinite.\n4.  **Theoretical vs. Practical:** The question is purely theoretical. In a real game, the number of players is limited by server software (typically to 8, or 255 with modifications), and system resources. The \"infinite players\" condition turns this into a mathematical limit problem.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the linear, uncapped health scaling formula applied in Expert Mode, as the number of players approaches infinity, the health multiplier also approaches infinity. Consequently, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu is infinite.\n\n<<<Infinite>>>"
