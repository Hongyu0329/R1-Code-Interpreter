    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the topological objects involved.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the given space and the construction.**\n*   **X:** We start with a space $X$ which is a *hereditary indecomposable metric continuum*.\n    *   A *continuum* is a compact, connected metric space.\n    *   *Indecomposable* means $X$ cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua.\n    *   *Hereditary indecomposable* is a stronger condition: every subcontinuum of $X$ is itself indecomposable. The most famous example of such a space is the **pseudo-arc**.\n*   **Y = X \\ {x}:** We remove a single point $x$ from $X$. Since $X$ is a compact metric space, $Y$ is a locally compact, non-compact, and separable metric space.\n*   **Stone-Cech Remainder:** We consider the Stone-Cech compactification of $Y$, denoted $\\beta Y$. The Stone-Cech remainder is the set of \"new\" points, $R = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$.\n*   **Composants:** In a continuum $K$, the composant of a point $p \\in K$ is the union of all proper subcontinua of $K$ that contain $p$. The number of composants is a fundamental topological property.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the basic topological properties of the remainder R.**\nThe key question is whether $R$ is a single point, a disconnected set, or a continuum itself.\n\n*   **Compactness:** The remainder $R$ is a closed subset of the compact space $\\beta Y$, so $R$ is always compact.\n*   **Connectivity:** The connectivity of the remainder depends on the properties of the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. A crucial theorem states that for a locally compact, connected space $Y$, its Stone-Cech remainder $R$ is connected (and thus a continuum) if and only if $Y$ is \"connected at infinity\".\n    *   A space is connected at infinity if, for any compact subset $K$, there exists a larger compact subset $C$ such that the space minus $C$ is connected.\n    *   In an indecomposable continuum like $X$, no point is a *cut point*. That is, for any $p \\in X$, the space $X \\setminus \\{p\\}$ is connected. This property is strong enough to imply that $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is connected at infinity.\n    *   Therefore, the remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is a **continuum**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the number of composants of the continuum R.**\nA continuum can be either decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n*   If $R$ is **decomposable**, it can be written as a union of two of its proper subcontinua. In this case, it has only **one** composant (the entire space $R$).\n*   If $R$ is **indecomposable**, the number of composants is greater than one. For a *separable* indecomposable continuum, a theorem by Mazurkiewicz shows that the number of composants is exactly **$2^{\\aleph_0}$** (the cardinality of the continuum).\n\nTo know which case applies, we need to check if $R$ is separable.\n*   $X$ is a metric space, so it is separable (it contains a countable dense subset).\n*   $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is also a separable space.\n*   It is a standard result that if a space $Y$ is separable, its Stone-Cech compactification $\\beta Y$ is also separable.\n*   $R$ is a closed subset of the separable compact Hausdorff space $\\beta Y$. Any closed subset of a separable compact Hausdorff space is also separable.\n*   Therefore, the remainder $R$ is a **separable continuum**.\n\nThis means the number of composants of $R$ can only be **1** (if $R$ is decomposable) or **$2^{\\aleph_0}$** (if $R$ is indecomposable).\n\n**Step 4: Find the maximum possible number of composants.**\nTo find the maximum, we must determine if it is possible for the remainder $R$ to be indecomposable. We can do this by examining a specific example of $X$.\n\n*   Let $X$ be the **pseudo-arc**. The pseudo-arc is the prime example of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum.\n*   A deep and important result in continuum theory (due to Bellamy and Smith) states that for the pseudo-arc $P$, the Stone-Cech remainder of $P$ with one point removed, $\\beta(P \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\setminus (P \\setminus \\{p\\})$, is homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc $P$ itself.\n*   The pseudo-arc is an indecomposable continuum.\n*   Therefore, for this choice of $X$, the remainder $R$ is an indecomposable separable continuum.\n\nBased on the conclusion of Step 3, an indecomposable separable continuum has $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants. This shows that $2^{\\aleph_0}$ is a possible number of composants for the remainder.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe number of composants for the remainder $R$ can be either 1 or $2^{\\aleph_0}$. Since we have found a valid example (the pseudo-arc) where the number of composants is $2^{\\aleph_0}$, this is the maximum possible value."
