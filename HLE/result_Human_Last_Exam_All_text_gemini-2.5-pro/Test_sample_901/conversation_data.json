    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide. The stereochemistry is specified, which is a critical piece of information for reactions on cyclic systems.\n*   **Reagent and Solvent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) in tert-butyl alcohol (tBuOH). Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. The reaction conditions (strong base, secondary halide) strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction mechanism.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Substrate**\n\n*   We need to determine if (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is a *cis* or *trans* isomer. This will determine the relative positions of the substituents in the chair conformations.\n*   By assigning priorities (Br > C > H; C-Br > C-CH3) and using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules, we can determine that the (1S, 2R) configuration corresponds to the **cis isomer**, where the bromine and methyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring plane.\n\n**Step 3: Draw the Chair Conformations and Determine Their Stability**\n\n*   For a cis-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, the two possible chair conformations will have the substituents in (axial, equatorial) and (equatorial, axial) positions.\n*   Let's draw the two conformers in equilibrium:\n    *   **Conformer A:** The bromine atom is in an **axial** position, and the methyl group is in an **equatorial** position.\n    *   **Conformer B:** The bromine atom is in an **equatorial** position, and the methyl group is in an **axial** position.\n*   To determine which conformer is more stable, we compare the steric strain of having each group in the axial position. The methyl group (-CH3) is sterically larger than the bromine atom (-Br). Therefore, the conformer that places the larger methyl group in the more spacious equatorial position is more stable.\n*   **Conclusion:** Conformer A (Br-axial, CH3-equatorial) is more stable and will be present in a higher concentration at equilibrium than Conformer B (Br-equatorial, CH3-axial).\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Mechanism of the E2 Reaction**\n\n*   The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Br) and the proton being removed (β-hydrogen) must be in an **anti-periplanar** or **trans-diaxial** arrangement. This means they must both be in axial positions on adjacent carbons, with one pointing up and the other pointing down.\n*   Let's analyze the possible elimination pathways from each conformer:\n    *   **From Conformer B (Br-equatorial):** The leaving group (Br) is in an equatorial position. It is not anti-periplanar to any β-hydrogens on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6). Therefore, **E2 elimination cannot occur from this conformer.**\n    *   **From Conformer A (Br-axial):** The leaving group (Br) is in an axial position, which meets the first requirement for E2. Now we must look for an anti-periplanar β-hydrogen.\n        *   **β-hydrogen on C2:** The methyl group on C2 is in the equatorial position, which means the hydrogen on C2 is in the **axial** position. This axial hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1. Therefore, the base can remove this proton, leading to elimination.\n        *   **β-hydrogen on C6:** There are two hydrogens on C6. The axial hydrogen on C6 is *syn-periplanar* (not anti-) to the axial bromine on C1. The equatorial hydrogen is not properly aligned either. Therefore, elimination involving a proton from C6 is not possible from this conformer.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Product**\n\n*   Based on the analysis, the reaction must proceed through Conformer A.\n*   The only possible elimination pathway is the removal of the axial hydrogen from C2.\n*   This elimination forms a double bond between carbon 1 and carbon 2.\n*   The resulting alkene has a methyl group attached to one of the carbons of the double bond.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature, we number the ring to give the double bond the lowest possible numbers (C1 and C2). The methyl group is attached to C1.\n*   The name of the product is **1-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n**Careful Point: Zaitsev vs. Hofmann Rule**\n*   The Zaitsev rule predicts the formation of the more substituted (more stable) alkene. 1-methylcyclohexene (a trisubstituted alkene) is the Zaitsev product.\n*   The Hofmann rule predicts the formation of the less substituted alkene. 3-methylcyclohexene (a disubstituted alkene), which would have formed from removing a C6 proton, is the Hofmann product.\n*   Bulky bases like potassium tert-butoxide often favor the Hofmann product. However, in this case, the stereochemical requirements of the E2 reaction on the cyclohexane ring are the overriding factor. The substrate's structure only allows for the anti-periplanar arrangement that leads to the Zaitsev product. The reaction is stereospecific, and only one product can be formed.\n\n<<<1-methylcyclohexene>>>"
