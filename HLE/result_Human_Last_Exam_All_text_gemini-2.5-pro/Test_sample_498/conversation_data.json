    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sequence to determine the next letter.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Sequence**\nThe sequence given is `ZXXCVYBN_`. At first glance, it appears to be a random string of letters.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Primary Pattern**\nLet's examine the letters in the sequence by looking at a standard QWERTY keyboard layout:\n\n`Q W E R T Y U I O P`\n `A S D F G H J K L`\n  `Z X C V B N M`\n\nMost of the letters in the sequence (`Z`, `X`, `C`, `V`, `B`, `N`) come from the bottom row of the keyboard. Furthermore, they appear in the same order as they do on the keyboard, from left to right.\n\n**Step 3: Deconstructing the Sequence**\nThe sequence seems to be based on the keyboard's bottom row, but there are extra letters inserted. Let's break down the sequence based on this observation:\n\n1.  The sequence starts with the first two letters from the bottom row: `Z`, `X`.\n2.  Then, an extra letter, `X`, is inserted. The sequence is now `Z, X, X`.\n3.  Next, it takes the following two letters from the bottom row: `C`, `V`. The sequence is now `Z, X, X, C, V`.\n4.  Then, another extra letter, `Y`, is inserted. The sequence is now `Z, X, X, C, V, Y`.\n5.  Following the pattern, it takes the next two letters from the bottom row: `B`, `N`. The sequence is now `Z, X, X, C, V, Y, B, N`.\n6.  The blank (`_`) must be the next inserted letter.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the Inserted Letters**\nThe main pattern is taking pairs of letters from the keyboard's bottom row (`Z,X`, then `C,V`, then `B,N`). The pattern we need to solve is the sequence of inserted letters.\n\n*   The first inserted letter is `X`.\n*   The second inserted letter is `Y`.\n*   The third inserted letter is the one we need to find (`_`).\n\nThe sequence of inserted letters is `X, Y, _`.\n\n**Step 5: Determining the Next Inserted Letter**\nThe most logical and simple pattern for the sequence `X, Y, _` is alphabetical order. The last three letters of the alphabet are X, Y, and Z.\n\n*   After the first pair (`Z,X`), `X` is inserted.\n*   After the second pair (`C,V`), `Y` is inserted.\n*   Therefore, after the third pair (`B,N`), `Z` should be inserted.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe sequence is constructed by interleaving two patterns:\n1.  The primary pattern is pairs of letters from the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard (`ZX`, `CV`, `BN`).\n2.  The secondary pattern is the last three letters of the alphabet in order (`X`, `Y`, `Z`), which are inserted after each pair from the primary pattern.\n\nFollowing this logic, the next letter to appear in the sequence is `Z`.\n\n<<<Z>>>"
