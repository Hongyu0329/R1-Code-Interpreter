    "This is a fantastic question that points to a very specific and memorable movie scene. However, the details as remembered seem to be a composite of two different, highly-acclaimed gangster films. Let's break it down.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Elements:**\n    *   **Film Status:** Oscar-nominated.\n    *   **Location:** Boarding a bus (or similar public transport).\n    *   **Key Action:** A character says \"Thank you.\"\n    *   **Consequence:** This specific phrase seals the character's fate, leading to their demise.\n\n2.  **Initial Search & The \"Perfect Match\" Problem:**\n    *   There is a famous scene that perfectly matches the action and consequence: In the Coen Brothers' film ***Miller's Crossing*** (1990), a character named Mink (played by Steve Buscemi) is being driven out of town. As he gets in the car, he politely says \"Thank you\" to the driver. This out-of-place politeness raises the driver's suspicion, which directly leads to Mink being hunted down and killed.\n    *   **The Issue:** *Miller's Crossing*, despite being critically acclaimed, was **not nominated for any Academy Awards**. Therefore, it does not fit the primary constraint of your question.\n\n3.  **Finding the Closest Oscar-Nominated Film:**\n    *   Since no film perfectly matches all criteria, we must find the Oscar-nominated film that comes closest. The most likely candidate is ***Carlito's Way*** (1993).\n    *   **Oscar Nomination:** *Carlito's Way* fits this crucial requirement. Sean Penn was nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Scene in *Carlito's Way*:**\n    *   **The Character:** The protagonist, Carlito Brigante (played by Al Pacino).\n    *   **The Vehicle:** Carlito is not boarding a bus, but a **train** at Grand Central Station. This is a very similar form of public transport used for an escape, making it a likely point of memory confusion.\n    *   **Sealing His Fate:** Carlito's fate is sealed in this exact moment. As he is about to board the train to freedom with his pregnant girlfriend, he is ambushed and killed by a young gangster he had spared earlier in the film. While his fate was arguably sealed by that *earlier decision*, it culminates in this scene as he attempts to board the train.\n    *   **The \"Thank You\":** This is the main detail that does not match. Carlito does not say \"Thank you\" in a way that causes his death. The dialogue is between him and his killer. It is highly probable that this specific line of dialogue is a detail conflated from the *Miller's Crossing* scene.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe scene you are thinking of, where a polite \"Thank you\" seals a character's fate with a driver, is definitively from *Miller's Crossing*. However, since you specified an **Oscar-nominated** film, the correct answer is the movie that shares the other key elements: a tragic ending for a character trying to escape on public transport.\n\n<<<Carlito's Way>>>"
