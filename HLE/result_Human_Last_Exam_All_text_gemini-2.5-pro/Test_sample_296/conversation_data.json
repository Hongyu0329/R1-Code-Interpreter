    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group $G$.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Strategy**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group $G$. A standard method to count subgroups of a given index is to analyze the homomorphisms from the group into symmetric groups, but a more direct approach is to classify the subgroups based on their properties, specifically whether they are normal or not.\n\nLet $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ with index $[G:H]=4$. We can partition the set of all such subgroups into two disjoint sets:\n*   Normal subgroups of index 4.\n*   Non-normal subgroups of index 4.\n\nWe will count the number of subgroups in each set and add them up.\n\n**2. Counting Normal Subgroups of Index 4**\n\n*   **Quotient Groups:** If $H$ is a normal subgroup of index 4, the quotient group $G/H$ is a group of order 4. There are two groups of order 4 up to isomorphism: the cyclic group $C_4$ and the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n*   **Abelianization of G:** Any homomorphism from $G$ to an abelian group must factor through its abelianization, $G^{ab} = G/[G,G]$. A fundamental property of the Grigorchuk group is that its abelianization is isomorphic to the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2:\n    $G^{ab} \\cong C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$.\n*   **Homomorphisms to C4:** Since $C_4$ is abelian, any homomorphism $\\phi: G \\to C_4$ must factor through $G^{ab}$. So we are looking for homomorphisms from $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ to $C_4$. Every element in $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ has order at most 2. The image of any element under a homomorphism must have an order that divides the original element's order. Thus, the image of any homomorphism from $C_2^3$ to $C_4$ must lie within the unique subgroup of order 2 in $C_4$. This means no such homomorphism can be surjective (an epimorphism). Therefore, there are no normal subgroups $H$ in $G$ such that $G/H \\cong C_4$.\n*   **Homomorphisms to V4:** Since $V_4$ is abelian, we need to count the number of epimorphisms from $G^{ab} \\cong C_2^3$ to $V_4 \\cong C_2^2$. The number of normal subgroups with quotient $V_4$ is given by $\\frac{|\\text{Epi}(G, V_4)|}{|\\text{Aut}(V_4)|}$.\n    *   **Counting Epimorphisms:** A homomorphism from $C_2^3$ to $C_2^2$ is a linear map from the vector space $\\mathbb{F}_2^3$ to $\\mathbb{F}_2^2$. The total number of such maps is $|V_4|^3 = 4^3 = 64$. A map is not surjective if its image is a proper subgroup of $V_4$ (i.e., a subspace of dimension 0 or 1).\n        *   Image of dimension 0: Only the trivial homomorphism. (1 map)\n        *   Image of dimension 1: $V_4$ has three subgroups of order 2 (subspaces of dimension 1). For each such subgroup $K \\subset V_4$, there are $2^3-1=7$ surjective maps from $C_2^3$ to $K$. So there are $3 \\times 7 = 21$ maps whose image is a subgroup of order 2.\n        *   The number of non-surjective maps is $1 + 21 = 22$.\n        *   The number of surjective maps (epimorphisms) is $64 - 22 = 42$. So, $|\\text{Epi}(G, V_4)| = 42$.\n    *   **Counting Kernels:** The automorphism group of $V_4$ is $\\text{Aut}(V_4) \\cong GL_2(\\mathbb{F}_2)$, which has order $(2^2-1)(2^2-2) = 6$. The number of distinct kernels (which are the normal subgroups we seek) is $\\frac{42}{6} = 7$.\n*   **Conclusion for Normal Subgroups:** There are exactly **7** normal subgroups of index 4 in $G$.\n\n**3. Counting Non-Normal Subgroups of Index 4**\n\n*   **Core of a Subgroup:** Let $H$ be a non-normal subgroup of index 4. Consider the action of $G$ on the set of left cosets of $H$. This gives a homomorphism $\\rho: G \\to S_4$. The image of this homomorphism, $\\text{Im}(\\rho)$, is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The kernel of this action is the core of $H$, denoted $H_G = \\bigcap_{g \\in G} gHg^{-1}$, which is the largest normal subgroup of $G$ contained in $H$.\n*   **The Quotient G/H_G:** We have the relation $[G:H_G] = | \\text{Im}(\\rho) |$. Since $H$ is not normal, $H_G$ is a proper subgroup of $H$. Therefore, $[G:H_G] = [G:H][H:H_G] = 4 \\cdot [H:H_G] > 4$.\n*   **Possible Quotients:** As $G$ is a 2-group (all elements have order a power of 2), its homomorphic image $\\text{Im}(\\rho)$ must be a 2-group. The transitive 2-subgroups of $S_4$ are $C_4$ (order 4), $V_4$ (order 4), and the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8). Since $|\\text{Im}(\\rho)| > 4$, the only possibility is $\\text{Im}(\\rho) \\cong D_4$.\n*   **Consequence:** For any non-normal subgroup $H$ of index 4, its core $H_G$ must be a normal subgroup of $G$ with quotient $G/H_G \\cong D_4$.\n*   **Uniqueness of the D4 Quotient:** A deep result about the Grigorchuk group states that it has a unique normal subgroup $N$ such that the quotient $G/N$ is isomorphic to $D_4$. This normal subgroup $N$ is the stabilizer of the second level of the binary tree on which $G$ acts.\n*   **Finding the Subgroups:** It follows that for any non-normal subgroup $H$ of index 4, its core must be this unique normal subgroup $N$. This means $N \\subset H$. By the Correspondence Theorem, these subgroups $H$ are in one-to-one correspondence with subgroups of $G/N \\cong D_4$. The index must match: $[G:H]=4$, so we must have $[G/N : H/N] = [G:H] = 4$.\n    This means $H/N$ must be a subgroup of index 4 in $D_4$. Since $|D_4|=8$, $H/N$ must be a subgroup of order 2.\n*   **Subgroups of Order 2 in D4:** The group $D_4$ has exactly 5 involutions (elements of order 2), and thus 5 subgroups of order 2.\n    *   One subgroup is the center, $Z(D_4)$, which is normal in $D_4$.\n    *   The other four subgroups are generated by reflections and are not normal in $D_4$.\n*   **Mapping Back to G:** Each of these 5 subgroups of $D_4$ gives rise to a subgroup of index 4 in $G$ via the preimage map $\\pi^{-1}$, where $\\pi: G \\to G/N \\cong D_4$ is the projection. A subgroup $H = \\pi^{-1}(K)$ is normal in $G$ if and only if $K = H/N$ is normal in $D_4$.\n    *   The preimage of the normal subgroup $Z(D_4)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ of index $[D_4 : Z(D_4)] = 4$. This subgroup is one of the 7 normal subgroups we found in Step 2.\n    *   The preimages of the 4 non-normal subgroups of order 2 in $D_4$ result in 4 distinct non-normal subgroups of index 4 in $G$.\n*   **Conclusion for Non-Normal Subgroups:** There are exactly **4** non-normal subgroups of index 4 in $G$.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nThe total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of the normal and non-normal ones.\nTotal Subgroups = (Number of normal subgroups) + (Number of non-normal subgroups)\nTotal Subgroups = 7 + 4 = 11."
