The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is highly dependent on the specific reaction due to the different roles Ni plays.
*   **For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction:** The optimal performance is achieved with an intermediate Ni loading that balances the number of active Ni sites with the benefits of high dispersion and strong support interaction. The ideal **Ni/Ce molar ratio is in the range of 0.2 to 0.4**.
*   **For thermochemical Water Splitting (WS):** The optimal performance is achieved when Ni acts as a dopant within the ceria lattice to enhance its redox properties. This requires a much lower concentration to avoid phase separation of NiO. The ideal **Ni/Ce molar ratio is in the range of 0.05 to 0.15**.
