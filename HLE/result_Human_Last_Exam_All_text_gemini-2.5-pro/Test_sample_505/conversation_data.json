    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem Components:**\n    *   **Surface Code:** A type of topological quantum error-correcting code laid out on a 2D surface.\n    *   **Logical Qubit:** A qubit encoded using many physical qubits for protection against errors.\n    *   **Patches:** The problem specifies two separate, physically disconnected regions (patches) of surface code.\n    *   **Holes:** These are topological features, essentially boundaries created inside a patch. We have a total of two holes to distribute among the two patches.\n    *   **Goal:** Find the *maximum* possible number of logical qubits. This means we should choose the arrangement of holes that yields the highest number.\n\n2.  **How Logical Qubits are Encoded in a Surface Code Patch:**\n    The number of logical qubits a single patch can encode depends on its topology (its shape and the number of holes). The patches are physically separate, so the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits encoded in each patch.\n    *   **Patch with Zero Holes (Standard Planar Code):** A simple, rectangular patch of surface code with no holes is typically constructed to encode **one** logical qubit. This is achieved by using specific types of boundaries (e.g., 'rough' and 'smooth' boundaries) that allow for logical operators to stretch between opposite edges.\n    *   **Patch with Holes:** When holes are introduced into a patch, they create new boundaries. The topology of these holes can be used to define logical qubits. For a planar patch (a surface that is topologically equivalent to a disk), the number of logical qubits that can be encoded is equal to the number of holes ($h$).\n        *   A patch with $h=1$ hole can encode $k=1$ logical qubit.\n        *   A patch with $h=2$ holes can encode $k=2$ logical qubits.\n    *   **Important Point:** When a patch has holes, the logical qubit structure of the simple planar code is generally lost. The logical operators defined by the holes do not commute with the operators of the original planar code qubit. Therefore, a patch with $h$ holes encodes $k=h$ logical qubits, not $k=1+h$.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Possible Configurations:**\n    We have two patches (Patch A, Patch B) and two holes to distribute. There are two distinct ways to do this:\n\n    *   **Configuration 1: Both holes in one patch.**\n        *   Let's place both holes in Patch A and leave Patch B with no holes.\n        *   **Patch A:** Has 2 holes ($h_A = 2$). Based on our rule, this patch can encode **2 logical qubits**.\n        *   **Patch B:** Has 0 holes ($h_B = 0$). This patch can be configured as a standard planar code to encode **1 logical qubit**.\n        *   **Total for Configuration 1:** $k_{total} = k_A + k_B = 2 + 1 = 3$ logical qubits.\n\n    *   **Configuration 2: One hole in each patch.**\n        *   Let's place one hole in Patch A and one hole in Patch B.\n        *   **Patch A:** Has 1 hole ($h_A = 1$). This patch can encode **1 logical qubit**.\n        *   **Patch B:** Has 1 hole ($h_B = 1$). This patch also encodes **1 logical qubit**.\n        *   **Total for Configuration 2:** $k_{total} = k_A + k_B = 1 + 1 = 2$ logical qubits.\n\n4.  **Determining the Maximum:**\n    By comparing the two configurations, we find:\n    *   Configuration 1 yields 3 logical qubits.\n    *   Configuration 2 yields 2 logical qubits.\n\n    The maximum number of logical qubits is achieved in Configuration 1.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nTo maximize the number of logical qubits, we should concentrate the holes in one patch and use the other patch as a standard planar code. This arrangement yields a total of 3 logical qubits.\n\n<<<3>>>"
