    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Premise**\n\n*   **Core Theory:** We are working with the JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge, which states that for a subject S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    1.  P is true (T).\n    2.  S believes that P is true (B).\n    3.  S is justified in believing that P is true (J).\n*   **Primary Constraint:** The only available epistemic states are **Knowledge** and **Belief**. This creates a strict binary. If a proposition is held in a way that does not meet the criteria for Knowledge, it must be classified as Belief.\n*   **Exclusion:** We must ignore Gettier problems. Gettier problems are cases where JTB is satisfied, but intuition suggests the state is not knowledge due to epistemic luck (e.g., being right for the wrong reasons). Our focus must be on other flaws in the JTB model under the given constraints.\n\n**2. Analyze the Implications of the Constraint**\n\nThe binary {Knowledge, Belief} system means that any doxastic state (a state related to belief) that is not Knowledge is, by definition, Belief.\n*   **Knowledge** = Justified (J) + True (T) + Belief (B)\n*   **Belief** = Any belief that is *not* Knowledge. This means Belief becomes a catch-all category for:\n    *   Justified False Beliefs (J + not T + B)\n    *   Unjustified True Beliefs (not J + T + B)\n    *   Unjustified False Beliefs (not J + not T + B)\n\nThe core of the task is to see how this rigid binary system exposes or creates problems for the JTB components themselves: Justification (J) and Truth (T).\n\n**3. Identifying the First Problem: The Justification Condition (J)**\n\nThe JTB theory requires justification. But how does an agent determine if their belief is actually justified? To move from a state of \"Belief\" to \"Knowledge,\" an agent must satisfy the justification condition.\n\n*   **The Challenge:** Consider an agent who wants to determine if they *know* P or merely *believe* P. According to JTB, they must check if their belief in P is justified.\n*   **The Regress:** To be sure they know P, they must be sure their justification is adequate. This implies they must have knowledge about their justification. Let's call the proposition \"My belief in P is justified\" Jp. To know P, the agent must know Jp.\n*   **Applying JTB to Jp:** To know Jp, the agent's belief in Jp must itself be a *Justified True Belief*. This means they need a justification for their justification (let's call it J2). This leads to an infinite regress: to know P, you must know your justification is valid, which requires a justification for that justification, and so on, ad infinitum (K(P) → K(Jp) → K(J2) → ...).\n*   **How the Constraint Worsens It:** The strict binary of {Knowledge, Belief} makes this problem acute. There is no middle ground, such as simply \"having a justified belief.\" The agent must either *know* their belief is justified (which triggers the regress) or merely *believe* it's justified. If they only *believe* it, it is not sufficient to guarantee that the J condition for the original proposition P is met, leaving them unable to confirm they have Knowledge.\n\nThis first problem is the **Infinite Regress of Justification**.\n\n**4. Identifying the Second Problem: The Truth Condition (T)**\n\nThe JTB theory posits that for a belief to count as knowledge, it must be true. This condition is external to the agent's mind.\n\n*   **The Challenge:** An agent's epistemic access is limited to their internal states: their beliefs and their justifications. They cannot \"step outside\" of their own perspective to directly check if their belief corresponds to external reality (i.e., if it is true).\n*   **Indistinguishable States:** Consider two scenarios:\n    1.  An agent has a belief P, has excellent justification for it, and P happens to be **true**. According to JTB and our binary system, the agent is in the state of **Knowledge**.\n    2.  An agent has a belief P, has the exact same excellent justification for it, but P happens to be **false**. According to JTB and our binary system, the agent is in the state of **Belief**.\n*   **The Agent's Perspective:** From the agent's first-person point of view, these two scenarios are identical. They have the same belief and the same internal feeling of being justified. The only difference is the truth-value of P, an external fact to which they have no direct access.\n*   **The Consequence:** This means an agent can never reliably determine whether they are in the state of Knowledge or the state of Belief. The distinction between the only two available epistemic states hinges on a factor that is inaccessible to the agent. JTB therefore fails to provide a usable, first-person criterion for identifying knowledge.\n\nThis second problem is the **Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition**.\n\n---\n<<<The two problems for the JTB definition under these constraints are:\n1.  **The Regress of Justification:** The JTB model requires a belief to be justified. For an agent to confirm they have knowledge, they must know that their justification is valid. Applying the JTB criteria to this new requirement means the agent must have a *justified* belief about their justification, leading to an infinite regress where each justification requires another justification.\n2.  **The Inaccessibility of Truth:** The JTB model's truth condition is external to the agent and cannot be directly verified from their first-person perspective. This makes it impossible for an agent to distinguish between a Justified True Belief (Knowledge) and a subjectively identical Justified False Belief (which is categorized as Belief), rendering the distinction between the two available epistemic states unverifiable by the agent themselves.>>>"
