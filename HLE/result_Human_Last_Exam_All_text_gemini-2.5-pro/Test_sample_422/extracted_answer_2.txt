The two problems for the JTB definition under these constraints are:
1.  **The Regress of Justification:** The JTB model requires a belief to be justified. For an agent to confirm they have knowledge, they must know that their justification is valid. Applying the JTB criteria to this new requirement means the agent must have a *justified* belief about their justification, leading to an infinite regress where each justification requires another justification.
2.  **The Inaccessibility of Truth:** The JTB model's truth condition is external to the agent and cannot be directly verified from their first-person perspective. This makes it impossible for an agent to distinguish between a Justified True Belief (Knowledge) and a subjectively identical Justified False Belief (which is categorized as Belief), rendering the distinction between the two available epistemic states unverifiable by the agent themselves.
