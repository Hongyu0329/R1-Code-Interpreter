    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided answer choices.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe question asks to identify which of the listed classical ballet steps concludes with the legs in the exact same position as they started. This means if the step begins in fifth position with the right foot in front, it must also end in fifth position with the right foot in front.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points\n*   **Position vs. Configuration:** We need to consider not just the position of the feet (e.g., fifth position) but also which foot is in front and which is in back.\n*   **Default Definition:** Some step names have variations. We should consider the most common or definitional form of the specific step listed.\n*   **Terminology:** The French terminology in ballet is precise. Words like `changé` (changed), `derrière` (behind), or numerical counts can indicate whether the feet switch places.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Answer Choice\n\n**A. Entrechat six**\n*   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Movement:** `Entrechat` is a jump where the legs beat against each other in the air. The number `six` indicates six movements (three openings and three closings/beats). In an `entrechat`, if the number of beats divided by two is an odd number (e.g., `royal`/two, `six`, `dix`), the feet land in the opposite position from where they started. For `entrechat six`, you start with the right foot front and land with the left foot front.\n*   **Ending Position:** Same position (fifth), but different leg configuration (feet are changed).\n*   **Conclusion:** This step changes the leg position.\n\n**B. Échappé battu changé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Movement:** `Échappé` is a jump \"escaping\" from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second). `Battu` means it is \"beaten\" as the legs come back together. The word `changé` explicitly means \"changed.\"\n*   **Ending Position:** The step is designed to finish in fifth position with the feet switched (e.g., left foot front).\n*   **Conclusion:** This step, by its very name, changes the leg position.\n\n**C. Assemblé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Movement:** `Assemblé` means \"to assemble.\" The dancer brushes one leg out, jumps off the supporting leg, and brings (\"assembles\") both legs together in the air to land simultaneously in fifth position. There are many types of `assemblé`:\n    *   `Assemblé dessus` (over): The front foot brushes out to the side and lands back in front. **The position does not change.**\n    *   `Assemblé dessous` (under): The back foot brushes out to the side and lands back in the back. **The position does not change.**\n    *   Variations like `assemblé en avant` (traveling forward) or `assemblé porté` (carried) often do change the feet.\n*   **Ending Position:** Since the question provides the general term \"Assemblé,\" and standard, non-traveling forms of the step do not change the feet, this is a valid candidate. Unlike the other options, changing the feet is not inherent to its primary definition.\n*   **Conclusion:** This step can be, and often is, performed without changing the starting leg position.\n\n**D. Glissade derrière**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Movement:** `Glissade` means \"to glide.\" It's a linking step. `Derrière` means \"behind,\" which in this context specifies that the movement begins with the back foot sliding out. The front foot then closes *behind* the foot that initiated the movement.\n*   **Ending Position:** If you start with the right foot front, the left foot (back foot) glides out, and the right foot closes behind it. The final position is fifth with the left foot in front.\n*   **Conclusion:** This specific type of `glissade` changes the leg position.\n\n**E. Gargouillade**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Movement:** This is a decorative step, like a `pas de chat` but with a circular `rond de jambe` movement from each leg in the air. The standard execution of a `gargouillade` involves a change of feet. The dancer typically lands on one foot, with the other closing in front, resulting in the feet being switched.\n*   **Ending Position:** Fifth position with the feet changed (e.g., left foot front).\n*   **Conclusion:** This step changes the leg position.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nAfter analyzing all the options, `Entrechat six`, `Échappé battu changé`, `Glissade derrière`, and `Gargouillade` are all steps that, by their specific definition, result in the dancer's feet changing position. `Assemblé` is the only step on the list that has common, fundamental variations (`dessus` and `dessous`) where the starting and ending leg positions are identical.\n\n<<<C>>>"
