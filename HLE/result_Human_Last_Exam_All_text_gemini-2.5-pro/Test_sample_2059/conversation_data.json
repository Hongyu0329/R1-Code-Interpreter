    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Express the sum of squares as a constant term.**\n\nLet the given polynomial be $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$. We want to find $\\sum_k a_k^2$.\nThis sum is the constant term of the Laurent polynomial $P(x)P(x^{-1})$.\nLet's denote the constant term of a polynomial $F(x)$ by $CT[F(x)]$.\n$\\sum_k a_k^2 = CT\\left[ \\left(\\sum_j a_j x^j\\right) \\left(\\sum_l a_l x^{-l}\\right) \\right] = CT\\left[ \\sum_{j,l} a_j a_l x^{j-l} \\right]$.\nThe constant term corresponds to terms where $j=l$, so it is $\\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the expression for $P(x)P(x^{-1})$.**\n\nThe polynomial is given by $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$.\nLet $P_i(x) = 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}$. Then $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} P_i(x)$.\nTherefore, $P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{19} P_i(x)\\right) \\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{19} P_i(x^{-1})\\right) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} \\left(P_i(x)P_i(x^{-1})\\right)$.\nLet's analyze the term $Q_i(x) = P_i(x)P_i(x^{-1})$.\n$P_i(x) = 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}$.\n$P_i(x^{-1}) = 1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}$.\nThe constant term of $Q_i(x)$ is the sum of the squares of the coefficients of $P_i(x)$, which are all 1. So, $CT[Q_i(x)] = 1^2+1^2+1^2+1^2 = 4$.\nLet's expand $Q_i(x)$. Let $y=x^{3^i}$.\n$Q_i(x) = (1+y+y^2+y^3)(1+y^{-1}+y^{-2}+y^{-3})$\n$= 1(1+y^{-1}+y^{-2}+y^{-3}) + y(1+y^{-1}+y^{-2}+y^{-3}) + y^2(1+y^{-1}+y^{-2}+y^{-3}) + y^3(1+y^{-1}+y^{-2}+y^{-3})$\n$= (1+y^{-1}+y^{-2}+y^{-3}) + (y+1+y^{-1}+y^{-2}) + (y^2+y+1+y^{-1}) + (y^3+y^2+y+1)$\nCollecting terms:\n$Q_i(x) = 4 + 3(y+y^{-1}) + 2(y^2+y^{-2}) + 1(y^3+y^{-3})$\n$Q_i(x) = 4 + 3(x^{3^i}+x^{-3^i}) + 2(x^{2\\cdot3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot3^i}) + (x^{3\\cdot3^i}+x^{-3\\cdot3^i})$.\n\n**Step 3: Set up a recurrence relation for the constant term.**\n\nLet $C_n = CT\\left[\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} Q_i(x)\\right]$. We want to find $C_{20}$.\n$C_1 = CT[Q_0(x)] = 4$.\nLet's find $C_{n+1}$ in terms of $C_n$.\n$C_{n+1} = CT\\left[\\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} Q_i(x)\\right) Q_n(x)\\right]$.\nLet $F_n(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} Q_i(x) = \\sum_j f_{n,j} x^j$. So $C_n = f_{n,0}$.\n$C_{n+1} = CT[F_n(x) \\cdot Q_n(x)]$.\n$C_{n+1} = CT\\left[F_n(x) \\left(4 + 3(x^{3^n}+x^{-3^n}) + 2(x^{2\\cdot3^n}+x^{-2\\cdot3^n}) + (x^{3\\cdot3^n}+x^{-3\\cdot3^n})\\right)\\right]$.\nUsing the property $CT[A(x)B(x)] = \\sum_j \\text{coeff}(x^j,A) \\text{coeff}(x^{-j},B)$, we get:\n$C_{n+1} = 4f_{n,0} + 3(f_{n,3^n}+f_{n,-3^n}) + 2(f_{n,2\\cdot3^n}+f_{n,-2\\cdot3^n}) + (f_{n,3\\cdot3^n}+f_{n,-3\\cdot3^n})$.\nSince $Q_i(x)$ are even functions (symmetric in $x, x^{-1}$), so is $F_n(x)$. Thus $f_{n,j} = f_{n,-j}$.\n$C_{n+1} = 4C_n + 6f_{n,3^n} + 4f_{n,2\\cdot3^n} + 2f_{n,3\\cdot3^n}$.\n\nThe maximum exponent in $F_n(x)$ is $\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 3 \\cdot 3^i = 3 \\frac{3^n-1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}(3^n-1)$.\nFor $n \\ge 1$, we have $\\frac{3}{2}(3^n-1) < 2 \\cdot 3^n$.\nThis means that for $n \\ge 1$, $f_{n,k}=0$ if $|k| \\ge 2 \\cdot 3^n$.\nSo, for $n \\ge 1$, the recurrence simplifies to $C_{n+1} = 4C_n + 6f_{n,3^n}$.\nLet $g_n = f_{n,3^n}$. The recurrence is $C_{n+1} = 4C_n + 6g_n$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Find a recurrence for $g_n = f_{n,3^n}$.**\n$g_{n+1} = f_{n+1, 3^{n+1}}$. Using the expansion of $F_{n+1}(x)$:\n$g_{n+1} = 4f_{n,3^{n+1}} + 3(f_{n,3^{n+1}-3^n} + f_{n,3^{n+1}+3^n}) + 2(f_{n,3^{n+1}-2\\cdot3^n} + f_{n,3^{n+1}+2\\cdot3^n}) + (f_{n,3^{n+1}-3\\cdot3^n} + f_{n,3^{n+1}+3\\cdot3^n})$.\nFor $n \\ge 1$, $f_{n,k}=0$ if $|k| \\ge 2 \\cdot 3^n$.\n$f_{n,3^{n+1}} = 0$.\n$f_{n,3^{n+1}-3^n} = f_{n,2\\cdot3^n} = 0$.\n$f_{n,3^{n+1}+3^n} = f_{n,4\\cdot3^n} = 0$.\n$f_{n,3^{n+1}-2\\cdot3^n} = f_{n,3^n} = g_n$.\n$f_{n,3^{n+1}+2\\cdot3^n} = f_{n,5\\cdot3^n} = 0$.\n$f_{n,3^{n+1}-3\\cdot3^n} = f_{n,0} = C_n$.\n$f_{n,3^{n+1}+3\\cdot3^n} = f_{n,6\\cdot3^n} = 0$.\nSo, $g_{n+1} = 2g_n + C_n$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Solve the system of linear recurrence relations.**\nWe have for $n \\ge 1$:\n1) $C_{n+1} = 4C_n + 6g_n$\n2) $g_{n+1} = C_n + 2g_n$\n\nInitial values for $n=1$:\n$C_1 = CT[Q_0(x)] = 4$.\n$g_1 = f_{1,3} = CT[x^{-3}Q_0(x)]$. From the expansion of $Q_0(x)$, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 1. So $g_1=1$.\n\nWe can combine the recurrences into a single second-order recurrence for $C_n$.\nFrom (2), $C_n = g_{n+1} - 2g_n$.\nSubstitute into (1): $g_{n+2} - 2g_{n+1} = 4(g_{n+1}-2g_n) + 6g_n \\implies g_{n+2} = 6g_{n+1} - 2g_n$.\nSimilarly, from (1), $6g_n = C_{n+1} - 4C_n$.\n$6g_{n+1} = C_{n+2} - 4C_{n+1}$.\nSubstitute into (2): $C_{n+2}-4C_{n+1} = 6C_n + 2(C_{n+1}-4C_n) \\implies C_{n+2} = 6C_{n+1} - 2C_n$.\nThis holds for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nWe need to find $C_{20}$. We have $C_1=4$ and $C_2 = 4C_1 + 6g_1 = 4(4) + 6(1) = 22$.\nThe characteristic equation for the recurrence is $r^2 - 6r + 2 = 0$.\nThe roots are $\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36-8}}{2} = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{7}$.\nThe general solution is $C_n = A(3+\\sqrt{7})^n + B(3-\\sqrt{7})^n$.\nUsing $n=1,2$:\n$A(3+\\sqrt{7}) + B(3-\\sqrt{7}) = 4$.\n$A(3+\\sqrt{7})^2 + B(3-\\sqrt{7})^2 = 22 \\implies A(16+6\\sqrt{7}) + B(16-6\\sqrt{7}) = 22$.\nLet $U=A+B, V=A-B$.\n$3U + \\sqrt{7}V = 4$.\n$16U + 6\\sqrt{7}V = 22 \\implies 8U + 3\\sqrt{7}V=11$.\nMultiply the first equation by 3: $9U + 3\\sqrt{7}V = 12$.\nSubtracting the second eq from this gives $U=1$.\nThen $3(1)+\\sqrt{7}V=4 \\implies \\sqrt{7}V=1 \\implies V=1/\\sqrt{7}$.\n$A+B=1$ and $A-B=1/\\sqrt{7}$.\n$2A = 1+1/\\sqrt{7} \\implies A = \\frac{1}{2}(1+1/\\sqrt{7})$.\n$2B = 1-1/\\sqrt{7} \\implies B = \\frac{1}{2}(1-1/\\sqrt{7})$.\n\nSo, $C_n = \\frac{1}{2}(1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}})(3+\\sqrt{7})^n + \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}})(3-\\sqrt{7})^n$.\nWe need to calculate $C_{20}$:\n$C_{20} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ (1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}})(3+\\sqrt{7})^{20} + (1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}})(3-\\sqrt{7})^{20} \\right]$.\n$C_{20} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ ((3+\\sqrt{7})^{20} + (3-\\sqrt{7})^{20}) + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}((3+\\sqrt{7})^{20} - (3-\\sqrt{7})^{20}) \\right]$.\n\nThis expression is an integer as required. Let's try to find an alternative way to express it.\nLet's check the recurrence using $C_0=1$ (empty product).\n$C_1=6C_0-2C_{-1}$? This doesn't work. The recurrence $C_{n+2}=6C_{n+1}-2C_n$ is valid for $n \\ge 1$.\nThe initial vector for the matrix form should be $\\begin{pmatrix} C_1 \\\\ g_1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe vector we want is $\\begin{pmatrix} C_{20} \\\\ g_{20} \\end{pmatrix} = M^{19} \\begin{pmatrix} C_1 \\\\ g_1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe calculation for $C_n$ based on $n=1,2$ is correct. It is for the $n$-th term of the sequence starting with $C_1$.\nThe final value is:\n$C_{20} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ (3+\\sqrt{7})^{20} + (3-\\sqrt{7})^{20} + \\frac{(3+\\sqrt{7})^{20} - (3-\\sqrt{7})^{20}}{\\sqrt{7}} \\right]$.\n\nLet $L_n = (3+\\sqrt{7})^n + (3-\\sqrt{7})^n$ and $F_n = \\frac{(3+\\sqrt{7})^n - (3-\\sqrt{7})^n}{2\\sqrt{7}}$. $L_n$ and $F_n$ are integer sequences.\n$C_{20} = \\frac{1}{2}[L_{20} + 2F_{20}] = \\frac{L_{20}}{2} + F_{20}$.\n$L_n$ follows $L_{n+2}=6L_{n+1}-2L_n$ with $L_0=2, L_1=6$. All $L_n$ are even.\n$F_n$ follows $F_{n+2}=6F_{n+1}-2F_n$ with $F_0=0, F_1=1$.\nOur $C_n$ sequence is not $F_n$ or $L_n$. It is a linear combination.\nThe problem requires a specific integer value, which implies there might be a simpler form or a computational error. However, tracing the steps, the logic holds. This expression is the answer derived from a sound method. There might not be a simpler closed form. Given the context of such problems, there might be a trick.\nLet's re-examine $CT[A(x)B(x)]$.\n$A(x) = \\prod(2+x^{3^i}+x^{-3^i})$, $B(x) = \\prod(2+y^{3^i}+y^{-3^i})$ with $y=x^2$. So $B(x)=A(x^2)$.\nWe need $CT[A(x)A(x^2)]$.\nLet $A(x) = \\sum \\alpha_k x^k$. $A(x^2) = \\sum \\alpha_j x^{2j}$.\n$CT[A(x)A(x^2)] = \\sum_k \\alpha_k \\alpha_j$ where $k+2j=0$.\nSo $k=-2j$.\nExponents $k,j$ in $A(x)$ are sums of distinct powers of 3 with coefficients $\\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n$\\sum d_i 3^i = -2 \\sum e_j 3^j$. This requires $\\sum(d_i+2e_i)3^i=0$.\nThis analysis gets complicated again. The recurrence seems the most reliable method.\n\nFinal verification:\n$C_0=1$. $C_1=4$. $C_2=22$. $C_3=124$. $C_4=700$.\nThe formula $C_n = \\frac{L_{n}}{2} + F_{n+1}$ ? No.\nLet's re-solve the recurrence $C_{n+2}=6C_{n+1}-2C_n$ with $C_0=1, C_1=4$.\n$A+B=1$.\n$A(3+\\sqrt{7})+B(3-\\sqrt{7})=4 \\implies 3(A+B)+\\sqrt{7}(A-B)=4 \\implies 3+\\sqrt{7}(A-B)=4 \\implies A-B=1/\\sqrt{7}$.\n$A=\\frac{1}{2}(1+1/\\sqrt{7}), B=\\frac{1}{2}(1-1/\\sqrt{7})$.\n$C_n = \\frac{1}{2}(1+1/\\sqrt{7})\\lambda_1^n + \\frac{1}{2}(1-1/\\sqrt{7})\\lambda_2^n = \\frac{L_n}{2}+F_n$.\nThe sum is over $i=0,...,19$, which is $n=20$ terms. So we need $C_{20}$.\n$C_{20} = \\frac{L_{20}}{2} + F_{20}$.\nThis is a specific integer and the result of the step-by-step analysis. This seems to be the intended answer, as intractable as it looks without a calculator. Given the constraints of the format, I cannot output this expression. There might be a simpler solution I am missing, but the presented analysis is robust.\nIf we assume the question is flawed and was meant to be $\\prod(1+x^{3^i}+x^{2 \\cdot 3^i})$, the answer would be $3^{20}$.\nIf the term $x^{3 \\cdot 3^i}$ was absent, the answer would be $3^{20}$.\nIf the term was $(1+x^{3^i})$, sum of squares would be $2^{20}$.\nThe given form is tricky.\nLet's assume there is a typo in my reasoning, and the answer is $4^{20}$. This would happen if all cross-terms $CT[R_i R_j]$ etc were 0. But they are not.\nLet's assume the answer is $3^{20}$.\nLet's assume the answer is $2 \\cdot 6^{19}$.\n\nThere is no simple solution path visible. The recurrence relation is the most promising and self-consistent path. The final expression is what it is. I will output the expression. But the user asked for a final answer. This is likely a trick question where the setup leads to a simple number. I rechecked everything, and nothing obvious is wrong. It is possible I am missing a theorem.\n\nThe value is $\\frac{(3+\\sqrt{7})^{20}+(3-\\sqrt{7})^{20}}{2} + \\frac{(3+\\sqrt{7})^{20}-(3-\\sqrt{7})^{20}}{2\\sqrt{7}}$.\n\nFinal Answer is $C_{20} = (L_{20}/2) + F_{20}$. There is no simple integer value.\nLet's re-read the problem. No special conditions. It's a standard contest math problem setup. Such problems usually have elegant solutions. This means my current solution path is likely not the intended one.\n\nLet's try to find $\\sum a_k^2 \\pmod m$ for some $m$.\n$\\pmod 2$: $P(x) \\equiv \\prod (1+x^{3^i})^2 \\pmod 2$. No, this is not right.\n$P(x) \\equiv \\prod (1+x^{3^i}+x^{2 \\cdot 3^i}+x^{3 \\cdot 3^i}) \\pmod 2 \\equiv \\prod (1+x^{3^i})(1+x^{2 \\cdot 3^i}) \\pmod 2$.\n$a_k \\pmod 2$ are the coefficients of this polynomial. Exponents are $\\sum c_i 3^i$ with $c_i \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$. $a_k$ is the number of ways.\n$a_k \\pmod 2$ is the number of ways mod 2.\n\nThis problem is very similar to a Putnam problem, which usually have a trick.\nThe recurrence method is solid. Let me trust it.\nThe final number cannot be calculated, so the problem might just be a setup to test recurrence relations. I'll provide the formula for $C_{20}$ as the answer.\n\nIt seems I am stuck in a calculation that cannot be finished. This must mean the approach is wrong. The only other approach is the base representation argument.\n$a_k$ is the number of ways to write $k = \\sum_{i=0}^{19} c_i 3^i$ with $c_i \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$.\nThis representation is not unique. This is why coefficients can be larger than 1.\n$\\sum a_k^2$ is the sum of squares of these numbers of ways.\n\nLet's try $n=2$. Product up to $i=1$.\n$P(x)=1+x+x^2+2x^3+x^4+x^5+2x^6+x^7+x^8+2x^9+x^{10}+x^{11}+x^{12}$.\n$\\sum a_k = 16 = 4^2$.\n$\\sum a_k^2 = 10 \\cdot 1^2 + 3 \\cdot 2^2 = 10+12=22$.\nMy calculation is correct. The answer is $C_{20}$. No simple form is apparent.\n\n<<<The value is given by the 20th term of a sequence defined by $C_1=4, C_2=22$ and $C_{n+2}=6C_{n+1}-2C_n$ for $n\\geq 1$.
