    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a specific \"book of manners\" that was physically preserved in the same manuscript as the story of \"Sir Launfal\".\n\n2.  **Identify \"Sir Launfal\":** \"Sir Launfal\" is a Middle English romance poem. However, the story exists in several versions, and the name can refer to more than one of them. The most famous is the poem by Thomas Chestre (c. 1400), but there is also an earlier version by Marie de France (*Lanval*) and a later, anonymous version often called *Sir Lambewell*.\n\n3.  **Investigate the Manuscript of Thomas Chestre's *Sir Launfal***: The primary version of *Sir Launfal* by Thomas Chestre is preserved in a single manuscript: **British Library, MS Cotton Caligula A.ii**. This manuscript is a miscellany containing many Middle English romances, such as *Sir Isumbras* and *Sir Eglamour of Artois*. However, it does not contain a work specifically known as a \"book of manners\". This suggests the question may refer to a different version of the story.\n\n4.  **Investigate Other Versions and Manuscripts:** A later version of the Launfal story, titled *Sir Lambewell*, is found in another important manuscript: the **Findern Manuscript** (housed at Cambridge University Library as MS Ff.1.6). This manuscript is a famous anthology of 15th-century poetry.\n\n5.  **Examine the Contents of the Findern Manuscript:** When we look at the table of contents for the Findern Manuscript, we find that it contains both the romance *Sir Lambewell* and a short instructional poem on etiquette and proper behavior.\n\n6.  **Identify the \"Book of Manners\":** The specific work on etiquette found in the Findern Manuscript alongside *Sir Lambewell* is a courtesy poem known as **\"The Book of Courtesy\"**. This text instructs a young person on how to behave in polite society.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** By connecting the story of Launfal (in the form of *Sir Lambewell*) to the correct manuscript (the Findern Manuscript), we can identify the book of manners it was preserved alongside.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Sir Launfal\":** The key to solving this is recognizing that the question might not be referring to the most famous version of the poem by Thomas Chestre, but to a different version of the same tale (*Sir Lambewell*).\n*   **Importance of the Manuscript:** The answer depends entirely on identifying the correct historical manuscript. The contents of Cotton Caligula A.ii (Chestre's version) are different from the Findern Manuscript (*Sir Lambewell*'s version).\n*   **Specific Title:** The \"book of manners\" is not a generic description but the actual title of a specific poem within the manuscript: \"The Book of Courtesy\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the book of manners preserved alongside a version of the Sir Launfal story is \"The Book of Courtesy\".\n\n<<<The Book of Courtesy>>>"
