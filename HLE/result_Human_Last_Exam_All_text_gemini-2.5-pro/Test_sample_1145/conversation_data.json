    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics of the System\n\nThe problem describes a particle in a one-dimensional (1D) infinite potential well, often called a \"particle in a box\". The key physical principles are:\n1.  **The Wavefunction (ψ):** The state of the particle is described by a wavefunction, ψ(x). The wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' (from x=0 to x=a) is given by:\n    $ψ_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n    where 'n' is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), representing the energy level.\n2.  **Probability Density (P(x)):** We cannot know the exact position of the particle, only the probability of finding it in a certain region. The probability of finding the particle per unit length at a position x is the probability density, which is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n    $P(x) = |\\psi_n(x)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n3.  **Probability in an Interval:** To find the total probability of locating the particle in a finite interval from $x_1$ to $x_2$, we must integrate the probability density over that interval:\n    $Prob(x_1 \\le x \\le x_2) = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} P(x) dx = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right) dx$\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Specifics of the Question\n\n*   **Quantum State:** The particle is in the `n = 2` state.\n*   **Box Length:** The box has a length `a`.\n*   **Interval:** We are interested in the interval from $x_1 = 0.495a$ to $x_2 = 0.505a$.\n\nSo, the probability density function for this specific case is:\n$P_2(x) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n\nThe probability we need to calculate is:\n$Prob = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) dx$\n\n### Step 3: Analyze and Solve the Integral\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Nature of the Interval**\nThe interval is from 0.495a to 0.505a. This is a very small interval of width $\\Delta x = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a$. It is centered at $x_c = 0.5a$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The Wavefunction at the Center of the Interval**\nFor `n = 2`, the wavefunction at the center of the box ($x = 0.5a$) is:\n$\\psi_2(0.5a) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi (0.5a)}{a}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin(\\pi) = 0$\nThis means the center of our interval is a **node**, a point where the probability of finding the particle is zero. Therefore, a simple approximation like $Prob \\approx P(x_c) \\Delta x$ would incorrectly yield a probability of 0. We must use a more careful method.\n\n**Method: Approximation for a Small Interval Around a Node**\nSince the interval is very small, we can approximate the `sin` function around the node at $x=0.5a$.\nLet's define a new variable, $u = x - 0.5a$, which represents the displacement from the center.\n*   Then $x = u + 0.5a$.\n*   The integration limits for $u$ are from $0.495a - 0.5a = -0.005a$ to $0.505a - 0.5a = +0.005a$.\n\nSubstitute $x = u + 0.5a$ into the argument of the sine function:\n$\\frac{2\\pi x}{a} = \\frac{2\\pi (u + 0.5a)}{a} = \\frac{2\\pi u}{a} + \\pi$\n\nNow substitute this into the probability density:\n$P_2(x) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\pi + \\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right)$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin(\\pi + \\theta) = -\\sin(\\theta)$, we get $\\sin^2(\\pi + \\theta) = \\sin^2(\\theta)$.\n$P_2(u) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right)$\n\n**Careful Point 3: Small Angle Approximation**\nThe integration interval for $u$ is from $-0.005a$ to $0.005a$. The argument of the sine function, $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi u}{a}$, is therefore very small. We can use the small-angle approximation $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$.\n$\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right) \\approx \\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 u^2}{a^2}$\n\nNow our probability integral becomes much simpler:\n$Prob \\approx \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{2}{a} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi^2 u^2}{a^2}\\right) du = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} u^2 du$\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\n1.  Solve the definite integral:\n    $\\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} u^2 du = \\left[ \\frac{u^3}{3} \\right]_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} = \\frac{(0.005a)^3 - (-0.005a)^3}{3} = \\frac{2 \\times (0.005a)^3}{3}$\n\n2.  Substitute this back into the probability expression:\n    $Prob \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\times \\frac{2 \\times (0.005a)^3}{3} = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\times (0.005)^3 a^3$\n\n3.  The $a^3$ terms cancel out:\n    $Prob \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} \\times (0.005)^3$\n\n4.  Calculate the numerical value:\n    $(0.005)^3 = (5 \\times 10^{-3})^3 = 125 \\times 10^{-9} = 1.25 \\times 10^{-7}$\n    $Prob \\approx \\frac{16 \\times \\pi^2}{3} \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\n    Using $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, so $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.8696$:\n    $Prob \\approx \\frac{16 \\times 9.8696}{3} \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\n    $Prob \\approx 52.638 \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\n    $Prob \\approx 65.7975 \\times 10^{-7}$\n    $Prob \\approx 6.58 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n=2 is approximately $6.58 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
