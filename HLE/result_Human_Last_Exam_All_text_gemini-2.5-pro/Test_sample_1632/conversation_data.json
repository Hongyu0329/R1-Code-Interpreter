    "This problem asks for the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice (a 2D square grid). Let's break down the problem and the method to solve it.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Understanding the Definitions**\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** This is a 2D grid of points with integer coordinates (x, y).\n*   **Walk:** A sequence of connected points on the lattice, starting from an origin, say (0,0). Each step moves from the current point to one of its four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, or right).\n*   **n-step Walk:** A walk consisting of `n` steps (or edges) and `n+1` points (vertices).\n*   **Self-avoiding Walk (SAW):** A walk that never visits the same point more than once. All `n+1` vertices in the sequence must be unique.\n*   **a(n):** The function representing the number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks starting from a fixed origin.\n\n**2. Calculating for Small `n`**\nLet's calculate the first few terms of the sequence `a(n)` to understand the process and its complexity. We assume the walk starts at (0,0).\n\n*   **a(1):** From (0,0), we can move to (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), or (0,-1). All 4 are valid 1-step SAWs.\n    *   `a(1) = 4`\n\n*   **a(2):** We extend each of the 4 1-step walks. For any 1-step walk, the endpoint has 4 neighbors. One of them is the origin, which we cannot return to. So, there are 3 valid moves for the second step.\n    *   For example, from (1,0), we can move to (2,0), (1,1), or (1,-1).\n    *   Total walks = (choices for step 1) × (choices for step 2) = 4 × 3 = 12.\n    *   `a(2) = 12`\n\n*   **a(3):** We extend the 12 2-step walks. The number of choices for the third step depends on the shape of the 2-step walk.\n    *   **Case 1: Straight walks.** There are 4 straight walks (e.g., (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0)). From the endpoint (2,0), the neighbors are (1,0), (3,0), (2,1), (2,-1). The point (1,0) is already on the path, so we can't go there. This leaves 3 valid moves. Contribution: 4 walks × 3 moves/walk = 12 new walks.\n    *   **Case 2: Bent walks.** There are 8 bent walks (e.g., (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1)). From the endpoint (1,1), the neighbors are (1,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,1). The point (1,0) is on the path, so we can't go there. This leaves 3 valid moves. Contribution: 8 walks × 3 moves/walk = 24 new walks.\n    *   Total walks = 12 + 24 = 36.\n    *   `a(3) = 36`\n\n*   **a(4):** We extend the 36 3-step walks. The logic becomes more complex because a walk can now form a shape that blocks off more than one of its next potential moves.\n    *   For example, consider the walk (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (0,1). The endpoint is (0,1). Its neighbors are (0,0), (1,1), (0,2), and (-1,1). Two of these neighbors, (0,0) and (1,1), are already part of the walk. This leaves only 2 valid moves for the next step.\n    *   A full enumeration shows that `a(4) = 100`.\n\n**3. The Challenge for `n=10`**\nAs `n` increases, the number of possible walk shapes grows extremely rapidly. Manually tracking all possible paths, their endpoints, and their visited points becomes infeasible. This is a classic problem in computational physics and combinatorics for which no simple closed-form formula for `a(n)` is known. The values are found using powerful computer algorithms that perform an **exact enumeration**.\n\n**4. Using Known Results**\nThe sequence for the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice is well-documented. It is listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411. We can use this reliable source for the value of `a(10)`.\n\nThe sequence begins (starting with `a(0)=1` for a 0-step walk):\n*   a(0) = 1\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2172\n*   a(8) = 5916\n*   a(9) = 16268\n*   **a(10) = 44100**\n\n### Careful Points\n*   The term \"Manhattan lattice\" is a synonym for the 2D square lattice.\n*   The problem assumes a fixed starting point.\n*   Direct calculation is only feasible for very small `n`.\n*   The number of choices for the next step depends on the entire history of the walk, not just the last point.\n*   For a computationally intensive problem like this, whose answer is a known integer sequence, referring to established mathematical resources (like OEIS) is the standard and most reliable method.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nFollowing the established sequence `a(n)` for self-avoiding walks on a square lattice, the value for `n=10` is obtained from the results of computer-based exact enumeration.\n\nThe number of 10-step self-avoiding walks, `a(10)`, is 44100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
