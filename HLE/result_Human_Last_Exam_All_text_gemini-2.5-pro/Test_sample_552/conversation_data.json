    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks to identify the person whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his specific 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\n2.  **Identify the Specific Paper:** The paper in question is one of Einstein's four *Annus Mirabilis* (Miracle Year) papers from 1905. Its title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Term \"Cite\":** In modern science, \"to cite\" means including a formal reference in a bibliography or footnote. However, scientific writing conventions were different in 1905, and Einstein's papers from this era are famously sparse in their citations to the work of others. The question could mean a formal citation or a clear intellectual reference within the text.\n\n4.  **Examine the Paper for Formal Citations:** A careful review of Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion reveals that there are **no formal citations or footnotes** referencing any other scientist's work. He builds his argument from what he presents as first principles. Therefore, if we take \"cite\" in the strictest modern sense, the answer would be \"no one.\"\n\n5.  **Examine the Paper for Intellectual Foundation:** This is a more likely interpretation of the question. The paper's full title explicitly mentions its foundation: the **\"molecular-kinetic theory of heat.\"** This theory, which proposed that heat is a result of the motion of atoms and molecules, was most famously and rigorously developed by a specific physicist.\n\n6.  **Identify the Key Figure:** The primary architect of the molecular-kinetic theory of heat was the Austrian physicist **Ludwig Boltzmann**. His work was fundamental to the development of statistical mechanics.\n\n7.  **Connect to \"Lectures\":** Ludwig Boltzmann published a highly influential two-volume work titled **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\" (\"Lectures on Gas Theory\")** in 1896 and 1898. Einstein is known to have studied this work closely, and it formed the basis of his own series of papers on statistical mechanics from 1902-1904, which directly led to his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Although Einstein did not include a formal bibliographic citation to Boltzmann in the 1905 paper, the entire work is an application and extension of the principles laid out by Boltzmann in his \"Lectures on Gas Theory.\" The reference to the \"molecular-kinetic theory\" in the title is a direct, albeit implicit, citation of the body of work for which Boltzmann was best known. Historians of science universally agree that Einstein's paper is built upon Boltzmann's foundational ideas.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Literal vs. Intellectual Citation:** It's crucial to distinguish between a formal, modern-style citation and the acknowledgment of an intellectual foundation. Einstein's paper lacks the former but is entirely dependent on the latter.\n*   **Einstein's Isolation:** The myth that Einstein was completely isolated and unaware of contemporary physics is an exaggeration. While he did work independently, he was deeply engaged with the work of foundational figures like Maxwell, Lorentz, and, in this case, Boltzmann.\n*   **Specificity of \"Lectures\":** The question's use of the word \"lectures\" points specifically to Boltzmann's famous published work, \"Lectures on Gas Theory,\" which was the main vehicle for his ideas.\n\nBy following this analysis, we can confidently identify the person whose work was the foundation for Einstein's paper.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
