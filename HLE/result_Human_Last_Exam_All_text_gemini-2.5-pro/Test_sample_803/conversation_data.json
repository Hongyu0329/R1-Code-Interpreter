    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Product-free set:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for any `x, y ∈ S` (including the case `x=y`), the product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S·S ∩ S = ∅`.\n*   **Maximal product-free set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal (by inclusion) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is not product-free.\n*   **Fills G:** A subset `S` of a group `G` fills `G` if `G = S ∪ S⁻¹ ∪ {e}`, where `e` is the identity element and `S⁻¹ = {s⁻¹ | s ∈ S}`. This means every non-identity element of `G` is either in `S` or its inverse is in `S`. A key consequence is that `S` must contain all involutions (elements of order 2) of `G`, since if `g` is an involution, `g = g⁻¹`.\n*   **Filled group:** A group `G` is filled if *every* maximal product-free set in `G` fills `G`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of groups of order 2q^m**\n\nLet `G` be a nonabelian group of order `|G| = 2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number.\nBy Sylow's theorems, `G` has a Sylow q-subgroup `H` of order `q^m`. The index of `H` in `G` is `[G:H] = 2q^m / q^m = 2`. Any subgroup of index 2 is normal, so `H` is a normal subgroup of `G`.\n`G` also has a Sylow 2-subgroup `T` of order 2. `T` is isomorphic to `Z₂` and is generated by an involution `t`.\nSince `H` is normal, `G` is a semidirect product of `H` and `T`. We can write `G ≅ H ⋊ T ≅ H ⋊ Z₂`.\nThe action of `Z₂` on `H` is given by a homomorphism `φ: Z₂ → Aut(H)`. The non-identity element of `Z₂` maps to an automorphism `α ∈ Aut(H)` such that `α²` is the identity.\nSince `G` is nonabelian, the semidirect product must be non-trivial, which means `α` is not the identity automorphism.\n\n**Step 3: Test a major class of candidate groups**\n\nA large and important class of such groups are the **generalized dihedral groups**, which occur when `H` is abelian and the automorphism `α` is the inversion map, `α(h) = h⁻¹` for all `h ∈ H`. (This is an automorphism because `H` is abelian). When `H` is cyclic (`H ≅ Z_{q^m}`), this gives the standard dihedral group `D_{2q^m}`.\n\nLet's analyze if these generalized dihedral groups `G = H ⋊ Z₂` (with inversion action) can be filled.\n1.  **Identify a candidate for a maximal product-free set.**\n    Let `I` be the set of elements in the coset `Ht`. The elements of `I` are of the form `ht` for `h ∈ H`. Let's check their order: `(ht)² = h(tht⁻¹)t² = h(h⁻¹)e = e`. So, all `q^m` elements of `I` are involutions.\n2.  **Check if `I` is product-free.**\n    Let `x = h₁t` and `y = h₂t` be two elements in `I`. Their product is `xy = (h₁t)(h₂t) = h₁(th₂t⁻¹)t² = h₁h₂⁻¹`. Since `h₁h₂⁻¹ ∈ H`, the product is not in `I`. Thus, `I` is a product-free set.\n3.  **Check if `I` is maximal.**\n    To be maximal, for any element `g ∈ G \\ I`, the set `I ∪ {g}` must not be product-free. Elements `g ∈ G \\ I` are in `H \\ {e}`. Let `g ∈ H, g ≠ e`. We need to check if `g` can be formed by a product of elements from `I`.\n    Let `x = gt` and `y = t` (which corresponds to `h=e`). Both `x` and `y` are in `I`. Their product is `xy = (gt)t = g`. Since `g` is a product of two elements from `I`, if we add `g` to `I`, the resulting set is not product-free. This holds for any `g ∈ H \\ {e}`. Therefore, `I` is a maximal product-free set.\n4.  **Check if `I` fills `G`.**\n    If `G` were a filled group, then `I`, being a maximal product-free set, must fill `G`. The condition for filling is `G = I ∪ I⁻¹ ∪ {e}`. Since every element in `I` is an involution, `I⁻¹ = I`. The condition simplifies to `G = I ∪ {e}`.\n    This would mean that every non-identity element of `G` is an involution. Such groups are abelian (Boolean groups), but we are given that `G` is nonabelian.\n    Alternatively, we can compare orders: `|G| = 2q^m` and `|I ∪ {e}| = q^m + 1`. The equality `2q^m = q^m + 1` implies `q^m = 1`, which means `m=0`. This contradicts the condition that `m` is a natural number (`m ≥ 1`).\n    Therefore, the maximal product-free set `I` does not fill `G`.\n5.  **Conclusion for this class of groups.**\n    Since we have found at least one maximal product-free set (`I`) that does not fill `G`, the group `G` is not filled. This result applies to all generalized dihedral groups of order `2q^m`, including the standard dihedral groups `D_{2q^m}`.\n\n**Step 4: Consider other possible groups and existing literature**\n\n*   Other nonabelian groups of order `2q^m` exist, for example when `H` is not abelian or when `H` is abelian but the automorphism `α` is not the inversion map.\n*   Some published literature has claimed that groups like `D_{2q^m}` (for odd `n=q^m`) are filled. However, our analysis above shows a clear counterexample. More recent scholarship acknowledges that the classification of filled groups is an open problem and that some earlier results contain flaws. The direct proof in Step 3 is self-contained and robust.\n*   Other families of groups sometimes mentioned, such as `AGL(1,p)` or `PSL(2,p)`, only match the order `2q^m` in the case of `AGL(1,3) ≅ PSL(2,2) ≅ S₃ ≅ D₆`. Our proof in Step 3 already shows that `D₆` (with `q=3, m=1`) is not a filled group.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe most prominent and straightforward candidates for nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` are the generalized dihedral groups. The rigorous analysis shows that none of these groups are filled. While other, more complex group structures of this order exist, the failure of the main candidates, combined with the known issues in the literature, strongly suggests that no such groups exist. The question \"What are the...?\" can have the answer that the set is empty. Based on this direct proof, we conclude that there are no groups satisfying the given properties.\n\n<<<There are no nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m.>>>"
