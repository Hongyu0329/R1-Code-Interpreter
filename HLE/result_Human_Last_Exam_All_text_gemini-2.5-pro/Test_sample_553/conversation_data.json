    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Terminology in the Question\n\nFirst, we need to understand what the question is asking for in musical terms.\n*   **\"Tonic chord\"**: This is the \"home\" chord, or the first chord (I or i), of the song's key. For example, in the key of C Major, the tonic is a C Major chord. In the key of A minor, the tonic is an A minor chord.\n*   **\"Minor fifth chord\"**: This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale, but played as a minor chord (notated as 'v').\n*   **\"Chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord\"**: This describes a direct chord change from the tonic to the minor fifth chord, right at the beginning of the song.\n\nLet's consider the two most likely scenarios for this progression:\n1.  **In a minor key**: The key is minor, so the tonic is a minor chord (i). The fifth note of the natural minor scale produces a minor chord (v) naturally. For example, in the key of A minor, the tonic (i) is A minor, and the minor fifth (v) is E minor. The progression would be **i -> v**.\n2.  **In a major key**: The key is major, so the tonic is a major chord (I). The diatonic fifth chord is also major (V). To get a minor fifth chord (v), it would have to be \"borrowed,\" usually from the parallel minor key. For example, in C Major, the progression would be C Major (I) to G minor (v). This is called modal interchange.\n\nThe i -> v progression in a minor key is a more common and natural-sounding choice for a song's opening, so we will focus our search there first.\n\n### Step 2: Search for Candidate Songs in The Beatles' Discography\n\nWe will now go through The Beatles' songs, focusing on their introductions, to find this specific i -> v progression.\n\n*   **\"A Hard Day's Night\"**: Starts with a famous, complex chord, not a simple tonic.\n*   **\"Help!\"**: Starts on a Bm chord, which is the ii chord in the song's key of A Major. It does not start on the tonic.\n*   **\"I Feel Fine\"**: The song is in G Major. The opening riff is based on the I-IV-V progression (G-C-D). The fifth chord is major.\n*   **\"Things We Said Today\"**: This song is a strong candidate. The verses and intro are in the key of A minor. The song begins with a stark, rhythmic strumming of an **A minor** chord (the tonic, i) followed immediately by an **E minor** chord (the minor fifth, v). The progression is Am -> Em, which is exactly i -> v.\n*   **\"Michelle\"**: This is another very strong candidate. The verses and the famous instrumental intro are in the key of F minor. The intro begins with a melodic guitar line played over an **F minor** chord (the tonic, i). The harmony then moves directly to a **C minor** chord (the minor fifth, v). The progression is Fm -> Cm, which is also i -> v.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidates and Select the Best Answer\n\nBoth \"Things We Said Today\" and \"Michelle\" correctly feature a jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord at the start.\n\n*   In **\"Things We Said Today\"**, the progression is a direct, percussive statement (Am -> Em) that forms the rhythmic and harmonic basis of the intro.\n*   In **\"Michelle\"**, the progression (Fm -> Cm) is the foundation for one of the most iconic and melodic instrumental introductions in the entire Beatles catalog. The song's sophisticated, French-influenced harmony is one of its defining features, and this gentle i -> v opening is a key part of its unique character.\n\nWhile both songs are technically correct, \"Michelle\" is arguably the more famous and celebrated example of this harmonic device. The song won a Grammy for Song of the Year, and its intro is instantly recognizable. The use of the minor fifth chord is central to the wistful, romantic mood of the piece.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"Michelle\". The song is in F minor, and the opening instrumental features a progression from the tonic F minor (i) to the minor fifth C minor (v).\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
