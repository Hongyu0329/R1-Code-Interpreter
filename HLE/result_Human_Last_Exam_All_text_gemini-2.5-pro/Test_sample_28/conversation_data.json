    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of the given hypothesis class.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Hypothesis Class\nThe hypothesis class is defined as $H_{z-ones} = \\{h: X \\to \\{0,1\\} : |\\{x: h(x)=1\\}| = z\\}$.\n*   The domain is $X$, and its size is $|X|=T$.\n*   $z$ is a positive integer.\n*   Each hypothesis (or classifier) $h$ in this class must assign the label '1' to exactly $z$ points in the domain $X$. All other $T-z$ points are assigned the label '0'.\n*   A specific hypothesis is defined by choosing which $z$ points out of the $T$ points in the domain are labeled '1'. The total number of hypotheses in this class is $\\binom{T}{z}$.\n\n### Step 2: Understanding VC Dimension and Shattering\nThe VC dimension of a hypothesis class $H$ is the size of the largest set of points $S \\subseteq X$ that can be **shattered** by $H$.\nA set $S = \\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_m\\}$ of size $m$ is shattered by $H$ if for every possible binary labeling of the points in $S$, there exists a hypothesis $h \\in H$ that produces that labeling. Since there are $m$ points, there are $2^m$ possible labelings.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Condition for a Labeling to be Realizable\nLet's consider a set $S \\subseteq X$ of size $m$, i.e., $|S|=m$.\nConsider an arbitrary labeling for the points in $S$. Let's say this labeling assigns '1' to $k$ points in $S$ and '0' to the other $m-k$ points. Here, $k$ can be any integer from $0$ to $m$.\n\nFor this specific labeling to be realized by a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The hypothesis $h$ must match the labeling on $S$. This means it must label the $k$ chosen points in $S$ as '1' and the other $m-k$ points as '0'.\n2.  The hypothesis $h$ must belong to $H_{z-ones}$, which means the total number of points in the entire domain $X$ that $h$ labels as '1' must be exactly $z$.\n\nFrom these two conditions, we know that $h$ must label $k$ points inside $S$ as '1'. To reach the required total of $z$ points labeled '1', $h$ must label an additional $z-k$ points as '1'. These additional points must be chosen from outside of $S$, i.e., from the set $X \\setminus S$.\n\nThe size of this outside set is $|X \\setminus S| = |X| - |S| = T-m$.\n\nSo, we must be able to choose $z-k$ points from the $T-m$ available points in $X \\setminus S$. This is possible if and only if the number of points to choose is non-negative and does not exceed the number of available points. This gives us two inequalities:\n1.  $z-k \\ge 0 \\implies k \\le z$\n2.  $z-k \\le T-m \\implies m+z-T \\le k$\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Condition for a Set to be Shattered\nFor the set $S$ of size $m$ to be shattered, it must be possible to realize *every* possible labeling of $S$. This means the two inequalities derived above must hold for *all* possible values of $k$, where $k$ is the number of '1's in the labeling. For a set of size $m$, $k$ can range from $0, 1, \\ldots, m$.\n\nLet's check the conditions for the entire range of $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, m\\}$:\n1.  The condition $k \\le z$ must hold for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, m\\}$. This is true if and only if the largest possible value of $k$, which is $m$, satisfies the inequality. So, we must have **$m \\le z$**.\n2.  The condition $m+z-T \\le k$ must hold for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, m\\}$. This is true if and only if the smallest possible value of $k$, which is $0$, satisfies the inequality. So, we must have $m+z-T \\le 0$, which simplifies to **$m \\le T-z$**.\n\nFor a set of size $m$ to be shattered, both conditions must hold. Therefore, $m$ must satisfy $m \\le z$ and $m \\le T-z$. This implies that any shatterable set must have a size $m$ such that $m \\le \\min(z, T-z)$.\nThis gives us an **upper bound** on the VC dimension: $VC(H_{z-ones}) \\le \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n### Step 5: Proving the Bound is Achievable (Lower Bound)\nNow we need to show that we can actually shatter a set of size $m = \\min(z, T-z)$. Let's pick an arbitrary set $S$ with $|S|=m = \\min(z, T-z)$.\nWe need to show that for any labeling of $S$, we can find a suitable hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$.\nLet a labeling have $k$ ones, where $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, m\\}$. We need to check if we can form a valid hypothesis, which requires being able to choose $z-k$ points from the $T-m$ points in $X \\setminus S$. We must verify if $0 \\le z-k \\le T-m$ holds for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, m\\}$.\n\n1.  **Check $k \\le z$**: We know $k \\le m$. By our choice of $m$, we have $m = \\min(z, T-z) \\le z$. Therefore, $k \\le m \\le z$, which means $k \\le z$ is always true.\n2.  **Check $z-k \\le T-m$**: This is equivalent to $m \\le T-z+k$. The \"worst case\" (the hardest to satisfy) is when $k$ is minimal, i.e., $k=0$. The condition becomes $m \\le T-z$. By our choice of $m$, we have $m = \\min(z, T-z) \\le T-z$. So, this condition is also always true.\n\nSince for any $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, m\\}$, the condition $0 \\le z-k \\le T-m$ is satisfied, we can always find a hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$ for any labeling of $S$. Therefore, any set of size $m = \\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered.\nThis gives us a **lower bound** on the VC dimension: $VC(H_{z-ones}) \\ge \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\nWe have shown that:\n*   $VC(H_{z-ones}) \\le \\min(z, T-z)$\n*   $VC(H_{z-ones}) \\ge \\min(z, T-z)$\n\nCombining these two results, the VC dimension must be exactly $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\nA careful point to consider is the case where $z$ or $T-z$ might be 0. The problem states $z$ is a positive integer.\n*   If $z=T$, then $H_{z-ones}$ contains only one function (all 1s). The VC dimension is 0. Our formula gives $\\min(T, T-T) = \\min(T, 0) = 0$. This is correct.\n*   If $z=0$ (hypothetically, as $z$ is positive), $H_{z-ones}$ contains one function (all 0s). VC-dim is 0. Our formula gives $\\min(0, T-0)=0$. This is also correct.\n\nThe analysis holds for all valid values of $z$ and $T$.\n\nFinal Answer: The VC dimension of the class $H_{z-ones}$ is the minimum of the number of points labeled '1' and the number of points labeled '0'.\n\n<<<min(z, T-z)>>>"
