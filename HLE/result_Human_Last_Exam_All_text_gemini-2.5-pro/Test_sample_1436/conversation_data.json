    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Components of the Diagram\n\n*   **Theory**: The question implies a theory with an interaction vertex where at least four fields meet. The most common example is the $\\phi^4$ theory, with an interaction term like $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{4!} \\phi^4$. Each vertex in this theory has four field lines emerging from it.\n*   **Vertices**: The diagram has two distinct vertices, let's call them $v_1$ and $v_2$. In the perturbative expansion, this diagram would arise from the second-order term, proportional to $\\lambda^2$.\n*   **Field Contractions (Propagators)**: A \"field contraction\" corresponds to a propagator, which is represented by a line in the Feynman diagram. There are four such contractions. Each vertex has 4 field \"legs\". With two vertices, we have a total of $2 \\times 4 = 8$ legs. Since each propagator connects two legs, the four propagators use up all $4 \\times 2 = 8$ legs.\n*   **Diagram Topology**: Since all 8 legs are used internally by the four propagators, the diagram has no external lines. It is a vacuum diagram (or vacuum bubble). The only way to connect two vertices using four separate lines is for all four lines to start at vertex $v_1$ and end at vertex $v_2$. This topology is sometimes called a \"melon\" diagram.\n\n### Step 2: Defining the Symmetry Factor (S)\n\nThe symmetry factor `S` of a Feynman diagram is a combinatorial number that corrects for the overcounting of physically identical configurations when performing Wick contractions. It is defined as the number of permutations of the diagram's internal lines and vertices that leave the diagram topologically unchanged.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Symmetry Factor by Identifying Symmetries\n\nWe calculate `S` by considering all possible symmetry operations on the diagram.\n\n1.  **Symmetry from Permuting Propagators**:\n    *   The diagram consists of two vertices connected by four identical propagators.\n    *   These four propagators are indistinguishable from each other. We can swap any of them with any other, and the diagram's structure remains exactly the same.\n    *   The number of ways to permute these four identical lines is $4!$ (4 factorial).\n    *   $4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$.\n    *   This gives a symmetry factor of **24**.\n\n2.  **Symmetry from Permuting Vertices**:\n    *   The diagram has two vertices, $v_1$ and $v_2$.\n    *   These vertices are connected in a perfectly symmetric manner (four lines connect $v_1$ to $v_2$).\n    *   Therefore, we can swap the positions (or labels) of $v_1$ and $v_2$, and the resulting diagram is topologically identical to the original one.\n    *   The number of ways to permute these two identical vertices is $2!$.\n    *   $2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n    *   This gives a symmetry factor of **2**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Total Symmetry Factor\n\nThe total symmetry factor `S` is the product of the factors from all independent symmetry operations.\n\n*   $S = (\\text{Number of propagator permutations}) \\times (\\text{Number of vertex permutations})$\n*   $S = 4! \\times 2!$\n*   $S = 24 \\times 2$\n*   $S = 48$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Identical Lines**: The calculation assumes the four propagators are of the same type (i.e., they correspond to the same field). If the propagators were different, this symmetry would be broken.\n*   **Identical Vertices**: The ability to swap vertices depends on them being of the same type and being connected identically. In this case, both conditions are met.\n*   **Propagator Direction**: For a real scalar field, propagators are undirected ($D(x-y) = D(y-x)$). If the theory involved complex or fermionic fields, the propagators would be directed, and swapping the vertices would not be a symmetry unless we also reversed the direction of all four propagators. For the standard problem setup, we assume undirected lines.\n*   **Relation to Perturbative Expansion**: This result can be confirmed by explicitly writing down the perturbative series term. The diagram's contribution comes from the term $\\frac{1}{2!} (\\frac{-i\\lambda}{4!})^2 \\int d^4x_1 d^4x_2 \\langle T\\{\\phi(x_1)^4\\phi(x_2)^4\\} \\rangle$. The number of Wick contractions that produce this specific topology is $4! = 24$. The total numerical coefficient is $\\frac{1}{2!} \\frac{1}{(4!)^2} \\times 24 = \\frac{24}{2 \\times (24)^2} = \\frac{1}{48}$. Since this coefficient is defined as $1/S$, we confirm that $S=48$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the symmetry factor is the product of the permutations of the four identical propagators ($4!$) and the permutations of the two identical vertices ($2!$).\n\n$S = 4! \\times 2! = 24 \\times 2 = 48$.\n\n<<<48>>>"
