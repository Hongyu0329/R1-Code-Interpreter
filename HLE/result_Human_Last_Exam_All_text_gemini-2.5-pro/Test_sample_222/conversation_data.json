    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the given sequence.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Problem and Define the Sequence**\n\nWe are given the 4-point DFTs of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   `X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n\nWe need to find the DFT of a new 8-point sequence, `y(n)`, which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   The sequence `y(n)` is: `{x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n\nA careful point to note is that the question asks for the \"4-point DFT\" of an 8-point sequence. This is very likely a typo and should be interpreted as finding the **8-point DFT**, as this is the standard problem formulation for building a larger DFT from smaller ones. We will proceed with finding the 8-point DFT, `Y(k)`.\n\n### **Step 2: Relate the New Sequence to the Original Sequences**\n\nLet's express the new sequence `y(n)` in terms of `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   The even-indexed terms of `y(n)` are from `x(n)`: `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   The odd-indexed terms of `y(n)` are from `h(n)`: `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n### **Step 3: Apply the Decimation-In-Time (DIT) FFT Principle**\n\nThe 8-point DFT of `y(n)` is defined as:\n`Y(k) = Σ_{n=0 to 7} y(n) * W_8^(nk)`, where `W_N = e^(-j*2π/N)`.\n\nWe can split this summation into even and odd parts:\n`Y(k) = Σ_{m=0 to 3} y(2m) * W_8^(2mk) + Σ_{m=0 to 3} y(2m+1) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n\nSubstitute `y(2m) = x(m)` and `y(2m+1) = h(m)`:\n`Y(k) = Σ_{m=0 to 3} x(m) * (W_8^2)^(mk) + W_8^k * Σ_{m=0 to 3} h(m) * (W_8^2)^(mk)`\n\nA key property is that `W_8^2 = e^(-j*2π*2/8) = e^(-j*2π/4) = W_4`. The summations are the 4-point DFTs of `x(m)` and `h(m)`:\n`Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`\n\nThis gives us the \"butterfly\" computation formulas:\n1.  For `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`: `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n2.  For `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`: `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` (because `W_8^(k+4) = W_8^k * W_8^4 = W_8^k * (-1)`)\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate Necessary Twiddle Factors**\n\nWe need the twiddle factors `W_8^k` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   `W_8^0 = e^0 = 1`\n*   `W_8^1 = e^(-jπ/4) = cos(π/4) - j*sin(π/4) = (1 - j)/√2`\n*   `W_8^2 = e^(-jπ/2) = -j`\n*   `W_8^3 = e^(-j3π/4) = cos(3π/4) - j*sin(3π/4) = (-1 - j)/√2`\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the product `W_8^k * H(k)`**\n\nLet's compute the product term for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   **k=0:** `W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 * 0 = 0`\n*   **k=1:** `W_8^1 * H(1) = [(1 - j)/√2] * (1 + j) = (1 - j^2)/√2 = (1 + 1)/√2 = 2/√2 = √2`\n*   **k=2:** `W_8^2 * H(2) = (-j) * 1 = -j`\n*   **k=3:** `W_8^3 * H(3) = [(-1 - j)/√2] * (1 - j) = (-1 + j - j + j^2)/√2 = (-1 - 1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2`\n\nLet's call this product `P(k) = [0, √2, -j, -√2]`.\n\n### **Step 6: Calculate the first half of Y(k)**\n\nUsing the formula `Y(k) = X(k) + P(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`:\n*   `Y(0) = X(0) + P(0) = 1 + 0 = 1`\n*   `Y(1) = X(1) + P(1) = j + √2`\n*   `Y(2) = X(2) + P(2) = -1 + (-j) = -1 - j`\n*   `Y(3) = X(3) + P(3) = -j + (-√2) = -√2 - j`\n\n### **Step 7: Calculate the second half of Y(k)**\n\nUsing the formula `Y(k+4) = X(k) - P(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`:\n*   `Y(4) = X(0) - P(0) = 1 - 0 = 1`\n*   `Y(5) = X(1) - P(1) = j - √2 = -√2 + j`\n*   `Y(6) = X(2) - P(2) = -1 - (-j) = -1 + j`\n*   `Y(7) = X(3) - P(3) = -j - (-√2) = √2 - j`\n\n### **Step 8: Final Answer**\n\nCombining the results, the 8-point DFT of the interleaved sequence is:\n`Y(k) = [Y(0), Y(1), Y(2), Y(3), Y(4), Y(5), Y(6), Y(7)]`\n\n`Y(k) = [1, √2 + j, -1 - j, -√2 - j, 1, -√2 + j, -1 + j, √2 - j]`\n\n<<<[1, 1.414+j, -1-j, -1.414-j, 1, -1.414+j, -1+j, 1.414-j]>>>"
