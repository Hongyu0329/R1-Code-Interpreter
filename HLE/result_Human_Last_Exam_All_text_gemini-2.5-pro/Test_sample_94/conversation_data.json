    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the name of a specific physicist. We are given several key pieces of information to identify them:\n    *   They are a physicist.\n    *   They are \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\"\n    *   They discovered an \"optical effect in real imagery.\"\n    *   The discovery was inspired by an accidental observation made by a \"custodial worker.\"\n    *   The observation involved \"cleaning concave mirrors.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **\"Physicist better known for work in the microscopy field\":** This narrows the search to prominent figures in the history of microscopy, particularly those from a physics background. Candidates might include Ernst Abbe, August Köhler, or Frits Zernike, who made fundamental contributions to optical theory and microscope design.\n    *   **\"Discovered an optical effect in real imagery\":** This points to a fundamental discovery in optics, not just an engineering improvement. A real image is formed where light rays converge, which is characteristic of concave mirrors and converging lenses.\n    *   **\"Accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors\":** This is the most specific and unique clue. It describes the origin story of the discovery. We need to find a physicist whose work is linked to this specific anecdote.\n\n3.  **Connecting the Clues:**\n    *   Let's focus on the anecdote. The story goes that a janitor was cleaning a large concave mirror (part of a telescope or spectrometer) and noticed that he could see the shimmering, normally invisible heat waves (air currents) rising from his hand.\n    *   These air currents are a classic example of a \"phase object.\" They don't absorb or scatter light significantly, but they do have a different refractive index from the surrounding air, which shifts the phase of the light passing through them.\n    *   Normally, the human eye cannot detect these phase shifts. However, in this case, a slight defect or defocus in the mirror converted these invisible phase differences into visible intensity differences.\n    *   The physicist who heard this story (or made a similar observation) and realized its profound implications was **Frits Zernike**.\n    *   This observation led him to develop a controlled method to achieve this effect. He invented the phase-contrast microscope by creating a \"phase plate\" that systematically shifts the phase of certain parts of the light, making transparent specimens (like living cells, which are phase objects) visible without the need for staining.\n\n4.  **Verification:**\n    *   **Is Frits Zernike known for microscopy?** Yes, he won the 1953 Nobel Prize in Physics for his invention of the phase-contrast microscope.\n    *   **Did he discover an optical effect?** Yes, the principle of phase contrast is a fundamental optical effect he was the first to describe and harness.\n    *   **Does the story match?** Yes, the story of the janitor and the concave mirror is widely associated with Zernike's moment of insight that led to his Nobel-winning invention.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Anecdote vs. Fact:** While the story about the custodial worker is a popular and illustrative anecdote, its historical accuracy is sometimes debated. However, it correctly points to the specific physicist and the nature of their discovery. The core of the story—the visualization of phase objects by an imperfect optical system—is the correct scientific starting point for Zernike's work.\n*   **\"Microscopy\" vs. \"Optics\":** The question correctly states he is \"better known\" for microscopy. His discovery was a fundamental principle in optics, but its most famous and impactful application was in the field of microscopy.\n*   **\"Concave Mirror\":** This detail is crucial. A concave mirror's ability to form real images is central to the phenomenon observed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy combining the clues—a physicist famous for microscopy, the discovery of an optical effect, and the specific anecdote of a janitor cleaning a concave mirror—we can uniquely identify the individual as Frits Zernike.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
