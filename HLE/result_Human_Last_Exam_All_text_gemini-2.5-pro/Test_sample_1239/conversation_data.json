    "An analysis of the symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations involves finding the Lie group of transformations that map solutions to other solutions. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of this group.\n\n**Step 1: The Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations**\n\nThe equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ for the velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$ are:\n1.  $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$ (Momentum Equation)\n2.  $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$ (Incompressibility Condition)\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity. We are looking for the dimension of the Lie algebra of infinitesimal generators that leave this system of partial differential equations invariant.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of Symmetries**\n\nWe systematically check for different types of symmetries.\n\n*   **Time Translation:** The equations do not explicitly depend on time $t$ (they are autonomous). Therefore, they are invariant under time translations $t \\to t + s$. This gives one generator:\n    *   $X_t = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$\n    *   Dimension: 1\n\n*   **Space Translations:** The equations are set in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and have constant coefficients, so they are invariant under spatial translations $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$ for any constant vector $\\mathbf{a} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. This gives three independent generators:\n    *   $X_{x_i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$.\n    *   Dimension: 3\n\n*   **Spatial Rotations:** The differential operators ($\\nabla$, $\\nabla^2$) and the structure of the vector equations are isotropic (invariant under rotations). A rotation $\\mathbf{x} \\to R\\mathbf{x}$ (where $R \\in SO(3)$) combined with the corresponding transformation of the vector field $\\mathbf{u} \\to R\\mathbf{u}$ leaves the equations invariant. The group of rotations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, $SO(3)$, is 3-dimensional. This gives three generators (for rotations about the coordinate axes):\n    *   $J_i = \\epsilon_{ijk} (x_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k} + u_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_k})$ (summation implied).\n    *   Dimension: 3\n\n*   **Galilean Boosts:** The equations are invariant under a change of inertial reference frame (Galilean relativity). This corresponds to the transformation $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}_0 t$ and $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}_0$ for any constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. Direct substitution confirms that the equations remain unchanged. This gives three more generators:\n    *   $G_i = t \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$.\n    *   Dimension: 3\n\n*   **Scaling (Dilation) Symmetry:** We look for a scaling transformation of the form $t \\to \\lambda^a t$, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\lambda^b \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\lambda^c \\mathbf{u}$, $p \\to \\lambda^d p$. For the momentum equation to be invariant, all its terms must scale by the same factor. This leads to the following relations between the exponents:\n    $c-a = 2c-b = d-b = c-2b$.\n    Solving this system gives the unique solution (up to a single parameter) $a=2b$, $c=-b$, and $d=-2b$. We can set $b=1$, which gives $(a,b,c,d) = (2, 1, -1, -2)$. This corresponds to the transformation:\n    $t' = \\lambda^2 t, \\quad \\mathbf{x}' = \\lambda \\mathbf{x}, \\quad \\mathbf{u}' = \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}, \\quad p' = \\lambda^{-2} p$.\n    This single scaling group provides one generator:\n    *   $D = 2t \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + x_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} - u_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i} - 2p \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$ (summation implied).\n    *   Dimension: 1\n\n**Step 3: Total Dimension of the Finite-Dimensional Subgroup**\n\nSumming the dimensions from the identified symmetries:\nDimension = (Time Translation) + (Space Translations) + (Rotations) + (Galilean Boosts) + (Scaling)\nDimension = 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11.\n\n**Careful Point: Infinite-Dimensional Symmetries**\n\nIt is a known result from the full Lie symmetry analysis that the Navier-Stokes equations also admit an infinite-dimensional group of symmetries. This arises because the pressure $p$ is only determined up to a gradient, allowing transformations of the form $p \\to p + f(t)$. More generally, transformations to arbitrarily accelerating reference frames of the form $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{g}(t)$ (with a corresponding change in pressure) are also symmetries. These are often considered \"trivial\" or \"gauge-like\" symmetries. When a question asks for \"the dimension\" of the symmetry group, it conventionally refers to the dimension of the maximal *finite-dimensional* subalgebra of \"essential\" physical symmetries, which has been calculated above.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe maximal finite-dimensional Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is generated by time and space translations, spatial rotations, Galilean boosts, and a single scaling transformation. The dimension of this group is the sum of the number of independent generators for each transformation type.\n\nTotal Dimension = 1 (time translation) + 3 (space translations) + 3 (rotations) + 3 (Galilean boosts) + 1 (scaling) = 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
