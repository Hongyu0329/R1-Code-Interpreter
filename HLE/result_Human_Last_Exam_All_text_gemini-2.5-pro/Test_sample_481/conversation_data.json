    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the specific products:** The query is about two distinct medications:\n    *   Product 1: Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules.\n    *   Product 2: Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules.\n\n2.  **Find the imprint for the first product:** I will look up the standard imprint code for Teva's 10mg fluoxetine capsule using reliable pharmaceutical databases. The imprint on this capsule is **TEVA 3105**.\n\n3.  **Find the imprint for the second product:** Similarly, I will look up the standard imprint code for Teva's 20mg fluoxetine capsule. The imprint on this capsule is **TEVA 3106**.\n\n4.  **Isolate the numerical components:** The question asks for the \"different numbers\" imprinted on the capsules.\n    *   From the \"TEVA 3105\" imprint, the number is **3105**.\n    *   From the \"TEVA 3106\" imprint, the number is **3106**.\n\n5.  **Compare the numbers:** The two numbers identified, 3105 and 3106, are the numerical codes that differentiate the two capsules from each other.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   **Brand Specificity:** It is crucial to look up the specific manufacturer, \"Teva\", as different generic manufacturers use different imprint codes for the same drug and dosage.\n*   **Exclusion Criteria:** The analysis must strictly adhere to the negative constraints provided: do not mention color differences, the word \"PLIVA\" (another imprint sometimes associated with Teva products), or size differences.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Different Numbers\":** The question asks for the \"different numbers\", which refers to the complete numerical identifiers on each capsule (3105 and 3106), not just the single digit that is different between them (5 and 6).\n\nBy following these steps, we have identified the two distinct numbers used to mark the specified capsules.\n\n<<<3105 and 3106>>>"
