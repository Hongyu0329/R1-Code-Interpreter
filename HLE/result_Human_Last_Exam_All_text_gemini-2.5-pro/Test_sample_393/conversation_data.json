    "This question asks for the number of Tverberg partitions of a specially constructed set of points `X`. The key to solving this problem lies in carefully interpreting the given conditions, which effectively transform a complex geometric problem into a standard combinatorial counting problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given a set `X` of `n` points in `\\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\)`.\n    *   We are given a partition of the integer `n` into `r` parts: `n = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_r`, where `1 \\le a_i \\le d+1`.\n    *   A Tverberg partition of `X` is a partition of the set `X` into `r` non-empty subsets, `X_1, X_2, ..., X_r`, such that their convex hulls have a common intersection point: `conv(X_1) \\cap conv(X_2) \\cap ... \\cap conv(X_r) \\neq \\emptyset`.\n    *   The crucial condition is: **Every** Tverberg partition of this specific set `X` results in the same partition of the number `n`. This means for any Tverberg partition `{X_1, ..., X_r}` of `X`, the multiset of the sizes of the parts, `{|X_1|, |X_2|, ..., |X_r|}`, is identical to the multiset `{a_1, a_2, ..., a_r}`.\n\n2.  **Reframe the Problem as a Combinatorial Question:**\n    *   The problem statement guarantees the existence of a set `X` for which the set of all its Tverberg partitions is precisely the set of all partitions of `X` into subsets with sizes `a_1, a_2, ..., a_r`.\n    *   Therefore, we do not need to concern ourselves with the geometry of `X` or the Tverberg condition itself. The problem is reduced to answering the following combinatorial question: \"How many distinct ways are there to partition a set of `n` labeled elements (the points in `X`) into `r` unlabeled subsets, where the sizes of these subsets must be `a_1, a_2, ..., a_r`?\"\n\n3.  **Counting the Partitions (Step-by-step):**\n\n    *   **Part 1: Labeled Subsets (Multinomial Coefficient)**\n        First, let's imagine we are placing the `n` distinct points of `X` into `r` distinct (labeled) boxes, where Box 1 must contain `a_1` points, Box 2 must contain `a_2` points, and so on.\n        *   The number of ways to choose `a_1` points for Box 1 is `\\(\\binom{n}{a_1}\\)`.\n        *   The number of ways to choose `a_2` points for Box 2 from the remaining `n-a_1` points is `\\(\\binom{n-a_1}{a_2}\\)`.\n        *   Continuing this process, the total number of ways is the product:\n            `\\(\\binom{n}{a_1}\\binom{n-a_1}{a_2} \\cdots \\binom{a_r}{a_r} = \\frac{n!}{a_1!(n-a_1)!} \\frac{(n-a_1)!}{a_2!(n-a_1-a_2)!} \\cdots 1\\)`\n        *   This simplifies to the multinomial coefficient: `\\(\\frac{n!}{a_1! a_2! \\cdots a_r!}\\)`.\n\n    *   **Part 2: Unlabeled Subsets (Correcting for Overcounting)**\n        In a Tverberg partition `{X_1, ..., X_r}`, the subsets are not labeled or ordered. The partition `{{p1}, {p2, p3}}` is the same as `{{p2, p3}, {p1}}`. Our calculation in Part 1 assumed the subsets were labeled (Box 1, Box 2, etc.) and thus overcounted the number of partitions. We need to divide by the number of ways we can permute the labels of the boxes without changing the actual partition of points.\n        *   If all the sizes `a_1, a_2, ..., a_r` are distinct, we have overcounted by a factor of `r!`, since any of the `r!` permutations of the labeled boxes results in the same collection of subsets.\n        *   However, if some sizes are the same, the situation is more nuanced. For example, if `a_1 = a_2`, swapping Box 1 and Box 2 does not produce a new arrangement if we only consider the collection of subsets.\n        *   Let's define the set of distinct sizes as `{s_1, s_2, ..., s_k}`.\n        *   For each distinct size `s_j`, let `c_j` be its multiplicity, i.e., the number of parts `a_i` that are equal to `s_j`. (Note that `c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_k = r`).\n        *   For a given size `s_j`, there are `c_j` subsets of that size. These `c_j` subsets can be permuted among themselves in `c_j!` ways, leading to the same partition.\n        *   The total number of permutations of the `r` subsets that result in an identical partition is the product of the permutations of same-sized subsets: `c_1! c_2! \\cdots c_k!`.\n        *   This is the factor by which we have overcounted.\n\n4.  **The Final Formula:**\n    To get the final number of distinct, unlabeled partitions, we divide the result from Part 1 by the correction factor from Part 2.\n\n    Number of Tverberg partitions = `\\(\\frac{\\text{Number of ways to form labeled subsets}}{\\text{Number of redundant permutations}}\\)`\n\n    Number = `\\(\\frac{\\frac{n!}{a_1! a_2! \\cdots a_r!}}{c_1! c_2! \\cdots c_k!}\\)`\n\n    This can be written as:\n    `\\(\\frac{n!}{(a_1! a_2! \\cdots a_r!)(c_1! c_2! \\cdots c_k!)}\\)`\n    or equivalently\n    `\\(\\frac{1}{c_1! c_2! \\cdots c_k!} \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{i=1}^{r} a_i!}\\)`\n    where `c_j` is the number of parts `a_i` that are equal to the `j`-th distinct size.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nLet the partition of `n` be `a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r`. Let `{s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_k}` be the set of distinct values among the parts `{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r}\\}$. For each distinct value `s_j`, let `c_j` be its frequency (i.e., the number of times `s_j` appears in the list `a_1, \\dots, a_r`). The number of Tverberg partitions of `X` is given by the formula for partitioning a set into unlabeled subsets of specified sizes:\n`\\(\\frac{n!}{(a_1! a_2! \\cdots a_r!)(c_1! c_2! \\cdots c_k!)}\\)`\n\n<<<`\\(\\frac{n!}{(\\prod_{i=1}^{r} a_i!)(\\prod_{j=1}^{k} c_j!)}\\)` where `c_j` is the multiplicity of the j-th distinct value in the set of part sizes `{a_1, ..., a_r}`.>>>"
