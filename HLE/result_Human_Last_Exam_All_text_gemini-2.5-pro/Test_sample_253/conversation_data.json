    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final binary pattern.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand Cellular Automaton Rule 110**\n\nA one-dimensional cellular automaton consists of a row of cells, each with a state (in this case, 0 or 1). The state of each cell in the next generation is determined by a rule based on the current state of the cell and its immediate left and right neighbors.\n\nRule 110 is defined by the binary representation of the number 110, which is **01101110**. This 8-bit string maps the 8 possible 3-cell neighborhood patterns to the next state of the central cell. The standard convention lists the neighborhoods in descending order (from `111` to `000`):\n\n| Current Neighborhood (Left, Center, Right) | Next State of Center | Reason (Bit from 01101110) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `111` | **0** | 1st bit |\n| `110` | **1** | 2nd bit |\n| `101` | **1** | 3rd bit |\n| `100` | **0** | 4th bit |\n| `011` | **1** | 5th bit |\n| `010` | **1** | 6th bit |\n| `001` | **1** | 7th bit |\n| `000` | **0** | 8th bit |\n\n### **Step 2: Set the Initial State**\n\nThe simulation starts with a single cell in state 1, surrounded by an infinite number of cells in state 0.\n\n*   **Generation 0:** `...0001000...` (For calculation, we only need to focus on the `1` and its immediate `0` neighbors).\n\n### **Step 3: Apply the Rule Iteratively for 20 Generations**\n\nWe will now calculate the pattern for each generation by applying the rules defined in Step 1. The pattern of 1s will expand into the surrounding 0s.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** At each step, we must consider the cells at the edges of the current pattern and their \"0\" neighbors. For example, to find the state of the cell to the left of the pattern `110`, we use the neighborhood `011` (assuming a `0` from the left). This is incorrect. The neighborhood for the first `1` is `011`. The neighborhood for the cell *to the left* of the first `1` is `001`.\n\nLet's trace the evolution. The non-zero part of the pattern is shown for each generation.\n\n*   **Gen 0:** `1`\n*   **Gen 1:** `110`\n*   **Gen 2:** `1110`\n*   **Gen 3:** `11010`\n*   **Gen 4:** `111110`\n*   **Gen 5:** `1100010`\n*   **Gen 6:** `11100110`\n*   **Gen 7:** `110101110`\n*   **Gen 8:** `1111111010`\n*   **Gen 9:** `11000001110`\n*   **Gen 10:** `11100011010`\n*   **Gen 11:** `110100111110`\n*   **Gen 12:** `1111101100010`\n*   **Gen 13:** `11000111100110`\n*   **Gen 14:** `111001100101110`\n*   **Gen 15:** `1101011101111010`\n*   **Gen 16:** `11111110111001110`\n*   **Gen 17:** `110000011101011010`\n*   **Gen 18:** `111000110111111110`\n*   **Gen 19:** `1101001111100000010`\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Final Pattern (Generation 20)**\n\nTo get Generation 20, we apply the rule one last time to the pattern from Generation 19.\n\n*   **Pattern at Gen 19:** `1101001111100000010`\n\nWe apply the rules to every 3-cell segment of `...00` + `1101001111100000010` + `00...`\n\n1.  `...0**01**1...` -> Neighborhood `001` gives `1`.\n2.  `...00**110**...` -> Neighborhood `011` gives `1`.\n3.  `...01**101**...` -> Neighborhood `110` gives `1`.\n4.  `...11**010**...` -> Neighborhood `101` gives `1`.\n5.  `...10**100**...` -> Neighborhood `010` gives `1`.\n6.  `...01**001**...` -> Neighborhood `100` gives `0`.\n7.  ...and so on across the entire pattern.\n\nPerforming this for the entire string results in the final pattern.\n\n**Final Answer:** After applying the rule 20 times, the resulting binary pattern is:\n\n`1111101100010000110`\n\n<<<1111101100010000110>>>"
