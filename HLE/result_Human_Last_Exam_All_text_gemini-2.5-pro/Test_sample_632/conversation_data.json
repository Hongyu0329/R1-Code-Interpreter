    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome.\n    *   **Context:** The square hosting the Pantheon.\n    *   **Object:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n    *   **Action:** It was \"removed\".\n    *   **Date:** \"until 1950\". This is the key piece of information that narrows down the possibilities.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming & Elimination:**\n    *   What are the main features of the Piazza della Rotonda? The Pantheon itself, the Fontana del Pantheon (fountain), and the Egyptian obelisk on top of the fountain. These are all still present, so they are not the answer.\n    *   A famous feature *of the Pantheon* (not the square) that was removed were the two bell towers added by Bernini, often called \"the ass's ears\" (le orecchie d'asino). However, these were removed much earlier, in 1883. So, this is not the correct answer due to the date mismatch.\n\n3.  **Focusing on the 1950 Date:**\n    *   The year 1950 was a Holy Year (Giubileo) in Rome. Major civic and urban planning projects are often undertaken to prepare the city for the influx of pilgrims and to improve its appearance.\n    *   The mid-20th century was also a period of significant change in urban transportation worldwide, with many cities removing tram lines to make way for buses and increased automobile traffic.\n\n4.  **Investigating Urban Changes in Rome around 1950:**\n    *   Research into the history of Rome's public transportation reveals that a tram line ran directly through the Piazza della Rotonda.\n    *   This was not just a straight track but a prominent **tramway ring or loop** that circled the central fountain. This was certainly a \"unique\" feature, as it brought modern, noisy machinery into the heart of an ancient and revered public space.\n    *   Historical photographs from the first half of the 20th century clearly show these tram tracks and the overhead electrical lines circling the Fontana del Pantheon.\n\n5.  **Confirming the Removal:**\n    *   In the lead-up to the 1950 Holy Year, the city administration of Rome decided to dismantle many tram lines in the historic center.\n    *   The goal was twofold: to restore the \"decorum\" of the ancient monuments by removing what was seen as a modern eyesore, and to reorganize traffic flow.\n    *   The tram ring in the Piazza della Rotonda was one of the casualties of this project. It was removed, and the piazza's pavement was restored, giving it the appearance we are more familiar with today.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Distinguish the feature of the *Piazza* from features of the *Pantheon*:** The question is about the square, not the church building itself. This helps to rule out the Bernini bell towers.\n*   **The definition of \"Architectural Feature\":** While we might think of buildings, the term can also apply to significant, man-made elements of urban design that structure a space. A fixed tramway loop that dictates movement and dominates the visual landscape of a square fits this description.\n*   **The Importance of the Date:** The year 1950 is the critical clue that points away from 19th-century changes and toward post-war modernization and the Holy Year preparations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe unique architectural feature in the Piazza della Rotonda that was removed in 1950 was the tramway ring that circled the central fountain.\n\n<<<A tramway ring>>>"
