    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\n*   We are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3.\n*   Let $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$ and $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$, with $a_3, b_3 \\neq 0$.\n*   We are given that their derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are positive for all real numbers $x$.\n    *   $f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$ is a quadratic. For it to be always positive, its leading coefficient must be positive ($3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$) and its discriminant must be negative ($(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 < 12a_3a_1 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_3a_1$).\n    *   Similarly, for $g'(x)$, we must have $b_3 > 0$ and $b_2^2 < 3b_3b_1$.\n    *   The condition $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ means that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n*   We need to find the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $H(x) = f(g(x))$.\n*   A fixed point is a solution to the equation $H(x) = x$, which is $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Equation for Fixed Points**\n\n*   Let's determine the degree of the function $H(x) = f(g(x))$.\n    *   $f(x)$ has degree 3.\n    *   $g(x)$ has degree 3.\n    *   The degree of the composition $f(g(x))$ is the product of their degrees: $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   The equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n*   This is a polynomial equation. Let $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. The degree of $P(x)$ is 9.\n*   By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is at most 9.\n\n**3. Determine if 9 Fixed Points is Achievable**\n\nNow we must check if it's possible to construct functions $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and result in $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ having 9 distinct real roots.\n\n*   Let $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. For $P(x)$ to have 9 distinct real roots, its derivative, $P'(x)$, must have 8 distinct real roots according to Rolle's Theorem.\n*   Let's find $P'(x)$:\n    $P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) - 1$.\n*   So, we need the equation $f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) - 1 = 0$, or $f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) = 1$, to have 8 distinct real roots.\n*   Let $\\phi(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$. For the equation $\\phi(x) = 1$ to have 8 distinct real roots, the function $\\phi(x)$ must be suitably \"wavy\". Specifically, it must have at least 4 local minima and 3 local maxima, with the minima having values less than 1 and the maxima having values greater than 1.\n*   For $\\phi(x)$ to have 7 local extrema, its derivative $\\phi'(x)$ must have 7 distinct real roots.\n\n**4. Analyze the Derivatives**\n\nLet's find the derivative of $P(x)$ multiple times to check the degrees of the resulting polynomials.\n\n*   $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. This is a degree 9 polynomial.\n*   $P'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n    *   $f'(x)$ is degree 2. $g(x)$ is degree 3. So $f'(g(x))$ is degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   $g'(x)$ is degree 2.\n    *   $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is degree $6+2=8$.\n    *   So, $P'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. It can have at most 8 real roots. This is consistent with $P(x)$ having up to 9 roots.\n\n*   $P''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f'(g(x))g'(x))$. Using the product and chain rules:\n    $P''(x) = [f''(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)] \\cdot g'(x) + f'(g(x)) \\cdot g''(x)$\n    $P''(x) = f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$.\n    Let's find the degree of $P''(x)$:\n    *   $f'(x)$ has degree 2, $f''(x)$ has degree 1.\n    *   $g(x)$ has degree 3, $g'(x)$ has degree 2, $g''(x)$ has degree 1.\n    *   Degree of first term, $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$: Degree of $f''(g(x))$ is $1 \\times 3 = 3$. Degree of $(g'(x))^2$ is $2 \\times 2 = 4$. So degree of term is $3+4=7$.\n    *   Degree of second term, $f'(g(x))g''(x)$: Degree of $f'(g(x))$ is $2 \\times 3 = 6$. Degree of $g''(x)$ is $1$. So degree of term is $6+1=7$.\n    *   The leading coefficients of both terms are positive (since $a_3 > 0, b_3 > 0$), so they do not cancel.\n    *   Therefore, $P''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   For $P(x)$ to have 9 distinct real roots, its derivative $P'(x)$ must have 8 distinct real roots, and its second derivative $P''(x)$ must have 7 distinct real roots.\n*   We found that $P''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7. A generic polynomial of degree 7 can be constructed to have 7 distinct real roots.\n*   The functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ provide a total of 8 parameters (4 for each, like $a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0$). These parameters are subject to some inequality constraints ($f'>0, g'>0$), but they still provide enough freedom to specify the 8 coefficients of the degree 7 polynomial $P''(x)$.\n*   It is plausible to choose $f$ and $g$ such that $P''(x)$ has 7 distinct real roots.\n*   If $P''(x)$ has 7 roots, we can adjust the integration constants when finding $P'(x)$ and $P(x)$ to ensure that $P'(x)$ has 8 roots and $P(x)$ has 9 roots.\n*   Thus, it is possible to achieve 9 fixed points. Since the degree of the equation is 9, we cannot have more than 9.\n\nThe maximum number of fixed points is 9."
