    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Visualize the Flag:** The flag of Denmark features a red field with a white Nordic cross. The cross is composed of a horizontal stripe across the middle and a vertical stripe offset towards the hoist (the flagpole side).\n2.  **Represent as a Matrix:** To analyze the flag using linear algebra, we represent it as a matrix of numerical values. Each color corresponds to a distinct number. Let's assign Red = 1 and White = 2. The instruction \"assume that values in each matrix are chosen so that the rank of each flag is maximal\" means we should choose values that don't create accidental mathematical relationships (e.g., we don't choose 0 for a color if other colors are non-zero).\n3.  **Analyze the Rows:** A matrix representing the Danish flag would have two types of rows:\n    *   **Type A:** Rows that are part of the horizontal bar of the white cross. These rows would consist entirely of the value for white. For example: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`.\n    *   **Type B:** Rows that are part of the red field. These rows would cross the vertical bar of the white cross. They would consist mostly of the value for red, with the value for white at the location of the vertical bar. For example: `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]`.\n4.  **Calculate the Rank:** The entire set of rows in the flag's matrix is composed of vectors of either Type A or Type B. The row space of the matrix is therefore spanned by these two vectors. Since `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` is not a scalar multiple of `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]`, these two vectors are linearly independent. The basis for the row space has two vectors, meaning the dimension of the row space is 2.\n    *   **The rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.**\n\n### Step 2: Methodology for Analyzing Other Flags\n\nOur goal is to find African flags with a rank of 2. Based on the \"maximal rank\" assumption, the rank of a flag's matrix is the number of linearly independent color patterns that form its rows (or columns).\n\n*   **Rank 1:** A monochromatic flag (e.g., the former flag of Libya).\n*   **Rank 2:** A flag whose design is composed of exactly two unique, linearly independent patterns. Simple horizontal or vertical bicolors are clear examples. The Danish flag is a more complex example.\n*   **Rank 3 or higher:** Flags with three or more linearly independent patterns. A simple horizontal tricolor with three different colors (like Germany's) has a rank of 3. Flags with complex emblems (stars, shields) or diagonal patterns usually have multiple unique row patterns, leading to a rank of 3 or higher.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze African Flags\n\nWe search for African flags whose geometric structure results in a rank of 2.\n\n1.  **Nigeria**\n    *   **Design:** A vertical tricolor of green, white, green.\n    *   **Analysis:** The flag uses two colors. The columns of its matrix are of two types: an all-green column vector and an all-white column vector. These two types of vectors are linearly independent. The entire column space is spanned by them.\n    *   **Rank: 2.** This flag matches.\n\n2.  **Madagascar**\n    *   **Design:** A vertical white stripe at the hoist, with two horizontal stripes of red (top) and green (bottom) on the fly.\n    *   **Analysis:** This flag has three colors. Let's examine its row vectors.\n        *   A row in the top half has the pattern: `[White, White, ..., Red, Red, ...]`.\n        *   A row in the bottom half has the pattern: `[White, White, ..., Green, Green, ...]`.\n    *   These are the only two types of rows in the matrix. These two patterns are linearly independent (since Red â‰  Green). The entire row space is spanned by these two vectors.\n    *   **Rank: 2.** This flag matches.\n\n3.  **Benin**\n    *   **Design:** A vertical green stripe at the hoist, with two horizontal stripes of yellow (top) and red (bottom) on the fly.\n    *   **Analysis:** The geometric structure is identical to that of Madagascar's flag, but with different colors.\n        *   A row in the top half has the pattern: `[Green, Green, ..., Yellow, Yellow, ...]`.\n        *   A row in the bottom half has the pattern: `[Green, Green, ..., Red, Red, ...]`.\n    *   These two patterns are linearly independent and span the entire row space.\n    *   **Rank: 2.** This flag matches.\n\n### Careful Points & Why Other Flags Don't Match\n\n*   **Flags with Emblems:** Flags like those of **Somalia** (star), **Tunisia** (crescent and star), or **Angola** (machete and cogwheel) have a simple two-color background, but the central emblem introduces additional complex row patterns. The shape of the emblem creates several new linearly independent rows, making the rank greater than 2.\n*   **Simple Tricolors:** Flags with three horizontal or vertical stripes of different colors, such as **Chad**, **Mali**, or **Gabon**, have three linearly independent row/column vectors, giving them a rank of 3.\n*   **Complex Diagonal Flags:** Flags with diagonal stripes like those of **Tanzania** or the **Republic of the Congo** create many different row patterns as the stripes cross the flag, resulting in a rank of 3 or more.\n\nThe only African flags whose fundamental geometric structure can be described by exactly two linearly independent vectors are those of Nigeria, Madagascar, and Benin.\n\n<<<Nigeria, Madagascar, Benin>>>"
