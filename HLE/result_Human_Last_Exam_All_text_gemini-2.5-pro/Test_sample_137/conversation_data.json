    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the Hurwitz number.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Problem and Check Consistency**\n\nThe problem asks for the number of ramified covers from $\\mathbb{P}^1$ to $\\mathbb{P}^1$ of degree $d=7$. There are four specified branch points with ramification profiles (partitions of the degree 7):\n*   $\\mu_1 = (4,3)$\n*   $\\mu_2 = (5,2)$\n*   $\\mu_3 = (2,1,1,1,1,1) = (2, 1^5)$\n*   $\\mu_4 = (2,1,1,1,1,1) = (2, 1^5)$\n\nFirst, we use the Riemann-Hurwitz formula as a consistency check. The formula is:\n$2 - 2g = d(2 - 2g') - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (d - \\ell(\\mu_i))$\nwhere:\n*   $d=7$ is the degree of the cover.\n*   The source curve has genus $g$. The target is $\\mathbb{P}^1$, so its genus is $g'=0$.\n*   $n=4$ is the number of branch points.\n*   $\\ell(\\mu_i)$ is the number of parts in the partition $\\mu_i$ (i.e., the number of preimages over the branch point).\n\nLet's calculate $\\ell(\\mu_i)$ for each profile:\n*   $\\ell(\\mu_1) = \\ell(4,3) = 2$\n*   $\\ell(\\mu_2) = \\ell(5,2) = 2$\n*   $\\ell(\\mu_3) = \\ell(2, 1^5) = 6$\n*   $\\ell(\\mu_4) = \\ell(2, 1^5) = 6$\n\nNow, let's compute the total ramification index:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{4} (d - \\ell(\\mu_i)) = (7-2) + (7-2) + (7-6) + (7-6) = 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\n\nPlugging these values into the Riemann-Hurwitz formula:\n$2 - 2g = 7(2 - 2 \\cdot 0) - 12$\n$2 - 2g = 14 - 12$\n$2 - 2g = 2$\n$g = 0$.\n\nThe genus of the source curve is 0, which means it is also $\\mathbb{P}^1$. This is consistent with the problem statement.\n\n### **Step 2: Translate to a Permutation Group Problem**\n\nThe Hurwitz number, in this context, counts the number of tuples of permutations $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4)$ in the symmetric group $S_d$ (here $S_7$) satisfying certain conditions:\n1.  The cycle type of each $\\sigma_i$ matches the partition $\\mu_i$.\n2.  The product of the permutations is the identity element: $\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_3 \\sigma_4 = 1$.\n3.  The group $G = \\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4 \\rangle$ generated by these permutations is a transitive subgroup of $S_7$.\n\nThis number is often denoted $N_{conn}(\\mu_1, \\dots, \\mu_n)$.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Transitivity Condition**\n\nA crucial simplification comes from analyzing the transitivity of the group $G$.\n*   A group is intransitive if the set $\\{1, 2, ..., 7\\}$ can be partitioned into proper non-empty subsets that are invariant under the action of every element of the group.\n*   Consider $\\sigma_1$ with cycle type $(4,3)$. The orbits of the cyclic group $\\langle \\sigma_1 \\rangle$ are two sets of sizes 4 and 3. Any invariant partition of $\\{1, ..., 7\\}$ under $G$ must be a union of these orbits. For $G$ to be intransitive, its orbits must be precisely these two sets of size 4 and 3.\n*   Consider $\\sigma_2$ with cycle type $(5,2)$. The orbits of $\\langle \\sigma_2 \\rangle$ are two sets of sizes 5 and 2. For $G$ to be intransitive, its orbits would have to be these two sets of size 5 and 2.\n*   For the group $G = \\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4 \\rangle$ to be intransitive, its orbit partition must be compatible with all its generators. However, the set $\\{1, ..., 7\\}$ cannot be partitioned into sets of sizes (4,3) and simultaneously into sets of sizes (5,2).\n\nThis means that any group $G$ generated by permutations with these cycle types must be transitive. Therefore, the third condition is automatically satisfied. We only need to count the total number of tuples $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4)$ satisfying the first two conditions.\n\n### **Step 4: Use the Character Formula**\n\nThe number of such tuples can be calculated using the character theory of the symmetric group $S_d$. The formula for the total number of solutions $N_{total}$ is:\n$N_{total} = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^{n} |C_i|}{|S_d|} \\sum_{\\lambda \\vdash d} \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\chi^\\lambda(\\mu_i)}{(\\chi^\\lambda(1^d))^{n-2}}$\nwhere:\n*   $C_i$ is the conjugacy class in $S_7$ corresponding to partition $\\mu_i$.\n*   $|C_i|$ is the size of the conjugacy class.\n*   $\\chi^\\lambda$ is the irreducible character of $S_7$ corresponding to the partition $\\lambda \\vdash 7$.\n*   $\\chi^\\lambda(\\mu_i)$ is the value of the character on the class $C_i$.\n*   $\\chi^\\lambda(1^d) = f^\\lambda$ is the dimension of the representation.\n\n**Calculate the sizes of the conjugacy classes in $S_7$:**\n*   $|S_7| = 7! = 5040$.\n*   $|C_{(4,3)}| = \\frac{7!}{4 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{5040}{12} = 420$.\n*   $|C_{(5,2)}| = \\frac{7!}{5 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{5040}{10} = 504$.\n*   $|C_{(2,1^5)}| = \\frac{7!}{2 \\cdot 1^5 \\cdot 5!} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 6}{2} = 21$.\n\n**Calculate the pre-factor:**\n$\\frac{|C_{(4,3)}| |C_{(5,2)}| |C_{(2,1^5)}| |C_{(2,1^5)}|}{|S_7|} = \\frac{420 \\cdot 504 \\cdot 21 \\cdot 21}{5040} = 18522$.\n\nSo, $N_{total} = 18522 \\sum_{\\lambda \\vdash 7} \\frac{\\chi^\\lambda(4,3) \\chi^\\lambda(5,2) (\\chi^\\lambda(2,1^5))^2}{(f^\\lambda)^2}$.\n\n### **Step 5: Perform the Summation**\n\nWe need the character table of $S_7$. Using a standard, reliable source (like the GAP system or the book by James and Kerber), we can find the required character values. We sum the term $\\frac{\\chi^\\lambda(4,3) \\chi^\\lambda(5,2) (\\chi^\\lambda(2,1^5))^2}{(f^\\lambda)^2}$ over all 15 irreducible representations $\\lambda$ of $S_7$.\n\nThe non-zero terms in the sum are:\n*   $\\lambda=(7)$: $1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1)^2 / 1^2 = 1$\n*   $\\lambda=(5,2)$: $(-1) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (8)^2 / 14^2 = -64/196 = -16/49$\n*   $\\lambda=(4,3)$: $1 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (4)^2 / 14^2 = -16/196 = -4/49$\n*   $\\lambda=(3,3,1)$: $(-2) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (5)^2 / 21^2 = -50/441$\n*   $\\lambda=(3,2,2)$: $1 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-3)^2 / 21^2 = -9/441 = -1/49$\n*   $\\lambda=(3,2,1^2)$: $1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-5)^2 / 35^2 = 25/1225 = 1/49$\n*   $\\lambda=(2^3,1)$: $(-1) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-8)^2 / 14^2 = -64/196 = -16/49$\n*   $\\lambda=(2^2,1^3)$: $1 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-4)^2 / 14^2 = -16/196 = -4/49$\n*   $\\lambda=(1^7)$: $(-1) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-1)^2 / 1^2 = 1$\n(Note: For representations like $\\lambda=(6,1)$, the character value $\\chi^{(6,1)}(4,3)$ is 0, so the term is zero).\n\nSumming these values:\nSum = $1 + 1 - \\frac{16}{49} - \\frac{4}{49} - \\frac{50}{441} - \\frac{1}{49} + \\frac{1}{49} - \\frac{16}{49} - \\frac{4}{49}$\nSum = $2 - \\frac{16+4+1-1+16+4}{49} - \\frac{50}{441}$\nSum = $2 - \\frac{40}{49} - \\frac{50}{441}$\nTo add these, we use a common denominator of $441 = 9 \\times 49$.\nSum = $\\frac{2 \\cdot 441}{441} - \\frac{40 \\cdot 9}{441} - \\frac{50}{441} = \\frac{882 - 360 - 50}{441} = \\frac{472}{441}$.\n\n### **Step 6: Calculate the Final Number**\n\nNow we multiply the sum by the pre-factor:\nHurwitz Number = $N_{total} = 18522 \\times \\frac{472}{441}$\nSince $18522 = 42 \\times 441$, this simplifies to:\nHurwitz Number = $42 \\times 472$.\n\n$42 \\times 472 = 42 \\times (400 + 70 + 2) = 16800 + 2940 + 84 = 19824$.\n\nThe Hurwitz number is the number of such tuples of permutations, which we found to be 19824.\n\n<<<19824>>>"
