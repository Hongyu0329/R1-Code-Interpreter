    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Building Blocks\n\nFirst, let's define the basic combinators and the church numeral components present in the expression.\n\n*   **S combinator:** `S x y z = x z (y z)`\n*   **K combinator:** `K x y = x`\n*   **I combinator:** `I x = x`\n*   **Church Numeral `n`:** A function that takes a function `f` and a value `x` and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times. In lambda calculus: `n = λf.λx. f^n(x)`.\n*   **Successor function (`succ`):** Takes a church numeral `n` and returns `n+1`. In SKI, `succ = S(S(K S)K)`.\n*   **Mockingbird combinator (`ω`):** The self-application combinator, `ω x = x x`. In SKI, `ω = S(I)(I)`.\n\n### 2. Deconstructing the Expression\n\nLet's break down the given expression:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`\n\nWe can identify the `succ` and `ω` combinators within this expression.\n*   `succ = S(S(K(S))(K))`\n*   `ω = S(I)(I)`\n*   The Church numeral `1` is represented by `I`.\n*   Therefore, `succ I` represents the Church numeral `2`.\n\nLet's substitute these named components back into the expression `E`:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(succ I))))(succ ω)`\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(2))))(succ ω)`\n\nThe expression has the structure of one large term applied to another. Let's call them `A` and `B`:\n`E = A B`\nwhere:\n*   `A = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(2))))`\n*   `B = succ ω`\n\n### 3. Analyzing Part A\n\nPart `A` is a nested application of the combinator `S(I)`. Let's analyze `S(I)`'s behavior.\n`S(I) x y = I y (x y) = y (x y)`\n\nLet's see how `A` simplifies when applied to an argument, say `z`.\nLet `op = S(I)`. So `A = op(op(op(K(2))))`.\n1.  `op(K(2)) z = z((K(2))z) = z(2)`.\n2.  `op(op(K(2))) z = z((op(K(2)))z) = z(z(2))`.\n3.  `op(op(op(K(2)))) z = z((op(op(K(2))))z) = z(z(z(2)))`.\nSo, `A` is a function that takes an argument `z` and applies it to itself three times, with the innermost application receiving `2` as its argument. In lambda calculus, `A = λz. z(z(z(2)))`.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Full Expression E\n\nNow we can evaluate the full expression `E = A B`. We substitute `B` for `z` in our lambda expression for `A`.\n`E = (λz. z(z(z(2)))) (succ ω)`\n`E = (succ ω) ( (succ ω) ( (succ ω) 2 ) )`\n\nTo simplify this, let's define a new function `h(k) = (succ ω) k`.\nThen `E = h(h(h(2)))`. Our goal is to find the Church numeral that `E` represents. To do this, we must first understand what `h(k)` evaluates to.\n\n### 5. Analyzing the Function `h(k)`\n\nLet's determine what Church numeral `h(k)` represents, where `k` is a Church numeral. We do this by evaluating `h(k)` applied to a function `f`.\n`h(k) f = ((succ ω) k) f`\n\nThe successor function is defined as `succ n = λg.λx. g(n g x)`.\nSo, `succ ω = λg.λx. g(ω g x)`.\nApplying `succ ω` to `k` means we substitute `k` for `g`:\n`(succ ω) k = λx. k(ω k x)`\n\nNow we apply this to `f`:\n`h(k) f = ((succ ω) k) f = (λx. k(ω k x)) f = k(ω k f)`\n\nThe next step is to evaluate `ω k f`.\n`ω k f = (S I I) k f = (k k) f`\nThe term `k k` means applying the Church numeral `k` to itself. Let's see what `k(m f)` represents, where `k` and `m` are church numerals.\n`m f = λx. f^m x`.\n`k(m f)` applies `f^m` to its argument `k` times.\n`k(m f) x = (f^m)^k x = f^(k*m) x`.\nSo, applying Church numeral `k` to `m f` results in the Church numeral for `k * m`.\n\nUsing this, `(k k) f = k(k f) = (k*k)f = (k^2)f`.\nSo, `ω k f` simplifies to the Church numeral for `k^2` applied to `f`.\n\nNow substitute this back into the expression for `h(k) f`:\n`h(k) f = k(ω k f) = k((k^2)f)`\nThis represents the multiplication of `k` and `k^2`.\n`h(k) f = (k * k^2)f = (k^3)f`\nThis means that the function `h(k)` takes a Church numeral `k` and returns the Church numeral for `k^3`.\n\n### 6. Final Calculation\n\nWe can now calculate the value of `n` represented by `E = h(h(h(2)))`.\n1.  **Innermost call:** `h(2) = 2^3 = 8`.\n2.  **Middle call:** `h(h(2)) = h(8) = 8^3 = 512`.\n3.  **Outermost call:** `h(h(h(2))) = h(512) = 512^3`.\n\nSo, the Church integer `n` is `512^3`.\nTo compute `log_2(n)`, we can express `n` as a power of 2.\n`n = 512^3 = (2^9)^3 = 2^(9 * 3) = 2^27`.\n\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(n) = log_2(2^27) = 27`.\n\n<<<27>>>"
