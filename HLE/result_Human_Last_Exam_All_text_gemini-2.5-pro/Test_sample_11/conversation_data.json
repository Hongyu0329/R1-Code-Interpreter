    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core task is to identify the very first law passed by the Knesset (the Israeli parliament) after the establishment of the state in 1948 that uses the explicit legal term \"good faith\" (in Hebrew: \"תום לב\", *tom lev*). The question has specific formatting requirements for the final answer: do not include \"the\" or the year of the statute.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   The most famous Israeli law concerning good faith is the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Its sections 12 and 39 established good faith as a foundational, overarching principle governing pre-contractual negotiations and the performance of contractual obligations.\n    *   However, the question asks for the *first* statute, not the most famous or the one that gave the principle its broadest application. Therefore, we must look for legislation enacted *before* 1973.\n\n3.  **Investigating Pre-1973 Legislation:** We need to examine major civil law statutes enacted in the 1960s, which was a period of significant legislative activity aimed at replacing older Ottoman and British Mandate law.\n\n    *   **Agency Law, 1965:** This law governs the relationship between a principal and an agent. Section 8 imposes a duty of \"loyalty\" (\"נאמנות\", *ne'emanut*) on the agent. While loyalty is closely related to good faith, it is a distinct legal term. The statute does not explicitly use the phrase \"good faith\" (*tom lev*).\n    *   **Sale Law, 1968:** This law governs contracts for the sale of goods. A review of its text shows that it does not explicitly contain the term \"good faith\". The obligations within it were later interpreted by courts through the good faith lens provided by the 1973 Contracts Law, but the concept was not introduced in the 1968 law itself.\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** This is a comprehensive statute that codifies the law regarding real property. This is a very strong candidate. Specifically, we must examine the \"market overt\" rule (*takanat ha-shuk*) as it applies to land.\n        *   **Careful Point:** Section 10 of the Land Law, 1969 states that a person who acquires a right in registered land for consideration, relying **in good faith** (\"בתום-לב\", *be-tom lev*) on the official land registry, will have their right protected even if the registry was incorrect.\n        *   This is an explicit, unambiguous use of the term \"good faith\" in a major statute.\n\n4.  **Comparing the Candidates:**\n    *   The Contracts (General Part) Law was enacted in 1973.\n    *   The Land Law was enacted in 1969.\n    *   Since 1969 comes before 1973, the Land Law predates the Contracts Law.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** While the Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973, is celebrated for elevating \"good faith\" to a general principle across Israeli civil law, the **Land Law, 1969** was the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly incorporate the term and concept of \"good faith\" into its text.\n\n6.  **Final Answer Formulation:** Following the user's instructions, the answer should be the name of the statute without \"the\" or the year.\n\n<<<Land Law>>>"
