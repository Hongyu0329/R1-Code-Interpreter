    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the term \"all-or-nothing vaccine\".**\n\n*   An \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine (also known as a vaccine with efficacy against susceptibility) works by conferring complete immunity to a certain fraction of the vaccinated individuals.\n*   The remaining fraction of the vaccinated population receives no protection at all and remains as susceptible to infection as unvaccinated individuals.\n*   Let's denote the fraction of vaccinated individuals who are fully protected as `VE_s` (Vaccine Efficacy for Susceptibility).\n*   This means a proportion `VE_s` of the vaccinated group is immune (0% chance of infection).\n*   The other proportion, `1 - VE_s`, is fully susceptible (100% chance of infection, same as the unvaccinated).\n\n**Step 2: Understand \"per-exposure vaccine efficacy\" (`VE_pe`).**\n\n*   Per-exposure efficacy is the reduction in the probability of getting infected from a single infectious exposure or contact.\n*   Let's calculate `VE_pe` for our all-or-nothing vaccine model.\n    *   Let `p` be the probability of infection per exposure for an unvaccinated (and therefore susceptible) person.\n    *   For a randomly chosen vaccinated person, there are two possibilities for an exposure event:\n        1.  They are in the protected group (with probability `VE_s`). Their chance of infection is 0.\n        2.  They are in the unprotected group (with probability `1 - VE_s`). Their chance of infection is `p`.\n    *   The *average* probability of infection per exposure for a vaccinated person is: `(VE_s * 0) + ((1 - VE_s) * p) = (1 - VE_s) * p`.\n    *   The formula for `VE_pe` is: `(Prob_unvacc - Prob_vacc) / Prob_unvacc`.\n    *   `VE_pe = (p - (1 - VE_s) * p) / p = (p * [1 - (1 - VE_s)]) / p = 1 - 1 + VE_s = VE_s`.\n*   **Conclusion for this step:** For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the per-exposure vaccine efficacy (`VE_pe`) is equal to the fraction of the vaccinated population that is fully protected (`VE_s`).\n\n**Step 3: Understand \"1 - incidence rate ratio (IRR)\".**\n\n*   This is a standard formula for calculating vaccine efficacy from observational data or clinical trials.\n*   The Incidence Rate (IR) is the rate of new cases in a population over a period of person-time.\n*   `IR_u` = Incidence Rate in the unvaccinated group.\n*   `IR_v` = Incidence Rate in the vaccinated group.\n*   `IRR = IR_v / IR_u`.\n*   The calculated vaccine efficacy, let's call it `VE_calc`, is `1 - IRR`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the IRR for an all-or-nothing vaccine.**\n\n*   Let `λ` (lambda) be the force of infection, which is the instantaneous rate at which a susceptible individual gets infected. We assume `λ` is the same for all susceptible people, regardless of their vaccination status.\n*   **For the unvaccinated group (`IR_u`):** Everyone is susceptible. The rate at which new cases arise is directly proportional to the force of infection. Therefore, `IR_u = λ`.\n*   **For the vaccinated group (`IR_v`):** This group is a mix. A fraction `VE_s` is immune (rate of infection is 0). A fraction `1 - VE_s` is susceptible (rate of infection is `λ`).\n*   The *average* incidence rate for the entire vaccinated group is the weighted average: `IR_v = (VE_s * 0) + ((1 - VE_s) * λ) = (1 - VE_s) * λ`.\n*   **Now, calculate the IRR:**\n    *   `IRR = IR_v / IR_u = ((1 - VE_s) * λ) / λ = 1 - VE_s`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate `1 - IRR` and compare it to the per-exposure efficacy.**\n\n*   From Step 4, we found that `IRR = 1 - VE_s`.\n*   Therefore, the calculated vaccine efficacy is `VE_calc = 1 - IRR = 1 - (1 - VE_s) = VE_s`.\n*   From Step 2, we found that the true per-exposure efficacy is `VE_pe = VE_s`.\n*   Comparing the two, we see that `VE_calc = VE_pe`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Model Type is Key:** The result depends entirely on the vaccine's mechanism of action. The conclusion would be different for a \"leaky\" vaccine (which reduces infection probability for everyone, but doesn't make anyone fully immune) if there is also heterogeneity of risk in the population. However, for an all-or-nothing vaccine, this complication does not lead to bias.\n2.  **Assumptions:** This analysis assumes no confounding factors. For example, it assumes that vaccinated and unvaccinated people have similar underlying risk behaviors and exposure patterns. This is typically handled by randomization in a clinical trial.\n3.  **Frailty/Heterogeneity:** A common issue in VE estimation is \"frailty bias,\" where individuals with higher risk get infected and are removed from the susceptible pool earlier. This can cause the measured VE to change over time. However, for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the susceptible individuals in the vaccinated group are biologically identical to the susceptible individuals in the unvaccinated group. Thus, they are depleted from their respective susceptible pools at the same rate (`λ`), and the hazard ratio between the groups remains constant. Consequently, `1 - IRR` remains an unbiased estimator.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe measure `1 - incidence rate ratio` calculates a value of `VE_s`. The definition of per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine also evaluates to `VE_s`. Therefore, the `1 - IRR` method **correctly estimates** the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for this type of vaccine.\n\n<<<C>>>"
