    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the group G**\n\nThe group $G$ is generated by three permutations $a, b, c$ of the set $\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z \\}$, which has 12 elements. Thus, $G$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_{12}$.\n\nLet's analyze the generators:\n*   $a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x)$ is a cycle of length 11 (an 11-cycle).\n*   $b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, x, 7, 6)$ is a product of two disjoint 4-cycles.\n*   $c = (1, 2)(3, z)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, y)(9, x)$ is a product of six disjoint 2-cycles (transpositions).\n\nTo determine which subgroup of $S_{12}$ this is, we check the sign of the permutations. A permutation's sign is $(-1)^{n-k}$, where $n$ is the number of elements being permuted and $k$ is the number of disjoint cycles.\n*   The sign of $a$ (an 11-cycle) is $(-1)^{11-1} = (-1)^{10} = +1$. So, $a$ is an even permutation.\n*   The sign of $b$ (two 4-cycles) is $(-1)^{4-1} \\times (-1)^{4-1} = (-1) \\times (-1) = +1$. So, $b$ is an even permutation.\n*   The sign of $c$ (six 2-cycles) is $(-1)^{2-1} \\times (-1)^{2-1} \\times (-1)^{2-1} \\times (-1)^{2-1} \\times (-1)^{2-1} \\times (-1)^{2-1} = (-1)^6 = +1$. So, $c$ is an even permutation.\n\nSince all generators are even permutations, any element in the group $G = \\langle a, b, c \\rangle$ must also be an even permutation. Therefore, $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_{12}$.\n\nThe group $G$ acts on a set of 12 elements and contains an 11-cycle. A theorem by Jordan states that if a primitive group of degree $n$ contains a prime cycle of length $p \\le n-3$, it must be $A_n$ or $S_n$. This doesn't directly apply here since $p=11$ and $n=12$, so $p > n-3$. However, another classic result states that a primitive subgroup of $S_n$ containing an $(n-1)$-cycle is either $A_n$ or $S_n$. Here we have a group on 12 points with an 11-cycle. The presence of an $(n-1)$-cycle in a transitive group implies primitivity. The group $G$ is transitive. Thus, $G$ is a primitive subgroup of $A_{12}$ containing an 11-cycle.\nThe classification of such groups tells us that the only possibilities for $G$ are $A_{12}$ and the Mathieu group $M_{12}$. The given generators are, in fact, known generators for the Mathieu group $M_{12}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Schur Multiplier A**\n\nThe problem defines $A$ as the Schur multiplier of $G$. The Schur multiplier of a group $G$, denoted $M(G)$, is the second homology group $H_2(G, \\mathbb{Z})$. We need to find the Schur multiplier for the possible groups $G$.\n\n*   **Case 1: G is the Mathieu group $M_{12}$**\n    The Schur multipliers of the sporadic simple groups are well-known results in group theory. The Schur multiplier of $M_{12}$ is the cyclic group of order 2.\n    $M(M_{12}) = C_2$.\n\n*   **Case 2: G is the alternating group $A_{12}$**\n    The Schur multiplier of the alternating group $A_n$ is also a standard result. For $n \\ge 8$, $M(A_n) = C_2$.\n    Thus, $M(A_{12}) = C_2$.\n\nIn both possible scenarios, the Schur multiplier $A$ is the cyclic group of order 2.\nSo, $A \\cong C_2$.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of proper subgroups of A, up to isomorphism**\n\nWe have determined that $A$ is the cyclic group of order 2, $C_2$. Now we need to find its proper subgroups and count how many distinct isomorphism classes they fall into.\n\nThe subgroups of a group must have orders that divide the order of the group (Lagrange's Theorem). The order of $A = C_2$ is 2. The divisors of 2 are 1 and 2.\n\n*   **Subgroup of order 1:** There is only one subgroup of order 1 in any group, which is the trivial subgroup containing only the identity element, $\\{e\\}$. This subgroup is isomorphic to the trivial group, often denoted $C_1$.\n*   **Subgroup of order 2:** There is one subgroup of order 2, which is the group $A$ itself. This subgroup is isomorphic to $C_2$.\n\nA **proper subgroup** of a group $A$ is a subgroup $H$ such that $H \\neq A$.\nFor $A=C_2$, the subgroups are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$. The only proper subgroup is the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n\nThe question asks to count the number of proper subgroups **up to isomorphism**. This means we need to find the number of distinct isomorphism classes represented by the proper subgroups.\n\nThe set of proper subgroups of $A$ is $S = \\{ \\{e\\} \\}$.\nThe only element in this set is the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\nThe trivial subgroup is isomorphic to the trivial group $C_1$.\nSo, there is only one isomorphism class for all proper subgroups of $A$.\n\nTherefore, the number of proper subgroups of $A$, up to isomorphism, is 1."
