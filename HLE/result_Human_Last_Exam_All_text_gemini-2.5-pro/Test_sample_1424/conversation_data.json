    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Bare Green's Function in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe starting point is the definition of the two-point Green's function (or propagator) in the Feynman path integral formalism. For a non-interacting system, this is called the \"bare\" Green's function, $G_0$. It is defined as the time-ordered expectation value of field operators, calculated using the path integral over the non-interacting action, $S_0$.\n\nFor a fermionic field $\\psi(x)$, where $x=(t, \\mathbf{r})$ represents a spacetime point, the bare Green's function is:\n$G_0(x, x') = -i \\langle T[\\psi(x) \\psi^\\dagger(x')] \\rangle_0 = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x) \\psi^*(x') \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]}}$\nHere, $T$ denotes time-ordering, and the subscript '0' on the expectation value indicates it's calculated with the non-interacting action $S_0$. The fields $\\psi$ and $\\psi^*$ are Grassmann variables.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Non-Interacting Action $S_0$**\n\nThe non-interacting action, $S_0$, is quadratic in the fields. Its general form is:\n$S_0[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\int dt \\int d^d\\mathbf{r} \\, \\psi^*(t, \\mathbf{r}) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0 \\right) \\psi(t, \\mathbf{r})$\nwhere $\\hat{H}_0$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian, which contains the kinetic energy and any external potential, but no particle-particle interactions. For simplicity, we will set $\\hbar=1$ from now on.\n\n**Step 3: Diagonalize the Action**\n\nTo evaluate the Gaussian path integral, the most effective method is to change to a basis where the operator $K = (i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0)$ is diagonal. This is achieved by:\n1.  **Spatial Part**: Using the eigenbasis of the single-particle Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$. Let $|\\phi_k\\rangle$ be the eigenstates with corresponding energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$:\n    $\\hat{H}_0 \\phi_k(\\mathbf{r}) = \\epsilon_k \\phi_k(\\mathbf{r})$\n    The label 'k' can represent momentum for a free particle, or a set of quantum numbers for a particle in a potential.\n2.  **Temporal Part**: Performing a Fourier transform from the time domain ($t$) to the frequency domain ($\\omega$).\n\nWe expand the field $\\psi(t, \\mathbf{r})$ in this new basis:\n$\\psi(t, \\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} e^{-i\\omega t} \\phi_k(\\mathbf{r}) \\psi_k(\\omega)$\n\n**Step 4: The Action in the Diagonal Basis**\n\nSubstituting this expansion back into the expression for $S_0$ and using the orthonormality of the basis functions, the action becomes diagonal. The operator $(i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0)$ acting on the expansion gives:\n$(i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0) \\psi(t, \\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} (\\omega - \\epsilon_k) e^{-i\\omega t} \\phi_k(\\mathbf{r}) \\psi_k(\\omega)$\n\nThe action simplifies to a sum over uncoupled modes $(k, \\omega)$:\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\psi_k^*(\\omega) (\\omega - \\epsilon_k) \\psi_k(\\omega)$\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Path Integral for $G_0(k, \\omega)$**\n\nIn this diagonal basis, the Green's function, now denoted $G_0(k, \\omega)$, corresponds to the expectation value $\\langle \\psi_k(\\omega) \\psi_k^*(\\omega) \\rangle_0$. For a Gaussian integral over Grassmann variables of the form $\\int d\\psi^* d\\psi \\, \\psi \\psi^* e^{i \\psi^* A \\psi}$, the result is proportional to $A^{-1}$.\nTherefore, the Green's function in the $(k, \\omega)$ basis is the inverse of the kernel $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto (\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$\n\n**Step 6: Incorporate the Feynman Prescription for Causality**\n\nThe expression $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$ has a pole on the real axis at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$, making the integral over $\\omega$ ill-defined. The time-ordering $T$ in the original definition of $G_0$ provides a prescription for how to handle this pole. This is the Feynman prescription, which physically ensures causality (particles propagate forward in time, holes backward). It is implemented by adding an infinitesimal imaginary part to the denominator.\n\nThe precise form is:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the chemical potential (or Fermi energy at zero temperature), and $\\delta$ is a positive infinitesimal (often written as $\\eta$).\n\n*   For an unoccupied state (a particle state), $\\epsilon_k > \\mu$, the denominator is $\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta$.\n*   For an occupied state (a hole state), $\\epsilon_k < \\mu$, the denominator is $\\omega - \\epsilon_k - i\\delta$.\n\nThis ensures that when we Fourier transform back to the time domain, we get non-zero propagation for particles only for $t > t'$ and for holes only for $t' > t$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Full Green's Function**: This analysis is for the **bare** propagator $G_0$. In an interacting system, particle-particle interactions modify this. The full propagator $G$ is given by the Dyson equation, $G(k, \\omega)^{-1} = G_0(k, \\omega)^{-1} - \\Sigma(k, \\omega)$, where $\\Sigma$ is the self-energy. The dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ becomes much more complex.\n2.  **Choice of Basis**: The simple inverse relationship is only manifest in the $(k, \\omega)$ basis, where $k$ labels the eigenstates of the non-interacting Hamiltonian. In position space, $G_0(x, x')$ is a sum over all these modes and has a more complicated form.\n3.  **The $i\\delta$ Prescription**: The addition of the infinitesimal $i\\delta$ is not ad-hoc. It is a direct mathematical consequence of enforcing the time-ordering condition and is fundamental to the definition of the Feynman propagator.\n4.  **Role of the Fermi Sea**: The distinction between particle and hole propagation (the sign of the $i\\delta$ term) is crucial in many-body physics and is determined by whether the single-particle state $k$ is occupied or empty in the non-interacting ground state (the Fermi sea).\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nFrom the analysis above, the non-interacting action in the energy-eigenstate and frequency basis is $S_0 = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\psi_k^*(\\omega) (\\omega - \\epsilon_k) \\psi_k(\\omega)$. The bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is the inverse of the kernel of this quadratic action, with the appropriate causal prescription.\n\nThus, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\nThe function is an inverse linear function of the energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$, specifically of the difference between the frequency $\\omega$ and the energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function in the frequency-momentum representation, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is the inverse of the kernel of the quadratic part of the action. This results in an inverse linear dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. The specific functional form is given by:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\nwhere $\\omega$ is the frequency, and $i\\delta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary term whose sign depends on whether the state $k$ is a particle or hole state, ensuring causality. Therefore, the functional dependence is of the form $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$.>>>"
