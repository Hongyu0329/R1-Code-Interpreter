In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function in the frequency-momentum representation, $G_0(k, \omega)$, is the inverse of the kernel of the quadratic part of the action. This results in an inverse linear dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$. The specific functional form is given by:
$G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k + i\delta}$
where $\omega$ is the frequency, and $i\delta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary term whose sign depends on whether the state $k$ is a particle or hole state, ensuring causality. Therefore, the functional dependence is of the form $(\omega - \epsilon_k)^{-1}$.
