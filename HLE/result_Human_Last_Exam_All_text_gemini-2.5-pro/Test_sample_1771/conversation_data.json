    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical linguistic development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb into its reflexes in Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form\n\n*   **PIE Root:** The root is *seh₂g-* meaning 'to track, trace, perceive keenly'. The examples *Hitt. sākizzi* and *Lat. sāgīre* confirm this root.\n*   **PIE Verb Form:** The provided form is *seh₂gieti*. This is an *e*-grade thematic present tense (*-ie/o-* suffix). However, the verb that develops in Germanic with the meaning 'to seek' is a causative/iterative formation. Causatives in PIE are typically formed with an *o*-grade root and the suffix *-éie-. Therefore, a more precise PIE ancestor for the Germanic forms is the causative stem **\\*soh₂g-éie-**, meaning 'to cause to track' or 'to look for'.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation into Proto-Germanic (PGmc)\n\nWe will trace the sound changes from PIE **\\*soh₂g-éie-** to Proto-Germanic. The infinitive form in PGmc would be **\\*sōkijaną**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Grimm's Law.** This is the fundamental sound shift from PIE to PGmc. The PIE voiced velar stop **\\*g** becomes a voiceless velar stop **\\*k**.\n    *   *soh₂g-* → *soh₂k-*\n*   **Careful Point 2: Laryngeal Reflexes.** The laryngeal **\\*h₂** colors the adjacent **\\*o** to **\\*a** and then lengthens it. The sequence **\\*oh₂** becomes PGmc long **\\*ō**.\n    *   *soh₂k-* → **\\*sōk-**\n*   **Careful Point 3: Verb Class.** The PIE causative suffix **\\*-éie-** regularly becomes the suffix for Class 1 weak verbs in Proto-Germanic, which is **\\*-ija-**. The infinitive ending is **\\*-aną**.\n    *   Combining the root and suffix gives the infinitive: **\\*sōk- + -ijaną** → **\\*sōkijaną**.\n\n**Proto-Germanic Result:** **\\*sōkijaną**\n\n### Step 3: Derivation into Daughter Languages\n\nNow we derive the forms in Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German from the Proto-Germanic infinitive **\\*sōkijaną**.\n\n#### A. Old Norse (ON)\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: I-Umlaut.** The **\\*j** in the suffix **\\*-ijaną** causes the preceding back vowel **\\*ō** to be fronted. The i-umlaut of **\\*ō** is **\\*ǿ** (a long, front, rounded vowel).\n    *   *sōkjan* → *sǿkjan*\n*   **Careful Point 2: Suffix Change.** The PGmc infinitive ending **\\*-aną** becomes **-a** in Old Norse. The **\\*j** is retained after the velar consonant.\n    *   *sǿkjan* → **sǿkja**\n\n**Old Norse Result:** **sǿkja**\n\n#### B. Old English (OE)\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: I-Umlaut.** As in Old Norse, the **\\*i** or **\\*j** from the suffix causes i-umlaut of the root vowel **\\*ō**. In Old English, the i-umlaut of **\\*ō** is **\\*ē**.\n    *   *sōkian* → *sēkian*\n*   **Careful Point 2: Palatalization.** In Old English, velar consonants (**\\*k**, **\\*g**) were palatalized to postalveolar affricates when they occurred before a front vowel like **\\*i**. Thus, **\\*k** becomes **ċ** (pronounced /tʃ/).\n    *   *sēkian* → *sēċian*\n*   **Careful Point 3: Syncope.** The unstressed medial vowel **-i-** was lost. The palatal quality of the consonant **ċ** was retained. In standard Old English orthography, this is often written simply as **c**.\n    *   *sēċian* → **sēcan**\n\n**Old English Result:** **sēcan**\n\n#### C. Old High German (OHG)\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: High German Consonant Shift.** This is the defining feature of High German. The PGmc voiceless stop **\\*k** shifts to a long voiceless fricative **hh** (pronounced /xː/) when it follows a vowel.\n    *   *sōkijaną* → *sōhhijan*\n*   **Careful Point 2: OHG Diphthongization.** The long vowel **\\*ō** from Proto-Germanic diphthongizes to **uo** in Old High German.\n    *   *sōhhijan* → *suohhijan*\n*   **Careful Point 3: Suffix Change and I-Umlaut.** The suffix **\\*-jan** becomes **-en** in the OHG infinitive. The original **\\*j** is lost, but first it triggers i-umlaut on the root vowel. The i-umlaut of the diphthong **uo** is **üe**. However, in many Old High German texts, this umlaut is not graphically represented in the infinitive.\n    *   *suohhijan* → *suohhen* (or less commonly written *süohhen*)\n\n**Old High German Result:** **suohhen**\n\n### Final Answer\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** \\*sōkijaną\n*   **Old Norse:** sǿkja\n*   **Old English:** sēcan\n*   **Old High German:** suohhen\n\n<<<**Proto-Germanic:** \\*sōkijaną; **Old Norse:** sǿkja; **Old English:** sēcan; **Old High German:** suohhen>>>"
