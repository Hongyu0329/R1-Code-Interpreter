    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe question asks to identify the specific type of conceptual metaphor represented by the phrase \"my love for humanity,\" according to the framework established in works like Lakoff and Johnson's \"Metaphors We Live By\" (which is the likely source for \"Conceptual Metaphor in Everyday Language\").\n\n**Step 2: Identify the metaphor in the phrase.**\nThe phrase \"my love for humanity\" treats the abstract concept of **LOVE** (the target domain) as if it were a physical **OBJECT** or **SUBSTANCE** (the source domain).\n*   **\"My love\"**: This implies that love is a possession, something that can be owned like an object.\n*   **\"for humanity\"**: This implies that this object/substance can be directed towards a target.\n\nThe underlying conceptual metaphor is **LOVE IS AN OBJECT/SUBSTANCE**.\n\n**Step 3: Recall the major types of conceptual metaphors.**\nAccording to Lakoff and Johnson, the main types of conceptual metaphors are:\n1.  **Structural Metaphors:** These are metaphors where one concept is comprehensively structured in terms of another. For example, the metaphor ARGUMENT IS WAR structures our understanding of arguments with concepts like attacking positions, defending points, winning, and losing.\n2.  **Orientational Metaphors:** These metaphors organize concepts spatially, often based on our physical experience (e.g., up-down, in-out, front-back). For example, HAPPY IS UP (\"I'm feeling up\") and SAD IS DOWN (\"He's in low spirits\").\n3.  **Ontological Metaphors:** These are metaphors in which we understand abstract experiences, emotions, and ideas as if they were concrete entities, substances, or containers. The primary function is to allow us to refer to, quantify, and reason about abstract concepts. For instance, treating inflation as an entity in \"Inflation is backing us into a corner.\"\n\n**Step 4: Analyze \"my love for humanity\" against these types.**\n*   The phrase primarily treats \"love\" as a discrete entity or object. This is the defining characteristic of an **ontological metaphor**. It allows us to talk about love as a \"thing.\"\n*   However, \"ontological metaphor\" is not one of the answer choices. We must select the best fit from the given options.\n*   Let's re-examine the choices:\n    *   A. **Conceptual metaphor:** This is the overarching category, not a specific type. It is too general.\n    *   B. **Physical metaphor:** This is not a standard term in the Lakoff-Johnson framework.\n    *   C. **Orientational metaphor:** The phrase does not use spatial orientation like up/down or in/out. So, this is incorrect.\n    *   D. **Structural metaphor:** A structural metaphor uses the structure of one concept to structure another. In this case, the concept of a **PHYSICAL OBJECT** is used to structure our understanding of **LOVE**. The structure of an object includes properties like being possessable, quantifiable, and directable. The phrase \"my love for humanity\" applies this structure (possession and direction) to the abstract concept of love. Therefore, it fits the definition of a structural metaphor. Many ontological metaphors also function as simple structural metaphors.\n    *   E. **Intentional metaphor:** This is not a standard term in the Lakoff-Johnson framework.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude by selecting the best fit.**\nWhile the metaphor has strong ontological features (treating love as an entity), it also imposes the structure of an object onto the concept of love. Since \"ontological metaphor\" is not an option, and the metaphor clearly involves structuring one concept (love) in terms of another (an object), **structural metaphor** is the most appropriate and specific choice among the given answers.\n\n<<<D>>>"
