    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Genus and its Native Range:** The question asks for the common name of the genus *Perdita*, described by Smith in 1853. The native range for this large genus of bees is North and Central America, with the highest diversity in the desert regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.\n\n2.  **Determine the Currently Used Common Name:** A search of entomological resources, including university extension websites (e.g., UC Riverside), conservation groups (e.g., The Xerces Society), and popular field guides (e.g., \"The Bees in Your Backyard\"), consistently reveals that the most common and accepted name for bees of the genus *Perdita* is **\"fairy bees\"**. This name is a reference to their extremely small size and often pale or iridescent, delicate appearance.\n\n3.  **Investigate the Origin and Year the Name was Coined:** The next step is to find out who first used the term \"fairy bees\" in a published work and in what year. This requires looking into historical entomological and natural history literature. The name is widely attributed to the noted entomologist and pioneering insect photographer **Edward S. Ross**. He is credited with coining this descriptive term in his book **\"Insects Close Up: A Pictorial Guide for the Photographer and Collector,\"** which was published in **1953**. This book helped popularize the study and appreciation of insects, and the name \"fairy bees\" has been used for *Perdita* ever since.\n\n4.  **Format the Final Answer:** The question requires the answer to be in the format \"<name>, <year>\". Based on the analysis above, the common name is \"Fairy bees\" and the year it was coined is 1953.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is important to distinguish between scientific names (like *Perdita*) and common names (like \"fairy bees\"). Common names can vary, but \"fairy bees\" is the most established for this genus.\n*   Verifying the source and year is crucial. The attribution to Edward S. Ross and his 1953 book \"Insects Close Up\" is a specific and verifiable historical point.\n*   The common name is indeed used within the bees' native range (North America).\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 1953>>>"
