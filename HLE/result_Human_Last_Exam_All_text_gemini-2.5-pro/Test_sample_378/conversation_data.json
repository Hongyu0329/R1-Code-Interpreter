    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the core elements of the question:** The question asks for a specific year when an individual, named \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan,\" publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe.\"\n\n2.  **Verify the name of the individual:** The person in question is clearly Goodluck Jonathan, the former President of Nigeria. The first careful point is to verify his full, official name. His widely known and official name is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**.\n\n3.  **Check for the name \"Azikiwe\":** A thorough review of biographical data, official records, and news archives is necessary. The name \"Azikiwe\" is not part of Goodluck Jonathan's registered or commonly used name. His middle name is Ebele. The name \"Azikiwe\" is famously associated with Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria, who is a different person from a different ethnic group.\n\n4.  **Investigate the claim:** The next step is to investigate the central claim of the question: that Goodluck Jonathan at some point \"publicly identified himself as Azikiwe.\" This would involve searching for any public speeches, interviews, official declarations, or news reports where he might have made such a statement or adopted the name.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the evidence:** After a comprehensive search of public records and reputable news sources, there is no evidence or credible report of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself by the name \"Azikiwe\" or adding it to his own name.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on the premise:** The premise of the question is based on incorrect information. The event described—Goodluck Jonathan publicly identifying as Azikiwe—never occurred. Therefore, it is impossible to assign a year to an event that did not happen.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the question contains a factual error. Goodluck Jonathan's name does not include \"Azikiwe,\" and there are no records of him ever claiming it. Consequently, there is no year in which this event took place.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. The name \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his official name, and the event described in the question did not occur.>>>"
