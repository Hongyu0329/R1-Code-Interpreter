    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the functions**\nFirst, let's write down the definition of each function explicitly.\n*   F₀(x) = x\n*   F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n*   F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n*   F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Integrand**\nThe question asks to evaluate the definite integral of `F₃'(x) / F₃(x)`.\nLet's analyze the form of this integrand. We can notice that it is the result of differentiating `ln(F₃(x))` using the chain rule.\nLet `G(x) = ln(F₃(x))`.\nUsing the chain rule, the derivative of G(x) is:\n`G'(x) = d/dx [ln(F₃(x))] = (1 / F₃(x)) * F₃'(x) = F₃'(x) / F₃(x)`\nThis is exactly the expression we need to integrate.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Integral**\nThe integral we need to solve is:\n`V = ∫₀¹ (F₃'(x) / F₃(x)) dx`\nSince the integrand `F₃'(x) / F₃(x)` is the derivative of `ln(F₃(x))`, the integral can be solved using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n`V = [ln(F₃(x))]` from 0 to 1.\n`V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\n\n**Careful Point:** We should use `ln|F₃(x)|`, but first, let's check the sign of `F₃(x)` on the interval [0, 1].\n*   For x in [0, 1], `sin(x)` is non-negative (from `sin(0)=0` to `sin(1)≈0.84`).\n*   Therefore, `e^(sin(x))` is always greater than or equal to `e⁰ = 1`.\n*   This means `1 + e^(sin(x))` is always greater than or equal to 2.\n*   So, `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` is always greater than or equal to `ln(2)`.\nSince `F₃(x)` is always positive on the interval [0, 1], we can safely omit the absolute value bars.\n\nUsing the property of logarithms, `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we can simplify the expression for V:\n`V = ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0))`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate F₃(0) and F₃(1)**\nNow, we need to calculate the values of `F₃(x)` at the limits of integration, x=0 and x=1.\n*   **For x = 0:**\n    `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n*   **For x = 1:**\n    `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n**Step 5: Substitute and find the value of V**\nNow, substitute these values back into the expression for V:\n`V = ln( [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)] )`\n\n**Step 6: Numerical Calculation**\nWe need to find the numerical value of V and then calculate `10000 * V`.\n*   Use a calculator to find the values (note that '1' is in radians).\n*   `sin(1)` ≈ 0.84147098\n*   `e^(sin(1))` ≈ `e^0.84147098` ≈ 2.32011692\n*   `1 + e^(sin(1))` ≈ 3.32011692\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` ≈ `ln(3.32011692)` ≈ 1.20000001\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(2)` ≈ 0.69314718\n*   Now calculate the ratio `F₃(1) / F₃(0)`:\n    `F₃(1) / F₃(0)` ≈ 1.20000001 / 0.69314718 ≈ 1.73127412\n*   Finally, calculate V:\n    `V = ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0))` ≈ `ln(1.73127412)` ≈ 0.54883448\n\n**Step 7: Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n`10000 * V` ≈ `10000 * 0.54883448` = 5488.3448\nThe closest integer to 5488.3448 is 5488."
