    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the partition function Z for the given system.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Grand Canonical Partition Function\n\nThe grand canonical partition function, denoted by Z (or sometimes Ξ), describes a system that can exchange both energy and particles with a reservoir at a fixed temperature T and chemical potential μ. It is defined as the trace (Tr) of the density operator `exp[-β(H^ - μN^)]`, where:\n*   `β = 1 / (k_B T)` is the inverse temperature.\n*   `H^` is the Hamiltonian operator of the system.\n*   `N^` is the particle number operator.\n*   `μ` is the chemical potential.\n\nThe general formula is:\n`Z = Tr[exp(-β(H^ - μN^))]`\n\n### Step 2: Substitute the Specific Hamiltonian\n\nThe problem provides a specific Hamiltonian:\n`H^ = -μN^`\n\nWe substitute this into the general formula for Z:\n`H^ - μN^ = (-μN^) - μN^ = -2μN^`\n\nSo, the partition function for this particular system becomes:\n`Z = Tr[exp(-β(-2μN^))] = Tr[exp(2βμN^)]`\n\n### Step 3: Path Integral Formulation\n\nThe question requires using the path integral formalism. The path integral is a method to compute the trace. For a quantum field theory, the grand canonical partition function is expressed as a functional integral over all possible field configurations `ψ(x, τ)` and their complex conjugates `ψ*(x, τ)`:\n\n`Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] exp(-S[ψ*, ψ])`\n\nThe term `S[ψ*, ψ]` is the Euclidean action. The action is determined by the operator in the exponent of the partition function. For a general operator `K^`, the action for `Tr[exp(-βK^)]` is given by:\n\n`S = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x ψ*(x, τ) [∂_τ + K_op] ψ(x, τ)`\n\nwhere `K_op` is the single-particle operator corresponding to `K^`. In our case, the operator in the exponent is `K^ = H^ - μN^ = -2μN^`. The number operator in second quantization is `N^ = ∫ d^d x ψ*(x, τ)ψ(x, τ)`. Therefore, the single-particle operator `K_op` is simply the constant `-2μ`.\n\nSubstituting this into the action gives:\n`S = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x ψ*(x, τ) [∂_τ - 2μ] ψ(x, τ)`\n\nSo, the path integral expression for the partition function is:\n`Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] exp( - ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x ψ*(x, τ)[∂_τ - 2μ]ψ(x, τ) )`\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Path Integral (Conceptual)\n\nThis path integral is a Gaussian integral over the fields. To evaluate it, one typically transforms to Fourier space (momentum and Matsubara frequencies). The integral then separates into a product of integrals over each mode. The result of this integration is a functional determinant of the operator `(∂_τ - 2μ)`.\n\n*   For **Fermions**, the integral over Grassmann fields yields `Z_F = det(∂_τ - 2μ)`.\n*   For **Bosons**, the integral over complex fields yields `Z_B = [det(∂_τ - 2μ)]^(-1)`.\n\nThe evaluation of these determinants involves summing over all Matsubara frequencies, which is a standard but technical procedure. The result of this calculation must match the result from the more direct operator-based calculation, as the formalisms are equivalent. We will perform the operator-based calculation as it is more transparent.\n\n### Step 5: Direct Evaluation using the Operator Trace\n\nTo evaluate `Z = Tr[exp(2βμN^)]` directly, we compute the trace in the basis of particle number eigenstates `|N>`, where `N` is the number of particles. An eigenstate of `N^` is also an eigenstate of `exp(2βμN^)`.\n\n`exp(2βμN^) |N> = exp(2βμN) |N>`\n\nThe trace is the sum over all possible particle numbers `N`, weighted by the degeneracy `g(N)` of the state with `N` particles. Let's assume the system has `M` available single-particle states (e.g., momentum modes).\n\n`Z = ∑_{N=0}^∞ g(N) <N|exp(2βμN^)|N> = ∑_{N=0}^∞ g(N) exp(2βμN)`\n\nThe degeneracy `g(N)` depends on the statistics of the particles.\n\n**Case A: Fermions**\nDue to the Pauli exclusion principle, each of the `M` states can be either empty or occupied by one particle. The number of ways to place `N` identical fermions into `M` states is given by the binomial coefficient `C(M, N) = M! / (N!(M-N)!)`. The sum for `N` goes from 0 to `M`.\n\n`Z_F = ∑_{N=0}^M C(M, N) [exp(2βμ)]^N`\n\nThis is the binomial expansion of `(1 + x)^M` with `x = exp(2βμ)`.\n`Z_F = (1 + exp(2βμ))^M`\n\n**Case B: Bosons**\nFor bosons, any number of particles can occupy any of the `M` states. The number of ways to place `N` identical bosons into `M` states is `g(N) = C(N+M-1, N)`.\n\n`Z_B = ∑_{N=0}^∞ C(N+M-1, N) [exp(2βμ)]^N`\n\nThis is the negative binomial series for `(1 - x)^(-M)` with `x = exp(2βμ)`. For the sum to converge, we require `|x| < 1`, which means `exp(2βμ) < 1`, so `μ` must be negative.\n`Z_B = (1 - exp(2βμ))^(-M) = 1 / (1 - exp(2βμ))^M`\n\n### Step 6: Final Answer\n\nThe partition function `Z` depends on the statistics of the particles in the system. Assuming the system has `M` available single-particle modes:\n\n*   For a system of **Fermions**:\n    `Z_F = (1 + exp(2βμ))^M`\n\n*   For a system of **Bosons** (assuming `μ < 0` for convergence):\n    `Z_B = (1 - exp(2βμ))^(-M)`\n\nThese results can be combined using `ζ = -1` for fermions and `ζ = +1` for bosons:\n`Z = (1 - ζ exp(2βμ))^(-ζM)`\n\n<<<For a system of fermions with M modes, Z = (1 + exp(2*β*μ))^M. For a system of bosons with M modes, Z = (1 - exp(2*β*μ))^(-M).>>>"
