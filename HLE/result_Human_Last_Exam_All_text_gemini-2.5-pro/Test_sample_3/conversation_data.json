    "Answering this question requires knowledge of the classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nThe goal is to find the largest possible size (order) of the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve $E$ defined over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, with the condition that this subgroup must be non-cyclic. The torsion subgroup, denoted $E(K)_{tors}$, consists of all points of finite order on the curve whose coordinates lie in the field $K$.\n\n### Step 2: Recall the Structure of Torsion Subgroups\nFor any number field $K$, the torsion subgroup $E(K)_{tors}$ is a finite abelian group. By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, it must be isomorphic to a product of at most two cyclic groups:\n$E(K)_{tors} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n_1\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n_2\\mathbb{Z}$\nfor some positive integers $n_1$ and $n_2$ where $n_1$ divides $n_2$.\nA group of this form is non-cyclic if and only if $n_1 > 1$.\n\n### Step 3: Consult the Classification Theorem for Quadratic Fields\nThe possible structures for torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, have been completely classified through the work of Kamienny, Kenku, Momose, and others. We need to identify all possible non-cyclic groups that can occur when $D=-3$.\n\nThe possible torsion groups fall into two categories:\n1.  Groups that can occur over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. An elliptic curve defined over $\\mathbb{Q}$ can be viewed as a curve over any quadratic field $K$, and its rational torsion points remain torsion points over $K$.\n2.  Groups that can only occur over certain specific quadratic fields.\n\n### Step 4: List the Possible Non-Cyclic Torsion Groups for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$\n\n**Category 1: Groups that occur over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\nAccording to Mazur's Torsion Theorem, the non-cyclic torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nSince any elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}$ can be considered as an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, these groups are all possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n**Category 2: Groups specific to certain quadratic fields**\nThe full classification shows that there are additional non-cyclic torsion structures possible over quadratic fields that cannot occur over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is special because it is the field of Eisenstein integers and contains the non-trivial cube roots of unity. The classification shows that the following non-cyclic groups occur exclusively over $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nOther non-cyclic groups, such as $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$, occur over other specific quadratic fields (like $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$) but not over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Orders and Find the Maximum\nNow we list all the possible non-cyclic torsion groups for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ and calculate their orders:\n*   From Category 1:\n    *   Order of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    *   Order of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ is $2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n    *   Order of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ is $2 \\times 6 = 12$.\n    *   Order of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ is $2 \\times 8 = 16$.\n*   From Category 2 (specific to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$):\n    *   Order of $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n    *   Order of $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ is $3 \\times 6 = 18$.\n    *   Order of $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n### Step 6: Final Answer\nComparing all the possible orders for non-cyclic torsion subgroups (4, 8, 12, 16, 9, 18, 36), the largest value is 36. This order is achieved by a torsion subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, which is known to occur for certain elliptic curves defined over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
