    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Anatomical Feature and Species:** The question asks about a specific feature, the \"lacrimal recess,\" on a specific dinosaur, *Irritator challengeri*. The lacrimal is a skull bone situated in front of the eye socket (orbit). The lacrimal recess is a depression (or fossa) on the outer surface of this bone.\n\n2.  **Locate the Primary Scientific Source:** To answer a detailed anatomical question like this, we must refer to the primary scientific literature that describes the fossil. The holotype (the original specimen upon which the species is based) of *Irritator challengeri* is SMNS 58022. The foundational paper describing this skull is:\n    *   Sues, H. D., Frey, E., Martill, D. M., & Scott, D. M. (2002). *Irritator challengeri*, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil. *Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology*, 22(3), 535-547.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Description of the Lacrimal Bone:** The question is not about the lacrimal recess itself (which is one large depression), but about the number of depressions it *contains*. We need to find the part of the paper that describes the details within this recess.\n\n4.  **Extract the Key Information from the Source:** In the Sues et al. (2002) paper, the section on the lacrimal bone provides the specific detail needed. The authors state:\n    > \"The lateral surface of the ventral ramus of the lacrimal is deeply excavated by a large, subtriangular depression, the lacrimal recess... This recess is, in turn, excavated by **two** large pneumatic foramina.\"\n\n5.  **Interpret the Anatomical Terms:**\n    *   **Depression:** A general term for an indentation or sunken area on a bone. The lacrimal recess is a large depression.\n    *   **Foramen (plural: foramina):** An opening or hole, usually in a bone. Foramina are often located within larger depressions (fossae). In this context, the pneumatic foramina are openings for air sacs, and they are described as being *within* the lacrimal recess. Therefore, they qualify as depressions contained by the recess.\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** The primary scientific description explicitly states that the main depression, the lacrimal recess, contains two smaller features described as \"large pneumatic foramina.\" These foramina are the depressions within the recess.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Wording of the Question:** It is crucial to distinguish between the lacrimal recess itself (which is one large depression) and the number of smaller depressions it *contains*. The question specifically asks what the recess *contains*.\n*   **Source Reliability:** The answer relies on the accuracy of the original scientific description of the holotype specimen. This is the most reliable source of information available. Subsequent reviews have confirmed this observation.\n*   **Anatomical Terminology:** Understanding that a foramen is a type of opening often situated within a depression is key to correctly interpreting the scientific text.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the answer from the established scientific record.\n\n<<<2>>>"
