Based on structural and functional studies of the interaction between alpha-1 and beta subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels, the specific hotspot residues in the **human beta-1 subunit (CACNB1, UniProt Q02641)** for interacting with and modulating the **human alpha-1E subunit (Cav2.3)** are as follows:

**1) Hotspots for Interaction with alpha-1 subunit (Physical Binding):**

These residues are located in the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain and form the hydrophobic binding pocket (BID) that directly contacts the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit.

*   **Hydrophobic Pocket Residues:**
    *   Leucine 354 (L354)
    *   Valine 402 (V402)
    *   Isoleucine 404 (I404)
    *   Isoleucine 426 (I426)
    *   Valine 477 (V477)
    *   Isoleucine 481 (I481)
*   **Critical Aromatic Residues:**
    *   Tyrosine 356 (Y356)
    *   Tryptophan 395 (W395)
*   **Electrostatic Interaction Residues:**
    *   Aspartic Acid 408 (D408)
    *   Aspartic Acid 483 (D483)

**2) Hotspots for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties (Gating Modulation):**

These residues and regions are involved in the allosteric modulation of the alpha-1 subunit's function after the initial binding has occurred.

*   **N-Terminal Residues:**
    *   **Cysteine 3 (C3) and Cysteine 4 (C4):** These are critical hotspots for palmitoylation, a modification that tethers the N-terminus to the membrane and is essential for modulating channel inactivation and voltage-dependence.
*   **SH3 Domain (approx. residues 234-297):** While specific single residues are less defined as "hotspots" than in the binding pocket, the structural integrity of this entire domain is a functional hotspot. It interacts with other regions of the alpha-1 subunit to modulate inactivation kinetics.
