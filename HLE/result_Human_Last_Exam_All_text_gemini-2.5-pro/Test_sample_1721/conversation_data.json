    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest number $c$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe are looking for the maximum possible density $c$ of a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$ such that the sumset $A+A = \\{a_1 + a_2 \\mid a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ contains no perfect squares. The size of the set $A$ is given by $|A| = (c + o(1))N$, which means we want to maximize the ratio $|A|/N$ as $N \\to \\infty$.\n\n**2. A Constructive Approach using Modular Arithmetic**\n\nA powerful method to construct such sets is to use modular arithmetic. Let's choose an integer modulus $q \\ge 2$. We can define our set $A$ as the collection of all numbers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ that belong to a specific set of residue classes $R \\subseteq \\{0, 1, \\dots, q-1\\}$.\nSo, $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\pmod q \\in R\\}$.\nFor such a set, the density is $|A|/N \\approx |R|/q$.\n\nThe condition is that for any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, their sum $a_1+a_2$ is not a perfect square.\nIf we pick $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, then $a_1 \\equiv r_1 \\pmod q$ and $a_2 \\equiv r_2 \\pmod q$ for some $r_1, r_2 \\in R$.\nTheir sum is $a_1+a_2 \\equiv r_1+r_2 \\pmod q$.\nLet $S_q = \\{k^2 \\pmod q \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ be the set of quadratic residues modulo $q$.\nIf we can find a set of residues $R$ such that the sumset $R+R = \\{r_1+r_2 \\pmod q \\mid r_1, r_2 \\in R\\}$ has no elements in common with $S_q$, i.e., $(R+R) \\cap S_q = \\emptyset$, then we have a valid construction.\nThis is because if $a_1+a_2 = m^2$ for some integer $m$, then $a_1+a_2 \\equiv m^2 \\pmod q$, which means $a_1+a_2 \\pmod q$ would be in $S_q$. But our condition on $R$ forbids this.\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a modulus $q$ and a set $R \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_q$ that maximizes the ratio $|R|/q$ subject to the condition $(R+R) \\cap S_q = \\emptyset$.\n\n**3. Searching for the Optimal Modulus and Residue Set**\n\nLet's test some small values for the modulus $q$.\n\n*   **Case q = 2:** The quadratic residues are $S_2 = \\{0^2, 1^2\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$. We need $R+R$ to be disjoint from $\\{0,1\\}$. No non-empty set $R$ works. If $R=\\{0\\}$, $R+R=\\{0\\}$, which intersects $S_2$. If $R=\\{1\\}$, $R+R=\\{0\\}$, which intersects $S_2$.\n\n*   **Case q = 3:** The quadratic residues are $S_3 = \\{0^2, 1^2, 2^2\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$. The non-residues are $\\{2\\}$. We need $R+R \\subseteq \\{2\\}$.\n    If we choose $R = \\{1\\}$, then $R+R = \\{1+1\\} = \\{2\\}$. This works.\n    $|R|=1$. The density is $c = |R|/q = 1/3$.\n    Let's check if we can make $R$ larger. If we add any other element $r'$ to $R$, say $r'=0$, then $0+0=0 \\in S_3$. If $r'=2$, then $1+2=3\\equiv 0 \\in S_3$. So $R=\\{1\\}$ is the largest possible set.\n    This gives us a candidate set $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$. For this set, $|A| \\approx N/3$. Any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$ have a sum $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 1+1=2 \\pmod 3$. However, no perfect square can be congruent to $2 \\pmod 3$ (as $k^2 \\equiv 0$ or $1 \\pmod 3$).\n    This construction shows that $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n*   **Case q = 4:** The quadratic residues are $S_4 = \\{0^2, 1^2, 2^2, 3^2\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$. The non-residues are $\\{2, 3\\}$. We need $R+R \\subseteq \\{2, 3\\}$.\n    If $r \\in R$, then $2r = r+r$ must be in $\\{2,3\\}$. $2r \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$ implies $r=1$ or $r=3$. $2r \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ has no integer solution. So $R$ must be a subset of $\\{1, 3\\}$.\n    If we try $R=\\{1, 3\\}$, then $1+3=4 \\equiv 0 \\in S_4$. So this is not allowed.\n    The largest possible set is $R=\\{1\\}$ (or $R=\\{3\\}$), giving $|R|=1$. The density is $c = 1/4$, which is less than $1/3$.\n\n*   **Case q = 5:** $S_5 = \\{0, 1, 4\\}$. Non-residues are $\\{2, 3\\}$. We need $R+R \\subseteq \\{2, 3\\}$.\n    If $r \\in R$, $2r \\in \\{2, 3\\}$. $2r \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5 \\implies r=1$. $2r \\equiv 3 \\pmod 5 \\implies r=4$.\n    So $R \\subseteq \\{1, 4\\}$. If we take $R=\\{1, 4\\}$, $1+4=5 \\equiv 0 \\in S_5$. Not allowed.\n    The largest possible $R$ has size 1, giving density $1/5$.\n\n*   **General Prime Modulus p:** For a prime $p>3$, by the Cauchy-Davenport theorem, $|R+R| \\ge \\min(p, 2|R|-1)$. We need $R+R$ to be a subset of the quadratic non-residues, of which there are $(p-1)/2$. So we must have $2|R|-1 \\le (p-1)/2$, which implies $|R| \\le (p+1)/4$. The density is $|R|/p \\le (p+1)/(4p)$, which approaches $1/4$ for large $p$. For $p=5$, this gives $|R| \\le 1.5$, so $|R|=1$. For $p=11$, $|R| \\le 3$. The maximum density we get from prime moduli is $1/3$ (from $p=3$).\n\n*   **Composite Moduli (multiple of 3):** Let's consider $q=9$. $S_9 = \\{0, 1, 4, 7\\}$. Let's try $R = \\{1, 4, 7\\}$.\n    $R+R = \\{1+1, 1+4, 1+7, 4+4, 4+7, 7+7\\} \\pmod 9 = \\{2, 5, 8, 8, 2, 5\\} = \\{2, 5, 8\\}$.\n    Since $\\{2, 5, 8\\} \\cap S_9 = \\emptyset$, this works. $|R|=3$, so the density is $3/9=1/3$.\n    This seems to suggest that $1/3$ is the best we can do.\n\n**4. The Upper Bound**\n\nThe construction with $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$ shows that a density of $c=1/3$ is achievable. Proving that it is not possible to have a density greater than $1/3$ is a more difficult task and is a known result in combinatorial number theory. This result was established by J.P. Massias in 1977. The proof uses advanced techniques from analytic number theory (the Hardy-Littlewood circle method).\n\nThe argument can be outlined as follows: one assumes a set $A$ has density greater than $1/3$ and then shows that the number of pairs $(a_1, a_2) \\in A \\times A$ such that $a_1+a_2$ is a square must be positive. The analysis focuses on the distribution of elements of $A$ in residue classes modulo 3. A density greater than $1/3$ forces a significant non-uniformity in these residue classes, which in turn guarantees a square in the sumset.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\n1.  We have constructed a set $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$ with $|A| \\approx N/3$.\n2.  The sumset $A+A$ for this set contains no squares because any sum is congruent to $2 \\pmod 3$, but no square is congruent to $2 \\pmod 3$.\n3.  This establishes that the largest density $c$ is at least $1/3$.\n4.  Further investigation into other moduli and constructions does not yield a higher density.\n5.  Advanced results confirm that $1/3$ is indeed the maximum possible density.\n\nTherefore, the largest number $c$ is $1/3$.\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
