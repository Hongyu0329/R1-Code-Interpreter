    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Geometry of an Icosahedron**\nAn icosahedron is a regular polyhedron, which means all its faces, edges, and angles are identical. It has the following properties:\n*   It is composed of 20 identical faces.\n*   Each face is an equilateral triangle.\n*   It has 30 edges and 12 vertices.\n*   It is highly symmetrical. A key property for this problem is that it has a center of symmetry (or inversion). This means for any point on the icosahedron, the point diametrically opposite through the center is also on the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Orientation and Filling Condition**\n*   **\"Standing on one of its faces\":** This means one of the 20 triangular faces is positioned horizontally, serving as the base of the tank. Because the icosahedron is a regular polyhedron, for any given face, there is another face on the opposite side that is perfectly parallel to it. So, the tank has a horizontal triangular base and a parallel horizontal triangular top.\n*   **\"Half-filled with water\":** This means the volume of the water is exactly 50% of the total volume of the icosahedron. Due to the central symmetry of the icosahedron, the horizontal plane that divides the volume exactly in half must pass through the geometric center of the icosahedron. The water surface will therefore be the shape of the cross-section of the icosahedron at its center, parallel to the base.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Shape of the Central Cross-Section**\nThe core of the problem is to identify the shape of the cross-section created by a plane that passes through the center of the icosahedron and is parallel to one of its faces.\n\n*   **Symmetry Axis:** The line passing through the centers of the bottom and top faces is a vertical axis. The icosahedron has 3-fold rotational symmetry around this axis. If you rotate the tank by 120° (or 240°) around this axis, it looks identical.\n*   **Intersecting Edges, Not Vertices:** Let's consider the arrangement of the 12 vertices relative to the horizontal base. They are arranged in layers. For an icosahedron resting on a face, the vertices are grouped into four layers of three vertices each. The central plane (the water surface) lies exactly halfway between the two middle layers. Because the plane lies *between* layers of vertices, it does not pass through any vertex. Instead, it must cut through the edges that connect these two middle layers of vertices.\n*   **Counting the Edges:** Let's call the two middle layers of vertices Layer 2 and Layer 3. Each of the 3 vertices in Layer 2 is connected to 2 vertices in Layer 3. This gives a total of 3 × 2 = 6 edges connecting Layer 2 to Layer 3. The cutting plane must therefore intersect these 6 edges.\n*   **Forming the Polygon:** The intersection of the plane with these 6 edges creates 6 points (vertices) in that plane. Connecting these points in order forms a polygon with 6 sides, which is a hexagon.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Type of Hexagon**\nNow we must determine if this hexagon has any special properties (e.g., is it regular?). We can again use the symmetry of the icosahedron.\n\n*   The shape of the water surface (the hexagon) must have the same symmetries as the icosahedron itself, relative to the cutting plane and the central axis.\n*   **3-Fold Rotational Symmetry:** As established, the icosahedron has 3-fold rotational symmetry about the vertical axis. This means that if we rotate the water surface by 120°, it must look the same. This implies that the hexagon's sides come in three identical pairs, and its angles also come in three identical pairs.\n*   **Central Symmetry:** The plane passes through the center of symmetry of the icosahedron. This means for every vertex of the hexagon, the diametrically opposite point is also a vertex of the hexagon. This property forces all opposite sides to be parallel and equal in length.\n*   **Conclusion on Regularity:** A hexagon that possesses both 3-fold rotational symmetry and central symmetry must be a **regular hexagon**. All its sides will be of equal length, and all its internal angles will be equal (120°).\n\nTherefore, the shape of the water surface is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
