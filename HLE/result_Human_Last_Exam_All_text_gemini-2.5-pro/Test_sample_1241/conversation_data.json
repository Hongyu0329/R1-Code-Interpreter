    "This problem asks for the sum of steady-state probabilities $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$ for a given continuous-time Markov chain described by a system of Kolmogorov-Chapman equations.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** We need to find the limiting probabilities $P_i = \\lim_{t \\to +\\infty} P_i(t)$ for $i=0, 1, 2, 3$. In the steady state, the probabilities are constant, which means their time derivatives are zero: $P_i'(t) = 0$. The question asks for the value of $P_0 + P_1$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Steady-State Equations:** By setting all derivatives to zero, we convert the system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n    $$\n    P_{0}'(t) = 0 \\implies -\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1} = 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    P_{1}'(t) = 0 \\implies \\lambda_{01}P_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1} + \\lambda_{21}P_{2} + \\lambda_{31}P_{3} = 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    P_{2}'(t) = 0 \\implies \\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_{2} = 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    P_{3}'(t) = 0 \\implies \\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3} = 0\n    $$\n    Additionally, the probabilities must sum to one:\n    $$\n    P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1\n    $$\n\n3.  **Substitute the Given Rate Constants:**\n    *   $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$\n    *   $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$\n    *   $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$\n    *   $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$\n    *   $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$\n    *   $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\n    The system of equations becomes:\n    (I)   $-0.019 P_0 + 0.65 P_1 = 0$\n    (II)  $0.019 P_0 - (0.65 + 0.4)P_1 + 0.392 P_2 + 0.008 P_3 = 0$\n    (III) $0.4 P_1 - (0.392 + 0.008)P_2 = 0$\n    (IV)  $0.008 P_2 - 0.008 P_3 = 0$\n    (V)   $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n\n4.  **Solve the System of Linear Equations:** We can solve this system by expressing $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in terms of $P_1$.\n    *   From equation (IV):\n        $0.008 P_2 = 0.008 P_3 \\implies P_3 = P_2$.\n    *   From equation (III):\n        $0.4 P_1 - (0.4)P_2 = 0 \\implies 0.4 P_1 = 0.4 P_2 \\implies P_2 = P_1$.\n        Combining these, we get $P_1 = P_2 = P_3$.\n    *   From equation (I):\n        $0.019 P_0 = 0.65 P_1 \\implies P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1$.\n\n5.  **Use the Normalization Condition:** Substitute the expressions for $P_0, P_2, P_3$ into equation (V).\n    $$\n    \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1\\right) + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right) P_1 = 1\n    $$\n    To solve for $P_1$:\n    $$\n    \\left(\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}\\right) P_1 = 1\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\left(\\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019}\\right) P_1 = 1\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\left(\\frac{0.707}{0.019}\\right) P_1 = 1 \\implies P_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}\n    $$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Required Sum:** Now we find $P_0$ and then the sum $P_0 + P_1$.\n    *   $P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\left(\\frac{0.019}{0.707}\\right) = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$.\n    *   $P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    $$\n    P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768...\n    $$\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Typo in the Problem Statement:** The second differential equation in the problem description, $P_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$, has a typo. For a valid Markov process, the sum of probabilities must be conserved ($P_0+P_1+P_2+P_3=1$), which implies the sum of their derivatives must be zero. The given system leads to $(P_0+P_1+P_2+P_3)' = -2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t) \\neq 0$. The correct term for flow from state 0 to state 1 is $+\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$. The analysis above uses the corrected, standard form of the Kolmogorov equations. Without this correction, the problem has no physically meaningful steady-state solution.\n*   **System of Equations:** The steady-state equations (I)-(IV) are linearly dependent. Any one of them can be derived from the other three. This is why the normalization condition (V) is essential to find a unique solution.\n*   **Numerical Accuracy:** To avoid rounding errors, calculations were kept in fractional form ($0.019/0.707$) until the final step.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nFollowing the steps outlined above:\n1.  The system is identified as a steady-state probability problem.\n2.  The steady-state equations are formulated by setting derivatives to zero.\n3.  Solving the system yields relations between probabilities: $P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}P_1$ and $P_1 = P_2 = P_3$.\n4.  The normalization condition $P_0+P_1+P_2+P_3=1$ is used to find the individual probabilities.\n5.  We found $P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$ and $P_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$.\n6.  The required sum is $P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$.\n7.  The final numerical value is $\\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768$.\n\n<<<0.94625177>>>"
