    "An analysis of the question step by step is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definition of GCRD**\n\nThe Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices, P1(s) and P2(s), is a polynomial matrix G(s) that satisfies two conditions:\n1.  G(s) is a **common right divisor**: There exist polynomial matrices Q1(s) and Q2(s) such that P1(s) = Q1(s)G(s) and P2(s) = Q2(s)G(s).\n2.  G(s) is the **\"greatest\"**: For any other common right divisor D(s), there exists a polynomial matrix L(s) such that G(s) = L(s)D(s).\n\nThe GCRD is unique up to left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a non-zero constant determinant).\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method to Find the GCRD**\n\nA standard method to find the GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s) is to use an extension of the Euclidean algorithm. This involves performing elementary row operations on the composite matrix formed by stacking P1(s) on top of P2(s).\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n1.  Form the composite matrix M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)].\n2.  Perform elementary row operations (which corresponds to left-multiplying by a unimodular matrix U(s)) to transform M(s) into a simpler form, specifically an upper-triangular or row-echelon form. The goal is to obtain a matrix of the form [G(s); 0], where 0 is a zero matrix.\n3.  The resulting non-zero matrix block, G(s), is a GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s).\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Method to the Given Matrices**\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s;\n      -s^2 - 1, s^2]\n\nP2 = [s, 0;\n      -s - 1, 1]\n\nFirst, we form the composite matrix M(s):\nM(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)] =\n[s^2 + s, -s   ;  (Row 1)\n-s^2 - 1, s^2  ;  (Row 2)\n s,       0    ;  (Row 3)\n-s - 1,  1    ]  (Row 4)\n\n**Careful Point:** Look for simple elements to start the reduction. The '1' in the last row (Row 4, column 2) is an excellent pivot to simplify other rows. We will use it to eliminate the entries in the second column of the other rows.\n\n**Step 4: Perform Elementary Row Operations**\n\n1.  **Eliminate the element in Row 1, Column 2:**\n    Perform the operation: `Row 1 -> Row 1 + s * Row 4`.\n    New Row 1 = `[s^2 + s, -s] + s * [-s - 1, 1]`\n    = `[s^2 + s + s(-s - 1), -s + s(1)]`\n    = `[s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s]`\n    = `[0, 0]`\n\n2.  **Eliminate the element in Row 2, Column 2:**\n    Perform the operation: `Row 2 -> Row 2 - s^2 * Row 4`.\n    New Row 2 = `[-s^2 - 1, s^2] - s^2 * [-s - 1, 1]`\n    = `[-s^2 - 1 - s^2(-s - 1), s^2 - s^2(1)]`\n    = `[-s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, s^2 - s^2]`\n    = `[s^3 - 1, 0]`\n\nAfter these operations, the matrix M(s) is row-equivalent to:\nM'(s) =\n[0,       0    ;\n s^3 - 1, 0    ;  (Row 2')\n s,       0    ;  (Row 3)\n-s - 1,  1    ]  (Row 4)\n\nWe now have one zero row. The GCRD is determined by the remaining three non-zero rows. Let's call them:\nr_a = [s^3 - 1, 0]\nr_b = [s, 0]\nr_c = [-s - 1, 1]\n\n**Step 5: Further Reduction**\n\n**Careful Point:** Rows `r_a` and `r_b` only have entries in the first column. We can simplify them using the Euclidean algorithm on the polynomials `s^3 - 1` and `s`.\n`gcd(s^3 - 1, s)`:\n`s^3 - 1 = (s^2) * (s) - 1`\nThis gives `1 = (s^2) * s - (s^3 - 1)`.\n\nThis algebraic identity tells us we can create a row with '1' in the first column. The corresponding row operation is `(s^2) * r_b - 1 * r_a`:\nNew Row `r_d` = `s^2 * [s, 0] - [s^3 - 1, 0]` = `[s^3 - (s^3 - 1), 0]` = `[1, 0]`.\n\nSo, the row space spanned by {`r_a`, `r_b`, `r_c`} is the same as the one spanned by {`r_d`, `r_b`, `r_c`}, which is:\n{[1, 0], [s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]}\n\nNow, we use the very simple row `r_d = [1, 0]` to eliminate the other rows.\n1.  **Eliminate `r_b`:**\n    `Row b -> Row b - s * r_d`\n    `[s, 0] - s * [1, 0] = [s - s, 0] = [0, 0]`\n\n2.  **Simplify `r_c`:**\n    `Row c -> Row c + (s + 1) * r_d`\n    `[-s - 1, 1] + (s + 1) * [1, 0]`\n    `[(-s - 1) + (s + 1), 1 + 0] = [0, 1]`\n\nThe set of non-zero rows that forms a basis for the row space of M(s) is now {[1, 0], [0, 1]}.\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer**\n\nThe elementary row operations have reduced the original set of rows to the basis {[1, 0], [0, 1]}. The GCRD can be formed by taking these basis vectors as its rows.\n\nG(s) = [1, 0;\n        0, 1]\n\nThis is the 2x2 identity matrix, I. A GCRD of I indicates that the original matrices P1 and P2 are **right coprime**.\n\nFinal check: Two polynomial matrices are right coprime if and only if the composite matrix [P1; P2] has full column rank for all complex values of s.\ndet(P2) = s*1 - 0*(-s-1) = s. Since det(P2) is not zero for s ≠ 0, P2 has rank 2, and thus M(s) has rank 2 for s ≠ 0.\nAt s=0, M(0) = [0, 0; -1, 0; 0, 0; -1, 1]. The second and fourth rows are [-1, 0] and [-1, 1], which are linearly independent. So, rank(M(0)) = 2.\nSince the rank is 2 for all s, the matrices are right coprime, and their GCRD is the identity matrix (or any other unimodular matrix). The identity matrix is the standard representation.\n\n<<<[1, 0; 0, 1]>>>"
