    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character in Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film \"Solaris\". The identifying detail is a unique emotional expression: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This isn't just simple nostalgia; it's a more complex feeling of shame associated with that longing.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Characters and Their Motivations**\nLet's review the psychological profiles of the characters provided in the answer choices in the context of the film's themes of memory, humanity, and alienation.\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist. He is deeply consumed by his personal grief and memories of his dead wife, Hari. His connection to Earth is profound, especially to his father's dacha surrounded by nature. While he certainly misses Earth, his primary emotional focus is on Hari and his guilt. He is more likely to be the recipient of philosophical observations than the one who makes them.\n*   **B. Hari:** She is a \"visitor,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memories. She has no genuine experience of Earth herself. Her entire existence is confined to the station and her relationship with Kris. Therefore, she could not miss a sound she has never truly heard.\n*   **C. Snaut:** A cyberneticist who has been on the station for a long time. He has become cynical, weary, and highly philosophical. He often acts as a commentator on the human condition and the futility of their mission. He delivers several key monologues that explore why humanity seeks out the cosmos. This kind of complex, self-reflective statement fits his character perfectly.\n*   **D. Sartorius:** A cold, detached scientist. He is focused on studying the Solaris phenomenon with scientific rigor and is dismissive of the emotional and psychological turmoil it causes. He sees the \"visitors\" as objects of study. Expressing a poetic and vulnerable feeling like shame over missing rustling leaves would be highly out of character for him.\n*   **E. Gibarian:** Kris's friend who commits suicide before Kris arrives. We see him only in a disturbing video recording he left for Kris. In the video, he is desperate and frantic, warning Kris about the station's reality. His state of mind is one of immediate terror, not wistful, philosophical reflection.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Scene and Dialogue**\nBased on the character analysis, Snaut is the most likely candidate. The specific line of dialogue occurs during a conversation between Kris and Snaut. Snaut delivers a monologue about humanity's true purpose for space exploration, arguing that humans aren't looking for new worlds but for a \"mirror.\" He reflects on how long they have been away from Earth and how detached they have become. He says (with slight variations depending on the translation):\n\n\"We've been here too long. We've forgotten everything. And when we do remember something about Earth, it's the wrong thing. We're ashamed of it... We're ashamed to be so... happy. Ashamed of something... like the rustling of leaves.\"\n\nThis quote directly links the character of Snaut to the feeling of shame associated with remembering the simple, natural beauty of Earth, like the rustling of leaves.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Source Material:** The question specifies the 1972 Tarkovsky film. The dialogue and character emphasis are different from the original Stanislaw Lem novel and the 2002 Soderbergh film adaptation. The analysis must be based solely on Tarkovsky's version.\n2.  **Speaker vs. Listener:** Kris is the main character and the one whose longing for Earth frames the film, but it is Snaut who articulates this specific philosophical point *to* Kris. It's important to identify who spoke the line, not just who might have felt the emotion.\n3.  **The Specific Emotion:** The key is the word \"ashamed.\" Many characters might miss Earth, but only one expresses this particular, complex reaction to that nostalgia.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe character who expresses shame at missing the sound of rustling leaves is the station's cyberneticist, Snaut.\n\n<<<C>>>"
