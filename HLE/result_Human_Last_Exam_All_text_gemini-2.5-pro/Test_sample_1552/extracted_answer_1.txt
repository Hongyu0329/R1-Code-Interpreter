The second coefficient, denoted $a_1(x, D^2)$, is given by the formula:
$a_1(x, D^2) = \frac{5}{12}R(x) \cdot I + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}(x)$
where $R(x)$ is the scalar curvature, $I$ is the identity operator on the fiber, $\sigma^{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{2}[\gamma^\mu, \gamma^\nu]$ are the Lorentz generators in the spinor representation, and $F_{\mu\nu}(x)$ is the gauge field strength tensor.
