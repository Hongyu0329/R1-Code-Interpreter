    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the system of differential equations and the domain of interest.**\nThe given system is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\nWe are interested in the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points of the system.**\nEquilibrium points occur when $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\nFirst, solve $u'(t) = 0$:\n$u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$\nThis gives us two possible values for $u$: $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\nNow, substitute these values into the equation for $d'(t)=0$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0^3(1-0) = 0$\n    $2d^2 = 0 \\implies d = 0$\n    So, one equilibrium point is **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n    $2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, two more equilibrium points are **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the region $u \\geq 0$ are (0, 0), (0, 1), and (-1, 1).\n\n**Step 3: Classify the equilibrium points.**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix of the system. Let $f(d, u) = d'$ and $g(d, u) = u'$.\n$f(d, u) = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^4 - u^3$\n$g(d, u) = u^3 - u^2$\n\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial d} = 4d + 5u^2 - 3u$\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} = (10u - 3)d + 4u^3 - 3u^2$\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial d} = 0$\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} = 3u^2 - 2u$\n\nThe Jacobian matrix is:\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d + 5u^2 - 3u & (10u - 3)d + 4u^3 - 3u^2 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow evaluate the Jacobian at each non-zero equilibrium point:\n*   **At (0, 1):**\n    $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) & (10(1) - 3)(0) + 4(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both are positive, **(0, 1) is an unstable node (a source)**.\n\n*   **At (-1, 1):**\n    $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) & (10(1) - 3)(-1) + 4(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -4+5-3 & -7+4-3 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since they have opposite signs, **(-1, 1) is a saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):** The Jacobian is the zero matrix, so linearization fails. This is a non-hyperbolic point.\n\n**Step 4: Find the separatrix.**\nA separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different qualitative behaviors. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are separatrices. We are looking for the invariant curve(s) that pass through the saddle point (-1, 1).\n\nInstead of solving the complex differential equation for the trajectories, let's test for a simple invariant curve, for instance a polynomial relationship between $d$ and $u$, of the form $d = p(u)$. Given the powers of $u$ in the original equation, a good guess is a quadratic polynomial $d = au^2 + bu$.\nIf $d(t) = au(t)^2 + bu(t)$, then by the chain rule:\n$d'(t) = (2au(t) + b)u'(t) = (2au+b)(u^3 - u^2) = 2au^4 + (b-2a)u^3 - bu^2$.\n\nNow, substitute $d = au^2+bu$ into the original equation for $d'$:\n$d'(t) = 2(au^2+bu)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(au^2+bu) - u^3(1-u)$\n$d'(t) = 2(a^2u^4 + 2abu^3 + b^2u^2) + (5au^4 + 5bu^3 - 3au^3 - 3bu^2) + u^4 - u^3$\n$d'(t) = (2a^2 + 5a + 1)u^4 + (4ab + 5b - 3a - 1)u^3 + (2b^2 - 3b)u^2$\n\nEquating the two expressions for $d'(t)$, we match the coefficients of the powers of $u$:\n1.  **Coefficient of $u^2$**: $-b = 2b^2 - 3b \\implies 2b^2 - 2b = 0 \\implies 2b(b-1)=0$. So, $b=0$ or $b=1$.\n2.  **Coefficient of $u^4$**: $2a = 2a^2 + 5a + 1 \\implies 2a^2 + 3a + 1 = 0 \\implies (2a+1)(a+1)=0$. So, $a=-1$ or $a=-1/2$.\n3.  **Coefficient of $u^3$**: $b-2a = 4ab + 5b - 3a - 1 \\implies a(1-4b) - 4b + 1 = 0$.\n\nWe test the possible pairs of $(a, b)$:\n*   If $b=0$, the third equation becomes $a(1) - 0 + 1 = 0 \\implies a = -1$. This is one of the possible values for $a$. So, $(a, b) = (-1, 0)$ is a valid solution. This corresponds to the curve $d = -u^2$.\n*   If $b=1$, the third equation becomes $a(1-4) - 4 + 1 = 0 \\implies -3a - 3 = 0 \\implies a = -1$. This is also a possible value for $a$. So, $(a, b) = (-1, 1)$ is another valid solution. This corresponds to the curve $d = -u^2 + u$.\n\n**Step 5: Identify which invariant curve is the separatrix.**\nWe have found two invariant curves:\n1.  $d = -u^2$\n2.  $d = u - u^2$\n\nThe separatrix must pass through the saddle point (-1, 1). Let's check which curve satisfies this condition:\n1.  For $d = -u^2$: If $u=1$, then $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. The curve passes through (-1, 1).\n2.  For $d = u - u^2$: If $u=1$, then $d = 1 - (1)^2 = 0$. The curve passes through (0, 1), which is the source, not the saddle.\n\nTherefore, the curve $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold of the saddle point (-1, 1). An invariant manifold of a saddle point is a separatrix.\n\nThe equation of the separatrix is $d = -u^2$."
