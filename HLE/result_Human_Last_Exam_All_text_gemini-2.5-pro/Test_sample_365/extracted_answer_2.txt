The product is the ketone formed from the anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement of the starting material. It is a complex tricyclic ketone with the molecular formula C₂₀H₃₄O₄Si. The original bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene ring is expanded, the alcohol at C2 is converted to a ketone, and the double bond in the norbornene core is shifted. The silyl ether and ketal protecting groups remain intact.
