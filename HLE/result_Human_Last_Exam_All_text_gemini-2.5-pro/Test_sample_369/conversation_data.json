    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n**Step 1: Initial Vowel and Syllable Analysis**\nFirst, we identify the basic quantities of the vowels and the syllables.\n*   `vērum`: The 'e' is long by nature.\n*   `ubĭ`: Both vowels are short.\n*   `equī`: This is the genitive singular of `equus`, so the final 'i' is long.\n*   `atquĕ`: The 'e' is short.\n*   `hŏmĭnis`: All vowels are short.\n*   `cāsū`: The 'a' and 'u' are both long by nature (ablative of cause).\n*   `convĕnit`: This is the present tense form; all its vowels are short.\n*   `ĭmāgō`: The initial 'i' is short, the 'a' is long, and the final 'o' is long.\n\n**Step 2: Elisions**\nWe identify where a word ending in a vowel (or -m) is followed by a word beginning with a vowel (or h-). These syllables are typically elided (merged or dropped).\n1.  `vērum ubi`: The `-um` of `verum` elides with the `u-` of `ubi`. The line is read as `vēr'ubi`.\n2.  `atque hominis`: The `-e` of `atque` elides with the `ho-` of `hominis` (h is ignored for scansion). The line is read as `atqu'hominis`.\n\n**Step 3: Scanning Foot by Foot**\n\n*   **Foot 1:** `vērum ubi`\n    *   With elision, this becomes `vē-ru-bi`.\n    *   `vē-` is long by nature (-).\n    *   `-ru-` is short (u).\n    *   `-bi` is short (u).\n    *   The foot is long-short-short (- u u), which is a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n*   **Foot 2:** `equī atque`\n    *   The line begins with `equī`, which syllabifies as `e-quī` (short-long, u -). A foot cannot begin with a short syllable. This points to an uncommon scansion technique. Here, **synizesis** (or synaeresis) occurs, where the two vowels of `equī` are compressed into a single long syllable: `(equī)-`.\n    *   The next syllable is `at-` from `atque`. The 'a' is followed by two consonants ('t' and 'qu'), so it is long by position (-).\n    *   The foot is long-long (- -), which is a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Foot 3:** `hominis` (preceded by the elided `-que` of `atque`)\n    *   We syllabify `hominis` for meter. To create long syllables, we group consonants: `hom-in-is`.\n    *   `hom-`: The 'o' is followed by 'm' and 'n' (from `-in-`), making it long by position (-).\n    *   `in-`: The 'i' is followed by 'n' and 's', making it long by position (-).\n    *   The foot is `hom-in-`, which is long-long (- -), a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Foot 4:** `-is cāsū`\n    *   The remaining syllable from `hominis` is `-is`. This 'i' is followed by 's' and the 'c' of `casu`, making it long by position (-).\n    *   The first syllable of `cāsū` is `cā-`, which is long by nature (-).\n    *   The foot is `-is cā-`, which is long-long (- -), a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Foot 5:** `-sū convenit`\n    *   The remaining syllable from `cāsū` is `-sū`, which is long by nature (-).\n    *   The first syllable of `convenit` is `con-`, which is short (u).\n    *   The second syllable of `convenit` is `ve-`, which is short (u).\n    *   The foot is `-sū con-ve-`, which is long-short-short (- u u), a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n*   **Foot 6:** `-nit imāgō`\n    *   We are left with `-nit imāgō`. The final foot must be a spondee.\n    *   The syllable `-nit` has a short 'i'. The next word, `imago`, begins with a vowel. This would normally leave `-nit` as a short syllable.\n    *   To resolve this, another poetic device is used: the initial `i-` of `imago` is treated as a consonant (`j-`), scanning the word as `jmāgō`.\n    *   Now, the syllable `-nit` is followed by two consonants ('t' and 'j'), making it long by position (-).\n    *   The first syllable of `jmāgō` is `jmā-`, which contains the naturally long 'a', making it long (-).\n    *   The foot is `-nit jmā-`, which is long-long (- -), a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Vowel Quantities:** Knowing which vowels are long or short by nature is crucial (e.g., `vērum`, `cāsū`, `imāgō`).\n2.  **Elision:** Correctly identifying and applying elision is the first step (`vērum ubi`, `atque hominis`).\n3.  **Position:** A vowel followed by two consonants is long by position, even across word boundaries (e.g., `-is cā-`).\n4.  **Special Scansions:** This line requires recognizing two less common devices:\n    *   **Synizesis:** Compressing two vowel sounds into one syllable (`equī` -> `-`).\n    *   **Consonantal 'i'**: Treating an initial 'i' as a 'j' sound (`imago` -> `jmago`) to resolve the meter.\n\n**Final Scansion:**\nCombining the analysis of all six feet gives us the pattern: Dactyl - Spondee - Spondee - Spondee - Dactyl - Spondee.\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
