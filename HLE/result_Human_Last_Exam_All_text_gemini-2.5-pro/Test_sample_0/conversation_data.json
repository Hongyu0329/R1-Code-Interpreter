    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Critical-Level Views\n\nCritical-level views are a family of population axiologies used to evaluate the goodness of a population. The value of a population is calculated by summing the welfare of all individuals, but only after subtracting a \"critical level\" of welfare (`c`).\n\n*   **Value Formula:** Value = Σ (uᵢ - c), where uᵢ is the welfare of individual `i` and `c` is the critical level.\n*   **Key Feature:** The critical level `c` is typically a positive value (c > 0). This means that a life is only considered a positive contribution to the total value if its welfare is *above* the critical level.\n    *   If a person's welfare `u` is greater than `c` (u > c), their existence adds positive value to the population.\n    *   If a person's welfare `u` is equal to `c` (u = c), their existence adds zero value.\n    *   If a person's welfare `u` is less than `c` but still positive (0 < u < c), their life is \"worth living\" for them, but their existence makes the population worse from an axiological standpoint (it adds negative value).\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Conditions of Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem\n\nArrhenius's theorem states that it's impossible for any population axiology to simultaneously satisfy a set of six plausible conditions. Let's analyze the five conditions given in the answer choices.\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** This principle applies when comparing two populations of the *same size*. If population A is better than population B in every respect (higher total welfare, higher average welfare, better-off worst-off person, more equal distribution), then A is better than B. Critical-level views satisfy this. If total welfare in A is higher than in B, and the size (N) is the same, then (Total Welfare A - N*c) > (Total Welfare B - N*c).\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** This is a complex condition that prevents a \"utility monster\" scenario in fixed-size populations by placing a limit on how much one person must gain to compensate for another's loss. As a simple additive theory in fixed-population cases, critical-level views satisfy this.\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** This principle states that for *any* life worth living (i.e., any positive welfare level `w > 0`), there is some number of people living at that level that is better than any population of a fixed number of people with very high welfare. It essentially claims that \"quantity can outweigh quality\" and that no level of life worth living is so low that it can be completely devalued in favor of elite lives.\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** This principle states that adding a group of people with positive welfare is always better than adding a group of people with negative welfare. Critical-level views satisfy this because for any positive welfare `u_pos` and negative welfare `u_neg`, it holds that `u_pos > u_neg`, and therefore `(u_pos - c) > (u_neg - c)`.\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** This principle states that for any population, there is *some* number of people with positive welfare that, when added, makes the resulting population better. Critical-level views satisfy this because one can always choose to add people whose welfare `u` is above the critical level `c`. Since `u > c`, the contribution `(u - c)` is positive, making the new population better.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Violated Condition\n\nNow, let's see which condition is violated by critical-level views. The point of conflict arises from how critical-level views treat lives that are worth living but are below the critical level.\n\nLet's test **Non-Elitism (C)**.\n1.  **Non-Elitism's claim:** For *any* positive welfare level `w > 0`, a large enough population of people at level `w` can be better than a smaller population of people at a very high welfare level `W`.\n2.  **Critical-Level View's calculation:** Let the critical level be `c > 0`.\n3.  **The Test Case:** Choose a welfare level `w` that is positive but *below* the critical level. So, `0 < w < c`. This represents a life that is worth living.\n4.  **Value of these lives:** According to the critical-level view, the value contribution of each person at level `w` is `(w - c)`. Since `w < c`, this value is negative. Adding more such people makes the total value of the population *more negative*.\n5.  **Value of elite lives:** Now consider a population of people with very high welfare `W`, where `W > c`. The value contribution of each of these people is `(W - c)`, which is a large positive number.\n6.  **The Conflict:** Non-Elitism requires that there be some number `n` of lives at level `w` that is better than a population of `m` lives at level `W`. However, for the critical-level view, the `n`-person population has a large negative value (`n * (w-c)`), while the `m`-person population has a positive value (`m * (W-c)`). A negative value can never be better than a positive one.\n\nTherefore, critical-level views fail to satisfy the Non-Elitism condition. They create a class of \"sub-par\" but still worth-living lives that are treated as being axiologically bad, violating the spirit of Non-Elitism which gives value to any positive life.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that critical-level views satisfy all the listed conditions except for Non-Elitism. The violation occurs because critical-level views can assign a negative aggregate value to a large population of people whose lives are worth living but fall below the positive critical level, making it impossible for such a population to be considered better than a population of elites.\n\n<<<C>>>"
