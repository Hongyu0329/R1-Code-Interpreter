    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Attacker:** The question specifies an \"arbitrarily powerful quantum computer.\" This is a theoretical adversary that has a large, fault-tolerant quantum computer. We must consider the most effective known quantum algorithms against symmetric ciphers.\n\n2.  **Differentiate Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Cryptography:**\n    *   **Asymmetric Cryptography (e.g., RSA, ECC):** These are broken by Shor's algorithm, which can solve the underlying mathematical problems (integer factorization and discrete logarithm) in polynomial time. This means current key sizes (like RSA-2048) are completely insecure against a sufficiently powerful quantum computer.\n    *   **Symmetric Cryptography (e.g., AES):** These are not based on the same mathematical problems as asymmetric ciphers. There is no known quantum algorithm that can \"break\" the structure of a cipher like AES in the way Shor's algorithm breaks RSA.\n\n3.  **Identify the Primary Attack on Symmetric Keys:** The most generic and powerful attack against a symmetric key (without exploiting a specific flaw in the cipher's design) is a brute-force search, where the attacker tries every possible key.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Impact of Quantum Computing on Brute-Force Attacks:**\n    *   **Classical Brute-Force:** For a key of length *n*, a classical computer would need to test, on average, half of the 2^n possible keys. The computational effort is on the order of O(2^n). This means an AES-128 key has a 128-bit security level.\n    *   **Quantum Brute-Force (Grover's Algorithm):** A quantum computer can use Grover's search algorithm to perform a brute-force attack much more efficiently. For a keyspace of size N (where N = 2^n for an n-bit key), Grover's algorithm can find the correct key in approximately O(√N) operations.\n    *   **Calculating the Effect:** The effort for a quantum attack on an n-bit key is O(√(2^n)) = O(2^(n/2)). This means that a quantum computer effectively halves the security level (in bits) of a symmetric key.\n\n5.  **Determine the Required Post-Quantum Security Level:**\n    *   The current industry standard for strong, long-term security against classical computers is a 128-bit security level (e.g., AES-128). This means an attack would require roughly 2^128 operations, which is considered computationally infeasible.\n    *   To be considered \"secure\" in a post-quantum world, a cipher should provide at least this same 128-bit security level against a quantum attacker.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Minimum Key Length:**\n    *   Let the required symmetric key length be *k*.\n    *   The security level against a quantum attack using Grover's algorithm will be *k/2*.\n    *   We want this quantum security level to be at least 128 bits.\n    *   So, we set up the equation: `k/2 ≥ 128`\n    *   Solving for *k*, we get: `k ≥ 256`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** To achieve a 128-bit security level against an attack from a powerful quantum computer, a symmetric key must be at least 256 bits long. An AES-128 key, for example, would only provide 128/2 = 64 bits of security, which is considered breakable. An AES-256 key would provide 256/2 = 128 bits of security, meeting the required benchmark.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   This analysis assumes the only threat is a brute-force key search using Grover's algorithm. It doesn't account for other potential quantum attacks on the specific structure of a cipher, although none are currently known to be effective against ciphers like AES.\n*   The question asks for the minimum length (\"at least\"). While 512 bits would also be secure (providing a 256-bit security level), 256 bits is the minimum required to meet the 128-bit security benchmark.\n*   The term \"arbitrarily powerful\" implies we should not consider the practical engineering challenges of building such a computer, but rather the theoretical limits of security.\n\nBased on this analysis, a 256-bit symmetric key is the minimum length required to provide 128-bit security against a quantum computer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
