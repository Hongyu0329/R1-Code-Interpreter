    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:**\n    *   **Game:** 100BB rake-free cash game. \"Rake-free\" is a key detail. In a standard game with rake, the house takes a small percentage of each pot. The absence of rake means we don't have to overcome this \"cost of playing,\" so our opening range can be slightly wider and more profitable. 100BB is a standard stack depth, so typical GTO (Game Theory Optimal) strategies apply.\n    *   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the most powerful position in poker. We are guaranteed to act last on every post-flop street (flop, turn, river). This positional advantage is immense, as we get to see what our opponents do before we have to act, allowing us to make more informed and profitable decisions. Because of this, we play the widest range of hands from the button.\n    *   **Action:** Open to 2.5x. This is a standard opening raise size.\n    *   **Question:** We need to find the \"worst suited jack\" that is still a standard open-raise in this situation. This means it's a hand that is profitable to open, but it's at the very bottom of the suited jack category in terms of Expected Value (EV).\n\n2.  **Principles of Hand Valuation:**\n    *   Hands are valued based on a combination of factors:\n        *   **High Card Strength:** Hands with Aces, Kings, Queens, and Jacks are strong because they can make strong top pairs.\n        *   **Suitedness:** Suited hands can make flushes, which are very powerful. They also realize their equity better than offsuit hands because they can flop flush draws, which allow for aggressive semi-bluffing.\n        *   **Connectivity:** Hands with cards close in rank (e.g., JTs, 87s) can make straights. The closer the cards, the higher the straight potential.\n\n3.  **Ranking Suited Jacks (Jxs):**\n    *   Let's rank the suited jack hands based on the principles above. All of them share the \"Jack\" and \"suitedness,\" so the primary difference is the value of the kicker (the second card).\n    *   **Best:** JTs is the best suited Jack. It has the highest kicker and the best connectivity, allowing it to make the strongest straights (e.g., Broadway).\n    *   **Next Best:** J9s and J8s are next. They are still highly connected and can make strong straights and flushes.\n    *   **Weakest:** As the kicker gets lower (J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s), the hand's overall value decreases.\n        *   **Kicker Problems:** When you make a pair of Jacks with J2s, you are highly vulnerable to being out-kicked by any other hand containing a Jack (like AJ, KJ, QJ, J9, etc.) that your opponent might play.\n        *   **Lack of Connectivity:** A hand like J2s has almost zero straight potential. The '2' does not connect with the Jack in any meaningful way. While J5s can technically make a \"wheel\" straight (A-2-3-4-5), the Jack doesn't participate. The straight value of a hand primarily comes from when both cards work together.\n\n4.  **Applying GTO Strategy:**\n    *   Given the immense advantage of playing from the button in a rake-free game, GTO strategy dictates opening a very wide range, often around 45-50% of all possible hands.\n    *   This opening range is so wide that it includes **all** suited Jack combinations, from JTs all the way down to J2s.\n    *   Even though J2s is weak in absolute terms, the combination of being suited (potential for flushes and flush draws) and being in the best position (the button) makes it a profitable hand to open-raise. You can win the blinds preflop, or you can out-play your opponents post-flop due to your positional advantage.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Since a standard opening range from the button includes all suited Jacks (J2s+), the \"worst\" one that you should still open is the one with the lowest rank and lowest Expected Value.\n    *   Based on our ranking in Step 3, the hand with the lowest kicker and least connectivity is J2s. Therefore, it is the worst suited jack that is still considered a standard open from the button.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{J2s}$."
