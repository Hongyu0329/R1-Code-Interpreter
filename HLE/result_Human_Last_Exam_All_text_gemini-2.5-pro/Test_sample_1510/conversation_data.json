    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Wallpaper Groups:** These are the 17 possible repeating patterns that can tile a two-dimensional plane. They are formally known as the 2D plane crystallographic groups. Each group is a set of isometries (translations, rotations, reflections, glide reflections) that describes the symmetry of a pattern.\n*   **Point Group:** For any wallpaper group, its associated point group is the set of rotational and reflectional symmetries that leave at least one point fixed. To find the point group, one essentially ignores the translational components of the symmetries. For example, a glide reflection (translation + reflection) in the wallpaper group becomes a simple reflection in the point group.\n*   **Order of a Group:** The order of a group is the number of elements (i.e., symmetry operations) it contains.\n\nThe question asks for the number of wallpaper groups whose point group has exactly two elements (order 2).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the 2D Crystallographic Point Groups of Order 2\n\nThere are 10 possible point groups for the 17 wallpaper groups. We need to find which of these have an order of 2.\n\nThe 10 2D crystallographic point groups are (using Hermann-Mauguin notation):\n1.  **1** (or C₁): Contains only the identity operation. Order = 1.\n2.  **2** (or C₂): Contains the identity and a 180° rotation. **Order = 2**.\n3.  **m** (or Cₛ): Contains the identity and a reflection. **Order = 2**.\n4.  **3** (or C₃): Contains identity and rotations by 120° and 240°. Order = 3.\n5.  **4** (or C₄): Contains identity and rotations by 90°, 180°, 270°. Order = 4.\n6.  **2mm** (or D₂): Contains identity, a 180° rotation, and two perpendicular reflections. Order = 4.\n7.  **6** (or C₆): Contains rotations of 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300° and identity. Order = 6.\n8.  **3m** (or D₃): Symmetries of an equilateral triangle. Order = 6.\n9.  **4mm** (or D₄): Symmetries of a square. Order = 8.\n10. **6mm** (or D₆): Symmetries of a regular hexagon. Order = 12.\n\nFrom this list, the only point groups with an order of 2 are **2** and **m**.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Wallpaper Groups with Point Group '2' or 'm'\n\nNow we need to go through the 17 wallpaper groups and identify which ones have a point group of '2' or 'm'.\n\n**Wallpaper Groups with Point Group '2' (C₂):**\nA wallpaper group with this point group must contain 2-fold (180°) rotational symmetry but no reflection or glide reflection symmetries.\n*   **p2**: This group is defined by its 2-fold rotation centers. It has no reflectional symmetry. This is the only group that fits this description.\n\n**Wallpaper Groups with Point Group 'm' (Cₛ):**\nA wallpaper group with this point group must have reflectional symmetry but no rotational symmetry (other than the trivial 360° rotation).\n*   **A careful point:** A glide reflection in the wallpaper group is considered a simple reflection in the point group because the translational component is ignored.\n*   **pm**: This group has parallel lines of reflection. It has no rotational symmetry. Its point group is **m**.\n*   **pg**: This group has parallel lines of glide reflection. It has no rotational symmetry. Since the point group of a glide reflection is a reflection, its point group is **m**.\n*   **cm**: This group has both reflection lines and glide reflection lines, which are interlaced. It has no rotational symmetry. Its point group is **m**.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Resulting Wallpaper Groups\n\nBased on the analysis in Step 3, the wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 are:\n\n1.  **p2** (Point group '2')\n2.  **pm** (Point group 'm')\n3.  **pg** (Point group 'm')\n4.  **cm** (Point group 'm')\n\nCounting these groups, we find there are a total of 4.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is the number of groups identified in the last step.\n\n<<<4>>>"
