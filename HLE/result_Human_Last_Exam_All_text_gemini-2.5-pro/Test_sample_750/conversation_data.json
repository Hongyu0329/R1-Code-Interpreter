    "Answering the question step-by-step.\nThe equation to solve is $z \\cdot i = i^z$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the terms using standard complex forms.**\nLet $z = x + iy$ where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe left hand side (LHS) of the equation is:\n$z \\cdot i = (x+iy)i = xi + i^2y = xi - y = -y + ix$.\n\nThe right hand side (RHS) involves a complex exponentiation. The general definition is $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$, where $\\log a$ is the multi-valued complex logarithm.\nFor $a=i$, the logarithm is given by:\n$\\log i = \\ln|i| + i(\\arg(i) + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSince $|i|=1$ and the principal argument $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have:\n$\\log i = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\n\nLet's denote $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for simplicity. So, $\\log i = iC_k$.\nThe RHS is then:\n$i^z = e^{z \\log i} = e^{(x+iy)(iC_k)} = e^{ixC_k + i^2yC_k} = e^{-yC_k + ixC_k}$.\nUsing Euler's formula, $e^{a+ib} = e^a(\\cos b + i\\sin b)$, we get:\n$i^z = e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$.\n\n**Step 2: Equate the LHS and RHS and separate into real and imaginary parts.**\nEquating the expressions for the LHS and RHS:\n$-y + ix = e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$.\nFor this equality to hold, the real parts must be equal and the imaginary parts must be equal.\n(1) Real part: $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(xC_k)$\n(2) Imaginary part: $x = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(xC_k)$\nWe need to find all pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy this system of equations for some integer $k$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the system of equations for specific cases.**\n\n**Case A: Real solutions ($y=0$)**\nIf $y=0$, the system becomes:\n(1) $0 = e^{0}\\cos(xC_k) \\implies \\cos(xC_k) = 0$.\n(2) $x = e^{0}\\sin(xC_k) \\implies x = \\sin(xC_k)$.\n\nFrom (1), $\\cos(xC_k)=0$ implies that the argument $xC_k$ must be an odd multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$:\n$xC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi = \\pi(n+\\frac{1}{2})$ for some integer $n$.\n\nSubstitute this into (2):\n$x = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi)$.\nThe value of $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi)$ is $1$ if $n$ is even, and $-1$ if $n$ is odd.\n*   If $n$ is even, $x=1$. Let's check consistency.\n    From $xC_k = \\pi(n+\\frac{1}{2})$, with $x=1$, we get $C_k = \\pi(n+\\frac{1}{2})$.\n    $\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi = \\pi(n+\\frac{1}{2})$.\n    $\\frac{1}{2} + 2k = n+\\frac{1}{2} \\implies n=2k$. This is consistent, as $n$ must be even.\n    So, $z=x+iy = 1+i(0)=1$ is a solution. We can verify it in the original equation: $1 \\cdot i = i$ and $i^1=i$ (for the principal value branch $k=0$).\n*   If $n$ is odd, $x=-1$.\n    From $xC_k = \\pi(n+\\frac{1}{2})$, with $x=-1$, we get $-C_k = \\pi(n+\\frac{1}{2})$.\n    $-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = \\pi(n+\\frac{1}{2})$.\n    $-\\frac{1}{2} - 2k = n+\\frac{1}{2} \\implies n = -2k-1$. This is consistent, as $n$ must be odd.\n    So, $z=x+iy = -1+i(0)=-1$ is a solution. Verification: $(-1) \\cdot i = -i$ and $i^{-1} = \\frac{1}{i} = -i$ (for the principal value branch $k=0$).\n\nSo, we have found two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n\n**Case B: Purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$)**\nIf $x=0$, the system becomes:\n(1) $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(0) \\implies -y = e^{-yC_k}$.\n(2) $0 = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(0) \\implies 0 = 0$. This equation is always true and provides no constraint.\n\nWe only need to solve the equation $-y = e^{-yC_k}$ for $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n*   If $y>0$, the LHS $-y$ is negative, while the RHS $e^{-yC_k}$ is always positive. Thus, there are no solutions with $y>0$.\n*   If $y=0$, we get $0=1$, which is false. So $y \\ne 0$.\n*   If $y<0$, let $y=-a$ for $a>0$. The equation becomes:\n    $-(-a) = e^{-(-a)C_k} \\implies a = e^{aC_k}$.\n    We need to find positive solutions $a$ to this equation.\n    Let's analyze $f(a)=e^{aC_k}-a$. We seek roots of $f(a)=0$ for $a>0$.\n    *   If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi > 0$. In fact $C_k \\ge \\frac{\\pi}{2} > 1$. The function $h(a)=e^{aC_k}$ starts at $h(0)=1$ and its slope $h'(a)=C_ke^{aC_k}$ is always greater than 1 for $a>0$. The line $g(a)=a$ starts at $g(0)=0$ with slope 1. Thus, $h(a)>g(a)$ for all $a \\ge 0$. No solutions for $k \\ge 0$.\n    *   If $k \\le -1$, then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi < 0$. The function $h(a)=e^{aC_k}$ is a decreasing exponential function starting at $h(0)=1$ and tending to 0 as $a \\to \\infty$. The line $g(a)=a$ is an increasing function starting at $g(0)=0$. A sketch of the two functions shows they must intersect exactly once for some $a>0$.\n    Therefore, for each integer $k \\le -1$, there exists a unique positive real number $a_k$ such that $a_k = e^{a_k C_k}$. This gives a solution $y_k = -a_k$.\n    The corresponding solutions for $z$ are $z_k = iy_k = -ia_k$ for $k \\in \\{\\dots, -3, -2, -1\\}$.\n\n**Case C: General complex solutions ($x \\ne 0, y \\ne 0$)**\nTo show there are no other solutions, we can use a trick.\nFrom system (1)-(2), assuming $x\\ne0$ and $y\\ne0$, we can divide (2) by (1):\n$\\frac{x}{-y} = \\frac{e^{-yC_k}\\sin(xC_k)}{e^{-yC_k}\\cos(xC_k)} \\implies -\\frac{x}{y} = \\tan(xC_k)$. (This requires $\\cos(xC_k) \\ne 0$. If $\\cos(xC_k)=0$, then from (1) $y=0$, which is not this case).\n\nAlternatively, we can rewrite the original equation as $z=i^{z-1}$. Let $w=z-1=u+iv$, where $u=x-1$ and $v=y$. The equation is $w+1=i^w$.\n$(u+1)+iv = e^{iwC_k} = e^{-vC_k}(\\cos(uC_k)+i\\sin(uC_k))$.\nSeparating real and imaginary parts:\n(3) $u+1 = e^{-vC_k}\\cos(uC_k)$\n(4) $v = e^{-vC_k}\\sin(uC_k)$\nDividing (4) by (3) (assuming $x=u+1 \\ne 0$ and $\\cos(uC_k) \\ne 0$):\n$\\frac{v}{u+1} = \\tan(uC_k) \\implies \\frac{y}{x} = \\tan((x-1)C_k)$.\n\nNow we have two conditions for $x,y$:\n(A) $\\tan(xC_k) = -x/y$\n(B) $\\tan((x-1)C_k) = y/x$\n\nMultiplying these two equations gives:\n$\\tan(xC_k) \\cdot \\tan((x-1)C_k) = (-\\frac{x}{y}) \\cdot (\\frac{y}{x}) = -1$.\nLet $X = xC_k$. The equation becomes $\\tan(X) \\tan(X-C_k)=-1$.\n$\\tan(X) \\left(\\frac{\\tan(X)-\\tan(C_k)}{1+\\tan(X)\\tan(C_k)}\\right) = -1$.\n$\\tan^2(X) - \\tan(X)\\tan(C_k) = -1 - \\tan(X)\\tan(C_k)$.\n$\\tan^2(X) = -1$.\nSo, $\\tan(xC_k) = \\pm i$.\nSince $x$ and $C_k$ are real numbers, their product $xC_k$ is also a real number. The tangent of a real number is always real. Therefore, $\\tan(xC_k)$ cannot be equal to $\\pm i$.\nThis contradiction implies that there are no solutions in this general case where the divisions are valid. The cases where division is not valid ($y=0, x=0, \\cos(xC_k)=0, \\dots$) lead back to the real and purely imaginary solutions already found.\n\n**Conclusion: The complete set of solutions**\nThe solutions to the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ are:\n1.  Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  An infinite family of purely imaginary solutions: For each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique solution of the form $z_k = -ia_k$, where $a_k$ is the unique positive real number satisfying the equation $a = e^{a(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\n\nWe can write the full set of solutions as:\n$S = \\{1, -1\\} \\cup \\{ -ia_k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}, k \\le -1, \\text{ where } a_k \\text{ is the unique positive solution to } a = e^{a(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} \\}$.\n\n<<<The solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and an infinite set of purely imaginary numbers $z_k = -ia_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$, where $a_k$ is the unique positive real solution to the transcendental equation $a = \\exp\\left(a\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)\\right)$."
