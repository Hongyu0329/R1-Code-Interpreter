    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   To determine the degree of unsaturation (DoU), we compare it to the formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon, which is $C_nH_{2n+2}$.\n*   For n=7, a saturated hydrocarbon would be $C_7H_{16}$.\n*   The given formula has two fewer hydrogens than the saturated formula.\n*   DoU = (Number of H in saturated alkane - Number of H in compound) / 2 = (16 - 14) / 2 = 1.\n*   A DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the structure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\n*   The provided data is: $^{13}C$ NMR: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbon atoms. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in an overlapping signal.\n*   **Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities:** The multiplicity (s, d, t, q) comes from DEPT or off-resonance decoupling experiments and tells us the number of hydrogens attached to each carbon.\n    *   (s) = singlet = Quaternary carbon (C, 0 H)\n    *   (d) = doublet = Methine carbon (CH, 1 H)\n    *   (t) = triplet = Methylene carbon (CH2, 2 H)\n    *   (q) = quartet = Methyl carbon (CH3, 3 H)\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the Signals to Identify Structural Fragments**\n*   **145(s):** The chemical shift (100-150 ppm) is in the alkene region. The singlet (s) multiplicity indicates a quaternary carbon (no attached H). This is a C atom that is part of a C=C double bond. The high shift value (~145 ppm) is characteristic of a highly substituted (specifically, a tri- or tetra-substituted) alkene carbon.\n*   **112(t):** This chemical shift is also in the alkene region. The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates a CH2 group. This corresponds to a terminal alkene (=CH2).\n*   Combining these two signals, we can deduce the presence of a `>C=CH2` group. The 145 ppm signal is the quaternary carbon `>C=`, and the 112 ppm signal is the terminal `CH2`. The fact that the quaternary carbon is so downfield strongly suggests it is tetrasubstituted (bonded to four other carbons including the double bond), i.e., `R2C=CH2`.\n*   **48(t):** This is an aliphatic CH2 group.\n*   **27(d):** This is an aliphatic CH group.\n*   **22(q):** This is an aliphatic CH3 group.\n*   **21(q):** This is another aliphatic CH3 group.\n\n**Step 4: Reconcile the Atom Count and Identify the Symmetric Unit**\n*   Let's count the carbons and hydrogens based on the 6 signals:\n    *   Carbons: 1(s) + 1(t) + 1(t) + 1(d) + 1(q) + 1(q) = 6 carbons.\n    *   We are missing one carbon from the molecular formula (C7). This confirms that one signal represents two equivalent carbons.\n*   Let's check the hydrogen count possibilities to find the overlapping signal. The total must be 14.\n    *   If a `t` signal was for 2xCH2, H count = 0(s) + 2(t) + 2*2(t) + 1(d) + 3(q) + 3(q) = 13 H. (Incorrect)\n    *   If the `d` signal was for 2xCH, H count = 0(s) + 2(t) + 2(t) + 2*1(d) + 3(q) + 3(q) = 12 H. (Incorrect)\n    *   If one `q` signal was for 2xCH3, H count = 0(s) + 2(t) + 2(t) + 1(d) + 2*3(q) + 3(q) = 14 H. (Correct!)\n*   So, the molecule contains two equivalent methyl (CH3) groups. This points towards a structural feature like an isopropyl group `(-CH(CH3)2)` or a gem-dimethyl group `(-C(CH3)2R)`.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Structure**\n*   From our analysis, the building blocks of the molecule are:\n    *   One `>C=CH2` unit.\n    *   One aliphatic `-CH2-` group (from 48t).\n    *   One aliphatic `-CH-` group (from 27d).\n    *   One set of two equivalent `-CH3` groups (from one of the q signals).\n    *   One other `-CH3` group (from the other q signal).\n*   The most logical way to combine these pieces is to form an isopropyl group `(-CH(CH3)2)` from the `-CH-` group and the two equivalent `-CH3` groups. This would account for the 27(d) signal and one of the quartet signals.\n*   We can form an ethyl group `(-CH2CH3)` from the `-CH2-` group and the remaining `-CH3` group. This would account for the 48(t) signal and the other quartet signal.\n*   The remaining fragment is the `>C=CH2` unit. The only way to connect all the fragments to form a stable molecule is to attach both the ethyl group and the isopropyl group to the quaternary carbon `(>C=)`.\n*   The resulting structure is:\n         CH(CH3)2\n         |\n    CH2=C-CH2CH3\n\n**Step 6: Determine the IUPAC Name**\n*   To name the compound, we must find the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the double bond.\n    1.  Chain through the ethyl group: `CH2=C(-)-CH2-CH3`. This is a 4-carbon chain (a butene). The substituent at C2 would be an isopropyl group. The name would be 2-isopropyl-1-butene. This gives one substituent on the main chain.\n    2.  Chain through the isopropyl group: `CH2=C(-)-CH(CH3)-CH3`. This is also a 4-carbon chain (a butene). The substituents would be an ethyl group at C2 and a methyl group at C3. The name would be 2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene. This gives two substituents on the main chain.\n*   According to IUPAC rules, when two chains of equal length are possible, we choose the one with the greater number of substituents.\n*   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene**.\n\n**Step 7: Final Verification**\n*   **Structure:** 2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene.\n*   **Formula:** C7H14. Correct.\n*   **Symmetry:** The two methyl groups on the isopropyl substituent are chemically equivalent because there is no chiral center in the molecule. This leads to 6 total carbon signals. Correct.\n*   **Signals:**\n    *   =C< (C2): Quaternary, tetrasubstituted. Should be a singlet, far downfield. Matches 145(s).\n    *   =CH2 (C1): Terminal alkene. Should be a triplet. Matches 112(t).\n    *   -CH2- (ethyl): Aliphatic. Should be a triplet. Matches 48(t).\n    *   -CH- (isopropyl): Aliphatic. Should be a doublet. Matches 27(d).\n    *   -CH3 (isopropyl, x2): Aliphatic, equivalent. Should be a quartet. Matches one of the q signals (22q or 21q).\n    *   -CH3 (ethyl): Aliphatic. Should be a quartet. Matches the other q signal.\n*   All data points are consistent with the structure of 2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene.\n\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene>>>"
