    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the VC dimension.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Language and the Concept Class\n\nThe question asks for the VC dimension of a specific fragment of First-Order Logic, denoted as $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. Let's break down what this means.\n\n1.  **Schema `S`**: The schema consists of 4 unary predicates. Let's call them $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$. A unary predicate defines a property of a single element, which corresponds to a subset of the domain.\n\n2.  **Language $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}$**: This is a fragment of First-Order logic where the only allowed logical constructs are:\n    *   `∃`: The existential quantifier (\"there exists\").\n    *   `∧`: Conjunction (\"AND\").\n    *   `⊤`: The constant for \"True\".\n    *   `⊥`: The constant for \"False\".\n    *   Atomic formulas are of the form $P_i(v)$, where $v$ is a variable.\n\n3.  **Concept Class**: The VC dimension is a property of a *concept class*. In this context, a concept is a subset of the domain of a structure. Each formula $\\phi(x)$ with exactly one free variable `x` defines a concept, which is the set of all elements `a` in the domain for which $\\phi(a)$ is true. We need to understand what kinds of sets can be defined by such formulas.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of a formula $\\phi(x)$ in this language. Any such formula is equivalent to one in Prenex Normal Form, which for this logic will look like $\\exists y_1 \\exists y_2 \\dots \\exists y_k \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_k)$, where $\\psi$ is a quantifier-free formula. The quantifier-free part $\\psi$ can only be built from atomic formulas, `⊤`, and `⊥` using the conjunction `∧`. Therefore, $\\psi$ is simply a conjunction of atomic formulas.\n\nAn atomic formula involves a single variable since all predicates are unary. So, $\\psi$ looks like this:\n$\\psi = A_1 \\land A_2 \\land \\dots \\land A_m$, where each $A_j$ is of the form $P_i(v)$ for some $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ and some variable $v \\in \\{x, y_1, \\dots, y_k\\}$.\n\nWe can group the atomic formulas by the variable they contain:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_k \\left( \\left( \\bigwedge_{j \\in J_x} P_{i_j}(x) \\right) \\land \\left( \\bigwedge_{l=1}^k \\bigwedge_{j \\in J_l} P_{i_j}(y_l) \\right) \\right)$\n\nSince the part involving `x` does not depend on the quantified variables $y_l$, we can pull it out of the scope of the quantifiers:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\left( \\bigwedge_{j \\in J_x} P_{i_j}(x) \\right) \\land \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_k \\left( \\bigwedge_{l=1}^k \\bigwedge_{j \\in J_l} P_{i_j}(y_l) \\right)$\n\nLet's call the first part $M(x)$, which is a conjunction of predicates applied to `x` (a **monomial**). The second part is a sentence (a formula with no free variables), let's call it $B$. For any given structure (a domain and an interpretation of the predicates), the sentence $B$ is either true or false for the entire structure.\n*   If $B$ is false in the structure, then $\\phi(x) \\equiv M(x) \\land \\bot \\equiv \\bot$. This formula defines the empty set.\n*   If $B$ is true in the structure, then $\\phi(x) \\equiv M(x) \\land \\top \\equiv M(x)$. This formula defines the set of elements satisfying the monomial $M(x)$.\n\nThe language also explicitly includes the formulas `⊤` and `⊥`.\n*   `⊤` defines the entire domain (universe). This is equivalent to an empty conjunction (a monomial where the set of predicates is empty).\n*   `⊥` defines the empty set.\n\nTherefore, for any given structure, the set of all definable concepts is the collection of sets defined by all possible monomials over $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$, plus the empty set. A monomial corresponds to an intersection of the base predicates. So, the concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ is composed of sets of the form $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i$ for every $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, plus the empty set $\\emptyset$.\n\n### Step 2: Establish an Upper Bound for the VC Dimension\n\nThe VC dimension of a concept class is the size `d` of the largest set of points that can be **shattered** by the class. A set $X$ is shattered if for every subset $X' \\subseteq X$, there is a concept $C$ in the class such that $C \\cap X = X'$. This requires that the concept class can generate all $2^{|X|}$ subsets of $X$.\n\nOur concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ is generated by the 4 base predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$.\nThe concepts are of the form $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i$ for $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nThe number of possible choices for the index set $I$ is $2^4 = 16$.\nSo, there are at most 16 concepts that can be formed by such intersections.\nThe language also provides `⊥`, which defines the empty set.\nThus, for any given structure, the number of distinct concepts we can define is at most $16 + 1 = 17$.\n\nNow, let's see if we can shatter a set of 5 points, say $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$.\nTo shatter $X$, we would need to generate all $2^5 = 32$ of its subsets.\nHowever, our language can only define a maximum of 17 distinct concepts. Since $17 < 32$, it is impossible to generate all 32 required subsets.\nTherefore, no set of size 5 can be shattered. This implies that the VC dimension is strictly less than 5.\n**VCdim $\\le 4$**\n\n### Step 3: Establish a Lower Bound for the VC Dimension\n\nTo show that the VC dimension is at least 4, we must demonstrate that it is possible to shatter a set of 4 points. This requires us to construct a specific structure (a domain and interpretations for the predicates $P_i$) where a set of 4 points is shattered.\n\nLet the set to be shattered be $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$.\nLet the domain of our structure be $X$.\nWe define the interpretation of the four predicates on $X$ as follows:\n*   $P_1 = \\{x_2, x_3, x_4\\} = X \\setminus \\{x_1\\}$\n*   $P_2 = \\{x_1, x_3, x_4\\} = X \\setminus \\{x_2\\}$\n*   $P_3 = \\{x_1, x_2, x_4\\} = X \\setminus \\{x_3\\}$\n*   $P_4 = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\} = X \\setminus \\{x_4\\}$\n\nThe concepts are intersections of these sets, i.e., $C_I = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i$ for $I \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\}$.\nWe need to show that for any arbitrary subset $X' \\subseteq X$, we can find an index set $I$ such that $C_I = X'$.\n\nLet $X'$ be any subset of $X$. Let $I$ be the set of indices of the points *not* in $X'$. That is, $I = \\{i \\mid x_i \\notin X'\\}$.\nLet's compute the concept $C_I$ defined by this choice of $I$:\n$C_I = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} (X \\setminus \\{x_i\\})$\nUsing De Morgan's laws, this is equivalent to:\n$C_I = X \\setminus \\left(\\bigcup_{i \\in I} \\{x_i\\}\\right)$\nBy our definition of $I$, $\\bigcup_{i \\in I} \\{x_i\\}$ is exactly the set of points not in $X'$.\nSo, $C_I = X \\setminus (X \\setminus X') = X'$.\n\nSince we can form any subset $X' \\subseteq X$ using a concept from our class, the set $X$ of size 4 is shattered.\nThis proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n**VCdim $\\ge 4$**\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 2, we found that VCdim $\\le 4$.\nFrom Step 3, we found that VCdim $\\ge 4$.\nCombining these two results, we can conclude that the VC dimension is exactly 4."
