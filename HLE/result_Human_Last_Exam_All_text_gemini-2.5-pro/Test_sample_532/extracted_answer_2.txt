A finite group G is a filled nilpotent group if and only if its order is of the form `2^a * 3^b` for non-negative integers `a` and `b`, and at least one of the following two conditions holds:

1.  Its Sylow 3-subgroup, `P₃`, has exponent 3 (i.e., `g³ = e` for all `g ∈ P₃`).
2.  Its Sylow 2-subgroup, `P₂`, is a filled 2-group. A 2-group is filled if and only if it is one of the following:
    *   A cyclic group.
    *   A dihedral group of order at least 8.
    *   A generalized quaternion group of order at least 8.
    *   A group that contains a cyclic subgroup of index 2 which is not contained in its Frattini subgroup.
