    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the condition \"correct symmetry for optical activity\"**\n\n*   **Definition of Optical Activity:** Optical activity is the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light.\n*   **Symmetry Requirement:** For a crystal to exhibit optical activity, its structure must be **chiral**. A chiral structure is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image.\n*   **Symmetry Elements and Chirality:** In terms of crystallographic point groups, a crystal class is chiral if and only if it lacks any symmetry elements of the second kind (improper rotations). These include:\n    *   A center of inversion (also called a center of symmetry, denoted $\\bar{1}$).\n    *   A mirror plane (also called a reflection plane, denoted m).\n*   **Conclusion for Optical Activity:** Therefore, the phrase \"have the correct symmetry for optical activity\" is a synonym for being **chiral**. There are 11 chiral (and thus optically active) crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, and 432.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the condition \"achiral\"**\n\n*   **Definition of Achirality:** An achiral structure is one that *is* superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Symmetry Requirement:** A crystal class is achiral if its point group contains at least one improper rotation axis (a center of inversion or a mirror plane).\n*   **Conclusion for Achirality:** This condition requires us to look for crystal classes that are explicitly **not chiral**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Fundamental Contradiction**\n\n*   From Step 1, to be optically active, a crystal class must be **chiral**.\n*   From Step 2, the question explicitly asks for crystal classes that are **achiral**.\n*   A crystal class cannot be both chiral and achiral at the same time. These two conditions are mutually exclusive by definition. This means it is impossible for an achiral crystal class to have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the condition \"non-polar\"**\n\n*   **Definition of a Polar Crystal:** A crystal class is polar if it has at least one unique vector direction (a polar axis) whose two ends are not equivalent by any symmetry operation of the point group. Such crystals can exhibit properties like pyroelectricity. The 10 polar classes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm.\n*   **Definition of a Non-polar Crystal:** A non-polar crystal class is any class that is not polar. There are 22 non-polar crystal classes.\n*   **Relevance to the Question:** This condition acts as a further filter. We are looking for a crystal class that meets three criteria:\n    1.  Achiral\n    2.  Non-polar\n    3.  Optically Active (i.e., Chiral)\n*   As established in Step 3, the first and third criteria are contradictory. No crystal class can satisfy both. Therefore, the addition of the \"non-polar\" constraint does not change the outcome. We are looking for an element in the intersection of three sets, but the intersection of two of those sets is already empty.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe question poses a set of contradictory requirements. Optical activity is a property that arises from chirality. An achiral crystal, by definition, lacks chirality and therefore cannot be optically active. It is impossible for a crystal class to be both \"achiral\" and have \"the correct symmetry for optical activity.\"\n\n<<<There are no achiral crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity. The conditions are mutually exclusive."
