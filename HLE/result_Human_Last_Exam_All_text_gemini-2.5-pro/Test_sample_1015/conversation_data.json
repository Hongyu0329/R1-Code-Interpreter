    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the differences between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods, considering each of the provided options.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Movement - Cambré Derrière**\nA *cambré derrière* is a fundamental ballet movement meaning \"arched or bent backwards.\" It is a backbend that tests a dancer's flexibility, strength, and control. The execution involves bending the torso backward from the waist, while maintaining proper alignment and turnout in the legs and stability in the hips.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Vaganova Method's Approach**\nThe Vaganova method, developed by Agrippina Vaganova in Russia, is known for its precision, strength, and logical, step-by-step progression.\n*   **Core Principle:** Stability and control are paramount.\n*   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:** The backbend must initiate from the upper and middle back (the thoracic spine). The core is engaged to support the lower back. Crucially, the hips must remain completely square and directly over the supporting foot or feet. They do not press forward. This creates a pure, clean curve in the spine while maintaining a stable base. The head follows the line of the spine, looking up and back. The arms are typically held in a classical, rounded 5th position *en haut*.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Balanchine Method's Approach**\nThe Balanchine method, or style, developed by George Balanchine for his New York City Ballet, is characterized by its speed, musicality, athleticism, and elongated, neoclassical lines.\n*   **Core Principle:** Expansiveness, musicality, and creating dynamic lines are key. Rules are sometimes modified to achieve a specific aesthetic effect.\n*   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:** To achieve a deeper and more dramatic backbend, the Balanchine style allows the dancer to press the hips *forward*. This shifts the body's weight and allows for a greater arc in the back. This is a significant departure from the Vaganova technique. While the bend still comes from the spine, the forward placement of the hips fundamentally changes the mechanics and the visual line of the movement, making it look larger and more extreme.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices Based on the Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there are stylistic differences in the *port de bras* (carriage of the arms) between the methods, with Balanchine often using a more open or \"broken\" line, this is not the most fundamental or defining difference in the core mechanics of the cambré itself.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the most critical and defining difference. Vaganova insists on hips remaining stationary and pulled back over the feet. Balanchine permits and encourages the hips to press forward to achieve a deeper bend. This is a core technical instruction that differentiates the two styles for this movement.\n*   **C. Speed:** A cambré is an *adagio* (slow) movement in both styles. While Balanchine's overall style is known for speed, it does not apply universally to every step. The speed of the cambré is not the primary distinction.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The Balanchine method often results in a deeper backbend, but this is a *consequence* of allowing the hips to press forward. The placement of the hips (Choice B) is the *cause* of the difference in degree, making it the more fundamental answer.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head follows the line of the spine naturally. The principle is the same, even if there are subtle stylistic variations. It is not the main point of contrast.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe most significant and biomechanically distinct difference between a Vaganova cambré derrière and a Balanchine cambré derrière is the instruction regarding the placement of the hips. This technical difference leads to the different aesthetic outcomes associated with each style.\n\n<<<B>>>"
