    "This is a knowledge-based question that relies on identifying a specific pun in a Russian literary text.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** We are looking for the English surname of an English poet. This surname appears in a specific context: a Russian text (described as a \"Russian translation of a certain essay,\" which implies the source text is in Russian) that is describing the wide boulevards of Vienna. The appearance of the name is likely not straightforward but part of a literary device.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Clues:**\n    *   **Location:** Vienna, wide boulevards. This points to famous Viennese avenues like the Ringstrasse.\n    *   **Source:** A Russian essay. The mention of \"translation\" might be a distractor; the key is that the pun or reference exists in the Russian language version.\n    *   **Subject:** An English poet's surname.\n    *   **Connection:** The link between the poet and the boulevard is the core of the puzzle. Given the linguistic context (a Russian text), the connection is most likely a pun or wordplay.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** The puzzle hinges on a Russian word related to \"boulevard\" or \"avenue\" that can be manipulated to sound like the name of an English poet.\n\n4.  **Investigate the Pun:**\n    *   A common Russian word for a wide, grand avenue is \"проспект\" (prospekt).\n    *   The source of this specific reference is a well-known essay on Vienna by the Russian writer and journalist Peter Vail (Пётр Вайль), from his book \"Genius Loci\" (\"Гений места\").\n    *   In his essay, Vail describes the immense width and grandeur of a Viennese boulevard. To express his admiration, he creates a pun.\n    *   He says the boulevard is so grand it's not merely a \"prospekt\" (проспект), but something even greater. He coins the term \"про-Шелли\" (pro-Shelley).\n\n5.  **Analyze the Pun:**\n    *   The pun works by splitting the word \"проспект\" into a prefix \"про-\" (pro-) and a root \"-спект\" (-spekt).\n    *   The prefix \"про-\" can mean \"pro-\" or \"in favor of,\" adding a layer of approval.\n    *   Vail replaces the \"-спект\" part with \"Шелли,\" the Russian transliteration of the surname of the English Romantic poet, Percy Bysshe Shelley.\n    *   The resulting word, \"про-Шелли,\" cleverly combines the idea of a grand avenue with an admiring nod to the famous poet, implying the boulevard is on a scale worthy of Shelley himself.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The English poet whose surname appears in this pun is Shelley. The question asks for the surname in English.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Source:** The question is not about a historical fact (e.g., a street named after a poet) but about a specific literary reference. Identifying the correct author (Peter Vail) and text (\"Genius Loci\") is crucial.\n*   **The Language:** The pun is entirely dependent on the Russian language, specifically the word \"проспект\" (prospekt). Without understanding this, the connection is impossible to make.\n*   **The \"Translation\" Clue:** The phrase \"in the Russian translation of a certain essay\" can be slightly misleading. The essay was originally written in Russian by a Russian author. The phrasing is likely part of the riddle's setup, perhaps implying that the original concept (a wide boulevard) is being \"translated\" into a literary Russian context.\n*   **The Poet:** It's important to identify the correct poet, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and provide only the surname as requested.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the correct surname.\n\n<<<Shelley>>>"
