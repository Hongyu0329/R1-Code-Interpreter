    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of triangles for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Great Icosahedron:** The great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra. It has 12 vertices, 30 edges, and 20 self-intersecting triangular faces.\n\n2.  **Identify the \"Outer-Hull\":** The \"outer-hull\" of a polyhedron is its convex hull. The convex hull is the smallest convex polyhedron that can enclose all the vertices of the original shape. For the great icosahedron, its 12 vertices are located at the same positions as the 12 vertices of a standard, convex regular icosahedron.\n\n3.  **Determine the Shape of the Outer-Hull:** Since the vertices of the great icosahedron are identical to the vertices of a regular icosahedron, its convex hull is a **regular icosahedron**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Surface of the Regular Icosahedron:** A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid. By definition, its surface is composed of 20 identical equilateral triangles.\n\n5.  **Understand the \"Triangulation\" Requirement:** The question asks for the minimal number of triangles needed to *triangulate* the surface of this outer-hull. A triangulation of a surface is a decomposition of that surface into a set of triangles.\n\n6.  **Find the Minimal Number:** The surface of the regular icosahedron is already perfectly divided into 20 triangular faces. This existing structure is itself a valid triangulation. It is \"minimal\" because you cannot use fewer than 20 triangles to form the surface of an icosahedron, as the faces themselves are the fundamental triangular components. Any further subdivision would only increase the number of triangles.\n\n7.  **Consider the \"Visible from the Outside\" Condition:** For a convex shape like the regular icosahedron, all of its 20 faces are on its exterior and are therefore \"visible from the outside\". This confirms that the question is asking about the number of faces of the convex hull.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. The surface of a regular icosahedron is composed of 20 triangular faces. This is the minimal triangulation of its surface.\n\n<<<20>>>"
