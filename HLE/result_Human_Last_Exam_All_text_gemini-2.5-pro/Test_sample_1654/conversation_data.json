    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of times Chekhov described Otchumyelov's coat in \"The Chameleon.\"\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe core of the question is to count the number of times Anton Chekhov uses the description or action of Otchumyelov's coat to symbolize his changing mentality. This means we are not just looking for the word \"coat,\" but for specific moments where the coat's state (on, off, being put on, being taken off) is explicitly mentioned to reflect a shift in the character's attitude.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Symbolism:** The coat is not just a piece of clothing. It represents Otchumyelov's official authority and his \"armor\" against uncertainty. When he is confident in his power over commoners, he wears it. When he faces someone potentially powerful, he removes it to appear less intimidating and more servile. When his certainty wavers, his physical temperature changes, and he needs the coat back on.\n2.  **\"Description\" vs. \"Action\":** The question uses the word \"describe,\" but in this context, the most significant descriptions are the *actions* of putting the coat on and taking it off. We must count each of these distinct actions as a \"description\" of his shifting state.\n3.  **Initial State and Final State:** It's important to include the first time the coat is mentioned, as this sets the stage, and the final action involving the coat, which concludes the symbolic motif.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of the Text**\n\nLet's walk through the story chronologically and identify each instance related to the coat.\n\n*   **Instance 1: The Initial Description**\n    At the very beginning of the story, as Otchumyelov walks across the market square, he is introduced as wearing his coat.\n    *   **Description:** \"...the police superintendent Otchumyelov, in a new overcoat...\"\n    *   **Significance:** This establishes his official status and the presence of the key symbol.\n\n*   **Instance 2: The First Shift (Subservience)**\n    When someone in the crowd suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov's attitude instantly changes from aggressive to flustered.\n    *   **Description:** He turns to the policeman and says, \"Take my coat off, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot!\"\n    *   **Significance:** He sheds his official \"armor\" to appear less threatening and more accommodating in the potential presence of power.\n\n*   **Instance 3: The Second Shift (Return to Authority)**\n    The policeman remarks that the General's dogs are setters, so this one can't be his. Otchumyelov's confidence returns.\n    *   **Description:** \"Put my coat on, Yeldyrin, my lad... there's a wind getting up... I am shivering.\"\n    *   **Significance:** He feels a metaphorical \"chill\" of uncertainty being replaced by the warmth of his restored authority. He needs his coat back on.\n\n*   **Instance 4: The Third Shift (Renewed Subservience)**\n    It is then suggested that the dog might belong to the General's *brother*. This again makes Otchumyelov nervous and eager to please.\n    *   **Description:** Otchumyelov's face beams with a subservient smile, and he says, \"Take my coat off, Yeldyrin...\"\n    *   **Significance:** The cycle repeats. Faced with potential connections to power, he once again sheds his symbol of authority.\n\n*   **Instance 5: The Fourth Shift (Return to Authority Again)**\n    The General's cook appears and states definitively that the dog is not theirs. Otchumyelov immediately reverts to his stern, official self.\n    *   **Description:** He becomes stern and says, \"Put on my coat, brother Yeldyrin.\"\n    *   **Significance:** With the threat of a powerful owner seemingly gone, he puts his \"armor\" back on to deal with the commoners.\n\n*   **Instance 6: The Final Action (Conclusion)**\n    Finally, the cook clarifies that the dog actually does belong to the General's brother. Otchumyelov, having found the \"correct\" position, ends the incident. As he leaves, the coat gets a final mention.\n    *   **Description:** \"...and wrapping himself in his greatcoat, he goes on his way through the market-place.\"\n    *   **Significance:** This final action shows him retreating back into his official persona, the conflict resolved, and his chameleon-like performance concluded for now. He is securely \"wrapped\" in his authority.\n\n### **Final Tally**\n\nCounting these distinct instances gives us a total of six times that Chekhov uses the coat to describe and symbolize Otchumyelov's shifting mentality.\n\n1.  Initial state (wearing the new overcoat).\n2.  Taking the coat off.\n3.  Putting the coat on.\n4.  Taking the coat off again.\n5.  Putting the coat on again.\n6.  Final state (wrapping the greatcoat around himself).\n\n<<<6>>>"
