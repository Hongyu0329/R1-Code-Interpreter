    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **a(n):** This denotes a sequence where 'n' is an integer index.\n*   **Feynman diagrams:** These are graphical representations used in quantum field theory to visualize and calculate the interactions between particles.\n*   **Order 2n:** In Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the fundamental interaction involves one photon and two electron lines meeting at a point called a vertex. Each vertex introduces a factor of the elementary charge 'e' into the calculation. The \"order\" of a diagram typically refers to the number of vertices. So, an order 2n diagram has 2n vertices.\n*   **Electron or the photon propagators:** We are interested in diagrams that represent corrections to the propagation of a single particle (either an electron or a photon). These are called self-energy diagrams or two-point functions. They have two external lines: one for the particle coming in and one for it going out.\n*   **Non-vanishing:** This implies we are counting all the topologically distinct diagrams that contribute a non-zero value. In this context, it is standard to count the number of **one-particle irreducible (1PI)** diagrams. A diagram is 1PI if it cannot be split into two disconnected parts by cutting a single internal line. These 1PI diagrams are the fundamental building blocks for corrections.\n*   **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** The specific theory governing the interactions between light (photons) and matter (electrons).\n*   **What is a(3)?**: The question asks for the third term in this sequence, which corresponds to setting n=3.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Order to Loop Number**\n\nIn QED, the corrections to propagators are organized by the number of loops in the diagrams. A diagram of order 2n (meaning 2n vertices) corresponds to an n-loop correction. We can verify this with the formula for the number of loops (L) in a connected graph: `L = I - V + 1`, where I is the number of internal lines and V is the number of vertices. For a QED propagator diagram with V=2n vertices, it can be shown that the number of loops L is equal to n.\n\nTherefore, finding a(3) is equivalent to finding the number of 3-loop diagrams for the electron or photon propagator.\n\n**Step 3: Consult Known Results**\n\nThe number of Feynman diagrams at a given loop order is a well-known, albeit complex, combinatorial problem. The results have been calculated by physicists and are documented in the scientific literature.\n\n*   **n = 1 (1-loop, 2 vertices):** There is only **1** diagram for the electron self-energy (an electron emitting and reabsorbing a photon) and **1** for the photon self-energy (a photon splitting into an electron-positron pair and recombining). So, **a(1) = 1**.\n*   **n = 2 (2-loops, 4 vertices):** The number of distinct 1PI diagrams has been calculated to be **7**. So, **a(2) = 7**.\n*   **n = 3 (3-loops, 6 vertices):** This is the value we need. This calculation is significantly more complex. Authoritative sources, such as the paper \"The number of one-particle irreducible Feynman graphs\" by CvitanoviÄ‡, Lautrup, and Pearson (1978), provide the result. The number of 3-loop 1PI diagrams for the electron self-energy (or photon self-energy) is **72**. So, **a(3) = 72**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence a(n) represents the number of n-loop 1PI QED propagator diagrams.\n*   a(1) = 1\n*   a(2) = 7\n*   a(3) = 72\n\nThe question asks for a(3). Based on established results in quantum field theory, the number of 3-loop (order 6) non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the electron or photon propagator is 72.\n\n<<<72>>>"
