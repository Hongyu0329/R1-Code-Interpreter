    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the philosopher who made the specified distinction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** The question asks for the name of a specific person.\n    *   **Affiliation:** This person must be a member of the \"Lviv-Warsaw School\" of philosophy.\n    *   **Action:** This philosopher \"decomposes the notion of hallmark into symptoms and signals.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Lviv-Warsaw School:** This was an influential school of logic and analytic philosophy in Poland during the interwar period (1918-1939). Its members are known for their emphasis on clarity, logical rigor, and scientific methodology. Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski (the founder), Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n    *   **Hallmark / Sign:** The term \"hallmark\" here refers to a more general concept of a \"sign\" (in Polish, *znak*). A sign is something that stands for something else. The question is about the analysis of this very concept.\n    *   **Symptoms and Signals:** This is the core distinction. It separates signs into two fundamental types based on the nature of their relationship to what they signify.\n        *   **Symptom:** A natural sign. The connection between the sign and what it signifies is causal or natural. For example, a fever is a symptom of an illness; smoke is a symptom of fire.\n        *   **Signal:** A conventional or artificial sign. The connection is established by agreement, rule, or intention. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; the word \"cat\" is a signal that refers to the animal.\n\n3.  **Survey the Philosophers of the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   We need to identify which philosopher from this school was particularly concerned with the philosophy of language, semantics, and the theory of signs (semiotics).\n    *   While many members touched upon these topics, **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** is the most prominent figure in the school for his systematic work in these areas. His work often focused on the logic of science and the analysis of language.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Specific Contribution:**\n    *   Investigating the works of Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz confirms that he made precisely this distinction. In his influential book *Logika pragmatyczna* (*Pragmatic Logic*), he provides a detailed classification of signs.\n    *   He explicitly distinguishes between natural signs, which he calls **symptoms** (*symptomy* or *oznaki*), and conventional signs, which correspond to **signals** (*sygnały* or *znaki umowne*). This distinction was fundamental to his analysis of language and meaning.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposed the notion of a sign (hallmark) into symptoms (natural signs) and signals (conventional signs) is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Terminology:** The English term \"hallmark\" is a good stand-in for the general Polish concept of *znak* (sign/mark) that is being analyzed. The key is the specific division into \"symptoms\" and \"signals.\"\n*   **Context:** This distinction is not unique to Ajdukiewicz in the entire history of philosophy (earlier thinkers like the Stoics or John Locke made similar points), but it is a characteristic and central part of *his* contribution within the context of the *Lviv-Warsaw School*.\n*   **Attribution:** While other members of the school discussed language and meaning, this specific and influential classification of signs is most strongly and directly attributed to Ajdukiewicz.\n\n***\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
