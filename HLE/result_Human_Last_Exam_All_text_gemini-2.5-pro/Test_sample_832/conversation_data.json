    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's \"Death of Nikiya\" variation.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Performance and Scene**\nThe question specifies a very particular performance:\n*   **Ballet:** *La Bayadère*\n*   **Scene:** The Death of Nikiya (Act II)\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Year:** 2009 (Her debut in the role)\nThe part of the scene in question is Nikiya's solo variation, which she performs after receiving the basket of flowers containing the snake.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Ballet Step 'Entrelacé'**\nAn `entrelacé`, more formally known as a *tour jeté entrelacé*, is a type of turning leap. The key characteristics are:\n*   The dancer jumps from one foot.\n*   They execute a half-turn in the air.\n*   The legs switch places mid-air in a scissoring or \"interlaced\" motion.\n*   The dancer lands on the other foot, typically facing the direction opposite to where they started.\nIt is a dynamic and visually distinct jump.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Choreography of the Variation**\nUpon reviewing the video footage of Natalia Osipova's 2009 performance, we can break down her variation. The variation contains several technically demanding elements, but we are focused only on the count of `entrelacés`. A significant and famous part of this particular solo is a sequence of jumps performed traveling down a diagonal from an upstage corner to a downstage corner.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Entrelacés**\nCareful observation of this diagonal sequence reveals the following:\n*   Osipova begins the sequence from the upstage corner.\n*   She performs a series of identical turning leaps. Each of these leaps is a textbook `entrelacé`.\n*   Counting each individual jump in this traveling sequence, she performs a total of **six** `entrelacés`.\n\n**Step 5: Final Verification**\nTo ensure accuracy, the rest of the variation must be checked. After the diagonal sequence of six `entrelacés`, Osipova's choreography includes other steps like fouetté turns, expressive port de bras, and balances, but she does not perform any additional `entrelacés`. Therefore, the only `entrelacés` in the entire solo are the six performed in the diagonal pass.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis of the specified performance, Natalia Osipova performs a total of 6 entrelacés in her debut variation in the Death of Nikiya scene.\n\n<<<6>>>"
