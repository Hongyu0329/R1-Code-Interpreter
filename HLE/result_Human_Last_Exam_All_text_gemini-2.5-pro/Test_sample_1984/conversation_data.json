    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the differential equation and the function f(x).**\nThe given autonomous differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nWe can write this as $x'(t) = f(x(t))$, where the function $f(x)$ is:\n$$ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x $$\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points.**\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) are the values of $x$ for which the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$. This means we need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nFirst, we can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term in the parenthesis is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are the equilibrium points:\n$x_1 = 0$\n$x_2 = 1$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point.**\nTo determine the stability, we can use the first derivative test for autonomous systems. An equilibrium point $x_0$ is:\n*   **Stable** (or asymptotically stable) if $f'(x_0) < 0$.\n*   **Unstable** if $f'(x_0) > 0$.\n*   **Semi-stable** or requires further analysis if $f'(x_0) = 0$.\n\nLet's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x $$\n$$ f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\nNow, we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_1 = 0$:**\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_2 = 1$:**\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must analyze the sign of $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$. Our function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\n    *   Consider a value of $x$ slightly less than 1, for example, $x = 0.9$.\n        $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9-1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.009 < 0$.\n        Since $x' = f(x) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving away from $x=1$.\n    *   Consider a value of $x$ slightly greater than 1, for example, $x = 1.1$.\n        $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1-1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -0.011 < 0$.\n        Since $x' = f(x) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving towards $x=1$.\n\n    A phase portrait would look like this:\n    $$ \\rightarrow \\rightarrow \\rightarrow 0 \\leftarrow \\leftarrow \\leftarrow 1 \\leftarrow \\leftarrow \\leftarrow $$\n    For an equilibrium point to be stable, solutions on both sides must converge to it. At $x=1$, solutions starting from the left ($x<1$) move away from it. Therefore, $x=1$ is not a stable equilibrium. It is a **semi-stable** point, which is considered a type of **unstable** equilibrium.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of stable equilibrium points (m).**\nFrom our analysis, only the equilibrium point $x=0$ is stable.\nTherefore, the number of stable equilibrium points, $m$, is 1.\n$$ m = 1 $$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final expression.**\nThe question asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$ into the expression:\n$$ m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n*   **Factoring:** Ensure the polynomial $f(x)$ is factored correctly to find all equilibrium points.\n*   **Stability Definition:** Understand the precise definition of a stable equilibrium. A semi-stable point, where solutions approach from one side but move away from the other, is not considered stable. The first derivative test ($f'(x_0)$) is a shortcut, but analyzing the sign of $f(x)$ around $x_0$ is the fundamental method, especially when $f'(x_0)=0$.\n*   **Calculation:** The final calculation is straightforward once the correct value of $m$ is determined.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nGiven $m = 1$, we compute $m - 2^{4048}$.\n$1 - 2^{4048}$"
