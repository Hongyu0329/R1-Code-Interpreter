Yes, the theory can fail. A birefringent medium alters the polarization state of the beam in a way that is not corrected by an inverse process designed only to reverse the effects of the random medium and free-space propagation. While the spatial profile of the beam might be restored, its polarization will not be, meaning the recovered beam is not identical to the original input.
