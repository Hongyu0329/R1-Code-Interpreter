    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   We are working with graphs that have exactly `n = 128` vertices.\n    *   We are interested in cliques (`K_k`) that appear as **induced subgraphs**.\n    *   A clique `K_k` is a set of `k` vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex in the set.\n    *   An induced subgraph `G[S]` on a set of vertices `S` contains all the vertices from `S` and *only* the edges from the original graph `G` that connect two vertices in `S`.\n    *   The goal is to find a single graph `G` on 128 vertices that maximizes the number of **different** values of `k` for which an induced `K_k` exists.\n\n2.  **Relating Clique Size and Number of Clique Sizes:**\n    *   Let's consider any graph `G`. Let `ω(G)` be the size of the largest clique in `G`. This largest clique is often called the \"clique number\" of the graph.\n    *   This means there exists a set of `ω(G)` vertices in `G`, let's call this set `V_{max}`, that form a `K_{ω(G)}`.\n    *   Now, consider any integer `k` such that `1 ≤ k ≤ ω(G)`. Can we find an induced clique of size `k` in this graph `G`?\n    *   Yes. We can simply choose a subset of `k` vertices from our large clique's vertex set `V_{max}`. Let's call this subset `V_k`.\n    *   Since every pair of vertices in `V_{max}` is connected by an edge in `G`, it follows that every pair of vertices in the subset `V_k` is also connected by an edge in `G`.\n    *   The subgraph induced by `V_k`, which is `G[V_k]`, will therefore be a complete graph on `k` vertices, i.e., a `K_k`.\n    *   This shows that if a graph `G` contains a clique of size `ω(G)`, it must also contain induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to `ω(G)`.\n    *   The number of different clique sizes in `G` is therefore at least `ω(G)`. By definition, there can be no clique of size greater than `ω(G)`.\n    *   Therefore, for any graph `G`, the number of different clique sizes that appear as induced subgraphs is exactly `ω(G)`.\n\n3.  **Reframing the Problem:**\n    *   Based on the analysis in Step 2, the problem is equivalent to answering the following question: \"What is the maximum possible clique number, `ω(G)`, for a graph `G` with `n = 128` vertices?\"\n\n4.  **Solving the Reframed Problem:**\n    *   A clique of size `k` requires `k` vertices.\n    *   A graph with `n` vertices can have a clique of size at most `n`, because there are only `n` vertices available in total.\n    *   So, for a graph `G` on 128 vertices, the maximum possible clique size `ω(G)` is at most 128.\n    *   We need to check if this maximum is achievable. Can we construct a graph `G` on 128 vertices that has a clique of size 128?\n    *   Yes, the complete graph on 128 vertices, `K_{128}`, is such a graph. By definition, all 128 of its vertices form a clique. So, `ω(K_{128}) = 128`.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The maximum possible number of different clique sizes is equal to the maximum possible clique number `ω(G)` for a graph on 128 vertices.\n    *   The maximum possible value for `ω(G)` is 128, achieved by the complete graph `K_{128}`.\n    *   The graph `K_{128}` has induced cliques of all sizes from `k=1` to `k=128`. This gives 128 different clique sizes.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** The fact that we are looking for *induced* subgraphs is crucial, but it simplifies the problem in this case. Any set of vertices that forms a clique as a subgraph also forms a clique as an induced subgraph.\n*   **Simultaneously:** This means all the different-sized cliques must exist within the same single graph. The `K_{128}` construction satisfies this.\n*   **Different Sizes:** The question is not about the total number of cliques, but the number of *distinct sizes* of cliques. For `K_{128}`, the set of sizes is `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`, which has 128 distinct elements.\n\nThe maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
