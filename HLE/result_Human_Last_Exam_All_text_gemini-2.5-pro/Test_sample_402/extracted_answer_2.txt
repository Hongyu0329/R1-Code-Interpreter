The proposed filtering strategy is to first perform a preliminary differential expression analysis comparing the contaminated CAR-T samples against the cleaner CAR-T-IL15 samples, ensuring the paired-donor experimental design is modeled. From the results of this analysis, generate a list of contaminating genes by applying a stringent filter, such as a **log2 fold change greater than 5** and a **p-adjusted value less than 0.001**. This identifies genes dramatically and significantly more abundant in the contaminated group, which are artifacts of the cancer cells. This list of contaminating genes should then be used to remove those specific genes from the original raw count matrix. Finally, perform the definitive biological differential expression analysis on this new, cleaned count matrix to accurately reveal the true transcriptional differences between regular CAR-T and CAR-T-IL15 cells.
