    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the matrix and the task.**\nThe question asks for the determinant of the following 3x3 matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe information \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" provides context for where this matrix arises but is not necessary for the calculation of the determinant itself.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a method for calculating the determinant.**\nThere are several methods to compute the determinant of a 3x3 matrix.\n*   **Method 1: The Rule of Sarrus.** This is a direct formula for 3x3 matrices.\n*   **Method 2: Cofactor Expansion.** This involves expanding the determinant along a row or column.\n*   **Method 3: Using Matrix Properties.** Observing properties like linear dependence of rows or columns can simplify the calculation significantly.\n\nWe will demonstrate Method 3 first, as it is the most efficient, and then verify with Method 1.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis using Matrix Properties (Method 3).**\nA fundamental theorem in linear algebra states that if the rows (or columns) of a matrix are linearly dependent, its determinant is zero. Linear dependence means that one row can be written as a linear combination of the others, or equivalently, that a non-trivial linear combination of the rows equals the zero vector.\n\nLet's inspect the rows of matrix A:\n*   Row 1: `R1 = [2, -1, -1]`\n*   Row 2: `R2 = [-1, 2, -1]`\n*   Row 3: `R3 = [-1, -1, 2]`\n\nLet's sum the three rows:\n`R1 + R2 + R3 = [2 + (-1) + (-1),   -1 + 2 + (-1),   -1 + (-1) + 2]`\n`R1 + R2 + R3 = [0, 0, 0]`\n\nSince the sum of the three rows is the zero vector, the rows are linearly dependent. Therefore, the determinant of the matrix A must be 0.\n*Careful point:* Noticing this property is the quickest way to find the answer. A matrix where the sum of each row (or each column) is zero is guaranteed to have a determinant of zero.\n\n**Step 4: Verification using the Rule of Sarrus (Method 1).**\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix is:\n`det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`\nFor our matrix A:\n`a = 2`, `b = -1`, `c = -1`\n`d = -1`, `e = 2`, `f = -1`\n`g = -1`, `h = -1`, `i = 2`\n\nLet's substitute these values into the formula:\n`det(A) = 2 * ((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) - (-1) * ((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) + (-1) * ((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1))`\n\nNow, we calculate each part:\n*   `2 * (4 - 1) = 2 * 3 = 6`\n*   `-(-1) * (-2 - 1) = 1 * (-3) = -3`\n*   `(-1) * (1 - (-2)) = -1 * (1 + 2) = -1 * 3 = -3`\n\nFinally, sum the parts:\n`det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3 = 0`\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\nBoth methods yield the same result. The determinant of the given matrix is 0."
