    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for a specific novel identified by two key pieces of information provided by Jorge Luis Borges:\n1.  A metaphorical description of the novel: It has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n2.  A description of the novel's author: He is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Clues\n*   **Clue 1: \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\"**: This suggests a work that is simultaneously raw and powerful (\"tiger\") and also highly structured, intellectual, and strategic (\"chess duel\"). The combination points to a narrative with strong emotional or psychological force that unfolds with precision and complex internal logic.\n*   **Clue 2: \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\"**: This is a significant pointer towards a 20th-century Latin American author. William Faulkner's influence—particularly his use of stream-of-consciousness, complex timelines, multiple narrators, and the creation of a fictional locale (Yoknapatawpha County)—was immense on the writers of the Latin American \"Boom\" and their predecessors. The term \"simplifier\" suggests that this author took Faulkner's complex techniques and made them more streamlined or accessible, while still working within a similar literary tradition.\n\n### Step 3: Connect the Clues to a Specific Author and Work\n*   The author most famously linked to Faulkner in this manner is the Uruguayan novelist **Juan Carlos Onetti**. Critics universally acknowledge Faulkner as Onetti's primary literary influence. Onetti's creation of the mythical city of Santa María is a direct parallel to Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha. His novels are known for their bleak, existential atmosphere and psychologically complex characters, which aligns with Faulkner's themes.\n*   The quote itself comes from the prologue Jorge Luis Borges wrote for the 1961 edition of Onetti's novel **_El astillero_** (**_The Shipyard_**). Borges was an admirer of Onetti's craftsmanship.\n*   Let's see how the description fits _El astillero_.\n    *   **Intensity of a tiger**: The novel is a deeply intense psychological study of its protagonist, Larsen, and his futile, desperate struggle against decay and meaninglessness in a defunct, rotting shipyard. The atmosphere is one of oppressive gloom and raw existential dread.\n    *   **Variety that a chess duel can achieve**: The plot is meticulously constructed. It operates with a small cast of characters in a confined space, and their interactions are like calculated moves in a game. The narrative progresses with a grim, deliberate, and almost mathematical logic towards its inevitable, bleak conclusion, much like an endgame in chess.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nBy combining the clues, it is clear that Jorge Luis Borges was referring to **_El astillero_ (_The Shipyard_)** by **Juan Carlos Onetti**. The quote is from Borges's prologue to that specific book, and the description of the author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is a classic critical assessment of Onetti.\n\n<<<The novel is *El astillero* (*The Shipyard*) by the Uruguayan author Juan Carlos Onetti.>>>"
