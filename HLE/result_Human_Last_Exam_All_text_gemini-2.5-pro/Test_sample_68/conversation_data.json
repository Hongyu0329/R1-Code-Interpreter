    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements in the smallest algebraic structure that allows coloring the figure-eight knot.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand Knot Coloring**\n\nKnot coloring is a method to associate an algebraic structure with a knot. We assign a \"color,\" typically an integer from a set {0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}, to each arc of a knot diagram. The coloring must obey a specific rule at every crossing.\n\n*   **The Coloring Rule (Wirtinger Coloring):** At any crossing, if `c` is the color of the over-passing arc, and `a` and `b` are the colors of the two under-passing arcs, then the colors must satisfy the equation:\n    `2c ≡ a + b (mod n)`\n    where `n` is the number of colors.\n\n*   **Trivial vs. Non-Trivial Coloring:** A coloring is considered \"trivial\" if all arcs are assigned the same color. For any `n`, this is always a valid solution (since `2k ≡ k + k (mod n)` is always true). A knot is said to be \"n-colorable\" if it admits a *non-trivial* coloring (i.e., at least two arcs have different colors) using `n` colors.\n\n*   **The Algebraic Structure:** The set of `n` colors {0, 1, 2, ..., n-1} with addition and multiplication modulo `n` forms the algebraic structure known as the ring of integers modulo `n`, denoted **Z_n**. The question asks for the size of the *smallest* such structure that allows for a non-trivial coloring. This means we need to find the smallest integer `n > 1` for which the figure-eight knot is n-colorable.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Colorability to the Knot Determinant**\n\nFor a given knot, we can write a system of linear equations based on the coloring rule at each crossing. A knot is n-colorable if and only if this system of equations has a non-trivial solution over Z_n. This condition is directly related to the **determinant of the knot**, `det(K)`.\n\n*   **Rule:** A knot K is n-colorable if and only if `gcd(det(K), n) > 1`.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of colors `n` with which a knot can be non-trivially colored is the smallest prime factor of its determinant. Our task is to find the determinant of the figure-eight knot.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Figure-Eight Knot (Knot 4_1)**\n\nThe figure-eight knot has 4 crossings and 4 arcs. Let's label the arcs `x₁`, `x₂`, `x₃`, and `x₄`.\n\nWe can set up the coloring equations for each crossing:\n1.  **Crossing 1:** Arc `x₄` goes over arcs `x₁` and `x₂`. Equation: `2x₄ ≡ x₁ + x₂ (mod n)`\n2.  **Crossing 2:** Arc `x₂` goes over arcs `x₃` and `x₄`. Equation: `2x₂ ≡ x₃ + x₄ (mod n)`\n3.  **Crossing 3:** Arc `x₁` goes over arcs `x₂` and `x₃`. Equation: `2x₁ ≡ x₂ + x₃ (mod n)`\n4.  **Crossing 4:** Arc `x₃` goes over arcs `x₄` and `x₁`. Equation: `2x₃ ≡ x₄ + x₁ (mod n)`\n\nRewriting these as a system of homogeneous linear equations (`... = 0`):\n1.  `-x₁ - x₂ + 2x₄ = 0`\n2.  `2x₂ - x₃ - x₄ = 0`\n3.  `2x₁ - x₂ - x₃ = 0`\n4.  `-x₁ + 2x₃ - x₄ = 0`\n\nThis system can be represented by a matrix equation `M * x = 0`. The matrix `M` (the coloring matrix) is:\n```\n[ -1  -1   0   2 ]\n[  0   2  -1  -1 ]\n[  2  -1  -1   0 ]\n[ -1   0   2  -1 ]\n```\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Knot Determinant**\n\nThe determinant of the knot is the absolute value of the determinant of any submatrix formed by removing one row and one column from `M`. Let's remove the last row and last column.\n\nThe submatrix `M'` is:\n```\n[ -1  -1   0 ]\n[  0   2  -1 ]\n[  2  -1  -1 ]\n```\nNow, we calculate its determinant:\n`det(M') = -1 * ((2)(-1) - (-1)(-1)) - (-1) * ((0)(-1) - (-1)(2)) + 0 * (...)`\n`det(M') = -1 * (-2 - 1) + 1 * (0 + 2)`\n`det(M') = -1 * (-3) + 1 * (2)`\n`det(M') = 3 + 2 = 5`\n\nThe determinant of the figure-eight knot is `|det(M')| = 5`.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Smallest Number of Colors `n`**\n\nThe figure-eight knot is n-colorable if `gcd(det(K), n) > 1`, which means `gcd(5, n) > 1`.\nSince 5 is a prime number, its only prime factor is 5. For the `gcd(5, n)` to be greater than 1, `n` must be a multiple of 5.\nThe smallest integer `n > 1` that is a multiple of 5 is `n=5`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe smallest number of colors that allows a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot is 5. The corresponding algebraic structure is the ring of integers modulo 5, **Z_5**. This structure consists of the set of elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\nThe number of elements in this smallest algebraic structure is 5.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$.\n<<<5>>>"
