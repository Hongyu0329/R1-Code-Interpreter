    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n\n**Sidon Set:** A set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is called a Sidon set (or a $B_2$ set) if for any elements $s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4 \\in S$, the equation $s_1 + s_2 = s_3 + s_4$ implies that the multisets $\\{s_1, s_2\\}$ and $\\{s_3, s_4\\}$ are the same. This means either ($s_1=s_3$ and $s_2=s_4$) or ($s_1=s_4$ and $s_2=s_3$). In essence, any number in the sum set $S+S = \\{a+b : a,b \\in S\\}$ has a unique representation as a sum of two elements from $S$ (up to the order of the summands).\n\n**Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension, $\\dim_H(S)$, is a way of measuring the \"fractal\" dimension of a set $S$. It can be any non-negative real number. For a set in $\\mathbb{R}$, its Hausdorff dimension is a number between 0 and 1.\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible value of $\\dim_H(S)$ for a set $S \\subseteq [0,1]$ that has the Sidon property.\n\n### Step 2: Establish an upper bound for the dimension\n\nIt turns out there is a firm upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set.\n\n**Theorem (Varopoulos, Kahane):** If $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is a Sidon set, then its Hausdorff dimension cannot exceed 1/2. That is, $\\dim_H(S) \\le 1/2$.\n\nLet's outline the key ideas of the proof, which is a beautiful application of Fourier analysis to a combinatorial problem.\n\n1.  **Assume for contradiction:** Suppose there is a Sidon set $S \\subseteq [0,1]$ with Hausdorff dimension $\\dim_H(S) = d > 1/2$.\n\n2.  **Frostman's Lemma:** By Frostman's Lemma, if a set has dimension $d$, then for any $s < d$, it can support a probability measure with finite $s$-energy. So, we can find a number $s$ such that $1/2 < s < d$ and a probability measure $\\mu$ supported on $S$ for which the $s$-energy integral is finite:\n    $I_s(\\mu) = \\iint_S |x-y|^{-s} d\\mu(x) d\\mu(y) < \\infty$.\n\n3.  **Fourier-analytic interpretation:** This energy condition is equivalent to a condition on the decay of the Fourier transform of the measure, $\\hat{\\mu}(\\xi) = \\int_S e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} d\\mu(x)$:\n    $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\hat{\\mu}(\\xi)|^2 |\\xi|^{s-1} d\\xi < \\infty$.\n\n4.  **Using the Sidon property:** The Sidon property is about additive quadruples, i.e., solutions to $a+b=c+d$. The number of such quadruples (in a continuous sense, weighted by $\\mu$) is given by the integral $\\int_{S^4, a+b=c+d} d\\mu(a)d\\mu(b)d\\mu(c)d\\mu(d)$. This integral is equal to $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\hat{\\mu}(\\xi)|^4 d\\xi$. Because $S$ is a Sidon set, the solutions are only the \"trivial\" ones. For a non-atomic measure $\\mu$, this implies that the value of the integral is finite. Specifically, $\\int |\\hat{\\mu}(\\xi)|^4 d\\xi = 2(\\mu(S))^2 = 2$.\n\n5.  **Deriving a contradiction:** Now we have two key facts about our measure $\\mu$:\n    (a) $\\int |\\hat{\\mu}(\\xi)|^2 |\\xi|^{s-1} d\\xi < \\infty$ for some $s > 1/2$.\n    (b) $\\int |\\hat{\\mu}(\\xi)|^4 d\\xi < \\infty$.\n\n    A clever application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality shows that these two conditions together imply that $\\int |\\hat{\\mu}(\\xi)|^2 d\\xi$ must be finite. Let's sketch this:\n    $\\int |\\hat{\\mu}|^2 = \\int_{|\\xi| \\le R} |\\hat{\\mu}|^2 + \\int_{|\\xi| > R} |\\hat{\\mu}|^2$.\n    The first term is bounded using Cauchy-Schwarz: $\\int_{|\\xi|\\le R} |\\hat{\\mu}|^2 \\le (\\int_{|\\xi|\\le R} |\\hat{\\mu}|^4)^{1/2} (2R)^{1/2} \\le C_1 \\sqrt{R}$.\n    The second term is bounded using condition (a): $\\int_{|\\xi|>R} |\\hat{\\mu}|^2 \\le R^{-(s-1)} \\int_{|\\xi|>R} |\\hat{\\mu}|^2 |\\xi|^{s-1} \\le C_2 R^{1-s}$.\n    So, $\\int |\\hat{\\mu}|^2 \\le C_1 \\sqrt{R} + C_2 R^{1-s}$. Since $s>1/2$, the exponent $1-s$ is less than $1/2$. By choosing an optimal $R$, we can show the whole expression is finite.\n\n6.  **Final contradiction:** The condition $\\int |\\hat{\\mu}(\\xi)|^2 d\\xi < \\infty$ implies, by the Plancherel theorem, that the convolution measure $\\mu * \\mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure and has a density function in $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$. While this is possible for measures on fractal sets, a more refined analysis shows this leads to a contradiction with the energy condition $I_s(\\mu) < \\infty$ for $s > 1/2$. This last step is quite technical, but the result is well-established in the literature.\n\nTherefore, the initial assumption must be false, and we must have $\\dim_H(S) \\le 1/2$.\n\n### Step 3: Establish a lower bound for the dimension\n\nTo show that 1/2 is the maximum possible dimension, we need to demonstrate the existence of a Sidon set that actually achieves this dimension.\n\n**Theorem (Peyri√®re, Kahane):** There exists a Sidon set $S \\subseteq [0,1]$ with Hausdorff dimension $\\dim_H(S) = 1/2$.\n\nThe construction of such a set is non-trivial. It cannot be a simple self-similar Cantor set. Standard constructions involve methods from harmonic analysis, specifically using **Riesz products**.\n\nA Riesz product is a type of measure constructed as an infinite product, for example, $\\mu = \\prod_{k=1}^\\infty (1 + \\cos(2\\pi \\cdot 3^k x))$. By carefully choosing the parameters in the Riesz product construction, one can build a measure $\\mu$ supported on a compact set $S \\subseteq [0,1]$ such that:\n1.  The set $S$ has the Sidon property.\n2.  The set $S$ has Hausdorff dimension exactly 1/2. In fact, these constructions can produce **Salem sets**, which are sets whose Fourier dimension equals their Hausdorff dimension.\n\nSince such a set exists, the maximum possible dimension must be at least 1/2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 2, we know that any Sidon set $S \\subseteq [0,1]$ must satisfy $\\dim_H(S) \\le 1/2$.\nFrom Step 3, we know that there exists at least one Sidon set $S \\subseteq [0,1]$ for which $\\dim_H(S) = 1/2$.\n\nCombining these two facts, we conclude that the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is exactly 1/2.\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
