    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Event:** After escaping/being released from the Gestapo.\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait.\n*   **Question:** What does he hold in his hand, and what does it symbolize?\n\n**Step 2: Research the specific artwork.**\nThe painting in question is titled \"Self-Portrait with Thistle\" (in German: *Selbstbildnis mit Distel*). This immediately identifies the object he is holding.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the historical context.**\n*   In early 1933, the Nazi Party consolidated its power in Germany.\n*   Curt Querner was a member of the Communist Party (KPD) and the Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists (ASSO).\n*   Due to his political affiliations, he was arrested by the Gestapo in March 1933 and held in custody.\n*   He painted this self-portrait shortly after his release. This context is essential for understanding the painting's message. He is not just painting a flower; he is making a statement immediately after being persecuted by the new regime.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the object and its symbolic meaning.**\n*   **The Object:** As the title suggests, Querner is holding a **thistle**.\n*   **The Symbolism:** A thistle is a plant known for several characteristics that lend it to powerful symbolism.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Resilience and Toughness.** Thistles are famously hardy and difficult to remove. They can thrive in harsh conditions. This directly mirrors Querner's own resilience in the face of political persecution. He is showing that he has not been broken by his arrest.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Defiance and Protection.** The most prominent feature of a thistle is its sharp thorns. By holding the prickly thistle, Querner symbolizes his defiance. The thorns act as a defense mechanism, representing his \"prickly,\" unyielding, and resistant attitude towards the Nazi regime. It is a visual declaration of his unbroken spirit.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Connection to the Land.** As a painter often associated with rural themes and the working class, the thistle—a common field plant—also connects him to his identity as a man of the people and the land, reinforcing his political and social convictions.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the findings into a final answer.**\nAfter being arrested by the Gestapo in 1933 for his communist beliefs, Curt Querner painted a self-portrait. In it, he holds a thistle. This object is a potent symbol of his resistance. The thistle's tough, resilient nature represents his own unbreakable spirit, while its sharp thorns symbolize his defiance and \"prickly\" opposition to the Nazi regime.\n\n<<<He holds a thistle in his hand. It symbolizes his resilience, defiance, and unbroken spirit in the face of Nazi persecution.>>>"
