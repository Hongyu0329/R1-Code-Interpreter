    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Locate Waskaganish**\nWaskaganish is a Cree community located in northern Quebec. It sits on the south-east shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River. Its approximate geographical coordinates are 51.2° N latitude, 78.8° W longitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Surrounding Provinces and Territories**\nThe provinces and territories that border Quebec are:\n*   **Ontario:** To the west and south.\n*   **Nunavut:** To the north. The territory of Nunavut includes all the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** To the east.\n*   **New Brunswick:** To the south-east.\n\nGiven Waskaganish's location on James Bay, the closest candidates will be Ontario and Nunavut. Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick are significantly farther away.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proximity of Ontario**\nThe border between Quebec and Ontario runs south from the middle of James Bay and then continues south on land.\n*   **The Water Border:** The provincial border within James Bay is a line of longitude at approximately 79°30' W (79.5° W). Waskaganish is at approximately 78.8° W longitude. The shortest distance from Waskaganish to the province of Ontario is a straight line west to this border line in the bay. At this latitude, the distance is approximately 50-55 kilometers (about 31-34 miles).\n*   **The Land Border:** The closest point of Ontario land is on the western and southern shores of James Bay. To reach the land border from Waskaganish would require traveling southwest, a distance significantly greater than the direct westward distance to the border line in the bay.\n\nTherefore, the closest point of Ontario is its border within James Bay.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Proximity of Nunavut**\nThe territory of Nunavut includes all the islands in James Bay. The border of Nunavut is, therefore, the coastline of whichever of its islands is nearest to Waskaganish.\n*   Many islands are scattered throughout James Bay. The largest is Akimiski Island, but it is not the closest.\n*   Smaller islands, such as Spencer Island and Walter Island, are located north-northwest of Waskaganish.\n*   The distance from Waskaganish to the nearest of these islands (the closest point of Nunavut's territory) is approximately 55-60 kilometers (about 34-37 miles).\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Distances and Conclude**\n*   **Distance to Ontario:** The shortest distance is to the provincial border line running through James Bay, which is approximately 50-55 km away.\n*   **Distance to Nunavut:** The shortest distance is to the coast of the nearest island, which is approximately 55-60 km away.\n\nComparing the two, the provincial border of Ontario in James Bay is slightly closer to Waskaganish than the nearest island belonging to Nunavut.\n\n**Careful Points Considered:**\n*   The analysis requires understanding that a province's or territory's border is not just its landmass but also its defined boundary in water.\n*   The specific border definitions (Ontario's longitudinal line in the bay vs. Nunavut's island coastlines) are crucial.\n*   Precise distance calculations confirm that while the distances are very close, the Ontario border has a slight edge.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
