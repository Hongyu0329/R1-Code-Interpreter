    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to derive the analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral and Identify the Dominant Contribution**\n\nThe integral is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\n\nLet the denominator be $D(x, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon + g(x)$, where $g(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. We are interested in the behavior of this integral for very small positive $\\epsilon$.\n\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the integrand $\\frac{1}{D(x, \\epsilon)}$ can become very large. This happens when the term $g(x)$ is also very small. The function $g(x)$ is zero only at $x=0$ in the integration interval $[0, 15.00]$. Therefore, the dominant contribution to the integral for small $\\epsilon$ comes from the region near $x=0$.\n\n**Step 2: Approximate the Integrand for Small x**\n\nNear $x=0$, the function $g(x)$ can be approximated by its term with the lowest power of $x$:\n$g(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0} \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$ for small $x$.\n\nThe integral is therefore dominated by the behavior of:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\delta} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$\nwhere $\\delta$ is a small number. The main contribution to the integral comes from the region where the two terms in the denominator are of the same order of magnitude, i.e., $\\epsilon \\sim 9.0 x^{5.0}$.\n\n**Step 3: Introduce a Scaling Transformation**\n\nThis observation suggests a change of variables to analyze the integral more formally. Let's introduce a new variable $u$ such that the two dominant terms are balanced.\nLet $9.0 x^{5.0} = \\epsilon u^{5.0}$. This leads to the substitution:\n$x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{1/5.0} u = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{0.2} u$\n\nNow, we find the differential $dx$ in terms of $du$:\n$dx = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{0.2} du$\n\nWe also transform the denominator:\nDenominator = $\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$\n$= \\epsilon + 9.0 \\left(\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{0.2} u\\right)^{5.0} + 5.0 \\left(\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{0.2} u\\right)^{6.0} + 9.0 \\left(\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{0.2} u\\right)^{8.0}$\n$= \\epsilon + 9.0 \\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0} u^{5.0} + 5.0 \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{1.2} u^{6.0} + 9.0 \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{1.6} u^{8.0}$\n$= \\epsilon (1 + u^{5.0}) + 5.0 \\frac{\\epsilon^{1.2}}{9.0^{1.2}} u^{6.0} + 9.0 \\frac{\\epsilon^{1.6}}{9.0^{1.6}} u^{8.0}$\n$= \\epsilon \\left( 1 + u^{5.0} + \\frac{5.0}{9.0^{1.2}} \\epsilon^{0.2} u^{6.0} + \\frac{9.0}{9.0^{1.6}} \\epsilon^{0.6} u^{8.0} \\right)$\n\nFinally, we transform the integration limits.\n*   Lower limit: $x=0 \\implies u=0$.\n*   Upper limit: $x=15.00 \\implies u = \\frac{15.00}{(\\epsilon/9.0)^{0.2}} = 15.00 \\left(\\frac{9.0}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{0.2}$.\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0$, this upper limit for $u$ approaches $\\infty$.\n\n**Step 4: Rewrite the Integral and Find the Leading-Order Approximation**\n\nSubstituting everything into the integral:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00 (9.0/\\epsilon)^{0.2}} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{0.2} du}{\\epsilon \\left( 1 + u^{5.0} + \\frac{5.0}{9.0^{1.2}} \\epsilon^{0.2} u^{6.0} + \\dots \\right)}$\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{\\epsilon^{0.2} 9.0^{-0.2}}{\\epsilon} \\int_0^{15.00 (9.0/\\epsilon)^{0.2}} \\frac{du}{1 + u^{5.0} + O(\\epsilon^{0.2})}$\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{9.0^{0.2} \\epsilon^{0.8}} \\int_0^{15.00 (9.0/\\epsilon)^{0.2}} \\frac{du}{1 + u^{5.0} + O(\\epsilon^{0.2})}$\n\nFor the small $\\epsilon$ regime, we can take the limit as $\\epsilon \\to 0$. In this limit:\n1.  The upper integration limit goes to infinity.\n2.  The higher-order terms in the denominator, $O(\\epsilon^{0.2})$, go to zero.\n\nThis gives the leading-order asymptotic approximation for the integral:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{9.0^{0.2} \\epsilon^{0.8}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^{5.0}} du$\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Definite Integral**\n\nThe remaining integral is a standard form related to the Beta function and has a known value:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^p} du = \\frac{\\pi}{p \\sin(\\pi/p)}$\n\nFor our case, $p=5.0$:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^{5.0}} du = \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\sin(\\pi/5.0)}$\n\n**Step 6: Combine Results for the Final Formula**\n\nSubstituting the value of the integral back into our approximation for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{9.0^{0.2} \\epsilon^{0.8}} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\sin(\\pi/5.0)}$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get the final analytical formula:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{0.2} \\sin(\\pi/5.0)} \\epsilon^{-0.8}$\n\nThis formula describes the behavior of the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ for small values of $\\epsilon$. It shows that the integral diverges as $\\epsilon^{-0.8}$ when $\\epsilon$ approaches zero.\n\n<<<I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5.0} \\sin(\\pi/5.0)} \\epsilon^{-4.0/5.0}>>>"
