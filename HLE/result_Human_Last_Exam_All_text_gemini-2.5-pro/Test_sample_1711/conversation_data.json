    "Answering the question requires a multi-step analysis of the group structure and the properties of its subgroups. Here is a detailed breakdown of the steps to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Group G**\n\nThe group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This is an abelian group, which is the direct product of 2024 copies of the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$. The operation is component-wise addition.\n\n**2. Classify the Cyclic Subgroups of G**\n\nA cyclic subgroup is generated by a single element $g \\in G$, denoted as $\\langle g \\rangle$. The order of a cyclic subgroup is equal to the order of its generator.\nThe order of an element $g = (g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_{2024})$ in $G$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components, $ord(g) = \\text{lcm}(ord(g_1), \\dots, ord(g_{2024}))$.\nIn $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$, the order of an element $k$ is $49/\\text{gcd}(k, 49)$. The divisors of 49 are 1, 7, and 49, so these are the only possible orders for elements in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$.\nConsequently, the order of any element in $G$ must be in $\\{1, 7, 49\\}$. This means the cyclic subgroups of $G$ can only have orders 1, 7, or 49.\n\n*   **Order 1:** The trivial subgroup, $\\{0\\}$.\n*   **Order 7:** Subgroups generated by elements of order 7.\n*   **Order 49:** Subgroups generated by elements of order 49.\n\n**3. Simplify the Problem by Analyzing Subgroup Containment**\n\nThe problem is to find a set $A \\subset G$ of minimum size that has a non-empty intersection with every cyclic subgroup of $G$.\n\n*   **The Trivial Subgroup:** To intersect the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$, the set $A$ must contain the zero element. So, $0 \\in A$.\n*   **Relationship between subgroups of order 49 and 7:** Let $H_{49} = \\langle g \\rangle$ be a cyclic subgroup of order 49 (where $ord(g)=49$). Consider the element $h = 7g$. The order of $h$ is $49/7 = 7$. The subgroup $H_7 = \\langle h \\rangle = \\langle 7g \\rangle$ is a cyclic subgroup of order 7. Crucially, every element of $H_7$ is a multiple of $g$, so $H_7$ is a subgroup of $H_{49}$. In fact, it is the unique subgroup of order 7 within $H_{49}$.\n*   **The Key Insight:** If a set $A$ intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7, it must also intersect every cyclic subgroup of order 49. This is because any subgroup of order 49 contains a subgroup of order 7. If an element $a \\in A$ is in this order-7 subgroup, it is also in the parent order-49 subgroup.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the smallest set $A$ such that:\n1.  $0 \\in A$.\n2.  $A$ intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\nLet's define $A = \\{0\\} \\cup A'$, where $A'$ is a set of non-zero elements. The task now is to find the minimum size of $A'$ such that $A'$ intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\n**4. Characterize the Hitting Set A'**\n\nLet $H$ be a cyclic subgroup of order 7. We need $A' \\cap H \\neq \\emptyset$. This means there must be an element $a \\in A'$ such that $a \\in H$. Since $H$ has order 7 (a prime number), any non-zero element in it must have order 7. As $a \\in A'$ implies $a \\neq 0$, the order of $a$ must be 7. This means that the set $A'$ must be composed entirely of elements of order 7.\n\nAn element $a \\in A'$ belongs to exactly one cyclic subgroup of order 7, which is the one it generates, $\\langle a \\rangle$. To intersect a subgroup $H$, one of the elements of $A'$ must generate $H$.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: find the minimum size of a set of generators, one for each cyclic subgroup of order 7. This means the minimum size of $A'$ is precisely the total number of distinct cyclic subgroups of order 7 in $G$.\n\n**5. Count the Cyclic Subgroups of Order 7**\n\nLet's find the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7.\nFirst, consider the set of elements whose order divides 7. This is the subgroup $G[7] = \\{ g \\in G \\mid 7g = 0 \\}$.\nFor an element $g = (g_1, \\dots, g_{2024})$, $7g=0$ means $7g_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49}$ for all $i=1, \\dots, 2024$. This condition holds if and only if $g_i$ is a multiple of 7.\nIn $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$, the multiples of 7 form a subgroup $\\{0, 7, 14, \\dots, 42\\}$, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\nTherefore, $G[7] \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n\nThis subgroup $G[7]$ can be viewed as a vector space, let's call it $V$, of dimension $n=2024$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\nThe elements of order 7 are precisely the non-zero vectors in this vector space $V$.\nA cyclic subgroup of order 7 is generated by an element of order 7. For any $v \\in V \\setminus \\{0\\}$, the subgroup $\\langle v \\rangle$ is $\\{k \\cdot v \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{F}_7\\}$, which is a 1-dimensional subspace of $V$. Conversely, every 1-dimensional subspace of $V$ is a cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\nSo, the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7 is equal to the number of 1-dimensional subspaces of the vector space $V = (\\mathbb{F}_7)^{2024}$.\n\nThe number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $\\frac{q^n - 1}{q-1}$.\nIn our case, $q=7$ and $n=2024$.\nNumber of subgroups of order 7 = $\\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7 - 1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe minimum size of $A'$ is the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7.\n$|A'|_{min} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n\nThe total set is $A = \\{0\\} \\cup A'$. So, the smallest possible size of $A$ is:\n$|A| = |A'|_{min} + 1 = \\left(\\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}\\right) + 1$.\n\nSimplifying this expression:\n$|A| = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1 + 6}{6} = \\frac{7^{2024} + 5}{6}$.\n\nThis number is an integer, since $7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$, so $7^{2024} \\equiv 1^{2024} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$. Then $7^{2024} + 5 \\equiv 1 + 5 \\equiv 6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 6$, which means $7^{2024}+5$ is divisible by 6.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe smallest size of the set $A$ is the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7 plus one (for the trivial subgroup). This is calculated as:\nNumber of cyclic subgroups of order 7 = $\\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\nTotal size of $A$ = $\\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6} + 1 = \\frac{7^{2024}+5}{6}$.\n\n<<<($7^{2024}+5)/6$>>>"
