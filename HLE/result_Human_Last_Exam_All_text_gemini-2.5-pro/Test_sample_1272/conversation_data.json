    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the historical context and key figures.**\n*   **Key Figure:** Mu Sheng (沐晟), a prominent general of the Chinese Ming Dynasty.\n*   **Historical Context:** Mu Sheng was involved in two major campaigns in Vietnam (then known as Jiaozhi or Giao Chỉ to the Ming). The first was the successful Ming invasion of 1406-1407 that overthrew the Hồ Dynasty. The second was the Lam Sơn uprising (1418–1427), a Vietnamese rebellion led by Lê Lợi to oust the Ming occupiers. A \"major defeat\" for a Ming general would most likely have occurred during the latter conflict.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mu Sheng's role in the Lam Sơn Uprising.**\n*   The Ming initially sent other generals like Li An and Chen Zhi to suppress the rebellion. Mu Sheng, as the powerful Duke of Qian and grand defender of Yunnan, was not initially the primary field commander in Jiaozhi.\n*   His major direct involvement came later in the war, specifically in the final, decisive phase in 1427. The Ming Emperor sent two large relief armies to break the Vietnamese siege of the Ming capital, Dongguan (modern Hanoi).\n*   One army, led by Liu Sheng (柳升), advanced from Guangxi. The other, commanded by Mu Sheng, advanced from Yunnan.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the specific event of Mu Sheng's defeat.**\n*   The more famous defeat in this campaign was that of Liu Sheng, who was ambushed and killed at the Battle of Chi Lăng - Xương Giang in Lạng Sơn Province. This was a catastrophic defeat for the Ming, but it was Liu Sheng's defeat, not Mu Sheng's.\n*   Upon hearing the news of Liu Sheng's entire army being annihilated, Mu Sheng's troops, who were advancing along the Thao River (sông Thao), lost their morale.\n*   Lê Lợi then dispatched his generals, Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, to intercept Mu Sheng's demoralized army. They engaged Mu Sheng's forces at several locations.\n*   The decisive engagement where Mu Sheng's army was attacked and routed occurred at **Ải Lãnh Câu (Lãnh Câu Pass)** and **Đan Xá**. The Vietnamese forces inflicted heavy casualties and captured many soldiers and supplies. This defeat, combined with the news of Liu Sheng's fate, was the final blow. Mu Sheng had no choice but to abandon the campaign and retreat back to Yunnan.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the modern-day location of the battle.**\n*   Historical records and geographical analysis place the sites of **Ải Lãnh Câu** and **Đan Xá** in the territory of modern-day **Phú Thọ Province**. Specifically, Lãnh Câu Pass is located in what is now Thanh Ba District of Phú Thọ Province.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude and verify.**\n*   While Mu Sheng had been involved in earlier phases of the war, the 1427 campaign was his most significant command role, and its end was a clear and major defeat. The battles at Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá marked the failure of his mission and the end of the Ming effort to retain control of Vietnam. Therefore, his first major defeat occurred in the area that is now Phú Thọ Province.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to distinguish Mu Sheng's defeat from the more famous defeat of his contemporary, Liu Sheng, which happened in a different province (Lạng Sơn).\n*   The term \"first major defeat\" refers to a significant military failure under his direct command, which the events of 1427 certainly represent, as opposed to minor setbacks or engagements where he was not the primary commander.\n*   The location must be traced from its historical name (Ải Lãnh Câu) to its modern administrative unit (Phú Thọ Province).\n\n<<<Phú Thọ Province>>>"
