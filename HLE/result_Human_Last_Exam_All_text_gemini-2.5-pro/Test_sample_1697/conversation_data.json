    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide core**: A benzene ring attached to a C(=O)N- group.\n*   **N,N-diethyl**: Two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide. This is a tertiary amide, -C(=O)N(Et)₂.\n*   **3-dimethylamino**: A dimethylamino group, -N(CH₃)₂, is attached to position 3 of the benzene ring, assuming the amide group is at position 1.\n\nThe structure has two important functional groups on the benzene ring:\n1.  The N,N-diethylcarboxamido group [-C(=O)N(Et)₂] at position 1.\n2.  The dimethylamino group [-N(Me)₂] at position 3.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Set of Reagents and Reaction**\nThe first step involves reacting the starting material with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and TMEDA in THF.\n*   **sec-BuLi**: This is a very strong organometallic base. Its primary role in this context is to deprotonate an acidic proton on the aromatic ring, a process called lithiation.\n*   **TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine)**: This is a bidentate chelating ligand that coordinates strongly with the lithium cation (Li⁺). This coordination increases the reactivity (basicity) of the sec-butyl anion and helps to stabilize the resulting organolithium intermediate.\n*   **THF (Tetrahydrofuran)**: This is the aprotic polar solvent for the reaction.\n\nThis combination of reagents (a strong lithium base with TMEDA) is characteristic of a **Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM)** reaction. In a DoM reaction, a functional group on the aromatic ring (the \"directing group\") coordinates with the lithium ion and directs the base to remove a proton from the adjacent *ortho* position.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Site of Lithiation (Deprotonation)**\nWe have two potential directing groups on the ring: the amide at C1 and the amine at C3.\n*   **The N,N-diethylcarboxamido group (-C(=O)NEt₂)** is an exceptionally strong directing group for ortho-metalation. The carbonyl oxygen has a lone pair that can chelate the lithium ion, directing deprotonation to its ortho positions (C2 and C6).\n*   **The dimethylamino group (-NMe₂)** is also a directing group, but it is significantly weaker than the tertiary amide group. It directs deprotonation to its ortho positions (C2 and C4).\n\nThe regioselectivity of the reaction is determined by the stronger directing group, which is the **N,N-diethylcarboxamido group**. Therefore, lithiation will occur at either the C2 or C6 position.\n\nTo decide between C2 and C6, we look at the influence of the second group (-NMe₂ at C3).\n*   The **C2 position** is *ortho* to both the strong amide director (at C1) and the weaker amine director (at C3).\n*   The **C6 position** is *ortho* to the strong amide director (at C1) but *para* to the weaker amine director (at C3).\n\nThe deprotonation occurs preferentially at the site that is activated by both directing groups. This is a common phenomenon known as a **cooperative or synergistic effect**. The proton at C2 is significantly more acidic than the one at C6 because it is flanked by two directing groups. The lithium ion can be chelated by both the amide's oxygen and the amine's nitrogen, forming a stable six-membered ring intermediate that greatly favors the removal of the C2 proton.\n\nTherefore, the sec-BuLi will selectively deprotonate the C2 position, forming 2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide as the intermediate.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Second Reagent and Reaction**\nThe second step is the addition of methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n*   **Methyl iodide (CH₃I)** is an electrophile.\n*   The **organolithium intermediate** formed in the first step has a highly nucleophilic carbon atom at the C2 position (where the lithium is attached).\n\nThe reaction is a nucleophilic attack of the C2 carbanion on the methyl group of methyl iodide. This is an Sₙ2 reaction where iodide (I⁻) acts as the leaving group. The lithium atom at C2 is replaced by a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Final Product**\nThe net result of the two-step sequence is the replacement of the hydrogen atom at the C2 position of the starting material with a methyl group.\n*   Starting Material: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n*   Final Product: A methyl group is added at position 2.\n\nThe name of the final product is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
