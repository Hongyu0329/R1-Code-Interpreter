    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Character's Structure**\nThe Japanese character in question is 謄.\nThis character has a left-right structure.\n*   The left component is: 言\n*   The right component is: 滕 without the 氵 (water) radical.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Radical (Bushu)**\nIn Japanese kanji, radicals often provide a clue to the character's general meaning. For characters with a left-right structure, the left-side component is very frequently the radical. This is called a \"hen\" (偏).\n*   The left component, 言, means \"word,\" \"speech,\" or \"to say.\"\n*   The character 謄 means \"to copy\" or \"transcribe,\" which is an action related to words and documents.\nTherefore, 言 is the semantic component and the radical of the character.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Name of the Radical**\nThe radical is 言. In Japanese, radicals have specific names, and these names often change depending on their position within the character.\n*   The base name for the radical 言 is \"gen\" (from its on'yomi) or \"koto\" (from its kun'yomi).\n*   When 言 appears on the left side of a character, it is known by the common name \"gonben\" (ごんべん). The \"gon\" is a voiced version of \"gen,\" and \"ben\" (or \"hen\") means the left-side position.\n\n**Step 4: Convert the Name to Hepburn Transcription**\nThe name of the radical is \"gonben\" (ごんべん). The Hepburn transcription for this is \"Gonben\".\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Distinguishing Similar Characters:** It is important not to confuse 謄 (tō; to copy) with the similar-looking character 騰 (tō; to rise, soar). The character 騰 has a different radical, 月 (tsukihen).\n2.  **Radical Naming Convention:** The question asks for the name of the radical, which in Japanese practice is often its positional name (like -hen, -kanmuri, -kamae, etc.). The example \"Onnahen\" for 媛 confirms that this positional name is what is required, not just the base name \"onna\". Similarly, for 言 on the left, \"Gonben\" is the correct and specific name.\n3.  **Correct Identification:** Verifying with a reliable kanji dictionary confirms that 謄 is classified under the 7-stroke radical 言.\n\nFollowing this analysis, the final answer is the Hepburn transcription of the radical's name.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
