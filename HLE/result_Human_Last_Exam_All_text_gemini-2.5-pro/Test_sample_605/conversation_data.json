    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Definitions\n\nThe question asks for the **Crawley-Nordström invariant** of a Calabi-Yau threefold. This invariant, denoted $c_X$, for a quasismooth hypersurface $X$ in a weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$, is defined as the number of \"lines\" contained within $X$.\n\nA \"line\" in this context is a specific type of rational curve of degree 1. These lines, denoted $L_{ij}$, correspond to the coordinate planes where all but two variables, $z_i$ and $z_j$, are set to zero. For $L_{ij}$ to be a line on the Calabi-Yau hypersurface $X$, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The curve defined by $z_k=0$ for all $k \\notin \\{i,j\\}$ must be a smooth rational curve of degree 1. This is true if and only if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the corresponding weights is 1, i.e., $\\text{gcd}(w_i, w_j) = 1$.\n2.  The line $L_{ij}$ must be entirely contained within the hypersurface $X$. If $X$ is defined by the polynomial equation $F(z_1, \\dots, z_5) = 0$, this means that when we set all $z_k=0$ for $k \\notin \\{i,j\\}$, the polynomial $F$ must become identically zero. This happens if and only if the polynomial $F$ contains no monomials that depend only on the variables $z_i$ and $z_j$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Input Data and Identify Careful Points\n\n**1. Weights and Degree:**\n*   The ambient space is defined by the weights $\\mathbf{w} = (w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n*   For a hypersurface to be Calabi-Yau, its degree $d$ must equal the sum of the weights.\n*   $d = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n\n**2. The Defining Polynomial:**\n*   The given polynomial is $F = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$.\n\n**3. Careful Point: Check for Weighted Homogeneity:**\nA crucial step is to verify that all terms in the polynomial have the same weighted degree, which should be $d=225$.\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_1^8z_3) = 8(22) + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$. (Correct)\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_1^4z_2^3z_3) = 4(22) + 3(29) + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$. (**Incorrect**)\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_1z_2^7) = 1(22) + 7(29) = 22 + 203 = 225$. (Correct)\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5) = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$. (Correct)\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_2z_3^4) = 29 + 4(49) = 29 + 196 = 225$. (Correct)\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_4^3z_5) = 3(50) + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$. (Correct)\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_5^3) = 3(75) = 225$. (Correct)\n\nThe term $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ has the wrong degree. This means the given polynomial does not define a weighted homogeneous variety. This is likely a typo in the problem statement. To proceed, we must assume that the Calabi-Yau is defined by the other, correctly-weighted terms. This term, being a multi-variable term, would not affect the line counting anyway, but it's critical to note this discrepancy.\n\n**Let's proceed with the corrected polynomial:**\n$F_{CY} = z_1^8z_3 + z_1z_2^7 + z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5 + z_2z_3^4 + z_4^3z_5 + z_5^3$.\n\nThe set of monomials involving only two (or fewer) variables are:\n*   $z_1^8z_3$ (depends on $\\{z_1, z_3\\}$)\n*   $z_1z_2^7$ (depends on $\\{z_1, z_2\\}$)\n*   $z_2z_3^4$ (depends on $\\{z_2, z_3\\}$)\n*   $z_4^3z_5$ (depends on $\\{z_4, z_5\\}$)\n*   $z_5^3$ (depends on $\\{z_5\\}$)\n\n### Step 3: Systematically Check All Pairs of Variables\n\nWe will now check all $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ pairs of variables $(z_i, z_j)$ against the two conditions.\n\n| Pair (i, j) | Weights ($w_i, w_j$) | gcd($w_i, w_j$) | Condition 1: gcd=1? | Condition 2: Any monomial in $F_{CY}$ with variables $\\subseteq \\{z_i, z_j\\}$? | Line on X? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| (1, 2) | (22, 29) | 1 | Yes | Yes ($z_1z_2^7$) | No |\n| (1, 3) | (22, 49) | 1 | Yes | Yes ($z_1^8z_3$) | No |\n| (1, 4) | (22, 50) | 2 | No | - | No |\n| (1, 5) | (22, 75) | 1 | Yes | Yes ($z_5^3$) | No |\n| (2, 3) | (29, 49) | 1 | Yes | Yes ($z_2z_3^4$) | No |\n| (2, 4) | (29, 50) | 1 | Yes | No | **Yes** |\n| (2, 5) | (29, 75) | 1 | Yes | Yes ($z_5^3$) | No |\n| (3, 4) | (49, 50) | 1 | Yes | No | **Yes** |\n| (3, 5) | (49, 75) | 1 | Yes | Yes ($z_5^3$) | No |\n| (4, 5) | (50, 75) | 25 | No | - | No |\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nWe sum the number of lines found in the previous step.\n*   A line $L_{24}$ exists because $\\text{gcd}(w_2, w_4) = \\text{gcd}(29, 50) = 1$ and the polynomial $F_{CY}$ has no terms involving only $z_2$ and $z_4$.\n*   A line $L_{34}$ exists because $\\text{gcd}(w_3, w_4) = \\text{gcd}(49, 50) = 1$ and the polynomial $F_{CY}$ has no terms involving only $z_3$ and $z_4$.\n\nThe total number of lines on the hypersurface is $1 + 1 = 2$.\nTherefore, the Crawley-Nordström invariant is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
