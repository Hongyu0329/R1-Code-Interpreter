    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Source:** The online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n*   **Specific Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n*   **Event:** Junior prom.\n*   **Object:** A cardboard cutout.\n*   **Subject:** A fictional singer who is \"performing\".\n*   **Goal:** To find the name of this fictional singer.\n\n**Step 2: Recall or Research the Specific Scene**\nTo answer the question, we need to analyze the specific scene from \"Teen Girl Squad #15\". In this episode, the girls are excited to attend their Junior prom.\n\n*   Cheerleader exclaims, \"And look who's performing!\"\n*   The scene then cuts to the \"live entertainment\".\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Performer**\nThe \"performer\" is not an animated character but a static, crudely drawn cardboard cutout of a man with a guitar. This is a joke about the low quality of the prom.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Name of the Fictional Singer**\nA caption appears on the screen to identify the cutout.\n\n*   The caption explicitly reads: \"Live performance by... KERT!!!!!\"\n*   The Teen Girl Squad characters then chant his name.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Fictional vs. Real:** The question specifically asks for a *fictional* singer. Kert is a character created for the cartoon and does not exist in real life.\n*   **Cardboard Cutout:** The question correctly notes that it is a cardboard cutout, not a live or animated performance. This detail is central to the joke in the episode.\n*   **Spelling and Stylization:** The name is spelled K-E-R-T. In the cartoon, it is written with multiple exclamation points (\"KERT!!!!!\"), but the name itself is \"Kert\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the visual evidence and text within \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", the fictional singer whose cardboard cutout is performing at the Junior prom is named Kert.\n\n<<<Kert"
