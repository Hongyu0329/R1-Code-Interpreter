    "An analysis of the problem is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Define the product and check for convergence.**\nThe problem asks to evaluate the infinite product:\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) $$\nThis is a product of the form $\\prod (1+a_n)$ with $a_n = -z^3/n^3$. The product converges absolutely if the series $\\sum |a_n|$ converges. The series is $\\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty} |-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}| = |z|^3 \\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3}$. This is a p-series with $p=3$, which is greater than 1, so the series converges. Consequently, the infinite product converges absolutely for all complex numbers $z$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to a more standard form starting from n=1.**\nLet $P_{full}$ be the product starting from $n=1$:\n$$ P_{full} = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) $$\nWe can relate our product $P$ to $P_{full}$ by separating the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$:\n$$ P_{full} = \\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right) \\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right) \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = (1-z^3)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{8}\\right) P $$\nThus, we can find $P$ if we find a closed form for $P_{full}$:\n$$ P = \\frac{P_{full}}{(1-z^3)(1-z^3/8)} $$\n\n**Step 3: Factor the general term of the product.**\nThe term $(1 - z^3/n^3)$ can be factored as a difference of cubes. The cube roots of 1 are $1, \\omega, \\omega^2$, where $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$ is a primitive cube root of unity.\nThe factorization is $1-x^3 = (1-x)(1-\\omega x)(1-\\omega^2 x)$. Let $x = z/n$.\n$$ 1 - \\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right) $$\n\n**Step 4: Express P_full using the factorization and the Weierstrass product for the Gamma function.**\nSubstituting the factorization into the expression for $P_{full}$:\n$$ P_{full} = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right) \\right] $$\nWhile the overall product converges, individual products like $\\prod (1-z/n)$ diverge. To handle this, we introduce convergence factors. A key observation is that the sum of the cube roots of unity is zero: $1+\\omega+\\omega^2=0$. This implies that the product of the necessary convergence factors is 1:\n$$ e^{z/n} \\cdot e^{\\omega z/n} \\cdot e^{\\omega^2 z/n} = e^{(1+\\omega+\\omega^2)z/n} = e^0 = 1 $$\nWe can insert this into the product without changing its value:\n$$ P_{full} = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)e^{z/n} \\right] \\left[ \\left(1-\\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right)e^{\\omega z/n} \\right] \\left[ \\left(1-\\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right)e^{\\omega^2 z/n} \\right] $$\nSince each of the three products in the square brackets now converges absolutely, we can separate them:\n$$ P_{full} = \\left[\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)e^{z/n}\\right] \\left[\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1-\\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right)e^{\\omega z/n}\\right] \\left[\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1-\\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right)e^{\\omega^2 z/n}\\right] $$\nWe use the Weierstrass product representation related to the Gamma function:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1-\\frac{x}{n}\\right)e^{x/n} = \\frac{e^{\\gamma x}}{\\Gamma(1-x)} $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. Applying this to our three products (with $x=z$, $x=\\omega z$, $x=\\omega^2 z$):\n$$ P_{full} = \\left(\\frac{e^{\\gamma z}}{\\Gamma(1-z)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{e^{\\gamma \\omega z}}{\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{e^{\\gamma \\omega^2 z}}{\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)}\\right) $$\n\n**Step 5: Simplify the expression for P_full.**\nCombine the terms in the numerator:\n$$ P_{full} = \\frac{e^{\\gamma z + \\gamma \\omega z + \\gamma \\omega^2 z}}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} = \\frac{e^{\\gamma z(1+\\omega+\\omega^2)}}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\nUsing $1+\\omega+\\omega^2=0$, the numerator becomes $e^0=1$.\n$$ P_{full} = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final answer.**\nSubstitute the expression for $P_{full}$ back into the equation for $P$:\n$$ P = \\frac{P_{full}}{(1-z^3)(1-z^3/8)} = \\frac{1}{(1-z^3)(1-z^3/8)\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\nThis is the final expression for the given infinite product.\n\n**Careful points to note:**\n1.  The starting index of the product is $n=3$, which means the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$ must be handled separately.\n2.  Absolute convergence of the product is crucial, as it justifies the rearrangement of terms after introducing convergence factors.\n3.  The factorization of $1-x^3$ using roots of unity is the key algebraic step.\n4.  The property $1+\\omega+\\omega^2=0$ is essential, as it causes the convergence factors and the exponential terms involving $\\gamma$ to cancel out, leading to a much simpler result.\n5.  Using the correct form of the Weierstrass product for the Gamma function is critical for the derivation.\n6.  A consistency check confirms the result: the zeros of the final expression are at $z=n, n\\omega, n\\omega^2$ for $n \\ge 3$, which exactly match the values of $z$ for which the terms in the original product become zero.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe final expression for the infinite product is:\n$$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{(1-z^3)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{8}\\right)\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\nwhere $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$ is a primitive cube root of unity and $\\Gamma$ is the Gamma function.\n\n<<<>>>\n$$ \\frac{1}{(1-z^3)(1-\\frac{z^3}{8})\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-e^{i2\\pi/3}z)\\Gamma(1-e^{i4\\pi/3}z)} $$"
