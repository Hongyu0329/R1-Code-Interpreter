    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons) using large deviation theorems.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understanding the System and Theoretical Framework**\n\n*   **System:** We are considering a gas of light quanta (photons) in thermal equilibrium inside a cavity of volume `V` at a temperature `T`.\n*   **Photon Properties (Bose case):**\n    *   Photons are bosons, so they obey Bose-Einstein statistics. Multiple photons can occupy the same energy state.\n    *   They are indistinguishable.\n    *   The total number of photons is not conserved. This is a critical feature, which implies that their chemical potential `μ` is zero.\n*   **Large Deviation Theorems:**\n    *   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem provides a rigorous foundation for the principle of maximum entropy in statistical mechanics. It states that the probability of a system's empirical distribution deviating from the equilibrium distribution is exponentially small. The equilibrium distribution is the one that maximizes the entropy (`S = k_B ln W`, where W is the number of microstates) subject to macroscopic constraints (like fixed average energy). Finding this distribution is equivalent to finding the equilibrium state.\n    *   **Cramér-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem quantifies the probability of large deviations of a sample mean from its expected value. For a thermodynamic system, we can apply it to the total energy, which is a sum of energies from many microscopic degrees of freedom. The theorem connects the system's partition function to the cumulant generating function of the energy, from which the mean energy and other moments can be derived.\n\nBoth theorems essentially justify the use of the grand canonical ensemble for this system, where the equilibrium state is found by analyzing the grand partition function `Ξ`.\n\n**2. The Grand Partition Function (Ξ)**\n\nFor a system of non-interacting bosons with chemical potential `μ=0`, the grand partition function is the product of partition functions for each individual energy level `ε_i`. Since any number of photons (`n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...`) can occupy a level `ε_i`, the partition function for that level is a geometric series:\n\n`Z_i = Σ_{n_i=0 to ∞} exp(-n_i ε_i / (k_B T)) = 1 / (1 - exp(-ε_i / (k_B T)))`\n\nThe total grand partition function `Ξ` is the product over all possible energy levels:\n\n`Ξ = Π_i Z_i = Π_i [1 / (1 - exp(-ε_i / (k_B T)))]`\n\nLet `β = 1 / (k_B T)`. Then `ln(Ξ) = - Σ_i ln(1 - exp(-β ε_i))`.\n\n**3. Converting Sums to Integrals**\n\nFor a macroscopic system, the energy levels are quasi-continuous. We replace the sum `Σ_i` with an integral over energy `∫ g(ε) dε`, where `g(ε)` is the density of states. For photons in a 3D box of volume `V`, considering two polarization states, the density of states is:\n\n`g(ε)dε = (8πV / (h^3 c^3)) ε^2 dε`\nwhere `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**4. Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy (U or ⟨E⟩)**\n\nThe mean energy `U` is derived from the grand partition function:\n\n`U = -∂/∂β (ln Ξ)`\n\n*   **From the Cramér-Chernoff perspective:** The cumulant generating function for the energy `E` is `K_E(t) = ln(E[e^{tE}]) = ln(Ξ(β-t)) - ln(Ξ(β))`. The mean energy is `U = K_E'(0) = -∂/∂β (ln Ξ)`. Thus, both approaches lead to the same calculation.\n\n`U = -∂/∂β [-∫₀^∞ g(ε) ln(1 - exp(-β ε)) dε]`\n`U = ∫₀^∞ g(ε) * [ε exp(-β ε) / (1 - exp(-β ε))] dε`\n`U = ∫₀^∞ g(ε) * [ε / (exp(β ε) - 1)] dε`\n\nSubstituting the density of states `g(ε)`:\n`U = ∫₀^∞ (8πV / (h^3 c^3)) ε^2 * [ε / (exp(β ε) - 1)] dε`\n`U = (8πV / (h^3 c^3)) ∫₀^∞ ε^3 / (exp(β ε) - 1) dε`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `x = β ε`, so `ε = x/β` and `dε = dx/β`:\n`U = (8πV / (h^3 c^3)) * (1/β^4) ∫₀^∞ x^3 / (e^x - 1) dx`\n\nThe definite integral is a standard form related to the Riemann Zeta function: `∫₀^∞ x^3 / (e^x - 1) dx = Γ(4)ζ(4) = 3! * (π^4/90) = π^4/15`.\n\nSubstituting this back:\n`U = (8πV / (h^3 c^3)) * (k_B T)^4 * (π^4 / 15)`\n`U = (8π^5 V k_B^4 / (15 h^3 c^3)) T^4`\n\nThis is the famous Stefan-Boltzmann Law for the energy of black-body radiation.\n\n**5. Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy (S)**\n\nEntropy `S` is related to the energy `U` and the grand potential `Ω = -k_B T ln(Ξ)`. The fundamental thermodynamic relation for a system with `μ=0` is `Ω = U - TS`. Therefore:\n\n`S = (U - Ω) / T = U/T + k_B ln(Ξ)`\n\n*   **From the Boltzmann-Sanov perspective:** This formula for entropy arises directly from maximizing the statistical entropy `-k_B Σ p_i ln p_i` subject to the energy constraint. This maximum entropy value corresponds to the equilibrium state.\n\nFirst, we calculate `Ω`:\n`Ω = -k_B T ln(Ξ) = -k_B T [-∫₀^∞ g(ε) ln(1 - exp(-β ε)) dε]`\n`Ω = k_B T * (8πV / (h^3 c^3)) ∫₀^∞ ε^2 ln(1 - exp(-β ε)) dε`\n\nUsing the same substitution `x = β ε` and integrating by parts, one can show that the integral `∫₀^∞ x^2 ln(1 - e^-x) dx = -π^4 / 45`.\n`Ω = k_B T * (8πV / (h^3 c^3)) * (1/β^3) * (-π^4 / 45)`\n`Ω = -(8π^5 V k_B^4 / (45 h^3 c^3)) T^4`\n\nNotice that `Ω = -U/3`. This is a characteristic property of a relativistic gas like a photon gas.\n\nNow we find the entropy `S`:\n`S = (U - Ω) / T = (U - (-U/3)) / T = (4U/3) / T`\n\nSubstituting the expression for `U`:\n`S = (4/3T) * [(8π^5 V k_B^4 / (15 h^3 c^3)) T^4]`\n`S = (32π^5 V k_B^4 / (45 h^3 c^3)) T^3`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for the mean energy `U` and entropy `S` of a photon gas (Bose case) in a volume `V` at temperature `T` are:\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\n`U = (8π^5 V k_B^4 / (15 h^3 c^3)) T^4`\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy:**\n`S = (32π^5 V k_B^4 / (45 h^3 c^3)) T^3`\n\nwhere:\n*   `V` is the volume of the system.\n*   `T` is the absolute temperature.\n*   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `h` is the Planck constant.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Mean Energy: U = (8π^5 V k_B^4 / (15 h^3 c^3)) T^4\nEquilibrium Entropy: S = (32π^5 V k_B^4 / (45 h^3 c^3)) T^3\n>>>"
