The formula for the fermionic partition function $Z$ in the imaginary time representation using Feynmanâ€™s path integral formalism is given by:
$Z = \int \mathcal{D}[\bar{\psi}, \psi] \exp(-S[\bar{\psi}, \psi])$
where:
1.  $\int \mathcal{D}[\bar{\psi}, \psi]$ is the functional integral over all paths of the independent Grassmann fields $\bar{\psi}(\tau)$ and $\psi(\tau)$.
2.  $S[\bar{\psi}, \psi]$ is the Euclidean action, defined as:
    $S[\bar{\psi}, \psi] = \int_0^\beta d\tau \left[ \sum_i \bar{\psi}_i(\tau) \partial_\tau \psi_i(\tau) + H(\bar{\psi}(\tau), \psi(\tau)) \right]$
    *   $\tau$ is the imaginary time, integrated from $0$ to $\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.
    *   $\bar{\psi}_i(\tau)$ and $\psi_i(\tau)$ are the Grassmann fields corresponding to the creation and annihilation operators of a fermion in state $i$.
    *   $H(\bar{\psi}, \psi)$ is the classical Hamiltonian functional, obtained by replacing the creation ($\hat{c}_i^\dagger$) and annihilation ($\hat{c}_i$) operators in the normal-ordered quantum Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ with the fields $\bar{\psi}_i$ and $\psi_i$, respectively.
3.  The integral is performed subject to **anti-periodic boundary conditions** for the Grassmann fields:
    $\psi_i(\beta) = -\psi_i(0)$
    $\bar{\psi}_i(\beta) = -\bar{\psi}_i(0)$
