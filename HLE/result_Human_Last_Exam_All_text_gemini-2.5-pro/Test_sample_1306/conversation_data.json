    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Algebra and the Category\nThe question is about the representation theory of the quantum group $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$, which we'll denote as $U_q$, where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity (i.e., $\\ell=3$). The category $C$ consists of the isomorphism classes of indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of this algebra. We need to find what percentage of these objects are irreducible.\n\n### Step 2: The Center of $U_q$ and Block Decomposition\nWhen $q$ is a root of unity, the algebra $U_q$ has a large center. The elements $E^\\ell, F^\\ell, K^\\ell$ are central (here $\\ell=3$). In any indecomposable finite-dimensional representation, central elements must act as scalars by Schur's Lemma. Let $V$ be such a representation, then $E^3|_V = \\alpha \\cdot \\text{Id}$, $F^3|_V = \\beta \\cdot \\text{Id}$, and $K^3|_V = \\gamma \\cdot \\text{Id}$ for some scalars $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of $K$ on a finite-dimensional representation must be of the form $\\pm q^k$ for integers $k$. Thus, the eigenvalue of $K^3$ must be $(\\pm q^k)^3 = (\\pm 1)^3(q^3)^k = \\pm 1$. So, $\\gamma \\in \\{1, -1\\}$.\n\nThis allows us to decompose the category of all finite-dimensional representations, $\\text{Rep}(U_q)$, into a direct sum of smaller categories (blocks), indexed by the central characters $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)$:\n$$ \\text{Rep}(U_q) = \\bigoplus_{(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma) \\in \\mathbb{C}^2 \\times \\{\\pm 1\\}} C_{(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)} $$\nAn object of $C$ must belong to one of these blocks.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Blocks: Semisimple vs. Non-semisimple\nA crucial result in the representation theory of $U_q$ at a root of unity is the following:\n*   The block $C_{(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)}$ is **semisimple** if and only if $(\\alpha, \\beta) \\neq (0,0)$.\n*   The block $C_{(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)}$ is **not semisimple** if and only if $(\\alpha, \\beta) = (0,0)$.\n\nLet's analyze these two cases.\n\n**Case 1: Semisimple Blocks $(\\alpha, \\beta) \\neq (0,0)$**\nA category being semisimple means that every object is a direct sum of simple (i.e., irreducible) objects. For an indecomposable object, this means it cannot be a direct sum of two non-trivial submodules. Therefore, in a semisimple category, **every indecomposable object is irreducible**.\n\nFor almost all choices of parameters $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)$ with $(\\alpha, \\beta) \\neq (0,0)$, the block $C_{(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)}$ is non-empty. It contains irreducible representations of dimension $\\ell=3$, often called semi-cyclic representations. The set of parameters $(\\alpha, \\beta) \\neq (0,0)$ forms a 2-dimensional complex space (the plane $\\mathbb{C}^2$ minus the origin).\n\nSo, for the vast majority of blocks, 100% of indecomposable objects are irreducible.\n\n**Case 2: Non-semisimple Blocks $(\\alpha, \\beta) = (0,0)$**\nThese are the blocks $C_{(0,0,1)}$ and $C_{(0,0,-1)}$. The representations in these blocks are those where $E^3=0$ and $F^3=0$.\n*   The block $C_{(0,0,-1)}$ turns out to have no finite-dimensional representations. Any finite-dimensional representation must have a highest weight vector $v_0$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda$. The weights are of the form $\\lambda q^{-2k}$. For $K^3$ to act as $-1$, we'd need $\\lambda^3 = -1$. But for representations with $E^3=0, F^3=0$, the highest weights are of the form $\\pm q^m$, for which $\\lambda^3 = (\\pm q^m)^3 = \\pm 1$. A more detailed analysis shows that only $\\lambda^3=1$ is possible.\n*   The block $C_{(0,0,1)}$ consists of representations where $E^3=0, F^3=0, K^3=1$. This is precisely the category of representations of the **small quantum group** $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. For $\\ell=3$, this algebra is known to be of **tame representation type**.\n\n### Step 4: Objects in the Tame Block $C_{(0,0,1)}$\nBeing of tame type means that the indecomposable modules can be classified, and there are infinite families of them.\n*   **Irreducible objects:** There are $\\ell=3$ irreducible modules in this block, commonly denoted $L_0, L_1, L_2$, with dimensions 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n*   **Indecomposable objects:** The set of indecomposable objects includes the three irreducible ones ($L_0, L_1, L_2$). However, because the category is not semisimple, there are many indecomposable modules that are not irreducible. For instance, the projective covers of $L_0$ and $L_1$ are indecomposable but not irreducible. More importantly, tame representation type implies the existence of one-parameter families of indecomposable modules (called \"band modules\"). These families are indexed by $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^* \\cong \\mathbb{C}P^1 \\setminus \\{2 \\text{ points}\\}$.\n\nSo, in the block $C_{(0,0,1)}$, there are only **3** irreducible objects but **infinitely many** indecomposable objects. The percentage of irreducibles in this block is $3/\\infty$, which is effectively 0%.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Overall Percentage\nWe need to find the percentage for the entire category $C$, which is the union of all indecomposable objects from all blocks.\nLet $I$ be the set of all indecomposable objects and $S$ be the set of all irreducible objects.\n$$ I = \\left(\\bigcup_{(\\alpha, \\beta) \\neq (0,0)} I_{(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)}\\right) \\cup I_{(0,0,1)} $$\n$$ S = \\left(\\bigcup_{(\\alpha, \\beta) \\neq (0,0)} S_{(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)}\\right) \\cup S_{(0,0,1)} $$\nFrom our analysis:\n*   In the semisimple part, $I_{(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)} = S_{(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)}$. This set of objects is parameterized by a 2-dimensional complex space, $(\\alpha, \\beta) \\in \\mathbb{C}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$.\n*   In the non-semisimple part, $S_{(0,0,1)}$ is a finite set of 3 objects, while $I_{(0,0,1)}$ is an infinite set containing families parameterized by a 1-dimensional complex space.\n\nThe question asks for $|S|/|I|$. Both sets are infinite. To make sense of \"percentage,\" we can compare the dimensions of the parameter spaces that classify the objects.\n*   The set of all irreducible representations is dominated by those from the semisimple blocks, which are parameterized by a **2-dimensional** space.\n*   The set of all indecomposable representations consists of those from the semisimple blocks (parameterized by a 2D space) plus those from the tame block. The new indecomposable representations that are not irreducible arise only in the tame block, and their families are parameterized by a **1-dimensional** space.\n\nWhen we combine these sets, the objects parameterized by the 2D space vastly \"outnumber\" those parameterized by the 1D space. A 1D space has \"measure zero\" inside a 2D space. Therefore, the non-irreducible indecomposable objects form a negligible fraction of the total set of indecomposable objects.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe property of an indecomposable module being irreducible holds for all modules in the blocks parameterized by the 2D space $\\mathbb{C}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$. It only fails for the single point $(0,0)$ in this parameter space. In this sense, the property holds \"generically\". Thus, 100% of the objects of $C$ are irreducible."
