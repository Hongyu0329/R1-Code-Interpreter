    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Object and the Goal**\n\n*   **Object:** $X$ is a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ defined by a single homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n*   **Properties:**\n    *   Since it is in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, $X$ is a complex variety of dimension 2 (a complex surface).\n    *   As a real manifold, its dimension is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    *   The property \"smooth\" means it is a complex manifold, and therefore a smooth, compact, orientable real 4-manifold.\n*   **Goal:** We need to find the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$. The rank of an abelian group is the dimension of its free part, or equivalently, the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring the group with $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**2. Relate Homotopy Groups to Homology Groups**\n\nComputing homotopy groups directly is very difficult. The standard strategy is to relate them to homology groups, which are more computable. The Hurewicz theorem provides this connection.\n\n*   **Simple Connectivity of X:** We first need to determine the first homotopy group, $\\pi_1(X)$. The **Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem** is the key tool here. For a smooth hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n)$ for $k < n-1$.\n    *   In our case, $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^3$, so $n=3$. The theorem implies that $i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is an isomorphism for $k < 3-1=2$.\n    *   For $k=1$, we have $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$.\n    *   The complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is known to be simply connected for all $n \\ge 1$. Thus, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. This means $X$ is simply connected.\n\n*   **The Hurewicz Isomorphism $\\pi_3(X) \\cong H_3(X)$:**\n    *   Since $X$ is simply connected, we can use results that relate higher homotopy and homology groups.\n    *   For any simply connected space $X$, there exists a natural short exact sequence:\n        $$ \\pi_2(X) \\wedge \\pi_2(X) \\xrightarrow{w} \\pi_3(X) \\xrightarrow{h_3} H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0 $$\n        where $h_3$ is the Hurewicz homomorphism and the map $w$ is given by the Whitehead product.\n    *   To understand the first term, we need to know $\\pi_2(X)$. The Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem for $k=2$ does not give an isomorphism, but rather a surjection. However, the stronger version of the theorem (or a direct application of the long exact sequence of the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$) shows that for $k=2=n-1$, the kernel of $\\pi_2(X) \\to \\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is trivial, so $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$.\n    *   From the long exact sequence of the fibration $S^1 \\to S^7 \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$, we know $\\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   So, we have $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   Now we analyze the term $\\pi_2(X) \\wedge \\pi_2(X)$. The exterior product of an abelian group $A$ with itself is defined as $A \\wedge A = (A \\otimes A) / \\langle a \\otimes a \\mid a \\in A \\rangle$.\n    *   For $A = \\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, we have $\\mathbb{Z} \\wedge \\mathbb{Z} = (\\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}) / \\langle 1 \\otimes 1 \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z} / \\mathbb{Z} = 0$.\n    *   The first group in the exact sequence is the trivial group. This implies the map $w$ is the zero map.\n    *   The exact sequence simplifies to:\n        $$ 0 \\to \\pi_3(X) \\xrightarrow{h_3} H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0 $$\n    *   This means the Hurewicz map $h_3$ is an isomorphism: $\\pi_3(X) \\cong H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n*   **Conclusion of this step:** The problem of finding the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is now reduced to finding the rank of the third homology group $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, which is the third Betti number, $b_3(X)$.\n\n**3. Compute the Betti Number $b_3(X)$**\n\nWe use standard tools from algebraic topology and algebraic geometry to compute $b_3(X)$.\n\n*   **Poincaré Duality:** Since $X$ is a compact, oriented, real 4-manifold, Poincaré duality holds for its Betti numbers: $b_k(X) = b_{4-k}(X)$.\n    *   For $k=3$, this gives $b_3(X) = b_{4-3}(X) = b_1(X)$.\n    *   So, we need to find the first Betti number, $b_1(X)$.\n\n*   **Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem on Homology:** The homology version of the Lefschetz theorem states that the inclusion $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms $i_*: H_k(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n, \\mathbb{Z})$ for $k < n-1$.\n    *   Again, with $n=3$, this holds for $k<2$.\n    *   For $k=1$, it gives an isomorphism $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    *   The homology of complex projective space is well known: $H_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n, \\mathbb{Z})$ is $\\mathbb{Z}$ for $k$ even and $0 \\le k \\le 2n$, and 0 otherwise. Thus, $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n    *   This implies $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\n*   **Calculation of $b_3(X)$:**\n    *   The rank of $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the first Betti number, $b_1(X)$. Since the group is trivial, its rank is 0. So, $b_1(X) = 0$.\n    *   From Poincaré duality, we have $b_3(X) = b_1(X) = 0$.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have established the following chain of reasoning:\n1.  The rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is equal to the rank of $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, which is $b_3(X)$. This is because $\\pi_3(X) \\cong H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n2.  The Betti number $b_3(X)$ is equal to $b_1(X)$ by Poincaré Duality.\n3.  The Betti number $b_1(X)$ is 0 by the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem.\n\nTherefore, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is 0. This means that $\\pi_3(X)$ is a torsion group. In fact, our argument showed that $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the trivial group, which implies $\\pi_3(X)$ is also the trivial group.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
