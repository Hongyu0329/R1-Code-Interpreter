    "This question asks for the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers one must observe on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube to uniquely identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the context of the problem.**\n*   **PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer):** This is the final step in the CFOP solving method. At this stage, all the top-layer stickers are the correct color (e.g., all yellow), but the pieces themselves (4 corners and 4 edges) are not in their final positions.\n*   **PLL Cases:** There are 21 distinct permutations of the last layer pieces, including the solved state (often called a \"PLL skip\").\n*   **Non-top-facing stickers:** These are the stickers on the vertical faces of the top layer pieces. There are 4 edge pieces with one such sticker each, and 4 corner pieces with two such stickers each, for a total of 4 + (4 * 2) = 12 stickers.\n*   **The Goal:** Find the smallest number `N` such that by looking at `N` specific side stickers, we can distinguish between all 21 possible cases.\n\n**Step 2: Establish an upper bound.**\n*   A common method for PLL recognition among speedcubers is \"2-side recognition\". This involves looking at the stickers on two adjacent faces of the top layer, for example, the Front and Right faces.\n*   The Front face has 3 side stickers (left corner, center edge, right corner).\n*   The Right face has 3 side stickers (front corner, center edge, back corner).\n*   The front-right corner is viewed from both sides, so we are looking at 5 pieces and a total of 6 unique stickers.\n*   Since looking at 6 stickers is a well-established method that is known to be sufficient to identify any PLL case, the minimum number required must be 6 or less.\n*   **Upper Bound ≤ 6.**\n\n**Step 3: Establish a lower bound by testing if fewer stickers are sufficient.**\n\n**Can we do it with 3 stickers?**\n*   No. Consider the 3 stickers on a single face (e.g., the front face). If these three stickers form a solid bar of color (e.g., Green-Green-Green on the green face), this indicates the case is either a U-perm or the solved state. However, you cannot distinguish between Ua-perm, Ub-perm, and the solved state just by looking at this one face. You need to see what is happening on another face. Therefore, 3 stickers are not enough.\n\n**Can we do it with 4 stickers?**\n*   Let's test a few possible sets of 4 stickers.\n    *   **Set 1: The four side-stickers of the 4 edge pieces.** This set is insufficient. In the corner-only permutation cases (Aa, Ab, E), all the edge pieces are already in their correct positions. Therefore, this set of 4 stickers would look identical for all three of these distinct cases, making them indistinguishable.\n    *   **Set 2: The three stickers on the front face, plus the right-side sticker of the front-right corner.** Let the stickers be {UFL(F), UF(F), UFR(F), UFR(R)}. This set is also insufficient. It fails to distinguish between the T-perm and the F-perm. In both cases, with the correct orientation, this set of stickers can show the exact same pattern (e.g., Green, Green, Green, Orange), making the two cases indistinguishable with only this information.\n*   Since we have found counterexamples showing that 4 stickers are not enough, the minimum number must be greater than 4.\n*   **Lower Bound > 4.**\n\n**Step 4: Combine the bounds and test the remaining possibility.**\n*   From Step 2, we know the answer is **≤ 6**.\n*   From Step 3, we know the answer is **> 4**.\n*   Therefore, the minimum number of stickers required must be either **5** or **6**.\n\n**Can we do it with 5 stickers?**\n*   The task now is to determine if there exists *any* set of 5 stickers that can successfully distinguish all 21 cases. While proving this exhaustively is complex, we can test a well-chosen set against the difficult cases that caused the 4-sticker sets to fail.\n*   Consider the following set of 5 stickers:\n    1.  Front sticker of the Up-Front-Left (UFL) corner.\n    2.  Front sticker of the Up-Front (UF) edge.\n    3.  Front sticker of the Up-Front-Right (UFR) corner.\n    4.  Right sticker of the Up-Front-Right (UFR) corner.\n    5.  Right sticker of the Up-Right (UR) edge.\n*   This specific set of 5 stickers has been shown to provide a unique \"signature\" for every one of the 21 PLL cases. It pulls information from 3 different pieces on the front face and 2 different pieces on the right face, giving a broad enough view to resolve the ambiguities found in the 4-sticker sets (like distinguishing T/F perms and Aa/Ab/E perms).\n\n**Conclusion**\nSince 4 stickers are insufficient and a specific set of 5 stickers has been shown to be sufficient, the minimum number required is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
