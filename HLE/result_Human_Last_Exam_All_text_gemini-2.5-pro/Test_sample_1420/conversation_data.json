    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis and Careful Points\n\n**1. Understand the Goal and the Method**\nThe question asks for the value of the specific heat critical exponent, denoted by $\\alpha$, for a physical system in a spatial dimension of $d=3$. The method specified is the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion, a cornerstone of the Renormalization Group (RG) theory.\n\n**2. Define the Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) Expansion**\nThe epsilon expansion is a perturbative technique used to calculate critical exponents. It works by performing calculations in a dimension $d$ that is slightly below the *upper critical dimension*, $d_c$. The expansion parameter is defined as:\n$\\epsilon = d_c - d$\nThe exponents are then expressed as a power series in $\\epsilon$.\n\n**3. Determine the Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$)**\nFor a vast majority of common continuous phase transitions (like magnetism in the Ising or Heisenberg models, or the liquid-gas transition), the system is described by a Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson (LGW) theory with a $\\phi^4$ interaction term. For such theories, the upper critical dimension is:\n$d_c = 4$\nAbove this dimension, the critical exponents take on the values predicted by the simpler mean-field theory.\n\n**4. Calculate the Value of $\\epsilon$**\nThe problem specifies a spatial dimension $d=3$. Using the values from the previous steps:\n$\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1$\n*   **Careful Point:** The $\\epsilon$-expansion is formally an asymptotic series that works best for $\\epsilon \\ll 1$. Using it for $d=3$ requires setting $\\epsilon=1$, which is not a small parameter. Despite this, the expansion often provides qualitatively correct and quantitatively reasonable estimates even for $\\epsilon=1$, especially at the first order.\n\n**5. Find the Formula for the Exponent $\\alpha$**\nWithin the RG framework for the O(N) model (a general model where the order parameter has $N$ components), the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ can be calculated as a series in $\\epsilon$. The standard result to the first order in $\\epsilon$ (which corresponds to a one-loop calculation in field theory) is:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-N}{2(N+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**6. Address the Dependency on N (Universality Class)**\n*   **Careful Point:** The formula for $\\alpha$ depends on $N$, the number of components of the order parameter. Critical exponents are universal, but only for systems within the same *universality class*, which is defined by the spatial dimension ($d$) and the symmetries of the order parameter (encapsulated by $N$). The question asks for \"the\" exponent for \"a system,\" which is ambiguous.\n*   **Assumption:** In the absence of specific information, the standard and most fundamental model to consider is the **Ising model**. This model describes systems with a scalar order parameter (e.g., up/down spins), which corresponds to $N=1$. We will proceed with this common assumption.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nNow, we will substitute the determined values into the formula to find the numerical answer for $\\alpha$.\n\n*   **Step 1: State the formula.**\n    The first-order epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ is:\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{4-N}{2(N+8)}\\epsilon$\n\n*   **Step 2: Substitute the known parameters.**\n    We are working with $d=3$, which gives $\\epsilon = 1$. We assume the system belongs to the Ising universality class, so $N=1$.\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\times 1$\n\n*   **Step 3: Perform the calculation.**\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2(9)}$\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{3}{18}$\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\nThis value, $\\alpha = 1/6 \\approx 0.167$, is the first-order approximation from the epsilon expansion. The currently accepted high-precision value for the 3D Ising model is $\\alpha \\approx 0.110$. The first-order expansion gives the correct sign (positive, indicating a divergent specific heat) and a value that is in the right ballpark.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
