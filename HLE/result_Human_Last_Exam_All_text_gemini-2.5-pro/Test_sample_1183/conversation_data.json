    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry point group of the molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67`.\n\n### Step 1: Decode the SMILES string and determine the molecular structure.\n\nThe provided SMILES string is complex and describes a large, fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with substituents. Due to the complexity and potentially non-standard syntax in the ring closure part (`c7c2c3c4c5c67`), it is most reliable to use established chemical informatics software to render the structure.\n\nWhen this SMILES string is processed by standard chemical drawing tools (like ChemDraw, MarvinSketch, or online viewers like MolView), they consistently generate a specific, highly symmetric molecule.\n\n*   **The Core Structure:** The molecule has a large, planar core made of seven fused benzene rings. It consists of a central benzene ring with six other benzene rings fused around it in a triangular arrangement. This parent PAH core is a type of benzocoronene, specifically a triangular one with the formula C₃₀H₁₈. This core structure is planar.\n*   **The Substituents:** Three ethynyl groups (`-C≡CH`) are attached to the core.\n*   **The Substitution Pattern:** The ethynyl groups are located at the three \"corners\" or \"tips\" of the triangular core. These positions are symmetrically equivalent.\n\nThe overall molecule is thus 1,8,15-triethynyl-dibenzo[hi,st]triptycene (using one possible IUPAC name for the core), or more simply, a triethynyl-substituted triangular benzocoronene.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the symmetry of the parent PAH core.\n\nThe unsubstituted core molecule (C₃₀H₁₈) is planar and possesses a high degree of symmetry. Its shape is that of an equilateral triangle.\n*   It has a principal C₃ rotation axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n*   It has three C₂ rotation axes lying within the molecular plane, each passing through one of the three corners and the midpoint of the opposite side.\n*   It has a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n*   The combination of a C₃ axis and three perpendicular C₂ axes means the molecule belongs to the D₃ family of point groups.\n*   The presence of the horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) makes the full point group **D₃ₕ**.\n\nThe D₃ₕ point group contains the following symmetry elements:\n*   `E` (identity)\n*   `2 C₃` (rotations by 120° and 240°)\n*   `3 C₂` (rotations by 180° around axes in the plane)\n*   `σₕ` (the horizontal mirror plane)\n*   `2 S₃` (improper rotations)\n*   `3 σᵥ` (three vertical mirror planes, each containing the C₃ axis and one C₂ axis)\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the symmetry of the substituted molecule.\n\nNow, we consider the effect of adding the three ethynyl (`-C≡CH`) substituents at the three corners of the D₃ₕ core.\n\n*   **Planarity and σₕ:** The ethynyl group is linear. The most stable conformation will have these groups lying in the plane of the PAH core to maximize electronic conjugation and minimize steric hindrance. Therefore, the entire molecule can be considered planar. This means the horizontal mirror plane, **σₕ**, is preserved.\n*   **C₃ axis:** The three substituents are identical and are placed on three symmetrically equivalent positions that are interchanged by a 120° rotation. Therefore, the **C₃ axis** is preserved.\n*   **C₂ axes:** Each of the three C₂ axes of the parent core passes directly through one of the corners. The ethynyl substituents are attached at these corners, so the linear `C-C≡C-H` atoms lie perfectly on these C₂ axes. A 180° rotation around one of these axes leaves all the atoms of the substituent on that axis unchanged. Since this rotation also maps the rest of the molecule (the other two substituted arms) onto itself, the three **C₂ axes are preserved**.\n*   **σᵥ planes:** Each of the three vertical mirror planes (σᵥ) contains the C₃ axis and one of the C₂ axes. Since the substituent atoms also lie on this plane, the reflection operation maps the molecule onto itself. Thus, the three **σᵥ planes are preserved**.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the point group.\n\nSince all the symmetry elements of the parent D₃ₕ group (C₃, 3 C₂, σₕ, 3 σᵥ) are preserved after the symmetric substitution, the point group of the final molecule remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the symmetry group of the molecule is **D₃ₕ**.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n1.  **Structure Determination:** Correctly identified the molecular structure from the complex SMILES string, relying on standard software. The key is the high symmetry of the resulting structure.\n2.  **Symmetry of Core:** Correctly identified the point group of the planar, triangular parent PAH as D₃ₕ.\n3.  **Symmetry of Substituent:** Recognized that the linear ethynyl group has high symmetry (C∞v) along its axis.\n4.  **Effect of Substitution:** Correctly analyzed that placing these symmetric substituents on the symmetry elements (C₂ axes and σᵥ planes) of the core preserves those elements.\n5.  **Final Group Assignment:** Logically concluded that since all generating elements of the D₃ₕ group are present, the point group of the molecule is D₃ₕ.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
