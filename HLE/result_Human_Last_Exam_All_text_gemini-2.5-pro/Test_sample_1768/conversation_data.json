    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reading frame and the resulting protein sequence.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Input Sequence:** We are given a DNA sequence: `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`.\n2.  **Key Information:** The sequence is from the **middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF)**. An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that is translated into a protein. It starts with a start codon and ends with a stop codon. Therefore, a sequence from the middle of an ORF should not contain any stop codons. The three stop codons are **TAA**, **TAG**, and **TGA**.\n3.  **Goal:**\n    *   Find the correct reading frame (out of the three possibilities).\n    *   Translate the sequence in that frame into a protein sequence using the one-letter amino acid codes.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nWe need to test each of the three possible reading frames. The correct frame will be the one that does not produce any stop codons.\n\n**Given DNA Sequence:**\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\n**Careful Point 1: Test Reading Frame 1**\nThis frame starts with the first nucleotide. We group the sequence into codons (triplets) from the beginning.\n\n*   **Codons:** `GGA CAT TGT TGT TAG CGA AGA...`\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `GGA` -> G (Glycine)\n    *   `CAT` -> H (Histidine)\n    *   `TGT` -> C (Cysteine)\n    *   `TGT` -> C (Cysteine)\n    *   `TAG` -> **STOP**\n*   **Conclusion:** Frame 1 contains a stop codon (`TAG`) very early in the sequence. This cannot be the correct frame for a sequence from the middle of an ORF.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Test Reading Frame 2**\nThis frame starts with the second nucleotide. We ignore the first nucleotide and group the rest of the sequence into codons.\n\n*   **Codons:** `g GAC ATT GTT GTT AGC GAA GAC TTG AAT GGA ACG GTG AAG TTT TCA AGC TCT TTA CCC TAC CCC AAT AAT CTT AAC AGT GTC CTG GCT GAG CGA CTG GAG AAG TGG c`\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `GAC` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `ATT` -> I (Isoleucine)\n    *   `GTT` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `GTT` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `AGC` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `GAA` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `GAC` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `TTG` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `AAT` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `GGA` -> G (Glycine)\n    *   `ACG` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `GTG` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `AAG` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `TTT` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n    *   `TCA` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `AGC` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `TCT` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `TTA` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `CCC` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `TAC` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n    *   `CCC` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `AAT` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `AAT` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `CTT` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `AAC` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `AGT` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `GTC` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `CTG` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `GCT` -> A (Alanine)\n    *   `GAG` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `CGA` -> R (Arginine)\n    *   `CTG` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `GAG` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `AAG` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `TGG` -> W (Tryptophan)\n*   **Conclusion:** This frame translates into a continuous stretch of amino acids with no stop codons. This is the correct reading frame.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Test Reading Frame 3**\nThis frame starts with the third nucleotide. We ignore the first two nucleotides and group the rest of the sequence into codons.\n\n*   **Codons:** `gg ACA TTG TTG TTA GCG AAG ACT TGA ATG...`\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `ACA` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `TTG` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `TTG` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `TTA` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `GCG` -> A (Alanine)\n    *   `AAG` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `ACT` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `TGA` -> **STOP**\n*   **Conclusion:** Frame 3 contains a stop codon (`TGA`). This cannot be the correct frame.\n\n### **Final Answer Derivation**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Frame 2 yields a continuous protein sequence without any stop codons, which is consistent with the sequence being from the middle of an ORF.\n\n*   **Correct Frame:** Frame 2\n*   **Protein Sequence:** DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSASSLPTYPNNELLNSVLAERLEKW\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSASSLPTYPNNELLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
