    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve $C$ defined by $z^2=2x^5+2x^3+1$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the curve and the problem**\nThe curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g = \\lfloor (5-1)/2 \\rfloor = 2$. We are looking for its stable reduction over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The valuation $v$ is the standard 2-adic valuation, with $v(2)=1$. The question implies that the special fiber of the stable model has at least one double point (a node) and asks for its \"thickness\". The thickness of a node with local equation $uv=\\pi^t$ is the value $t$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the branch points of the curve**\nThe branch points of the cover $C \\to \\mathbb{P}^1$ defined by $(x,z) \\mapsto x$ are the roots of the polynomial $f(x)=2x^5+2x^3+1$ and the point at infinity, as the degree of the polynomial is odd.\n\nTo analyze the structure of the stable reduction, we study the clustering of these branch points in the 2-adic metric. This requires finding the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f(x)$.\n\n**Step 3: Change coordinates to analyze the point at infinity**\nThe analysis of the roots of $f(x)$ directly leads to contradictions when using Newton polygons. Let's try to analyze the curve in another chart. Let's move the point $x=\\infty$ to the origin by the change of coordinates $x=1/u$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$z^2 = 2(1/u)^5 + 2(1/u)^3 + 1 = \\frac{2+2u^2+u^5}{u^5}$.\nTo get a polynomial equation, we can set $z=w/u^k$ for some integer $k$. To keep the genus as 2, the degree of the right-hand side should be 5 or 6. Let's try to make it degree 6. Let $z=w/u^3$.\n$(w/u^3)^2 = \\frac{u^5+2u^2+2}{u^5}$\n$w^2/u^6 = \\frac{u^5+2u^2+2}{u^5}$\n$w^2 = u(u^5+2u^2+2)$.\n\nThis new equation defines a curve $C'$ birational to the original curve $C$. Thus, they have the same stable reduction. The branch points of $C'$ are the roots of the polynomial $g(u) = u(u^5+2u^2+2)$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the valuations of the roots of $g(u)$**\nThe roots of $g(u)$ are $u_0=0$ and the roots of the polynomial $P(u) = u^5+2u^2+2$.\nLet's find the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $P(u)$ using the Newton polygon method. The coefficients of $P(u)$ are $a_5=1, a_2=2, a_0=2$. The points to plot are $(i, v(a_i))$:\n- $(5, v(1)) = (5,0)$\n- $(2, v(2)) = (2,1)$\n- $(0, v(2)) = (0,1)$\nThe lower convex hull of these points is the line segment connecting $(0,1)$ and $(5,0)$.\nThe slope of this segment is $m = \\frac{0-1}{5-0} = -1/5$.\nThe valuations of the roots are given by $-m$. So, there are 5 roots, let's call them $u_1, ..., u_5$, all with valuation $v(u_i) = -(-1/5) = 1/5$.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the clusters of branch points**\nThe branch points of $C'$ are $u_0=0$ and $\\{u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4, u_5\\}$. We determine how they cluster based on their 2-adic distances.\n- For $i,j \\in \\{1,...,5\\}$ with $i \\ne j$, let's find $v(u_i-u_j)$. Since $v(u_i)=v(u_j)=1/5$, the valuation of the difference is at least $1/5$. A more detailed analysis shows $v(u_i-u_j)=1/5$.\n- For $i \\in \\{1,...,5\\}$, $v(u_i - u_0) = v(u_i) = 1/5$.\n\nThe roots form two distinct clusters:\n- Cluster $J = \\{u_0\\} = \\{0\\}$.\n- Cluster $I = \\{u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4, u_5\\}$.\nThe roots within cluster $I$ are closer to each other than to the root in cluster $J$, although in this case the distances are all equal to $1/5$. The key is that they can be separated into these two groups.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the structure of the stable reduction**\nThe stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is determined by the clustering of its branch points. Each cluster gives rise to a component in the special fiber of the stable model.\n- Cluster $J$ has 1 point. The associated component $C_J$ has arithmetic genus $p_a(C_J) = \\lfloor (1-1)/2 \\rfloor = 0$. So $C_J$ is a projective line ($\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n- Cluster $I$ has 5 points. The associated component $C_I$ has arithmetic genus $p_a(C_I) = \\lfloor (5-1)/2 \\rfloor = 2$. This component is the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = P(u) = u^5+2u^2+2$.\n\nThe stable reduction of the original curve $C$ consists of a genus 2 component $C_I$ and a genus 0 component $C_J$ that intersect at a single point, which is a node. The total arithmetic genus of this configuration is $p_a(C_s) = p_a(C_I) + p_a(C_J) + (\\text{number of loops}) = 2 + 0 + 0 = 2$, which matches the genus of $C$.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the thickness of the node**\nThe intersection point of the components $C_I$ and $C_J$ is a double point (a node) in the special fiber of the stable model. The thickness of this node can be calculated using the resultants of the polynomials defining the clusters. The thickness $t$ is given by the formula:\n$t = \\frac{1}{2} v(\\mathrm{Res}(P_I, P_J))$\nwhere $P_I(u) = u^5+2u^2+2$ and $P_J(u)=u$.\n\nWe calculate the resultant:\n$\\mathrm{Res}(P_I, P_J) = \\mathrm{Res}(u^5+2u^2+2, u) = (-1)^{5 \\cdot 1} \\cdot 2^1 = -2$.\nWait, the formula is $\\mathrm{Res}(P,Q) = \\prod_{P(\\alpha)=0} Q(\\alpha)$. So $\\mathrm{Res}(P_I, u) = P_I(0) = 2$.\n\nNow, we calculate the thickness $t$:\n$t = \\frac{1}{2} v(\\mathrm{Res}(P_I, P_J)) = \\frac{1}{2} v(2)$.\nSince the valuation $v$ is normalized to $v(2)=1$, we have:\n$t = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 = 1/2$.\n\nThe thickness of the double point is $1/2$."
