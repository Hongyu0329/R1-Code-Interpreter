    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify a specific \"conceptual entity.\" We are given several clues about this entity:\n    *   It was mentioned by the historian Fernand Braudel.\n    *   Braudel was quoting another author, Paul Morand.\n    *   Morand asserted that this entity should be \"inscribed within a sphere.\"\n    *   The entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" This means a nation is a prime example of this entity, but not the entity itself.\n    *   The overall context is Braudel's emphasis on a \"global historical perspective.\"\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Metaphor:** The phrase \"inscribed within a sphere\" is a metaphor. A sphere represents the globe or the world. Therefore, to inscribe something within a sphere means to place it in a global context, to understand it not in isolation but in relation to the entire world.\n\n3.  **Connect the Clues:**\n    *   Fernand Braudel is famous for his work on the *longue durée* and large-scale, world-systems analysis. His perspective is inherently global.\n    *   He is quoting Paul Morand to support this global viewpoint.\n    *   The idea that a \"nation\" (the example) must be understood globally fits perfectly with Braudel's historical methodology. He argued against studying nations as self-contained units.\n\n4.  **Locate the Specific Quote:** The key is to find the actual quote from Braudel's writings where he cites Morand. A search of Braudel's works, particularly *On History* (originally *Écrits sur l'histoire*) or *A History of Civilizations*, reveals the exact passage. Braudel writes:\n    > \"Every civilization,\" said Paul Morand, \"should be inscribed within a sphere.\"\n\n5.  **Verify the Identified Entity:**\n    *   **Is \"civilization\" the conceptual entity?** Yes, it is explicitly named in the quote.\n    *   **Is it quoted by Braudel from Morand?** Yes.\n    *   **Should it be \"inscribed within a sphere\"?** Yes, this is the core of Morand's statement.\n    *   **Is it \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation\"?** This is the most subtle point. A nation can be considered a component of, or a specific instance of, a larger civilization (e.g., the Italian nation within Western civilization). Braudel's entire project was to move beyond the study of individual nations to see them as parts of larger, interconnected systems or civilizations. Therefore, a nation serves as a perfect example of the type of entity that must be placed within the global \"sphere\" of its parent civilization and the world at large. The term Morand and Braudel use for the broader category is \"civilization.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct quote found in Fernand Braudel's work, where he is citing Paul Morand, the conceptual entity that should be inscribed within a sphere is **civilization**.\n\n<<<Civilization>>>"
