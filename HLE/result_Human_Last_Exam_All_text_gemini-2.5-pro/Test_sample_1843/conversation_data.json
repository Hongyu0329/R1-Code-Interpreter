    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$.\n\n**Step 1: Factorize the conductor N**\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$.\nSo, the prime factorization of $N$ is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the structure of primitive characters**\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\nLet $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$, where:\n*   $\\chi_1$ is a primitive character modulo $2^2 = 4$.\n*   $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character modulo $3^2 = 9$.\n*   $\\chi_3$ is a primitive character modulo $7$.\n*   $\\chi_4$ is a primitive character modulo $11$.\n*   $\\chi_5$ is a primitive character modulo $13$.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5))$.\n\nWe are looking for characters where $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = 6$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the component characters**\nFor the order of $\\chi$ to be 6, two conditions must be satisfied:\n1.  The order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must divide 6.\n2.  The lcm of the orders must be exactly 6. This means the set of orders must contain a factor of 2 and a factor of 3.\n\nLet's determine the number of possible choices for each component character $\\chi_i$ by finding the number of primitive characters for each modulus whose order divides 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 4:** The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is only one primitive character modulo 4. Its order is 2. Since $2|6$, this is a valid choice.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_1$: 1.\n\n*   **Modulo 9:** The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The primitive characters modulo 9 are those whose orders do not divide $\\phi(3)=2$ and are not 1. More directly, the non-primitive characters are induced from modulo 3, and have orders 1 and 2. The group of all characters (mod 9) has characters of orders 1, 2, 3, 6. The primitive characters are those of order 3 and 6. The number of characters of order $d$ is $\\phi(d)$.\n    - Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$ characters. (Primitive, $3|6$)\n    - Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$ characters. (Primitive, $6|6$)\n    Both orders 3 and 6 divide 6. So, all primitive characters modulo 9 are valid choices.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_2$: $2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7:** The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. We need those whose order divides 6. The possible orders of primitive characters are 2, 3, 6.\n    - Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$ character.\n    - Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$ characters.\n    - Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$ characters.\n    All primitive characters have an order that divides 6.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_3$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11:** The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. The possible orders of primitive characters are 2, 5, 10. We need the order to divide 6. Only order 2 is a divisor of 6.\n    - Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$ character.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1.\n\n*   **Modulo 13:** The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. The possible orders of primitive characters are 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. We need the order to divide 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, 6.\n    - Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$ character.\n    - Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$ characters.\n    - Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$ characters.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_5$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results and verify the lcm condition**\nThe total number of ways to choose the component characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4, \\chi_5)$ such that each $\\chi_i$ is primitive and its order divides 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal combinations = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow we must verify that the lcm of the orders for these combinations is exactly 6.\nLet $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$.\n1.  The choice for $\\chi_1$ forces $o_1=2$. This guarantees that $\\text{lcm}(o_1, \\dots, o_5)$ is divisible by 2.\n2.  The choices for $\\chi_2$ require $o_2$ to be either 3 or 6. In both cases, $o_2$ is divisible by 3. This guarantees that $\\text{lcm}(o_1, \\dots, o_5)$ is divisible by 3.\n\nSince the lcm is divisible by both 2 and 3, it must be divisible by $\\text{lcm}(2,3)=6$.\nFurthermore, since we have already ensured that each $o_i$ divides 6, their lcm must also divide 6.\nAn integer that is both a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 6 must be exactly 6.\n\nTherefore, every one of the 100 possible combinations of primitive component characters results in a character of order 6.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$ is 100."
