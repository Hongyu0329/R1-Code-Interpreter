    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Poem and Section:** The question asks about the poem *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'* by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi. We need to find the specific section within this poem that enumerates the names of the 25 prophets whose belief is considered obligatory in Sunni Islam.\n\n2.  **Locate the Introductory Verse:** Before listing the names, the author typically introduces the topic. In the standard numbering of the poem, verse (bayt) 30 serves this purpose:\n    > وَفِي تِلْكَ تَفْصِيْلٌ وَخَمْسَةٌ وَعِشْرُوْنَ لَازِمٌ كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ\n    > *Wa fī tilka tafṣīlun wa khamsatun wa 'ishrūna lāzimun kulla mukallafin*\n    > **Translation:** In their account are the details, and twenty-five [of them] are obligatory upon every accountable person.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This verse *introduces* the list but does not contain the names themselves. Therefore, it is not the starting point of the list.\n\n3.  **Identify the Starting Verse:** The actual enumeration of the prophets' names begins in the very next verse.\n    *   **Bayt 31:**\n        > فَهُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ وَهُوْدٌ مَعْ صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n        > *Fahum Ādamun Idrīsu Nūḥun wa Hūdun ma' Ṣāliḥin wa Ibrāhīmu kullun muttaba'*\n        > **Translation:** They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, and Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim, each to be followed.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the first bayt that explicitly mentions the prophets' names, making it the starting point of the range.\n\n4.  **Trace the List to its Conclusion:** We must follow the verses until the list of 25 prophets is complete.\n    *   **Bayt 32:** Mentions Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n    *   **Bayt 33:** Mentions Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, Al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n    *   **Bayt 34:**\n        > إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n        > *Ilyāsu Yūnus Zakariyyā Yaḥyā 'Īsā wa Ṭāhā khātimun da' ghayyā*\n        > **Translation:** Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad), the Seal [of the prophets], so leave misguidance.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This verse completes the list of 25 prophets, ending with Prophet Muhammad (referred to as Taha). This is the final bayt in the sequence that lists the names.\n\n5.  **Confirm the End of the Section:** The verse immediately following the list confirms that the enumeration is over. Bayt 35 sends peace and blessings upon them and their families, signaling a transition to a new point.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   The enumeration of the prophets' names starts at **bayt 31**.\n*   The enumeration of the prophets' names concludes at **bayt 34**.\n*   Therefore, the names are mentioned from bayt 31 to bayt 34.\n\n<<<From bayt 31 to bayt 34.>>>"
