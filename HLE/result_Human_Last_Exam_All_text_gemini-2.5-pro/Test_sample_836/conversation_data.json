    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks for the specific name of a mathematical object defined by three key components:\n1.  **The function:** The \"generalized pair correlation function\".\n2.  **The context:** The \"nuclear criticality community\".\n3.  **The operation:** A \"space-time, double Fourier transform\".\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the \"Generalized Pair Correlation Function\"\nIn the context of nuclear reactor physics and criticality, this function describes the correlation between fluctuations in the neutron population at two different points in space and time.\n*   Let $n(\\vec{r}, t)$ be the neutron density at position $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$.\n*   Let $\\langle n(\\vec{r}, t) \\rangle$ be the average neutron density.\n*   The fluctuation is $\\delta n(\\vec{r}, t) = n(\\vec{r}, t) - \\langle n(\\vec{r}, t) \\rangle$.\n*   The pair correlation function, which we can call $G(\\vec{r}_1, t_1; \\vec{r}_2, t_2)$, is the statistical average of the product of fluctuations at two space-time points:\n    $G(\\vec{r}_1, t_1; \\vec{r}_2, t_2) = \\langle \\delta n(\\vec{r}_1, t_1) \\delta n(\\vec{r}_2, t_2) \\rangle$.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** For a system that is stationary in time and homogeneous in space (a common assumption in theoretical models), this function depends only on the separation in time and space, not on the absolute coordinates.\n    *   Time separation: $\\tau = t_2 - t_1$\n    *   Space separation: $\\vec{r} = \\vec{r}_2 - \\vec{r}_1$\n*   So, the function simplifies to $g(\\vec{r}, \\tau)$. This is the function we will be transforming.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the \"Space-Time, Double Fourier Transform\"\nThis operation transforms the function from the space-time domain $(\\vec{r}, \\tau)$ to the wavevector-frequency domain $(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$.\n*   The Fourier transform with respect to the spatial variable $\\vec{r}$ gives the wavevector $\\vec{k}$ dependence.\n*   The Fourier transform with respect to the time variable $\\tau$ gives the angular frequency $\\omega$ dependence.\n*   The mathematical form of the double Fourier transform, let's call the result $S(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$, is:\n    $S(\\vec{k}, \\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\tau \\int d^3r \\, g(\\vec{r}, \\tau) e^{-i(\\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{r} - \\omega \\tau)}$\n*   **Careful Point 2:** This transform simultaneously captures both the spatial correlations (via $\\vec{k}$) and temporal correlations (via $\\omega$) of the neutron fluctuations.\n\n### Step 4: Connecting to the Nuclear Criticality Community and Finding the Name\nWe need to find the common name for $S(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$ within the field of nuclear reactor physics and noise analysis.\n*   The study of correlations and their Fourier transforms is central to \"neutron noise analysis\".\n*   If we only performed the time Fourier transform, the result would be a space-dependent Cross-Power Spectral Density. If we further integrated over space or considered point detectors, we would get the standard Power Spectral Density (PSD) or Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD), which are functions of frequency $\\omega$ only.\n*   The quantity $S(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$ is more general as it retains both spatial and temporal frequency information.\n*   This exact mathematical structure was first introduced by LÃ©on Van Hove in the context of neutron scattering in condensed matter physics. He named it the **Dynamic Structure Factor**.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The nuclear criticality and reactor physics community has adopted this terminology from statistical and condensed matter physics to describe the complete second-order statistics of the neutron field in the Fourier domain. It represents the power spectrum of the neutron density fluctuations for a given wavevector $\\vec{k}$ and frequency $\\omega$. It is a fundamental quantity in advanced theoretical treatments of neutron noise.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function (of neutron density fluctuations) is known as the Dynamic Structure Factor. It provides the most complete description of the correlations in the system in the frequency-wavevector domain.\n\n<<<Dynamic Structure Factor>>>"
