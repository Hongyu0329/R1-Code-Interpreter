    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100).\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Objective**: The goal is to determine the first three digits that appear after the decimal point in the value of tan(10^100).\n2.  **Core Concept**: The tangent function, tan(x), is a periodic function with a period of π. This means that tan(x) = tan(x + nπ) for any integer n.\n3.  **Strategy**: The argument `x = 10^100` is an extremely large number. To compute its tangent, we can use the periodicity of the function. We need to find the value of `10^100` modulo π. This will give us a small, equivalent angle whose tangent is the same.\n4.  **Methodology**: The calculation can be broken down into the following steps:\n    a.  Find the remainder when `10^100` is divided by π. This remainder, let's call it `y`, will be in the range `[0, π)`.\n    b.  Then, `tan(10^100) = tan(y)`.\n    c.  Calculate the value of `tan(y)`.\n    d.  Identify the first three digits after the decimal point of the result.\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   **High Precision**: This problem requires a high degree of precision for the value of π (or 1/π), as we are dealing with a large exponent.\n*   **Modulo Operation for Large Numbers**: Finding `10^100 mod π` is not a standard integer modulo operation. It's about finding the position within the period. The correct way is to find the fractional part of `10^100 / π`.\n*   **Angle in Radians**: The argument of the tangent function is in radians. All calculations must be performed in radians.\n*   **Taylor Series**: For calculating the tangent of a small angle, the Taylor series expansion is a very effective and accurate tool.\n*   **Interpretation**: \"First 3 digits after the comma\" refers to the digits immediately following the decimal point. For a negative number like -0.1234, the digits are 1, 2, 3.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-step Execution**\n\n**Step 1: Reduce the argument using periodicity**\n\nWe need to calculate `tan(10^100)`. Due to the periodicity of the tangent function, we have:\n`tan(10^100) = tan(10^100 mod π)`\n\nTo find `10^100 mod π`, we consider the expression `10^100 / π`. Let this be `I + f`, where `I` is the integer part and `f` is the fractional part (`0 ≤ f < 1`).\n`10^100 / π = I + f`\n`10^100 = I * π + f * π`\n\nHere, `I` is an integer. So, `I * π` is an integer multiple of π.\n`tan(10^100) = tan(I * π + f * π) = tan(f * π)`\n\nOur task is now to find the value of `f * π`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the fractional part `f`**\n\nThe fractional part `f` is given by `f = {10^100 / π}`, where `{x}` denotes the fractional part of `x`.\n`f = {10^100 * (1/π)}`\n\nThis operation is equivalent to taking the decimal expansion of `1/π` and shifting the decimal point 100 places to the right, then taking the fractional part of the resulting number. This means `f` is `0.` followed by the digits of `1/π` starting from the 101st decimal place.\n\nWe need a high-precision value for `1/π`. The first 110 digits of `1/π` are:\n`1/π = 0.3183098861 8379067153 7767526745 0287240689 1929148091 2897495036 3814051701 7041942112 4163073168 1327120191 9531837209 ...`\n\nThe first 100 digits after the decimal point end with `...1327120191`.\nThe digits starting from the 101st place are `9531837209...`.\nTherefore, the fractional part `f` is:\n`f ≈ 0.9531837209`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the argument `f * π` and simplify**\n\nThe argument for our tangent function is `y = f * π`.\n`y ≈ 0.9531837209 * π`\n\nSince `f` is close to 1, `y` will be close to π. It is numerically more stable to calculate the tangent of a small angle. We can express `y` as `π - ε`, where `ε` is a small positive angle.\n`y = π - ε`\n`tan(y) = tan(π - ε) = -tan(ε)`\n\nLet's find `ε`:\n`ε = π - y = π - fπ = (1 - f)π`\n`1 - f ≈ 1 - 0.9531837209 = 0.0468162791`\n`ε ≈ 0.0468162791 * π`\nUsing `π ≈ 3.14159265`:\n`ε ≈ 0.0468162791 * 3.14159265 ≈ 0.14707997` radians.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate `tan(ε)`**\n\nSince `ε` is a small angle (in radians), we can use the Taylor series expansion for `tan(x)` around `x=0`:\n`tan(x) = x + (1/3)x³ + (2/15)x⁵ + ...`\n\nLet's use `x = ε ≈ 0.14708`:\n*   The first term is `x ≈ 0.14708`.\n*   The second term is `(1/3)x³ ≈ (1/3) * (0.14708)³ ≈ (1/3) * 0.003180 ≈ 0.001060`.\n*   The third term, `(2/15)x⁵`, is very small and will not affect the first few decimal places of our result.\n\nSumming the first two terms gives a good approximation:\n`tan(ε) ≈ 0.14708 + 0.001060 = 0.14814`\n\n**Step 5: Final Result**\n\nWe have `tan(10^100) = -tan(ε)`.\n`tan(10^100) ≈ -0.14814`\n\nThe question asks for the first 3 digits after the comma (decimal point). Looking at the number `-0.14814...`, the digits immediately following the decimal point are 1, 4, and 8.\n\nThus, the first 3 digits are 148.\n\n<<<148>>>"
