    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**Step 1: Define the System and the Goal**\n\nWe are given the state-space representation of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system with matrices:\n*   State matrix: `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n*   Input matrix: `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nWe want to find a 2x2 state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` has its eigenvalues at the desired locations `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The problem specifies the closed-loop matrix as `A + BF`. This corresponds to a control law `u = +Fx`. The more common convention is `A - BF` (for a control law `u = -Fx`). We must strictly follow the notation given in the problem.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe desired eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair: `λ_1 = -1 + j` and `λ_2 = -1 - j`.\nThe characteristic polynomial `p(λ)` for a system with these eigenvalues is:\n`p(λ) = (λ - λ_1)(λ - λ_2)`\n`p(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\nUsing the difference of squares formula `(a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2`:\n`p(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\nSince `j^2 = -1`:\n`p(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 1 - (-1)`\n`p(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\nThe desired characteristic equation is `λ^2 + 2λ + 2 = 0`.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Closed-Loop Matrix `A + BF` in terms of F**\n\nLet the unknown gain matrix F be:\n`F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`\n\nFirst, calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[1*f1 + 2*f3, 1*f2 + 2*f4], [1*f1 + 0*f3, 1*f2 + 0*f4]] = [[f1 + 2f3, f2 + 2f4], [f1, f2]]`\n\nNow, form the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2f3, f2 + 2f4], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f1 + 2f3, 1 + f2 + 2f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\n**Step 4: Find the Characteristic Polynomial of the Closed-Loop System**\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of a 2x2 matrix `M = [[a, b], [c, d]]` is `λ^2 - tr(M)λ + det(M) = 0`, where `tr(M) = a + d` is the trace and `det(M) = ad - bc` is the determinant.\n\nFor our `A_cl`:\n*   `tr(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2f3) + f2 = f1 + f2 + 2f3 - 1`\n*   `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2f3)(f2) - (1 + f2 + 2f4)(1 + f1)`\n    `= -f2 + f1f2 + 2f2f3 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1f2 + 2f4 + 2f1f4)`\n    `= -f2 + f1f2 + 2f2f3 - 1 - f1 - f2 - f1f2 - 2f4 - 2f1f4`\n    `= -1 - f1 - 2f2 + 2f2f3 - 2f4 - 2f1f4`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial is:\n`λ^2 - (f1 + f2 + 2f3 - 1)λ + (-1 - f1 - 2f2 + 2f2f3 - 2f4 - 2f1f4) = 0`\n`λ^2 + (1 - f1 - f2 - 2f3)λ + (-1 - f1 - 2f2 + 2f2f3 - 2f4 - 2f1f4) = 0`\n\n**Step 5: Equate Coefficients and Solve for the Elements of F**\n\nWe match the coefficients of our calculated polynomial with the desired polynomial `λ^2 + 2λ + 2 = 0`.\n\n1.  Matching the `λ` coefficients:\n    `1 - f1 - f2 - 2f3 = 2`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2f3 = -1`  (Equation 1)\n\n2.  Matching the constant terms:\n    `-1 - f1 - 2f2 + 2f2f3 - 2f4 - 2f1f4 = 2`\n    `-f1 - 2f2 + 2f2f3 - 2f4 - 2f1f4 = 3` (Equation 2)\n\n**Careful Point 2:** We have two equations with four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`). This means the system is underdetermined, and there are infinitely many solutions for F. This is expected for multi-input systems. We only need to find one valid solution.\n\nTo find a particular solution, we can simplify the problem by setting some of the unknowns to zero. Let's set `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`.\n\nThe equations now become:\n1.  `f1 + f2 + 2(0) = -1`  =>  `f1 + f2 = -1`\n2.  `-f1 - 2f2 + 2f2(0) - 2(0) - 2f1(0) = 3`  =>  `-f1 - 2f2 = 3`\n\nWe now have a simple system of two linear equations:\n(a) `f1 + f2 = -1`\n(b) `-f1 - 2f2 = 3`\n\nAdd equation (a) to equation (b):\n`(f1 + f2) + (-f1 - 2f2) = -1 + 3`\n`-f2 = 2`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` into equation (a):\n`f1 + (-2) = -1`\n`f1 = 1`\n\nWe have found the values: `f1 = 1`, `f2 = -2`, `f3 = 0`, `f4 = 0`.\n\n**Step 6: State the Final Answer**\n\nConstructing the matrix F from these values:\n`F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
