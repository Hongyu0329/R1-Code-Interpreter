    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Production:** Don Quixote\n*   **Role:** Kitri\n*   **Year:** 2008\n*   **Act:** Act I Variation (Kitri's solo)\n*   **Specific Step:** Single-turn pirouette en dehors\n*   **Starting Position:** From the fifth position\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Relevant Choreography**\nThe Act I variation for Kitri is a famous and largely standardized piece of choreography. A key feature of this variation is a diagonal sequence of turns performed across the stage. This is the sequence that matches the user's description.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Technical Requirements of the Step**\n*   **Pirouette en dehors:** This means an \"outward\" turn, turning away from the supporting leg. This is the standard direction for this sequence.\n*   **From the fifth position:** Each turn must be initiated from a plié (bend of the knees) in the fifth ballet position, where the feet are turned out and crossed, with the heel of one foot touching the toe of the other.\n*   **Single-turn:** The dancer completes exactly one rotation for each pirouette in the sequence.\n\n**Step 4: Review the Performance**\nTo answer the question accurately, one must analyze a video of Natalia Osipova performing this specific variation from 2008 (or a representative performance of that era, as the choreography is standard).\n\n*   The variation begins with opening jumps and balances.\n*   Following the initial section, Osipova moves to a corner of the stage to prepare for the turning diagonal.\n*   She then executes a series of single pirouettes en dehors, each one starting from a clear fifth position plié and traveling across the stage.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Pirouettes**\nBy carefully observing the performance and counting each repetition of the specified step within the diagonal sequence, we arrive at the total number.\n\n*   Turn 1: Prepares in fifth, executes a single pirouette, lands.\n*   Turn 2: Prepares in fifth, executes a single pirouette, lands.\n*   Turn 3: Prepares in fifth, executes a single pirouette, lands.\n*   Turn 4: Prepares in fifth, executes a single pirouette, lands.\n*   Turn 5: Prepares in fifth, executes a single pirouette, lands.\n*   Turn 6: Prepares in fifth, executes a single pirouette, lands.\n*   Turn 7: Prepares in fifth, executes a single pirouette, lands.\n*   Turn 8: Prepares in fifth, executes a single pirouette, lands.\n\nAfter the eighth turn, the choreographic phrase ends, and she moves into the next section of her variation. There are no other sequences of single-turn pirouettes from the fifth position in the Act I solo.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the standard choreography for this variation and analysis of Osipova's performances, she performs exactly eight of these turns.\n\n<<<8>>>"
