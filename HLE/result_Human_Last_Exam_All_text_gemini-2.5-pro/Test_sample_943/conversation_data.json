    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of K.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Tensor and the Space\nThe problem asks for the slice rank of a function $f: \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\to \\mathbb{C}$ defined as:\n\\[ f(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1 \\]\nThis function is viewed as a tensor $T_n$ in the space $V_1^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V_2^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V_3^{\\otimes n}$, where each $V_k^{\\otimes n}$ is the space of complex-valued functions on $\\{0, 1\\}^n$. The space $V_k^{\\otimes n}$ has a basis of indicator functions $\\{\\delta_v\\}_{v \\in \\{0,1\\}^n}$, and its dimension is $2^n$. The tensor $T_n$ is given by its coordinates $T_{x,y,z} = f(x,y,z)$ for $x, y, z \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$.\n\n### Step 2: Definition of Slice Rank\nThe slice rank of a 3-tensor $T \\in U \\otimes V \\otimes W$, denoted $\\text{SR}(T)$, is the smallest integer $k$ such that $T$ can be written as a sum of $k$ \"slices\". A slice is a tensor of rank 1 in one of the three bipartitions of the space, i.e., it can be written in one of the forms:\n*   $u \\otimes T'$ for $u \\in U, T' \\in V \\otimes W$ (a type 1 slice)\n*   $v \\otimes T''$ for $v \\in V, T'' \\in U \\otimes W$ (a type 2 slice)\n*   $w \\otimes T'''$ for $w \\in W, T''' \\in U \\otimes V$ (a type 3 slice)\n\nSo, we are looking for the minimum $k=k_1+k_2+k_3$ such that\n\\[ T = \\sum_{i=1}^{k_1} u_i \\otimes T'_i + \\sum_{j=1}^{k_2} v_j \\otimes T''_j + \\sum_{l=1}^{k_3} w_l \\otimes T'''_l. \\]\n\n### Step 3: Finding an Upper Bound for the Slice Rank\nLet's analyze the polynomial form of the function $f(x,y,z)$. Let $X_i, Y_i, Z_i$ be formal variables. Since the inputs are from $\\{0,1\\}$, we can work with polynomials where $v^2=v$ for any variable.\nLet $P(X,Y,Z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (X_i+Y_i+Z_i) - 1$.\nWe can expand the product term by grouping variables. Let $C_i = Y_i+Z_i$.\n\\[ \\prod_{i=1}^n (X_i + C_i) = \\sum_{S \\subseteq [n]} \\left(\\prod_{i \\in S} X_i\\right) \\left(\\prod_{j \\in [n]\\setminus S} C_j\\right) \\]\nSubstituting back $C_j = Y_j+Z_j$, we get:\n\\[ \\prod_{i=1}^n (X_i+Y_i+Z_i) = \\sum_{S \\subseteq [n]} \\left(\\prod_{i \\in S} X_i\\right) \\left(\\prod_{j \\in [n]\\setminus S} (Y_j+Z_j)\\right) \\]\nLet's define functions $A_S(x) = \\prod_{i \\in S} x_i$ and $B_S(y,z) = \\prod_{j \\in [n]\\setminus S} (y_j+z_j)$. Each term $A_S(x) B_S(y,z)$ corresponds to a type 1 slice. There are $2^n$ such terms, as $S$ ranges over all subsets of $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nOur full function is $f(x,y,z) = \\left(\\sum_{S \\subseteq [n]} A_S(x) B_S(y,z)\\right) - 1$.\nThe constant term \"-1\" can also be written as a slice, for example, $A(x)=1$ and $B(y,z)=-1$.\nThus, $f(x,y,z)$ can be expressed as a sum of $2^n+1$ slices of type 1.\nThis gives an upper bound on the slice rank:\n\\[ \\text{SR}(T_n) \\le 2^n + 1 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Finding a Lower Bound for the Slice Rank\nA standard method to lower bound the slice rank is to use matrix flattenings. The slice rank of a tensor $T$ is greater than or equal to the rank of any of its matrix flattenings.\nLet's consider the type 1 flattening, $T_{1}$, which is a linear map from $V_1^{\\otimes n}$ to $V_2^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V_3^{\\otimes n}$. The rank of this map is the dimension of the image space. The image is spanned by the functions of $x$ obtained by fixing $y$ and $z$.\nLet's define $f_{y,z}(x) = f(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + (y_i+z_i)) - 1$.\nLet $c_i = y_i+z_i$. Since $y_i, z_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$, $c_i$ can take values in $\\{0,1,2\\}$.\nThe rank of the flattening $T_1$ is the dimension of the vector space spanned by the functions $\\{f_{y,z}(x) \\mid y,z \\in \\{0,1\\}^n\\}$, which is the same as $\\dim\\left(\\text{span}_{c \\in \\{0,1,2\\}^n} \\{P_c(x) - 1\\}\\right)$, where $P_c(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i+c_i)$.\n\nLet $V = \\text{span}_{c \\in \\{0,1,2\\}^n} \\{P_c(x)\\}$. The space of all functions on $\\{0,1\\}^n$ has dimension $2^n$. The space $V$ is a subspace of it.\nTo find $\\dim(V)$, we can check the rank of the matrix whose rows are the coordinate vectors of the polynomials $P_c(X) = \\prod(X_i+c_i)$ in the monomial basis $\\{X_S = \\prod_{i \\in S} X_i\\}_{S \\subseteq [n]}$.\nThe coefficient of $X_S$ in $P_c(X)$ is $\\prod_{j \\notin S} c_j$.\nLet's consider the $2^n \\times 2^n$ submatrix of coefficients coming from $c \\in \\{1,2\\}^n$. Let's call this matrix $M$. The entries are $M_{c,S} = \\prod_{j \\notin S} c_j$.\nThis matrix is known to be invertible. To see this, one can make a change of variables $d_j = c_j-1 \\in \\{0,1\\}$. The polynomials $\\prod_{j \\notin S}(d_j+1)$ form a basis for the space of functions on $\\{0,1\\}^{n}$ (they are triangular with respect to the monomial basis), so the corresponding matrix is invertible.\nSince this $2^n \\times 2^n$ submatrix has full rank, the larger matrix of coefficients has rank $2^n$. Therefore, $\\dim(V) = 2^n$.\n\nThe space we are interested in is $W = \\text{span}\\{v-1 \\mid v \\in V\\}$.\nThe dimension of $W$ is $\\dim(V)$ if the constant function $1$ is not in $V$, and $\\dim(V)-1$ if $1 \\in V$.\nWe can show that $1 \\in V$. For $n=1$, $P_2(x)-P_1(x) = (x+2)-(x+1)=1$. For general $n$, one can construct the function 1 as a linear combination of the $P_c(x)$.\nSo, $\\dim(W) = \\dim(V)-1 = 2^n-1$.\nThe rank of the flattening is $2^n-1$. This provides a lower bound for the slice rank:\n\\[ \\text{SR}(T_n) \\ge 2^n - 1 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Asymptotic Behavior and Final Calculation\nFrom our bounds, we have $2^n-1 \\le \\text{SR}(T_n) \\le 2^n+1$.\nThis implies that the asymptotic behavior of the slice rank is dominated by $2^n$. More formally, $\\text{SR}(T_n) = 2^n e^{o(n)}$.\nThe problem states that the slice rank is $(3/2^{K})^n e^{o(n)}$.\nBy comparing the two forms for the slice rank, we must have the same exponential base:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{2^K} = 2 \\]\nNow, we solve for K:\n\\[ 3 = 2 \\cdot 2^K \\]\n\\[ 3 = 2^{K+1} \\]\nTaking the logarithm base 2 of both sides:\n\\[ \\log_2(3) = K+1 \\]\n\\[ K = \\log_2(3) - 1 \\]\nThis can also be written as $K = \\log_2(3) - \\log_2(2) = \\log_2(3/2)$."
