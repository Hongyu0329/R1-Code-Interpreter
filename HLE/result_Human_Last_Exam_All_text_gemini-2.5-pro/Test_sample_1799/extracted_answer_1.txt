No, it is not true that the 2nd postulate is superfluous and can be deduced from the first. The first postulate alone is insufficient because it does not specify which set of physical laws (e.g., Newtonian mechanics or Maxwell's electromagnetism) should be considered correct when they conflict. The second postulate acts as a necessary and independent principle that resolves this conflict by asserting the constancy of the speed of light, thereby forcing a revision of the principles of classical mechanics and leading to the unique conclusions of special relativity.
