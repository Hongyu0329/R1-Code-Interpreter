    "The task is to identify crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and also possess the correct symmetry for optical activity. This is a trick question based on the fundamental principles of crystallography and optics.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Define Optical Activity:** First, I'll clarify the symmetry requirement for optical activity. Optical activity (the ability to rotate plane-polarized light) is only possible in materials that are **chiral**. A chiral structure is one that is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n2.  **Define Chirality in Crystals:** In crystallography, the chiral point groups are those that lack any roto-inversion axes. This includes the inversion center (which is `overline{1}`) and mirror planes (which are equivalent to a `overline{2}` axis).\n3.  **Define Achirality:** An achiral crystal class is, by definition, the opposite of a chiral one. It **must** possess at least one roto-inversion symmetry element (like a mirror plane or an inversion center).\n4.  **Identify the Contradiction:** The conditions \"achiral\" and \"optically active\" are mutually exclusive. A crystal cannot be both achiral and possess the symmetry required for optical activity (chirality).\n5.  **Programmatic Proof:** To demonstrate this, I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Defines a set of all 32 crystal classes.\n    *   Defines a subset of these classes that are **optically active (chiral)**.\n    *   Defines a subset of classes that are **achiral**.\n    *   Defines a subset of classes that are **non-polar**.\n    *   Calculates the intersection of these three sets to find any classes that meet all conditions.\n    *   Prints the lists of classes and the final result, which will be an empty set, thereby proving that no such crystal class exists.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to find crystal classes that satisfy three conditions:\n# 1.
