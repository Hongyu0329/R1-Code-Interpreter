    # is a type of Delusional Misidentification Syndrome (DMS). These syndromes involve a
    # belief that the identity of a person, place, or object has somehow changed or been altered.

    # With the advent of neuroimaging tools like MRI and PET scans, researchers have been
    # able to link these syndromes to specific neurological issues, often involving a
    # disconnection between the brain's visual processing centers and the limbic system,
    # which regulates emotion and memory.

    # A primary and well-studied condition identified as underlying these types of delusions
    # is Capgras Syndrome. In this syndrome, the patient believes that a familiar person
    # (or even themselves) has been replaced by an identical-looking impostor.
