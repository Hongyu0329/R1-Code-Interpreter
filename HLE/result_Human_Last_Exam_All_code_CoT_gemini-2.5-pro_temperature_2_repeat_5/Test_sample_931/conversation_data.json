    "To determine what adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) feed on, I will create a script that simulates a query against a biological knowledge base.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, I will establish a \"knowledge base\" of known food sources for adult Raphidiopterans in a Python set. General entomological knowledge indicates they are predators, primarily eating soft-bodied insects like aphids, but they also supplement their diet with nectar and pollen.\n2.  I will analyze the answer choices. The specific plant names (Māhoe, Karamū, Totara) are native to New Zealand, a region where snakeflies are not naturally found. Therefore, I will treat these as examples of a general food *type* (e.g., 'Totara Aphids' represent the food type 'aphids').\n3.  The Python script will systematically check which food types from the options are present in the knowledge base.\n4.  It will identify that both \"Nectar\" (from choice A) and \"Aphids\" (from choice E) are valid food types for adult snakeflies.\n5.  Finally, the script will conclude that option F, which combines A and E, is the most complete and correct answer, and print the step-by-step evaluation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the diet of adult Raphidiopterans based on a knowledge base\n    to determine the correct answer from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the knowledge base of known adult Raphidiopteran food sources.\n    # They are predators but also consume plant sugars and pollen.\n    known_diet = {\"aphids\", \"small insects\", \"nectar\", \"pollen\"}\n\n    # Step 2: Represent the food items from the choices.\n    # We focus on the food 'type' rather than the geographically specific names.\n    option_A_food = \"nectar\"\n    option_E_food_type = \"aphids\" # 'Totara Aphids' are a type of aphid.\n    \n    # Step 3: Evaluate the primary choices A and E.\n    is_A_correct = option_A_food in known_diet\n    is_E_correct = option_E_food_type in known_diet\n\n    print(\"Evaluating potential food sources for adult Raphidiopterans:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"Query: Is Nectar (A) a known food source?\")\n    print(f\"Result: {is_A_correct}.
