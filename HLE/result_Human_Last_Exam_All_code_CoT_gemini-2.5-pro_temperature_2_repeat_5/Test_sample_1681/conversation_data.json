    "To find the equilibrium point for the quantum prisoner's dilemma, we will employ the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. This protocol introduces quantum mechanics into the classical game through an entangled initial state and quantum strategies for the players.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Model Setup**: We'll define the game using the provided payoff matrix. The players' strategies (Cooperate 'C' and Defect 'D') are represented by quantum gate operations. The initial state is a two-qubit state entangled by an operator J(γ), where γ controls the degree of entanglement.\n2.  **Equilibrium Analysis**: The classical equilibrium is (Defect, Defect), leading to a suboptimal payoff of (1, 1). We are asked to design the initial state (i.e., choose γ) to find an optimal outcome. The goal is to make the Pareto-optimal strategy pair (Cooperate, Cooperate) a Nash Equilibrium. A Nash Equilibrium occurs when no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n3.  **Derive Equilibrium Condition**: We will derive the general payoff function for a player. Then, we will find the condition on the entanglement parameter γ that makes (Cooperate, Cooperate) a stable equilibrium.\n4.  **Calculate Optimal Payoff**: For the game to be optimal as requested, we select the entanglement level that gives the highest possible payoff while maintaining the (Cooperate, Cooperate) equilibrium. This happens at the minimum level of entanglement required to sustain the equilibrium.\n5.  **Code Implementation**: The final Python code will perform the numerical calculation based on our derived formula and print the final equation and the resulting payoff value.\n\n### Derivations:\nThe payoff matrix is:\n-   (C, C): R=5 (Reward)\n-   (C, D): S=0 (Sucker)\n-   (D, C): T=7 (Temptation)\n-   (D, D): P=1 (Punishment)\n\nIn the EWL protocol, a strategy pair (C, C) becomes a Nash Equilibrium if the entanglement `γ` satisfies the condition:\n`tan²(γ/2) >= (T - R) / P`\n\nSubstituting our payoff values:\n`tan²(γ/2) >= (7 - 5) / 1`\n`tan²(γ/2) >= 2`\n\nThe payoff for the (C, C) equilibrium is given by the formula:\n`Payoff = R * cos²(γ/2) + P * sin²(γ/2)`\n`Payoff = 5 * cos²(γ/2) + 1 * sin²(γ/2)`\n`Payoff = 4 * cos²(γ/2) + 1`\n\nTo achieve the optimal (highest) payoff for this equilibrium, we should choose the smallest value of `γ` that satisfies the equilibrium condition. This occurs at the boundary, where `tan²(γ/2) = 2`.\n\nFrom `tan²(γ/2) = 2`, we can find `cos²(γ/2)`:\n`sin²(γ/2) / cos²(γ/2) = 2`\n`1 - cos²(γ/2) = 2 * cos²(γ/2)`\n`1 = 3 * cos²(γ/2)`\n`cos²(γ/2) = 1/3`\n\nNow, we substitute this value back into our payoff formula to find the equilibrium point.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Payoff matrix values\nR = 5  # Reward for mutual cooperation\nP = 1  # Punishment for mutual defection\n\n# The optimal quantum game sets the entanglement such that cos^2(gamma/2) = 1/3\n# The formula for the new equilibrium payoff is P_eq = R*cos^2(gamma/2) + P*sin^2(gamma/2)\n# which simplifies to P_eq = (R-P)*cos^2(gamma/2) + P\n# With our values, this is P_eq = 4 * cos^2(gamma/2) + 1.\n\ncos_sq_gamma_half = 1/3\n\n# Calculate the equilibrium payoff\npayoff_value = (R - P) * cos_sq_gamma_half + P\n\n# Output the final equation with the numbers plugged in\nprint(f\"The equilibrium payoff is calculated from the equation:\")\nprint(f\"Payoff = ({R} - {P}) * {cos_sq_gamma_half:.3f} + {P}\")\nprint(f\"Payoff = {R-P} * (1/3) + {P}\")\nprint(\"Payoff = 4 * (1/3) + 1\")\nprint(\"Payoff = 4/3 + 3/3\")\nprint(\"Payoff = 7/3\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe numerical value of the equilibrium payoff for each player is:\")\nprint(payoff_value)\n\nprint(\"\\nThe final equilibrium point is a payoff of (7/3, 7/3) for the two players.\")\n\n# We output the single value as requested by the format.\nprint(\"<<<7/3>>>\")\n```"
