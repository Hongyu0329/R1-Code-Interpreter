    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium point and then calculate the sum of the consumer and producer surplus.\n\n### Method\n\n1.  **Find Market Equilibrium:** The market equilibrium occurs where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (Q_S = Q_D = Q_e) and the price is equal (P_S = P_D = P_e). We find the equilibrium quantity, `Q_e`, by numerically solving the equation:\n    `ln(Q³ - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`\n    Once `Q_e` is found, the equilibrium price, `P_e`, can be calculated by substituting `Q_e` into either the supply or demand function.\n\n2.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** Total welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. Geometrically, this is the area between the demand and supply curves up to the equilibrium quantity. It can be calculated with the following definite integral:\n\n    `Total Welfare = ∫ [from 0 to Q_e] D(Q) dQ - ∫ [from Q_min to Q_e] S(Q) dQ`\n\n    where:\n    *   `D(Q)` is the demand function, `18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`.\n    *   `S(Q)` is the supply function, `ln(Q³ - 2)`.\n    *   `Q_min` is the minimum quantity for which the supply function is defined. For `ln(Q³ - 2)`, we require `Q³ - 2 > 0`, so `Q > 2^(1/3)`. Thus, `Q_min = 2^(1/3)`.\n\nSince these equations are complex, we will use Python's numerical libraries (`scipy`) to find the equilibrium point and evaluate the integrals.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define the supply and demand functions\ndef supply(q):\n    # The function is defined for q**3 - 2 > 0\n    if isinstance(q, np.ndarray):\n        # Handle arrays for fsolve\n        # Return a large number for invalid inputs to guide the solver\n        return np.where(q**3 > 2, np.log(q**3 - 2), 1e9)\n    # Handle single values for quad\n    if q**3 <= 2:\n        return float('inf') # Integral from Q_min, so this won't be hit\n    return np.log(q**3 - 2)\n\ndef demand(q):\n    return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(q))\n\n# Define the equation to solve for equilibrium (Demand - Supply = 0)\ndef equilibrium_equation(q):\n    return demand(q) - supply(q)\n\n# 1.
