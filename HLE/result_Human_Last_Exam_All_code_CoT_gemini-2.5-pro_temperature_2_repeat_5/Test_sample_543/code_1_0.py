print("Analysis of the reaction:")
print("The reaction is between 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene and an excess of phenyl magnesium bromide.")
print("This is a Grignard cross-coupling reaction where the phenyl group (C6H5-) from the Grignard reagent replaces the halogen atoms on the benzene ring.")
print("\nReaction Steps based on halide reactivity (I > Br):")
print("1. The most reactive halogen, iodine at position 2, is substituted by a phenyl group.")
print("2. Since excess phenyl magnesium bromide is used, the two less reactive bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3 are also substituted by phenyl groups.")
print("\nFinal Product Structure:")
print("The resulting molecule is a central benzene ring with three phenyl groups attached at positions 1, 2, and 3.")
