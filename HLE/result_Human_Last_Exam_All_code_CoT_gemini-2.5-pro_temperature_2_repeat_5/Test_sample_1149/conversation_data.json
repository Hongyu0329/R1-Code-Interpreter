    "Based on paleontological data from the description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull, the lacrimal bone features a distinct recess. This recess is subdivided into two separate pneumatic depressions, an anterior one and a posterior one.\n\nI will write a simple python script to represent this information by adding the two depressions together.\n\n```python\n# The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri is a key anatomical feature.\n# Paleontological studies, such as the 2002 paper by Sues et al.,\n# describe this recess as being divided into two distinct depressions (fossae).\n\n# Number of anterior depressions in the lacrimal recess.\nanterior_depression = 1\n\n# Number of posterior depressions in the lacrimal recess.\nposterior_depression = 1\n\n# The total number of depressions is the sum of the anterior and posterior ones.\ntotal_depressions = anterior_depression + posterior_depression\n\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains an anterior depression and a posterior depression.\")\nprint(f\"To find the total, we perform the following calculation:\")\nprint(f\"{anterior_depression} + {posterior_depression} = {total_depressions}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThus, there are a total of {total_depressions} depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri.\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
