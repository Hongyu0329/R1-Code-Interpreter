# The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri is a key anatomical feature.
# Paleontological studies, such as the 2002 paper by Sues et al.,
# describe this recess as being divided into two distinct depressions (fossae).

# Number of anterior depressions in the lacrimal recess.
anterior_depression = 1

# Number of posterior depressions in the lacrimal recess.
posterior_depression = 1

# The total number of depressions is the sum of the anterior and posterior ones.
total_depressions = anterior_depression + posterior_depression

print(f"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains an anterior depression and a posterior depression.")
print(f"To find the total, we perform the following calculation:")
print(f"{anterior_depression} + {posterior_depression} = {total_depressions}")
print(f"\nThus, there are a total of {total_depressions} depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri.")
