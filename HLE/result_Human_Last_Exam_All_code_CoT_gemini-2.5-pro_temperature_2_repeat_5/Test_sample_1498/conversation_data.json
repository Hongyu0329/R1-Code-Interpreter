    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this task:\n\n1.  First, I need to identify the specific section of the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that enumerates the names of the 25 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an.\n2.  I will determine the starting verse number (bayt) where the list of names begins. This typically follows the verse that states the obligation to know them.\n3.  I will then determine the ending verse number where the list concludes with Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n4.  Finally, I will create a Python script that stores these two numbers in variables and prints a clear, formatted sentence announcing the range from the starting bayt to the ending bayt.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the range of verses (bayt) in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n# that list the names of the Prophets.\n\n# Verse 17 mentions the obligation to know the 25 prophets.\n# The list itself starts in the next verse.\nstart_bayt = 18\n\n# The list concludes with the mention of Prophet 'Isa and Prophet Muhammad (Taha).\nend_bayt = 21\n\n# Print the result in a full sentence, displaying the specific numbers.\nprint(f\"The names of the Prophets in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' are mentioned from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n```\n<<<From bayt 18 to bayt 21>>>"
