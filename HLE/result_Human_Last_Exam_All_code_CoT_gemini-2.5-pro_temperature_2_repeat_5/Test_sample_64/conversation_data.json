    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」 (otōto), we will simulate a lookup in a Japanese accent dictionary.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Define a dictionary representing a small portion of a pitch accent database. This database will map Japanese words to their readings and standard pitch accent pattern numbers (as used in many dictionaries).\n2.  Define another dictionary to map these pattern numbers to their names (e.g., Heiban, Atamadaka) and a brief explanation. The key patterns are:\n    *   **0 (Heiban - 平板)**: The pitch starts low, rises after the first mora, and stays high until the end of the word and any following particles.\n    *   **1 (Atamadaka - 頭高)**: The pitch is high only on the first mora and then drops.\n    *   **Nakadaka (中高)**: The pitch is high on a mora in the middle of the word, then drops. For a 4-mora word like おとうと, this could be a drop after the 2nd or 3rd mora.\n    *   **Odaka (尾高)**: The pitch rises and stays high until the last mora, then drops on the following particle.\n3.  The script will look up the word 「弟」 in our simulated database to find its accent pattern number.\n4.  It will then use this number to retrieve the name and description of the pattern.\n5.  Finally, it will print out the word, its reading, and its standard pitch accent pattern to answer the user's question.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to capture the output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\ndef find_pitch_accent():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates looking up the standard Japanese pitch accent\n    for the word 「弟」 in a dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
