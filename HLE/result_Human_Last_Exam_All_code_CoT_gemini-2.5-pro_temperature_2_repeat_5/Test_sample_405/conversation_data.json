    "My plan is to determine the number of distinct colors found in the common, pure allotropes of phosphorus. I will write a Python script that first defines a list of these colors. Then, it will count the number of items in this list and display the result as a simple summation equation. The main allotropes considered are White (which can also appear yellow), Red, Violet (Hittorf's), and Black.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the number of distinct colors\n    observed in the common pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The primary colors of the main allotropes of phosphorus.\n    # 1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
