    "My plan is to answer the user's question about Christian theology. This is a knowledge-based question, not a computational one. My process will be to identify the specific theologian and the terminology they developed that fits the user's description.\n\n1.  **Analyze the query:** The user is asking for the *first* Christian theologian who created *specialized terminology* to explain *changes in the laws of nature*. The framework must be applicable to two specific cases: the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations to nature after the Fall.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Figures:** The most prominent early Christian theologian to develop a systematic framework for understanding miracles in relation to nature is Augustine of Hippo (354â€“430 AD).\n\n3.  **Identify the Terminology:** Augustine's key concept for this is *rationes seminales* (or *rationes causales*), which translates to \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal reasons.\" He proposed that God embedded these hidden potentials within creation from the beginning.\n\n4.  **Apply to the User's Cases:**\n    *   **Virgin Birth:** According to Augustine's system, the virgin birth was not a violation of natural law. Instead, it was the activation of a unique *ratio seminalis* that God had placed within creation (specifically, in Mary's lineage or body), destined to be actualized at the appointed time. Thus, it was an event that was \"unusual\" to our observation of nature, but not contrary to God's original, deeper design for nature.\n    *   **The Fall:** Similarly, the negative changes to the natural world after the Fall (e.g., death, decay, pain in childbirth) could be described as a shift in how nature operates, a consequence of sin altering the conditions under which the *rationes seminales* unfold. The created order was fundamentally changed from its original state.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Augustine of Hippo was the first to develop this sophisticated terminology (*rationes seminales*) to account for both unique miraculous events and systemic shifts in the natural order within a single, coherent theological framework.\n\nSince the request requires a code block to present the answer, I will write a simple Python script that prints the name of the theologian.\n\n```python\ndef find_theologian():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Christian theologian who developed specialized terminology\n    for changes in natural law applicable to the virgin birth and the Fall.\n    The key figure is Augustine of Hippo, and the terminology is 'rationes seminales'\n    (seminal reasons).\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    print(theologian_name)\n\nfind_theologian()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
