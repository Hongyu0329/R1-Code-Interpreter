    print("IL-15 is a cytokine known to be a potent survival factor for T cells.")
    print("It promotes the development and persistence of long-lived memory T cells, which are less prone to exhaustion and retain high functional capacity.")

    print("\nEvidence Point 2: IL-15 improves the quality of manufactured CAR T cells.")
    print("When used in the manufacturing process, IL-15 helps generate a CAR T cell product that is more persistent and metabolically fit.")
    print("This leads to superior anti-tumor activity in preclinical and clinical settings.")

    print("\nEvidence Point 3: Cytokine release is a key T cell effector function.")
    print("When CAR T cells are activated by their target antigen, they release effector cytokines such as Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and TNF-alpha (TNF-α) to coordinate an immune attack.")

    print("\nSynthesizing the Evidence and Making a Prediction:")
    print("Because IL-15 supports a more robust, persistent, and functionally potent population of CAR T cells, it is predicted that these cells will mount a stronger effector response upon activation.")

    print("\nFinal Predicted Outcome:")
    print("Compared to T cells manufactured without interleukin-15, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 are predicted to exhibit INCREASED release of effector cytokines.")
