    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the product of the specified Wittig reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct Reactants**: I will identify the two reactants, pivalaldehyde and the Wittig reagent, from their names and determine their chemical structures.\n    *   **Pivalaldehyde**: This is an aldehyde with a bulky tert-butyl group, `(CH₃)₃C-CHO`.\n    *   **Wittig Reagent**: The name `(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane` refers to a phosphorus ylide. Its structure is `(2-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=P(Ph)₃`.\n2.  **Apply Wittig Reaction Logic**: The fundamental transformation in a Wittig reaction is the replacement of a carbonyl oxygen (`=O`) with the carbon group of the ylide (`=CR₂`). I will swap these groups to form the main alkene product and the triphenylphosphine oxide byproduct.\n3.  **Determine Product Structure and Name**:\n    *   The carbon backbone from pivalaldehyde is `(CH₃)₃C-CH`.\n    *   The carbon backbone from the ylide is `(2-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH`.\n    *   Combining these forms the alkene: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl-2)`.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name for this structure is `1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene`.\n4.  **Analyze Stereochemistry**: The Wittig reaction can produce E or Z isomers. Since both the t-butyl group from pivalaldehyde and the 2-chlorobenzyl group from the ylide are very bulky, the reaction will strongly favor the formation of the **(E)-isomer**, where these large groups are positioned on opposite sides (trans) of the new double bond to minimize steric hindrance.\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script to present this analysis. The script will define the reactants, construct the product structures, and print the complete reaction equation along with the IUPAC name and a brief explanation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and a given ylide,\n    and prints the resulting chemical equation and product details.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
