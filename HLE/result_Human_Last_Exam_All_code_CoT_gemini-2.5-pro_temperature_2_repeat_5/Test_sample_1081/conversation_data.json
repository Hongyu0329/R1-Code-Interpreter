    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  The problem asks for the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$. This is a well-known result from the theory of algebraic groups over finite fields.\n2.  A key theorem by G.I. Lehrer states that for a connected reductive group of adjoint type over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of rational maximal tori is $q^N$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots of the group's root system.\n3.  Furthermore, the number of rational maximal tori is independent of the isogeny type of the group (e.g., whether it is simply connected or adjoint). This is because the projection from any reductive group $G$ to its adjoint version induces a bijection on their sets of rational maximal tori.\n4.  Therefore, for any reductive group of type $E_8$, the number is $q^N$, with $N$ being the number of positive roots for the $E_8$ root system.\n5.  The $E_8$ root system has a total of 240 roots. The number of positive roots, $N$, is half of this total.\n6.  The Python code below will calculate this value $N$ and then print the final formula for the number of tori.\n\n```python\ndef get_number_of_tori_e8():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of rational maximal tori of a group of type E8\n    over a finite field Fq.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The total number of roots in the E8 root system is 240.\n    total_roots_e8 = 240\n\n    # The number of positive roots, N, is half of the total number of roots.\n    num_positive_roots = total_roots_e8 // 2\n\n    # The number of Fq-rational maximal tori is given by the formula q^N.\n    # The problem asks for the final equation and its numerical components.\n    \n    print(\"The exact number of rational maximal tori for a group of type E8 over Fq is given by the equation:\")\n    # We build the equation string. The base is the variable 'q'. The exponent is the number we calculated.\n    equation_str = f\"Number = q^{num_positive_roots}\"\n    \n    print(equation_str)\n    \n    # We output the single numerical value that appears in the equation as requested.\n    print(f\"\\nThe only number in this equation is the exponent: {num_positive_roots}\")\n\nget_number_of_tori_e8()\n```\n<<<q**120>>>"
