    """
    Analyzes which champions can perform a specific "hook-flash" mechanic.

    The mechanic is defined as casting a hook in one direction and then flashing
    in the opposite direction to increase the hook's effective range.

    - Blitzcrank: Cannot perform this. Flashing back decreases range.
    - Nautilus: Cannot perform this. Flashing back decreases range.
    - Pyke: Cannot perform this. Flashing back decreases range.
    - Thresh: Can perform this. Due to a unique interaction where the hook's
              trajectory is locked before the Flash, flashing backward makes the
              hook projectile travel a longer distance from his new position.
