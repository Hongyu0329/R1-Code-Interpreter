    print(" - Liposoluble and hydrosoluble antioxidants are non-enzymatic scavengers that are consumed in the process.")
    print(" - Photosynthetic pigments and UV-protective compounds have protective roles, but their primary function is not the rapid, catalytic removal of ROS in response to heat stress.")
    print(" - Enzymatic antioxidants, like Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT), are catalysts. Their activity is specifically and rapidly upregulated to neutralize ROS as soon as they are formed. This enzymatic cascade is the classic first line of defense.")
