Here is a step-by-step analysis of each option:

The question's premise is about "existentially forgeable" schemes, using ECDSA as an example. A scheme is existentially forgeable if an attacker can create a valid signature for at least one message they have not seen signed before. The reference to ECDSA is likely pointing to its signature malleability: ECDSA is not "strongly" existentially unforgeable.

**A. For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can create a new, different signature sig' that is verifiable given pk with no more than negligible probability.**

*   **Analysis:** This statement claims it is hard to create a new signature for the same message. However, ECDSA signatures are malleable. If a signature is represented by the pair (r, s), then (r, -s mod n) is also a valid signature for the same message (where n is the order of the group). An adversary can easily compute this new signature from a given one. Therefore, a new signature can be created with probability 1, which is a *non-negligible* probability.
*   **Conclusion:** The statement is **False**.

**B. For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.**

*   **Analysis:** This statement says that recovering the secret key is computationally hard. This is the fundamental security guarantee of ECDSA, which is based on the presumed difficulty of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). If an attacker could recover the secret key, the entire system would be broken. Standard cryptographic assumptions hold that this is not possible for a computationally bounded adversary.
*   **Conclusion:** The statement is **True**.

**C. For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.**

*   **Analysis:** This describes a "selective forgery" attack. The question is whether *some* scheme exists that is vulnerable to selective forgery and is also "existentially forgeable". The security definitions are hierarchical: if a scheme is vulnerable to selective forgery, it is automatically vulnerable to existential forgery. One can easily define a flawed or broken signature scheme that allows for selective forgery. Since such a scheme is, by definition, existentially forgeable, this statement is correct. It merely states that such insecure schemes exist within the broader category.
*   **Conclusion:** The statement is **True**.

**D. For all existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can figure out m with no more than negligible probability.**

*   **Analysis:** This claims that for *all* schemes in this category, recovering the message from the signature is hard. However, this is not true. There is a class of schemes known as "signature schemes with message recovery", where the message (or part of it) is intentionally embedded in the signature and can be recovered during verification. Such a scheme could also be existentially forgeable. Since this property does not hold for "all" schemes, the statement is incorrect.
*   **Conclusion:** The statement is **False**.

**Final Answer Summary:**
- Option A is False.
- Option B is True.
- Option C is True.
- Option D is False.

Since both B and C are true, more than one option is correct.
