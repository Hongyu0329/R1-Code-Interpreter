# Plan:
# 1. Analyze the riddle's description of a Chinese character's strokes.
# 2. The phrase "One horizontal stroke, another horizontal stroke, after another" points to three horizontal strokes (三).
# 3. The descriptions of vertical strokes suggest multiple vertical lines, including left and right boundaries.
# 4. The character 丰 (fēng) matches this visual structure.
# 5. This script will print the resulting character, its pronunciation, and its meaning.

# The identified character based on the riddle
solution_character = "丰"

# Pinyin pronunciation for the character
pinyin_pronunciation = "fēng"

# Common meanings of the character
meaning = "abundant, plentiful, lush"

print("Based on the riddle, the character is:")
print(f"Character: {solution_character}")
print(f"Pinyin: {pinyin_pronunciation}")
print(f"Meaning: {meaning}")
