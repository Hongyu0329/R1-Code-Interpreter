    "To solve this problem, we need to use the topological relations for Feynman diagrams. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Theory and Components:** We are considering a generic interacting scalar field theory. The simplest and most common interaction term is a four-point vertex (from a `λφ⁴` term in the Lagrangian). We will assume this is the case, meaning every vertex in our diagram connects to four lines.\n\n2.  **Use the Topological Formula for Loops:** The number of loops (L) in any connected Feynman diagram is related to the number of its internal lines (I) and vertices (V) by the formula:\n    `L = I - V + 1`\n\n3.  **Use the Vertex-Line Relation:** For a `φ⁴` theory, each vertex has 4 lines (\"legs\") attached. These lines can either be internal lines (connecting two vertices) or external lines (for incoming/outgoing particles). Let E be the number of external lines. Since each internal line connects to two vertices, we get the relation:\n    `4V = 2I + E`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Minimum Number of Vertices (V):**\n    *   We are given `L = 2` (a two-loop diagram).\n    *   From the loop formula: `2 = I - V + 1`, which we can rearrange to find `I`: `I = V + 1`.\n    *   Now, substitute this expression for `I` into the vertex-line relation:\n        `4V = 2(V + 1) + E`\n        `4V = 2V + 2 + E`\n        `2V = 2 + E`\n        `V = 1 + E / 2`\n    *   This final equation shows that the number of vertices `V` depends on the number of external lines `E`. To minimize `V`, we must find the minimum possible value for `E`.\n\n5.  **Find the Minimum E:** The number of external lines `E` can be zero, which corresponds to a vacuum diagram (a process with no incoming or outgoing particles). The formula `V = 1 + E / 2` also requires `E` to be an even number for `V` to be an integer. The minimum non-negative even number is `E = 0`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Minimum V:** Plugging `E = 0` into our equation gives the minimum number of vertices:\n    `V = 1 + 0 / 2 = 1`\n\nThis result means that a two-loop diagram with only one vertex is possible. Such a diagram would be a \"figure-eight\" or \"double-bubble\" vacuum diagram, where the four lines from the single vertex connect back to the same vertex in two pairs, forming two distinct loops.\n\nThe following Python code will programmatically perform this derivation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_minimum_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    for a phi^4 interacting scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This program finds the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram.\")\n    print(\"Assumption: We are using an interacting scalar field theory with a 4-point vertex (phi^4 theory).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the topological relations.\")\n    print(\"Let V = number of vertices, I = number of internal lines, E = number of external lines, L = number of loops.\")\n    print(\"Formula 1 (Loops): L = I - V + 1\")\n    print(\"Formula 2 (Vertices for phi^4 theory): 4 * V = 2 * I + E\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Solve for V given L=2.\")\n    print(\"We are given L = 2.
