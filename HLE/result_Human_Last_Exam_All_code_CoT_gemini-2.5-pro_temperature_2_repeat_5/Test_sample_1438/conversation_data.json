    "In the path integral formalism for quantum field theory, fermionic fields (like electrons) are represented by anticommuting numbers known as Grassmann variables. The properties of these variables and the rules for integrating over them are specifically designed to incorporate the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Introduce Grassmann Variables:** Explain that fermions are represented by Grassmann variables (e.g., η) which have the property of anticommuting: `η₁η₂ = -η₂η₁`.\n2.  **Connect to Pauli Principle:** Show that the anticommuting property directly implies `η² = 0`. This mathematically enforces the Pauli exclusion principle, as a state with two identical fermions (`η²`) is null.\n3.  **Define the Integral Measure:** The integral over these variables is called the Berezin integral. The \"measure\" `dη` is defined by its action. While integrating a constant over `dη` is zero (`∫ dη = 0`), the fundamental rule that gives a non-zero value and sets the normalization is the integral of the variable itself.\n4.  **State the Core Rule:** The key value that defines the measure is given by the equation `∫ η dη = 1`. This normalization is essential for obtaining correct physical results, like the determinant (not the inverse determinant) in Gaussian fermionic integrals.\n5.  **Generate Code:** Write a Python script that explicitly prints this foundational equation, highlighting the numerical value as requested.\n\n```python\n# In the path integral formalism for fermions, Grassmann variables are used.\n# The properties of integration over these variables are defined to uphold\n# the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n# The fundamental property of a Grassmann variable 'eta' (η) is that its square is zero: η² = 0.\n# This directly models the Pauli principle, where a quantum state cannot be occupied\n# by two identical fermions.\n\n# The integration over these variables is defined by the Berezin integral.\n# The \"measure\" of this integral doesn't have a value in itself, but it is defined\n# by the value it yields when operating on a function. The key defining relation\n# which normalizes the integral is:\n#\n# ∫ η dη = 1\n#\n# This code will print out this fundamental equation.\n\nintegral_value = 1\n\n# Print the final equation with its components\nprint(\"The normalization of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is defined by the following relation:\")\nprint(\"Integral symbol: ∫\")\nprint(\"Measure: dη\")\nprint(\"Integrand: η\")\nprint(\"Result: {}\".format(integral_value))\nprint(\"\\nWhich forms the equation:\")\nprint(\"∫ η dη = {}\".format(integral_value))\n```\n<<<1>>>"
