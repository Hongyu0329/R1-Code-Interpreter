    "To find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons), we will follow the principles of statistical mechanics, which are rigorously grounded in large deviation theory.\n\n### Plan and Theoretical Background\n\n1.  **Principle of Maximum Entropy**: The equilibrium state of an isolated system is the one with the largest number of accessible microstates. This corresponds to the state of maximum entropy. This principle is formally justified by large deviation theorems like Sanov's theorem, which tells us that the probability of a system being in a macroscopic state is exponentially related to a rate function. The equilibrium state is the one that minimizes this rate function, which is equivalent to maximizing the entropy.\n\n2.  **Bose-Einstein Statistics**: Photons are bosons, so we must use the entropy formula derived from Bose-Einstein counting for indistinguishable particles. For a set of energy levels `ε_i` with degeneracy `g_i` (number of states per level) and occupation number `n_i` (number of photons in level i), the entropy `S` is given by:\n    `S = k_B * Σ_i ln[(n_i + g_i - 1)! / (n_i! * (g_i - 1)!)]`\n    where `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n\n3.  **Constraints and Maximization**: We maximize this entropy subject to the physical constraints. For a photon gas, the number of photons is not conserved, so the only constraint is the constant total energy `E = Σ_i n_i * ε_i`. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, maximizing `S` subject to the energy constraint leads to the most probable (equilibrium) distribution for the average occupation number `<n_i>`:\n    `<n_i> = g_i / (exp(ε_i / (k_B*T)) - 1)`\n    This is the celebrated Planck distribution law, where `T` is the equilibrium temperature.\n\n4.  **From Discrete Sums to Integrals**: For a continuous spectrum of photon energies in a 3D cavity of volume `V`, we replace the sum over states with an integral over energy, using the density of states `g(ε)dε`:\n    `g(ε)dε = (8 * π * V / (h^3 * c^3)) * ε^2 dε`\n    where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n5.  **Calculation of Mean Energy (E) and Entropy (S)**:\n    *   **Mean Energy**: We calculate the total energy `E` by integrating the energy per state (`ε`) times the number of photons per state (`<n_i>/g_i`) over the density of states `g(ε)`.\n        `E = ∫ ε * (<n_i>/g_i) * g(ε)dε`\n        This integration results in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, `E ∝ T^4`.\n    *   **Entropy**: Similarly, we can substitute the equilibrium occupation numbers back into the entropy formula and integrate. A simpler method is to use the thermodynamic relation `S = (E - F) / T`, where `F` is the Helmholtz free energy. This leads to the result `S ∝ T^3`.\n\nThe Python code below will calculate the precise coefficients for these relationships and present the final equations for the equilibrium mean energy and entropy.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport scipy.constants\n\ndef calculate_photon_gas_properties():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the coefficients for the equilibrium energy and\n    entropy of a photon gas based on fundamental constants.
