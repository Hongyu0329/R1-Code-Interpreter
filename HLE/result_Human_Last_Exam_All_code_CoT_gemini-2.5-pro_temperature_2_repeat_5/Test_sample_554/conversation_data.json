    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar,\" we first need to establish the molecular structure of a standard nanocar. A \"perfluoro-\" compound is one where all hydrogen atoms have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Define a standard Nanocar:** I will base this on the iconic nanocar developed by Professor James Tour's group. This molecule consists of a central \"chassis\" and four \"wheels\".\n2.  **Analyze the structure:** The wheels are typically fullerene (C60) spheres, which contain no hydrogen atoms. Therefore, we only need to count the hydrogen atoms on the hydrocarbon chassis.\n3.  **Identify the chassis molecule:** A common, representative chassis structure is `1,4-diethynyl-2,5-bis(p-ethynylphenyl)benzene`.\n4.  **Calculate the number of hydrogen atoms:** I will break down the chassis molecule into its constituent parts and sum the number of hydrogen atoms in each part.\n    *   The central benzene ring, being substituted at four positions (1, 2, 4, 5), has two remaining hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The two simple ethynyl (`-C≡CH`) groups each have one hydrogen atom.\n    *   The two more complex `p-ethynylphenyl` (`-C6H4-C≡CH`) groups each have five hydrogen atoms (4 on the phenyl ring and 1 on the terminal alkyne).\n5.  **Sum the totals:** The total number of hydrogen atoms in the chassis is the sum of the hydrogens from each part. This number will be equal to the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluoronanocar.\n6.  **Generate Python code:** The code will print out this step-by-step breakdown and the final calculated number.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fluorine_atoms_in_perfluoronanocar():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar\n    by determining the number of hydrogen atoms in a standard nanocar chassis.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a 'perfluoronanocar', we must first find the number of hydrogen atoms in a standard nanocar.\")\n    print(\"A 'perfluoro' compound is one where all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\")\n    print(\"\\nA standard nanocar has a chassis and four C60 fullerene wheels.
