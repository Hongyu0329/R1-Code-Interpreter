    print("   This doesn't refer to the character for wood (木). Instead, it's a metaphor for the overall shape of 高, which is tall and thin like a stick or pole.")
    print("\n2. 'hanging a square box':")
    print("   The middle part of 高 is the character 口 (kǒu), which means 'mouth' or 'box'. It is positioned directly under the top stroke, making it look like a box hanging from the top.")

    print("   This refers to the overall structure. The character has two 口-like shapes stacked vertically, which look like the rungs of a ladder within the tall frame of the character.")
