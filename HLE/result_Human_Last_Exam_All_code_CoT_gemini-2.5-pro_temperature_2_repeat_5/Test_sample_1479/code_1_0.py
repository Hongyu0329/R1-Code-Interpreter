    To understand the fundamental dimensional difference between Type-2 and Type-3 fuzzy sets, let's analyze the structure of their membership functions (MFs).

    1.  Type-1 Fuzzy Membership Function:
        - A standard Type-1 MF maps each element 'x' from the universe of discourse to a crisp membership grade 'μ' between 0 and 1.
        - Functional Form: μ = f(x)
        - Dimensionality: The function's domain has one variable (x). The relationship can be plotted in 2D (x-axis vs. μ-axis).

    2.  Type-2 Fuzzy Membership Function:
        - A Type-2 MF handles uncertainty about the membership grade itself. For any 'x', the membership is a fuzzy set, not a single number.
        - To define this, the MF requires two input variables: the primary variable 'x' and a secondary variable 'u' representing the possible membership grades for 'x'. The function returns the grade of 'u' for a given 'x'.
        - Functional Form: secondary_grade = f(x, u)
        - Dimensionality: The function's domain is expanded to two variables (x, u). This requires a 3D space to visualize (x-axis, u-axis, and secondary_grade-axis).

    3.  Type-3 Fuzzy Membership Function:
        - A Type-3 MF adds another layer to handle uncertainty about the Type-2 MF.
        - This requires adding a third variable to the function's domain, often called a 'tertiary variable' (let's call it 'v').
        - Functional Form: tertiary_grade = f(x, u, v)
        - Dimensionality: The function's domain is now a three-variable space (x, u, v). The entire relationship exists in 4D, making it impossible to visualize directly.

    Conclusion:
    The fundamental difference in dimensional structure when moving from a Type-2 to a Type-3 MF is the change in the function's domain. The domain is expanded from a space defined by two variables to a space defined by three variables.

    Analyzing the choices:
    - (C) "Expanded to three-variable domain" precisely captures this fundamental structural change. The number of variables in the function's domain dictates its dimensionality.
