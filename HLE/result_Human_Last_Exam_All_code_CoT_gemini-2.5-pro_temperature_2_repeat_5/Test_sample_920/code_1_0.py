    # Step 2: Describe the origin of the male beetle.
    # Males are produced in a very specific way. A specialized female larva
    # (a paedogenetic cerambycoid larva) gives birth to a single male larva.
    # This larval female effectively acts as the male's mother.
    mother_identity = "specialized female larva"

    # Step 3: Identify the diet of the male larva.
    # The male larva's first and ONLY meal is to consume its mother. This behavior is called matriphagy.
    # It does not eat the decaying wood directly.
    male_larva_diet = mother_identity

    # Step 4: Identify the diet of the adult male.
    # Adult male Micromalthidae have vestigial, non-functional mouthparts.
    # They cannot eat. Their sole purpose is reproduction.

    # Step 5: Synthesize the information to find the lifetime diet.
    # The question asks what the individual "will have fed on" upon its death as an adult.
    # This refers to its entire life history.
    # As an adult, it eats nothing.
    # As a larva, it ate only one thing.
