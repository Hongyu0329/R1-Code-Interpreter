    "This is a music theory question. To solve it, I will first break down the musical terminology, then apply it to the works of The Beatles to find the correct song.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define the Musical Terms:** I'll clarify what \"tonic\" (I) and \"minor fifth chord\" (vm) mean in the context of music theory. The tonic is the \"home\" chord of a key. A minor fifth chord is a minor chord built on the 5th degree of the scale, which is an unusual and distinctive sound.\n2.  **Select a Key for Demonstration:** I'll use the key of F Major as an example. In F Major, the tonic (I) chord is F Major, and the minor fifth (vm) chord is C minor.\n3.  **Identify the Song:** I'll identify the Beatles song that uses this I -> vm progression at the beginning of its main theme. The song is \"Michelle.\"\n4.  **Construct Python Code:** I'll write a Python script that explains this logic step-by-step and prints the final answer, including the names of the chords involved, to fulfill the prompt's requirements.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies a Beatles song based on a specific chord progression.\n    The user is asking for a song that features a chord jump from the tonic (I)\n    to the minor fifth chord (vm) at the start.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1. Define the musical concepts.\n    # The \"tonic\" is the first chord in a scale, the I chord.\n    # The \"minor fifth\" is a minor chord built on the fifth note of the scale, the vm chord.\n    # This progression is distinctive because the standard V chord is usually major.\n    \n    # 2. Analyze the song \"Michelle\".\n    # The song \"Michelle\" is in the key of F Major.\n    # Key: F Major\n    # Tonic (I) chord: F Major\n    # Fifth degree of the scale: C\n    # Minor fifth (vm) chord: C minor\n\n    # 3. Pinpoint the progression in the song.\n    # The main vocal line begins \"Michelle, ma belle...\".\n    # The chord progression for this line is:\n    # \"Michelle\" -> F Major (The Tonic - I)\n    # \"ma belle\" -> C minor (The Minor Fifth - vm)\n\n    song_name = \"Michelle\"\n    tonic_chord = \"F Major\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"C minor\"\n\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that starts its main phrase with a jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is '{song_name}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the musical analysis:\")\n    print(f\"Key of the song: F Major\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe first chord of the verse ('Michelle...') is the tonic (I):\")\n    print(f\"Chord 1: {tonic_chord}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe second chord of the verse ('ma belle...') is the minor fifth (vm):\")\n    print(f\"Chord 2: {minor_fifth_chord}\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
