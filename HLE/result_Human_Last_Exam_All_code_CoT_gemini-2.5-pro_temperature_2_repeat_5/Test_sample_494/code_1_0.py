Yes, the ammonia molecule with exotic hydrogens would still exhibit tunneling. Here is the reasoning:

1.  **Nature of Ammonia Tunneling:**
    The tunneling phenomenon in ammonia (NH₃) is a consequence of its pyramidal shape. The nitrogen atom can be on one side of the plane formed by the three hydrogens or the other. These two positions are separated by an energy barrier. In quantum mechanics, the nitrogen atom can tunnel through this barrier, which splits the ground vibrational state into a doublet: a lower-energy 'symmetric' state and a higher-energy 'antisymmetric' state. The existence of this energy split *is* the signature of tunneling.

2.  **The Role of the Pauli Exclusion Principle:**
    The Pauli principle governs the symmetry of the total wavefunction when identical particles are exchanged.
    -   For fermions (like ordinary protons with nuclear spin {spin_ordinary_hydrogen}), the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric.
    -   For bosons (like the exotic hydrogens with nuclear spin {spin_exotic_hydrogen}), the total wavefunction must be symmetric.

3.  **Analysis for Exotic (Spin-0) Ammonia:**
    In the exotic ammonia, the three hydrogen nuclei are identical bosons (spin {spin_exotic_hydrogen}). Therefore, the total wavefunction (Ψ_total) must be symmetric upon exchange of any two of these nuclei.

    The total wavefunction can be approximated as a product: Ψ_total ≈ Ψ_rotational × Ψ_vibrational × Ψ_nuclear_spin.

    -   **Nuclear Spin Wavefunction (Ψ_nuclear_spin):** For three identical spin-{spin_exotic_hydrogen} particles, the only possible nuclear spin combination is always symmetric.
    -   **Vibrational Wavefunction (Ψ_vibrational):** This can be either symmetric (for the lower energy level) or antisymmetric (for the higher energy level).
    -   **Rotational Wavefunction (Ψ_rotational):** This can also have different symmetries.

4.  **Combining the Parts:**
    Since Ψ_total must be symmetric and Ψ_nuclear_spin is always symmetric, the product (Ψ_rotational × Ψ_vibrational) must also be symmetric.

    -   **Case 1: Lower Tunneling Level (Symmetric Ψ_vibrational):**
        For the product to be symmetric, Ψ_rotational must be symmetric. Symmetric rotational states exist for the ammonia molecule. Therefore, this energy level is allowed.

    -   **Case 2: Upper Tunneling Level (Antisymmetric Ψ_vibrational):**
        For the product to be symmetric, Ψ_rotational must also be antisymmetric (because antisymmetric × antisymmetric = symmetric). Such antisymmetric rotational states also exist. Therefore, this energy level is also allowed.

5.  **Conclusion:**
    Since the Pauli principle allows for the population of *both* the lower (symmetric) and upper (antisymmetric) levels of the tunneling doublet, the energy splitting between them still exists. The phenomenon of tunneling is a direct result of this energy splitting.

    Therefore, the ammonia molecule with exotic, spin-{spin_exotic_hydrogen} hydrogens would still exhibit tunneling.
