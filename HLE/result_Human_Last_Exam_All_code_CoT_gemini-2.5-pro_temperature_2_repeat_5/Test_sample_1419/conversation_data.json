    "Of course. Here is a Python script that derives and presents the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling `u*` in ϕ⁴ theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the relevant physics concept:** The problem requires finding a fixed point of the Renormalization Group (RG) flow. This involves the beta function, `β(u)`, which describes how the coupling constant `u` changes with the energy scale.\n2.  **State the beta function:** For the ϕ⁴ theory in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, the one-loop beta function is `β(u) = -ϵu + (3 / (16π²))u²`.\n3.  **Define the fixed point condition:** A fixed point, denoted `u*`, is a value of the coupling where the beta function is zero: `β(u*) = 0`.\n4.  **Solve the equation:** We will solve the equation `-ϵu* + (3 / (16π²))(u*)² = 0` for the non-trivial fixed point (where `u* ≠ 0`).\n5.  **Construct the Python code:** The script will walk through these steps, explaining the origin of the equation and printing the components of the final expression for `u*` in terms of `ϵ`, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_phi4_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script derives and explains the leading order expression for the \n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling u* in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This program calculates the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u*\")\n    print(\"in the phi^4 theory in d = 4 - ε dimensions.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 1: State the beta function for the coupling u.\n    print(\"Step 1: The one-loop beta function, β(u), describes the change of the\")\n    print(\"coupling 'u' with the energy scale.
