    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan:\nThe Chern number is a topological invariant. A key property of such invariants is that they are additive. When two topological systems, such as Chern insulators, are brought together with a negligible barrier between them, the Chern number of the combined system is simply the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual systems.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n*   Chern insulator 1 with Chern number `C1 = 1`\n*   Chern insulator 2 with Chern number `C2 = 1`\n\nThe Chern number of the junction, `C_junction`, will be `C1 + C2`. I will write a simple Python script to calculate this sum and display the equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern numbers for the two insulators\nc1 = 1\nc2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of the combined system (the junction) is the sum\n# of the individual Chern numbers because the Chern number is an additive topological invariant.\nc_junction = c1 + c2\n\n# Print the calculation steps and the final result\nprint(\"The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(f\"C_junction = {c1} + {c2}\")\nprint(f\"C_junction = {c_junction}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
