print("IV. Establishing a character is a foreigner: This is a plot point from the original story, not a translation technique to solve the problem of the untranslatable pun. [INVALID]")
print("V. Adding a pictorial illustration: This would destroy the mystery by removing the essential ambiguity. [INVALID]")
