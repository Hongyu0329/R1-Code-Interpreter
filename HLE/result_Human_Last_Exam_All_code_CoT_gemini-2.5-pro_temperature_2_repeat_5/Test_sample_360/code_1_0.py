Step 1: Product Prediction

Reactant 1 (Ligand 'L'): 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole is a symmetric, rigid, tetradentate ligand with two bidentate chelating sites at each end.
Reactant 2 (Complex): cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2] is an octahedral ruthenium(II) complex. The chloride (Cl-) ligands are relatively easy to replace.

Due to the rigidity of ligand 'L', it acts as a bridge between two metal centers. Two molecules of the ruthenium complex react with one molecule of ligand 'L'. The two chloride ligands from each ruthenium are replaced by one chelating end of 'L'.

The product is a dinuclear complex: [(bpy)2Ru-L-Ru(bpy)2]^4+

Step 2: Stereochemical Analysis

Each ruthenium center in the product is coordinated to two bipyridine (bpy) ligands and one chelating unit from the bridging ligand 'L'. This arrangement creates a chiral center at each ruthenium atom. This type of chirality is often described as a propeller shape, with two possible configurations:
- Delta (Δ), a right-handed propeller.
- Lambda (Λ), a left-handed propeller.

Since the final product has two such chiral ruthenium centers, we must consider the possible combinations of their configurations.
