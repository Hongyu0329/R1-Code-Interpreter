    "This is a fascinating question that touches on the philosophy of mathematics, logic, and physics. Here is a step-by-step plan to address it.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Gödel's Ontological Proof:** First, I'll identify the domain in which Gödel's proof operates. It is a work of *modal logic*, a type of formal, symbolic logic. It is a purely abstract argument based on axioms and definitions concerning concepts like \"necessity,\" \"possibility,\" and \"positive properties.\"\n2.  **Analyze the Mathematics of Quantum Mechanics:** Next, I'll identify the domain of quantum mechanics' mathematical framework. This involves linear algebra over complex vector spaces (specifically, Hilbert spaces), operators, and differential equations (like the Schrödinger equation). This framework is designed to model the behavior of the physical universe.\n3.  **Compare the Domains:** I will compare these two mathematical systems. Gödel's proof is a metaphysical argument within formal logic. Quantum mechanics is a physical theory described by functional analysis. The core concepts are not interchangeable. For instance, there is no object in the mathematics of quantum mechanics that corresponds to Gödel's axiomatically defined \"positive property.\"\n4.  **Formulate the Conclusion:** The conclusion is that the mathematical tools of quantum mechanics are not designed to and cannot be used to prove or disprove a theorem of modal logic. The two frameworks describe different realms of thought and reality (the abstract logical vs. the physical).\n5.  **Create a Python Script:** I will create a Python script that programmatically explains this conclusion. The script will define the core components of each system and then print a clear statement explaining their incompatibility for this task, thus directly answering your question.\n\n```python\ndef explain_godel_and_quantum_mechanics():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains why the mathematics of quantum mechanics\n    cannot be used to prove Gödel's ontological argument.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Part 1: Define Gödel's Ontological Proof ---\n    print(\"--- Gödel's Ontological Proof ---\")\n    goedel_domain = \"Modal Logic (S5)\"\n    goedel_concepts = [\n        \"Axiom 1: A property is positive or its negation is, but not both.\",\n        \"Axiom 2: A property necessarily implied by a positive property is positive.\",\n        \"Axiom 3: The property of being 'God-like' (possessing all positive properties) is positive.\",\n        \"Axiom 4: If a property is positive, then it is necessarily positive.\",\n        \"Axiom 5: Necessary existence is a positive property.\",\n        \"Conclusion: A 'God-like' entity necessarily exists.\"\n    ]\n    print(f\"Domain: {goedel_domain}\")\n    print(\"Core Components: An abstract, logical argument based on axioms and definitions.\")\n    print(\"Key Concepts:\")\n    for concept in goedel_concepts:\n        print(f\"  - {concept}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # --- Part 2: Define the Mathematics of Quantum Mechanics ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Mathematics of Quantum Mechanics ---\")\n    qm_domain = \"Functional Analysis & Linear Algebra\"\n    qm_concepts = [\n        \"Hilbert Spaces: Infinite-dimensional vector spaces for quantum states.\",\n        \"Wavefunctions (State Vectors): Vectors that contain all information about a system.\",\n        \"Hermitian Operators: Represent physical observables like position, momentum, and energy.\",\n        \"Schrödinger Equation: A differential equation describing the time evolution of a wavefunction.\",\n        \"Eigenvalues: The possible results of a measurement of an observable.\"\n    ]\n    print(f\"Domain: {qm_domain}\")\n    print(\"Core Components: A mathematical framework to model the physical universe.\")\n    print(\"Key Concepts:\")\n    for concept in qm_concepts:\n        print(f\"  - {concept}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # --- Part 3: Conclusion on Compatibility ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"Is it possible to prove Gödel's argument with Quantum Mechanics?\")\n    conclusion = (\n        \"No. The two systems operate in fundamentally different domains.\\n\"\n        \"1.
