    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, we need to understand the relationship between the chromatic number of a graph, denoted as $\\chi(G)$, and its number of vertices, let's call it $n$.\n2.  A fundamental result in graph theory states that a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices has a chromatic number $\\chi(G) = n$ if and only if $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$ (where every vertex is connected to every other vertex).\n3.  The problem specifies that the graph $G$ has $n = 12345$ vertices but is **not** the complete graph. Based on the rule from the previous step, this means the chromatic number of $G$ cannot be $12345$. Therefore, the maximum possible value for $\\chi(G)$ must be less than or equal to $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n4.  To confirm that $12344$ is indeed the maximum possible chromatic number, we must show that there exists a graph with $12345$ vertices, which is not complete, and requires exactly $12344$ colors.\n5.  We can construct such a graph. Consider a graph formed by the disjoint union of a complete graph on $12344$ vertices ($K_{12344}$) and a single, isolated vertex.\n    *   This graph has a total of $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices.\n    *   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertices.\n    *   The chromatic number of this graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components. The $K_{12344}$ component requires $12344$ colors. The isolated vertex requires $1$ color. Thus, the chromatic number of the entire graph is $\\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n6.  This construction confirms that the maximum chromatic number is $12344$. We will write a simple Python script to state this reasoning and print the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors for a non-complete graph with a given number of vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_vertices = 12345\n    \n    # A graph G with n vertices has a chromatic number of n if and only if it is a complete graph (K_n).\n    # The problem states that the graph G is not a complete graph.\n    # Therefore, its chromatic number must be less than the number of vertices.\n    # chi(G) <= n - 1\n    \n    max_colors = num_vertices - 1\n    \n    # To show that this maximum is achievable, consider a graph G constructed as follows:\n    # Let G be the disjoint union of a complete graph on (n-1) vertices (K_{n-1}) and a single isolated vertex.\n    # This graph has n vertices.\n    # It is not a complete graph.\n    # Its chromatic number is n-1, as the K_{n-1} component requires n-1 colors.\n    \n    print(f\"The number of vertices in the graph is n = {num_vertices}.\")\n    print(\"The graph is not a complete graph.\")\n    print(\"The maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of such a graph is n - 1.\")\n    print(\"This is because any graph G on n vertices has a chromatic number of n if and only if G is a complete graph.\")\n    print(\"Since G is not complete, its chromatic number must be less than n.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum possible chromatic number is {num_vertices - 1}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{num_vertices} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n\nsolve_coloring_problem()\n\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
