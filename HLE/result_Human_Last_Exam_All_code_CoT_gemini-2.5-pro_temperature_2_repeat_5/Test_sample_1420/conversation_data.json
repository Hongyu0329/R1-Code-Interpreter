    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Concepts**: The problem requires using the epsilon (`ϵ`) expansion from renormalization group theory to find the specific heat scaling exponent, `α`. This method works by performing an expansion around the upper critical dimension, `d_c`.\n2.  **Define Parameters**: For models like the Ising, XY, or Heisenberg models (the general O(n)-vector model), the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`. The problem states the spatial dimension is `d=3`. The expansion parameter is therefore `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n3.  **State the Formula**: The formula for the specific heat exponent `α` to the first order in `ϵ` is given by:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n    Here, `n` is the number of components of the order parameter. Since the specific model is not mentioned, I will use the most common case, the Ising model, where `n=1`.\n4.  **Execute Calculation**: I will write a Python script that defines these parameters (`d=3`, `d_c=4`, `n=1`), calculates `ϵ`, and then substitutes these values into the formula for `α`. The script will print out each step of the calculation, including the formula with the numbers plugged in, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the parameters for the epsilon expansion.\n# d is the spatial dimension of the system.\nd = 3\n# d_c is the upper critical dimension for the O(n) vector model.\nd_c = 4\n# n is the number of components of the order parameter.\n# We will use n=1, which corresponds to the Ising model.\nn = 1\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the expansion parameter, epsilon.\nepsilon = d_c - d\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the specific heat scaling exponent alpha.\n# The formula for alpha to the first order in epsilon is:\n# alpha = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * epsilon\nnumerator = 4 - n\ndenominator = 2 * (n + 8)\nalpha = (numerator / denominator) * epsilon\n\n# Step 4: Print the results and the calculation steps.\nprint(\"Calculating the specific heat scaling exponent 'alpha' using the epsilon expansion.\")\nprint(f\"Parameters used: d = {d} (spatial dimension), n = {n} (Ising model).\")\nprint(f\"The upper critical dimension is d_c = {d_c}.\")\nprint(f\"The expansion parameter is epsilon = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe first-order formula for alpha is: alpha = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * epsilon\")\n\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\")\nprint(f\"alpha = (4 - {n}) / (2 * ({n} + 8)) * {epsilon}\")\n\n# Show the step-by-step evaluation\nprint(\"\\nEvaluating the expression:\")\nprint(f\"alpha = {numerator} / (2 * {n+8}) * {epsilon}\")\nprint(f\"alpha = {numerator} / {denominator} * {epsilon}\")\nprint(f\"alpha = {alpha}\")\n\n# Also print as a fraction\nif isinstance(numerator, int) and isinstance(denominator, int):\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)\n    frac_num = numerator // common_divisor\n    frac_den = denominator // common_divisor\n    print(f\"As a fraction, alpha = {frac_num}/{frac_den}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.16666666666666666>>>"
