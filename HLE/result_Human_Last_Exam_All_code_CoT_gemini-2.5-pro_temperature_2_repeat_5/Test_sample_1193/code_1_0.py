    # Differential Diagnosis Evaluation

    # A. Acute blood transfusion reaction: Unlikely. These reactions typically happen within hours to 24 hours of transfusion.
    # The patient is 29 days post-procedure.
    is_acute_reaction = time_post_procedure_days < 1

    # D. Sepsis: Highly likely.
    # The Whipple procedure has a high risk of post-operative complications like leaks or abscesses, which can lead to sepsis.
    # The timeline of 29 days is appropriate for such a complication to develop.
    # Sepsis is the most common cause of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
    # The patient's symptoms (severe hypoxemia with an O2 level of 82%, bilateral crackles) are classic for ARDS.
    sepsis_is_plausible = True

    # Other options:
    # B. Iodine-related reaction: Usually an acute reaction to contrast dye, not a delayed event 29 days later.
    # C. Sensitivity reaction: Too vague, and severe reactions like this are usually more acute.
    # E. Myocyte necrosis (Heart attack): While possible, the picture is more classic for ARDS, and sepsis is a more common post-Whipple complication.
    # F. Respiratory deconditioning / G. Lung exhaustion: These are chronic issues and do not cause acute, severe hypoxemia with bilateral crackles.
    # H. Air pollution sensitivity: Unlikely to cause such a severe, acute crisis in a post-operative patient.
