    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the equation:\n\n1.  **Translate Roman Numerals**: First, I will convert each Roman numeral (`VIII`, `CCC`, and `CCLIII`) into its modern integer equivalent.\n2.  **Reconstruct the Equation**: Next, I'll use these modern numbers to form the mathematical equation.\n3.  **Calculate the Solution**: Finally, I will compute the result of the equation.\n\nThe Python script below will perform these steps and print the final equation along with its solution.\n\n```python\ndef roman_to_int(s):\n    \"\"\"Converts a Roman numeral string to an integer.\"\"\"\n    roman_map = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}\n    \n    # Handle subtractive notation by replacing with additive equivalents\n    s = s.replace(\"IV\", \"IIII\").replace(\"IX\", \"VIIII\")\n    s = s.replace(\"XL\", \"XXXX\").replace(\"XC\", \"LXXXX\")\n    s = s.replace(\"CD\", \"CCCC\").replace(\"CM\", \"DCCCC\")\n    \n    num = 0\n    for char in s:\n        num += roman_map[char]\n    return num\n\n# The Roman numerals from the equation\nroman1 = \"VIII\"\nroman2 = \"CCC\"\nroman3 = \"CCLIII\"\n\n# Convert them to integers\nnum1 = roman_to_int(roman1)\nnum2 = roman_to_int(roman2)\nnum3 = roman_to_int(roman3)\n\n# Perform the calculation\nresult = (num1 / num2) - num3\n\n# Print the equation in modern numbers and the result\nprint(f\"The equation {roman1} / {roman2} - {roman3} translates to:\")\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<-252.97333333333333>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
