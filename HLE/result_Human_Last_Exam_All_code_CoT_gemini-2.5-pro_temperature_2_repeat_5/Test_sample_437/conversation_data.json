    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to evaluate the integral $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j \\rangle$ for a 1s Slater-type orbital.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Orbital:** I will start with the mathematical definition of a normalized 1s Slater-Type Orbital (STO).\n2.  **Set up the Integral:** I will set up the integral $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j \\rangle$ in spherical coordinates. The orbitals $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$ are 1s STOs centered on the same nucleus but can have different orbital exponents, $\\zeta_i$ and $\\zeta_j$.\n3.  **Derive the General Formula:** I will solve the integral analytically to find a general formula in terms of $\\zeta_i$ and $\\zeta_j$.\n4.  **Provide Python Code for Evaluation:** I will provide a Python script that uses this formula to compute the integral's value. The script will:\n    *   Explain the derivation and the general formula.\n    *   Show a detailed numerical calculation for the most common case, which is the expectation value where both orbitals are identical ($\\zeta_i = \\zeta_j$). For this, I will use the standard value for a hydrogen atom, $\\zeta = 1.0$ (in atomic units).\n    *   Showcase its ability to compute the integral for different exponents as well.\n5.  **Output the Final Result:** The script will print the final numerical answer, fulfilling the user's request.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the evaluation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef evaluate_1s_integral(zeta_i, zeta_j):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the integral <phi_i | 1/r | phi_j> for 1s Slater orbitals.\n\n    This function first prints a detailed explanation of the derivation and then\n    calculates the integral value based on the provided orbital exponents.\n\n    Args:\n        zeta_i (float): Orbital exponent for the first 1s orbital (phi_i).\n        zeta_j (float): Orbital exponent for the second 1s orbital (phi_j).\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The value of the integral.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Part 1: Explanation and Derivation ---\n    print(\"Evaluating the integral: <φ_i| 1/r |φ_j> for 1s Slater-Type Orbitals (STOs).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe normalized 1s STO is given by the formula: φ(r) = (ζ³/π)^(1/2) * exp(-ζr)\")\n    print(\"where ζ is the orbital exponent.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe integral in spherical coordinates is I = ∫∫∫ φ_i*(r) * (1/r) * φ_j(r) * r²sin(θ)drdθdφ\")\n    print(\"After integrating the angular part (which gives 4π) and simplifying, we get a radial integral:\")\n    print(\"I = 4 * (ζ_i*ζ_j)^(3/2) * ∫[0 to ∞] r * exp(-(ζ_i + ζ_j)r) dr\")\n    print(\"\\nSolving the radial integral (∫x*exp(-ax)dx = 1/a²) gives the final general formula:\")\n    print(\"I = 4 * (ζ_i * ζ_j)^(3/2) / (ζ_i + ζ_j)²\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    # --- Part 2: Numerical Calculation ---\n    \n    zi_zj_prod = zeta_i * zeta_j\n    zi_plus_zj = zeta_i + zeta_j\n    \n    # Using try-except for potential math domain errors with negative inputs\n    try:\n        numerator = 4 * math.pow(zi_zj_prod, 1.5)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Error: The product of exponents must be non-negative.\")\n        return None\n        \n    denominator = math.pow(zi_plus_zj, 2)\n    \n    if denominator == 0:\n        print(\"Error: The sum of exponents cannot be zero.\")\n        return None\n        \n    result = numerator / denominator\n    \n    print(f\"Calculation for exponents ζ_i = {zeta_i} and ζ_j = {zeta_j}:\")\n    \n    # As requested, output each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"\\nNumerator = 4 * (ζ_i * ζ_j)^(3/2)\")\n    print(f\"          = 4 * ({zeta_i} * {zeta_j})^(1.5)\")\n    print(f\"          = 4 * ({zi_zj_prod})^(1.5)\")\n    print(f\"          = 4 * {math.pow(zi_zj_prod, 1.5)}\")\n    print(f\"          = {numerator}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nDenominator = (ζ_i + ζ_j)²\")\n    print(f\"            = ({zeta_i} + {zeta_j})²\")\n    print(f\"            = ({zi_plus_zj})²\")\n    print(f\"            = {denominator}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nResult = Numerator / Denominator\")\n    print(f\"       = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\n    print(f\"       = {result}\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    return result\n\n# --- Main Execution ---\n\n# Case 1: Identical orbitals (the most common case, representing an expectation value)\n# We use the standard exponent for a Hydrogen atom's 1s orbital, ζ = 1.0 (in atomic units).\nprint(\"--- Case 1: Identical Orbitals (φ_i = φ_j) ---\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to calculating the expectation value <φ|1/r|φ>.\\n\")\nzeta_val = 1.0\nresult1 = evaluate_1s_integral(zeta_val, zeta_val)\nprint(f\"Final answer for ζ_i = ζ_j = {zeta_val}: {result1}\")\nprint(\"\\nNote: When ζ_i = ζ_j = ζ, the formula simplifies from 4*(ζ²)^(3/2)/(2ζ)² to ζ.\")\nprint(f\"The result is simply the value of ζ, which is {zeta_val}, matching the calculation.\")\n\n# Case 2: An example with different orbitals to show the general formula's use.\n# print(\"\\n\\n\" + \"=\"*60 + \"\\n\")\n# print(\"--- Case 2: Different Orbitals (φ_i ≠ φ_j) ---\")\n# zeta_1 = 1.0\n# zeta_2 = 1.5\n# result2 = evaluate_1s_integral(zeta_1, zeta_2)\n# print(f\"Final answer for ζ_i = {zeta_1}, ζ_j = {zeta_2}: {result2}\")\n\n```\n<<<1.0>>>"
