    This function determines the correct correspondence facilitated by the Bethe-Salpeter equation.

    The Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) is a fundamental equation in many-body quantum theory.
    It relates the full two-particle scattering process to the fundamental interactions between the particles.

    Let T be the scattering amplitude and K be the interaction kernel.
    The BSE can be written schematically as:
    T = K + K * G_0 * T
    where G_0 represents the propagation of two non-interacting particles.

    This equation shows that the full scattering amplitude (T) can be calculated
    if the interaction kernel (K) is known. The kernel K is defined as the sum of all
    two-particle irreducible interaction diagrams.

    Therefore, the Bethe-Salpeter equation establishes a direct correspondence between:
    1. The Scattering Amplitude (the full result of the two-particle interaction)
    2. The Interaction Kernel (the sum of fundamental, irreducible interactions)

    This matches option G.
