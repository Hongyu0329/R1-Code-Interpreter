# The problem states the initial height h is 350g meters.
# Let's define the coefficient for the height.
height_coefficient = 350

# From the laws of physics governing the falling raindrop that accumulates mass,
# the acceleration 'a' is found to be a constant fraction of gravity 'g'.
# a = g / 7
# The densities rho and Rho cancel out during the derivation.
acceleration_denominator = 7

# The time 't' for an object to fall a distance 'h' from rest with constant acceleration 'a'
# is given by the kinematic equation: t = sqrt(2 * h / a).
#
# Substitute h = 350*g and a = g/7:
# t = sqrt(2 * (350 * g) / (g / 7))
#
# The variable 'g' cancels from the numerator and denominator, leaving:
# t = sqrt(2 * 350 * 7)

# We can now calculate the final numerical answer.

term2 = height_coefficient
