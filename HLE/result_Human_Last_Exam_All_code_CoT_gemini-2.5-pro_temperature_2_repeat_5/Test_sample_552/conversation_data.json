    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\n1.  First, I need to identify the specific 1905 paper you are referring to. This is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat).\n2.  Next, I will investigate the citations and intellectual foundations of that paper. Einstein's papers from this period are known for having very few citations. His work on Brownian motion was derived from the principles of the kinetic theory of heat and statistical mechanics.\n3.  The foremost figure in this field, whose work was available to Einstein (including through published lecture notes like \"Lectures on Gas Theory\"), was Ludwig Boltzmann. While Einstein may not have explicitly cited \"the lectures of...\" in a footnote as is modern practice, his theoretical framework is built directly upon Boltzmann's foundational work in statistical mechanics.\n4.  I will write a Python script to print the name of this influential physicist.\n\n```python\ndef find_influential_lecturer():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the physicist whose lectures and work were a key foundation for\n    Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The paper built upon the principles of statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of heat.\n    # The primary pioneer in this field, whose published work included lecture notes,\n    # was Ludwig Boltzmann. Einstein developed his theory based on Boltzmann's framework.\n    physicist_name = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n\n    print(\"In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, Albert Einstein's work was fundamentally based on the principles developed by:\")\n    print(physicist_name)\n\nfind_influential_lecturer()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
