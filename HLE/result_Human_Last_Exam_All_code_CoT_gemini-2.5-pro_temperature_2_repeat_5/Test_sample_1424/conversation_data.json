    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, and more generally in many-body quantum mechanics, the bare Green's function ($G_0$) describes the propagation of a particle in a non-interacting system. The dependence of this function on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$) is fundamental.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Theoretical Explanation:** I will first explain the physical meaning of the Green's function and its relation to the system's Hamiltonian. For a non-interacting system, the Hamiltonian is diagonal in the basis of single-particle energy eigenstates.\n2.  **Derive the Form:** I will show how this leads to the conclusion that the Green's function in frequency-momentum space, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, must have a simple pole at the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$. The functional form is an inverse relationship.\n3.  **Python Code:** I will write a Python script to demonstrate this relationship. The script will take example values for the frequency ($\\omega$) and a specific single-particle energy eigenvalue ($\\epsilon_k$) and then print the complete mathematical expression for the Green's function. This fulfills the request to show the numbers within the final equation, clearly illustrating the functional dependence.\n\nThe bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of the time-ordered propagator. In a non-interacting system, the equation of motion for the Green's function leads to the following algebraic form in frequency ($\\omega$) and momentum/state index ($k$) space:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\nHere:\n*   $\\epsilon_k$ is the energy of the single-particle eigenstate labeled by $k$.\n*   $\\omega$ is the frequency of the propagating particle.\n*   $i\\eta$ is an infinitesimally small imaginary number added to the denominator. It's a mathematical tool to handle the pole at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$ and ensure the correct causal boundary conditions are met. Its sign can change depending on whether the state is above or below the Fermi level.\n\nThe crucial point is that the Green's function is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe following Python code defines a function to represent this relationship and prints the formula with example values.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef print_bare_greens_function_expression(omega, epsilon_k, particle_type='particle'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the expression for the Feynman bare Green's function G_0(k, omega).\n\n    Args:\n        omega (float or int): The frequency of the particle.\n        epsilon_k (float or int): The single-particle energy eigenvalue for state k.\n        particle_type (str): Either 'particle' (for states above the Fermi level)\n                             or 'hole' (for states below the Fermi level).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use sympy for nice symbolic printing of eta\n    eta = sympy.Symbol('η')\n    i = sympy.I\n\n    # The sign of the i*eta term depends on whether we are looking at a particle or a hole\n    if particle_type == 'particle':\n        sign = 1\n        sign_str = '+'\n    elif particle_type == 'hole':\n        sign = -1\n        sign_str = '-'\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"particle_type must be 'particle' or 'hole'\")\n\n    # Construct the symbolic expression for the denominator\n    denominator = omega - epsilon_k + sign * i * eta\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation\n    print(\"The functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy ε_k is given by:\")\n    print(f\"\\nG_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ε_k {sign_str} iη)\\n\")\n    print(\"This shows G_0 has a simple pole at the energy eigenvalue ε_k.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Example Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"For a frequency ω = {omega} and a single-particle energy ε_k = {epsilon_k}:\")\n    print(\"\\nThe equation is:\")\n    \n    # Use sympy.pretty_print for a better looking formula\n    # But to follow the prompt's instruction to output each number, an f-string is better.\n    # We will build the string manually to show the substitution.\n    \n    final_equation = f\"G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {epsilon_k} {sign_str} iη)\"\n    print(final_equation)\n    \n    # Also show the result after subtracting the real numbers\n    real_part_denom = omega - epsilon_k\n    final_equation_simplified = f\"G_0 = 1 / ({real_part_denom} {sign_str} iη)\"\n    print(\"\\nWhich simplifies to:\")\n    print(final_equation_simplified)\n\n\n# --- User-defined parameters ---\n# Let's consider a particle (e.g., an electron added to a system)\nexample_omega = 5.0  # Example frequency in some energy units\nexample_epsilon_k = 3.5  # Example single-particle energy in the same units\n\n# Run the function to print the result\nprint_bare_greens_function_expression(example_omega, example_epsilon_k, particle_type='particle')\n```\n\n<<<$1 / (\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta)$>>>"
