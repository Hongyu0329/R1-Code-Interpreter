    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the Key Information:** I will extract the weights of the ambient projective space, which are `w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`, and the polynomial for the Calabi-Yau threefold.\n2.  **Determine the Degree:** The degree `d` of the Calabi-Yau hypersurface is required for the Calabi-Yau condition, where the degree equals the sum of the weights. I will verify this condition.\n3.  **Recall the Formula:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant `cn(X)` for a Calabi-Yau threefold `X` that is a quasi-smooth hypersurface in a weighted projective space is given by the formula:\n    `cn(X) = (1/12) * ∫_X c_2(T_X) ∪ L`\n    where `c_2(T_X)` is the second Chern class of the tangent bundle of X and `L` is the ample line bundle generator, taken as the hyperplane class `H`.\n4.  **Formulate the Calculation:** For a hypersurface of degree `d` in the weighted projective space `P^4(w1, w2, w3, w4, w5)`, this integral can be calculated using the following components:\n    *   The degree `d` is the sum of the weights: `d = Σ w_i`.\n    *   The product of the weights is `Π = Π w_i`.\n    *   The second elementary symmetric polynomial of the weights is `σ_2 = Σ_{i<j} w_i * w_j`.\n    *   The integral `∫_X c_2(T_X) ∪ H` can be expressed as `σ_2 * (d / Π)`.\n5.  **Assemble the Final Equation:** Combining these parts, the final formula to be computed is:\n    `cn(X) = (1/12) * σ_2 * (d / Π)`\n6.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations. The script will first define the weights, then compute `d`, `Π`, and `σ_2`. Finally, it will compute the Crawley-Nordström invariant and print out each component of the calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordstrom invariant for a Calabi-Yau threefold\n    hypersurface in a weighted projective space.\n\n    The formula used is cn(X) = (1/12) * (sigma_2 * d / prod_w),\n    where:\n    - w are the weights of the ambient space\n    - d is the degree of the hypersurface (sum of weights)\n    - sigma_2 is the second elementary symmetric polynomial of the weights\n    - prod_w is the product of the weights\n    \"\"\"\n    # The weights of the ambient space P^4_(w1, w2, w3, w4, w5)\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n\n    # The degree 'd' for a Calabi-Yau is the sum of the weights\n    d = sum(weights)\n\n    # The product of the weights\n    prod_w = math.prod(weights)\n\n    # Calculate sigma_2 = sum_{i<j} w_i * w_j\n    # We use the identity: 2 * sigma_2 = (sum(w_i))^2 - sum(w_i^2)\n    sum_sq_w = sum(w**2 for w in weights)\n    sigma_2 = (d**2 - sum_sq_w) / 2\n    \n    # Although sigma_2 must be an integer, ensure it is for the calculation\n    sigma_2 = int(sigma_2)\n\n    # Calculate the value of the integral of c_2 .
