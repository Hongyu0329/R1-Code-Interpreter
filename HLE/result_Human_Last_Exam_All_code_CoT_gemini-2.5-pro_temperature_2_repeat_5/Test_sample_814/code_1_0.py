The patient's clinical presentation, including chronic widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive issues, and mood disorders, combined with negative lab results for inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, is classic for a diagnosis of Fibromyalgia. The treatment for fibromyalgia is aimed at managing this complex array of symptoms.

Let's evaluate the options:

1.  **Duloxetine**: An SNRI that is a first-line, FDA-approved treatment for fibromyalgia. It addresses pain, depression, and anxiety. This is an excellent choice.

2.  **Gabapentin**: An anticonvulsant that is highly effective for the neuropathic pain components, sleep disturbances, restless leg syndrome, and paraesthesia that this patient is experiencing.

3.  **Combination Therapy**: Given the severity and breadth of the patient's symptoms (pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep issues, restless leg syndrome, paraesthesia), combination therapy is often more effective than monotherapy.

4.  **Conclusion**: The combination of 'Duloxetine + Gabapentin' provides the most comprehensive treatment. Duloxetine targets the core pain and mood symptoms, while Gabapentin specifically addresses the neuropathic pain aspects, restless leg syndrome, and sleep problems. This two-pronged approach is the most robust strategy among the choices to manage the patient's full symptom cluster.
