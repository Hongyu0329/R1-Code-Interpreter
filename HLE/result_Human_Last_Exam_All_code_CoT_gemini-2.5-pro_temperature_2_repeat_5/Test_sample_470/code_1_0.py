# A python script to compute k(B) - l(B) based on block theory principles.

# Step 1: Compute l(B), the number of irreducible Brauer characters.
# For a block with an abelian defect group D and inertial quotient E,
# l(B) is the number of conjugacy classes of E, provided char(F) does not divide |E|.
# Here E has order 5 and char(F) is 2, so the condition holds.
# E is cyclic of order 5, so it is abelian and has 5 conjugacy classes.
l_B = 5

# Step 2: Compute k(B), the number of irreducible ordinary characters.
# For a block with an abelian defect group, k(B) is the number of conjugacy
# classes of the semidirect product D x E.
# We found this by summing the number of conjugacy classes of the stabilizers
# for each orbit of E acting on D.

# Number of orbits whose stabilizer is E (isomorphic to C5). There are 2 such orbits.
# k(C5) = 5.
num_orbits_with_stab_E = 2
k_C5 = 5
contrib_stab_E = num_orbits_with_stab_E * k_C5

# Number of orbits whose stabilizer is the trivial group {1}. There are 6 such orbits.
# k({1}) = 1.
num_orbits_with_stab_trivial = 6
k_trivial = 1
contrib_stab_trivial = num_orbits_with_stab_trivial * k_trivial

# Sum the contributions to get k(B).
k_B = contrib_stab_E + contrib_stab_trivial

# Step 3: Compute the final result k(B) - l(B).
result = k_B - l_B

# Print the final result, showing each number in the equation.
