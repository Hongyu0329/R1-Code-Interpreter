    "This is a fascinating question of alternate linguistic history. To figure this out, we need to trace the etymology of the native Anglo-Saxon word for \"sister\" and see how it would likely have evolved without the influence of the Old Norse word \"systir\".\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the original Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for \"sister\".\n2.  Compare it to the Old Norse word that gave us our modern \"sister\" to confirm the influence.\n3.  Analyze known sound changes that occurred between Old English and Modern English, using other native words as examples.\n4.  Apply these sound changes to the Old English word to project its most likely modern form. The Middle English form \"suster\" is a well-documented variant that directly descends from the Old English word and is key to this projection.\n5.  The Python code below will walk through this linguistic deduction and print the final resulting word.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    Deduces the modern English word for 'sister' without Norse influence\n    by tracing the etymology of the original Old English word.\n    \"\"\"\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    middle_english_form = \"suster\"\n    \n    print(\"This script determines the Modern English word for 'sister' had the Norse never introduced their term.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # Step 1: Explain the origin of the current word\n    print(\"1. Our current word, 'sister', comes from the Old Norse word 'systir'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the native word that would have been used instead\n    print(f\"2. Without that influence, the word would have evolved from the Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word: '{old_english_word}'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Show the evolution path\n    print(f\"3. Let's trace the hypothetical evolution of '{old_english_word}':\")\n    print(f\"   - From Old to Middle English, '{old_english_word}' commonly became '{middle_english_form}'.\")\n    print(\"     This is due to a known sound change where 'sw-' at the start of a word simplified to 's-' (e.g., Old English 'swa' became 'so').\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # Step 4: Project the Modern English result\n    print(f\"4. The Middle English form '{middle_english_form}' would then have evolved into a Modern English word.\")\n    print(\"     - The pronunciation would have changed during the Great Vowel Shift, similar to 'butter' or 'utter'.\")\n    print(\"     - The spelling would have likely been standardized to 'suster'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 5: State the final conclusion\n    final_word = middle_english_form\n    print(\"The final equation is essentially: \")\n    print(f\"{old_english_word} (Old English) -> {middle_english_form} (Middle English) -> {final_word} (Modern English)\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the likely Modern English word for 'sister' would be:\")\n    print(final_word)\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
