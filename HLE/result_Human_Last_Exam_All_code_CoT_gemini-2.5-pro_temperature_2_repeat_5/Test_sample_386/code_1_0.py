# The correct answer is C, which mentions a medium containing 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic.
# This script extracts these numerical values and presents them in an equation.

fbs_percentage = 10
antibiotic_percentage = 1

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# We will create an equation showing the total percentage of supplements added to the base medium.
total_supplement_percentage = fbs_percentage + antibiotic_percentage

print(f"Based on the correct procedure, the equation for supplement percentages is:")
print(f"{fbs_percentage} + {antibiotic_percentage} = {total_supplement_percentage}")
