    "For a multi-color flow cytometry experiment, the essential controls are primarily for setting baselines and for spectral compensation. Here is the breakdown and calculation:\n\n1.  **Unstained Control:** You need one sample of the streptavidin beads without any fluorescent labels. This is crucial for determining the autofluorescence of the beads and setting the negative gates.\n2.  **Single-Color Compensation Controls:** Since you are using five different fluorophores, there will be spectral overlap between the channels (e.g., signal from PE might spill into the GFP channel). To correct this, you must run a separate control for each fluorophore you are using. This means you need five single-color controls.\n\nThe total number of essential controls is the sum of the unstained control and the single-color controls.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a flow cytometry experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of channels/fluorophores in the experiment\n    num_channels = 5\n\n    # You always need one unstained control to measure autofluorescence.\n    unstained_control = 1\n\n    # You need one single-color compensation control for each channel.\n    compensation_controls = num_channels\n\n    # The total number of essential controls is the sum of the two types.\n    total_controls = unstained_control + compensation_controls\n\n    print(\"To determine the number of essential controls, we sum:\")\n    print(\"1. The unstained control (for baseline autofluorescence).\")\n    print(\"2. The single-color controls (one for each of the {} channels for compensation).\".format(num_channels))\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    print(f\"{unstained_control} + {compensation_controls} = {total_controls}\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, you should prepare a total of {} essential controls.\".format(total_controls))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_flow_controls()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
