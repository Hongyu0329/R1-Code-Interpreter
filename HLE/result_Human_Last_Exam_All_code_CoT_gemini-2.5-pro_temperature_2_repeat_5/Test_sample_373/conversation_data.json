    "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Graph Structure**: We first need to understand the structure of a barbell graph with 10 nodes. A standard, symmetric barbell graph is constructed by taking two identical complete graphs and connecting them with a single edge. With 10 total nodes, this means we have two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (`K_5`). The single edge connecting them is the \"bottleneck edge\".\n\n2.  **Understand Uniform Gossiping**: In randomized uniform gossiping, a single step involves:\n    a. Selecting a node `i` uniformly at random from all `N` nodes in the graph. The probability of picking any specific node is `1/N`.\n    b. Selecting one of the neighbors of `i`, say `j`, uniformly at random. The probability of picking a specific neighbor `j` is `1/degree(i)`, where `degree(i)` is the number of edges connected to node `i`.\n\n3.  **Identify Key Nodes and their Degrees**: The \"bottleneck edge\" connects two specific nodes, let's call them `u` and `v`. To calculate the probability, we need to find the degrees of these two nodes.\n    *   Node `u` is part of a `K_5`, so it's connected to the other 4 nodes in its clique.\n    *   It is also connected to node `v` via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Therefore, `degree(u) = 4 + 1 = 5`. By symmetry, `degree(v)` is also 5.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability**: The event \"sampling the bottleneck edge\" occurs if we either select the directed edge `(u, v)` or the directed edge `(v, u)`. These are mutually exclusive events, so we can add their probabilities.\n    *   The probability of selecting `(u, v)` is `P(u) * P(v|u) = (1/N) * (1/degree(u))`.\n    *   The probability of selecting `(v, u)` is `P(v) * P(u|v) = (1/N) * (1/degree(v))`.\n    *   The total probability is the sum: `P(bottleneck) = (1/(N * degree(u))) + (1/(N * degree(v)))`.\n\n5.  **Code the Calculation**: We will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the final equation with all the numerical values.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define graph parameters for a 10-node barbell graph.\n# 2. Calculate the degree of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n# 3. Use the formula for uniform gossiping probability to find the probability of\n#    traversing the bottleneck edge in either direction.\n# 4. Sum the probabilities and present the final equation and result.\n\n# 1.

Probability Calculation\n# The probability of traversing the directed edge (u, v) is P(u) * P(v|u).\n# P(u -> v) = (1/N) * (1/degree(u))\nprob_u_to_v = Fraction(1, total_nodes * degree_bridge_node)\n\n# By symmetry, the probability of traversing (v, u) is the same.\nprob_v_to_u = Fraction(1, total_nodes * degree_bridge_node)\n\n# The total probability is the sum, as the bottleneck edge can be\n# sampled by traversing it in either direction.\ntotal_prob = prob_u_to_v + prob_v_to_u\n\n# 4.
