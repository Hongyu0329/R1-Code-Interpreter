    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene (C7H8) molecule with a 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecule:** Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8. This means it contains 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Understand the 6-31G Basis Set:** This notation tells us how many functions are used for each atom.\n    *   **For each Carbon (C) atom**, a second-row element:\n        *   The core (1s) orbital is represented by 1 contracted function.\n        *   The valence orbitals (2s and 2p) are split. The 2s orbital is represented by 2 functions. The three 2p orbitals (px, py, pz) are each represented by 2 functions, for a total of `3 * 2 = 6` p-functions.\n        *   Total functions per Carbon atom = 1 (core) + 2 (s-valence) + 6 (p-valence) = 9 functions.\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom**, a first-row element:\n        *   There is no core. The valence (1s) orbital is split into 2 contracted functions.\n        *   Total functions per Hydrogen atom = 2 functions.\n3.  **Calculate the Total:** We multiply the count of each atom by its corresponding number of basis functions and sum the results.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_C = 7\nnum_H = 8\n\n# Number of contracted basis functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\nfunctions_per_C = 9  # 1 for core 1s, 2 for valence 2s, 6 for valence 2p (3*2)\nfunctions_per_H = 2  # 2 for valence 1s\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from each element\ntotal_C_functions = num_C * functions_per_C\ntotal_H_functions = num_H * functions_per_H\n\n# Calculate the total for the molecule\ntotal_functions = total_C_functions + total_H_functions\n\n# Print the explanation and the final equation\nprint(\"Calculation of contracted Gaussian functions for Toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"Number of Carbon atoms: {num_C}\")\nprint(f\"Number of Hydrogen atoms: {num_H}\")\nprint(f\"Basis functions per Carbon atom: {functions_per_C}\")\nprint(f\"Basis functions per Hydrogen atom: {functions_per_H}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"({num_C} C atoms * {functions_per_C} functions/C) + ({num_H} H atoms * {functions_per_H} functions/H) = {total_functions}\")\nprint(f\"This breaks down to: {total_C_functions} + {total_H_functions} = {total_functions}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
