    "This is a computational problem involving SKI combinator logic and Church numerals. The goal is to evaluate a complex expression that represents a Church numeral `n`, and then find `log_2(n)`.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define Combinators and Operations:** Identify the fundamental combinators (`S`, `K`, `I`) and composite structures within the expression.\n    *   `Ix` -> `x`\n    *   `Kxy` -> `x`\n    *   `Sxyz` -> `xz(yz)`\n    *   `M = S(I)`: The \"Mockingbird\" combinator, `Mx -> xx`.\n    *   `B = S(S(K(S))(K))`: This is a known form of the \"Composition\" or `B` combinator, `Bxyz -> x(yz)`. In the context of Church numerals, this acts as the **multiplication** operator. `MULT(m,n) -> m*n`.\n\n2.  **Define Church Numerals:** Recall the properties of Church numerals.\n    *   A numeral `n` is a function `C_n = λf.λx. f^n(x)`.\n    *   `C_0 = KI`\n    *   `C_1 = I`\n    *   Applying one numeral to another results in exponentiation: `C_m C_n` represents `n^m`.\n    *   Applying the `M` combinator to a numeral `C_n` results in tetration: `M C_n = C_n C_n`, which represents `n^n`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the Expression:** Break down the complex expression into manageable parts and substitute the operators defined above.\n\n    The expression is: `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\n    Let's substitute our definitions:\n    *   `M = S(I)`\n    *   `B = S(S(K(S))(K))`\n\n    The expression has the structure `M(X)`, where:\n    `X = M (Y) (Z)`\n    `Y = M (K (B I))`\n    `Z = B (M I)`\n\n4.  **Evaluate Sub-Expressions:** Reduce the parts `Y` and `Z` by evaluating their components, treating them as Church numerals.\n    *   `I` is the Church numeral `C_1`.\n    *   `M I = M C_1 = C_1 C_1`. In lambda calculus, this represents `1^1`, so `M I = C_1 = I`.\n    *   `B I = B C_1 = MULT C_1`. Multiplying by 1 is the identity function, so `B I = I = C_1`.\n    *   `Z = B(M I) = B(I) = C_1`. So, `Z` is the numeral `1`.\n    *   `K(B I) = K(I)`. This is the definition of Church numeral `0`. So `K(B I) = C_0`.\n    *   `Y = M(K(B I)) = M(C_0)`. `M C_0` represents `0^0`. In combinator logic, `M C_0 = (S I) (K I) = (K I) (K I)`. This reduces to `I`, which is `C_1`. So the logic itself defines `0^0 = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, `Y` is the numeral `1`.\n\n5.  **Re-assemble and Final Reduction:** Substitute the simplified values of `Y` and `Z` back into the main expression.\n    *   `X = M(Y)(Z) = M(C_1)(C_1)`\n    *   `M C_1 C_1 = (S I) C_1 C_1` which reduces to `(C_1 C_1) (C_1 C_1)`.\n    *   `C_1 C_1 = I I = I = C_1`.\n    *   So, `X = (C_1)(C_1) = C_1`.\n    *   The full expression is `E = M(X) = M(C_1)`.\n    *   `M(C_1)` reduces to `C_1 C_1 = I I = I = C_1`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The entire expression reduces to `I`, which is the Church numeral for `n=1`.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Calculate `log_2(n) = log_2(1)`.\n\nThe final step is to provide the code to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: After reducing the SKI combinator expression, we determined\n# that it is equivalent to the Church numeral for n=1.\n# The entire complex expression simplifies to the Identity combinator 'I',\n# which is the representation of Church numeral 1.\n# Full derivation:\n# E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(B I)))(B (S I I)))\n# Let M=S(I), B=S(S(K(S))(K))=MULT.\n# I=C_1 (Church 1), K I=C_0 (Church 0).\n# M I = C_1(C_1) = 1^1 = 1 = C_1.\n# B I = MULT(1) = Identity = I = C_1.\n# K(B I) = K(I) = C_0.\n# M(K(B I)) = M(C_0) = C_0(C_0) = 0^0 = 1 = C_1.\n# Let Y = M(K(B I)) = C_1.\n# Let Z = B(M I) = B(I) = C_1.\n# E = M( M(Y)(Z) ) = M( M(C_1)(C_1) )\n# M(C_1)(C_1) = (S I C_1) C_1 = (C_1 C_1) (C_1 C_1) = (I I) (I I) = I I = I = C_1.\n# E = M(C_1) = C_1 C_1 = I I = I = C_1.\nn = 1\n\n# Step 2: The problem asks for log_2(n).\n# We calculate the logarithm base 2 of the integer n.\nresult = math.log2(n)\n\n# Output the original values and the final result.\nprint(f\"The church integer is n = {n}\")\nprint(f\"The calculation is log_2({n})\")\nprint(f\"The final result is {result}\")\n```\n<<<0.0>>>"
