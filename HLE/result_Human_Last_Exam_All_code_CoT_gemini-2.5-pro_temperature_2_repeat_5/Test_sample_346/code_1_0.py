# Step 1: After reducing the SKI combinator expression, we determined
# that it is equivalent to the Church numeral for n=1.
# The entire complex expression simplifies to the Identity combinator 'I',
# which is the representation of Church numeral 1.
# Full derivation:
# E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(B I)))(B (S I I)))
# Let M=S(I), B=S(S(K(S))(K))=MULT.
# I=C_1 (Church 1), K I=C_0 (Church 0).
# M I = C_1(C_1) = 1^1 = 1 = C_1.
# B I = MULT(1) = Identity = I = C_1.
# K(B I) = K(I) = C_0.
# M(K(B I)) = M(C_0) = C_0(C_0) = 0^0 = 1 = C_1.
# Let Y = M(K(B I)) = C_1.
# Let Z = B(M I) = B(I) = C_1.
# E = M( M(Y)(Z) ) = M( M(C_1)(C_1) )
# M(C_1)(C_1) = (S I C_1) C_1 = (C_1 C_1) (C_1 C_1) = (I I) (I I) = I I = I = C_1.
# E = M(C_1) = C_1 C_1 = I I = I = C_1.
n = 1

# Step 2: The problem asks for log_2(n).
# We calculate the logarithm base 2 of the integer n.
result = math.log2(n)

# Output the original values and the final result.
print(f"The church integer is n = {n}")
print(f"The calculation is log_2({n})")
print(f"The final result is {result}")
