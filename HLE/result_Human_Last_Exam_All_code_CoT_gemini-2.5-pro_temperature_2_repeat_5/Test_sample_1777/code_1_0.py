# Step 1: Define the given parameters
E_gap = 3.0  # Band gap in eV
E_1s_peak = 1.0  # 1s exciton resonance peak in eV
n = 3        # Principal quantum number for the target state

# Step 2: Calculate the binding energy of the 1s exciton (Eb_1s)
Eb_1s = E_gap - E_1s_peak

# Step 3: For a 2D system, the binding energy is Eb_n = Ry_2D / (n - 1/2)^2.
# We find the effective 2D Rydberg energy (Ry_2D) from the 1s state.
# Eb_1s = Ry_2D / (1 - 0.5)^2 = Ry_2D / 0.25 => Ry_2D = 4 * Eb_1s
# Let's calculate Ry_2D. For clarity, let's reverse the formula:
# Ry_2D = Eb_1s * (1 - 0.5)^2 = Eb_1s / 4 in 3D analogue Ry=Eb1s/1, not the case here
# Re-deriving it: Eb_1s = Ry_2D / (1-0.5)^2 -> Ry_2D = Eb_1s * (1-0.5)^2 is wrong.
# Correct is: Ry_2D = Eb_1s / (1 / (1-0.5)^2) = Eb_1s * (1-0.5)^2 = Eb_1s * 0.25 -> this leads to a wrong conclusion.
# Let's do it right. Eb_1s = Ry_2D / (0.5)^2 = 4 * Ry_2D => Ry_2D = Eb_1s / 4
Ry_2D = Eb_1s / 4.0

# Step 4: Calculate the binding energy for the n=3 state (Eb_3)
denominator = (n - 0.5)**2
Eb_3 = Ry_2D / denominator

# Print the final results, showing the equation step by step.
