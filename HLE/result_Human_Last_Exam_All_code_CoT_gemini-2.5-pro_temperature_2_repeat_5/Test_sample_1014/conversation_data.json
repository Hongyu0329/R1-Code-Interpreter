    "To find the largest prime divisor of 8139881, I will implement a prime factorization algorithm in Python. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Start with the number `n = 8139881`. I'll create a list to store its prime factors.\n2.  **Divide by 2**: I will first handle the smallest prime, 2. I'll repeatedly divide the number by 2 and add 2 to our list of factors until it is no longer divisible by 2.\n3.  **Divide by Odd Numbers**: Since all remaining factors must be odd, I will then iterate through odd numbers (`d`), starting from 3. For each `d`, I will check if it divides the remaining number. If it does, I'll add `d` to the list of factors and divide the number by `d` repeatedly.\n4.  **Optimization**: This iteration only needs to go up to the square root of the remaining number. If we find a factor, the remaining number becomes smaller, and so does its square root, making the process efficient.\n5.  **Final Factor**: If, after all these divisions, the number left is greater than 1, this remaining number is itself a prime factor. It will be added to our list.\n6.  **Find the Largest**: Once the list of all prime factors is complete, the largest prime divisor is simply the maximum value in that list.\n7.  **Output**: I will print the prime factorization of 8139881 as an equation, and then state the largest prime factor found.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest prime divisor of a given number and prints the prime factorization.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 8139881\n    \n    # A list to store the prime factors\n    factors = []\n    \n    # Make a copy of the number to modify it during factorization\n    num_to_factor = n\n    \n    # Step 1: Handle division by 2\n    while num_to_factor % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        num_to_factor //= 2\n    \n    # Step 2: Handle division by odd numbers starting from 3\n    # We only need to check up to the square root of the number\n    d = 3\n    while d * d <= num_to_factor:\n        # While d divides num_to_factor, add d to factors and update num_to_factor\n        while num_to_factor % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            num_to_factor //= d\n        d += 2\n        \n    # Step 3: Handle the case where the remaining number is a prime number greater than 2\n    if num_to_factor > 1:\n        factors.append(int(num_to_factor))\n        \n    # Step 4: Determine the largest prime factor and print the results\n    if not factors:\n        # This case is not reached for n > 1\n        print(f\"{n} has no prime factors.\")\n        largest_prime = 0\n    elif len(factors) == 1:\n        # This means the original number n is prime\n        largest_prime = n\n        print(f\"{n} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        # This means n is a composite number\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n        # Create and print the equation string as requested\n        equation = f\"{n} = {' * '.join(map(str, factors))}\"\n        print(equation)\n\n    print(f\"The largest prime divisor of {n} is: {largest_prime}\")\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_largest_prime_divisor()\n```\n<<<44971>>>"
