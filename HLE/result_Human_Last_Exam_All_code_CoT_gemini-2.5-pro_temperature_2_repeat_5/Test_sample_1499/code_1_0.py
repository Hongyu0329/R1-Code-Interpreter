# The task is to determine the correct Old Church Slavonic verb form for the 3rd person plural imperative.
# The verb being conjugated is "бꙑти" (to be).

# In Old Church Slavonic grammar, the 3rd person imperative (a command or suggestion for "they")
# is typically expressed using the 3rd person plural of the future tense.
# The list provides the 3rd person singular future tense: бѫдєть (he/she/it will be).
# The corresponding 3rd person plural future tense form is бѫдѫтъ (they will be).
# This form is also used to mean "let them be" or "they should be".

# Note: The prompt has a typo "singular plural", which should be "plural".
grammatical_description = "(3rd person plural, imperative, command or suggestion)"
verb_form = "бѫдѫтъ"

# The final line of the pattern is constructed by combining the description and the verb form.
