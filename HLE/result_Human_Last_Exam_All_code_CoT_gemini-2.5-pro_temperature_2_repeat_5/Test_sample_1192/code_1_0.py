    # Analysis
    # The key risk after heart valve surgery is thromboembolism (blood clot formation).
    # The artificial valve surface can trigger clotting, leading to potentially fatal
    # complications like a stroke or pulmonary embolism.
    # While the patient is currently stable and asymptomatic, preventative (prophylactic)
    # treatment is essential to mitigate this major risk.

    # Options Evaluation
