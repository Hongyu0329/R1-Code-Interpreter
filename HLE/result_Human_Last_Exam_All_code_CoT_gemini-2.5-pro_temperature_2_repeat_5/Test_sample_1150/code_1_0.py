Step 1: Deconstruction of the Lojban word '{word}'.
The word '{word}' is a compound word (lujvo) made from the following roots:
- 'rusy-' from '{components["rusy-"]["gismu"]}', meaning '{components["rusy-"]["meaning"]}'.
- '-bavla-' from '{components["-bavla-"]["gismu"]}', meaning '{components["-bavla-"]["meaning"]}'.
- '-mdei' from '{components["-mdei"]["gismu"]}', meaning '{components["-mdei"]["meaning"]}'.

Step 2: Identifying the core meaning.
In Lojban compounds, the last part is the head, defining the main concept. Here, '{head_word}' (day) is the head.
The word means 'x1 is a gray, future, day-long event'.

Step 3: Determining the arguments (place structure).
A common convention for lujvo is that they inherit the place structure of their head word. The place structure of '{head_word}' is:
- x1: {head_place_structure['x1']}
- x2: {head_place_structure['x2']}
- x3: {head_place_structure['x3']}

Step 4: Interpreting the arguments for '{word}'.
Based on this, the arguments (x2 and x3) for '{word}' are:
- x2: {head_place_structure['x2']}
- x3: {head_place_structure['x3']}

Step 5: Matching with the provided answer choice.
This interpretation matches choice E.
Answer Choice E: x2 is the number of full days corresponding to x1; x3 is the 'day standard'.
