    "To determine how many ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules are released when a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose is metabolized, we must trace the labeled carbons through the relevant metabolic pathways.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Labeled Molecule:** Start with a 6-carbon glucose molecule where carbons at position 1 and 4 are ¹³C isotopes.\n2.  **Glycolysis:** Glycolysis splits the 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. We will track how the original glucose carbons map onto the carbons of these two pyruvates. Note that glycolysis itself does not produce CO₂.\n3.  **Pyruvate Decarboxylation:** This is the first step where CO₂ is released. The carboxyl group of pyruvate is removed. We will check if the carboxyl carbon on either pyruvate molecule is labeled.\n4.  **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle):** The remaining 2-carbon acetyl-CoA units enter the Krebs cycle, where they are fully oxidized to two more CO₂ molecules. We will track the labeled carbons that enter the cycle and determine when they are released as CO₂.\n5.  **Summation:** The total number of labeled CO₂ molecules will be the sum of those released during pyruvate decarboxylation and the Krebs cycle.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan, tracing the labeled carbons step-by-step to find the final count.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_glycolysis_co2():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces 13C labels from 1,4-13C glucose through glycolysis and subsequent\n    oxidative steps to determine how many labeled CO2 molecules are produced.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the labeled glucose molecule.\n    # '13C' indicates a labeled carbon, '12C' is unlabeled.\n    glucose = {\n        1: '13C',\n        2: '12C',\n        3: '12C',\n        4: '13C',\n        5: '12C',\n        6: '12C'\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Carbon Tracing for 1,4-13C Glucose ---\")\n    print(f\"Initial glucose labeling: Carbon C1 is {glucose[1]}, Carbon C4 is {glucose[4]}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Trace carbons through Glycolysis to Pyruvate.\n    # The 6-carbon glucose is split into two 3-carbon pyruvates.\n    # The mapping from glucose carbons to pyruvate carbons is as follows:\n    # - Glucose C1 & C6 become the methyl carbon (C3) of pyruvate.\n    # - Glucose C2 & C5 become the carbonyl carbon (C2) of pyruvate.\n    # - Glucose C3 & C4 become the carboxyl carbon (C1) of pyruvate.\n\n    # Pyruvate 'A' is formed from glucose carbons C1, C2, and C3.\n    pyruvate_A = {\n        'carboxyl_C1': glucose[3],  # from glucose C3\n        'carbonyl_C2': glucose[2],  # from glucose C2\n        'methyl_C3':   glucose[1]   # from glucose C1\n    }\n\n    # Pyruvate 'B' is formed from glucose carbons C4, C5, and C6.\n    pyruvate_B = {\n        'carboxyl_C1': glucose[4],  # from glucose C4\n        'carbonyl_C2': glucose[5],  # from glucose C5\n        'methyl_C3':   glucose[6]   # from glucose C6\n    }\n    \n    print(\"Glycolysis produces two pyruvate molecules.
