    1.  The question describes a situation where recombination is limited. This is problematic because it allows harmful mutations to accumulate over time, a process known as Muller's ratchet. We are looking for a feature that counteracts this effect.

    2.  Evaluating the options:
        *   A (Tandem repeats), B (Chromosomal inversions), and C (Transposable elements) do not provide a direct compensatory mechanism. Inversions, in fact, suppress recombination further.
        *   E (Polyploidy), or whole-genome duplication, does provide redundancy but is a massive event.
        *   D (Multigene families) arise from gene duplication. This provides functional redundancy where if one copy of a gene is inactivated by a mutation, other copies can still perform the necessary function. This directly buffers the genome against the accumulation of harmful mutations. It is a more targeted and common mechanism than polyploidy for this purpose.

    3.  Conclusion: The expansion of multigene families provides the functional backups needed to prevent genetic deterioration when recombination is limited.
