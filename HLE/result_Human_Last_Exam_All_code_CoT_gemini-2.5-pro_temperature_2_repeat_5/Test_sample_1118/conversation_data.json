    "This is an art history question. My plan is to first research the specific self-portrait by Curt Querner from 1933 to identify the object he is holding. Then, I will confirm its symbolic meaning in the context of his escape from the Gestapo. Finally, I will present this factual answer in a Python script as requested, by having the script print the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol_of_resistance():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the question about Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.\n    The painting, titled \"Self-Portrait with Pipe\" (Selbstbildnis mit Pfeife), was created\n    after Querner was temporarily imprisoned by the Gestapo.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The year the self-portrait was painted.\n    year = 1933\n    \n    # The object Querner holds in his hand.\n    object_held = \"a pipe\"\n    \n    # The symbolic meaning of the object in this context.\n    meaning = \"a symbol of resistance and personal defiance\"\n    \n    print(f\"In the year {year}, Curt Querner painted a self-portrait after his experience with the Gestapo.\")\n    print(f\"In this painting, he holds {object_held} as {meaning}.\")\n\nfind_symbol_of_resistance()\n```\n<<<a pipe>>>"
