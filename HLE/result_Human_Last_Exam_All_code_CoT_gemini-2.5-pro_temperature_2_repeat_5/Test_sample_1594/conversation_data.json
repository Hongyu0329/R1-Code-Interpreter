    "Of course, I can help with that. It's an interesting question that can be solved by programmatically fetching and visualizing geographical data.\n\nMy plan is to use a Python script to find the two highschools, \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti\" and \"Istituto Ulisse Dini\", in Pisa, Italy. I will use the `osmnx` library, which can interface with OpenStreetMap, a global map with open data. The script will download the building footprint data (the shapes of the buildings) for both schools. To make the final shape easy to see without a graphical plot, the script will then convert these geographical shapes into a simple text-based ASCII art and print it to the console. By looking at the printed output, we can determine the letter formed by the combined shape of the buildings.\n\nPlease make sure you have the necessary libraries installed by running `pip install osmnx shapely numpy`.\n\n```python\nimport osmnx as ox\nimport numpy as np\nfrom shapely.geometry import Point\n\ndef solve_building_shape():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function fetches the building footprints for two schools in Pisa,\n    and prints an ASCII representation of their combined shape.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Names of the schools\n    school_names = [\n        \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti, Pisa, Italy\",\n        \"Liceo Scientifico Ulisse Dini, Pisa, Italy\"\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Fetching building data for the schools from OpenStreetMap...\")\n\n    # Define the tag to look for buildings\n    tags = {\"building\": True}\n\n    try:\n        # Get the building footprints for both schools\n        # The buffer_dist expands the search area around the geocoded point\n        gdf_pacinotti = ox.geometries_from_address(school_names[0], tags, buffer_dist=150)\n        gdf_dini = ox.geometries_from_address(school_names[1], tags, buffer_dist=150)\n\n        # Combine the data for both schools\n        all_buildings = gdf_pacinotti._append(gdf_dini, ignore_index=True)\n        \n        # Merge all building shapes into one for easier processing\n        combined_shape = all_buildings.unary_union\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Could not fetch the map data.
