    "This is a classic E2 elimination problem where stereochemistry dictates the outcome. Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants**:\n    *   **Substrate**: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The (1S,2R) configuration indicates that the bromine and methyl groups are *trans* to each other. In a cyclohexane chair, this means one can be \"up\" while the other is \"down\".\n    *   **Reagent**: Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n    *   **Solvent**: Tert-butyl alcohol is the conjugate acid of the base.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type**:\n    *   The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction.\n\n3.  **Apply E2 Stereochemical Requirement**:\n    *   The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Bromine) and the proton being removed (a β-hydrogen) must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation. In a cyclohexane ring, this means they must both be in **axial** positions and on adjacent carbons (*trans-diaxial*).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**:\n    *   The *trans*-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations.\n    *   **Conformer A (more stable)**: Both the bromine (Br) and the methyl (CH₃) group are in the more spacious **equatorial** positions. In this conformation, the equatorial Br is not anti-periplanar to any axial β-hydrogens on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6). Therefore, **this conformer cannot undergo the E2 reaction**.\n    *   **Conformer B (less stable)**: After a ring-flip, both the Br and CH₃ groups are in the more sterically hindered **axial** positions. Although this conformer is present in a very small amount at equilibrium, it is the only one that can react.\n\n5.  **Identify Possible Elimination Pathways from the Reactive Conformer (Conformer B)**:\n    *   In this reactive diaxial conformer, the **bromine is axial**. We now look for axial hydrogens on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **At C2**: The methyl group is axial. This means the hydrogen on C2 is **equatorial**. Since this H is not axial, it cannot be eliminated. The formation of 3-methylcyclohexene (the Hofmann product) is stereochemically forbidden.\n    *   **At C6**: This carbon has an **axial** hydrogen. This axial H is perfectly anti-periplanar to the axial Br on C1.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only remove the axial hydrogen from C6.\n\n6.  **Identify the Final Product**:\n    *   Elimination of the H from C6 and the Br from C1 forms a double bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   This results in the formation of **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the Zaitsev product.\n    *   Crucially, even though bulky bases like t-BuOK usually favor the less substituted Hofmann product, the stereochemical constraints of this specific substrate force the reaction to yield only the Zaitsev product.\n\nThe following Python code simulates this logical deduction.\n\n```python\ndef identify_elimination_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the E2 elimination of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n    and identifies the resulting product.\n    \"\"\"\n    substrate = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    base = \"Potassium tert-butoxide\"\n\n    print(f\"Reaction: {substrate} treated with {base}.\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the reaction type.\")\n    print(\"A secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base favors an E2 elimination reaction.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Analyze the substrate's stereochemistry for the E2 mechanism.\")\n    print(\"The E2 mechanism requires an anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial) arrangement of the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen (H).\")\n\n    # The (1S,2R) isomer is trans.
