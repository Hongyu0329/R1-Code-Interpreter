The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in imaginary time using the Feynman path integral is:

1. Main Formula:
   {main_equation}

Where:
  - Z: The partition function.
  - {integral_symbol} D{psi_star_symbol}D{psi_symbol}: The functional path integral over all possible paths of the anticommuting Grassmann fields {psi_symbol} and {psi_star_symbol}.
  - S[{psi_star_symbol}, {psi_symbol}]: The Euclidean action of the system.

2. Euclidean Action (S):
   The action S for a system described by a single-particle Hamiltonian H\u2080 is given by:
   {action_equation}

Where:
  - {beta_symbol}: The inverse temperature, 1/(k_B T).
  - {tau_symbol}: Imaginary time, which is integrated from 0 to {beta_symbol}.
  - H\u2080: The single-particle Hamiltonian operator (e.g., kinetic plus potential energy).
  - {partial_derivative}{tau_symbol}: The partial derivative with respect to imaginary time, often written as {partial_derivative}/{partial_derivative}{tau_symbol}.

3. Boundary Condition:
   The path integral must be performed over fields that satisfy the fermionic anti-periodic boundary condition:
   {boundary_condition}

This condition is a direct consequence of the anticommutation relations of fermionic operators.
