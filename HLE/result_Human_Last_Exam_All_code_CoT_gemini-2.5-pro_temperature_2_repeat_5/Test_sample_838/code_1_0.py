    # Step 1: Elimination
    print("Reaction 1: Formation of Product A")
    print("Starting Material: [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene, also known as (3S)-3-bromo-1-phenylbutane.")
    print("Reagent: Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered base.")
    print("Reaction Type: E2 elimination.")
    print("Explanation: The bulky t-BuOK base preferentially abstracts a proton from the most sterically accessible position, which is the terminal methyl group (C4). This is known as Hofmann elimination and it forms the least substituted alkene.")
    print("Product A is 4-phenylbut-1-ene (Ph-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2). The original stereocenter at carbon 3 is destroyed in this step.\n")

    # Step 2: Hydroboration-Oxidation
    print("Reaction 2: Formation of Product B")
    print("Reactant A: 4-phenylbut-1-ene.")
    print("Reagents: 1. Borane in THF (BH3/THF), 2. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).")
    print("Reaction Type: Hydroboration-Oxidation.")
    print("Explanation: This reaction adds a hydroxyl group (-OH) across the double bond with anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity. This means the -OH group adds to the terminal (less substituted) carbon of the alkene.")
    print("Product B is 4-phenylbutan-1-ol (Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH).\n")

    # Step 3: Bromination
    print("Reaction 3: Formation of Product C")
    print("Reactant B: 4-phenylbutan-1-ol.")
    print("Reagent: Phosphorous tribromide (PBr3).")
    print("Reaction Type: Substitution (conversion of alcohol to alkyl bromide).")
    print("Explanation: PBr3 is a standard reagent used to convert primary alcohols into primary alkyl bromides. It replaces the hydroxyl (-OH) group with a bromine (-Br) atom.")
    print("Product C is (4-bromobutyl)benzene.\n")

    # Final Answer

    print("Identity of Final Product (C):")
    print("IUPAC Name: The final product C is (4-bromobutyl)benzene.")
    print("An alternative IUPAC name is 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane.")
    print("Chirality Explanation: The final product C is achiral. The initial stereocenter of the starting material was eliminated in the first reaction. No new stereocenters are formed in subsequent steps. The molecule does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups, which is the requirement for a chiral center.")
