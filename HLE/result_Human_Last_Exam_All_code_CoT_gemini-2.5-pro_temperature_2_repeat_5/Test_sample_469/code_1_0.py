# Convert path lengths to the same unit (cm) for comparison
path_length_thin_cm = path_length_thin_mm / 10.0

# Step 1: Determine the fundamental color of the solution using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.
# The equation is: pH = pKa + log10([Base Form]/[Acid Form])
# For Bromophenol blue, the Acid Form is yellow and the Base Form is blue.
# A mix of yellow and blue appears green.

# We can calculate the ratio of the blue form to the yellow form:
# [Blue]/[Yellow] = 10^(pH - pKa)
ratio_blue_to_yellow = 10**(ph - pka_bromophenol_blue)

print("Since a significant amount of both yellow and blue forms are present, the solution's fundamental color is green.")

# Step 2: Analyze the effect of path length using the Beer-Lambert Law.
# The Beer-Lambert Law (A = Îµbc) shows absorbance is proportional to path length (b).
# Greater absorbance results in a darker, more intense color.
