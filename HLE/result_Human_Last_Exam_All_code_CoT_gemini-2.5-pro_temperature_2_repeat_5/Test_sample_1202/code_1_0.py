    This function models the process of identifying the most likely mechanism
    for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes from a given list.

    It assigns scores based on biological principles:
    - retention_score: How well the mechanism explains the preservation of both gene copies.
    - divergence_score: How well the mechanism explains the functional divergence of the copies.

    A weighted score is calculated as: total = (2 * retention_score) + divergence_score.
    Retention is weighted more heavily because a gene must be retained before it can diverge.
