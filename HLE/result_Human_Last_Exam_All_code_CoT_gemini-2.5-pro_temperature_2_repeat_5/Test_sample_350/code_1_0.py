# The user is asking to identify the two key philosophical or theological figures
# Wolfhart Pannenberg draws upon for his concept of cosmic history built on a contingent concept of time.
#
# 1. Georg Hegel: Pannenberg's theology of "Revelation as History" is a direct engagement with and modification of
#    Hegel's philosophy of history, where history is seen as a comprehensive process of self-disclosure.
#    Pannenberg extends this from human history to "cosmic history".
#
# 2. Friedrich Schelling: Pannenberg's focus on contingency, freedom, and his dialogue with natural science
#    in his later work draws significantly from Schelling's later philosophy, which emphasized the contingent
#    and dynamic nature of reality and God.
#
# Based on this analysis, the correct pair is George Hegel and Friedrich Schelling.
# This corresponds to answer choice E.

correct_choice = "E"
