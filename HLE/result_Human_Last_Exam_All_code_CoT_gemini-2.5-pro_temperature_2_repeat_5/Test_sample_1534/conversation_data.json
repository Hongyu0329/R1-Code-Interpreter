    "This is a knowledge-based question about cephalopod neuroanatomy. To answer this, I will create a Python script that codifies this anatomical knowledge into a data structure. The script will then query this data structure to identify and print the brain regions located adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe.\n\nPlan:\n1.  Create a Python dictionary to serve as a simplified knowledge base of the dwarf cuttlefish's brain anatomy. This dictionary will map brain lobes to their adjacent structures.\n2.  Define the target lobe, which is the 'palliovisceral lobe'.\n3.  Look up the target lobe in the dictionary to find the regions listed as 'posterior'. The palliovisceral lobe is a part of the posterior subesophageal mass and is one of the most posterior lobes itself. Its main functional and spatial neighbors are the posterior chromatophore lobes (which it controls) and the giant fiber lobe (for jet propulsion).\n4.  Print the names of these adjacent posterior lobes in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the brain regions adjacent posteriorly to a specified lobe\n    in the dwarf cuttlefish, based on a simplified anatomical model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A simplified model of cuttlefish neuroanatomy.
