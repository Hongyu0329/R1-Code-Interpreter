It provides a holistic framework to address both the physical (dependence, pain) and psychological (anxiety, cravings) aspects of the patient's condition. This is a critical component of any sound plan.",
        "Step 3: Assess Option V. The patient specifically inquired about buprenorphine-naloxone. This medication is a first-line treatment for opioid use disorder and is increasingly used for complex pain and opioid tapering. It is safer than full agonists and effectively manages withdrawal and cravings. This directly and appropriately addresses the patient's request.",
        "Step 4: Reject other options. A rapid taper (Option III) is dangerous. Simply continuing the current failing strategy (Option I) is inadequate. While methadone (Option II) is a valid alternative, the combination of a team consultation (IV) to manage the process and considering the specific drug the patient asked about (V) forms the most patient-centered and effective initial plan.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize the best choice. The combination of a multidisciplinary consultation (IV) and the use of buprenorphine-naloxone (V) represents the most comprehensive, safe, and effective strategy."
