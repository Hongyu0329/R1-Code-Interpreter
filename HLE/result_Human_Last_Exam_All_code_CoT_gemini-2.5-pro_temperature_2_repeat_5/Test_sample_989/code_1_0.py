    print("Analysis of statements regarding Support Vector Machines:\n")

    # Statement A Analysis
    print("--- Statement A: Mathematically, you cannot have a valid SVM solution using support vectors from only one class. ---")
    print("This statement is TRUE.")
    print("The reason lies in the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the SVM optimization problem.")
    print("One of these conditions is that the sum of the products of the Lagrange multipliers (alpha_i) and class labels (y_i) for all support vectors must be zero: Î£(alpha_i * y_i) = 0.")
    print("Since alpha_i > 0 for support vectors and y_i is either +1 or -1, this sum can only be zero if there are support vectors from both classes (positive and negative y_i values) to cancel each other out.\n")

    # Statement B Analysis
    print("--- Statement B: With imbalanced or asymmetric data, having unequal margins can be optimal for SVM. ---")
    print("This statement is TRUE.")
    print("Standard SVM seeks a maximal margin symmetric between the classes. For imbalanced data, this can lead to poor classification of the minority class.")
    print("By introducing different penalty parameters (C) for each class (a technique called class weighting), the SVM can be encouraged to create a larger margin for the minority class, effectively creating an 'unequal' or 'asymmetric' margin to improve performance.\n")

    # Statement C Analysis
    print("--- Statement C: Effective mapping to an infinite-dimensional space is computationally tractable for some kernels. ---")
    print("This statement is TRUE.")
    print("This is the core idea of the 'kernel trick'. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, K(x, z) = exp(-gamma * ||x-z||^2), implicitly maps data into an infinite-dimensional feature space.")
    print("However, we never compute the mapping itself. We only need to compute the kernel function value, which is computationally easy, allowing us to operate in this high-dimensional space tractably.\n")

    # Statement D Analysis
    print("--- Statement D: It is possible to add or move data points and not affect the decision boundary at all, as long as they're interior points. ---")
    print("This statement is TRUE.")
    print("The SVM decision boundary is defined *only* by the support vectors (points on or inside the margin).")
    print("Points that are correctly classified and lie outside the margin ('interior points') have a corresponding Lagrange multiplier of zero. Therefore, they do not contribute to the definition of the boundary. You can move them or add more such points without any effect, as long as they don't cross the margin.\n")
    
    # Statement E Analysis
    print("--- Statement E: Any strictly convex function has a unique global minimizer. ---")
    print("This statement is FALSE.")
    print("A strictly convex function is guaranteed to have at most one minimizer. If a minimizer exists, it is unique and global.")
    print("However, the function is NOT guaranteed to have a minimizer in the first place. A simple counterexample is f(x) = e^x defined on the set of all real numbers.")
    print("Its second derivative is f''(x) = e^x, which is always positive, so the function is strictly convex.")
    print("But, the function approaches 0 as x approaches negative infinity and never actually reaches a minimum value. It has an infimum of 0, but no minimum.")
    print("Therefore, the claim that any strictly convex function *has* a minimizer is false.\n")

    print("====================================================================================================")
    print("CONCLUSION: Statement E is the one that is not true.")
