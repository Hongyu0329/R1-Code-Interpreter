    Analyzes the chess position to find the best move for White.

    FEN: 8/P7/1np1p3/5k2/6p1/1P1NK3/8/8 w - - 0 1

    The best move for White is Nc5. Here is the reasoning:

    1. The core of the position is White's a7-pawn, which is about to promote. Black's key defensive piece is the knight on b6, which is the sole piece controlling the a8 promotion square.

    2. The most obvious move, 1. a8=Q, is a mistake. After 1... Nxa8, White's winning pawn is gone. While White can then attack the black knight with 2. Nc5, Black responds with 2... Nc4+, giving Black enough counterplay with their active knight and g-pawn to force a draw.

    3. The correct strategy is to first eliminate the defender of the promotion square. The move 1. Nc5! does this perfectly. It directly attacks the knight on b6.

    4. After 1. Nc5!, Black is forced into a losing position:
        - If the knight moves with a check (1... Nc4+), White improves the king position with 2. Kd4. The promotion threat on a8 is now unstoppable, leading to a win.
        - If the knight moves to any other square like d7 (1... Nd7), White simply promotes with 2. a8=Q and wins.

    Therefore, attacking the defending knight before promoting is the correct, winning sequence for White.
