    "This is a problem in finite group theory. I will solve it by applying known classification theorems for the types of groups in question.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will state the criteria for a finite group to be \"filled\". A key theorem by Kedlaya provides a full classification, which simplifies greatly for groups of even order.\n2.  I will apply this criterion to groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime. This will lead to the conclusion that such a group `G` is filled if and only if it is a direct product `G = Q × Z₂`, where `Q` is a group of order `q^m`.\n3.  Next, I will incorporate the \"nonabelian\" condition. A group `G = Q × Z₂` is nonabelian if and only if `Q` is nonabelian.\n4.  I will determine for which values of `m` a group `Q` of order `q^m` can be nonabelian. Standard group theory tells us this requires `m ≥ 3`.\n5.  Finally, I will summarize the result and provide a concrete example for `m=3` to illustrate the specific group structures.\n\nI will encapsulate this entire reasoning and conclusion into a Python script that prints the detailed answer, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef find_nonabelian_filled_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the solution to the user's question about\n    nonabelian filled groups of a specific order.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Header explaining the problem statement.\n    print(\"Question: What are the nonabelian filled groups of order 2*q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m?\")\n    print(\"=\"*80)\n\n    # Main body of the answer.\n    answer_text = \"\"\"\n    A finite group G is 'filled' if every maximal product-free set in G fills G (i.e., S^2 = G).\n\n    Step 1: Characterizing Filled Groups of Order 2q^m\n\n    Based on a classification theorem by Kedlaya, a finite group G of even order is filled if and only if it contains a unique element of order 2 (a unique involution).\n\n    For a group G of order 2*q^m (with q being an odd prime), the order is even. Its Sylow 2-subgroup has order 2. Let this subgroup be P. G having a unique element of order 2 is equivalent to P being the unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which means P must be a normal subgroup of G.\n\n    When P is normal, G is a semidirect product that splits into a direct product:\n    G ≅ Q ⋊ P  and  P ◁ G  =>  G ≅ Q × P\n    \n    Here, Q is the Sylow q-subgroup of order q^m, and P is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, Z₂.\n    Thus, a group of order 2*q^m is filled if and only if it is of the form Q × Z₂, where Q is a group of order q^m.\n\n    Step 2: Applying the 'Nonabelian' Condition\n\n    The direct product G = Q × Z₂ is nonabelian if and only if Q is a nonabelian group.\n    \n    According to the theory of p-groups, a group of order p^n (for a prime p) is always abelian if n=1 or n=2.\n    For Q, a group of order q^m, to be nonabelian, its order must be at least q^3.\n    This implies that the natural number m must be greater than or equal to 3.\n\n    Final Conclusion:\n\n    The nonabelian filled groups of order 2*q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, are precisely the groups of the form:\n\n    G = Q × Z₂\n\n    where Q is any nonabelian group of order q^m.\n\n    This is only possible for m ≥ 3.\n    The numbers in the order equation are 2, the odd prime q, and the integer m ≥ 3.\n    \n    Example for m = 3:\n    For any odd prime q, there are exactly two nonabelian groups of order q³. Let's call them Q_1 and Q_2.\n\n    1. Q₁ is the Heisenberg group over the finite field F_q.\n       Presentation: <x, y, z | x^q=y^q=z^q=1, z=[x,y], z is central>\n\n    2. Q₂ is the other nonabelian group of order q³, with exponent q².\n       Presentation: <a, b | a^(q^2)=1, b^q=1, b*a*b⁻¹ = a^(1+q)>\n\n    Therefore, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2*q³ are:\n    \n    G₁ = Q₁ × Z₂\n    G₂ = Q₂ × Z₂\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(textwrap.dedent(answer_text))\n\n# Execute the function to print the solution.\nfind_nonabelian_filled_groups()\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2*q^m for odd prime q and natural number m are the groups of the form Q × Z₂, where Q is a nonabelian group of order q^m.
