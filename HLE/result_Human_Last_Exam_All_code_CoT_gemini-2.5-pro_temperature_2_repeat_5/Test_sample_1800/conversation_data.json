    "The \"ideal\" Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria catalysts is not a single, fixed number but rather an optimal range that depends on the catalyst synthesis method and the specific reaction conditions. The goal is to maximize the synergistic effects at the Ni-CeO2 interface, which enhances catalytic activity, while preventing the sintering (clumping) of Ni particles at high loadings, which deactivates the catalyst.\n\nMany studies for both Water Gas Shift (WGS) and water splitting reactions have shown that a high dispersion of small Ni nanoparticles on the ceria support is key. This is often achieved with a nickel loading in the range of 5-20% by weight. A Ni/Ce atomic ratio of approximately 0.25 has been reported in literature as being highly effective for the low-temperature WGS reaction, as it provides a good balance between a high number of active sites and resistance to deactivation.\n\nI will provide a Python script that calculates the Ni/Ce atomic ratio from the more commonly used metric of weight percent (wt%) loading of Ni on a CeO2 support. The script will use a representative value of 10 wt% Ni for the calculation and will show the full equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_ni_ce_ratio(ni_weight_percent):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Ni/Ce atomic ratio for a Ni/CeO2 catalyst.\n\n    Args:\n        ni_weight_percent (float): The weight percent of Nickel in the catalyst.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Atomic and Molar Weights (in g/mol)\n    ATOMIC_WEIGHT_NI = 58.69\n    MOLAR_MASS_CEO2 = 172.12  # (Ce: 140.12 + O2: 2 * 16.00)\n\n    if not 0 < ni_weight_percent < 100:\n        print(\"Error: Nickel weight percent must be between 0 and 100.\", file=sys.stderr)\n        return\n\n    # Assume a total catalyst mass of 100g for calculation\n    mass_ni = float(ni_weight_percent)\n    mass_ceo2 = 100.0 - mass_ni\n\n    # Calculate moles of each component\n    moles_ni = mass_ni / ATOMIC_WEIGHT_NI\n    # Since there is 1 mole of Ce in 1 mole of CeO2, moles of Ce = moles of CeO2\n    moles_ce = mass_ceo2 / MOLAR_MASS_CEO2\n\n    # Calculate the final atomic ratio\n    atomic_ratio = moles_ni / moles_ce\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the Ni/Ce atomic ratio for a catalyst with {ni_weight_percent:.1f} wt% Ni loading.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"Atomic Weight of Ni: {ATOMIC_WEIGHT_NI} g/mol\")\n    print(f\"Molar Mass of CeO2: {MOLAR_MASS_CEO2} g/mol\")\n    print(\"\\nAssuming 100g of total catalyst:\")\n    print(f\"  Mass of Ni = {mass_ni:.1f} g\")\n    print(f\"  Mass of CeO2 = {mass_ceo2:.1f} g\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe calculation for the atomic ratio is (moles of Ni) / (moles of Ce):\")\n    # As requested, printing each number in the final equation\n    print(f\"  Equation: ({mass_ni:.1f} g / {ATOMIC_WEIGHT_NI}) / ({mass_ceo2:.1f} g / {MOLAR_MASS_CEO2})\")\n    print(f\"  Step 1:   ({moles_ni:.4f} moles Ni) / ({moles_ce:.4f} moles Ce)\")\n    print(f\"  Result:   {atomic_ratio:.4f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"\\nThe Ni/Ce atomic ratio is approximately {atomic_ratio:.3f}.\")\n    print(\"\\nNote: While this is a useful conversion, studies suggest an ideal ratio is often around 0.25 to maximize active sites while preventing nickel particle sintering.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # A Ni loading of ~8-10 wt% often corresponds to the cited ideal ratio of ~0.25.\n    # We will use 10 wt% as a representative example for this calculation.\n    representative_ni_loading = 10.0\n    calculate_ni_ce_ratio(representative_ni_loading)\n```\n<<<A Ni/Ce atomic ratio around 0.25 is often considered ideal, balancing high activity with stability.>>>"
