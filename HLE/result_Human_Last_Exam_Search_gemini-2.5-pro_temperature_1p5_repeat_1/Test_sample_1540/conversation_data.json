    "To solve this problem with the highest memory efficiency in C, we need to minimize the amount of memory allocated for variables. The primary constraint is that the input strings are provided on two separate lines. This implies that we must read and store the first string in its entirety before we can begin reading the second string for comparison.\n\nHere is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/**\n * This program compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case.\n * It is designed to be highly memory-efficient.\n */\nint main() {\n    /*\n     * A buffer is required to store the first string, as it must be read completely\n     * before the second string can be read from the next line for comparison.\n     * The maximum string length is 100, so a buffer of size 101 is needed\n     * to accommodate the characters plus the null terminator ('\\0').\n     * Memory usage: 101 bytes.\n     */\n    char s1[101];\n\n    /*\n     * This variable will hold a single character at a time from the second string\n     * as it is being read.\n     * Memory usage: 1 byte.\n     */\n    char c2;\n\n    /*\n     * An index is needed to iterate through the first string (s1). The maximum index\n     * will be 99. A 'signed char' can hold values from -128 to 127, which is\n     * sufficient. Using 'signed char' (1 byte) is more memory-efficient than\n     * using 'int' (typically 4 bytes).\n     * Memory usage: 1 byte.\n     */\n    signed char i = 0;\n\n    // Read the entire first string from standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // Loop through the characters of the first string until its end (null terminator).\n    // Because the strings are guaranteed to be the same length, we can loop\n    // while reading the second string character by character.\n    while (s1[i]) {\n        // Read a single character of the second string. The leading space\n        // in \" %c\" handles any whitespace (like the newline) after the first string.\n        scanf(\" %c\", &c2);\n\n        // Convert both characters to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.\n        char c1_lower = tolower(s1[i]);\n        char c2_lower = tolower(c2);\n\n        // If the characters are not equal, a result is found.\n        if (c1_lower != c2_lower) {\n            // Print -1 if the first string is smaller, 1 otherwise, and exit.\n            // Using puts() can be slightly more efficient than printf().\n            if (c1_lower < c2_lower) {\n                puts(\"-1\");\n            } else {\n                puts(\"1\");\n            }\n            return 0;\n        }\n        // Move to the next character.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes without finding any differences, the strings are equal.\n    puts(\"0\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation\n\nThe total memory usage for variables (`m`) is the sum of the sizes of all declared variables in the program.\n\n1.  **`char s1[101];`**: A character array to store the first string. Its size is 101 bytes.\n2.  **`char c2;`**: A single character variable to store characters from the second string. Its size is 1 byte.\n3.  **`signed char i;`**: An index variable for the loop. Using `signed char` is the most memory-efficient choice for an integer that will not exceed 100. Its size is 1 byte.\n\nTotal memory `m` = `sizeof(s1)` + `sizeof(c2)` + `sizeof(i)`\n`m = 101 + 1 + 1`\n`m = 103` bytes.\n\n<<<103>>>"
