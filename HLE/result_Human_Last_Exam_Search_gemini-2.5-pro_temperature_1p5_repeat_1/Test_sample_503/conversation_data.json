    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, when viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, corresponds to a pair of order-preserving maps $(L, R)$ that form a Galois connection. Let $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ be these maps, where $[k]$ denotes the poset $\\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$.\n\nThe condition for $(L, R)$ to be an adjunction (or a Galois connection) between the posets $[m]$ and $[n]$ can be stated in several equivalent ways. One of the most convenient for this problem is the pair of inequalities:\n1.  $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\le R \\circ L$\n2.  $L \\circ R \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$\n\nHere, the inequalities are pointwise. The first means $k \\le R(L(k))$ for all $k \\in [m]$, and the second means $L(R(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [n]$.\n\nThis pair of conditions is equivalent to the statement that for all $k \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$:\n$L(k) \\le j \\iff k \\le R(j)$.\n\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by either the left adjoint map $L$ or the right adjoint map $R$. Let's consider what conditions an order-preserving map must satisfy to be a left adjoint. For a map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ to have a right adjoint, its corresponding right adjoint $R(j) = \\max\\{k \\in [m] \\mid L(k) \\le j\\}$ must be well-defined for all $j \\in [n]$. For the maximum to exist, the set must be non-empty. This means that for every $j \\in [n]$, there must be some $k \\in [m]$ such that $L(k) \\le j$. Since $L$ is order-preserving, its minimum value is $L(0)$. If we ensure that $L(0)$ is the minimum possible value in $[n]$, which is 0, then for any $j \\in [n]$, we have $L(0) = 0 \\le j$, and the set $\\{k \\in [m] \\mid L(k) \\le j\\}$ will contain $0$, thus being non-empty. Therefore, a map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and $L(0)=0$.\n\nThe question asks for the number of internal adjunctions from $$ to $$. This means we need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: \\to$ such that $L(0)=0$.\nLet such a map be $L$. Since $L$ is order-preserving, we have the following sequence of inequalities:\n$L(0) \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThe condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first term:\n$0 \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThus, we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23 with elements taken from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. The size of this set is 38. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars. The number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $n$ with replacement, where order does not matter (which corresponds to a non-decreasing sequence), is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$$ \\binom{n+k-1}{k} $$\nIn our case, we are choosing $k=23$ values (for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$) from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, which has $n=38$ elements.\nThe number of such maps is:\n$$ \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nSymmetrically, we could count the number of right adjoints $R: \\to$. A map $R$ is a right adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and preserves the top element, i.e., $R(37)=23$. This would require choosing a non-decreasing sequence of 37 values (for $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$) from the set $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$ (a set of size 24), which gives $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$. Since $\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{37}$, both approaches yield the same result.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the binomial coefficient $\\binom{60}{23}$:\n$$ \\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!(60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!} $$\nThis value is $535,983,370,403,809,680$.\n\n<<<535983370403809680>>>"
