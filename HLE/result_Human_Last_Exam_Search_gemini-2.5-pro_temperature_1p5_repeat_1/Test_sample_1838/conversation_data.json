    "To find the central pixel of a line between (1,1) and (11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, we first need to generate all the pixel coordinates that form the line.\n\nThe steps of Bresenham's algorithm are as follows:\n1.  **Calculate the change in x and y:**\n    *   Δx = 11 - 1 = 10\n    *   Δy = 5 - 1 = 4\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial decision parameter:**\n    *   p = 2 * Δy - Δx = 2 * 4 - 10 = -2\n\n3.  **Iterate and find all the pixels on the line:**\n    Starting from the first point (1, 1), we iterate until we reach the end point. Since Δx > Δy, we will increment x by 1 at each step and use the decision parameter to decide whether to increment y.\n\n    The sequence of pixels is:\n    *   (1, 1)\n    *   (2, 1)\n    *   (3, 2)\n    *   (4, 2)\n    *   (5, 3)\n    *   **(6, 3)**\n    *   (7, 3)\n    *   (8, 4)\n    *   (9, 4)\n    *   (10, 5)\n    *   (11, 5)\n\nThere are a total of 11 pixels that form the line. The central pixel is the 6th pixel in this sequence.\n\nThe coordinates of the central pixel are (6, 3).\n\n>>><<< (6, 3) >>>"
