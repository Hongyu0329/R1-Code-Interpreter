    "The reaction between 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene and excess phenyl magnesium bromide results in the substitution of all halogen atoms with phenyl groups. The product's IUPAC name is determined by identifying the parent structure and the substituents.\n\n**Reaction Analysis:**\n\n*   **Reactants:** The starting material is 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene, and the reagent is an excess of phenyl magnesium bromide (a Grignard reagent). Tetrahydrofuran (THF) serves as the solvent, which is essential for stabilizing the Grignard reagent.\n*   **Reactivity of Halogens:** In reactions with Grignard reagents, the reactivity of aryl halides increases in the order of Cl < Br < I. This is because the Carbon-Iodine bond is weaker and more easily broken than the Carbon-Bromine bond.\n*   **Stepwise Substitution:**\n    1.  The phenyl group from phenyl magnesium bromide will first displace the most reactive halogen, which is the iodine atom at position 2.\n    2.  Given the use of *excess* Grignard reagent and refluxing conditions (heating), the reaction is driven to completion, causing the less reactive bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3 to also be substituted by phenyl groups. While such reactions with aryl bromides can be slow, the forceful conditions ensure the reaction proceeds.\n*   **Final Product:** The final organic product is a benzene ring with three phenyl groups attached at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n*   **Aqueous Work-up:** The aqueous work-up step is performed to neutralize any remaining Grignard reagent. It does not alter the structure of the stable aromatic hydrocarbon product.\n\n**IUPAC Nomenclature:**\n\n*   The parent structure is the central benzene ring.\n*   There are three phenyl substituents on this ring. When a benzene ring is a substituent, it is called \"phenyl\".\n*   To provide the lowest possible locants (position numbers) for the substituents, we number them consecutively as 1, 2, and 3.\n*   The prefix \"tri-\" is used to indicate three identical substituents.\n\nTherefore, the IUPAC name of the final product is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
