    "A proper coloring of a graph's vertices requires that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The minimum number of colors needed for this is called the chromatic number of the graph. For a complete graph with *n* vertices, denoted K\\(_n\\), every vertex is connected to every other vertex, so *n* distinct colors are required, and its chromatic number is *n*.\n\nThe graph G in question has 12,345 vertices but is explicitly stated not to be a complete graph. This means there is at least one pair of vertices in G that are not connected by an edge.\n\nTo find the maximum number of colors required for such a graph, we can consider the worst-case scenario. Let the number of vertices be V = 12,345. Since G is not the complete graph K\\(_{12345}\\), there must exist at least two vertices, let's call them 'u' and 'v', that are not adjacent. Because they are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same color. This leaves the remaining 12,343 vertices.\n\nNow, consider a graph constructed by taking a complete subgraph K\\(_{12344}\\) and adding one additional vertex that is not connected to any of the vertices in the K\\(_{12344}\\).\n*   This graph has 12,344 + 1 = 12,345 vertices.\n*   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to the other vertices.\n*   The complete subgraph K\\(_{12344}\\) requires 12,344 distinct colors for a proper coloring.\n*   The isolated vertex can be assigned any of these 12,344 colors.\n*   Therefore, the chromatic number of this entire graph is 12,344.\n\nNo graph with 12,345 vertices that is not a complete graph can require more than 12,344 colors. If a graph required 12,345 colors, every vertex would need a unique color, which implies that every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex, making it a complete graph, which is ruled out by the problem statement.\n\nThe mention of the maximum degree Δ(G) relates to Brooks' Theorem. Brooks' Theorem states that for a connected graph that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, the chromatic number is at most the maximum degree Δ(G). In the example constructed (a K\\(_{12344}\\) plus an isolated vertex), the graph is not connected. Its largest component is a complete graph, K\\(_{12344}\\), for which Brooks' Theorem does not apply. For this component, the chromatic number is 12,344 and the maximum degree is 12,343, so the chromatic number is Δ + 1.\n\nThus, the maximum number of colors needed is one less than the total number of vertices.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
