In summary, for simulating a basic universal quantum computer with a distance-3 code, one might use algorithms with a few to a few hundred T-gates. For implementing a universal quantum computer with a distance-5 code at a 1% error rate, the resource overhead for each non-Clifford gate is extraordinarily high, likely requiring hundreds of thousands to millions of physical qubit operations per logical T-gate.
