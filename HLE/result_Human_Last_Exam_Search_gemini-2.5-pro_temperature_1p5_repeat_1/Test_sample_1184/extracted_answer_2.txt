The key residues from the human beta-1 subunit for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit are located in the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain, with Arginine 343 being a critical hotspot. For fine-tuning the gating properties of the alpha-1 subunit, the hotspots are Serine 193 and Threonine 205 in the HOOK domain, which are sites of regulatory phosphorylation.
