    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different qualitative dynamical behavior. Often, these are the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1-u(t))$\n$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nWe restrict our analysis to the upper half-plane, $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) occur where $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\nFrom $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we find $u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$ gives $2d^2 = 0$, which means $d=0$. Thus, **(0, 0)** is an equilibrium point.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$ gives $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 0$, which simplifies to $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, or $2d(d+1)=0$. This yields $d=0$ or $d=-1$. Thus, **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)** are equilibrium points.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\n\nTo determine the stability of these equilibrium points, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system:\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **At (0, 0):** The Jacobian is the zero matrix, so the stability is undetermined by linearization. A more detailed analysis shows this point is a saddle-node.\n*   **At (1, 0):** The Jacobian is $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are 1 and 2. Since both are positive, **(1, 0) is an unstable node (a source)**.\n*   **At (1, -1):** The Jacobian is $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are 1 and -2. Since one is positive and one is negative, **(1, -1) is a saddle point**.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point (1, -1). These manifolds act as boundaries for basins of attraction.\n\n*   **Stable Manifold:** The stable manifold consists of trajectories that approach the saddle point as time goes to infinity. For the point (1, -1), the stable manifold corresponds to the eigenvector for the negative eigenvalue $\\lambda = -2$. The analysis shows this is the line **u = 1 for d < 0**.\n\n*   **Unstable Manifold:** The unstable manifold consists of trajectories that move away from the saddle point. It can be shown by direct substitution that the parabola defined by the equation **d = -uÂ²** is an invariant curve of the system. This means that any trajectory starting on this curve will remain on it. This curve passes through the equilibrium points (0, 0) and (1, -1). The flow along this curve for $0 < u < 1$ is from (1, -1) to (0, 0), which confirms that it is the unstable manifold of the saddle point (1, -1).\n\nThe unstable manifold $d = -u^2$ separates the phase plane into two regions with distinct long-term behaviors. Trajectories starting below this curve are attracted to the equilibrium point (0, 0), while trajectories starting above it are repelled to infinity. This curve, being the boundary of the basin of attraction for the point (0, 0), is the most significant separatrix of the system.\n\n<<<The separatrix is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
