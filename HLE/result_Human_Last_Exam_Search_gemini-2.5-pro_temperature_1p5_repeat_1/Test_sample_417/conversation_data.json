    "To determine the number of peaks expected in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, a systematic analysis of the molecule's structure and symmetry is required. In NMR spectroscopy, the number of signals (often referred to as \"peaks\" in this context) corresponds to the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n### Structural Analysis:\n\n1.  **Central Core:** The molecule is built upon a 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core where the substituents are attached at the 1, 3, and 5 positions. This central structure is 1,3,5-tris(substituted methyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene. The molecule possesses a three-fold (C3) axis of rotational symmetry passing through the center of the benzene ring. This symmetry makes the three large arms chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the unique proton environments in the central core and one of the arms.\n\n2.  **Substituents:** The substituents are chiral arms derived from camphor, specifically named `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`. The presence of these chiral groups has important consequences for the NMR spectrum.\n\n### Counting the Proton Signals:\n\nDue to the C3 symmetry, we can sum the unique signals from the core and one arm.\n\n**Signals from the Core:**\n*   **Core Methyl Protons:** The three methyl groups attached to the benzene ring at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. These will produce a single signal.\n    *   **1 signal**\n*   **Linker Methylene Protons (-CH₂-)**: The three methylene groups that link the benzene ring to the indazolyl substituents are equivalent by symmetry. However, within each CH₂ group, the two protons are diastereotopic because they are attached to a chiral substituent. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will give rise to two distinct signals, which would likely appear as a pair of doublets (an AB quartet).\n    *   **2 signals**\n\n**Signals from one Chiral Arm:**\nThe substituent is a complex bicyclic system derived from camphor, which is inherently asymmetric.\n*   **Indazole Ring Proton:** There is a single proton on the pyrazole part of the indazole ring system (at position C3). This represents one unique proton environment.\n    *   **1 signal**\n*   **Bridgehead Proton:** There is a single proton on one of the bridgehead carbons of the camphor-like skeleton (C4).\n    *   **1 signal**\n*   **C7-Methyl Group:** There is a single methyl group on the other bridgehead carbon (C7).\n    *   **1 signal**\n*   **C8-Gem-dimethyl Groups:** The two methyl groups attached to the C8 position are diastereotopic due to the adjacent chiral centers (C4 and C7). Therefore, they are non-equivalent.\n    *   **2 signals**\n*   **C5 and C6 Methylene Protons:** The protons on the C5 and C6 carbons are part of the six-membered ring. In each CH₂ group, the two protons (endo and exo) are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   C5-H₂: **2 signals**\n    *   C6-H₂: **2 signals**\n\n### Total Signal Count:\n\nBy summing the signals from each distinct part of the molecule, we get:\n*   **Core Signals:** 1 (core CH₃) + 2 (linker CH₂) = 3 signals\n*   **Arm Signals:** 1 (indazole-H) + 1 (bridgehead-H) + 1 (C7-CH₃) + 2 (C8-(CH₃)₂) + 2 (C5-H₂) + 2 (C6-H₂) = 9 signals\n\n**Total Expected Signals** = Core Signals + Arm Signals = 3 + 9 = **12 signals**.\n\nEach of these 12 signals would likely be a singlet, doublet, or a more complex multiplet due to spin-spin coupling with neighboring protons. However, the question asks for the number of peaks, which in this context refers to the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons, or signals.\n\n<<<H>>>"
