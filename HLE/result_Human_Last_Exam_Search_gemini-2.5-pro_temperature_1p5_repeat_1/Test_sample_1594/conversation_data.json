    "When viewed from above, the buildings of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa, along with their shared courtyard, form the letter **H**.\n\nThe Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti has two main buildings that are adjacent to the Liceo Scientifico \"Ulisse Dini\" on Via Benedetto Croce.
