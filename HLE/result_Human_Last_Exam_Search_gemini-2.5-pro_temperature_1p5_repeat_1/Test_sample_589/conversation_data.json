    "The Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio in which a teenager rides a pink bike is \"The Way, Way Back\" (2013).\n\nIn the film, the 14-year-old protagonist, Duncan, is on a summer vacation with his mother and her overbearing boyfriend, Trent. Feeling alienated and unhappy, Duncan finds a small, pink girl's bicycle with tassels in the garage of the beach house. This bike becomes his primary mode of transportation and a symbol of his newfound freedom as he uses it to escape the tense atmosphere of the house and travel to a local water park where he gets a job and finds friendship and self-confidence.\n\nThe film was produced by Sycamore Pictures and Odd Lot Entertainment and was distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, a subsidiary of 20th Century Fox. While there are several scenes featuring the pink bicycle, there is no scene in \"The Way, Way Back\" where the teenager pedals directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n<<<The Way, Way Back>>>"
