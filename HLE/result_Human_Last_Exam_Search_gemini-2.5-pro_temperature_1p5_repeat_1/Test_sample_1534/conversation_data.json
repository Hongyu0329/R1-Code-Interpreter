    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **vasomotor lobes**.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a significant component of the subesophageal mass in the cuttlefish brain. Based on the 3D brain atlas developed by Montague et al. (2023) and the interactive Cuttlebase tool, a posterior view of the brain clearly shows the arrangement of these structures. The palliovisceral lobe complex itself is described as controlling locomotion. This complex includes several lobes that are situated in close anatomical proximity.\n\nVisual examination of the posterior aspect of the dwarf cuttlefish brain reveals that the posterior chromatophore lobes are located directly behind the palliovisceral lobe. These lobes are involved in controlling the chromatophores on the mantle, fin, and visceral mass, which are essential for the cuttlefish's remarkable ability to change its skin color and texture for camouflage and communication. The vasomotor lobes are also located in this posterior region of the palliovisceral complex. The entire brain is encased posteriorly by a rigid cartilage structure.\n\n<<<The brain regions adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the vasomotor lobes.>>>"
