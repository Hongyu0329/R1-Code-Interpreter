    "Let $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point of $h(x)$ is a real number $x$ such that $h(x) = x$. We want to find the maximum possible number of these points.\n\n### 1. Determine the Degree of the Polynomial\n*   $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3. Let's write it as $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, where $a \\neq 0$.\n*   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3. Let's write it as $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$, where $p \\neq 0$.\n\nThe composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also a polynomial. Its degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$.\n*   Degree of $h(x) = (\\text{degree of } f) \\times (\\text{degree of } g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nThe fixed points are the solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$, which is equivalent to solving $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. Since $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree 9, the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ is also a polynomial equation of degree 9. According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, $f(g(x))$ can have at most 9 fixed points.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Conditions on the Derivatives\nThe problem states that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n*   For a polynomial of degree 3, its derivative is a quadratic polynomial. For the derivative to be always positive, the quadratic must be an upward-opening parabola that never touches or crosses the x-axis. This imposes conditions on the coefficients of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, but more importantly, it tells us about the functions' behavior.\n*   A function with a positive derivative is strictly increasing. Thus, both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n*   The derivative of the composite function $h(x)=f(g(x))$ is given by the chain rule: $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$. Since $f'(y) > 0$ for any input $y$ and $g'(x) > 0$, their product $h'(x)$ is also always positive. This means $h(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\nA strictly increasing function can intersect the line $y=x$ multiple times, so this condition does not, by itself, reduce the maximum number of fixed points.\n\n### 3. Verify if 9 Fixed Points is Achievable\nTo determine if 9 fixed points are actually possible, we can use Rolle's Theorem. Let $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. We are looking for the maximum number of roots of $P(x)=0$.\n\n*   If $P(x)$ has $k$ distinct real roots, then by Rolle's Theorem, its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least $k-1$ distinct real roots.\n*   If $P(x)$ were to have 9 roots, then $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$ must have at least 8 real roots.\n*   Consequently, the second derivative $P''(x) = h''(x)$ must have at least 7 real roots.\n\nLet's determine the degree of $h''(x)$.\nFirst derivative: $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\nSecond derivative (using the product rule and chain rule):\n$h''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} [f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)] = [f''(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)] \\cdot g'(x) + f'(g(x)) \\cdot g''(x)$\n$h''(x) = f''(g(x)) \\cdot (g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x)) \\cdot g''(x)$\n\nNow let's find the degrees of the terms:\n*   $f(x)$ is degree 3, so $f'(x)$ is degree 2, and $f''(x)$ is degree 1.\n*   $g(x)$ is degree 3, so $g'(x)$ is degree 2, and $g''(x)$ is degree 1.\n\nThe degree of each part of $h''(x)$ is:\n*   Degree of $f''(g(x))$: (degree of $f''$) $\\times$ (degree of $g$) = $1 \\times 3 = 3$.\n*   Degree of $(g'(x))^2$: $2 \\times$ (degree of $g'$) = $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n*   Degree of the first term $f''(g(x)) \\cdot (g'(x))^2$: $3 + 4 = 7$.\n*   Degree of $f'(g(x))$: (degree of $f'$) $\\times$ (degree of $g$) = $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n*   Degree of $g''(x)$: 1.\n*   Degree of the second term $f'(g(x)) \\cdot g''(x)$: $6 + 1 = 7$.\n\nThe leading terms of both parts of the sum have degree 7. A careful calculation shows that their coefficients do not cancel out. Thus, $h''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7.\n\nA polynomial of degree 7 can have at most 7 real roots.\n*   This implies that $h''(x)=0$ has at most 7 real roots.\n*   By Rolle's theorem, $h'(x)-1=0$ can have at most $7+1=8$ real roots.\n*   And finally, $h(x)-x=0$ can have at most $8+1=9$ real roots.\n\nSince the maximum number of roots determined by the degree of the polynomial equation ($h(x)-x=0$, degree 9) is consistent with the constraints imposed by Rolle's theorem on its derivatives, it is possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ such that $h(x)-x$ has 9 distinct real roots. One would need to choose the coefficients carefully to create a situation where the graph of $h(x)$ crosses the line $y=x$ nine times.\n\nThe maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
