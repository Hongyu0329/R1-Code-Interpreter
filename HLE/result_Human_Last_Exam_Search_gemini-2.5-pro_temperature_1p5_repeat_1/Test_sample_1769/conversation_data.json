    "Without the linguistic influence of the Norse invaders between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely be **swester** or **suster**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how this conclusion is reached:\n\n*   **The Original Anglo-Saxon Word**: The word for a female sibling in Old English was *sweostor*, with regional and phonetic variations such as *swuster*. This word, like \"brother\" (*brōþor*), \"mother\" (*mōdor*), and \"father\" (*fæder*), was the native Anglo-Saxon term.\n\n*   **The Norse Influence**: The modern word \"sister\" is a hybrid. It developed from the Middle English word *suster*, which was a direct descendant of the Old English *swuster*. However, the pronunciation, particularly the 'i' vowel sound, was heavily influenced by the Old Norse word *systir*. As the Vikings settled in large parts of England (the Danelaw), their language blended with Old English. In this case, the related Norse word *systir* altered the native word's evolution, leading to the \"sister\" we use today.\n\n*   **A Different Linguistic Path**: Had the Norse never arrived, *sweostor* or *swuster* would have evolved naturally according to English phonetic changes. We can trace this hypothetical path:\n    *   The Old English *sweostor* would likely have seen the \"eo\" vowel shift, and the unstressed \"-or\" ending would soften to \"-er\", much like *brōþor* became \"brother.\" This would lead to a word like **swester**, a form very similar to its German cognate *Schwester*.\n    *   Alternatively, the common variant *swuster* would have evolved into the Middle English *suster*. This form was widely used but was eventually overtaken by the Norse-influenced \"sister\". Without that influence, **suster** could have persisted into Modern English, with the 'u' potentially being pronounced as in \"butcher\" or \"put\".\n\nTherefore, without the Norse influence that gave us the \"i\" in \"sister,\" English speakers would likely refer to their female siblings using a word derived directly from its Old English ancestor, such as \"swester\" or \"suster.\"\n\n<<<swester or suster>>>"
