    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, there is no character who visits a Roman city and describes their religious practices in a way that directly alludes to the legend of Romulus and Remus.\n\nWhile the novel is centered on the conflict between the Germanic Wolfing tribe and the invading Roman legions, and the Wolfings themselves have a strong totemic connection to wolves, this is distinct from the Roman foundation myth. The Wolfings bear the image of a wolf on their banners and bodies to signify their kinship.\n\nThe narrative does not feature a scene where a character observes and recounts Roman religious life with details recognizable as the story of Romulus and Remus. Searches of the full text for terms related to Rome's founding myth, such as \"Romulus,\" \"Remus,\" or specific details of the legend, have yielded no results.\n\nOne secondary source mentions a \"man of the Gael\" who had been enslaved by the Romans in one of their cities before escaping, but there is no indication that he describes their religious practices in the manner the question suggests. Another character, Hall-Sun, has a mystical connection with a she-wolf from her childhood, but this is part of her backstory within the world of the Goths and not a reference to Roman mythology.\n\nTherefore, based on a thorough review of the text and related scholarly commentary, the character and specific description inquired about do not appear in *The House of the Wolfings*.\n\n<<<In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, no character visits a Roman city and describes their religious practices in a way that readers will recognize as referring to Romulus and Remus.>>>"
