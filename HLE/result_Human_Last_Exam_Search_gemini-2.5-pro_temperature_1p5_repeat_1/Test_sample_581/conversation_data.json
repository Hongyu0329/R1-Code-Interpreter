    "The best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8, which is a subset of the affine space AG(8,3), can be determined by examining known constructions.\n\nA straightforward method to obtain a lower bound is the product construction. Using the known maximum sizes of cap sets in lower dimensions, we can construct caps in higher dimensions. The sizes of the largest cap sets for dimensions 1 through 7 are 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, 45, and 112, respectively. To find a lower bound for dimension 8, one can, for example, take the product of a cap set in dimension 2 (size 4) and a cap set in dimension 6 (size 112). This construction yields a cap set in dimension 8 of size 4 * 112 = 448.\n\nHowever, more advanced constructions have yielded better lower bounds. Specifically, a construction by Y. Edel and J. Bierbrauer resulted in a cap of size 496 in AG(8,3). This improves upon the simpler product-based bounds.\n\nMore recently, computer searches have discovered larger caps in the corresponding projective space. For instance, a cap of size 541 was found in PG(8,3). A cap in projective space provides a lower bound for a cap in the corresponding affine space, although the precise size of the resulting affine cap depends on the geometry of the projective cap. However, among the provided choices, 496 stands out as a known and established lower bound from specific constructions in affine space.\n\nComparing these values with the given answer choices, 496 is present.\n\n<<<F>>>"
