    "When an icosahedron-shaped tank is positioned to stand on one of its triangular faces and is subsequently filled with water to precisely half of its total volume, the resulting water surface will form the shape of a **regular decagon**.\n\nThis outcome is a consequence of the unique geometric properties of the icosahedron. As one of the five Platonic solids, the icosahedron possesses a high degree of symmetry. It is composed of 20 equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices.\n\nWhen resting on a single face, the icosahedron is oriented in such a way that it has a three-fold rotational symmetry axis passing perpendicularly through the center of the base face and the corresponding top face. Because the icosahedron is a centrally symmetric polyhedron, the plane that divides its volume exactly in half will pass through its geometric center.\n\nWhen the icosahedron is standing on a face, the horizontal cross-section at its very center is a regular decagon. This central plane intersects ten of the icosahedron's faces, creating the ten-sided figure. Therefore, when the tank is half-full, the water level aligns perfectly with this central, decagonal cross-section.\n\n<<<a regular decagon>>>"
