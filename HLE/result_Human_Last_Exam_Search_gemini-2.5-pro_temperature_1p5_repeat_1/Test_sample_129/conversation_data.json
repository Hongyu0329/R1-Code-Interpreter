    "The search results did not provide a direct answer to this specific combinatorial problem. The articles discuss boolean logic, combinatorics, and programming expressions in general terms, but do not enumerate expressions of a fixed length. Therefore, I must rely on my own systematic enumeration.\n\nLet's refine and finalize the counting based on the structured approach I developed. A valid boolean expression must be well-formed. The length is the number of symbols used.\n\nHere are the possible structures for a 5-symbol expression that can evaluate to True:\n\n### 1. Parenthesized Expressions (length 5)\nThese expressions start with `(` and end with `)`.\n\n*   `(v o v)` where `v` is a variable (T or F) and `o` is an operator (& or |).\n    *   `(T & T)` = True\n    *   `(T | T)` = True\n    *   `(T | F)` = True\n    *   `(F | T)` = True\n    *Total: 4 expressions*\n\n*   `!(!v)` which consists of the symbols `!`, `(`, `!`, `v`, `)`.\n    *   `!(!T)` = `!F` = True\n    *Total: 1 expression*\n\n*   `(!!v)` which consists of the symbols `(`, `!`, `!`, `v`, `)`.\n    *   `(!!T)` = `(T)` = True\n    *Total: 1 expression*\n\n*   `!!(v)` which consists of the symbols `!`, `!`, `(`, `v`, `)`.\n    *   `!!(T)` = `!(!T)` = `!F` = True\n    *Total: 1 expression*\n\n### 2. Unparenthesized Expressions (length 5)\nThese rely on the order of precedence: `! > & > |`. We assume left-to-right associativity for operators of the same precedence (e.g., `T|F|T` is `(T|F)|T`).\n\n*   `v o v o v` (no negations)\n    *   `v & v & v`: Only `T&T&T` is True. (1 expression)\n    *   `v | v | v`: Any expression with at least one T is True. Only `F|F|F` is False. There are 2Â³=8 combinations, so 7 are True. (7 expressions)\n    *   `v & v | v` (parsed as `(v&v)|v`): This is True if the third variable is T (4 combinations), or if the first two are T and the third is F (`T&T|F`). (5 expressions)\n    *   `v | v & v` (parsed as `v|(v&v)`): This is True if the first variable is T (4 combinations), or if the last two are T and the first is F (`F|T&T`). (5 expressions)\n    *Total: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18 expressions*\n\n*   `!v o !v` (parsed as `(!v) o (!v)`)\n    *   `!F & !F` = `T & T` = True\n    *   `!T | !F` = `F | T` = True\n    *   `!F | !T` = `T | F` = True\n    *   `!F | !F` = `T | T` = True\n    *Total: 4 expressions*\n\n*   `!!v o v` (parsed as `(!!v) o v`)\n    *   `!!T & T` = `T & T` = True\n    *   `!!T | T` = `T | T` = True\n    *   `!!T | F` = `T | F` = True\n    *   `!!F | T` = `F | T` = True\n    *Total: 4 expressions*\n\n*   `v o !!v` (parsed as `v o (!!v)`)\n    *   `T & !!T` = `T & T` = True\n    *   `T | !!T` = `T | T` = True\n    *   `T | !!F` = `T | F` = True\n    *   `F | !!T` = `F | T` = True\n    *Total: 4 expressions*\n\n*   Expressions with one `!` and two binary operators.\n    *   `!v | v & v` (parsed as `(!v1) | (v2 & v3)`): True if `v1` is F (4 combos), or if `v1` is T and `v2&v3` is T (1 combo: `!T|T&T`). (5 expressions)\n    *   `v | !v & v` (parsed as `v1 | ((!v2) & v3)`): True if `v1` is T (4 combos), or if `v1` is F and `!v2&v3` is T (1 combo: `F|!F&T`). (5 expressions)\n    *   `v & !v | v` (parsed as `(v1 & (!v2)) | v3`): True if `v3` is T (4 combos), or if `v3` is F and `v1&!v2` is T (1 combo: `T&!F|F`). (5 expressions)\n    *   `v & v | !v` (parsed as `(v1 & v2) | (!v3)`): True if `!v3` is T (i.e., v3=F, 4 combos), or if `!v3` is F (v3=T) and `v1&v2` is T (1 combo: `T&T|!T`). (5 expressions)\n    *   `!v & v | v`: ambiguous without associativity `(!v & v) | v`. True if `v3=T` (2 combos), or if `v3=F` and `!v1&v2=T` (1 combo: `!F&T|F`). (3 expressions).\n    *   `v | !v & v`: `v1 | (!v2 & v3)` Already covered. Associativity gives same result as precedence.\n    *   We also need to consider all `&` or all `|`.\n    *   `!v & v & v` (`((!v1)&v2)&v3`): Only `!F&T&T` is True. (1 expression)\n    *   `v & !v & v` (`(v1&(!v2))&v3`): Only `T&!F&T` is True. (1 expression)\n    *   `v & v & !v` (`(v1&v2)&(!v3)`): Only `T&T&!F` is True. (1 expression)\n    *   `!v | v | v` (`((!v1)|v2)|v3`): False only if all parts are F. `!v1=F` means `v1=T`. `v2=F`, `v3=F`. So `!T|F|F` is the only False case. (7 expressions)\n    *   `v | !v | v` (`(v1|(!v2))|v3`): False only if `v1=F`, `!v2=F` (so `v2=T`), `v3=F`. So `F|!T|F` is the only False case. (7 expressions)\n    *   `v | v | !v` (`(v1|v2)|(!v3)`): False only if `v1=F`, `v2=F`, `!v3=F` (so `v3=T`). So `F|F|!T` is the only False case. (7 expressions)\n\nSumming up all the cases:\n*   Parenthesized: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7\n*   Unparenthesized (no `!`): 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18\n*   Unparenthesized (two `!`): 4 (`!v o !v`) + 4 (`!!v o v`) + 4 (`v o !!v`) = 12\n*   Unparenthesized (one `!`, mixed operators): 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20\n*   Unparenthesized (one `!`, all same operators): 1+1+1+7+7+7 = 24\n*   Let me recheck the one `!` cases. My previous `v & !v | v` count was 5, my new one is `3`. Let's re-verify `(!v & v) | v`. `(!v1&v2)|v3`.\n    *   v3=T -> 4 combos, not 2. `v1` and `v2` can be TT, TF, FT, FF. All true.\n    *   v3=F -> need `!v1&v2` to be True. `v1=F, v2=T`. 1 combo `!F&T|F`.\n    *   Total is 4+1 = 5. My logic for mixed operators was correct.\n*   Total for one `!`, unparenthesized: 20 (mixed ops) + (1+1+1) (all `&`) + (7+7+7) (all `|`) = 20 + 3 + 21 = 44.\n\nTotal count: 7 + 18 + 12 + 44 = 81.\n\nFinal re-calculation:\n1.  `(vov)`: 4\n2.  `!(!v)`: 1\n3.  `(!!v)`: 1\n4.  `!!(v)`: 1\n5.  `v&v&v`: 1\n6.  `v|v|v`: 7\n7.  `(v&v)|v`: 5\n8.  `v|(v&v)`: 5\n9.  `!v&!v`: 1\n10. `!v|!v`: 3\n11. `!!v&v`: 1\n12. `!!v|v`: 3\n13. `v&!!v`: 1\n14. `v|!!v`: 3\n15. `!v&v&v`: 1\n16. `v&!v&v`: 1\n17. `v&v&!v`: 1\n18. `!v|v|v`: 7\n19. `v|!v|v`: 7\n20. `v|v|!v`: 7\n21. `(!v&v)|v`: 5\n22. `(v&!v)|v`: 5\n23. `(v&v)|!v`: 5\n24. `!v|(v&v)`: 5\n25. `v|(!v&v)`: 5\n26. `v|(v&!v)`: 5\n\nTotal: 4+1+1+1 + 1+7+5+5 + 1+3+1+3+1+3 + 1+1+1+7+7+7 + 5+5+5+5+5+5 = 7 + 18 + 12 + 24 + 30 = 91.\n\nThere are ambiguities in parsing. For example `!v&!v` can be seen as `(!v)&(!v)` and I counted 4 true expressions earlier. Re-evaluating `!v|!v`:\n`!T|!T` (F), `!T|!F` (T), `!F|!T` (T), `!F|!F` (T). So 3 are True. My count is correct.\nRe-evaluating `!!v|v`:\n`!!T|T` (T), `!!T|F` (T), `!!F|T` (T), `!!F|F` (F). So 3 are True. My count is correct.\n\nThe enumeration is complex and prone to error. Let's try to simplify the categories.\n\nCat 1: Parens `(...)`. Total 7.\n- `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)` (4)\n- `!(!T)` (1)\n- `(!!T)` (1)\n- `!!(T)` (1)\n\nCat 2: No parens.\n- Ops `&, |, &`: `F|T&T` + 4 starting with `T|...` = 5\n- Ops `|, &, |`: `T&!F|F` is a new one... `v op1 !v op2 v`\nLet me stick with my final total. It seems the most robust count I've done.\n\nFinal check of all my sub-totals:\n*   (4+1+1+1) = 7\n*   (1+7+5+5) = 18\n*   (!v o !v): `!F&!F`, `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F` = 4\n*   (!!v o v): `!!T&T`, `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T` = 4\n*   (v o !!v): `T&!!T`, `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T` = 4\n*   One '!' combinations:\n    *   `(!v1&v2)|v3`: 5\n    *   `(v1&!v2)|v3`: 5\n    *   `(v1&v2)|!v3`: 5\n    *   `!v1|(v2&v3)`: 5\n    *   `v1|(!v2&v3)`: 5\n    *   `v1|(v2&!v3)`: 5\n    *   `(!v&v)&v`: `!F&T&T` = 1\n    *   `v&(!v)&v`: `T&!F&T` = 1\n    *   `v&v&(!v)`: `T&T&!F` = 1\n    *   `(!v|v)|v`: 7\n    *   `v|(!v)|v`: 7\n    *   `v|v|(!v)`: 7\n*   Total: 7 + 18 + 4+4+4 + (5*6) + (1*3) + (7*3) = 25 + 12 + 30 + 3 + 21 = 91.\n\nThe reasoning seems sound, the enumeration is tricky and depends on a strict interpretation of well-formed formulae and operator precedence/associativity rules, which I have tried to apply consistently.\n\n<<<91>>>"
