    "The curve described by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t) is a specific type of curve known as a Lissajous curve. The number of self-intersection points of a Lissajous curve can be determined using a standard formula.\n\nFor a Lissajous curve defined by x(t) = cos(nt) and y(t) = sin(mt), where 'n' and 'm' are integers, the number of self-intersection points depends on the greatest common divisor (GCD) of n and m, as well as their respective parities (whether they are odd or even).\n\nIn this specific case, we have:\n*   n = 9\n*   m = 5\n\nFirst, we determine the greatest common divisor of n and m. Since 9 and 5 are prime to each other, their GCD is 1.\n\nNext, we look at the parity of n and m. Both 9 and 5 are odd integers.\n\nThe formula for the number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve where n and m are coprime and both are odd is given by:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (n - 1)(m - 1) / 2\n\nPlugging in the values for n and m:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\n= (8)(4) / 2\n= 32 / 2\n= 16\n\nTherefore, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
