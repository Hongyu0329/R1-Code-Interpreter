    "I have performed an initial search and have gathered some information about \"order type\" and \"lexicographical order\". The search results confirm that lexicographical order is a generalization of alphabetical order. For finite strings, the comparison is done based on the first differing character. If one string is a prefix of another, the shorter string is usually considered smaller. The set of all finite strings over a finite alphabet is countably infinite.\n\nThe key part of the user's question is to determine the \"order type\" of this set. An order type of a well-ordered set is an ordinal number. The search results provide a discussion on the order type of finite sequences of natural numbers, which is analogous to the set of finite strings over a finite alphabet. One of the search results suggests that the order type is ω^ω (omega to the power of omega). Another result mentions that the set of finite sequences of natural numbers is countably infinite.\n\nTo provide a precise answer, I need to confirm if the lexicographical ordering of finite strings over a finite alphabet results in a well-ordering and to verify the specific ordinal that represents this order type. The provided search results are a good starting point, but a more direct confirmation is needed.I have gathered more information. The search results clarify that there are different types of lexicographical ordering. One type, often called \"shortlex\" or \"radix order,\" orders strings first by length and then lexicographically for strings of the same length. Another type, the pure \"lexicographical order,\" does not prioritize length.\n\nThe key finding is that the set of all finite words under the pure lexicographical order is *not* well-ordered. A counterexample is the sequence {b, ab, aab, aaab, ...}, which is a descending chain with no least element. Since it is not a well-ordered set, its order type cannot be represented by an ordinal number.\n\nHowever, if we consider the \"shortlex\" order (ordering by length first), the set of finite strings *is* well-ordered. The order type for this well-ordering is what needs to be determined. Let's analyze the structure of this \"shortlex\" ordered set.\n\nWe have a finite alphabet of size 4.\n- There is 1 string of length 0 (the empty string).\n- There are 4 strings of length 1.\n- There are 4^2 = 16 strings of length 2.\n- There are 4^n strings of length n.\n\nThe total order is the sum of the sizes of these finite sets: 1 + 4 + 4^2 + 4^3 + ... .  This is a geometric series. In terms of ordinals, this corresponds to the sum ω. However, let's look at the structure more closely.\n\nFor each length n, we have a finite number of strings. The set of all strings is the disjoint union of the sets of strings of length n, for n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nThe order type is the sum of the order types of these disjoint sets. The set of strings of length n has 4^n elements, so its order type is the finite ordinal 4^n. Thus the order type of the set of all finite strings under \"shortlex\" order is the sum of these finite ordinals:\n\n1 + 4 + 4^2 + 4^3 + ...\n\nThis is an infinite sum of ordinals. Let's consider the partial sums:\n- s_0 = 1\n- s_1 = 1 + 4 = 5\n- s_2 = 1 + 4 + 16 = 21\n...\n\nThe limit of this sequence of ordinals is ω.  Let's verify this. Any string `s` has a finite number of predecessors.  The set of all strings is countably infinite. A well-ordering in which every element has a finite number of predecessors is of order type ω.\n\nThe search results from step 1 already provided a hint toward this. One result mentions that for binary strings with this ordering (length first), the order type is ω.\n\nTherefore, the order type of the set of finite strings of characters {a, b, c, d} ordered by length, and then lexicographically, is ω.\n\nHowever, the user's request is about the \"lexical\" or \"lexicographical\" order, and as established, this is not a well-ordering and thus does not have an ordinal order type. The question might be interpreted as \"shortlex\" order, which is a common way to well-order strings. Given the ambiguity, I will provide the answer for both interpretations. But the strict interpretation of \"lexicographically\" leads to the conclusion that it's not well-ordered.\n\nLet's re-read the prompt. \"ordered lexically\". This usually refers to the pure lexicographical order. I will state that it is not a well-ordering and therefore has no order type in the sense of ordinals, but I will also provide the order type if \"shortlex\" order is assumed.\n\nThe search results clearly indicate the distinction. Result states, \"It is not true that the set of all finite words is well-ordered; for example, the infinite set of words {b, ab, aab, aaab, ... } has no lexicographically earliest element.\" This directly answers the question for the standard lexicographical order.\n\nFor the \"shortlex\" (or \"degree-lexicographical\") order, result confirms that the set of all ordered finite tuples over a well-ordered set is well-ordered. In our case, the alphabet {a, b, c, d} is a well-ordered set (any finite total order is a well-order). The strings are finite tuples of characters.  The ordering described in (first by length, then lexicographically) is exactly the \"shortlex\" order.\n\nLet's confirm the order type for the \"shortlex\" ordering. We have a countable set. We can create a bijection with the natural numbers that preserves the order. For any given string, we can count the number of preceding strings: 1 (for the empty string) + 4 (for length 1 strings) + ... + 4^(k-1) (for length k-1 strings) + (the rank of the string among those of its length).  Since for any string, the number of its predecessors is finite, and the set is infinite, this corresponds to the order type ω.\n\nSo, for the strict interpretation of \"lexical order,\" the set is not well-ordered and has no ordinal order type. For the \"shortlex\" interpretation, the order type is ω.  I am now confident I can construct a complete answer.\n\nI will structure the final answer to first address the strict interpretation of \"lexicographical order\" and explain why it's not well-ordered, and then address the common alternative of \"shortlex\" order and provide its order type. This will be the most comprehensive and accurate response.\n\nFinal check of the reasoning:\n1.  Define lexicographical order for finite strings of different lengths. A string `s` is lexicographically smaller than `t` if `s` is a prefix of `t` or at the first differing position, the character in `s` is smaller than the character in `t`.\n2.  Show that with this definition, the set is not well-ordered using the standard counterexample {b, ab, aab, ...}.\n3.  Conclude that since it is not well-ordered, it does not have an order type that is an ordinal.\n4.  Introduce the \"shortlex\" (or \"radix\") order, where strings are first ordered by length.\n5.  Show that this order is a well-ordering. The set of strings of any given length is finite. The union of these countably many finite sets, ordered by length, is a countable set where each element has a finite number of predecessors.\n6.  The order type of a countable, well-ordered set where every element has a finite number of predecessors is ω.\n\nThis reasoning is sound and supported by the search results. I am ready to write the final answer.\nThe order type of a set depends crucially on the specific definition of the ordering. For the set of finite strings of characters from the alphabet $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$, there are two common ways to define a lexicographical-style ordering, leading to different answers.\n\n### Standard Lexicographical Order\n\nIn the standard lexicographical order (or dictionary order), strings are compared character by character from left to right. If one string is a prefix of another, the shorter string comes first. For example, \"a\" comes before \"aa\". With this definition, the set of all finite strings from $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$ is **not a well-ordered set**.\n\nA set is well-ordered if every non-empty subset has a least element. Consider the subset S = {b, ab, aab, aaab, ...}. In this set, \"ab\" comes before \"b\", \"aab\" comes before \"ab\", and so on. This forms an infinite descending chain:\n\n... < \"aaab\" < \"aab\" < \"ab\" < \"b\"\n\nThis infinite descending sequence means that the subset S does not have a least element. Since the set of all finite strings contains a subset without a least element, it is not well-ordered under the standard lexicographical ordering.\n\nThe order type, when expressed as an ordinal number, is only defined for well-ordered sets. Therefore, under the standard lexicographical ordering, the set of finite strings from $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$ does not have an order type that is an ordinal.\n\n### Shortlex Order (or Radix Order)\n\nA common way to create a well-ordering on the set of finite strings is to use the \"shortlex\" or \"radix\" order. In this ordering, strings are first compared by their length, and then strings of the same length are ordered lexicographically.\n\nUsing the shortlex order on the set of strings from $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$ (assuming a < b < c < d), the ordering would begin as follows:\n\n1.  **Length 0:** (the empty string)\n2.  **Length 1:** a, b, c, d\n3.  **Length 2:** aa, ab, ac, ad, ba, bb, bc, bd, ca, cb, cc, cd, da, db, dc, dd\n4.  **And so on...**\n\nThis ordering is a well-ordering. To determine its order type, we can observe the structure of the set. We have a countably infinite set of strings. For any given string, there are only a finite number of strings that come before it in this ordering. A countably infinite well-ordered set where every element has a finite number of predecessors is order-isomorphic to the set of natural numbers, **ℕ**.\n\nThe order type of the natural numbers is denoted by the ordinal number **ω** (omega). Therefore, the order type of the set of finite strings of characters $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$ ordered by length and then lexicographically (shortlex order) is ω.\n\nIn summary:\n\n*   Under **standard lexicographical order**, the set is not well-ordered and thus has no ordinal order type.\n*   Under **shortlex (radix) order**, the set is well-ordered and its order type is **ω**.\n\nGiven that \"ordered lexically\" most commonly refers to the standard definition, the most precise answer is that the set is not well-ordered. However, if a well-ordering is intended, then ω is the answer for the shortlex variant.\n\n<<<The order type of the set of finite strings of characters {a,b,c,d} ordered lexically is not defined by an ordinal number because the set is not well-ordered under the standard lexicographical ordering. However, if the strings are ordered by length first and then lexicographically (shortlex order), the order type is ω.>>>"
