    "To determine the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm, we must analyze the number of operations it performs, particularly within the `while` loop, which is the core of the algorithm.\n\n### Analysis of the Algorithm:\n\n1.  **Initialization (Step 1):** This step involves a few basic arithmetic operations: an assignment, a copy, an integer division (`⌊x/c⌋`), a multiplication (`qc`), and a subtraction. Assuming the numbers `n` and `c` fit within a computer's word size, these are considered constant time, O(1), operations. If `n` is an arbitrarily large number, the complexity of these operations depends on the number of bits in `n`, which is proportional to `log(n)`.\n\n2.  **The `while` loop (Step 2):** The loop continues as long as the quotient `q` is greater than 0. Let's trace how `q` changes:\n    *   Before the loop: `q = ⌊n/c⌋`\n    *   After the 1st iteration: `q = ⌊(n/c)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`\n    *   After the 2nd iteration: `q = ⌊(n/c²)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c³⌋`\n    *   After `k` iterations: `q = ⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`\n\n    The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0, which happens when `c^(k+1) > n`. By taking the logarithm to the base `c`, we find that the number of iterations `k+1` is proportional to `log_c(n)`. Therefore, the loop runs approximately `log_c(n)` times.\n\n3.  **Operations inside the loop (Step 2.1):** Each iteration consists of an increment, an assignment, an integer division, a multiplication, and a subtraction. Similar to the initialization step, under a typical RAM model where `n` fits in a machine word, these are O(1) operations.\n\n### Computational Complexity:\n\nThe total time complexity is the number of loop iterations multiplied by the cost of the operations inside the loop.\n\n*   **Number of iterations:** `O(log_c(n))`\n*   **Cost per iteration (assuming standard integer sizes):** `O(1)`\n\nTherefore, the total time complexity is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\nBy the change of base rule for logarithms (`log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`), and since `c` is a constant greater than or equal to 2, `log(c)` is also a constant. In Big O notation, constant factors are omitted, so `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\nIf we consider the case of arbitrarily large integers (bignum arithmetic), where the cost of division and multiplication is not constant, the complexity is higher. The cost of dividing an `m`-bit number by a small constant is `O(m)`. Since the number of bits in `n` is `m ≈ log(n)`, and the loop runs `log_c(n)` times, the complexity would be `O((log n)²)`. More advanced algorithms for base conversion exist with complexity `O(M(log n) * log(log n))`, where `M(k)` is the time for a `k`-bit multiplication.\n\nHowever, for a standard analysis in an introductory algorithms context, arithmetic operations are assumed to be `O(1)`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
