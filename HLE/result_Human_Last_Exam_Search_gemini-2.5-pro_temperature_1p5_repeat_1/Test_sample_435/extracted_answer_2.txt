Manufacturing CAR T cells with interleukin-15 is predicted to result in a potent pro-inflammatory and effector cytokine release (including IFN-γ and TNF-α) upon target antigen engagement, contributing to robust anti-tumor activity. However, due to the promotion of a less differentiated, memory-like T cell phenotype, the cytokine storm associated with severe Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) may be mitigated compared to CAR T cells manufactured with IL-2, potentially offering a more favorable safety profile.
