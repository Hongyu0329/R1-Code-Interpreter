    "To find the number of stable equilibria, denoted by $m$, for the differential equation $x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$, we first need to find the equilibrium points. Equilibrium points are constant solutions to the differential equation, which occur when $x'(t) = 0$.\n\nWe set the right-hand side of the equation to zero and solve for $x$:\n$$-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0$$\n\nFactoring out $-x$ from the expression gives:\n$$-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$$\n\nThe quadratic term in the parentheses is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So, the equation becomes:\n$$-x(x - 1)^2 = 0$$\n\nThe equilibrium points are the values of $x$ that satisfy this equation, which are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the stability of these equilibrium points. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. The stability can be determined by examining the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, denoted as $f'(x)$, at each equilibrium point.\n\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n$$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$$\n\nAccording to the stability theorem, if $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable, and if $f'(x^*) > 0$, it is unstable.\n\nFor the equilibrium point $x = 0$:\n$$f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$$\nSince $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point at $x = 0$ is stable.\n\nFor the equilibrium point $x = 1$:\n$$f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$$\nSince $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must analyze the sign of $f(x)$ around $x=1$. An equilibrium is considered stable if solutions that start near it are attracted to it.\n\nLet's examine the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$:\n*   For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x=1.1$), $f(x)$ is negative. This means that to the right of $x=1$, the solutions decrease and move towards 1.\n*   For $x$ between 0 and 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$), $f(x)$ is also negative. This means that to the left of $x=1$, the solutions decrease and move away from 1.\n\nAn equilibrium point is classified as semi-stable if solutions on one side approach it, while on the other side, they move away. In this case, $x=1$ is a semi-stable equilibrium point. Semi-stable equilibria are considered unstable.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$. This means the number of stable equilibria is $m=1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$. Substituting the value of $m=1$, we get:\n$$1 - 2^{4048}$$\n\n<<<1 - 2^4048>>>"
