    "## Battle of Huj in 1917 is the Latest Conflict Depicted in a Lady Butler Painting\n\nThe latest historical battle depicted in a painting by the renowned British military artist Lady Butler is the Battle of Huj, which took place on November 8, 1917, during the First World War. Her watercolour painting, titled *The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj*, immortalizes a cavalry charge by British forces against Ottoman and German positions in Palestine.\n\nLady Butler, born Elizabeth Thompson, was famous for her detailed and emotive portrayals of British military engagements. While many of her celebrated works depict 19th-century conflicts, she continued to paint scenes from contemporary wars throughout her career.\n\nA chronological look at some of her other notable battle paintings reveals that the Battle of Huj is indeed the latest:\n\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras***: Depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras, which occurred on June 16, 1815, during the Napoleonic Wars.\n*   ***Scotland Forever!***: Portrays the charge of the Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815.\n*   ***Remnants of an Army***: Shows the arrival of army surgeon William Brydon at Jalalabad in January 1842, a survivor of the retreat from Kabul during the First Anglo-Afghan War.\n*   ***The Roll Call***: This painting, which brought her widespread fame, depicts a scene from the Crimean War (1853-1856).\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift***: Illustrates the battle at the Rorke's Drift mission station on January 22-23, 1879, during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!***: Features an incident at the Battle of Laing's Nek on January 28, 1881, during the First Boer War.\n\nLady Butler also created other works related to the First World War, including a painting of the Royal Horse Guards retreating from Mons in August 1914 and a watercolour of the London Irish Rifles at the Battle of Loos in September 1915. However, her depiction of the Charge at Huj in November 1917 remains the latest known historical battle she painted.\n\n<<<The Battle of Huj"
