    "Answering the question of determining \\(av_n^k(\\pi)\\), the number of permutations of length *n* with *k* inversions that avoid a pattern \\(\\pi\\), often involves complex combinatorial analysis. In this specific case, for the pattern \\(\\pi = 1324\\), the length of the permutation \\(n = 333\\), and the number of inversions \\(k = 3\\), the problem can be simplified by considering the behavior of permutations for large *n*.\n\nA key insight is that for a sufficiently large *n*, the set of permutations that avoid the pattern 1324 is equivalent to the set of permutations that avoid the pattern 132. This is because any permutation containing a 132 pattern can be shown to contain a 1324 pattern if the length of the permutation is large enough.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n1.  **Any 1324-avoider is also a 132-avoider:** This statement is incorrect. However, a permutation containing a 1324 pattern—a subsequence of values with relative order `acbd` at indices `i < j < k < l`—also contains a 132 pattern (`a`, `b`, `c`) at indices `i < k < j`. No, this reasoning is flawed because the indices for the 132 pattern must be in increasing order. Let's re-examine this. A permutation \\(\\sigma\\) has a 1324 pattern if there exist indices \\(i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < i_4\\) such that \\(\\sigma(i_1) < \\sigma(i_3) < \\sigma(i_2) < \\sigma(i_4)\\). This implies that the subsequence formed by \\(\\sigma(i_1), \\sigma(i_2), \\sigma(i_3)\\) is a 132 pattern. Therefore, any permutation that contains a 1324 pattern must also contain a 132 pattern. Consequently, the set of 132-avoiding permutations is a subset of the set of 1324-avoiding permutations.\n\n2.  **For large n, any 132-avoider is also a 1324-avoider:** Let's assume a permutation \\(\\sigma\\) has a 132 pattern but avoids 1324. The 132 pattern is formed by elements at indices `a < b < c` such that \\(\\sigma(a) < \\sigma(c) < \\sigma(b)\\). For \\(\\sigma\\) to form a 1324 pattern, there would need to be an element at an index `d > c` where \\(\\sigma(d) > \\sigma(b)\\).\n\n3.  **The effect of a small number of inversions:** A permutation with a small number of inversions, such as k=3, has a structure where most elements are not far from their natural sorted position. The elements involved in inversions (displaced points) are limited. The set of displaced points and values has a size of at most 2*k. For k=3, this is at most 6. For a permutation of length 333, any element greater than 6 is likely a fixed point (i.e., \\(\\sigma(i) = i\\)).\n\nIf a permutation of length n > 2k has a 132 pattern, the elements \\(\\sigma(a), \\sigma(b), \\sigma(c)\\) must be among the first 2k values. We can find an index `d > c` such that `d > 2k`, which will be a fixed point (\\(\\sigma(d)=d\\)). This value `d` will be greater than \\(\\sigma(b)\\), thus forming a 1324 pattern. Therefore, for n > 2k, a permutation avoids 1324 if and only if it avoids 132.\n\nGiven n=333 and k=3, we have n > 2k (333 > 6). Thus, we need to find the number of 132-avoiding permutations of length 333 with 3 inversions.\n\nThis value is given by a known formula for n ≥ 2k-1. The number of 132-avoiding permutations with k inversions is the sum of the number of partitions of *k* and *k-1*.\n*   The number of partitions of k=3, denoted p(3), is 3. The partitions are (3), (2,1), and (1,1,1).\n*   The number of partitions of k-1=2, denoted p(2), is 2. The partitions are (2) and (1,1).\n\nSo, the number of such permutations is p(3) + p(2) = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
