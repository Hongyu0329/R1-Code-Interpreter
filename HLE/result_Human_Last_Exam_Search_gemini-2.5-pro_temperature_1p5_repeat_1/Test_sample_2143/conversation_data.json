    "The individual referred to is Jacques Lacan. Veronika Campan's interpretation points to his work, *Seminar XVII: The Other Side of Psychoanalysis*.\n\nLacan's analysis in this seminar, particularly in its conclusion, delves into concepts that align with the provided description:\n\n*   **Another's material possessions:** Lacan examines the discourse of capitalism, where the pursuit of objects and surplus enjoyment (*plus-de-jouir*) is central. This relates to the theme of coveting material goods.\n*   **Prohibition against representation:** A fundamental concept in Lacan's work is that the subject can never be fully represented in language or by a signifier. His concept of *objet a*, the cause of desire, is that which is left over and escapes representation.\n\nAt the end of *Seminar XVII*, Lacan connects these ideas, discussing how modern society, through capitalism, deals with this lack of representation by promoting the endless accumulation of objects to attain a \"surplus enjoyment\". He thus addresses the dynamic of desiring another's possessions by analyzing a system that functions around the very impossibility of complete representation.\n\n<<<Jacques Lacan>>>"
