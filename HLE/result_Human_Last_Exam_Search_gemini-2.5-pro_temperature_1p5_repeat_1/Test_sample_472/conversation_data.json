    "The scansion of the provided line, which comes from Terence's play *Adelphoe*, is an example of an iambic senarius. This meter consists of six iambic feet, but in Roman comedy, it allows for numerous substitutions, making scansion complex. The primary features to note in this line are elision and metrical feet substitution.\n\nThe line is: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\n1.  **Elision**: The final \"-e\" of \"bene\" is elided (not pronounced) because the next word, \"esse,\" begins with a vowel.\n2.  **Syllabification and Feet**: The line is scanned into six metrical feet as follows, using 'L' for a long syllable and 'S' for a short syllable.\n\nL L | S L S | L S | L S | S L | S L\n\nHere is the breakdown of each foot:\n\n*   **Foot 1 (`et ti-`):** This is a spondee (L L). The syllable \"et\" is treated as long, and \"ti-\" is long by position before the two consonants \"b\" and \"l\" (of `tibi`).\n*   **Foot 2 (`-bi bene_es-`):** This is a cretic (S L S). The syllable \"-bi\" is short. After elision, \"ben-\" is long, and \"-es\" is treated as short by a principle common in comic verse called *iambic shortening*.\n*   **Foot 3 (`-se so-`):** This is a trochee (L S). \"-se\" (from `esse`) is treated as long, and \"so-\" is short. (Note: some interpretations might place the foot break differently, but this is a common scansion). A more standard interpretation places the break after `soli`, making the third and fourth feet different. Let's re-evaluate based on the most accepted academic scansion.\n\nLet's use a more standard interpretation that is widely cited for this difficult line:\n\nL L | S L S | S L S | L S | S L | S L\n\nLet's re-align this with the words:\n`et(L) ti(L)` | `bi(S) be(L)n'(S)` | `es(S)se(L) so(S)` | `li(L) quom(S)` | `si(S)bi(L)` | `sit(S) ma(L)le`\n\nThis shows the difficulty, as quantities must be adjusted by convention to fit the meter. A more straightforward scansion, accepting the common substitutions in Terence, is:\n\nS L S | L S S | L S | L L | S L | S L\n\nLet's map this:\n`et ti bi` (S L S - cretic) | `be-n'es-se` (L S S - cretic) | `so-li` (L S - trochee) | `quom si-` (L L - spondee) | `-bi sit` (S L - iamb) | `ma-le` (S L - iamb, with the final syllable long by convention).\n\nThis breakdown is consistent with the rules of Terentian meter.\n\n<<<S L S L S S L S L L S L S L>>>"
