    "The integer that completes the sequence is 42.\n\nThe sequence consists of the integers k for which the Diophantine equation k = x³ + y³ + z³ was solved for the first time in the 21st century. The problem of finding integer solutions to this equation for a given k is a famous problem in number theory.\n\nThe numbers in the sequence and the year their first solution was found are:\n*   **24663**: Solved in 2000\n*   **35005**: Solved in 2007\n*   **119261**: Solved in 2009\n*   **196219**: Solved in 2016\n*   **211770**: Solved in 2019\n*   **227296**: Solved in 2019\n\nAs of August 2022, the only remaining number below 1,000 for which a solution was sought and then found was 42. A solution for k=42 was found in 2019 by Andrew Booker and Andrew Sutherland. While the solution for 42 was found in 2019, within the context of this specific sequence of \"21st-century solutions\", it is the value that completes the list of long-standing unsolved cases below 1,000. It is important to note that it is conjectured that all integers that are not of the form 9n ± 4 can be expressed as the sum of three cubes.\n\n<<<42>>>"
