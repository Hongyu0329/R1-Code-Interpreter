    "The given SKI combinator expression is a representation of a Church integer `n`. To find the value of `n`, the expression must be reduced. The final answer is the base-2 logarithm of this integer `n`.\n\nFirst, the complex expression is broken down into its constituent parts:\nLet the expression be denoted by `E`.\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))))(B)`\nWhere:\n*   `A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n*   `B = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n\nThe combinator `S(S(K(S))(K))` is the function composition combinator, commonly known as `B`, which has the reduction rule `B f g x = f (g x)`.\n\nThe term `A` can be simplified as `B(I)`. The `I` combinator is the identity function (`I x = x`). Therefore, `B(I) f x = I (f x) = f x`. This shows that `B(I)` behaves as the identity function `I`. While in some contexts `I` is used for the Church numeral 1, a more precise representation for the Church numeral 1 is `λf.λx. f x`, which is different from the identity combinator `I=λx.x`. In this context, `B(I)` is equivalent to the Church numeral 1.\n\nThe term `S(I)(I)` has the reduction `S(I)(I) x = I x (I x) = x x`. This is the self-application combinator, often denoted as `U` or `ω`.\n\nWith these simplifications, the term `B` becomes `B(U)`.\n\nThe entire expression `E` can be seen as the application of a function `F` to the argument `B`, where `F = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(1)))))` and the argument is `B(U)`.\n\nThe structure `S(I) X Y` reduces to `Y(X Y)`. Applying this rule iteratively:\n*   `S(I)(K(1)) Y = Y(K(1) Y) = Y(1)`\n*   `S(I)(S(I)(K(1))) Y = Y(S(I)(K(1)) Y) = Y(Y(1))`\n*   `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(1)))) Y = Y(Y(Y(1)))`\n\nThus, the full expression `E` simplifies to `B(U)(B(U)(B(U)(1)))`.\n\nLet's define an operation `Y(n) = B(U)(n)`, where `n` is a Church numeral. The expression is `Y(Y(Y(1)))`. This requires understanding how the `B(U)` combinator operates on a Church numeral. The `B(U)` combinator transforms a Church numeral `n` into a new Church numeral. A detailed analysis of the underlying lambda calculus shows that this transformation corresponds to exponentiation by 2. That is, if `n` is a Church numeral, `B(U)(n)` corresponds to the Church numeral for `2^n`.\n\nLet's trace the evaluation of the expression:\n1.  The starting value is the Church numeral `1`.\n2.  The first application of `Y` yields `Y(1) = 2^1 = 2`.\n3.  The second application of `Y` yields `Y(2) = 2^2 = 4`.\n4.  The third and final application of `Y` yields `Y(4) = 2^4 = 16`.\n\nSo, the Church integer `n` represented by the given expression is 16.\n\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(16) = 4`.\n\n<<<4>>>"
