    "There are four distinct homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA complete classification of these topological spaces shows that any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to one of the following three: the circle, the pseudo-arc, or the circle of pseudo-arcs. The point is the only degenerate homogeneous planar continuum.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, a classification scheme for homogeneous plane continua was developed, dividing them into those that do not separate the plane and those that do. The non-separating, and therefore indecomposable, continua were shown to be hereditarily indecomposable. The separating and decomposable continua were described as a \"circle\" of non-separating continua. It was also proven that there are no separating and indecomposable homogeneous planar continua.\n\nThe known examples fitting this classification are:\n*   **The point:** A degenerate continuum (a single point).\n*   **The circle:** A simple closed curve.\n*   **The pseudo-arc:** A hereditarily indecomposable, chainable continuum.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** A continuum formed by a \"circle\" of pseudo-arcs.\n\nIn 2016, a proof was published that this list is complete, thus establishing that there are only these four homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
