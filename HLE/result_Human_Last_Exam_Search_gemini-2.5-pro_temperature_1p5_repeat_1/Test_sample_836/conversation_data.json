    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor** in the nuclear criticality community. It is often denoted as *S(q,ω)* or in a dimensionless form as *S(α,β)*.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, also known as the Van Hove correlation function *G(r,t)*, describes the probability of finding a particle at a position **r** at time *t*, given that another particle (or the same particle) was at the origin at *t*=0. Its double Fourier transform with respect to space (r) and time (t) yields the dynamic structure factor, which is a crucial quantity in neutron scattering and transport calculations.\n\nThe dynamic structure factor provides information about the collective motions and correlations within the scattering medium. In the context of nuclear criticality safety, the thermal scattering law, which is directly related to the dynamic structure factor, is used to accurately model the interaction of thermal neutrons with moderating and scattering materials. This information is essential for calculating the effective multiplication factor (k-eff) and ensuring the safety of nuclear systems.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
