    "The rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is 0.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n1.  **Identify the nature of X**: A smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in complex projective 3-space, $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, is a 2-dimensional complex manifold, which is a 4-dimensional real manifold.\n\n2.  **Determine the First Homotopy and Homology Groups**: The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem states that for a smooth complex hypersurface $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^n$, the inclusion map induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n)$ for $k < n-1$. In this case, $n=3$, so the isomorphism holds for $k<2$. This means $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$), it follows that $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. Because the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of $\\pi_1(X)$, it is also zero.\n\n3.  **Relate the Third Homotopy Group to Homology**: For a simply-connected complex surface like $X$, there exists an isomorphism between the third homotopy group and the third homology group: $\\pi_3(X) \\cong H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. This can be shown using the Postnikov tower of $X$ and the Serre spectral sequence.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Third Homology Group**: By PoincarÃ© duality for a compact, orientable 4-manifold like $X$, the third Betti number $b_3(X)$ is equal to the first Betti number $b_1(X)$. As established in step 2, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, which means $b_1(X) = 0$. Therefore, $b_3(X) = 0$. This implies that the free part of the homology group $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is trivial. It can be further shown that this group has no torsion, so $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Since $\\pi_3(X) \\cong H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ and $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$, the group $\\pi_3(X)$ must be the trivial group. The rank of a trivial group is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
