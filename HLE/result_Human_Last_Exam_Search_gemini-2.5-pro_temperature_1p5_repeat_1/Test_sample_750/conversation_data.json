    "To solve the equation $z\\cdot i = i^z$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, we first need to understand the term $i^z$. The expression $a^b$ for complex numbers $a, b$ is defined as $e^{b \\log(a)}$. The logarithm of a complex number is multi-valued. The possible values for $\\log(i)$ are given by:\n$\\log(i) = \\ln|i| + i(\\arg(i) + 2k\\pi) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet's denote $\\alpha_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. So, for each integer $k$, the equation becomes:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{z \\log(i)} = e^{z \\cdot i\\alpha_k}$\n$zi = e^{iz\\alpha_k}$\n\nTo solve for $z$, let's introduce a substitution. Let $w = iz$. Then the equation becomes:\n$w = e^{w\\alpha_k}$\n\nThis equation can be rewritten to match the form required for the Lambert W function. The Lambert W function, denoted as $W(x)$, is defined as the function that satisfies $W(x)e^{W(x)} = x$.\n\nFrom $w = e^{w\\alpha_k}$, we can write:\n$w e^{-w\\alpha_k} = 1$\nMultiply both sides by $-\\alpha_k$:\n$-w\\alpha_k e^{-w\\alpha_k} = -\\alpha_k$\n\nLet $u = -w\\alpha_k$. The equation becomes:\n$u e^u = -\\alpha_k$\n\nBy the definition of the Lambert W function, the solution for $u$ is:\n$u = W(-\\alpha_k)$\nSince the Lambert W function is multi-valued for arguments other than 0, we denote its different branches by $W_j$ where $j$ is an integer. So, we have a set of solutions for $u$:\n$u_j = W_j(-\\alpha_k)$ for $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow, we substitute back to find $w$ and then $z$.\nSince $u_j = -w_j\\alpha_k$, we have:\n$w_j = -\\frac{u_j}{\\alpha_k} = -\\frac{W_j(-\\alpha_k)}{\\alpha_k}$\n\nAnd since $w_j = iz_j$, we have:\n$z_j = \\frac{w_j}{i} = -iw_j = -i \\left( -\\frac{W_j(-\\alpha_k)}{\\alpha_k} \\right) = \\frac{i W_j(-\\alpha_k)}{\\alpha_k}$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\alpha_k$:\n$z_{k,j} = \\frac{i \\cdot W_j\\left(-\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)\\right)}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$\n\nThis formula gives all complex solutions for $z$, where $k$ and $j$ are any integers. This accounts for all branches of the logarithm of $i$ (indexed by $k$) and all solution branches for the resulting exponential equation (indexed by $j$).\n\nThis general formula includes several types of solutions:\n\n1.  **Integer solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$**:\n    *   For $z=1$, we have $1 \\cdot i = i^1 \\implies i=i$. This is always true, provided the principal value of $i^1$ is taken, which corresponds to $k=0$ in the definition of $\\log(i)$. More generally, $i^1 = e^{\\log(i)} = e^{i(\\pi/2+2k\\pi)} = i$. So $z=1$ is a solution for any choice of $k$.\n    *   For $z=-1$, we have $-1 \\cdot i = i^{-1} \\implies -i = \\frac{1}{i} \\implies -i=-i$. This is also always true. So $z=-1$ is a solution for any choice of $k$.\n    These solutions are contained within the general formula.\n\n2.  **Purely imaginary solutions**:\n    Let $z=iy$ for some real number $y$. The original equation becomes $(iy)i = i^{iy}$, which simplifies to $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}$. By analysis using the Lambert W function, this equation has real solutions for $y$ only when $\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi \\le 1/e$. This condition implies $k \\le -1$. For each integer $k \\le -1$, there is one purely imaginary solution given by the $j=0$ (principal) branch of the Lambert W function:\n    $z_k = i y_k = \\frac{i W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi}$. For $k=-1$, this gives the solution $z = -i\\frac{W_0(3\\pi/2)}{3\\pi/2} \\approx -0.2798i$.\n\n3.  **Other complex solutions**:\n    For any other pair of integers $(k,j)$, where the solution is not one of the special cases above, we get a complex solution. For instance, for $k=0$ and $j=0$ (the principal branches for both the logarithm and the W function):\n    $z_{0,0} = \\frac{i W_0(-\\pi/2)}{\\pi/2} \\approx \\frac{i(0.2396 - 1.3372i)}{1.5708} \\approx \\frac{1.3372 + 0.2396i}{1.5708} \\approx 0.8513 + 0.1525i$.\n\nThe complete set of solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is given by the formula:\n$z_{k,j} = \\frac{i \\cdot W_j\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1 + 4k)\\right)}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1 + 4k)}$ for all integers $k,j$.\n\n<<<The set of all solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is given by $z_{k,j} = \\frac{i \\cdot W_j\\left(-\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)\\right)}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$, where $k$ and $j$ are any integers, and $W_j$ denotes the $j$-th branch of the Lambert W function.>>>"
