    "This is a classic riddle well-known in Russian intellectual circles, often associated with the trivia game show \"Что? Где? Когда?\" (\"What? Where? When?\"). The key to solving it lies in a multilingual pun.\n\nThe boulevards of Vienna are often described as grand, lively, and cheerful. The English word for this cheerful liveliness is \"gay\" (in its historical sense). A Russian translator describing these boulevards and being familiar with English literature might be reminded of the 18th-century English poet and dramatist, John Gay.\n\nJohn Gay is most famous for his satirical ballad opera, \"The Beggar's Opera\" (1728). His own self-penned epitaph, located in Westminster Abbey, reads: \"Life is a jest; and all things show it / I thought so once; but now I know it.\" This sense of wit and liveliness connects to the \"gay\" atmosphere of the Viennese boulevards, creating the basis for the riddle.\n\n<<<Gay>>>"
