The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is:

**Z = ∫ D[ψ*]D[ψ] exp(-S_E[ψ*, ψ])**

Here's a breakdown of each component:

*   **∫ D[ψ*]D[ψ]** represents the **functional integral** over all possible configurations of the Grassmann fields ψ*(**x**, τ) and ψ(**x**, τ) throughout spacetime.

*   **ψ(**x**, τ) and ψ\***(**x**, τ)** are the **fermionic fields**, which are functions of spatial coordinates **x** and imaginary time τ. To correctly account for fermionic statistics, they are treated as Grassmann numbers, which satisfy the anti-commutation relation {ψₐ, ψᵦ} = ψₐψᵦ + ψᵦψₐ = 0.

*   **S_E[ψ*, ψ]** is the **Euclidean action** for the fermionic fields. It is obtained from the standard (Minkowskian) action by a Wick rotation (t → -iτ). For a typical non-relativistic fermionic system described by a Hamiltonian H, the Euclidean action takes the form:

    **S_E[ψ*, ψ] = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx ψ\***(**x**, τ) [∂_τ + H(ψ\*, ψ)] ψ(**x**, τ)

    where dᵈx is the spatial volume element.

*   A crucial feature for fermions is the imposition of **anti-periodic boundary conditions** (APBC) in the imaginary time direction. The trace in the definition of the partition function translates to integrating over fields that are anti-periodic over the interval [0, β]:

    **ψ(**x**, β) = -ψ(**x**, 0)**
    **ψ\***(**x**, β) = -ψ\***(**x**, 0)**

    This is a direct consequence of the fermionic nature of the particles and is a key difference from the periodic boundary conditions used for bosons. The functional integral measure ∫ D[ψ*]D[ψ] implicitly assumes integration over fields satisfying these boundary conditions.

For a non-interacting system, the Hamiltonian is quadratic in the fields, and the path integral becomes a Gaussian integral over Grassmann variables. The result is the determinant of the operator in the action, leading to the well-known formula for the partition function of a free Fermi gas. For interacting systems, this path integral serves as the starting point for various approximation schemes, such as perturbation theory (Feynman diagrams) and numerical methods like Quantum Monte Carlo.
