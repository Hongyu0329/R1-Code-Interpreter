    "The number of negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48 is 534. This result is based on the comprehensive work by Mark Watkins on the classification of imaginary quadratic fields.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, in its essence, seeks to provide a complete list of imaginary quadratic fields for any given class number. A fundamental discriminant is a key integer that characterizes a quadratic number field. For each class number *n*, there is a finite number of corresponding negative fundamental discriminants.\n\nThe work of Mark Watkins, detailed in his paper \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields,\" provides a complete list of these counts for class numbers up to 100. A table derived from his research, available through the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A046125, lists the number of negative fundamental discriminants for each class number. For a class number of 48, this table explicitly states the number of such discriminants.\n\n<<<534>>>"
