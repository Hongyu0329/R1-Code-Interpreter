    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we first need to determine the value of this number. The generalized Markov numbers, in the context of the Lagrange and Markov spectra, are associated with rational numbers. For a given rational number \\( p/q \\), the corresponding number in the Lagrange spectrum, often denoted as \\( \\mu(p/q) \\) or \\( L_{p/q} \\), can be considered the generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\).\n\nThe value of \\( m_{p/q} \\) is determined by the continued fraction of \\( p/q \\). Let the simple continued fraction of \\( p/q \\) be given by \\( [0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n] \\). The value of \\( m_{p/q} \\) is then the maximum of the following set of numbers:\n\\( \\{ [a_k; a_{k+1}, \\dots, a_n] + [0; a_{k-1}, \\dots, a_1] \\mid k=1, 2, \\dots, n \\} \\)\n\nFirst, we find the continued fraction expansion of \\( 4/7 \\):\n*   \\( \\frac{4}{7} = 0 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{4}} \\)\n*   \\( \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{3}} \\)\n*   \\( \\frac{4}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n*   \\( 3 = 3 \\)\n\nThus, the continued fraction for \\( 4/7 \\) is \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\). We have \\( a_1 = 1 \\), \\( a_2 = 1 \\), and \\( a_3 = 3 \\).\n\nNow, we compute the values for each \\( k \\):\n*   For \\( k=1 \\): \\( [a_1; a_2, a_3] + [0;] = [1; 1, 3] + 0 = 1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}} = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{3}} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{7}{4} \\)\n*   For \\( k=2 \\): \\( [a_2; a_3] + [0; a_1] = [1; 3] + [0; 1] = (1 + \\frac{1}{3}) + \\frac{1}{1} = \\frac{4}{3} + 1 = \\frac{7}{3} \\)\n*   For \\( k=3 \\): \\( [a_3] + [0; a_2, a_1] = + [0; 1, 1] = 3 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1}} = 3 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2} \\)\n\nThe generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is the maximum of these values: \\( \\max(\\frac{7}{4}, \\frac{7}{3}, \\frac{7}{2}) = \\frac{7}{2} \\).\n\nFinally, we compute the continued fraction associated with \\( \\frac{7}{2} \\):\n*   \\( \\frac{7}{2} = 3 + \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nThe continued fraction for \\( \\frac{7}{2} \\) is \\( [3; 2] \\).\n\n<<<[3; 2]>>>"
