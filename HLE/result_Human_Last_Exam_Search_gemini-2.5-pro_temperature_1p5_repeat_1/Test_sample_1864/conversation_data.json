    "For a flow cytometry sorting experiment with five detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750) using Streptavidin beads, you should prepare a minimum of 12 essential controls for proper setup and analysis. These controls are crucial for accurate data interpretation, correct compensation of spectral overlap, and precise gating.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls:\n\n*   **Unstained Control (1 tube):** This sample contains your cells and the streptavidin beads without any fluorescent labels. It is used to determine the baseline autofluorescence and light scatter properties of your cells and beads.\n*   **Viability Control (1 tube):** To ensure you are sorting only live cells, a viability dye is essential. Dead cells can non-specifically bind antibodies and exhibit increased autofluorescence, leading to false positives. This control contains cells stained only with the viability dye.\n*   **Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 tubes):** These are critical for correcting spectral overlap, where the fluorescence of one dye spills into the detector for another. You need a separate control for each of the five fluorochromes used in your panel. These can be prepared using either cells or compensation beads. The five controls are:\n    *   AF350 only\n    *   GFP only\n    *   PE only\n    *   AF647 only\n    *   AF750 only\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 tubes):** FMO controls are essential in multicolor experiments for accurately setting the gates to distinguish between positive and negative populations. An FMO control is a sample stained with all the fluorochromes in your panel except for one. You will need an FMO control for each of the five channels:\n    *   All stains except AF350\n    *   All stains except GFP\n    *   All stains except PE\n    *   All stains except AF647\n    *   All stains except AF750\n\nIn addition to these essential setup controls, it is also highly recommended to include:\n\n*   **Biological Controls (at least 2 tubes):** These include a positive control (cells known to express the target antigen) and a negative control (cells known not to express the antigen) to validate the specificity of your staining.\n\nWhile biological controls are scientifically crucial for validating your results, the 12 controls listed above are the essential minimum required to properly set up the flow cytometer and analyze the data from your five-color sorting experiment.\n\n<<<12>>>"
