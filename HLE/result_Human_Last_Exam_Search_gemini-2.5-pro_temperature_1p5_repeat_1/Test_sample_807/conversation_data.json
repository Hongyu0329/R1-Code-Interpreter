    "The chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is commonly known as Rhodamine B. This substance is a fluorescent dye that typically appears as a green powder but turns a vibrant, fluorescent pink-to-red color when dissolved.\n\nWhile Crayola's exact formulations are proprietary, evidence points to the use of this dye. A trade document for Crayola LLC shows a shipment that included \"RHODAMINE B - Bột màu hữu cơ tổng hợp,\" which translates to \"Rhodamine B - Synthetic organic powder color\". Rhodamine B is also referred to as Basic Violet 10.\n\nConsidering that Rhodamine B creates a bright, fluorescent pink or reddish-violet hue, it is used in crayons that are a shade of fluorescent pink or violet. Among the various names for Rhodamine B are Brilliant Pink B and Basic Violet 10. A mixture of Rhodamine B with another pigment is also used to create the bright pink watercolor known as Opera Rose. Given the wide array of Crayola crayon colors, which includes shades like \"Shocking Pink,\" \"Razzle Dazzle Rose,\" and \"Vivid Violet,\" the dye is likely used in one of their vividly colored crayons. A study on children's play materials detected Rhodamine B in pink-colored playdough and finger paint.\n\n<<<fluorescent pink or violet>>>"
