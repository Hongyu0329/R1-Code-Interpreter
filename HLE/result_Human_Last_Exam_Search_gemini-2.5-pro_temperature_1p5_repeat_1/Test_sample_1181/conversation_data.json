    "In the 1972 Andrei Tarkovsky film *Solaris*, the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves on Earth is Dr. Gibarian.\n\nIt is revealed in the film that the deceased Dr. Gibarian was the one who originally devised a method to simulate the sound of rustling leaves by taping strips of paper to an air vent. This indicates his deep longing for the sounds of Earth. Another character, Snaut, explains that both he and the cynical Dr. Sartorius have adopted this practice. Later, it is said of Gibarian that he \"didn't die of fear. He died of shame.\" The juxtaposition of his invention to cope with homesickness and his death from shame strongly implies he was ashamed of this profound attachment to Earth and his inability to adapt to the alien environment of Solaris.\n\nWhile Snaut is the one who vocalizes the desire for the sound of leaves to the protagonist Kris, the film attributes both the invention and the feeling of shame to Gibarian. Kris Kelvin does speak about shame, but in a much broader, philosophical context, stating, \"Shame is the feeling that will save mankind\". This is separate from the specific shame of missing earthly sounds.\n\n<<<E>>>"
