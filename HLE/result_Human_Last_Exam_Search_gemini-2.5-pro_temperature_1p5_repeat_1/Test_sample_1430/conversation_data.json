    "The rank of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface C depends on two key factors: the structure of the Jacobian variety of C and whether C is hyperelliptic or non-hyperelliptic. The smallest and largest possible ranks are determined by analyzing the extreme cases for these factors.\n\n### Neron-Severi Rank Formulas\n\nLet `C` be a smooth projective curve of genus `g`, and let `X = S^k(C)` be its k-th symmetric power. The rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, denoted `ρ(X)`, is given by different formulas depending on whether C is hyperelliptic. For a curve of genus `g=3` and `k=15`, the condition `k >= 2g-2` (i.e., `15 >= 4`) is satisfied, and the formulas are:\n\n*   **If C is non-hyperelliptic** (a smooth plane quartic curve):\n    `ρ(S^{15}(C)) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1`\n*   **If C is hyperelliptic**:\n    `ρ(S^{15}(C)) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1 + [15/2] = ρ(Jac(C)) + 8`\n\nHere, `ρ(Jac(C))` is the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of C. This value depends on the endomorphism ring of the Jacobian.\n\n### Possible Ranks of the Jacobian's Néron-Severi Group\n\nThe rank `ρ(Jac(C))` for a genus 3 curve C can vary:\n*   **Minimum Rank**: For a *generic* curve C, whether hyperelliptic or not, its Jacobian `Jac(C)` has no complex multiplication, and its endomorphism ring is simply the integers. In this case, the Néron-Severi group is generated by the class of the theta divisor, and its rank is `ρ(Jac(C)) = 1`.\n*   **Maximum Rank**: The maximum rank is achieved for curves whose Jacobian has complex multiplication (CM). For a genus 3 curve, the Jacobian can be isogenous to the product of three CM elliptic curves (`E^3`). In this situation, for the principal polarization that comes from a Jacobian, the rank of the Néron-Severi group is `ρ(Jac(C)) = 6`. This maximum rank of 6 is achievable for both non-hyperelliptic curves (e.g., the Fermat quartic curve `x^4+y^4+z^4=0`) and hyperelliptic curves (e.g., the curve defined by `y^2 = x^7 - x`).\n\n### Calculating the Smallest and Largest Ranks\n\nWe can now determine the full range of possible ranks for `ρ(S^{15}(C))`.\n\n#### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nTo find the smallest rank, we use the minimum possible rank for the Jacobian, `ρ(Jac(C)) = 1`, and compare the outcomes for the two types of curves.\n*   **Non-hyperelliptic case**: `ρ(S^{15}(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n*   **Hyperelliptic case**: `ρ(S^{15}(C)) = 1 + 8 = 9`.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is the minimum of these two values, which is 2. This rank is achieved for the 15th symmetric power of a generic non-hyperelliptic curve of genus 3.\n\n#### Largest Possible Rank\n\nTo find the largest rank, we use the maximum known rank for the Jacobian, `ρ(Jac(C)) = 6`, and again compare the two cases.\n*   **Non-hyperelliptic case**: `ρ(S^{15}(C)) = 6 + 1 = 7`.\n*   **Hyperelliptic case**: `ρ(S^{15}(C)) = 6 + 8 = 14`.\n\nThe largest possible rank is the maximum of these two values, which is 14. This is achieved for the 15th symmetric power of a hyperelliptic curve of genus 3 whose Jacobian has complex multiplication and is isogenous to a product of three elliptic curves.\n\nIn summary:\n*   The **smallest possible rank** of the Néron-Severi group of X is **2**.\n*   The **largest possible rank** of the Néron-Severi group of X is **14**.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 14.>>>"
