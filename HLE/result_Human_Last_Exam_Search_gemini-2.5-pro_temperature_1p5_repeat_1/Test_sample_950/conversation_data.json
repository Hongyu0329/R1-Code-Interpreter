    "The space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold denoted by $G(3, 5)$. A key property of Grassmannians is the diffeomorphism $G(k, n) \\cong G(n-k, n)$, which in this case means $G(3, 5)$ is diffeomorphic to $G(2, 5)$. This allows us to use the more commonly cited calculations for $G(2, 5)$. The dimension of this manifold is $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$.\n\nThe integral cohomology groups of real Grassmannians are known to potentially have 2-torsion. To determine the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring, we need to find the additive structure of each integral cohomology group $H^i(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nBased on computations found in multiple sources, the integral cohomology groups of $G(2, 5)$, and thus $G(3, 5)$, are as follows:\n*   $H^0(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^2(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^3(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^4(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^5(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^6(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^i(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $i > 6$\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each cohomology group. Examining the list above, we can identify the torsion parts:\n*   The torsion part of $H^3(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   The torsion part of $H^6(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   All other cohomology groups listed are torsion-free.\n\nTherefore, the torsion subgroup of the entire integral cohomology ring, $H^*(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$, is the direct sum of these two groups: $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThe question asks for the **rank** of this torsion subgroup. For a finitely generated abelian group that is purely torsion, the rank refers to the minimum number of generators. The group $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is an elementary abelian 2-group and can be viewed as a 2-dimensional vector space over the field $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The rank is the dimension of this vector space, which is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
