    "Hypothetically, a perfluoronanocar would contain 34 fluorine atoms.\n\nThis is based on the structure of the original \"nanocar\" molecule developed at Rice University. This nanocar consists of an H-shaped chassis with four fullerene (C₆₀) molecules acting as wheels. The core chemical structure of this specific nanocar has the molecular formula C₃₁₀H₃₄, meaning it contains 310 carbon atoms and 34 hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe term \"perfluoro\" indicates a compound where all hydrogen atoms on the hydrocarbon framework have been replaced by fluorine atoms. Therefore, to create a hypothetical perfluoronanocar from the original design, all 34 hydrogen atoms would be substituted with fluorine atoms.\n\nIt is worth noting that various other nanocar designs exist with different molecular formulas and thus a different number of hydrogen atoms. For instance, the \"Bobcat Nano-wagon\" is a much larger molecule with about 650 atoms, while a nanocar from a Swiss team in the Nanocar Race had only 42 atoms. However, the C₃₁₀H₃₄ structure is widely recognized as the original nanocar.\n\n<<<34>>>"
