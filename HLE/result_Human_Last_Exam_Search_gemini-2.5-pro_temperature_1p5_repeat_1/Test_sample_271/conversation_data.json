    "The user is asking for the degrees of all proper non-trivial normal field extensions of $\\mathbb{Q}$ contained in the splitting field $K$ of the polynomial $p(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the properties of the polynomial $p(x)$. A crucial piece of information is its Galois group, $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The possible degrees of intermediate fields correspond to the indices of subgroups of $G$. The degrees of *normal* intermediate fields correspond to the indices of *normal* subgroups of $G$.\n\nThe search results did not directly provide the Galois group of this specific polynomial. I need to find a way to determine it.\nLet's analyze the polynomial $p(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nI can try to factor it. Let's see if it has rational roots. By the rational root theorem, any rational root must be a divisor of 6. Let's test some small integer values:\np(1) = 1 - 2 - 9 + 3 + 18 - 6 = 5\np(-1) = -1 + 2 + 9 + 3 - 18 - 6 = -11\np(2) = 128 - 64 - 72 + 12 + 36 - 6 = 34\np(-2) = -128 + 64 + 72 + 12 - 36 - 6 = -22\np(sqrt(3)) = 27*sqrt(3) - 18*sqrt(3) - 27*sqrt(3) + 9 + 18*sqrt(3) - 6 = 3, this is not a root. But let's check for factors.\n\nNotice that the polynomial can be factored:\n$p(x) = x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6 = (x^4 - 2x^2 - 9)(x^3 + 3) - 2x^5+2x^3+9x^3$ seems wrong.\nLet's try to group terms differently.\n$x^5(x^2-2) - 9x(x^2-2) + 3(x^2+6x-2)$ does not work.\nLet's look at the coefficients: 1, 0, -2, 0, -9, 3, 18, -6.\n\nLet's check for factors of the form $(x^2-a)$. If $x^2 = a$ is a root, then $a^{3.5} - 2a^{2.5} - 9a^{1.5} + 3a + 18\\sqrt{a} - 6 = 0$. This seems unlikely.\n\nLet's test for a simple factorization. It seems that this polynomial is not trivial to factor by hand. Let's assume for a moment that it's a known polynomial and search for its factors directly.The previous step failed to find information about the polynomial. It seems I made a typo in my initial polynomial analysis. A more careful inspection or a computational tool would be useful. Let me try to see if a simple factorization exists.\nLet's re-examine the polynomial: $p(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nNotice that $p(x)$ can be written as:\n$x^3(x^4 - 2x^2 - 9) + 3(x^2 + 6x - 2)$\nThis doesn't seem to lead anywhere.\n\nLet's try to group terms in a different way:\n$x^7 - 2x^5 - 6x^3 - 3x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6$\n$x^3(x^4 - 2x^2 - 6) - 3(x^3 - x^2 - 6x + 2)$\nStill no obvious factorization.\n\nLet me assume there was a typo in the problem and a simpler factorization exists. Let's try to search for the Galois group of similar-looking polynomials. It is very likely that the polynomial factors. Let's try to factor out simple terms.\nWhat if we try to rearrange the terms: $x^7 - 2x^5 + 3x^2 - 9x^3 + 18x - 6 = x^5(x^2-2) + 3x^2 - 3(3x^3 - 6x + 2)$.\nWhat if there is a common factor of $(x^2-3)$ or $(x^3-3)$?\n$x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6 = (x^3-3)(x^4+3x^2+9) ...$ No.\nLet's try to factor out $(x^2 - a)$ or $(x-a)$.\nIt seems I'm stuck on factoring. Let's assume the polynomial is a known one from a textbook or a standard problem. It seems very similar to problems where the polynomial factors into simpler parts.\nLet's assume the polynomial is $p(x) = (x^3 - 3)(x^4 - 2x^2 - 6)$. Let's expand this to see if it matches.\n$(x^3 - 3)(x^4 - 2x^2 - 6) = x^7 - 2x^5 - 6x^3 - 3x^4 + 6x^2 + 18$. This is not the given polynomial.\n\nLet's try another factorization: $(x^3+3)(x^4 - 2x^2 - 6)$.\n$(x^3+3)(x^4 - 2x^2 - 6) = x^7 - 2x^5 - 6x^3 + 3x^4 - 6x^2 - 18$. Also not a match.\n\nLet's reconsider the original polynomial: $p(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nLet's try to rearrange again. Maybe grouping the terms with a factor of 3:\n$x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3(x^2+6x-2)$.\nIt seems there is a very high chance of a typo in the polynomial provided by the user. Let me try to search for this exact polynomial online again. If nothing comes up, I'll have to proceed with an assumption about its structure.\n\nAfter careful inspection of the polynomial, it appears there might be a typo in the `-9x^3` term. Let's try to factor by grouping once more:\n$x^5(x^2-2) - 9x(x^2-2) + 3x^2 - 6 = (x^5-9x)(x^2-2) + 3(x^2-2) = (x^5-9x+3)(x^2-2)$\nLet's expand this: $(x^5-9x+3)(x^2-2) = x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 18x + 3x^2 - 6$.\nThis matches the given polynomial: $x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\n\nSo, the polynomial is $p(x) = (x^2-2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$.\nThe splitting field $K$ of $p(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $f_1(x) = x^2-2$ and $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\nThe splitting field of $f_1(x)$ is $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\nNow I need to find the Galois group of $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\nFirst, let's check for irreducibility of $f_2(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. By Eisenstein's criterion with $p=3$, the polynomial is irreducible since 3 divides -9 and 3, but $3^2=9$ does not divide 3.\nNow I need to determine the Galois group of this quintic, $G_2 = \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q})$, where $K_2$ is the splitting field of $f_2(x)$.\nThe Galois group of an irreducible quintic is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$. The possibilities are $S_5$, $A_5$, $F_{20}$ (the Frobenius group of order 20), $D_5$ (the dihedral group of order 10), and $\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet's compute the discriminant of $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. The discriminant of $x^5+ax+b$ is $256a^5 + 3125b^4$. Here $a=-9$ and $b=3$.\n$D = 256(-9)^5 + 3125(3)^4 = 256(-59049) + 3125(81) = -15116544 + 253125 = -14863419$.\nThis is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, so the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_5$. This rules out $A_5$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$ and the Klein group which is not a Galois group of an irreducible quintic. The remaining possibilities are $S_5$, $F_{20}$, $D_5$.\n\nTo distinguish between these, we can look at the factorization of the polynomial modulo different primes.\nLet's reduce $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ modulo some small primes.\nmod 2: $x^5+x+1 = (x^2+x+1)(x^3+x^2+1)$. This factorization tells us there is an element in the Galois group with cycle structure (2,3), which has order 6. This element is not in $F_{20}$ or $D_5$. Therefore, the Galois group must be $S_5$.\n\nThe Galois group of $p(x)$ is $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. Since the splitting fields $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and $K_2$ of $x^5-9x+3$ are extensions of $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group of the compositum $K = K_1 K_2$ is a subgroup of the direct product $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$.\nThe intersection of the fields is $K_1 \\cap K_2$. $K_1$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The only quadratic subfield of $K_2$ would be $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $f_2(x)$. $D = -14863419$. This is not a multiple of 2 by a square. So $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThus, $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nTherefore, $G \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$.\nThe order of the Galois group is $|G| = 2 \\times 120 = 240$.\nThe degree of the extension $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240$.\n\nWe are looking for the degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these correspond to the indices of proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$. The degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H]$ where $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. The degree of the extension is also equal to the order of the quotient group $G/H$.\n\nLet's find the normal subgroups of $G = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product of groups $H_1 \\times H_2$ are of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$ where $N_1$ is a normal subgroup of $H_1$ and $N_2$ is a normal subgroup of $H_2$, provided that $H_1$ and $H_2$ have no common simple quotient (which is true here as orders are coprime). In general, for $G=H_1 \\times H_2$, a subgroup $N$ of $G$ is normal iff it's a product of normal subgroups of $H_1$ and $H_2$.\n\nNormal subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\nNormal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\n\nSo, the normal subgroups of $G = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$ are:\n1. $\\{e\\} \\times \\{e\\}$ (trivial subgroup, corresponds to $L=K$, degree 240)\n2. $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$\n3. $\\{e\\} \\times S_5$\n4. $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{e\\}$\n5. $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times A_5$\n6. $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$ (the whole group, corresponds to $L=\\mathbb{Q}$, degree 1)\n\nWe are looking for proper non-trivial normal extensions, so we exclude cases 1 and 6.\n\nLet's calculate the indices (which are the degrees of the extensions) for the other normal subgroups:\n- For $H_1 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$: $[G:H_1] = |G|/|H_1| = 240 / 60 = 4$. The quotient group is $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5) / (\\{e\\} \\times A_5) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_2 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The degree is 4. The field is the compositum of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D_2})$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419}, \\sqrt{2})$.\n\n- For $H_2 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$: $[G:H_2] = |G|/|H_2| = 240 / 120 = 2$. The quotient group is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The corresponding field is the one fixed by $\\{e\\} \\times S_5$, which is $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The degree is 2.\n\n- For $H_3 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{e\\}$: $[G:H_3] = |G|/|H_3| = 240 / 2 = 120$. The quotient group is $S_5$. The corresponding field is $K_2$, the splitting field of $x^5 - 9x + 3$. The degree is 120.\n\n- For $H_4 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times A_5$: $[G:H_4] = |G|/|H_4| = 240 / (2 \\times 60) = 240 / 120 = 2$. The quotient group is $S_5/A_5 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The fixed field is the quadratic subfield of $K_2$, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D_2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$. The degree is 2.\n\nSo the possible degrees of proper non-trivial normal extensions are 2, 4, and 120.\n\nThe corresponding fields are:\n- Degree 2: $L_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and $L_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$.\n- Degree 4: $L_3 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{-14863419})$. This is the splitting field of $(x^2-2)(x^2+14863419)$.\n- Degree 120: $L_4$ is the splitting field of $x^5-9x+3$.\n\nLet me double check everything. The factorization of the polynomial is correct. The Galois group of $x^2-2$ is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The irreducibility of $x^5-9x+3$ is correct. The calculation of the discriminant of the quintic and the deduction that its Galois group is not in $A_5$ is correct. The modulo 2 factorization giving a (2,3) cycle is correct and this correctly implies the Galois group is $S_5$. The fields' intersection being trivial is correct. The structure of the Galois group of the compositum is correct. The list of normal subgroups of the direct product is correct. The calculation of the indices is correct.\nSo the possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.\nThe question asks for a list of the possible degrees.Answering the request requires finding the degrees of all intermediate fields $L$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ and $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a normal extension. This can be determined by analyzing the Galois group of the polynomial $p(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFirst, we factor the polynomial $p(x)$:\n$p(x) = x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6 = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$\nThe splitting field $K$ of $p(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $f_1(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n\nLet $K_1$ be the splitting field of $f_1(x) = x^2 - 2$. The roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$, so $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet $K_2$ be the splitting field of $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n1.  **Irreducibility:** Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$, $f_2(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ because 3 divides the coefficients -9 and 3, but $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term 3.\n2.  **Galois Group:** The Galois group of an irreducible quintic polynomial is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$. The discriminant of a polynomial of the form $x^5 + ax + b$ is given by the formula $D = 256a^5 + 3125b^4$. For $f_2(x)$, we have $a = -9$ and $b = 3$.\n    $D = 256(-9)^5 + 3125(3)^4 = 256(-59049) + 3125(81) = -15116544 + 253125 = -14863419$.\n    Since the discriminant is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group, $G_2 = \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q})$, is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_5$.\n    To further identify the group, we consider the factorization of $f_2(x)$ modulo a prime. Modulo 2, we have $x^5 - 9x + 3 \\equiv x^5 + x + 1 \\pmod{2}$. This polynomial factors as $(x^2 + x + 1)(x^3 + x^2 + 1)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2[x]$. This factorization into irreducible polynomials of degrees 2 and 3 implies that the Galois group contains a permutation of the roots with cycle structure $(2,3)$. An element of order 6 (the product of disjoint cycles of length 2 and 3) exists in $S_5$. This element is not present in the other possible transitive subgroups of $S_5$ that are not contained in $A_5$ (namely $F_{20}$ and $D_5$). Therefore, the Galois group of $f_2(x)$ is $S_5$.\n\nThe Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The two fields $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and $K_2$ have trivial intersection, $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}$, because the only quadratic subfield of $K_2$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$, which is not equal to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThus, the Galois group of the compositum is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n$G \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$.\nThe order of this group is $|\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}| \\times |S_5| = 2 \\times 120 = 240$.\n\nAccording to the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ contained in $K$ correspond to normal subgroups of $G$. The degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is the index of the corresponding normal subgroup in $G$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $H_1 \\times H_2$ (where the orders of $H_1$ and $H_2$ are coprime) are of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1$ is a normal subgroup of $H_1$ and $N_2$ is a normal subgroup of $H_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\{e\\}$ (the identity) and $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\n\nThe proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$ are:\n*   $H_1 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times A_5$\n*   $H_2 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{e\\}$\n*   $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$\n*   $H_4 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$\n\nThe degrees of the corresponding normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ are the indices of these subgroups:\n*   $[L_1:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H_1] = \\frac{|\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5|}{|\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times A_5|} = \\frac{240}{2 \\times 60} = 2$.\n*   $[L_2:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H_2] = \\frac{|\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5|}{|\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{e\\}|} = \\frac{240}{2} = 120$.\n*   $[L_3:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H_3] = \\frac{|\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5|}{|\\{e\\} \\times S_5|} = \\frac{240}{120} = 2$.\n*   $[L_4:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H_4] = \\frac{|\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5|}{|\\{e\\} \\times A_5|} = \\frac{240}{60} = 4$.\n\nThe set of possible degrees for these extensions is therefore {2, 4, 120}.\n\nThe possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ are 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
