    "To find the state feedback gain matrix F such that the closed-loop system matrix A + BF has specified eigenvalues, we will follow the pole placement technique.\n\nGiven matrices are:\nA = [[-1, 1],]\nB = [,]\n\nLet the state feedback gain matrix be:\nF = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]\n\nThe closed-loop system matrix is A_cl = A + BF.\nFirst, we compute the product BF:\nBF = [,] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[1*f1 + 2*f3, 1*f2 + 2*f4], [1*f1 + 0*f3, 1*f2 + 0*f4]] = [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]\n\nNext, we form the closed-loop matrix A + BF:\nA + BF = [[-1, 1],] + [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]] = [[-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4], [1 + f1, f2]]\n\nThe desired eigenvalues are -1 + j and -1 - j. The characteristic polynomial corresponding to these eigenvalues is:\np(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j)) = (λ + 1 - j)(λ + 1 + j)\np(λ) = (λ + 1)² - j² = λ² + 2λ + 1 - (-1) = λ² + 2λ + 2\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system A + BF is given by det(λI - (A + BF)) = 0.\nFor a 2x2 matrix M = [[a, b], [c, d]], the characteristic polynomial is λ² - (a+d)λ + (ad-bc).\nLet's find the trace (tr) and determinant (det) of A + BF.\ntr(A + BF) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3) + f2 = f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1\ndet(A + BF) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3) * f2 - (1 + f2 + 2*f4) * (1 + f1)\n\nThe characteristic polynomial is λ² - tr(A + BF)λ + det(A + BF) = 0.\nComparing this with the desired polynomial λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0, we get:\n-tr(A + BF) = 2  =>  tr(A + BF) = -2\ndet(A + BF) = 2\n\nThis gives us two equations:\n1. f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1 = -2  =>  f1 + f2 + 2*f3 = -1\n2. (-1 + f1 + 2*f3)f2 - (1 + f2 + 2*f4)(1 + f1) = 2\n\nWe have two equations with four unknowns (f1, f2, f3, f4), which means there are infinite solutions. In such cases, a common approach is to force the closed-loop system to have a specific structure, such as a companion matrix (also known as a controller canonical form). The controller canonical form for a system with the characteristic polynomial λ² + a₁λ + a₀ = 0 is [, [-a₀, -a₁]].\nFor our desired polynomial λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0, we have a₁ = 2 and a₀ = 2. So the target companion form for A + BF is:\n[, [-2, -2]]\n\nWe can now equate the elements of A + BF to this target matrix:\nA + BF = [[-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4], [1 + f1, f2]] = [, [-2, -2]]\n\nThis gives a system of four linear equations:\n1. -1 + f1 + 2*f3 = 0\n2. 1 + f2 + 2*f4 = 1\n3. 1 + f1 = -2\n4. f2 = -2\n\nFrom equation (3), we find f1:\nf1 = -2 - 1 = -3\n\nFrom equation (4), we have:\nf2 = -2\n\nSubstitute f2 into equation (2) to find f4:\n1 + (-2) + 2*f4 = 1\n-1 + 2*f4 = 1\n2*f4 = 2\nf4 = 1\n\nSubstitute f1 into equation (1) to find f3:\n-1 + (-3) + 2*f3 = 0\n-4 + 2*f3 = 0\n2*f3 = 4\nf3 = 2\n\nThus, the state feedback gain matrix F is:\nF = [[-3, -2],]\n\nTo verify, let's compute A + BF with this F:\nBF = [,] * [[-3, -2],] = [[-3+4, -2+2], [-3, -2]] = [, [-3, -2]]\nA + BF = [[-1, 1],] + [, [-3, -2]] = [, [-2, -2]]\nThe characteristic polynomial of this matrix is det([[λ, -1], [2, λ+2]]) = λ(λ+2) - (-1)(2) = λ² + 2λ + 2, which is the desired polynomial.\n\n<<<F = [[-3, -2],]>>>"
