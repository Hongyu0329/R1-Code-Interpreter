    "For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the quantity \"1 - incidence rate ratio\" correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine Model:** This type of vaccine confers complete immunity to a certain proportion of vaccinated individuals, while the rest remain fully susceptible, just like unvaccinated individuals. Let's call the proportion of people who are fully protected *p*.\n*   **Incidence Rate:** The incidence rate measures how often new cases of a disease occur in a population over a specific time.\n    *   In the unvaccinated group, the incidence rate (let's call it IR_u) is determined by their exposure and susceptibility.\n    *   In the vaccinated group, the proportion *p* has an incidence rate of 0 (they are immune). The proportion (1-*p*) has an incidence rate equal to the unvaccinated group (IR_u). Therefore, the average incidence rate for the entire vaccinated group (IR_v) is (1-*p*) * IR_u.\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** The IRR is the ratio of the incidence rate in the vaccinated group to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group.\n    *   IRR = IR_v / IR_u = ((1-*p*) * IR_u) / IR_u = 1-*p*\n*   **Vaccine Efficacy (VE) from IRR:** The standard formula for vaccine efficacy based on the incidence rate ratio is VE = 1 - IRR.\n    *   VE = 1 - (1-*p*) = *p*\n    So, for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the standard VE calculation (1 - IRR) measures the proportion of vaccinated people who are fully protected.\n*   **Per-Exposure Vaccine Efficacy:** This term describes the reduction in infection risk for a single exposure.\n    *   An unvaccinated person has a certain probability of infection per exposure.\n    *   For an all-or-nothing vaccine, we consider the average vaccinated person. They have a probability *p* of being completely immune (0% risk per exposure) and a probability (1-*p*) of being completely susceptible (same risk per exposure as an unvaccinated person).\n    *   The average risk reduction per exposure for the vaccinated group as a whole is therefore *p*.\n\nSince both \"1 - incidence rate ratio\" and \"per-exposure vaccine efficacy\" are equal to *p* (the proportion of fully protected individuals), the former correctly estimates the latter. This holds true in idealized models used for theoretical evaluation. In practice, factors like waning immunity could complicate this relationship over time, but based on the fundamental models, the estimation is correct.\n\n<<<C>>>"
