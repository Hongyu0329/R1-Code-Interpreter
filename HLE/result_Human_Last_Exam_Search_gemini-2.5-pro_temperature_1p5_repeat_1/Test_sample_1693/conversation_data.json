    "## The Sinking of the \"Brazza\": The Largest French Vessel Lost to a U-Boat Before the 1940 Armistice\n\nThe largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a German U-boat before the Franco-German armistice in June 1940 was the passenger ship **\"Brazza\"**. The vessel, with a tonnage of 10,387 tons, was torpedoed and sunk by the German submarine U-37 on May 28, 1940.\n\nThe \"Brazza,\" owned by the Compagnie Française de Navigation à Vapeur Chargeurs Réunis, was en route from Bordeaux to Casablanca when it was attacked approximately 80 miles west of Cape Finisterre, Spain. The ship was struck by two torpedoes and sank rapidly, resulting in the tragic loss of 379 lives out of the 576 people on board.\n\nAnother known French naval loss to a U-boat during this period was the submarine \"Doris,\" which had a much smaller displacement of 525 to 765 tons. It was sunk by U-9 on May 8, 1940.\n\nNotably, the significantly larger French liner \"SS Champlain,\" with a gross registered tonnage of 28,124, was also lost in the same period. However, its sinking on June 17, 1940, was the result of striking a German air-laid mine. The wreck was subsequently torpedoed by U-65 a few days later. As the initial cause of its sinking was not a direct U-boat attack, the \"Brazza\" remains the largest French vessel to be sunk by a U-boat before the armistice.\n\n<<<Brazza>>>"
