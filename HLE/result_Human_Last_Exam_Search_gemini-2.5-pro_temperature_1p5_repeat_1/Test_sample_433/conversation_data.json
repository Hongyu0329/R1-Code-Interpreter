    "For a single-dose container ampule, the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) from the time of opening in a sterile environment is immediate use. Once an ampule is opened, it is considered an open system and cannot be stored for any period. Any remaining contents must be discarded immediately after a single use.\n\nIt is crucial to differentiate between an ampule and a single-dose vial. While both are single-dose containers, the guidelines for their use after being opened or punctured differ significantly.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the BUD for single-dose containers:\n\n*   **Single-Dose Ampules:** Must be used immediately upon opening. Because they are made of glass and are broken open, they cannot be resealed to maintain sterility.\n\n*   **Single-Dose Vials (e.g., a vial with a rubber stopper):**\n    *   If punctured in an ISO Class 5 or better air quality environment (such as a laminar airflow workbench or biological safety cabinet), the vial can be used for up to 6 hours, provided it remains within that sterile environment. Some revised guidelines suggest this may be extended to up to 12 hours.\n    *   If punctured in an environment with air quality worse than ISO Class 5, the vial must be used within one hour.\n\nIn summary, for a **single-dose ampule**, there is no allowable storage time after opening; it must be used immediately.\n\n<<<immediate use>>>"
