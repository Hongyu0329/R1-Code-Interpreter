    "Adult Raphidioptera, commonly known as snakeflies, are predators that feed on a variety of soft-bodied insects. They are known to be important predators of aphids.\n\nIn addition to prey, some adult snakeflies also consume other food sources. Several sources indicate that adult snakeflies feed on pollen. It has also been reported that they feed on nectar and other sugary substances.\n\nBased on the available information:\n*   **A. Nectar:** Adult snakeflies have been recorded feeding on nectar.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** Adult snakeflies are well-documented predators of aphids. While \"Totara Aphids\" are specific, they represent the general food type of aphids.\n\nTherefore, Raphidiopterans have been recorded feeding on both nectar and aphids as adults. Options such as fungus, and leaf tissue are not mentioned as part of their diet. While Māhoe pollen is a specific type of pollen, the general category of pollen is a known food source. However, since both nectar and aphids are clearly documented food sources, the combination of the two is the most accurate choice.\n\n<<<F>>>"
