    "An exact count of the single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that Natalia Osipova performed in the Act I variation of *Don Quixote* with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2008 cannot be definitively determined from available records.\n\nWhile it is documented that Osipova, then a soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet, performed the role of Kitri in 2008, including at a guest performance in Novosibirsk, Siberia, accessible videos of this specific performance are no longer available for viewing. Reviews and articles discussing her 2008 performances of *Don Quixote* praise her technical skill and character portrayal but do not provide a precise count of the pirouettes in the Act I variation. The choreography for this variation can differ between ballet companies and even individual performances, making a standardized number difficult to ascertain without visual confirmation.\n\nNumerous online videos feature Osipova in the role of Kitri, including rehearsals and performances from different years and with various ballet companies, but a verifiable video of a 2008 Bolshoi Ballet production showing the Act I variation is not accessible.\n\n<<<Not available>>>"
