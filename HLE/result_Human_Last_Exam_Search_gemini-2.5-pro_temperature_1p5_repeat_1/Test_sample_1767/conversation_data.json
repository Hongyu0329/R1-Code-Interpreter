    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they form a combined system. The Chern number, a topological invariant, is directly proportional to the quantized Hall conductance. For systems connected in parallel, their conductances add up. Therefore, the Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\nEach Chern insulator with a Chern number (C) of 1 has a Hall conductance of 1 * (e²/h), where 'e' is the elementary charge and 'h' is Planck's constant. When connected laterally, they are in a parallel configuration. The total Hall conductance of the junction will be the sum of the individual conductances:\n\nTotal Hall Conductance = (1 * e²/h) + (1 * e²/h) = 2 * e²/h\n\nSince the total Hall conductance is quantized in units of e²/h, the Chern number of the resulting junction is the integer multiple, which in this case is 2.\n\nThis is also consistent with the bulk-boundary correspondence principle. A Chern insulator with Chern number C has |C| chiral edge states at its boundary with a vacuum (which has a Chern number of 0). Each of the initial C=1 insulators has one chiral edge state. When joined laterally, the interface between them will have a number of edge states equal to the difference in their Chern numbers, which is |1 - 1| = 0. The outer edges of the new, combined system will now host the sum of the original edge states, resulting in two co-propagating chiral edge states. A system with two chiral edge states is characterized by a Chern number of 2.\n\nTherefore, the Chern number of the junction is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
