Based on the derivation, for a homogeneous and isotropic linear magnetic material, a non-trivial solution for the permeability that results in an undistorted external field does not exist. The only physical solution is μ = μ₀, which is the trivial case excluded by the problem statement. Consequently, a corresponding non-trivial interior magnetic field H_int also cannot be determined under these conditions. If the trivial case were allowed, the interior field would be H_int = H₀.
