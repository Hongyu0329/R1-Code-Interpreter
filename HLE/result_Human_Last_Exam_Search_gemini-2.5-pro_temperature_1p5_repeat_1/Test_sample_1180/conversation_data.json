    "The thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of a curve is a measure of the singularity's arithmetic depth. It can be determined by analyzing the 2-adic valuations of the roots of the defining polynomial.\n\nThe curve is defined by the equation $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. We are interested in its reduction properties over the 2-adic integers, with the valuation $v$ normalized such that $v(2)=1$.\n\nFirst, we determine the 2-adic valuations of the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. The Newton polygon of this polynomial with respect to the 2-adic valuation provides this information. The vertices of the Newton polygon are determined by the points $(i, v(c_i))$, where $c_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$. For $f(x)$, the relevant points are $(0, v(1)=0)$, $(3, v(2)=1)$, and $(5, v(2)=1)$.\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points consists of two segments:\n1.  A segment from $(0,0)$ to $(3,1)$, which has a slope of $(1-0)/(3-0) = 1/3$.\n2.  A segment from $(3,1)$ to $(5,1)$, which has a slope of $(1-1)/(5-3) = 0$.\n\nThe valuations of the roots of the polynomial are the negatives of the slopes of the Newton polygon. The length of the horizontal projection of each segment indicates the number of roots with that valuation.\n*   The first segment implies there are 3 roots with valuation $-1/3$.\n*   The second segment implies there are 2 roots with valuation $0$.\n\nThis partitions the roots of $f(x)$ into two clusters:\n*   $S_1$: A set of 3 roots with 2-adic valuation of $-1/3$.\n*   $S_2$: A set of 2 roots with 2-adic valuation of $0$.\n\nThe stable reduction of the hyperelliptic curve will have a special fiber whose components are determined by these clusters of roots. The fact that there are two distinct clusters implies that the stable reduction will have at least two components, which intersect at one or more double points (nodes). In this case, since the number of roots in the clusters are 3 and 2, which are coprime, the corresponding components of the stable model intersect at a single double point.\n\nTo find the thickness of this double point, a change of variables is made. Let $r \\in S_1$ be a root with valuation $-1/3$. This requires a ramified field extension where there is an element $\\pi$ such that $\\pi^3=2$ (so $v(\\pi) = 1/3$). We can write $r = u/\\pi$ where $u$ is a unit in the ring of integers of this extension field. Substituting this into the polynomial equation gives:\n$2(u/\\pi)^5 + 2(u/\\pi)^3 + 1 = 0$\n$\\pi^3 \\pi^{-5}u^5 + \\pi^3 \\pi^{-3}u^3 + 1 = 0$\n$\\pi^{-2}u^5 + u^3 + 1 = 0$\nMultiplying by $\\pi^2$ gives the polynomial equation for the scaled roots `u`:\n$u^5 + \\pi^2 u^3 + \\pi^2 = 0$\n\nThe valuations of the coefficients of this new polynomial in $u$ (with respect to the valuation $v$ where $v(\\pi)=1/3$) are $v(1)=0$, $v(\\pi^2)=2/3$, and $v(\\pi^2)=2/3$. It is the valuation of these coefficients, specifically $2/3$, that determines the \"arithmetic distance\" between the components of the stable reduction. This value represents the thickness of the node.\n\n<<<2/3>>>"
