    "The Hopf charge of a vector field with a toroidal structure, like the one provided, can be determined by identifying its topological winding numbers. For such a field, the Hopf charge is the product of the toroidal and poloidal winding numbers.\n\nThe given vector field is `n = (nx, ny, nz)`, where:\n*   `nx = sin(G)cos(f)`\n*   `ny = sin(G)sin(f)`\n*   `nz = cos(G)`\n\nThis represents a point on a 2-sphere with `G` as the polar angle and `f` as the azimuthal angle.\n\n1.  **Toroidal Winding Number:** This number describes how many times the vector field wraps around the equator of the target sphere as one completes a full circle in the `x-y` plane of the 3D space. The field's azimuthal angle is `f = atan2(y,x)`. As the spatial coordinates circle the z-axis once, `f` ranges from 0 to 2π. This corresponds to a single wrap around the equator. Therefore, the toroidal winding number is **1**.\n\n2.  **Poloidal Winding Number:** This number describes how the vector field wraps the sphere along a path that goes from the central axis of the torus outwards to infinity. This is determined by the behavior of the polar angle `G`.\n    *   The variable `G` is defined as `G = π * exp(-10 * r2)`.\n    *   The core of the hopfion is a circle defined by `x*x + y*y = 0.5` and `z=0`, which is where `r2 = 0`. At this core, `G = π * exp(0) = π`. This corresponds to the south pole of the vector field (`n = (0, 0, -1)`).\n    *   At an infinite distance from this core (`r2 → ∞`), `G = π * 0 = 0`. This corresponds to the north pole (`n = (0, 0, 1)`).\n    *   As one moves from the core to infinity, the polar angle `G` sweeps the entire range from `π` down to `0` exactly once. This constitutes a single full wrap of the sphere in the poloidal direction. Thus, the poloidal winding number is **1**.\n\nThe total Hopf charge is the product of these two integer winding numbers.\n\nHopf Charge = (Toroidal Winding Number) × (Poloidal Winding Number) = 1 × 1 = 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
