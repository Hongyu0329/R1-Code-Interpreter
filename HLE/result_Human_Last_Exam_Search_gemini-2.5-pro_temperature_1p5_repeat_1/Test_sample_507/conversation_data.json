    "An intriguing example of two languages from distinct Asian cultures with no significant direct contact, yet sharing highly similar words for \"broom,\" \"mom,\" and \"dad,\" is found between Korean and the Dravidian languages of Southern India, such as Tamil.\n\nThese languages belong to entirely different language families—Korean is a language isolate (or part of the Koreanic family), while Tamil is a Dravidian language. They are spoken thousands of miles apart, and while there are historical accounts of ancient cultural exchanges, such as the spread of Buddhism from India to Korea, there has been no sustained direct contact that would explain borrowing of such basic vocabulary. The similarities are largely considered linguistic coincidences or are cited as evidence by proponents of the controversial Dravidian-Korean language hypothesis.\n\nHere is a comparison of the words:\n\n*   **Mom**: The informal Korean word for mom is **eomma** (엄마). In Tamil, the word is **amma** (அம்மா).\n*   **Dad**: The informal Korean word for dad is **appa** (아빠). This is identical to the Tamil word **appa** (அப்பா).\n*   **Broom**: The Korean word for broom is **bitjaru** (빗자루). In several languages of the Indian subcontinent, including Hindi and Urdu, the word for broom is **jharu**. The similarity lies in the \"jaru\" part of the Korean word.\n\nThe resemblance between \"eomma/amma\" and \"appa/appa\" is striking. While many languages share \"mama\" and \"papa\" sounds due to the ease of infant vocalization, the specific \"amma\" and \"appa\" forms are a noted feature of the proposed Dravidian-Korean connection. The similarity in the word for \"broom\" completes the trio, making this a fascinating case of linguistic parallels between geographically and culturally separate Asian societies.\n\n<<<Korean and Tamil>>>"
