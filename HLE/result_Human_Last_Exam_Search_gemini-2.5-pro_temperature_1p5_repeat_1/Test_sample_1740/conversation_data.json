    "To date, there is some variation in the exact number of let-7 family members identified in humans, with sources reporting between nine and thirteen.\n\nThe most commonly cited number is ten unique mature let-7 sequences. These include:\n*   let-7a\n*   let-7b\n*   let-7c\n*   let-7d\n*   let-7e\n*   let-7f\n*   let-7g\n*   let-7i\n*   mir-98\n*   mir-202\n\nSome research papers and databases report a slightly different count. For instance, some sources mention at least nine members, typically listing let-7a through let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98. Other studies have identified up to twelve or thirteen let-7 family members in the human genome. These variations can arise from different annotation methods and the continuous discovery of new microRNAs. For example, some members are encoded at multiple genomic locations.\n\nIn summary, while there is a consensus on a core group of let-7 family members, the total number can vary depending on the scientific source and the database referenced.\n\n<<<10>>>"
