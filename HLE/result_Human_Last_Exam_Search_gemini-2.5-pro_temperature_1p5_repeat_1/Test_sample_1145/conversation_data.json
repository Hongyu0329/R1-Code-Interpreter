    "To determine the probability of finding the particle in the 1D box within the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for the n=2 state, we must integrate the probability density function over this interval.\n\nThe normalized wave function for a particle in a one-dimensional box of length 'a' is given by:\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\nFor the first excited state, n=2, the wave function is:\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability density, P(x), is the square of the wave function's magnitude:\nP(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\nFor the n=2 state, the wave function has a node at the center of the box, x = a/2. This means the probability of finding the particle at exactly this point is zero. The specified interval is a very small region centered around this node.\n\nTo find the probability, we integrate the probability density function over the given interval [0.495a, 0.505a]:\nP = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we use the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2:\nP = (2/a) ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1/2) * [1 - cos(4πx/a)] dx\nP = (1/a) * [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a.\n\nNow, we substitute the limits of the integration:\nP = (1/a) * { [0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)] - [0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a)] }\nP = (1/a) * { (0.505a - 0.495a) - (a/4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)] }\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(2π + 0.02π) - sin(2π - 0.02π)]\nUsing the identity sin(2π + θ) = sin(θ) and sin(2π - θ) = -sin(θ):\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [2sin(0.02π)]\nP = 0.01 - sin(0.02π)/(2π)\n\nSince the argument of the sine function (0.02π) is small, we can use the Taylor series approximation for sin(x) ≈ x - x³/6:\nLet u = 0.02π.\nP ≈ 0.01 - (1/(2π)) * [u - u³/6]\nP ≈ 0.01 - u/(2π) + u³/(12π)\nSubstituting u = 0.02π back into the expression:\nP ≈ 0.01 - (0.02π)/(2π) + (0.02π)³/(12π)\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.01 + (0.000008)π³/(12π)\nP ≈ (0.000008)π²/12\n\nUsing the value of π ≈ 3.14159:\nP ≈ (0.000008) * (9.8696) / 12\nP ≈ 0.0000065797\n\nThus, the probability is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
