    "The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $|\\mathbb{R}|$.\n\nHere is a justification for this result:\n\n### Upper Bound for the Cardinality\n\nThe set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, denoted as $C(\\mathbb{R})$, has a cardinality of $\\mathfrak{c}$. This can be shown by recognizing that a continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on a dense subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, such as the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, this establishes an injection from the set of continuous functions into the set of all functions from $\\mathbb{Q}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, which is $\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{Q}}$. The cardinality of $\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{Q}}$ is $|\\mathbb{R}|^{|\\mathbb{Q}|} = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nSince the set of solutions is a subset of all continuous functions, its cardinality is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Lower Bound for the Cardinality\n\nTo establish a lower bound, we can demonstrate the existence of at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ distinct solutions. This is achieved by constructing a family of solutions parameterized by a continuous variable. The functional equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is a classic example of a functional square root problem. While finding a single solution is non-trivial, it is known that not only do solutions exist, but they are also not unique.\n\nSolutions can be constructed by defining the function on an initial interval and then extending it to the entire real line using the equation itself. Consider the following construction method for a strictly increasing continuous solution $f$:\n\n1.  **Initial Setup**: A solution $f$ must be injective, and therefore strictly monotonic. Let's assume $f$ is strictly increasing.\n2.  **Constructing a Family of Solutions**: We can define $f$ on a specific interval first. For instance, we can specify its behavior on an interval like $[0, a]$ for some $a$. Let's try to define $f$ on the interval $$. We need to determine the values $f(0)$ and $f(1)$. Let $f(0)=a$ and $f(1)=b$. Then, from the functional equation, we must have $f(a) = f(f(0)) = \\exp(0) = 1$ and $f(b) = f(f(1)) = \\exp(1) = e$.\n3.  **Freedom of Choice**: It turns out there is significant freedom in defining the initial piece of the function. For example, we can choose a continuous, strictly increasing function $\\phi$ on an interval, and this choice will determine the rest of the function $f$. A common construction approach involves choosing a continuous, strictly increasing function $\\phi$ mapping one interval to another. Let's choose to define the behavior of $f$ on the interval $[0, 1/2]$. Let's set $f(x) = \\phi(x)$ for $x \\in [0, 1/2]$, where $\\phi$ is a continuous, strictly increasing function from $[0, 1/2]$ to $[1/2, 1]$. For the function $f$ to be continuous, we require $\\phi(0) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x)$ and $\\phi(1/2) = 1$. This last requirement comes from extending the definition to the interval $[1/2, 1]$, where we must have $f(x) = \\exp(f^{-1}(x))$. For continuity at $x=1/2$, $\\lim_{x\\to 1/2^+} f(x) = \\exp(f^{-1}(1/2))$. Since $f$ on $[0,1/2]$ maps to $[1/2, 1]$, $f^{-1}$ on this range is defined. So, $f(1/2)=\\exp(\\phi^{-1}(1/2)) = \\exp(0)=1$. So we must have $\\phi(1/2) = 1$. Let's assume we also fix $f(0)=1/2$, so $\\phi(0)=1/2$.\n4.  **Counting the Choices**: We need to count how many such functions $\\phi: [0, 1/2] \\to [1/2, 1]$ exist. We can introduce a parameter. For any real number $c \\in (3/4, 7/8)$, we can define a unique piecewise linear, continuous, and strictly increasing function $\\phi_c$ such that $\\phi_c(0)=1/2$, $\\phi_c(1/4)=c$, and $\\phi_c(1/2)=1$. The set of these functions, $\\{\\phi_c\\}$, is in one-to-one correspondence with the values of $c$, and thus has the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n5.  **Uniqueness of Constructed Functions**: Each distinct function $\\phi_c$ defines a different function $f_c$ on the interval $[0, 1/2]$. The extension of this function to the rest of $\\mathbb{R}$ is uniquely determined by the functional equation. Therefore, different choices of $\\phi_c$ lead to different solutions $f_c$ for the equation over $\\mathbb{R}$. This guarantees at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ distinct continuous solutions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ has a cardinality that is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$ and at least $\\mathfrak{c}$. By the Cantor-Bernstein theorem, the cardinality must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n<<<c>>>"
