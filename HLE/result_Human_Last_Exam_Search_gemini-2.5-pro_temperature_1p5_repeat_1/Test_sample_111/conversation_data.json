    "Blanche of Lancaster died on September 12, 1368. A timeline of Geoffrey Chaucer's life states that in 1368 he traveled to the continent, likely France, on the \"King's service.\" In 1369, he served with John of Gaunt's army in France. His first major work, *The Book of the Duchess*, was written in her honor.\n\nWhile historical records confirm Chaucer traveled to the continent around the time of Blanche's death, his exact location on the specific day she died is not definitively known. However, it is documented he was in England to write her elegy, *The Book of the Duchess*, sometime after her passing and before his departure to France with John of Gaunt's army in 1369. Since his specific whereabouts on the exact date of her death are not recorded, the most accurate answer is \"Unknown.\"\n\n<<<D>>>"
