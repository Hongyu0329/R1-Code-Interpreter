    "The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, has a total of 7 distinct power subgroups.\n\nA power subgroup G^k of a group G is the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in G. The structure of Q_128, like other generalized quaternion groups of order 2^n, is given by the presentation Q_128 = <x, y | x^64 = 1, y^2 = x^32, yxy^(-1) = x^(-1)>. The elements of Q_128 are of the form x^i and x^iy for 0 â‰¤ i < 64.\n\nThe distinct power subgroups of Q_128 are determined by the powers of 2 in the exponent. Any power subgroup with an odd exponent k is equal to the group Q_128 itself. This is because every element in a finite 2-group is a k-th power if k is odd.\n\nFor even exponents, the power subgroups form a descending chain of cyclic subgroups. The complete list of distinct power subgroups is as follows:\n*   **Q_128**: This is the power subgroup for any odd exponent k.\n*   **A cyclic subgroup of order 32**: This is the power subgroup G^2, generated by the squares of all elements in Q_128. It is equivalent to the subgroup generated by x^2.\n*   **A cyclic subgroup of order 16**: This is the power subgroup G^4, generated by <x^4>.\n*   **A cyclic subgroup of order 8**: This is the power subgroup G^8, generated by <x^8>.\n*   **A cyclic subgroup of order 4**: This is the power subgroup G^16, generated by <x^16>.\n*   **A cyclic subgroup of order 2**: This is the power subgroup G^32, generated by <x^32>. This subgroup is the center of Q_128.\n*   **The trivial subgroup**: This is the power subgroup G^64, which contains only the identity element.\n\nThese seven subgroups constitute all the possible power subgroups of the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n<<<7>>>"
