    "This is a logic puzzle. I need to find the transformation rule that converts the input to the output.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rule\n\n1.  **Core Mechanic:** The transformation involves the number '2'. In every example, the original position of the '2' becomes a '0', and one of the adjacent '0's becomes a '2'. This indicates the '2' is \"moving\" to a neighboring empty ('0') space.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Rule for Movement:** The main challenge is determining which adjacent '0' the '2' moves to when there are multiple options. Let's analyze the given pairs.\n\n    *   **Pair A:**\n        *   Input:\n            ```\n            001111\n            121111\n            111111\n            ```\n        *   The '2' is at position (row=1, col=1).\n        *   Its adjacent '0's are at (0,0) and (0,1).\n        *   The output shows the '2' moved to (0,0).\n\n    *   **Pair B:**\n        *   Input:\n            ```\n            0000000000000\n            1100000001000\n            1111000011110\n            1111002111111\n            1111111111111\n            ```\n        *   The '2' is at position (row=3, col=6).\n        *   Its adjacent '0's are at (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), and (3,5).\n        *   The output shows the '2' moved to (2,7).\n\n3.  **Finding the Pattern:** There must be a consistent rule. Let's test a hypothesis based on the coordinates.\n    *   A \"distance from origin (0,0)\" rule seems promising. Let's calculate the distance for each potential move.\n        *   In Pair A, for the '2' at (1,1):\n            *   Candidate (0,0): distance = sqrt(0²+0²) = 0\n            *   Candidate (0,1): distance = sqrt(0²+1²) = 1\n            *   The chosen destination was (0,0), the one **closest** to the origin.\n        *   In Pair B, for the '2' at (3,6):\n            *   Candidate (2,5): distance = sqrt(2²+5²) ≈ 5.39\n            *   Candidate (2,6): distance = sqrt(2²+6²) ≈ 6.32\n            *   Candidate (3,5): distance = sqrt(3²+5²) ≈ 5.83\n            *   Candidate (2,7): distance = sqrt(2²+7²) ≈ 7.28\n            *   The chosen destination was (2,7), the one **furthest** from the origin.\n\n4.  **The Meta-Rule:** The rule appears to change. In one case, it picks the closest candidate; in the other, the furthest. This suggests a \"meta-rule\" that determines which selection logic to use. Let's look at the coordinates of the '2' itself.\n    *   In Pair A, the '2' is at (1,1). The sum of coordinates is 1+1=2 (an **even** number). The rule used was \"move to closest\".\n    *   In Pair B, the '2' is at (3,6). The sum of coordinates is 3+6=9 (an **odd** number). The rule used was \"move to furthest\".\n\nThis gives us a consistent, two-part rule:\n*   Find all adjacent '0's.\n*   If the sum of the coordinates of the '2' is **even**, it moves to the adjacent '0' that is **closest** to the origin (0,0).\n*   If the sum of the coordinates of the '2' is **odd**, it moves to the adjacent '0' that is **furthest** from the origin (0,0).\n\n### Applying the Rule to Input_C\n\n1.  **Input_C:**\n    ```\n    000000\n    011120\n    111111\n    ```\n\n2.  **Locate '2':** The '2' is at (row=1, col=4).\n\n3.  **Apply Meta-Rule:** The sum of the coordinates is 1+4=5, which is **odd**. Therefore, the '2' will move to the adjacent '0' that is **furthest** from the origin.\n\n4.  **Find Candidates:** The adjacent '0's for the '2' at (1,4) are:\n    *   (0,3)\n    *   (0,4)\n    *   (0,5)\n    *   (1,5)\n\n5.  **Calculate Distances:** We calculate the squared distance (to avoid dealing with square roots) of each candidate from the origin (0,0).\n    *   Candidate (0,3): 0² + 3² = 9\n    *   Candidate (0,4): 0² + 4² = 16\n    *   Candidate (0,5): 0² + 5² = 25\n    *   Candidate (1,5): 1² + 5² = 26\n\n6.  **Determine Destination:** The furthest candidate is (1,5), with a squared distance of 26.\n\n7.  **Generate Output:**\n    *   The '2' at (1,4) becomes a '0'.\n    *   The '0' at (1,5) becomes a '2'.\n    *   The original grid:\n        ```\n        000000\n        011120\n        111111\n        ```\n    *   The new grid:\n        ```\n        000000\n        011102\n        111111\n        ```\n\n8.  **Final String:** Concatenating the rows gives the final answer.\n\n`000000,011102,111111`\n\n<<<000000,011102,111111>>>"
