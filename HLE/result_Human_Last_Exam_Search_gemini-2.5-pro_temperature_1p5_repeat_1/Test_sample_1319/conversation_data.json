    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Athos**.\n\nSeveral mountains feature in Homer's epic poem, playing significant roles as settings for divine intervention and as geographical markers. While Mount Olympus is famed as the home of the gods and is the highest peak in Greece, other notable mountains are mentioned. These include Mount Ida near Troy, Mount Pelion in Thessaly, and the mountain on the island of Samothrace.\n\nMount Athos, located on the Chalcidice peninsula in northern Greece, rises to an elevation of 2,033 meters (6,670 feet). Its prominence is such that it is mentioned in the *Iliad*, and it has a rich history interwoven with mythology and, later, Christian monasticism.\n\nFor comparison, here are the approximate heights of the other mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*:\n*   **Mount Ida**, located near ancient Troy in modern-day Turkey, has a height of about 1,774 meters (5,820 feet). It is frequently referenced in the epic as a viewpoint for the gods observing the Trojan War.\n*   The mountain on **Samothrace**, known as Mount Saos or Fengari, has an elevation of approximately 1,611 meters (5,285 feet). From its peak, Poseidon is said to have watched the battle of Troy.\n*   **Mount Pelion** in Thessaly, known in mythology as the home of the Centaurs, reaches a height of about 1,651 meters (5,417 feet).\n\nTherefore, with an elevation of 2,033 meters, Mount Athos stands as the tallest among these historical mountains referenced in the *Iliad*, second only to Mount Olympus.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
