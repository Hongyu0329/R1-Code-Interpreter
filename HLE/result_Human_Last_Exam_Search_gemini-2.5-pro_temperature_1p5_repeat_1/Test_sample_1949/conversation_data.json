    "Identifying the three longest rivers in Virgil's *Aeneid* requires a distinction between terrestrial rivers and those of the mythological underworld. While the epic mentions several rivers, both real and mythical, the following three terrestrial rivers are the longest.\n\nThe three longest rivers mentioned or alluded to in the *Aeneid* are the Eridanos (commonly identified with the Po River), the Tiber River, and the Alpheus River.\n\n1.  **Eridanos (Po River):** The Eridanos is mentioned in the *Aeneid* in the context of the underworld. Scholars widely identify Virgil's Eridanos with the Po River in Italy. The Po River is the longest river in Italy, with a length of approximately 652 kilometers (about 405 miles). There is also a prehistoric river system known as the Eridanos that was much longer, but the reference in the *Aeneid* is linked to the Italian Po.\n\n2.  **Tiber River:** The Tiber is a prominent river in the *Aeneid*, central to the Trojans' arrival and destiny in Italy. The river god Tiberinus appears to Aeneas in a dream, confirming he has reached his fated home. The Tiber is the third-longest river in Italy, flowing for 406 kilometers (252 miles).\n\n3.  **Alpheus River:** The Alpheus River in Greece is also mentioned. It is the longest river in the Peloponnese peninsula, with a length of about 112 kilometers (70 miles). In Greek mythology, the river god Alpheus was said to have pursued the nymph Arethusa under the sea to Sicily.\n\nThe rivers of the underworld, such as the Styx, Acheron, Lethe, Phlegethon, and Cocytus, are also featured prominently, particularly in Book VI when Aeneas descends into the realm of the dead. However, as mythological entities, they do not possess measurable terrestrial lengths.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Eridanos (Po River), the Tiber River, and the Alpheus River.>>>"
