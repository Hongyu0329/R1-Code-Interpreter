No, it is not possible. The two mathematical and logical systems are incommensurable. GÃ¶del's proof is a metaphysical argument within modal logic, while the mathematics of quantum mechanics is a physical theory designed to model the observable universe. There is no established way to translate the abstract axioms of the ontological proof into the formalism of quantum physics.
