    "The leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, in the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions is given in terms of ε = 4 - d, where d is the spatial dimension.\n\nThe renormalization group (RG) flow of the dimensionless coupling constant u is described by the beta function, β(u). To the leading order in ε and u, the beta function is given by:\nβ(u) = εu - (3/2)u²\n\nA fixed point of the RG flow occurs when the beta function is equal to zero, which means the coupling constant does not change with the energy scale. Setting β(u*) = 0 yields:\nεu* - (3/2)(u*)² = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions:\n1.  u* = 0, which corresponds to the trivial Gaussian fixed point.\n2.  u* = (2/3)ε, which is the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\nThis Wilson-Fisher fixed point is crucial for understanding the critical phenomena of systems described by the ϕ⁴ theory, such as the Ising model near its critical temperature. The existence of this non-trivial fixed point for d < 4 (or ε > 0) allows for the calculation of critical exponents as an expansion in ε.\n\nIt is important to note that the numerical factor in the expression for u* can vary depending on the normalization chosen for the coupling constant in the Lagrangian. The result u* = (2/3)ε corresponds to a standard convention for defining the dimensionless coupling in the epsilon expansion.\n\n<<<u* = (2/3)ε>>>"
