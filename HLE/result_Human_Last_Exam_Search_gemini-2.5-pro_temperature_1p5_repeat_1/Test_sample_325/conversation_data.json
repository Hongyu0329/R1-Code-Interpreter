    "The sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a result of the groundbreaking work of Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth. The specific curve provided, $\\{(\\cos t, \\sin t, t): 0 \\leq t \\leq 1\\}$, is a segment of a helix in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. To determine its decoupling exponent, we first need to ascertain if it is a non-degenerate curve.\n\nA curve $\\gamma(t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is considered non-degenerate if its first $n$ derivatives, $\\gamma'(t), \\gamma''(t), \\dots, \\gamma^{(n)}(t)$, are linearly independent for all $t$ in its domain. For the given helix segment:\n*   $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$\n*   $\\gamma'(t) = (-\\sin t, \\cos t, 1)$\n*   $\\gamma''(t) = (-\\cos t, -\\sin t, 0)$\n*   $\\gamma'''(t) = (\\sin t, -\\cos t, 0)$\n\nThe determinant of the matrix formed by these derivative vectors is:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin t & \\cos t & 1 \\\\ -\\cos t & -\\sin t & 0 \\\\ \\sin t & -\\cos t & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 \\cdot (\\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t) = 1 $$\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the curve is non-degenerate.\n\nThe seminal work by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth on the $l^2$ decoupling theorem established that for any non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the sharp decoupling exponent is given by $p_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. This result is a consequence of their proof for the moment curve, which serves as a model for all non-degenerate curves.\n\nFor a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we set $n=3$. Therefore, the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent is:\n$$ p_3 = \\frac{3(3+1)}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6 $$\nThis means the decoupling inequality holds for the Lebesgue exponent $p$ in the range $2 \\le p \\le 6$. The \"sharp exponent\" refers to the upper limit of this range.\n\n<<<6>>>"
