    "To find the observer canonical form of the given discrete-time system using duality, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Dual System**: The original system is given by (A, C). The dual system is a control system defined by (A<sub>d</sub>, B<sub>d</sub>), where A<sub>d</sub> = A<sup>T</sup> and B<sub>d</sub> = C<sup>T</sup>.\n\n    Given:\n    A = [,,]\n    C = [,]\n\n    The dual system matrices are:\n    A<sub>d</sub> = A<sup>T</sup> = [,,]\n    B<sub>d</sub> = C<sup>T</sup> = [,,]\n\n2.  **Transform the Dual System to Controllable Canonical Form**: The dual system is a multi-input system. The standard procedure to transform it to a canonical form involves selecting one input vector to build the transformation. We will use the first column of B<sub>d</sub>, which corresponds to the first row of C, let's call it c<sub>1</sub> =. The corresponding input vector for the dual system is b<sub>d1</sub> =<sup>T</sup>.\n\n    We need to find the transformation matrix P that transforms the pair (A<sub>d</sub>, b<sub>d1</sub>) into controllable canonical form (A<sub>c</sub>, b<sub>c</sub>).\n\n    First, we determine the characteristic polynomial of A (or A<sub>d</sub>):\n    det(λI - A) = det([[λ-1, -1, 0], [-2, λ-1, -1], [0, -2, λ]])\n    = (λ-1)(λ(λ-1) - 2) + 1(-2λ)\n    = (λ-1)(λ² - λ - 2) - 2λ\n    = λ³ - λ² - 2λ - λ² + λ + 2 - 2λ\n    = λ³ - 2λ² - 3λ + 2\n    The coefficients for the standard form λ³ + a₁λ² + a₂λ + a₃ are a₁=-2, a₂=-3, a₃=2.\n\n    The controllable canonical form for the dual system will be:\n    A<sub>c</sub> = [,, [-a₃, -a₂, -a₁]] = [,, [-2, 3, 2]]\n    b<sub>c</sub> = [,,]\n\n    The transformation matrix P is given by `P = Wc * M`, where `Wc` is the controllability matrix of (A<sub>d</sub>, b<sub>d1</sub>) and `M` is a matrix constructed from the characteristic polynomial coefficients.\n    W<sub>c</sub> = [b<sub>d1</sub>, A<sub>d</sub>b<sub>d1</sub>, A<sub>d</sub>²b<sub>d1</sub>]\n    A<sub>d</sub>b<sub>d1</sub> = [,,] * [,,] = [,,]\n    A<sub>d</sub>²b<sub>d1</sub> = [,,] * [,,] = [,,]\n    W<sub>c</sub> = [,,]\n\n    M = [[a₂, a₁, 1], [a₁, 1, 0],] = [[-3, -2, 1], [-2, 1, 0],]\n\n    P = W<sub>c</sub> * M = [,,] * [[-3, -2, 1], [-2, 1, 0],] = [, [0, -1, 1], [-1, 1, 0]]\n\n    We need the inverse of P. After calculation, we find:\n    P⁻¹ = [[1/2, 0, -1], [1/2, 0, 0], [1/2, 1, 0]]\n\n3.  **Find the Transformation for the Observer Form**: The transformation matrix T that converts the original system (A, C) to observer canonical form (A<sub>o</sub>, C<sub>o</sub>) is given by the duality relationship:\n    T = (P⁻¹)<sup>T</sup>\n    T = [[1/2, 1/2, 1/2],, [-1, 0, 0]]\n\n4.  **Calculate the new C matrix**: The new output matrix C<sub>o</sub> in the observer canonical form is given by:\n    C<sub>o</sub> = C * T\n    C<sub>o</sub> = [,] * [[1/2, 1/2, 1/2],, [-1, 0, 0]]\n    C<sub>o</sub> = [[0*1/2 + 1*0 + 0*(-1), 0*1/2 + 1*0 + 0*0, 0*1/2 + 1*1 + 0*0], [1*1/2 + 1*0 + 0*(-1), 1*1/2 + 1*0 + 0*0, 1*1/2 + 1*1 + 0*0]]\n    C<sub>o</sub> = [, [1/2, 1/2, 3/2]]\n\nThe value of the new matrix C is:\n[,\n [1/2, 1/2, 3/2]]\n\n<<<[, [0.5, 0.5, 1.5]]>>>"
