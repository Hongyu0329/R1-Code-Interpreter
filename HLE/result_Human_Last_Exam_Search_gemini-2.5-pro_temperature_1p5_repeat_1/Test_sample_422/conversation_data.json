    "<<<If the only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief under the JTB (Justified True Belief) framework, two significant problems arise, distinct from Gettier cases:\n\n1.  **The Problem of Justified Falsehoods:** The JTB definition requires a belief to be true to count as knowledge. Consider a belief that is thoroughly justified based on strong evidence and logical reasoning but ultimately turns out to be false. For instance, for over a millennium, the Ptolemaic model of the universe, which held that the Sun and planets revolved around the Earth, was a highly justified belief based on the available astronomical observations. Since this belief is false, it cannot be \"Knowledge.\" However, within a strict binary system of only \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief,\" this justified false belief is epistemically categorized identically to a mere guess, an unsupported opinion, or a whim. This framework fails to recognize the crucial epistemic value of justification itself. It creates no distinction between a belief that is a product of rigorous, albeit fallible, inquiry and one that has no rational basis, lumping both into the single category of \"Belief.\"\n\n2.  **The Problem of Attainable Truth:** The \"truth\" condition for knowledge is absolute. For a belief to be knowledge, it must actually be true. However, for the vast majority of our beliefs about the world, we can never be completely certain that they are objectively and eternally true; new evidence could always emerge to overturn them. If absolute certainty about a belief's truth is required before it can be called \"Knowledge,\" then knowledge becomes practically unattainable for anything but the most trivial propositions. This would mean that even our most well-supported scientific theories would technically never count as knowledge, but only as belief, since we can never be 100% sure they are the final, absolute truth. This makes the category of \"Knowledge\" almost uselessly small and disconnected from how we ordinarily and practically use the term.>>>"
