    "To determine the number of integer values for side AC for which there are two possible values for side length AB, we must first establish the specific conditions of the triangle.\n\nThe problem states that in triangle ABC, the side length `BC = S` and the measure of angle B is 30°. The value `S` is given as `SNYWR`. This notation corresponds to a problem from the 2020 Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament (HMMT), where `SNYWR` is the answer to a preceding problem. The value of `SNYWR` from that competition is 45360.\n\nThus, we have a triangle with the following properties:\n*   Side `a` (length of BC) = 45360\n*   Angle `B` = 30°\n*   Side `b` (length of AC) is an integer.\n*   We need to find the number of possible integer values of `b` for which there are two possible triangles, and thus two possible lengths for side `c` (AB).\n\nThis situation is known as the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines. For a given angle (like ∠B) and the lengths of the adjacent side (`a`) and the opposite side (`b`), there can be zero, one, or two possible triangles.\n\nFor there to be two possible triangles, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The side opposite the given angle (`b` = AC) must be longer than the altitude `h` from vertex C to the line containing side AB.\n2.  The side `b` must also be shorter than the adjacent side `a` (BC).\n\nLet's calculate the altitude `h`:\n`h = a * sin(B)`\n`h = 45360 * sin(30°)`\nSince sin(30°) = 0.5,\n`h = 45360 * 0.5 = 22680`\n\nThe condition for two possible triangles can be expressed as the inequality:\n`h < b < a`\n\nSubstituting the known values for `h` and `a`:\n`22680 < AC < 45360`\n\nThe problem asks for the number of *integer* values of AC that satisfy this condition. AC must be an integer greater than 22680 and less than 45360.\nThe smallest possible integer value for AC is 22681.\nThe largest possible integer value for AC is 45359.\n\nTo find the number of integers in this inclusive range, we use the formula: `Last - First + 1`.\nNumber of values = 45359 - 22681 + 1\nNumber of values = 22678 + 1\nNumber of values = 22679\n\nTherefore, there are 22,679 integer values for the length of side AC for which two possible triangles can be formed.\n\n<<<22679>>>"
