    "A unique architectural feature of the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" that was removed, though not in 1950 but rather in the late 19th century, were the so-called \"donkey's ears\" (orecchie d'asino). These were two bell towers added to the Pantheon's facade by the architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini in the 17th century. They were widely criticized for being out of harmony with the ancient temple's design and were eventually demolished in 1883.\n\nWhile the city of Rome did undertake many urban changes around the mid-20th century, including the removal of some tram lines from the historic center, there is no strong evidence to suggest a unique architectural feature was specifically removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in the year 1950. The most notable and well-documented removal of a unique, and controversial, architectural feature from the immediate vicinity of the Pantheon remains the demolition of Bernini's bell towers.\n\n<<<The \"donkey's ears\" (orecchie d'asino), two bell towers added to the Pantheon by Bernini, which were demolished in 1883.>>>"
