    "In φ⁴ scalar field theory, the second-order vacuum bubble diagrams are Feynman diagrams with two vertices, no external lines, and are proportional to λ², where λ is the coupling constant. There are three such distinct diagrams. The symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram is a crucial component in calculating the corresponding amplitude and arises from the permutations of lines and vertices that leave the diagram's topology unchanged.\n\nThe three second-order vacuum bubble diagrams and their respective symmetry factors are:\n\n1.  **The \"figure-of-eight\" or \"double-scoop\" diagram:** This diagram consists of two vertices, with two propagators forming a loop from one vertex back to itself, and this is repeated for the second vertex. The two vertices are not connected to each other. Its symmetry factor is **8**.\n\n2.  **The \"Saturn\" diagram:** This diagram has two vertices. One vertex has a propagator starting and ending at itself, forming a loop. This vertex is then connected to the second vertex by another propagator. The remaining two lines from the second vertex also form a loop. The symmetry factor for this diagram is **16**.\n\n3.  **The \"sunset\" diagram with two loops:** In this diagram, the two vertices are connected to each other by four distinct propagators. Its symmetry factor is **48**.\n\nTo find the sum of all the symmetry factors for each of these second-order vacuum bubble diagrams, we simply add the individual symmetry factors:\n\nSum = 8 + 16 + 48 = 72\n\n<<<72>>>"
