    "The product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n### Reaction Details:\n\n*   **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, which has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **Wittig Reagent:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane is a phosphorus ylide. Its structure is (2-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=P(Ph)₃.\n\nIn a Wittig reaction, the carbonyl group (C=O) of an aldehyde or ketone is converted into a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). The reaction involves a nucleophilic attack of the ylide on the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a four-membered ring intermediate called an oxaphosphetane, which then decomposes to the final alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n(CH₃)₃C-CHO + (2-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=P(Ph)₃ → (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl) + (Ph)₃P=O\n\n### Stereochemistry:\n\nThe stereochemistry of the resulting alkene (whether it is the E- or Z-isomer) depends on the nature of the ylide.\n\n1.  **Ylide Classification:** The ylide in this reaction, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane, is classified as a **non-stabilized** or **unstabilized ylide**. This is because the group attached to the carbanionic center is an alkyl group, which does not stabilize the negative charge through resonance.\n2.  **Selectivity:** Wittig reactions involving non-stabilized ylides reacting with aldehydes are generally **Z-selective**, meaning they predominantly form the Z-alkene (also known as the *cis*-alkene). This selectivity arises from kinetic control of the reaction, where the transition state leading to the Z-isomer is lower in energy.\n\nTo determine the Z-configuration of the product, 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene, we assign priorities to the substituents on the double bond according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules:\n*   On one carbon of the double bond: a t-butyl group and a hydrogen. The t-butyl group is higher priority.\n*   On the other carbon of the double bond: a (2-chlorobenzyl) group and a hydrogen. The (2-chlorobenzyl) group is higher priority.\n\nIn the **Z-isomer**, the two higher-priority groups (the t-butyl and the 2-chlorobenzyl group) are on the same side of the double bond.\n\nTherefore, the major product of this specific Wittig reaction is the Z-isomer.\n\n<<<**(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**>>>"
