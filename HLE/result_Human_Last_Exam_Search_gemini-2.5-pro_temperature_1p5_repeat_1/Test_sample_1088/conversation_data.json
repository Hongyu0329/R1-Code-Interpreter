    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set is not a single value; it depends on the specific atoms in the molecule. The notation \"6-311G**\" describes how the atomic orbitals of each atom are constructed from primitive Gaussian functions.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the notation:\n\n*   **6-311G**: This part describes the basis set for the core and valence electrons.\n    *   **6**: Each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function, which is a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   **311**: The valence orbitals are of triple-zeta quality, meaning each is described by three functions. The first function is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, while the second and third are single, uncontracted primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **G**: This indicates that Gaussian-type functions are used.\n*   **\\*\\***: This part, also notated as (d,p), specifies the addition of polarization functions to improve the description of chemical bonding.\n    *   The first **\\*** adds a set of d-type polarization functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms.\n    *   The second **\\*** adds a set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms.\n\nTo calculate the total number of primitive Gaussians, one must sum the primitives for each atom in the molecule.\n\n**For a Hydrogen atom:**\n\n*   **Valence (1s):** The 1s orbital is described by three functions: a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, and two individual primitive Gaussians. This gives a total of 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitives for the s-orbital.\n*   **Polarization (p-functions):** The second asterisk adds a set of p-type polarization functions. A set of p-functions consists of three orbitals (px, py, pz), and each is a single primitive Gaussian. This adds 3 primitives.\n*   **Total for Hydrogen:** 5 (for s) + 3 (for p) = **8 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n**For a heavy atom (e.g., Carbon, from the first row):**\n\n*   **Core (1s):** The 1s core orbital is a single contracted function made from 6 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p):**\n    *   The 2s and 2p orbitals are treated together. The valence shell is split into three parts for each of the s and p orbitals.\n    *   For the 2s and each of the three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz), the basis functions are: a contraction of 3 primitives, a single primitive, and another single primitive.\n    *   Therefore, the s and p valence orbitals are built from a total of (1s + 3p) orbitals * (3+1+1 primitives) = 4 * 5 = 20 primitive Gaussians. A more detailed look at the contraction scheme for first-row atoms shows it as (11s, 5p) contracted to [4s, 3p]. This means a total of 11s primitives and 5p primitives. So 11 + 5 = 16 primitives for the 6-311G part. Let's stick with the more detailed breakdown.\n    * The total number of primitives for the s and p orbitals is derived from the contraction scheme (6311, 311) which results in (11s, 5p). So, there are 11 s-type primitives and 5 p-type primitives per p orbital which is incorrect. It is 5 primitives for all p orbitals (px, py, pz share the same exponents). Let's refer to a simpler explanation. The core is 6 primitives. The valence s and p orbitals are each described by a set of 3 primitives, a set of 1 primitive, and another set of 1 primitive. This is 1*6 (core) + 4*(3+1+1) = 26 primitives for s and p orbitals seems too high.\n    *   Based on the designation for first-row atoms (like Carbon or Oxygen) as (11s, 5p) for the 6-311G part, this means: 11 s-type primitive Gaussians and 5 p-type primitive Gaussians.  Total = 16 primitives.\n*   **Polarization (d-functions):** The first asterisk adds a set of d-type polarization functions. In the 6-311G* basis, this is a single set of 5d functions (using 5 spherical d functions).  These are uncontracted, so this adds 5 primitives.\n*   **Total for a first-row heavy atom (like Carbon or Oxygen):** 16 (for s and p) + 5 (for d) = **21 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n**For a second-row heavy atom (e.g., Silicon):**\n\n*   **Core and Valence:** For second-row atoms, the 6-311G keyword in Gaussian defaults to the McLean-Chandler basis sets, which have a contraction scheme of (12s, 9p) contracted to [6s, 5p] for atoms like P, S, and Cl. This gives a total of 12 + 9 = 21 primitive Gaussians for the s and p orbitals.\n*   **Polarization (d-functions):** The addition of a d-polarization function adds a set of 5 uncontracted d-functions.\n*   **Total for a second-row heavy atom (like Silicon):** 21 (for s and p) + 5 (for d) = **26 primitive Gaussians**.\n\nTherefore, the total number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set for a given molecule is the sum of the primitives for each of its constituent atoms.\n\nFor example, for a water molecule (H₂O):\n\n*   Oxygen: 21 primitives\n*   Hydrogen 1: 8 primitives\n*   Hydrogen 2: 8 primitives\n*   **Total for H₂O:** 21 + 8 + 8 = **37 primitive Gaussians**\n\n<<<The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set is not a fixed number, but is determined by summing the primitives for each atom in a molecule. For a hydrogen atom, there are 8 primitive Gaussians. For a first-row heavy atom (like Carbon or Oxygen), there are 21 primitive Gaussians. For a second-row heavy atom (like Silicon), there are 26 primitive Gaussians.>>>"
