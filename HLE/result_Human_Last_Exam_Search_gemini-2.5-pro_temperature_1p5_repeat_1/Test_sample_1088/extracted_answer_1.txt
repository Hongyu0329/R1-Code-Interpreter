The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set is not a fixed number, but is determined by summing the primitives for each atom in a molecule. For a hydrogen atom, there are 8 primitive Gaussians. For a first-row heavy atom (like Carbon or Oxygen), there are 21 primitive Gaussians. For a second-row heavy atom (like Silicon), there are 26 primitive Gaussians.
