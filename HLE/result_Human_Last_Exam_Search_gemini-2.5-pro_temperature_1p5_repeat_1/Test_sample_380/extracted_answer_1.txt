The local magnetic field is not generally considered to be radial for calculating the normalized magnetic helicity of AIC waves at the L1 point. The calculation is correctly performed using the magnetic field components perpendicular to the *local mean magnetic field*, because AIC waves propagate along this local field. The interplanetary magnetic field at L1 typically follows the Parker spiral and is not aligned with the radial direction.
