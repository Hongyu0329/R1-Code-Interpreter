    "The major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide is perylene-3-thiol. The disulfide bond (–S–S–) is cleaved during reduction to form two equivalent molecules of the corresponding thiol (–SH).\n\nTo determine the Szeged/Wiener index ratio for perylene-3-thiol, including hydrogen atoms, requires specialized computational chemistry software capable of handling molecular graphs with hydrogens explicitly included. The molecular formula for perylene-3-thiol is C20H12S, and its structure can be represented by the SMILES string C1=CC2=C3C(=C1)C4=C5C(=CC=C4)C(=CC=C5C3=CC=C2)S.\n\nThe calculation involves these steps:\n1.  Constructing the complete molecular graph for perylene-3-thiol, where all 33 atoms (20 carbon, 12 hydrogen, and 1 sulfur) are represented as vertices and covalent bonds as edges.\n2.  Calculating the Wiener index (W), which is the sum of the shortest path distances between all pairs of vertices in this graph.\n3.  Calculating the Szeged index (Sz), which for each bond (edge) is the product of the number of atoms on each side of the bond, summed over all bonds in the molecule.\n4.  Computing the final ratio of Sz/W.\n\nThese calculations, especially with the inclusion of hydrogen atoms, are computationally intensive and cannot be performed manually. While tools and programming libraries exist for such calculations, such as the `SzegedIndex` function in the Wolfram Language which allows for the inclusion of hydrogens, they are not accessible in this environment. Web-based calculators found are either limited to simpler molecules or do not support the critical feature of including hydrogen atoms in the underlying graph.\n\nDue to these computational limitations, it is not possible to provide the final numerical value for the Szeged/Wiener index ratio.\n\n<<<Unable to compute>>>"
