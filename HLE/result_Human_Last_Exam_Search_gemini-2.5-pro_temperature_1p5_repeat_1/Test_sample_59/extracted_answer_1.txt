In a jointly exchangeable random graph of size N, the probability of drawing a link \(y_{ij}\) between two vertices \(i\) and \(j\) is given by \(W(U_i, U_j)\), where \(U_i\) and \(U_j\) are independent random variables drawn from a uniform distribution on \(\), and \(W\) is a symmetric, measurable function from \(^2\) to \(\) known as a graphon. The random measure \(F\) can be considered the law governing the (possibly random) graphon \(W\). This is a direct consequence of the Aldous-Hoover representation theorem.
