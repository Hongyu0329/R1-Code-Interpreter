    "The user is asking for the upper bound of a quantity likely related to the sup-norm of certain mathematical objects, in relation to another quantity called covolume, in the specific context of squarefree natural numbers. Based on the search results, this question is best interpreted in the context of the **sup-norm problem for Hecke-Maass cusp forms** on congruence subgroups of $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the terms:\n\n*   **Maximum norm ($||\\phi||_\\infty$)**: The notation in the prompt, $(k_{k,\\infty})$, is likely a slight misrepresentation of the standard notation $||\\phi||_\\infty$. In this context, $\\phi$ is a Hecke-Maass cusp form, which is a specific type of automorphic form that is an eigenfunction of the hyperbolic Laplacian on the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$ quotiented by a congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$. The sup-norm, $||\\phi||_\\infty$, is the maximum value that the absolute value of this function $|\\phi(z)|$ can attain over the space. It is assumed that the form is $L^2$-normalized, meaning that its integral over the fundamental domain is 1.\n\n*   **Squarefree natural numbers ($N$)**: In this context, $N$ is the **level** of the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$. The condition that $N$ is squarefree is a common and important case in the study of automorphic forms. A natural number is squarefree if its prime factorization contains no repeated prime factors.\n\n*   **Covolume ($V$)**: The covolume refers to the volume of the quotient space $\\Gamma_0(N) \\setminus \\mathbb{H}$. For the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$, the covolume, denoted as $\\text{vol}(\\Gamma_0(N)\\setminus\\mathbb{H})$, is directly proportional to the level $N$. Specifically, for squarefree $N$, the covolume is given by:\n\n    $V = \\text{vol}(\\Gamma_0(N)\\setminus\\mathbb{H}) = \\frac{\\pi}{3} N \\prod_{p|N} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})$, where the product is over the prime divisors of $N$.  Therefore, the covolume $V$ grows essentially linearly with the level $N$.\n\n### The Upper Bound\n\nThe problem of finding an upper bound for the sup-norm of Maass forms is a significant area of research in analytic number theory. For an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass cusp form $\\phi$ of squarefree level $N$, there are various bounds that have been established. A notable \"trivial\" bound is $||\\phi||_\\infty \\ll_\\epsilon N^{1/2 + \\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$. However, substantial research has been devoted to finding stronger \"sub-convex\" bounds.\n\nOne of the key results for squarefree level $N$ is provided by Nicolas Templier. In his 2015 paper \"Hybrid sup-norm bounds for Heckeâ€“Maass cusp forms\", he established the following upper bound, which is also dependent on the Laplacian eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of the form:\n\n$||\\phi||_\\infty \\ll_\\epsilon \\lambda^{\\frac{5}{24}+\\epsilon} N^{\\frac{1}{3}+\\epsilon}$\n\nHere, the notation $\\ll_\\epsilon$ means that the implied constant depends on $\\epsilon$. Since the covolume $V$ is approximately a constant multiple of $N$, this bound can be expressed in terms of $V$ as:\n\n$||\\phi||_\\infty \\ll_\\epsilon \\lambda^{\\frac{5}{24}+\\epsilon} V^{\\frac{1}{3}+\\epsilon}$\n\nThis result improves upon the trivial bound and is a significant step in the sup-norm problem. It's important to note that the field is subject to ongoing research, and there have been further refinements and results in different aspects of the problem.\n\nIn summary, the upper bound for the maximum norm (sup-norm) of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass cusp form $\\phi$ in relation to the covolume $V$ for a squarefree level $N$ is given by Templier's result, which shows that the sup-norm is bounded by the covolume raised to the power of one-third (plus an arbitrarily small positive epsilon).\n\n<<<The upper bound for the maximum norm (sup-norm) of a Hecke-Maass cusp form, denoted as $||\\phi||_\\infty$, in relation to the covolume ($V$) for a squarefree natural number level $N$, is given by $||\\phi||_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} \\lambda^{\\frac{5}{24}+\\epsilon} V^{\\frac{1}{3}+\\epsilon}$.>>>"
