    "To scan the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago,\" we must determine the metrical quantity (long or short) of each syllable and group them into six feet. A dactyl consists of one long syllable followed by two short syllables (— U U), while a spondee consists of two long syllables (— —).\n\nThe line is from Lucretius' *De Rerum Natura* (4.741) and is known for being metrically difficult, with several scholarly suggestions for textual emendation to resolve its challenges. However, scanning the line as it is traditionally written requires acknowledging certain metrical licenses or irregularities.\n\nHere is a step-by-step scansion:\n\n1.  **Syllabification and Elisions**: First, we identify syllables that are elided (dropped in pronunciation).\n    *   `verum ubi`: The final `-um` of *verum* is elided before the initial vowel of *ubi*.\n    *   `atque hominis`: The final `-e` of *atque* is elided before the initial `h-` of *hominis*.\n\n2.  **Foot-by-Foot Analysis**:\n\n    *   **Foot 1**: `vēr(um) u-bĭ`\n        The first syllable, `ver-`, is long by position because its vowel is followed by two consonants (`r` and `m`). The elision of `-um` connects it to `ubi`. The syllables `u` and `bi` are both naturally short. This forms a **dactyl (D)**: — U U.\n\n    *   **Foot 2**: `ē-quī āt-`\n        This foot presents the first major difficulty. For the line to scan, the naturally short `e-` of *equi* must be treated as long by metrical license. The syllable `qui` is long by position, as its vowel is followed by the two consonants `t` and `qu` in *atque*. This forces a **spondee (S)**: — —.\n\n    *   **Foot 3**: `qu(e) hō-mĭn-`\n        The `-que` from *atque* (with the `-e` elided) connects to *hominis*. Again, to maintain the meter, a license must be taken by treating the `ho-` as long. The syllable `-min-` is long by position as it is followed by the consonants `n` and `c` (from the following word *casu*). This creates a **spondee (S)**: — —.\n\n    *   **Foot 4**: `nīs cā-sū`\n        The final syllable of *hominis*, `-nis`, is long by position before the `c-` of *casu*. The `ca-` and `-su` of the ablative *casu* are both long by nature. This allows for a **spondee (S)**: — —.\n\n    *   **Foot 5**: `cōn-vē-nĭt`\n        This foot is formed from the perfect tense of the verb *convenit* (`convēnit`). The syllable `con-` is long by position. The syllable `ve-` contains a naturally long vowel (`ē`). This leaves `nit` as a short syllable. This configuration (`— — U`) does not form a standard dactyl or spondee. This part of the line is also considered problematic. However, if we assume the verb is in the present tense (`cŏnvĕnĭt`), the foot becomes a **dactyl (D)**: `cōn-` (long), `-vĕ-` (short), `-nĭt` (short).\n\n    *   **Foot 6**: `ĭ-mā-gō`\n        With the previous foot ending on `convenit`, this leaves *imago* to form the final foot. A standard final foot is a spondee (`— —`). However, *imago* syllabifies as short-long-long (`U — —`), which is a bacchius, not a spondee. This final irregularity confirms the difficulty of the line. Forcing a spondee would require treating the initial `i-` as long.\n\nGiven the cascading irregularities, the most accepted scansion relies on forcing the meter to fit a common Lucretian rhythm, often with a spondaic fifth foot. A plausible reading is:\n\n*   **Dactyl | Spondee | Spondee | Spondee | Dactyl | Spondee**\n\n<<<D-S-S-S-D-S>>>"
