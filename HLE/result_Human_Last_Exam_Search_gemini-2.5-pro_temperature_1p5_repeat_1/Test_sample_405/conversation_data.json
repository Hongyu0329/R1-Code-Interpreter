    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in four main colors. These distinct forms of phosphorus, each with a unique atomic structure, exhibit different physical and chemical properties, including their color.\n\nThe primary colors of phosphorus allotropes are:\n*   **White:** This is the most common and reactive allotrope. When pure, it is a translucent, waxy solid that is colorless or white. Upon exposure to light or due to impurities, it can appear yellow, and is sometimes referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n*   **Red:** A more stable allotrope, red phosphorus is formed by heating white phosphorus. It is dark red in color and may have an iron-grey luster.\n*   **Violet:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this is a crystalline form that can be produced by annealing red phosphorus at high temperatures. Its color is distinctly violet or a reddish-purple.\n*   **Black:** This is the most thermodynamically stable and least reactive allotrope of phosphorus. It has a black, flaky appearance similar to graphite and can possess a metallic luster. Black phosphorus exists in two forms, α-black and β-black.\n\nWhile other allotropes have been synthesized or theorized, such as blue phosphorus, these four represent the most commonly observed and distinct colors in bulk form.\n\n<<<4>>>"
