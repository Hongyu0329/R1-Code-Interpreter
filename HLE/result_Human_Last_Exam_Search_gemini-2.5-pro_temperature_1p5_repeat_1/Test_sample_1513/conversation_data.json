    "An island town situated more than 500 kilometers from any other inhabited island rests on a bay formed by the volcanic caldera that shares the town's name: Edinburgh of the Seven Seas.\n\nThe settlement of Edinburgh of the Seven Seas is the capital of Tristan da Cunha, the most remote inhabited archipelago in the world. It is located in the South Atlantic Ocean, with its nearest inhabited neighbor, Saint Helena, being approximately 2,430 kilometers away.\n\nTristan da Cunha is a large, active stratovolcano that rises from the ocean floor. The island is a near-perfect volcanic cone, and its highest point, Queen Mary's Peak, features a summit crater. The town of Edinburgh of the Seven Seas is located on the only flat coastal plain of the island, at the base of 800-meter-high cliffs of the volcano. This plain overlooks a bay on the northern coast of the island. The entire island is a product of this volcanism. In 1961, a volcanic eruption occurred right next to the settlement, leading to the temporary evacuation of the population.\n\nWhile the bay itself is not a classic, self-contained caldera, the town is situated on a bay of the massive volcanic island, which was formed by a caldera. No other inhabited island town meets the criteria of being so remote and intrinsically linked to a volcanic caldera. The name of the town, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, is often used to refer to the settlement and its unique location on this isolated volcanic island.\n\n<<<Edinburgh of the Seven Seas>>>"
