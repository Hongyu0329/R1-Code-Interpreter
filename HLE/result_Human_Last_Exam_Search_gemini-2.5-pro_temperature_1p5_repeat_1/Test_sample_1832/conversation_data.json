    "In the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body of mass $M$, described by the Schwarzschild metric, there are 9 unique non-zero Christoffel symbols.\n\nThe Schwarzschild metric is a solution to the Einstein field equations in a vacuum for a spherically symmetric mass. It is diagonal, with components that depend on the radial coordinate $r$ and the polar angle $\\theta$. The Christoffel symbols, which represent the gravitational field's strength, are calculated from the derivatives of this metric tensor.\n\nDue to the symmetries of the Schwarzschild metric (it is static and spherically symmetric), most of the 40 independent Christoffel symbols are zero. A detailed calculation reveals the following 9 unique non-zero components:\n\n*   Four symbols with the upper index $\\rho=r$:\n    *   $\\Gamma_{tt}^r$\n    *   $\\Gamma_{rr}^r$\n    *   $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\theta}^r$\n    *   $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^r$\n\n*   One symbol with the upper index $\\rho=t$:\n    *   $\\Gamma_{tr}^t = \\Gamma_{rt}^t$\n\n*   Two symbols with the upper index $\\rho=\\theta$:\n    *   $\\Gamma_{r\\theta}^\\theta = \\Gamma_{\\theta r}^\\theta$\n    *   $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^\\theta$\n\n*   Two symbols with the upper index $\\rho=\\phi$:\n    *   $\\Gamma_{r\\phi}^\\phi = \\Gamma_{\\phi r}^\\phi$\n    *   $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\phi}^\\phi = \\Gamma_{\\phi\\theta}^\\phi$\n\nIt is important to note that the Christoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower two indices ($\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$) in general relativity. If one were to count each non-zero component without considering this symmetry, the number would be 13. However, the standard convention is to count the unique, independent components.\n\n<<<9>>>"
