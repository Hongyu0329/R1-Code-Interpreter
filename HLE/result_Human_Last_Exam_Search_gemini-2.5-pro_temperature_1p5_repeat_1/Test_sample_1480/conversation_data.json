    "The rule activation level of a fuzzy rule is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the antecedent and the membership value of the consequent. In this case, the firing strength is given by `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`, and the membership value of the consequent is `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. A t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical AND operation for fuzzy logic. The result of the rule activation level will vary depending on the specific t-norm used.\n\nHere are the calculations for the most common t-norms:\n\n*   **Minimum t-norm (Gödel t-norm):** This is one of the most frequently used t-norms and is defined as the minimum of the two values.\n    *   Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n*   **Product t-norm:** This t-norm is calculated by multiplying the two values.\n    *   Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\n*   **Łukasiewicz t-norm:** This t-norm is calculated using the formula max(0, a + b - 1).\n    *   Activation Level = max(0, 0.7 + 0.9 - 1) = max(0, 0.6) = 0.6\n\nWithout a specified t-norm, the rule activation level can be 0.7 (using the minimum t-norm), 0.63 (using the product t-norm), or 0.6 (using the Łukasiewicz t-norm). If a specific t-norm is not mentioned, the minimum t-norm is often the default choice in many fuzzy systems.\n\n<<<0.7 (using Minimum t-norm), 0.63 (using Product t-norm), or 0.6 (using Łukasiewicz t-norm). The result depends on the specific t-norm applied.>>>"
