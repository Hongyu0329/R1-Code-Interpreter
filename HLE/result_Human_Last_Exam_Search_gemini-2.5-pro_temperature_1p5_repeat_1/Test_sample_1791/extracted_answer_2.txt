The effective electron-electron interaction potential for a specific wavevector **q**, mediated by the phonons, is given by:

$V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}, i\Omega_n) = - \sum_{j} \frac{g^2 q_j^2 / m}{\Omega_n^2 + \omega_q^2}$

where:
*   $g$ is the electron-phonon coupling constant.
*   $q_j$ is the j-th component of the wavevector **q**.
*   $m$ is the mass term from the original coupling.
*   $\omega_q$ is the phonon frequency (energy) at wavevector **q**.
*   $\Omega_n$ is the bosonic Matsubara frequency, which represents the energy transferred in the electron-electron interaction.
*   The sum is over the phonon modes (polarizations) $j$.

This interaction is attractive (indicated by the negative sign) and frequency-dependent. In the static limit ($\Omega_n \to 0$), the interaction becomes:

$V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}) = - \sum_{j} \frac{g^2 q_j^2}{m \omega_q^2}$
