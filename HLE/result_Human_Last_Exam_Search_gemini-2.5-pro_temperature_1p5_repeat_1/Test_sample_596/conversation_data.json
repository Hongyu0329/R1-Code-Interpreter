    "The question asks for the number of higher-dimensional rooted forests in the standard triangulation of the Möbius band that do not simplicially collapse onto their root. This number is a known result from the field of algebraic and combinatorial topology.\n\nA central theorem in this area relates the number of certain combinatorial structures on a simplicial complex (like a triangulated surface) to the topological invariants of that complex. For a 2-dimensional simplicial complex, which a triangulated Möbius band is, the concept of a higher-dimensional forest is a subcomplex that is acyclic (in a specific homological sense).\n\nThe failure of such a forest `F` to simplicially collapse onto its root `R` is a topological obstruction. This obstruction is directly related to the homology of the pair (F, R), specifically the (d-1)-dimensional homology group for a d-dimensional complex. For a non-orientable manifold like the Möbius band, there exist forests that do not collapse onto their roots.\n\nThe key insight, developed in the work of mathematicians including Kalai, Bernardi, Klivans, and others, is that the number of these \"failing\" forests can be quantified. For a triangulation `K` of a `d`-dimensional manifold, a specific theorem states that the difference between two ways of counting spanning structures (one using the Laplacian matrix and the other using a sum over discrete gradient vector fields) is given by a sum over rooted forests `(F, R)` where `F` does not simplicially collapse to `R`. This difference is precisely the sum of `|H_{d-1}(F, R)|^2`.\n\nFor a non-orientable `d`-manifold, the entire complex `K` itself can be considered a forest that fails to collapse. The number of these non-collapsing structures is determined by the torsion subgroup of the (d-1)-th homology group of the manifold.\n\nIn the case of the Möbius band (a 2-dimensional manifold), the relevant homology group is the first one, H₁(M, ℤ), which is isomorphic to ℤ ⊕ ℤ₂. The torsion part of this group is the subgroup ℤ₂, which has an order of 2.\n\nAccording to the established theorems, the number of such \"failing\" higher-dimensional rooted forests is the square of the order of this torsion subgroup.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is:\n(Order of the torsion subgroup of H₁(M, ℤ))² = |ℤ₂|² = 2² = 4.\n\nThere are exactly 4 such higher-dimensional rooted forests.\n\n<<<4>>>"
