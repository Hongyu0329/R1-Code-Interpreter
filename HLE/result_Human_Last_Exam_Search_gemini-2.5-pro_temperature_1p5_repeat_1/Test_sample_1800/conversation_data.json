    "### No Single Ideal Ratio: Optimal Ni/Ce Balance in Nanoparticles Varies for Catalytic Reactions\n\nDetermining the ideal nickel-to-cerium (Ni/Ce) ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for maximizing catalytic performance is a complex task, as the optimal composition is highly dependent on the specific application, namely the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction versus water splitting. Research indicates that there is no single ratio that is universally ideal for both processes. The optimal balance is influenced by factors such as the specific reaction conditions and the desired catalytic pathway.\n\n**For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction:**\n\nStudies focusing on the WGS reaction, which is crucial for hydrogen purification, suggest that a significant presence of nickel is beneficial. An atomic ratio of **Ni/Ce = 1.0** has been identified as optimal for achieving the highest catalytic activity. In separate investigations analyzing the weight percentage of nickel, catalysts with 10 wt% and 12.5 wt% Ni both demonstrated high carbon monoxide conversion, with the **12.5 wt% Ni/CeO₂** catalyst achieving the peak conversion rate of 97.8% at 400°C. Conversely, for the reverse WGS reaction, a lower nickel molar proportion of approximately **7%** has been reported as the most effective.\n\n**For Water Splitting:**\n\nIn the case of water splitting, which involves two half-reactions—the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)—the ideal Ni/Ce ratio can differ.\n\n*   **Overall Water Splitting:** For bifunctional catalysts active in both HER and OER, a ceria-rich composition with a **Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2** (Ni₃N-2CeO₂/NF) has been shown to provide the best performance for the HER part of the reaction. Another study found that co-doping with iron, resulting in a catalyst with **20 mol% of Ni and Fe in a 1:1 ratio** in ceria, yielded excellent overall water splitting activity.\n\n*   **Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER):** For the OER, which is often a bottleneck in water splitting, catalysts with a higher nickel content, specifically **Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ and Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ**, have been found to exhibit superior activity.\n\n*   **Computational Insights:** Theoretical calculations offer a different perspective, suggesting that from an electronic properties standpoint, a **3Ni/1Ce ratio** creates a more favorable adsorption energy for the water-splitting reaction.\n\nIn summary, a definitive, single ideal Ni/Ce ratio for both the WGS reaction and water splitting does not exist. For the WGS reaction, an approximate 1:1 atomic ratio or a nickel loading in the range of 7-12.5% is generally favored. For water splitting, the optimal ratio is more varied, with some studies indicating a higher proportion of ceria or the inclusion of co-dopants like iron leads to better performance.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not the same for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting, with optimal ratios varying depending on the specific application and reaction conditions. For WGS, a Ni/Ce atomic ratio of approximately 1 or a Ni loading of 7-12.5 wt% is often optimal. For water splitting, the ideal ratio varies more widely, with some studies favoring higher ceria content or co-doping with other elements.>>>"
