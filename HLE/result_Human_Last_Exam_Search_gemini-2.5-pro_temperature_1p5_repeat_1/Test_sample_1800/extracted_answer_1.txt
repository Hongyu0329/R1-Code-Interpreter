The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not the same for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting, with optimal ratios varying depending on the specific application and reaction conditions. For WGS, a Ni/Ce atomic ratio of approximately 1 or a Ni loading of 7-12.5 wt% is often optimal. For water splitting, the ideal ratio varies more widely, with some studies favoring higher ceria content or co-doping with other elements.
