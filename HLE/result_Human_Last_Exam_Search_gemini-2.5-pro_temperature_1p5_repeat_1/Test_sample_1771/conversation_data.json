    "The Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb *seh₂gieti, meaning \"'(s)he’s giving a sign',\" gives rise to reflexes in the Germanic languages through a series of regular sound changes. The root of this verb is *seh₂g-, which is related to the Latin *sāgīre* ('to be keen-nosed, perceive keenly') and the Hittite *sākizzi* ('gives a sign'). In Proto-Germanic, this root evolved into the verb **\\**sōkijaną***, meaning 'to seek' or 'to track down', a class 1 weak verb. The 3rd person singular present indicative form of this verb, corresponding to PIE *seh₂gieti, is reconstructed as **\\**sōkiþi***.\n\nFrom this Proto-Germanic form, we get the following descendants in Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German:\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic**: The reconstructed infinitive is **\\**sōkijaną*** and the 3rd person singular present indicative is **\\**sōkiþi***. This reconstruction is based on the PIE root *seh₂g-, where the PIE voiced stop *g became the voiceless stop *k through Grimm's Law, and the laryngeal *h₂ combined with the vowel *e* to become the long vowel *ō*.\n\n*   **Old Norse**: The reflex is **sǿkja** (with variants *sœkja* and *sækja*). The 3rd person singular present indicative is **sǿkir**. This form shows i-umlaut, where the back vowel *ō* in the root was fronted to *ǿ* due to the influence of the /i/ or /j/ in the following syllable.\n\n*   **Old English**: The corresponding verb is **sēċan** (also spelled *sēcean*). The 3rd person singular present indicative is **sēceþ** or **sēcþ**. In Old English, the Proto-Germanic *ō* also underwent i-umlaut, becoming *ē*. Furthermore, the Proto-Germanic *k* was palatalized to the affricate /tʃ/ (written as *ċ*) before the front vowel that caused the umlaut.\n\n*   **Old High German**: The verb appears as **suohhen** (or *suochen*). The 3rd person singular present indicative is **suohhit**. In Old High German, the Proto-Germanic *k* underwent the High German Consonant Shift, becoming the voiceless fricative /x/ (spelled *hh*) between vowels. The root vowel *ō* was also affected by i-umlaut, resulting in the diphthong *uo*.\n\n<<<The reflexes of the third-person singular present indicative of PIE *seh₂gieti are:\n*   Proto-Germanic: *\\*sōkiþi*\n*   Old Norse: *sǿkir*\n*   Old English: *sēceþ* (or *sēcþ*)\n*   Old High German: *suohhit*>>>"
