    "The lowest of the three final notes played by the first violin in the concluding moments of Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\" is G.\n\nAfter examining the full score of the symphony's final movement, \"Finale: Allegro con fuoco,\" it's clear that the first violins conclude with a three-note passage. The sequence of these notes is a B-flat, followed by a G, and culminating in a final B-flat. Of these three, the G is the lowest in pitch.\n\n<<<G>>>"
