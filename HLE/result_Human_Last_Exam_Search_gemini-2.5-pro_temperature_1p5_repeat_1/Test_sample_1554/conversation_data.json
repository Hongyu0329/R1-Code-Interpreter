    "Answering the user's request, the Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who breaks down the concept of a hallmark into symptoms and signals is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\nIn his work on language and the philosophy of language, Ajdukiewicz analyzed the relationship between sentences and the states of affairs they represent. He proposed that when one state of affairs suggests another, the first can be considered an \"indication, i.e. symptom\" of the second. An example of this would be the sentence, \"The barometer is falling, so it is going to rain,\" where the falling barometer is a symptom of impending rain.\n\nAjdukiewicz applied a similar analysis to signals, which he defined as artificially created phenomena that, through convention, lead to a conclusion about the occurrence of another event or to a particular action. Given that he characterized both indications (symptoms) and signals in a comparable manner, it is understood that he subsumed them under a broader, more general concept of a sign. This places the idea of a hallmark, as a distinguishing characteristic, within a semiotic framework where it can be understood through its symptomatic and signaling functions.\n\nKazimierz Twardowski, the founder of the Lviv-Warsaw School, also explored the nature of signs in his work, distinguishing between the external expression of a mental product and the mental product itself, which he termed the meaning of the sign. However, it is Ajdukiewicz who is specifically identified with the decomposition of signs into the categories of symptoms and signals.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
