    "To determine the smallest number N such that any integer greater than or equal to N can be written as a sum of distinct numbers of the form $2n^2+3n+1$, we first need to identify the set of these numbers.\n\nThe expression can be factored as $2n^2+3n+1 = (2n+1)(n+1)$. The question does not specify the domain for *n*. If we assume *n* to be a non-negative integer ($n \\ge 0$), the set of numbers is $\\{1, 6, 15, 28, 45, \\dots\\}$. These are the hexagonal numbers. However, it is standard in such problems to consider *n* to be any integer ($n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$), unless specified otherwise.\n\nLet's evaluate the expression for integer values of *n*:\n*   For $n \\ge 0$: $n=0 \\implies 1$; $n=1 \\implies 6$; $n=2 \\implies 15$; $n=3 \\implies 28$; ...\n*   For $n < 0$: Let $n = -k$ for $k \\ge 1$. The expression becomes $2(-k)^2+3(-k)+1 = 2k^2-3k+1 = (2k-1)(k-1)$.\n    *   $k=1 \\implies n=-1 \\implies 0$\n    *   $k=2 \\implies n=-2 \\implies (3)(1) = 3$\n    *   $k=3 \\implies n=-3 \\implies (5)(2) = 10$\n    *   $k=4 \\implies n=-4 \\implies (7)(3) = 21$\n    *   $k=5 \\implies n=-5 \\implies (9)(4) = 36$\n\nThe set of distinct, positive numbers generated by the formula for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is $\\{1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, \\dots\\}$. This is the set of all hexagonal numbers, often defined by the formula $H_k = k(2k-1)$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. For $k>0$, we get $\\{1, 6, 15, 28, \\dots\\}$, and for $k \\le 0$, we get $\\{0, 3, 10, 21, \\dots\\}$.\n\nThe problem then becomes finding the largest integer that cannot be expressed as a sum of distinct hexagonal numbers. Any integer larger than this \"Frobenius number\" for distinct summands can be represented, and the smallest such integer is our desired N.\n\nAccording to research on sums of distinct hexagonal numbers, the largest integer that cannot be written as a sum of distinct hexagonal numbers is 39. A paper by Harrington, Jones, and Lamarche, \"Representing integers as sums of distinct hexagonal numbers\" (2017), confirms this result.\n\nLet's verify this for a few numbers:\n*   **39**: To represent 39, we can use the hexagonal numbers $\\{1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36\\}$. A possible sum is $36+3=39$.\n*   **40**: A possible sum is $36+3+1=40$.\n\nBased on the referenced mathematical literature, every integer greater than 39 can be written as a sum of distinct hexagonal numbers. Therefore, the smallest number N such that any number $\\ge N$ has this property is 40.\n\n<<<40>>>"
