    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, often denoted as G₀, describes the propagation of a single particle in a system without interactions. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is fundamental to understanding the behavior of non-interacting systems and serves as a starting point for perturbative treatments of interacting systems.\n\nIn frequency-momentum space, the bare Green's function is a diagonal matrix. The functional form of the bare Green's function, G₀, in terms of the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k is typically expressed as:\n\n***G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη)***\n\nwhere:\n*   **ω** represents the frequency (or energy) of the particle.\n*   **k** is the momentum or wavevector of the particle.\n*   **ϵ_k** are the energy eigenvalues for a particle with momentum k, representing the energy-momentum dispersion relation of the single-particle states.\n*   **iη** is an infinitesimal imaginary term in the denominator, with η being a small positive real number. This term is crucial for defining the time-ordering of the Green's function and ensuring causality. For retarded Green's functions, the sign of this term is positive, while for advanced Green's functions, it is negative.\n\nThe significance of this functional form is that the poles of the bare Green's function correspond directly to the single-particle energy eigenvalues. In other words, when the energy ω of the propagating particle matches one of the allowed energy eigenvalues ϵ_k, the Green's function diverges, indicating a stable, non-interacting particle state at that energy. For a system with multiple non-interacting particles, the Green's function in the basis of the single-particle energy eigenstates is a diagonal matrix, where each diagonal element corresponds to a particular energy eigenstate. The entry for the i-th state is given by 1 / (ω - ϵ_i).\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G₀ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (energy) ω of the particle and the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k. Specifically, in frequency-momentum space, its functional form is G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη), where η is an infinitesimal positive constant that ensures proper time-ordering.>>>"
