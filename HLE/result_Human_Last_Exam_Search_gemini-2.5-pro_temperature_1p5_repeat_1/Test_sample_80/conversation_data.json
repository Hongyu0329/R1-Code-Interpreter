    "Answering the question requires determining two values: the total number of edge squares on a chessboard and the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on those squares.\n\nFirst, a standard chessboard has an 8x8 grid of squares. The edge squares are those that form the outer perimeter of the board. An 8x8 board has 8 squares on each of its four sides. To find the total number of edge squares, we can sum the squares on all four sides and subtract the four corner squares that are counted twice: (8 + 8 + 8 + 8) - 4 = 28. Alternatively, one can count the squares in the top and bottom rows (8 + 8 = 16) and the squares in the leftmost and rightmost columns, excluding the corners that have already been counted (6 + 6 = 12), for a total of 16 + 12 = 28 squares.\n\nNext, the problem is to find the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on these 28 edge squares so that no two bishops attack each other. Bishops attack along diagonals of the same color. The 28 edge squares are composed of 14 light-colored squares and 14 dark-colored squares. Since bishops on light squares do not attack bishops on dark squares, we can determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops for each color independently and then sum the results.\n\nFor the 14 dark edge squares, placing a bishop on each is not possible, as some of them share the same diagonals. For instance, the dark squares a1 and h8 are on the same diagonal and would, therefore, be able to attack each other. A detailed analysis of the attack possibilities for the 14 dark edge squares reveals that a maximum of 7 non-attacking bishops can be placed. Similarly, for the 14 light-colored edge squares, a maximum of 7 non-attacking bishops can be placed.\n\nTherefore, the total maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge squares of a chessboard is 7 (on dark squares) + 7 (on light squares) = 14. This number coincides with the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the entire 8x8 board.\n\nThe problem states that the players succeeded in placing the maximum possible number of bishops on the edge squares, which is 14.\n\nTo find the number of edge squares without bishops, we subtract the number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares:\n28 (total edge squares) - 14 (placed bishops) = 14.\n\nThus, 14 edge squares would lack bishops.\n\n<<<14>>>"
