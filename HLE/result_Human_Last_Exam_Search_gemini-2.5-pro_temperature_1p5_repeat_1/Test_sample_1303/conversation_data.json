    "The chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 is a small molecule that acts as an agonist for the integrin protein CD11b/CD18, also known as Mac-1 or complement receptor 3 (CR3). This protein is a heterodimer of the αM (CD11b) and β2 (CD18) subunits and plays a critical role in the adhesion, migration, and immune functions of leukocytes. Small molecules that activate Mac-1, like CHEMBL4803817, are part of a class of compounds called leukadherins.\n\nSeveral other small molecules have been identified that also interact with and modulate the activity of Mac-1. These molecules can be either agonists, which activate the protein, or antagonists, which block its function.\n\n**Small Molecule Agonists of Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18):**\n\n*   **Leukadherin-1 (LA1):** This is a well-characterized small-molecule agonist of Mac-1 that, like CHEMBL4803817, promotes the active conformation of the integrin. This increased activation enhances leukocyte adhesion, thereby reducing their migration to sites of inflammation.\n*   **ADH-503 (GB1275):** This is the salt form of Leukadherin-1 and is also a first-in-class allosteric modulator of CD11b.\n*   **LA3:** Another compound mentioned alongside LA1 as a leukadherin that reduces neointimal hyperplasia after vascular injury.\n\n**Other Small Molecule Ligands and Modulators:**\n\nBesides agonists, other types of small molecules are known to interact with Mac-1:\n\n*   **Esculin:** This molecule has been shown to inhibit β2 integrin-dependent neutrophil migration and chemotaxis, suggesting it interacts with Mac-1.\n*   **RO0505376:** While primarily mentioned as an antagonist of α4β1 integrin, the class of N-acylphenylalanine derivatives it belongs to is a significant group of small-molecule integrin antagonists.\n\nIt is important to note that Mac-1 also binds to larger biological molecules (ligands) as part of its normal function, including:\n\n*   Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1)\n*   Fibrinogen\n*   Vitronectin\n*   Complement component iC3b\n*   Factor X\n*   Heparin\n*   Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE)\n*   Junctional Adhesion Molecule-C (JAM-C)\n*   CD40L\n\nThe discovery and development of small molecules that modulate Mac-1 activity is an active area of research for treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.\n\n<<<The small molecules that will form some kind of protein-ligand interactions with the chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 are other small molecules that also bind to the Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) integrin. These include other leukadherins such as Leukadherin-1 (LA1), ADH-503 (GB1275), and LA3, as well as other small molecule modulators like esculin.>>>"
