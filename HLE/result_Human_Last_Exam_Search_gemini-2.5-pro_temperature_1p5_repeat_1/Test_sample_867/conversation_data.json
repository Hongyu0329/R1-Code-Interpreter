    "It is not possible to determine the exact number of sissone fermes performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the Act II Odette variation of the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre *Swan Lake* production choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich based on publicly available information.\n\nReviews and general information about this production confirm that Svetlana Zakharova danced the lead role of Odette-Odile. There are also mentions of a video recording of the Bolshoi's *Swan Lake* featuring Zakharova that was released in 2015, which would have been filmed around the 2014 period.\n\nHowever, the level of detail required to count a specific ballet step is not available in written reviews or articles. While there are several online videos titled as showing Svetlana Zakharova performing the Odette variation, it is not possible to definitively confirm that any of these are from the specific 2014 Grigorovich production. Furthermore, to provide an accurate count, a clear and complete video of the variation from the correct performance would be required for a detailed choreographic analysis. Such a video is not available through the search results.\n\nTherefore, a definitive and accurate count of the sissone fermes cannot be provided.\n\n<<<The information is not available through a web search.>>>"
