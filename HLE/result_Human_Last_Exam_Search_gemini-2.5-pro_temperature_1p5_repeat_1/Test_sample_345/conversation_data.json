    "The 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther was acquired by the Nationalgalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, in 1967. The museum purchased the artwork from the artist's widow, Maria Günther.\n\nThe painting, also known as \"Der Radionist\" or \"Kleinbürger am Radio\" (The Radio Addict / Petit Bourgeois by the Radio), is a notable work from the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) movement. It depicts a man, said to be a neighbor of the artist who was confined to a wheelchair, listening to the radio with headphones. The artwork is often interpreted as a commentary on the role of new media in society during the Weimar Republic.\n\nThe painting is listed with the inventory number A IV 134 at the museum. It has been featured in various exhibitions, including \"Splendor and Misery in the Weimar Republic\" at the Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt.\n\n<<<Nationalgalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin>>>"
