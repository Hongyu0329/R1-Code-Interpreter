    "An animal that might be able to hear human muscle twitches would need to be highly sensitive to very low-frequency sounds. Human muscle contractions, or twitches, generate sound in a low-frequency band, typically between 10 and 100 Hz.\n\nComparing the hearing abilities of the animals listed:\n\n*   **Dog:** The hearing range of a dog is approximately 40-67 Hz on the low end, which overlaps with the higher frequencies of muscle twitches. However, their specialization is in hearing higher frequencies.\n*   **Bat:** Bats are known for their exceptional high-frequency hearing, used for echolocation, often in the 15 kHz to 90 kHz range. Their low-frequency hearing is generally poor, and most cannot hear sounds below 1,000 Hz, well above the frequency of muscle twitches.\n*   **Whale:** Baleen whales, in particular, are adapted to hear very low-frequency sounds, with some able to hear as low as 7 Hz, which is well within the range of muscle twitches.\n*   **Human:** The typical human hearing range starts at 20 Hz, which means we can theoretically hear some of the frequencies produced by muscle twitches. However, the sound of a muscle twitch is extremely faint, and it is unlikely a human could hear another's twitch.\n*   **Herring:** This family of fish are known as \"hearing specialists\". They have a specialized connection between their swim bladder and inner ear that makes them exceptionally sensitive to low-frequency sounds and pressure waves. Their hearing range extends down to 30 Hz, and some can react to infrasonic sounds as low as 5 Hz. Studies note that herring have a uniformly low hearing threshold for frequencies between 30 and 1200 Hz.\n\nConsidering both the frequency range and exceptional sensitivity, the herring is a strong candidate. Their specialized hearing apparatus is adapted to detect faint, low-frequency vibrations in the water. Some fish are so sensitive they can detect the weak electrical potentials generated by the muscle contractions of nearby fish. This high sensitivity to faint, low-frequency signals makes the herring a plausible animal to detect the subtle sounds of muscle twitches.\n\n<<<C>>>"
