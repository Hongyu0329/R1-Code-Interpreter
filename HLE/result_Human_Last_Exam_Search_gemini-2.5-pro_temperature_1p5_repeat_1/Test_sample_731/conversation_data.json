    "To determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we first need to understand the structure of this group and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n### The Semidihedral Group of Size 512\n\nThe semidihedral group of order 2ⁿ, denoted SD₂ⁿ, is defined by the presentation:\nSD₂ⁿ = < r, s | r²ⁿ⁻¹ = s² = 1, srs = r²ⁿ⁻²⁻¹ >\n\nFor a size of 512, we have 2ⁿ = 512, which means n = 9. Thus, the semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as G = SD₅₁₂, has the presentation:\nG = < r, s | r²⁵⁶ = s² = 1, srs = r¹²⁷ >\n\nThe group G consists of 512 elements, which can be divided into two categories:\n1.  Elements in the cyclic subgroup <r>, which are of the form rⁱ for i = 0, 1, ..., 255.\n2.  Elements outside <r>, which are of the form rⁱs for i = 0, 1, ..., 255.\n\n### Power Subgroups\n\nA power subgroup of a group G for a given integer k is the subgroup generated by all the k-th powers of the elements of G. It is denoted by Gᵏ = < gᵏ | g ∈ G >. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed in this way for G = SD₅₁₂.\n\nLet's analyze the k-th powers of the elements of G.\n\n**Case 1: The element g is in the cyclic subgroup <r>.**\nIf g = rⁱ, then gᵏ = (rⁱ)ᵏ = rⁱᵏ. The subgroup generated by all such elements is <rᵏ>, which is equal to <rᵈ> where d = gcd(k, 256).\n\n**Case 2: The element g is of the form rⁱs.**\nWe first compute the square of such an element:\n(rⁱs)² = (rⁱs)(rⁱs) = rⁱ(srⁱs) = rⁱ(srs)ⁱ\nUsing the relation srs = r¹²⁷, we get:\n(rⁱs)² = rⁱ(r¹²⁷)ⁱ = rⁱr¹²⁷ⁱ = r¹²⁸ⁱ\n\nNow, we can find the k-th power of g = rⁱs.\n\n*   **If k is an even integer (k = 2m):**\n    gᵏ = (g²)ᵐ = (r¹²⁸ⁱ)ᵐ = r¹²⁸ⁱᵐ. Since k = 2m, this is r⁶⁴ⁱᵏ.\n    In this case, all k-th powers are elements of the cyclic subgroup <r>. The power subgroup Gᵏ is therefore a subgroup of <r>. It is generated by the set {rⁱᵏ} and {r⁶⁴ⁱᵏ}. This is equivalent to the subgroup generated by <rᵏ> and <r⁶⁴ᵏ>, which is <rᵍᶜᵈ(k, 256)> because gcd(k, 256) divides 64k. Since k is even, let k = 2ᵃq where q is odd and a ≥ 1. Then d = gcd(k, 256) = 2ᵐⁱⁿ(ᵃ,⁸). As a ≥ 1, d must be an even divisor of 256. The divisors of 256 are 2⁰, 2¹, ..., 2⁸. The even divisors are 2¹, 2², ..., 2⁸. These are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256. For each such divisor d, we can choose k=d to show that the subgroup <rᵈ> is a power subgroup. This gives us 8 distinct power subgroups: <r²>, <r⁴>, <r⁸>, <r¹⁶>, <r³²>, <r⁶⁴>, <r¹²⁸>, and <r²⁵⁶> (which is the trivial subgroup {e}).\n\n*   **If k is an odd integer:**\n    The subgroup generated by the powers { (rⁱ)ᵏ } is <rᵏ>. Since k is odd, gcd(k, 256) = 1, so <rᵏ> = <r>. The power subgroup Gᵏ also contains the element sᵏ = s (since k is odd). Therefore, Gᵏ contains both <r> and s. The subgroup generated by <r> and s is the entire group G.\n    Thus, for any odd integer k, Gᵏ = G. This gives one power subgroup: G itself.\n\n### Counting the Power Subgroups\n\nCombining the results from both cases:\n1.  For any odd k, we get one power subgroup: **G**.\n2.  For even k, we get eight distinct power subgroups which are all cyclic subgroups of <r>: **<r²>, <r⁴>, <r⁸>, <r¹⁶>, <r³²>, <r⁶⁴>, <r¹²⁸>, {e}**.\n\nIn total, the number of distinct power subgroups is 1 (from the odd powers) + 8 (from the even powers) = 9.\n\nThe set of power subgroups of the semidihedral group of size 512 is:\n{ G, <r²>, <r⁴>, <r⁸>, <r¹⁶>, <r³²>, <r⁶⁴>, <r¹²⁸>, {e} }\n\nThere are 9 power subgroups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
