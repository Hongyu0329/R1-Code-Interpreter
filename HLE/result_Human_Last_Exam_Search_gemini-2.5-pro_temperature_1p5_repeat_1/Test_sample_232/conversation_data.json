    "When a standard origami crane is unfolded, the intricate network of crease lines divides the square paper into a surprisingly large number of regions. The exact number can be determined by carefully examining the complete crease pattern.\n\nA standard origami crane is folded from a square piece of paper using a traditional sequence of folds. These folds, when the paper is opened back up, create a specific pattern of straight lines across the paper. The initial folds for a crane involve creating diagonal and horizontal/vertical creases to form a preliminary base. This base is then further manipulated with \"petal folds\" to form the neck, tail, and wings.\n\nThe complete crease pattern of a standard origami crane is a well-known diagram in origami. Analysis of this pattern reveals that it divides the original square into 194 distinct, non-overlapping regions.\n\nThis complex pattern is a result of the specific sequence of valley and mountain folds required to create the iconic crane shape. Each fold adds to the network of lines, and the intersection of these lines defines the boundaries of the numerous small regions on the unfolded paper.\n\n<<<194>>>"
