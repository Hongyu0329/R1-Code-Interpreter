    "In a standard surface code implementation, a pair of holes is utilized to encode a single logical qubit. Therefore, one patch of surface code with two holes can encode one logical qubit. Consequently, two such patches can encode a total of two logical qubits.\n\nIt's important to note that the number of logical qubits can be influenced by the specific type of holes and the boundary conditions of the surface code. For instance, creating \"holes\" or defects in the surface code generates additional degrees of freedom, allowing for the encoding of logical qubits. While a pair of \"smooth\" or \"rough\" punctures (holes) is typically used to encode one logical qubit, generalized surface codes exist where the relationship between holes and logical qubits can vary. In some configurations, it has been stated that a surface code with two closed holes encodes two logical qubits. However, the most common and direct implementation involves using two holes to define a single logical qubit, where one logical operator is a loop around a hole and the other is a path connecting the two holes.\n\nTherefore, based on the standard and most frequently described method, the answer is two logical qubits.\n\n<<<2>>>"
