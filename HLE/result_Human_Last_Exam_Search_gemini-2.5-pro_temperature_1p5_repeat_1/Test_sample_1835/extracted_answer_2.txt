Yes, based on the principles of Gareth Evans's Generality Constraint, if you understand the proposition *Fa*, you should be able to understand *Fx (âˆ€x)*, assuming you also have a grasp of universal quantification. The constraint implies that by understanding *Fa*, you possess a recombinable concept of the property 'F', which you can then deploy in the context of a universally quantified thought.
