    "The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of the first-order logic fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$, where the schema $S$ contains 4 unary predicates, is 4.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification:\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Logical Fragment\nThe provided logic, $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$, is a fragment of first-order logic.\n*   **Schema S**: Contains 4 unary predicates, let's call them $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A unary predicate describes a property of a single element.\n*   **Allowed Operators**:\n    *   $\\exists$: The existential quantifier.\n    *   $\\land$: Logical conjunction (AND).\n    *   $\\top, \\bot$: The logical constants for True and False.\n\nWe are interested in the complexity of *concepts* defined by this logic. A concept is specified by a formula with one free variable, say $\\phi(x)$. For a given model (a universe of elements and interpretations for the predicates), the formula $\\phi(x)$ defines the set of all elements in the universe for which the formula is true.\n\n### 2. Expressive Power of the Logic\nA key observation is the role of the existential quantifier in this specific logic. Since all predicates are unary, there are no predicates of the form $R(x, y)$ that can relate a free variable $x$ to a quantified variable $y$.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of any formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$. Any such formula can be shown to be logically equivalent to one of the form:\n$\\psi(x) \\land C$\n\nHere, $\\psi(x)$ is a *quantifier-free* formula with the free variable $x$, and $C$ is a *sentence* (a formula with no free variables).\n*   The quantifier-free part, $\\psi(x)$, is a conjunction of the atomic predicates, e.g., $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$.\n*   The sentence part, $C$, might be complex, like $\\exists y (P_2(y) \\land P_4(y))$. However, for any given model, $C$ evaluates to either true or false.\n\nIf the sentence $C$ is false in a model, the entire formula $\\phi(x)$ is false, and it defines the empty set. If $C$ is true, the formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\psi(x)$ and defines the same set as the quantifier-free part.\n\nSince the quantifier-free formulas themselves (e.g., $P_1(x) \\land P_2(x)$) are valid formulas in the logic, the set of all concepts that can be defined is precisely the set of concepts defined by the quantifier-free fragment. The existential quantifiers do not add the ability to create new concept shapes, they only act as a switch that can turn a concept \"on\" or \"off\" (to the empty set) depending on the model.\n\n### 3. VC Dimension of the Quantifier-Free Fragment\nThe quantifier-free formulas are conjunctions of the 4 unary predicates. In a model where the predicates $P_i$ are interpreted as sets $S_i$, the concepts are formed by intersections of these sets:\n$\\{\\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\}$\nThis collection of sets includes the entire universe (when taking the intersection over an empty index set, corresponding to the formula $\\top$) and the empty set (corresponding to $\\bot$).\n\nThe problem thus reduces to finding the VC dimension of the concept class formed by taking all possible intersections of 4 base sets. This is a standard result in computational learning theory. The VC dimension of a class of concepts formed by all intersections of $n$ sets is exactly $n$.\n\n### 4. Proof of VC Dimension = n\nTo show that the VC dimension is $n$ (where $n=4$ in this case), we must show two things:\n1.  **VC dimension is at least n**: We can construct a scenario where a set of size $n$ is shattered. Let the universe be a set of $n$ points, $X = \\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$. Define the base sets as $S_i = X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}$. For any desired subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we can form it by taking the intersection of the sets $S_j$ for all $x_j$ that are *not* in $Y$. This demonstrates we can shatter a set of size $n$.\n\n2.  **VC dimension is at most n**: The number of distinct concepts that can be generated is at most $2^n$, since there are $2^n$ possible subsets of the $n$ base sets to intersect. To shatter a set of size $m$, we must be able to generate all $2^m$ of its subsets. This requires $2^m \\le 2^n$, which implies $m \\le n$. Therefore, no set of size greater than $n$ can be shattered.\n\nSince the VC dimension is at least 4 and at most 4, it must be exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
