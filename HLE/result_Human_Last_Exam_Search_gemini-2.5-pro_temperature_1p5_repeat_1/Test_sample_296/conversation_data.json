    "The Grigorchuk group has a total of 7 subgroups of index 4.\n\nThese subgroups are all normal. The Grigorchuk group, denoted by *G*, is a finitely generated infinite 2-group. This means that every element in the group has an order that is a power of two. Any subgroup of index 4 gives rise to a quotient group of order 4. Since *G* is a 2-group, its quotients of order 4 must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group of order 4 (C4) or the Klein four-group (C2 × C2). Both of these are abelian.\n\nA key property of the Grigorchuk group is that its abelianization, the quotient group *G*/[*G*,*G*] where [*G*,*G*] is the commutator subgroup, is isomorphic to C2 × C2 × C2. This means there are 7 non-trivial homomorphisms from *G* to C2, and consequently, the Grigorchuk group has 7 subgroups of index 2, all of which are normal.\n\nFor subgroups of index 4, we consider homomorphisms from *G* onto transitive subgroups of the symmetric group S4. As *G* is a 2-group, the possible transitive subgroups are C4 and C2 × C2.\n\nThe number of normal subgroups with a quotient isomorphic to C2 × C2 is given by the number of epimorphisms from *G* onto C2 × C2, divided by the number of automorphisms of C2 × C2. Similarly, the number of normal subgroups with a quotient isomorphic to C4 is the number of epimorphisms from *G* onto C4 divided by the number of automorphisms of C4.\n\nA detailed analysis of the normal subgroup structure of the Grigorchuk group, as presented in the paper \"The Top of the Lattice of Normal Subgroups of the Grigorchuk Group\" by Tullio Ceccherini-Silberstein, Fabio Scarabotti, and Filippo Tolli, reveals that there are precisely 7 normal subgroups of index 4. All of these subgroups result in a quotient group isomorphic to C2 × C2. There are no normal subgroups with a quotient isomorphic to C4.\n\nFurthermore, any homomorphism from the Grigorchuk group to the dihedral group D8, the only non-abelian transitive 2-subgroup of S4, must be trivial. This implies there are no non-normal subgroups of index 4. Therefore, all 7 subgroups of index 4 are normal.\n\n<<<7>>>"
