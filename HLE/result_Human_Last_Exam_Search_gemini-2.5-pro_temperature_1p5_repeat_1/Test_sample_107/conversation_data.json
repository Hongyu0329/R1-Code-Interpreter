    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry for the given networks, we first need to summarize the two networks into a single, larger network, also known as a supernet.\n\nThe provided networks are:\n*   172.20.96.0/19\n*   172.20.128.0/19\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n1.  **Identify the address range of each network:**\n    *   A /19 subnet has a block size of 32 in the third octet (256 / 2^(19-16) = 256 / 8 = 32).\n    *   **Network 1 (172.20.96.0/19):** This network starts at 172.20.96.0 and its broadcast address is 172.20.127.255. The range is 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255.\n    *   **Network 2 (172.20.128.0/19):** This network starts at 172.20.128.0 and its broadcast address is 172.20.159.255. The range is 172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n\n2.  **Determine the total combined range:**\n    *   The combined range to be summarized is from the start of the first network to the end of the second network: **172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255**.\n\n3.  **Convert the starting and ending addresses to binary:**\n    We only need to focus on the third octet as the first two octets (172.20) are the same.\n    *   Start of range (96): `01100000`\n    *   End of range (159): `10011111`\n\n4.  **Find the common bits:**\n    To find the summary network, we look for the common bits from the left in the binary representation of the range.\n    *   `01100000`\n    *   `10011111`\n    *   In this case, the very first bit of the third octet is different (0 vs. 1). However, the networks are adjacent and can be combined into a larger block that starts at a lower address.\n\n5.  **Identify the supernet:**\n    Since the two /19 networks are contiguous, they form a single /18 block.\n    *   The starting address of this block is **172.20.96.0**.\n    *   A /18 network covers 16,384 addresses (2^14). The block size in the third octet is 64 (256 / 2^(18-16) = 256 / 4 = 64).\n    *   This /18 network ranges from 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255, which perfectly encapsulates the two given /19 networks.\n\n6.  **Determine the network address and wildcard mask:**\n    *   The summarized network is **172.20.96.0/18**.\n    *   The subnet mask for a /18 network is **255.255.192.0**.\n    *   To find the wildcard mask for an ACL, you subtract the subnet mask from 255.255.255.255.\n        *   255.255.255.255\n        *   - 255.255.192.0\n        *   -----------------\n        *   **0.0.63.255**\n\nThe smallest ACL entry that matches both networks is the summarized supernet.\n\n<<<172.20.96.0 0.0.63.255>>>"
