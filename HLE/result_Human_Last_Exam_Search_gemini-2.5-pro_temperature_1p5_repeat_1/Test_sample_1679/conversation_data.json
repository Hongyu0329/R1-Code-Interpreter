    "### \"An American in Paris\" First Best Picture Winner to Feature Luxor Obelisk\n\nThe 1951 film *An American in Paris* was the first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to depict the Luxor Obelisk on-screen. The iconic Parisian landmark is featured in the movie's opening sequence and is also represented in a lavish ballet sequence.\n\nThe film, a vibrant musical directed by Vincente Minnelli, opens with a montage of Parisian scenes to establish its setting. These include a live-action shot of the Place de la Concorde, where the Luxor Obelisk prominently stands.\n\nLater in the film, a celebrated 17-minute ballet sequence, conceived by and starring Gene Kelly, showcases a stylized representation of the Place de la Concorde. This set, inspired by the art of Raoul Dufy, includes a \"two-dimensional obelisk\" as a central element of its design. A prop oil painting depicting the Luxor Obelisk was also created for the film, though it was ultimately not used in the final cut.\n\nWhile other Best Picture winners, such as *Gigi* (1958), have also filmed at the Place de la Concorde, *An American in Paris* predates them, making it the first to feature the ancient Egyptian monument. Earlier winners of the Best Picture award were not found to have scenes filmed in Paris or Egypt that would include a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
