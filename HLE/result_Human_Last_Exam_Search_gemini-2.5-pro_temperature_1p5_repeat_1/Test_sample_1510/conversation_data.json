    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nThe crystallographic point groups are groups of geometric symmetries that leave at least one point fixed. Due to the crystallographic restriction theorem, in two dimensions, the point group of a wallpaper group must be one of the following ten groups: C1, C2, C3, C4, C6, D1, D2, D3, D4, or D6.\n\nA point group of order 2 corresponds to the cyclic group C2 or the dihedral group D1. C2 consists of a 2-fold (180Â°) rotation and the identity operation. D1 is composed of the identity operation and a single reflection.\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups are classified based on their symmetry properties, including their associated point group. The wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 are:\n\n*   **p2**: This group has a point group of C2. It contains 2-fold rotational symmetry but no reflections or glide reflections.\n*   **pm**: The point group for pm is D1. Its symmetries include reflections along parallel axes.\n*   **pg**: This group also has the point group D1. It is characterized by glide reflections.\n*   **cm**: The point group for cm is D1. It has reflections and glide reflections on axes that are parallel.\n\nTherefore, there is one wallpaper group with point group C2 and three wallpaper groups with point group D1, making a total of four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
