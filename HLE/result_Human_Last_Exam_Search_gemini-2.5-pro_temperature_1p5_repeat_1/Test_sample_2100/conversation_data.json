    "The man Andrei Voznesensky called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" was Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov.\n\nRezanov was a Russian nobleman, statesman, and an actual sailor who promoted the Russian colonization of Alaska and California. His journey to California led to a famous romance with Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the Spanish commandant of San Francisco. This story of \"the Russian Romeo\" became legendary in Russia and inspired works of poetry and opera.\n\nRezanov died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 while on his way back to St. Petersburg. For a long time, the location of his grave was a mystery. His original tomb was destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the 1930s. While some accounts state his remains were moved in the late 1950s, a memorial was dedicated at his presumed burial site in the Trinity churchyard of Krasnoyarsk on October 28, 2000, finally providing an answer to the question of his final resting place.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
