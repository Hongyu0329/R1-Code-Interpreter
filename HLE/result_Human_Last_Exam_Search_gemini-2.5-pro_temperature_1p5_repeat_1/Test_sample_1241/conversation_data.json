    "To find the long-term probabilities, we need to find the stationary distribution of the continuous-time Markov chain described by the given system of differential equations. This is achieved by setting the derivatives to zero, which signifies that the probabilities of being in each state are no longer changing over time.\n\nThe system of Kolmogorov-Chapman equations is as follows:\n$P_{0}'(t) = -0.019 P_{0}(t) + 0.65 P_{1}(t)$\n$P_{1}'(t) = 0.019 P_{0}(t) - (0.65 + 0.4) P_{1}(t) + 0.392 P_{2}(t) + 0.008 P_{3}(t)$\n$P_{2}'(t) = 0.4 P_{1}(t) - (0.392 + 0.008) P_{2}(t)$\n$P_{3}'(t) = 0.008 P_{2}(t) - 0.008 P_{3}(t)$\nwith the additional condition that the sum of probabilities is always equal to 1:\n$P_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1$\n\nLet $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$ represent the steady-state probabilities. At steady state, $P_i'(t) = 0$. The system then becomes a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1. $0 = -0.019 P_{0} + 0.65 P_{1}$\n2. $0 = 0.019 P_{0} - 1.05 P_{1} + 0.392 P_{2} + 0.008 P_{3}$\n3. $0 = 0.4 P_{1} - 0.4 P_{2}$\n4. $0 = 0.008 P_{2} - 0.008 P_{3}$\n5. $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n\nFrom equation (3), we can deduce that $P_1 = P_2$.\nFrom equation (4), we find that $P_2 = P_3$.\nTherefore, we have $P_1 = P_2 = P_3$.\n\nUsing equation (1), we can express $P_0$ in terms of $P_1$:\n$0.019 P_{0} = 0.65 P_{1} \\implies P_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_{1} = \\frac{650}{19} P_{1}$\n\nNow, we substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n$\\frac{650}{19} P_{1} + P_{1} + P_{1} + P_{1} = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19} + 3) P_{1} = 1$\n$\\frac{650 + 57}{19} P_{1} = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19} P_{1} = 1 \\implies P_{1} = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\nWith the value of $P_1$, we can find $P_0$:\n$P_{0} = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}$\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of $P_{0}(+\\infty)$ and $P_{1}(+\\infty)$:\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768$\n\n"
