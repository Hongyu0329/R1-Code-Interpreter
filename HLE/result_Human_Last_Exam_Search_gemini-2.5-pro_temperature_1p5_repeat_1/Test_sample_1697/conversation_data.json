    "The reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by the addition of methyl iodide, results in the formation of **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nThis reaction is a classic example of directed ortho-metalation (DoM). Here's a breakdown of the process:\n\n1.  **Directed Ortho-Metalation:** The first step involves the deprotonation of the aromatic ring by the strong base, sec-BuLi, which is enhanced by the additive TMEDA. The starting molecule has two directing metalation groups (DMGs): the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt2) at position 1 and the dimethylamino group (-NMe2) at position 3. Both of these groups direct the lithium to bond at the ortho position. The amide group directs to positions 2 and 6, while the amino group directs to positions 2 and 4. The position at C2 is ortho to both groups, making it the most acidic and the exclusive site for lithiation due to this synergistic effect. The sec-BuLi, coordinated to the heteroatoms of the directing groups, selectively removes the proton from the C2 position, forming an aryllithium intermediate.\n\n2.  **Electrophilic Quench:** In the second step, methyl iodide (CH‚ÇÉI) is added. The highly nucleophilic carbon-lithium bond at the C2 position attacks the electrophilic methyl group of the methyl iodide. This results in the substitution of the lithium atom with a methyl group.\n\nThe final product is therefore N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
