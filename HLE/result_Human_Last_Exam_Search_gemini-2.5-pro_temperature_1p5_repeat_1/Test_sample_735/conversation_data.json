    "Based on the research paper \"Locally maximal product-free sets of size 3\" by C. S. Anabanti and S. B. Hart, a finite group that contains a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3 must have an order of 24 or less. The paper provides a complete classification of these groups.\n\nThe finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3 are listed in a table within the aforementioned research, which is reproduced in several related publications. Counting the distinct groups from this table gives the total number.\n\nThe groups listed are:\n*   **Abelian Groups:**\n    *   Cyclic groups: C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C12\n    *   Direct products of cyclic groups: C2 x C2, C2 x C4, C3 x C3\n*   **Non-Abelian Groups:**\n    *   Dihedral groups: D6 (isomorphic to S3), D8, D10, D12\n    *   Quaternion group: Q8\n    *   Alternating group: A4\n    *   Special linear group: SL(2,3)\n    *   Other: C2 x A4, Q24 (Dicyclic group of order 24)\n\nCounting these distinct groups reveals there are 12 abelian groups and 9 non-abelian groups. In total, there are 21 such finite groups.\n\n<<<21>>>"
