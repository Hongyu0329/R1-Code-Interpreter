    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action, often denoted as $a_2$, is a crucial component in understanding the geometric and physical properties encoded within the spectral action. For a massless gauged Dirac spinor field in a four-dimensional Riemannian manifold, this coefficient is computed from the square of the Dirac operator, $D^2$. The heat kernel expansion is an asymptotic expansion of the trace of the heat kernel, $\\text{Tr}(e^{-tD^2})$, for small $t$. The expansion is given by:\n\n$\\text{Tr}(e^{-tD^2}) \\sim \\frac{1}{(4\\pi t)^2} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} t^n \\int_M d^4x \\sqrt{g} \\, a_{2n}(x)$\n\nHere, $a_2(x)$ is the local second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient.\n\nThe square of the massless gauged Dirac operator, $D = \\gamma^\\mu (\\partial_\\mu + iA_\\mu)$, where $A_\\mu$ is the gauge field (a Lie algebra-valued 1-form), can be expressed as:\n\n$D^2 = - (g^{\\mu\\nu}\\nabla_\\mu\\nabla_\\nu + E)$\n\nwhere $\\nabla_\\mu$ is the full covariant derivative acting on spinors, and the endomorphism $E$ is given by:\n\n$E = -\\frac{1}{4}R \\cdot \\mathbb{I} - \\frac{i}{2} \\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu F_{\\mu\\nu}$\n\nHere, $R$ is the Ricci scalar, $\\mathbb{I}$ is the identity in the spinor space, $\\gamma^\\mu$ are the gamma matrices, and $F_{\\mu\\nu} = \\partial_\\mu A_\\nu - \\partial_\\nu A_\\mu + i[A_\\mu, A_\\nu]$ is the field strength of the gauge connection.\n\nThe general formula for the local Seeley-DeWitt coefficient $a_2(x)$ for an operator of the form $-(\\nabla^2 + E)$ in four dimensions is:\n\n$a_2(x) = \\text{tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{2}E^2 + \\frac{1}{6}RE + \\frac{1}{12}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu} + \\frac{1}{180}(R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} - R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} + \\frac{5}{2}R^2)\\mathbb{I} \\right)$\n\nwhere the trace is taken over the spinor indices. For a Dirac spinor in 4 dimensions, the dimension of the spinor space is 4.\n\nBy substituting the expression for $E$ for the squared Dirac operator and performing the trace over the gamma matrices (using identities such as $\\text{tr}(\\mathbb{I})=4$, $\\text{tr}(\\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu) = 4g^{\\mu\\nu}$, and $\\text{tr}(\\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu\\gamma^\\rho\\gamma^\\sigma) = 4(g^{\\mu\\nu}g^{\\rho\\sigma} - g^{\\mu\\rho}g^{\\nu\\sigma} + g^{\\mu\\sigma}g^{\\nu\\rho})$), we obtain the second coefficient. The calculation yields contributions from both the gravitational background and the gauge field.\n\nAfter performing the necessary algebra and taking the traces, the final expression for the second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field in four dimensions is:\n\n<<<$\\frac{1}{24}R^2 - \\frac{1}{120}R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{7}{360}R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} - \\frac{1}{6}\\text{tr}(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu})$>>>"
