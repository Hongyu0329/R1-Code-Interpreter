    "A Pauli channel, denoted by $\\Lambda$, acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit), is a quantum channel that applies a random generalized Pauli operator to the qudit's density matrix, $\\rho$. The action of the channel can be described by the following mapping:\n\n$\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{j=0}^{d^2-1} p_j P_j \\rho P_j^\\dagger$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\{P_j\\}$ is the set of $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators for a $d$-dimensional system. These operators form an orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\n*   $p_j$ are probabilities that satisfy $p_j \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{j=0}^{d^2-1} p_j = 1$.\n*   The operators $A_j = \\sqrt{p_j} P_j$ are the Kraus operators of the channel.\n\nThe complementary channel, $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, describes the information that is leaked to the environment during the operation of the channel $\\Lambda$. The rank of the complementary channel is determined by the rank of a matrix $C$ whose elements are given by the inner products of the Kraus operators of the original channel:\n\n$C_{ij} = \\text{Tr}(A_i^\\dagger A_j)$\n\nFor a Pauli channel, the Kraus operators are $A_j = \\sqrt{p_j} P_j$. Therefore, the matrix elements of $C$ are:\n\n$C_{ij} = \\text{Tr}((\\sqrt{p_i} P_i)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_j} P_j)) = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(P_i^\\dagger P_j)$\n\nThe generalized Pauli operators $\\{P_j\\}$ are orthogonal, meaning that $\\text{Tr}(P_i^\\dagger P_j) = d \\cdot \\delta_{ij}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the qudit system and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. As a result, the matrix $C$ is a diagonal matrix:\n\n$C_{ij} = d\\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\delta_{ij}$\n\nThe rank of this diagonal matrix $C$ is equal to the number of its non-zero diagonal elements. A diagonal element $C_{jj} = d \\cdot p_j$ is non-zero if and only if the corresponding probability $p_j$ is greater than zero.\n\nTo find the maximal rank of the complementary channel, we need to maximize the number of non-zero probabilities $p_j$. Since the only constraint on the probabilities is that they must be non-negative and sum to one, it is possible for all $d^2$ probabilities to be strictly greater than zero. For example, we could choose $p_j = 1/d^2$ for all $j=0, 1, ..., d^2-1$.\n\nIn this case, all $d^2$ diagonal elements of the matrix $C$ would be non-zero. Therefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
