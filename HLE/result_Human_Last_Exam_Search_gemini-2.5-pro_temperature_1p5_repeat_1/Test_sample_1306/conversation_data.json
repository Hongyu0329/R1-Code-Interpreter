    "When considering the representation theory of the quantum group $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ for $q$ being a primitive root of unity, the structure of the category of its finite-dimensional representations is significantly more complex than in the generic case (when $q$ is not a root of unity). For a primitive third root of unity, $q = e^{2\\pi i/3}$, the category of finite-dimensional representations is not semisimple, meaning there exist indecomposable representations that are not irreducible.\n\nTo determine the percentage of indecomposable objects that are irreducible, we must first understand the classification of all indecomposable finite-dimensional representations. The representation theory of $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ at a root of unity is best understood by decomposing the category of representations into blocks based on the characters of the center of the algebra, which is significantly larger than in the generic case.\n\nThe classification of these representations yields two main types of blocks:\n\n1.  **A finite number of \"principal\" or \"tame\" blocks:** For $q=e^{2\\pi i/3}$, the principal block contains a finite number of simple (irreducible) objects. For the third root of unity, these are the representations $L_1$ (trivial, dimension 1) and $L_2$ (dimension 2). However, this block is of tame representation type, which implies that it contains a countably infinite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations. These additional indecomposable modules are extensions of the simple ones and are therefore reducible.\n\n2.  **A continuum of \"semisimple\" blocks:** The remaining blocks are indexed by a continuous set of parameters, corresponding to \"generic\" central characters. Each of these blocks is semisimple and, in fact, contains only a single simple object. An object in such a block is therefore both irreducible and indecomposable, and also projective. The number of these blocks is uncountably infinite, corresponding to the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nLet $C$ be the set of isomorphism classes of all indecomposable finite-dimensional $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ representations. Let $C_{irr} \\subset C$ be the subset of irreducible representations.\n\n*   The set of irreducible objects $C_{irr}$ consists of the two simple modules from the principal block and the uncountably infinite number of simple modules from the semisimple blocks. Thus, the cardinality of $C_{irr}$ is $|C_{irr}| = 2 + \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   The set of all indecomposable objects $C$ consists of all objects in $C_{irr}$ plus the countably infinite set of reducible indecomposable objects from the principal block. Therefore, the cardinality of $C$ is $|C| = |C_{irr}| + \\aleph_0 = \\mathfrak{c} + \\aleph_0 = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nTo find the percentage of objects in $C$ that are irreducible, we can compare the cardinalities of $C_{irr}$ and $C$. The set of reducible indecomposable objects has cardinality $\\aleph_0$, while the set of irreducible objects has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. Since $\\aleph_0$ is a lower order of infinity than $\\mathfrak{c}$, the reducible objects are \"negligible\" in comparison to the irreducible ones.\n\nThe percentage is therefore given by the ratio of these cardinalities. Since both sets have the same cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$, the ratio is 1.\n\nThus, 100% of the objects in the category $C$ are irreducible.\n\n<<<100>>>"
