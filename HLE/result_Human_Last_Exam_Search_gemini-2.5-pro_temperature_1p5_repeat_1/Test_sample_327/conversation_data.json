    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number 13/16 in red-blue-Hackenbush, one must find the most \"economical\" way to construct a game with this value. In combinatorial game theory, the value of a red-blue-Hackenbush game is a surreal number; for finite games, this value is always a dyadic rational (a fraction with a power of 2 in the denominator).\n\nThe value of a game can be represented as a sum of simpler games. The most efficient representation often corresponds to the Non-Adjacent Form (NAF) or canonical signed-digit representation of the number, which minimizes the number of non-zero terms in its binary expansion.\n\nFirst, let's express 13/16 in different ways as a sum or difference of powers of two:\n1.  **Standard Binary Expansion:** 13/16 = 8/16 + 4/16 + 1/16 = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/16. This corresponds to the binary `0.1101`.\n2.  **Using Subtraction:** We can also write `13/16 = 1 - 3/16 = 1 - (2/16 + 1/16) = 1 - 1/8 - 1/16`.\n3.  **Non-Adjacent Form (NAF):** The number 13 can be written as `16 - 4 + 1`. Dividing by 16, we get `13/16 = 1 - 1/4 + 1/16`. This representation has the same number of terms as the others but may result in a more economical game construction.\n\nThe total number of pieces is the sum of the pieces required for each term in the representation. The number of pieces for these basic game values is as follows:\n*   **G(1):** An integer game `n` is represented by `|n|` pieces of the corresponding color. G(1) is a single red piece.\n*   **G(2⁻ⁿ):** A game with value `1/2ⁿ` (for `n>0`) is constructed as a stack of `n` blue pieces on top of a single red piece. This requires `n+1` pieces.\n*   **G(-2⁻ⁿ):** A game with value `-1/2ⁿ` is the negative of G(2⁻ⁿ) and is constructed by swapping the colors. It consists of a stack of `n` red pieces on a single blue piece, also requiring `n+1` pieces.\n\nNow we calculate the total number of pieces for each representation of 13/16:\n\n**Method 1: 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/16**\n*   G(1/2) or G(2⁻¹): 1 blue on 1 red = 2 pieces.\n*   G(1/4) or G(2⁻²): 2 blue on 1 red = 3 pieces.\n*   G(1/16) or G(2⁻⁴): 4 blue on 1 red = 5 pieces.\n*   **Total: 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 pieces.**\n\n**Method 2: 1 - 1/8 - 1/16**\n*   G(1): 1 red piece = 1 piece.\n*   G(-1/8) or G(-2⁻³): 3 red on 1 blue = 4 pieces.\n*   G(-1/16) or G(-2⁻⁴): 4 red on 1 blue = 5 pieces.\n*   **Total: 1 + 4 + 5 = 10 pieces.**\n\n**Method 3: 1 - 1/4 + 1/16**\n*   G(1): 1 red piece = 1 piece.\n*   G(-1/4) or G(-2⁻²): 2 red on 1 blue = 3 pieces.\n*   G(1/16) or G(2⁻⁴): 4 blue on 1 red = 5 pieces.\n*   **Total: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 pieces.**\n\nComparing the three methods, the representation `1 - 1/4 + 1/16` requires the fewest pieces. This game consists of three disjoint components: a single red stalk, a stack of two red pieces on a blue piece, and a stack of four blue pieces on a red piece.\n\n*   **Red pieces:** 1 (from G(1)) + 2 (from G(-1/4)) + 1 (from G(1/16)) = 4 red pieces.\n*   **Blue pieces:** 1 (from G(-1/4)) + 4 (from G(1/16)) = 5 blue pieces.\n\nThe total number of pieces needed is 4 + 5 = 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
