    "Answering the question of how many \"pas de Balanchine\" Svetlana Gileva performed in the Jete Woman solo of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" with the Semperoper Ballett in 2015 is not possible with the available online information.\n\nSvetlana Gileva was a principal dancer with the Semperoper Ballett and performed this specific role in 2015. The \"Jete Woman\" solo is a recognized segment of the ballet. The term \"pas de Balanchine,\" while not a formal ballet step, is understood in the dance world to refer to a specific, quick, and propulsive sequence often used by Forsythe, which has been described as a \"viral\" combination in some circles.\n\nHowever, to provide a precise number of these steps would require a visual analysis of the specific 2015 performance. While videos of Svetlana Gileva performing this solo were uploaded to YouTube by the Semperoper Ballett, the content is no longer available. The search results do not contain any written choreographic analysis or detailed description that quantifies the number of times this specific movement is executed. Therefore, a definitive count cannot be provided.\n\n<<<It is not possible to determine the exact number based on publicly available information.>>>"
