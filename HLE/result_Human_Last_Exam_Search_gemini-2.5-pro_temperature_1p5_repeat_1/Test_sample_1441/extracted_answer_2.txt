In scalar field theories below the upper critical dimension of four, the critical exponent for specific heat, α, scales with the spatial dimensionality, d, according to the epsilon expansion. To first order in ε = 4 - d, the relationship is given by **α = (4 - n) / (2(n + 8)) * ε**, where 'n' is the number of components of the scalar field.
