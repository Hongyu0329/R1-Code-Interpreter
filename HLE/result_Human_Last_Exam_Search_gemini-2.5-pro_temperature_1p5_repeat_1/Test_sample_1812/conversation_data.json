    "To compute the determinant of the given matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nwe can use the standard formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\ndet(A) = 2 * ((2 * 2) - (-1 * -1)) - (-1) * ((-1 * 2) - (-1 * -1)) + (-1) * ((-1 * -1) - (2 * -1))\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * 3 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6\ndet(A) = 0\n\nAlternatively, one can notice that the sum of the entries in each row (and each column) is zero. For any square matrix, if the sum of its rows or columns is a zero vector, it means the rows or columns are linearly dependent. A matrix with linearly dependent rows or columns is singular, and therefore its determinant is zero.\n\nThe information regarding the \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" is contextual and does not change the fact that the problem explicitly provides the matrix A for which the determinant must be calculated.\n\n<<<0>>>"
