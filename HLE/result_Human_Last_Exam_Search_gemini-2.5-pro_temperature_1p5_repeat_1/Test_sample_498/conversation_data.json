    "The sequence `ZXXCVYBN` does not follow a simple alphabetical or mathematical pattern. The letters, however, are found on a standard QWERTY keyboard.\n\nUpon examination of a QWERTY keyboard, the letters `Z`, `X`, `C`, `V`, `B`, and `N` are all located on the bottom row. The sequence given is an arrangement of these keys.\n\nA common and logical interpretation of this specific sequence is that it represents the bottom row of keys on a QWERTY keyboard, but with an error in the user's provided sequence. The standard bottom row of letters is `Z, X, C, V, B, N, M`. The provided sequence is `ZXXCVYBN`.\n\nIt's highly likely the sequence should be `Z, X, C, V, B, N`, which are the first six letters on the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard in order from left to right. Following this pattern, the next letter would be `M`.\n\n<<<M>>>"
