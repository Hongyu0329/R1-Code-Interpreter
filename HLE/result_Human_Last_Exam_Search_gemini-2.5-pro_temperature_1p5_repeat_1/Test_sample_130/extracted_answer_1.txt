As the operator is applied iteratively, the edges of the image will smooth out, with sharp corners becoming rounded. This process is analogous to motion by mean curvature, where convex boundaries shrink and concave boundaries expand. Over time ($t\rightarrow\infty$), any isolated shapes will shrink and ultimately vanish, causing the image to converge to a constant state, either entirely black or entirely white.
