    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern and the residues occupying the core hydrophobic positions.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Heptad Repeat\n\nCoiled-coil proteins contain a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern, known as a heptad repeat, designated by the letters `abcdefg`. The stability of the coiled-coil structure is primarily driven by the packing of hydrophobic amino acid side chains at the 'a' and 'd' positions into a hydrophobic core. This specific interaction is called \"knobs-into-holes\" packing, where a residue from one helix (the \"knob\") fits into a cavity (the \"hole\") formed by side chains on the adjacent helix.\n\nThe provided sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence to find the repeating pattern where hydrophobic residues (like I, L, A, W) are consistently in the 'a' and 'd' positions. The hydrophobic residues are spaced with a characteristic `h-x-x-h` pattern, which corresponds to `a-b-c-d` or `d-e-f-g-a`. This means there are two and three residues separating the core positions.\n\nBy aligning the sequence, we can deduce the heptad registration. A plausible registration that places consistently hydrophobic residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions is as follows:\n\nSequence:     `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\nHeptad pos:         `f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c`\n\nThis alignment reveals a consistent pattern for the core positions:\n\n*   **'a' positions**: Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Leucine (L)\n*   **'d' positions**: Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I)\n\n### 2. Applying Knobs-into-Holes Packing Rules\n\nThe specific identity of the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions is a major determinant of the oligomeric state of the coiled coil. Seminal studies using the GCN4 coiled coil as a model system established these rules:\n\n*   **Dimeric Coiled Coils (2 helices)**: These are commonly formed when isoleucine (I) is at the 'a' position and leucine (L) is at the 'd' position. The β-branched side chain of isoleucine packs efficiently against the γ-branched side chain of leucine.\n*   **Trimeric Coiled Coils (3 helices)**: These are often favored when the core positions are occupied by isoleucine or other hydrophobic residues in a more symmetrical arrangement.\n*   **Tetrameric Coiled Coils (4 helices)**: These are favored when the arrangement is reversed from that of a dimer, with leucine (L) at the 'a' position and isoleucine (I) at the 'd' position. This \"switched\" arrangement results in a different packing geometry that is most stable in a four-helix bundle.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn the given sequence, `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, the core 'a' positions are all occupied by Leucine (L), and the 'd' positions are all occupied by Isoleucine (I). According to the established principles of knobs-into-holes packing and packing efficiency, this specific arrangement strongly favors the formation of a tetrameric (four-stranded) coiled-coil.\n\nTherefore, the most probable oligomeric state for this protein sequence is 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
