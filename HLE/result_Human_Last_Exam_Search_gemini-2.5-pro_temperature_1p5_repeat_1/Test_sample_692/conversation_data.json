    "### The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is \"1 Earthquake,\" which dates to approximately 600 BCE.\n\nThis significant inscription was discovered at the Zapotec site of San José Mogote in the Oaxaca Valley of Mexico. The date is carved on a stone monument, known as Monument 3, which depicts a slain captive. Between the figure's legs are two glyphs that have been interpreted as his name, \"1 Earthquake,\" a day in the 260-day ritual calendar used by Mesoamerican civilizations.\n\nInitially, the monument's dating was based on associated archaeological layers, but more recent radiocarbon dating has confirmed its age to no later than 630–560 BCE. This makes it one of the earliest examples of writing in Mesoamerica and the earliest recorded calendrical date.\n\nOther contenders for the earliest writing include the Olmec civilization. The Cascajal Block, an Olmec artifact dated to around 900 BCE, contains glyphs, but it is debated whether they represent a true writing system, and they do not appear to record a date. Another Olmec artifact, a cylinder seal from San Andrés, dates to approximately 650 BCE and may contain the calendrical glyph \"3 Ajaw\". However, the interpretation of these symbols as writing has been subject to more scholarly debate compared to the Zapotec monument.\n\nFurther solidifying the Zapotec claim, the writing system on Monument 3 is considered a precursor to later, more complex scripts developed by civilizations like the Maya, Mixtec, and Aztec.\n\nWhile later civilizations like the Maya developed a highly sophisticated Long Count calendar, the earliest known date from that system is found on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, which corresponds to 36 BCE, significantly later than the Zapotec inscription. Therefore, the Zapotec carving of \"1 Earthquake\" from San José Mogote remains the earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas.\n\n<<<1 Earthquake>>>"
