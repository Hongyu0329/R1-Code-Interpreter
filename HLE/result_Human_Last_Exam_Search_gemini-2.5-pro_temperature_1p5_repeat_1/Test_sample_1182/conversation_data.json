    "The stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers has one double point.\n\nHere is a summary of the reasoning:\n1.  **Initial Curve and Genus**: The given curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2, since the degree of the polynomial in x is 5.\n\n2.  **Change of Variables**: To analyze the reduction of the curve modulo 2, we perform a change of variables. The transformation $x = 8X$ and $y = 8Y$ simplifies the equation to:\n    $Y^2 = X + X^2 + 32X^3 + 256X^4 + 4096X^5$\n    This new model is defined over the 2-adic integers.\n\n3.  **Reduction Modulo 2**: Reducing the new equation modulo 2 gives:\n    $\\bar{Y}^2 = \\bar{X}^2 + \\bar{X}$\n    This reduced curve over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is smooth (it has no singular points).\n\n4.  **Genus of the Reduced Curve**: The genus of this reduced curve is 0, as the polynomial in $\\bar{X}$ has degree 2. This means the reduced curve is a rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n\n5.  **Type of Reduction**: The original curve has genus 2, while the special fiber of its regular model has genus 0. This drop in genus indicates that the curve has bad, but potentially good, reduction. Specifically, this scenario implies that the Jacobian of the curve has good reduction.\n\n6.  **Stable Reduction**: According to the theory of stable reduction for genus 2 curves, when the special fiber of the minimal regular model is a smooth rational curve (a $\\mathbb{P}^1$), the stable reduction consists of two elliptic curves intersecting transversally at a single point. This single intersection point is an ordinary double point, also known as a node.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the given curve has exactly one double point.\n\n<<<1>>>"
