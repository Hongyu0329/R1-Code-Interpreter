    "For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), the total number of contracted Gaussian functions is calculated as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms in Toluene (C7H8):**\n    *   7 Carbon (C) atoms\n    *   8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\n2.  **Determine the number of contracted basis functions for each atom with the 6-31G basis set:**\n    *   **For each Carbon atom:** The 6-31G basis set uses 1 function for the core (1s) orbital and splits the four valence orbitals (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz) into two sets of functions each. This results in a total of 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 contracted functions per carbon atom.\n    *   **For each Hydrogen atom:** The 1s valence orbital is split into two contracted functions.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total number of functions:**\n    *   Contribution from Carbon: 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n    *   Contribution from Hydrogen: 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n    *   **Total:** 63 + 16 = 79 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n<<<79>>>"
