    "A single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print does not appear to exist. While several species of mushrooms exhibit a blue coloration in their fruiting bodies, their spore prints are of different colors.\n\nSome of the well-known blue-colored mushrooms include:\n*   **_Lactarius indigo_ (Indigo Milk Cap):** This mushroom is a striking indigo blue but produces a cream to yellowish-cream spore print.\n*   **_Entoloma hochstetteri_ (Blue Pinkgill):** Found in New Zealand, this vibrant blue mushroom has a reddish-pink spore print. The genus _Entoloma_ is commonly referred to as \"pinkgills.\"\n*   **_Stropharia caerulea_ (Blue Roundhead):** This species has a blue-green cap and produces a purple-brown or purple-black spore print.\n*   **_Polyozellus multiplex_ (Blue Chanterelle):** These blue to purple mushrooms have a white spore print.\n*   **_Clitocybe nuda_ (Wood Blewit):** This mushroom has a blue to violet hue when young, but its spores are pale pink.\n\nBased on available mycological information, no mushroom has been identified as having a distinctly blue spore print. The color of a mushroom's spores is a key characteristic for identification and typically ranges from white, cream, and pink to brown, purple, and black.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
