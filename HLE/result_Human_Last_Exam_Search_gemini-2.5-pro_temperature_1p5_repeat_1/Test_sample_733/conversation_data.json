    "Based on a complete classification provided in the paper \"Small maximal sum-free sets\" by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart, there are 19 finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. The term \"sum-free\" used in the paper is equivalent to \"product-free\" when applied to general groups.\n\nThe classification theorem in the paper lists the groups in three tables, along with two specific group-set pairs which do not introduce new groups to the list. By compiling the groups from these tables and removing duplicates and accounting for isomorphisms (such as D₆ ≅ S₃ and D₁₂ ≅ S₃ × C₂), the following 19 unique groups are identified:\n\n**Abelian Groups (11 groups):**\n*   C₂ × C₂ (also known as V₄, the Klein-four group)\n*   C₄\n*   C₅\n*   C₆\n*   C₇\n*   C₈\n*   C₁₀\n*   C₁₂\n*   C₂ × C₄\n*   C₂ × C₆\n*   C₂ × C₂ × C₂\n\n**Non-Abelian Groups (8 groups):**\n*   D₆ (Dihedral group of order 6, isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃)\n*   D₈ (Dihedral group of order 8)\n*   D₁₀ (Dihedral group of order 10)\n*   D₁₂ (Dihedral group of order 12)\n*   A₄ (Alternating group on 4 elements)\n*   Q₈ (Quaternion group of order 8)\n*   Q₁₂ (Dicyclic group of order 12)\n*   Q₁₆ (Generalized quaternion group of order 16)\n\nFor instance, in the cyclic group of order 4, C₄ = {e, a, a², a³}, the set S = {a, a³} is a maximal product-free set of size 2. It is product-free because the products of its elements (a², a⁴=e) are not in S. It is maximal because the only other elements are *e* and *a²*; including *e* would make the set not product-free (a*e=a), and including *a²* would also make it not product-free (a*a=a²). Similarly, in the Klein-four group V₄ = {e, a, b, c}, the set S = {a, b} is a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nThe exhaustive list compiled from the classification paper shows there are exactly 19 such finite groups.\n\n<<<19>>>"
