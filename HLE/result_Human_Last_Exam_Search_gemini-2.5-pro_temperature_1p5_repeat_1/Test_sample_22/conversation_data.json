    "True.\n\nThe predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS), which is quantified by the proportion of phenotypic variance it can account for, is inherently limited by the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability of the trait.\n\nSNP heritability represents the total proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by the additive effects of all common SNPs considered in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). In theory, if the effects of all these SNPs were known precisely and without error, a polygenic score constructed from this information could explain a proportion of the phenotype's variance equal to the SNP heritability.\n\nHowever, in practice, the variance explained by a polygenic score is almost always lower than the SNP heritability. This discrepancy, often called the \"missing heritability gap,\" arises from several factors:\n\n*   **Imperfect Effect Size Estimates:** The effect sizes of SNPs used to build the polygenic score are estimated from GWAS data, which have a limited sample size and are therefore subject to error.\n*   **Methodological Limitations:** The statistical methods used to construct polygenic scores have their own limitations.\n*   **Sample Differences:** Differences between the sample used for the initial GWAS (base data) and the sample in which the polygenic score is being tested (target data) can also reduce predictive power.\n\nFor example, for ADHD, the SNP heritability is estimated to be 21.6%, but the best-performing polygenic score for ADHD explains a maximum of 5.5% of the variance. Similarly, polygenic scores for cognitive traits like general cognitive ability and educational attainment explain around 7% and 11% of the variance, respectively, which is below their estimated heritabilities.\n\nTherefore, the SNP heritability serves as the theoretical maximum predictive power for a polygenic score.\n\n<<<True>>>"
