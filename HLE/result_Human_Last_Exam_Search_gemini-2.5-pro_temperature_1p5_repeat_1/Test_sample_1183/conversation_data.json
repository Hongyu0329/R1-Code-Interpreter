    "I am sorry, but the provided SMILES string \"C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67\" appears to be for a complex and likely hypothetical molecule. A search for this specific structure did not yield any readily available information about its common name or its symmetry group. Chemical databases do not have an entry for this exact SMILES string.\n\nTo determine the symmetry group of a molecule, a 3D model is typically required to visualize its rotational axes, mirror planes, and inversion center. Without a clear identification or a visual representation of the molecule, it is not possible to definitively assign a symmetry group.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide the symmetry group for the molecule represented by the given SMILES string.\n\n<<<Unknown>>>"
