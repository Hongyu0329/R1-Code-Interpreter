    "The symmetry factor associated with a Feynman diagram is a crucial element in perturbative calculations, correcting for the overcounting of diagrammatically identical contributions from Wick's theorem. The calculation of this factor depends on the precise topology of the diagram in question.\n\nThe phrase \"a Feynman diagram featuring two vertices and four field contractions\" can be interpreted in a few ways. Assuming the context of a common scalar field theory like λφ⁴ theory, where each vertex involves four field operators, the most direct interpretation is a vacuum diagram with two vertices connected by four propagators (internal lines). In this theory, to have four field contractions (propagators) originating from two vertices, all four lines from each vertex must be connected to the other, leaving no external lines.\n\nThe symmetry factor, S, is the order of the group of automorphisms of the diagram, which represents the number of permutations of vertices and internal lines that leave the diagram's topology unchanged. For this specific diagram—two vertices connected by four propagators—the symmetry factor is calculated as follows:\n\n*   **Vertex Symmetry:** The two vertices are indistinguishable. They can be interchanged without altering the diagram. This contributes a factor of 2! = 2.\n*   **Propagator Symmetry:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are also identical. They can be permuted among themselves in 4! ways. This results in a factor of 4! = 24.\n\nThe total symmetry factor is the product of these individual symmetry factors:\n\nS = (Vertex Symmetry) × (Propagator Symmetry) = 2 × 24 = 48.\n\nThis can also be confirmed using the general formula for a real scalar field theory: S = g * Πₙ(n!)^αₙ. Here, *g* is the number of vertex permutations (g=2), and αₙ is the number of sets of *n* identical lines connecting the same two vertices. For this diagram, there is one set (α₄=1) of four lines (n=4). This yields S = 2 * (4!)¹ = 48.\n\nA numerical factor of 1/48 for a similar vacuum diagram is also mentioned in calculations within Wikipedia's entry on Feynman diagrams, confirming this result.\n\n<<<48>>>"
