    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which involves forming a compound matrix and reducing it to its row-echelon form using elementary row operations.\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n**Step 1: Form the compound matrix M(s) by stacking P1 and P2.**\n\nM(s) =\n[ s^2 + s,  -s   ]  (Row 1)\n[ -s^2 - 1, s^2  ]  (Row 2)\n[ s,        0    ]  (Row 3)\n[ -s - 1,   1    ]  (Row 4)\n\n**Step 2: Perform elementary row operations to simplify the matrix.**\n\nOur goal is to use row operations to transform M(s) into a simpler form. The non-zero rows of the final matrix will form the GCRD. We will use the notation `Ri` to represent the i-th row.\n\nLet's use the '1' in the fourth row (R4) at position (4,2) to create zeros in the second column of other rows.\n\n*   **Operation 1: R1_new = R1 + s * R4**\n    *   `[s^2 + s, -s] + s * [-s - 1, 1] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s] = [0, 0]`\n\n*   **Operation 2: R2_new = R2 - s^2 * R4**\n    *   `[-s^2 - 1, s^2] - s^2 * [-s - 1, 1] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, s^2 - s^2] = [s^3 - 1, 0]`\n\nAfter these operations, the matrix M(s) becomes:\n\nM'(s) =\n[ 0,        0    ]\n[ s^3 - 1,  0    ]  (Row 2')\n[ s,        0    ]  (Row 3')\n[ -s - 1,   1    ]  (Row 4')\n\n**Step 3: Continue with row reduction on the simplified matrix.**\n\nLet's now focus on the non-zero rows of M'(s). We can see that the first column of Row 2' can be simplified using Row 3'.\n\n*   **Operation 3: R2' _new = R2' - s^2 * R3'**\n    *   `[s^3 - 1, 0] - s^2 * [s, 0] = [s^3 - 1 - s^3, 0] = [-1, 0]`\n\nThe matrix now looks like this:\n\nM''(s) =\n[ 0,      0    ]\n[ -1,     0    ]  (Row 2'')\n[ s,      0    ]  (Row 3'')\n[ -s - 1, 1    ]  (Row 4'')\n\nNow, let's use the new Row 2'' (`[-1, 0]`) to simplify the other rows.\n\n*   **Operation 4: R3''_new = R3'' + s * R2''**\n    *   `[s, 0] + s * [-1, 0] = [s - s, 0] = [0, 0]`\n\n*   **Operation 5: R4''_new = R4'' - (s+1) * R2''**\n    *   `[-s - 1, 1] - (s+1) * [-1, 0] = [-s - 1 + s + 1, 1] = [0, 1]`\n\nThe matrix is now:\n\nM'''(s) =\n[ 0,  0 ]\n[ -1, 0 ]\n[ 0,  0 ]\n[ 0,  1 ]\n\n**Step 4: Finalize the row-echelon form.**\n\nTo obtain the final form, we can swap the non-zero rows and multiply the row `[-1, 0]` by -1.\n\nThe set of non-zero rows is ` {[-1, 0], [0, 1]} `.\nMultiplying the first row by -1 gives `{[1, 0], [0, 1]}`.\n\nArranging these as a matrix gives the identity matrix.\n\nThe greatest common right divisor is the matrix formed by the non-zero rows in the final row-echelon form.\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
