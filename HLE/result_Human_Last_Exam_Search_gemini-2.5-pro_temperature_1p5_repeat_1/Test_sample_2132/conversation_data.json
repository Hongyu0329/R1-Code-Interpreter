    "The Böttcher Molecular Complexity of the product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone cannot be calculated directly by this service, as it requires specialized software. However, the identity of the product and the process to determine its complexity can be detailed.\n\nThe Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone results in a ring contraction from a six-membered ring to a five-membered ring. When the reaction is carried out using a base such as sodium ethoxide in ethanol, the product is **ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate**. The chemical structure and SMILES string for this product are provided below.\n\n**Product of the Favorskii Rearrangement:**\n\n*   **Name:** Ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₈H₁₄O₂\n*   **Structure:**\n    ![Image of ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate molecule](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/image/imgsrv.fcgi?cid=79550&t=l)\n*   **SMILES String:** `CCOC(=O)C1CCCC1`\n\n**Böttcher Molecular Complexity (C_m):**\n\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity is a metric that quantifies the complexity of a molecule based on information theory. It calculates an additive complexity index, denoted as C_m, by assessing the information content of the microenvironment of each atom in the molecule. This index is sensitive to various structural features, including stereochemistry, heteroatoms, and symmetry.\n\n**Calculation of the Böttcher Score:**\n\nThe Böttcher complexity for a given molecule can be determined using specialized software or web-based tools. The Forli lab at the Scripps Institute provides a public web service for this purpose. To find the Böttcher Molecular Complexity of ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate, its SMILES string (`CCOC(=O)C1CCCC1`) can be used as input for such a calculator.\n\nWithout the ability to run the calculation, a precise numerical value cannot be provided in this response.\n\n<<<The Böttcher Molecular Complexity of ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate, the product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone, must be calculated using specialized software. The SMILES string for the product is CCOC(=O)C1CCCC1.>>>"
