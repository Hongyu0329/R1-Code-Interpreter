    "A finite group *G* is called a **filled group** if the union of all its maximum by inclusion product-free sets is equal to *G*. A product-free set is a subset of a group where no two elements (including an element with itself) multiply to produce another element within the subset.\n\nThe classification of finite filled nilpotent groups has been established in the paper \"Groups whose locally maximal product-free sets are complete\" by C.S. Anabanti, S.B. Hart, and C.E. Whitehead. According to their research, a finite nilpotent group is a filled group if and only if it is one of the following:\n\n*   The cyclic group of order 3, denoted as C₃.\n*   The cyclic group of order 5, denoted as C₅.\n*   A finite 2-group.\n\nA finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. The classification implies that for a filled nilpotent group, the only possible prime factors for its order are 2, 3, and 5. Furthermore, if the order is divisible by 3 or 5, the group must be the simple cyclic group C₃ or C₅, respectively. If the group's order is a power of 2 (a 2-group), it is a filled group.\n\nThis result builds upon the classification of finite abelian filled groups, which are C₃, C₅, or elementary abelian 2-groups (groups where every non-identity element has order 2). For non-abelian nilpotent groups, the condition of being filled restricts the group to be a 2-group.\n\nIn summary, the finite filled nilpotent groups are precisely the finite 2-groups and the cyclic groups C₃ and C₅.\n\n<<<A finite nilpotent group G is a filled group if and only if G is a 2-group, the cyclic group of order 3, or the cyclic group of order 5.>>>"
