    "The given integral equation is:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} u(y) dy$, for $0 \\le x \\le 1$.\n\nThis is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The kernel of the integral, $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$, can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:\n$K(x, y) = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + \\dots + xy^{n-2} + y^{n-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$.\n\nThis type of kernel is known as a degenerate or separable kernel. The integral equation can be rewritten as:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\int_{0}^{1} y^k u(y) dy$.\n\nLet's define a set of constants $c_k$ as the moments of the function $u(y)$:\n$c_k = \\int_{0}^{1} y^k u(y) dy$, for $k=0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nSubstituting these constants back into the equation for $u(x)$, we see that the solution must be a polynomial in $x$ of degree at most $n-1$:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}$.\n\nTo find the constants $c_j$, we substitute this expression for $u(y)$ back into the definition of $c_j$:\n$c_j = \\int_{0}^{1} y^j \\left(1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k}\\right) dy$\n$c_j = \\int_{0}^{1} y^j dy + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\int_{0}^{1} y^{j+n-1-k} dy$\n$c_j = \\frac{1}{j+1} + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_k}{j+n-k}$.\n\nThis can be rearranged into a system of $n$ linear equations for the $n$ unknown constants $c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}$:\n$c_j - \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{j+n-k} c_k = \\frac{1}{j+1}$, for $j = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nThis system can be written in matrix form as $(I - \\lambda A) \\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$, where:\n*   $\\mathbf{c}$ is the column vector of the unknown constants $[c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}]^T$.\n*   $\\mathbf{b}$ is the column vector $[1, 1/2, 1/3, \\dots, 1/n]^T$.\n*   $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix with entries $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$.\n*   $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this system of linear equations (and thus the original integral equation) has no solution if the matrix $(I - \\lambda A)$ is singular, and the vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is not in the column space of $(I - \\lambda A)$.\n\nThe matrix $(I - \\lambda A)$ is singular if its determinant is zero. This occurs when $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix $A$. Let $\\mu = 1/\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $A$.\n\nFor these values of $\\lambda$, a solution exists only if the vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is orthogonal to all the vectors in the null space of the adjoint matrix $(I - \\lambda A)^T$. This null space is spanned by the left eigenvectors of $A$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\mu$. If for a left eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}$ of $A$ corresponding to $\\mu$, the condition $\\mathbf{v}^T \\mathbf{b} \\neq 0$ is met, then no solution exists.\n\nCalculations for small values of $n$ (like $n=1$ and $n=2$) show that this condition for inconsistency is met for all eigenvalues of the matrix $A$.\n*   For **n=1**, the equation becomes $u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 u(y)dy$. Solving this gives $u(x) = 1/(1-\\lambda)$, which has no solution for $\\lambda=1$. The matrix A is simply $$, its only eigenvalue is 1, so $\\lambda=1/1=1$.\n*   For **n=2**, the equation is $u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 (x+y)u(y)dy$. The values of $\\lambda$ for which no solution exists are found to be $\\lambda = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$. These are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1 \\\\ 1/3 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nBased on these results and the general structure of the problem, it is concluded that for any eigenvalue of the matrix $A$, the condition for inconsistency holds. Therefore, the integral equation has no solution for values of $\\lambda$ that are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$.\n\nThe values of $\\lambda$ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ whose elements are given by $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$, for $j, k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\n<<<The values of $\\lambda$ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ with entries $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$ for $j,k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.>>>"
