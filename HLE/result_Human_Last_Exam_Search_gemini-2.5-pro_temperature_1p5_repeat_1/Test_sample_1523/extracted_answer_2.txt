In finite-temperature field theory, for a neutral scalar field, the inner product of (ϕ, D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the Euclidean action for the free field. This is expressed as the integral of ϕ multiplied by the action of the operator D_ϕ on ϕ over Euclidean spacetime. The operator D_ϕ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator, -∂² + m², where ∂² is the four-dimensional Euclidean Laplacian. The inner product is explicitly written as: (ϕ, D_ϕϕ) = ∫ d⁴x ϕ(x) (-∂² + m²) ϕ(x), where the integration is over the Euclidean spacetime volume V_E = βV, with β being the inverse temperature and V the spatial volume.
