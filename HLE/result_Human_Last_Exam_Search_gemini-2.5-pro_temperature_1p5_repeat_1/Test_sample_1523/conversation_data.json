    "In the framework of finite-temperature field theory, the partition function for a neutral scalar field, denoted by ϕ, is expressed through a functional integral over all possible field configurations. The general form of this representation is:\n\nZ = ∫ Dϕ *exp*(-S<sub>E</sub>[ϕ])\n\nHere, S<sub>E</sub>[ϕ] represents the Euclidean action of the scalar field. For a free, neutral scalar field with mass *m*, the Euclidean action is given by:\n\nS<sub>E</sub>[ϕ] = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup>dτ ∫d<sup>3</sup>x [ 1/2(∂<sub>τ</sub>ϕ)<sup>2</sup> + 1/2(∇ϕ)<sup>2</sup> + 1/2m<sup>2</sup>ϕ<sup>2</sup> ]\n\nwhere:\n*   β = 1/T is the inverse temperature.\n*   τ is the imaginary time, and the integration is performed over the interval [0, β].\n*   **x** represents the spatial coordinates.\n*   ∂<sub>τ</sub> is the derivative with respect to the imaginary time.\n*   ∇ is the spatial gradient operator.\n\nThis action can be expressed in a more compact quadratic form which defines the inner product.\n\nThe inner product of (ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>) in the context of the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field is fundamentally the Euclidean action S<sub>E</sub>[ϕ] for a free field. It can be written as:\n\n(ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>ϕ) = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup>dτ ∫d<sup>3</sup>x ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> - ∇<sup>2</sup> + m<sup>2</sup>) ϕ(τ, **x**)\n\nThis expression is often written in a shorthand notation:\n\nS<sub>E</sub>[ϕ] = 1/2 (ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>ϕ)\n\nIn this formulation, the operator D<sub>ϕ</sub> is the Klein-Gordon operator in Euclidean spacetime, which is given by:\n\nD<sub>ϕ</sub> = -∂<sup>2</sup> + m<sup>2</sup>\n\nwhere ∂<sup>2</sup> = ∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> + ∇<sup>2</sup> is the Laplacian in four-dimensional Euclidean space.\n\nThe inner product is therefore implicitly defined by the integral over Euclidean spacetime of the field ϕ multiplied by the result of the operator D<sub>ϕ</sub> acting on ϕ.\n\nFor a non-interacting (free) scalar field, the action in the exponent of the partition function is quadratic in the fields. This allows the functional integral to be performed, leading to a result proportional to the inverse square root of the determinant of the operator D<sub>ϕ</sub>.\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory, for a neutral scalar field, the inner product of (ϕ, D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the Euclidean action for the free field. This is expressed as the integral of ϕ multiplied by the action of the operator D_ϕ on ϕ over Euclidean spacetime. The operator D_ϕ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator, -∂² + m², where ∂² is the four-dimensional Euclidean Laplacian. The inner product is explicitly written as: (ϕ, D_ϕϕ) = ∫ d⁴x ϕ(x) (-∂² + m²) ϕ(x), where the integration is over the Euclidean spacetime volume V_E = βV, with β being the inverse temperature and V the spatial volume.>>>"
