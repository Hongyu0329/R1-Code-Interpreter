    "The volume of the intersection of the two cubes is 1/8.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the initial cube:** Let the first cube, C1, be the standard unit cube in a Cartesian coordinate system. This cube is defined by the set of points (x, y, z) where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ z ≤ 1.\n\n2.  **Understand the shift:** The main diagonal of this cube connects opposite vertices, for instance, the origin (0,0,0) and the point (1,1,1). The vector representing this diagonal is (1,1,1). The problem states that the second cube is shifted by 1/2 along this main diagonal. This is interpreted as a displacement by the vector (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n3.  **Define the second cube:** The second cube, C2, is the first cube translated by the shift vector. Therefore, C2 is defined by the inequalities:\n    *   0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2  or  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n    *   0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2  or  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n    *   0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2  or  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n\n4.  **Determine the intersection:** The volume of the intersection is the region where a point (x, y, z) satisfies the inequalities for both cubes. To find this region, we find the intersection of the coordinate ranges for each axis:\n    *   **x-axis:** The intersection of and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1].\n    *   **y-axis:** The intersection of and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1].\n    *   **z-axis:** The intersection of and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1].\n\n5.  **Calculate the volume of the intersection:** The resulting intersection is a smaller cube defined by 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1, 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1, and 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1. The side length of this new cube is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The volume of a cube is the side length cubed, so the volume of the intersection is:\n    Volume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\nThis result holds regardless of which of the four main diagonals of the cube is chosen for the shift.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
