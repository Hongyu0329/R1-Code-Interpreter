    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. In this type of reaction, a strong, sterically hindered base like potassium tert-butoxide abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (beta) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n\nFor an E2 reaction to occur in a cyclohexane system, the leaving group (bromine) and the beta-hydrogen to be removed must be in a *trans-diaxial* (or anti-periplanar) orientation. Let's analyze the chair conformations of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, which is a *trans* isomer.\n\n1.  The most stable chair conformation would have both the bulky bromine and methyl groups in equatorial positions. However, for the E2 elimination to proceed, the bromine atom must occupy an axial position.\n2.  Therefore, the molecule must adopt its less stable conformation, where the bromine atom is axial. In this *trans* isomer, when the bromine is axial, the methyl group on the adjacent carbon is also forced into an axial position.\n3.  With the bromine atom axial, we must look for beta-hydrogens that are also in an axial position.\n    *   **At carbon 2 (C2):** The methyl group is in the axial position, which means the hydrogen on C2 is in the equatorial position. Since this hydrogen is not axial, it cannot be eliminated along with the axial bromine. Therefore, the formation of 1-methylcyclohexene (the more substituted Zaitsev product) is not possible through the E2 mechanism.\n    *   **At carbon 6 (C6):** This carbon has an axial hydrogen which is *trans-diaxial* to the axial bromine on C1.\n4.  The bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide, will abstract this available axial hydrogen from C6. This results in the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\nDue to these stereochemical constraints, the reaction can only proceed in one direction, overriding the usual regiochemical rules (Zaitsev's rule). The resulting product is the less substituted alkene.\n\nThe name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
