    "**Alexander of Hales** is the Christian theologian credited with first developing the specialized terminology of **\"obediential potency\"** (*potentia obedientiae*), which can be applied to describe changes in the laws of nature in the context of both the virgin birth of Jesus and the altered state of natural laws after the Fall.\n\nLiving in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, Alexander of Hales was a pivotal figure in the early scholastic period at the University of Paris. While the conceptual groundwork for his ideas was laid by earlier theologians, most notably Augustine of Hippo who wrote about creation's inherent capacity to obey God's will, it was Alexander who first systematically used the term \"obediential potency\" in his influential work, the *Summa Theologica* (now commonly known as the *Summa Fratris Alexandri*).\n\nThis terminology was developed to explain how created nature possesses a passive capacity to be acted upon by God in ways that transcend its own natural powers, without being a violation of its nature. This concept is directly applicable to:\n\n*   **The Virgin Birth:** The virgin birth is understood as a miracle where Mary's body, through its obediential potency, was capable of conceiving and giving birth to Jesus by the power of the Holy Spirit, an event beyond the ordinary laws of human reproduction. Theologians explain such miraculous events by appealing to a creature's obediential potency to God's will.\n\n*   **Changes in Natural Laws at the Fall:** The state of humanity before the Fall, in a state of \"original justice,\" included preternatural gifts such as bodily immortality and integrity (harmony between reason and desires). These were not natural to humans but were possible because human nature has an obediential potency to receive such gifts from God. The loss of these gifts at the Fall represents a change in the operative \"laws\" governing human nature.\n\nLater prominent theologians, including St. Bonaventure and St. Thomas Aquinas, adopted and further developed the concept of obediential potency, but Alexander of Hales and the authors of the *Summa* attributed to him are recognized for being the first to systematically employ this specific terminology.\n\n<<<Alexander of Hales>>>"
