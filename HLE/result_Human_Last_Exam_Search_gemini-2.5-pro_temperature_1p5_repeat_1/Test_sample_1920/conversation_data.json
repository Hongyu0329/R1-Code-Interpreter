    "First, I will find the prime factorization of $d = 53599$.\nBased on the search results, the prime factorization of $53599$ is $7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ of order 6 can be written as a product of a character $\\chi_2$ of order 2 and a character $\\chi_3$ of order 3. For $\\chi$ to be a primitive character of conductor $d = d_2 d_3$, the characters $\\chi_2$ and $\\chi_3$ must be primitive characters with conductors $d_2$ and $d_3$ respectively, where $d_2$ and $d_3$ are coprime, i.e., $\\gcd(d_2, d_3) = 1$.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of order 2 and conductor $n$ is non-zero only if $n$ is of the form $4$, $8$, $p^*$, or products of these, where $p^* = (-1)^{(p-1)/2} p$ for an odd prime $p$. More simply, a primitive real character (order 2) modulo $d_2$ exists if and only if $d_2$ is not a perfect square and is not twice a perfect square, which means $d_2$ is a fundamental discriminant. The number of such characters is given by $2^{\\omega(d_2)-1}$ if $d_2$ is odd, and some other formulas for even $d_2$. Here, all prime factors are odd.\nFor an odd conductor $d_2>1$, the number of primitive characters of order 2 is $2^{\\omega(d_2)-1}$, where $\\omega(d_2)$ is the number of distinct prime factors of $d_2$. If $d_2=1$, there are no primitive characters of order 2.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of order 3 and conductor $d_3$ is non-zero only if $d_3$ is of the form $9$, $p$ or $p^2$ where $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, or products of these. For a conductor $d_3$ that is a product of distinct primes $p_i \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ or $p_i=7, 13, 19, 31$, the number of primitive characters of order 3 is $2^{\\omega(d_3)}$. Each prime factor $p$ such that $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ contributes 2 characters of order 3.\n\nThe prime factors of $d=53599$ are 7, 13, 19, and 31.\nLet's check the condition $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ for each prime factor:\n*   $7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n*   $13 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n*   $19 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n*   $31 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\nAll four prime factors are congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nWe need to partition the set of prime factors $\\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$ into two sets, one for the conductor $d_2$ and one for the conductor $d_3$. Let $S = \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$.\nA character of order 6, $\\chi$, is a product $\\chi_2\\chi_3$ where $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character of order 2 and conductor $d_2$, and $\\chi_3$ is a primitive character of order 3 and conductor $d_3$. The conductor of $\\chi$ is $d = d_2 d_3$, and $\\gcd(d_2, d_3) = 1$. This means the sets of prime factors of $d_2$ and $d_3$ are disjoint, and their union is $S$.\n\nFor each prime factor $p$ of $d$, it must be a factor of either $d_2$ or $d_3$.\n\nLet $\\omega_2 = \\omega(d_2)$ be the number of distinct prime factors of $d_2$ and $\\omega_3 = \\omega(d_3)$ be the number of distinct prime factors of $d_3$. Since $d=d_2d_3$ and $\\gcd(d_2,d_3)=1$, we have $\\omega_2 + \\omega_3 = 4$.\n\nThe number of primitive characters of order 2 with conductor $d_2 > 1$ (which is always the case here as we partition the primes) is $2^{\\omega_2-1}$.\nThe number of primitive characters of order 3 with conductor $d_3$ (where all prime factors are $\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$) is $2^{\\omega_3}$. Since a character and its conjugate have order 3, this is correct.\n\nWe sum over all possible partitions of the set of prime factors:\nThe number of ways to choose $\\omega_2$ prime factors for $d_2$ from the 4 available prime factors is $\\binom{4}{\\omega_2}$. For each such choice, the remaining $\\omega_3 = 4 - \\omega_2$ primes form $d_3$.\n\nThe possible values for $\\omega_2$ are from 1 to 4. $\\omega_2$ cannot be 0, as there is no primitive character of order 2 with conductor 1. Similarly, $\\omega_3$ must be at least 1.\n\nCase 1: $\\omega_2 = 1, \\omega_3 = 3$\nNumber of ways to choose 1 prime for $d_2$: $\\binom{4}{1} = 4$.\nFor each choice, number of characters of order 2: $2^{1-1} = 1$.\nThe remaining 3 primes form $d_3$, so $\\omega_3=3$. Number of characters of order 3: $2^3=8$.\nTotal for this case: $4 \\times 1 \\times 8 = 32$.\n\nCase 2: $\\omega_2 = 2, \\omega_3 = 2$\nNumber of ways to choose 2 primes for $d_2$: $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$.\nNumber of characters of order 2: $2^{2-1} = 2$.\nThe remaining 2 primes form $d_3$. Number of characters of order 3: $2^2=4$.\nTotal for this case: $6 \\times 2 \\times 4 = 48$.\n\nCase 3: $\\omega_2 = 3, \\omega_3 = 1$\nNumber of ways to choose 3 primes for $d_2$: $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$.\nNumber of characters of order 2: $2^{3-1} = 4$.\nThe remaining 1 prime forms $d_3$. Number of characters of order 3: $2^1=2$.\nTotal for this case: $4 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 32$.\n\nCase 4: $\\omega_2 = 4, \\omega_3 = 0$\nThis case is not possible because there are no primitive characters of order 3 with conductor 1.\n\nThe total number of primitive Dirichlet characters of order 6 is the sum of the counts from all possible valid partitions.\nTotal = $32 + 48 + 32 = 112$.\n\nFor each choice of $d_2$ and $d_3$, we have a certain number of pairs $(\\chi_2, \\chi_3)$. For each such pair, the product $\\chi_2 \\chi_3$ is a character of order 6 and conductor $d=d_2 d_3$. Also we need to consider the character $\\chi_2 \\chi_3^2$. The order of $\\chi_3^2$ is also 3. So for each $\\chi_3$ there is another character $\\chi_3^2$ of order 3.\nThe number of characters of order 3 is indeed $2^{\\omega_3}$ since for each of the $\\omega_3$ primes there are 2 choices of character of order 3. Let $p_1, ..., p_{\\omega_3}$ be the prime factors of $d_3$. For each $p_i$, there are two primitive characters of order 3. Let them be $\\psi_i, \\psi_i^2$. Then any character of the form $\\prod_{i=1}^{\\omega_3} \\phi_i$ where $\\phi_i \\in \\{\\psi_i, \\psi_i^2\\}$ is a primitive character of order 3 and conductor $d_3$. There are $2^{\\omega_3}$ such characters. So the calculation is correct.\n\nLet me double check the number of primitive characters.\nNumber of primitive quadratic characters with conductor $n > 1$: If $n$ is a fundamental discriminant, the number of primitive quadratic characters is 1. If we are talking about characters modulo $n$, we have to be more careful.\nA primitive character of order 2 has a conductor of the form $4$, $8$, or an odd prime $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ or $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. A product of such coprime conductors also gives a conductor for a primitive character. A conductor for a primitive real character is a fundamental discriminant. All the prime factors of 53599 are odd. The number of real primitive characters modulo $d_2$ where $d_2$ is a product of $\\omega_2$ distinct odd primes is 1. I need to be more precise about the source of the formula for the number of characters.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the number of primitive characters.\nThe group of characters modulo $d$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$.\nFor a prime $p$, the group of characters mod $p$ is cyclic of order $p-1$.\nThe number of primitive characters of order $k>2$ with conductor $p$ is $\\phi(k)$.\nThe number of primitive characters of order 3, conductor $p$ (where $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$) is $\\phi(3)=2$.\nFor $d_3 = p_1 \\cdots p_{\\omega_3}$, where each $p_i \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, a primitive character mod $d_3$ is a product of primitive characters mod $p_i$. The number of primitive characters of order 3 conductor $d_3$ is $2^{\\omega_3}$. So this part is correct.\n\nNow for the characters of order 2. These are the real characters. The number of primitive real characters is the number of fundamental discriminants.\nLet $d_2 = p_1 \\cdots p_{\\omega_2}$. This is a fundamental discriminant. For each such $d_2 > 1$, there is exactly one primitive real character, the Kronecker symbol $(\\frac{d_2}{\\cdot})$. For $d_2 = 1$ there are no primitive real characters.\nSo, my previous formula of $2^{\\omega_2-1}$ was incorrect. Let's re-calculate.\n\nCase 1: $\\omega_2 = 1, \\omega_3 = 3$\nNumber of ways to choose 1 prime for $d_2$: $\\binom{4}{1} = 4$.\nNumber of primitive characters of order 2: 1.\nThe remaining 3 primes form $d_3$. Number of primitive characters of order 3: $2^3=8$.\nTotal for this case: $4 \\times 1 \\times 8 = 32$.\n\nCase 2: $\\omega_2 = 2, \\omega_3 = 2$\nNumber of ways to choose 2 primes for $d_2$: $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$.\nNumber of primitive characters of order 2: 1.\nThe remaining 2 primes form $d_3$. Number of primitive characters of order 3: $2^2=4$.\nTotal for this case: $6 \\times 1 \\times 4 = 24$.\n\nCase 3: $\\omega_2 = 3, \\omega_3 = 1$\nNumber of ways to choose 3 primes for $d_2$: $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$.\nNumber of primitive characters of order 2: 1.\nThe remaining 1 prime forms $d_3$. Number of primitive characters of order 3: $2^1=2$.\nTotal for this case: $4 \\times 1 \\times 2 = 8$.\n\nCase 4: $\\omega_2 = 4, \\omega_3 = 0$\nThis case is not possible.\n\nCase 5: $\\omega_2 = 0, \\omega_3 = 4$.\n$d_2=1, d_3=d=53599$.\nNumber of primitive characters of order 2 for $d_2=1$: 0.\nSo this case does not contribute.\n\nA primitive character of order 6 must be of the form $\\chi_2 \\chi_3$ where $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character of order 2, and $\\chi_3$ is a primitive character of order 3. The conductor of $\\chi_2\\chi_3$ is $d_2d_3$ if $\\gcd(d_2, d_3)=1$. The order of $\\chi_2\\chi_3$ is $\\operatorname{lcm}(2,3)=6$.\nHowever, the problem is about primitive characters of order 6. This can also be $\\chi_2 \\psi$ where $\\psi$ is of order 6. But a character of order 6 has values that are 6th roots of unity, and its image is a cyclic group of order 6. This group is isomorphic to $C_2 \\times C_3$. So any character of order 6 is a product of a unique character of order 2 and a unique character of order 3. Let $\\chi = \\chi_a \\chi_b$ where $\\chi_a$ has order dividing 2 and $\\chi_b$ has order dividing 3. $\\chi$ has order 6 iff $\\chi_a$ has order 2 and $\\chi_b$ has order 3.\nThe conductor of $\\chi=\\chi_a \\chi_b$ is primitive iff both $\\chi_a$ and $\\chi_b$ are primitive and their conductors are coprime. Let cond($\\chi_a$) = $d_2$ and cond($\\chi_b$) = $d_3$. So $d_2d_3 = d=53599$ and $\\gcd(d_2, d_3)=1$.\nSo we need to count pairs of $(\\chi_a, \\chi_b)$ where $\\chi_a$ is a primitive character of order 2 and conductor $d_2$, and $\\chi_b$ is a primitive character of order 3 and conductor $d_3$, and $d_2d_3=53599$.\n\nMy corrected calculation for the number of primitive real characters is accurate. For any square-free integer $d_2 > 1$, there is exactly one primitive real character of conductor $d_2$ if $d_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, and one of conductor $4d_2$ if $d_2 \\equiv 2,3 \\pmod 4$. Wait, the conductor for a real character can be more complicated. For distinct odd primes $p_1, \\dots, p_k$, the conductor of $\\chi(n) = (\\frac{n}{p_1}) \\cdots (\\frac{n}{p_k})$ is $p_1 \\cdots p_k$. The number of primitive real characters is $2^{\\omega_0}-1$ where $\\omega_0$ is the number of distinct prime factors of the modulus $q$. No, that is not correct.\n\nLet's check the number of primitive quadratic characters again.\nA character $\\chi$ is quadratic if $\\chi^2 = \\chi_0$ and $\\chi \\neq \\chi_0$. Primitive quadratic characters are associated with quadratic fields $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ where $D$ is a fundamental discriminant. The conductor of such a character is $|D|$. So for each fundamental discriminant $D$, there is one primitive quadratic character $\\chi_D(n) = (\\frac{D}{n})$.\nOur $d_2$ must be a fundamental discriminant. Since all prime factors are odd, any product of a subset of these primes gives a square-free integer. A square-free integer $n$ is a fundamental discriminant if $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\nLet the primes be $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$.\n$7 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\n$13 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\n$19 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\n$31 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\nLet $d_2 = p_{i_1} \\cdots p_{i_k}$. $d_2$ is a fundamental discriminant if $d_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\n$d_2 \\pmod 4 = \\prod p_{i_j} \\pmod 4$.\nWe need an even number of primes congruent to $3 \\pmod 4$ in the factorization of $d_2$.\nThe primes congruent to $3 \\pmod 4$ are $\\{7, 19, 31\\}$.\nThe prime congruent to $1 \\pmod 4$ is $\\{13\\}$.\n\nLet $S_1 = \\{13\\}$ and $S_3 = \\{7, 19, 31\\}$.\nLet's re-calculate the partitions based on the condition for $d_2$ being a fundamental discriminant.\n\nCase 1: $\\omega_2 = 1, \\omega_3 = 3$.\n$d_2$ is a single prime. It must be $d_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. So only $d_2 = 13$ is possible. There is $\\binom{1}{1}=1$ way. Number of real characters: 1.\nFor this $d_2$, $d_3=7 \\times 19 \\times 31$. $\\omega_3=3$. Number of characters of order 3: $2^3 = 8$. Total: $1 \\times 1 \\times 8 = 8$.\n\nCase 2: $\\omega_2 = 2, \\omega_3 = 2$.\n$d_2$ is a product of 2 primes. $d_2=p_a p_b$. For $d_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, we must choose either two primes from $S_3$ or two from $S_1$ (not possible). So we must choose two from $S_3$. $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ ways (7x19, 7x31, 19x31). Or one from $S_1$ and zero from $S_3$, but we need 2 primes. So the choices for $d_2$ are $\\{7 \\cdot 19, 7 \\cdot 31, 19 \\cdot 31\\}$. Or one from $S_1$ and one from $S_3$? No, then $d_2 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. So we must have an even number of primes from $S_3$. So we choose 2 primes from $S_3$: $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ ways. Or 0 primes from $S_3$ and 2 from $S_1$ (not possible). Or 2 from $S_3$ and 0 from $S_1$: $\\binom{3}{2}\\binom{1}{0}=3$ ways. Or 0 from $S_3$ and 2 from $S_1$: not possible. Or 1 from $S_3$ and 1 from $S_1$: no. So 3 choices for $d_2$. Number of real characters: 1 for each.\nNumber of choices for $d_2$ is $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$. Number of characters of order 2 is 1.\nFor each such $d_2$, $d_3$ is a product of two primes (the one from $S_1$ and one from $S_3$). Number of characters of order 3 is $2^2=4$.\nTotal: $3 \\times 1 \\times 4 = 12$.\n\nCase 3: $\\omega_2 = 3, \\omega_3 = 1$.\n$d_2$ product of 3 primes. To have $d_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, we need to choose one from $S_1$ and two from $S_3$: $\\binom{1}{1}\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ ways. Or three from $S_3$? No $3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 = 27 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. So choices for $d_2$ are $\\{13 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 19, 13 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 31, 13 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 31\\}$. 3 ways.\nNumber of choices for $d_2$ is 3. Number of order 2 chars: 1.\nFor each such $d_2$, $d_3$ is a single prime from $S_3$. $\\omega_3=1$. Number of order 3 chars: $2^1=2$.\nTotal: $3 \\times 1 \\times 2 = 6$.\n\nCase 4: $\\omega_2 = 4, \\omega_3 = 0$.\n$d_2 = d = 53599$. $d = 7 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 31 \\equiv 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 27 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. So $d$ is not a fundamental discriminant of the form $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. Wait. What if $d_2=-n$ with $n>0$. Let's stick to positive conductors. The conductor must be positive.\nHowever, a fundamental discriminant $D$ can be negative. In that case conductor is $|D|$.\nThe list of fundamental discriminants are:\n1. $D$ is a square-free integer and $D \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. Conductor is $D$.\n2. $D=4m$ where $m$ is square-free and $m \\equiv 2,3 \\pmod 4$. Conductor is $D$.\nSince our $d$ has only odd prime factors, $d_2$ must be a square-free integer. So only the first case applies. My analysis of $d_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ seems correct.\n\nLet's re-check $d_2$ possibilities for $\\omega_2=4$. $d_2=d$. As I calculated, $d \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. So this does not give a fundamental discriminant of type 1. So this case is not possible for $d_2$ of type 1.\n\nThere seems to be an error in my reasoning about $d_2$. Let's assume the question asks for characters with modulus $d$, not necessarily conductor. No, it says conductor.\n\nLet's reconsider the number of primitive real characters. The number of primitive characters mod $q$ is given by a formula involving Mobius inversion.\nA character $\\chi \\pmod q$ is primitive if it is not induced by a character of smaller modulus.\nThe number of primitive real characters modulo $d_2$ where $d_2$ is a product of $\\omega_2$ distinct odd primes is $2^{\\omega_2-1}$ if we are considering the characters modulo $d_2$? No, that's the total number of real characters.\nThe number of primitive real characters modulo $N$ is 1 if $N=p^*$ with $p$ an odd prime, $p^* = (-1)^{(p-1)/2}p$. It is 2 if $N=4$ and 4 if $N=8$.\nOkay, let's follow a different route.\nA character $\\chi$ of order 6 modulo $d=p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ is primitive iff $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$ where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i$ and for each $i$, $\\chi_i$ is not the principal character.\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the lcm of the orders of $\\chi_i$. We need this to be 6.\nOrder of $\\chi_i$ must divide $p_i-1$.\n$p_1=7, p_1-1=6$. Orders of primitive chars mod 7 can be 2, 3, 6.\n$p_2=13, p_2-1=12$. Orders can be 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n$p_3=19, p_3-1=18$. Orders can be 2, 3, 6, 9, 18.\n$p_4=31, p_4-1=30$. Orders can be 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.\n\nLet the orders of the primitive characters $\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4$ be $k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4$. We need $\\operatorname{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$. This means the orders $k_i$ must be divisors of 6. But also at least one must have a factor of 2, and at least one must have a factor of 3.\nThe number of primitive characters of order $k$ modulo a prime $p$ is $\\phi(k)$ if $k | p-1$.\n\nFor $p=7$, $p-1=6$:\n- Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$\n- Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$\n- Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$\nTotal non-principal primitive chars: $\\phi(6)=2+1+2+1=5? No. $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2 = 5$. Total primitive chars are $p-2=5$.\n\nFor $p=13$, $p-1=12$:\n- Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$\n- Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$\n- Order 4: $\\phi(4)=2$\n- Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$\n- Order 12: $\\phi(12)=4$\n\nFor $p=19$, $p-1=18$:\n- Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$\n- Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$\n- Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$\n- Order 9: $\\phi(9)=6$\n- Order 18: $\\phi(18)=6$\n\nFor $p=31$, $p-1=30$:\n- Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$\n- Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$\n- Order 5: $\\phi(5)=4$\n- Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$\n...and so on.\n\nLet's denote $N_k(p)$ as the number of primitive characters of order $k$ mod $p$. We know $N_k(p) = \\phi(k)$ if $k|p-1$.\nLet $k_i$ be the order of $\\chi_i$. We need $\\operatorname{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4)=6$.\nThis means each $k_i$ must be in $\\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$. (Cannot be 1 because primitive). So $k_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\nAlso, to get lcm 6, at least one $k_i$ must be a multiple of 3 (so 3 or 6) and at least one must be a multiple of 2 (so 2 or 6).\n\nLet's count the number of choices for the tuple of orders $(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4)$.\nLet $C_i$ be the set of possible orders for primitive characters for $p_i$.\n$C_1=\\{2,3,6\\}$ since $7-1=6$.\n$C_2=\\{2,3,4,6,12\\}$ for $13-1=12$. We only care about $\\{2,3,6\\}$.\n$C_3=\\{2,3,6,9,18\\}$ for $19-1=18$. We only care about $\\{2,3,6\\}$.\n$C_4=\\{2,3,5,6,10,15,30\\}$ for $31-1=30$. We only care about $\\{2,3,6\\}$.\nAll four primes allow orders 2, 3, and 6.\n\nLet $N(k)$ be $\\phi(k)$. $N(2)=1, N(3)=2, N(6)=2$.\nLet's find the total number of primitive characters whose order divides 6. Let this be $n_i$ for prime $p_i$.\nFor each of the 4 primes, the orders of primitive characters that divide 6 are 2, 3, 6.\nNumber of such characters for each prime is $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2=5$.\nSo there are $5^4$ total choices of tuples $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where order of $\\chi_i$ divides 6.\nLet's subtract the cases where the lcm is not 6.\nThe lcm is not 6 if all orders are powers of 2, or all orders are powers of 3.\nLcm order divides 3 (i.e., is 1 or 3): each $k_i \\in \\{3\\}$.\nFor each prime, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ chars of order 3. So $2^4$ such combinations. The lcm is 3.\nLcm order divides 2 (i.e., is 1 or 2): each $k_i \\in \\{2\\}$.\nFor each prime, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ char of order 2. So $1^4 = 1$ such combination. The lcm is 2.\n\nIs this all?\nLet $A$ be the set of characters where order is in $\\{2,3,6\\}$. $|A| = (\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6))^4 = 5^4 = 625$.\nLet $A_2$ be the set where orders are in $\\{2\\}$. $|\\chi_i|=2$. This corresponds to one choice for each component, so $1^4=1$ character product. The order is 2.\nLet $A_3$ be the set where orders are in $\\{3\\}$. $|\\chi_i|=3$. This corresponds to $\\phi(3)=2$ choices for each component, so $2^4=16$ character products. The order is 3.\n\nLet $O_i$ be the order of $\\chi_i$.\n$\\operatorname{lcm}(O_1,O_2,O_3,O_4)=6$. This means $(\\exists i: 3|O_i)$ and $(\\exists j: 2|O_j)$.\nLet $S$ be the set of all $5^4$ tuples of characters.\nLet $P_2$ be the property that for all $i$, $2 \\nmid O_i$. This means $O_i \\in \\{3\\}$. Number of such characters is $2^4=16$.\nLet $P_3$ be the property that for all $i$, $3 \\nmid O_i$. This means $O_i \\in \\{2\\}$. Number of such characters is $1^4=1$.\nBy Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, the number of characters with the desired property is $|S| - |P_2| - |P_3| + |P_2 \\cap P_3|$.\n$|P_2 \\cap P_3|$ means for all $i$, $O_i$ is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3. Since the only allowed orders are $\\{2,3,6\\}$, this is an empty set. So $|P_2 \\cap P_3|=0$.\nThe number is $5^4 - 2^4 - 1^4 = 625 - 16 - 1 = 608$.\n\nLet me check this logic again.\nThe set of primitive characters modulo $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ is the direct product of the groups of primitive characters modulo $p_i$.\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$.\n$\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_1), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_2), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_3), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_4))$.\nWe need $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi) = 6$.\nLet $k_i = \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_i)$. $k_i | p_i-1$. $k_i > 1$.\nThe set of possible orders for $p_1=7$ is $\\{2,3,6\\}$. For $p_2=13$ is $\\{2,3,4,6,12\\}$. For $p_3=19$ is $\\{2,3,6,9,18\\}$. For $p_4=31$ is $\\{2,3,5,6,10,15,30\\}$.\nLet $U_i$ be the set of choices for the character $\\chi_i$. Total number of choices is $\\prod_i (p_i-2)$.\nWe need $\\operatorname{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$.\nLet's define three sets of characters for each prime $p_i$:\n$S_{i,2}$: set of primitive characters mod $p_i$ whose order is a power of 2. ($k_i \\in \\{2, 4, 8, ...\\}$)\n$S_{i,3}$: set of primitive characters mod $p_i$ whose order is a power of 3. ($k_i \\in \\{3, 9, 27, ...\\}$)\n$S_{i,6}$: set of primitive characters mod $p_i$ whose order contains factors of both 2 and 3. ($k_i \\in \\{6, 12, 18, ...\\}$)\nAnd $S_{i, \\text{other}}$ contains all other characters.\n\nWe need $\\operatorname{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$. This means:\n1. All $k_i$ must be of the form $2^a 3^b m$ where $m$ is coprime to 6.\n2. The maximum power of 2 across all $a_i$ must be 1.\n3. The maximum power of 3 across all $b_i$ must be 1.\n4. The lcm of the $m_i$ parts must be 1.\nSo each $k_i$ must divide 6. So $k_i \\in \\{1,2,3,6\\}$. Since characters are primitive (non-principal), $k_i \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$. This is possible for all 4 primes.\n\nSo my previous reasoning was correct.\nNumber of choices for each $\\chi_i$ from the set of characters with order in $\\{2,3,6\\}$.\nFor each prime $p$, the number of such characters is $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2=5$.\nLet's have 4 slots, one for each prime factor. For each slot, we can place a character of order 2, 3, or 6. There are 1, 2, 2 such characters respectively. So 5 choices per slot. Total $5^4$ combinations.\nLet $(c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4)$ be a tuple of characters. The order of the product is $\\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(c_1), ..., \\operatorname{ord}(c_4))$.\nWe want this lcm to be 6.\nThis means we need to exclude cases where the lcm is just a power of 2 or a power of 3.\nIf lcm is a power of 2, all orders must be powers of 2. Here, it means all orders must be 2. There is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2 for each prime. So $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$ such combination.\nIf lcm is a power of 3, all orders must be powers of 3. Here, it means all orders must be 3. There are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3 for each prime. So $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$ such combinations.\nThe total number of primitive characters of order 6 is $5^4 - 1^4 - 2^4 = 625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\nLet's verify this using inclusion-exclusion more formally.\nLet $S$ be the set of all tuples $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_i) \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$. Size is $5^4$.\nLet $A_2$ be the subset of $S$ where for all $i$, $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_i) \\in \\{3,6\\}$.\nLet $A_3$ be the subset of $S$ where for all $i$, $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_i) \\in \\{2,6\\}$.\nWe want to find the number of tuples where there is at least one character whose order is divisible by 2, and at least one whose order is divisible by 3.\nThis is $|S| - |(\\text{no order div by 2}) \\cup (\\text{no order div by 3})|$.\n\"no order div by 2\" means all orders are 3. Number of choices for each prime is $\\phi(3)=2$. Total $2^4=16$.\n\"no order div by 3\" means all orders are 2. Number of choices for each prime is $\\phi(2)=1$. Total $1^4=1$.\nThe union is the sum, since the intersection is empty (cannot have order 3 and order 2 at the same time).\nSo we subtract from the total number of combinations of characters with orders in $\\{2,3,6\\}$.\nTotal number of choices is $5^4 = 625$.\nNumber of combinations where all orders are from $\\{2\\}$: $1^4=1$.\nNumber of combinations where all orders are from $\\{3\\}$: $2^4=16$.\nWhat if one order is 2, one is 3, one is 6? This is already counted in the $5^4$.\nWhat is wrong with the PIE logic?\n\nLet $U_i$ be the set of primitive characters modulo $p_i$ with order dividing 6. So $|U_i|=5$.\nLet $\\chi = (\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_4)$ be an element of $U_1 \\times \\dots \\times U_4$.\nWe want $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi)=6$.\nThis is equivalent to $\\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_4)) = 6$.\nLet $P_2$ be the condition \"order is divisible by 2\". Let $P_3$ be the condition \"order is divisible by 3\".\nWe want to count $\\chi$ that satisfy $P_2(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi)) \\land P_3(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi))$.\n$\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi)$ is divisible by 2 iff $\\exists i$ s.t. $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_i)$ is divisible by 2.\n$\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi)$ is divisible by 3 iff $\\exists i$ s.t. $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_i)$ is divisible by 3.\nLet $A$ be the set of all tuples. $|A|=5^4$.\nLet $A_{\\not 2}$ be the tuples where no $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_i)$ is divisible by 2. This means all $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_i)=3$. Number is $2^4=16$.\nLet $A_{\\not 3}$ be the tuples where no $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_i)$ is divisible by 3. This means all $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_i)=2$. Number is $1^4=1$.\nThe number of tuples we want is $|A| - |A_{\\not 2} \\cup A_{\\not 3}|$.\nSince $A_{\\not 2}$ and $A_{\\not 3}$ are disjoint, $|A_{\\not 2} \\cup A_{\\not 3}| = |A_{\\not 2}| + |A_{\\not 3}| = 16+1=17$.\nThe number of tuples with order 6 is $625 - 17 = 608$.\n\nLet's double-check again.\nLet $o_i$ be the order of $\\chi_i$. Each $o_i \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$.\nLet $X_i$ be the set of these characters for prime $p_i$. $|X_i|=5$.\nTotal combinations: $5^4$.\nThe resulting character $\\chi$ has order that is NOT 6 if $\\operatorname{lcm}(o_1,o_2,o_3,o_4)$ is 2 or 3.\nThe lcm is 2 if all $o_i=2$. There is only $\\phi(2)=1$ choice for each $i$. So $1^4=1$ such character.\nThe lcm is 3 if all $o_i=3$. There are $\\phi(3)=2$ choices for each $i$. So $2^4=16$ such characters.\nThe lcm is 1 if all $o_i=1$, but these are not primitive.\nIs it possible for the lcm to be, say, 1, from a combination of characters of orders {2,3,6}? No.\nIs it possible to have $\\operatorname{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)$ something other than 2, 3, or 6? No, if all $o_i \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$.\nSo the number of characters of order 6 is the total number of combinations minus those that result in order 2 and order 3.\n$5^4 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\nThe logic seems sound now. It hinges on the fact that for a square-free conductor $d=p_1 \\cdots p_r$, a character $\\chi$ is a primitive character modulo $d$ if and only if it can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a non-principal primitive character modulo $p_i$. The conductor of such $\\chi$ is indeed $d$. The order of $\\chi$ is the lcm of the orders of the $\\chi_i$.\nAll the primes $7,13,19,31$ allow primitive characters of orders 2, 3, 6.\nNumber of primitive characters of order $k$ for a prime $p$ is $\\phi(k)$ if $k|p-1$.\nNumber of choices for each $\\chi_i$ whose order must divide 6 (but not 1) is $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2=5$.\nTotal combinations of such characters is $5^4$.\nThe order of the combined character is 6 if and only if not all component characters have order dividing 2 AND not all component characters have order dividing 3.\nNumber of combinations where all orders divide 2 is $1^4 = 1$. The only order is 2. So lcm is 2.\nNumber of combinations where all orders divide 3 is $2^4=16$. The only order is 3. So lcm is 3.\nTotal characters of order 6 = (Total choices) - (choices for order 2) - (choices for order 3).\n$5^4 - 1^4 - 2^4 = 625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\nThe reasoning seems solid.\n\nI will structure the final answer based on this last line of reasoning.\n1. State the prime factorization of $d=53599$.\n2. State the property of primitive characters for a square-free conductor.\n3. State the condition on the orders of the component characters for the combined character to have order 6.\n4. Calculate the number of available component characters for each prime factor.\n5. Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of valid combinations.\nFinal check:\nIs it possible that one of the $k_i$ is not in $\\{2,3,6\\}$ but the lcm is 6? No, because then $k_i$ would not divide 6, and so the lcm would be a multiple of $k_i$ and hence not 6. So all $k_i$ must divide 6. As they are orders of primitive characters, they are $>1$. So all $k_i \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$. My assumption is correct.\nThe calculation seems robust.To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\nThe number $53599$ can be factored into prime numbers as:\n$d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThe conductor is a square-free integer, which simplifies the analysis.\n\n### 2. Primitive Characters for a Square-Free Conductor\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of non-principal primitive characters modulo each prime factor:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$,\nwhere each $\\chi_i$ is a non-principal character modulo $p_i$. The conductor of each $\\chi_i$ is $p_i$, and the conductor of $\\chi$ is the product of these prime conductors.\n\n### 3. Order of the Composite Character\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters $\\chi_i$:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))$.\nWe are looking for characters of order 6. This requires that the lcm of the orders of the four component characters is 6. This implies that the order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of 6. Since each $\\chi_i$ must be non-principal, its order must be greater than 1. Thus, the possible orders for each $\\chi_i$ are 2, 3, and 6.\n\n### 4. Number of Component Characters\nFor a prime $p$, the number of primitive (which for a prime modulus means non-principal) characters of order $k$ is given by $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$. Let's check this condition for our prime factors:\n*   For $p_1=7$: $p_1-1=6$. Orders 2, 3, and 6 are possible.\n*   For $p_2=13$: $p_2-1=12$. Orders 2, 3, and 6 are possible.\n*   For $p_3=19$: $p_3-1=18$. Orders 2, 3, and 6 are possible.\n*   For $p_4=31$: $p_4-1=30$. Orders 2, 3, and 6 are possible.\n\nFor each prime factor of $d$, we can choose a component character with an order from {2, 3, 6}. The number of available characters for each order are:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\nSo, for each of the four prime factors, there are $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$ possible non-principal characters whose orders are divisors of 6.\n\n### 5. Counting the Combinations\nWe need to count the number of combinations of four characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ such that the lcm of their orders is exactly 6.\nLet the set of available characters for each prime factor be $C_i$. We know $|C_i| = 5$. The total number of combinations of four such characters is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nThis total count includes combinations where the lcm of the orders is not 6. The lcm of orders from the set {2, 3, 6} will not be 6 only if all orders are divisors of 2 (i.e., all are 2) or all orders are divisors of 3 (i.e., all are 3).\n\n*   **Case 1: lcm of orders is 2.**\n    This occurs if and only if the order of each component character is 2. For each prime factor, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2. So there is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$ such combination.\n\n*   **Case 2: lcm of orders is 3.**\n    This occurs if and only if the order of each component character is 3. For each prime factor, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3. So there are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$ such combinations.\n\nBy the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of combinations minus those where the order is not 6.\nNumber of characters = (Total combinations) - (Combinations with lcm order 2) - (Combinations with lcm order 3)\nNumber of characters = $5^4 - 1^4 - 2^4 = 625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n"
