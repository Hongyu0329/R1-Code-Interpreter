    "The protein that, when broken down or reduced, allows for enhanced macrophage engulfment of amyloid is **Glia Maturation Factor-γ (GMFG)**.\n\nStudies have shown that a reduction or \"knockdown\" of GMFG in macrophages leads to an increased uptake of amyloid-β42. GMFG is a protein that plays a role in regulating the cell's internal scaffolding, known as the actin cytoskeleton.\n\nThe breakdown of GMFG enhances amyloid phagocytosis by increasing the expression of another protein called **Scavenger Receptor Class A Type I (SR-AI)**. SR-AI is a receptor on the surface of macrophages that recognizes and binds to amyloid-β, facilitating its engulfment. Therefore, the functional breakdown of GMFG leads to more SR-AI receptors on the macrophage surface, which in turn increases the cell's ability to clear amyloid. This process also involves the modulation of a transcriptional factor known as MafB.\n\n<<<Glia Maturation Factor-γ (GMFG)>>>"
