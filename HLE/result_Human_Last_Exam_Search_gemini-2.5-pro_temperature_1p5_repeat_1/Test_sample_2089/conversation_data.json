    "I am unable to identify an Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals their fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus. Despite multiple searches, no film matching this specific sequence of events and accolades could be found.\n\nIt is possible that the film in question was not Oscar-nominated, or that the details of the scene have been misremembered. Several Oscar-nominated films feature significant bus scenes, and many explore themes of fate, but none appear to contain the precise moment described in the user's request. For instance, films like \"It Happened One Night\" (1934) and \"Little Miss Sunshine\" (2006) have prominent bus scenes and were nominated for Academy Awards, but do not include this specific fateful \"Thank you.\" Similarly, films that heavily feature themes of fate, such as \"No Country for Old Men\" (2007), do not have a corresponding scene.\n\nWithout additional details, it is not possible to provide the name of the film.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer the question based on the information provided.>>>"
