    "To find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) in a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using a 6-31G** basis set, we need to determine the number of electrons and the number of basis functions (molecular orbitals).\n\n### 1. Determine the total number of electrons:\nThe number of electrons for each atom is:\n*   Carbon (C): 6\n*   Hydrogen (H): 1\n*   Silicon (Si): 14\n*   Fluorine (F): 9\n\nThe molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ has one Carbon atom, three Hydrogen atoms, one Silicon atom, and one Fluorine atom.\nTotal electrons ($m$) = 6 (for C) + 3 * 1 (for 3 H) + 14 (for Si) + 9 (for F) = 32 electrons.\n\n### 2. Determine the total number of basis functions:\nThe 6-31G** basis set is also known as 6-31G(d,p). We need to find the number of basis functions for each atom with this set:\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** The 6-31G basis provides two s-type functions. The `**` (or `(d,p)`) adds a set of p-type polarization functions (3 functions: $p_x, p_y, p_z$). So, each H atom contributes 2 + 3 = 5 basis functions.\n*   **For the Carbon (C) atom:** As a second-row atom, the 6-31G basis provides 9 functions. The `*` adds a set of d-type polarization functions. In the commonly used Pople basis sets, this corresponds to 6 Cartesian d-functions. Thus, the Carbon atom contributes 9 + 6 = 15 basis functions.\n*   **For the Silicon (Si) atom:** As a third-row atom, the 6-31G basis set provides 13 functions. The `*` adds a set of d-type polarization functions (6 functions). Therefore, the Silicon atom contributes 13 + 6 = 19 basis functions.\n*   **For the Fluorine (F) atom:** Like Carbon, it is a second-row atom, so it contributes 15 basis functions.\n\nTotal number of basis functions ($n$) = 15 (for C) + 3 * 5 (for 3 H) + 19 (for Si) + 15 (for F) = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = 64 basis functions.\n\n### 3. Calculate the number of singlet CSFs:\nFor a full CI calculation, the number of singlet CSFs for a system with $n$ spatial orbitals and $m$ electrons (where $m$ is even) is given by the Weyl-Pethick-Knowles formula. The molecule has 32 electrons, which is an even number, so its ground state is a singlet state (Total Spin, S=0).\n\nThe number of singlet CSFs is calculated as:\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{n}{k}^2 - \\binom{n}{k-1} \\binom{n}{k+1}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $n$ = number of spatial orbitals = 64\n*   $k = m/2$ = 32/2 = 16\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{15} \\binom{64}{17}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the binomial coefficients:\n*   $\\binom{64}{16} = \\frac{64!}{16! \\cdot 48!} = 496,391,378,575,340$\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} = \\frac{64!}{15! \\cdot 49!} = 162,118,103,165,336$\n*   $\\binom{64}{17} = \\frac{64!}{17! \\cdot 47!} = 1,399,788,806,128,480$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the formula:\n$N_{CSF} = (496,391,378,575,340)^2 - (162,118,103,165,336) \\times (1,399,788,806,128,480)$\n$N_{CSF} = 2.46404179 \\times 10^{29} - 2.26930606 \\times 10^{29}$\n$N_{CSF} = 0.19473573 \\times 10^{29}$\n$N_{CSF} = 1.9473573 \\times 10^{28}$\n\n<<<1.9473573e+28>>>"
