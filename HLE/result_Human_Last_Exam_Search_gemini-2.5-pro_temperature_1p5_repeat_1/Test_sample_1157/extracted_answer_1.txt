The appropriate management involves a multi-phase approach starting with systemic stabilization of her diabetes and acute wound care. Due to the 28-hour delay, replantation of the avulsed left lateral incisor, canine, and first premolar is not viable. The cells of interest are primarily those involved in socket healing, such as osteoblasts and fibroblasts. The significant SNB angle of 88‚Å∞ indicates a prognathic mandible and a skeletal Class III relationship, which must be factored into the prosthetic design. For tooth replacement, a removable partial denture with a biocompatible titanium framework is recommended. The abutment teeth would be the left central incisor and second premolar, as well as the right canine and first molar. This four-cornered support system is crucial to provide stability, distribute forces from replacing the critical canine tooth, and ensure the longevity of the prosthesis.
