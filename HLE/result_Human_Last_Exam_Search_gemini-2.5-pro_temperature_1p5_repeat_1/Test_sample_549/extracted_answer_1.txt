The quantum correction to the conductivity, δσ, for an electron performing a diffusive motion in a bulk (3D) disordered semiconductor is negative and proportional to (1/√τ - 1/√τ_φ), where τ is the elastic scattering time and τ_φ is the phase-breaking time. This negative correction, known as weak localization, signifies a decrease in conductivity due to enhanced backscattering from constructive quantum interference. Since at low temperatures τ << τ_φ, the correction is approximately proportional to -1/√τ.
