    "To find an analytical expression that approximates the solution of the given third-order ordinary differential equation for large values of $x$, we first analyze the behavior of each term in the equation as $x \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe differential equation is:\n$y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\n\nFor large $x$, we can make the following observations:\n*   The term $\\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2}$ approaches zero, provided that $y''$ does not grow faster than $x^2$.\n*   The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x) + 1}$ is a rapidly oscillating function with a period of $\\pi$. The behavior of a system with such a forcing term is often dominated by its response to the smoother, non-oscillatory terms. Therefore, as a first approximation, we can neglect this oscillatory term. This is a common technique in the asymptotic analysis of differential equations.\n\nBased on these considerations, we can simplify the original equation for large $x$ to:\n$y''' \\approx y^4 + (y')^4$\n\nLet's look for a solution of the form $y(x) = \\frac{c}{x^n}$ for some constants $c$ and $n > 0$, as the initial conditions suggest growth, but this growth may not persist for all $x$.\nThe derivatives are:\n*   $y'(x) = -\\frac{cn}{x^{n+1}}$\n*   $y''(x) = \\frac{cn(n+1)}{x^{n+2}}$\n*   $y'''(x) = -\\frac{cn(n+1)(n+2)}{x^{n+3}}$\n\nSubstituting these into the approximated equation gives:\n$-\\frac{cn(n+1)(n+2)}{x^{n+3}} \\approx \\left(\\frac{c}{x^n}\\right)^4 + \\left(-\\frac{cn}{x^{n+1}}\\right)^4 = \\frac{c^4}{x^{4n}} + \\frac{c^4 n^4}{x^{4n+4}}$\n\nTo find the dominant balance for large $x$, we compare the powers of $x$. The term with the lowest power in the denominator (highest power of $x$) will dominate.\n*   The term on the left-hand side has a power of $x^{n+3}$.\n*   The first term on the right-hand side has a power of $x^{4n}$.\n*   The second term on the right-hand side has a power of $x^{4n+4}$.\n\nFor large $x$, the term $\\frac{c^4 n^4}{x^{4n+4}}$ is negligible compared to $\\frac{c^4}{x^{4n}}$. Thus, the equation simplifies to balancing $y'''$ and $y^4$:\n$y''' \\approx y^4$\n\nEquating the exponents:\n$n+3 = 4n \\implies 3n = 3 \\implies n=1$\n\nNow, we solve for the constant $c$ by substituting $n=1$ back into the equation relating the coefficients:\n$-c(1)(1+1)(1+2) = c^4$\n$-6c = c^4$\n$c^4 + 6c = 0$\n$c(c^3 + 6) = 0$\n\nThis gives a trivial solution $c=0$ and a non-trivial solution $c^3 = -6$, which means $c = -\\sqrt{6}$.\n\nThus, the approximate analytical expression for $y(x)$ in the large $x$ regime is:\n$y(x) \\approx -\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{x}$\n\nTo provide the answer with rounding to two decimal places, we first calculate the value of $\\sqrt{6}$:\n$\\sqrt{6} \\approx 1.81712$\nRounding to two decimal places gives $1.82$.\n\nTherefore, the approximate analytical expression is:\n$y(x) \\approx -\\frac{1.82}{x}$\n\n<<<y(x) = -1.82/x>>>"
