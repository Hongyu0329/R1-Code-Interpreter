    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion depends on the choice of basis for the free Lie algebra generated by two non-commuting variables, X and Y. A common and natural choice is the Lyndon basis.\n\nThe total number of independent coefficients (both zero and non-zero) at a specific order *n* is given by the dimension of the *n*-th homogeneous component of the free Lie algebra with two generators, denoted as `dim(L_n(2))`. This dimension can be calculated using Witt's formula:\n\n`dim(L_n(2)) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * 2^(n/d)`\n\nwhere the sum is over all positive divisors *d* of *n*, and `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nFor order *n* = 10, the divisors are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The corresponding values of the Möbius function are:\n*   `μ(1) = 1`\n*   `μ(2) = -1`\n*   `μ(5) = -1`\n*   `μ(10) = μ(2*5) = μ(2)*μ(5) = (-1)*(-1) = 1`\n\nUsing these values in Witt's formula, the total number of coefficients at order 10 is:\n`dim(L_10(2)) = (1/10) * (μ(1)*2^10 + μ(2)*2^5 + μ(5)*2^2 + μ(10)*2^1)`\n`dim(L_10(2)) = (1/10) * (1*1024 - 1*32 - 1*4 + 1*2)`\n`dim(L_10(2)) = (1/10) * (1024 - 32 - 4 + 2) = (1/10) * 990 = 99`\n\nSo, there are 99 independent terms in the BCH expansion at order 10.\n\nA 2008 paper by F. Casas and A. Murua, which details an efficient algorithm for computing the BCH series, provides a formula for the number of vanishing coefficients for even orders when expressed in the Lyndon basis. For an even order `m = 2p`, the number of vanishing coefficients, `nc(2p)`, is given by:\n\n`nc(2p) = dim(L_2p(2)) - dim(L_{2p-1}(2)) + 1`\n\nFor order 10, we have `p=5`. We need to calculate `dim(L_9(2))`. The divisors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9. The Möbius function values are `μ(1)=1`, `μ(3)=-1`, and `μ(9)=0`.\n`dim(L_9(2)) = (1/9) * (μ(1)*2^9 + μ(3)*2^3 + μ(9)*2^1)`\n`dim(L_9(2)) = (1/9) * (1*512 - 1*8 + 0*2) = (1/9) * 504 = 56`\n\nNow, we can find the number of vanishing coefficients at order 10:\n`nc(10) = dim(L_10(2)) - dim(L_9(2)) + 1`\n`nc(10) = 99 - 56 + 1 = 44`\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients is the total number of coefficients minus the number of vanishing coefficients:\nNumber of nonzero coefficients = `dim(L_10(2)) - nc(10)`\nNumber of nonzero coefficients = `99 - 44 = 55`\n\nThus, in the Lyndon basis, there are 55 nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion.\n\n<<<55>>>"
