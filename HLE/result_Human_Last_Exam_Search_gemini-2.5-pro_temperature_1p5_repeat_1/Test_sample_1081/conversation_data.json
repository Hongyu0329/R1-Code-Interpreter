    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is independent of $q$ and corresponds to the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group.\n\nA reductive group of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is necessarily of the split form. This is because the Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has a trivial automorphism group. The classification of forms of a simple algebraic group over a perfect field, such as a finite field, is given by the first Galois cohomology set of the automorphism group of the group. For a simply connected group of type $E_8$, the automorphism group is almost the group of inner automorphisms, and its outer automorphism group is trivial. The Galois group of a finite field acts trivially on the Dynkin diagram. Consequently, all forms of $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ are split.\n\nFor a split reductive group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes of maximal $\\mathbb{F}_q$-tori are in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$.\n\nThe number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ has been computed and is a known result in the theory of finite groups of Lie type. According to a paper by R. W. Carter, the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
