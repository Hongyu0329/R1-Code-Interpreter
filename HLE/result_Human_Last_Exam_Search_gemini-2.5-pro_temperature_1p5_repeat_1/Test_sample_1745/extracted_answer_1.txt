The expression for the Electrical double-layer (EDL) potential distribution, $\psi(y)$, in the parallel-plate microchannel is given by:

$$ \psi(y) = z_1(1+\beta k) \frac{\sinh(k(H-y))}{\sinh(kH)} $$

where:
*   $y$ is the transverse coordinate across the channel height, ranging from 0 at the bottom surface to $H$ at the top surface.
*   $z_1$ is the zeta potential of the bottom surface.
*   $\beta$ is the slip length.
*   $k$ is the Debye-HÃ¼ckel parameter.
*   $H$ is the height of the microchannel.
*   $\sinh$ denotes the hyperbolic sine function.
