    "In John Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost*, a number of historical biblical figures who are considered saints in the broader Christian tradition are mentioned by name. Given Milton's Puritan beliefs, which rejected the Catholic and Anglican practice of venerating saints, the poem does not reference post-biblical, canonized saints. Instead, it alludes to several key figures from the Old Testament, presenting them as righteous individuals within the narrative of human history revealed to Adam.\n\nBased on a textual analysis of the poem, the following seven historical saints are mentioned by name:\n\n*   **Enoch:** In Book XI, the archangel Michael shows Adam a vision of the future where he points out Enoch as a man who will stand against violence and will be taken to Heaven by God without dying.\n*   **Noah:** Also in Book XI, Noah is presented as the one virtuous man of his time, chosen by God to build the ark and save humanity and the animal kingdom from the great flood.\n*   **Abraham:** In Book XII, Michael recounts the story of Abraham, who is chosen by God to be the patriarch of a great nation and from whose lineage the Messiah will come.\n*   **Moses:** Moses is mentioned in both Book I and Book XII. In Book XII, Michael details his role in leading the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt and receiving God's laws.\n*   **Elijah:** The prophet Elijah, who like Enoch was taken into heaven without dying, is alluded to in Milton's work. His presence in *Paradise Lost* is noted in theological discussions of \"translated saints\" alongside Enoch.\n*   **David:** King David is named in Book XII as the ancestor of the Messiah.\n*   **Mary:** In Book XII, the mother of the Messiah is referred to as the \"virgin mother,\" a clear reference to Mary.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of seven historical saints mentioned by name or clear allusion in *Paradise Lost*.\n\n<<<7>>>"
