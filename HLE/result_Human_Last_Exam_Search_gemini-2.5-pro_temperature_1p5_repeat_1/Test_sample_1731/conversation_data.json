    "Large deviation theory provides a framework for understanding the asymptotic behavior of rare events. In the context of statistical mechanics, it offers a rigorous foundation for the principles of entropy and equilibrium. The Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems are cornerstone results in this theory, and they can be applied to the Bose case of light quanta (photons) to determine their equilibrium properties.\n\n### The Large Deviation Theorems\n\n*   **Cramér-Chernoff Theorem**: This theorem quantifies the probability that the empirical average of a set of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables deviates significantly from its expected value. The probability of such a \"large deviation\" decays exponentially, and the rate of this decay is described by a \"rate function,\" which is the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the cumulant generating function.\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem**: This theorem addresses the probability of observing an empirical distribution that is different from the true underlying distribution of the i.i.d. random variables. The probability of seeing a particular \"wrong\" distribution is also exponentially small, with a rate function given by the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the empirical and true distributions. This theorem provides a direct link between probability theory and the concept of entropy in statistical mechanics.\n\n### Application to the Bose Gas of Light Quanta\n\nA recent study successfully utilized these large deviation theorems to analyze the spatial and energy distributions of a Bose gas of photons, reproducing the foundational results of Bose and Planck. The approach can be summarized as follows:\n\n**1. Equilibrium Spatial Distribution and Entropy via Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem**\n\nFor a system of photons distributed among various discrete energy states or cells in phase space, the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem is applied to determine the most probable spatial distribution.\n\n*   The distribution of photons across these states is described by an empirical measure.\n*   The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem states that the probability of a particular configuration (macrostate) is related to the relative entropy, which acts as the large deviation rate function.\n*   The state of thermodynamic equilibrium corresponds to the most probable macrostate, which is the one that maximizes the probability. This, in turn, is equivalent to maximizing the Boltzmann-Sanov relative entropy under the physical constraints of the system (such as the total energy).\n*   The equilibrium entropy (S) of the photon gas is thus found by maximizing the Boltzmann-Sanov relative entropy (which is proportional to the logarithm of the number of microstates, W), leading to the famous formula S = k log(W), where k is the Boltzmann constant.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Mean Energy via Cramér-Chernoff Theorem**\n\nThe Cramér-Chernoff theorem is used to analyze the large deviations in the system's internal energy.\n\n*   The total energy of the gas is the sum of the energies of all individual photons. These can be treated as i.i.d. random variables.\n*   The theorem is used to find the probability of the total energy deviating from its mean value. The rate function for this probability is derived from the moment-generating function, which is analogous to the partition function in statistical mechanics.\n*   At thermodynamic equilibrium, the system settles into a state where large deviations from the mean energy are extremely improbable. The equilibrium condition, which minimizes the variations in the corresponding entropy formulation, determines the mean energy of the system for a given macrostate.\n\nBy combining these approaches, the equilibrium values are determined. The maximization of the Boltzmann-Sanov relative entropy under the constraint of a fixed total average energy yields the Bose-Einstein distribution for the photons. Once this distribution is known, the equilibrium entropy and mean energy can be calculated directly. The equilibrium state is the one that simultaneously represents the most likely spatial arrangement of particles (from Sanov's theorem) and the most likely energy configuration (from Cramér's theorem).\n\n<<<The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta are found by applying the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff large deviation theorems. The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem is used to determine the equilibrium spatial distribution of photons by maximizing the associated relative entropy, which corresponds to the system's thermodynamic entropy (S = k log W) at equilibrium. The Cramér-Chernoff theorem is applied to the energy distribution to find the equilibrium mean energy (U). This is achieved by finding the most probable energy state, where large deviations are suppressed. The thermodynamic equilibrium condition, derived from minimizing the rate functions of these theorems under the system's physical constraints, yields the specific values for entropy and mean energy that are characteristic of a photon gas following Bose-Einstein statistics, as described by Planck's law.>>>"
