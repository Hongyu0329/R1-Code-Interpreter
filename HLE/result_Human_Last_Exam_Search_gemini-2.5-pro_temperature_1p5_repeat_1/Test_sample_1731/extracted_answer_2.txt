The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta are found by applying the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff large deviation theorems. The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem is used to determine the equilibrium spatial distribution of photons by maximizing the associated relative entropy, which corresponds to the system's thermodynamic entropy (S = k log W) at equilibrium. The Cramér-Chernoff theorem is applied to the energy distribution to find the equilibrium mean energy (U). This is achieved by finding the most probable energy state, where large deviations are suppressed. The thermodynamic equilibrium condition, derived from minimizing the rate functions of these theorems under the system's physical constraints, yields the specific values for entropy and mean energy that are characteristic of a photon gas following Bose-Einstein statistics, as described by Planck's law.
