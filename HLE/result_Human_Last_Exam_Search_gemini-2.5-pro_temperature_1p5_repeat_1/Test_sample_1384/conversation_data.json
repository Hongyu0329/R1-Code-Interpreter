    "To determine the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of the number $e^{-7^{13}}$, we can use logarithms. Let $x = e^{-7^{13}}$. By taking the base-10 logarithm, we can analyze its magnitude and leading digits.\n\nThe formula to work with is $\\log_{10}(x) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}})$. Using the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to $\\log_{10}(x) = -7^{13} \\cdot \\log_{10}(e)$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n1.  First, we calculate the value of $7^{13}$, which is 96,889,010,407.\n2.  Next, we use the value of $\\log_{10}(e)$, which is approximately 0.4342944819.\n3.  We multiply these two numbers to find the value of $\\log_{10}(x)$:\n    $K = -96,889,010,407 \\cdot 0.4342944819 \\approx -42,071,223,910.433$\n4.  A number can be expressed in scientific notation based on its base-10 logarithm. If $\\log_{10}(x) = K$, then $x = 10^K$. We can separate the integer and fractional parts of K. Let $K = \\lfloor K \\rfloor + \\{K\\}$, where $\\lfloor K \\rfloor$ is the integer part and $\\{K\\}$ is the fractional part.\n    *   $\\lfloor K \\rfloor = -42,071,223,911$\n    *   $\\{K\\} = K - \\lfloor K \\rfloor \\approx -42,071,223,910.433 - (-42,071,223,911) = 0.567$\n5.  The number of leading zeros in the decimal representation of $x$ is given by $|\\lfloor K \\rfloor| - 1$, which means there are 42,071,223,910 zeros after the decimal point before the first non-zero digit.\n6.  The first non-zero digits are determined by $10^{\\{K\\}}$.\n    *   $10^{0.567} \\approx 3.689$\n\nThe first digit is 3 and the second digit is 6.\n\nTherefore, the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$ are 3 and 6.\n\n<<<36>>>"
