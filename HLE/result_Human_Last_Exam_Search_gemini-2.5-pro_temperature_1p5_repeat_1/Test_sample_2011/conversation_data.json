    "Let G be a graph with n = 128 vertices. The question asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs in G.\n\nAn induced subgraph is formed by a subset of vertices and all the edges that connect pairs of vertices in that subset. A clique of size *k* is a set of *k* vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. For a set of *k* vertices to form an induced clique, the subgraph induced by these vertices must be a complete graph (K_k).\n\nLet S be the set of all integers *k* for which an induced clique of size *k* exists in the graph G. We want to determine the maximum possible value for the size of this set, |S|.\n\nLet *k_max* be the size of the largest induced clique in G. This value is also known as the clique number of the graph, ω(G). By definition, *k_max* is an element of S, and it is the largest element in S. Since the graph only has 128 vertices, *k_max* can be at most 128.\n\nLet C be the set of vertices of an induced clique of size *k_max*. The subgraph induced by the vertices in C is a complete graph with *k_max* vertices, denoted as K_k_max.\n\nNow, consider any integer *j* such that 1 ≤ *j* ≤ *k_max*. We can select any subset of *j* vertices from the set C. Let's call this subset C'. The subgraph induced by C' will also be a complete graph, specifically a K_j. This is because every vertex in C is connected to every other vertex in C, so this property holds true for any subset C'.\n\nThis implies that if a graph G has an induced clique of size *k_max*, it must also have induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to *k_max*. Therefore, the set of all possible induced clique sizes, S, must contain the set {1, 2, ..., *k_max*}.\n\nSince *k_max* is the largest possible clique size in G, the set S can be written as S = {1, 2, ..., *k_max*}. The number of different clique sizes is therefore equal to *k_max*.\n\nTo maximize the number of different clique sizes, we need to maximize *k_max*, the size of the largest possible induced clique in a graph with 128 vertices. The maximum possible value for *k_max* in a graph on n vertices is n.\n\nThis maximum is achieved by constructing a complete graph, K_128. In a complete graph, every subset of *k* vertices forms a clique of size *k*. For the graph K_128, we can find an induced clique for any size *k* from 1 to 128. Thus, for G = K_128, the set of induced clique sizes is {1, 2, ..., 128}. The number of different sizes is 128.\n\nFor any graph on 128 vertices, the maximum clique size *k_max* cannot exceed 128, and therefore the number of different clique sizes cannot exceed 128.\n\nThe maximum possible number of different clique sizes is therefore 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
