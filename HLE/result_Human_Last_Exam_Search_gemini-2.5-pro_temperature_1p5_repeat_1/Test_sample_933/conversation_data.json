    "The most efficient and widely cited method for the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) involves the direct reaction of xenon and fluorine gas.\n\nThis synthesis is typically carried out by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine in a 1:5 molar ratio within a sealed nickel vessel. The reaction is conducted at a temperature of approximately 400°C and a pressure of 6 to 7 atmospheres. While the temperature can range from 350°C to 450°C, 400°C is noted as the preferable temperature for the process. The use of a nickel container is crucial as it reacts with fluorine to create a passivating, non-reactive layer of nickel(II) fluoride on its surface, protecting the vessel from the highly corrosive reactants.\n\nAt this temperature, an equilibrium between xenon difluoride (XeF₂), xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄), and xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) exists. Lower temperatures tend to favor the formation of XeF₂, while higher temperatures favor XeF₆. Therefore, 400°C represents an optimal balance for the efficient production of XeF₄. The resulting product can then be purified from the other xenon fluorides by fractional sublimation, as XeF₄ is less volatile.\n\nWhile other methods, such as photochemical synthesis, can be used for producing xenon fluorides, these are often employed for creating XeF₂ at lower temperatures. The thermal method at 400°C remains the standard for efficient XeF₄ production.\n\n<<<B>>>"
