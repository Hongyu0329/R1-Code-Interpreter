    "The first step is to identify the group G generated by the given permutations. The permutations act on a set of 12 elements. By relabeling the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z\\}$ to $\\{1, 2, ..., 12\\}$ where $x=10, y=11, z=12$, the generators are:\n$a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, 11, 10)$\n$b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, 10, 7, 6)$\n$c = (1, 2)(3, 12)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, 11)(9, 10)$\n\nThis permutation group is the Mathieu group $M_{12}$. The Mathieu group $M_{12}$ is one of the 26 sporadic simple groups and has order 95,040.\n\nThe next step is to determine the Schur multiplier of $G = M_{12}$. The Schur multiplier of a group G, denoted M(G), is the second cohomology group $H^2(G, \\mathbb{C}^*)$. For the Mathieu group $M_{12}$, the Schur multiplier is a cyclic group of order 2, denoted as $C_2$ or $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. This was shown by Burgoyne & Fong in 1968, correcting an earlier claim that the multiplier was trivial.\n\nSo, the abelian group $A$ is the Schur multiplier of $G = M_{12}$, which is $A = C_2$.\n\nThe final step is to count the number of proper subgroups of $A = C_2$ up to isomorphism. The group $C_2$ has only two subgroups:\n1.  The trivial subgroup, $\\{e\\}$, which has order 1. This is isomorphic to the trivial group $C_1$.\n2.  The group itself, $C_2$, which has order 2.\n\nA proper subgroup of a group is a subgroup that is not equal to the group itself. Therefore, the only proper subgroup of $C_2$ is the trivial subgroup.\n\nUp to isomorphism, there is only one type of proper subgroup: the trivial group ($C_1$). Thus, there is only one proper subgroup of $A = C_2$ up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<1>>>"
