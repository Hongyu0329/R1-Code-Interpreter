    "The fictitious molecule \"mercedesbenzene\" is a playful term used in the chemistry community that combines the structure of a benzene molecule with the three-pointed star logo of Mercedes-Benz.\n\nA standard benzene molecule has the chemical formula C₆H₆, meaning it is composed of six carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal ring with one hydrogen atom attached to each carbon. The \"Mercedes\" part of the name is a visual pun, where the car's logo is imagined inside the benzene ring, but it does not alter the fundamental carbon structure of the benzene molecule.\n\nTherefore, the fictitious molecule mercedesbenzene would have 6 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<6>>>"
