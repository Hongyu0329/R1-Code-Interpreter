    "### Reaction of Butadiene and 1,1-Dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene Yields Cycloaddition Products\n\nThe reaction between 1,3-butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene results in cycloaddition products. This reaction can proceed through two primary pathways: a [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder reaction) to form a six-membered ring and a [2+2] cycloaddition to form a four-membered ring. The formation of these products is understood to proceed through a biradical intermediate.\n\nThe two main products of the reaction are:\n*   **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**: This is the product of the [4+2] cycloaddition, also known as the Diels-Alder adduct. In this reaction, the conjugated diene (butadiene) reacts with the dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene) to form a six-membered ring.\n*   **1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoro-3-vinylcyclobutane**: This is the product of the [2+2] cycloaddition. This type of reaction involving fluorinated olefins often leads to the formation of vinylcyclobutanes through a 1,2-cycloaddition mechanism.\n\nThe reaction conditions and the conformation of the diene can influence the ratio of the [4+2] and [2+2] adducts. For instance, the conformation of the diene plays a role in the mode of cycloaddition. The reaction proceeds via a biradical intermediate, and the stability of this intermediate can dictate which cyclic product is predominantly formed.\n\nSubstituents on the diene can also affect the outcome of the reaction. For example, alkyl substituents on the 2-position of butadiene can alter the population of the cisoid conformation, which is necessary for the Diels-Alder reaction, and can influence the relative rates of attack at different carbon atoms of the diene. While the reaction with unsubstituted butadiene can produce both types of adducts, the specific major product can be dependent on the precise reaction conditions which are not definitively specified in the provided context. However, the formation of both [4+2] and [2+2] cycloadducts is well-documented for the reactions of butadiene and similar dienes with fluorinated ethylenes.\n\n<<<The product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a mixture of two main cycloaddition products: 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene ([4+2] adduct) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoro-3-vinylcyclobutane ([2+2] adduct)."
