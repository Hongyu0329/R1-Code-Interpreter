    "To find the area of the smallest square that outcircles the given figure, we first need to determine the bounding box of the curve.\n\nThe parametric curve is defined in two parts:\n1.  For the interval  $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, the equations are $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = \\sin(t)$. This represents the upper half of a unit circle centered at the origin.\n2.  For the interval $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, the equations are $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = 5\\sin(t)$. This represents the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin, with a semi-minor axis of 1 and a semi-major axis of 5.\n\nNext, we find the maximum and minimum values for both x and y to define the boundaries of the figure.\n\n*   **For the x-coordinate:**\n    *   In the interval $[0, \\pi]$, $\\cos(t)$ ranges from 1 to -1.\n    *   In the interval $(\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $\\cos(t)$ also ranges from -1 back to 1.\n    *   Therefore, the minimum value of x is -1 and the maximum is 1. The total width of the figure is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **For the y-coordinate:**\n    *   In the interval $[0, \\pi]$, $\\sin(t)$ ranges from 0 up to 1 and back down to 0.\n    *   In the interval $(\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $\\sin(t)$ ranges from 0 down to -1 and back up to 0. In this interval, y is given by $5\\sin(t)$, so it ranges from 0 down to -5 and back to 0.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum value of y is 1 and the minimum value is -5. The total height of the figure is $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle with a width of 2 and a height of 6. The smallest square that can circumscribe this rectangle must have a side length equal to the larger of these two dimensions.\n\nThe side length of the smallest square is $\\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\nThe area of this square is the side length squared.\n\nArea = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
