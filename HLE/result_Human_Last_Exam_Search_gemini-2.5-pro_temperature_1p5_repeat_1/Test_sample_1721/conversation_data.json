    "The problem asks for the largest number `c` such that there exists a set `A \\subseteq \\{1, ..., N\\}` with `|A| = (c+o(1))N` for which the sumset `A+A = \\{a_1 + a_2 | a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}` contains no square numbers.\n\nThis is a well-known problem in combinatorial number theory. The construction of such a set `A` can be achieved by considering congruences modulo a specific integer.\n\nLet's consider the integers modulo 3. The squares modulo 3 are `0^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}` and `1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}` and `2^2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}`. Therefore, any square number must be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3. No square number is congruent to 2 modulo 3.\n\nNow, let's construct the set `A` by taking all integers in `{1, ..., N}` that are congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n`A = \\{n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} | n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\}`\n\nThe size of this set `A` is approximately `N/3`. More formally, `|A| = N/3 + O(1)`, which can be written as `(|A|/N) = 1/3 + o(1)`. This means that `c` can be at least `1/3`.\n\nLet's examine the sumset `A+A`. If `a_1, a_2 \\in A`, then `a_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}` and `a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}`.\nTheir sum `a_1 + a_2` will be congruent to `1 + 1 = 2 \\pmod{3}`.\nSince no square number is congruent to 2 modulo 3, the sumset `A+A` contains no square numbers.\n\nThis construction shows that it is possible to have a set `A` of density `1/3` whose sumset `A+A` avoids all squares.\n\nNow, we need to consider if a larger value of `c` is possible. It has been conjectured that the maximum density is indeed `1/3`, but proving this is a difficult open problem. However, significant progress has been made.\n\nThe work of authors like Sárközy, and more recently Lyall, Magyar, and Green, on this problem and its variations (like `A-A` or `A+B` not containing squares) provides strong evidence and partial results. For the specific problem of `A+A` avoiding squares, the construction modulo 3 gives the best-known lower bound. It is widely believed that this is the optimal density. For the purpose of this question, which asks for the largest *known* such `c`, `1/3` from the modular construction is the established value.\n\nTherefore, the largest number `c` is `1/3`.\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
