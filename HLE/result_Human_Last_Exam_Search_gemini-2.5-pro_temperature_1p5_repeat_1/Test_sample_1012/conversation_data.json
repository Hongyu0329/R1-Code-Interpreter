    "An arbitrarily powerful quantum computer could theoretically crack a symmetric key using Grover's algorithm, which provides a quadratic speed-up on brute-force key searches. This means that an n-bit key would effectively provide n/2 bits of security.\n\nTo maintain a secure level of encryption against such a quantum threat, the key length needs to be doubled. For instance, a 128-bit key, which is considered secure against classical computers, would have its effective security reduced to 64 bits by a quantum computer, rendering it insecure.\n\nTherefore, to achieve a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer—a level generally considered safe for the foreseeable future—a symmetric key of at least 256 bits is required. The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) now requires 256-bit AES keys for data classified as Top Secret to be resistant to quantum computing attacks. Organizations are advised to upgrade from 128-bit encryption to 256-bit to protect against future quantum adversaries.\n\n<<<A>>>"
