    "Four distinct elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with four or fewer crossings.\n\nThe knots with a maximum of four crossings are the unknot (0₁), the trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁). To obtain a homology sphere from an integral Dehn surgery on a knot, the surgery coefficient must be either +1 or -1. Analyzing the surgeries on each of these knots reveals the following distinct elements in the homology cobordism group:\n\n1.  **The Trivial Element:** Surgery on the unknot with either a +1 or -1 coefficient results in the 3-sphere (S³). In the homology cobordism group, S³ represents the trivial element.\n\n2.  **The Poincaré Sphere Element:** Both +1 and -1 surgery on the trefoil knot (3₁) produce homology spheres that have a Rochlin invariant of 1. All homology spheres with a Rochlin invariant of 1 are homology cobordant to the Poincaré homology sphere. The Poincaré sphere represents a single non-trivial element of order two in the group.\n\n3.  **An Element of Infinite Order:** The +1 surgery on the figure-eight knot (4₁) yields a homology sphere with a Casson invariant of 1. Manifolds with a non-zero Casson invariant are non-trivial in the homology cobordism group. This creates a third distinct element.\n\n4.  **The Inverse of the Infinite Order Element:** The -1 surgery on the figure-eight knot (4₁) results in the mirror image of the manifold from the +1 surgery. Its Casson invariant is -1. Since homology cobordant spheres must have the same Casson invariant, this represents a fourth distinct element, which is the inverse of the element generated by the +1 surgery.\n\nThus, the surgeries on knots with up to four crossings generate four distinct elements: the trivial element, one element of order two, and a pair of inverse elements of infinite order.\n\n<<<4>>>"
