    "The book of manners that Sir Launfal was preserved alongside is titled *Stans puer ad mensam* (A Boy Standing at the Table), a courtesy poem written by John Lydgate.\n\nThe late 14th-century romance of *Sir Launfal* survives in a single manuscript, now held in the British Library and cataloged as Cotton Caligula A. ii. This mid-15th-century manuscript is a compilation of various texts, including romances, religious poems, and works intended for instruction.\n\nAmong the contents of this manuscript is John Lydgate's *Stans puer ad mensam*. This work is a \"courtesy poem,\" a popular genre in the Middle Ages that provided guidance on etiquette and proper behavior, particularly for young people serving in noble households. One analysis of the Cotton Caligula A. ii manuscript suggests that its collection of romances, religious works, and courtesy poems was intentionally brought together to teach lessons in obedience and good conduct.\n\nAnother text that can be described as a book of manners, *The Babees' Book*, also has a version contained within the Cotton Caligula A. ii manuscript. Therefore, *Sir Launfal* was preserved with at least one, and likely several, works focused on manners and social conduct.\n\n<<<*Stans puer ad mensam* and *The Babees' Book*.>>>"
