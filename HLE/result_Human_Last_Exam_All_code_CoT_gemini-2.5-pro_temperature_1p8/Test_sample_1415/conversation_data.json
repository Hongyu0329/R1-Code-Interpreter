    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\nFirst, I need to evaluate the integral V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\nThis integral is of the form ∫ (u'(x)/u(x)) dx, where u(x) = F₃(x).\nThe antiderivative of u'(x)/u(x) is ln|u(x)|.\nUsing the fundamental theorem of calculus, the definite integral from 0 to 1 is:\n[ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1 = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|.\n\nNext, I need to calculate F₃(1) and F₃(0):\n1.  **Calculate F₃(0):**\n    *   F₀(0) = 0\n    *   F₁(0) = sin(F₀(0)) = sin(0) = 0\n    *   F₂(0) = e^(F₁(0)) = e⁰ = 1\n    *   F₃(0) = ln(1 + F₂(0)) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\n2.  **Calculate F₃(1):**\n    *   F₀(1) = 1\n    *   F₁(1) = sin(F₀(1)) = sin(1)\n    *   F₂(1) = e^(F₁(1)) = e^(sin(1))\n    *   F₃(1) = ln(1 + F₂(1)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n\nSince F₃(1) and F₃(0) are both positive, we can drop the absolute value bars.\nSo, V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)). This can also be written as V = ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0)).\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script to:\n1.  Compute the numerical values for F₃(1) and F₃(0).\n2.  Calculate V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\n3.  Calculate the final value by multiplying V by 10000 and rounding to the nearest integer.\n4.  Print the required numbers and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the mathematical problem as described.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the functions based on the problem description.\n    # F₀(x) = x\n    # F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n    # F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n    # F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n    def f3(x):\n        return math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(x)))\n\n    # Step 2: The integral of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) is ln(F₃(x)).\n    # The definite integral from 0 to 1 is ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\n    # Let's calculate the two numbers in this final equation.\n    f3_at_1 = f3(1)\n    f3_at_0 = f3(0)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the value of the integral V.\n    V = math.log(f3_at_1) - math.log(f3_at_0)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the final value requested by the user.\n    final_answer = round(10000 * V)\n\n    # Step 5: Print the results as requested.\n    print(\"The definite integral from 0 to 1 of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) is ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\")\n    print(\"The numbers in the final equation are F₃(1) and F₃(0).\")\n    print(f\"F₃(1) = {f3_at_1}\")\n    print(f\"F₃(0) = {f3_at_0}\")\n    print(f\"The value of the integral V is ln({f3_at_1}) - ln({f3_at_0}) = {V}\")\n    print(f\"The final result, the closest integer to 10000*V, is: {final_answer}\")\n    \n    # Return the final answer in the specified format\n    print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\nsolve_integral()\n```"
