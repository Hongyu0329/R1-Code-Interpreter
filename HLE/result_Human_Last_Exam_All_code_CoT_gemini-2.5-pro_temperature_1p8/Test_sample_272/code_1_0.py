(1) What is the cohomological dimension of H?
The group H has the presentation H = <a,b | a^2 = b^2 = 1>. This is the free product Z/2Z * Z/2Z, also known as the infinite dihedral group D_infinity.
The cohomological dimension of a group over Z, cd(G), is infinite if the group has torsion elements.
H contains elements of order 2 (e.g., a and b).
Therefore, cd(H) is infinite."""

(2) What is the cohomological dimension of G?

(3) What is the virtual cohomological dimension of H?
The virtual cohomological dimension, vcd(H), is the minimal cohomological dimension among all finite-index subgroups of H.
H = D_infinity contains an index-2 subgroup K = <ab>, which is isomorphic to the infinite cyclic group Z.
The group Z is torsion-free and its cohomological dimension cd(Z) = 1.
Thus, vcd(H) = cd(K) = 1."""

(4) What is the virtual cohomological dimension of G?
G = H * H. Since H is virtually Z (vcd(H)=1), G is a free product of two groups with vcd=1.
G has a finite-index subgroup that is torsion-free. This subgroup can be shown to be a non-trivial free group.
A non-trivial free group has cohomological dimension 1.

(7) What is the cohomological dimension of P as a pro-p group?
P is the pro-p completion of G, where p is an odd prime.
The pro-p cohomological dimension cd_p(P) equals the p-cohomological dimension cd_p(G) of the discrete group G.
The torsion in G is of order 2. Since p is odd, the order of torsion is coprime to p.
By a theorem of Serre, if the order of finite subgroups is coprime to p, then cd_p(G) = vcd(G).
We found vcd(G) = 1.

    # Question 9: dimension of H^1(G, F_p)
    q9_explanation = """
(9) What is the dimension of the cohomology group H^1(G,F_p) as an F_p-vector space?
The dimension of H^1(G, F_p) is the dimension of the vector space Hom(G, F_p).
Homomorphisms from G to an abelian group factor through the abelianization G_ab. So, dim(Hom(G, F_p)) = dim(Hom(G_ab, F_p)).
The abelianization of a free product is the direct product of the abelianizations: G_ab = (H * H)_ab = H_ab x H_ab.
The abelianization of H = <a, b | a^2=1, b^2=1> is H_ab = <a, b | a^2=1, b^2=1, ab=ba> = Z/2Z x Z/2Z.
So, G_ab = (Z/2Z x Z/2Z) x (Z/2Z x Z/2Z) = (Z/2Z)^4.
We need to find dim(Hom((Z/2Z)^4, F_p)). A homomorphism phi: Z/2Z -> F_p must satisfy 2*phi(1)=0. Since p is an odd prime, 2 is invertible in F_p, which implies phi(1)=0.
Thus, the only homomorphism is the trivial one.
The space Hom((Z/2Z)^4, F_p) is the zero vector space, which has dimension 0."""
