    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ with conductor $N=36036$ and order 6.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Factorize the conductor N**: We first find the prime factorization of $N = 36036$.\n2.  **Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem for characters**: A primitive Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of primitive characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n3.  **Use the property of character orders**: The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_k))$. We require this lcm to be 6.\n4.  **Count choices for each factor**: For each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$, we count the number of available primitive characters modulo $p^a$ whose orders are divisors of 6. Let this number be $C(p^a)$.\n5.  **Verify the lcm condition**: We will show that for any combination of such characters, the lcm of their orders is guaranteed to be exactly 6.\n6.  **Calculate the total number**: The total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each factor, i.e., $\\prod C(p^a)$.\n\nThe number of primitive characters of conductor $d$ and order $k$ is $\\phi(k)$ if $k$ is a valid order for a primitive character. The script will calculate the set of allowed orders for each prime-power factor and sum up the corresponding $\\phi(k)$ values.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Computes the prime factorization of a number.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return int(result)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Gets all positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N and order 6.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    order = 6\n\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(N)\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of N = {N} is {factors}.\\n\")\n\n    total_count = 1\n    all_choices = {}\n\n    print(\"Counting the number of allowed primitive characters for each prime-power factor:\")\n\n    # Case for p=2, a=2 (mod 4)\n    # The group of characters mod 4 is C_2.
