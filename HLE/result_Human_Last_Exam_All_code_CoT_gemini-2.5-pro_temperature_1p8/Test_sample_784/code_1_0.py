    # Step 1: Calculate passes for single-token choices.
    # To find the conditional probability P(choice|prompt) for all single-token answers,
    # we need just one forward pass. We provide the prompt to the model, and it outputs
    # a probability distribution for the very next token. We can look up the probabilities
    # for all 4 single-token choices from this one distribution.
    passes_for_single_tokens = 1

    # Step 2: Calculate passes for multi-token choices.
    # For a multi-token answer, we need to calculate the joint probability of its entire
    # sequence of tokens, conditioned on the prompt. The standard and most efficient
    # way to do this is to run a single forward pass on the concatenation of the
    # prompt and the answer choice. Since we have 4 different multi-token answer
    # choices, we have 4 different input sequences, requiring 4 separate forward passes.
    passes_for_multi_tokens = num_multi_token_choices

    # Step 3: Calculate the total number of passes.
    # The total is the sum of passes for the single-token choices and the multi-token choices.
