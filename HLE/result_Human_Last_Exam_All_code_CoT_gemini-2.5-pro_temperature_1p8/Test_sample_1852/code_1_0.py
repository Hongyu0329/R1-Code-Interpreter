    This script solves a set theory problem by formalizing the logical steps.

    Problem:
    Let <x_alpha : alpha < delta> be a tower of uncountable subsets of omega_1.
    X is the set of regular cardinals lambda for which such a tower of length lambda exists.
    Assuming 2^omega_1 = omega_2, find delta_1 + delta_2, where
    delta_1 = sup(X) and delta_2 = inf(X).
