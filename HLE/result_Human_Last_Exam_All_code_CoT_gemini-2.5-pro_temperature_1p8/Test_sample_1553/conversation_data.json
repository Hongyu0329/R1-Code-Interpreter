    "My plan is to identify the main character of the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" and then find information from the book's plot summary to determine the name of the character they marry. Finally, I will write a simple Python script to store and print this name.\n\n```python\n# The main character of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski.\n# According to the plot, his legal status as a resurrected anachronism is resolved\n# by a tribunal declaring him the husband of his guide.\n# This script will print her name.\n\nname_of_spouse = \"Angelika\"\n\nprint(\"The name of the character that the main character of Jacek Dukaj's novel 'Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość' marries is:\")\nprint(name_of_spouse)\n```\n<<<Angelika>>>"
