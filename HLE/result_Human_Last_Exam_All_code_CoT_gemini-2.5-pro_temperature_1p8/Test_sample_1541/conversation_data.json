    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, an analysis of the C program memory usage, and the final Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Read the Input**: The Python script will first read the entire line of input, which is the sum given as a string (e.g., \"3+2+1\").\n2.  **Extract the Numbers**: The script will split the input string by the `+` character. This will create a list of strings, where each string is one of the numbers in the sum.\n3.  **Sort the Numbers**: The list of numbers (as strings) will be sorted in non-decreasing (ascending) order. Since all numbers are single positive digits, lexicographical sorting works correctly.\n4.  **Reconstruct the Sum**: The sorted list of numbers will be joined back together into a single string, with `+` as the separator between them.\n5.  **Print the Output**: The final, rearranged sum string will be printed to the console.\n\n### C Program Memory Analysis\n\nFor the side task of calculating the memory usage `m` for a hypothetical memory-efficient C program, here's a breakdown:\n\nThe most memory-efficient C program for this task would not store the entire sequence of numbers. Instead, it would use a counting approach since the summands are limited to '1', '2', '3', and '4'. It would read the input character by character.\n\nThe variables needed would be:\n*   An array of 4 integers to store the counts for numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. On a typical system where `int` is 4 bytes, this uses `4 * 4 = 16` bytes.\n*   A `char` variable to store each character read from the input. This uses `1` byte.\n*   For the printing logic, a flag is needed to manage placing the `+` signs correctly. This can be an `int`, using `4` bytes.\n*   The printing logic requires two nested loops, each with an integer loop counter. These would require `2 * 4 = 8` bytes.\n\nTherefore, the total memory `m` used for variables would be the sum:\n`m = 16 (counts) + 1 (input char) + 4 (flag) + 8 (loop indices) = 29` bytes.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the plan described above.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a string representing a sum of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4),\n    sorts the numbers, and prints the new sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the sum from standard input\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Split the string by the '+' delimiter to get a list of the numbers\n    summands = s.split('+')\n    \n    # Sort the list of numbers. Since they are single digits,\n    # default string sort works correctly.\n    summands.sort()\n    \n    # Join the sorted numbers back together with '+'\n    result = \"+\".join(summands)\n    \n    # Print the final rearranged sum\n    print(result)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<29>>>"
