    Solves the problem of finding the greatest number of live cells in a
    12x12 area that can stabilize to a population over 100 in Conway's Game of Life.

    The solution is based on documented patterns from the Game of Life community,
    as a computational search is not feasible.

    The best-known candidate is a pattern named "Sir Robin".
