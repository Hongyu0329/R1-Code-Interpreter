# The problem is to find the smallest possible k such that the number of balls
# needed to cover the set Z(P, T) is O(D^k).

# Step 1: Upper Bound for k
# The number of balls N is proportional to the surface area A of the set Z(P, T).
# The area of Z(P, T) is found to be at most of the order of D.
# Area(Z(P, T)) = O(D).
# This implies N = O(D), so k <= 1.

# Step 2: Lower Bound for k
# We construct a polynomial P(x, y, z) = product_{i=1 to D} (z - 3i).
# Its zero set within the cylinder consists of D circular disks centered on the z-axis
# at z = 3, 6, 9, ..., 3D.
# Since these disks are 3 units apart, a single unit ball (diameter 2) cannot
# cover more than one disk.
# Therefore, we need at least D balls to cover the set.
# This implies N = Omega(D), so k >= 1.

# Step 3: Conclusion
# Combining the upper bound (k<=1) and the lower bound (k>=1), we get k=1.

k = 1
