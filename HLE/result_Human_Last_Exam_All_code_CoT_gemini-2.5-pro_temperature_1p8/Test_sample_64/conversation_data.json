    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent of 「弟」 (otouto), we need to consult a dictionary or a reliable linguistic resource.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown:\n1.  **Identify the word and its reading:** The word is 「弟」, and its standard reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n2.  **Look up the pitch accent:** The standard pitch accent for おとうと is typically represented by the number [0].\n3.  **Understand pitch accent notation:**\n    *   **[0]** corresponds to the **Heiban (平板)** pattern. The pitch is low on the first mora (syllable) and rises to high on the second, staying high for the rest of the word and any following grammatical particle. For おとうと, it's お(L)とうと(H).\n    *   **[1]** corresponds to **Atamadaka (頭高)**. High on the first mora, low for all others.\n    *   **[2], [3], etc.** correspond to **Nakadaka (中高)**. Low on the first, high from the second until the mora indicated by the number, then low again.\n    *   A number matching the last mora corresponds to **Odaka (尾高)**. Low on the first, high until the last mora, and then drops for the following particle.\n4.  **Match the notation to the pattern:** Since the pitch accent for おとうと is [0], its pattern is Heiban.\n\nThis Python code will demonstrate the logic and provide the answer.\n\n```python\ndef get_pitch_accent_pattern():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the Japanese pitch accent pattern for the word 「弟」.\n    \"\"\"\n    word = \"弟\"\n    reading = \"おとうと\"\n    # Pitch accent for おとうと is commonly noted as [0].\n    pitch_number = 0\n\n    pitch_patterns = {\n        0: \"Heiban (平板)\",\n        1: \"Atamadaka (頭高)\"\n        # Other patterns like Nakadaka and Odaka depend on word length.\n    }\n\n    print(f\"Finding the pitch accent pattern for 「{word}」 (read as: {reading}).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Explain the notation system\n    print(\"In Japanese pitch accent notation:\")\n    print(\"The number [0] represents the 'Heiban' pattern.\")\n    print(\"The number [1] represents the 'Atamadaka' pattern.\")\n    print(\"A number like [2], [3], etc., usually indicates a 'Nakadaka' or 'Odaka' pattern.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Determine the pattern for the given word\n    if pitch_number == 0:\n        pattern = pitch_patterns[pitch_number]\n        explanation = \"The pitch starts low on the first mora (お) and becomes high for the rest of the word (とうと) and any following particle.\"\n    else:\n        # This part is for other cases not relevant to the current word.\n        pattern = \"Some other pattern\"\n        explanation = \"N/A\"\n\n    print(f\"The standard pitch accent for {reading} is noted as [{pitch_number}].\")\n    print(f\"The number [{pitch_number}] corresponds to the pattern: {pattern}.\")\n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(explanation)\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the correct choice is Heiban.\")\n\nget_pitch_accent_pattern()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
