    "Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process. For a material to exhibit SPDC, it must possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as χ⁽²⁾. A fundamental requirement for a material to have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ is that it must lack inversion symmetry. In other words, the material's crystal structure must be non-centrosymmetric.\n\nHere is the plan to answer the question:\n1.  Identify the crystal structure and symmetry of common, stable, free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene).\n2.  Check if this crystal structure possesses inversion symmetry.\n3.  Based on the symmetry, determine if the second-order nonlinear susceptibility χ⁽²⁾ is zero or non-zero.\n4.  Conclude whether SPDC is expected to occur based on the value of χ⁽²⁾.\n\nThe following Python script executes this plan by printing the logical steps leading to the conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef explain_spdc_in_borophene():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the likelihood of Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC)\n    in free-standing boron nanosheets based on their crystal symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Helper function for printing formatted text\n    def print_step(title, content):\n        print(f\"--- {title} ---\")\n        print(textwrap.fill(content, width=80))\n        print()\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the fundamental requirement for SPDC\n    step1_title = \"Requirement for Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC)\"\n    step1_content = (\n        \"SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process.
