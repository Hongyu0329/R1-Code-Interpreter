    "To find the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring R = Z/8Z, we need to determine the number of orbits of the set of quadratic forms under the action of the group of invertible linear transformations, GL(2, R).\n\nA quadratic form in two variables over R can be written as `Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2`, where the coefficients `a, b, c` are elements of Z/8Z. This form can be represented by the tuple `(a, b, c)`.\n\nAn invertible linear transformation is a change of variables:\n`x = px' + qy'`\n`y = rx' + sy'`\nwhere the matrix of the transformation `M = [[p, q], [r, s]]` has a determinant `ps - qr` that is a unit in Z/8Z. The units in Z/8Z are {1, 3, 5, 7}.\n\nApplying this transformation to `Q(x, y)` results in a new quadratic form `Q'(x', y') = a'x'^2 + b'x'y' + c'y'^2`. The set of all forms that can be reached from `(a, b, c)` constitutes its equivalence class or orbit.\n\nThe total number of distinct quadratic forms is 8*8*8 = 512. The size of the group GL(2, Z/8Z) is 1536. A direct, manual classification is complex. A computational approach is more reliable.\n\nMy plan is to use a Python script to perform a brute-force search:\n1.  Generate all 512 possible quadratic forms `(a, b, c)`.\n2.  Generate all 1536 invertible matrices in GL(2, Z/8Z).\n3.  Iterate through each of the 512 forms. For each form not yet classified:\n    a. Calculate its entire orbit by applying every transformation in GL(2, Z/8Z).\n    b. Identify a unique canonical representative for this orbit (e.g., the lexicographically smallest form in the orbit).\n    c. Add this canonical representative to a list of unique classes.\n    d. Mark all forms in the newly found orbit as \"seen\" to avoid redundant calculations.\n4.  The final count of canonical representatives will be the answer to the problem. The script will print this count and the coefficients `a, b, c` for each canonical representative.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_quadratic_forms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables\n    over the ring R = Z/8Z.\n    \"\"\"\n    R = 8\n    units = {x for x in range(R) if x % 2 != 0 and x % 4 != 0}\n    \n    # 1.
