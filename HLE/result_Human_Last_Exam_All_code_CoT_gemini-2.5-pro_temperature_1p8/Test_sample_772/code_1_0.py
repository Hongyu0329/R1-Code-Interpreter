# The problem is to find the exponent alpha for the group G = SO_3(R).
# The exponent alpha in the relation n(N) ~ N^alpha is given by the general formula:
# alpha = 1 / d
# where d is the dimension of the group G.

# The group G = SO_3(R) is the special orthogonal group in 3 dimensions, which represents
# all possible rotations in 3D space.
# A rotation can be defined by an axis of rotation (a unit vector in R^3, which requires 2 parameters)
# and an angle of rotation (1 parameter).
# Thus, the dimension of SO_3(R) is 3.
group_dimension = 3

# The numerator in the formula for alpha is 1.
numerator = 1

# Calculate the value of alpha.
alpha_value = numerator / group_dimension

# As requested, we output the numbers in the final equation.
# The final equation is alpha = 1 / 3.
