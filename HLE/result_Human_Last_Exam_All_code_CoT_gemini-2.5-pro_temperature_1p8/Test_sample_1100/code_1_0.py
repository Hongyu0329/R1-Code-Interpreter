    print("\nStep 1: Identifying the Patient's Conditions")
    print("The patient's 8-year history of progressing false beliefs, visions, and poverty of speech strongly suggests a diagnosis of Schizophrenia.")
    print("The new postpartum symptoms (fatigue, increased chills, loss of pubic hair, and intense headaches during delivery) are classic signs of Sheehan's Syndrome, a condition where the pituitary gland is damaged due to blood loss or shock during childbirth.")

    print("\nStep 2: Identifying the Medications")
    print("The drug withdrawn was described as acting on the receptor of a compound involved in 'novelty-seeking behavior.' This compound is the neurotransmitter dopamine.")
    print("Therefore, the drug was a dopamine agonist, likely prescribed to counteract a side effect (like high prolactin) of the primary antipsychotic medication.")

    print("\nStep 3: Deciphering the Food Clue")
    print("The diet that 'tastes like bean salad' is a medical clue pointing towards a diet rich in Fava Beans (also known as broad beans).")

    print("\nStep 4: The Importance of the New Food")
    print("The most important fact about this new food is its chemical composition.")
    print("Fava beans are one of the best natural sources of L-DOPA (Levodopa).")
    print("L-DOPA is the direct precursor to dopamine.")
    print("Conclusion: Since the patient's dopamine agonist drug was withdrawn, the new diet rich in fava beans serves as a natural way to boost her dopamine levels.")
