# Step 1: Define the volume of the playdough.
volume = 1.0  # in cubic meters

# Step 2: Explain the physical reasoning.
print("To create the strongest possible gravitational field at a point A, the playdough must be shaped into a sphere with point A on its surface.")
print(f"The volume (V) of this sphere is {volume} m^3.")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 3: Calculate the radius (R) of the sphere from its volume.
# The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3) * pi * R^3.
# Rearranging for R, we get R = (3 * V / (4 * pi))^(1/3).
radius = ((3 * volume) / (4 * math.pi))**(1 / 3)

print("The radius (R) of this sphere is calculated as follows:")
print(f"R = (3 * {volume} / (4 * {math.pi}))^(1/3)")
print(f"R = {radius:.6f} meters")
print("-" * 30)


# Step 4: Calculate the furthest distance from A, which is the diameter of the sphere.
# The furthest point on the surface from A is diametrically opposite.
# This distance is the diameter (D) of the sphere, where D = 2 * R.
diameter = 2 * radius

print("The furthest point on the surface from A is the sphere's diameter (D):")
print(f"D = 2 * R")
print(f"D = 2 * {radius:.6f}")
print(f"D = {diameter:.6f} meters")
print("-" * 30)

print(f"The final answer is approximately {diameter:.6f} meters.")
