def solve_quaternion_rope():
    """
    Analyzes statements about a Quaternion RoPE scheme and identifies the true ones.

    The analysis of each statement is as follows:
    - A: False. The inner product depends on the signed relative position `m-n`, not `|m-n|`.
    - B: False. Quaternion multiplication is not commutative, so R_p cannot be factored out.
    - C: True. A fixed rotation axis `u` is necessary for the relative position property `R_{-n}R_m = R_{m-n}` to hold.
    - D: False. The formulation `R_m` encodes a 1D scalar position `m`, not a 3D vector.
    - E: True. `|R_m(v)| = |R_m * v| = |R_m| * |v|`. Since `R_m` is a unit quaternion, `|R_m|=1`, thus `|R_m(v)| = |v|`.
    - F: True. Scalar multiplication commutes with quaternion multiplication: `R_m * (αv) = α * (R_m * v)`.
    - G: True. Left multiplication by a unit quaternion is an isometry (an orthogonal transformation in R^4), which preserves inner products and thus orthogonality.
    - H: True. `R_m` and `R_n` share the same rotation axis `u`, making them co-planar. Their product is `R_m * R_n = R_{m+n}`.
    - J: True. `R_m` and `R_n` commute because they are co-planar. Their commutator `[R_m, R_n]` is the zero quaternion. `0 * v = 0`. The zero quaternion is purely imaginary (its real part is 0).
    - K: False. The real part of the result is generally not preserved.
    - L: True. The trace of the 4x4 matrix for left-multiplication by `q = a+...` is `4a`. For `R_m`, `a = cos(mθ)`, so the trace is `4cos(mθ)`.
    - M: False. The commutator is zero for any fixed axis `u`, not just one parallel to (1,1,1).
    - N: False. The magnitude `|R_m(v)|` is always `|v|`. For a unit quaternion, the limit is 1, not 1/√2.
