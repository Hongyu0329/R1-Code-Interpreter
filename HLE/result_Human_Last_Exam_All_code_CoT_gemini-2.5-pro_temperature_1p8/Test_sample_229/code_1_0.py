# Let's define the variables based on the problem statement.
# b4: number of black vertices of degree 4
# w4: number of white vertices of degree 4
# B3r, W3r: number of black/white degree-3 vertices with red edges
# B3b, W3b: number of black/white degree-3 vertices with blue edges

# From the mathematical derivation, we have the equation:
# 2 * (b4 - w4) = 3 * (W3r - B3r)
# This implies that (b4 - w4) must be a multiple of 3.
# Since b4 > w4, the smallest possible value for (b4 - w4) is 3.

# We must check if this value is achievable. Let's test the case b4 - w4 = 3.
# We can propose a simple graph structure to see if it works.
# Let's set b4 = 3 and w4 = 0.
b4 = 3
w4 = 0

# From 2 * (3 - 0) = 3 * (W3r - B3r), we get 6 = 3 * (W3r - B3r), so W3r - B3r = 2.
# A simple non-negative integer solution is B3r = 0, W3r = 2.
B3r = 0
W3r = 2

# A similar equation holds for blue edges: 2 * (b4 - w4) = 3 * (W3b - B3b).
# This also gives W3b - B3b = 2. A simple solution is B3b = 0, W3b = 2.
B3b = 0
W3b = 2

# These choices define the number of degree-3 vertices.
b3 = B3r + B3b
w3 = W3r + W3b
