    "The problem is to find the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion. This is a well-known problem in mathematics, and the solution is given by Witt's formula for the dimension of the n-th homogeneous component of a free Lie algebra.\n\n### My Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Formula**: The number of independent commutators of degree `n` in `k` generators (in our case, `X` and `Y`, so `k=2`) is given by Witt's formula:\n    `L_n(k) = (1/n) * Σ (μ(d) * k^(n/d))`\n    where the sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`, and `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\n2.  **Define Parameters**: For this problem, we are interested in terms of order `n = 10` with `k = 2` generators.\n\n3.  **Implement the Möbius Function (μ)**: I will write a Python function to compute the Möbius function `μ(m)`:\n    *   `μ(1) = 1`.\n    *   If `m` has a squared prime factor (e.g., 4 or 9), `μ(m) = 0`.\n    *   If `m` is a product of `p` distinct prime factors, `μ(m) = (-1)^p`.\n\n4.  **Implement the Calculation**:\n    *   Find all divisors of `n = 10`. The divisors are `1, 2, 5, 10`.\n    *   For each divisor `d`, calculate `μ(d)` and the corresponding term `μ(d) * k^(n/d)`.\n    *   Sum these terms and divide by `n`.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script that performs these calculations and prints out each step of the formula, showing the values for each divisor, the sum, and the final result as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors of a number.\n    e.g., for 12, it returns {2: 2, 3: 1}\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp_num = num\n    while d * d <= temp_num:\n        while temp_num % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp_num //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp_num > 1:\n        factors[temp_num] = factors.get(temp_num, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the Mobius function mu(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    prime_factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    \n    # If any prime factor has a power greater than 1, mu(n) is 0\n    for p in prime_factors:\n        if prime_factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n            \n    # Otherwise, mu(n) is (-1)^k where k is the number of distinct prime factors\n    return (-1) ** len(prime_factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of a number.\n    \"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_order_10():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10\n    in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion using Witt's formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10  # The order\n    k = 2   # The number of generators (X and Y)\n\n    print(\"The number of nonzero coefficients is calculated using Witt's formula:\")\n    print(f\"L_n(k) = (1/n) * sum(mu(d) * k^(n/d)) for d|n\")\n    print(f\"For this problem, n = {n} and k = {k}.\\n\")\n    \n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    equation_parts = []\n    value_parts = []\n    \n    print(f\"The divisors of {n} are: {divisors}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Calculating terms for each divisor d:\")\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        term_value = mu_d * (k ** power)\n        total_sum += term_value\n        \n        print(f\"d = {d}: mu({d}) = {mu_d}, term = {mu_d} * {k}^({n}/{d}) = {mu_d} * {k}^{power} = {term_value}\")\n\n        equation_parts.append(f\"({mu_d} * {k}^{power})\")\n        value_parts.append(str(term_value))\n\n    final_result = total_sum // n\n    \n    print(\"\\nPutting it all together:\")\n    full_equation = f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * [ {' + '.join(equation_parts)} ]\"\n    print(full_equation.replace('+ -', '- '))\n    \n    full_values = f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * [ {' + '.join(value_parts)} ]\"\n    print(full_values.replace('+ -', '- '))\n\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * {total_sum}\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = {final_result}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 is: {final_result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_bch_order_10()\n```\n<<<99>>>"
