    "Of course, I can help with that. This is an interesting number theory problem that requires a systematic search. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Number:** The number we are looking for is a nine-digit palindrome in base 17. This means it can be written as `d₈ d₇ d₆ d₅ d₄ d₅ d₆ d₇ d₈` in base 17. The digits `dᵢ` are integers from 0 to 16. Since it's a nine-digit number, the most significant digit, `d₈`, cannot be 0.\n\n2.  **Strategy for \"Largest\":** To find the largest such prime, we must start our search from the largest possible palindromic number and work downwards. This means we will iterate through the digits `d₈, d₇, d₆, d₅, d₄` from their maximum possible value (16) down to their minimum. `d₈` will go from 16 down to 1. The others will go from 16 down to 0.\n\n3.  **Optimization for Primality:** A prime number greater than 2 must be odd. We can use this property to optimize our search. A number written in an odd base (like 17) is odd if and only if the sum of its digits is odd.\n    The sum of the digits for our palindrome is `2×(d₈ + d₇ + d₆ + d₅) + d₄`.\n    This sum is odd only when the central digit `d₄` is odd. Therefore, we only need to test candidates where `d₄` is an odd number (1, 3, 5, ..., 15). This dramatically reduces the number of primality tests we need to perform.\n\n4.  **Efficient Primality Testing:** The numbers we are testing are very large (up to around 10¹¹), so a simple trial division primality test would be far too slow. A more efficient method is required. I will use the **Miller-Rabin primality test**. For numbers in this range, a deterministic version of the test (which uses a specific, proven set of bases) can determine primality with 100% accuracy and is very fast.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:**\n    *   The Python code will have a function `is_prime(n)` that implements the fast, deterministic Miller-Rabin test.\n    *   The main part of the script will consist of five nested loops to iterate through the digits `d₈`, `d₇`, `d₆`, `d₅`, and `d₄` in descending order.\n    *   Inside the loops, we will construct the base-10 number `n` from the digits.\n    *   We will then call `is_prime(n)`.\n    *   The very first number that passes the primality test will be our answer, as we are searching from the largest candidate downwards.\n    *   Upon finding the prime, the script will print the result in base 10, its representation in base 17, and the full equation used for its calculation, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform the search and find the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number n is prime using a deterministic Miller-Rabin test.\n    This test is reliable for n < 3,317,044,064,279,371.\n    Our maximum number is ~1.1 * 10^11, so it is well within this range.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n        \n    # Trial division for small primes as a quick filter\n    small_primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53]\n    for p in small_primes:\n        if n == p:\n            return True\n        if n % p == 0:\n            return False\n\n    # Write n-1 as 2^s * d\n    d, s = n - 1, 0\n    while d % 2 == 0:\n        d >>= 1\n        s += 1\n\n    # Bases for Miller-Rabin test sufficient for n < 3.3 * 10^15\n    bases = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]\n    \n    for a in bases:\n        if a >= n:\n            break\n        x = pow(a, d, n)\n        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:\n            continue\n        \n        is_composite = True\n        for _ in range(s - 1):\n            x = pow(x, 2, n)\n            if x == n - 1:\n                is_composite = False\n                break\n        \n        if is_composite:\n            return False\n            \n    return True\n\ndef find_largest_prime_palindrome():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest prime that is a nine-digit palindrome in base 17.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Searching for the largest prime which is a nine-digit palindrome in base 17...\")\n\n    # Iterate digits from largest to smallest to find the largest palindrome first\n    # d8 is the most significant digit, so it cannot be 0.\n    for d8 in range(16, 0, -1):\n        for d7 in range(16, -1, -1):\n            for d6 in range(16, -1, -1):\n                for d5 in range(16, -1, -1):\n                    # To be a prime > 2, the number N must be odd.\n                    # In base 17 (odd), N is odd iff the sum of its digits is odd.\n                    # The sum of digits is 2*(d8+d7+d6+d5) + d4, which is odd iff d4 is odd.\n                    for d4 in range(15, -1, -2):  # Iterate over odd d4: 15, 13, ..., 1\n                        \n                        digits = [d8, d7, d6, d5, d4, d5, d6, d7, d8]\n                        \n                        # Calculate the number in base 10 from its base-17 digits\n                        n = 0\n                        for digit in digits:\n                            n = n * 17 + digit\n                        \n                        # Test for primality\n                        if is_prime(n):\n                            print(\"\\n--- Found It! ---\")\n                            print(f\"The largest prime which is a 9-digit palindrome in base 17 is {n} in base 10.\")\n                            \n                            # Use A=10, B=11, ...
