# Plan: Calculate the number of carbons in the fictitious molecule "mercedesbenzene".
# The structure is interpreted as a central benzene ring with three phenyl groups attached.

# 1. Define the number of carbons in the central benzene ring.
carbons_in_central_ring = 6

# 2. Define the number of points for the "Mercedes" star shape.
number_of_points = 3

# 3. Define the number of carbons in each point, which we interpret as a phenyl group.
carbons_per_point = 6

# 4. Calculate the total number of carbons from the three points.
total_carbons_in_points = number_of_points * carbons_per_point

# 5. Calculate the total number of carbons in the entire molecule.
total_carbons = carbons_in_central_ring + total_carbons_in_points

# 6. Print the breakdown of the calculation.
print("Calculating the number of carbons in 'mercedesbenzene' (interpreted as 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene):")
