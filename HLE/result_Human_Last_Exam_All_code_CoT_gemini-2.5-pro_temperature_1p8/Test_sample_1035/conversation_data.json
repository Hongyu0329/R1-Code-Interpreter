    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  First, I will interpret the user's question. The question asks for the \"minimum number of vertices,\" but based on standard problems in graph theory, this is likely a misphrasing for the \"minimum number of bipartite graphs.\" The problem is a classic one: finding the minimum number of bipartite graphs whose edge sets combine to cover all the edges of the complete graph $K_n$.\n\n2.  I will state the known mathematical result that solves this problem. The minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover $K_n$ is given by the formula $k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$. This formula finds the smallest integer $k$ such that $2^k \\ge n$.\n\n3.  I will apply this formula to the specific case where $n=35$.\n\n4.  Finally, I will provide a Python script that performs this calculation. The script will use the `math` library to compute the logarithm base 2 and the ceiling function, and it will print out the steps of the calculation and the final answer, fulfilling the user's request to \"output each number in the final equation.\"\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_graph_covering():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover the\n    edges of a complete graph K_n.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 35\n\n    # The problem of finding the minimum number of bipartite graphs to cover\n    # K_n is a known result in graph theory.
