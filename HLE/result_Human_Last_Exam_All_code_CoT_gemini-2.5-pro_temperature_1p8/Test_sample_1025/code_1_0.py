# Step 1: Determine the rank for Question 1.
# Question 1: "What animal's coat color changed as a baby?"
# Doc 1's phrase "at a few months old" is a better match for "as a baby" than Doc 2's phrase "as they reached puberty".
# Therefore, the rank for Question 1 is 1.
q1_rank = 1

# Step 2: Determine the rank for Question 2.
# Question 2: "What animal's coat color did not change as a baby?"
# Both documents provide the identical, relevant sentence: "Cows retained the reddish-brown colour."
# This means they are equally relevant. We apply a standard tie-breaking rule and choose the first document.
# Therefore, the rank for Question 2 is 1.
q2_rank = 1

# Step 3: Construct the final ranking "equation".
# The final answer combines the rank for each question.
print(f"The rank for Question 1 is: {q1_rank}")
print(f"The rank for Question 2 is: {q2_rank}")
print(f"The final combined ranking equation is: {q1_rank}-{q2_rank}")

# Step 4: Map the ranking to the corresponding answer choice.
# The answer choice 'A' corresponds to the ranking '1-1'.
final_answer_choice = 'A'

print(f"\nThis ranking corresponds to answer choice {final_answer_choice}.")
print(f"<<<{final_answer_choice}>>>")
