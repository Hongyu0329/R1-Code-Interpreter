# Number of sets
num_sets = 2024
# Size of each set
size_A_i = 45
# Size of the intersection of any two distinct sets
size_intersection = 1

# As proven in the reasoning, the only possible structure is a "sunflower" with a
# common core of size 1. Let 'c' be the common element.
# Each set A_i can be represented as {c} U B_i, where |B_i| = |A_i| - 1.
# The condition |A_i_intersect_A_j| = 1 for i!=j implies that the sets B_i
# must be disjoint.
# Therefore, the size of the union of all sets is the size of the core plus
# the sum of the sizes of all the disjoint sets B_i.

# Number of elements in each set apart from the common element
size_B_i = size_A_i - size_intersection

# The total number of unique elements from the B_i parts
total_size_of_B_parts = num_sets * size_B_i

# The size of the total union is the sum of the common core and the B parts.
union_size = size_intersection + total_size_of_B_parts
