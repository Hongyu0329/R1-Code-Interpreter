def solve_properties_count():
    """
    This function determines how many of the seven given topological properties
    must always be true for the set S.

    The analysis proceeds as follows:
    1.  The properties of the function f and the set S are analyzed.
    2.  Two cases are considered based on the dimension n: n>=2 and n=1.
    3.  For n>=2, it is shown that S must be the entire space R^n. The properties of R^n are checked.
    4.  For n=1, counterexamples are constructed to disprove several properties.
    5.  The properties that hold true in both cases (and thus must always be true) are identified.
    6.  The number of such properties is counted.

    The properties that must always be true are:
    - Open: This can be shown directly from the definition of S.
    - Dense: For n>=2, S=R^n. For n=1, the complement of S can be shown to have an empty interior.
    - Trivial first singular homology group: For n>=2, H_1(R^n) = 0. For n=1, S is a disjoint union of intervals, so its H_1 is also 0.

    The properties that are not always true are:
    - Closed: A counterexample for n=1 is S = R \ {0}.
    - Connected: A counterexample for n=1 is S = R \ {0}.
    - Compact: A counterexample is S = R^n, which is not bounded.
    - Connected complement: A counterexample for n=1 is S = R \ {0, 1}, whose complement {0, 1} is not connected.
