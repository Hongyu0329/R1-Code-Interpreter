    "My plan is to solve this problem by first defining the given 3x3 matrix using the NumPy library in Python. Then, I will use NumPy's built-in function, `np.linalg.det()`, to compute the determinant. To meet the user's request to show the final equation with all the numbers, I will print the standard formula for a 3x3 determinant with the specific values from the matrix substituted into it, showing the full calculation. Finally, I will print the computed determinant value.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_determinant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the determinant of the given adjacency matrix and prints the calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the adjacency matrix A\n    A = np.array([\n        [2, -1, -1],\n        [-1, 2, -1],\n        [-1, -1, 2]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"The adjacency matrix is:\")\n    print(A)\n\n    # Unpack the matrix elements for displaying the calculation\n    a, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\n    d, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\n    g, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n    \n    # Calculate the determinant using numpy\n    determinant = np.linalg.det(A)\n\n    # Print the final equation with each number from the matrix\n    # The determinant formula is: a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n    print(\"\\nThe determinant calculation is shown by the following equation:\")\n    print(f\"{a} * (({e}) * ({i}) - ({f}) * ({h})) - ({b}) * (({d}) * ({i}) - ({f}) * ({g})) + ({c}) * (({d}) * ({h}) - ({e}) * ({g}))\")\n    \n    # Calculate and show the intermediate steps\n    term1 = e * i - f * h\n    term2 = d * i - f * g\n    term3 = d * h - e * g\n    print(f\"= {a} * ({term1}) - ({b}) * ({term2}) + ({c}) * ({term3})\")\n    \n    # Show the final step of the arithmetic\n    print(f\"= {a * term1} + {b * term2 * -1} + {c * term3}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal determinant:\")\n    # np.linalg.det returns a float, so we round it and cast to int for a clean answer\n    print(int(round(determinant)))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    compute_determinant()\n<<<0>>>\n```"
