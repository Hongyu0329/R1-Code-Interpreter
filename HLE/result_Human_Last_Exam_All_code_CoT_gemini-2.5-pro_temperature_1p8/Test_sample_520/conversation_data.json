    "The user is asking a historical question. I will find the answer and present it. Since the user requests the answer in the form of a script, I will write a simple Python script that declares the answer in a variable and then prints it to the console.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the historical figure: Andre Vernault.\n2.  Recall or look up the specific historical fact about his true profession.\n3.  Create a Python script that stores this profession in a variable.\n4.  Use the `print()` function to output the answer in a descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_profession():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the historical question about Andre Vernault.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Andre Vernault's true profession was unusual, which is why he concealed it.\n    profession = \"lion tamer\"\n\n    print(\"During World War II, counterintelligence in the UK falsely believed Belgian refugee Andre Vernault to be a German spy because he concealed his true profession.\")\n    print(f\"His true profession was: {profession}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_profession()\n```\n<<<lion tamer>>>"
