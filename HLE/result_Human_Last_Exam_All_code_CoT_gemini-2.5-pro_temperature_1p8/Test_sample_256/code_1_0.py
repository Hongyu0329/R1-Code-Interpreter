    Provides the symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 circles in a circle.

    The problem of finding the optimal packing of N circles in a circle is a
    well-known and difficult problem in mathematics. The solutions for many N
    are not rigorously proven but are the "best known" packings found through
    computational optimization. These results are compiled in online databases.

    For N = 1135, we consult these databases (e.g., E. Specht's "Packomania").
    The best known packing for 1135 circles is found to be asymmetrical.
    In Schoenflies notation, a group with no symmetry elements other than the
    identity is designated as C1.
