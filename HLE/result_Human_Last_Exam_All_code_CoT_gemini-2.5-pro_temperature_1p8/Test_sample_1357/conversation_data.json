    "To determine the number of types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve with a Jacobian having good reduction, we need to solve a combinatorial problem rooted in algebraic geometry.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Theoretical Connection:** The condition that the Jacobian of a curve has good reduction is equivalent to its stable reduction being of \"compact type.\"\n2.  **Definition of Compact Type:** A stable curve is of compact type if its dual graph is a tree. The dual graph has vertices representing the irreducible components of the curve and edges representing the nodes where they intersect.\n3.  **Genus Formula:** For a curve with a tree-like dual graph, its arithmetic genus `g` is simply the sum of the genera of its irreducible components, i.e., `g = Σgᵢ`. For this problem, `g = 4`.\n4.  **Stability Conditions:** For a component to be part of a stable curve, it must satisfy certain conditions related to its own genus `gᵢ` and the number of nodes on it (its degree `dᵢ` in the dual graph):\n    *   If a component has genus `gᵢ = 0`, it must have at least 3 nodes (`dᵢ ≥ 3`).\n    *   If a component has genus `gᵢ = 1`, it must have at least 1 node (`dᵢ ≥ 1`).\n    *   Components with `gᵢ ≥ 2` are always stable in a connected graph (`dᵢ ≥ 1`).\n5.  **Enumeration:** The task is now to count the number of valid \"decorated trees.\" This involves:\n    a.  Choosing the number of components, `k`.\n    b.  Partitioning the genus `g = 4` into `k` non-negative integers `gᵢ` (`Σgᵢ = 4`).\n    c.  Considering all possible tree structures with `k` vertices.\n    d.  Assigning the genera `gᵢ` to the vertices of the tree.\n    e.  Checking if all components satisfy the stability conditions based on their assigned genus and degree in the tree.\n6.  **Coding the Enumeration:** I will write a Python script that walks through this enumeration case-by-case, based on the number of components `k`, and sums the results to find the total number of types. The code will print the reasoning for each case.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of types of stable reductions of genus 4 curves\n    whose Jacobians have good reduction.\n\n    This is equivalent to counting the number of \"compact type\" stable curves\n    of arithmetic genus 4.
