    "Answering this question requires a careful look at the relationship between the two forms of LASSO regression, especially in cases where the solution might not be unique.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Understand the Two Formulations:**\n    *   **Constrained Form:** `argmin RSS` subject to `‚àë|Œ≤‚±º| ‚â§ t`. This minimizes the error (Residual Sum of Squares) while keeping the L1 norm of the coefficients below a certain budget `t`.\n    *   **Penalized (Lagrangian) Form:** `argmin RSS + Œª‚àë|Œ≤‚±º|`. This minimizes a combined objective function, where `Œª` controls the trade-off between fitting the data (low RSS) and keeping coefficients small (low L1 norm).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Equivalence:** The core question is whether for any solution `Œ≤ÃÇ` found with one method (for a given `t`), there exists a `Œª` such that `Œ≤ÃÇ` is also a solution to the other method, and vice-versa. In optimization theory, this relationship is handled by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and the concept of strong duality. For convex problems like LASSO, strong duality holds, which establishes a fundamental link between the two forms. This means that for any optimal solution to one problem, there is a corresponding parameter for the other problem for which it is also an optimal solution.\n\n3.  **Consider \"Strict\" Equivalence and Uniqueness:** The question uses the phrase \"always strictly true\" and the notation `(Œ±ÃÇ, ùõΩÃÇ) = argmin`, which implies a unique solution. This is the crucial point. The LASSO solution `Œ≤ÃÇ` is **not always unique**.\n    *   Non-uniqueness happens when the predictor matrix `X` does not have full column rank. This occurs if predictors are perfectly collinear (e.g., `x‚ÇÇ = 2*x‚ÇÅ`) or if there are more predictors than observations (`p > n`).\n\n4.  **Construct a Counterexample:** Let's create a simple scenario where the solution is not unique.\n    *   Assume we have one data point (`n=1`) and two predictors (`p=2`). Let `y = 1` and `X = [1, 1]`. The model is `y = Œ≤‚ÇÅx‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇx‚ÇÇ`.\n    *   The RSS is `(y - (Œ≤‚ÇÅx‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇx‚ÇÇ))¬≤ = (1 - (Œ≤‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇ))¬≤`.\n\n5.  **Examine the Solution Sets:**\n    *   **Penalized Form (`Œª=0`):** With zero penalty (`Œª=0`), this is just an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) problem. To minimize RSS, we need `(1 - (Œ≤‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇ))¬≤ = 0`, which means `Œ≤‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇ = 1`. The set of solutions is *infinite*: any point on the line `Œ≤‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇ = 1` is an OLS solution (e.g., (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1), (0.5,0.5)).\n    *   **Constrained Form:** To find the corresponding `t`, we must find the OLS solution with the minimum L1 norm. We need to minimize `|Œ≤‚ÇÅ| + |Œ≤‚ÇÇ|` given `Œ≤‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇ = 1`. The minimum value is 1, which occurs for any solution where `Œ≤‚ÇÅ` is between 0 and 1 (e.g., (1,0), (0,1), (0.5,0.5)). So, we set `t=1`. The constrained problem is now `argmin (1 - (Œ≤‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇ))¬≤` s.t. `|Œ≤‚ÇÅ| + |Œ≤‚ÇÇ| ‚â§ 1`. The solution set must satisfy both the goal (`Œ≤‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇ = 1`) and the constraint (`|Œ≤‚ÇÅ| + |Œ≤‚ÇÇ| ‚â§ 1`). The only solutions that satisfy both are those on the line segment from (1,0) to (0,1).\n\n6.  **Compare and Conclude:**\n    *   The solution set for the `Œª=0` penalized form is the **entire line** `Œ≤‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇ = 1`.\n    *   The solution set for the `t=1` constrained form is the **line segment** from (1,0) to (0,1).\n    *   The line segment is a proper subset of the entire line. The solution sets are not identical.\n    *   Therefore, the strict equivalence is **false in general**.\n\n7.  **Consider Practical Implications:** In many practical cases where `p < n` and predictors are not collinear, the OLS solution is unique, and the equivalence holds. This makes the statement \"often true in practice.\"\n\nThis analysis shows that the strict equivalence fails in general due to potential non-uniqueness of solutions, but it holds under more common, ideal conditions.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\n# Plan:\n# 1.
