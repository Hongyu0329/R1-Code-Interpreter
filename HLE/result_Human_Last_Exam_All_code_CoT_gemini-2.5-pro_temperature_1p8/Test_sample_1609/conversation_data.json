    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a problem from combinatorial circuit theory.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Problem**: The user is asking for `a(4)`, which is the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function with 4 variables.\n2.  **Recall the Theory**: This is a known result. The maximal number of prime implicants for an `n`-variable Boolean function corresponds to the size of the largest antichain in the poset (partially ordered set) of all product terms (subcubes of the n-hypercube).\n3.  **State the Formula**: The formula for this number, `a(n)`, is given by:\n    `a(n) = C(n, k) * 2^k`\n    where `k = floor((2n + 2) / 3)` and `C(n, k)` is the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\".\n4.  **Calculate for n=4**:\n    *   First, I will calculate the value of `k` for `n=4`.\n    *   Then, I will substitute `n=4` and the calculated `k` into the formula.\n    *   I will compute the values of `C(4, k)` and `2^k`.\n    *   Finally, I will multiply these two values to get the result.\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: I will provide a Python script that performs these calculations and prints the steps and the final equation clearly, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the number of variables for the Boolean function\nn = 4\n\n# The problem is to find a(4), the maximal number of prime implicants\n# for a Boolean function of 4 variables.\n# The formula to calculate this is a(n) = C(n, k) * (2^k),\n# where k = floor((2*n + 2) / 3).\n\n# First, we calculate the value of k for n = 4.\nk_numerator = 2 * n + 2\nk_denominator = 3\nk_float = k_numerator / k_denominator\nk = math.floor(k_float)\n\n# Next, we calculate the components for the formula a(4).\n# Binomial coefficient C(n, k) or \"n choose k\"\ncombinations = math.comb(n, k)\n# Power of 2\npower_of_2 = 2**k\n\n# Finally, we calculate the result a(4)\nresult = combinations * power_of_2\n\n# Print the calculation steps\nprint(f\"The formula for the maximal number of prime implicants a(n) is:\")\nprint(f\"a(n) = C(n, k) * (2^k), with k = floor((2n + 2) / 3)\")\nprint(f\"\\nFor n = {n}:\")\nprint(f\"k = floor((2 * {n} + 2) / {k_denominator}) = floor({k_numerator} / {k_denominator}) = floor({k_float:.2f}) = {k}\")\nprint(f\"\\nPlugging n = {n} and k = {k} into the formula:\")\n# The user wants each number in the final equation to be printed.\nprint(f\"a({n}) = C({n}, {k}) * (2^{k})\")\nprint(f\"a({n}) = {combinations} * {power_of_2}\")\nprint(f\"a({n}) = {result}\")\n```\n<<<32>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    If a(n) is the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables.
