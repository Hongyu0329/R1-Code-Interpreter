    "The task is to compute the Hopf charge of a given 3D vector field `n=(nx,ny,nz)`.\n\n### My plan:\n1.  **Interpret the Hopf Charge:** The Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) of a map from a 3-sphere (S³) to a 2-sphere (S²) is a topological invariant. Since the given vector field `n(x,y,z)` is normalized (`nx²+ny²+nz²=1`) and defined on all of R³, with all points at infinity mapping to a single point on S², it represents a map from S³ (the one-point compactification of R³) to S². The Hopf charge `H` for such a map can be calculated as the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct regular values on the target sphere S².\n2.  **Choose Two Points on S²:** I will choose two convenient points, `p₁` and `p₂`, on the sphere S².\n    *   Let `p₁` be the \"south pole\", `n = (0, 0, -1)`.\n    *   Let `p₂` be a point on the \"equator\", `n = (1, 0, 0)`.\n3.  **Find the Preimages:** I will determine the set of points `(x,y,z)` in R³ that map to `p₁` and `p₂`. These preimages, `C₁ = n⁻¹(p₁)` and `C₂ = n⁻¹(p₂)`, will be closed loops in R³.\n    *   The coordinates of the vector `n` are given in terms of spherical angles `G` and `f`.\n        `n = (sin(G)cos(f), sin(G)sin(f), cos(G))`\n    *   `p₁=(0,0,-1)` corresponds to `G = π`. The preimage `C₁` is the set of points where `G(x,y,z) = π`.\n    *   `p₂=(1,0,0)` corresponds to `G = π/2` and `f = 0`. The preimage `C₂` is the set of points where `G(x,y,z) = π/2` and `f(x,y,z) = 0`.\n4.  **Calculate the Linking Number:** I will compute the linking number `Lk(C₁, C₂)`. This can be found geometrically by counting the number of times one curve passes through a surface bounded by the other curve, taking orientation into account.\n    *   `C₁` is a circle in the xy-plane. It bounds a disk `D₁`.\n    *   I will find the intersection points of `C₂` with the disk `D₁`.\n    *   By establishing an orientation for the curves, I will determine the sign of the piercing, which gives the sign of the linking number.\n5.  **Python Implementation:** I will use a Python script to perform the calculations needed for the steps above, print the reasoning for each step, and output the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_hopf_charge():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the Hopf charge of the given vector field\n    by computing the linking number of the preimages of two points.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"### Plan to calculate the Hopf Charge ###\")\n    print(\"1.
