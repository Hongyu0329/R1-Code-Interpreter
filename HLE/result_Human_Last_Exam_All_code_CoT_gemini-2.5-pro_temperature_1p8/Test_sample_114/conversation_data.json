    "My plan is to solve this by programmatically analyzing the text of Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess\".\n\nFirst, I will write a Python script to download the full text of the poem from a public source like Project Gutenberg.\n\nNext, the script will process this text. The goal is to identify every unique word that Chaucer uses at the end of a line, as these are the words that participate in rhymes. To do this, I will:\n1.  Isolate the main body of the poem, removing any headers or footers from the text file.\n2.  Iterate through each line of the poem.\n3.  For each line, I'll extract the very last word, cleaning it up by converting it to lowercase and removing any trailing punctuation.\n4.  All of these line-ending words will be collected into a Python set for efficient lookup.\n\nFinally, I will check each word from the provided answer choices (Wente, Here, Fool, Hool, Countour) against the set of line-ending words I've collected. The word that is not found in the set is the one that Chaucer does not use in a rhyme in this poem. The script will then print out the word that doesn't rhyme and identify the correct answer choice.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\n\ndef find_unrhymed_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess\" to find which of a given\n    list of words is not used in a rhyme.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # 1.
