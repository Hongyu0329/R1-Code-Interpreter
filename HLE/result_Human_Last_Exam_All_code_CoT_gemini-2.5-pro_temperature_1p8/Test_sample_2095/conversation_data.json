    "My plan is to find the specific evaluation of Zhang Ji's (张籍) seven-character poems by Liu Ban (刘攽) by consulting classical Chinese literary criticism. The most likely source for this is Liu Ban's collection of critical notes, *Zhongshan Shijia* (《中山诗话》, *Poetry Talks from Zhongshan*). I will locate the relevant passage, analyze Liu Ban's judgment, and present it clearly in Chinese. To follow the instructions, I will wrap the final answer text within a Python `print()` statement, making it an executable script that outputs the requested information.\n\n```python\ndef liu_bans_evaluation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the exact evaluation of Zhang Ji's seven-character poems\n    by the Northern Song scholar Liu Ban, as recorded in his \"Zhongshan Shijia\" (《中山诗话》).\n    \"\"\"\n    evaluation_in_chinese = \"\"\"根据北宋学者刘攽在其著作《中山诗话》中的评价，他对张籍的七言诗评价不高，尤其认为七言律诗是张籍的短处。\n\n刘攽的原话是：“若七言律，尤是其短。”\n\n为了证明这个观点，他引用了张籍《送元家最小子赴举》中的诗句：“刺骨严寒偏便出，随车羸病亦须归。” \n\n随后刘攽评论道，这两句诗 “殊无丈夫之气，但见其寒苦辛酸而已。” 意思就是说，这些诗句完全没有男子汉的豪迈气概，只是展现了贫寒、困苦与辛酸的个人情绪，格局不大。因此，刘攽认为张籍的七言诗是其弱项。\"\"\"\n    print(evaluation_in_chinese)\n\nliu_bans_evaluation()\n```\n<<<根据北宋学者刘攽在其著作《中山诗话》中的评价，他对张籍的七言诗评价不高，尤其认为七言律诗是张籍的短处。\n\n刘攽的原话是：“若七言律，尤是其短。”\n\n为了证明这个观点，他引用了张籍《送元家最小子赴举》中的诗句：“刺骨严寒偏便出，随车羸病亦须归。” \n\n随后刘攽评论道，这两句诗 “殊无丈夫之气，但见其寒苦辛酸而已。” 意思就是说，这些诗句完全没有男子汉的豪迈气概，只是展现了贫寒、困苦与辛酸的个人情绪，格局不大。因此，刘攽认为张籍的七言诗是其弱项。>>>"
