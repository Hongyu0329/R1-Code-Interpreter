# Step 1: Define the given measurement data.
# P_out_0 is the probability of measuring |0> at the output.
p_out_0 = 0.36
print(f"The probability of measuring |0> at the output is P_out(0) = {p_out_0}")

# Step 2: Calculate the probability of the other outcome using normalization.
# P_out_1 is the probability of measuring |1> at the output.
p_out_1 = 1 - p_out_0
print(f"By normalization, the probability of measuring |1> at the output is P_out(1) = 1 - {p_out_0} = {p_out_1}")

# Step 3: State the core equation.
# Based on our interpretation of the problem, the probability of measuring |1> at the output
# is the square of the probability of measuring |0> at the input (|α|²).
print("\nFrom the problem's properties, we establish the equation: P_out(1) = (|α|²)²")

# Step 4: Substitute known values into the equation.
print(f"Substituting the value of P_out(1), the equation becomes: {p_out_1} = (|α|²)²")

# Step 5: Solve for |α|².
# |α|² is the input probability of |0>, which we denote as p_in_0.
p_in_0 = math.sqrt(p_out_1)
print(f"Solving for |α|², we get: |α|² = sqrt({p_out_1})")

# Step 6: Print the final result.
print(f"\nTherefore, the final value of |α|² is: {p_in_0}")
