    # - g3 is controlled by the black knight on e5.
    # - h3 is controlled by the black rook on h2.
    # - g4 is controlled by the black rook on h2.
    #
    # Case B: 2. Kf4
    # If the white king moves to f4, black can deliver checkmate with:
    # 2. ... f5#
    # The king is attacked by the pawn on f5. Escape squares are controlled:
    # - e3 is controlled by the black queen on a6.
    # - e4 is controlled by the black knight on e5.
    # - g3 is controlled by the black knight on e5.
    # - g4 is controlled by the black rook on h2.

    # Since both responses lead to a checkmate on the next move, this is a mate in 2.
