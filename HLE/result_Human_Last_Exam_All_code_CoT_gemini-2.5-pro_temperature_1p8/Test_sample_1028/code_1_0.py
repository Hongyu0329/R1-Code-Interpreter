    Analyzes the provided options regarding the identifiability of birth-death models.

    The core problem is that time-varying speciation (lambda) and extinction (mu)
    rates are not separately identifiable from a phylogeny of only extant species.
    Effective mitigation strategies must either:
    1. Add new data/information (e.g., fossils, priors).
    2. Reparameterize the model to focus on identifiable quantities.

    Let's evaluate the options:
    A. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 constant pieces: This simplifies the
       rate functions but does not solve the underlying identifiability issue within
       each piece. It doesn't add new information. It's a choice of parameterization,
       not a mitigation strategy.

    B. Incorporating prior information in a Bayesian framework: Priors add external
       information, which constrains the parameter space and helps to regularize the
       problem, thus mitigating identifiability issues. This helps.

    C. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5:
       This makes the model vastly more complex and flexible. High flexibility in
       the face of non-identifiability exacerbates the problem, as the model can
       fit the data well with many wildly different parameter combinations. This
       does NOT help; it makes things worse.

    D. Incorporating fossils tips and sampled ancestors: Fossils provide direct
       evidence of extinct lineages, which is the key information needed to
       distinguish speciation from extinction. This is a primary mitigation
       strategy. This helps.

    E. Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled diversification rate: This rate
       (and the pulled speciation rate) was shown to be an identifiable parameter
       combination. Focusing on what can be identified is a direct solution. This helps.

    F. Incorporating fossils tips in the phylogeny: As with D, fossils provide the
       crucial information about extinction. This helps.

    G. Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled speciation rate: Similar to E,
       this is a direct solution by focusing on an identifiable parameter. This helps.

    Conclusion: Options B, D, E, F, and G are all valid strategies to mitigate
    the problem. Options A and C are simply different ways to specify the
    non-identifiable model. Of these two, option C is particularly counter-productive,
    as it proposes a highly complex and flexible model that would make the
    non-identifiability even more problematic. Therefore, it is the clearest example
    of a strategy that does NOT help.

    answer = 'C'
    explanation = """Fitting a birth-death model with highly flexible functions like high-degree polynomials does not add any new information to resolve the non-identifiability between the speciation rate λ(t) and the extinction rate μ(t). In fact, it makes the problem worse. Such a flexible model can find a vast number of different λ(t) and μ(t) combinations that fit the data equally well, leading to extreme uncertainty and unreliable estimates. This approach exacerbates the identifiability issue rather than mitigating it. In contrast, all other options either add new information (B, D, F) or reparameterize the model into identifiable components (E, G)."""
