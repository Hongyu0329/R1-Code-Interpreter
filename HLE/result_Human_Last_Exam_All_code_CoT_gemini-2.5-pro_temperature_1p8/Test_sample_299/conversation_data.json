    "To find the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Analyze the fundamental properties of the function $f$.\n2.  Determine if $f$ can be strictly decreasing.\n3.  Determine if $f$ can be strictly increasing.\n4.  Construct the set of solutions and determine its cardinality.\n\n### Step 1: Fundamental Properties of $f$\n\nLet $g(x) = \\exp(x)$. The equation is $f(f(x)) = g(x)$.\n\n*   **Injectivity:** If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since $\\exp(x)$ is an injective (one-to-one) function, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n*   **Monotonicity:** We are given that $f$ is continuous. A continuous and injective function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n*   **No Fixed Points:** A fixed point of $f$ would be a value $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$. If such a point existed, then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. This would imply $x_0 = \\exp(x_0)$. The equation $x = e^x$ has no real solutions (the graph of $y=x$ and $y=e^x$ do not intersect). Therefore, $f$ has no fixed points.\n*   Since $f(x) - x$ is a continuous function that is never zero, it must be either always positive or always negative. So, either $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, or $f(x) < x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Step 2: Ruling out Strictly Decreasing Solutions\n\nLet's assume $f$ is strictly decreasing.\n\n*   If $f(x) > x$ for all $x$: Since $f$ is decreasing, its limit as $x \\to \\infty$ must be its infimum. Let $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = L$. From $f(x) > x$, taking the limit as $x \\to \\infty$ gives $L \\ge \\infty$, so $L = \\infty$. An infimum of $\\infty$ implies the function's range is the empty set, which is impossible.\n*   If $f(x) < x$ for all $x$: Since $f$ is decreasing, its limit as $x \\to -\\infty$ must be its supremum. Let $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = M$. From $f(x) < x$, taking the limit as $x \\to -\\infty$ gives $M \\le -\\infty$, so $M = -\\infty$. A supremum of $-\\infty$ implies the function's range is the empty set, which is also impossible.\n\nBoth subcases lead to a contradiction. Therefore, no strictly decreasing continuous function $f$ can satisfy the given equation.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Strictly Increasing Solutions\n\nNow, let's assume $f$ is strictly increasing.\nFrom $f(f(x)) = e^x$ and the fact that $f$ is increasing, we have:\nIf $f(x) < x$, then $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$, so $e^x < x$. This is never true.\nSo we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x$.\n\nThe range of $f \\circ f$ is $(0, \\infty)$. Let $I = R(f)$ be the range of $f$. Then $f$ maps $I$ to $(0, \\infty)$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing and continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range $I$ must be an open interval $(a, b)$, where $a = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$ and $b = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)$.\n\n*   Since $f(x) > x$, taking the limit as $x \\to \\infty$ implies $b \\ge \\infty$, so $b=\\infty$. The range is $I = (a, \\infty)$.\n*   $f$ maps its range $I=(a, \\infty)$ to $(0, \\infty)$. Since $f$ is increasing, this implies $\\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y) = 0$.\n*   By continuity of $f$ on $\\mathbb{R}$, we have $f(a) = \\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y) = 0$.\n*   From $f(x) > x$ for all $x$, we can apply this to $x=a$, giving $f(a) > a$.\n*   Combining these, we get $0 > a$. So, the lower bound of the range of $f$ must be a negative number.\n*   From $x \\to -\\infty$, we get $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} e^x = 0$.\n*   Also, as $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x) \\to a^+$. So $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y)$.\n*   This is consistent with $\\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y) = 0$.\n\n### Step 4: Construction and Cardinality\n\nThe conditions for a strictly increasing solution $f$ are consistent. We can construct such functions. The construction depends on the choice of the function's behavior on a specific interval.\n\n1.  Pick any $a < 0$.\n2.  Define $f$ on the interval $[a, 0]$. We need $f$ to be continuous, strictly increasing, and map $[a, 0]$ to $[0, e^a]$. We have $f(a)=0$ and we must set $f(0)=e^a$.\n3.  Choose an arbitrary strictly increasing continuous bijection $\\psi: [a, 0] \\to [0, e^a]$. There are continuum-many such functions. For example, for a given $a$, each positive real number $k$ defines a different valid function $\\psi_k(x) = e^a \\left(\\frac{x-a}{-a}\\right)^k$.\n4.  Once $f$ is defined on $[a, 0]$, its definition everywhere else is fixed by the equation $f(f(x))=e^x$.\n    *   For $x \\in (0, e^a]$, we can write $x = f(t)$ for a unique $t \\in (a, 0]$. Then we must define $f(x) = f(f(t)) = e^t = e^{f^{-1}(x)}$.\n    *   This process can be continued to define $f$ on $[a, \\infty)$.\n    *   For $x<a$, we can define $f(x)$ using $f(x) = f^{-1}(e^x)$.\n\nThe crucial point is that for each choice of $a<0$ and for each choice of the initial function segment $\\psi$, we get a different valid solution for $f$. The number of ways to choose $\\psi$ is the cardinality of the continuum ($\\mathfrak{c}$, the size of the set of real numbers).\n\nThus, there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such functions.\n\nThe set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. Since our set of solutions is a subset of this, its cardinality can be no more than $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nCombining the two results $|S| \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$ and $|S| \\le \\mathfrak{c}$, we conclude that the cardinality of the set of solutions is exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$. In mathematics, this is often denoted by 'c' or 'C'.\n\n```python\n# This problem is a mathematical one regarding functional equations and set theory.\n# The reasoning outlined above shows that there are no decreasing solutions,\n# but a continuum of increasing solutions.\n# The cardinality of the set of solutions is therefore the cardinality of the continuum.\n# This value is denoted by 'C' in set theory contexts (or also as 'c', or as 2 to the power of aleph-null).\n\n# As per the required output format, the code prints this cardinality symbol.\nprint('C')\n```\n<<<C>>>"
