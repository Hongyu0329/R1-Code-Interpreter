# This problem is a mathematical one regarding functional equations and set theory.
# The reasoning outlined above shows that there are no decreasing solutions,
# but a continuum of increasing solutions.
# The cardinality of the set of solutions is therefore the cardinality of the continuum.
# This value is denoted by 'C' in set theory contexts (or also as 'c', or as 2 to the power of aleph-null).

# As per the required output format, the code prints this cardinality symbol.
print('C')
