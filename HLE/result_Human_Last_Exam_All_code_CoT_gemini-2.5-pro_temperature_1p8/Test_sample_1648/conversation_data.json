    "To find the largest natural number `n` such that the `(2n)`-th K-group of `Z/27` is non-zero, we need to analyze the structure of these K-groups. The ring in question is `R = Z/27 = Z/3^3`. This is a ring of the form `Z/p^k` with the odd prime `p=3` and `k=3`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Consult K-theory results:** The algebraic K-groups of `Z/p^k` have been computed. A crucial result states that for `p` an odd prime, the group `K_{2n}(Z/p^k)` is non-zero if and only if `n` is a multiple of `p-1`. In our case, `p=3`, so `p-1=2`. This means `K_{2n}(Z/27)` can only be non-zero if `n` is an even number.\n\n2.  **Find the formula for the group order:** For even `n`, the group `K_{2n}(Z/p^k)` is a finite `p`-group, isomorphic to `Z/p^E` for some exponent `E`. More precise calculations based on topological cyclic homology by Angeltveit, Hill, Lawson, and Rognes give the formula for the exponent `E`:\n    `E = k-1 + \\nu_p(\\binom{n+p-2}{p-2}) - \\nu_p(\\lfloor n/(p-1) \\rfloor!)`\n    where `\\nu_p(x)` is the `p`-adic valuation of `x` (the exponent of `p` in the prime factorization of `x`).\n\n3.  **Apply the formula to our specific case:**\n    *   `p=3` (since the modulus is `27=3^3`)\n    *   `k=3`\n    *   `n` is an even number. Let `n=2m` for `m \\ge 1`.\n    *   `p-1 = 2`\n    *   `\\lfloor n/(p-1) \\rfloor! = \\lfloor 2m/2 \\rfloor! = m! = (n/2)!`\n    *   `\\binom{n+p-2}{p-2} = \\binom{n+3-2}{3-2} = \\binom{n+1}{1} = n+1`\n\n    Substituting these values into the formula for `E`:\n    `E = 3-1 + \\nu_3(n+1) - \\nu_3((n/2)!) = 2 + \\nu_3(n+1) - \\nu_3((n/2)!)`\n\n4.  **Determine the condition for non-zero K-group:** The group `K_{2n}(Z/27) \\cong Z/3^E` is non-zero if and only if `E > 0`. So we need to find the largest even natural number `n` that satisfies the inequality:\n    `2 + \\nu_3(n+1) > \\nu_3((n/2)!)`\n\n5.  **Perform a search:** The term `\\nu_3((n/2)!)` grows approximately linearly with `n`, while `\\nu_3(n+1)` grows much slower (logarithmically). This means the inequality will only hold for small values of `n`. We can write a Python script to search for the largest `n` that satisfies this condition. The script will iterate through even `n`, calculate the value of `E`, and report the last value of `n` for which `E` is positive.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the search:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef p_adic_valuation(n, p):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the p-adic valuation of n, denoted as nu_p(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    count = 0\n    while n % p == 0 and n != 0:\n        count += 1\n        n //= p\n    return count\n\ndef p_adic_valuation_factorial(n, p):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the p-adic valuation of n! using Legendre's formula.\"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return float('nan')\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    count = 0\n    power_of_p = p\n    while power_of_p <= n:\n        count += n // power_of_p\n        power_of_p *= p\n    return count\n\ndef solve_k_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest natural number n such that the (2n)th K-group of Z/27 is nonzero.\n    \"\"\"\n    p = 3\n    k = 3\n    \n    largest_n = 0\n    # The exponent E will become negative for large n, so we can limit the search.\n    # A search up to n=100 is more than sufficient.\n    print(\"Searching for the largest natural number n...\")\n    print(\"n | n+1 | (n/2)! | nu_3(n+1) | nu_3((n/2)!) | E = 2 + nu_3(n+1) - nu_3((n/2)!) | K_{2n}(Z/27) is non-zero?\")\n    print(\"-\" * 100)\n\n    for n in range(2, 101, 2):\n        n_div_2 = n // 2\n        \n        nu_3_n_plus_1 = p_adic_valuation(n + 1, p)\n        nu_3_n_div_2_factorial = p_adic_valuation_factorial(n_div_2, p)\n        \n        exponent = (k - 1) + nu_3_n_plus_1 - nu_3_n_div_2_factorial\n        is_nonzero = exponent > 0\n        \n        if is_nonzero:\n            largest_n = n\n        \n        print(f\"{n:2} | {n+1:3} | {n_div_2:2}!   | {nu_3_n_plus_1:9} | {nu_3_n_div_2_factorial:12} | {exponent:33} | {is_nonzero}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*40)\n    print(f\"The largest natural number n is: {largest_n}\")\n    print(\"=\"*40)\n\nsolve_k_theory_problem()\n\n```\n<<<14>>>"
