    "To solve for the common eigenvalues of the total angular momentum operators $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron, we can follow these steps:\n\n### **Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers**: For a \"p-electron,\" the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=1`, and the spin quantum number is `s=1/2`.\n2.  **Find Total Angular Momentum (j)**: The total angular momentum quantum number `j` can take values from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n3.  **Calculate $J^2$ Eigenvalues**: For each possible value of `j`, the eigenvalue of the $J^2$ operator is given by the formula $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$.\n4.  **Find Magnetic Quantum Number ($m_j$)**: For each value of `j`, the magnetic quantum number `m_j` can take values from `-j` to `j` in integer steps.\n5.  **Calculate $J_z$ Eigenvalues**: For each possible value of `m_j`, the eigenvalue of the $J_z$ operator is given by the formula $\\hbar m_j$.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: A Python script will be created to perform these calculations. It will use the `fractions` module to handle the half-integer values accurately and print all the resulting pairs of eigenvalues in a clear format, showing the intermediate steps of the calculation as requested.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to systematically find and display all the common eigenvalues.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and Jz\n    for a p-electron (l=1, s=1/2).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the quantum numbers for a p-electron.\n    l = 1\n    s = Fraction(1, 2)\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with orbital quantum number l = {l} and spin quantum number s = {s}.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Determine the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j.\n    # j ranges from |l-s| to l+s in integer steps.\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    \n    j_values = []\n    current_j = j_min\n    while current_j <= j_max:\n        j_values.append(current_j)\n        current_j += 1\n        \n    print(f\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are: {', '.join(map(str, j_values))}\\n\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z are:\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Iterate through each possible j value\n    for j in j_values:\n        # Step 3: Calculate the eigenvalue of J^2.\n        # Eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1)ħ^2.\n        j_squared_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        # Step 4: Determine the possible values for the magnetic quantum number m_j.\n        # m_j ranges from -j to +j in integer steps.\n        m_j = -j\n        while m_j <= j:\n            # Step 5: The eigenvalue of J_z is m_j*ħ.\n            jz_eigenvalue = m_j\n            \n            # Print the results in a detailed format\n            print(f\"For quantum numbers (j = {j}, m_j = {m_j}):\")\n            \n            # Show the calculation for the J^2 eigenvalue\n            print(f\"  Eigenvalue of J^2 = j(j+1)ħ² = {j} * ({j} + 1)ħ² = {j_squared_eigenvalue}ħ²\")\n            \n            # Show the calculation for the J_z eigenvalue\n            print(f\"  Eigenvalue of J_z = m_j*ħ = {jz_eigenvalue}ħ\\n\")\n            \n            m_j += 1\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n\n```"
