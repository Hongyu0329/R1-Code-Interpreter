    "To find the total welfare, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Supply and Demand Functions**: We will represent the given supply `P = ln(Q³ - 2)` and demand `P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))` functions in Python. It's important to note the domain of the supply function, which is only defined for `Q³ - 2 > 0`, meaning `Q > 2^(1/3)`.\n\n2.  **Find the Market Equilibrium**: The equilibrium point (Qₑ, Pₑ) occurs where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, and thus the supply price equals the demand price. We need to solve the equation `ln(Q³ - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))` for `Q`. Since this is a transcendental equation, it's best solved numerically. We'll use a numerical solver from the `scipy` library to find the equilibrium quantity `Qₑ`. After finding `Qₑ`, we can substitute it back into either the supply or demand function to find the equilibrium price `Pₑ`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Welfare**: Total welfare is the sum of consumer and producer surplus. It can be calculated by integrating the difference between the demand curve and the supply curve, from the minimum quantity where the market exists up to the equilibrium quantity. The integral for total welfare is:\n    Total Welfare = ∫ [from Q_min to Qₑ] (P_demand(Q) - P_supply(Q)) dQ\n    The lower bound of integration, `Q_min`, is the minimum quantity for which the supply function is defined, which is `2^(1/3)`. The upper bound is the equilibrium quantity `Qₑ`. We will use numerical integration to compute this definite integral.\n\n4.  **Output the Results**: The Python script will calculate and print the equilibrium quantity `Qₑ`, the equilibrium price `Pₑ`, the components of the welfare integral, and the final total welfare value.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import root_scalar\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_and_print_welfare():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function defines the supply and demand equations, finds the market\n    equilibrium, calculates the total welfare, and prints all results.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
