    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the task.\n\nFirst, I will address the competitive programming problem itself by providing a Python solution, as per the general instructions. The Python script will read two strings, convert them to the same case (lowercase), and then compare them lexicographically to produce the required output (-1, 1, or 0).\n\nSecond, I will address the specific task of analyzing the memory usage for an optimal C program. To write the most memory-efficient C program, one should avoid storing both strings in memory if possible. The optimal approach is:\n1.  Read the first string into a character array buffer. The maximum length is 100, so a buffer of size 101 (for the null terminator `\\0`) is needed. This will use `101 * sizeof(char)` = 101 bytes.\n2.  Declare an index variable to loop through the first string. Since the length is at most 100, an `unsigned char` is sufficient, using 1 byte.\n3.  Read the second string character by character using `getchar()`. The return value of `getchar()` must be stored in an `int` to correctly handle the `EOF` (End-Of-File) marker. This `int` variable will use 4 bytes on most systems.\n4.  In a loop, compare the character from the stored first string with the newly read character from the second string. The comparison stops at the first differing character.\n\nThe total memory `m` used by the variables in this C program would be the sum of the memory for these three variables:\nm = (memory for string buffer) + (memory for index) + (memory for getchar character)\nm = 101 bytes + 1 byte + 4 bytes = 106 bytes.\n\nNow, here is the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Petya and Strings problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Read the first string from input\n        s1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        # Read the second string from input\n        s2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n        # Convert both strings to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\n        s1_lower = s1.lower()\n        s2_lower = s2.lower()\n\n        # Perform lexicographical comparison\n        if s1_lower < s2_lower:\n            print(\"-1\")\n        elif s1_lower > s2_lower:\n            print(\"1\")\n        else:\n            print(\"0\")\n\n    except IndexError:\n        # Handle cases with fewer than two lines of input gracefully\n        pass\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<106>>>"
