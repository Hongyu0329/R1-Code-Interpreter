# This is a standard result from geometric group theory:
# The stable commutator length of the commutator of generators [a, b]
# in a free group F = <a, b> is 1/2.
scl_of_base_commutator = 0.5

# The stable commutator length (scl) has a property called homogeneity:
# scl(g^n) = n * scl(g).
# So, the scl of c_i^30 in F_i is 30 * scl(c_i).
scl_of_powered_commutator = power * scl_of_base_commutator

# Scl is additive over free products for elements from the commutator subgroups
# of the respective factors.
# scl_G(product of g_i) = sum of scl_Fi(g_i).
# Since all terms are identical, the total scl is the sum of 19 identical values.
total_scl = num_groups * scl_of_powered_commutator

# Output the components of the calculation and the final result as an equation.
