# --- Analysis of Statement 1 ---
print("Analysis of Statement 1: 'There is no selection occurring on the phenotype measured.'")
print("This statement MUST BE TRUE.")
print("Reasoning: The problem explicitly states that the phenotype has 'no bearing on fitness' and that 'all genotypes have equal fitness'. Natural selection is defined by the differential fitness of individuals. If there is no differential fitness, there is no selection by definition.")
print("-" * 60)

# --- Analysis of Statement 2 ---
print("Analysis of Statement 2: 'Parents will not raise their offspring.'")
print("This statement DOES NOT HAVE TO BE TRUE.")
print("Reasoning: The problem states the population has 'discrete and non-overlapping generations', meaning the parental generation is not alive when the offspring generation matures. However, this does not rule out all forms of parental care, such as guarding eggs or caring for very young juveniles before the parents die. Therefore, we cannot be certain this statement is always true.")
print("-" * 60)

# --- Analysis of Statement 3 ---
print("Analysis of Statement 3: 'The population will never speciate even in future generations.'")
print("This statement DOES NOT HAVE TO BE TRUE.")
print("Reasoning: The conditions preventing evolution (no selection, mutation, drift, or gene flow) are described as 'currently true'. The word 'never' implies these conditions must hold for all future time. The problem does not guarantee this. Future events, such as a geographic barrier forming or the introduction of new selective pressures, could lead to speciation.")
print("-" * 60)

# --- Analysis of Statement 4 ---
print("Analysis of Statement 4: 'The researcher will not find a substantial difference in the phenotype measured between the west and east groups.'")
print("This statement DOES NOT HAVE TO BE TRUE.")
print("Reasoning: The phenotype is a result of both genetics and environment. We are given the broad-sense heritability (H^2).")
print(f"H^2 = {broad_sense_heritability}")
print("This means the portion of phenotypic variance due to environmental variance (Ve) is:")
print(f"1 - H^2 = 1 - {broad_sense_heritability} = {environmental_variance_component:.1f}")
print("Since 30% of the variance is environmental, and the problem does not state that the environment is uniform across the entire region, a systematic environmental difference between the west and east could cause a substantial difference in the average phenotype, even if the genetic makeup is uniform due to random mating.")

print("Based on the analysis, only Statement 1 is a necessary consequence of the information given.")
