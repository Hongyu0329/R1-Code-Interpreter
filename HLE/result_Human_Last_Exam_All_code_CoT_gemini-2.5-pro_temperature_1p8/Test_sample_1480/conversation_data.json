    "To determine the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set using a t-norm operation, we need to combine the firing level of the antecedent part of the rule, `Phi_k(x′)`, with the membership degree of the consequent part, `μG_k_j(y_j)`.\n\nThe t-norm acts as a fuzzy logical AND operator. The most commonly used t-norm is the minimum operator. The calculation is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the given values**:\n    *   Firing level of the antecedent, `Phi_k(x′)` = 0.7\n    *   Membership of the consequent, `μG_k_j(y_j)` = 0.9\n\n2.  **Apply the t-norm (minimum operator)**:\n    *   Rule Activation = `t-norm(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n    *   Rule Activation = `min(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the result**:\n    *   The minimum of 0.7 and 0.9 is 0.7.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints the steps.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the given values for the k-th rule\n# Firing level of the antecedent part\nphi_k = 0.7\n# Membership of the j-th consequent\nmu_g = 0.9\n\n# The rule activation level is calculated using a t-norm operation.\n# We will use the minimum t-norm, which is the most common choice.\n# Activation = t-norm(phi_k, mu_g)\nrule_activation = np.minimum(phi_k, mu_g)\n\n# Print the result and the equation\nprint(\"The rule activation level is the result of the t-norm operation on the antecedent's firing level and the consequent's membership degree.\")\nprint(\"Using the minimum t-norm:\")\nprint(f\"Activation = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\nprint(f\"Activation = min({phi_k}, {mu_g})\")\nprint(f\"The calculated rule activation level is: {rule_activation}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
