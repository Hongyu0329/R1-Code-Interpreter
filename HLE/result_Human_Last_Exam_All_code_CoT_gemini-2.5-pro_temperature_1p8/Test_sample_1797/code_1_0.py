    Analyzes the provided statements about attack graph analysis.
    
    A. Correct. Describes the graph structure and standard analysis techniques.
    B. Correct. Accurately describes the state explosion problem.
    C. Correct. The problem is computationally hard (PSPACE-complete, which includes NP-hard), making this statement accurate in practice.
    D. Correct. Systems are dynamic, requiring incremental updates to attack graphs.
    E. Correct. Formal verification via model checking is a key application of attack graphs.
    
    Since all statements are correct, the function will identify that there are no incorrect statements.
