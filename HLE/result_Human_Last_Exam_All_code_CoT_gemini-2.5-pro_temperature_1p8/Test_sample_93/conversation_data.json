    "This problem asks for the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$. The order of the integers $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ matters, so, for example, $(a, b, c, d, e)$ is a different solution from $(b, a, c, d, e)$ if $a \\neq b$.\n\nA brute-force approach of checking all possible tuples of $(x_1, ..., x_5)$ would be too slow. A more efficient method is to find all unique *sets* of 5 non-negative integers that satisfy the equation and then calculate the number of distinct, ordered solutions (permutations) each set can generate.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Find all unique sets of non-negative integers $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$ that solve the equation. To avoid duplicates and reduce the search space, we will enforce an ordering, such as $x_1 \\ge x_2 \\ge x_3 \\ge x_4 \\ge x_5 \\ge 0$.\n2.  This can be achieved by using nested loops. The range of each loop is carefully constrained to maintain the sorted order and to ensure the sum of squares does not exceed the target of 2024. For each choice of $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$, we calculate the required value of $x_5^2$ and check if it's a perfect square.\n3.  For each valid set of integers found, we calculate the number of distinct ordered tuples (permutations). If a set has repeating numbers, the formula for permutations of a multiset is used: $n! / (k_1! \\cdot k_2! \\cdot ... \\cdot k_m!)$, where $n=5$ is the total number of elements, and $k_i$ is the frequency of each distinct element in the set.\n4.  The total number of solutions is the sum of the permutation counts for all unique sets found.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan. It will first find the unique sets and then, for each set, it will print the set, show how its elements form the sum, and state how many ordered solutions can be formed from it. Finally, it will print the total number of solutions.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve_diophantine_2024():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of non-negative integer solutions to x_1^2 + ... + x_5^2 = 2024.\n    It works by finding all unique sets of 5 integers {x_i} (with x_1>=x_2>=...)\n    and then calculating the number of distinct permutations for each set.\n    \"\"\"\n    target = 2024\n    found_solutions = []\n\n    # Pre-calculate factorials up to 5 for performance.\n    factorials = {i: math.factorial(i) for i in range(6)}\n\n    # Determine the absolute upper bound for any x_i.\n    limit = int(target**0.5)\n\n    # Use nested loops to find unique solution sets {x1, ..., x5} under the\n    # constraint x1 >= x2 >= x3 >= x4 >= x5 >= 0.\n    for x1 in range(limit + 1):\n        s1 = x1**2\n        limit2 = int((target - s1)**0.5)\n        for x2 in range(min(x1, limit2) + 1):\n            s2 = s1 + x2**2\n            limit3 = int((target - s2)**0.5)\n            for x3 in range(min(x2, limit3) + 1):\n                s3 = s2 + x3**2\n                limit4 = int((target - s3)**0.5)\n                for x4 in range(min(x3, limit4) + 1):\n                    s4 = s3 + x4**2\n                    \n                    # Calculate the required value for the last term's square.\n                    rem = target - s4\n                    \n                    # Check if 'rem' is a perfect square.\n                    x5 = int(rem**0.5)\n                    if x5**2 == rem:\n                        # Ensure our ordering constraint x5 <= x4 is met.\n                        if x5 <= x4:\n                            solution_set = [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5]\n                            \n                            # Calculate the number of distinct permutations for this set.\n                            counts = Counter(solution_set)\n                            perms = factorials[5]\n                            for count in counts.values():\n                                perms //= factorials[count]\n                            \n                            found_solutions.append((solution_set, perms))\n\n    total_count = sum(perms for _, perms in found_solutions)\n    \n    # Output the problem statement and the found solution sets.\n    print(\"The number of non-negative integer solutions for the Diophantine equation:\")\n    print(\"x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024\\n\")\n\n    if not found_solutions:\n        print(\"No solutions found.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Found {len(found_solutions)} unique solution sets, contributing to the total count:\\n\")\n        for s, p in found_solutions:\n            # Outputting the set and the equation fulfills the requirement to \"output each number\".\n            equation_str = \" + \".join([f\"{val}^2\" for val in s])\n            print(f\"Set {sorted(s, reverse=True)}: {equation_str} = {target}.
