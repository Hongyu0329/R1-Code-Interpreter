    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that solves the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Group:** First, I'll identify the group in question. The generalized quaternion group of size 128 is denoted as $Q_{128}$. Its structure is given by the presentation $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$. The group contains a maximal cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64.\n2.  **Define Power Subgroups:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there's an integer $k$ such that $H$ is the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in $G$, i.e., $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n3.  **Analyze Powers:** I'll analyze the set $G^k$ based on the parity of the exponent $k$.\n    *   **Case 1: $k$ is odd.** I will show that for any odd integer $k$, the set of $k$-th powers $G^k$ is the group $G$ itself. This gives us one distinct power subgroup.\n    *   **Case 2: $k$ is even.** I will show that for any even integer $k$, the set of $k$-th powers $G^k$ is a cyclic subgroup of $\\langle x \\rangle$. These subgroups are determined by the even divisors of 64 (the order of $x$).\n4.  **Count the Subgroups:** I'll count the number of distinct subgroups from each case.\n    *   The odd case gives 1 subgroup ($G$ itself).\n    *   The even case gives a number of subgroups equal to the number of even divisors of 64.\n5.  **Sum the Results:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from both cases, as the group $G$ (non-abelian) is distinct from the cyclic subgroups found in the even case.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** The Python script will perform the count of even divisors and print the explanatory steps along with the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 128\n    # For Q_4n, the size is 4n.
