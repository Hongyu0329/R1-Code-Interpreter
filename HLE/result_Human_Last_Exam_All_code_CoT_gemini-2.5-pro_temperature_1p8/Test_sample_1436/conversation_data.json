    "To determine the symmetry factor of the described Feynman diagram, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Diagram:** The diagram consists of two vertices. There are four field contractions between them, which means four identical propagator lines connect the two vertices. This is a common second-order vacuum diagram in theories like $\\phi^4$.\n\n2.  **Define the Symmetry Factor (S):** In perturbative quantum field theory, the symmetry factor is the order of the group of transformations (permutations of vertices and lines) that leave the diagram topologically unchanged. This number corrects for overcounting when integrating over all possible internal field configurations.\n\n3.  **Identify Symmetries:** We look for permutations of the diagram's elements (vertices and propagators) that result in the same diagram.\n    *   **Vertex Permutation:** The two vertices are identical. If we swap their positions, the diagram remains the same since they are connected by the same four lines. This contributes a factor of 2! = 2.\n    *   **Propagator Permutation:** The four lines connecting the vertices are identical. We can interchange them in any way without changing the diagram's structure. The number of ways to permute four items is 4! = 24.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Symmetry Factor:** The total symmetry factor S is the product of the number of ways each independent symmetry operation can be performed.\n\n    S = (Number of vertex permutations) × (Number of propagator permutations)\n    S = 2! × 4! = 2 × 24 = 48\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and display the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two vertices\n    connected by four identical propagators.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of identical vertices\n    num_vertices = 2\n\n    # Number of identical propagators connecting the vertices\n    num_propagators = 4\n\n    # The symmetry factor from permuting the identical vertices.\n    # Swapping the two vertices leaves the diagram unchanged.\n    vertex_symmetry = math.factorial(num_vertices)\n\n    # The symmetry factor from permuting the identical propagators.\n    # The four lines are indistinguishable and can be interchanged.\n    propagator_symmetry = math.factorial(num_propagators)\n\n    # The total symmetry factor is the product of the individual symmetry factors.\n    total_symmetry_factor = vertex_symmetry * propagator_symmetry\n\n    print(\"The symmetry factor (S) of a Feynman diagram is the number of permutations of its components that leave the diagram unchanged.\")\n    print(\"\\nFor a diagram with 2 vertices connected by 4 identical propagators:\")\n    print(f\"1.
