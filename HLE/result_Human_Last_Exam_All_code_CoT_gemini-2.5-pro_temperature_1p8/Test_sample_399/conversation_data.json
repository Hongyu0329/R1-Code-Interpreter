    "To solve the initial value problem, we first need to find the general solution of the differential equation and then use the initial condition to find the particular solution.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Identify and separate the variables:**\n    The given differential equation is $x'(t)=(t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$, which can be written as $\\frac{dx}{dt}=(t-1)x^2$. This is a separable equation. We can rearrange the terms to group all $x$ terms on one side and all $t$ terms on the other:\n    $$ \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt $$\n\n2.  **Integrate both sides:**\n    $$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\n    The integration yields:\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n    where $C$ is the constant of integration.\n\n3.  **Apply the initial condition to find C:**\n    We are given the initial condition $x(0)=-8$. Substituting $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation:\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n    $$ \\frac{1}{8} = C $$\n\n4.  **Write the particular solution:**\n    Substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution:\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n    To simplify the right side, we find a common denominator:\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{4t^2 - 8t + 1}{8} $$\n\n5.  **Solve for x(t):**\n    Now, we solve for $x(t)$ by taking the reciprocal:\n    $$ x(t) = \\frac{-8}{4t^2 - 8t + 1} $$\n\n6.  **Calculate x(1):**\n    Finally, we substitute $t=1$ into our solution for $x(t)$:\n    $$ x(1) = \\frac{-8}{4(1)^2 - 8(1) + 1} = \\frac{-8}{4 - 8 + 1} = \\frac{-8}{-3} = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\nThe following Python code performs this final calculation.\n\n```python\n# The derived explicit solution for the initial value problem is:\n# x(t) = -8 / (4*t^2 - 8*t + 1)\n# We will now calculate x(1) using this formula.\n\n# Define the value of t for which we want to find x\nt = 1\n\n# Define the constants from the formula\nnumerator = -8\nc1 = 4\nc2 = -8\nc3 = 1\n\n# Calculate the terms of the denominator\nterm1 = c1 * (t**2)\nterm2 = c2 * t\nterm3 = c3\ndenominator = term1 + term2 + term3\n\n# Print the calculation, showing each number in the final equation\nprint(\"The final calculation for x(1) is based on the equation x(t) = -8 / (4*t^2 - 8*t + 1):\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / ({c1}*({t})^2 + ({c2})*({t}) + {c3})\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / ({term1} + ({term2}) + {term3})\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / ({denominator})\")\n\n# Calculate and print the final answer\nresult = numerator / denominator\nprint(f\"The final value is: x(1) = {result}\")\n```\n<<<2.6666666666666665>>>"
