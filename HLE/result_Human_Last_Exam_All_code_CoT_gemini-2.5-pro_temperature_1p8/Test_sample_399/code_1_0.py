# The derived explicit solution for the initial value problem is:
# x(t) = -8 / (4*t^2 - 8*t + 1)
# We will now calculate x(1) using this formula.

# Define the value of t for which we want to find x
t = 1

# Define the constants from the formula
numerator = -8
c1 = 4
c2 = -8
c3 = 1

# Calculate the terms of the denominator
term1 = c1 * (t**2)
term2 = c2 * t
term3 = c3
denominator = term1 + term2 + term3

# Print the calculation, showing each number in the final equation
print("The final calculation for x(1) is based on the equation x(t) = -8 / (4*t^2 - 8*t + 1):")
print(f"x(1) = {numerator} / ({c1}*({t})^2 + ({c2})*({t}) + {c3})")
print(f"x(1) = {numerator} / ({term1} + ({term2}) + {term3})")
print(f"x(1) = {numerator} / ({denominator})")

# Calculate and print the final answer
result = numerator / denominator
print(f"The final value is: x(1) = {result}")
