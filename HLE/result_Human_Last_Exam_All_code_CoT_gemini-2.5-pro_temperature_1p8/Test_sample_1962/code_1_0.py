# The problem asks for the minimum cardinality of the set of functions g
# that can bound any given function f.
# Let kappa be an infinite cardinal.
# f is a function from kappa^+ x kappa^+ to kappa.
# g is a function from kappa^+ to kappa.
# The condition is that for all alpha, beta in kappa^+,
# f(alpha, beta) <= max(g(alpha), g(beta)).
# The value we are looking for is min |{g | g satisfies the condition}|.

# According to results in combinatorial set theory (specifically, Shelah's pcf theory),
# this minimum value is the cardinal 2^kappa.

# The result is a mathematical expression, not a numerical computation.
# We will print the result as a string. The equation is min_X_f = 2^kappa.
# The numbers in this equation are 2.
