    This function determines the correct statements from the list and prints the final answer.
    
    My analysis of each statement is as follows:
    A) False. A generator can have a continuous spectrum (e.g., momentum).
    B1) False. The premise [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0 with the given τ̂ is generally not satisfiable for H = T+V. My calculation shows [τ̂, Ĥ] for a V ∝ 1/r² potential is proportional to Ĥ itself, not zero. Thus, the statement's premise is ill-posed for the physical system in question.
    B2) False. A direct calculation of the transformation Ŝ(θ)x̂Ŝ(θ)⁻¹ yields a result different from e^θx̂, showing the statement is mathematically incorrect.
    C) False. The condition [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0 is both necessary and sufficient for [Ŝ(θ), Ĥ] = 0 for all θ.
    D) True. This is a direct consequence of [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0. Ĥ(τ̂|ψ⟩) = τ̂Ĥ|ψ⟩ = E(τ̂|ψ⟩).
    E) True. This is the definition of angular momentum as the generator of rotations, assuming ħ=1.
    F) True. This is a statement of Noether's theorem in quantum mechanics, derivable from the Ehrenfest theorem. d⟨τ̂⟩/dt = 0 for all states if and only if [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0.
    G) True. The premise [Ŝ(θ₁), Ŝ(θ₂)] = 0 is always true for S of the form e^{-iθτ}. The conclusion that τ̂ is Hermitian is a postulate of the theory presented in the primer. A true statement implied by a tautology is a true implication.
    H) False. An unbounded operator can have a discrete spectrum (e.g., the quantum harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian).
    I) True. The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula shows that e^A e^B ≠ e^(A+B) if [A, B] ≠ 0. Here, the generators do not commute, so the equality does not hold.
    J) True. This is a fundamental property of a symmetry operator Ŝ. If [Ŝ, Ĥ] = 0, then Ĥ(Ŝ|ψ⟩) = ŜĤ|ψ⟩ = E(Ŝ|ψ⟩).

    The true statements are therefore D, E, F, G, I, and J.
