A finite nilpotent group G is filled if and only if it is isomorphic to a direct product `G ≅ G_2 × G_3 × G_5`, where `G_p` is the Sylow p-subgroup of G and satisfies the following conditions:
1.  The Sylow p-subgroups for primes `p ≥ 7` are trivial.
2.  The Sylow 2-subgroup `G_2` is either trivial or isomorphic to one of the following: `C_2`, `C_4`, `C_2 × C_2`, `C_4 × C_2`, the dihedral group `D_8`, or the quaternion group `Q_8`.
3.  The Sylow 3-subgroup `G_3` is either trivial or isomorphic to `C_3` or `C_3 × C_3`.
4.  The Sylow 5-subgroup `G_5` is either trivial or isomorphic to `C_5` or `C_5 × C_5`.
