    "Of course. I will help you solve this by cross-referencing historical timelines.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the year of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n2.  Review Geoffrey Chaucer's biographical information and known travels for that specific period.\n3.  Use the information to determine his most likely location at the time of her death.\n\n```python\ndef find_chaucer_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines Geoffrey Chaucer's location\n    at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death by analyzing historical data.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Establish the year of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n    year_of_death = 1368\n\n    print(f\"Fact: Blanche of Lancaster died in the year {year_of_death}, likely from the plague.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Access historical data about Chaucer's activities around that year.\n    # By 1367, Chaucer was a member of the English royal court as an esquire to King Edward III.\n    # His famous poem, 'The Book of the Duchess', is an elegy for Blanche of Lancaster,\n    # and it is believed to have been written between 1368 and 1372.\n    # His first documented diplomatic mission to Italy occurred later, in 1372.\n    \n    chaucer_status_1367 = \"Esquire in the royal court of King Edward III in England.\"\n    chaucer_first_italian_journey = 1372\n\n    print(f\"Fact: In 1367, Geoffrey Chaucer's position was: '{chaucer_status_1367}'.\")\n    print(f\"Fact: Chaucer's first recorded trip to Italy was not until {chaucer_first_italian_journey}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Conclude based on the evidence.\n    conclusion = (\n        \"Based on these facts, Chaucer was serving the royal court in England \"\n        f\"in {year_of_death}.
