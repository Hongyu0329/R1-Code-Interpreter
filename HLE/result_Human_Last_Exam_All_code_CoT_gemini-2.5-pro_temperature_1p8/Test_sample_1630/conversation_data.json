    "A fixed point of a function $h(x)$ is a real number $x$ such that $h(x) = x$. We are asked to find the maximum number of fixed points for the function $h(x) = f(g(x))$, where $f$ and $g$ are polynomials of degree 3.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  **Determine the degree of the composite function.**\n    If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $m$ and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$, then their composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $m \\times n$.\n    In this case, both $f$ and $g$ have degree 3. Therefore, $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the fixed-point problem as a root-finding problem.**\n    The fixed points of $h(x)$ are the solutions to the equation $h(x) = x$. This is equivalent to finding the roots of the polynomial $P(x) = h(x) - x$.\n    Since $h(x)$ has degree 9, $P(x) = h(x) - x$ is also a polynomial of degree 9.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.**\n    A polynomial of degree $d$ can have at most $d$ real roots. Since $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9, it can have at most 9 real roots. This means $h(x)$ can have at most 9 fixed points.\n\n4.  **Analyze the constraints on the derivatives.**\n    We are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$. This means that both $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing functions.\n    Let's find the derivative of the composite function $h(x)$ using the chain rule:\n    $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$\n    Since $f'(y) > 0$ for any input $y$ (including $y=g(x)$) and $g'(x) > 0$, their product $h'(x)$ must also be positive for all $x$. This means $h(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\n5.  **Investigate if 9 fixed points are achievable.**\n    We need to determine if it is possible to construct polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that satisfy the given conditions and result in $h(x)=f(g(x))$ having 9 fixed points.\n    For $P(x) = h(x) - x$ to have 9 distinct real roots, by Rolle's Theorem, its derivative $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$ must have 8 distinct real roots. This implies the graph of $h'(x)$ must intersect the line $y=1$ at 8 different points.\n    $h'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. A polynomial of degree 8 with a positive leading coefficient starts at $y=\\infty$ for $x \\to -\\infty$ and ends at $y=\\infty$ for $x \\to \\infty$. Such a polynomial can intersect a horizontal line like $y=1$ up to 8 times, provided its local minima are low enough. Since we established that $h'(x)>0$, the wiggles of the graph must remain above the x-axis. There is no obvious contradiction that prevents $h'(x)=1$ from having 8 roots while $h'(x)>0$.\n\n6.  **Construct a demonstration.**\n    It has been proven that for any integers $m, n \\ge 2$, it is possible to find strictly increasing real polynomials $f$ and $g$ of degrees $m$ and $n$ respectively, such that their composition has $mn$ fixed points. For our case, $m=n=3$, so 9 fixed points are achievable.\n    Instead of constructing the specific $f$ and $g$, which is very complex, we can demonstrate that a strictly increasing polynomial $H(x)$ of degree 9 can indeed have 9 fixed points. We can construct such a polynomial and find its fixed points.\n\n    Let's choose a degree 9 polynomial that has 9 distinct real roots, for example, at $-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.\n    $P_9(x) = x(x^2-1)(x^2-4)(x^2-9)(x^2-16)$\n    Let's define our function $H(x)$ as $H(x) = C \\cdot P_9(x) + x$, where $C$ is a constant. The fixed points of $H(x)$ are the roots of $H(x) - x = 0$, which are the roots of $C \\cdot P_9(x) = 0$. These are precisely the 9 roots we defined for $P_9(x)$.\n\n    Now, we must ensure $H(x)$ is strictly increasing, i.e., $H'(x) > 0$ for all $x$.\n    $H'(x) = C \\cdot P_9'(x) + 1$.\n    The polynomial $P_9'(x)$ will have some minimum value, let's call it $m_{min}$. Since $P_9(x)$ has 9 roots, it has 8 local extrema, so $P_9'(x)$ will have negative values. Its minimum value $m_{min}$ will be negative.\n    To make $H'(x) > 0$, we need $C \\cdot P_9'(x) + 1 > 0$. If we choose a positive $C$ that is small enough, this condition will be satisfied. Specifically, if we pick $C < -1/m_{min}$, then $C \\cdot m_{min} > -1$, and $H'(x) = C \\cdot P_9'(x) + 1 > C \\cdot m_{min} + 1 > 0$.\n\n    The following Python code implements this construction, demonstrating that 9 fixed points are achievable.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates that a strictly increasing polynomial of degree 9\n    can have 9 fixed points.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
