    "This is a classic Chinese character riddle! Let's break it down component by component to find the answer.\n\nThe riddle has three parts:\n1.  **A wooden stick**: This clearly points to the radical `木` (mù), which means \"wood\" or \"tree\".\n2.  **hanging a square box**: This describes the radical `目` (mù), which means \"eye\". It looks like a square/rectangular box. In the final character, it is \"hanging\" next to the wooden stick.\n3.  **a ladder placed in the center**: This is the most clever part. It describes the *inside* of the \"box\" (`目`). The two horizontal strokes inside the `目` radical resemble the rungs of a ladder.\n\nBy combining these visual clues, we assemble the character. The code below will walk through this logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Chinese character riddle by breaking it down into its components.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Let's break down the riddle to form the Chinese character:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # 1. \"A wooden stick\"\n    part1_char = \"木\"\n    part1_desc = \"A wooden stick\"\n    print(f\"'{part1_desc}' represents the 'wood' radical: {part1_char}\")\n\n    # 2. \"hanging a square box\" and \"a ladder placed in the center\"\n    part2_char = \"目\"\n    part2_desc = \"hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center\"\n    print(f\"'{part2_desc}' describes the 'eye' radical: {part2_char}\")\n    print(f\"  - It looks like a 'box' hanging next to the wooden stick.\")\n    print(f\"  - The two strokes inside look like a 'ladder'.\")\n\n    # 3.
