    Analyzes the arboricity of a subsampled graph based on the subsampling exponent c.
    
    The arboricity of a graph is upper-bounded by its average degree. We analyze the expected average
    degree of a subsampled subgraph to understand its density.
    
    Consider a d-regular component H in the original graph G. For any vertex u in H, its degree
    d_u in G is d. The probability of keeping u is p_u = 1 / d^c.
    
    Let H' be the induced subgraph of G' on the vertices of H that were kept.
    Let s be the number of vertices in H, and m be the number of edges. m = s*d/2.

    The expected number of vertices in H' is:
    E[s'] = s * p_u = s / d^c

    An edge (u, v) from H survives if both u and v are kept. This happens with probability p_u * p_v = (1/d^c)^2 = 1/d^(2c).
    The expected number of edges in H' is:
    E[m'] = m * (1/d^(2c)) = (s*d/2) / d^(2c) = s / (2 * d^(2c-1))

    The ratio of expected edges to expected vertices gives a proxy for the graph's density:
    Ratio = E[m'] / E[s'] = (s / (2 * d^(2c-1))) / (s / d^c) = d^c / (2 * d^(2c-1)) = 1 / (2 * d^(c-1))
    
    The expected average degree is twice this ratio, i.e., 1 / d^(c-1).

    # original graph (represented by d), the graph becomes sparse.
