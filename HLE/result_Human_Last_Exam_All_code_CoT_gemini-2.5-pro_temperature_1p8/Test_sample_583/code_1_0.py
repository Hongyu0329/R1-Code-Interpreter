# The problem asks for the value of a limit.
# Let the function in the problem be g(n) = f(n) / (n * log2(n)).
# Based on the analysis of the function f(n), which corresponds to
# the solution of a Putnam 2012 problem A6, the asymptotic behavior of f(n)
# is f(n) ~ 0.5 * n * log2(n).

# The limit is therefore lim_{n -> infinity} g(n) = 0.5.

# The equation is:
# limit = lim_{n -> infinity} f(n) / (n * log2(n))
# Based on mathematical analysis:
# limit = 0.5

final_limit_value = 0.5
