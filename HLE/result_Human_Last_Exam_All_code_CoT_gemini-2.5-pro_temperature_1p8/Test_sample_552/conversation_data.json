    "I will answer your question by providing a Python script that prints the name of the scientist whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Store the name of the scientist in a variable.\n2.  Use the `print()` function to output a sentence that directly answers the user's question, incorporating the variable.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to know whose lectures Einstein cited in his 1905 Brownian motion paper.\n# This script stores the answer and prints it in a full sentence.\n\n# Storing the scientist's name in a variable.\nscientist_name = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n\n# Printing the answer in a clear, formatted sentence.\nprint(f\"In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, Albert Einstein cited the lectures of {scientist_name}.\")\n\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
