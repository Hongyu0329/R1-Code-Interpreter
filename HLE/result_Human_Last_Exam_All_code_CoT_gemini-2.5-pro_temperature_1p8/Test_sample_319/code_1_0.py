    # A "special point" is a point p where the normal vectors of all planes passing through it are not collinear.
    # For the number of special points to be finite, they must be vertices of the hyperplane arrangement.
    # A vertex is a 0-dimensional intersection of planes. In d=10, this requires intersecting at least 10 planes
    # whose normal vectors are linearly independent.
    # A set of 10 linearly independent vectors in R^10 cannot be collinear, so every vertex is a special point.
    
    # The problem thus asks for the maximum number of vertices in an arrangement of N planes.
    # This maximum number is given by the binomial coefficient "N choose d".
    # Number of vertices = Binomial(N, d) = N! / (d! * (N-d)!)
    # For large N, this is a polynomial in N of degree d.
    
    # We are looking for c in the expression O(N^c).
    # The number of points grows as N^d / d!.
    # So, the order of growth is O(N^d).
    c = d

    # The final equation for the number of points K is K = O(N^c).
    # Here are the numbers leading to the answer:
