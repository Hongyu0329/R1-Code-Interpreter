def solve_topology_complement_problem():

    This function provides the solution to finding the smallest possible
    number of complements for a given type of topology.

    The problem is set in the context of general topology on a set X with
    cardinality of the continuum, c. We are looking for the minimum
    number of complements a non-trivial, non-discrete topology T on X can have.

    A complement S to T must satisfy:
    1. T U S generates the discrete topology.
    2. T intersect S is the trivial topology.

    # The solution to this problem is a number derived from established theorems
    # in general topology, rather than a calculation.

    # According to a theorem by A. K. Steiner (1966), any topology on a set |X| > 2
    # that is not trivial or discrete cannot have exactly one complement.
    # This means our topology T must have 0 complements or at least 2 complements.
    possible_counts = "0 or >= 2"

    # The question then becomes whether a non-trivial, non-discrete topology
    # can have 0 complements. Such a topology is called "complement-free".
    # For any uncountable set X (including one of cardinality c), it has been
    # proven that complement-free topologies exist (K. Matolcsy, 1993).

    # Since we can choose a topology T that has 0 complements, and the number
    # of complements must be a non-negative integer, the smallest possible
    # number is 0.

    # We formulate this result as a simple equation for output purposes.
    # The final answer is represented by the variable 'result'.
