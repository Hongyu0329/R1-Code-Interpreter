The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of an intersection of countably many open dense subsets of P(X).

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1.  **Applicability of the Baire Category Theorem**: The phrase 'intersection of countably many open dense subsets' strongly suggests the use of the Baire Category Theorem. This theorem states that in a completely metrizable space, such an intersection is a dense set.

2.  **The Space P(X) is Completely Metrizable**:
    - The space X is a compact metric space, so it is a complete metric space.
    - The hyperspace 2^X of non-empty closed subsets of X, equipped with the Hausdorff metric, is also a complete metric space.
    - The space P(X) consists of sets that are the union of a non-trivial convergent sequence and its limit point. This condition is equivalent to the set being infinite and having exactly one limit point.
    - The properties 'being infinite' and 'having exactly one limit point' each define G-delta subsets (a countable intersection of open sets) in 2^X.
    - P(X), as the intersection of these G-delta sets, is itself a G-delta subset of the complete metric space 2^X.
    - A fundamental result in topology (Alexandroff's Theorem) states that a G-delta subset of a complete metric space is completely metrizable.

3.  **The Intersection is a Dense Set**: Since P(X) is completely metrizable, the Baire Category Theorem applies. Therefore, any countable intersection of open dense subsets of P(X) is itself a dense subset of P(X).

4.  **Cardinality of the Dense Set**:
    - A dense subset of a T1 space without isolated points must have a cardinality equal to or greater than that of the space itself.
    - The space P(X) has no isolated points. For any element A in P(X), we can construct another distinct element B in P(X) that is arbitrarily close to A by slightly perturbing one of the points in the sequence defining A.
    - Therefore, the cardinality of the dense intersection is the same as the cardinality of P(X).

5.  **Cardinality of P(X)**:
    - The space X is a compact, connected metric space with more than one point. Any such space is a non-degenerate continuum, and it can be shown that its cardinality must be c, the cardinality of the continuum.
    - We have card(X) = c = 2^aleph_0.
    - An element of P(X) is a specific kind of countable subset of X. The total number of countable subsets of X is given by card(X)^aleph_0.
    - card(P(X)) <= card(X)^aleph_0 = c^aleph_0 = (2^aleph_0)^aleph_0 = 2^(aleph_0 * aleph_0) = 2^aleph_0 = c.
    - A simple construction shows that card(P(X)) >= c. Thus, card(P(X)) = c.

6.  **Conclusion**: The smallest possible cardinality of the intersection is c, the cardinality of the continuum. This value is independent of the specific choice of X, as any X satisfying the conditions will have cardinality c.
