The genomic mutation rate can be viewed as an evolutionary trait. There are competing evolutionary pressures acting on this rate:

1.  Downward Pressure: A high mutation rate introduces many deleterious mutations, reducing the fitness of offspring. This creates strong selective pressure to lower the rate.

2.  Counteracting Forces:
    a) The biochemical machinery for perfect DNA replication and repair is energetically expensive, creating a metabolic cost for extremely low mutation rates.
    b) In changing environments, mutations can be beneficial, and a non-zero mutation rate provides the raw material for adaptation.
    c) Genetic drift imposes a fundamental limit on how effective selection can be. When the fitness advantage of a slightly lower mutation rate is very small, it can be overwhelmed by random drift, preventing the rate from evolving to zero (the 'drift-barrier' hypothesis).

The observed, approximately constant, mutation rate is the result of these conflicting forces reaching an equilibrium. The overarching process that drives the trait to this equilibrium point, by balancing all the associated costs and benefits, is natural selection. Therefore, the mutation rate is maintained at a level that represents a fitness optimum for the organism in its evolutionary context.
