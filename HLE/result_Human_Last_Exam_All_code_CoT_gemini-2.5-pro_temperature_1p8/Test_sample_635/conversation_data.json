    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to calculate the left coprime factorization, followed by the Python code to perform and verify the calculation.\n\n### Plan to find the factorization:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal**: The objective is to find polynomial matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ for the given transfer function $H(s)$ that satisfy the relationship $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$. These matrices must also be \"left coprime,\" which means the combined matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ must have full row rank for all values of $s$.\n\n2.  **Set up the equation**: We need to find a polynomial matrix $D(s)$ that clears the denominators of $H(s)$ when multiplied, resulting in another polynomial matrix $N(s)$. The core equation is $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$. Let $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$.\n    The product is:\n    $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11} \\\\ d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21} \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n3.  **Solve for Matrix Elements**: We need to select polynomial functions for $d_{ij}(s)$ that make all elements of $N(s)$ polynomials.\n    *   **First Row**: Let's work on the first row of $D(s)$. We need $\\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{s^2-1}$ to be a polynomial. A simple way to achieve this is to choose $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{12}(s)$ such that the numerator becomes a multiple of $s^2-1$. Let's try making the numerator equal to $s^2-1$.\n        If we pick $d_{11}(s)=1$, the condition is $(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s) = s^2-1$.\n        Solving for $d_{12}(s)$, we get $s^2-2s+1 + 2d_{12}(s) = s^2-1$, which simplifies to $2d_{12}(s) = 2s-2$, so $d_{12}(s) = s-1$.\n        This gives the first row of $D(s)$ as $[1, s-1]$ and the first row of $N(s)$ as $[1, 1]$.\n\n    *   **Second Row**: For the second row, we need $\\frac{d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)}{s^2-1}$ to be a polynomial. Let's make a simple choice that is independent of the first row. We can set $d_{21}(s)=0$.\n        The condition becomes that $2d_{22}(s)$ must be divisible by $s^2-1$. The simplest non-zero polynomial for $d_{22}(s)$ is $s^2-1$.\n        This gives the second row of $D(s)$ as $[0, s^2-1]$. The second row of $N(s)$ is then $[\\frac{2(s^2-1)}{s^2-1}, 0] = [2, 0]$.\n\n4.  **Assemble and Verify**:\n    *   The resulting matrices are $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n    *   To verify that they are left coprime, we check the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$.\n        $[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n    *   The determinant of the submatrix formed by the first and third columns is $\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = 2$. Since this is a non-zero constant, the full matrix has rank 2 for all values of $s$, which confirms that the factorization is coprime.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to define these matrices and verify the factorization.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_left_coprime_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and verifies a left coprime factorization for the given transfer function H(s).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable s\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Based on our derivation, we propose the following matrices D(s) and N(s)\n    D = sympy.Matrix([[1, s - 1],\n                      [0, s**2 - 1]])\n\n    N = sympy.Matrix([[1, 1],\n                      [2, 0]])\n\n    # The original transfer function H(s)\n    H = sympy.Matrix([[(s - 1) / (s + 1), 1],\n                      [2 / (s**2 - 1), 0]])\n\n    print(\"Calculating a left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) ...\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Print the final answer in the required format ---\n    print(\"The resulting matrices are:\")\n    print(\"D(s) =\")\n    print(f\"[[ {D[0,0]} , {D[0,1]} ],\")\n    print(f\" [ {D[1,0]} , {D[1,1]} ]]\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nN(s) =\")\n    print(f\"[[ {N[0,0]} , {N[0,1]} ],\")\n    print(f\" [ {N[1,0]} , {N[1,1]} ]]\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*40 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # --- Verification Steps ---\n    print(\"Verification steps:\")\n    \n    # 1.
