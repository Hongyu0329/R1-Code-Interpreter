    This function solves the three parts of the mathematical problem and prints the solution.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    
    Part (a): If g^2 . 1_R = 1_R and (x . 1_R)^2 is in Z(R), is x^j . r symmetric for j >= 2?
    The term 'symmetric' is ambiguous. Assuming a reasonable interpretation (e.g., yielding a symmetric matrix in a matrix representation of R),
    we can construct a counterexample. For j=3, the expression for x^3 . r does not appear to be symmetric in general. For instance, in R = M_2(k),
    if we choose x . 1_R to be a non-scalar symmetric matrix whose square is scalar (e.g., a Pauli matrix), and g's action to be conjugation
    by another suitable matrix, x^2 . r can be shown to be a symmetric matrix, but x^3 . r is not. Therefore, the statement is not always true.
    The answer is No.

    Part (b): State the value of x^2 a . 1_R when g . 1_R = 0 and q = -1.
    The formula for the action of x^j a on r is given. For j=2, it involves terms for k=0, 1, 2.
    When q=-1, the q-binomial coefficient C(2,1)_{-1} is 0, so the k=1 term vanishes.
    The expression becomes x^2 a . 1_R = (x . 1_R)^2(a . 1_R) - (g^2 a . 1_R)(x . 1_R)^2.
    From the properties of the action, one can derive that (g . r)(x . 1_R) = 0 for all r in R.
    This implies (g^2 a . 1_R)(x . 1_R)^2 = ((g^2 a . 1_R)(x . 1_R))(x . 1_R) = 0.
    Thus, the second term vanishes, leaving (x . 1_R)^2(a . 1_R).

    Part (c): Given g . 1_R = 0 and w = x . 1_R is in Z(R), express x^3 a . 1_R.
    As in part (b), the condition g . 1_R = 0 implies (g . r)w = 0 for all r in R.
    Since w is central, w(g . r) = 0 for all r in R.
    This means for k>=1, w(g^k . r) = 0.
    The expression for x^3 a . 1_R is a sum over k from 0 to 3. Since w is central, we have:
    x^3 a . 1_R = sum_{k=0 to 3} C_k w^3 (g^k a . 1_R).
    For k>=1, the term w^3(g^k a . 1_R) = w^2 * w(g^k a . 1_R) = w^2 * 0 = 0.
    So only the k=0 term survives, which is w^3(a . 1_R).
