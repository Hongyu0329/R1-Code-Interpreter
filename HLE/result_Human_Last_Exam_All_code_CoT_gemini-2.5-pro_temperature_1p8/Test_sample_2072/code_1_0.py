def solve_phi(n):
    """
    Calculates the value of phi(n) based on the derived formula.

    The derivation shows that the problem simplifies significantly. The integrals
    in u and v must be equal for the manifold to be non-empty, making u proportional
    to the vector of ones. The complex operators lead to the calculation of
    phi(n) = exp(Tr(H)), where H is a projection of a specific matrix Y = X^-1.
    The trace of H was found to be Tr(H) = 2*(n+1)*(n-1)^2 / n.
    This function implements this final formula.
    
    Args:
        n (int): An integer greater than or equal to 5.
    
    Returns:
        None. Prints the result.
