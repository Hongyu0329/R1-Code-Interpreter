    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, I'll establish a coordinate system for the two cubes. Let's place the first cube, Cube A, in the first octant with one corner at the origin (0,0,0) and the opposite corner at (1,1,1). This means Cube A occupies the space where `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\nNext, I will interpret the phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". The main diagonal of this cube connects (0,0,0) to (1,1,1). A shift \"along\" this diagonal by a value of 1/2 is best interpreted as a displacement vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). Therefore, the second cube, Cube B, occupies the space where `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`, and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`.\n\nThen, I'll determine the region of their intersection. A point (x,y,z) is in the intersection if it's in both Cube A and Cube B. By looking at the ranges for each axis, we can find the overlapping region:\n-   For the x-axis: The overlap of `[0, 1]` and `[0.5, 1.5]` is `[0.5, 1]`.\n-   For the y-axis: The overlap of `[0, 1]` and `[0.5, 1.5]` is `[0.5, 1]`.\n-   For the z-axis: The overlap of `[0, 1]` and `[0.5, 1.5]` is `[0.5, 1]`.\n\nThe intersection forms a smaller cube. The side length of this intersection cube is `1 - 0.5 = 0.5`.\n\nFinally, I will provide a Python script that calculates the volume of this intersection cube, which is the cube of its side length, and prints out the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cube_intersection():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the volume of the intersection of two cubes shifted along the main diagonal.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Side length of the original cubes\n    original_side = 1.0\n\n    # The shift along each axis (x, y, and z)\n    shift = 0.5\n\n    # The intersection of the two cubes forms a new, smaller cube.\n    # We calculate the side length of this intersection cube.\n    # For any axis, the first cube is in the range [0, 1].\n    # The second cube is in the range [0.5, 1.5].\n    # The intersection is the range [0.5, 1], which has a length of 1 - 0.5.\n    intersection_side_length = original_side - shift\n\n    # The volume is the side length of the intersection cubed.\n    volume = intersection_side_length ** 3\n\n    print(f\"The original side length of the cubes is {original_side}.\")\n    print(f\"The shift along the main diagonal is equivalent to a shift of {shift} along each axis.\")\n    print(f\"The side length of the resulting intersection cube is the original side length minus the shift.\")\n    print(f\"Side length of intersection = {original_side} - {shift} = {intersection_side_length}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe volume of the intersection is calculated as (side length)^3.\")\n    print(f\"Volume = {intersection_side_length} * {intersection_side_length} * {intersection_side_length} = {volume}\")\n\nsolve_cube_intersection()\n```\n<<<0.125>>>"
