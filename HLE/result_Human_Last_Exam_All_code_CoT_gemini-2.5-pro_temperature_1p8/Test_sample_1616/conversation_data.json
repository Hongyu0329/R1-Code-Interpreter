    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each word to determine which has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understanding Trisyllabic Laxing:**\nTrisyllabic laxing is a historical sound change in English where a long vowel in a stressed syllable becomes short if it is followed by two or more syllables (i.e., when it's in the antepenultimate syllable or earlier).\n\n**2. Word-by-Word Analysis:**\n*   **southern**: Derived from `south`. The vowel sound in `south` is a long diphthong (/aʊ/), but in `southern` it becomes a short vowel (/ʌ/). This is a form of vowel shortening or laxing that follows the rule.\n*   **derivative**: Derived from `derive`. The vowel sound in `derive` is a long diphthong (/aɪ/), but in `derivative`, the stressed vowel becomes short (/ɪ/). The stressed syllable (`-riv-`) is followed by two syllables, making this a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **serenity**: Derived from `serene`. The vowel sound in `serene` is long (/iː/), but in `serenity`, the stressed vowel becomes short (/ɛ/). The stressed syllable (`-ren-`) is followed by two syllables, which is another classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **pleasant**: Derived from `please`. The vowel sound in `please` is long (/iː/), but in `pleasant`, it becomes short (/ɛ/). Although this is vowel laxing, it happens in a two-syllable word, so it is technically pre-cluster shortening, not trisyllabic laxing. However, the vowel was originally long and became short.\n*   **gratitude**: Derived from the Latin root `grātus`, which had a long vowel. In the English word `gratitude`, the first stressed syllable has a short vowel (/æ/). The stressed syllable (`gra-`) is followed by two more syllables, fitting the pattern.\n*   **shadow**: This word comes from Old English `sceadu`. The first vowel (`æ`) in `sceadu` was already short. Since the vowel was never long to begin with, it could not undergo laxing (shortening).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll words except `shadow` are derived from a root with a long vowel that was shortened in the current form. `Shadow` is the only word whose stressed vowel was already short in its oldest form and thus never underwent the process of laxing.\n\n```python\ndef find_non_laxed_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of words to find the one that has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n    Trisyllabic laxing is a rule where a long vowel becomes short when it's in the\n    third-to-last syllable (or earlier) of a word.\n\n    The function will print the analysis for each word and then the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    words = {\n        \"southern\": {\n            \"base_word\": \"south\",\n            \"base_vowel\": \"/aʊ/ (long diphthong)\",\n            \"derived_vowel\": \"/ʌ/ (short)\",\n            \"analysis\": \"LAXED.
