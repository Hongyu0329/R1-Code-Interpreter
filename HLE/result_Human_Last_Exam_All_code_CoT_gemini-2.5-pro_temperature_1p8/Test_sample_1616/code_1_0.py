    Analyzes a list of words to find the one that has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.

    Trisyllabic laxing is a rule where a long vowel becomes short when it's in the
    third-to-last syllable (or earlier) of a word.

    The function will print the analysis for each word and then the final answer.
