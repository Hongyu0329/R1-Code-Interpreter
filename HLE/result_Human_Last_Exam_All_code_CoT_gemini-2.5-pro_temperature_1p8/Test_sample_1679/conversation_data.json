    "To identify the first Best Picture winner featuring a Luxor Obelisk, I will follow these steps:\n1.  First, I'll identify the two Luxor Obelisks. One is in Luxor, Egypt, and the other is in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n2.  Next, I'll review the list of Academy Award for Best Picture winners in chronological order.\n3.  I will check the setting and key scenes of each winning film to determine if either of the obelisks is shown.\n4.  The first film on the list that includes a depiction of an obelisk will be the answer.\n\nBased on this process, the film *Casablanca* is the earliest winner to meet the criteria. It won the award for the film year 1943. During a flashback sequence showing Rick and Ilsa's time together in Paris, the Luxor Obelisk at the Place de la Concorde is briefly visible as part of a montage of famous Parisian landmarks. Later films, like *An American in Paris* (1951) or *Gigi* (1958), also feature the obelisk, but *Casablanca* is the first winner to do so.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to display this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_winner_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the first Academy Award Best Picture winner\n    to feature a Luxor Obelisk on-screen and prints the details.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Information about the film and award\n    movie_title = \"Casablanca\"\n    award_year = 1943\n    academy_award_ceremony = 16 # Held in 1944\n    obelisk_location = \"Place de la Concorde, Paris\"\n\n    # Constructing the output strings\n    line1 = f\"The first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk was '{movie_title}'.\"\n    line2 = f\"The film won for the year {award_year} at the {academy_award_ceremony}th Academy Awards.\"\n    line3 = f\"It depicts the Luxor Obelisk located in the {obelisk_location} during a flashback sequence.\"\n\n    # Print the answer\n    print(line1)\n    print(line2)\n    print(line3)\n    \n    # As requested, outputting the specific numbers from the answer\n    print(\"\\nRelevant numbers from the answer:\")\n    print(f\"Film Year: {award_year}\")\n    print(f\"Academy Awards Ceremony: {academy_award_ceremony}\")\n\nfind_first_winner_with_obelisk()\n```\n<<<Casablanca>>>"
