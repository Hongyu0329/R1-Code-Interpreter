# This script represents the test proposed in option E.
# Chuang Tzu would need to perform this test in both the "man" reality
# and the "butterfly" reality. An objectively consistent reality
# should always yield the same, correct result. A failure of this
# simple mathematical rule would be strong evidence of a dream state.

# Define the numbers for the calculation
num1 = 2
num2 = 2

# Perform the calculation
result = num1 + num2

# Print the full equation to verify the logical and mathematical consistency.
# The instruction is to output each number in the final equation.
print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {result}")
