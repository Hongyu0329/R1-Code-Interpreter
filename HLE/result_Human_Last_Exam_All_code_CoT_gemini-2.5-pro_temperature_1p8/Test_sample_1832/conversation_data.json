    "To determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Metric:** The geometry of spacetime outside a spherically symmetric mass $M$ is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal with the following non-zero components:\n    *   $g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{r}\\right)$\n    *   $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n    *   $g_{22} = r^2$\n    *   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula:** The Christoffel symbols are calculated from the derivatives of the metric tensor using the formula:\n    $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n    where $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is the inverse metric tensor.\n\n3.  **Analyze Dependencies:** The metric components depend only on $r$ (index 1) and $\\theta$ (index 2). Any derivative with respect to $t$ (index 0) or $\\phi$ (index 3) will be zero. This observation significantly reduces the number of potential non-zero symbols.\n\n4.  **Systematic Calculation:** While a manual calculation is possible, it is lengthy and prone to error, as there are 40 unique components to check ($\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$ is symmetric in $\\mu$ and $\\nu$). A more robust method is to use a symbolic mathematics library to perform the calculation.\n\nI will provide a Python script that uses the `sympy` library to define the Schwarzschild metric, calculate all 40 unique Christoffel symbols symbolically, and then count how many of them are non-zero. The script will also print out the expressions for these non-zero symbols.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef count_schwarzschild_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and counts the non-zero Christoffel symbols\n    for the Schwarzschild metric.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbolic coordinates and constants\n    # Using 'th' for theta and 'ph' for phi to avoid conflicts\n    t, r, th, ph = sympy.symbols('t r theta phi')\n    G, M = sympy.symbols('G M', positive=True)\n    coords = [t, r, th, ph]\n    coord_names = ['t', 'r', 'theta', 'phi']\n\n    # Define the function f(r) for the Schwarzschild metric\n    f = 1 - 2 * G * M / r\n\n    # Define the Schwarzschild metric tensor g_munu (a 4x4 matrix)\n    g_munu = sympy.Matrix([\n        [-f, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1/f, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, r**2, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, r**2 * sympy.sin(th)**2]\n    ])\n\n    # Calculate the inverse metric tensor g^munu\n    g_inv = g_munu.inv()\n\n    # Calculate the partial derivatives of the metric tensor\n    # g_diff[k][i][j] will store dg_{ij}/dx^k\n    g_diff = [[[0 for _ in range(4)] for _ in range(4)] for _ in range(4)]\n    for k in range(4):\n        for i in range(4):\n            for j in range(4):\n                g_diff[k][i][j] = sympy.diff(g_munu[i, j], coords[k])\n\n    # Dictionary to store non-zero Christoffel symbols to avoid duplicates\n    non_zero_symbols = {}\n\n    # Calculate the Christoffel symbols Gamma^rho_mu_nu\n    # The formula is: 1/2 * g^rho_sigma * (d_nu(g_sigma_mu) + d_mu(g_sigma_nu) - d_sigma(g_mu_nu))\n    for rho in range(4):\n        for mu in range(4):\n            # Due to symmetry in lower indices (mu, nu), we only need to calculate for mu <= nu\n            for nu in range(mu, 4):\n                term = 0\n                for sigma in range(4):\n                    term += g_inv[rho, sigma] * (g_diff[nu][sigma][mu] + g_diff[mu][sigma][nu] - g_diff[sigma][mu][nu])\n                \n                # Simplify the final expression\n                christoffel_symbol = sympy.simplify(0.5 * term)\n\n                if christoffel_symbol != 0:\n                    symbol_str = f\"Î“^{coord_names[rho]}_{coord_names[mu]}{coord_names[nu]}\"\n                    equation = f\"{symbol_str} = {christoffel_symbol}\"\n                    non_zero_symbols[symbol_str] = equation\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(\"The unique non-zero Christoffel symbols and their values are:\\n\")\n    for symbol, equation in sorted(non_zero_symbols.items()):\n        print(equation)\n    \n    count = len(non_zero_symbols)\n    print(f\"\\nIn total, there are {count} unique non-zero Christoffel symbols for this metric.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    count_schwarzschild_christoffel_symbols()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
