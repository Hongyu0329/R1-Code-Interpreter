    "This is a classic riddle that relies on a pun between English and Russian. Here's my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  Identify the most prominent \"wide boulevard\" in Vienna. This is the Ringstrasse, which translates to \"Ring Boulevard.\"\n2.  Translate the key word \"ring\" into Russian. The Russian word for \"ring\" is \"кольцо\" (pronounced \"kol'tso\").\n3.  Find an English poet whose surname sounds phonetically similar to the Russian word \"кольцо\" (kol'tso).\n4.  The surname \"Coleridge\" is a very close phonetic match. Samuel Taylor Coleridge was a famous English poet.\n5.  I will write a Python script to print this explanation and the final answer.\n\n```python\n# The riddle describes the wide boulevards of Vienna.\n# The most famous of these is the Ringstrasse, which means 'Ring Boulevard'.\nboulevard_description = \"Ring\"\n\n# In the Russian translation, the word 'Ring' would be 'кольцо' (kol'tso).\nrussian_word = \"кольцо (kol'tso)\"\n\n# This Russian word sounds phonetically similar to the surname of a famous English poet.\npoet_surname = \"Coleridge\"\n\nprint(f\"The key is the famous Vienna 'Ring' Boulevard.\")\nprint(f\"The Russian word for 'Ring' is '{russian_word}'.\")\nprint(f\"This sounds like the surname of the English poet: {poet_surname}.\")\n<<<Coleridge>>>\n```"
