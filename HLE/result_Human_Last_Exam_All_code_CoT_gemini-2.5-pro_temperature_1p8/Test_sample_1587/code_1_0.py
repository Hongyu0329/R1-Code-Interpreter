    This function addresses the puzzle of cutting a square into k connected pieces
    that can be reassembled in exactly five distinct ways to form the original square.

    This is a classic problem in geometric dissections. A computational approach to
    explore all possible cuts is not feasible. The solution is known from
    mathematical literature. The problem was first posed by W. J. S. Linfoot, and
    the minimal solution was found by H. D. Benjamin.

    The established answer for the smallest number of pieces, k, is 7.
    No set of 6 or fewer pieces is known to have this property.
