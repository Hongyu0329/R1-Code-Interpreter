#
# Step 1: Analyze Kenneth Burke's key distinction between "motion" and "action."
#
# - Motion: Refers to the non-symbolic, biological, and physical realm.
#   It is the world of cause and effect, of things simply being what they are.
#   Crucially, for Burke, there is no "negative" in nature. A tree is a tree;
#   it is not "not a chair." This realm is sensory.
#
# - Action: Refers to the symbolic realm of human doings. It involves motive,
#   intention, choice, and meaning. Action is impossible without language,
#   and the cornerstone of language for Burke is its invention of "the negative."
#

#
# Step 2: Situate the "Tribal No" within this framework.
#
# - The "Tribal No" represents the set of prohibitions, commandments, and taboos
#   that form the basis of social order and morality (e.g., "Thou shalt not...").
#
# - These prohibitions are inherently negative. They are linguistic constructs
#   that separate what is permitted from what is forbidden.
#
# - Since the "Tribal No" depends entirely on the concept of the negative, which
#   is a product of language, it cannot belong to the realm of "motion."
#   It must belong to the realm of symbolic "action." This eliminates
#   answer choices B, C, and D.
#

#
# Step 3: Differentiate between the remaining justifications for "Action."
#
# - We are left with two choices:
#   A. Action; it is imaginal.
#   E. Action; it is rational.
#
# - Burke frames human symbol-use in a dramatistic way, emphasizing story,
#   myth, and identification. The "Tribal No" is not merely a set of
#   rational, logical deductions. It is rooted in the collective imagination
#   of a cultureâ€”its founding myths, its moral tales, its vision of order
#   and chaos. This creative, story-based foundation is what gives the "No"
#   its power.
#
# - Therefore, describing the "Tribal No" as "imaginal" is a much better fit for
#   Burke's overall theory than describing it as purely "rational."
#

# Step 4: Final conclusion and output.
final_answer_choice = "A"

# The reasoning concludes that the "Tribal No" is a symbolic construct (Action)
# rooted in a culture's collective imagination.
print("The 'Tribal No,' as a set of linguistic prohibitions ('thou shalt not'), is fundamentally symbolic.")
print("According to Burke, the symbolic realm is the realm of Action, not Motion.")
print("This makes the answer a form of Action.")
print("The foundation of these prohibitions in myth, taboo, and social stories makes them 'imaginal' rather than purely 'rational'.")
