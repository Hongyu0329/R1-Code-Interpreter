    "No, structurally, polynucleotides (including homopolynucleotides) are not polysaccharides. They are fundamentally different types of biological macromolecules.\n\nI will use a Python script to print a clear, side-by-side comparison of their structural features to explain why.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define two Python dictionaries, one for `polynucleotides` and one for `polysaccharides`.\n2.  Each dictionary will store key structural characteristics: the type of monomer, the components of that monomer, the bond that links the monomers, and the composition of the polymer's backbone.\n3.  The script will then print a direct \"No\" to the user's question.\n4.  Finally, it will iterate through the keys in the dictionaries and print a formatted table that clearly contrasts the features of polynucleotides and polysaccharides, highlighting their distinct nature.\n\n```python\ndef explain_structural_differences():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a detailed explanation and comparison between polynucleotides and polysaccharides.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the structural properties for each macromolecule\n    polynucleotide = {\n        \"Category\": \"Polynucleotide (e.g., DNA, RNA)\",\n        \"Monomer\": \"Nucleotide\",\n        \"Monomer Components\": \"Phosphate Group + Pentose Sugar (Deoxyribose/Ribose) + Nitrogenous Base\",\n        \"Backbone Bond\": \"Phosphodiester Bond\",\n        \"Key Elements\": \"C, H, O, N, P\"\n    }\n\n    polysaccharide = {\n        \"Category\": \"Polysaccharide (e.g., Starch, Cellulose)\",\n        \"Monomer\": \"Monosaccharide\",\n        \"Monomer Components\": \"Simple Sugar (e.g., Glucose)\",\n        \"Backbone Bond\": \"Glycosidic Bond\",\n        \"Key Elements\": \"C, H, O\"\n    }\n    \n    # Direct answer\n    print(\"No, polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is a detailed structural comparison:\\n\")\n    \n    # Print headers for the comparison table\n    print(f\"{'Feature':<22} | {'Polynucleotide':<70} | {'Polysaccharide':<50}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 150)\n    \n    # Iterate through the features and print the comparison\n    for key in polynucleotide:\n        # Align text for neat table-like output\n        feature = key + \":\"\n        poly_nuc_val = polynucleotide[key]\n        poly_sac_val = polysaccharide[key]\n        print(f\"{feature:<22} | {poly_nuc_val:<70} | {poly_sac_val:<50}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(\"While polynucleotides do contain a sugar component in their monomers, their overall structure is defined by the\")\n    print(\"phosphate groups and nitrogenous bases.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
