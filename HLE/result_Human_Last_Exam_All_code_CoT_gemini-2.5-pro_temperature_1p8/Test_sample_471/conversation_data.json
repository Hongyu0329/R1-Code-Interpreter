    "To find the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus, we can use a powerful result from differential topology called Morse theory.\n\n### My Thinking Steps:\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The question asks for the minimum number of points on a 2-torus ($T^2$) where the derivative of a smooth real-valued function $f$ vanishes.\n2.  **Invoke Morse Theory:** Morse theory connects the topology of a manifold to the critical points of functions defined on it. A key result is the **Morse inequalities**. For any smooth Morse function $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ on a compact manifold $M$, the number of critical points of a given type is related to the manifold's Betti numbers.\n3.  **Define Betti Numbers:** Betti numbers are topological invariants that, loosely speaking, count the number of \"holes\" of different dimensions in a space.\n    *   $b_0$: number of connected components.\n    *   $b_1$: number of one-dimensional \"circular\" holes.\n    *   $b_2$: number of two-dimensional \"voids\" or \"cavities\".\n4.  **Find Betti Numbers for the 2-Torus ($T^2$):**\n    *   A torus is one single connected piece, so $b_0(T^2) = 1$.\n    *   A torus has two independent circular cuts that can be made without disconnecting it (one along the \"tube\" and one around the \"hole\"), so $b_1(T^2) = 2$.\n    *   A torus is a closed surface that encloses one cavity, so $b_2(T^2) = 1$.\n5.  **Apply the Morse Inequalities:** The weak Morse inequalities state that for any Morse function, the number of critical points of index $k$, denoted $c_k$, must be greater than or equal to the $k$-th Betti number, $b_k$.\n    *   $c_0$ (number of local minima) $\\ge b_0 = 1$\n    *   $c_1$ (number of saddle points) $\\ge b_1 = 2$\n    *   $c_2$ (number of local maxima) $\\ge b_2 = 1$\n6.  **Calculate the Lower Bound:** The total number of critical points $C$ is the sum $c_0 + c_1 + c_2$. From the inequalities, we get a lower bound:\n    $C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2 \\ge b_0 + b_1 + b_2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n    This shows that any smooth function on the torus must have at least 4 critical points.\n7.  **Confirm the Minimum:** To show that 4 is the minimum, we must demonstrate that there exists at least one function that has exactly 4 critical points. The standard \"height function\" on a torus placed on its side in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is a perfect example. It has exactly one minimum (bottom point), one maximum (top point), and two saddle points (the innermost and outermost points on the central horizontal circle). This confirms that the minimum is achievable.\n8.  **Construct Python Code:** The code will formalize the calculation from step 6 and print the explanation and the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_critical_points_torus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus\n    based on Morse theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # According to Morse theory, the number of critical points of a smooth function\n    # on a compact manifold is bounded below by the sum of its Betti numbers.\n\n    # The Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2) are:\n    # b_0: Number of connected components\n    b0 = 1\n    # b_1: Number of 1-dimensional holes (the two fundamental cycles)\n    b1 = 2\n    # b_2: Number of 2-dimensional voids (the enclosed volume)\n    b2 = 1\n\n    # The weak Morse inequalities state that c_k >= b_k, where c_k is the number of\n    # critical points of index k. The total number of critical points C is sum(c_k).\n    # Therefore, the minimal number of critical points is at least the sum of the Betti numbers.\n    min_critical_points = b0 + b1 + b2\n\n    print(\"To find the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus, we use Morse theory.\")\n    print(\"The total number of critical points (C) for such a function is bounded below by the sum of the torus's Betti numbers (b_k).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe Betti numbers for the 2-torus are:\")\n    print(f\"b0 = {b0} (corresponds to local minima)\")\n    print(f\"b1 = {b1} (corresponds to saddle points)\")\n    print(f\"b2 = {b2} (corresponds to local maxima)\")\n    print(\"\\nThe lower bound for the number of critical points is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"C >= b0 + b1 + b2\")\n    print(f\"C >= {b0} + {b1} + {b2} = {min_critical_points}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis lower bound is achievable, for example, by a height function on a tilted torus.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the minimal number of critical points is {min_critical_points}.\")\n\nsolve_critical_points_torus()\n<<<4>>>\n```"
