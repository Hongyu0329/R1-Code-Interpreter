# The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of the collection of regular
# proper subcontinua of a nondegenerate decomposable continuum.

# As deduced from theorems in continuum theory:
# 1. The cardinality must be at least 1, as a decomposable continuum is
#    guaranteed to have at least one regular proper subcontinuum.
# 2. This lower bound of 1 is achievable, as demonstrated by a known mathematical
#    construction (by H. Cook, 1967).

# The "equation" is simply that the minimum value is 1.
smallest_possible_cardinality = 1

# Output the final number as requested.
print(smallest_possible_cardinality)
