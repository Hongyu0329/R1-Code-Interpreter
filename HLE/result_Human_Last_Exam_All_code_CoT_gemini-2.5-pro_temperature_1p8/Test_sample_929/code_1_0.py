This encourages the insect to move between many flowers on the same plant to get a full meal. This extensive movement is highly effective at maximizing pollination across the entire plant. This is highly beneficial.\n")

    print("Effect on Fitness: This pattern is very negative. It means many insects look at the plant but very few make contact. This leads to poor pollination.\n")
