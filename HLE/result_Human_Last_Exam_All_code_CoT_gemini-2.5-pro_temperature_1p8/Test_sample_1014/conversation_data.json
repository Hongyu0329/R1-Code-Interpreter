    "To find the largest prime divisor of 8139881, I will write a Python script that performs prime factorization on the number.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Start with the number `n = 8139881`.\n2.  Create an empty list to store the prime factors.\n3.  First, handle the smallest prime, 2. Repeatedly divide `n` by 2 and add 2 to the list of factors until it's no longer divisible.\n4.  Next, iterate through odd numbers (`d = 3, 5, 7, ...`) up to the square root of the remaining `n`. For each `d`, repeatedly divide `n` by `d` and add `d` to the list of factors until it's no longer divisible.\n5.  After the loop, if `n` is still greater than 1, the remaining value of `n` must also be a prime factor. Add it to the list.\n6.  Once all prime factors are found, the script will print the complete factorization in the form of an equation.\n7.  Finally, it will find and print the maximum value from the list of factors, which is the largest prime divisor.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the prime factorization of a given number and\n    determines its largest prime divisor.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 8139881\n    original_n = n\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle the factor 2\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n //= 2\n\n    # Handle odd factors starting from 3\n    d = 3\n    # We only need to check for factors up to the square root of n\n    while d * d <= n:\n        # If d is a factor, divide n by it repeatedly\n        while n % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            n //= d\n        d += 2\n\n    # If n is still greater than 1 after the loop, the remaining n is a prime factor.\n    if n > 1:\n        factors.append(n)\n\n    # Print the prime factorization equation\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of {original_n} is:\")\n    equation = \" * \".join(map(str, factors))\n    print(f\"{original_n} = {equation}\")\n\n    # Find the largest prime factor from the list\n    if factors:\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n        print(f\"\\nThe largest prime divisor of {original_n} is {largest_prime}.\")\n    else:\n        # This case is for n=1, which has no prime factors\n        print(f\"{original_n} has no prime factors.\")\n\nfind_largest_prime_divisor()\n```\n<<<2873>>>"
