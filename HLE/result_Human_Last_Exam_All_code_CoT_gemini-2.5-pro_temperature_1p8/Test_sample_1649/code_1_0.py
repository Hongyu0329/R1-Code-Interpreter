    This function demonstrates that the smallest possible size of the limit is 1.

    We construct a specific case that satisfies the problem's conditions and results
    in a limit of size 1.

    The setup:
    1.  Directed Poset (J): We use a finite subset of natural numbers {0, 1, 2, 3}
        with the usual ordering <=. This is a directed poset.
    2.  Functor (F): We define a functor F from J^op to Set.
        - F(j) = {0} for all j in J. Each set is non-empty.
        - For any j1 >= j2, there is a map F(j1) -> F(j2). Since both are {0},
          the only possible map is 0 -> 0. This map is surjective.

    The limit consists of all tuples (x0, x1, x2, x3) such that x_j is in F(j)
    and for all j1 >= j2, map(x_j1) = x_j2.
