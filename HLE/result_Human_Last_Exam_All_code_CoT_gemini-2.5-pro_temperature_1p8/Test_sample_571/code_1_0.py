# The problem asks for the values of a and b in the transformation
# q -> x^a
# z -> x^b * y
# This transformation connects the Ocneanu trace of a braid element in the Hecke algebra
# to the HOMFLY polynomial of the braid's closure.

# Let P(x, y) be the HOMFLY polynomial defined by the skein relation:
# x * P(L+) - x^(-1) * P(L-) = y * P(L0)

# The parameters for the Ocneanu trace are (q, z), where q is the parameter
# for the Hecke algebra H_n(q) and z is the trace parameter.

# The standard relationship between the algebraic parameters (q, z) and the
# HOMFLY polynomial variables (x, y) is given by:
# q = x^2
# z = y

# We need to match this to the given transformation format.
# 1. For q: The relationship q = x^2 matches the format q -> x^a for a=2.
# 2. For z: The relationship z = y can be written as z = 1 * y = x^0 * y.
#    This matches the format z -> x^b * y for b=0.

a = 2
b = 0

# We need to output each number in the final equation.
# The question asks for the values of a and b.
# Let's print the values found.
print(f"The value for a is: {a}")
print(f"The value for b is: {b}")

# The mapping from the trace parameters (q,z) to the HOMFLY polynomial
# variables (x,y) is given by the equations:
# q = x^a
# z = x^b * y
# With our found values, this becomes:
# q = x^2
# z = x^0 * y = y
print("Therefore, the required transformation is:")
print("q = x^2")
print("z = y")

# Each number in the final equation:
print("\nFinal Equation Breakdown:")
