# This script predicts the effect of Interleukin-15 (IL-15) on CAR T cell cytokine release.
# Since this is a conceptual biological prediction, we use variables to represent the
# relative levels of cytokine release under different manufacturing conditions.

# Let's assign a baseline conceptual unit for the cytokine release from T cells
# manufactured without IL-15. We'll set this baseline to 1.
cytokine_release_without_il15 = 1.0

# Evidence suggests IL-15 enhances T cell fitness and function. We predict this
# leads to a more robust effector response, including greater cytokine release.
# We will model this as a significant, positive fold-change. Let's use 1.5
# as a symbolic representation of this enhancement.
predicted_enhancement_factor = 1.5

# Calculate the predicted relative cytokine release for IL-15 treated cells.
cytokine_release_with_il15 = cytokine_release_without_il15 * predicted_enhancement_factor

# Now, we print the prediction and the conceptual equation.
print("Prediction: Based on its role in enhancing T cell fitness and survival, Interleukin-15 is predicted to increase cytokine release in CAR T cells upon antigen stimulation.")
print("\nThis prediction can be expressed with the following conceptual inequality:")

# The final "equation" (an inequality) shows the predicted relationship.
