    "In the Feynman path integral formalism for many-body systems, the bare (or non-interacting) Green's function, $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single particle in the absence of any interactions. To find its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, it's most convenient to work in frequency-momentum space.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Start with the non-interacting Hamiltonian, $H_0$**, which is diagonal in the basis of single-particle states $|k\\rangle$ with energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.\n2.  **Formulate the problem in frequency space.** The equation of motion for a particle in this system involves the operator $(i\\partial_t - H_0)$. After a Fourier transform from the time domain ($t$) to the frequency domain ($\\omega$), this operator becomes $(\\omega - H_0)$.\n3.  **Define the Green's function.** The Green's function is defined as the inverse of this operator. In the eigenbasis of $H_0$, the operator is simply the scalar value $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n4.  **State the relationship.** Therefore, the inverse is $G_0(k, \\omega) = (\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$. A small imaginary term, $i\\delta$, is typically added to the denominator to handle the singularity at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$ and enforce causality, giving the final form: $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$.\n5.  **Conclusion.** The functional dependence is an inverse relationship: $G_0$ is inversely proportional to $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that calculates the value of the bare Green's function for given inputs of $\\omega$ and $\\epsilon_k$, demonstrating this inverse relationship and printing the full equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef display_bare_greens_function(omega, epsilon_k, delta=0.1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the bare Green's function G_0(k, omega).\n\n    In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 has a\n    simple inverse dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue epsilon_k.\n    The formula in frequency-momentum space is:\n\n        G_0(k, omega) = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*delta)\n\n    where delta is a small positive infinitesimal that enforces causality.\n\n    This function demonstrates this relationship with example values.\n\n    Args:\n        omega (float): The frequency.\n        epsilon_k (float): The single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n        delta (float, optional): A small positive value for the imaginary part.\n                                 Defaults to 0.1 for visualization.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The term in the denominator\n    # For calculation, we use the cmath library for complex numbers\n    denominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * delta\n    \n    # Calculate the Green's function\n    G_0 = 1 / denominator\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation with all numbers\n    print(\"The bare Green's function G_0 is a function of frequency (omega) and the single-particle energy eigenvalue (epsilon_k).\")\n    print(\"The functional dependence is an inverse relationship:\")\n    print(\"G_0(k, omega) = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*delta)\\n\")\n    print(\"For the given values:\")\n    print(f\"  omega     = {omega}\")\n    print(f\"  epsilon_k = {epsilon_k}\")\n    print(f\"  delta     = {delta}\\n\")\n    print(\"The equation is:\")\n    # We use .real and .imag for clean printing of the complex denominator\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {epsilon_k} + {denominator.imag:.1f}i)\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({denominator.real} + {denominator.imag:.1f}i)\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = {G_0.real:.4f} + {G_0.imag:.4f}i\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # --- Example Values ---\n    # Frequency of the particle\n    example_omega = 5.0\n    # Energy of the single-particle state 'k'\n    example_epsilon_k = 3.5\n\n    # Calculate and display the result\n    display_bare_greens_function(example_omega, example_epsilon_k)\n\n```\n<<<G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}>>>"
