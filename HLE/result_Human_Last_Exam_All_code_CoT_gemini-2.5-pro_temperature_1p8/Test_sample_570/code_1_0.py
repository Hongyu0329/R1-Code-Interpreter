# The problem asks for the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects all lines
# of the form px + qy = 1, where p and q are coprime integers.
# As derived in the thinking steps, this is a known problem in convex geometry.
# While simple shapes like a square of area 2 or a circle of area pi can be
# shown to be valid domains, they are not the ones with the minimal area.
# The exact minimal area is given by the expression 12 / pi^2.

# Here we define the numbers used in the final equation.
numerator = 12
pi_value = math.pi
power = 2

# Calculate the result
minimal_area = numerator / (pi_value**power)

# We print the final equation with the numerical values, as requested.
print("The formula for the minimal area is: numerator / (pi^power)")
print(f"The numbers in the final equation are: numerator={numerator}, pi={pi_value}, power={power}")
print(f"Calculation: {numerator} / ({pi_value}^{power}) = {minimal_area}")
print(f"The minimal area is: {minimal_area}")
