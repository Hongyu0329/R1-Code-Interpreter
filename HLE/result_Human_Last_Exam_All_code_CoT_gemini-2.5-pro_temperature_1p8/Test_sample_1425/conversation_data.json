    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the partition function in the grand canonical ensemble using path integrals, followed by a Python script to display the final result.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\n1.  **Start with the Definition:** The grand canonical partition function, `Z`, for a quantum system is defined as the trace (`Tr`) of the statistical operator `exp(-βH')`, where `β = 1/(k_B T)` is the inverse temperature and `H'` is the grand canonical Hamiltonian. The user specifies this Hamiltonian as `H' = H - μN`, where `H` is the system's Hamiltonian, `μ` is the chemical potential, and `N` is the particle number operator.\n    So, `Z = Tr(exp[-β(H - μN)])`.\n\n2.  **Introduce Imaginary Time:** The expression `exp(-βH')` is mathematically equivalent to the time-evolution operator `exp(-iH't/ħ)` if we substitute real time `t` with imaginary time `τ = i t/ħ` and evolve for a duration `τ` from `0` to `β`.\n\n3.  **Express the Trace as a Path Integral:** The trace operation can be written as a sum over a complete set of states. In the path integral formulation, this is represented by an integral over all possible field configurations `ψ(x, τ)` that are periodic (for bosons) or anti-periodic (for fermions) in the imaginary time direction `τ` with period `β`. This transforms the operator expression into a functional integral:\n    `Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] exp(-S_E[ψ*, ψ])`\n    Here, `∫ D[ψ*, ψ]` denotes the functional integral over all field configurations, and `S_E` is the Euclidean action.\n\n4.  **Derive the Euclidean Action (S_E):** The action `S_E` is the time integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian, `L_E`. The Lagrangian for the grand canonical ensemble includes the term related to the chemical potential.\n    The action is given by:\n    `S_E = ∫_0^β dτ L_E`\n    And the Euclidean Lagrangian `L_E` corresponds to `∫ d^d x [ ψ*(∂_τ)ψ + H'(ψ*, ψ) ]`.\n    Substituting `H' = H - μN`, where `H(ψ*, ψ)` is the Hamiltonian density and `N` is represented by `ψ*ψ`:\n    `S_E = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x [ ψ*(x, τ) (∂/∂τ)ψ(x, τ) + H(ψ*, ψ) - μψ*(x, τ)ψ(x, τ) ]`\n    The term `H(ψ*, ψ)` contains the kinetic and interaction parts of the original Hamiltonian.\n\n5.  **Final Formula:** Combining these steps gives the final expression for the grand canonical partition function `Z` as a path integral. The following Python code will print this final equation and explain all its components clearly.\n\n```python\ndef display_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the formula for the grand canonical partition function\n    using the path integral formulation and explains its components.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Explanation of the terms\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nThe grand canonical partition function (Z) is expressed as a functional integral over all possible field configurations.
