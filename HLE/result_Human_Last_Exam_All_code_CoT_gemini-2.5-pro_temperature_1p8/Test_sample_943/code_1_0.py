# The problem is to find K from the slice rank expression (3/2^K)^n * e^(o(n)).
# Our analysis shows that the slice rank of the tensor grows asymptotically as 2^n.
# By equating the bases of the exponential growth, we get the final equation:
# 2 = 3 / (2^K)

# We can solve this equation for K:
# 2 * 2^K = 3
# 2^(K+1) = 3
# K + 1 = log2(3)
# K = log2(3) - 1 = log2(3/2)

# The numbers in the final equation we solve are 3 and 2.
numerator = 3.0
denominator = 2.0

# Calculate K using the equation K = log2(numerator / denominator)
K = math.log2(numerator / denominator)

# Output the components of the final equation and the resulting value of K.
print(f"The equation for K is derived from 2 = {numerator} / (2^K).")
print(f"This simplifies to K = log2({numerator}/{denominator}).")
