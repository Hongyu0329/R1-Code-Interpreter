    "My plan to determine the A($\\alpha$)-stability angle for BDF4 is as follows:\n\n1.  **A($\\alpha$)-stability theory:** A numerical method is A($\\alpha$)-stable if its stability region contains the sector $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha\\}$. The angle $\\alpha$ is maximized when the boundary of this sector, the rays $z = re^{i(\\pi \\pm \\alpha)}$, are tangent to the stability region boundary.\n\n2.  **Stability Boundary:** The stability boundary of a linear multistep method is given by the curve $z(\\theta) = \\rho(e^{i\\theta}) / \\sigma(e^{i\\theta})$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. For BDF4, the characteristic polynomials are:\n    *   $\\rho(\\xi) = \\frac{25}{12}\\xi^4 - 4\\xi^3 + 3\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi + \\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   $\\sigma(\\xi) = \\xi^4$\n\n3.  **Tangency Condition:** The tangent to the curve $z(\\theta)$ at a point $z_0 = z(\\theta_0)$ passes through the origin if the position vector $z_0$ and the tangent vector $z'(\\theta_0)$ are parallel. This is equivalent to their ratio $z'(\\theta_0)/z(\\theta_0)$ being a real number. This condition simplifies to:\n    $$ \\text{Re}\\left(\\frac{e^{i\\theta}\\rho'(e^{i\\theta})}{\\rho(e^{i\\theta})}\\right) = 4 $$\n\n4.  **Polynomial Equation:** This condition can be transformed into a polynomial equation in terms of $c = \\cos(\\theta)$. This equation is of a high degree and is not practical to solve by hand.\n\n5.  **Numerical Solution:** I will use Python to construct this polynomial and find its roots numerically. The relevant root $c_0$ is the one in the interval $(-1, 1)$, which corresponds to a point on the unit circle.\n\n6.  **Calculating $\\alpha$:** Once the root $c_0$ is found, I will compute $\\theta_0 = \\arccos(c_0)$. Then I calculate the point on the stability boundary $z_0 = z(\\theta_0)$. The angle $\\alpha$ is given by $\\alpha = \\pi - |\\arg(z_0)|$. As requested, the final answer will be expressed in the form $\\arctan(T)$, where $T = \\tan(\\alpha)$. The code will compute and print this value.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_bdf4_stability_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the A(alpha)-stability angle for the BDF4 method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The condition for the tangent to the stability boundary passing through the\n    # origin can be formulated as a polynomial equation in c = cos(theta).\n    #\n    # The equation is derived from Re( (xi*rho'(xi)/rho(xi)) - 4 ) = 0 for xi = exp(i*theta).\n    # This leads to a high-degree polynomial in c = cos(theta).
