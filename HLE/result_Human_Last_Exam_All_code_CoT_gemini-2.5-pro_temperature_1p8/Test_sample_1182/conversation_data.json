    "To find the number of double points of the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the Genus**: First, we calculate the genus of the given hyperelliptic curve $C: y^2=f(x)$, where $f(x)=8x^5+4x^4+4x^3+x^2+8x$. The degree of the polynomial $f(x)$ is $n=5$. The genus $g$ is given by the formula $g = \\lfloor(n-1)/2\\rfloor$.\n\n2.  **Analyze Branch Points**: The stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is determined by the 2-adic distances between its branch points. The branch points of the map $x: C \\to \\mathbb{P}^1$ are the roots of $f(x)$ and the point at infinity. We need to find the 2-adic valuations of these branch points. This can be done using the Newton polygon method.\n\n3.  **Cluster Branch Points**: The branch points are partitioned into \"clusters\" based on their 2-adic valuations. The general principle is that points with positive valuation are separated from points with non-positive valuation. To handle the point at infinity correctly, we can work in the coordinate $t=1/x$. The branch points form two clusters.\n\n4.  **Determine Stable Fiber Components**: Each cluster of branch points corresponds to a component in the special fiber of the stable reduction. We can determine the genus of each of these components based on the number of branch points it contains. Our analysis reveals two components: one of genus 1 and one of genus 0.\n\n5.  **Calculate Number of Double Points**: The stable reduction must have the same arithmetic genus as the original curve. The arithmetic genus of a curve composed of multiple components connected by double points (nodes) is given by the formula: $p_a = \\sum g_i + N - C + 1$, where $\\sum g_i$ is the sum of the genera of the components, $N$ is the number of double points, and $C$ is the number of components. By setting $p_a = g$, we can solve for $N$.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out this calculation:\n\n```python\ndef solve_curve_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of double points on the stable reduction of the curve\n    y^2 = 8*x + 1*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5 above 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
