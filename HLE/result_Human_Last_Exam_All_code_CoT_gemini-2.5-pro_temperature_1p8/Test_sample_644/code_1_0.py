  Explains the remedy for the student superstition related to the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

  superstition_remedy = """
The superstition states that a student who climbs the Leaning Tower of Pisa before graduating will not be able to graduate.

To break this "curse," the student must do one of a few things. The most popular and well-known remedy is to go to the graduation ceremony of another student and applaud them enthusiastically.

Another remedy involves going to the nearby Camposanto Monumentale (the monumental cemetery) and counting the number of chains on the wall of the Cappella Amedeo di Savoia, supposedly getting the same number twice in a row.
