    This function demonstrates the derivation of the largest possible value of d.

    The problem implies that for any integer n, the following inequality for d must hold:
    d <= (n+1) / n
    which simplifies to:
    d <= 1 + 1/n

    This must be true for all n = 1, 2, 3, ...
    This means d must be smaller than or equal to the smallest of these bounds.
    The smallest bound is found by taking the limit as n -> infinity.
