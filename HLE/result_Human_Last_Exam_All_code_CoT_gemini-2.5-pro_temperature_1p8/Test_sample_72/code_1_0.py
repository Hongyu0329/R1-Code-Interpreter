    This function executes the logic to find the ungrammatical sentence.

    The analysis reveals a complex but consistent grammar, which sentence 9 violates.

    Key Rules Deduced:
    1.  The language has two noun classes.
        - Class A: Ezsu, Kerg
        - Class B: Doku, Ketan
    2.  For sentences with the verb 'otazsij', the presence of 'esku' is critical.
    3.  In all consistent sentences containing 'esku' (7, 8, 11), both the subject and object nouns take the '-et' ending.
        - e.g., Sentence 7: Ezsuet(A) kergoet(A) esku ... kaij.
        - e.g., Sentence 8: Kergoet(A) dokujet(B) esku ... kosaij.
    4.  The final word in these 'esku' sentences depends on the noun classes:
        - 'kaij' for same-class pairs (A+A or B+B).
        - 'kosaij' for different-class pairs (A+B).

    The Contradiction in Sentence 9:
    Sentence 9 is: "Dokujet ketanne esku otazsij kaij."
    - It contains 'esku'.
    - The nouns are Doku (Class B) and Ketan (Class B). The use of the final word 'kaij' is correct for a same-class pair (B+B).
    - However, it violates the rule for noun endings. The presence of 'esku' requires both nouns to end in '-et'.
    - In sentence 9, the object is 'ketanne' (ending in '-e'), which contradicts the established 'S-et O-et' pattern for sentences with 'esku'.

    Therefore, sentence 9 is the ungrammatical one.
