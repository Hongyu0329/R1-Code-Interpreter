    "To determine which classical ballet step has the same ending and starting leg position, I will analyze the mechanics of each step provided in the answer choices. The goal is to find the step that, in its standard execution, does not change the configuration of the feet (i.e., the same foot that started in front ends in front).\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a data structure in Python to hold the ballet steps and their properties.\n2.  For each step, I'll define a key characteristic: whether it changes the position of the feet upon completion.\n    *   **Entrechat six**: An entrechat with an even number (six) involves three crossings of the legs. An odd number of crossings results in the feet switching their front/back orientation. Thus, it changes the position.\n    *   **Échappé battu changé**: The name itself contains \"changé,\" which means \"changed\" in French. This step explicitly finishes with the feet in the opposite position.\n    *   **Assemblé**: Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step involves brushing one leg out, jumping off the other, and bringing both legs together to land in fifth position. A basic assemblé (e.g., brushing the front foot to the side and returning it to the front) lands in the exact same starting position. While some variations do change the feet, it's the only step in the list that has a common, fundamental version that does not.\n    *   **Glissade derrière**: \"Glissade\" means to glide, and \"derrière\" means to the back. In this step, the dancer glides the starting front foot to the side and closes the other foot behind it, changing the starting configuration.\n    *   **Gargouillade**: This is a complex, decorative step similar to a pas de chat, which almost always involves landing with the feet switched.\n3.  The code will iterate through this data and identify which step does not inherently change the starting position.\n4.  The program will print the analysis for each step and then conclude with the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# On Python 2, we need to explicitly set the encoding to handle special characters\nif sys.version_info[0] < 3:\n    reload(sys)\n    sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')\n\ndef analyze_ballet_steps():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to determine which one ends in the same\n    position it started from.\n    \"\"\"\n    steps = {\n        'A': {'name': 'Entrechat six', 'changes_position': True,\n              'reason': 'Has an odd number of leg crossings (3), which switches the feet.'},\n        'B': {'name': 'Échappé battu changé', 'changes_position': True,\n              'reason': 'The word \"changé\" literally means \"changed\", indicating the feet switch positions.'},\n        'C': {'name': 'Assemblé', 'changes_position': False,\n              'reason': 'A basic assemblé, such as brushing the front foot to the side and returning it to the front, lands in the exact same starting position.
