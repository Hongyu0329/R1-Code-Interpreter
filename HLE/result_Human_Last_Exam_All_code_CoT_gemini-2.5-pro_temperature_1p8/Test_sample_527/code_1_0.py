    # The problem can be interpreted as determining the structure of a group
    # G = <a,...,z | w=1 for all w in English_Words>.
    # The relations w=1 create equivalences between the letters and their inverses.
    # For example, if 'on' is a word, on=1, so o = n^{-1}.
    # If 'no' is a word, no=1, so n = o^{-1}, which is the same relation.
    # If 'is' and 'it' are words, i=s^{-1} and i=t^{-1}, so s=t.
    # This suggests that many letters will become equivalent. If we find that all
    # letters a-z are equivalent to a single generator 'g', and we have words
    # of coprime length, like 'of' (length 2) and 'the' (length 3), we would
    # get g^2 = 1 and g^3 = 1. This implies g = g^3 * (g^2)^{-1} = 1 * 1 = 1.

    # has size 1. This algorithm tests that hypothesis by finding all such
    # equivalences.
