# 1. Area in Quadrants 1, 2, and 4
# In each quadrant, the area is a triangle with base L and height L.
# Area of one such triangle is 0.5 * L * L.
# There are three such quadrants.
area_q1_q2_q4 = 3 * (0.5 * L**2)

# 2. Area in Quadrant 3
# The area is partitioned into three disjoint regions.

# 2a. The vertical strip region where -1 <= x <= 0 and y <= -1.
# The area is bounded by x=-1, x=0, y=-1, and the rope limit y = -x - L.
# We can calculate this area using an integral of the height of the region:
# Integral from x=-1 to x=0 of ( (top y) - (bottom y) ) dx
# Integral from x=-1 to x=0 of ( -1 - (-x - L) ) dx = Integral of (x + L - 1) dx
# The antiderivative is x^2/2 + (L-1)x.
# Evaluating from -1 to 0: (0) - ((-1)^2/2 + (L-1)*(-1)) = -(0.5 - L + 1) = L - 1.5
# So, the area is (3.5 - 1.5) = 2.0
area_strip_1 = L - 1.5

# 2b. The horizontal strip region where y in [-1, 0] and x <= -1.
# By symmetry, this area is the same as the vertical strip.
area_strip_2 = L - 1.5

# 2c. The corner region where x <= -1 and y <= -1.
# The path pivots at the corner (-1, -1).
# The taxi-cab distance to this pivot is |-1| + |-1| = 2.
# Remaining rope length is L - 2 = 3.5 - 2 = 1.5.
# This forms a diamond centered at (-1, -1) with taxi-cab radius 1.5.
# The total area of this diamond is 2 * (1.5)^2 = 4.5.
# We are only interested in the bottom-left quadrant of this diamond.
# Area of this quadrant is (1/4) of the total diamond area.
radius_corner = L - 2.0
area_corner = (1.0 / 4.0) * (2.0 * radius_corner**2)

# 3. Total Area
# Sum of all the parts.
total_area = area_q1_q2_q4 + area_strip_1 + area_strip_2 + area_corner

# Print the final equation with all its components
