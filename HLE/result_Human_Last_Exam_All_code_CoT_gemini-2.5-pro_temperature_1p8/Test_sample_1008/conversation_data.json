    "In a dance scene, the primary goal is to convey emotion and story through movement, which is almost always synchronized with music. Therefore, the sound hierarchy prioritizes the elements that drive the dance itself.\n\n1.  **Music:** This is the most crucial element. The choreography is created for the music, and the music sets the pace, rhythm, and emotional tone of the entire scene. It is the foundation upon which the dance is built.\n2.  **Sound Effects (SFX):** These are secondary but important for adding realism and texture. The sound of feet on the floor (taps, slides, stomps), the rustle of costumes, and other environmental sounds ground the dance in reality and enhance the sensory experience. They support the music and the visuals.\n3.  **Speech (Dialogue):** This is typically the least important element in a dance scene. Dialogue can be distracting and is often absent altogether. If it exists, it's usually minimal, serving as brief interjections or as a background voice-over that doesn't interfere with the music and dance.\n\nBased on this, the hierarchy is Music, Sound Effects, Speech.\n\n```python\n# The following script prints the ranking of sound importance in film dance scenes.\n# The ranking is based on the role each sound element plays in the scene's storytelling.\n\n# The elements to be ranked.\nelements = [\"Music\", \"Sound Effects\", \"Speech\"]\n\n# The final ranked order.\nranked_order = \", \".join(elements)\n\n# Printing the result as requested.\nprint(ranked_order)\n```\n<<<Music, Sound Effects, Speech>>>"
