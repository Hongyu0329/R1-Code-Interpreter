    "An analytical expression that approximates the solution of the given third-order ordinary differential equation for large $x$ can be found by analyzing the dominant terms of the equation as $x \\to \\infty$.\n\n**1. The ODE and its terms**\n\nThe ODE is given by:\n$y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\n\nWe are looking for a solution in the large $x$ regime. Let's analyze each term's behavior for large $x$:\n-   The term $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$ is likely to decay to zero, as the denominator grows quadratically with $x$, assuming $y''$ does not grow as fast as $x^2$.\n-   The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x) + 1}$ is an oscillatory, periodic term. For an asymptotic analysis, we can consider its effect to be negligible compared to potentially dominant algebraic terms, or we can approximate it by its average value, which is $0.5$. For this analysis, we will assume this bounded oscillatory term is sub-dominant.\n\nWith these simplifications, the approximate ODE for large $x$ becomes:\n$y''' \\approx y^{4} + y'^{4}$\n\n**2. Dominant Balance Analysis**\n\nTo find the asymptotic form of the solution, we can test a power-law ansatz, $y(x) = A x^{n}$. Let's substitute this into the full ODE and identify the dominant terms.\n\n-   $y(x) = A x^n$\n-   $y'(x) = n A x^{n-1}$\n-   $y''(x) = n(n-1) A x^{n-2}$\n-   $y'''(x) = n(n-1)(n-2) A x^{n-3}$\n\nThe powers of $x$ for the main terms in the original ODE are:\n-   $y''': x^{n-3}$\n-   $y^4: x^{4n}$\n-   $y'^4: x^{4n-4}$\n-   $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}: x^{n-4}$\n-   $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$: This is an oscillating term of order $O(1)$, which corresponds to $x^0$.\n\nFor large $x$, a decaying solution where $y \\to 0$ seems plausible. Let's assume $n < 0$. In this case, the term with the highest power of $x$ (i.e., the least negative exponent) is the $O(1)$ term from $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$. This leads to an inconsistent balance ($0 \\approx O(1)$).\n\nHowever, if we strictly consider the algebraic terms, a dominant balance can be found. Let's compare the exponents $n-3$, $4n$, and $4n-4$.\nFor large $x$ and a decaying solution ($n<0$), the least negative exponents among these are $n-3$ and $4n$ if we choose $n=-1$.\nLet's set $n=-1$:\n-   $y''' \\sim x^{-4}$\n-   $y^4 \\sim x^{-4}$\n-   $y'^4 \\sim x^{-8}$\n-   $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2} \\sim x^{-5}$\n\nThe terms $y'''$ and $y^4$ are dominant among the algebraic terms. The term $y'^4$ and the term involving $y''$ decay faster. Under the assumption that we can neglect the oscillatory term, the dominant balance for large $x$ is given by:\n$y''' \\approx y^4$\n\n**3. Solving for the Coefficients**\n\nNow we substitute $y(x) = A x^{-1}$ into the approximate equation $y''' \\approx y^4$:\n-   $y''' = n(n-1)(n-2) A x^{n-3} = (-1)(-2)(-3) A x^{-4} = -6 A x^{-4}$\n-   $y^4 = (A x^{-1})^4 = A^4 x^{-4}$\n\nEquating the expressions, we get:\n$-6 A x^{-4} = A^4 x^{-4}$\n$-6 A = A^4$\n\nThis gives two solutions for $A$: $A=0$ (the trivial solution) or $A^3 = -6$. We are interested in the non-trivial solution.\n$A = \\sqrt[3]{-6}$\n\nSo, the analytical expression approximating the solution for large $x$ is:\n$y(x) \\approx \\sqrt[3]{-6} \\cdot x^{-1}$\n\nThe python code will calculate the value of $A = \\sqrt[3]{-6}$ and print out the parameters of the final equation $y(x) = A \\cdot x^n$ with A rounded to two decimal places.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the coefficient A from the relation A^3 = -6\n# We take the real cube root.\nA = -math.pow(6, 1/3)\n\n# The power n was determined to be -1 from the dominant balance analysis.\nn = -1.0\n\n# Round the coefficient to two decimal places as requested.\nA_rounded = round(A, 2)\nn_rounded = round(n, 2)\n\nprint(\"The analytical expression is of the form: y(x) = A * x^n\")\nprint(\"From the analysis, the determined parameters are:\")\nprint(f\"A = {A_rounded:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"n = {n_rounded:.2f}\")\nprint(\"Thus, the approximate solution for large x is:\")\nprint(f\"y(x) = {A_rounded:.2f} * x^({n_rounded:.2f})\")\nprint(\"Final equation with numbers:\")\nprint(f\"y(x) = {A_rounded:.2f} / x\")\n```\n<<<-1.82>>>"
