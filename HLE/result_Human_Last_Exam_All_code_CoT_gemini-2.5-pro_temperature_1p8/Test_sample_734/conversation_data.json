    "My plan is to first identify the Christian theologian who developed the specific terminology requested. The question points to a figure who dealt with the relationship between divine action (miracles, post-lapsarian changes) and the created natural order. I will search for theologians who wrote extensively on Creation, the Fall, and Christology, looking for unique concepts explaining how laws of nature could be altered or contain hidden potentialities. The most likely candidate is Augustine of Hippo with his doctrine of \"seminal reasons\" (*rationes seminales*). I will confirm that this doctrine was applied to both the changes in nature after the Fall and to explain the virgin birth.\n\nOnce the theologian is identified, I will construct a simple Python script to print the name, fulfilling the user's request to provide a coding solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_theologian():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the name of the theologian\n  who developed the concept of 'seminal reasons' (rationes seminales)\n  to explain changes in the laws of nature.\n  \"\"\"\n  theologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n  concept = \"seminal reasons (rationes seminales)\"\n  \n  print(f\"The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe these phenomena is {theologian_name}.\")\n  print(f\"He proposed the concept of '{concept}', suggesting God embedded hidden potentials within creation from the beginning.\")\n  print(\"According to Augustine, changes at the Fall and miracles like the virgin birth were not violations of nature, but the activation of these pre-ordained potentials.\")\n\nfind_theologian()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
