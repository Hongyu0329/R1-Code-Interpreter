    "To determine the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we will analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene ring. At positions 1, 3, and 5, it is substituted with three identical chiral groups. This substitution pattern preserves a C3 axis of rotational symmetry for the molecule. Due to this symmetry, we only need to count the number of unique proton environments in the central core and in *one* of the three identical substituent arms. The corresponding protons in the other two arms are chemically equivalent and will not create new signals.\n\n2.  **Central Core Protons:** The central core is a 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene moiety where the protons at positions 1, 3, and 5 have been replaced by the substituent arms.\n    *   There are no aromatic protons on the central ring.\n    *   There are three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6. Due to the C3 symmetry, these three groups are chemically equivalent. Their nine protons will produce **1 peak**.\n\n3.  **Substituent Arm Protons:** We analyze one of the identical arms: `-[CH2]-[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)]`. We can break this arm into two parts.\n    *   **-CH2- linker:** The two protons of this methylene group are adjacent to a rigid, chiral center (the camphor-indazole group). This makes them diastereotopic, meaning they are in different chemical environments. They will produce **2 distinct peaks**.\n    *   **Camphor-indazole unit:** This unit is a rigid, chiral bicyclic system. The lack of symmetry within this unit means that protons that are not related by any local symmetry will be chemically non-equivalent.\n        *   **Pyrazole ring proton (H3):** There is one proton on the unsaturated five-membered ring. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   **Methyl groups:** There are three methyl groups in the camphor-derived framework. They are all in distinct, asymmetric environments. This gives **3 peaks**.\n        *   **Saturated ring protons:** The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-like skeleton contains several C-H bonds.\n            *   One bridgehead proton (C4-H). This gives **1 peak**.\n            *   Two methylene groups (at C5 and C6). In each group, the two protons (exo and endo) are diastereotopic. This gives 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n        *   In total, the camphor-indazole unit has 1 + 3 + 1 + 4 = **9 peaks**.\n\n4.  **Total Peaks Calculation:** The total number of peaks is the sum of the unique peaks from the core and one full arm.\n    *   Total Peaks = (Core peaks) + (Linker peaks) + (Camphor-indazole unit peaks)\n    *   Total Peaks = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12.\n\nThe following python script will formalize this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Account for the number of unique proton signals from the central symmetric core.\n# 2. Account for the number of unique proton signals from one of the three identical substituent arms.\n# 3. Sum these numbers to find the total number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n# The central core is 1,3,5-substituted-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n# The three methyl groups are equivalent due to C3 symmetry.\ncore_peaks = 1\n\n# One substituent arm consists of a -CH2- linker and a camphor-indazole unit.\n# The two protons of the -CH2- linker are diastereotopic because they are next to a chiral center.\nlinker_peaks = 2\n\n# The camphor-indazole unit is a rigid, chiral system. We count its non-equivalent protons:\n# - 1 proton on the pyrazole ring.\n# - 3 non-equivalent methyl groups.\n# - 5 non-equivalent protons on the saturated bicyclic frame (1 CH and 2x CH2, where each CH2 has diastereotopic protons).\nindazole_unit_peaks = 1 + 3 + (1 + 2 + 2)\n\n# Calculate the total number of peaks\ntotal_peaks = core_peaks + linker_peaks + indazole_unit_peaks\n\nprint(\"Calculation of 1H NMR Peaks:\")\nprint(\"1. Central Core Peaks:\")\nprint(f\"   - The 3 equivalent methyl groups on the benzene ring produce {core_peaks} peak.\")\nprint(\"\\n2.
