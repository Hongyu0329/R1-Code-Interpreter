    "Here is my plan to solve this puzzle:\n1.  **Analyze the Input**: I will look at the provided list of words (`utpshtheas`, `fkuhu`, `numhkatnatu`, `anhaeketn`) and assume they correspond to the numerical sequence 1, 2, 3, and a target number we need to find.\n2.  **Identify the Pattern**: I will examine the properties of each word to find a consistent mathematical rule that results in its corresponding number (1, 2, or 3). My primary hypothesis is that the calculation involves the vowels and consonants within each word.\n3.  **Test the Pattern**:\n    *   For `utpshtheas` -> 1: I will count its unique vowels and unique consonants and see if a simple arithmetic operation on these counts equals 1.\n    *   For `fkuhu` -> 2: I will apply the same rule to see if it results in 2.\n    *   For `numhkatnatu` -> 3: I will again verify the rule to see if it results in 3.\n4.  **Decode the Final Word**: Once the pattern is confirmed, I will apply the same rule to the final word, `anhaeketn`, to calculate its decoded value.\n5.  **Generate the Code**: I will write a Python script that implements this logic. The script will identify the unique vowels and consonants in the word `anhaeketn`, perform the calculation, and print the resulting equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef decode_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    Decodes the given word based on the pattern:\n    (number of unique consonants) - (number of unique vowels).\n    \"\"\"\n    word = \"anhaeketn\"\n    vowels = \"aeiou\"\n\n    # Find the sets of unique characters, vowels, and consonants\n    unique_chars = set(word)\n    unique_vowels = {char for char in unique_chars if char in vowels}\n    unique_consonants = unique_chars - unique_vowels\n\n    # Get the counts\n    num_unique_consonants = len(unique_consonants)\n    num_unique_vowels = len(unique_vowels)\n\n    # Calculate the final result\n    result = num_unique_consonants - num_unique_vowels\n\n    # Print the equation and the result\n    print(f\"{num_unique_consonants} - {num_unique_vowels} = {result}\")\n\ndecode_word()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
