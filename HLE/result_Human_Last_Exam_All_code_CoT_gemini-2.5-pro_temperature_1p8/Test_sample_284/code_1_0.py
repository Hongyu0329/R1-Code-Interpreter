    Calculates the critical exponent for the Fourier restriction problem on the moment curve.
    
    The problem asks for the largest possible value of p such that no L^p function
    on R^3 can have its Fourier support lying on the moment curve. This value is
    the critical exponent in the sharp L^2 extension theorem for the moment curve.

    The theorem states that the extension operator from L^2 on the curve to L^p on R^n
    is bounded if and only if p >= n(n+1)/(n-1).
