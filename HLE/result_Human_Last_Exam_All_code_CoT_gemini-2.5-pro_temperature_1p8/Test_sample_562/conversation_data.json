    "My plan is to first identify the character in question, which is 謄. Then, I will deconstruct the character to find its radical (bushu). The character 謄 is composed of 言 on the left and 朕 on the right. The radical is the classificatory element, which in this case is 言 on the left. When the radical 言 appears on the left side of a character, it has a specific name. I will identify this name, which is ごんべん (gonben), and then provide its standard Hepburn romanization. Finally, I will create a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the radical for the Japanese character 謄.\n    \"\"\"\n    character = \"謄\"\n    radical_kanji = \"言\"\n    radical_name_japanese = \"ごんべん\"\n    radical_name_hepburn = \"Gonben\"\n\n    print(f\"The Japanese character is: {character}\")\n    print(f\"The radical (bushu) is: {radical_kanji}\")\n    print(f\"The Hepburn transcription of the radical's name is: {radical_name_hepburn}\")\n\nfind_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
