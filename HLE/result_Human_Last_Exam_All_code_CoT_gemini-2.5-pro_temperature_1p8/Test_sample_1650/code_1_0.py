    ## Derivation of the Overlap Integral for two 2s orbitals in H₂⁺

    The goal is to find the overlap integral, S, for two hydrogenic 2s orbitals, 
    one centered on nucleus A (ψ_2sA) and one on nucleus B (ψ_2sB), separated by a distance R.

    **Step 1: Define the Wavefunctions and the Integral**

    The overlap integral is defined as:
    S = ∫ ψ_2sA* ψ_2sB dτ

    The normalized hydrogenic 2s orbital (in atomic units, a₀=1) is given by:
    ψ_2s(r, ζ) = (1 / (4 * sqrt(2π))) * ζ^(3/2) * (2 - ζ*r) * exp(-ζ*r / 2)

    Where ζ is the effective nuclear charge and r is the distance from the nucleus.
    Since the wavefunctions are real, ψ* = ψ. The product of the two orbitals is:
    ψ_2sA * ψ_2sB = N² * [4 - 2ζ(r_A + r_B) + ζ²r_A*r_B] * exp(-ζ(r_A + r_B) / 2)
    (where N is the normalization constant ζ^(3/2) / (4 * sqrt(2π)))

    **Step 2: Convert to Elliptical Coordinates**

    We use elliptical coordinates (λ, μ, φ) for this two-center problem.
    λ = (r_A + r_B) / R        (1 ≤ λ < ∞)
    μ = (r_A - r_B) / R        (-1 ≤ μ ≤ 1)
    φ = azimuthal angle        (0 ≤ φ ≤ 2π)

    From these definitions, we have:
    r_A + r_B = R * λ
    r_A * r_B = (R²/4) * (λ² - μ²)
    The volume element in these coordinates is: dτ = (R³/8) * (λ² - μ²) dλ dμ dφ

    **Step 3: Set up and Simplify the Integral**

    Substituting these into the integral for S:
    S = ∫₀²π dφ ∫₋₁¹ dμ ∫₁^∞ dλ { N² * [4 - 2ζRλ + (ζ²R²/4)(λ² - μ²)] * exp(-ζRλ / 2) * (R³/8) * (λ² - μ²) }

    Integration over φ is trivial, yielding a factor of 2π. We then integrate over μ from -1 to 1. 
    This is a polynomial integration which results in a new, more complex polynomial that depends only on λ.

    **Step 4: The Final Integration over λ**

    The last step is to solve the integral over λ from 1 to infinity.
    This integral is of the form ∫₁^∞ P(λ) * exp(-aλ) dλ, where P(λ) is the polynomial from the previous step and a = ζR/2.
    This is solved using a set of standard auxiliary integrals Aₙ(a) = ∫₁^∞ λⁿ * exp(-aλ) dλ.
    The calculation is algebraically intensive but follows a standard procedure.

    **Step 5: Assemble the Final Expression**

    After combining all the constants and the results from the sequential integration, we arrive at the final analytical expression for the overlap integral S.
    It is common to express the result in terms of the dimensionless variable ρ = ζ * R.
