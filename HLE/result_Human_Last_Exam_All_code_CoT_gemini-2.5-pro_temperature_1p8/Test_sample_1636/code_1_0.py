    This script analyzes the poem "Archipelago" to find the two reasons

    # The poem sets a scene of solitude and deep thought with phrases like
    # "At the grave edge of the world" and "I am agate, opaline."

    # Reason 1: The Literal Action
    # The phrase "measures and re-measures" describes a rhythmic, repetitive motion.
    # The most direct physical counterpart in the sea is the constant ebb and flow of the tides.
    # The tides continuously change the shoreline, thus literally "measuring" distance again and again.
    reason_1 = "To show the flow of tides"

    # Reason 2: The Metaphorical Meaning
    # The poem's introspective tone suggests that the sea's physical action is a metaphor
    # for a mental or emotional process. The restless, repetitive movement of the water
    # mirrors the human mind turning over thoughts, contemplating its own isolation and place in the world.
    reason_2 = "evoke ideas of introspective contemplation"
    
    # We combine the literal and metaphorical reasons to find the best answer choice.
    # Choice A correctly identifies both the physical process (tides) and the
    # psychological state (contemplation) it represents in the context of the poem.
