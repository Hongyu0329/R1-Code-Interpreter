    "My plan is to solve this question by using a Python script.\nThe script will follow these steps:\n1.  Define the frequency range of a human muscle twitch. This is a very low-frequency sound, typically in the infrasound range.\n2.  Define the approximate lower hearing threshold for each animal in the answer choices.\n3.  Create a small \"equation\" or comparison for each animal: check if the animal's hearing range covers the frequency of a muscle twitch.\n4.  Print the analysis for each animal, showing the numbers used in the comparison. This will satisfy the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n5.  Based on the analysis, determine which animal is the most likely candidate. The key is not just the ability to hear the frequency, but the sensitivity to faint sounds at that frequency.\n6.  Print a final conclusion that explains why the chosen animal is the best answer among the options.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_hearing_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes which animal from a list can hear human muscle twitches\n    by comparing sound frequency to animal hearing ranges.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the frequency of the sound source.\n    # Human muscle contractions (phonomyography) produce very low-frequency sounds.\n    MUSCLE_TWITCH_LOWER_HZ = 5\n    MUSCLE_TWITCH_UPPER_HZ = 25\n\n    # Step 2: Define the approximate lower hearing thresholds for each animal.\n    HEARING_LOWER_BOUND = {\n        'Human': 20,\n        'Dog': 67,\n        'Bat': 2000,\n        'Whale': 10,  # For baleen whales\n        'Herring': 1  # Represents known sensitivity to infrasound (< 20 Hz)\n    }\n\n    print(\"Thinking Process: To find the answer, we will check if the frequency of a human muscle twitch falls within the hearing range of each animal.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe 'equation' to solve is: Can an animal hear sounds between {MUSCLE_TWITCH_LOWER_HZ} Hz and {MUSCLE_TWITCH_UPPER_HZ} Hz?\")\n    print(\"Let's analyze each option, showing the numbers involved in our check.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 75)\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Analyze each choice\n    # Option E: Human\n    animal = 'Human'\n    threshold = HEARING_LOWER_BOUND[animal]\n    print(f\"E. {animal}:\")\n    print(f\"   The hearing threshold is ~{threshold} Hz.
