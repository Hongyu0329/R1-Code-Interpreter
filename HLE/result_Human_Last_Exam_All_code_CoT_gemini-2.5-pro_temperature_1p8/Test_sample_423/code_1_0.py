# Molar masses of elements
M_C = 12.01
M_H = 1.008
M_O = 16.00

# Step 1: Determine the formula of product B from its mass fractions.
# Mass fractions: C = 0.5, H = 0.1, O = 0.4
# Assuming 100 g of substance B:
mass_C_in_B = 50.0
mass_H_in_B = 10.0
mass_O_in_B = 40.0

# Calculate moles of each element in B
moles_C_in_B = mass_C_in_B / M_C
moles_H_in_B = mass_H_in_B / M_H
moles_O_in_B = mass_O_in_B / M_O

# Find the simplest mole ratio by dividing by the smallest number of moles
smallest_moles = min(moles_C_in_B, moles_H_in_B, moles_O_in_B)
ratio_C = moles_C_in_B / smallest_moles
ratio_H = moles_H_in_B / smallest_moles
ratio_O = moles_O_in_B / smallest_moles

# To get integer ratios, we can see that C is ~1.66 (5/3), H is ~4, O is 1. Multiply by 3.
emp_C = int(round(ratio_C * 3))
emp_H = int(round(ratio_H * 3))
emp_O = int(round(ratio_O * 3))

# Since B is reduced to n-pentane, it must have 5 carbon atoms. Our empirical formula already has C=5.
# So, the molecular formula of B is C5H12O3.
molecular_formula_B = f"C{emp_C}H{emp_H}O{emp_O}"
# The structure is pentane-2,3,4-triol.

# Step 2: Deduce the formula of product A.
# A is reduced to B (C5H12O3). This reduction adds hydrogen by converting carbonyls to alcohols.
# C5H?O3 + ?H2 -> C5H12O3.
# The addition of 6 hydrogens (12 - 6 from the H/C ratio established later) implies the reduction of 3 carbonyl groups.
# Therefore, A should be a trione: C5H6O3.
molecular_formula_A = "C5H6O3" # pentane-2,3,4-trione

# Step 3: Deduce the formula of substance X.
# Ozonolysis of a symmetric X gives two molecules of A.
# X -> 2 A
# So, the formula of X is derived from two units of A's precursor.
# The ozonolysis reaction R-C=C-R -> 2 R-C=O adds one oxygen to each fragment.
# The fragment of X (let's call it P) has the formula C5H6O2.
# Therefore, X has the formula 2 * (C5H6O2) = C10H12O4.
formula_X_C = 5 * 2
formula_X_H = 6 * 2
formula_X_O = 2 * 2
molecular_formula_X = f"C{formula_X_C}H{formula_X_H}O{formula_X_O}"

# Step 4: Verify against experimental data for X.
# Calculate H/C ratio from X's deduced formula.
h_c_ratio_X_deduced = formula_X_H / formula_X_C

# Calculate H/C ratio from combustion data.
m_co2 = 0.7472
m_h2o = 0.1834
moles_C_in_X = m_co2 / (M_C + 2 * M_O)
moles_H_in_X = 2 * (m_h2o / (2 * M_H + M_O))
h_c_ratio_X_exp = moles_H_in_X / moles_C_in_X

# Calculate molar mass of the deduced formula for X and compare with the experimental value M ~ 150.
molar_mass_X_deduced = formula_X_C * M_C + formula_X_H * M_H + formula_X_O * M_O
exp_molar_mass = 150
error = ((molar_mass_X_deduced - exp_molar_mass) / exp_molar_mass) * 100
