    "Of course. Here is a plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I need to access my knowledge base on 20th-century philosophy, specifically focusing on the Lviv-Warsaw School of logic. The key is to find the philosopher who analyzed the concept of a \"hallmark\" (or a similar term like \"characteristic\" or \"sign\") by breaking it down into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\". This specific distinction between a natural sign (symptom) and a conventional sign (signal) is a known contribution of one of the school's prominent members.\n\nMy research points to Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. He made significant contributions to the philosophy of language and logic, and this specific semiotic distinction is attributed to him.\n\nTo fulfill your request, I will write a Python script that states this answer clearly. To satisfy the unusual constraint about including an equation with numbers, I will create a simple symbolic equation representing the components of the answer (1 philosopher, 2 key concepts) and then print the numbers from that equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_philosophy_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the philosopher and presents the answer\n    along with a symbolic equation as requested.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who made this distinction.\n    philosopher = \"Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\"\n\n    # The main concept and its decomposed parts.\n    main_concept = \"hallmark\"\n    component_1 = \"symptoms\"\n    component_2 = \"signals\"\n\n    # Print the direct answer to the question.\n    print(f\"The Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who decomposes the notion of '{main_concept}' into '{component_1}' and '{component_2}' is: {philosopher}\")\n    \n    # To satisfy the request for an equation with numbers, we can create a\n    # symbolic representation: 1 philosopher + 2 concepts = 3 total terms.\n    num_philosophers = 1\n    num_concepts = 2\n    total_terms = 3\n\n    # Print the explanation and the equation.\n    print(\"\\n---\")\n    print(\"To satisfy the formatting requirements, here is a symbolic equation:\")\n    print(f\"({num_philosophers}) philosopher + ({num_concepts}) sub-concepts = ({total_terms}) key terms in the analysis.\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {num_philosophers} + {num_concepts} = {total_terms}\")\n    \n    # As requested, here is each number from the final equation.\n    print(\"\\nThe numbers from the equation are:\")\n    print(num_philosophers)\n    print(num_concepts)\n    print(total_terms)\n\nsolve_philosophy_question()\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
