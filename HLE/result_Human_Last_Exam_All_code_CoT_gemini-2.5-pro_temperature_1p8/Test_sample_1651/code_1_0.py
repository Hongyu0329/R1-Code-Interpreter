def solve_fixed_point_problem():
    """
    Solves the problem about the fixed points of the Stone-Cech lift of a function.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible nonzero number of fixed points of the
    Stone-Cech lift F of a continuous function f: R -> R in the Stone-Cech remainder.

    1.  The set of fixed points of F in the remainder is determined by the asymptotic
        behavior of |f(x) - x|.
    2.  Topological results on the Stone-Cech compactification of R imply that if
        this set of fixed points is non-empty, its cardinality is infinite (2^c).
    3.  This suggests the question "what is the number" refers not to cardinality
        but to another topological invariant, most likely the number of
        connected components.
    4.  We seek to find the minimum nonzero number of connected components of the
        fixed point set.
    5.  A function like f(x) = x + exp(-x) results in a fixed point set in the
        remainder that is homeomorphic to the remainder of the half-line [0, infinity).
    6.  The remainder of a connected space like [0, infinity) is connected.
        Therefore, this function yields a fixed point set with exactly one
        connected component.
    7.  Since a non-zero number is requested, 1 is the smallest possibility.

    We can also construct a function yielding two connected components, e.g., an
    even function like f(x) = x + 1/(1+x^2), whose fixed point set would be the
    union of the remainders of the positive and negative half-lines, which are
    disconnected from each other.

    Thus, the smallest possible nonzero number of connected components is 1.
