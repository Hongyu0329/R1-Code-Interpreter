    "To solve this problem, we need to find the steady-state solution of the given system of differential equations. The steady-state probabilities, denoted as $P_{i}(+\\infty) = p_i$, are constant, which means their time derivatives are zero, i.e., $P_{i}'(t) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n1.  **Correct the System Equations:** There is a likely typo in the provided equation for $P_1'(t)$. For the total probability to be conserved (i.e., $\\sum P_i'(t) = 0$), the term involving $P_0(t)$ in the equation for $P_1'(t)$ should be positive. A transition from state 0 to state 1 must increase $P_1$. The original system gives $\\sum P_i'(t) = -2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$, which would incorrectly imply $P_0(t)=0$ at all times for the sum to be zero. We will proceed with the corrected equation:\n    $P_{1}'(t) = \\mathbf{+}\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$.\n\n2.  **Set up Steady-State Equations:** By setting all derivatives $P_{i}'(t)$ to zero, we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations for the steady-state probabilities $p_i$:\n    *   $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1} \\implies \\lambda_{01}p_{0} = \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_{2} \\implies (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_{2} = \\lambda_{12}p_{1}$\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3} \\implies \\lambda_{31}p_{3} = \\lambda_{23}p_{2}$\n    *   And the normalization condition: $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\n3.  **Solve for Probabilities:** We will express $p_0$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ in terms of $p_1$ using the equations from step 2.\n    *   $p_0 = \\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}} p_1$\n    *   $p_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} p_1$\n    *   $p_3 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} p_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} p_1 \\right)$\n\n4.  **Substitute and Normalize:** Substitute these expressions into the normalization equation to solve for $p_1$. Then, calculate $p_0$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Sum:** Compute the required value $p_0 + p_1$. The Python code below will execute these calculations and print the final equation with the numerical values.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_steady_state_probabilities():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves for the steady-state probabilities p0 and p1\n    and computes their sum based on the provided lambda values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given lambda values\n    l01 = 0.019\n    l10 = 0.65\n    l12 = 0.4\n    l21 = 0.392\n    l23 = 0.008\n    l31 = 0.008\n\n    # We express p0, p2, p3 in terms of p1.
