    "Here is a step-by-step plan to address your question.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Philosophical Question:** First, I will explain Gareth Evans's Generality Constraint. It posits that thoughts are structured and that if someone can think a specific thought (e.g., \"Socrates is mortal\"), they must possess the conceptual components that can be recombined to form other related thoughts (e.g., \"Plato is mortal\").\n2.  **Apply to the Scenario:** I will apply this constraint to your specific question. Understanding `Fa` (\"Socrates is mortal\") means you possess the predicate concept `F` (\"...is mortal\"). Your question assumes you also understand universal quantification (`∀x`, \"for all x...\"). The Generality Constraint implies that if you have these two conceptual building blocks (`F` and `∀x`), you should be able to combine them to understand the proposition `∀x Fx` (\"For all x, x is mortal\"). Therefore, the answer is yes.\n3.  **Create a Python Analogy:** To provide a code-based illustration, I will write a Python script that models this logic.\n    *   The script will define a set of entities (our \"universe of discourse,\" represented by numbers).\n    *   It will define a predicate `F` as a function (e.g., `is_even`).\n    *   It will first demonstrate understanding `Fa` by picking a specific entity `a` and applying the predicate to it, printing the \"equation\" and the result (e.g., `F(4): 4 % 2 == 0 -> True`).\n    *   It will then demonstrate understanding `∀x Fx` by iterating through *all* entities in the universe, applying the predicate to each one, and printing each step of the verification. This mimics the cognitive step of moving from a single instance to a universal claim.\n    *   Finally, it will conclude whether the universal proposition `∀x Fx` is true for the given universe and predicate. This satisfies the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\" by showing the evaluation for each number.\n\n```python\ndef demonstrate_generality_constraint():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script illustrates the Generality Constraint by modeling the\n    relationship between understanding a specific proposition (Fa) and a\n    general one (∀x Fx).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Let's define our universe of discourse, U.
