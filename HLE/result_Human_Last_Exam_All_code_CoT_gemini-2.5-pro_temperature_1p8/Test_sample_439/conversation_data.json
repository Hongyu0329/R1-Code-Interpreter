    "The function K(n), a form of Kolmogorov Complexity, is not computable.\n\nThe reasoning hinges on whether the programming language P is Turing-complete.\n\n1.  **Strict Interpretation (P is *not* Turing-complete)**: If the language P can *only* express primitive recursive functions, then every program written in P is guaranteed to halt. In this specific case, K(n) would be computable. You could compute it by systematically generating all P-programs in increasing order of length (all programs of length 1, then length 2, etc.), running them (which is safe since they all halt), and stopping when you find the first one that outputs `n`.\n\n2.  **Standard Interpretation (P is Turing-complete)**: Usually, questions about program complexity assume a general-purpose, Turing-complete language (like Python, C++, etc.). In this standard and much more powerful context, K(n) is famously **not computable**. Its non-computability is deeply connected to the Halting Problem.\n\nWe can demonstrate this with a proof by contradiction. Let's assume K(n) *is* computable. This means we could write a function, `compute_K(n)`, that calculates it. If such a function existed, we could write a paradoxical program like the one below.\n\nThis conceptual program uses our hypothetical `compute_K` to find the first integer `n` that has a complexity greater than a very large number (e.g., 1,000,000). The program itself, however, is very short. This creates a contradiction: a short program is found that outputs a number defined as having a very long shortest program. Since this leads to a logical impossibility, our initial assumption must be wrong.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this contradiction. This code is for illustrative purposes and cannot be run because the function `compute_K` is impossible to create.\n\n```python\ndef paradoxical_program():\n    \"\"\"\n    A conceptual program to prove K(n) is not computable.\n    This demonstrates a logical contradiction that arises if we assume K(n)\n    can be calculated.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # This is a HYPOTHETICAL and IMPOSSIBLE function.\n    # We assume it exists for the sake of contradiction.\n    def compute_K(n: int) -> int:\n        # It would return the length of the shortest program that outputs n.\n        # No actual implementation is possible.\n        pass\n\n    # Let's set a complexity threshold far greater than the length of this program.\n    # This program's text is short, so its compiled length will be small.\n    # Let's estimate its length is around 500 bytes.\n    THIS_PROGRAM_LENGTH = 500\n    # We'll search for a number that supposedly requires a program longer than this threshold.\n    COMPLEXITY_THRESHOLD = 1_000_000\n\n    print(f\"This program will now search for the first integer 'n' where K(n) > {COMPLEXITY_THRESHOLD}...\")\n\n    # The paradoxical search\n    found_number = 0\n    n = 0\n    while True:\n        # Assume we can call our magical function.\n        # In reality, this loop would never halt reliably because of the Halting Problem.\n        k_of_n = compute_K(n)\n\n        if k_of_n > COMPLEXITY_THRESHOLD:\n            found_number = n\n            break  # We found our \"highly complex\" number\n        n += 1\n\n    print(f\"\\nParadox discovered!\")\n    print(f\"The first number found with K(n) > {COMPLEXITY_THRESHOLD} is: {found_number}\")\n\n    # Here is the contradiction:\n    # 1.
