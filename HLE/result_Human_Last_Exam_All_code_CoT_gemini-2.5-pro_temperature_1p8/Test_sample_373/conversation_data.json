    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph Structure:** A barbell graph with 10 nodes is composed of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each, connected by a single edge. This connecting edge is the \"bottleneck edge\".\n2.  **Define the Gossiping Process:** Randomized uniform gossiping involves two steps:\n    *   First, a node is selected uniformly at random from all 10 nodes.\n    *   Second, the selected node chooses one of its neighbors uniformly at random to gossip with. The edge between them is the \"sampled edge\".\n3.  **Identify How to Sample the Bottleneck:** The bottleneck edge can only be sampled if one of the two nodes it connects is chosen in the first step. Let's call these two nodes `u` and `v`.\n4.  **Calculate the Degree of Bottleneck Nodes:** A bottleneck node (e.g., `u`) is connected to the other 4 nodes in its own clique and to the other bottleneck node (`v`). Therefore, its degree is `(5 - 1) + 1 = 5`.\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:** The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of two mutually exclusive events:\n    *   **Event A:** Node `u` is selected, and it chooses to gossip with `v`.\n    *   **Event B:** Node `v` is selected, and it chooses to gossip with `u`.\n    *   P(Event A) = P(select `u`) * P(`u` chooses `v`) = (1/10) * (1/degree of `u`) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n    *   P(Event B) = P(select `v`) * P(`v` chooses `u`) = (1/10) * (1/degree of `v`) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n    *   The total probability is P(A) + P(B) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25.\n6.  **Implement in Python:** Write a script that defines the parameters, performs the calculation, and prints the final equation and the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_bottleneck_gossip_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    barbell graph with 10 nodes during randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters of the barbell graph\n    total_nodes = 10\n    num_cliques = 2\n    nodes_per_clique = total_nodes // num_cliques\n\n    # Calculate the degree of one of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n    # Each bottleneck node is connected to (nodes_per_clique - 1) nodes\n    # in its own clique, plus the other bottleneck node.\n    degree_of_bottleneck_node = (nodes_per_clique - 1) + 1\n\n    # In uniform gossiping, any node is chosen with probability 1 / total_nodes.\n    prob_selecting_a_node = f\"1/{total_nodes}\"\n\n    # Given a bottleneck node is chosen, the probability of it selecting the\n    # other bottleneck node (its neighbor across the bridge) is 1 / its degree.\n    prob_node_chooses_bottleneck_neighbor = f\"1/{degree_of_bottleneck_node}\"\n\n    # The total probability is the sum of two scenarios:\n    # 1. First bottleneck node is chosen AND it selects the second.\n    # 2. Second bottleneck node is chosen AND it selects the first.\n    # P = P(select node u) * P(u selects v) + P(select node v) * P(v selects u)\n    prob_scenario_1 = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_of_bottleneck_node)\n    prob_scenario_2 = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_of_bottleneck_node)\n    total_probability = prob_scenario_1 + prob_scenario_2\n\n    print(\"The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(\"P = P(select first bottleneck node) * P(it chooses the bottleneck edge) + P(select second bottleneck node) * P(it chooses the bottleneck edge)\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"P = ({prob_selecting_a_node}) * ({prob_node_chooses_bottleneck_neighbor}) + ({prob_selecting_a_node}) * ({prob_node_chooses_bottleneck_neighbor})\")\n    print(f\"P = {prob_scenario_1} + {prob_scenario_2}\")\n    print(f\"P = {total_probability}\")\n\n\ncalculate_bottleneck_gossip_probability()\n```\n<<<0.04>>>"
