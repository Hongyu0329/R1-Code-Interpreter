    "Here is a plan to identify the modern Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n1.  Identify the historical event: I will research the military campaigns of Ming General Mu Sheng in Vietnam, specifically focusing on the Lam Sơn uprising led by Lê Lợi.\n2.  Pinpoint the specific battle: I will look for the first significant battle where Mu Sheng's forces were defeated by the Vietnamese rebels. This battle is commonly identified as the ambush at Lạc Thủy Pass (also known as Khả Lưu Pass).\n3.  Locate the modern-day equivalent: I will determine the current Vietnamese province that corresponds to the historical location of Lạc Thủy Pass. Historical maps and records place this event in the region of what is now Nghệ An Province.\n4.  Generate the code: I will write a simple Python script to print this information in a clear sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_defeat_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the modern-day Vietnamese province\n    related to a specific historical event.\n    \"\"\"\n    general = \"Ming General Mu Sheng\"\n    event = \"first major defeat\"\n    historical_location = \"Lạc Thủy Pass\"\n    modern_province = \"Nghệ An Province\"\n\n    print(f\"The current Vietnamese province where {general} experienced his {event} is {modern_province}.\")\n    print(f\"This defeat occurred during an ambush at {historical_location}.\")\n\nfind_defeat_location()\n```\n<<<Nghệ An Province>>>"
