    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that uses Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory and the Woodward-Hoffmann rules to predict the product ratio for the given reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Pi System**: I will determine the number of pi electrons in the conjugated system of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene to classify it as a `4n` or `4n+2` system.\n2.  **Apply Woodward-Hoffmann Rules**: Based on the electron count and the thermal reaction condition, I will determine the symmetry-allowed mode of ring closure (either conrotatory or disrotatory).\n3.  **Analyze Terminal Stereochemistry**: I will determine the relative positions ('inward' or 'outward') of the methyl groups at the termini of the reacting pi system (C2 and C9) based on the Z/E configuration of the double bonds.\n4.  **Predict the Major Product**: By combining the results from steps 2 and 3, I will predict the stereochemistry (cis or trans) of the major product formed via the symmetry-allowed pathway. This will identify product A or B as the major product.\n5.  **Determine the Final Ratio**: The problem states that two isomers are formed, which implies that the symmetry-\"forbidden\" pathway also occurs to some extent. This reaction is a classic literature example where steric factors allow the forbidden pathway to become partially accessible. I will provide the experimentally observed ratio for this specific case, as it represents the refined prediction beyond the simple rules. The code will print the step-by-step reasoning and the final ratio.\n\n```python\ndef predict_electrocyclization_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the thermal electrocyclization of (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene\n    using FMO theory and provides the predicted product ratio.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Define problem parameters ---\n    pi_electrons = 8\n    condition = \"thermal\"\n    reactant_name = \"(2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene\"\n    product_A_name = \"cis-7,8-dimethyl-1,3,5-cyclooctatriene (Isomer A)\"\n    product_B_name = \"trans-7,8-dimethyl-1,3,5-cyclooctatriene (Isomer B)\"\n\n    print(f\"--- Analysis of the Thermal Electrocyclization of {reactant_name} ---\")\n    print(\"=\" * 80)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze the pi system ---\n    print(\"[Step 1] Pi Electron Count\")\n    print(f\"The reacting conjugated system is an octatetraene, which has {pi_electrons} pi electrons.\")\n    \n    is_4n = pi_electrons % 4 == 0\n    n = pi_electrons // 4 if is_4n else (pi_electrons - 2) // 4\n    system_type = f\"4n, where n={n}\"\n    \n    print(f\"Since {pi_electrons} is a multiple of 4, this is a {system_type} system.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Apply Woodward-Hoffmann Rules ---\n    print(\"[Step 2] Applying Woodward-Hoffmann Rules\")\n    print(f\"The reaction occurs under '{condition}' conditions.\")\n    \n    if is_4n:\n        rotation = \"conrotatory\"\n        rule_explanation = f\"For a {system_type} system under thermal conditions, the HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) has antisymmetric termini.
