    "Of course. Here is my plan to find the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus.\n\n1.  First, I will compile a list of the key historical mountains that are mentioned in the Iliad.\n2.  Next, I will find the modern-day elevations of these mountains in meters. The main contenders are Mount Olympus itself, Mount Ida (the one near Troy, now Kaz Dağı in Turkey), Mount Athos, and Mount Samothrace (now Fengari).\n3.  I will store these mountains and their elevations in a Python dictionary.\n4.  Then, I will write a Python script that removes Mount Olympus from consideration.\n5.  Finally, the script will sort the remaining mountains by their elevation to find the tallest and print the final comparison, showing the name and height of each mountain.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain_iliad():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad,\n    excluding Mount Olympus, and prints a comparison.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: A dictionary of historical mountains from the Iliad and their elevations in meters.\n    mountains_in_iliad = {\n        \"Mount Olympus\": 2918,\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Ida (Turkey)\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Samothrace (Fengari)\": 1611\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Mountains mentioned in the Iliad by height ---\")\n    print(f\"The highest peak is Mount Olympus at {mountains_in_iliad['Mount Olympus']} meters.\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Remove Mount Olympus to find the next tallest.\n    mountains_without_olympus = {name: height for name, height in mountains_in_iliad.items() if name != \"Mount Olympus\"}\n\n    # Step 4: Sort the remaining mountains by height in descending order.\n    # The key=lambda item: item[1] tells sorted() to use the second value of each item (the height) for sorting.\n    sorted_mountains = sorted(mountains_without_olympus.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    print(\"\\nComparing the other historical mountains:\")\n    \n    # Step 5: Construct and print the final equation/comparison.\n    # This loop prints each mountain and its height.\n    # The `>` character is added between them to form a visual equation.\n    equation_parts = []\n    for name, height in sorted_mountains:\n        equation_parts.append(f\"{name} ({height}m)\")\n    \n    final_equation = \" > \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(\"Final Equation: \" + final_equation)\n    \n    # Identify and state the tallest mountain from the remaining list.\n    if sorted_mountains:\n        tallest_mountain = sorted_mountains[0]\n        print(f\"\\nAfter Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain is {tallest_mountain[0]}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nNo other mountains to compare.\")\n\nfind_tallest_mountain_iliad()\n```\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
