# Given parameters
# w13 is extremely large, indicating an asymptotic analysis.
w13 = 1e400 
w12 = 1e5
k = 1000

# Calculate tanh(1)
tanh_1 = math.tanh(1)

# Calculate the numerator and denominator of the corrected ratio tanh(c2)/tanh(c1)
# ratio = (w12 * tanh(1)) / (2 + w13 * tanh(1))
numerator = w12 * tanh_1
denominator = 2 + w13 * tanh_1

# Because w13 is so large, the ratio is effectively 0.
# We calculate it for demonstration.
ratio = numerator / denominator

# Calculate the final result based on the corrected expression
# result = k * (ratio - 1)^2
result = k * (ratio - 1)**2

# --- Output as requested ---
# The instruction is to output each number in the final equation.
# Here we do so for the corrected problem that yields a sensible answer.
