def solve():
    """
    This function addresses the mathematical problem posed.
    The number of accumulation points is a transfinite cardinal, not a simple integer.
    The reasoning, as outlined in the thought process, leads to the conclusion
    that the number of accumulation points is always 2 to the power of 2 to the power of aleph_null.
    The smallest possible value is therefore this number itself.

    The problem asks for code that prints the numbers in the final equation.
    The equation for the cardinality is |U'| = 2**(2**aleph_0).
    The integers appearing in this expression are 2, 2, and 0.
