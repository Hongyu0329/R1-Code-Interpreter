# The problem is to determine the maximal entropy H(x,y,z,s1,s2) subject to a set of constraints.

# Step 1: Simplify the objective function.
# As shown in the detailed analysis, the given constraints imply that x, y, and z are all
# functions of s1 and s2.
# H(z | s2, s1) = 0
# H(x | s1, y) = 0 and H(y | x, s2) = 0 ==> H(x|s1,s2) = 0 and H(y|s1,s2) = 0
# The joint entropy H(x,y,z,s1,s2) can be expanded using the chain rule. Each conditional
# entropy term becomes zero due to these functional dependencies, simplifying the expression to:
# H(x,y,z,s1,s2) = H(s1,s2)

# Step 2: Maximize the simplified expression H(s1,s2).
# The entropy of a joint distribution is bounded by the sum of the individual entropies:
# H(s1,s2) <= H(s1) + H(s2)

# From the problem constraints, we have the following upper bounds for H(s1) and H(s2):
H_s1_max = 1
H_s2_max = 1

# The maximum value for H(s1,s2) is achieved when s1 and s2 are independent,
# which allows us to sum their maximum individual entropies.
H_s1_s2_max = H_s1_max + H_s2_max

# Step 3: Print the final calculation and the result.
# The following lines format the final steps of the derivation as an equation.
print("The joint entropy simplifies based on the constraints to:")
print("H(x,y,z,s1,s2) = H(s1, s2)")
print("\nThe maximum value of H(s1, s2) is constrained by the individual entropies:")
print(f"H(s1, s2) <= H(s1) + H(s2) <= {H_s1_max} + {H_s2_max} = {H_s1_s2_max}")

# This maximum is shown to be achievable, for instance, with s1 and s2 as independent fair coin flips.
maximal_entropy = H_s1_s2_max
print(f"\nThus, the maximal entropy H(x,y,z,s1,s2) is {maximal_entropy}.")
