    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ consists of a pair of order-preserving maps, the left adjoint $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and the right adjoint $g: [n] \\to [m]$, satisfying the condition $f(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le g(j)$ for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$.\n\nThis condition turns out to be equivalent to two simpler properties of the maps $f$ and $g$:\n1.  The left adjoint $f: [m] \\to [n]$ must be an order-preserving map that preserves the bottom element, i.e., $f(0)=0$.\n2.  The right adjoint $g: [n] \\to [m]$ must be an order-preserving map that preserves the top element, i.e., $g(n)=m$.\n\nFurthermore, a map $f$ with the property $f(0)=0$ uniquely determines a corresponding right adjoint $g$, and conversely, a map $g$ with the property $g(n)=m$ uniquely determines a left adjoint $f$. This means the number of adjunctions is equal to the number of such maps $f$ (or, equivalently, the number of such maps $g$).\n\nLet's count the number of order-preserving maps $f: [23] \\to [37]$ with $f(0)=0$.\nHere, $m=23$ and $n=37$. An order-preserving map $f: [23] \\to [37]$ is defined by a sequence of values $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ such that $f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23)$, and each $f(i)$ is in $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThe condition $f(0)=0$ fixes the first value. So, we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ of length 23, where each value is chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem known as \"combinations with repetition\" or \"stars and bars\". We are choosing $k=m=23$ values (for $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$) from a set of $n+1=38$ possible integers ($\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$) with replacement. The number of ways to do this is given by the formula for multiset coefficients, which is a binomial coefficient:\n$$ \\binom{(n+1) + m - 1}{m} = \\binom{n+m}{m} $$\nIn our case, $m=23$ and $n=37$. Plugging these into the formula, we get:\n$$ \\binom{37+23}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to find the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category\n# from [m] to [n].\nm = 23\nn = 37\n\n# This number is equivalent to the number of order-preserving maps f: [m] -> [n]\n# with f(0) = 0. This is a classic \"stars and bars\" combinatorial problem.\n# The formula is C(n + m, m), which corresponds to choosing m items from n+1\n# options with repetition.\n\n# The numbers in the final binomial coefficient C(N, K) are:\nN = n + m\nK = m\n\n# Calculate the binomial coefficient C(N, K)\nresult = math.comb(N, K)\n\n# As requested, we show how the original numbers m and n form the final equation.\nprint(f\"The number of adjunctions from [{m}] to [{n}] is given by the binomial coefficient C({n} + {m}, {m}).\")\nprint(f\"This evaluates to C({N}, {K}).\")\nprint(f\"C({N}, {K}) = {result}\")\n```\n<<<113333364402636800>>>"
