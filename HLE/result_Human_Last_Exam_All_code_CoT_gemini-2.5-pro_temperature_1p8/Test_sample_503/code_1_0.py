# The problem is to find the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category
# from [m] to [n].
m = 23
n = 37

# This number is equivalent to the number of order-preserving maps f: [m] -> [n]
# with f(0) = 0. This is a classic "stars and bars" combinatorial problem.
# The formula is C(n + m, m), which corresponds to choosing m items from n+1
# options with repetition.

# The numbers in the final binomial coefficient C(N, K) are:
N = n + m
K = m

# Calculate the binomial coefficient C(N, K)
result = math.comb(N, K)

# As requested, we show how the original numbers m and n form the final equation.
