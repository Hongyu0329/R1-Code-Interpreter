    "To solve this problem, we will use the method of pole placement by comparing the characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system with a desired characteristic polynomial.\n\n**Our Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define the System:** We are given matrices `A` and `B`. The closed-loop system matrix is `A_cl = A + BF`, where `F` is the 2x2 state feedback gain matrix we need to find.\n    Let `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`.\n\n2.  **Desired Characteristic Polynomial:** The desired eigenvalues are `p1 = -1 + j` and `p2 = -1 - j`. The desired characteristic polynomial is `(s - p1)(s - p2) = (s - (-1+j))(s - (-1-j)) = s^2 + 2s + 2`.\n\n3.  **Actual Characteristic Polynomial:** For a 2x2 matrix `M`, the characteristic polynomial is `s^2 - trace(M)s + det(M)`. We will calculate `A_cl = A + BF` and find its trace and determinant in terms of `f1, f2, f3, f4`.\n\n4.  **Equate Coefficients:** By comparing the coefficients of the actual and desired polynomials, we get a system of two linear equations with the four unknown elements of `F`.\n\n    *   `trace(A + BF) = -2`\n    *   `det(A + BF) = 2`\n\n5.  **Solve for F:** Since we have more unknowns (4) than equations (2), there are infinite solutions. We can find one particular solution by setting two of the unknowns to zero (e.g., `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`). This simplifies the system, allowing us to solve for `f1` and `f2`.\n\n6.  **Verify the Solution:** We will plug the calculated `F` back into `A + BF` and compute the eigenvalues of the resulting closed-loop matrix to confirm they match the desired poles.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the system matrices A and B\nA = np.array([[-1, 1], [1, 0]])\nB = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 0]])\n\n# Step 2: Define the desired eigenvalues and find the desired characteristic polynomial\n# Desired eigenvalues are p = -1 +/- j\n# Desired characteristic polynomial is (s - (-1+j))(s - (-1-j)) = s^2 + 2s + 2\n# From the polynomial, the desired trace is -2 and the desired determinant is 2.\ndesired_trace = -2\ndesired_det = 2\nprint(\"Pole Placement Problem\\n\")\nprint(f\"A = \\n{A}\\n\")\nprint(f\"B = \\n{B}\\n\")\nprint(f\"Desired eigenvalues: -1 + 1j, -1 - 1j\")\nprint(f\"Desired characteristic polynomial: s^2 + 2s + 2\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3 & 4: Set up the equations for the elements of F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]\n# The characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system A_cl = A + BF is:\n# s^2 - trace(A+BF)s + det(A+BF)\n# Equating coefficients with the desired polynomial gives:\n# 1) trace(A+BF) = -2\n# 2) det(A+BF) = 2\n#\n# trace(A+BF) = trace(A) + trace(BF) = (-1+0) + trace([[f1+2*f3, f2+2*f4], [f1, f2]])\n# -1 + f1 + 2*f3 + f2 = -2  =>  f1 + f2 + 2*f3 = -1  (Equation 1)\n#\n# This gives a system of 2 equations and 4 unknowns.
