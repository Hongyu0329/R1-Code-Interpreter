    "My plan is to deduce the identity of the person described using the provided clues.\n\n1.  **\"a joy-discovering sailor\"**: This points to an explorer or seafarer, likely with a romantic or pioneering spirit.\n2.  **Andrei Voznesensky**: This is a key clue. Voznesensky was a famous Russian poet. He wrote the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\". This immensely popular work tells the story of the Russian explorer and nobleman Nikolai Rezanov and his romance with Concepción Argüello in Spanish California. The description fits the romanticized character of Rezanov in the opera.\n3.  **\"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"**: This indicates that the person's burial site was lost or unknown for a very long time. Nikolai Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807. His original grave was at the Voskresensky Cathedral, which was demolished by the Soviet government in the 1930s, and the location of his remains was lost.\n4.  **\"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s\"**: Spurred by the popularity of \"Juno and Avos\", there was renewed interest in finding Rezanov's grave. In the late 1980s, during Perestroika, a search located what are believed to be his remains, which were then reburied with honors.\n\nBased on these points, the man in question is Nikolai Rezanov. The following Python code will print his last name.\n\n```python\ndef find_last_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function stores and prints the last name of the historical figure\n  identified from the clues.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The quote is from a poem by Andrei Voznesensky about Nikolai Rezanov,\n  # a Russian explorer whose grave was lost and rediscovered.\n  last_name = \"Rezanov\"\n  print(last_name)\n\nfind_last_name()\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
