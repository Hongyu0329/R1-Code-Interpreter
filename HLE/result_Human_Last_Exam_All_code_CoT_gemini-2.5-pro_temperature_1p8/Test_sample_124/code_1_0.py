def find_correct_statements():
    """
    Analyzes statements about probabilistic graphical models and identifies the correct ones.

    The analysis is as follows:
    - A: False. Approximate inference algorithms (like MCMC, variational inference) are often more computationally efficient for complex graphs, though they don't guarantee exact results.
    - B: False. The junction tree algorithm's complexity is exponential in the treewidth, making it very *sensitive*, not resilient, to high treewidth.
    - C: True. The nodes of the junction tree are cliques of variables. The algorithm computes with potential tables defined over these cliques, which represent the (unnormalized) joint probability distributions of the variables within them.
    - D: False. This statement's premise ("the junction tree algorithm is resilient...") is false.
    - E: True. This is the main drawback of the junction tree algorithm. High treewidth leads to very large cliques, and the memory and computation required for their potential tables become impractical.
    - F: False. This is identical to statement D and is false for the same reason.
    - G: True. This correctly states the cause and effect. The algorithm is not resilient (effect) because it needs to use joint distributions on nodes (cliques), and these become intractably large when treewidth is high (cause).
    - H: False. The size of a clique's potential table, and thus the computational cost, grows exponentially (e.g., d^k for k variables with d states each), not linearly, with the number of variables in it.
    - I: True. As the number of variables in the largest clique (which determines treewidth) increases linearly, the computational cost grows exponentially. Therefore, efficiency diminishes exponentially.
    - J: False. The efficiency is highly dependent on the size of the largest clique.
    - L: True. This is an accurate description of an equivalent formulation of the running intersection property, often called the induced subtree property. It ensures that the portion of the junction tree relevant to any single variable is connected.

    Based on the analysis, the correct statements are C, E, G, I, and L.
