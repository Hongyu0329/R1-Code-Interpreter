    "The security of symmetric key cryptography against quantum computers is primarily threatened by Grover's algorithm. This algorithm provides a quadratic speedup on unstructured search problems, which includes brute-forcing a cryptographic key.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Classical Security:** For a symmetric key of length 'k', a classical computer would need to try, on average, 2^(k-1) keys to find the correct one. The work factor is considered to be on the order of 2^k, so the key provides 'k' bits of security.\n2.  **Quantum Threat (Grover's Algorithm):** A sufficiently powerful quantum computer could use Grover's algorithm to find the key in approximately sqrt(2^k) = 2^(k/2) operations. This effectively halves the security level of the key.\n3.  **Target Security Level:** The generally accepted standard for long-term security, even in the classical world, is 128 bits. This means a successful attack should require at least 2^128 computational steps, which is considered infeasible.\n4.  **Required Key Length for Quantum Resistance:** To maintain a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer, the key length 'k' must be large enough so that after being halved by Grover's algorithm, the remaining security is still at least 128 bits.\n    *   Equation: `Security_Level = k / 2`\n    *   We need: `k / 2 >= 128`\n    *   Solving for 'k': `k >= 128 * 2`\n    *   Result: `k >= 256`\n\nTherefore, to achieve a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer, a symmetric key must be at least 256 bits long.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and explains this requirement.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_quantum_resistant_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum symmetric key length required to be secure\n    against a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The industry standard for a minimum security level is 128 bits.\n    # This means an attacker should not be able to break the encryption\n    # with fewer than 2^128 operations.\n    target_security_level = 128\n\n    # Grover's algorithm for quantum computers provides a quadratic speedup\n    # on brute-force attacks. This means it can break a k-bit key in\n    # roughly sqrt(2^k) = 2^(k/2) operations.\n    # It effectively halves the bit-strength of the key.\n    grover_speedup_factor = 2\n\n    # To find the required key length 'k', we set the post-quantum\n    # security level equal to our target security level.\n    # k / grover_speedup_factor >= target_security_level\n    required_key_length = target_security_level * grover_speedup_factor\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the target security level for long-term data protection.\")\n    print(f\"Target Security Level = {target_security_level} bits\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Account for the threat from Grover's quantum algorithm.\")\n    print(\"Grover's algorithm effectively halves the key's security strength (divides by 2).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the required key length 'k' to meet the target security level.\")\n    print(f\"The security equation is: k / {grover_speedup_factor} >= {target_security_level}\")\n    print(f\"Solving for k: k >= {target_security_level} * {grover_speedup_factor}\")\n    print(f\"Final Required Key Length: k >= {required_key_length} bits\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Conclusion: To provide a security level of {target_security_level} bits against a quantum computer, a symmetric key needs to be at least {required_key_length} bits long.\")\n\ncalculate_quantum_resistant_key_length()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
