    This function identifies the parallel characters and birds in The Master and Margarita.
    
    1.  In Chapter 18, after his terrifying encounter with Varenukha and Hella, the financial director Rimsky is left shaken. As he waits for dawn, a house sparrow flies into his office and torments him, symbolizing a small, natural intrusion into his supernatural horror.
    2.  The parallel character in Jerusalem is Pontius Pilate. In Chapter 26, after sentencing Yeshua and suffering from a debilitating migraine, Pilate is alone on his balcony.
    3.  A barn swallow flies in and circles around him, providing a similar small, living disturbance during a moment of profound torment and isolation.
