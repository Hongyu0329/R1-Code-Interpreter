# The problem is to find the size of the smallest family of topological spaces
# that are guaranteed to be found as a subspace in any infinite topological space.
#
# The solution comes from a classification theorem in general topology.
# The classification splits based on separation axioms.

# First, there are spaces that are not T1. Ramsey-theoretic arguments
# show that any infinite space contains a subspace from one of 3 fundamental non-T1 types.
num_non_t1_types = 3
print(f"Number of fundamental non-T1 space types: {num_non_t1_types}")
# These are:
# 1. The trivial (indiscrete) topology.
# 2. The initial segment topology on N.
# 3. The final segment topology on N.

# Second, if a space does not fall into the above cases, it must contain an infinite T1 subspace.
# A further theorem states that any infinite T1 space must contain a subspace
# from one of 3 fundamental T1 types.
num_t1_types = 3
print(f"Number of fundamental T1 space types: {num_t1_types}")
# These are:
# 4. The discrete topology.
# 5. The cofinite topology.
# 6. The convergent sequence topology.

# The total number of required spaces in the family is the sum of these counts.
total_cardinality = num_non_t1_types + num_t1_types

print(f"The calculation is: {num_non_t1_types} + {num_t1_types} = {total_cardinality}")
print(f"The smallest cardinality of such a family F is {total_cardinality}.")
