    # Step 1: Explain the basis of ammonia tunneling
    print("Step 1: The nature of standard ammonia tunneling.")
    print("   - Ammonia (NH3) has a pyramid shape. The nitrogen atom can be above or below the plane of the three hydrogens.")
    print("   - A potential energy barrier separates these two configurations.")
    print("   - Quantum tunneling allows the nitrogen atom to pass through this barrier, leading to inversion.")
    print("   - This tunneling splits the ground state energy level, which is an observable phenomenon.")
    print("-" * 70)

    # Step 2: Identify the factors that govern tunneling
    print("Step 2: What physical properties determine tunneling?")
    print("   - Tunneling is a quantum effect governed by the potential energy surface and the masses of the particles involved.")
    print("   - The potential energy surface is determined by the masses and electric charges of the nuclei and electrons.")
    print("-" * 70)

    # Step 3: Compare ordinary and exotic hydrogen
    print("Step 3: Comparing ordinary vs. exotic hydrogen nuclei.")
    print("   - Ordinary Hydrogen:   Mass = m_p, Charge = +e, Nuclear Spin = 1/2 (Fermion)")
    print("   - Exotic Hydrogen:     Mass = m_p, Charge = +e, Nuclear Spin = 0   (Boson)")
    print("   - The ONLY difference is the nuclear spin.")
    print("-" * 70)

    # Step 4: Analyze the impact of the change
    print("Step 4: Evaluating the impact of changing only the nuclear spin.")
    print("   - Since the mass and charge of the hydrogen nuclei are unchanged, the potential energy surface of the molecule remains IDENTICAL.")
    print("   - The masses of all atoms are also IDENTICAL.")
    print("   - Therefore, the Schr√∂dinger equation describing the inversion motion is unchanged, and the conditions for tunneling are still met.")

    # Step 5: Discuss the consequence of spin statistics
    print("Step 5: What is the effect of the hydrogens being bosons instead of fermions?")
    print("   - The rules for combining wavefunctions change (Pauli Principle).")
    print("   - For fermions (ordinary H), the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric upon exchange of two particles.")
    print("   - For bosons (exotic H), the total wavefunction must be symmetric upon exchange of two particles.")
    print("   - This affects which rotational states are allowed to exist for a given vibrational state, thus changing the molecule's microwave spectrum.")
    print("   - However, this does NOT eliminate the tunneling itself, only modifies its spectral signature.")
