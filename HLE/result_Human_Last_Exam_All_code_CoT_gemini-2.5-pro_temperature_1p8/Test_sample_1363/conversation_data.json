    "To answer this question, I will devise a script that quantifies how much \"disregarding the technique\" is required to overturn a reverse turn in each of the listed dances.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will create a data structure, specifically a Python dictionary, to hold the dances listed in the answer choices.\n2.  For each dance, I will assign a numerical \"technique violation score\" from 1 to 10. A low score indicates that overturning a reverse turn is a common variation or is otherwise compatible with the dance's technique. A high score (specifically 10) will signify that overturning fundamentally breaks the dance's core technique, making it essentially \"impossible\" without disregarding it.\n3.  The European Tango is unique among these choices because its technique is staccato and does not use the body swing and momentum that characterize the other dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep). This lack of swing makes overturning a turn a fundamental violation. Therefore, it will receive the highest score.\n4.  The script will then identify the dance with the maximum violation score.\n5.  Finally, it will print out an \"equation\" showing all the scores being compared to find the maximum, as requested, before presenting the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_technique_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes dance techniques to determine where overturning a reverse turn\n    is considered a fundamental violation of the technique.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Assign a \"technique violation score\" to each dance.\n    # A score of 10 represents a fundamental violation, making it 'impossible'\n    # within the rules of the technique. The swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep)\n    # use overturning as a common variation, so they get lower scores.\n    # Tango's staccato, non-swinging character makes overturning a major breach of technique.\n    dance_violation_scores = {\n        \"A.
