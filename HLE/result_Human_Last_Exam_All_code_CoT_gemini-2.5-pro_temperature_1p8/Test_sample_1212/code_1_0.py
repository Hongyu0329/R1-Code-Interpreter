def solve_go_puzzle():
    """
    This function analyzes the Go puzzle and provides the solution.

    The board state is as follows:
    Black: A2, B3, B4, C2, C1
    White: B5, C3, C4, D1, D2, D5
    White to move.

    Analysis:
    The main black group to consider is the connected chain of stones {C1, C2, B3, B4}.
    For this group to live, it typically needs to make two eyes.
    The liberties (empty points adjacent to the group) are: A1, B1, B2, A3, and A4.
    These are the only candidates for White's killing move.

    1.  What if White plays at the vital point B2?
        - 1. W@B2. White has liberties at A3 and B1.
        - 2. B@A3. This puts the W@B2 stone in atari.
        - 3. W@B1. This saves the stone, forming a {B1, B2} white group.
        - 4. However, this white group now only has one liberty at A1.
        - 5. B@A1 captures the two white stones, and Black secures a solid eye at B2, ensuring the group lives.
        - Conclusion: W@B2 fails.

    2.  What if White plays at an outer liberty, like A1?
        - 1. W@A1. This reduces Black's liberties from the outside.
        - 2. Black's best response is to play at the vital point B2 to try to make an eye (B@B2).
        - 3. White continues to reduce the outer liberties by playing W@B1.
        - 4. Black's remaining liberties are A3 and A4. Black must play one, e.g., B@A3.
        - 5. White plays the last liberty at W@A4, and the entire black group is captured.
        - This sequence shows that W@A1 is a killing move.

    3.  By symmetry and similar analysis, playing on any of the four outer liberties
        (A1, B1, A3, A4) initiates a guaranteed kill sequence.

    Therefore, the valid killing moves for White are A1, B1, A3, and A4.
