    print("A. Mitotic recombination: This is a mechanism that can create patches of homozygous cells from a heterozygous parent cell without changing the chromosome count. This leads to CN-LOH. This is a strong candidate.")
    
    print("B. Deletion: This causes LOH but also reduces the copy number from 2 to 1. This is NOT copy-neutral.")

    print("C. Trisomy: This means having 3 copies of a chromosome. This is a copy number GAIN, not neutral.")

    print("D. Uniparental disomy (UPD): This is the inheritance of two copies of a chromosome from one parent. When this happens in a tumor (acquired UPD), it often means an entire chromosome becomes homozygous while the copy number remains two (disomy). This is the quintessential example of CN-LOH.")

    print("E. Duplication: This is a copy number GAIN, not neutral.")

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("Both (A) Mitotic Recombination and (D) Uniparental Disomy are related to CN-LOH. However, Mitotic Recombination is a *process* that can lead to CN-LOH. Uniparental Disomy is the *resulting state* that is fundamentally defined by having two copies (copy-neutral) from a single parental line (which causes LOH). Therefore, Uniparental Disomy is the most direct and accurate answer describing the genetic alteration.")
