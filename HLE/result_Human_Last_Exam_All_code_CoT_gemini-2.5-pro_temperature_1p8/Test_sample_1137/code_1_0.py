    # Step 1: Evaluate jurisdiction based on location of parties and properties.
    # All parties, principals, and properties are in Ontario.
    # This eliminates the Federal Court of Canada (E).
    print("1. The dispute is entirely within Ontario, so it falls under provincial jurisdiction. The Federal Court is not an option.")

    # Step 2: Evaluate the level of court.
    # Litigation starts in a trial court, not an appellate court.
    # This eliminates the Ontario Court of Appeal (A).
    print("2. A claim must start in a trial court, not an appellate court. The Ontario Court of Appeal is not an option for starting a lawsuit.")

    # Step 3: Evaluate the monetary value of the claim.
    # The dispute involves six large commercial properties.
    # This eliminates the Small Claims Court (D) due to its monetary limit.
    print("3. The claim involves six large properties, meaning its value is far above the Small Claims Court's monetary limit.")

    # Step 4: Compare the remaining options based on the case's nature and the need for speed.
    # The case is a complex commercial matter, and the client wants a fast resolution.
    # The Commercial List (B) is a specialized part of the Superior Court (C)
    # designed for fast and expert handling of complex commercial cases.
