The most likely reason a functional MRI coil shows no resonance is that its active detuning circuit defaults to a "detuned" (non-resonant) state when it is unpowered to protect the coil's sensitive components. Other contributing factors can be a very low unloaded Q-factor or poor magnetic coupling between your probe and the coil's specific geometry.
