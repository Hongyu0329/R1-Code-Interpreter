    # 1. Define the problem parameters
    N = 1000  # Total number of loop iterations
    P = 16    # Number of parallel execution units

    # 2. Analyze the operations within a single iteration.
    # The C code is:
    # t1 = p[i];
    # t2 = t1 * 3 + 2;
    # q[i] = t2;
    # This translates to four dependent operations (assuming single-cycle latency):
    # Op1: load  (t1 = p[i])
    # Op2: mul   (t1 * 3)
    # Op3: add   (result of mul + 2)
    # Op4: store (q[i] = t2)
    # Because of the dependencies (Op2 needs result of Op1, etc.), a single
    # iteration forms a pipeline of 4 stages.
    D = 4     # Depth of the dependency chain (cycles per iteration if run alone)

    # 3. Formulate a schedule using batch processing.
    # We can process the iterations in batches, where each batch has up to P iterations.
    # We can execute one stage for all iterations in a batch in a single cycle.
    # For example, for a batch of 16 iterations:
    # Cycle 1: Execute all 16 'load' operations.
    # Cycle 2: Execute all 16 'mul' operations.
    # Cycle 3: Execute all 16 'add' operations.
    # Cycle 4: Execute all 16 'store' operations.
    # Thus, each batch takes D cycles.

    # 4. Calculate the total cycles.
    # First, find the number of batches needed. This is the total number of
    # iterations divided by the number of parallel units, rounded up.
    num_batches = math.ceil(N / P)
    
    # Each batch takes D cycles to process.
    cycles_per_batch = D

    # The total time is the number of batches multiplied by the cycles per batch.
    total_cycles = num_batches * cycles_per_batch

    # --- Output the reasoning and final equation ---
    print(f"Total number of iterations (N): {N}")
    print(f"Number of parallel units (P): {P}")
    print(f"Dependent operations per iteration (D): {D}\n")
    print("The strategy is to process iterations in batches sized up to the number of parallel units.")
    print("First, calculate the number of batches required:")
    print(f"Number of Batches = ceil(N / P) = ceil({N} / {P}) = {num_batches}\n")
    print("Each batch must sequentially execute the 4 dependent operations, taking D cycles.")
    print(f"Cycles per Batch = {cycles_per_batch}\n")
    print("The final execution time is:")
    print(f"Total Cycles = Number of Batches * Cycles per Batch")
    print(f"{num_batches} * {cycles_per_batch} = {int(total_cycles)}")
