    "To find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for the full CI calculation of the $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ molecule with the specified basis set, I will perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Determine System Parameters:** The first step is to identify the total number of electrons in the molecule and the total number of basis functions (molecular orbitals) that result from the 6-31G** basis set.\n    *   The number of electrons is the sum of the atomic numbers of all atoms: C(6) + H(1) + H(1) + Si(14) + H(1) + F(9) = 32 electrons.\n    *   As this is a neutral, closed-shell molecule, we are interested in the singlet state (Total Spin S=0). This means there are an equal number of alpha-spin and beta-spin electrons: $N_{\\alpha} = N_{\\beta} = 32 / 2 = 16$.\n    *   The number of basis functions ($N_{orb}$) will be calculated using the `pyscf` computational chemistry library, as this is the most reliable method.\n\n2.  **Apply the Correct Formula:** For a singlet state (S=0), the number of CSFs is given by the Weyl-Paldus formula, which simplifies to:\n    $N_{CSF} = \\binom{N_{orb}}{N_{\\alpha}}^2 - \\binom{N_{orb}}{N_{\\alpha}-1} \\times \\binom{N_{orb}}{N_{\\alpha}+1}$\n    where $\\binom{n}{k}$ represents the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\".\n\n3.  **Code the Solution:** I will provide a Python script that implements these steps. The script will use `pyscf` to determine the number of orbitals, then use the `math` library to compute the binomial coefficients and the final result. The script will print out all the values used in the final equation for clarity.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Explanation:\n# This script calculates the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a\n# Full Configuration Interaction (Full CI) calculation.\n\n# We will first attempt to use the PySCF library to automatically determine the\n# number of electrons and basis functions.
