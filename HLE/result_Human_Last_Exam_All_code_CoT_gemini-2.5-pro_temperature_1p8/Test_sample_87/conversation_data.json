    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **List Given Information:** I'll start by listing the known values for the information-theoretic quantities.\n2.  **Derive Intermediate Values:** Using the chain rule for mutual information, I'll calculate related quantities like $I(X;Y,Z)$ and $I(X;Z)$.\n3.  **Establish a Key Relationship:** I'll use a standard information theory identity that connects the quantity we want to find, $I(X;Y|W)$, with the known quantities and terms involving $W$. The fact that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$ is crucial here.\n4.  **Express in Terms of Optimizable Variables:** I will manipulate the relationship to express $I(X;Y|W)$ as a function of $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;W|Y)$.\n5.  **Maximize the Expression:** I'll find the theoretical maximum and minimum values for $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;W|Y)$ using the data processing inequality. By choosing the optimal values for these terms, I can find the largest possible value for $I(X;Y|W)$.\n6.  **Calculate Final Value:** I will substitute these optimal values back into the expression to compute the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_information_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) based on the given information.\n\n    The steps are:\n    1.
