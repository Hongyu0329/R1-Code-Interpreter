    Solves for the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) based on the given information.

    The steps are:
    1. Define given values.
    2. Use the chain rule to find I(X;Y,Z) and I(X;Z).
    3. Relate I(X;Y|W) to other quantities using an information identity.
    4. Simplify the expression for I(X;Y|W).
    5. Find the bounds for the variables in the expression.
