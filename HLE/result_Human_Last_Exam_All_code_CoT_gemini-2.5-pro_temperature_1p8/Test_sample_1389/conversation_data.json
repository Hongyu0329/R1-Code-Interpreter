    "An all-or-nothing vaccine is a type of vaccine that confers complete immunity to a certain proportion of the vaccinated individuals, while providing no protection at all to the rest. The per-exposure vaccine efficacy refers to the reduction in the probability of infection per single exposure to the pathogen for a vaccinated individual compared to an unvaccinated one.\n\nTo determine the relationship between `1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)` and the per-exposure vaccine efficacy, we can set up a hypothetical scenario and calculate both quantities.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define a hypothetical scenario:** We'll create a clinical trial setting with a vaccinated group and an unvaccinated (placebo) group. We will define the true efficacy of the all-or-nothing vaccine (i.e., the percentage of people fully protected).\n2.  **Calculate Incidence Rates:** Based on a baseline infection rate (hazard rate), we'll calculate the expected number of infections and the total person-time at risk for both groups. This allows us to find the Incidence Rate for the vaccinated (`IR_v`) and unvaccinated (`IR_u`) groups.\n3.  **Calculate `1 - IRR`:** We will compute the Incidence Rate Ratio (`IRR = IR_v / IR_u`) and then calculate the vaccine efficacy as measured by `1 - IRR`.\n4.  **Calculate Per-Exposure Efficacy:** We will determine the theoretical per-exposure efficacy. For an all-or-nothing vaccine, this is the average reduction in infection risk per exposure across the entire vaccinated population (some have 100% reduction, some have 0%).\n5.  **Compare:** Finally, we will compare the result from Step 3 with the result from Step 4 to determine if `1 - IRR` overestimates, underestimates, or correctly estimates the per-exposure efficacy.\n\nThe following Python code performs this numerical demonstration.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef analyze_vaccine_efficacy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates whether 1-IRR correctly estimates per-exposure VE\n    for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define a hypothetical scenario\n    print(\"Step 1: Setting up a hypothetical scenario for an 'all-or-nothing' vaccine.\")\n    population_size = 100000  # Size of each group\n    follow_up_years = 1.0     # Follow-up time in years\n    # This is the true, underlying efficacy. 80% of vaccinated people are fully immune.\n    true_efficacy_aon = 0.80\n    # Hazard rate for unprotected individuals (infections per person-year)\n    hazard_rate = 0.05\n\n    print(f\"- Population per group: {population_size}\")\n    print(f\"- True All-or-Nothing Efficacy (VE_AON): {true_efficacy_aon:.2f} ({true_efficacy_aon:.0%})\")\n    print(f\"- Infection rate for unprotected individuals: {hazard_rate} per person-year\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate expected outcomes and Incidence Rates (IR)\n\n    # --- Unvaccinated Group ---\n    person_years_unvaccinated = population_size * follow_up_years\n    # For unvaccinated, all are susceptible to the baseline hazard rate.\n    cases_unvaccinated = person_years_unvaccinated * hazard_rate\n    ir_unvaccinated = cases_unvaccinated / person_years_unvaccinated\n\n    # --- Vaccinated Group ---\n    person_years_vaccinated = population_size * follow_up_years\n    # In the vaccinated group, only the non-protected fraction is at risk.\n    unprotected_fraction = 1 - true_efficacy_aon\n    # Cases only occur in the fraction of the vaccinated population that is not protected.\n    cases_vaccinated = (population_size * unprotected_fraction) * follow_up_years * hazard_rate\n    ir_vaccinated = cases_vaccinated / person_years_vaccinated\n\n    print(\"Step 2 & 3: Calculate Vaccine Efficacy using the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR).\")\n    print(\"IR = Total Cases / Total Person-Time\")\n    print(f\"- Incidence Rate (Unvaccinated): {int(cases_unvaccinated)} cases / {int(person_years_unvaccinated)} person-years = {ir_unvaccinated:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"- Incidence Rate (Vaccinated):   {int(cases_vaccinated)} cases / {int(person_years_vaccinated)} person-years = {ir_vaccinated:.4f}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate VE from 1 - IRR\n    irr = ir_vaccinated / ir_unvaccinated\n    ve_from_irr = 1 - irr\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe Vaccine Efficacy calculated from the IRR is:\")\n    # The format below fulfills the requirement: \"output each number in the final equation\"\n    print(f\"VE_IRR = 1 - (IR_Vaccinated / IR_Unvaccinated)\")\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"VE_IRR = 1 - ({ir_vaccinated:.4f} / {ir_unvaccinated:.4f})\")\n    sys.stdout.flush()\n    print(f\" = 1 - {irr:.2f} = {ve_from_irr:.2f} ({ve_from_irr:.0%})\\n\")\n\n\n    # Step 4: Define and calculate the \"true\" per-exposure efficacy\n    print(\"Step 4: Calculate the true 'per-exposure' Vaccine Efficacy (VE_p).\")\n    print(\"VE_p is the average reduction in infection risk per exposure for a vaccinated person.\")\n    print(\"- For the protected fraction (80%), the risk reduction is 100%.\")\n    print(\"- For the unprotected fraction (20%), the risk reduction is 0%.\")\n    \n    # Let p be the risk per exposure for an unvaccinated person.\n    # The average risk per exposure for a vaccinated person is:\n    # (risk_for_protected * fraction_protected) + (risk_for_unprotected * fraction_unprotected)\n    # = (0 * true_efficacy_aon) + (p * (1 - true_efficacy_aon)) = p * (1 - true_efficacy_aon)\n    # The per-exposure efficacy is 1 - (avg_risk_vaccinated / risk_unvaccinated)\n    # VE_p = 1 - (p * (1 - true_efficacy_aon) / p) = 1 - (1 - true_efficacy_aon) = true_efficacy_aon\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe per-exposure efficacy is mathematically defined as:\")\n    print(\"VE_p = 1 - (Average_Risk_Vaccinated / Risk_Unvaccinated)\")\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"VE_p = 1 - (1 - VE_AON)\")\n    sys.stdout.flush()\n    print(f\" = 1 - (1 - {true_efficacy_aon:.2f}) = {true_efficacy_aon:.2f} ({true_efficacy_aon:.0%})\\n\")\n\n    # Step 5: Compare and conclude\n    print(\"Step 5: Conclusion.\")\n    print(f\"The calculated VE from rates (VE_IRR = {ve_from_irr:.2f}) is equal to the true per-exposure efficacy (VE_p = {true_efficacy_aon:.2f}).\")\n    print(\"Therefore, for an all-or-nothing vaccine, 1-IRR correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\")\n\n\nanalyze_vaccine_efficacy()\n<<<C>>>\n```"
