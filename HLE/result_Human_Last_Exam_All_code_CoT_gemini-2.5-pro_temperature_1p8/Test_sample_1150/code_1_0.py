Step 1: Deconstructing the Lojban term '{word}'.
Lojban compound words (lujvo) are formed from smaller root words (rafsi).
- 'rusy' comes from 'rusko', meaning 'Russian'.
- 'bavla' comes from 'balvi', meaning 'future'.
- 'mdei' comes from 'djedi', meaning 'full day'.

Step 2: Identifying the head word and its place structure.
In Lojban, the final component of a compound word determines its core meaning and grammatical arguments (place structure). In '{word}', the final component is 'mdei' from '{head_gismu}'.

Step 3: Defining the place structure.
The definition of '{head_gismu}' is:
"{head_gismu_place_structure}"

This means:
- x1 is the event/duration.
- x2 is the number of days the duration lasts.
- x3 is the standard by which a 'day' is measured (e.g., a calendar).

Step 4: Interpreting the arguments.
The question asks for the meaning of the second (x2) and third (x3) arguments of '{word}'. Since '{word}' is a type of '{head_gismu}', it inherits this structure.
- The second argument, x2, is 'the number of full days'.
- The third argument, x3, is 'the day standard'.

Step 5: Matching with the provided answers.
This interpretation matches the following choice:
'x2 is the number of full days corresponding to x1; x3 is the 'day standard''
