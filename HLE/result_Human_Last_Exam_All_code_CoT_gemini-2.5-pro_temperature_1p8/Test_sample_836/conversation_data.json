    "The generalized pair correlation function, which describes the statistical correlation between neutron pairs in a multiplying medium, is a fundamental concept in the study of neutron fluctuations, often called \"neutron noise analysis\".\n\nIts double Fourier transform, with respect to both space ($\\mathbf{r} \\to \\mathbf{k}$) and time ($t \\to \\omega$), is a key quantity that reveals the system's dynamic and spatial properties. This transformed function is most commonly known as the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**.\n\nIn simpler models, like the point kinetics model which neglects spatial dependency, the transform is only performed over time, resulting in a frequency-dependent PSD. This function describes how the \"power\" of the neutron noise is distributed across different frequencies. The shape of the PSD is highly sensitive to the reactivity of the system, and its measurement is a standard technique for subcriticality monitoring in nuclear reactors.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the frequency-dependent component of the PSD using the point kinetics model for a given set of reactor parameters. This component is essentially the square of the magnitude of the reactor's transfer function.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_psd_component():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the magnitude squared of the reactor transfer function,\n    which is the key frequency-dependent component of the Power Spectral Density (PSD),\n    based on the point kinetics model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Define typical reactor physics parameters ---\n\n    # Reactivity in dollars ($), where $ = rho / beta_eff.\n    # Negative value indicates a subcritical system.\n    reactivity_dollars = -0.5\n\n    # Effective delayed neutron fraction (beta_eff)\n    beta_eff = 0.0065\n\n    # Prompt neutron lifetime (Lambda) in seconds\n    prompt_neutron_lifetime_Lambda = 2e-5  # 20 microseconds\n\n    # Angular frequency (omega) in radians per second for the calculation\n    angular_frequency_omega = 150.0\n\n    # --- Calculation ---\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the Rossi-alpha (α), which is the prompt neutron decay constant.\n    # The formula is α = (β_eff - ρ) / Λ = β_eff * (1 - $) / Λ\n    # where ρ is reactivity and $ is reactivity in dollars.\n    alpha = beta_eff * (1 - reactivity_dollars) / prompt_neutron_lifetime_Lambda\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the square of the magnitude of the reactor transfer function G(ω).\n    # The PSD is proportional to |G(ω)|², and G(ω) = 1 / (α + iω).\n    # Therefore, |G(ω)|² = 1 / (α² + ω²)\n    psd_magnitude_squared = 1 / (alpha**2 + angular_frequency_omega**2)\n\n    # --- Output the results ---\n    print(\"The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is known as the Power Spectral Density (PSD).\")\n    print(\"Below, we calculate the main frequency-dependent component of the PSD using the point kinetics model, |G(ω)|² = 1 / (α² + ω²).\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Given Parameters:\")\n    print(f\"  Reactivity ($) = {reactivity_dollars}\")\n    print(f\"  Effective delayed neutron fraction (β_eff) = {beta_eff}\")\n    print(f\"  Prompt neutron lifetime (Λ) = {prompt_neutron_lifetime_Lambda} s\")\n    print(f\"  Angular frequency (ω) = {angular_frequency_omega} rad/s\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the Rossi-alpha (α)\")\n    print(\"Equation: α = β_eff * (1 - $) / Λ\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: α = {beta_eff} * (1 - ({reactivity_dollars})) / {prompt_neutron_lifetime_Lambda}\")\n    print(f\"Result: α = {alpha:.1f} s⁻¹\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Step 2: Calculate |G(ω)|² at ω = {angular_frequency_omega} rad/s\")\n    print(\"Equation: |G(ω)|² = 1 / (α² + ω²)\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: |G(ω)|² = 1 / ({alpha:.1f}² + {angular_frequency_omega}²)\")\n    print(f\"Final Result: |G(ω)|² = {psd_magnitude_squared:.4e}\\n\")\n\n\n# Run the calculation and print the output\ncalculate_psd_component()\n```\n<<<Power Spectral Density>>>"
