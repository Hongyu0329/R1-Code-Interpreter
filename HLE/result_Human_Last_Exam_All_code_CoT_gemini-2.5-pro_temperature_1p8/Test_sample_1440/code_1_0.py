# This problem is a theoretical question in topology.
# The solution requires deductive reasoning based on theorems from continuum theory,
# rather than a computational or coding approach.

# 1. We established that there must be at least 2 classes, [a] and [b],
#    because I(a,b) = X, which is not nowhere dense.
#
# 2. We partitioned the space X into three non-empty sets:
#    A_prime = {x | I(a,x) is nowhere dense}
#    B_prime = {x | I(b,x) is nowhere dense}
#    C = {x | I(a,x) and I(b,x) are both NOT nowhere dense}
#
# 3. We argued that any point z in C belongs to an equivalence class [z]
#    that is distinct from both [a] and [b]. This shows there must be at least 3 classes.
#
# 4. We cited the existence of a specially constructed dendroid X that satisfies the
#    given properties and for which the equivalence classes are precisely the sets
#    A_prime, B_prime, and C. This demonstrates that a configuration with
#    exactly 3 classes is possible.
#
# 5. Therefore, the smallest possible number of equivalence classes is 3.

smallest_number_of_classes = 3

print(f"The logic leads to the conclusion that the smallest possible number of equivalence classes is {smallest_number_of_classes}.")
# The question is mathematical, but asks for a Python block.
# So I present the final answer and a summary of the reasoning in this block.
# The equation is simply:
number_of_classes = 3
print(f"Let N be the number of classes. The smallest possible value is:")
print(f"N = {number_of_classes}")
