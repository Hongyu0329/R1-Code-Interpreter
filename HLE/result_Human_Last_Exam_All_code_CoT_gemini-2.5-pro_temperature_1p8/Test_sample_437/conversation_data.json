    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to evaluate the integral $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j\\rangle$ for a 1s Slater orbital. In quantum chemistry, this integral represents the electron-nucleus attraction energy. I will assume we are calculating the expectation value, which means the orbitals $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$ are identical ($\\phi_i = \\phi_j = \\phi_{1s}$).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Orbital:** I'll start by defining the mathematical form of a normalized 1s Slater-type orbital (STO), $\\phi_{1s}$. This involves its radial function and the normalization constant, which depends on the orbital exponent, $\\zeta$. The normalized 1s STO is given by $\\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}) = (\\zeta^3/\\pi)^{1/2} e^{-\\zeta r}$.\n2.  **Set Up the Integral:** The problem is to evaluate the integral $\\langle \\phi_{1s} | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_{1s} \\rangle$. In Dirac notation, this translates to the integral $\\int \\phi_{1s}^*(\\mathbf{r}) \\frac{1}{r} \\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}) d\\tau$ over all space.\n3.  **Solve in Spherical Coordinates:** The integral is best solved in spherical coordinates, where the volume element is $d\\tau = r^2 \\sin\\theta \\,dr \\,d\\theta \\,d\\phi$. The integral separates into simpler radial and angular parts.\n4.  **Symbolic Calculation with Python:** I will provide a Python script that uses the `sympy` library to perform the integration symbolically. The script will define the orbital and the operator, then compute the integral step-by-step, showing the results for the angular and radial components before combining them into the final result. This will satisfy the requirement to show the numbers in the final equation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the evaluation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Set up the symbols for our calculation\n# r, theta, phi are the spherical coordinates\n# zeta is the orbital exponent of the Slater orbital\nr, theta, phi = sp.symbols('r theta phi', real=True, positive=True)\nzeta = sp.symbols('zeta', real=True, positive=True)\n\n# --- Step 1: Define the 1s Slater Orbital ---\n# The normalization constant N for a 1s Slater orbital is (zeta^3 / pi)^(1/2)\nN = sp.sqrt(zeta**3 / sp.pi)\n\n# The 1s Slater orbital phi_1s = N * exp(-zeta * r)\nphi_1s = N * sp.exp(-zeta * r)\n\nprint(\"--- The Problem ---\")\nprint(f\"We are evaluating the integral <phi_1s | 1/r | phi_1s> for the orbital:\")\nprint(f\"phi_1s = {phi_1s}\\n\")\n\n\n# --- Step 2: Set up the integral ---\n# The integral is Integral(phi_1s^* * (1/r) * phi_1s * d_tau)\n# Since phi_1s is real, phi_1s^* = phi_1s.\n# The volume element d_tau in spherical coordinates is r^2 * sin(theta) dr d(theta) d(phi)\n# The operator is 1/r.\n\n# Full integrand:\nintegrand = phi_1s * (1/r) * phi_1s * r**2 * sp.sin(theta)\n\nprint(\"--- The Setup ---\")\nprint(\"The integrand in spherical coordinates is:\")\n# Using sp.pretty_print for a clearer mathematical output\nsp.pretty_print(integrand)\nprint()\n\n\n# --- Step 3: Solve the integral by separating it ---\n# The integral can be separated into angular and radial parts:\n# Integral = (N^2) * Integral_r(r * exp(-2*zeta*r) dr) * Integral_theta(sin(theta) d(theta)) * Integral_phi(d(phi))\n\n# Calculate the angular parts:\nintegral_over_phi = sp.integrate(1, (phi, 0, 2*sp.pi))\nintegral_over_theta = sp.integrate(sp.sin(theta), (theta, 0, sp.pi))\nangular_integral_result = integral_over_phi * integral_over_theta\n\nprint(\"--- Calculation Steps ---\")\nprint(f\"1.
