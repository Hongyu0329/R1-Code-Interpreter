    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Recognize the Periodicity**: The tangent function `tan(x)` is periodic with a period of π. This means that `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. The number `x = 10^100` is extremely large, so we can't use standard floating-point arithmetic.\n2.  **Use High-Precision Arithmetic**: We need to compute `10^100 mod π`. This calculation requires a library that can handle numbers with very high precision. Python's `mpmath` library is perfect for this.\n3.  **Set Sufficient Precision**: To get an accurate result for `tan(x mod π)`, we must first calculate `x mod π` with enough precision. Since `10^100` is a number with 101 digits, we need to set the precision of our calculations to more than 101 decimal places to get a few accurate digits in the remainder. A precision of 110 decimal places will be more than sufficient.\n4.  **Perform the Calculation**:\n    *   Set the precision in `mpmath`.\n    *   Calculate `y = tan(10^100)` directly using `mpmath`. The library handles the large number and the modulo operation internally.\n    *   The result will be a high-precision number.\n5.  **Extract the Digits**: From the final result, we will identify the first three digits that appear after the decimal point.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\ndef solve_tan_large_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100)\n    using high-precision arithmetic.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set the precision (dps = decimal places) to a high value.\n    # 10^100 has 101 digits. We need a precision greater than that.\n    # 110 is a safe choice for getting a few decimal places of the result accurately.\n    mpmath.mp.dps = 110\n\n    # The number in the tan function\n    exponent = 100\n    base = 10\n    x = mpmath.power(base, exponent)\n\n    # Calculate tan(10^100).\n    # mpmath handles the argument reduction (x mod pi) internally.\n    result = mpmath.tan(x)\n\n    # The final equation is tan(10^100) = result.\n    # We output all numbers involved in this equation as requested.\n    print(f\"The calculation is for tan({base}^{exponent}).\")\n    print(f\"Using high-precision math, the result is:\")\n    print(f\"tan({base}^{exponent}) = {result}\")\n\n    # To find the first 3 digits after the comma, we convert the result to a string.\n    result_str = str(result)\n    \n    # Find the position of the decimal point.\n    decimal_point_index = result_str.find('.')\n\n    # Extract the 3 digits following the decimal point.\n    if decimal_point_index != -1:\n        first_three_digits = result_str[decimal_point_index + 1 : decimal_point_index + 4]\n        print(f\"\\nThe first 3 digits after the comma are: {first_three_digits}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nCould not find a decimal point in the result.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_tan_large_number()\n\n```\n<<<742>>>"
