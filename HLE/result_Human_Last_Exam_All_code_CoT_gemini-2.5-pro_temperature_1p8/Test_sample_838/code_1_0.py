### Step-by-Step Analysis

**Reaction 1: E2 Elimination to form Product A**

*   **Starting Material:** [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene
*   **Reagents:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK)
*   **Analysis:** Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. It favors elimination (E2 reaction) over substitution. Due to its bulk, it preferentially abstracts a proton from the least sterically hindered β-carbon, which is the terminal methyl group (C4). This type of elimination is known as Hofmann elimination, yielding the least substituted alkene.
*   **Product A:** The product is **(but-3-en-1-yl)benzene**. The original stereocenter at C3 is destroyed in this step, resulting in an achiral alkene.

**Reaction 2: Hydroboration-Oxidation to form Product B**

*   **Starting Material (A):** (But-3-en-1-yl)benzene
*   **Reagents:** 1. Borane in THF (BH₃•THF) 2. Hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydroxide (H₂O₂, NaOH)
*   **Analysis:** This is a hydroboration-oxidation reaction, which adds the elements of water (H and OH) across a double bond. The reaction proceeds with anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity, meaning the hydroxyl (-OH) group adds to the less substituted carbon of the double bond (C4).
*   **Product B:** The product is the primary alcohol **4-phenylbutan-1-ol**. This molecule is achiral.

**Reaction 3: Bromination to form Product C**

*   **Starting Material (B):** 4-Phenylbutan-1-ol
*   **Reagent:** Phosphorous tribromide (PBr₃)
*   **Analysis:** Phosphorous tribromide is a classic reagent for converting primary and secondary alcohols into alkyl bromides. The reaction proceeds through an SN2 mechanism, where the -OH group is replaced by a bromine atom.
*   **Product C:** The final product is **(4-bromobutyl)benzene**.

### Final Product Identification: Product C

*   **IUPAC Name:** The final product C is **(4-bromobutyl)benzene**.
*   **Chirality:** The final product, (4-bromobutyl)benzene, is **achiral**. The initial stereocenter in the starting material was lost during the first elimination step to form product A. All subsequent intermediates and the final product are achiral, as no new stereocenters are formed during the reaction sequence.
