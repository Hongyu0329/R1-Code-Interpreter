    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this riddle using a Python script.\n\nFirst, I will research and identify several remote island towns that could be potential candidates. For each candidate, I will gather data based on the key criteria from the riddle:\n1.  Is it more than 500 km from another inhabited island?\n2.  Does it sit on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera?\n3.  Does the town share its name with the bay?\n\nNext, I will represent these candidates and their attributes as a list of data structures in a Python script. The script will then systematically iterate through each candidate and check if it satisfies all the conditions of the riddle. Finally, the script will print the name of the one candidate that matches all the specified criteria.\n\n```python\ndef find_island_town():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds a specific island town by filtering a list of candidates\n    based on a set of geographical and naming criteria.\n    \"\"\"\n    candidates = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Hanga Roa\",\n            \"island\": \"Easter Island\",\n            \"distance_to_next_inhabited_km\": 2075,\n            \"on_caldera_bay\": True, # The bay is formed by the island's volcanic geography\n            \"bay_shares_name\": True # The bay is commonly known as Hanga Roa Bay\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Edinburgh of the Seven Seas\",\n            \"island\": \"Tristan da Cunha\",\n            \"distance_to_next_inhabited_km\": 2437,\n            \"on_caldera_bay\": False, # Town is on a coastal plain, not a caldera bay\n            \"bay_shares_name\": False\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Adamstown\",\n            \"island\": \"Pitcairn Island\",\n            \"distance_to_next_inhabited_km\": 2075,\n            \"on_caldera_bay\": False,\n            \"bay_shares_name\": False\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Fira\",\n            \"island\": \"Santorini\",\n            \"distance_to_next_inhabited_km\": 20, # Very close to other Greek islands\n            \"on_caldera_bay\": True,\n            \"bay_shares_name\": False # Town is Fira, bay is the Santorini Caldera\n        }\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Searching for an island town based on the following criteria:\")\n    print(\"1.
