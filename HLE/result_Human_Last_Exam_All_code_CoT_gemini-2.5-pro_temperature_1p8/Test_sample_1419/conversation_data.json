    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step derivation followed by a Python script that presents the solution.\n\n### Derivation Steps\n\n1.  **Theory and Coupling:** We start with the `phi^4` theory near `d=4` spatial dimensions. In the Renormalization Group (RG) framework, we analyze the flow of a dimensionless coupling constant, `u`, which is related to the bare coupling `g` by `g = μ^ϵ u`, where `μ` is a momentum scale and `ϵ = 4 - d`.\n\n2.  **The Beta Function:** The change in the coupling `u` with the energy scale `μ` is described by the beta function, `β(u) = μ(du/dμ)`. For `phi^4` theory, the one-loop calculation gives:\n    `β(u) = -ϵu + (3 / (16π²))u² + O(u³)`\n    *   The `-ϵu` term arises from the classical (or engineering) scaling of the coupling constant.\n    *   The `(3 / (16π²))u²` term is the leading quantum correction from one-loop diagrams.\n\n3.  **The Fixed Point Condition:** A fixed point, denoted `u*`, represents a scale-invariant point in the theory's parameter space. At a fixed point, the coupling does not change with the energy scale, which means the beta function is zero:\n    `β(u*) = 0`\n\n4.  **Solving for the Fixed Point:** We solve the equation for `u*` using the one-loop beta function:\n    `-ϵu* + (3 / (16π²))(u*)² = 0`\n    This can be factored as:\n    `u* [ -ϵ + (3 / (16π²))u* ] = 0`\n\n    This equation provides two fixed points:\n    *   `u* = 0`: This is the trivial **Gaussian fixed point**, corresponding to a non-interacting theory.\n    *   `-ϵ + (3 / (16π²))u* = 0`: This gives the non-trivial **Wilson-Fisher fixed point**.\n\n5.  **Final Expression:** Solving the second case for `u*` gives the leading order expression in terms of `ϵ`:\n    `(3 / (16π²))u* = ϵ`\n    `u* = (16π² / 3) ϵ`\n    This result shows that for a small deviation from four dimensions (`ϵ` is small), there exists an interactive fixed point where the coupling `u*` is also small and positive, allowing for a perturbative analysis.\n\nThe following Python script will formally present this result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef display_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and displays the leading order expression for the\n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling (u*) in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script derives the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* in terms of epsilon = 4-d.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # 1.
