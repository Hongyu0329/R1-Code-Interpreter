    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this request:\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the user's question. The user is asking for the number of \"pas de Balanchines\" in a specific ballet performance.\n\nSecond, I must determine if \"pas de Balanchine\" is a standard, countable ballet step. After checking ballet terminology, I've concluded it is not a recognized or defined step. George Balanchine was a famous choreographer known for his distinct style, but he did not have a specific, countable step named after him in the way other steps are (e.g., \"pas de bourrée\").\n\nThird, because \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a defined step, it's impossible to count how many were performed. Therefore, the most logical and technically correct answer is 0.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script that reflects this conclusion. The script will assign the number 0 to a variable and then print the result in a clear statement, as requested.\n\n```python\n# The term \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a standard step in the ballet lexicon.\n# George Balanchine was a choreographer known for his style (neoclassicism),\n# but he did not have a specific, countable step named after him like a \"pas de bourrée\".\n# Therefore, based on official terminology, the number of \"pas de Balanchines\" Svetlana Gileva performed is zero.\n\npas_de_balanchines_performed = 0\n\n# Printing the final answer in a sentence, as if it were an equation.\n# The number in the final 'equation' is 0.\nprint(f\"In the Jete Woman solo scene, Svetlana Gileva performed {pas_de_balanchines_performed} pas de Balanchines.\")\n```\n<<<0>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In the Jete Woman solo scene by the Forsythe production \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" for Semperoper Ballett, 2015, how many pas de Balanchines did Svetlana Gileva perform? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
