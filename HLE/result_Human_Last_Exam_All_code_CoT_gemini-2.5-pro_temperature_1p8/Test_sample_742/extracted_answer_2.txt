No, it is not possible. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics describes the contingent physical world and its concepts (like wavefunctions and operators) have no application to the axioms of metaphysical necessity used in GÃ¶del's formal logical proof. The two systems are fundamentally incommensurable.
