    "To determine the maximum number of colours needed to properly colour the vertices of a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices that is not a complete graph, we can use established results from graph theory, particularly Brooks's Theorem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **State the relevant theorem:** Brooks's Theorem provides an upper bound for the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, of a graph in terms of its maximum degree, $\\Delta(G)$. The theorem states that for any connected graph $G$ that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$.\n2.  **Analyze the exceptions to Brooks's Theorem:**\n    *   The problem explicitly states that $G$ is **not** the complete graph $K_{12345}$. A complete graph $K_n$ would require $n$ colours.\n    *   The other exception is an odd cycle. A cycle graph on $12345$ vertices, $C_{12345}$, is an odd cycle. Its chromatic number is 3.\n3.  **Apply Brooks's Theorem to all other cases:** For any other connected graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices, we have $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$.\n4.  **Find the maximum possible value:** We want to find the maximum possible number of colours. The maximum degree of any vertex in a graph with $n$ vertices is at most $n-1$. Thus, for any graph G, $\\Delta(G) \\le n-1 = 12344$. This implies that for the cases covered by Brooks's theorem, $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n5.  **Construct a graph to show the bound is achievable:** We need to find if there exists a non-complete graph with $n=12345$ vertices that actually requires $n-1=12344$ colours. Consider the graph $G$ formed by taking the complete graph $K_{12345}$ and removing a single edge.\n    *   This graph $G$ is not a complete graph.\n    *   It contains a clique (a subgraph that is a complete graph) of size $12344$. For instance, if the removed edge was between vertices $u$ and $v$, the set of all vertices except $v$ forms a $K_{12344}$ subgraph.\n    *   Colouring a clique of size $k$ requires $k$ distinct colours. Therefore, $\\chi(G) \\ge 12344$.\n    *   Since we also know $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 12344$, we can conclude that for this graph, $\\chi(G) = 12344$.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The possible number of colours for a non-complete graph with 12345 vertices is either 3 (for an odd cycle) or at most 12344. The maximum of these possibilities is 12344. Therefore, the maximum number of colours required is $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that calculates this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colours needed for a graph with n vertices\n    that is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of vertices in the graph G\n    n = 12345\n\n    # According to Brooks's Theorem, for a graph G that is not a complete graph\n    # or an odd cycle, the chromatic number chi(G) is at most the maximum degree Delta(G).\n    # chi(G) <= Delta(G).\n\n    # For any graph with n vertices, the maximum degree is at most n-1.\n    # So, chi(G) <= Delta(G) <= n-1.\n\n    # An odd cycle graph with n vertices would require 3 colours. Since n=12345 is odd,\n    # this is a possibility, yielding 3.\n\n    # We need to find the maximum possible number of colors. To do this, we try to\n    # maximize chi(G). The upper bound is n-1. We can check if this bound is achievable.\n\n    # Consider a graph G constructed by taking a complete graph K_n and removing\n    # one edge. This graph is not complete.
