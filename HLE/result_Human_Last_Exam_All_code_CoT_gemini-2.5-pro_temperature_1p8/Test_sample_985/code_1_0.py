# Step 1: Define the automorphism group G and its character table.
# The curve is the Klein quartic. Its automorphism group G is PSL(2, 7).
# The character table of PSL(2, 7) is known. We represent it as a list of lists.
# The complex entries are a = (-1 + i*sqrt(7))/2 and b = (-1 - i*sqrt(7))/2.
a = complex(-0.5, (7**0.5) / 2)
