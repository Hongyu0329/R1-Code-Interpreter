    "Here is my plan to solve this biochemical question:\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Molecule**: Identify the molecule as glucose and note that it is specifically labeled with the 13C isotope at carbons 1 and 4.\n2.  **Analyze the Metabolic Pathway**: The question specifies the process is **glycolysis**. I will focus strictly on this pathway.\n3.  **Recall the Net Reaction of Glycolysis**: I will state the overall inputs and outputs of glycolysis to determine if CO2 is produced.\n4.  **Evaluate CO2 Production**: Based on the net reaction, I will check if any CO2 molecules are released during glycolysis.\n5.  **Formulate the Conclusion**: Since the number of 13C-labeled CO2 molecules depends on the total CO2 released, I will conclude based on the previous step. The code will print out this logical process.\n\n```python\ndef solve_glycolysis_co2():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the number of 13C-labeled CO2 molecules released when\n    1,4-13C glucose undergoes glycolysis.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the initial molecule.\")\n    print(\"The starting molecule is 1,4-13C glucose.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
