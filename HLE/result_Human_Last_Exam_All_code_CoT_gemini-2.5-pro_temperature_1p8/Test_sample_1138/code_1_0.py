    This script prints a step-by-step analysis of the properties of a digital
    signature scheme like ECDSA to answer the user's multiple-choice question.

    print("Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n")

    print("1. Clarifying the Premise:")
    print("The question starts by mentioning an 'existentially forgeable digital signature scheme (e.g. ECDSA)'.")
    print("This premise is technically incorrect. A secure signature scheme like ECDSA is designed to be 'existentially UNFORGEABLE' under chosen-message attacks (EUF-CMA). 'Existentially forgeable' would mean the scheme is broken.")
    print("We will proceed by assuming the question contains a typo and meant to ask about the properties of a secure, existentially unforgeable scheme like ECDSA.\n")

    print("2. Analyzing Option A:")
    print("  'For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can create a new, different signature sig' that is verifiable given pk with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("  - Analysis: This property is known as 'Strong Unforgeability'. It guarantees that an adversary cannot create a *different* valid signature for a message that has already been signed. ECDSA is designed to be strongly unforgeable.")
    print("  - Verdict: The statement that an adversary's chance of success is negligible is correct. Therefore, Statement A is TRUE.\n")

    print("3. Analyzing Option B:")
    print("  'For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("  - Analysis: This is a fundamental security guarantee of any asymmetric cryptosystem. If an adversary could recover the secret key, the entire scheme would be broken. The security of ECDSA relies on the difficulty of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP), which makes recovering 'sk' infeasible.")
    print("  - Verdict: The statement that an adversary's chance of success is negligible is correct. Therefore, Statement B is TRUE.\n")

    print("4. Analyzing Option C:")
    print("  'For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.'")
    print("  - Analysis: This statement discusses schemes that are indeed forgeable. It is true that insecure or broken signature schemes exist where such an attack is possible.")
    print("  - Verdict: While this statement is true in isolation, it describes insecure schemes, which contradicts the real-world security of ECDSA mentioned in the premise.\n")

    print("5. Analyzing Option D:")
    print("  'For all existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can figure out m with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("  - Analysis: This claims that message recovery is difficult for 'all' schemes in a class. This is incorrect. Some signature schemes are explicitly designed with 'message recovery' as a feature, allowing the message (or part of it) to be extracted from the signature.")
    print("  - Verdict: The use of 'for all' makes this statement FALSE.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("Based on the analysis, both Statement A and Statement B are true descriptions of the security guarantees provided by ECDSA.")
    print("Since more than one option is true, the correct choice is E.")
