    "To determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings needed to construct a full spectral volume (3D space + energy) from a single image, we need a method that can capture both tomographic (multi-angle) and spectroscopic (multi-energy) information in a single snapshot.\n\nHere is the plan to arrive at the solution:\n1.  **Tomographic Information:** To reconstruct a 3D volume, computed tomography requires projections of the object from multiple different angles.\n2.  **Spectroscopic Information:** To get a \"spectral\" volume, each of these projections must also be resolved by energy (wavelength).\n3.  **Single-shot Acquisition:** Both the multi-angle and multi-energy data must be captured in a single exposure on a 2D detector.\n\nA technique that achieves this uses a multi-stage grating system:\n*   **Grating 1 (Beam-splitter/Disperser):** The first grating is used as a beam-splitter. It diffracts the incoming beam into multiple orders (+1, -1, +2, -2, etc.). These separate diffracted beams pass through the sample at slightly different angles, providing the multiple views required for tomography. Crucially, the angle of diffraction also depends on the X-ray energy, so this grating simultaneously disperses each beam into a spectrum.\n*   **Grating 2 (Analyzer):** A second grating is placed after the sample and before the detector. It acts as an analyzer, typically in an interferometric setup (like a Talbot-Lau interferometer). It creates a moiré pattern on the detector that encodes fine details about the beam's phase and scattering, which can be retrieved along with absorption.\n\nThis two-grating system successfully multiplexes the spatial, angular, and spectral information onto a single 2D detector image. A complex reconstruction algorithm can then demultiplex this data to create the full spectral volume. Therefore, a minimum of two gratings is necessary for a robust implementation of this single-shot technique.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this total.\n\n```python\n# To construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed\n# tomography, a specific experimental setup is required to capture both\n# multi-angle (for tomography) and multi-energy (for spectral) information\n# in one snapshot.\n\n# 1. The first grating acts as a beam-splitter and a dispersive element.\n# It splits the main beam into multiple sub-beams that probe the sample\n# from different angles. It also disperses each sub-beam by energy.\nnum_beamsplitter_grating = 1\n\n# 2. The second grating acts as an analyzer. It is placed after the sample\n# to create an interference (moiré) pattern on the detector. This pattern\n# allows for the robust retrieval of absorption, phase, and dark-field\n# contrast for each angular view and energy.\nnum_analyzer_grating = 1\n\n# The minimum number of gratings is the sum of these essential components.\ntotal_gratings = num_beamsplitter_grating + num_analyzer_grating\n\n# The final equation shows the contribution of each grating to the total.\nprint(f\"The calculation for the minimum number of gratings is:\")\nprint(f\"{num_beamsplitter_grating} (for beam splitting and dispersion) + {num_analyzer_grating} (for analysis) = {total_gratings}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
