# To construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed
# tomography, a specific experimental setup is required to capture both
# multi-angle (for tomography) and multi-energy (for spectral) information
# in one snapshot.

# 1. The first grating acts as a beam-splitter and a dispersive element.
# It splits the main beam into multiple sub-beams that probe the sample
# from different angles. It also disperses each sub-beam by energy.
num_beamsplitter_grating = 1

# 2. The second grating acts as an analyzer. It is placed after the sample
# to create an interference (moir√©) pattern on the detector. This pattern
# allows for the robust retrieval of absorption, phase, and dark-field
# contrast for each angular view and energy.
num_analyzer_grating = 1

# The minimum number of gratings is the sum of these essential components.
total_gratings = num_beamsplitter_grating + num_analyzer_grating

# The final equation shows the contribution of each grating to the total.
