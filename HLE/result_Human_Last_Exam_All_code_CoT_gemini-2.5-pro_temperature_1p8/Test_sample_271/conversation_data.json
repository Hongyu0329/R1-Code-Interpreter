    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The problem asks for the possible degrees of all proper normal subextensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ of the splitting field $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\n\n2.  **Galois Theory Connection:** According to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, there's a one-to-one correspondence between the subfields of $K$ containing $\\mathbb{Q}$ and the subgroups of the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. Normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ correspond to normal subgroups $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$ of $G$. The degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is equal to the index of the corresponding subgroup, $[G:H]$. The conditions $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ translate to $H \\neq G$ and $H \\neq \\{e\\}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Galois Group G:**\n    a.  First, factor the polynomial $f(x)$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ to find its irreducible factors.\n    b.  The splitting field $K$ is the composite of the splitting fields of these irreducible factors.\n    c.  Determine the Galois group for each factor. Let's say $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$, and the corresponding Galois groups are $G_g$ and $G_h$.\n    d.  Check if the splitting fields are disjoint over $\\mathbb{Q}$. If they are, the Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups, i.e., $G \\cong G_g \\times G_h$.\n\n4.  **Find Normal Subgroups of G:**\n    a.  Identify all normal subgroups of $G_g$ and $G_h$.\n    b.  The normal subgroups of the direct product $G \\cong G_g \\times G_h$ can be found. They are not just the direct products of normal subgroups of $G_g$ and $G_h$ (product-type), but can also include \"diagonal\" subgroups if the orders of $G_g$ and $G_h$ are not coprime. A systematic search is needed.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degrees:**\n    a.  For each proper non-trivial normal subgroup $H$ found in the previous step, calculate its index $[G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n    b.  The collection of all these indices forms the list of possible degrees for the subextensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThis plan is implemented in the following Python script. The script first performs the algebraic steps and then calculates the possible degrees based on the structure of the Galois group.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_field_degrees():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds all possible degrees of normal field extensions L/Q\n    such that Q is a proper subfield of L and L is a proper subfield of K,\n    where K is the splitting field of the given polynomial.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = sympy.symbols('x')\n    f_poly_expr = x**7 - 2*x**5 - 9*x**3 + 3*x**2 + 18*x - 6\n\n    # Step 1: Factor the polynomial over the rationals Q.\n    p = sympy.Poly(f_poly_expr, x, domain='QQ')\n    factors_list = sympy.factor_list(p)[1]\n    g_poly, h_poly = factors_list[0][0], factors_list[1][0]\n    \n    print(f\"The polynomial f(x) factors over Q as: ({g_poly}) * ({h_poly})\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the Galois groups of the factors.\n    # The Galois group of g(x) = x^3 - 3 over Q is the symmetric group S_3.\n    # Its splitting field is K_g = Q(cbrt(3), omega), where omega is a cube root of unity.\n    # [K_g:Q] = 6.\n    g_group_name = \"S_3\"\n    g_group_order = 6\n    print(f\"The Galois group of g(x) = {g_poly} is {g_group_name}, which has order {g_group_order}.\")\n\n    # The Galois group of h(x) = x^4 - 2x^2 + 2 over Q is the dihedral group D_8.\n    # Its roots are sqrt(1 +/- i).
