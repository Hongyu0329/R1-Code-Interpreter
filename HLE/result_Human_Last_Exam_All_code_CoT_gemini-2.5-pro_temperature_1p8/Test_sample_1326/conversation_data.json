    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of the piecewise function $p(x)$ over the interval $[0, 4]$. The function $p(x)$ is defined as:\n\n-   $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8}$ for $0 \\le x \\le 3$\n-   $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1 + \\sin x)}{1 + \\cos x}$ for $3 \\le x \\le 5$\n\nThe integral from 0 to 4 must be split at $x=3$ according to the function's definition:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{4} p(x) \\,dx = \\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{2x^3}{8} \\,dx + \\int_{3}^{4} \\frac{e^x(1 + \\sin x)}{1 + \\cos x} \\,dx $$\n\nHere is my plan to solve this using Python:\n1.  Define the two parts of the function, one for the interval $[0, 3]$ and the other for $[3, 4]$.\n2.  Use the `quad` function from the `scipy.integrate` library to numerically calculate the integral for each part.\n3.  The second integral has a point of singularity at $x = \\pi$ (since $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$), which lies within the integration interval $[3, 4]$. I will specify this point to the `quad` function for accurate computation.\n4.  Sum the results of the two integrals to find the total value.\n5.  Finally, print the step-by-step calculation, showing the values for each part and the final sum.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the integral of the piecewise function p(x) from x = 0 to x = 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the first part of the function for the interval [0, 3]\n    def p1(x):\n        return (2 * x**3) / 8\n\n    # Define the second part of the function for the interval [3, 5]\n    def p2(x):\n        return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n    # 1. Calculate the integral for the first part: from x = 0 to x = 3\n    integral1, _ = quad(p1, 0, 3)\n\n    # 2. Calculate the integral for the second part: from x = 3 to x = 4\n    # The function p2 has a singularity at x = pi because the denominator 1 + cos(x) becomes 0.\n    # We pass this point to the 'quad' function for a more accurate result.\n    singularity_point = np.pi\n    integral2, _ = quad(p2, 3, 4, points=[singularity_point])\n\n    # 3.
