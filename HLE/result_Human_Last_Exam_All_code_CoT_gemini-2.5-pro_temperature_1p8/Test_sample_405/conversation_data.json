    "To determine the number of colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the primary allotropes of phosphorus.** These are the distinct structural forms of the element.\n2.  **List the characteristic color of each allotrope.**\n3.  **Count the number of unique colors.**\n4.  **Write a Python script** that enumerates these colors, presents the count as an addition equation, and prints the final result.\n\nThe main allotropes and their colors are:\n*   **White Phosphorus**: White (can appear yellowish).\n*   **Red Phosphorus**: Red.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus**: Violet (also known as Hittorf's phosphorus).\n*   **Black Phosphorus**: Black.\n\nThis gives us four distinct colors to count.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the distinct colors of pure phosphorus allotropes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The major allotropes of phosphorus have distinct colors.\n    colors = {\n        \"White Phosphorus\": \"White\",\n        \"Red Phosphorus\": \"Red\",\n        \"Violet Phosphorus\": \"Violet\",\n        \"Black Phosphorus\": \"Black\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"The distinct colors of pure phosphorus allotropes are:\")\n    # Print each color\n    for color in colors.values():\n        print(f\"- {color}\")\n    \n    # To count them, we can represent each color as '1' in a sum.\n    # The final code needs to output each number in the final equation.\n    equation_parts = [f\"1 ({color})\" for color in colors.values()]\n    total_colors = len(colors)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe equation representing the total count is:\")\n    print(f\"{' + '.join(equation_parts)} = {total_colors}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
