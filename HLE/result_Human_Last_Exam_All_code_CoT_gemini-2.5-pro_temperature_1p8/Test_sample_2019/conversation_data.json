    "This problem asks for the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal (wrap-around) chessboard. Two queens are considered \"attacking\" if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal, where the diagonals wrap around the edges of the board.\n\nMy plan is to solve this using a backtracking algorithm, which is a methodical way to explore all possible placements.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Systematic Search:** I'll write a script that tries to place queens one by one on the 25 squares of the board.\n2.  **Unique Configurations:** To ensure that arrangements are not counted multiple times (e.g., placing queens at positions A and B is the same as B and A), the search will be ordered. When placing a new queen, the script will only consider squares that come after the previously placed queen. This method finds unique combinations of queen placements.\n3.  **Safety Check:** For each potential queen placement, a function will check if it's \"safe\". A placement is safe if the new queen does not attack any of the queens already on the board. This check must account for the toroidal \"wrap-around\" nature of the board using modulo arithmetic. A queen at `(r1, c1)` attacks another at `(r2, c2)` if:\n    *   Row attack: `r1 == r2`\n    *   Column attack: `c1 == c2`\n    *   Main diagonal attack: `(r1 - c1) % 5 == (r2 - c2) % 5`\n    *   Anti-diagonal attack: `(r1 + c1) % 5 == (r2 + c2) % 5`\n4.  **Counting:** The algorithm will recursively explore all valid partial placements. When a valid placement of all 4 queens is found, a counter is incremented.\n5.  **Final Result:** The script will print the final count, which is the total number of ways to place the queens.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan:\n\n```python\ndef solve_queens_toroidal():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens\n    on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard using a backtracking algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 5\n    NUM_QUEENS = 4\n    count = 0\n\n    def is_safe(r, c, queens):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if placing a queen at (r, c) is safe from other queens\n        on a toroidal board.\n        \"\"\"\n        for qr, qc in queens:\n            # Check for row or column conflict\n            if r == qr or c == qc:\n                return False\n            # Check for main diagonal conflict (with wrap-around)\n            if (r - c) % N == (qr - qc) % N:\n                return False\n            # Check for anti-diagonal conflict (with wrap-around)\n            if (r + c) % N == (qr + qc) % N:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def backtrack(queens, start_index):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively explores queen placements to find all solutions.\n        \n        Args:\n            queens (list): A list of (row, col) tuples for placed queens.\n            start_index (int): The board square index to start the search from.\n                               This ensures each combination is counted only once.\n        \"\"\"\n        nonlocal count\n        # Base case: if all queens have been placed, we found a solution.\n        if len(queens) == NUM_QUEENS:\n            count += 1\n            return\n\n        # Optimization: stop if not enough squares are left for the remaining queens.\n        remaining_squares = N * N - start_index\n        if NUM_QUEENS - len(queens) > remaining_squares:\n            return\n\n        # Iterate through the board squares from the start_index.\n        for i in range(start_index, N * N):\n            r = i // N\n            c = i % N\n\n            # If the square is safe, place a queen and recurse.\n            if is_safe(r, c, queens):\n                queens.append((r, c))\n                # The next queen search will start from the next square (i + 1).\n                backtrack(queens, i + 1)\n                # Backtrack: remove the queen to explore other possibilities.\n                queens.pop()\n\n    # Start the backtracking process from an empty board at the first square.\n    backtrack([], 0)\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_queens_toroidal()\n```\n<<<250>>>"
