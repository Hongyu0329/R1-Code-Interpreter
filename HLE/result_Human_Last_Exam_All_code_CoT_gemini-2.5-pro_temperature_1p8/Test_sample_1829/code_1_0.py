    # In classical logic, an implication "if P then Q" is always True when the premise P is False.
    # This is known as a vacuously true statement.
    # We assume "My name is Fred" is true as per the problem's framing.
    # Therefore, S1 as a whole is TRUE.

    # Statement S5: "My best friend is older than me. He is 18 and I am 19."
    # The statement claims an 18-year-old is older than a 19-year-old.
    # This is a factual contradiction.
    # Therefore, S5 is FALSE.

    s4_is_true = False

    # The puzzle states: "Only one statement is true and Fred said it on the day when he tells the truth."
    # Fred said S1 (the true statement) on one of his six "Truth Days".
    # The question asks for a single day, which implies a unique answer.
    # The only information available to specify a day is the content of the true statement S1.
    # S1 is: "...if yesterday was after tomorrow, it would be Wednesday."
    # In logic puzzles, such a specific detail is the key clue.
