    # The result is derived from the following steps:
    # 1. ln(h_k) is asymptotically equal to -2*alpha * (ln(caprad(A_k U B_k)) - ln(caprad(A_k)))
    # 2. The Green's function for 2D random walk behaves as G(r) ~ -(2/pi) * ln(r).
    # 3. Using electrostatic analogy, we calculate the potentials (which relate to ln(caprad)).
    #    - Potential for A_k: V_A ~ -(3/pi) * ln(k)
    #    - Potential for B_k: V_B is constant in k.
    #    - Interaction potential G_AB ~ -(5/pi) * ln(k)
    # 4. Solving for charge distribution between A_k and B_k gives q_A = 5/7.
    # 5. The total potential V_total ~ -(25/(7*pi)) * ln(k).
    # 6. The log-capacity radii are ln(caprad) = -V.
    #    - ln(caprad(A_k)) ~ (3/pi) * ln(k)
    #    - ln(caprad(A_k U B_k)) ~ (25/(7*pi)) * ln(k)
    # 7. The difference is (25/7 - 3)/pi * ln(k) = (4/(7*pi)) * ln(k).
    # 8. ln(h_k) ~ -2*alpha * (4/(7*pi)) * ln(k) = -(8*alpha/(7*pi)) * ln(k).
    # 9. Therefore, lim_{k->inf} (ln(h_k) / ln(k)) = -8*alpha/(7*pi).
