    "My plan is to answer your question by using a Python script.\n1.  I will first identify the core members of the human let-7 microRNA family based on the primary miRNA database, miRBase.\n2.  I will then create a Python list containing the names of these family members.\n3.  The script will calculate the total number of members by getting the length of the list.\n4.  Finally, it will print the list of members and the total count as an addition equation, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_let7_family_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and counts the members of the human let-7 microRNA family.\n    \n    The let-7 family is a group of microRNAs that are highly conserved across species\n    and play crucial roles in development and cancer. The count is based on the distinct\n    mature miRNA sequences identified in humans.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Based on miRBase, the authoritative microRNA database, the human let-7 family\n    # consists of the following core members, including miR-98 which shares the same seed sequence.\n    let7_family_members = [\n        \"let-7a\",\n        \"let-7b\",\n        \"let-7c\",\n        \"let-7d\",\n        \"let-7e\",\n        \"let-7f\",\n        \"let-7g\",\n        \"let-7i\",\n        \"miR-98\"\n    ]\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of members\n    total_members = len(let7_family_members)\n    \n    # Print the identified members\n    print(\"The primary members of the let-7 family identified in humans are:\")\n    for member in let7_family_members:\n        print(f\"- {member}\")\n        \n    print(\"\\nThe total number can be calculated as follows:\")\n    \n    # Create the equation string (e.g., \"1 + 1 + 1 = 3\")\n    equation_parts = [\"1\"] * total_members\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    # Print the final equation and result\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_members}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThus, to date, {total_members} members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans.\")\n\nsolve_let7_family_count()\n```\n<<<9>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
