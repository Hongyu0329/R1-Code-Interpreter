    "To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Concept of \"Maximal Rank\":** The rank of a matrix depends on how a flag's design is translated into numbers. The prompt asks to assume values are chosen to make the rank *maximal*. A robust way to achieve this is to assign a unique, linearly independent basis vector to each distinct color on the flag. With this method, the maximal rank of any flag is simply the number of distinct colors it contains.\n\n2.  **Determine the Rank of the Danish Flag:** The flag of Denmark features two colors: red and white. Therefore, its maximal algebraic rank is 2.\n\n3.  **Analyze African Flags:** I will systematically go through the flags of all African nations and count the number of distinct colors on each one.\n\n4.  **Identify the Matches:** I will identify the countries whose flags have exactly two colors, matching the rank of the Danish flag.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** The code will formalize this process. It will contain a database of African flags and their colors, calculate the rank for each, compare it to Denmark's rank, and print the names of the matching countries, showing the rank calculation for each.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_flag_rank_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of finding African flags with the same algebraic rank as Denmark's flag.\n    \n    Methodology:\n    The \"maximal rank\" of a flag is interpreted as the number of distinct colors in its design.\n    This is because each color can be represented by a unique basis vector, making them\n    linearly independent. The rank of the resulting matrix representation of the flag\n    would then be equal to the number of colors.\n    \n    1. Determine the rank of the Danish flag.\n    2. Systematically determine the rank of each African nation's flag.\n    3.
