    # The problem asks for the minimum hidden-layer width (H) in terms of N,
    # the dimension of the input vector.
    # Let the target function be f(x) = ||x||^2, where x is an N-dimensional vector.
    
    # 1. The Hessian matrix of the network's output, nabla^2(F(x)), has a rank
    #    at most H, the number of hidden neurons. rank(nabla^2(F(x))) <= H.
    
    # 2. The Hessian matrix of the target function f(x) is nabla^2(f(x)) = 2 * I_N,
    #    where I_N is the N-dimensional identity matrix.
    
    # 3. The rank of the target Hessian is rank(2 * I_N) = N.
    
    # 4. For the network to approximate the function, its Hessian's rank must be able
    #    to match the target Hessian's rank. Thus, H >= N.
    
    # 5. It is a known result in approximation theory that this lower bound is tight.
    #    Therefore, N neurons are both necessary and sufficient.

    # The final equation is H_min = 1 * N.
    # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.
