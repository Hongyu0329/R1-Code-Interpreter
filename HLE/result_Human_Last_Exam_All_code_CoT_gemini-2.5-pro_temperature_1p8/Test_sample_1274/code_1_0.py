def solve_group_theory_questions():
    """
    Solves the theoretical questions about free groups and formal languages.
    This function will print the final answers in the required format.
    The logic is based on established theorems in geometric group theory.

    Question (a): Is α(K) context-free for every rational subset K ⊆ F?
    Answer: No.
    Reasoning: A counterexample can be constructed in the free group F = F(a, b).
    Let K = {a}. This is a finite set, and therefore a rational subset.
    The set α(K) is the conjugacy class of 'a'. The language of geodesic words
    representing the conjugacy class of a non-trivial element in a non-abelian
    free group is known to be not context-free.

    Question (b): If α(K) is context-free, does this imply that Geo(α(K)) is also context-free?
    Answer: Yes.
    Reasoning: This is true by definition. A subset S of a free group is called
    "context-free" if and only if its set of geodesic representatives, Geo(S),
    is a context-free language. The question is tautological.

    Question (c): If K is context-free, determine if Geo(α(K)) must be context-free for a different choice of generating set A.
    Answer: No.
    Reasoning: A counterexample can be constructed. Let F be the free group on basis A = {a, b}.
    Let K = {a}. The language of geodesics for K is Geo_A(K) = {"a"}, which is a finite language
    and thus context-free. So, K is a context-free subset.
    However, as reasoned in part (a), α(K) = α({a}) is not a context-free subset
    with respect to the same basis A. Since the statement must hold for any context-free K,
    this counterexample shows that it does not hold in general.
