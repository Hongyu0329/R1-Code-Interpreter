    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the key components of your question: \"protein,\" \"broken down,\" \"macrophage engulfment,\" and \"amyloid.\"\n2.  I will use this analysis to identify the specific protein whose function changes upon being cleaved or \"broken down.\"\n3.  The key is to find a protein that, in its full-length form, inhibits the process, but when cleaved, its resulting fragments promote the process.\n4.  My research points to a specific protein called Pentraxin 3 (PTX3), which perfectly fits this description.\n5.  I will then structure the answer into a Python code block that uses a `print()` statement to deliver the name of the protein and a concise explanation of its mechanism, as requested in the instructions.\n\n```python\ndef solve_biology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the user's question about\n    the protein that, when broken down, facilitates macrophage\n    engulfment of amyloid.\n    \"\"\"\n    protein_name = \"Pentraxin 3 (PTX3)\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"In its full-length form, PTX3 binds to amyloid-beta and inhibits its uptake by microglia (the brain's macrophages).\\n\"\n        \"However, when PTX3 is 'broken down' or cleaved by enzymes, its resulting N-terminal fragment acts as a signal to promote the engulfment of amyloid by these same cells.\"\n    )\n\n    print(f\"The protein is: {protein_name}\")\n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(explanation)\n\nsolve_biology_question()\n```\n<<<Pentraxin 3 (PTX3)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
