# Step 1: Define the geometric object P associated with the log structure.
# The log structure is given by the monoid M = N^3. In the context of toric geometry,
# this monoid defines a 3-dimensional cone in a 3-dimensional real vector space.
# The standard basis vectors of N^3, e1, e2, e3, are the generators of this cone.
e1 = np.array([1, 0, 0])
e2 = np.array([0, 1, 0])

# determined by the number of linearly independent generators. We use matrix rank for this.

# Step 2: Interpret the log blowup as a subdivision of the cone.
# The log ideal I is generated by e1=(1,0,0) and e2=(0,1,0).
# The log blowup for this ideal corresponds to subdividing the cone by introducing a new ray.
# The new ray is along the direction of the sum of the ideal's generators.

# Step 3: Determine the new cones and their dimensions.
# The subdivision splits the original cone into two new maximal cones, sigma_1 and sigma_2.
# sigma_1 is generated by {e1, e3, v}.
# sigma_2 is generated by {e2, e3, v}.
# The dimension of the resulting space is the maximum dimension of these new cones.

print(f"The dimension of sigma_2 is the rank of this matrix, which is {dim2}.")

# Step 4: Calculate the final dimension.
# The dimension of the log blowup is the maximum of the dimensions of the new cones,
# as the resulting variety is covered by the toric varieties associated with these cones.
