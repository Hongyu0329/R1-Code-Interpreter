    "My plan is to address your request by first breaking down the JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge. Then, considering the constraint that the only available epistemic states are 'Knowledge' and 'Belief' and that we must ignore Gettier problems, I will identify two fundamental issues that arise from this framework.\n\n1.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification:** I will explain how the 'Justification' requirement can lead to an infinite chain of justifications. For a belief to be justified, its justification must also be known, which in turn requires justification, leading to an impossible, endless loop.\n2.  **The Inaccessibility of Truth:** I will explain how the 'Truth' requirement is a fact about the external world, not the believer's mind. This makes it impossible for the believer themselves to distinguish between having 'Knowledge' (a justified true belief) and having a 'Belief' that is merely well-justified but happens to be false.\n\nI will present these two problems in a Python script that uses `print()` statements for a clear explanation, numbering the logical steps as requested.\n\n```python\ndef explain_jtb_problems():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains two non-Gettier problems with the JTB definition of knowledge,\n    assuming the only epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Assuming Knowledge = Justified + True + Belief (JTB):\")\n    print(\"Here are two fundamental problems that arise, ignoring Gettier cases.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"====================================================\")\n    print(\"Problem 1: The Infinite Regress of Justification\")\n    print(\"====================================================\")\n    print(\"The 'Justification' component (J) creates a logical paradox:\")\n    print(\"1.

According to JTB, to 'know' J1, your belief in J1 must itself be justified by another reason, J2.\")\n    print(\"4.

Therefore, you cannot reliably distinguish between a 'Justified True Belief' (which is Knowledge) and a 'Justified False Belief' (which is just a Belief).\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: Since the agent cannot determine if the 'Truth' condition is met, they can never be sure if they are in a state of 'Knowledge' or merely 'Belief'.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    explain_jtb_problems()\n```\n<<<The two problems are the Infinite Regress of Justification, where each justification requires a further justification ad infinitum, and the Inaccessibility of Truth, where an agent cannot externally verify if their belief is true, making it impossible for them to distinguish Knowledge from a justified but false Belief.>>>"
