    The historian Fernand Braudel, known for his global perspective, often discussed
    large-scale historical structures. He quoted Paul Morand to define a key concept.
    Morand stated that this entity should be "inscribed within a sphere," meaning
    it must be understood in a global context. The nation is given as just one example
    or component of this larger entity.
    Research confirms that in his work "A History of Civilizations," Braudel quotes Morand
    to define the very subject of his study.
