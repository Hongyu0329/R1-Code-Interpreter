    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we need to analyze its repeating amino acid pattern, known as the heptad repeat `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at the `a` and `d` positions form the hydrophobic core and are the primary determinants of the oligomeric state.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the repeating unit:** The sequence is clearly composed of four 7-residue repeats, bracketed by Glycine residues. The core repeating sequence is `EIAxSLK`, where `x` varies (`Q`, `K`, `W`, `Q`).\n2.  **Determine the heptad register:** We'll test different alignments of the `abcdefg` register to find the one that places hydrophobic residues at the core `a` and `d` positions.\n3.  **Analyze core residues for each plausible register:** We'll examine the amino acid types at the `a` and `d` positions.\n    *   **Dimer (2 helices):** Typically favored by small residues (like Alanine) at the `a` position and larger ones (like Leucine) at the `d` position.\n    *   **Trimer (3 helices):** Typically favored by large hydrophobic residues at both `a` and `d` positions (e.g., Leucine and Isoleucine).\n    *   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Often formed when one core position (`a` or `d`) is hydrophobic (like Isoleucine) and the other is polar (like Serine, Asparagine, or a charged residue).\n4.  **Evaluate contextual clues:** The residues at the solvent-exposed `e` and `g` positions can also provide clues, often forming stabilizing salt bridges.\n5.  **Conclude the most likely state:** Based on established rules of coiled-coil design, we will determine which oligomeric state is best supported by the sequence evidence.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this analysis and print the conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef analyze_coiled_coil(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a coiled-coil sequence to predict its oligomeric state.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define amino acid properties\n    hydrophobic = {'A', 'V', 'I', 'L', 'M', 'F', 'Y', 'W'}\n    polar = {'S', 'T', 'N', 'Q', 'C'}\n    charged = {'D', 'E', 'K', 'R', 'H'}\n\n    # The core repeating sequence (4 heptads = 28 residues)\n    core_seq = \"EIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLK\"\n    print(f\"Sequence being analyzed: {sequence}\")\n    print(f\"Core repeating region: {core_seq}\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Test 1: Trimer Hypothesis (a=L, d=I) ---\n    # This corresponds to the register 'cdefgab' starting from the first 'E'\n    print(\"--- Testing Trimer Hypothesis ---\")\n    trimer_register_offset = 5 # 'cdefg a b' -> 'a' is 6th residue (index 5)\n    \n    a_pos_trimer = []\n    d_pos_trimer = []\n    e_pos_trimer = []\n    g_pos_trimer = []\n\n    for i in range(4):\n        start = i * 7\n        heptad = core_seq[start : start+7]\n        a_pos_trimer.append(heptad[(trimer_register_offset + 0) % 7]) # a is at pos 5\n        d_pos_trimer.append(heptad[(trimer_register_offset + 3) % 7]) # d is at pos 1\n        e_pos_trimer.append(heptad[(trimer_register_offset + 4) % 7]) # e is at pos 2\n        g_pos_trimer.append(heptad[(trimer_register_offset + 6) % 7]) # g is at pos 4\n\n    print(f\"Register 'cdefgab' results in:\")\n    print(f\"  'a' positions: {a_pos_trimer} -> All Leucine (L).\")\n    print(f\"  'd' positions: {d_pos_trimer} -> All Isoleucine (I).\")\n    print(\"Analysis: The core pattern (a=L, d=I) is a very strong signal for a TRIMER.\")\n    print(\"However, let's look at the context positions:\")\n    print(f\"  'e' positions: {e_pos_trimer}\")\n    print(\"  'g' positions: {g_pos_trimer}\")\n    print(\"Problem: The 'e' position, which is typically polar, contains a mix of Alanine and a very bulky hydrophobic Tryptophan (W).
