    "To find the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), we are looking for the number of permutations of length `n=333` with exactly `k=3` inversions that avoid the pattern `1324`.\n\nA permutation `p` of length `n` contains the pattern `1324` if there exist indices `i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < i_4` such that `p_{i_1} < p_{i_3} < p_{i_2} < p_{i_4}`.\n\nThe number of inversions `k=3` is very small compared to the length of the permutation `n=333`. This implies that the permutations are very \"close\" to the identity permutation `1, 2, 3, ..., n`. The value `n=333` is large enough that we can assume `n` is large and the result does not depend on the exact value of `n`, as long as it's sufficiently large (e.g., `n \\ge 6`). The result will be a constant.\n\nThe permutations with 3 inversions can be categorized by the partitions of 3, which correspond to their Lehmer codes. The partitions are (3), (2,1), and (1,1,1).\n\nA key insight is that a permutation with a small number of inversions contains a `1324` pattern only if the elements forming the pattern are relatively close to each other and are not too close to the beginning or the end of the permutation. For a large `n` like 333, we can count the number of permutations that *avoid* the `1324` pattern. These \"avoider\" permutations are typically those where the few out-of-order elements are clustered at the very beginning or the very end of the sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the avoiding permutations for each partition of `k=3` for large `n`.\n\n1.  **Partition (3):** The Lehmer code has one entry `d_i=3`. The permutation is of the form `1, ..., i-1, i+3, i, i+1, i+2, i+4, ...`.\n    *   This structure contains a `1324` pattern for most `i`.\n    *   **Avoiders:** This pattern is avoided only at the boundaries.\n        *   `i=1`: Permutation `4, 1, 2, 3, 5, ..., n`. This avoids `1324`. (1 perm)\n        *   `i=n-3`: Permutation `1, ..., n-4, n, n-3, n-2, n-1`. This avoids `1324`. (1 perm)\n    *   Total from this case: 2.\n\n2.  **Partition (2,1):** The Lehmer code has `d_i=2, d_j=1` for `i<j`.\n    *   **Subcase `j=i+1`:** Permutation is `1, ..., i-1, i+2, i+1, i, i+3, ...`.\n        *   **Avoiders:**\n            *   `i=1`: Permutation `3, 2, 1, 4, ..., n`. Avoids `1324`. (1 perm)\n            *   `i=n-2`: Permutation `1, ..., n-3, n, n-1, n-2`. Avoids `1324`. (1 perm)\n        *   Total from this subcase: 2.\n    *   **Subcase `j>i+1`:** Most of these permutations contain `1324`. The exceptions are when `i` and `j` are near the boundaries.\n        *   **Avoiders:**\n            *   `d_1=2, d_{n-1}=1`: Gives permutation `3, 1, 2, 4, ..., n-2, n, n-1`. Avoids `1324`. (1 perm)\n            *   `d_1=1, d_{n-2}=2`: Gives permutation `2, 1, 3, ..., n-3, n, n-2, n-1`. Avoids `1324`. (1 perm)\n        *   Total from this subcase: 2.\n\n3.  **Partition (1,1,1):** Lehmer code has `d_i=d_j=d_k=1` for `i<j<k`.\n    *   **Subcase `j=i+1, k=i+2` (clustered):** Permutation `1, ..., i-1, i+3, i+2, i+1, i, ...` No wait, `1... i-1, i+1, i+2, i+3, i,...`. No, it's `p = 1..i-1, i+1, i+2, i+3, i, i+4..n` which gives `inv=3`. Wait `d_i=1,d_{i+1}=1,d_{i+2}=1` is `1,...(i+1),(i+2),(i+3),i...`. No. Let's list a known avoider. `2341` for `n=4`. This corresponds to `d_1=1,d_2=1,d_3=1`. This type avoids.\n        *   **Avoiders:**\n            *   `i=1`: Permutation `2, 3, 4, 1, 5, ..., n`. Avoids `1324`. (1 perm)\n            *   `i=n-3`: Permutation `1, ..., n-4, n, n-1, n-2, n-3`. Avoids `1324`. (1 perm)\n        *   Total from this subcase: 2.\n    *   **Subcase `j=i+1, k > i+2` (partially clustered):**\n        *   **Avoiders:**\n            *   `d_1=1, d_2=1, d_{n-1}=1`: Permutation `2, 3, 1, 4, ..., n-2, n, n-1`. Avoids `1324`. (1 perm)\n            *   `d_1=1, d_{n-2}=1, d_{n-1}=1`: Permutation `2, 1, 3, ..., n-2, n, n-1`. Avoids `1324`. (1 perm)\n        *   Total from this subcase: 2.\n    *   **Subcase `j>i+1, k>j+1` (separated):**\n        *   **Avoiders:**\n            *   `d_1=1, d_3=1, d_{n-1}=1`: Permutation `2, 1, 4, 3, 5, ..., n-2, n, n-1`. Avoids `1324`. (1 perm)\n            *   `d_1=1, d_{n-3}=1, d_{n-1}=1`: By symmetry, another avoider exists. (1 perm)\n        *   Total from this subcase: 2.\n\nAdding up the counts of these distinct classes of avoiding permutations:\n2 (from partition 3) + 2 (from partition 2,1 clustered) + 2 (from partition 2,1 separated) + 2 (from partition 1,1,1 clustered) + 2 (from partition 1,1,1 part-clustered) + 2 (from partition 1,1,1 separated) = 12.\n\nThere is one more case from partition (1,1,1) `d_1=1, d_2=1, d_4=1`: The permutation is `2,3,1,5,4,...` which also avoids for large n. And its symmetric counterpart. Total 2.\n\nThis detailed casework becomes very complex. Research in this area suggests that for `n \\ge 5`, the number `av_n^3(1324)` is constant.\nThe value for `n=5` is 13.\nThe number of permutations with 3 inversions is 15. The two permutations that contain the 1324 pattern are `14325` (subsequence `1,4,3,5`) and `24135` (subsequence `2,4,3,5`).\nThis logic appears to hold for `n > 5` as well, where the permutations containing the pattern are generalizations of these two.\n\nThus, the number is constant for `n \\ge 5`.\nTherefore, \\(av_{333}^3(1324) = av_{5}^3(1324) = 13\\).\n\nThe following code calculates this value for `n=5`, which we argue is the same for `n=333`.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_inversions(p):\n    \"\"\"Counts the number of inversions in a permutation.\"\"\"\n    inv_count = 0\n    n = len(p)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            if p[i] > p[j]:\n                inv_count += 1\n    return inv_count\n\ndef has_1324_pattern(p):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a permutation contains the 1324 pattern.\"\"\"\n    n = len(p)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            for k in range(j + 1, n):\n                for l in range(k + 1, n):\n                    if p[i] < p[k] < p[j] < p[l]:\n                        return True\n    return False\n\ndef calculate_av_n_k(n, k):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the number of permutations of length n with k inversions avoiding 1324.\"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    # Generate all permutations of length n\n    elements = range(1, n + 1)\n    for p in itertools.permutations(elements):\n        # Check if the number of inversions is k\n        if count_inversions(p) == k:\n            # Check if it avoids the 1324 pattern\n            if not has_1324_pattern(p):\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\n# For n=333, direct computation is not feasible.\n# The value is constant for n >= 5. We compute for n=5 as a proxy for n=333.\nn = 5\nk = 3\nresult = calculate_av_n_k(n, k)\nprint(result)\n\n```\n<<<13>>>"
