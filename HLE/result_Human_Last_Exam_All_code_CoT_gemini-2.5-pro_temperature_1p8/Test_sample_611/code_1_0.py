def solve_brownian_sausage_problem():
    """
    This function solves the mathematical problem about the Brownian sausage density.

    The problem asks for the limit of the probability P[V_n > 2/3] as n goes to infinity.
    V_n is the relative area of a disk B_n covered by a specific Brownian sausage.

    The analysis shows that the process X_t is transient but behaves locally like a standard 2D Brownian Motion.
    The asymptotic density of its sausage, c = lim V_n, can be calculated.
    The probability that a point z is missed by the sausage corresponds to the probability that a Brownian motion
    with a small drift v (where v -> 0 as |z| -> inf) avoids a unit disk.
    In the limit v -> 0, this is the escape probability for a standard 2D Brownian motion.
    Due to the recurrence of 2D Brownian motion, this probability is 0.
    Therefore, the density of the sausage is c = 1 - 0 = 1.

    Since V_n converges in probability to 1, the probability that V_n is greater than 2/3 must converge to 1.
