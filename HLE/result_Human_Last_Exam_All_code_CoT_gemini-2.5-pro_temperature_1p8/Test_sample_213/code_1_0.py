# I have identified a bug in the GLSL code provided.
# The error is in the 'rotate' function, within the definition of the Rz matrix.
# A standard rotation matrix requires one of the sine components to be negative.
# In the provided code, a minus sign was removed, making the matrix incorrect and causing a distortion instead of a proper rotation.
#
# The buggy line is:
# mat3 Rz=mat3(vec3(cos(a.z),sin(a.z),0),vec3(sin(a.z),cos(a.z),0),vec3(0,0,1));
#
# By re-inserting the removed minus sign, we get the original, correct line.

original_line = "mat3 Rz=mat3(vec3(cos(a.z),sin(a.z),0),vec3(-sin(a.z),cos(a.z),0),vec3(0,0,1));"
print(original_line)
