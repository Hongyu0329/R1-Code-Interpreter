    "To solve this, we will analyze the reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide. This is a classic example of an E2 elimination reaction where stereochemistry dictates the outcome.\n\nHere is my plan to determine the product:\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:** The substrate is a secondary alkyl halide, and the reagent is potassium tert-butoxide, a strong, sterically hindered base. These conditions favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n2.  **Analyze Stereochemical Requirements:** The E2 mechanism requires a specific spatial arrangement called an anti-periplanar geometry. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means the leaving group (bromine) and the proton to be removed must be in a trans-diaxial orientation (both axial and on opposite sides of the ring).\n3.  **Determine the Reactive Conformation:** The substrate, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, is a trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane. It can exist in two chair conformations: a stable diequatorial form and an unstable diaxial form. While most molecules exist in the stable diequatorial form at any given moment, this conformer is unreactive because the bromine is not axial. The reaction must proceed through the less stable but reactive diaxial conformer.\n4.  **Evaluate Elimination Pathways:** In the reactive diaxial conformer, both the bromine (at C1) and the methyl group (at C2) are in axial positions. We check for available trans-diaxial protons on the adjacent carbons (beta-protons at C2 and C6).\n    *   **At C2 (Zaitsev pathway):** Since the methyl group is axial, the proton on C2 is equatorial. It is not trans-diaxial to the axial bromine, so elimination to form the more substituted product (1-methylcyclohexene) is impossible.\n    *   **At C6 (Hofmann pathway):** The C6 carbon has an axial proton which is perfectly positioned (trans-diaxial) for elimination with the axial bromine.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The reaction is under stereoelectronic control. The base can only abstract the proton from C6, leading exclusively to the less substituted alkene. The product is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\nThe following Python code will print this step-by-step analysis and provide the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_organic_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the E2 elimination of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n    and prints the name of the resulting product.\n    \"\"\"\n    product_name = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n\n    print(\"### Reaction Analysis ###\")\n    print(\"The reaction is an E2 elimination of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n1.
