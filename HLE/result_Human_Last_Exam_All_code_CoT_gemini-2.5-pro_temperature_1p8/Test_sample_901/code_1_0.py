    print("\n1. E2 Requirement:")
    print("   - The E2 mechanism requires a trans-diaxial arrangement of the leaving group (Br) and a beta-proton.")

    print("\n2. Substrate Conformation:")
    print("   - The substrate is a trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane. For the reaction to occur, it must adopt its")
    print("     less stable diaxial conformation, which places the Br in the necessary axial position.")
    print("   - In this reactive conformer, the methyl group on C2 is also forced into an axial position.")

    print("\n3. Regiochemistry (Which product is formed?):")
    print("   - Zaitsev Pathway (forms 1-methylcyclohexene): The beta-proton at C2 is equatorial because the methyl group")
    print("     is axial. This proton is NOT trans-diaxial to the axial Br. This pathway is stereochemically forbidden.")

    print("\n### Conclusion ###")
    print("Due to these strict stereoelectronic constraints, the elimination can only occur by removing a proton from C6.")
