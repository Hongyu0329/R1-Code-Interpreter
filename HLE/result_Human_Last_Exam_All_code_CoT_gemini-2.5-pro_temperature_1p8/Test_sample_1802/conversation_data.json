    "To find the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, let's first understand the components involved.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n1.  **Define the Pauli Channel:** A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit) transforms a density matrix $\\rho$ as follows:\n    $$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{jk} U_{jk} \\rho U_{jk}^\\dagger $$\n    where $U_{jk} = X^j Z^k$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators (also known as Weyl-Heisenberg operators), and $\\{p_{jk}\\}$ is a probability distribution ($p_{jk} \\ge 0$, $\\sum p_{jk} = 1$). The Kraus operators for this channel are $E_{jk} = \\sqrt{p_{jk}} U_{jk}$.\n\n2.  **Define Channel Rank and Complementary Channel:** The rank of a quantum channel is the minimum number of Kraus operators required in its operator-sum representation. This is equal to the number of linearly independent Kraus operators. A fundamental theorem in quantum information theory states that a channel $\\Lambda$ and its complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ have the same rank. Therefore, our problem is equivalent to finding the maximal rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ itself.\n\n3.  **Determine the Rank of the Pauli Channel:** The rank of $\\Lambda$ is the number of linearly independent operators in its Kraus set $\\{E_{jk} = \\sqrt{p_{jk}} U_{jk}\\}$. The generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_{jk}\\}_{j,k=0}^{d-1}$ form a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices and are therefore linearly independent. Consequently, the number of linearly independent Kraus operators is equal to the number of non-zero probabilities $p_{jk}$.\n\n4.  **Maximize the Rank:** To maximize the rank, we need to maximize the number of non-zero probabilities $p_{jk}$. The only constraint on $\\{p_{jk}\\}$ is that they form a probability distribution. We can choose all $d^2$ probabilities to be non-zero. For example, we can select $p_{jk} = 1/d^2$ for all $j,k \\in \\{0, \\dots, d-1\\}$. This corresponds to the completely depolarizing channel, a valid physical channel.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** With all $d^2$ probabilities being non-zero, we have $d^2$ linearly independent Kraus operators. This means the maximal rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$. Since the rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is the same as the rank of $\\Lambda$, its maximal rank is also $d^2$.\n\nThe Python code below demonstrates this by calculating the result for a given dimension `d`.\n\n```python\n# The dimension of the qudit system.\n# This can be any integer greater than or equal to 2.\n# For example, for a qubit d=2, for a qutrit d=3.\nd = 3\n\n# Step 1: A Pauli channel is defined by d*d generalized Pauli operators.\nnum_pauli_operators = d**2\n\n# Step 2: The rank of the channel is the number of linearly independent Kraus operators.\n# This corresponds to the number of non-zero probabilities p_jk.\n# To maximize the rank, we choose all d*d probabilities to be non-zero.\n# For example, p_jk = 1/(d*d) for all j,k. This gives d*d linearly independent Kraus operators.\n# Therefore, the maximal rank of the Pauli channel is d*d.\nmax_rank_Lambda = num_pauli_operators\n\n# Step 3: The rank of a channel is equal to the rank of its complementary channel.\nmax_rank_complementary = max_rank_Lambda\n\n# Step 4: Print the result and the equation.\nprint(f\"For a qudit of dimension d = {d}, a Pauli channel is characterized by d^2 = {d*d} generalized Pauli operators.\")\nprint(\"The rank of the channel corresponds to the number of these operators with non-zero probability.\")\nprint(\"To maximize the rank, we can assign a non-zero probability to all operators.\")\nprint(f\"Thus, the maximal rank of the Pauli channel, and its complementary channel, is d^2.\")\nprint(f\"Final equation: {d} ^ 2 = {max_rank_complementary}\")\n\n```\n<<<d^2>>>"
