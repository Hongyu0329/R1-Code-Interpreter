    # 3: Batesian, Eristalini - color, Melipotini - color.
    #    A correct structure for Batesian mimicry: a harmless species (Eristalini hoverfly)
    #    mimics a harmful one (a potentially aposematic Melipotini moth) using color.
    # 5: Müllerian, Heliconiini - color, Melipotini - color.
    #    A classic example of Müllerian mimicry where two unpalatable groups (Heliconiini
    #    butterflies and Melipotini moths) share a common warning signal (color).
    # 8: Aposematism, Danaus plexipus - wing, Cycnia tenera - tymbal.
    #    Two correct and direct examples of the principle of aposematism (warning signaling).
    #    Danaus plexippus uses visual warning (wing color) and Cycnia tenera uses
    #    auditory warning (tymbals).
