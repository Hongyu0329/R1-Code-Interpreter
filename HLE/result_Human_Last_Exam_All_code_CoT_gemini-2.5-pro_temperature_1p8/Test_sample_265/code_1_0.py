def solve_bug_climb():
    """
    Solves the bug climbing puzzle using a Breadth-First Search (BFS).
    
    The plan is as follows:
    1. Model the cylindrical tower as a 2D grid with integer coordinates.
       A brick's position is represented by a tuple (row, column_pos).
       To handle the 10.5 brick circumference and staggering, we use a
       grid with 21 column positions. An even row `y` has bricks at even 
       column positions `x` (0, 2, ..., 20). An odd row `y` has bricks
       at odd column positions `x` (1, 3, ..., 19). This means a brick
       exists at (y, x) only if y and x have the same parity.

    2. Determine a brick's color based on its position. We can calculate a
       unique sequential index 'k' for any brick at (y, x). The color is
       then determined by `k mod 6`, based on the repeating pattern of
       [Red, Red, Blue, Red, Blue, Blue].

    3. The problem is now a shortest-path problem on a graph where nodes are
       red bricks and edges connect adjacent red bricks. The bug starts at the
       first brick, (0, 0), and wants to reach any brick directly above it,
       which has coordinates (y, 0) for some y > 0.

    4. A Breadth-First Search (BFS) is the perfect algorithm for finding the
       shortest path in this unweighted graph. The BFS explores the graph
       layer by layer, guaranteeing that the first time it reaches a target
       node, it has found a path with the minimum number of steps.

    5. The BFS queue stores tuples of (distance, coordinates). We also use a
       'visited' dictionary to keep track of visited nodes and their parents,
       which allows us to reconstruct the shortest path once the target is found.
    
    6. The search starts at (0, (0,0)) and expands to neighbors. Neighbors
       are adjacent bricks (horizontally, or diagonally up/down). A neighbor
       is only added to the queue if it is a red brick and has not been
       visited yet.

    7. The search terminates when the first valid target is found. The final
       result (the number of steps) is then printed, along with an equation
       representing the sum of steps as requested.
