    "To find the central pixel of the line from (1, 1) to (11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Implement Bresenham's Algorithm**: I will write a script that generates all the integer coordinates (pixels) along the line. Since the slope is `(5-1)/(11-1) = 4/10 = 0.4`, which is between 0 and 1, I will use the standard version of the algorithm where we always increment the x-coordinate by 1 and decide whether to increment the y-coordinate based on a decision parameter.\n2.  **Store the Pixels**: As the algorithm generates each pixel's coordinates, I will add them to a list.\n3.  **Find the Center**: Once all the pixels are generated and stored, I will determine the total number of pixels. The central pixel will be the one at the middle index of the list (e.g., if there are 11 pixels, the 6th one is the center).\n4.  **Output the Coordinates**: Finally, the script will print the coordinates of this central pixel.\n\n```python\ndef find_central_pixel_bresenham():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the central pixel of a line from (1, 1) to (11, 5)\n    using Bresenham's line algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = 1, 1\n    x2, y2 = 11, 5\n\n    # List to store all the points on the line\n    points = []\n\n    # Calculate differences\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n\n    # Initialize current coordinates and decision parameter\n    x, y = x1, y1\n    p = 2 * dy - dx\n\n    # Add the starting point\n    points.append((x, y))\n\n    # Loop to generate all points along the line\n    # This loop will run dx times (10 times)\n    while x < x2:\n        x += 1\n        if p < 0:\n            # y remains the same, update decision parameter\n            p = p + 2 * dy\n        else:\n            # y is incremented, update decision parameter\n            y += 1\n            p = p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx\n        points.append((x, y))\n    \n    # Calculate the middle index\n    mid_index = len(points) // 2\n    \n    # Get the central pixel coordinates\n    central_pixel = points[mid_index]\n    \n    # As requested, output the numbers in the final answer\n    print(f\"The coordinates of the central pixel are: ({central_pixel[0]}, {central_pixel[1]})\")\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the result\nfind_central_pixel_bresenham()\n```\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
