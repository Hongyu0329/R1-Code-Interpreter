    "Of course, I can help with that. Determining the ideal stoichiometry for a catalyst is a complex problem that is typically solved through extensive experimental research rather than direct calculation from first principles. The optimal ratio can also vary based on the specific synthesis method and reaction conditions.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with a Python script that retrieves the most commonly cited optimal ratio from a simulated database, based on findings in scientific literature. This script will explain the reasoning behind this optimal value.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Create a Python dictionary to act as a small database, storing information about the Ni-Ceria catalyst system.\n2.  Store the widely accepted optimal Ni/Ce molar ratio for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, which is also a strong starting point for water splitting applications.\n3.  The script will access this data and print it in a clear, descriptive format.\n4.  It will also show a simple calculation to derive the Ni/Ce ratio from a common compositional percentage (mol%), satisfying the instruction to show the numbers in an equation.\n\n```python\ndef get_optimal_catalyst_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function retrieves and explains the ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio for\n    Ni-Ceria catalysts based on experimental findings in scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Simulated database based on experimental data from peer-reviewed studies.\n    # The ideal ratio balances active Ni sites and the promotional effect of ceria.\n    catalyst_data = {\n        'system': 'Ni-Ceria (Ni-CeO2)',\n        'reactions': 'Water Gas Shift (WGS), Water Splitting (WS)',\n        'optimal_composition_mol_percent_ni': 10,\n        'explanation': (\n            \"An optimal Ni/Ce ratio creates a synergistic effect.
