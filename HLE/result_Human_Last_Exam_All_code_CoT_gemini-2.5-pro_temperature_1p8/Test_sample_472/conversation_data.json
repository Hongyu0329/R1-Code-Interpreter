    "This is a challenging line of Latin poetry, likely from early Roman tragedy, that is famous for its metrical difficulties. As written, the line has more syllables than a standard Latin meter would allow. To solve this, we must assume it is an **Iambic Senarius** (a six-foot line based on the iamb `u-`), which was common in Roman drama. To make the line fit the 12-syllable meter, we need to apply two contractions that were used by early poets:\n\n1.  **Elision and Syncope:** The words `bene esse` are contracted into two syllables. The `-e` of `bene` is elided, and the remaining sounds are compressed. This is scanned as `ben-se`.\n2.  **Synizesis:** The word `soli` (two syllables) is pronounced as a single syllable, `sol`.\n\nWith these changes, the line fits a valid Iambic Senarius pattern, with allowed metrical substitutions. The final foot `male` (`S S`) is scanned as an iamb (`S L`) by the principle of *brevis in longo*, where the final syllable of a line can be considered long.\n\nThe script below will print the scansion of the line, foot by foot.\n\n```python\ndef solve_scansion():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function scans the Latin line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\n    The scansion is based on the iambic senarius meter, which requires assuming\n    contractions common in early Roman dramatic poetry to fit the 12-syllable pattern.\n    L = Long syllable\n    S = Short syllable\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the six metrical feet of the iambic senarius line.\n    # Each foot is a tuple containing the syllables and their determined length.\n    foot1 = (\"et\", \"ti\", \"S\", \"S\")\n    foot2 = (\"bi\", \"ben(e)\", \"S\", \"L\")\n    foot3 = (\"(es)se\", \"sol(i)\", \"S\", \"L\")\n    foot4 = (\"quom\", \"si(bi)\", \"L\", \"S\")\n    foot5 = (\"si)bi\", \"sit\", \"S\", \"L\")\n    foot6 = (\"ma\", \"le\", \"S\", \"L\") # Final 'L' by Brevis in Longo\n\n    feet = [foot1, foot2, foot3, foot4, foot5, foot6]\n\n    final_scansion_parts = []\n    for foot in feet:\n        # We need to output each character of the scansion individually,\n        # followed by a space for the foot boundary.\n        final_scansion_parts.append(foot[2])\n        final_scansion_parts.append(\" \")\n        final_scansion_parts.append(foot[3])\n        final_scansion_parts.append(\"  \") # Space between feet\n\n    # The prompt requires printing each symbol in the final equation.\n    # We will print the letters for the scansion one by one.\n    print_list = []\n    for part in final_scansion_parts:\n        for char in part:\n            print_list.append(char)\n            \n    print(\"\".join(print_list).strip())\n\n\nsolve_scansion()\n```\n<<<S S  S L  S L  L S  S L  S L>>>"
