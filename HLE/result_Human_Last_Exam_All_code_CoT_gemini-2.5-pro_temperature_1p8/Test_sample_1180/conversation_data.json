    "To find the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve defined by $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ above 2, we can use the method of Newton polygons.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the polynomial:** The curve is of the form $z^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$.\n2.  **Define the valuation:** The valuation $v$ is normalized such that $v(2)=1$. This is the standard 2-adic valuation.\n3.  **Construct the Newton Polygon:** The Newton polygon of $f(x)$ is the lower convex hull of the points $(i, v(a_i))$, where $a_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$ in $f(x)$.\n4.  **Identify vertices and slopes:** The vertices of the Newton polygon determine the segments and their slopes. The stable reduction of the curve will have components corresponding to these segments. A vertex where two segments with different slopes meet corresponds to a double point (a node) in the stable model, connecting these components.\n5.  **Calculate the thickness:** The thickness of this double point is given by a well-known formula. It is the smallest positive integer `n` such that the product of `n` and the difference of the slopes of the adjacent segments is an integer.\n6.  **Implement in Python:** Write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the result.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef get_thickness():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve\n    z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
