def solve_bayesian_assumptions_puzzle():
    """
    Solves the logic puzzle about necessary assumptions for Bayesian information gain convergence.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. Assumption (a) is necessary. The total expected information gain is bounded by the prior entropy.
       If the prior entropy is finite, the infinite sum of per-step information gains must converge,
       which implies the terms must go to zero.

    2. We need assumptions to ensure the data stream is regular enough for statistical learning.
       - Assumption (d) i.i.d. sampling is the classic, simplest case where convergence holds.
       - In the more general (and realistic for an agent) non-i.i.d. case of an MDP,
         assumptions (b) and (c) are needed to establish ergodic properties that allow for convergence.
       - Therefore, we need either (d) OR the combination of (b) AND (c).

    3. Assumption (e) is a consequence of convergence, not a precondition. Assuming it would be circular.

    4. This leads to the logical form: a AND ( (b AND c) OR d )

    5. Converting to Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) using the distributive law:
       a AND (b OR d) AND (c OR d)

    6. Formatting according to the user's rules (alphabetical order for clauses and literals):
       - Clause 1: (a)
       - Clause 2: (b OR d)
       - Clause 3: (c OR d)
       - The clauses are already in alphabetical order.
