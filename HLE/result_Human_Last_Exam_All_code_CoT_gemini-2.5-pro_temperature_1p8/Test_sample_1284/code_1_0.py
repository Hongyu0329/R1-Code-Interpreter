    This function determines the smallest possible dimension n for the given problem.

    The problem asks for the smallest integer dimension 'n' for which the Fourier
    restriction-type inequality
        ||E f||_{L^{2n/(n-1)}(X)} <= C_epsilon * R^epsilon * ||f||_2
    does not always hold.

    This inequality is a variant of the classical Fourier Restriction Conjecture.
    The conjecture is known to be true for dimension n=2 and false for all
    dimensions n >= 3.

    The specific structure of the set X (a union of balls with disjoint
    projections) does not change this fundamental result. Standard counterexamples
    to the conjecture build concentration of the function Ef on structured sets
    (like grids) which are compatible with the geometric constraints on X.

    Therefore, the inequality holds for n=2 but fails for n=3.
    The smallest dimension n for which it fails is 3.
