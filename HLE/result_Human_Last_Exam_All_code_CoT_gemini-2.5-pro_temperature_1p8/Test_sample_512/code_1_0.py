# Step 1 & 2: Initial container analysis
# The initial container is a 12x12x12 cube.
# Balls have radius r_ball = 2 cm (diameter = 4 cm).
# In a 12cm dimension, we can fit 3 balls (centers at 2, 6, 10).
# Total balls = 3 * 3 * 3 = 27.
# Surface area of the initial cube = 6 * (12**2) = 864 cm^2.
# Goal: N_balls >= 27, SA_new < 864.

# Step 3 & 4: Propose a cylindrical container and design the packing
# We will use a cylindrical container.
# We can pack balls in layers. A custom 7-ball pattern can be arranged
# with ball centers at (0,0), (+-4, 0), (+-2, 3.5), (+-2, -3.5) relative to the layer's center.
# All these coordinates are multiples of 0.5.
# The maximum distance of a center from the origin is 4 cm.
# So, the radius of the cylinder must be at least 4 cm (for centers) + 2 cm (ball radius) = 6 cm.
# We choose cylinder radius r_cyl = 6 cm.

# Step 5: Determine cylinder height
# To hold >= 27 balls, we need at least 4 layers of 7 balls (N = 28).
# To minimize height, we use a staggered packing. The vertical distance between
# layer centers (dz) must satisfy dz^2 >= D^2 - d_xy^2, where D=4 is the ball diameter
# and d_xy is the horizontal distance between centers of balls in adjacent layers.
# A careful placement of a ball in a "hollow" gives a minimum horizontal distance squared (d_xy^2) of 4.
# So, dz^2 >= 16 - 4 = 12, which means dz >= sqrt(12) ~= 3.464 cm.
# The smallest multiple of 0.5 cm for dz is 3.5 cm.
# For 4 layers, there are 3 gaps, so the distance between the top and bottom layer centers is 3 * 3.5 = 10.5 cm.
# The total height of the cylinder H = (distance between centers) + 2 * r_ball = 10.5 + 4 = 14.5 cm.
# So, the proposed container is a cylinder with r=6 cm and h=14.5 cm.

# Step 6: Calculate the new surface area
r = 6.0
h = 14.5
surface_area = 2 * math.pi * r * (r + h) # 2*pi*r^2 + 2*pi*r*h

# Step 7: Format the final output
# The surface area is 246 * pi, which is approximately 772.8 cm^2.
# This is less than the original 864 cm^2.
# The container holds 28 balls, which is >= 27.
# The dimensions r=6, h=14.5 are multiples of 0.5.
# The answer is "Yes". We provide the solution in the d[X] format.
