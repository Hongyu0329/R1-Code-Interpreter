# Step 1: Determine n1 and n2 based on the given conditions.
# Based on the analysis that n must be an even integer and u_r(n) = n/2 - 1 >= 1,
# the smallest possible value for n is 4. The next smallest is 6.
n1 = 4
n2 = 6

# Step 2: Define the Hamiltonian by substituting n1 and n2.
# The potential V(q) is the part of the Hamiltonian that depends on q.
# H(p, q) = 1/2 * p^2 + V(q)
# V(q) = 1/2 * (q^2 - C * q^k)
# where k = n1 / 2 and C = (2/n1) * sqrt((n2-n1)/(n1/2))

# Calculate k
k = n1 / 2

# Calculate C
C = (2 / n1) * math.sqrt((n2 - n1) / (n1 / 2))

# The potential is V(q) = 1/2 * (q^2 - 0.5 * q^2) = 1/4 * q^2.
# This corresponds to a simple harmonic oscillator.
# The standard Hamiltonian for a simple harmonic oscillator (with mass m=1) is:
# H = 1/2 * p^2 + 1/2 * omega^2 * q^2
# By comparing V(q) = 1/4 * q^2 with 1/2 * omega^2 * q^2, we find omega.
# 1/2 * omega^2 = 1/4  => omega^2 = 1/2
omega_squared = 0.5
omega = math.sqrt(omega_squared)

# Step 3: Calculate the period T.
# The period of a simple harmonic oscillator is T = 2 * pi / omega.
# The period is constant and does not depend on energy.
# The problem asks for T((n1-1)/n2), which is T evaluated at alpha = (n1-1)/n2.
alpha_numerator = n1 - 1
alpha_denominator = n2
alpha = alpha_numerator / alpha_denominator

period = 2 * math.pi / omega
