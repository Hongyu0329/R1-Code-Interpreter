    Solves the problem of finding the smallest possible number of connected components
    of CL(X) for a totally-disconnected ultrametric space X.
    """

    # Step 1: Define the properties of space X.
    # X is a totally-disconnected, ultrametric space with infinitely many points.
    # CL(X) is the set of non-empty closed subsets of X with the Wijsman topology.
    print("Goal: Find the minimum number of connected components of CL(X).")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 2: Consider partitioning CL(X) into bounded and unbounded sets.
    # CL(X) = CL_b(X) U CL_u(X)
    print("Strategy: Partition CL(X) into bounded (CL_b(X)) and unbounded (CL_u(X)) subsets.")

    # Step 3: Find a space X where this partition creates a separation.
    # This happens if X is "metrically coarse":
    #   (1) Bounded subsets of X are totally bounded.
    #   (2) X is not totally bounded.
    # A candidate space X with these properties is a non-Archimedean Banach space,
    # e.g., c_0(Q_p), the space of p-adic null sequences.
    print("For a 'metrically coarse' ultrametric space X (like c_0(Q_p)):")
    print("  - CL_b(X) is an open set in CL(X).")
    print("  - CL_u(X) is an open set in CL(X).")
    print("This means CL(X) has at least 2 connected components.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 4: Check if these two components are internally connected.
    # For a normed space like c_0(Q_p), one can construct paths.
    #   - Any two sets in CL_b(X) can be connected.
    #   - Any two sets in CL_u(X) can be connected.
    print("For X = c_0(Q_p):")
    print("  - The component CL_b(X) is path-connected.")
    print("  - The component CL_u(X) is path-connected.")
    print("Therefore, for this choice of X, CL(X) has exactly 2 components.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 5: Argue why the number cannot be 1.
    # If CL(X) were connected, it could not be separated as above. This would
    # typically happen if X were compact.
    # But for compact ultrametric spaces (like the p-adic integers Z_p),
    # a known theorem states that CL(X) is totally disconnected (zero-dimensional),
    # meaning its components are singletons, so the number of components is infinite.
    # So, the number of components cannot be 1.
    print("Final Argument:")
    print("  - The number of components cannot be 1.")
    print("  - We have constructed an example where the number of components is 2.")
    
    number_of_components = 2
    print(f"\nThe smallest possible number of connected components is {number_of_components}.")
