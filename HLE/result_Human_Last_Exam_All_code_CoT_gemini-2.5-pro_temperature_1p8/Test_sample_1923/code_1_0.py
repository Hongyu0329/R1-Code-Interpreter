# This script calculates the hypothetical shift in the apparent center of gravity
# based on the assumption in option C.

# --- Parameters for a planet like Earth ---
# Gravitational constant G in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2
G = 6.674e-11
# Mass of the Sun (Mass 1) in kg
M_sun = 1.989e30
# Average orbital distance of Earth (Mass 2) in meters (1 AU)
r = 1.496e11
# Eccentricity of Earth's orbit
e = 0.0167
# Speed of light (propagation speed of gravity) in m/s
c = 3.0e8

# --- Calculations ---
# Calculate the average orbital velocity of Earth
# v = sqrt(GM/r)
v_orbit_avg = math.sqrt(G * M_sun / r)

# The radial velocity (vr) is maximum when the planet is at the semi-latus rectum of the orbit.
# The maximum radial velocity is approximately eccentricity * average_velocity.
v_r_max = e * v_orbit_avg

# Assumption C states field strength varies inversely with apparent propagation time.
# We model this as an effective shift. The asymmetry in force between approach and
# recession is proportional to 2 * vr / c.
# We formulate a hypothetical equation for the apparent linear shift 'd'.
# Final Equation: d = r * (2 * v_r_max / c)

shift_factor = (2 * v_r_max) / c
apparent_shift_d = r * shift_factor

# --- Output the results ---
