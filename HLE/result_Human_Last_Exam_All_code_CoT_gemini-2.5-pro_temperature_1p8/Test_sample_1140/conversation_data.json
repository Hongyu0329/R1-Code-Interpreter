    "Of course. Here is my analysis of the problem and the recommended synthesis technique, presented in the form of an advisory Python script.\n\nMy plan is to first analyze the problem's constraints: a long peptide (100 amino acids) that contains an unnatural amino acid (UAA). Then, I will evaluate the suitability of three major synthesis techniques:\n1.  **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):** A purely chemical method.\n2.  **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** A hybrid chemical-biological method.\n3.  **Recombinant Expression with Genetic Code Expansion:** A purely biological method that has been adapted for UAAs.\n\nBased on this analysis, the script will provide a clear recommendation for the most helpful technique, explaining the reasoning behind the choice. The script will use print statements to display the information in a clear, readable format.\n\n```python\n# peptide_synthesis_advisor.py\n\ndef suggest_synthesis_technique():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the synthesis challenge for a long peptide with an unnatural amino acid\n    and recommends the most suitable technique.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Problem Definition ---\n    peptide_length = 100\n    unnatural_amino_acid = \"Azido Phenylalanine (pAzF)\"\n    sequence_snippet = \"M...[KAVCLXVIGATR[...]A\"\n    \n    # --- Introduction ---\n    print(\"--- Peptide Synthesis Strategy Advisor ---\")\n    print(f\"\\nTask: Recommend a synthesis method for a {peptide_length}aa peptide.\")\n    print(f\"Special requirement: Site-specific incorporation of an unnatural amino acid, '{unnatural_amino_acid}'.\")\n\n    # --- Analysis of Techniques ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Analysis of Potential Techniques ---\")\n\n    # 1.
