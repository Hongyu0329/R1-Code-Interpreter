    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** The molecule is toluene, which has the chemical formula C7H8. This means we have 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Understand the 6-31G basis set:** This notation tells us how many functions are used for each atomic orbital.\n    *   **For Hydrogen (H):** It only has a 1s valence orbital. The \"31\" part means this valence orbital is represented by two contracted Gaussian functions.\n    *   **For Carbon (C):**\n        *   **Core orbital (1s):** The '6' indicates the 1s core orbital is represented by one contracted function.\n        *   **Valence orbitals (2s, 2p):** The \"31\" part means each valence orbital is split into two contracted functions. Since carbon has one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals (px, py, pz), this results in `4 valence orbitals * 2 = 8` functions.\n        *   **Total for Carbon:** 1 (from 1s core) + 8 (from 2s, 2p valence) = 9 contracted functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** We multiply the number of each type of atom by the number of functions it contributes and sum the results.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this calculation and print the breakdown.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_C = 7\nnum_H = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Hydrogen (H): The 1s orbital is split into 2 functions (3G, 1G).\nfuncs_per_H = 2\n\n# For Carbon (C):\n# Core (1s): Represented by 1 function (6G).\n# Valence (2s, 2p): Each of the 4 valence orbitals is split into 2 functions (3G, 1G).\n# Total for C = 1 (core) + 4 * 2 (valence) = 9 functions.\nfuncs_per_C = 9\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from Carbon atoms\ntotal_C = num_C * funcs_per_C\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from Hydrogen atoms\ntotal_H = num_H * funcs_per_H\n\n# Calculate the total for the entire molecule\ntotal_funcs = total_C + total_H\n\n# Print the explanation and the final equation\nprint(\"Calculation for toluene (C7H8) with 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"Number of Carbon atoms: {num_C}\")\nprint(f\"Number of Hydrogen atoms: {num_H}\")\nprint(f\"Contracted functions per Carbon atom: {funcs_per_C}\")\nprint(f\"Contracted functions per Hydrogen atom: {funcs_per_H}\")\nprint(\"\\nTotal number of contracted Gaussian functions:\")\nprint(f\"({num_C} * {funcs_per_C}) + ({num_H} * {funcs_per_H}) = {total_C} + {total_H} = {total_funcs}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
