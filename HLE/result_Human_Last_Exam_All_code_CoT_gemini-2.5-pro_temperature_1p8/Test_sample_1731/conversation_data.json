    "This task requires us to find the equilibrium values for the mean energy (E) and entropy (S) for a system of photons (light quanta in the Bose case) using principles from large deviation theory.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Theoretical Connection**: I will first explain how large deviation theorems like Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the principles of statistical mechanics. The core idea is that the equilibrium state of a system is its most probable macroscopic state. Large deviation theory shows that maximizing entropy (Boltzmann's principle) is equivalent to finding this most probable state. The constraint on the mean energy introduces a parameter, the temperature, analogous to the Chernoff bound framework.\n2.  **Physical Model**: For light quanta (photons), they follow Bose-Einstein statistics. The equilibrium distribution that results from maximizing the entropy is the Planck distribution. The number of photons is not conserved, which sets their chemical potential to zero.\n3.  **Calculation**:\n    *   **Mean Energy (E)**: The equilibrium mean energy is found by integrating the energy density, given by Planck's law, over all frequencies. This involves calculating a well-known definite integral.\n    *   **Entropy (S)**: Once the energy E is known as a function of temperature T, the entropy S can be derived using the fundamental thermodynamic relation for a photon gas, $S = (4/3) E/T$.\n4.  **Python Implementation**: I will use the `sympy` library in Python to perform the symbolic integration and derive the final formulas for E and S. The code will define the necessary physical constants as symbols and construct the final equations.\n\nHere is the python code to perform the derivations.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_equilibrium_values():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives the equilibrium values for mean energy (E) and entropy (S)\n    for a photon gas using symbolic mathematics.\n\n    The derivation is based on large deviation principles which justify maximizing\n    the Bose-Einstein entropy, leading to Planck's law for energy distribution.\n    The equilibrium mean energy is the integral of this distribution over all frequencies.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
