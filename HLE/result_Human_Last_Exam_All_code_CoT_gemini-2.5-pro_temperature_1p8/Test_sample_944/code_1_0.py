    This function analyzes the topological problem about cyclic elements.

    Problem breakdown:
    - X is a Peano continuum (compact, connected, locally-connected metric space).
    - A cyclic element S is a maximal connected subset of X with no cut-points.
    - We want the maximum cardinality of the set of points in S that also belong to other cyclic elements.

    Analysis steps:
    1. A simple case is a figure-eight, composed of two cyclic elements (loops) L1 and L2 meeting at a point p.
       If we take S = L1, the set of its points in other cyclic elements is {p}.
       The cardinality in this case is 1.

    2. A more complex case is a chain of three cyclic elements: a loop L1, an arc A, and a loop L2.
       L1 intersects A at a point p. A intersects L2 at a point q.
       The cyclic elements are L1, A, and L2.
       - If S = L1, it intersects only A at {p}. Cardinality is 1.
       - If S = A, it intersects L1 at {p} and L2 at {q}. The set is {p, q}.
       The cardinality in this case is 2.

    3. Attempts to construct a valid space where a cyclic element intersects three or more others fail.
       The candidate for the central cyclic element (e.g., an arc with three attachment points) turns
       out not to be maximal, as it can be combined with one of the attached elements to form a
       larger set that still has no cut-points.

    4. Conclusion: The maximum number of such points appears to be 2.

    The final equation is essentially finding the maximum of the demonstrated cases.
