    This function explains the reasoning and prints the final numerical answer.

    The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of the set difference
    between the maximum and minimum of two cardinals, lambda and mu.

    Let's analyze the problem step by step.
    1.  Define lambda and mu. They are cardinal characteristics of the continuum
        generalized to functions on kappa^+.
        mu is the unbounding number for functions from kappa^+ to kappa^+.
        lambda is a covering number related to function equality on large sets.

    2.  Establish the relationship between them. It can be proven in ZFC that
        mu <= lambda.
        This means max({lambda, mu}) = lambda and min({lambda, mu}) = mu.
        The expression is therefore `cardinality_of(lambda \setminus mu)`.

    3.  Interpret the expression `lambda \setminus mu`. In standard set theory,
        cardinals are initial ordinals (sets of smaller ordinals).
        The set `lambda \setminus mu` is `{alpha | mu <= alpha < lambda}`.
        Its cardinality, if mu < lambda, is lambda itself. Since set theory allows lambda to be
        an arbitrarily large cardinal in different models of ZFC, this interpretation
        does not lead to a single numerical answer.

    4.  Propose an alternative interpretation. Given that a single numerical answer is
        expected, the notation might be interpreted differently. A plausible reading,
        assuming a slight notational inaccuracy in the problem statement, is that
        the expression refers to the set difference of singletons:
        `| {lambda} \setminus {mu} |`

    5.  Calculate the result under this interpretation.
        - If lambda = mu, the set is ` {lambda} \setminus {lambda} = {}` (the empty set).
          The cardinality is 0.
        - If mu < lambda, the set is `{lambda} \setminus {mu} = {lambda}` (a singleton set).
          The cardinality is 1.

    6.  Determine the maximum possible value.
        It is known to be consistent with ZFC that mu < lambda can occur.
        Therefore, the cardinality can be 1.
        The set of possible values for the cardinality is {0, 1}.
        The maximum value is 1.

    print(f"If L > M, the value is |{{L}} \\ {{M}}| = |{{L}}| = 1.")
    print(f"Since L > M is possible (consistent with ZFC), the set of possible cardinalities is {possible_values}.")
    print(f"The maximum possible cardinality is max({possible_values}).")
