# The user wants me to identify the number of chemotypes from the R script.
# This doesn't require running code, but a logical analysis of the provided script.

# Analysis of the control group:
# The call is `generate_chemistry(360, 340, 'control')`.
# The `treatment` parameter is fixed to 'control'.
# Inside the function, all 360 specimens are generated from the same statistical distributions.
# A single `baseline` vector is created.
# This same `baseline` is subtracted from all 360 specimens.
# Therefore, all specimens in the control group are processed identically and belong to one statistical group.
# Expected chemotypes for control group: 1

# Analysis of the water_stress group:
# The call is `generate_chemistry(510, 340, 'water_stress')`.
# The logic is identical to the control group.
# All 510 specimens are generated and processed identically within this function call.
# They belong to a single statistical group, different from the control group but internally consistent.
# Expected chemotypes for water_stress group: 1

control_chemotypes = 1
water_stress_chemotypes = 1

print(f"Based on the analysis of the R script, the data generation process for the 'control' group creates a single, homogeneous set of specimens. Therefore, we should expect {control_chemotypes} chemotype for the control group.")
print(f"Similarly, the process for the 'water_stress' group also creates a single, homogeneous set. Therefore, we should expect {water_stress_chemotypes} chemotype for the water-stressed group.")
print(f"The resulting answer is {control_chemotypes} for the control group and {water_stress_chemotypes} for the water-stressed group.")
