    Solves the theoretical social network analysis problem.

    The core of the problem is to determine the minimum number of rewiring
    operations, m(n), to transform a small-world network into an ultra-small
    world network.

    Let's analyze the change in the average path length, L(G).
    """

    # 1. Define the initial and final states of the average path length L.
    # The problem states we go from a small-world network to an ultra-small one.
    L_initial = "O(log(n))"
    L_final = "O(log(log(n)))"

    # For large n, log(n) is much larger than log(log(n)).

    # 2. Estimate the impact of a single rewiring operation on L.
    # A single operation, R(G), removes one edge and adds another. This is a small,
    # local change. Its effect on the *average* path length over all n(n-1) pairs
    # of vertices will be small.
    # The sum of all pairwise shortest paths is n(n-1)L. A single edge change
    # affects the shortest path for a limited number of pairs, and the change for
    # each path is at most O(log(n)). A reasonable estimate is that the total sum
    # changes by O(n*log(n)).
    # The change in the average L is this sum divided by n^2.
    delta_L_per_rewire = "O(n*log(n) / n^2) = O(log(n)/n)"

    # 3. Calculate m(n), the number of operations needed.
    # This can be estimated by dividing the total required change by the change per step.
