    "My plan is to identify the novel and author based on the details provided in your question. The specific quote, \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve,\" and the description of the author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" are key clues. I will search for these phrases in connection with Jorge Luis Borges's essays and prologues. Once the novel and author are identified, I will write a Python script to print this information as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_borges_reference():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the user's literary question\n    by printing the details of the novel and author Borges referred to.\n    \"\"\"\n    novel_title_spanish = \"El astillero\"\n    novel_title_english = \"The Shipyard\"\n    author_name = \"Juan Carlos Onetti\"\n    \n    print(f\"The novel Jorge Luis Borges refers to is '{novel_title_spanish}' (in English: '{novel_title_english}').\")\n    print(f\"The author, whom he described as a continuator and simplifier of Faulkner, is {author_name}.\")\n    print(\"\\nBorges made these remarks in his prologue to the 1961 edition of the novel.\")\n\nfind_borges_reference()\n```\n<<<El astillero>>>"
