def solve_bvp_conditions():
    """
    Calculates the number of solvability conditions for the given boundary-value problem.

    The problem decouples into scalar equations. We analyze two cases based on the
    coefficient a_k(t) in the k-th equation x_k'(t) = a_k(t) * x_k(t) + f_k(t).

    Case 1: a_k(t) = tanh(t) for k = 1, ..., 2024.
    - The homogeneous equation x' = tanh(t)x only has the trivial (zero) bounded solution.
    - For the non-homogeneous equation to have a bounded solution, two conditions must be met:
      1. An orthogonality condition on the forcing term f_k(t):
         integral from -inf to inf of (f_k(t) * sech(t)) dt = 0.
      2. The resulting unique bounded solution x_k(t) must satisfy the boundary condition
         x_k(2024) - x_k(2023) = alpha_k.
    - This gives 2 conditions for each of these 2024 equations.

    Case 2: a_k(t) = -tanh(t) for k > 2024.
    - The homogeneous equation x' = -tanh(t)x has a family of bounded solutions C*sech(t).
    - This free parameter C allows the boundary condition to be satisfied for any
      given f_k(t) and alpha_k.
    - Therefore, there are 0 conditions for these equations.

    The total number of conditions is the sum from all equations.
