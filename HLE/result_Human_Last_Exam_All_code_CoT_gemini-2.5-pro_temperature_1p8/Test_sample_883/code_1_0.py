# 1. Analyze Al1
kcat_control = kcat_values["Control"]
kcat_al1 = kcat_values["Al1"]
print("\nStep 1: Analyzing the function of Al1")
print(f"The kcat of the control reaction is {kcat_control}/s.")
print(f"With Al1 added, the kcat increases to {kcat_al1}/s.")
print(f"Conclusion: Since {kcat_al1} > {kcat_control}, Al1 functions as an activator of Zma1.")

# 2. Analyze Rga1
kcat_rga1 = kcat_values["Rga1"]
print("\nStep 2: Analyzing the function of Rga1")
print(f"With Rga1 added, the kcat decreases from {kcat_control}/s to {kcat_rga1}/s.")
print(f"Conclusion: Since {kcat_rga1} < {kcat_control}, Rga1 functions as an inhibitor of Zma1.")

# 3. Determine the type of inhibition for Rga1
kcat_rga1_plus_A = kcat_values["Rga1_plus_A"]
print("\nStep 3: Determining the type of inhibition for Rga1")
print(f"The kcat with Rga1 is {kcat_rga1}/s.")
print(f"When excess substrate (Molecule A) is added, the kcat remains {kcat_rga1_plus_A}/s.")
print(f"Conclusion: Since adding more substrate does not reverse the inhibition ({kcat_rga1_plus_A} is not higher than {kcat_rga1}), Rga1 is not a competitive inhibitor. This strongly suggests it is an irreversible or non-competitive inhibitor.")

# 4. Analyze the interaction between Al1 and Al2
kcat_al2 = kcat_values["Al2"]
kcat_al1_al2 = kcat_values["Al1_Al2"]
print("\nStep 4: Analyzing the interaction between Al1 and Al2")
print(f"The kcat with the inhibitor Al2 alone is {kcat_al2}/s.")
print(f"The kcat with both the activator Al1 and inhibitor Al2 is {kcat_al1_al2}/s.")
print(f"Conclusion: The final activity is dominated by the inhibitor. Since {kcat_al1_al2} == {kcat_al2}, this indicates that Al1 and Al2 likely compete for the same allosteric site on the enzyme.")

# 5. Evaluate the best answer choice
print("\n--- Final Evaluation ---")
print("Based on the analysis:")
print("- Al1 is an allosteric activator.")
print("- Al2 is an allosteric inhibitor.")
print("- Rga1 is best described as an irreversible inhibitor because substrate cannot overcome its effect.")
print("- Al1 and Al2 compete for the same binding site.")
print("\nThis aligns perfectly with Answer Choice C.")
print("\nChoice C states: 'Al1 and Al2 function as allosteric modulators for Zma1. Al1 and Al2 bind to the same site on Zma1. Rga1 is an irreversible inhibitor.'")
