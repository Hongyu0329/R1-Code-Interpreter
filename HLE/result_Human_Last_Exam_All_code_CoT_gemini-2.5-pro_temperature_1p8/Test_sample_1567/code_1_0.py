    Solves the theoretical problem about the controlled random walk.

    The problem asks for the maximal number of measures, k, such that for any
    choice of k genuinely d-dimensional, zero-mean probability measures, it is
    impossible to control the walk to guarantee a return to the origin.

    The reasoning is as follows:

    1.  A controlled random walk in d >= 3 can be made recurrent if and only if
        the controller can make the walk's steps effectively degenerate. This means
        the walk can be restricted to a lower-dimensional subspace. Mathematically,
        this is possible if and only if the convex hull of the covariance matrices
        of the available measures contains a singular matrix.

    2.  The problem states that each measure nu_i is "genuinely d-dimensional".
        For a zero-mean measure, this means the vectors in its support span the
        entire d-dimensional space.

    3.  This condition implies that the covariance matrix Sigma_i corresponding
        to each measure nu_i is positive definite. A matrix A is positive definite
        if v^T * A * v > 0 for all non-zero vectors v. For a covariance matrix
        Sigma_i, v^T * Sigma_i * v = E[(v.X)^2], which is strictly positive if the
        support of X is not confined to a hyperplane orthogonal to v.

    4.  The set of positive definite matrices is a convex cone. This means that any
        convex combination of positive definite matrices is also positive definite.
        A controller's strategy amounts to choosing an effective covariance matrix
        Sigma from the convex hull of {Sigma_1, ..., Sigma_k}.
        Sigma = alpha_1*Sigma_1 + ... + alpha_k*Sigma_k.
        Since each Sigma_i is positive definite, any such combined Sigma will also
        be positive definite.

    5.  A positive definite matrix is always non-singular.

    6.  Therefore, the condition for forcing recurrence (finding a singular matrix
        in the convex hull of the covariance matrices) can never be met, as long
        as the measures are genuinely d-dimensional.

    7.  This conclusion does not depend on the number of measures, k. It holds
        for any finite k >= 1. Since the property holds for all finite k,
        there is no maximal finite k.

    The answer is therefore infinity.
