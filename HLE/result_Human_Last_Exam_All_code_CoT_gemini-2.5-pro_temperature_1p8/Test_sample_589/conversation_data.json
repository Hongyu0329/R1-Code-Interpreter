    "My plan to identify the film is as follows:\n1.  Deconstruct the user's query into key descriptive elements:\n    *   Film Type: Hollywood feature film from a major studio.\n    *   Character: A teenager.\n    *   Object: A pink bicycle.\n    *   Action: Pedaling directly toward an oncoming vehicle.\n2.  Search for films that contain these specific elements in combination.\n3.  The most prominent and memorable scene that matches this description occurs in the 2004 film *Napoleon Dynamite*.\n4.  I will confirm the details of the scene:\n    *   The film was distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures and Paramount Pictures, which are major players.\n    *   The character Napoleon Dynamite is a high school teenager.\n    *   In a scene where he needs a ride, he \"borrows\" a small, pink Huffy bicycle with streamers.\n    *   While riding it, a large truck comes up behind him and honks. In frustration, Napoleon deliberately swerves in front of the truck, causing the driver to slam on the brakes to avoid hitting him. This fits the description of a teenager on a pink bike moving toward a vehicle, causing a confrontation.\n5.  I will then write a Python script to print the name of this film.\n\n```python\n# This script will print the name of the movie that features the described scene.\n# The scene involves the main character, a teenager, riding a pink children's bike.\n# He swerves in front of a truck that is trying to run him off the road.\n\nmovie_title = \"Napoleon Dynamite\"\nprint(movie_title)\n```\n<<<Napoleon Dynamite>>>"
