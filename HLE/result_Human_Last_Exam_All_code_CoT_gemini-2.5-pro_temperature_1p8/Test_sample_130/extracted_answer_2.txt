The edges are smoothed, and the boundary moves according to its local curvature. Specifically, convex corners of a region are eroded, while concave corners are filled in. This is analogous to a process called mean curvature flow. As t→∞, this smoothing process continues, small or thin regions are eliminated, and the image converges to a constant state, which is almost always a solid image of a single color (either all black or all white).
