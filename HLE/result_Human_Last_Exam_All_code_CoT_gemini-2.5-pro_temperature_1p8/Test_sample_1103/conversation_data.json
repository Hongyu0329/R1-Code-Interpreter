    "This is a well-known problem in algebraic number theory, specifically the Gauss class number problem for imaginary quadratic fields. Computing this from first principles is a highly complex task that involves advanced mathematics and significant computational power, far beyond a simple script. The problem was definitively solved for class numbers up to 100 by M. Watkins in his 2004 paper, \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields\".\n\nTherefore, instead of attempting a direct computation, we can rely on this established mathematical result. The following Python code prints the known answer to your question.\n\n```python\ndef solve_class_number_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides the solution to the Gauss class number problem for h=48.\n\n    The number of negative fundamental discriminants for a given class number\n    is a result from advanced number theory. A direct computation is not feasible\n    in a simple script. We rely on the known results published by mathematicians.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The target class number\n    class_number = 48\n    \n    # According to M.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
