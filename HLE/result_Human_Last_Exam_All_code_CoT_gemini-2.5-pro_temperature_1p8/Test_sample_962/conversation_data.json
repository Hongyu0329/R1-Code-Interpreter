    "Of course. Designing a secure and efficient threshold signature scheme is a complex task at the forefront of modern cryptography. I will provide a conceptual Python implementation to illustrate the design principles of such a scheme.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Choose a Scheme:** I will model the code based on the **FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures)** protocol. FROST is a prominent t-out-of-n scheme known for its two-round signing protocol and its security properties.\n2.  **Simulate Cryptographic Primitives:** Implementing real elliptic curve cryptography from scratch is complex and error-prone. Instead, I will simulate the cryptographic group operations using modular arithmetic. This keeps the focus on the protocol's structure and logic rather than the low-level math.\n3.  **Phase 1: Key Generation:** I'll simulate a trusted dealer performing a Distributed Key Generation (DKG). The dealer creates a secret polynomial, and each of the `n` participants receives a secret share. The group's public key is also computed.\n4.  **Phase 2: Signing (Two Rounds):**\n    *   **Round 1 (Commitment):** A threshold `t` of participants will generate nonces and exchange public commitments to these nonces.\n    *   **Round 2 (Signing):** After receiving all commitments, each participant calculates their partial signature.\n5.  **Phase 3: Aggregation:** A signature aggregator (this can be any party, even one of the signers) collects `t` partial signatures and combines them into the final, single group signature.\n6.  **Verification:** Finally, I'll demonstrate how anyone can verify the final signature using only the group's public key, the message, and the signature itself.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This code is for **educational purposes only**. It is a simplified simulation and is **NOT CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY SECURE**. Do not use this code in a production environment. Real-world implementations require secure random number generation, constant-time arithmetic, and robust elliptic curve libraries.\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\nimport random\n\n# --- Cryptographic Primitives Simulation ---\n# We will use modular arithmetic on a large prime number to simulate\n# an elliptic curve group.
