    # Introduction to the counting method.
    # The problem is equivalent to counting isomorphism classes of \'etale algebras L
    # of rank 4 over Q, unramified outside the prime 2, whose Galois group G
    # (as a subgroup of S_4) is not contained in any conjugate of the dihedral group D_4.

    # Allowed Galois groups G are those not isomorphic to a subgroup of D_4.
    # These are C_3, S_3, A_4, and S_4.

    # For each allowed group G, we count the number of corresponding \'etale algebras
    # unramified outside 2. This count is based on the number of Galois extensions
    # of Q unramified outside 2, denoted N(G). These values are taken from
    # number theory databases (e.g., Jones-Roberts, LMFDB).

    # Case 1: Galois group G = C_3
    # An algebra with G=C_3 corresponds to a C_3-cubic field extension of Q.
    # The number of C_3-extensions of Q unramified outside 2 is N(C_3) = 0.
    num_C3 = 0

    # Case 2: Galois group G = S_3
    # An algebra with G=S_3 corresponds to an S_3-cubic field.
    # The number of S_3-extensions of Q unramified outside 2 is N(S_3) = 1.
    # Each S_3 extension gives rise to a single isomorphism class of a relevant algebra.
    num_S3 = 1

    # Case 3: Galois group G = A_4
    # An algebra with G=A_4 corresponds to an A_4-quartic field.
    # The number of A_4-extensions of Q unramified outside 2 is N(A_4) = 0.
    num_A4 = 0

    # Case 4: Galois group G = S_4
    # An algebra with G=S_4 corresponds to an S_4-quartic field.
    # The number of S_4-extensions of Q unramified outside 2 is N(S_4) = 3.
    # Each S_4 extension gives rise to a single isomorphism class of a relevant algebra.
    num_S4 = 3

    # The total number is the sum of the counts for each allowed group.
    total_surfaces = num_C3 + num_S3 + num_A4 + num_S4
