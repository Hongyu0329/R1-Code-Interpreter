# Step 1: Define the value of m, the number of stable equilibrium points.
# Based on the analysis of the differential equation x'(t) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x,
# the only stable equilibrium point is x=0.
# So, m = 1.
m = 1

# Step 2: Define the exponent.
exponent = 4048

# Step 3: Calculate 2 to the power of the exponent.
power_of_two = 2**exponent

# Step 4: Calculate the final expression m - 2^4048.
result = m - power_of_two

# Step 5: Print the final equation and its result.
# The result is a very large negative number, which Python handles automatically.
print(f"{m} - 2^{exponent} = {result}")
