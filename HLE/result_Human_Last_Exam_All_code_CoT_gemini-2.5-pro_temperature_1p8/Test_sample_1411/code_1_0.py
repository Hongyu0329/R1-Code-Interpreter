    # The most famous watch worn by Steve McQueen is the Heuer Monaco, reference 1133,
    # which he wore in the 1971 film 'Le Mans'. This is the watch that is
    # invariably linked to his name in high-profile auctions.

    # find what is written directly above this window.

    # Step 3: Determine the text and provide the answer.
    # Looking at the dial of the Heuer Monaco 1133, the word "chronograph"
    # is printed just above the date window.
