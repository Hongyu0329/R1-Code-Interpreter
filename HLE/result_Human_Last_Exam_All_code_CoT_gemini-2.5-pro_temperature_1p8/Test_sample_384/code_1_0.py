Step-by-step Analysis:

1.  **Analyze Option A (Fujibayashi's Deliberate Removal):** This suggests the original compiler, Fujibayashi, removed the content. His goal in creating the Bansenshukai was to preserve Iga and Koga ninja knowledge for his descendants. Deliberately erasing a section of this knowledge is contradictory to his primary purpose. It would have been far simpler to omit the section altogether if he sought to discredit it. This option presents a logical inconsistency in the author's motivation.

2.  **Analyze Option B (Transcriber Self-Censorship):** This is plausible. During the strict, neo-Confucian Edo period, transcribers might have found techniques involving seduction or deceit morally inappropriate for women and chosen to censor them, leaving placeholders.

3.  **Analyze Option C (Lady Saigō Conspiracy):** This is less plausible due to the timeline. The Bansenshukai was written in 1676, nearly a century after Lady Saigō's death (1589). While not impossible, redacting a manual to protect a reputation from events that far in the past is a weaker motive compared to others.

4.  **Analyze Option D (Oniwaban Redaction):** This is highly plausible. The Oniwaban, the shogunate's elite intelligence group, would have considered active kunoichi techniques to be state secrets. Redacting them from copied manuals would be a logical step to maintain operational security.

5.  **Analyze Option E (Invisible Ink):** This is plausible. Invisible ink (*aburidashi*) was a known ninja technique. If the original used it, uninitiated scribes would not have been able to read the text and would have marked the section with blank circles.

6.  **Analyze Option F (Mnemonic Device):** This is highly plausible. Ninjutsu was heavily reliant on oral tradition. The circles could be a symbolic code or memory aid, meaningless to outsiders but understood by initiated ninja who had received direct teaching.

7.  **Analyze Option G (Physical Deterioration):** This is plausible. A frequently referenced section of a manuscript could easily suffer from wear and tear, making the characters illegible. Conscientious scribes would use placeholders to show that content was lost rather than inventing it.

8.  **Analyze Option H (Misinterpreted Esoteric Symbols):** This is plausible and similar to option F. It suggests the circles are not placeholders but symbols with a lost esoteric meaning related to concepts like the Kujiho or Taoist energy flow.

Conclusion:
Comparing all options, Option A is the least plausible. It presents a fundamental contradiction: the author, whose goal was to preserve a comprehensive body of knowledge, deliberately sabotaging his own work. The other explanations, while speculative, align better with the historical context, the nature of secret societies, and the practicalities of manuscript transmission. The motive in Option A is the most illogical and inconsistent with the creator's documented purpose.
