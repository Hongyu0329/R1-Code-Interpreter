    # Step 1: Establish general bounds for kappa, the cardinality of a MAD family.

    print("  A MAD family is a collection of subsets of ω, so its size κ cannot exceed |P(ω)| = 2^ω.")
    print("  A MAD family cannot be finite, so its size κ must be at least ω.")
    print("  Therefore, in ZFC, we have: ω ≤ κ ≤ 2^ω.\n")

    print("Step 2: Applying the Continuum Hypothesis (CH)")
    print("  We are given 2^ω = ω_1.")
    print("  Substituting this into our inequality gives: ω ≤ κ ≤ ω_1.\n")

    # Step 3: Use the theorem on the minimum size of a MAD family.
    print("Step 3: The minimum cardinality of a MAD family (a)")
    print("  A key theorem in ZFC states that no countable family of almost disjoint sets can be maximal.")
    print("  This means the minimum cardinality of a MAD family, a, must be uncountable.")
    print("  So, a > ω. Since a is a cardinal, this implies a ≥ ω_1.\n")
    
    # Step 4: Combine all inequalities to determine kappa.

    print("  The cardinality κ of any MAD family must be at least a.")
    print("  So, we combine a ≥ ω_1 and κ ≥ a with the result from Step 2:")

    # Step 5: Conclude the value of kappa and the set X.
    print("Step 5: Deducing the set X")
