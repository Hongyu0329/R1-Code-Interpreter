             "For standard points, x₀ ~ x₁ implies x₀ = x₁, so the statement is trivially true for any function, not just continuous ones.",

        'B': "This condition, ∀ x₀ ∈ X, ∀ x₁ ∈ X*: x₀ ~ x₁ ⇒ f(x₀) ~ f(x₁), is the correct nonstandard definition of continuity. "
             "It states that the function f preserves the infinitesimal closeness relation between a nonstandard point x₁ and a standard point x₀. "
             "This precisely captures the idea that as an input approaches a standard point, the output approaches the image of that point.",

        'C': "This condition, ∀ x₀, x₁ ∈ X*: x₀ ~ x₁ ⇒ f(x₀) ~ f(x₁), is known as S-continuity or microcontinuity. "
             "It is a stronger condition than continuity. It requires the property to hold for any pair of infinitesimally close points, "
             "including those 'at infinity'. Not all continuous functions have this property (e.g., f(x)=x²).",

        'D': "This condition, ∀ x₀, x₁ ∈ X: f(x₀) ~ f(x₁) ⇒ x₀ ~ x₁, is equivalent to stating that f is injective (one-to-one) on standard points. "
             "This is a property of the function's structure, not its continuity.",

        'E': "This is the converse of B. A simple continuous function like f(x) = c (constant) provides a counterexample. f(0) ~ f(1) is true "
             "since both are c, but 0 ~ 1 is false.",

        'F': "This is the converse of C, and is an even stronger condition than E. It also fails for simple continuous functions like constant maps."
