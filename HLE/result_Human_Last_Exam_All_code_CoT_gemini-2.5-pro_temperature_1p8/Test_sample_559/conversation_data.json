    "In this problem, we are asked to find the separatrix for a given system of ordinary differential equations in the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$.\n\nA separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different qualitative behavior. These curves are often the stable or unstable manifolds associated with saddle points of the system.\n\nMy plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will find the equilibrium points of the system by setting the derivatives $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$ to zero.\n2.  Next, I will classify these equilibrium points by computing the Jacobian matrix of the system and analyzing its eigenvalues at each point. This will allow me to identify any saddle points.\n3.  The stable and unstable manifolds of any saddle points are the primary candidates for separatrices. I will search for an invariant algebraic curve that passes through a saddle point. An invariant curve is one where any solution starting on the curve remains on it for all time. Such a curve, if it's connected to a saddle, must be part of its stable or unstable manifold.\n4.  I will look for a simple polynomial relationship between $d$ and $u$, say $d = f(u)$, that satisfies the condition of being an invariant curve.\n5.  Once I identify such a curve that is also a manifold of the saddle point, I will present its equation as the separatrix.\n6.  The final Python code will be used to display this analytical result in a clear format, explicitly mentioning all the numerical coefficients and exponents in the equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the given system of ODEs to find the separatrix.\n    The analysis is done analytically, and the code prints the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The system of differential equations is:\n    # d'(t) = 2*d^2(t) + (-3*u(t) + 5*u^2(t))*d(t) - u^3(t)*(1-u(t))\n    # u'(t) = (u(t) - 1)*u^2(t)\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Find and classify equilibrium points.\n    # From u'(t) = 0, we get u=0 or u=1.\n    # For u=0, d'(t)=0 gives 2*d^2 = 0, so d=0.
