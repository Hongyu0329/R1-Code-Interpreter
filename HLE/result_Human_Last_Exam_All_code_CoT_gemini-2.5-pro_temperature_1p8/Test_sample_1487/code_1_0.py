# Based on the derivation, the term ||alpha||^2_l2 is (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1).
# The expression to evaluate is (2 * ||alpha||^2_l2) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10**15.

# Let's define the components of the final equation.
# The final equation is: Numerator / Denominator + Additive_Term

# Component 1: The term pi^2/6 - 1, which appears in both numerator and denominator.
pi_sq_over_6_minus_1 = (math.pi**2 / 6) - 1

# Component 2: The numerator of the fraction.
# Numerator = 2 * ||alpha||^2_l2 = 2 * (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1)
numerator = pi_sq_over_6_minus_1

# Component 3: The denominator of the fraction.
denominator = pi_sq_over_6_minus_1

# Component 4: The additive term.
additive_term = 10**15

# Now, we construct and evaluate the final expression.
# We print each number involved in the final equation.

print(f"Denominator = (pi^2/6 - 1) = {denominator}")
print(f"Additive_Term = {additive_term:.0e}") # Using scientific notation for clarity

# Calculate the result
result = (numerator / denominator) + additive_term

print("\nFinal Equation:")
print(f"({numerator} / {denominator}) + {additive_term:.0e} = {result}")

# Final Answer
print(f"\nThe value of the expression is: {result:.0f}")
