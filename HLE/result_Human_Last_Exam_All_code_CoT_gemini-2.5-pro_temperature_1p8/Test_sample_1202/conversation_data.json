    "To answer this question, I will analyze the provided mechanisms in the context of gene duplication. My plan is to write a Python script that evaluates each option and explains its role, or lack thereof, in the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. The script will follow a logical progression to identify the correct mechanism(s).\n\nHere is the thinking process that the script will follow:\n1.  **Define the Problem:** After a gene duplication event, there are two identical copies of a gene. The most common fate is that one copy will be lost through mutation (becoming a pseudogene) because there's no selective pressure to maintain it. The question asks for the mechanisms that allow *both* copies to be kept (*retention*) and to become different from each other (*divergence*).\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This process makes homologous DNA sequences more similar to each other. It works *against* divergence, so it's not the correct mechanism.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process of a gene copy becoming non-functional. This is a mechanism of gene *loss*, not the *retention* of two functional duplicates.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy keeps the original function, while the other acquires mutations that give it a brand new function. Natural selection then acts to preserve both copies. This directly explains both retention and divergence.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** In this model, the ancestral gene had multiple functions. After duplication, each copy loses a different sub-function through mutation. Now, both copies are required to perform the full range of the original gene's functions. This also explains both retention and divergence.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern of species diversification, not a specific molecular mechanism for what happens to a single duplicated gene within a genome.\n3.  **Formulate the Conclusion:** Based on the evaluation, both Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D) are major, well-accepted mechanisms responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. They represent the primary ways evolution preserves this raw genetic material. The other options are incorrect for the reasons stated above. As both C and D are valid, and the question asks for the most likely mechanism, I will have the code highlight that both are correct and select one as the final answer.\n\nTo satisfy the instruction \"output each number in the final equation\", the Python code will structure the explanation as a logical \"equation\" where each piece of evidence (numbered points) contributes to the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_gene_duplication_fates():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the potential fates of duplicated genes to answer the multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the answer choices\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Gene conversion',\n        'B': 'Pseudogenization',\n        'C': 'Neofunctionalization',\n        'D': 'Subfunctionalization',\n        'E': 'Adaptive radiation'\n    }\n\n    # The \"equation\" will be a series of logical steps leading to a conclusion.\n    print(\"Evaluating the mechanisms for duplicate gene retention and divergence:\\n\")\n    \n    # Point 1: Analyze Gene Conversion\n    point_1_num = 1\n    point_1_text = f\"Analysis of (A) {choices['A']}: This mechanism makes gene copies more similar. It actively works against the divergence of duplicate genes. Therefore, it is incorrect.\"\n    \n    # Point 2: Analyze Pseudogenization\n    point_2_num = 2\n    point_2_text = f\"Analysis of (B) {choices['B']}: This is the most common fate, where one copy becomes a non-functional pseudogene. This is a mechanism of gene LOSS, not the RETENTION of two functional genes as the question asks. Therefore, it is incorrect.\"\n    \n    # Point 3: Analyze Neofunctionalization\n    point_3_num = 3\n    point_3_text = f\"Analysis of (C) {choices['C']}: This is a key mechanism for retention. One copy keeps the original function while the other acquires a NEW beneficial function. Selection then preserves both copies, which diverge in sequence and function. This is a correct mechanism.\"\n    \n    # Point 4: Analyze Subfunctionalization\n    point_4_num = 4\n    point_4_text = f\"Analysis of (D) {choices['D']}: This is another key mechanism. The ancestral gene's functions are partitioned between the two copies. Both are now required to fulfill the original roles, ensuring their retention and allowing them to diverge. This is also a correct mechanism.\"\n\n    # Point 5: Analyze Adaptive Radiation\n    point_5_num = 5\n    point_5_text = f\"Analysis of (E) {choices['E']}: This is a macroevolutionary pattern of species diversification, not a molecular-level mechanism for gene retention within a genome. Therefore, it is incorrect.\"\n\n    # Print the \"equation\" of our logical steps\n    print(\"Logical Equation leading to the answer:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n    print(f\"Step {point_1_num}: {textwrap.fill(point_1_text, 80)}\")\n    print(f\"Step {point_2_num}: {textwrap.fill(point_2_text, 80)}\")\n    print(f\"Step {point_3_num}: {textwrap.fill(point_3_text, 80)}\")\n    print(f\"Step {point_4_num}: {textwrap.fill(point_4_text, 80)}\")\n    print(f\"Step {point_5_num}: {textwrap.fill(point_5_text, 80)}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n    \n    # Final Conclusion from the \"equation\"\n    final_conclusion_numbers = [point_3_num, point_4_num]\n    final_conclusion_letters = ['C', 'D']\n    print(f\"\\nCONCLUSION from steps {final_conclusion_numbers[0]} and {final_conclusion_numbers[1]}:\")\n    print(f\"Both {choices['C']} ({final_conclusion_letters[0]}) and {choices['D']} ({final_conclusion_letters[1]}) are the primary mechanisms responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\")\n    print(\"Both are considered correct answers in evolutionary genomics.
