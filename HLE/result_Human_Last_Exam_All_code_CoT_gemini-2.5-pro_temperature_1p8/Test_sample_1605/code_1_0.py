# The problem asks for the number of homeomorphism classes of compact metric spaces
# with a disconnection number equal to four.

# Let D(X) be the disconnection number of a space X.
# We are looking for the number of distinct topological structures (homeomorphism classes)
# for which D(X) = 4.

# Based on topological classification, the spaces are:
# 1. The simple triod (a 'Y' shape). A tree with 3 endpoints.
#    D(T) for a tree T is |endpoints| + 1. So 3+1 = 4.

# 2. The figure-eight graph. Two circles joined at one point.
#    Removing 3 points on one loop leaves it connected, so D > 3.
#    Removing any 4 points disconnects it, so D = 4.

# 3. The dumbbell graph. Two circles joined by an arc.
#    Removing 3 points on one circle leaves it connected, so D > 3.
#    Removing any 4 points disconnects it, so D = 4.

# 4. A circle with three simple arcs attached at three distinct points.
#    Topological analysis shows this has D = 4.

# 5. A circle with a 2-ended tree (a 'V' shape) and a simple arc attached at two distinct points.
#    This also has D = 4 and is not homeomorphic to the others.

# 6. A circle with a simple triod attached at its center to a single point on the circle.
#    This also has D = 4 and is not homeomorphic to the others.

# In total, there are 6 such distinct homeomorphism classes.
# The calculation is a result of topological theorems and classification, not a direct computation.
# Therefore, the code will simply output the final count.

count = 6
