    # Choice A: CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs than MA biotypes.
    # This is true because CA has 'high' activity and MA has 'low' activity.
    print("\nA. CA has enhanced RFO metabolism compared to MA.")
    print("   - Evaluation: Consistent with premises. (TRUE)")

    # Choice B: CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.
    # This is a direct statement from the text.
    print("\nB. CA prefers raffinose diet, MA prefers sucrose diet.")
    print("   - Evaluation: Directly stated in the text. (TRUE)")

    # Choice C: Upon host transfer, CA shows decreased galactosidase activity due to lower raffinose in cotton.
    # Moving from high raffinose (watermelon) to low raffinose (cotton) would reduce substrate, thus reducing activity.
    print("\nC. CA on cotton -> decreased galactosidase due to low raffinose.")
    print("   - Evaluation: Logical biological consequence. (TRUE)")
    
    # Choice D: Upon host transfer, CA shows decreased galactosidase activity due to higher glucose in cotton.
    # High glucose from sucrose can inhibit enzymes for other sugars (catabolite repression). A plausible mechanism.
    print("\nD. CA on cotton -> decreased galactosidase due to high glucose.")
    print("   - Evaluation: A plausible biological mechanism. (Likely TRUE)")

    # Choice E: Upon host transfer, MA shows increased galactosidase activity due to higher raffinose in watermelon.
    # MA is not adapted for raffinose. Its low activity is a fixed trait of its adaptation.
    # It would not be able to increase activity simply by being exposed to more substrate.
