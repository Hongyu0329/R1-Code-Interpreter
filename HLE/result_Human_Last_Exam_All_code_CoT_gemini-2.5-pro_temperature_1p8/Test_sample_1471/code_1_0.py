# The user wants to solve an equation with numbers from different systems.
# First, let's translate them into modern numbers.
# 四百九十六 is Chinese for 496.
# 𒌋𒌋𒌋 is Babylonian Cuneiform for 30 (10+10+10).
# 𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹 is Babylonian Cuneiform for 23 (10+10+1+1+1).
# The equation becomes: 496 / 30 - 23

# Assign the modern numbers to variables
num1 = 496
num2 = 30
num3 = 23

# Perform the calculation following the order of operations (division first)
result = num1 / num2 - num3

# Print the full equation with its solution
print(f"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}")
