def solve_pde_theory_questions():
    """
    This function provides answers to the theoretical questions about the
    Pohozaev identity and its relation to the energy functional J.

    The questions are:
    (a) True or false: If P(u, v) = 0, then (u, v) is necessarily a critical point of the energy functional J.
    (b) Is it true that for any (u, v) in H^{1,s}(R^2), there exists a unique t > 0 such that (u_t, v_t) is on the manifold P=0?
    (c) Must the minimiser of J on P(a,b)=0 satisfy the condition phi''(u,v)(1) < 0?

    The reasoning is as follows:
    (a) False. The Pohozaev identity P(u,v)=0 is a necessary condition for a solution, not a sufficient one. Many functions can satisfy this single scalar constraint without solving the full PDE J'(u,v)=0.
    (b) No. The existence of such a scaling factor 't' depends on the properties of the function (u,v) and the specific nature of the nonlinear terms (e.g., being positive). It is not guaranteed to exist for *any* function in the space.
    (c) Yes. This is a standard result in variational methods for finding ground states. The minimizer on the Pohozaev manifold corresponds to a saddle point of the energy functional J. The condition phi''(1)<0 reflects this saddle point structure, where the energy is a local maximum along the scaling direction.
