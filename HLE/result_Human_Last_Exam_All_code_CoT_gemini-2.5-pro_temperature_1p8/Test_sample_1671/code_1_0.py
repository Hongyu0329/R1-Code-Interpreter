    # Reasoning based on the text provided:
    # 1. The question asks for the recommended second-line therapy after a first-line regimen (trastuzumab + taxane) for HER2+ MBC.
    # 2. The text states: "Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines with category 1 evidence recommend THP as the preferred first-line regimen for HER2+ MBC."
    # 3. For the next step after progression, the text explicitly says: "Upon disease progression, TDXd is recommended in the second-line setting."
    # 4. The text also identifies TDXd: "famtrastuzumab deruxtecan (TDXd) is approved for HER2+ MBC."
    # 5. Comparing this to the options, Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan is the correct choice. The text also notes that tucatinib is a third-line option and T-DM1 (trastuzumab emtansine) has been replaced by TDXd as the second-line standard.
