    "To determine the Modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence, we need to trace the etymological path of the original Old English word.\n\n1.  **Identify the current word and its origin:** The Modern English word \"sister\" comes from the Old Norse word \"systir\". It was adopted into English during the period of Viking settlement in England, eventually replacing the native word.\n\n2.  **Identify the original Old English word:** The word used by the Anglo-Saxons before the Norse influence was \"sweostor\".\n\n3.  **Trace the evolution of \"sweostor\":** We can predict how \"sweostor\" would have changed by observing the evolution of other Old English words.\n    *   **Old English:** `sweostor`\n    *   **Middle English:** The \"eo\" vowel sound would likely have simplified, and the word became \"suster\". This form, \"suster\", existed in Middle English alongside the borrowed \"sister\".\n    *   **Modern English:** Without the strong competition from the Old Norse \"sister\", the native form \"suster\" would have likely continued its use. It would be pronounced similarly to words like \"custom\" or \"duster\". Cognates in related languages support this, such as Dutch `zuster` and the `suster` variant in Frisian.\n\nTherefore, the most probable Modern English word would be \"suster\".\n\nI will now generate a Python script to print this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and prints the likely Modern English word for \"sister\"\n    without Norse linguistic influence.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Explain the origin of the current word \"sister\".\n    current_word = \"sister\"\n    origin_word = \"systir\"\n    origin_language = \"Old Norse\"\n    \n    print(f\"The current Modern English word '{current_word}' is derived from the {origin_language} word '{origin_word}'.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Identify the original Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word.\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    print(f\"This Norse word replaced the original Old English word, which was '{old_english_word}'.\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Explain the likely evolution of the Old English word.\n    middle_english_form = \"suster\"\n    print(f\"\\nWithout Norse influence, '{old_english_word}' would have evolved naturally through Middle English.\")\n    print(f\"The well-documented Middle English form derived from '{old_english_word}' was '{middle_english_form}'.\")\n    \n    # Step 4: State the final conclusion.\n    final_word = \"suster\"\n    print(f\"\\nGiven this linguistic path, it is highly probable that if the Norse had never invaded,\")\n    print(f\"the Modern English word for sister would be '{final_word}'.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
