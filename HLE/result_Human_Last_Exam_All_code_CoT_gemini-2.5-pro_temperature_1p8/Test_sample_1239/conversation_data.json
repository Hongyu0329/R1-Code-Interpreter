    "To find the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify all the continuous transformations of time, space, velocity, and pressure that leave the form of the equations invariant. The dimension of the group is the total number of independent parameters (infinitesimal generators) for these transformations.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown of the symmetries:\n\n1.  **Time Translation (1 dimension):** The equations are autonomous (no explicit dependence on time), so shifting time $t \\to t + a$ is a symmetry. This contributes 1 dimension.\n2.  **Spatial Translations (3 dimensions):** The equations are homogeneous in space, so shifting the spatial coordinates $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}$ for any constant vector $\\mathbf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ is a symmetry. This contributes 3 dimensions.\n3.  **Spatial Rotations (3 dimensions):** The equations are isotropic, meaning rotating the spatial coordinates $\\mathbf{x} \\to R\\mathbf{x}$ (where $R$ is a rotation matrix) and the vector fields accordingly is a symmetry. The group of rotations in 3D, SO(3), is 3-dimensional.\n4.  **Galilean Boosts (3 dimensions):** Shifting to a reference frame moving at a constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ is a symmetry. This transformation is given by $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t$, $t \\to t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$. This is a 3-parameter family of transformations, corresponding to the three components of the velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$.\n5.  **Scaling (1 dimension):** There is a single scaling transformation that leaves the equations invariant:\n    $t \\to \\lambda^2 t$, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\lambda \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}$, $p \\to \\lambda^{-2} p$.\n    This is a one-parameter group, contributing 1 dimension.\n\nThe total dimension of the Lie group is the sum of the dimensions from each of these independent symmetry transformations. The following Python code calculates this sum.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the\n    3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n    The total dimension is the sum of the dimensions of the individual\n    symmetry transformations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dimension from time translation\n    dim_time_translation = 1\n\n    # Dimension from spatial translations in R^3\n    dim_spatial_translation = 3\n\n    # Dimension from spatial rotations in R^3 (SO(3))\n    dim_spatial_rotation = 3\n\n    # Dimension from Galilean boosts (velocity transformations)\n    dim_galilean_boosts = 3\n\n    # Dimension from scaling transformation\n    dim_scaling = 1\n\n    # The individual contributions\n    contributions = {\n        \"Time translation\": dim_time_translation,\n        \"Spatial translations\": dim_spatial_translation,\n        \"Spatial rotations\": dim_spatial_rotation,\n        \"Galilean boosts\": dim_galilean_boosts,\n        \"Scaling\": dim_scaling\n    }\n\n    print(\"The total dimension of the Lie symmetry group is the sum of the dimensions from each independent transformation type:\")\n    for name, dim in contributions.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {dim} dimension(s)\")\n\n    # Summing the dimensions\n    total_dimension = sum(contributions.values())\n\n    # Constructing the final equation string\n    equation_parts = [str(dim) for dim in contributions.values()]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculation is: {equation_str} = {total_dimension}\")\n    print(f\"Thus, the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries is {total_dimension}.\")\n\n    return total_dimension\n\n# Execute the function to print the result.\nfinal_dimension = calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension()\n# The final answer is wrapped separately for clarity\n# print(f\"<<<{final_dimension}>>>\")\n```\n<<<11>>>"
