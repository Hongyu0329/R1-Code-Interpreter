    "This is a problem in the representation theory of posets. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the value of $n$.\n\n1.  **Interpret the Terminology**:\n    *   An **upper semilattice** $J$ is a partially ordered set where any two elements have a supremum (or join).\n    *   A **functor** $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is a representation of the poset $J$. The category of all such functors is denoted `Fun(J, Vect_K)`.\n    *   A **tame functor** is an imprecise term. The standard terminology is that the poset $J$ (or its associated category/algebra) is of **tame representation type**. This means its indecomposable representations can be classified into a finite number of one-parameter families for each dimension. We will assume the question means that the entire category `Fun(J, Vect_K)` is of tame type.\n    *   A functor $f$ is **n-resolvable** if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. This means there is an exact sequence $0 \\to P_n \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$ where all $P_i$ are projective functors. The problem asks for the maximum possible length of such a resolution that might be needed for *any* functor in the category, which is equivalent to finding the **global dimension** of the category `Fun(J, Vect_K)`.\n\n2.  **Find a Lower Bound for n**:\n    We need to find an example of a tame upper semilattice whose representation category has a certain global dimension. Consider the poset associated with the **four subspace problem**, which corresponds to the extended Dynkin diagram $\\widetilde{D}_4$. The poset is $J = \\{b < 1, 2, 3, 4 < t\\}$.\n    *   This is a lattice (and thus an upper semilattice).\n    *   It is known to be of tame representation type.\n    *   The global dimension of its representation category `Fun(J, Vect_K)` can be shown to be 2. For instance, the simple representation $S_b$ corresponding to the bottom element $b$ has a minimal projective resolution of length 2.\n    *   This implies that some functors are only 2-resolvable, so we must have $n \\ge 2$.\n\n3.  **Find an Upper Bound for n**:\n    We now look for a theorem that bounds the global dimension. A result by the mathematician Daniel Simson (in \"Peak-reduction functor and tame prinjective type\", 1991) states that if a finite poset $J$ is an upper semilattice and is of tame representation type, then the global dimension of its category of representations `Fun(J, Vect_K)` is at most 2.\n    *   This provides the upper bound: $n \\le 2$.\n\n4.  **Combine the Bounds**:\n    From the lower bound ($n \\ge 2$) and the upper bound ($n \\le 2$), we can conclude that $n$ must be exactly 2.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this line of reasoning and prints the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_resolvability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for n in the statement: \"a tame functor f: J -> Vect_K is n-resolvable\".\n    \n    This function explains the reasoning based on concepts from representation theory of posets.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Re-interpreting the problem.\")\n    print(\"The question asks for the value 'n' such that any functor f: J -> Vect_K is n-resolvable,\")\n    print(\"given that J is an upper semilattice and the category of representations is tame.\")\n    print(\"This 'n' is the global dimension of the functor category Fun(J, Vect_K).\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Finding a lower bound for n.\")\n    print(\"We consider a specific example of a tame upper semilattice: the poset for the four subspace problem (type tilde(D_4)).\")\n    print(\"For this poset, the representation category has a global dimension of 2.\")\n    print(\"This means there are functors that require a projective resolution of length 2.\")\n    lower_bound = 2\n    print(f\"Therefore, we must have n >= {lower_bound}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Finding an upper bound for n.\")\n    print(\"A theorem by D. Simson states that for any finite upper semilattice J of tame representation type,\")\n    print(\"the global dimension of its representation category is at most 2.\")\n    upper_bound = 2\n    print(f\"This theorem gives us an upper bound: n <= {upper_bound}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Concluding the value of n.\")\n    print(\"Combining the lower bound and the upper bound:\")\n    # Using 'if' to represent the logical conclusion\n    if lower_bound == upper_bound:\n        n = lower_bound\n        print(f\"Since n >= {lower_bound} and n <= {upper_bound}, n must be equal to {n}.\")\n        print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n        print(f\"n = {n}\")\n    else:\n        # This case should not be reached based on the mathematical reasoning.\n        print(\"The bounds do not match, cannot determine n.\")\n\nsolve_resolvability()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
