    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\nFirst, I will establish the start and end years of the conflict based on the official StarCraft timeline. The war begins with the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* and concludes after the *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void* epilogue.\n\n1.  **Start Year:** The Second Great War begins in the year **2504**.\n2.  **End Year:** The war, including the final confrontation with Amon, concludes in the year **2506**.\n3.  **Calculation:** I will subtract the start year from the end year to find the duration.\n4.  **Rounding:** As requested, I will round the result up to the nearest whole number. The code will use `math.ceil()` to perform this step, even if the initial result is a whole number.\n5.  **Output:** The code will print out the years and the calculation used to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_war_duration():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n    The war starts in 2504 and ends in 2506.\n    \"\"\"\n    start_year = 2504\n    end_year = 2506\n\n    # Calculate the raw duration\n    duration = end_year - start_year\n\n    # Round the duration up as requested\n    rounded_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\n    print(\"The Second Great War in StarCraft Lore started in the year 2504 and concluded in 2506.\")\n    print(f\"To find the duration, we calculate: {end_year} - {start_year} = {duration}\")\n    print(f\"As requested, rounding up gives a total duration of {rounded_duration} years.\")\n\n\ncalculate_war_duration()\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
