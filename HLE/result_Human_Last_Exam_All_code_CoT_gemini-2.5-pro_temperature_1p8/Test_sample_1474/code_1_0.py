    analysis['A. Aboriginal masks'] = "Incorrect. While William Friedkin's 'The Exorcist' famously opens with the discovery of an ancient artifact, it is a Pazuzu amulet from Mesopotamian mythology, not an Aboriginal mask. There is no prominent use of Aboriginal masks in Fritz Lang's work."

    analysis['B. Magic wands'] = "Incorrect. Neither director's body of work features magic wands. Fritz Lang's films are in the sci-fi and noir genres, while William Friedkin is known for realistic thrillers and supernatural horror, none of which involve magic wands."

    analysis['C. The first ever cyborgs on screen'] = "Incorrect. Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' (1927) features the Maschinenmensch, which is considered the first major robot or android in cinema history. However, cyborgs are not a feature in William Friedkin's filmography. For an answer to be correct, the element must appear in the work of *both* directors."

    analysis['D. Bugs'] = "Correct. Both directors have used 'bug' (insects/arachnids) imagery. Lang directed a 1919 silent film called 'The Spiders' ('Die Spinnen') and used spider-like imagery for the master villain in his 1928 film 'Spies'. Friedkin famously directed the 2006 psychological thriller 'Bug' about a bug infestation, and his definitive cut of 'The Exorcist' includes the iconic 'spider-walk' scene."
