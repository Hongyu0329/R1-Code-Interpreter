    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can use powerful results from algebraic topology that relate the topology of a submanifold to its ambient space.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the spaces:** Our space is $X$, a smooth hypersurface defined by a degree-5 polynomial in the complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. The ambient space is $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n2.  **Determine properties of the ambient space:** We need the homotopy groups of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. Specifically, we need $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. This is a standard result that can be derived from the Hopf fibration $S^1 \\to S^7 \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$, which shows $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_3(S^7) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n3.  **Relate the homotopy groups of X and $\\mathbb{CP}^3$:** The inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces homomorphisms on their homotopy groups, $i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$.\n4.  **Apply a key theorem:** The **Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem** and its generalizations describe the relationship between the homotopy (and homology) groups of a projective variety and a subvariety. A strong version of this theorem, due to A. J. B. Potter, states that for a non-singular hypersurface $X$ of degree $d \\ge 2$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ with $n \\ge 2$, the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups up to dimension $n$.\n5.  **Calculate the final rank:** By applying the theorem, we can determine $\\pi_3(X)$ and subsequently its rank.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that explains this reasoning and prints the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_homotopy_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface\n    in CP^3 by applying known theorems from algebraic topology.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the problem\n    space = \"a smooth quintic hypersurface X\"\n    ambient_space = \"the complex projective space CP^3\"\n    n = 3\n    degree = 5\n    k = 3\n    \n    print(f\"Problem: Find the rank of the third homotopy group, pi_3(X), for {space} in {ambient_space}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 2: State known properties of the ambient space\n    pi_3_CP3 = \"Z\" # The group of integers\n    rank_pi_3_CP3 = 1\n    print(f\"It is a standard result in topology that pi_3({ambient_space}) is isomorphic to Z (the integers).\")\n    print(f\"This can be shown using the long exact sequence of the Hopf fibration S^1 -> S^7 -> CP^3.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the rank of pi_3(CP^3) is {rank_pi_3_CP3}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    \n    # Step 3: Relate pi_3(X) to pi_3(CP^3) using a key theorem\n    theorem = (\n        \"A theorem by A.
