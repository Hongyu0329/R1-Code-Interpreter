# The most general form of a SWAP variant gate is one that preserves the
# subspaces {|00>, |11>} and {|01>, |10>}. This means the gate's matrix
# is block-diagonal with respect to this partitioning. In the standard
# basis, this corresponds to a matrix with non-zero elements only in the
# corners and the center 2x2 block.
#
# This corresponds to option L in the provided list. The non-zero elements are
# at positions A, D, F, G, J, K, M, P.

# We represent the matrix structure using its letter placeholders.
# The code will print this structure.
