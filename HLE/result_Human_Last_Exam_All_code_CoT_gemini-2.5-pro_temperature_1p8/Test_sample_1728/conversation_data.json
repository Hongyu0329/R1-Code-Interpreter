    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concepts of graph sum (join) and chromatic number.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Graph:** The graph \\(G\\) is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\). This operation is formally known as the graph join. So, \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\).\n2.  **Chromatic Number of a Graph Join:** A key property of the chromatic number is that for any two graphs \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\), the chromatic number of their join is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers: \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\).\n3.  **Apply the Property:** We can extend this property to three graphs: \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n + C_n + C_n) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) \\).\n4.  **Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\(C_n\\)):** The chromatic number of a cycle \\( C_n \\) (where \\( n \\ge 3 \\)) depends on whether its length \\( n \\) is even or odd:\n    *   If \\( n \\) is **even**, \\( C_n \\) is bipartite, so \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is **odd**, \\( C_n \\) requires a third color, so \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n5.  **Find the Maximal Value:** To find the *maximal* chromatic number of \\( G \\), we must use the case where \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is maximal. The maximum value for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 3, which occurs when \\( n \\) is an odd number.\n6.  **Calculate the Result:** The maximal chromatic number of \\( G \\) is therefore \\( 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 \\).\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result and prints the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G,\n    where G is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n\n    The problem can be stated as finding the maximal value of chi(C_n + C_n + C_n).\n\n    The chromatic number of a graph join is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the\n    individual graphs. Therefore, chi(C_n + C_n + C_n) = chi(C_n) + chi(C_n) + chi(C_n).\n\n    The chromatic number of a cycle, chi(C_n) for n >= 3, is:\n    - 2 if n is even (the cycle is bipartite)\n    - 3 if n is odd\n\n    To find the maximal chromatic number of G, we need to use the maximal possible\n    value for chi(C_n), which is 3. This occurs when n is odd.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Maximal chromatic number of a single cycle C_n (when n is odd)\n    max_chi_cycle = 3\n\n    # The maximal chromatic number of G is the sum of the maximal chromatic\n    # numbers of the three constituent cycles.\n    maximal_chi_G = max_chi_cycle + max_chi_cycle + max_chi_cycle\n\n    print(\"To find the maximal chromatic number of G = C_n + C_n + C_n, we must maximize chi(C_n).\")\n    print(f\"The maximal value for chi(C_n) is {max_chi_cycle}, which occurs when n is odd.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the maximal chromatic number of G is given by the sum:\")\n    # Print the final equation with each number explicitly shown.\n    print(f\"{max_chi_cycle} + {max_chi_cycle} + {max_chi_cycle} = {maximal_chi_G}\")\n\nsolve_chromatic_number()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
