    "To find the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a standard procedure for determining the Galois group of a quartic polynomial.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility**: We first determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. If it is reducible, the Galois group is a subgroup of those determined by the factors. We can use Eisenstein's criterion for this.\n2.  **Compute the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**: The discriminant of the polynomial helps narrow down the possible Galois groups. If $\\Delta$ is a perfect square of a rational number, the group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ (i.e., $A_4$ or $V_4$). Otherwise, it is not (i.e., $S_4$, $D_4$, or $C_4$).\n3.  **Form the Resolvent Cubic**: We construct a related cubic polynomial, called the resolvent cubic. The nature of its roots over $\\mathbb{Q}$ further refines the possibilities for the Galois group.\n4.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**: If the resolvent cubic is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is $S_4$. If it is reducible (i.e., has at least one rational root), the group is $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n5.  **Distinguish Between the Final Options**: In the case where the group could be $D_4$ (order 8) or $C_4$ (order 4), a final test is needed. The group is $C_4$ if and only if the original polynomial $f(x)$ becomes reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nWe will now implement this plan using Python with the `sympy` library. The code will perform the calculations for each step and print the results leading to the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import symbols, Poly, discriminant, factor, is_irreducible, sqrt\n\ndef solve_galois_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the variable and the polynomial\n    x = symbols('x')\n    f_poly_expr = x**4 + 8*x + 14\n    f_poly = Poly(f_poly_expr, x, domain='ZZ')\n\n    p_coeff = f_poly.nth(1)\n    q_coeff = f_poly.nth(0)\n\n    print(f\"The polynomial is f(x) = {f_poly.as_expr()}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Check for irreducibility over Q\n    is_irred = is_irreducible(f_poly)\n    print(\"Step 1: Check for irreducibility over the rationals Q.\")\n    print(f\"Result: The polynomial is {'irreducible' if is_irred else 'reducible'}.\")\n    if not is_irred:\n        print(\"Analysis stops as the polynomial is reducible.\")\n        return\n    print(\"The Galois group is a transitive subgroup of S_4 (S_4, A_4, D_4, C_4, V_4).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Compute the discriminant\n    disc = discriminant(f_poly)\n    # The formula for x^4 + px + q is 256*q^3 - 27*p^4\n    print(\"Step 2: Compute the discriminant Δ.\")\n    print(f\"Using the formula Δ = 256*q^3 - 27*p^4 for x^4 + px + q:\")\n    print(f\"p = {p_coeff}, q = {q_coeff}\")\n    print(f\"Δ = 256*({q_coeff})^3 - 27*({p_coeff})^4 = 256*{q_coeff**3} - 27*{p_coeff**4} = {disc}\")\n\n    # Check if the discriminant is a perfect square\n    is_sq = sympy.is_square(disc)\n    print(\"\\nCheck if Δ is a perfect square in Q.\")\n    if not is_sq:\n        print(f\"Result: Δ = {disc} is not a perfect square.\")\n        print(\"The Galois group is not a subgroup of A_4.
