    Calculates the maximum possible value of chi(D)/chi(D_N).

    Step-by-step derivation:
    1.  The Euler characteristic chi(D) for a regular dessin D(G, b, w) is given by
        chi(D) = |G| * (1/|b| + 1/|w| + 1/|bw| - 1).
    2.  The dessin D is a smooth covering of D_N, which means they share the same
        bi-valency and face length. This implies that the orders of the generators
        are preserved in the quotient group: |b| = |bN|, |w| = |wN|, and |bw| = |(bw)N|.
    3.  The Euler characteristic for the quotient dessin D_N is therefore:
        chi(D_N) = |G/N| * (1/|bN| + 1/|wN| + 1/|(bw)N| - 1)
                 = |G/N| * (1/|b| + 1/|w| + 1/|bw| - 1).
    4.  The ratio is chi(D) / chi(D_N) = |G| / |G/N|.
    5.  By Lagrange's theorem, |G/N| = |G| / |N|.
    6.  Substituting this into the ratio gives:
        chi(D) / chi(D_N) = |G| / (|G| / |N|) = |N|.
    7.  The problem now is to find the maximum possible order of the normal subgroup N.
    8.  The condition of preserving generator orders means that the subgroup N must have a
        trivial intersection with the cyclic subgroups generated by b, w, and bw.
    9.  The theory of finite groups shows that it is possible to construct groups G with
        normal subgroups N of arbitrarily large order that satisfy these conditions.
        Therefore, there is no finite maximum value for |N|. The value is unbounded.

# In the context of the requested answer format, one might expect a number.
# However, the mathematical deduction shows there is no finite bound.
# A finite answer would require additional constraints not stated in the problem.
# For example, had the Euler characteristic been positive (the spherical case),
# there are only a finite number of possible groups, and a maximum would exist.
# But for the negative (hyperbolic) case, the number of groups is infinite.

# Since the format requires a specific type of output, I will comply with what makes sense.
