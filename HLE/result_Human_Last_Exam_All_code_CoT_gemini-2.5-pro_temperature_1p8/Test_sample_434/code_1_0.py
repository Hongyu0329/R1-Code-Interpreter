    print("\n--- Step 1: Characterizing the blow-up ---")
    print("A solution blows up if its magnitude goes to infinity in finite time. The -y^2 term in the equation for y' suggests that a blow-up might involve y(t) going to -infinity.")
    print("A blow-up to +infinity for y(t) is not possible, as for large positive y, y'(t) would be dominated by -y^2, making y'(t) negative and thus causing y(t) to decrease.")
    print("Therefore, any potential blow-up in this system must involve y(t) -> -infinity.")

    print("\n--- Step 2: Analyzing the case where y(0) = y_0 < 0 ---")
    print("Let's assume the initial condition is x_0 > 1 and y_0 < 0.")
    print("\na) We first show that y(t) will remain negative for all time.")
    print("Suppose y(t) reaches 0 for the first time at t=t1 > 0. This means y(t) < 0 for t in [0, t1).")
    print("In this interval, x'(t) = -3*x(t)*y(t) > 0, because x>0 and y<0. So, x(t) is strictly increasing, which means x(t1) > x_0 > 1.")
    print("At t=t1, the derivative of y is y'(t1) = -y(t1)^2 - x(t1) + 1 = 0 - x(t1) + 1 = 1 - x(t1).")
    print("Since x(t1) > 1, we have y'(t1) < 0.")
    print("However, for y(t) to cross the axis y=0 from below, its derivative at that point must be non-negative (y'(t1) >= 0). This is a contradiction.")
    print("Therefore, if y(0) is negative, y(t) must remain negative for all time.")

    print("\nb) Now we show that the solution must blow up.")
    print("Since y(t) remains negative and x(t) is increasing (x(t) > x_0), we can analyze y'(t):")
    print("y'(t) = -y(t)^2 - x(t) + 1")
    print("Because x(t) > x_0, it follows that -x(t) < -x_0. So, y'(t) < -y(t)^2 - x_0 + 1.")
    print("Let k = x_0 - 1. Since x_0 > 1, k is a positive constant. The inequality becomes y'(t) < -y(t)^2 - k.")
    print("We can compare y(t) with the solution u(t) of the simpler equation u'(t) = -u^2(t) - k, with u(0) = y_0.")
    print("This equation can be solved analytically, and its solution u(t) is known to blow up to -infinity in finite time.")
    print("By the comparison theorem for differential equations, since y(t) starts at the same value as u(t) and its derivative is always smaller, y(t) must also blow up to -infinity in finite time.")
    print("Conclusion for this case: For any y_0 < 0 (and any x_0 > 1), the solution blows up.")

    print("\n--- Step 3: Analyzing the case where y(0) = y_0 = 0 ---")
    print("Let's consider the initial condition y_0 = 0 and x_0 > 1.")
    print("We can evaluate the initial derivatives:")
    print("  x'(0) = -3 * x_0 * 0 = 0")
    print(f"  y'(0) = -0^2 - x_0 + 1 = 1 - x_0")
    print("Since x_0 > 1, y'(0) is negative.")
    print("This means that for a small time t > 0, y(t) will become negative.")
    print("Once y(t) is negative, the trajectory has entered the region discussed in Step 2, and it will proceed to blow up.")
    print("Conclusion for this case: For y_0 = 0 (and any x_0 > 1), the solution blows up.")

    print("\n--- Step 4: Analyzing the case where y(0) = y_0 > 0 ---")
    print("If y_0 > 0, the behavior is more complex and depends on the specific values of both x_0 and y_0.")
    print("The phase plane has a saddle point at (1, 0). The stable manifold of this saddle point acts as a separatrix that divides the phase plane.")
    print("- Initial points (x_0, y_0) that lie 'below' this separatrix correspond to solutions that eventually cross into the y < 0 region and then blow up.")
    print("- Initial points that lie 'above' this separatrix are attracted to a stable critical point at (0, 1) and do not blow up.")
    print("Since the separatrix passes through (1, 0) and extends into the first quadrant (x>0, y>0), for any given y_0 > 0, it is always possible to choose a value of x_0 > 1 (for instance, one very close to 1) such that the point (x_0, y_0) lies 'above' the separatrix, thus avoiding a blow-up.")
    print("Therefore, an initial condition with y_0 > 0 does not guarantee a blow-up for ALL possible choices of x_0 > 1.")
    
    print("\n--- Final Conclusion ---")
