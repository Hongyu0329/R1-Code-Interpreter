    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process and the final Python code to solve this historical linguistics problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the PIE form:** Start with the given Proto-Indo-European (PIE) form `*seh₂gieti`. I will break it down into its root and suffix (`*seh₂g-` + `*-ieti`). The meaning is given as '(s)he’s giving a sign'. The cognates in Hittite (`sākizzi`) and Latin (`sāgīre`) confirm the root and suggest a semantic field of \"perceiving, tracking, being keen.\"\n\n2.  **PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc):** I will apply the major sound laws that differentiate Proto-Germanic from PIE.\n    *   **Laryngeal Coloring/Lengthening:** The laryngeal `*h₂` colors the preceding `*e` vowel to `*a`. When it comes after a vowel and before a consonant (`*eh₂C`), it typically results in a long vowel, pre-Germanic `*ā`.\n    *   **Vowel Shift:** PIE `*ā` becomes PGmc `*ō`.\n    *   **Grimm's Law:** This law affects consonants. The relevant part here is that the PIE voiced stop `*g` becomes the PGmc voiceless stop `*k`.\n    *   **Verbal Suffix:** The PIE causative/intensive suffix `*-ieti` (3rd person singular present) corresponds to the PGmc Class 1 weak verb stem `*-ija-` with the 3rd person singular present ending `*-iþi` or `*-iþ`.\n    *   **Combine:** These changes will transform `*seh₂g-ie-ti` into the PGmc form `*sōkiþ`. The meaning shifts from \"give a sign\" to \"seek a sign\" or simply \"to seek.\"\n\n3.  **PGmc to Old Germanic Languages:** I will then take the derived PGmc form `*sōkiþ` and evolve it into Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German by applying the specific sound laws for each language.\n    *   **For Old Norse (ON):** The key changes are *i-umlaut* (where the `i` in the stem `*-ki-` modifies the root vowel `*ō` to `œ`) and the change of the final dental fricative `*-þ` to `r`. The `i` itself is then lost.\n    *   **For Old English (OE):** The main changes are *i-umlaut* (`*ō` becomes `ē`) and the *palatalization* of `*k` to `ċ` (pronounced /tʃ/) before a front vowel like the `i` in the stem. The ending `*-iþ` becomes `-eþ` or ` -þ`.\n    *   **For Old High German (OHG):** This requires applying the *High German Consonant Shift*. PGmc `*k` when geminated (doubled) before `j` becomes `hh` (a voiceless fricative, /xx/). PGmc `*ō` is affected by i-umlaut and becomes `üe`. The ending `*-iþ` becomes `-it`. The resulting verb is `suohhen`, and the 3rd person singular is `suohhit`.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that declares these forms as variables and prints out each step of the transformation, clearly showing how the PIE form evolves into its descendants in each target language.\n\n```python\ndef trace_linguistic_evolution():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script traces a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb through its\n    transformations into Proto-Germanic and several old Germanic languages.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
