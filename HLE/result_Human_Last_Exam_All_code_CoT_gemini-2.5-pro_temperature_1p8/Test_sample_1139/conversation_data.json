    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of parameters, or degrees of freedom, in the bosonic sector of the specified supersymmetric sigma-model. This number is equivalent to the dimension of the bosonic part of the model's target manifold.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the target space:** For disordered systems of symmetry class D, the target space of the supersymmetric sigma-model with `n` replicas is the symmetric superspace `OSp(2n|2n) / O(n|n) x O(n|n)`. The problem specifies two replicas, so we set `n=2`.\n2.  **Identify the bosonic submanifold:** We need to find the bosonic part of this coset space. The bosonic part of a supergroup `G` is denoted `G_B`. The bosonic submanifold is `G_B / K_B`, where `G = OSp(4|4)` and `K = O(2|2) x O(2|2)`.\n3.  **Calculate the dimension of the numerator's bosonic part:** The bosonic subgroup of `OSp(2n|2n)` is `Sp(2n) x O(2n)`. For `n=2`, this is `Sp(4) x O(4)`. We will calculate the dimension of this product group.\n4.  **Calculate the dimension of the denominator's bosonic part:** The bosonic subgroup of `O(n|n)` is `O(n) x O(n)`. For `K = O(2|2) x O(2|2)`, the bosonic part is `(O(2) x O(2)) x (O(2) x O(2))`. We will calculate its dimension.\n5.  **Calculate the final dimension:** The dimension of the target manifold is the difference between the dimension of the numerator's bosonic part and the denominator's bosonic part.\n\nThe dimension formulas for the relevant matrix groups are:\n*   Dimension of the special orthogonal group `O(m)`: `dim(O(m)) = m * (m - 1) / 2`\n*   Dimension of the symplectic group `Sp(2m)`: `dim(Sp(2m)) = m * (2m + 1)`\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations step-by-step and print the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef dim_o(m):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the dimension of the orthogonal group O(m).\"\"\"\n    return m * (m - 1) // 2\n\ndef dim_sp(m):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the dimension of the symplectic group Sp(2m).\"\"\"\n    if m % 2 != 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input to dim_sp must be an even number (2k).\")\n    k = m // 2\n    return k * (m + 1)\n\ndef solve_class_d_variables():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassman variables for the supersymmetric\n    sigma-model with two replicas for symmetry class D.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of replicas\n    n = 2\n\n    # Numerator G = OSp(2n|2n) = OSp(4|4)\n    # Bosonic part is G_B = Sp(2n) x O(2n) = Sp(4) x O(4)\n    dim_sp_2n = dim_sp(2 * n)\n    dim_o_2n = dim_o(2 * n)\n    dim_g_b = dim_sp_2n + dim_o_2n\n\n    # Denominator K = O(n|n) x O(n|n) = O(2|2) x O(2|2)\n    # Bosonic part is K_B = (O(n) x O(n)) x (O(n) x O(n))\n    # which is 4 copies of O(n) = O(2)\n    dim_o_n = dim_o(n)\n    dim_k_b = 4 * dim_o_n\n\n    # The number of variables is dim(G_B) - dim(K_B)\n    result = dim_g_b - dim_k_b\n\n    # Print the detailed calculation\n    # The structure is (dim(Sp(2n)) + dim(O(2n))) - 4 * dim(O(n))\n    print(\"The number of non-Grassman variables is the dimension of the bosonic manifold:\")\n    print(f\"dim(Sp({2*n})) + dim(O({2*n})) - (4 * dim(O({n})))\")\n    print(f\"= {dim_sp_2n} + {dim_o_2n} - (4 * {dim_o_n})\")\n    print(f\"= {dim_g_b} - {dim_k_b}\")\n    print(f\"= {result}\")\n\n\nsolve_class_d_variables()\n\n```\n<<<12>>>"
