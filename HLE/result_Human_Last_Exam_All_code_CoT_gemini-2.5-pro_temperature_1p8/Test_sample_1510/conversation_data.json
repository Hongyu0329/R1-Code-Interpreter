    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Point Groups of Order 2:** First, we must identify which of the 2D crystallographic point groups have an order of 2. The order of a group is the number of symmetry operations it contains. The point groups of order 2 are **C2** (containing identity and a 2-fold rotation) and **D1** (containing identity and a mirror reflection, also known as 'm' or Cs).\n\n2.  **List Wallpaper Groups:** There are 17 wallpaper groups in total. We need to know which point group each wallpaper group belongs to.\n\n3.  **Filter and Count:** We will filter the list of 17 wallpaper groups to find only those associated with point groups C2 and D1.\n\n4.  **Sum the Counts:** Finally, we will sum the counts for each relevant point group to get the total number.\n\nThe following Python script automates this process. It contains the mapping of all 17 wallpaper groups to their respective point groups, identifies the ones with an order of 2, and calculates the total.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wallpaper_group_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the number of wallpaper groups \n    that have a point group of order 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the relationship between the 17 wallpaper groups \n    # and their respective point groups (in Schoenflies notation).\n    wallpaper_to_point_group = {\n        # Point group C1 (order 1)\n        'p1': 'C1',\n        # Point group C2 (order 2)\n        'p2': 'C2',\n        # Point group D1 (or 'm', 'Cs') (order 2)\n        'pm': 'D1',\n        'pg': 'D1',\n        'cm': 'D1',\n        # Point group D2 (or '2mm') (order 4)\n        'pmm': 'D2',\n        'pgg': 'D2',\n        'pmg': 'D2',\n        'cmm': 'D2',\n        # Point group C3 (order 3)\n        'p3': 'C3',\n        # Point group D3 (or '3m') (order 6)\n        'p3m1': 'D3',\n        'p31m': 'D3',\n        # Point group C4 (order 4)\n        'p4': 'C4',\n        # Point group D4 (or '4mm') (order 8)\n        'p4m': 'D4',\n        'p4g': 'D4',\n        # Point group C6 (order 6)\n        'p6': 'C6',\n        # Point group D6 (or '6mm') (order 12)\n        'p6m': 'D6'\n    }\n\n    target_order = 2\n    \n    # Step 2: Group the wallpaper groups by their point group.\n    # We create a dictionary to hold lists of wallpaper groups for each point group.\n    groups_by_point_group = {}\n    for wg_name, pg_name in wallpaper_to_point_group.items():\n        if pg_name not in groups_by_point_group:\n            groups_by_point_group[pg_name] = []\n        groups_by_point_group[pg_name].append(wg_name)\n    \n    # Step 3: Identify point groups of order 2 and count their associated wallpaper groups.\n    point_groups_of_order_2 = {'C2': 1, 'D1': 3} # C2 has p2; D1 has pm, pg, cm\n\n    # Step 4: Print the results and the final calculation.\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order {target_order}.\")\n    print(\"The point groups of order 2 are C2 and D1.\\n\")\n\n    total_count = 0\n    equation_parts = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the relevant point groups to print the breakdown\n    for pg_name in ['C2', 'D1']:\n        count = len(groups_by_point_group.get(pg_name, []))\n        if count > 0:\n            total_count += count\n            equation_parts.append(str(count))\n            print(f\"The number of groups with point group {pg_name} is: {count}\")\n            print(f\"  (These are: {', '.join(groups_by_point_group[pg_name])})\\n\")\n\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The total is the sum of the counts for each point group type.\")\n    print(f\"Final Calculation: {equation_str} = {total_count}\")\n\n\nsolve_wallpaper_group_question()\n<<<4>>>\n```"
