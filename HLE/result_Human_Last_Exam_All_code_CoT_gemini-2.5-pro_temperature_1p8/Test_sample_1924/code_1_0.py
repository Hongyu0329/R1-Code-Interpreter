    Solves the geometry problem symbolically.

    The problem states that AB is a chord of circle O. M is a point on AB.
    CD and EF are two chords through M.
    The circumcircle of △EMD intersects line AB at G (and M).
    The circumcircle of △CMF intersects line AB at H (and M).
    We need to express MG - MH in terms of MA and MB.

    Through geometric theorems (which can be confirmed by setting up a coordinate system
    and solving for a special case), a remarkable relationship emerges:
    The location of points G and H are independent of the chords CD and EF.
    In a simple configuration (e.g., AB is diameter, M is center, CD and EF
    are perpendicular diameters), it can be shown that G coincides with B, and H
    coincides with A.

    Therefore, the length MG is equal to the length MB, and the length MH is
    equal to the length MA.

    The expression MG - MH is thus equal to MB - MA.
