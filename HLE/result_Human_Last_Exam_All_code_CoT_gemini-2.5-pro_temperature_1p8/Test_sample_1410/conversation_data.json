    "This chess puzzle requires finding the shortest forced checkmate for White. The position is sharp, with threats from both sides, but White has a decisive attacking combination.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the starting position from the FEN string `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20`.\n2.  Identify White's most forcing candidate moves. The most promising line starts with a queen sacrifice.\n3.  Follow the line, considering Black's best defensive responses at each step.\n4.  Determine the move at which checkmate is unavoidable, regardless of Black's play.\n5.  The number of moves for White to achieve this checkmate is the answer.\n6.  The Python script will then print out this sequence of moves and the resulting count, formatted as an equation.\n\nAfter a step-by-step analysis, I've found a forced mate in 5 moves for White. The sequence begins with `1. Qxf7+`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# This script prints the solution to the chess puzzle.\n# The puzzle is to find the minimum number of moves for White to win,\n# which means finding the shortest forced checkmate.\n\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the forced mate sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"White can force a checkmate in 5 moves.\")\n    print(\"The key line involves a queen check, followed by another check which sacrifices a knight but leads to an unstoppable mating attack.\")\n    print(\"Here is the winning sequence against optimal defense:\")\n\n    winning_sequence = [\n        \"1. Qxf7+ Kh8\",\n        \"2. Qxe8+ Kh7\",\n        \"3. Nf7+  Kg8\",\n        \"4. Nh6++ Kh7\", # This is a double check\n        \"5. Qg8#\"\n    ]\n\n    for move in winning_sequence:\n        print(move)\n\n    num_white_moves = 5\n\n    # Building the equation string as requested\n    equation_parts = [\"1\"] * num_white_moves\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"\\nEach of White's moves contributes one to the total number of moves to win.\")\n    # We are asked to output each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"The calculation is: {equation_string} = {num_white_moves}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThus, White can win in {num_white_moves} moves.\")\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\n<<<5>>>\n```"
