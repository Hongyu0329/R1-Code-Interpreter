    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n1.  **Analyze the Clues**: I will break down the provided text to identify the key elements.\n    *   **\"HE\"**: The capitalization suggests a prominent male figure.\n    *   **\"Prohibition against representation\"**: This strongly points to the Second Commandment (\"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image\"), a central theme in theology, philosophy, and psychoanalysis.\n    *   **\"Another's material possessions\"**: This directly refers to the final commandments about not coveting.\n    *   **\"Veronika Campan's interpretation\"**: This is a specific academic reference that can be looked up. Searching for \"Veronika Campan\" alongside \"prohibition against representation\" or \"Ten Commandments\" links her work to a specific thinker.\n2.  **Synthesize the Information**: Research shows Veronika Campan is a scholar who has written extensively on the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. Jacques Lacan, in his highly influential Seminar VII, *The Ethics of Psychoanalysis*, gives a detailed re-reading of the Ten Commandments. He connects the \"prohibition against representation\" to his concept of *das Ding* (the Thing) and ends his analysis by discussing the commandments on coveting (\"another's material possessions\").\n3.  **Conclusion**: The figure \"HE\" is Jacques Lacan.\n4.  **Code Implementation**: I will create a simple Python script to store this name in a variable and then print it, as requested.\n\n```python\n# The riddle provides several clues to identify a specific thinker.\n# The clue \"prohibition against representation\" refers to the Second Commandment.\n# The clue \"another's material possessions\" refers to the Tenth Commandment.\n# The subject \"HE\" gave a unique interpretation of the Ten Commandments, which was later analyzed by the scholar Veronika Campan.\n# Research confirms that Veronika Campan is a scholar of Jacques Lacan.\n# Jacques Lacan famously interpreted the Ten Commandments in his Seminar VII, \"The Ethics of Psychoanalysis,\" linking these concepts.\n# Therefore, the person being referred to is Jacques Lacan.\n\nhis_full_name = \"Jacques Lacan\"\n\nprint(his_full_name)\n```\n<<<Jacques Lacan>>>"
