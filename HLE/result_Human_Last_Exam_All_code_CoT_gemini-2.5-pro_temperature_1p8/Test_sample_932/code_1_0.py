def find_unlikely_tribes():
    """
    This function identifies and prints the indices of insect tribes whose immatures
    are unlikely to be collected with a beat-sheet method.

    The analysis is as follows:
    - 1 (Apis): Bee larvae are in hives, not on foliage. Unlikely.
    - 3 (Eupholini): Weevil larvae are internal plant borers. Unlikely.
    - 4 (Acritini): Beetle larvae are predators in dung/carrion, not on foliage. Unlikely.
    - 7 (Acanthocerini): Scarab larvae live in rotting wood or ant nests. Unlikely.
