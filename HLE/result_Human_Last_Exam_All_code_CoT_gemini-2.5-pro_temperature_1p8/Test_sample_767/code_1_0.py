def solve_limit():
    """
    This function calculates the exact value of the limit lim_{N->inf} p(N)/N.

    The reasoning is based on separating the problem into two cases for the coefficients (a,...,g):
    1.  The polynomial in F_m is non-constant (at least one of a,..,f is non-zero).
        In this case, the equation F_n = -P(F_m) has a finite number of solutions (n,m).
        Thus, its contribution to the limit is 0.
    2.  The polynomial in F_m is constant (a=b=c=d=e=f=0).
        The equation becomes F_n = -g. The contribution to the limit is the number of
        solutions for n, which we denote S_g.

    The total limit is the sum of S_g for g from -25 to 25.
    S_g is non-zero only if -g is a Fibonacci number.
