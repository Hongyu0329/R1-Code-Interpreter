    # - "Sushi is fish.": Not strictly true. Sushi is a dish that often contains fish, but
    #   also contains other essential ingredients like vinegared rice. Many types of sushi
    #   do not contain fish at all. "Sushi contains fish" is more accurate.
    # - "The conversation is playful.": The original states it "turned" playful, implying a
    #   change. Whether it currently "is" playful is context-dependent and not a general truth.
    # - "Satyendranath Bose turned playful.": This is a personal attribute that cannot be verified
    #   as a known fact.
