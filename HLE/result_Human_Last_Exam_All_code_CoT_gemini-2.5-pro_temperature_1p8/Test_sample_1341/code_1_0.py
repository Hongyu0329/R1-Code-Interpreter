# Events timeline (using simple day numbers for logic, starting from the missed payment)
day_of_missed_payment = 1  # Feb 1
day_notice_sent = 2          # Feb 2
day_of_repossession_attempt = 6  # Feb 6

actual_notice_content = "a text letting him know that he missed a payment"


# --- Step 2: Analyze the financial status ---

# Check 2: Did Gary provide proper notice according to the contract?
# The contract requires a "written notice of default". A simple text message is written,
# but its content, "letting him know that he missed a payment," does not constitute a
# formal "notice of default" which should state the breach and consequences to be legally sufficient.

print("   - Analysis: A simple reminder via text does not meet the legal standard of a formal notice of default. Therefore, the notice is insufficient.")

# The analysis can conclude here. Because the notice was not valid, the 3-day clock to cure the
# default never officially started.
