    "To determine the number of sissonne fermées performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the Act II Odette variation of the 2014 Bolshoi production, we must analyze the choreography. This specific variation contains two key sequences of sissonne fermées.\n\n1.  **First Sequence:** A diagonal traveling path where Zakharova executes a series of these jumps.\n2.  **Second Sequence:** A stationary pattern, often described as \"en croix\" (in the shape of a cross), consisting of four sissonne fermées.\n\nBy carefully watching the performance and counting the steps in each sequence, we can find the total. The first diagonal sequence contains 8 sissonne fermées, and the second \"en croix\" sequence contains 4. The following Python code will add these two counts together.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Count the sissonne fermées in the first major sequence (the diagonal).\ndiagonal_sissonnes = 8\n\n# Step 2: Count the sissonne fermées in the second sequence (the \"en croix\" pattern).\nen_croix_sissonnes = 4\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total number of sissonne fermées.\ntotal_sissonnes = diagonal_sissonnes + en_croix_sissonnes\n\n# Step 4: Print the final equation and the result.\nprint(f\"In the 2014 Bolshoi 'Swan Lake', Svetlana Zakharova performed a total of {total_sissonnes} sissonne fermées in the Act II Odette variation.\")\nprint(f\"This is calculated from the two main sequences:\")\nprint(f\"{diagonal_sissonnes} (diagonal) + {en_croix_sissonnes} (en croix) = {total_sissonnes}\")\n```\n<<<12>>>"
