# Step 1: Establish the Initial Total Number of Curves (T).
# The problem presents two potential starting points, creating a logical puzzle.
# Path A: Start with "If ninety curves stay true". If 3/8 were lost, 5/8 stayed true. 90 = 5/8 * T => T = 144.
#           This leads to W (1/4 of T) = 36. However, W is broken down by fractions 1/5 and 2/9,
#           meaning W must be a multiple of lcm(5, 9) = 45. Since 36 is not a multiple of 45, this path is contradictory.
# Path B: Start with the constraint that W must be a multiple of 45. Since W = 1/4 * T, T must be a multiple of 180.
#           The text explicitly mentions a base pattern of "360 connection curves", which is a multiple of 180.
#           This path allows all fractions to resolve to integers. This is the more logical path.
initial_total_curves = 360

# Step 2: Calculate the number of curves in different categories based on the poem.
# "Three-eighths of curves lost shape serene" - We interpret this as curves being destroyed.
fraction_destroyed = 3/8
curves_destroyed = int(fraction_destroyed * initial_total_curves)

# "one-fourth find new pathways to trace" - We interpret this as curves that transformed but still exist.
fraction_transformed = 1/4
curves_transformed = int(fraction_transformed * initial_total_curves)

# We can also calculate the number of curves that remained unchanged.
curves_unchanged = initial_total_curves - curves_destroyed - curves_transformed

# As a check, let's verify the breakdown of the transformed curves.
# Parabolic = 1/5 * transformed = 1/5 * 90 = 18.
# Elliptical = 2/9 * transformed = 2/9 * 90 = 20.
# Both are whole numbers, confirming our choice for T=360 was correct.

# Step 3: Determine how many curves the master must draw.
# The question asks "How many must the master place" to "restore the pattern".
# This means the master must draw the curves that were destroyed.
curves_to_draw = curves_destroyed

# Step 4: Display the final calculation.
# The final answer is the number of curves the master must place, which equals the number of curves destroyed.
print("To restore the sacred symmetry, the master must place a number of new curves.")
print("This number is equal to the three-eighths of the original curves that were destroyed.")
print(f"Based on an initial total of {initial_total_curves} curves:")
print(f"Curves to Place = {int(fraction_destroyed * initial_total_curves)}")
print(f"Final Equation: {curves_to_draw} = ({int(fraction_destroyed*8)}/{int(fraction_destroyed**-1/initial_total_curves**-1)}) * {initial_total_curves}")

# Final Answer: The total curves the master must draw is calculated above.
# The final result is the variable 'curves_to_draw'.
final_answer = curves_to_draw
# <<<135>>>
