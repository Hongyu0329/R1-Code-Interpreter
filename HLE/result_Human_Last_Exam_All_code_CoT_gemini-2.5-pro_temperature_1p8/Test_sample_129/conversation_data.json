    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to determine the total number of true boolean expressions that can be formed using exactly 5 symbols from the set `{T, F, !, &, |, (, )}`. The rules of precedence are `!` (highest), then `&`, then `|` (lowest).\n\n2.  **Choose a Strategy:** Since the expression length is very small (5 characters) and the alphabet of symbols is also small (7 symbols), a brute-force approach is feasible. I will programmatically generate every possible string of length 5 and then test each one to see if it meets the criteria. The total number of combinations is 7^5 = 16,807, which is easily manageable for a script.\n\n3.  **Develop the Validation Method:** For each generated string, I need to check two things:\n    a. Is it a syntactically correct boolean expression?\n    b. If it is, does it evaluate to `True`?\n\n    Python's built-in `eval()` function is an excellent tool for this. Python's logical operators (`not`, `and`, `or`) and their precedence rules match the requirements of the problem (`! > & > |`), making `eval()` a perfect fit for both parsing and evaluation.\n\n4.  **Implement the Script:** My Python script will perform the following steps:\n    a. Define the set of allowed symbols.\n    b. Use `itertools.product` to generate all 16,807 possible 5-character strings.\n    c. For each string, convert it into a format that `eval()` can understand. This involves replacing `T` with `True`, `F` with `False`, `!` with `not`, `&` with `and`, and `|` with `or`. I will add spaces around the keywords to ensure proper token separation (e.g., `T&F` becomes ` True and False `, not `TrueandFalse`).\n    d. Wrap the `eval()` call in a `try...except` block. If a string is not a valid expression (e.g., `\"T(&F)\"` or `\"&&!|T\"`), `eval()` will raise an exception, which my script will catch and simply move on to the next string.\n    e. If `eval()` completes successfully, I will check if its return value is `True`.\n    f. I will use a `set` to store all the unique expressions that are valid and true.\n    g. Finally, the script will print the total count of these true expressions, which is the size of the set.\n\nThis method systematically and accurately checks all possibilities to find the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_true_expressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of true boolean expressions of length 5\n    using the symbols T, F, !, &, |, (, ).
