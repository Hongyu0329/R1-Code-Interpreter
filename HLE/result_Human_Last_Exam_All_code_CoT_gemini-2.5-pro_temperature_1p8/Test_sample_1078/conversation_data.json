    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to form a finite Weyl group of rank 4. A finite Weyl group can be decomposed into a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups. The rank of the direct product is the sum of the ranks of its components. Therefore, this problem is equivalent to finding all partitions of the number 4 and, for each partition, counting the number of ways to form a group using irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks match the parts of the partition.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  List the number of irreducible finite Weyl groups for ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n2.  Identify all possible partitions of the number 4. The partitions represent how the total rank of 4 can be composed of ranks of irreducible components.\n3.  For each partition, calculate the number of non-isomorphic groups that can be formed. For partitions with repeated parts (e.g., 2+2), this involves calculating combinations with repetition.\n4.  Sum the counts from all partitions to get the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this plan, showing the calculation for each step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations_with_replacement(n, k):\n    \"\"\"Calculates combinations with replacement, C(n+k-1, k)\"\"\"\n    if k < 0 or n < 0:\n        return 0\n    if k == 0:\n        return 1\n    return math.comb(n + k - 1, k)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we classify them based on their decomposition into irreducible components.\")\n    print(\"The rank of a group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Count of irreducible Weyl groups for each rank\n    # Rank 1: A_1\n    # Rank 2: A_2, B_2, G_2\n    # Rank 3: A_3, B_3\n    # Rank 4: A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4\n    irreducible_counts = {\n        1: 1,\n        2: 3,\n        3: 2,\n        4: 4\n    }\n\n    print(\"First, we list the number of irreducible Weyl groups for each rank up to 4:\")\n    print(f\"- Rank 1: {irreducible_counts[1]} type (A₁)\")\n    print(f\"- Rank 2: {irreducible_counts[2]} types (A₂, B₂, G₂)\")\n    print(f\"- Rank 3: {irreducible_counts[3]} types (A₃, B₃)\")\n    print(f\"- Rank 4: {irreducible_counts[4]} types (A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄)\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Now, we consider all partitions of the number 4 and count the groups for each case:\\n\")\n    \n    total_groups = 0\n    \n    # Partition 1: [4] (irreducible group)\n    p1_count = irreducible_counts[4]\n    total_groups += p1_count\n    print(\"1.
