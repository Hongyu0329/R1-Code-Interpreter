    "This is a specialized paleontological question. I will find the answer from established scientific literature regarding the anatomy of *Irritator challengeri*. My plan is to retrieve this factual information and then present it using a Python script, as requested. The script will use variables to represent the number of depressions and print the final answer in a clear statement that resembles an equation.\n\nBased on the 2002 paper by Sues et al. titled \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil,\" the lacrimal bone features a recess that contains two smaller openings (depressions). I will encode this information into the script.\n\n```python\ndef find_lacrimal_depressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess\n    of Irritator challengeri based on scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to paleontological studies (e.g., Sues et al., 2002),\n    # the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains two smaller depressions.\n    # We can represent this as a simple sum.\n    depression_count_part1 = 1\n    depression_count_part2 = 1\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of depressions\n    total_depressions = depression_count_part1 + depression_count_part2\n    \n    print(f\"Based on anatomical descriptions, the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri is {depression_count_part1} + {depression_count_part2} = {total_depressions}.\")\n\nfind_lacrimal_depressions()\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
