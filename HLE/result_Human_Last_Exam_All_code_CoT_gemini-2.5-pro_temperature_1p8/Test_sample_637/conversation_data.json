    "To design the deadbeat observer, my plan is as follows:\n1.  A deadbeat observer is an observer that drives the estimation error to zero in the shortest possible time. For a discrete-time system, this is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues of the observer error dynamics matrix, `(A - LC)`, at the origin of the complex plane.\n2.  The problem is thus transformed into a pole placement problem. We need to find the observer gain matrix `L` such that the characteristic polynomial of `(A - LC)` is `p(z) = z^4 = 0`.\n3.  Standard numerical pole placement tools can be numerically sensitive, especially when placing multiple poles at the same location (all four poles at z=0 in this case). Therefore, I will pursue a direct analytical approach.\n4.  I will simplify the problem by attempting to find a solution using only the first output channel, `y_1(k)`. This is equivalent to setting the second column of the `L` matrix to zero.\n5.  With `L = [l, 0]`, where `l` is a 4x1 vector `[l1, l2, l3, l4]^T`, the characteristic polynomial of `(A - LC)` can be computed as a function of these four variables.\n6.  By setting the coefficients of `z^3`, `z^2`, `z^1`, and `z^0` in the resulting polynomial to zero, I will obtain a system of linear equations in `l1, l2, l3, l4`.\n7.  Finally, I will solve this system of equations to find the elements of `L` and present the resulting matrix. The python code below will perform these computations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef design_deadbeat_observer():\n    \"\"\"\n    Designs a deadbeat observer for the given system.\n\n    For a discrete-time system x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k), y(k) = Cx(k),\n    the observer dynamics are given by x_hat(k+1) = A*x_hat(k) + B*u(k) + L*(y(k) - C*x_hat(k)).\n    The error dynamics are e(k+1) = (A - LC)e(k).\n\n    A deadbeat observer requires the eigenvalues of (A - LC) to be all zero.\n    This makes the characteristic polynomial of (A - LC) equal to z^n = 0.\n\n    We will solve for the observer gain L. We assume a simplified L that only uses\n    the first output channel, i.e., the second column of L is zero.\n    L = [[l1, 0], [l2, 0], [l3, 0], [l4, 0]]\n\n    The characteristic polynomial of (A - LC) for this form of L was derived as:\n    p(z) = z^4 + (l1+2)z^3 + (l1+l4+3)z^2 + (l1+l3+3)z + (3+2*l1-l2)\n\n    To make p(z) = z^4, we set the coefficients of the lower-order terms to zero:\n    1. Coeff of z^3: l1 + 2 = 0\n    2. Coeff of z^2: l1 + l4 + 3 = 0\n    3. Coeff of z^1: l1 + l3 + 3 = 0\n    4. Coeff of z^0: 3 + 2*l1 - l2 = 0\n\n    We solve this system of linear equations for l1, l2, l3, l4.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Create a vector for the elements of the first column of L\n    l = np.zeros(4)\n\n    # From equation 1:\n    l[0] = -2  # l1\n\n    # From equation 2:\n    l[3] = -l[0] - 3  # l4\n\n    # From equation 3:\n    l[2] = -l[0] - 3  # l3\n\n    # From equation 4:\n    l[1] = 3 + 2 * l[0]  # l2\n\n    # Construct the observer gain matrix L\n    L = np.zeros((4, 2))\n    L[:, 0] = l\n\n    print(\"The observer gain matrix L is:\")\n    print(L)\n\ndesign_deadbeat_observer()\n```\n<<<[[-2. 0.]\n [-1. 0.]\n [-1. 0.]\n [-1. 0.]]>>>"
