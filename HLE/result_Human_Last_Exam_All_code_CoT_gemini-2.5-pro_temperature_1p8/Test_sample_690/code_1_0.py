    # 1. Correctness Analysis
    # The algorithm uses binary search to find the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements in sub-rows.
    # This assumes non-zero elements are in a contiguous block around the diagonal, like [0,0,...,NZ,NZ,...,0,0].
    # However, a band matrix can have zeros inside the band, e.g., a row like [5, 0, 1].
    # The described binary search would fail on such a row.
    correctness_conclusion = "The algorithm will not correctly compute the bandwidth for all valid matrices because its binary search component is based on a flawed assumption."
    
    # Example matrix where the algorithm fails:
    # A = [[5, 0, 1],
    #      [0, 3, 0],
    #      [1, 0, 4]]
    # True bandwidth is |0-2| = 2.
    # The algorithm on row 0 would fail to find A[0][2]=1 as the rightmost non-zero element.

    # 2. Complexity Analysis
    # The algorithm has a loop that runs n times.
    # Inside the loop, it performs two binary searches.
    # For row i, the searches take O(log(i)) and O(log(n-i)) time.
    # The total time is the sum over n iterations: Sum_{i=1 to n} (log(i) + log(n-i)).
    # This is equivalent to Sum_{k=1 to n} 2*log(k) = 2*log(n!).
    # By Stirling's approximation, log(n!) is O(n*log(n)).
    complexity_conclusion = "The time complexity of the described algorithm is O(n*log(n))."

    # 3. Evaluating options
    # A. Incorrect (algorithm is flawed)
    # B. Incorrect (algorithm is flawed and complexity is wrong)
    # C. Correctness: "never" is strong, but it captures that the algorithm is flawed. Complexity: Correct. This is the best fit.
    # D. Incorrect (complexity is wrong)
    # E. Incorrect (algorithm fails even for symmetric matrices)
    # F. Incorrect (complexity is O(n*log(n)) regardless of symmetry)
    # G. Incorrect if C is considered the intended answer.
