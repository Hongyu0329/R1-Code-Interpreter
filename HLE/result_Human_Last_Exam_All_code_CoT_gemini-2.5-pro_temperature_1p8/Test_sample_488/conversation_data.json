    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my analysis of the question, presented as a Python script that explains the reasoning step-by-step.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will identify the core concepts presented in the phrase \"my love for humanity\".\n2.  Next, I will review the primary types of conceptual metaphors as defined in cognitive linguistics, particularly in the work of Lakoff and Johnson, to which the question refers.\n3.  I will then evaluate how the given phrase maps onto these categories.\n4.  Finally, I will select the best-fitting answer from the provided choices and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_metaphor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the conceptual metaphor in a given phrase and provides a step-by-step explanation.\n    \"\"\"\n    phrase = \"my love for humanity\"\n    choices = {\n        \"A\": \"Conceptual metaphor\",\n        \"B\": \"Physical metaphor\",\n        \"C\": \"Orientational metaphor\",\n        \"D\": \"Structural metaphor\",\n        \"E\": \"Intentional metaphor\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of the Conceptual Metaphor ---\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Understanding the Phrase\")\n    print(f\"The phrase to analyze is: \\\"{phrase}\\\"\")\n    print(\"This expression treats 'love'—an abstract emotion—as if it were a concrete substance or a possession that can be owned (indicated by 'my').\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Reviewing the Relevant Metaphor Types\")\n    explanation = textwrap.fill(\n        \"In the theory of conceptual metaphors, there are several key types:\"\n        \"\\n- Orientational Metaphor: Involves spatial relations like up-down or in-out (e.g., 'feeling down').\"\n        \"\\n- Ontological Metaphor: Involves treating abstract concepts, events, and emotions as if they were physical entities or substances (e.g., 'a lot of inflation').\"\n        \"\\n- Structural Metaphor: Involves using a well-understood, structured concept to understand a more abstract one (e.g., using the concept of a JOURNEY to structure the concept of LOVE in 'Our relationship has been a long, bumpy road').\\n\",\n        width=80)\n    print(explanation)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analysis and Conclusion\")\n    analysis_text_1 = textwrap.fill(\n        \"The phrase 'my love for humanity' relies on a conceptual metaphor like LOVE IS A SUBSTANCE or LOVE IS A POSSESSION.
