    packing_dihydroceramide = "   - Saturated chains are straight and can pack together very tightly and efficiently, leading to highly ordered, dense domains."

    structure_ceramide = "2. C16-ceramide: Contains one unsaturated sphingoid base (d18:1) with a trans double bond and one saturated acyl chain (16:0)."
    packing_ceramide = "   - The trans double bond disrupts the straight-chain structure, hindering the ability of molecules to pack as closely as their saturated counterparts. This leads to less ordered, more expanded domains."

    conclusion_text = "When compressed in a monolayer, the area per molecule is determined by the packing efficiency. Since C16-dihydroceramide packs more tightly due to its fully saturated chains, it will occupy a smaller area."
