    "This is a classic poker tournament problem that involves considering your position, stack size, and the tournament situation (the \"money bubble\"). Here's a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct hand to go all-in with.\n\n### **Plan and Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** You are in an early position (UTG+1) with a 16 big blind stack. This is a \"shove/fold\" stack size, meaning your best options are usually to go all-in or fold, rather than making a smaller raise. The situation is near the \"money bubble,\" which means players are playing more cautiously to avoid being eliminated just before the prize payouts begin. This caution from your opponents (known as ICM pressure) means they will only call your all-in with very strong hands.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Hand Options:**\n    *   **A. QJs (Queen-Jack suited):** This is a decent hand, but from an early position on the bubble, it's generally too weak to risk your entire tournament life. It's an easy fold.\n    *   **D. AJo (Ace-Jack offsuit):** Similar to QJs, this hand is strong but often dominated by the tighter range of hands that would call your all-in (like AQ, AK, or better pairs). This is also a fold.\n    *   **C. 99 (Pocket Nines) & E. AKo (Ace-King offsuit):** Both of these are premium hands and are considered standard all-in shoves in this situation. Modern poker strategy (GTO, or Game Theory Optimal) includes both hands in the shoving range here, even on the bubble.\n\n3.  **Break the Tie:** Since both `99` and `AKo` are correct shoves, we need to determine which one is *better*. We can do this by considering two factors:\n    *   **Equity When Called:** How well does our hand perform when an opponent actually calls our all-in? We'll use a Python script to simulate this.\n    *   **Fold Equity:** How often will our opponents fold? The hand `AKo` has a significant advantage here because it \"blocks\" opponents from having the strongest hands. When you hold an Ace and a King, it's impossible for your opponent to have AA, KK, or AK, drastically reducing the number of premium hands they can call you with. `99` has no such blocker effect on these top-tier hands.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Because `AKo` generates more folds (higher fold equity) due to its powerful blocker effects and performs very well even when called, it is the superior hand to shove in this spot. Our Python simulation below will calculate the equity when called against a very tight bubble calling range (`TT+, AQs+, AKo`) to demonstrate the raw power of these hands.\n\nHere is the Python code that simulates the equity for each hand, confirming that `AKo` and `99` are the primary contenders and showing their performance against a tight calling range.\n\n```python\nimport random\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef get_hand_details(hand):\n    \"\"\"Gets the ranks, suits, and counts of ranks for a 7-card hand.\"\"\"\n    ranks = sorted(['--23456789TJQKA'.index(c[0]) for c in hand], reverse=True)\n    suits = [c[1] for c in hand]\n    rank_counts = Counter(ranks)\n    suit_counts = Counter(suits)\n    return ranks, suits, rank_counts, suit_counts\n\ndef evaluate_hand_strength(hand):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates a 7-card poker hand and returns its rank and a tie-breaking kicker list.\n    Hand Ranks:\n    9: Straight Flush\n    8: Four of a Kind\n    7: Full House\n    6: Flush\n    5: Straight\n    4: Three of a Kind\n    3: Two Pair\n    2: One Pair\n    1: High Card\n    \"\"\"\n    ranks, suits, rank_counts, suit_counts = get_hand_details(hand)\n\n    # Check for flush\n    is_flush = False\n    flush_suit = None\n    for suit, count in suit_counts.items():\n        if count >= 5:\n            is_flush = True\n            flush_suit = suit\n            break\n\n    # Check for straight\n    # For a flush, only check ranks of the flush suit\n    flush_ranks = []\n    if is_flush:\n        for card in hand:\n            if card[1] == flush_suit:\n                flush_ranks.append('--23456789TJQKA'.index(card[0]))\n        flush_ranks = sorted(list(set(flush_ranks)), reverse=True)\n\n    check_ranks = flush_ranks if is_flush else sorted(list(set(ranks)), reverse=True)\n    \n    is_straight = False\n    straight_high_card = 0\n    \n    # Ace-low straight check (A,2,3,4,5)\n    if set([14, 2, 3, 4, 5]).issubset(set(check_ranks)):\n        is_straight = True\n        straight_high_card = 5\n    \n    # Regular straight check\n    for i in range(len(check_ranks) - 4):\n        if check_ranks[i] - check_ranks[i+4] == 4:\n            is_straight = True\n            straight_high_card = max(straight_high_card, check_ranks[i])\n            break\n\n    # 1.
