    "Based on biological knowledge, this Python script will analyze the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) to determine the correct answer from the provided list.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will establish the known food sources for adult Raphidiopterans based on entomological literature. They are primarily predators but are also known to consume other food types.\n2.  Next, I will evaluate each of the elementary options (A, B, C, D, E) against these facts. I'll pay special attention to the type of food versus the specific named example (e.g., \"Aphids\" vs. \"Totara Aphids\").\n3.  Finally, I will conclude which option or combination of options is the most accurate representation of their diet and select the corresponding final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans to find the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the food sources of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies)...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: State the known diet from scientific sources.\n    # Adult snakeflies are primarily predators, but also supplement their diet.\n    fact_predatory = \"Fact: Adult Raphidiopterans are predatory, primarily feeding on soft-bodied insects like aphids and mites.\"\n    fact_supplementary = \"Fact: They have also been recorded supplementing their diet with pollen and nectar.\"\n    \n    print(fact_predatory)\n    print(fact_supplementary)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate the provided options.\n    print(\"Evaluating the options:\")\n\n    # Option A: Nectar\n    is_A_correct = True\n    print(\"A.
