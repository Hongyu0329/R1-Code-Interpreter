    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension less than 500,000.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Irreps and Partitions:** The irreps of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions of $n$. Therefore, to find the irreps of $S_{25}$, we first need to generate all possible integer partitions of 25.\n2.  **Dimension Calculation:** For each partition, we can calculate the dimension of its corresponding irrep using the hook-length formula. The formula states that for a partition $\\lambda$ of $n$, the dimension $d_{\\lambda}$ is given by $d_{\\lambda} = \\frac{n!}{\\prod H_{\\lambda}}$, where $\\prod H_{\\lambda}$ is the product of the hook lengths of all cells in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$.\n3.  **Filtering and Counting:** We will iterate through all generated partitions of 25. For each partition, we will calculate its dimension. If the dimension is strictly less than 500,000, we will count it.\n4.  **Implementation:** I will provide a Python script to perform these steps. The script will define a function to generate partitions, another to calculate the dimension using the hook-length formula, and then it will iterate, filter, and count the qualifying irreps. The script will print the partitions and their dimensions that satisfy the condition, followed by the total count.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef generate_partitions(n, max_part=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all integer partitions of n in non-increasing order.\n    This is a recursive generator function.\n    \"\"\"\n    if max_part is None:\n        max_part = n\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        yield []\n        return\n    \n    # Iterate through possible values for the first (and largest) part.\n    for part_val in range(min(n, max_part), 0, -1):\n        # Recursively find partitions for the remainder.\n        for sub_partition in generate_partitions(n - part_val, part_val):\n            yield [part_val] + sub_partition\n\ndef calculate_dimension(partition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of an irrep of S_n corresponding to the given partition\n    using the hook-length formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = sum(partition)\n    \n    # Calculate the product of the hook lengths of all cells in the Young diagram.\n    product_of_hooks = 1\n    for i, part_len in enumerate(partition): # i is the row index (0-indexed)\n        for j in range(part_len): # j is the column index (0-indexed)\n            # A cell exists at (i, j).
