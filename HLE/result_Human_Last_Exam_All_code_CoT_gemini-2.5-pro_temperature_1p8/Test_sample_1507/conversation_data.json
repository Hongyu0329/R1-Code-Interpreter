    "To solve this, we first need to identify the \"outer-hull\" of the great icosahedron.\n\n1.  **Identify the Shape:** The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron. Its vertices are the same as the 12 vertices of a regular convex icosahedron.\n2.  **Determine the Outer-Hull:** The outer-hull (or convex hull) is the smallest convex shape that contains all the vertices. For the great icosahedron, its convex hull is a regular icosahedron.\n3.  **Triangulate the Hull:** The problem asks for the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating this outer-hull. A regular icosahedron's surface is already composed of 20 equilateral triangles. Therefore, no further triangulation is needed, and the number of triangles is simply the number of faces of the icosahedron.\n4.  **Calculate the Number of Faces:** We can use Euler's formula for polyhedra, `V - E + F = 2`, where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. For a regular icosahedron, V = 12 and E = 30. We can solve for F.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the regular icosahedron (the convex hull).\n# It has 12 vertices and 30 edges.\nnum_vertices = 12\nnum_edges = 30\n\n# Step 2: Use Euler's formula (V - E + F = 2) to find the number of faces (F).\n# Rearranging the formula gives: F = 2 - V + E\nnum_faces = 2 - num_vertices + num_edges\n\n# Step 3: Print the logic and the final calculation.\n# The faces of a regular icosahedron are already triangles, so the number of\n# faces is the minimal number of triangles needed for the triangulation.\nprint(\"The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\nprint(\"To find its number of faces (triangles), we use Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2\")\nprint(f\"Vertices (V) = {num_vertices}\")\nprint(f\"Edges (E) = {num_edges}\\n\")\nprint(\"The equation to find the number of faces is: F = 2 - V + E\")\nprint(\"Plugging in the numbers:\")\n# The final part of the request is to show the equation with the numbers.\nprint(f\"2 - {num_vertices} + {num_edges} = {num_faces}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe minimal number of triangles needed is {num_faces}.\")\n\n```\n<<<20>>>"
