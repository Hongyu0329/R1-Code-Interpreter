    "An analysis of the position is required to determine the optimal move for White.\n\n**Position Assessment:**\nThe provided FEN is `8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1`.\n*   **White's Assets:** The most significant feature of the position is White's advanced passed pawn on d6. This pawn is a severe threat to Black as it is only two squares away from promoting to a Queen.\n*   **Black's Position:** Black's Queen on c5 is very active and puts pressure on White's position. The Black King on c6 is well-placed to deal with White's passed pawn.\n*   **Objective:** White's goal should be to convert the advantage of the d6-pawn into a win. A direct promotion attempt is difficult with the queens on the board. Therefore, simplifying the position is the key.\n\n**Candidate Move Analysis:**\nThe most decisive move is to exchange Queens, which clarifies the path to victory for White.\n\n1.  **The Move `Qxc5+`**: This move initiates a queen trade.\n2.  **Forced Response**: Black is forced to respond with `...bxc5+`. The Black King cannot capture on c5 due to White's f2 Queen, and the pawn on b6 protects c5, making `...bxc5+` the only legal recapture.\n3.  **King and Pawn Endgame**: The game transitions into a King and Pawn endgame. The new position is:\n    *   White: King on g1, Pawns on d6, a4.\n    *   Black: King on c6, Pawns on d7, c5, a5.\n4.  **The Winning Plan**:\n    *   The white pawn on d6 forces the Black King to be passive. The Black King must move to the d-file (via `...Kc7`, `...Kd7`, `...Kd8`) to blockade the pawn, otherwise `d7` would be a winning move for White.\n    *   While the Black King is tied down to defensive duties, the White King is free to become an active attacker.\n    *   White will activate the King with moves like `Kf1`, `Ke2`, `Kd3`, and `Kc4`.\n    *   The active White King will attack and ultimately win Black's queenside pawns, leading to a decisive and winning advantage.\n\nThe following Python code will print this entire winning line step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chess position from FEN 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\n    and prints the best move for White with a clear explanation.\n    \"\"\"\n    fen = \"8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\"\n    best_move = \"Qxc5+\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"The optimal move for White is to force a Queen exchange, \"\n        \"transitioning to a winning King and Pawn endgame.\"\n    )\n    winning_line = [\n        (\"1.\", \"Qxc5+\", \"bxc5+\"),\n        (\"2.\", \"Kf1\", \"Kc7\"),\n        (\"3.\", \"Ke2\", \"Kd7\"),\n        (\"4.\", \"Kd3\", \"...\")\n    ]\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the chess position: {fen}\")\n    print(\"\\nWhite's best move is a capture that simplifies the position.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe best move is: {best_move}\")\n    print(f\"\\nRationale: {explanation}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe game follows a forced sequence leading to a winning endgame for White:\")\n    \n    # \"Outputting each number in the final equation\" here means showing the move numbers.\n    for move_num, white_move, black_move in winning_line:\n        if white_move and black_move:\n            print(f\"{move_num} {white_move} {black_move}\")\n        elif white_move:\n             print(f\"{move_num} {white_move}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nAfter these moves, the Black King is tied to defending against the d6-pawn,\")\n    print(\"while the White King is free to attack and win Black's other pawns.\")\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\nprint(\"\\n<<<Qxc5+>>>\")\n```"
