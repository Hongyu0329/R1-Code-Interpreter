    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The task is to find the DFT of an 8-point sequence `y(n)`, which is formed by interleaving two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`. We are given the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)` of the original sequences.\n\n2.  **Define the New Sequence:** The new sequence is `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`. Since `y(n)` has 8 points, its DFT, `Y(k)`, will also have 8 points. The problem statement asking for a \"4-point DFT\" is likely a typo for \"8-point DFT\", which is a common problem type in this context.\n\n3.  **Use the Decimation-In-Time Approach:** We can express the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` by splitting its defining summation over even and odd indices.\n    *   The terms with even indices `y(2m)` are the elements of `x(m)`.\n    *   The terms with odd indices `y(2m+1)` are the elements of `h(m)`.\n\n4.  **Derive the DFT Formula:** This separation leads to a well-known formula from the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, which relates the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` to the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`:\n    *   For the first half of the outputs (`k = 0, 1, 2, 3`):\n        `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n    *   For the second half of the outputs (`k = 4, 5, 6, 7`):\n        `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n    Here, `W_8^k = exp(-j * 2 * pi * k / 8)` is the DFT twiddle factor.\n\n5.  **Implement in Python:**\n    *   I will use the `numpy` library to handle complex arithmetic and array operations.\n    *   First, I will define the given `X(k)` and `H(k)` as numpy arrays.\n    *   Then, I will loop from `k = 0` to `3`.\n    *   Inside the loop, I will calculate the twiddle factor `W_8^k` and then compute `Y(k)` and `Y(k+4)` using the formulas above.\n    *   To fulfill the request, the code will print out each step of the calculation, showing the formula, the numerical values being used, and the result for each `Y(k)`.\n\nThis plan provides a clear path to the solution while explaining the underlying principles and generating a detailed output.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_dft():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 8-point DFT of an interleaved sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given 4-point DFTs\n    X = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j], dtype=complex)\n    H = np.array([0, 1 + 1j, 1, 1 - 1j], dtype=complex)\n    \n    # The new sequence y(n) is 8-points long, so we calculate an 8-point DFT Y(k).\n    N = 8\n    Y = np.zeros(N, dtype=complex)\n\n    print(\"The 8-point DFT Y(k) can be found using the 4-point DFTs X(k) and H(k).\")\n    print(\"The formulas are derived from the decimation-in-time FFT algorithm:\")\n    print(\"For k = 0, 1, 2, 3: Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)\")\n    print(\"For k = 0, 1, 2, 3: Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Starting calculations:\\n\")\n    \n    # Loop for k from 0 to 3\n    for k in range(N // 2):\n        # Calculate the twiddle factor W_N^k\n        W_Nk = np.exp(-2j * np.pi * k / N)\n        \n        # Calculate the butterfly operation\n        term = W_Nk * H[k]\n        Y[k] = X[k] + term\n        Y[k + N // 2] = X[k] - term\n\n        # Print the detailed calculation for Y(k)\n        print(f\"For k = {k}:\")\n        print(f\"  Y({k}) = X({k}) + W_8^{k} * H({k})\")\n        print(f\"       = {X[k]:.4f} + ({W_Nk:.4f}) * ({H[k]:.4f})\")\n        print(f\"       = {X[k]:.4f} + ({term:.4f})\")\n        print(f\"       = {Y[k]:.4f}\\n\")\n        \n        # Print the detailed calculation for Y(k+4)\n        print(f\"For k = {k+N//2}:\")\n        print(f\"  Y({k+N//2}) = X({k}) - W_8^{k} * H({k})\")\n        print(f\"       = {X[k]:.4f} - ({W_Nk:.4f}) * ({H[k]:.4f})\")\n        print(f\"       = {X[k]:.4f} - ({term:.4f})\")\n        print(f\"       = {Y[k+N//2]:.4f}\\n\")\n        print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(\"Final 8-point DFT sequence Y(k) is:\")\n    # Using a custom print to make it cleaner\n    y_str = \"[\" + \", \".join([f\"{val:.4f}\".replace(\"+0.0000j\", \"\").replace(\"-0.0000j\", \"\") for val in Y]) + \"]\"\n    print(y_str)\n    \n    # Return the final result in the specified format\n    # np.round is used to clean up floating point inaccuracies for the final answer\n    final_answer = np.round(Y, 4)\n    return final_answer\n\n# Execute the function and get the final answer string\nfinal_Y = solve_dft()\n\n# Format the final answer for the <<<>>> block\nanswer_string = \"[\" + \", \".join([f\"{val:.4f}\".replace('j', 'j') for val in final_Y]) + \"]\"\nprint(f\"\\n<<<{answer_string}>>>\")\n```"
