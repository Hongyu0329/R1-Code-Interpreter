# Based on the derivation, the complex components of the problem simplify significantly.
# The calculation of l(k) requires properties of the random variable z.
# A logical deduction under the problem's constraints suggests z follows a standard uniform distribution.

# Let's calculate the components of the expression for l(k) under this assumption.
# l(k) = p_k(1) + 2 * d_k - 1

# For a U(0,1) distribution, the PDF p_k(z) is 1 for z in (0,1).
# Therefore, p_k(1) = 1.
p_k_at_1 = 1

# The differential entropy d_k of a U(0,1) random variable is:
# d_k = - integral from 0 to 1 of p(z)*ln(p(z)) dz
# d_k = - integral from 0 to 1 of 1 * ln(1) dz = - integral of 0 dz = 0.
d_k = 0

# Now, we substitute these values into the expression for l(k).
l_k = p_k_at_1 + 2 * d_k - 1

# We print the calculation step by step, as requested.
print(f"p_k(1) = {p_k_at_1}")
print(f"d_k = {d_k}")
print(f"l(k) = p_k(1) + 2 * d_k - 1")
print(f"l(k) = {p_k_at_1} + 2 * {d_k} - 1 = {l_k}")

# The final calculated value
print("\nThe exact value of l(k) is:")
print(l_k)
