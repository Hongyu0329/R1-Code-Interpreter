    "To solve this problem, we will use a result from topological combinatorics that relates the number of non-collapsing rooted forests on a simplicial complex to the homology of the underlying topological space.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant theorem:** For a triangulable $d$-dimensional manifold $K$ with boundary $\\partial K$, the number of rooted forests $(F,R)$ where $F$ does not simplicially collapse to $R$ is given by the formula:\n    $N(K) = \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{d} \\beta_i(K) \\right) + \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \\beta_i(\\partial K) \\right)$\n    where $\\beta_i(X)$ is the $i$-th Betti number of the space $X$ (the rank of its $i$-th homology group $H_i(X; \\mathbb{Z})$).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Möbius Band ($K$):** The Möbius band is a 2-dimensional manifold ($d=2$). Topologically, it is homotopy equivalent to a circle ($S^1$), meaning they have the same Betti numbers.\n    *   $\\beta_0(K)$: The band is path-connected, so $\\beta_0(K) = 1$.\n    *   $\\beta_1(K)$: It contains a single non-contractible loop (the central circle), so $\\beta_1(K) = 1$.\n    *   $\\beta_i(K)$: For dimensions greater than 1, the homology is trivial, so $\\beta_i(K) = 0$ for $i \\geq 2$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Boundary of the Möbius Band ($\\partial K$):** The boundary of a Möbius band is a single continuous loop, which is topologically a circle ($S^1$).\n    *   $\\beta_0(\\partial K)$: The boundary is path-connected, so $\\beta_0(\\partial K) = 1$.\n    *   $\\beta_1(\\partial K)$: The boundary itself is a non-contractible loop, so $\\beta_1(\\partial K) = 1$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Number:** We will sum these Betti numbers according to the formula. The Python code below will perform this calculation and print the final result in the required format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mobius_forests():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-collapsing rooted forests on the standard\n    triangulation of the Möbius band using a theorem from topological combinatorics.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The problem asks for the number of rooted forests (F,R) on a simplicial complex K,\n    # triangulating a Möbius band, for which F does not simplicially collapse to R.\n    # This number, N(K), is given by a formula involving the Betti numbers of the\n    # manifold K and its boundary ∂K.\n    # The formula for a d-manifold with boundary is:\n    # N(K) = (sum of Betti numbers of K) + (sum of Betti numbers of ∂K)\n\n    # For the Möbius band, K, d=2.
