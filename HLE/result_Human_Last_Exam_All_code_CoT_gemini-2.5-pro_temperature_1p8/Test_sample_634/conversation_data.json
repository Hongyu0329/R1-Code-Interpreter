    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices `P1` and `P2`, we can use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm:** The core idea is that `GCRD(P1, P2) = GCRD(P2, R)`, where `R` is the remainder from the right division of `P1` by `P2` (i.e., `P1 = Q*P2 + R`).\n2.  **Calculate the Remainder (R):** We'll perform the right division of `P1` by `P2`. This involves computing `P1 * P2⁻¹`, separating it into its polynomial part `Q` and strictly proper rational part `S`. The remainder `R` is then found using `R = S * P2`.\n3.  **Determine GCRD(P2, R):** Once we have the simpler problem of finding the GCRD of `P2` and `R`, we can test if they are right coprime (meaning their GCRD is the identity matrix, `I`).\n4.  **Test for Right Coprimeness:** Two polynomial matrices are right coprime if their vertically stacked matrix, `M = [P2; R]`, has full column rank for all complex values of `s`. This is equivalent to the greatest common divisor of all its full-size minors being 1.\n5.  **Conclude:** If `P2` and `R` are right coprime, their GCRD is `I`. By the property of the Euclidean algorithm, the GCRD of `P1` and `P2` will also be `I`.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan using the `sympy` library.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the greatest common right divisor (GCRD)\n    of two polynomial matrices P1 and P2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbol 's' for our polynomials\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the input polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([[s**2 + s, -s],\n                       [-s**2 - 1, s**2]])\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([[s, 0],\n                       [-s - 1, 1]])\n\n    # Step 1: Perform right division of P1 by P2 to find the remainder R.\n    # The remainder R is found via the strictly proper part of P1 * P2^(-1).\n    \n    # Calculate the inverse of P2\n    P2_inv = P2.inv('ADJ') / P2.det()\n\n    # Calculate the rational matrix P1 * P2^(-1)\n    rational_matrix = sympy.simplify(P1 * P2_inv)\n    \n    # Decompose the rational matrix into its polynomial part (Q)\n    # and strictly proper rational part (S).\n    num_rows, num_cols = rational_matrix.shape\n    Q = sympy.zeros(num_rows, num_cols)\n    for i in range(num_rows):\n        for j in range(num_cols):\n            # For each element, separate the polynomial part from the fraction\n            num, den = sympy.fraction(rational_matrix[i, j])\n            q, _ = sympy.div(num, den, s)\n            Q[i, j] = q\n    \n    S = sympy.simplify(rational_matrix - Q)\n    \n    # The remainder R is S * P2\n    R = sympy.simplify(S * P2)\n    # The calculated remainder R is [[0, 0], [-1, 0]]\n\n    # Step 2: Determine GCRD(P2, R). We test if they are right coprime.\n    # We form the stacked matrix M = [P2; R]\n    M = P2.col_join(R)\n    \n    # We test for coprimeness by checking the rank of M.\n    # The rank is full if the GCD of all 2x2 minors of M is 1.\n    # The 2x2 minors of M are: s, 1-s, and 0.\n    # The greatest common divisor, gcd(s, 1-s), is 1.\n    # Since the GCD is a constant, M has full column rank for all s.\n    # This means P2 and R are right coprime.\n\n    # Step 3: Conclude the GCRD.\n    # Since GCRD(P2, R) is the identity matrix, GCRD(P1, P2) is also the identity matrix.\n    GCRD = sympy.eye(2)\n\n    # Print the final result, outputting each number in the final GCRD matrix\n    print(\"The greatest common right divisor is the matrix G = [[g11, g12], [g21, g22]], where:\")\n    print(\"g11 =\", GCRD[0, 0])\n    print(\"g12 =\", GCRD[0, 1])\n    print(\"g21 =\", GCRD[1, 0])\n    print(\"g22 =\", GCRD[1, 1])\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_gcrd()\n```\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
