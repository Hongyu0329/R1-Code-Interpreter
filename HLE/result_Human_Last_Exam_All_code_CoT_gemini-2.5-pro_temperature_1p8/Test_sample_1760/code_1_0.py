    Analyzes the 15 statements about edit distance metrics and identifies the true ones.

    The final answer is based on the following analysis:
    A) TRUE - Levenshtein distance is a metric and satisfies the triangle inequality.
    B) FALSE - The relationship between L and LT is more complex than the one described.
    C) TRUE - All operations (insertion, deletion, substitution, transposition) are reversible with the same cost, making the distances symmetric. Rotational distance is also symmetric by definition.
    D) TRUE - The common non-metric variant of Damerau-Levenshtein distance (Optimal String Alignment) violates the triangle inequality.
    E) TRUE - Rotational Levenshtein is defined as the minimum Levenshtein distance over all rotations, so it must be less than or equal to the standard Levenshtein distance (which is one of the values considered).
    F) FALSE - The difference L(x,y) - LT(x,y) is bounded by LT(x,y) and is generally O(1) or O(log n) for pathological cases, not Theta(n).
    G) FALSE - Rotational Levenshtein, when properly defined on equivalence classes, forms a metric and satisfies the triangle inequality.
    H) TRUE - The standard dynamic programming algorithms for Levenshtein and Damerau-Levenshtein have a time complexity of O(n*m), and the lower bound is proven to be Omega(n^2) for the general case.
    I) FALSE - If LT violates the triangle inequality (D), it cannot be a pseudometric. If it is a true metric, it's not a pseudometric either.
    J) FALSE - L("rat", "tar") = 2. A calculation of RL("rat", "tar") over all rotations also yields a minimum distance of 2, not 1.
    K) FALSE - Since LT (as per D) is not a metric, this statement is false.
    L) FALSE - A counterexample x="ab", y="ba" gives L=2, LT=1, RL=0.
    M) FALSE - A counterexample with k=4 transpositions can have LT=4, but the bound gives 3.
    N) FALSE - The ratio L(x,y)/LT(x,y) is bounded above by 2.
    O) FALSE - A counterexample x="ab", y="ba" has RL=0 and LT=1.

    The true statements are A, C, D, E, H.
