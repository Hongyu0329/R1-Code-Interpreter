    "My plan is to identify the physicist by dissecting the clues provided in the user's query.\n\n1.  **Physicist & Microscopy:** The person is a physicist known for work in microscopy.\n2.  **Optical Effect & Concave Mirrors:** The discovery was an optical effect related to real images from concave mirrors.\n3.  **Key Anecdote:** The crucial and most unique detail is that the effect was first noticed by a custodial worker.\n\nSearching for a story that combines all these elements leads to the American physicist Paul Kirkpatrick. While a professor at Stanford, a janitor cleaning a large, war-surplus concave searchlight mirror reported seeing a strange, \"ghostly\" image of himself. Kirkpatrick investigated and described the phenomenon of the pseudoscopic (depth-inverted) real image. He is also famous in the microscopy field for co-inventing the Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror system, a foundational technology for X-ray microscopy. He perfectly fits all parts of the description.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print his name.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the name of the physicist who fits the description.\nphysicist_name = \"Paul Kirkpatrick\"\nprint(physicist_name)\n```\n<<<Paul Kirkpatrick>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which physicist better known for work in the microscopy field discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
