    "Here is a plan to compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is 6-dimensional with generators $e_1, \\ldots, e_6$ and non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$, $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$, $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$.\n\nThis Lie algebra can be constructed as a fiber product (or pushout in the dual category) of two smaller Lie algebras. Let's define two Lie algebras:\n1.  $\\mathfrak{g}_1$: a 4-dimensional Lie algebra with basis $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$ and relations $[x_1, x_2] = x_3, [x_1, x_3] = x_4$. This is the standard 4-dimensional filiform nilpotent Lie algebra, often denoted $\\mathfrak{n}_4$.\n2.  $\\mathfrak{g}_2$: a 3-dimensional Lie algebra with basis $\\{y_1, y_2, y_3\\}$ and relation $[y_1, y_2] = y_3$. This is the 3-dimensional Heisenberg algebra, $\\mathfrak{h}_3$.\n\nLet $\\mathfrak{h}$ be the 1-dimensional abelian Lie algebra $\\mathbb{R}$. We can define homomorphisms $\\phi_1: \\mathfrak{h} \\to \\mathfrak{g}_1$ by sending the generator of $\\mathfrak{h}$ to $x_1$, and $\\phi_2: \\mathfrak{h} \\to \\mathfrak{g}_2$ by sending the generator of $\\mathfrak{h}$ to $y_1$.\nThe original Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the fiber product of $\\mathfrak{g}_1$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_2$ over $\\mathfrak{h}$. In simpler terms, we are \"gluing\" $\\mathfrak{g}_1$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_2$ along the common subalgebra $\\mathfrak{h}$ (identifying $x_1$ with $y_1$ as $e_1$, $x_2,x_3,x_4$ with $e_2,e_3,e_4$, and $y_2,y_3$ with $e_5,e_6$).\n\n### Step 2: Use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence property for Poincaré polynomials\n\nFor such a fiber product construction, the Poincaré polynomial of the resulting algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ can be computed from the Poincaré polynomials of its components using the formula:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{P_{\\mathfrak{g}_1}(x) \\cdot P_{\\mathfrak{g}_2}(x)}{P_{\\mathfrak{h}}(x)}$\n\nThis formula arises from the existence of a Künneth-type spectral sequence for the cohomology of the fiber product, which under these favorable conditions (the cohomology of the base $\\mathfrak{h}$ being a free exterior algebra), implies that the cohomology of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the graded tensor product of the cohomologies of $\\mathfrak{g}_1$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_2$ over the cohomology of $\\mathfrak{h}$.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Poincaré polynomials of the components\n\n1.  **For $\\mathfrak{h} = \\mathbb{R}$:** The cohomology algebra is the exterior algebra on one generator of degree 1. The Poincaré polynomial is $P_{\\mathfrak{h}}(x) = 1 + x$.\n\n2.  **For $\\mathfrak{g}_1 = \\mathfrak{n}_4$:** The Chevalley-Eilenberg differential is defined by $de^3 = -e^1 \\wedge e^2$ and $de^4 = -e^1 \\wedge e^3$. A direct calculation of the Betti numbers gives $b_0=1, b_1=2, b_2=2, b_3=2, b_4=1$. So, $P_{\\mathfrak{n}_4}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4$.\n\n3.  **For $\\mathfrak{g}_2 = \\mathfrak{h}_3$:** The differential is defined by $de^3 = -e^1 \\wedge e^2$. A direct calculation of the Betti numbers gives $b_0=1, b_1=2, b_2=2, b_3=1$. So, $P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3$. We can note that this polynomial factors as $(1+x)(1+x+x^2)$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the final Poincaré polynomial for $\\mathfrak{g}$\n\nNow, we can substitute the component polynomials into the formula:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{(1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) \\cdot (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3)}{1 + x}$\n\nSince $P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) = (1+x)(1+x+x^2)$, the expression simplifies to:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) \\cdot (1 + x + x^2)$\n\nWe will use Python to carry out this polynomial multiplication and format the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef poly_to_string(coeffs, var='x'):\n    \"\"\"Converts a list of polynomial coefficients to a string.\"\"\"\n    parts = []\n    for i, c in enumerate(coeffs):\n        if c == 0:\n            continue\n        # Term part\n        if i == 0:\n            term = str(c)\n        elif i == 1:\n            term = f\"{c}{var}\" if c != 1 else var\n        else:\n            term = f\"{c}{var}^{i}\" if c != 1 else f\"{var}^{i}\"\n        \n        # Sign part\n        if not parts:\n             parts.append(term)\n        elif c > 0:\n            parts.append(f\" + {term}\")\n        else:\n            # this case won't happen with the current problem\n            parts.append(f\" - {str(abs(c)) + term if abs(c)!=1 else term}\")\n\n    return \"\".join(parts[::-1]) # reverse for standard poly order\n\n# Coefficients of the polynomials, from degree 0 to max\n# P_n4(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4\np_n4 = [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n# P_h3(x) / P_R(x) = (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3) / (1+x) = 1 + x + x^2\np_quotient = [1, 1, 1]\n\n# Perform polynomial multiplication\np_g = np.polymul(p_n4[::-1], p_quotient[::-1])[::-1]\np_g_coeffs = [int(c) for c in p_g]\n\nfinal_poly_str = poly_to_string(p_g_coeffs, 'x')\n\nprint(\"The Poincaré polynomial P(x) is the product of P_n4(x) and (P_h3(x)/(1+x)).\")\nprint(f\"P_n4(x) = {poly_to_string([1,2,2,2,1])}\")\nprint(f\"P_h3(x) / (1+x) = {poly_to_string([1,1,1])}\")\nprint(f\"\\nP(x) = ({poly_to_string([1,2,2,2,1])}) * ({poly_to_string([1,1,1])})\")\nprint(f\"P(x) = {final_poly_str}\")\n\n# Final Answer formatting as requested\nequation_parts = []\nfor i, c in enumerate(p_g_coeffs):\n    if c == 0:\n        continue\n    \n    if i == 0:\n        part_str = f\"{c}\"\n    elif i == 1:\n        part_str = f\"{c}x\" if c != 1 else \"x\"\n    else:\n        part_str = f\"{c}x^{i}\" if c != 1 else f\"x^{i}\"\n    equation_parts.append(part_str)\n\nfinal_equation = \" + \".join(equation_parts[::-1])\nprint(f\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"{final_equation}\")\n\n# Final Answer Wrapper\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer in specified format:\")\nprint(f\"<<<{final_equation}>>>\")\n```"
