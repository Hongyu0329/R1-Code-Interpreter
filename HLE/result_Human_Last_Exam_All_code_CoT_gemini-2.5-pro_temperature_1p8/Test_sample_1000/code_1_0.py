# The problem asks for the smallest possible number of elements in a subset Y of X
# such that for any V in X, the sum of intersections of V with elements of Y equals V.
# Let n be the dimension of the ambient space F_p^n, so n = 2023.
# Let d be the dimension of the subspaces in X, so d = 2000.
# Let m be the codimension, m = n - d = 2023 - 2000 = 23.

# Let's analyze the condition: sum_{W in Y} (V intersect W) = V.
# This problem can be analyzed in the dual space. The condition is equivalent to
# choosing a set of m-dimensional subspaces {B_i} in the dual space U^* such that for any
# m-dimensional subspace A (the dual of V), the intersection of the sums (A + B_i) is A itself.
# cap_i (A + B_i) = A.

# This will hold if and only if for any m-dimensional subspace A, and for any vector x not in A,
# there is at least one B_i such that x is not in A + B_i.
# In the quotient space U^*/A, this means that the intersection of the projected subspaces pi_A(B_i) must be trivial.

# This is a known problem in finite geometry. A standard argument for a similar setting
# where subspaces are hyperplanes (m=1) gives k = d+1.
# Let's test this with a simple case: n=3, d=2 (planes in 3D). m=1.
# Let V be a plane. Let W_i be other planes. V intersect W_i is a line (since n < d+d).
# The sum of these intersection lines must be the plane V.
# This fails if all intersection lines are collinear. This happens if V and all W_i belong
# to the same pencil of planes (i.e., all sharing a common line).
# To prevent this, we need to choose W_i such that their normal vectors are not all coplanar with V's normal vector.
# Choosing 3 planes W_1, W_2, W_3 whose normal vectors are linearly independent guarantees
# that for any plane V, at least two of the intersection lines V intersect W_i will be distinct,
# thus spanning V.
# For n=3, d=2, the answer is k=3. This is d+1.

# This result generalizes. The smallest size of Y is k = d + 1.

# Set the dimensions based on the problem statement.
d = 2000
n = 2023

# The codimension m = n - d.
m = n - d

# The smallest possible number of elements in Y is d + 1.
result = d + 1

# Print the final equation
