    "This question is about pharmaceutical guidelines for sterile compounding, specifically from USP <797>. A single-dose ampule is a glass container that is broken open and cannot be resealed. Because it becomes an open system, it is highly susceptible to contamination.\n\nMy plan is to create a Python script that explains the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) rule for this specific scenario. The script will:\n1.  Define the type of container (single-dose ampule) and the environment (sterile).\n2.  State the official guideline regarding its use after opening.\n3.  Print the final BUD for this situation.\n\nThis will provide a clear, executable explanation of the pharmaceutical rule.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef get_single_dose_bud(container_type, environment):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for single-dose containers based on USP <797> guidelines.\n\n    Args:\n        container_type (str): The type of container ('ampule' or 'vial').\n        environment (str): The environment where the container is opened ('sterile' for ISO 5 or 'non-sterile').\n    \"\"\"\n    container_type = container_type.lower()\n    environment = environment.lower()\n\n    print(f\"Calculating BUD for a single-dose '{container_type}' opened in a '{environment}' environment...\")\n    print(\"---\")\n\n    if container_type == \"ampule\":\n        bud = \"Immediate Use\"\n        explanation = (\"According to USP <797> guidelines, once a glass ampule is opened, \"\n                       \"it cannot be resealed. Therefore, its contents must be used immediately. \"\n                       \"Any unused portion must be discarded and cannot be stored for any period.\")\n        print(f\"Rule: {explanation}\")\n        print(\"---\")\n        print(f\"Final BUD: {bud}\")\n        # We use a special return format for the final answer expected by the system.\n        return f\"<<<{bud}>>>\"\n\n    elif container_type == \"vial\":\n        if environment == \"sterile\":\n            bud = \"12 hours\"\n            explanation = (\"A single-dose vial (with a rubber stopper) entered in an ISO Class 5 \"\n                           \"or cleaner environment may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial puncture.\")\n        else:\n            bud = \"1 hour\"\n            explanation = (\"A single-dose vial entered in an environment worse than ISO Class 5 \"\n                           \"must be used within 1 hour or discarded.\")\n        print(f\"Rule: {explanation}\")\n        print(\"---\")\n        print(f\"Final BUD: {bud}\")\n        return f\"<<<{bud}>>>\"\n    else:\n        print(f\"Error: Container type '{container_type}' not recognized. Use 'ampule' or 'vial'.\")\n        return \"<<<Invalid Input>>>\"\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # This specifically addresses the user's question.\n    # The return value from the function is captured but not printed here,\n    # as the final answer is meant to be at the very end of the response.\n    get_single_dose_bud(container_type=\"ampule\", environment=\"sterile\")\n```\n<<<Immediate Use>>>"
