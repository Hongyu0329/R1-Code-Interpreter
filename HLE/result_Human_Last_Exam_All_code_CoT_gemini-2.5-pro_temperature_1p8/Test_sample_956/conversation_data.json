    "My plan to solve this problem involves these main steps:\n1.  First, I need to identify the abstract group structure of $G$. The group $G$ is given by generators acting on a set of 12 elements. I'll use the Python library `sympy` to construct this group and determine its properties, specifically its order, and check for isomorphism with known groups of that size, like the Mathieu group $M_{12}$.\n2.  Next, I must determine the Schur multiplier $A$ of $G$. The Schur multiplier for many finite simple groups is a well-known result in group theory. I will rely on this established knowledge once $G$ is identified.\n3.  Then, I will analyze the subgroup structure of the resulting abelian group $A$.\n4.  Finally, I will count the number of proper subgroups of $A$ up to isomorphism. A proper subgroup is any subgroup of $A$ other than $A$ itself. Two subgroups are in the same isomorphism class if they are isomorphic as abstract groups.\n\nI will now implement this plan in a Python script. The script will first identify $G$ and then print out the reasoning to find the number of proper subgroups of its Schur multiplier.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n# It's better to install sympy first, for example, by running 'pip install sympy' in your shell.\ntry:\n    from sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation\n    from sympy.combinatorics.perm_groups import PermutationGroup, MathieuGroup\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Sympy library not found.
