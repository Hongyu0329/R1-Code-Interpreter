However, the superconducting core expels the field from the center, reducing the effective area for guiding compared to a solid ferromagnetic cylinder. It is stronger than case 2 but weaker than case 1.",

The ferromagnetic core (like in Scenario 1) strongly concentrates the flux, and the surrounding superconducting shell (like in Scenario 2) provides perfect confinement, preventing any flux from leaking out. This creates the most effective magnetic waveguide."
