    "To solve the problem of finding the value of the infinite product\n$$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) $$\nI will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Factor the general term**: The term inside the product, $1 - \\frac{z^3}{n^3}$, can be factored using the three cube roots of unity: $1, \\omega, \\omega^2$, where $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$. The factorization is:\n    $$ 1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega^2}{n}\\right) $$\n\n2.  **Rewrite the infinite product**: Substituting the factored form back into the product, we get:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty} \\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega^2}{n}\\right) $$\n    This can be viewed as the product of three separate infinite products.\n\n3.  **Use the Weierstrass product for the Gamma function**: An individual product like $\\prod (1-z/n)$ diverges. However, the combination of the three products converges. This is because the Weierstrass product form for the Gamma function, which ensures convergence, is $\\prod (1+z/n)e^{-z/n}$. For our problem, the convergence factors would be $e^{z/n}$, $e^{z\\omega/n}$, and $e^{z\\omega^2/n}$. Their product for each $n$ is $e^{(z+z\\omega+z\\omega^2)/n} = e^{z(1+\\omega+\\omega^2)/n} = e^0 = 1$. Thus, we can use the known identity related to the Gamma function's product representation:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{x}{n}\\right)e^{x/n} = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-x)} $$\n    Applying this to our combined product gives the formula for the product starting from $n=1$:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\n\n4.  **Adjust the starting index**: The problem asks for the product starting from $n=3$. To get this, we take the result from step 3 and divide by the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n\n5.  **Final Expression**: Substituting the formulas, we arrive at the final closed-form expression:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{(1-z^3)(1-z^3/8)\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\n\nThe following Python code generates and prints this final equation, clearly indicating all the numbers and symbols involved.\n\n```python\n# Define constants from the problem statement.\npower = 3\nn_start = 3\nexcluded_indices = [1, 2]\n\n# Define Unicode symbols for clearer mathematical notation in the output.\nprod_sym = \"\\u220F\"      # Product symbol (Π)\ninf_sym = \"\\u221E\"       # Infinity symbol (∞)\ngamma_sym = \"\\u0393\"     # Gamma symbol (Γ)\nomega_sym = \"\\u03C9\"     # Omega symbol (ω)\npi_sym = \"\\u03C0\"        # Pi symbol (π)\n\n# Construct the left-hand side of the equation string.\nlhs = f\"{prod_sym}_{{n={n_start}}}^{inf_sym} (1 - z^{power}/n^{power})\"\n\n# Construct the right-hand side of the equation string.\n\n# First, create the part for the terms that are divided out (n=1 and n=2).\nexcluded_terms_list = []\nfor n in excluded_indices:\n    denominator = n**power\n    if denominator == 1:\n        excluded_terms_list.append(f\"(1 - z^{power})\")\n    else:\n        excluded_terms_list.append(f\"(1 - z^{power}/{denominator})\")\nexcluded_part_str = \" * \".join(excluded_terms_list)\n\n# Then, create the Gamma function product part.\ngamma_part_str = f\"{gamma_sym}(1-z){gamma_sym}(1 - z*{omega_sym}){gamma_sym}(1 - z*{omega_sym}^2)\"\n\n# Assemble the full right-hand side.\nrhs = f\"1 / ({excluded_part_str} * {gamma_part_str})\"\n\n# Combine LHS and RHS to form the final equation.\nfinal_equation = f\"{lhs} = {rhs}\"\n\n# Create the definition for the omega symbol.\nomega_definition = f\"where {omega_sym} = exp(2*{pi_sym}*i/{power}) is a primitive cube root of unity.\"\n\n# Print the final result.\nprint(final_equation)\nprint(omega_definition)\n```\n<<<∏_{n=3}^∞ (1 - z^3/n^3) = 1 / ((1 - z^3) * (1 - z^3/8) * Γ(1-z)Γ(1 - z*ω)Γ(1 - z*ω^2))\nwhere ω = exp(2*π*i/3) is a primitive cube root of unity.>>>"
