    "Of course, I can help you with this. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the integral for small $\\epsilon$**: The integral is $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the term $\\epsilon$ becomes very small. The denominator, $f(x) = 9.0 x^5 + 5.0 x^6 + 9.0 x^8$, is zero at $x=0$. This means the integrand becomes very large near $x=0$, and the main contribution to the integral comes from this region.\n\n2.  **Approximate the denominator**: Near $x=0$, the behavior of the polynomial $f(x)$ is dominated by its term with the lowest power of $x$. In this case, that term is $9.0 x^{5.0}$. So, we can approximate $f(x) \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$ for small $x$.\n\n3.  **Approximate the integral**: We can now approximate the original integral with a simpler one. We also extend the upper integration limit from $15.0$ to infinity. This is a valid approximation because the contribution from large $x$ (where the approximation of $f(x)$ is not as good) is negligible compared to the contribution from the singularity at $x=0$ for small $\\epsilon$.\n    The approximated integral is: $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n\n4.  **Solve the approximated integral**: This integral is a standard form that can be solved analytically. The solution gives us the leading-order asymptotic behavior of $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$. The general form of the solution for an integral of type $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dx}{\\epsilon+ax^p}$ is $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\cdot \\epsilon^k$.\n\n5.  **Develop the Python Code**: I will write a Python script that calculates the constants $C$ and $k$ based on the parameters $a=9.0$ and $p=5.0$ from the problem. The script will then print the final analytical formula in a clear, readable format, showing how the numbers in the formula are derived.\n\nHere is the Python code to generate the formula:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef approximate_integral_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function derives and prints the analytical formula that approximates\n    I(epsilon) for small epsilon.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The integral is of the form integral(1/(epsilon + f(x))) dx\n    # where f(x) = 9.0*x**5.0 + 5.0*x**6.0 + 9.0*x**8.0.\n    # For small x, the behavior of f(x) is dominated by the term with the\n    # lowest power, which is a*x**p.\n    a = 9.0\n    p = 5.0\n    \n    # The approximation for small epsilon is of the form I(epsilon) ≈ C * epsilon**k.\n    \n    # The exponent k is derived from a scaling analysis and is equal to -(p-1)/p.\n    k_numerator = int(-(p - 1))\n    k_denominator = int(p)\n    k_val = k_numerator / k_denominator\n    \n    # The coefficient C is given by the formula: pi / (p * a**(1/p) * sin(pi/p)).\n    C_val = math.pi / (p * (a**(1.0/p)) * math.sin(math.pi/p))\n    \n    # Print the detailed analytical formula.\n    print(\"The analytical formula that approximates I(epsilon) for the small epsilon regime is:\")\n    # We display each number that constitutes the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) ≈ (π / ({p} * ({a})**(1/{p}) * sin(π/{p}))) * epsilon**({k_numerator}/{k_denominator})\")\n    \n    # Print the numerically evaluated version of the formula for practical use.\n    print(\"\\nThis evaluates to the approximate formula:\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) ≈ {C_val:.5f} * epsilon**({k_val})\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    approximate_integral_formula()\n\n```\n<<<(π / (5.0 * (9.0)**(1/5.0) * sin(π/5.0))) * epsilon**(-4.0/5.0)>>>"
