    Solves the minimum path cover problem by reducing it to a maximum bipartite matching problem.

    The overall algorithm is as follows:
    1.  First, we determine the shortest distance from the source S to all other nodes. This can be done with a Breadth-First Search (BFS).
    2.  Using these distances, we construct a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where a directed edge u -> v exists only if (u, v) is an edge in the original graph and dist(v) = dist(u) + 1. Any path from S in this DAG is a shortest path in the original graph.
    3.  The problem is now to find the minimum number of paths from S to cover all nodes in this DAG. This is a classic "minimum path cover" problem. The size of a minimum vertex-disjoint path cover in a DAG is given by the formula |V| - |M|, where |V| is the number of vertices and |M| is the size of the maximum matching in a corresponding bipartite graph.
    4.  We build the bipartite graph: for each node v in the DAG, we create two nodes v_out and v_in. For each edge u -> v in the DAG, we add an edge from u_out to v_in in the bipartite graph.
    5.  We find the maximum matching in this bipartite graph using an algorithm like Hopcroft-Karp or augmenting paths with DFS/BFS.
    6.  The final result is |V| - |M|. Note that S itself does not need to be matched on the "in" side, as no paths go into S.
    
    This code implements this logic for the provided Example 2.
