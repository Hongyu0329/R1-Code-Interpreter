def solve_group_theory_problem():
    """
    This function solves the mathematical problem described.
    
    The problem asks for the largest possible value of I_G, where
    I_G = min{|G / <A>|} over all discrete subsets A of G, and G is any
    countably infinite non-discrete Hausdorff topological group.
    
    Our analysis shows that while I_G can be 1 for some groups, there exists
    at least one group G (the group of finitary permutations of N)
    for which I_G is countably infinite.
    
    The cardinality of a countably infinite set is denoted by Aleph-null (aleph_0).
    Since G itself is countably infinite, no quotient group can be larger than this.
    Therefore, the largest possible value for I_G is aleph_0.
