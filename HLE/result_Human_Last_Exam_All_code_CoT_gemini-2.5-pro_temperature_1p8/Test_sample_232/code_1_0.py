    Calculates the number of regions created by the folds of a standard origami crane.

    This problem is solved using Euler's formula for planar graphs (R = E - V + 1),

    and V is the number of vertices (crease intersections).

    For the standard origami crane crease pattern, the number of vertices and
    edges are well-established values in origami mathematics.
