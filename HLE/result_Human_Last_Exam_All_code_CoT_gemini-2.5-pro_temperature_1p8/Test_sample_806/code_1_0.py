    Explains the biochemical cascade leading to drug-induced skin blisters (SJS/TEN).

    explanation = """
The clinical presentation described, particularly the development of skin blisters after starting a new anticonvulsant, is characteristic of a severe cutaneous adverse reaction like Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN).

The specific biochemical process is a delayed-type (Type IV) hypersensitivity reaction initiated and executed by the patient's own immune cells. Here is the step-by-step cascade:

1.  **Initial Molecular Interaction:** The anticonvulsant drug molecule directly and non-covalently binds to a specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) protein on the surface of the patient's cells.

2.  **Immune System Activation:** This drug-HLA complex is recognized as 'foreign' by specific T-cell receptors on cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (a type of immune cell). This recognition activates the T-cells, causing them to multiply.

3.  **Targeting Skin Cells:** These activated T-cells circulate throughout the body and home in on the skin. They identify the same drug-HLA complex being presented on skin cells (keratinocytes).

4.  **The Key Reaction:** Upon recognizing the target skin cells, the activated T-cells release cytotoxic granules. The most critical and potent molecule in these granules responsible for the pathology is **Granulysin**.

5.  **Result (Skin Blisters):** Granulysin induces widespread apoptosis (programmed cell death) of the keratinocytes. This mass cell death causes the epidermis (the outer layer of skin) to separate from the underlying dermis, leading to the formation of blisters and sloughing of the skin.

Therefore, the specific biochemical reaction that directly causes the blisters is the release of granulysin by activated T-cells, which leads to extensive keratinocyte death.
