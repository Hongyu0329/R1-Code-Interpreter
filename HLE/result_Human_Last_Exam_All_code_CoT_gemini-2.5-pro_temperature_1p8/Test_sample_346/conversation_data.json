    "This problem requires us to evaluate a complex expression in SKI combinator logic to find a Church integer `n`, and then compute `log_2(n)`.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the SKI Expression**: Break down the large expression into its main components. We will identify known combinators and smaller, repeated expressions.\n2.  **Evaluate Components as Church Numerals**: We'll evaluate the parts of the expression. The SKI combinators `S`, `K`, and `I` have specific reduction rules. Church numerals represent integers as higher-order functions. For example, `1` is represented by `I`, `2` by `S(I)(I)`, and the successor function (`n -> n+1`) is `S(S(K(S))(K))`. We will use these facts to evaluate sub-expressions to their integer equivalents.\n3.  **Handle nested operations**: The expression involves nesting operators like `S(I)`. We will analyze the behavior of `S(I)` when applied to Church numerals. The reduction `S(I) x y` becomes `y(x(y))`.\n4.  **Calculate the final integer `n`**: By repeatedly applying the reduction rules and interpreting the operations on Church numerals (like exponentiation `e(b)` -> `b^e` and a successor-like operation for `S(I)`), we will find the final integer value `n`.\n5.  **Compute `log_2(n)`**: With the integer `n` found, we will calculate its base-2 logarithm using Python's `math` library.\n6.  **Format the Output**: The final Python code will print out the key numbers and the final equation for `log_2(n)`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for n from the SKI expression and computes log2(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the components of the expression.\n    # The expression is E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A(I))))(A(B)))), where:\n    # A = S(S(K(S))(K)), which is the successor function (n -> n+1) for Church numerals.\n    # I is Church numeral 1.\n    # B = S(I)(I), which is Church numeral 2.\n    \n    # Step 2: Evaluate the arguments of the innermost operation.\n    # A(I) is succ(1), which is 2.\n    val_AI = 2\n    \n    # A(B) is succ(2), which is 3.\n    val_AB = 3\n    \n    # Step 3: Evaluate the inner part of the expression.\n    # The structure S(I)(x)(y) reduces to y(x(y)).\n    # Here, x = K(A(I)) = K(2), and y = A(B) = 3.\n    # The expression becomes 3(K(2)(3)).\n    # K(2)(3) reduces to 2.\n    # So we get 3(2). In Church numeral arithmetic, e(b) represents b^e.\n    # Therefore, 3(2) represents 2^3.\n    inner_result = val_AI ** val_AB  # 2^3 = 8\n    \n    # Step 4: Evaluate the full expression.\n    # The expression simplifies to E = S(I)(S(I)(8)).\n    # Let's analyze the operator Op = S(I). When applied to a church numeral `c_k`,\n    # the expression `Op(c_k)` evaluates to a function that acts as `c_{k+1}`.\n    # In essence, S(I) acts as a successor function in this context.\n    # E = succ(succ(8))\n    n = inner_result + 1 + 1 # 8 + 1 + 1 = 10\n    \n    # Step 5: Compute the final result.\n    log_2_n = math.log2(n)\n    \n    print(f\"The inner part of the expression evaluates to 2^{3} = {inner_result}.\")\n    print(f\"The full expression applies a successor-like operator twice to 8.\")\n    print(f\"The final church integer is n = 8 + 1 + 1 = {n}.\")\n    print(f\"The calculation for log_2(n) is:\")\n    print(f\"log_2({n}) = {log_2_n}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<3.3219280948873626>>>"
