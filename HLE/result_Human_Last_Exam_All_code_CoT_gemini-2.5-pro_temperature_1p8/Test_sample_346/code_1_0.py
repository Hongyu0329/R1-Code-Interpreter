    # Step 1: Define the components of the expression.
    # The expression is E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A(I))))(A(B)))), where:
    # A = S(S(K(S))(K)), which is the successor function (n -> n+1) for Church numerals.
    # I is Church numeral 1.
    # B = S(I)(I), which is Church numeral 2.
    
    # Step 2: Evaluate the arguments of the innermost operation.
    # A(I) is succ(1), which is 2.
    val_AI = 2
    
    # A(B) is succ(2), which is 3.
    val_AB = 3
    
    # Step 3: Evaluate the inner part of the expression.
    # The structure S(I)(x)(y) reduces to y(x(y)).
    # Here, x = K(A(I)) = K(2), and y = A(B) = 3.
    # The expression becomes 3(K(2)(3)).
    # K(2)(3) reduces to 2.
    # So we get 3(2). In Church numeral arithmetic, e(b) represents b^e.
    # Therefore, 3(2) represents 2^3.
    inner_result = val_AI ** val_AB  # 2^3 = 8
    
    # Step 4: Evaluate the full expression.
    # The expression simplifies to E = S(I)(S(I)(8)).
    # Let's analyze the operator Op = S(I). When applied to a church numeral `c_k`,
    # the expression `Op(c_k)` evaluates to a function that acts as `c_{k+1}`.
    # In essence, S(I) acts as a successor function in this context.
    # E = succ(succ(8))
    n = inner_result + 1 + 1 # 8 + 1 + 1 = 10
    
    # Step 5: Compute the final result.
