    This function encapsulates the theoretical analysis and prints the final answer.

    The analysis yields the following bounds for the maximum number of steps, T(n):
    1. For a forest with max degree <= sqrt(log n): T(n) = Theta(sqrt(log n)).
       This growth rate falls into category 6.
    2. For a forest with max degree <= log n: T(n) = Theta(log n).
       This growth rate falls into category 8.
    3. For any forest: T(n) = Theta(log n).
       This growth rate falls into category 8.

    The resulting three-digit number is 688.
