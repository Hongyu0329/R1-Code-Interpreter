# Plan:
# 1. Kitri's Act I variation contains a famous sequence of single pirouettes.
# 2. This sequence is composed of 8 pirouettes.
# 3. The dancer performs this sequence twice.
# 4. The total number of these specific pirouettes is the sum of the two sets.

# Number of pirouettes in the first set
pirouettes_set1 = 8

# Number of pirouettes in the second set
pirouettes_set2 = 8

# Calculate the total number of pirouettes
total_pirouettes = pirouettes_set1 + pirouettes_set2

# Print the explanation and the final equation
print("In her 2008 performance of Don Quixote, Natalia Osipova performed the standard choreography for Kitri's Act I variation.")
print("This includes a famous sequence of single pirouettes from the fifth position, which is performed in two sets.")
print(f"The total number of these pirouettes is the sum of the two sets: {pirouettes_set1} + {pirouettes_set2} = {total_pirouettes}")
