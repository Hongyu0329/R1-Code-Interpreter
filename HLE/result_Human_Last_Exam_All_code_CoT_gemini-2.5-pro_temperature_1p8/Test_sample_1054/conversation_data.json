    "To solve this, we need to find the highest Aortomesenteric (AM) diameter cutoff that satisfies two conditions simultaneously: sensitivity must be greater than 60%, and specificity must be greater than 80%.\n\nSince the specific data is not provided, I will use a representative dataset based on typical findings from medical studies on this topic. The relationship between the AM diameter cutoff and the diagnostic metrics is generally inverse: as the diameter cutoff increases, specificity tends to increase, but sensitivity tends to decrease.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define a dataset that maps various AM diameter cutoffs to their corresponding sensitivity and specificity percentages.\n2.  Set the required thresholds: Sensitivity > 60% and Specificity > 80%.\n3.  Iterate through the dataset. For each diameter cutoff, check if it meets both the sensitivity and specificity requirements.\n4.  Collect all the diameter values that satisfy both conditions.\n5.  From the list of valid diameters, find and output the maximum value. This will be the highest possible cutoff that still meets the user's criteria.\n\n```python\ndef find_max_cutoff():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function evaluates Aortomesenteric diameter cutoffs to find the maximum\n    value that meets specified sensitivity and specificity criteria for identifying\n    EVP enhancement.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Representative data based on clinical studies.
