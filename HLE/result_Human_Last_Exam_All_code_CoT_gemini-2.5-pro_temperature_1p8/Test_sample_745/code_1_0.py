def solve_topology_problem():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the specified topology problem.

    The problem asks for the largest number of components the space X \ C can have,
    given the following conditions:
    - X is a connected T1 topological space of cardinality c (the continuum).
    - A is a connected subset of X.
    - C is a connected component of X \ A.

    While simple examples might suggest a small number, the maximum possible
    number is in fact c, the cardinality of the continuum. This result is
    established using advanced topological constructions (e.g., involving
    indecomposable continua or other "pathological" spaces) that are beyond
    the scope of a simple script.

    The cardinality of the continuum, c, is the size of the set of real numbers,
    and it is equal to 2 raised to the power of aleph_null (the cardinality
    of the natural numbers).
