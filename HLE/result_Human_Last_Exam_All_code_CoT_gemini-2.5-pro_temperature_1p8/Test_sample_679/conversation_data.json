    "My plan is to determine the structure of the hydrocarbon C7H14 by systematically analyzing the provided molecular formula and 13C NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: I will first calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) from the formula C7H14. This will tell me if the compound contains double bonds or rings.\n2.  **Analyze the 13C NMR Data**:\n    *   I will examine the number of signals (6) versus the number of carbon atoms (7) to confirm the presence of molecular symmetry.\n    *   I will analyze the chemical shifts (ppm values) to identify the types of carbons present (e.g., alkene vs. alkyl).\n    *   I will use the multiplicity information (s, t, d, q) which corresponds to DEPT information, to determine the number of hydrogens attached to each carbon (s = quaternary C, d = CH, t = CH2, q = CH3).\n3.  **Deduce Structural Fragments**: Based on the NMR data, I will identify the key structural components of the molecule, such as the type of double bond and the nature of the alkyl groups.\n4.  **Assemble the Final Structure**: I will piece together the identified fragments to form a complete structure that is consistent with the molecular formula and all the NMR data. I'll test candidate structures until I find one that perfectly matches all the evidence.\n5.  **Provide the IUPAC Name**: Once the correct structure is identified, I will determine its official IUPAC name.\n\nThe Python code will print out this entire reasoning process, showing how each piece of data contributes to the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided molecular formula and 13C NMR data to determine the\n    IUPAC name of the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_signals = {\n        145: 's', \n        112: 't', \n        48: 't', \n        27: 'd', \n        22: 'q', \n        21: 'q'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula\")\n    print(f\"Formula: {formula}\")\n    C = 7\n    H = 14\n    dbe = C - (H / 2) + 1\n    print(f\"The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as C - (H/2) + 1 = {C} - ({H}/2) + 1 = {int(dbe)}.\")\n    print(\"A DBE of 1 indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the 13C NMR Data\")\n    print(f\"Signals (ppm, multiplicity): {nmr_signals}\")\n    num_signals = len(nmr_signals)\n    print(f\"There are {num_signals} signals for {C} carbon atoms.
