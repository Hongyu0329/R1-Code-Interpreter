    "Of course. Let's break down this organic chemistry problem step-by-step.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants:** I will first identify the starting material, `N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide`, and the reagents. The key reagents are `sec-BuLi/TMEDA` (a strong base system) and `methyl iodide` (an electrophile).\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:** This reaction is a classic example of Directed *ortho*-Metalation (DoM). The functional groups on the benzene ring will \"direct\" the base to remove a specific proton.\n3.  **Identify the Reaction Site:** The starting material has two directing groups: the amide (`-CONEt2`) and the dimethylamino (`-NMe2`). The proton at the C2 position is *ortho* to both of these groups, making it exceptionally acidic and the prime target for deprotonation by `sec-BuLi`. This will form a nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate.\n4.  **Determine the Final Product:** The aryllithium intermediate will then react with the electrophile, `methyl iodide`. The nucleophilic carbon anion on the ring will attack the methyl group, forming a new carbon-carbon bond and displacing the iodide. This adds a methyl group to the C2 position.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that uses the `rdkit` library to represent the final product. The script will:\n    *   State the chemical reasoning behind the reaction outcome.\n    *   Define the product molecule using its SMILES string.\n    *   Calculate and print useful information about the product, such as its name, molecular formula, and molecular weight.\n    *   Fulfill the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\" by breaking down the molecular formula of the product into its elemental counts (e.g., C: 14, H: 22, etc.).\n\nNow, let's execute the plan with the following code.\n\n```python\n# The user needs to have rdkit installed.
