    "My plan is to answer your question about dwarf cuttlefish neuroanatomy. Since the request requires a code-based solution, I will first identify the specific brain regions from my knowledge base. Then, I will write a Python script that programmatically stores this information and uses a `print` function to display the answer clearly.\n\n```python\ndef get_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function retrieves information about brain regions adjacent to the\n    palliovisceral lobe in a dwarf cuttlefish based on known cephalopod neuroanatomy.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The palliovisceral lobe is a major component of the posterior suboesophageal mass.\n    # The regions lying directly posterior to it control the fins and posterior chromatophores.\n    posterior_regions = {\n        \"Fin Lobes\": \"Control the movement of the fins.\",\n        \"Posterior Chromatophore Lobes\": \"Control the color-changing skin cells (chromatophores) on the posterior part of the body.\"\n    }\n    return posterior_regions\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to execute the script.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Based on cephalopod neuroanatomy, the brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are:\")\n    \n    regions = get_adjacent_brain_regions()\n    \n    for region, description in regions.items():\n        print(f\"\\n- Region: {region}\")\n        print(f\"  Function: {description}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<The fin lobes and the posterior chromatophore lobes lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
