    "Here is my plan to arrive at the correct answer.\n1.  I will first identify the core question, which is to name the first Israeli statute that explicitly introduced the legal concept of \"good faith.\"\n2.  I will access my knowledge base regarding Israeli legal history, specifically focusing on the development of its civil and contract law after the state's establishment in 1948.\n3.  I will search for the term \"good faith\" or its Hebrew equivalent, \"Tom Lev\" (תום לב), in the context of major Israeli legislation.\n4.  My search will identify the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973** as the landmark legislation that formally and broadly introduced the duty to act in good faith into Israeli law, particularly in sections 12 (negotiations) and 39 (performance of a contract). While the concept may have appeared in narrow contexts earlier, this is universally recognized as its primary introduction as a general principle.\n5.  I will adhere to the user's specific formatting requirements: provide the answer in a Python code block, do not include the year of the statute or the word \"the\", and use the `print()` function.\n6.  Finally, I will present the answer in the specified `<<<answer>>>` format at the end.\n\n```python\n# This script will print the name of the first statute in the modern State of Israel\n# that explicitly introduced the concept of \"good faith\" as a general principle.\n\n# The identified statute is the Contracts (General Part) Law.\n# As per the instructions, the year is omitted from the final answer.\n\nstatute_name = \"Contracts (General Part) Law\"\nprint(statute_name)\n```\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
