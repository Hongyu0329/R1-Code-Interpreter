def count_subcontinuum_orbits():
    """
    Calculates the smallest number of topologically distinct compactifications
    by finding a space X that minimizes the number of subcontinuum orbits.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. The number of distinct compactifications of the ray with remainder X is
       the number of orbits of subcontinua of X under Aut(X).
    2. We seek to find a space X that minimizes this number. The minimum is at least 1.
    3. We test the space X = {a, b}, a two-point discrete space. This space is
       nondegenerate, locally connected, compact, and metric.
    4. The subcontinua of X are its connected subsets, which are just {a} and {b}.
    5. The homeomorphisms of X (Aut(X)) are all permutations of its points.
       This includes the identity and the swap map h(a)=b, h(b)=a.
    6. We apply the homeomorphisms to the subcontinua to find the orbits.
       The swap map sends {a} to {b}, so they are in the same orbit.
    7. Since all subcontinua are in one orbit, the number of orbits is 1.
       This is the minimum possible number.
