In his book "The Disneyization of Society" (2004), sociologist Alan Bryman outlines four primary dimensions of the process of Disneyization. These are:

1.  **Theming:** The process of applying a narrative or concept to an institution or location to create a unified, story-like experience. For example, a theme restaurant or a themed hotel.
2.  **Hybrid Consumption:** The blurring of lines between different forms of consumption, where various consumer activities are intertwined in one location. For instance, a retail store that is also an eatery and an entertainment venue.
3.  **Merchandising:** The promotion and sale of goods bearing logos or images related to the theme or brand, turning an experience into a tangible, purchasable item.
4.  **Performative Labor:** The requirement for employees to not just complete tasks but to perform them, often involving emotional labor, scripted interactions, and acting as part of the themed environment.

Based on these four dimensions, let's analyze the options:

-   A. hybrid consumption and merchandising: Both are correct dimensions identified by Bryman.
-   B. performative labor and sanitization: "Sanitization" is a feature of Disney parks, but it's not one of Bryman's four core theoretical dimensions.
-   C. trivialization and theming: While "theming" is a core dimension, "trivialization" is a critique or consequence of Disneyization, not a dimension itself.
-   D. sanitization and trivialization: Neither of these are listed as core dimensions.
-   E. Disneyfication and Disneyization: These are terms for the overall concept, not its characteristics.
-   F. McDonaldization and Disneyization: These are two distinct sociological theories.
-   G. theming and performative labor: Both are correct dimensions identified by Bryman.

We are left with two valid options: A and G. Both present a correct pair of characteristics. However, "theming" is often presented as the most fundamental dimension that sets the stage for the others. "Performative labor" is also a crucial component of how the themed experience is delivered to the consumer. This pairing (theming and performative labor) encapsulates the creation of the environment and the human interaction within it, which are central to the concept of Disneyization. Therefore, it is arguably the best representation among the choices.
