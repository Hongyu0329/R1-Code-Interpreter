# Step 1: Determine n_2.
# Based on the problem's definition, a 2-planar graph must be bipartite.
# A bipartite graph cannot contain any odd-length cycles, like a C5.
# The condition "G contains exactly n induced cycles of length 5"
# can only be satisfied if n = 0.
# A graph with n=0 vertices vacuously satisfies all other conditions.
n_2 = 0

# Step 2: Determine n_3.
# A 3-planar graph is 3-partite and can have C5 cycles.
# Finding the true minimum n_3 is a complex graph theory problem.
# Let's use n_3 = 20 as a reasonable placeholder, noting that its
# actual value doesn't affect the final result. This value is chosen
# as it's the number of vertices in the dodecahedron, a graph
# fundamentally related to 5-cycles.
n_3 = 20

# Step 3: Calculate the final result.
# The formula is (n_2 + n_3) * n_2.
result = (n_2 + n_3) * n_2

print(f"Based on the logical constraints, n_2 must be 0.")
print(f"Using a placeholder for n_3, let n_3 = {n_3}.")
print(f"The equation is ({n_2} + {n_3}) * {n_2}")
print(f"The final result is {result}.")
