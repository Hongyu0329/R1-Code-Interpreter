    print("Let D be the set of dispersion points. Assume |D| >= 2.")
    print("Let x1 and x2 be two distinct points in D.\n")

    print("Theorem: If a connected space X has a point 'p' such that X \\ {p} is disconnected, then X is locally connected at 'p'.")
    print(f"Since x1 is a dispersion point, X \\ {{x1}} is totally disconnected, and thus disconnected.")
    print("By the theorem, we can conclude that X is locally connected at x1.\n")

    print("Step 3: Apply the definition of local connectivity at x1.")
    print("Local connectivity at x1 means that for any open neighborhood 'U' of x1, there is a connected open neighborhood 'V' of x1 such that V is a subset of U.")
    print("Since X is a metric space and x1 != x2, the set U = X \\ {x2} is an open set that contains x1.")
    print("Therefore, there must exist a connected open set V such that: x1 ∈ V and V ⊆ X \\ {x2}.\n")

    print("Step 4: Use the property of the second dispersion point, x2.")
    print("Since x2 is a dispersion point, the space X \\ {x2} is totally disconnected.")
    print("A space is totally disconnected if its only non-empty connected subsets are single points.\n")

    print("Step 5: Combine the previous steps to find a contradiction.")
    print("We have a set V that is a connected subset of the totally disconnected space X \\ {x2}.")
    print("Because V contains x1, it is non-empty.")
    print("This means V must be a singleton set: V = {x1}.")
    print("From Step 3, we also know that V is an open set. Therefore, {x1} is an open set.\n")

    print("Step 6: Show that this contradicts the connectivity of X.")
    print("If {x1} is an open set, then X can be partitioned into two disjoint open sets: A = {x1} and B = X \\ {x1}.")
    print("However, X is defined as a connected space. For a connected space to be the union of two disjoint open sets, one of them must be empty.")
    print("Since A = {x1} is not empty, B = X \\ {x1} must be empty.")
    print("This implies that X = {x1}, which contradicts our initial assumption that X contained at least two distinct points, x1 and x2.\n")

    print("Step 7: Conclude the proof and state the maximum value.")
    print("The assumption |D| >= 2 leads to a contradiction, so |D| must be less than 2.")
    print("The cardinality of D can thus be 0 or 1.")
    print("Examples exist for both cases (e.g., [0,1] has 0 dispersion points, and the Knaster-Kuratowski fan has 1).")
