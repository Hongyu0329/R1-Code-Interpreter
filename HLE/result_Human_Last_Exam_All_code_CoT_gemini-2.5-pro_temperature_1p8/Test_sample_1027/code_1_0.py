# The problem is to compute the dimension of the homology of a group G
# with trivial real coefficients in a specific degree.
# dim H_k(G, R) for k=31.

# The group G is generated by two homeomorphisms g and h. By analyzing their
# structure, one can identify G as being isomorphic to the famous Thompson's group F.
# The following computation relies on known properties of Thompson's group F.

# The degree of homology requested.
degree = 31

# The rational cohomological dimension of Thompson's group F is a known invariant.
rational_cohomological_dimension = 2

# A fundamental theorem states that for a group like F, the homology with rational
# (and thus real) coefficients is zero for any degree k that is greater than its
# rational cohomological dimension.
# We check if degree > rational_cohomological_dimension.
# The numbers involved in this "equation" are the degree and the dimension.

if degree > rational_cohomological_dimension:
    homology_dimension = 0
    reasoning = f"Since the degree k = {degree} is greater than the rational cohomological dimension n = {rational_cohomological_dimension}, the homology group is trivial."
else:
    # This case does not apply here. For k <= 2, the dimensions are known to be non-zero.
    homology_dimension = "Non-zero (not computed)"
    reasoning = f"Since the degree k = {degree} is not greater than the rational cohomological dimension n = {rational_cohomological_dimension}, the homology group is generally non-trivial."
