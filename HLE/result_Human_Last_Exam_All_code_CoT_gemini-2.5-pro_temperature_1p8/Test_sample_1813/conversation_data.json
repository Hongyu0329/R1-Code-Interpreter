    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand what the generalized Markov number $m_{p/q}$ is. Based on modern literature in combinatorics and number theory (e.g., Lee, Li, Rabideau, Schiffler, 2020), the generalized Markov number $m_{p/q}$ associated with a rational number $p/q$ is an integer calculated from the coefficients of the continued fraction of $p/q$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Find the continued fraction of the number 4/7.** For a rational number $p/q$ where $0 < p/q < 1$, its simple continued fraction is of the form $[0; a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]$. We need to find the integer coefficients $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$.\n2.  **Define and compute the generalized Markov number, $m_{4/7}$.** The number $m_{p/q}$ is defined using a recurrence relation based on the coefficients $[a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]$. Let's denote $M_k = m([a_1, \\ldots, a_k])$ as the Markov number for the prefix of length $k$. The recurrence is:\n    *   $M_0 = m(\\emptyset) = 1$ (by convention, for the empty continued fraction)\n    *   $M_1 = m([a_1]) = a_1$\n    *   $M_k = a_k \\cdot M_{k-1} - M_{k-2}$ for $k \\ge 2$.\n    The generalized Markov number for $p/q = [0; a_1, \\ldots, a_n]$ is $m_{p/q} = M_n$.\n3.  **Construct the final equation.** The problem asks to output the numbers in the \"final equation\". We will interpret this as the last step of the recurrence calculation, which yields the value of $m_{4/7}$.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan with Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_continued_fraction_coefficients(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the coefficients of the simple continued fraction for p/q.\n    For a rational in (0,1), this is [a1, a2, ...].\n    \"\"\"\n    # We expect a rational number p/q in (0, 1), so the first term is 0.\n    # We are interested in the coefficients a_1, a_2, ...\n    if q == 0:\n        return []\n    if p > q or p < 0:\n        # This implementation is simplified for 0 < p/q < 1\n        # The integer part is handled by the caller if necessary.\n        pass\n\n    coeffs = []\n    temp_p, temp_q = p, q\n    while temp_q != 0:\n        a = temp_p // temp_q\n        coeffs.append(a)\n        temp_p, temp_q = temp_q, temp_p % temp_q\n        \n    # For p/q in (0,1), the first coefficient is 0.
