    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute the plan.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Count the Total Edge Squares:** First, I'll calculate the total number of squares on the perimeter of a standard 8x8 chessboard.\n2.  **Separate by Color:** Bishops on light squares can never attack bishops on dark squares. This means we can solve the problem for each color independently and then combine the results. The number of edge squares is evenly split between light and dark colors.\n3.  **Find Maximum Bishops per Color:** I will determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge squares of a single color. A proven strategy to maximize non-attacking bishops is to place them on the outermost files (the 'a' and 'h' columns). I'll count the squares of one color on these files, note that the two corner squares on the long diagonal (e.g., a1 and h8 for dark squares) attack each other, and conclude we must place one fewer than the total count.\n4.  **Calculate Total Bishops:** The total number of bishops is the sum of the maximums for both light and dark squares.\n5.  **Find the Difference:** Finally, I'll subtract the total number of bishops placed from the total number of edge squares to find out how many are empty.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares after placing the maximum\n    number of non-attacking bishops on them.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    # An n x n board has 4 sides of length n, but the 4 corners are counted twice.\n    # So, the number of edge squares is (n * 4) - 4.\n    total_edge_squares = (board_size * 4) - 4\n    \n    # Step 2 & 3: Determine the maximum number of bishops for each color.\n    # Bishops on light squares don't attack bishops on dark squares.\n    # The problem is symmetric for both colors.\n    \n    # Let's analyze one color, e.g., dark squares.\n    # To place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, we can fill the\n    # squares on the outermost files, 'a' and 'h'.\n    # Dark edge squares on file 'a': a1, a3, a5, a7 (4 squares)\n    # Dark edge squares on file 'h': h2, h4, h6, h8 (4 squares)\n    # Total potential spots = 4 + 4 = 8\n    \n    # However, bishops on a1 and h8 attack each other along the main diagonal.\n    # We can only place one bishop on this diagonal. So, we must remove one.\n    # Maximum bishops for one color = 8 - 1 = 7.\n    max_bishops_per_color = (board_size // 2) + (board_size // 2) - 1\n    \n    # The number is the same for light squares due to symmetry.\n    # (a8 and h1 attack each other for the light squares).\n    max_light_bishops = max_bishops_per_color\n    max_dark_bishops = max_bishops_per_color\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate the total number of bishops that can be placed.\n    total_bishops = max_light_bishops + max_dark_bishops\n    \n    # Step 5: Calculate how many edge squares are left empty.\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - total_bishops\n\n    # Final Output\n    print(\"Chessboard Bishops on the Edge Puzzle:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(f\"1. Total edge squares on an {board_size}x{board_size} board: {total_edge_squares}\")\n    print(f\"2. Max non-attacking bishops on light edge squares: {max_light_bishops}\")\n    print(f\"3.
