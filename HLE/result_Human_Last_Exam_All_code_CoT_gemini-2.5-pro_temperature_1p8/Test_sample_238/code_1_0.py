    # Step 2: Analyze the interaction using a practical example.
    print("Step 2: Analyzing the interaction.")
    print("  Let's consider the sentence: 'I will make a house.'")
    print("  - The verb is 'make' (a verb of creation).")
    print("  - The object is 'a house' (an effected object).")
    print("\n  Now, let's see how the nominal markers would apply to 'house' ('óga' in Guarani):")
    print("  - Applying '-kue' (past): 'ógakue' (former house). It is logically impossible to create something that is *already* in a past/former state. This does not make sense.")
    print("  - Applying '-rã' (future/destinative): 'ógarã' (house-to-be). This makes perfect sense. The object of creation is something destined to exist. You are making a 'thing-that-will-be-a-house'.")
