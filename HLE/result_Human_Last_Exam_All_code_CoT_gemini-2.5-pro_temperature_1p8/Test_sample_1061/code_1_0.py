    # Analysis of Choice A
    print("Choice A: " + choices['A'])
    print("  - Rationale: While there can be a 'juvenile effect' on isotope ratios as a tree matures, it is generally not considered the predominant factor driving a consistent, century-long trend. The primary driver is typically the environmental conditions or the isotopic composition of the atmosphere.")
    print("  - Verdict: Unlikely to be the predominant factor.\n")
    
    # Analysis of Choice B
    print("Choice B: " + choices['B'])
    print("  - Rationale: Periods of drought cause water stress. To conserve water, trees close their stomata (leaf pores). This reduces the available CO2 inside the leaf, causing the photosynthetic enzyme RuBisCO to be less selective. As a result, it fixes more of the heavier 13C isotope, leading to an INCREASE in the 13C ratio.")
    print("  - Verdict: This is the opposite of the observed declining trend. Incorrect.\n")

    # Analysis of Choice C
    print("Choice C: " + choices['C'])
    print("  - Rationale: The use of stored reserves is an internal physiological process. The ultimate source of the carbon is still the atmosphere from previous years. This process does not explain a continuous, long-term decline that tracks a major external environmental change.")
    print("  - Verdict: Unlikely to be the predominant factor.\n")

    # Analysis of Choice D
    print("Choice D: " + choices['D'])
    print("  - Rationale: The proportion of earlywood (formed in spring, often with a lower 13C ratio) to latewood is influenced by seasonal climate. While a change in this proportion would affect the overall 13C ratio of the ring, it is a consequence of the climate, not the primary driving factor itself.")
    print("  - Verdict: Unlikely to be the predominant factor compared to the major climatic driver.\n")

    # Analysis of Choice E
    print("Choice E: " + choices['E'])
    print("  - Rationale: The SE Asia monsoon is the dominant climatic feature in the region. An intensification of the monsoon over time would lead to increased precipitation and higher humidity. This reduces water stress on the trees. With ample water, stomata remain open, allowing for maximum discrimination against the heavier 13C isotope. This leads to a DECREASE in the 13C ratio in the tree's wood.")
    print("  - Verdict: This mechanism correctly explains a declining 13C trend and is a major climatic driver. This is the most plausible option provided.\n")
    
    # Note on a global factor not listed as an option
    print("------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Important Note: The global 'Suess Effect'—the decrease in atmospheric 13C due to the burning of fossil fuels (which are depleted in 13C)—also causes a global decline in the 13C of tree rings over this exact period. However, as it is not an option, we must choose the best regional factor. Changes in the monsoon are a well-established and powerful regional driver of 13C variations.")

    print("Final Conclusion: Among the given choices, changes in the SE Asia monsoon provide the best explanation for a declining 13C ratio.")
