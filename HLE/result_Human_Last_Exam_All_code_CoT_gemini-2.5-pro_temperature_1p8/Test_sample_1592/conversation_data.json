    "My plan is to identify the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, which is located in Quebec. I will exclude Quebec from the search.\n\n1.  **Identify Candidates**: Based on the map of Canada, the main candidates neighboring the region of Waskaganish are the province of **Ontario** to the west and the territory of **Nunavut** to the north (specifically, the islands in James Bay).\n2.  **Gather Coordinates**: I will find the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) for:\n    *   Waskaganish, QC.\n    *   A point on the Ontario border directly west of Waskaganish. The border here is a straight line of longitude.\n    *   A point on the nearest Nunavut landmass, which is Akimiski Island in James Bay.\n3.  **Calculate Distances**: Using Python with the `geopy` library, I will calculate the great-circle distance from Waskaganish to the border points for both Ontario and Nunavut.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude**: I will compare the calculated distances to determine which province or territory is closer and print the result.\n\n```python\n# First, you may need to install the geopy library:\n# pip install geopy\n\nfrom geopy.distance import great_circle\n\n# Coordinates for the Waskaganish gathering place in Quebec\nwaskaganish_coords = (51.1939, -78.7622)\n\n# 1. ONTARIO\n# The Quebec-Ontario border south of James Bay is along the meridian 79° 31' 0\" W.\n# 31 minutes = 31/60 = 0.5167 degrees. So the longitude is -79.5167.\n# We'll find the distance to a point on that border at the same latitude as Waskaganish.\nontario_border_coords = (waskaganish_coords[0], -79.5167)\ndist_to_ontario = great_circle(waskaganish_coords, ontario_border_coords).km\n\n# 2. NUNAVUT\n# The closest major landmass in Nunavut is Akimiski Island in James Bay.\n# We'll use the coordinates of a point on the southeastern coast of the island.\nnunavut_akimiksi_island_coords = (52.25, -79.5)\ndist_to_nunavut = great_circle(waskaganish_coords, nunavut_akimiksi_island_coords).km\n\n# Compare the distances and print the result\nprint(f\"The Waskaganish gathering place is located at {waskaganish_coords[0]:.2f}° N, {abs(waskaganish_coords[1]):.2f}° W.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Distance to the Ontario border: {dist_to_ontario:.2f} km\")\nprint(f\"Distance to the Nunavut border (Akimiski Island): {dist_to_nunavut:.2f} km\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\nif dist_to_ontario < dist_to_nunavut:\n    closest = \"Ontario\"\n    closest_dist = dist_to_ontario\nelse:\n    closest = \"Nunavut\"\n    closest_dist = dist_to_nunavut\n\nprint(f\"The closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is {closest}.\")\n<<<Ontario>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
