    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:** The core task is to find the maximum number of different clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs within a single graph `G` that has exactly `n = 128` vertices.\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Graph on `n=128` vertices:** A graph `G` with a set of 128 vertices and some set of edges between them.\n    *   **Clique `K_k`:** A set of `k` vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex in the set.\n    *   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S` from `G`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` contains the vertices `S` and *all* the edges from `G` that connect vertices within `S`.\n    *   **Problem:** We want to maximize `m`, where `m` is the number of different values `k` for which `K_k` is an induced subgraph of `G`.\n\n3.  **Establish an Upper Bound:**\n    *   Let `G` be any graph on `n` vertices.\n    *   An induced clique `K_k` must be formed from a subset of `k` vertices of `G`.\n    *   Therefore, the size `k` of the clique cannot be larger than the total number of vertices `n`.\n    *   So, `k` must be an integer in the range `1 <= k <= n`.\n    *   This means there are at most `n` possible different clique sizes (`1, 2, ..., n`).\n    *   For our specific case, with `n = 128`, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is at most 128.\n\n4.  **Find a Construction to Achieve the Upper Bound:**\n    *   Now, we need to check if there is a graph `G` on 128 vertices that actually contains induced cliques of all 128 possible sizes.\n    *   Consider the **complete graph** `K_n` (or `K_{128}` in our case). In a complete graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n    *   Let's check for induced cliques in `K_{128}`.\n    *   Take any integer `k` where `1 <= k <= 128`.\n    *   Select any subset of `k` vertices from `K_{128}`.\n    *   By the definition of a complete graph, every vertex in this subset is connected to every other vertex in the subset.\n    *   Therefore, the subgraph induced by this subset of `k` vertices is a complete graph of size `k`, which is `K_k`.\n    *   This holds true for *any* `k` from 1 to 128. For example, any single vertex is a `K_1`, any pair of vertices is a `K_2`, and the entire graph is a `K_{128}`.\n    *   This means the single graph `K_{128}` simultaneously contains induced subgraphs of all clique sizes from 1 to 128.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   We established that the maximum number of different clique sizes is at most 128.\n    *   We found a specific graph, `K_{128}`, which achieves exactly 128 different clique sizes.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Code:** The request asks for a Python script. While the solution is based on a logical argument rather than a complex computation, I will write a script that sets the value of `n` and prints the conclusion based on this reasoning, fulfilling the request to use code to solve the task.\n\n```python\ndef solve_max_clique_sizes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n    in a graph on n vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph.\n    n = 128\n\n    # The maximum possible number of different clique sizes is determined by logic.\n    # 1. The size 'k' of any clique in a graph on 'n' vertices cannot exceed 'n'.\n    #    Therefore, the number of different clique sizes is at most 'n'.\n    # 2. The complete graph K_n is a graph on 'n' vertices.\n    # 3. In K_n, any subset of 'k' vertices (for 1 <= k <= n) induces a clique of size 'k'.\n    # 4. This means K_n contains induced cliques for all sizes from 1 to n.\n    # 5. Since the maximum is at most 'n' and we found a graph that achieves 'n', the maximum is 'n'.\n\n    max_sizes = n\n\n    # The final equation is simply that the maximum number equals n.\n    print(f\"The number of vertices is n = {n}.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum possible number of different clique sizes in a graph on {n} vertices is {max_sizes}.\")\n    print(f\"This is achieved using a complete graph K_{n}, which contains induced cliques of sizes 1, 2, ..., {n}.\")\n\nsolve_max_clique_sizes()\n```\n<<<128>>>"
