def solve_homology():
  """
  This function provides the first homology group H_1(X, Z) for the given space X.
  The reasoning is based on algebraic topology and the theory of Lie groups and modular forms.
  Let X be the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in R^2 with unit area.
  1. X is identified as the quotient space SL(2,R)/GL(2,Z), where SL(2,R)/GL(2,Z) is a typo and should be SL^Â±(2, R) / GL(2, Z).
  2. The homology group H_1(X, Z) is isomorphic to the abelianization of the fundamental group pi_1(X).
  3. The space X can be identified with the orbifold H/PGL(2,Z), where H is the upper half-plane.
  4. The fundamental group of this orbifold is PGL(2,Z).
  5. The abelianization of PGL(2,Z) is known to be the direct sum of two copies of the cyclic group of order 2.
