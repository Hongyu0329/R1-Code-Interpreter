    "To compute the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify the space X**: A lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ can be represented by a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, which form the columns of an invertible matrix $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. Two matrices, $A$ and $B$, represent the same lattice if $A = BM$ for some matrix $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is $|\\det(A)|$. We are given that this area is 1, so the space of such bases is $SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\{ A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid \\det(A) = \\pm 1 \\}$.\n    The moduli space $X$ is therefore the quotient space $X = SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n2.  **Relate X to the space of oriented lattices Y**: Let $Y$ be the space of *oriented* lattices of unit area. This corresponds to choosing bases with positive determinant, so $Y = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The space $X$ can be seen as the quotient of $Y$ by an involution $\\iota$ that reverses the orientation. This involution is well-defined and has no fixed points. Thus, $Y$ is a regular 2-sheeted covering space of $X$.\n\n3.  **Compute the homology of Y**: The space $Y$ is a well-studied object, often identified as the unit tangent bundle to the modular orbifold $\\mathbb{H}/PSL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$. Topologically, it is an $S^1$-bundle over a sphere with one puncture and two cone points (orders 2 and 3). Its first homology group is known to be infinite cyclic: $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n4.  **Determine the action of the involution on H1(Y)**: The involution $\\iota: Y \\to Y$ corresponds to reversing the orientation of the lattice. This action reverses the orientation of the circle fibers in the bundle structure of $Y$. Consequently, the induced map on the first homology, $\\iota_*: H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$, sends the generator to its inverse. If $h$ is a generator for $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, then $\\iota_*(h) = -h$.\n\n5.  **Use the long exact sequence for a covering space**: For the 2-sheeted covering $Y \\to X$, there is a short exact sequence in homology derived from the spectral sequence of the fibration $Y \\to X \\to B\\mathbb{Z}_2$:\n    $$0 \\to H_0(\\mathbb{Z}_2, H_1(Y)) \\to H_1(X) \\to H_1(\\mathbb{Z}_2, H_0(Y)) \\to 0$$\n    *   $H_0(Y) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ since $Y$ is connected. The action of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ on $H_0(Y)$ is trivial. So, $H_1(\\mathbb{Z}_2, H_0(Y)) = H_1(\\mathbb{Z}_2, \\mathbb{Z}) = H_1(\\mathbb{Z}_2, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   $H_1(Y) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ with the non-trivial action $h \\mapsto -h$ from the generator of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The group of coinvariants is $H_0(\\mathbb{Z}_2, H_1(Y)) = H_1(Y) / \\langle \\iota_*(h) - h \\rangle = \\mathbb{Z} / \\langle -h - h \\rangle = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n6.  **Determine the group structure of H1(X)**: Plugging these results into the exact sequence gives:\n    $$0 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to 0$$\n    This implies that $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a group of order 4. The two possibilities are $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$. The extension splits because the fundamental group extension $\\pi_1(X)$ is a semi-direct product $\\pi_1(Y) \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Abelianizing a semi-direct product results in a direct sum of the abelianized components (with appropriate quotients). Therefore, the group is the direct sum.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$. This result can be confirmed by an alternative identification of $X$ with the orbifold $\\mathbb{H}/PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The first homology of this orbifold is the abelianization of the orbifold fundamental group, $PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, which is known to be $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThe Python code below will print this final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homology():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the first homology group H_1(X, Z) for the given space X.\n  The reasoning is based on algebraic topology and the theory of Lie groups and modular forms.\n  Let X be the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in R^2 with unit area.\n  1.
