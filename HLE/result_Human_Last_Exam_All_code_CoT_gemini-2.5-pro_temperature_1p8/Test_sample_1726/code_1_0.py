    # Question 2: Relativity of Lengths

    print("This gives L = L0 / gamma_E. Since gamma_E < 1, this results in a length *expansion*.")

    # Question 3: Relativity of Time

    # Ah, a typo in my thought process write-up got copied here. Let's use the correct inverse transformations derived earlier:
    # Inverse t: t = gamma_E(t' - vx'/c^2)
    # Inverse x: x = gamma_E(x' + vt')
    # So u = x/t = [gamma_E(x' + vt')] / [gamma_E(t' - vx'/c^2)] = (x' + vt') / (t' - vx'/c^2)
    # Substitute x' = u'*t': u = (u'*t' + v*t') / (t' - v*(u'*t')/c^2) = t'*(u'+v) / (t'*(1-vu'/c^2))
    print("Correction to my scratchpad: The correct inverse transformation for time is t = gamma_E*(t' - vx'/c^2).")
