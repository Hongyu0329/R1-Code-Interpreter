    "To find the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can use the topological relations that govern these diagrams.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the relevant formulas.** The number of loops (L) in a connected diagram is related to the number of vertices (V) and internal lines (I) by the formula `L = I - V + 1`. For a scalar field theory with a `phi^4` interaction, the number of line ends at vertices (`4*V`) must equal the number of line ends from internal lines (`2*I`) and external lines (`E`), giving `4*V = 2*I + E`.\n2.  **Set the known parameters.** We are looking for a two-loop diagram, so `L = 2`.\n3.  **Solve the system of equations.** We will solve the two formulas for `V` in terms of `E`.\n4.  **Minimize the result.** To find the minimum number of vertices (V), we must find the minimum valid number of external lines (E). The smallest possible number of external lines is 0 (a vacuum diagram).\n5.  **Calculate the final answer.** We'll substitute the minimum `E` back into our equation for `V` to find the minimum number of vertices.\n6.  **Present the solution** in a Python script that prints the step-by-step derivation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    for a phi^4 interacting scalar field theory by printing the step-by-step\n    derivation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Parameters\n    L = 2  # Number of loops\n    phi_n = 4  # phi^4 theory, so each vertex has 4 lines\n\n    print(\"Step 1: State the topological formulas for Feynman diagrams.\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The number of loops (L) is given by: L = I - V + 1\")\n    print(f\"The vertex rule for a phi^{phi_n} theory is: {phi_n}*V = 2*I + E\")\n    print(\"Where: V = number of vertices, I = number of internal lines, E = number of external lines.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Substitute the known value for the number of loops (L).\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"We are given L = {L}.
