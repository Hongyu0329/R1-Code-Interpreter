# G.K. Chesterton's "The Queer Feet" from "The Innocence of Father Brown".
# In a conversation about the subordination of women in marriage, Father Brown says:
# "A man may make his name famous at GNEISTHORPE, or famous at CRAIGHUIE.
# But his wife has to be a painter's wife, a poet's wife, or a traveller's wife."

# The first place name begins with 'Gn'.
place_name_1 = "Gneisthorpe"

# The second place name begins with 'Cr'.
place_name_2 = "Craighuie"

# The final answer consists of these two names.
# The code below will print each name on a new line.
