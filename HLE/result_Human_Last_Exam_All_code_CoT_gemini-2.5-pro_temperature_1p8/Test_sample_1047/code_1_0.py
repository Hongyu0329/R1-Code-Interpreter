# The legal principle central to this scenario is the management of a conflict of interest involving a former client.
# A law firm (NC LLP) possesses confidential information about a former client (Advanced Tech Inc. or ATI) that is highly relevant to a new matter.
# In this new matter, the firm represents a new client (Six Wings Inc. or SWI) whose interests are directly adverse to the former client, as SWI is attempting to acquire ATI.
# This situation creates a clear conflict of interest.
#
# Let's analyze the options:
# A states the matters are unrelated. This is false because the confidential financial and contractual information held by the firm is directly related to an acquisition.
# B suggests that internal ethical screens are sufficient. This is generally false; screens alone, without the former client's consent, are typically not enough to cure a direct conflict of this nature.
# C focuses on the status of the lawyers as Partners. While their position might heighten the perception of a conflict, the core rule of imputed disqualification applies to the entire firm, regardless of title. It is not the strongest reason.
# E claims an absolute prohibition, which is incorrect. Many conflicts can be waived with consent.
#
# D correctly identifies the dispositive issue. A conflict exists that prejudices the former client, ATI. For the law firm to continue in the face of such a conflict, it must obtain the informed consent of the party that is prejudiced. The problem explicitly states that ATI will not consent. Therefore, NC LLP is prohibited from continuing the representation.

# Define the chosen answer based on the analysis.
final_answer = 'D'

# The final answer is D because the core issue is the lack of consent from the prejudiced former client to waive a clear conflict of interest.
# Norman and NC LLP are not allowed to continue to represent Six Wings Inc. because, when a conflict exists, the party prejudiced by the conflicted lawyer acting must consent to this lawyer acting for such lawyer to continue representing a party to the matter.
