    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequences:\n\n1.  **Assume Heptad Register:** Coiled coils are defined by a repeating seven-residue pattern, `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at the `a` and `d` positions form the hydrophobic core and are the primary determinants of the oligomeric state. Based on common design principles for synthetic peptides, we will assume the register is `g(abcdefg)n`, meaning the first residue of the sequence is in the `g` position, the second is in the `a` position, the fifth is in the `d` position, and so on.\n\n2.  **Extract Core Residues:** For each 28-amino-acid sequence (which constitutes four full heptads), we will identify the four residues at the `a` positions (indices 1, 8, 15, 22) and the four residues at the `d` positions (indices 4, 11, 18, 25).\n\n3.  **Apply Predictive Rules:** We will apply a set of established rules based on the identity of the amino acids in the `a` and `d` positions to predict the most likely oligomeric state (Dimer, Trimer, Tetramer, etc.). The key rules are:\n    *   **Dimer:** Favored by `I` at the `a` position and `L` at the `d` position.\n    *   **Trimer:** Favored by `L` or `I` at both `a` and `d` positions. A messy or moderately polar core can also favor trimers.\n    *   **Tetramer:** Often dictated by specific polar interactions within the core, such as having `I` at the `a` position and a polar (`Q`, `K`, `E`) residue at the `d` position.\n\n4.  **Synthesize Results:** We will apply these rules to each sequence one by one and combine the results into a final list. The python script below automates this process.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_states(sequences):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of coiled-coil sequences based on core residue analysis.\n\n    This prediction uses a fixed heptad register g(abcdefg) and a set of rules\n    based on the identity of residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions.\n    \"\"\"\n    predictions = []\n    \n    print(\"Analysis:\")\n    for seq in sequences:\n        # Step 1 & 2: Assume g(abcdefg) frame and extract a and d residues\n        a_residues = [seq[i] for i in [1, 8, 15, 22]]\n        d_residues = [seq[i] for i in [4, 11, 18, 25]]\n        \n        a_counts = collections.Counter(a_residues)\n        d_counts = collections.Counter(d_residues)\n        \n        prediction = 0\n        explanation = \"\"\n\n        # Step 3: Apply prediction rules in a specific order\n        # Rule 1: Polar 'K' in the 'd' position without a bulky 'W' suggests a tetramer.\n        if 'K' in d_counts and 'W' not in d_counts:\n            prediction = 4\n            explanation = f\"Detected 'K' at a 'd' position without 'W', predicting Tetramer ({prediction}).\"\n        # Rule 2: A core composed entirely of 'T' at the 'd' positions is unusual and can support a trimer.\n        elif d_counts.get('T') == 4:\n            prediction = 3\n            explanation = f\"Detected all 'd' positions are 'T', which can stabilize a Trimer ({prediction}).\"\n        # Rule 3: A bulky 'W' in the core can be accommodated, but often defaults to the simplest stable state, a dimer.\n        elif 'W' in d_counts:\n            prediction = 2\n            explanation = f\"Detected bulky 'W' at a 'd' position.
