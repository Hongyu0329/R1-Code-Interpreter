    "This problem asks for the number of distinct elements in the 3-dimensional homology cobordism group (Θ₃ᴴ) that can be created by performing integral surgery on knots with four or fewer crossings.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knots:** First, I will list all knots with a crossing number of 4 or less. These are the unknot (0₁), the trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁).\n2.  **Understand Homology Sphere Surgery:** An integral surgery on a knot K creates a homology 3-sphere (a manifold whose homology groups are the same as the 3-sphere, S³) if and only if the surgery coefficient is +1 or -1. So, for each knot, we only need to consider these two surgeries.\n3.  **Analyze Each Knot's Contribution:** I will analyze the results of +1 and -1 surgery for each knot:\n    *   **The Unknot (0₁):** Surgery on the unknot always produces the standard 3-sphere, S³, which is the identity element in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   **The Figure-Eight Knot (4₁):** This knot is known to be a *slice knot*. A key theorem in topology states that ±1 surgery on any slice knot produces a homology sphere that is homology cobordant to S³. This means they also represent the identity element.\n    *   **The Trefoil Knot (3₁):** This knot is *not* slice. The +1 and -1 surgeries on the trefoil knot produce two distinct, non-trivial homology spheres. These are the famous Poincaré homology sphere and its inverse (the same manifold with the opposite orientation). Since the trefoil is chiral (it is different from its mirror image), we must consider both the right-handed and left-handed versions, but both produce the same pair of elements in the group.\n4.  **Tally the Unique Elements:** I will collect all the elements generated from these surgeries and count the number of unique ones. This will be the identity element, the Poincaré sphere, and its inverse.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this logic by using a dictionary to store the properties of each knot and then processing them to find the set of unique group elements. It will then print a summary of the findings and the final count.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_homology_cobordism_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of homology cobordism group elements\n    representable by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the knots and their relevant properties.\n    # The 'generates' key holds the set of elements in the homology cobordism group (Theta_3^H)\n    # produced by +1 and -1 surgery on the knot.\n    # We use descriptive strings to represent these elements.\n    knot_data = {\n        'Unknot (0_1)': {\n            'crossings': 0,\n            'is_slice': True,\n            'generates': {'Identity Element (S^3)'}\n        },\n        'Trefoil (3_1)': {\n            'crossings': 3,\n            'is_slice': False,\n            # +1/-1 surgeries on the (non-slice) trefoil yield the Poincaré homology sphere and its inverse.\n            'generates': {'Poincaré Homology Sphere', 'Inverse Poincaré Homology Sphere'}\n        },\n        'Figure-eight (4_1)': {\n            'crossings': 4,\n            'is_slice': True,\n            # Being a slice knot means +/-1 surgery results are homology cobordant to S^3.\n            'generates': {'Identity Element (S^3)'}\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing integral surgeries on knots with at most 4 crossings...\")\n    print(\"A surgery on a knot K creates a homology sphere only with coefficients +1 or -1.\")\n    print(\"If a knot is 'slice', these surgeries result in the identity element in the homology cobordism group.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Tally the unique elements from all relevant knots.\n    unique_elements = set()\n    for name, properties in knot_data.items():\n        print(f\"Knot: {name}\")\n        if properties['is_slice']:\n            print(f\"  - Property: SLICE.
