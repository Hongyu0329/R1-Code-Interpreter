    "This is an interesting question that touches on a fundamental principle of crystal physics. For a material to exhibit optical activity (the rotation of the plane of polarized light), it must be **chiral**. Chirality means that the crystal's structure is not superimposable on its mirror image. The symmetry requirement for chirality is the absence of any roto-inversion symmetry elements, which include centers of inversion and mirror planes.\n\nA crystal class that is **achiral**, by definition, possesses at least one of these roto-inversion symmetries. Therefore, the conditions of being \"achiral\" and \"optically active\" are mutually exclusive. No crystal class can satisfy both conditions simultaneously.\n\nThe following Python script defines the sets of crystal classes for each property (achiral, non-polar, and optically active) and demonstrates that their intersection is empty, confirming that no such crystal classes exist.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystal_class_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active,\n    and explains the relationship between these properties.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The 32 crystallographic point groups (crystal classes)\n    all_32_classes = {\n        '1', '-1', '2', 'm', '2/m', '222', 'mm2', 'mmm', '4', '-4', '4/m',\n        '422', '4mm', '-42m', '4/mmm', '3', '-3', '32', '3m', '-3m', '6',\n        '-6', '6/m', '622', '6mm', '-62m', '6/mmm', '23', 'm-3', '432',\n        '-43m', 'm-3m'\n    }\n\n    # CRITERION 1: Optically Active\n    # Optical activity is only possible in chiral crystal classes, which lack any\n    # roto-inversion axis (including mirror planes 'm' and inversion centers '-1').\n    optically_active_classes = {\n        '1', '2', '222', '3', '32', '4', '422', '6', '622', '23', '432'\n    }\n\n    # CRITERION 2: Achiral\n    # Achiral classes are the opposite of chiral classes.
