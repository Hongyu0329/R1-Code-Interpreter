    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $g=6$, we can follow these steps:\n\n### **Plan**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Conductor and Order:** First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d=53599$ and the order $g=6$.\n2.  **Structure of Primitive Characters:** A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character of conductor $p_i$. A character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if it is not the principal character (the character which is always 1).\n3.  **Order of the Character:** The order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{order}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{order}(\\chi_1), \\text{order}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{order}(\\chi_k))$. We need this lcm to be $g=6$.\n4.  **Counting Component Characters:** For a prime conductor $p$, the group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of primitive characters of conductor $p$ and order $m$ (where $m>1$ and $m | (p-1)$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(m)$.\n5.  **Counting with Inclusion-Exclusion:** We need to count the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_k)$ such that $\\text{lcm}(\\text{order}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{order}(\\chi_k))=6$. Let $n_p(m)$ be the number of primitive characters of conductor $p$ whose order divides $m$. The total number of tuples where the lcm of orders divides $m$ is $\\prod_{i=1}^k n_{p_i}(m)$. Using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion for the divisors of 6 (which are 1, 2, 3, 6), the number of characters of order exactly 6 is:\n    $N = (\\text{count for } 6) - (\\text{count for } 3) - (\\text{count for } 2) + (\\text{count for } 1)$.\n    Each \"count for $m$\" is the product over the prime factors of $d$ of the number of primitive characters whose order divides $m$.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns the prime factorization of n as a dictionary.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    while d * d <= n:\n        while n % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            n //= d\n        d += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        factors[n] = factors.get(n, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function phi(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return int(result)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    g = 6\n\n    d_factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    primes_of_d = list(d_factors.keys())\n    \n    # A character is primitive for a square-free conductor d if it's a product of \n    # primitive characters for each prime factor of d.\n    # The conductor d must be square-free.\n    for p, a in d_factors.items():\n        if a > 1:\n            print(f\"Conductor d={d} is not square-free.
