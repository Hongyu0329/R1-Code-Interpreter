# Step 1: Define the problem parameters
# The problem reduces to calculating phi(a) for a=7.
# Based on the derivation, the determinant of the matrix N, X = det(N),
# is a random variable. The function phi(a) depends on the distribution of X.
# A common feature of such problems is that the determinant simplifies to a constant.
# The expectation of the determinant is E[X] = 0.
# If X is a constant, it must be 0.
# Let's assume X = 0 almost surely.

# Step 2: Define the formula for phi(a) when X=0
# If X=0, the characteristic function Phi_X(t) = E[exp(itX)] = 1.
# The formula for phi(a) is:
# phi(a) = integral from 0 to infinity of (2i - Phi(i - t*exp(-ita)) - conj(Phi)(i + t*exp(ita))) / (i*t^2) dt
# Substituting Phi = 1 and conj(Phi) = 1:
# Numerator = 2i - (i - t*exp(-ita)) - (i + t*exp(ita))
#           = 2i - i + t*exp(-ita) - i - t*exp(ita)
#           = t*(exp(-ita) - exp(ita))
#           = t*(-2i*sin(at))
# Denominator = i*t^2
# Integrand = t*(-2i*sin(at)) / (i*t^2) = -2*sin(at)/t
# So, phi(a) = integral from 0 to infinity of -2*sin(at)/t dt

# Step 3: Evaluate the integral
# The integral of sin(k*t)/t from 0 to infinity is pi/2 for k > 0.
# For a=7, k=7 > 0.
# The integral is -2 * (pi/2) = -pi.

a = 7
# The calculation shows phi(a) = -2 * integral_0^inf (sin(a*t)/t) dt
# For a > 0, this integral is pi/2.
# So phi(a) = -2 * (pi/2) = -pi
result = -np.pi

# Output the final equation
# phi(7) = Integral( -2*sin(7*t)/t dt ) from 0 to inf = -2 * (pi/2) = -pi
