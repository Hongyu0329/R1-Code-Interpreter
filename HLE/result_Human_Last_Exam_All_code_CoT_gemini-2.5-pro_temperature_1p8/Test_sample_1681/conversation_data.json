    "An optimal equilibrium in the quantum version of the Prisoner's Dilemma can be achieved by carefully selecting the initial entangled state. The goal is to design a game where the most desirable outcome for both players, mutual cooperation, becomes a stable Nash Equilibrium. This resolves the classical dilemma where both players are driven to defect, resulting in a suboptimal outcome.\n\nHere is the plan to find this optimal equilibrium point:\n1.  **Define the Game Parameters:** We will extract the payoff values (Reward, Sucker, Temptation, Punishment) from the provided matrix.\n2.  **Apply Quantum Game Theory:** We will use the established Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) framework for quantum games. In this model, the initial state of the game is a two-qubit state entangled with a degree controlled by a parameter, `gamma` (γ).\n3.  **Identify the Optimal Condition:** We will determine the condition on the entanglement `gamma` that makes the \"Cooperate, Cooperate\" (C,C) outcome a Nash Equilibrium. This outcome is Pareto-optimal as it yields the highest possible total payoff for the players.\n4.  **Design the Initial State:** As we are tasked with designing the state for an optimal result, we will select a value for `gamma` that satisfies the derived condition.\n5.  **Determine the Equilibrium Payoff:** With the (C,C) strategy being a stable equilibrium, the resulting payoff will be the reward for mutual cooperation.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate and display the optimal equilibrium point.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the optimal equilibrium point for the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.\n    \n    This function uses the established result from the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL)\n    quantum game theory framework.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the payoffs from the provided matrix.\n    # The matrix is [[(R,R), (S,T)], [(T,S), (P,P)]]\n    # R: Reward for mutual cooperation\n    # S: Sucker's payoff if you cooperate and the other defects\n    # T: Temptation to defect if the other cooperates\n    # P: Punishment for mutual defection\n    R = 5\n    S = 0\n    T = 7\n    P = 1\n\n    # Step 2: State the theoretical condition for the optimal equilibrium.\n    # In the quantum game, (Cooperate, Cooperate) becomes a Nash Equilibrium if the\n    # entanglement parameter γ satisfies the following condition:\n    # tan(γ/2)^2 < (R - S) / (T - P)\n    # This creates a game with two Nash Equilibria: (C,C) and (D,D).\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the critical value for the condition.\n    threshold_numerator = R - S\n    threshold_denominator = T - P\n    \n    # The condition is only meaningful if the denominator is not zero.\n    if threshold_denominator == 0:\n        print(\"The analysis cannot proceed as the Temptation and Punishment payoffs are equal.\")\n        return\n        \n    k_critical = threshold_numerator / threshold_denominator\n\n    # Step 4: Explain the strategy based on the problem statement.\n    # We are asked to \"design the initial states for an optimal\" outcome.\n    # Choosing any level of entanglement 0 < γ < 2 * arctan(sqrt(k_critical))\n    # ensures that (Cooperate, Cooperate) is a stable strategy.\n    # Since the payoff for (C,C) is (R,R) = (5,5) and the payoff for (D,D) is\n    # (P,P) = (1,1), rational players will coordinate on the superior (C,C) equilibrium.\n    \n    # Step 5: The resulting equilibrium point is the payoff for mutual cooperation.\n    payoff_A = R\n    payoff_B = R\n\n    # Step 6: Print the detailed result and the final equation.\n    print(\"In the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma, an optimal initial state can be designed.\")\n    print(\"The goal is to make the Pareto-optimal (Cooperate, Cooperate) outcome a Nash Equilibrium.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis is achieved if the entanglement parameter γ satisfies the condition:\")\n    print(f\"tan(γ/2)^2 < ({R} - {S}) / ({T} - {P})\")\n    print(f\"tan(γ/2)^2 < {threshold_numerator} / {threshold_denominator}\")\n    print(f\"tan(γ/2)^2 < {k_critical:.4f}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nBy setting the initial entanglement within this range, rational players will choose to cooperate.\")\n    print(\"The equilibrium point is therefore the payoff vector for mutual cooperation.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equilibrium Payoff Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Player A's Payoff = {payoff_A}\")\n    print(f\"Player B's Payoff = {payoff_B}\")\n\nsolve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma()\n```\n<<<(5, 5)>>>"
