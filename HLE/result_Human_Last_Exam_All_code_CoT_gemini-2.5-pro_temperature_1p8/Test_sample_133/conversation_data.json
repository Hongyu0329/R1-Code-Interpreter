    "This is a Connect 4 problem. The goal is to find the optimal move for player 'O' to win as quickly as possible.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Board**: First, I will represent the current game board in a 6x7 grid structure.\n2.  **Check for Immediate Wins**: I will scan all possible moves for 'O'. A move is considered optimal if it immediately results in a line of four 'O's.\n3.  **Check for Forced Wins**: If no immediate win is available, the \"fastest possible\" win is a forced win. This usually involves making a move that creates two separate winning threats (e.g., two different lines of three that can be completed). The opponent can only block one of these threats, allowing the player to win on their next turn.\n4.  **Identify the Optimal Move(s)**: I will systematically check each legal move for 'O' to see if it creates such an unblockable, game-winning situation.\n5.  **Code the Solution**: I will write a Python script that implements this logic to analyze the board and print the optimal move(s) in the required `c1, b4, ...` format.\n\nAfter analyzing the board, there are no moves that allow 'O' to win immediately. The next best strategy is to force a win. My analysis reveals that by playing in column 'f', 'O' can create a line of three pieces (`d4, e4, f4`). This single move creates a situation where 'O' can win on the next turn by playing in either column 'c' or column 'g'. Since the opponent 'X' can only block one of these columns in their turn, 'O' is guaranteed a victory.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs the analysis and identifies this optimal move.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define constants\nROW_COUNT = 6\nCOLUMN_COUNT = 7\nPLAYER_O = 'O'\nPLAYER_X = 'X'\nEMPTY = '.'\nWINDOW_LENGTH = 4\n\ndef create_board():\n    \"\"\"Creates the initial board state as specified in the problem.\"\"\"\n    board = np.full((ROW_COUNT, COLUMN_COUNT), EMPTY, dtype=str)\n    # Using the coordinate system where (0,0) is top-left\n    # From image: 4d=O, 4e=O\n    board[3][3] = PLAYER_O\n    board[3][4] = PLAYER_O\n    # 5a=O, 5c=X, 5d=O, 5e=X, 5f=X, 5g=X\n    board[4][0] = PLAYER_O\n    board[4][2] = PLAYER_X\n    board[4][3] = PLAYER_O\n    board[4][4] = PLAYER_X\n    board[4][5] = PLAYER_X\n    board[4][6] = PLAYER_X\n    # 6a=X, 6b=O, 6c=O, 6d=X, 6e=X, 6f=O, 6g=X\n    board[5][0] = PLAYER_X\n    board[5][1] = PLAYER_O\n    board[5][2] = PLAYER_O\n    board[5][3] = PLAYER_X\n    board[5][4] = PLAYER_X\n    board[5][5] = PLAYER_O\n    board[5][6] = PLAYER_X\n    return board\n\ndef is_valid_location(board, col):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a column is not full.\"\"\"\n    return board[0][col] == EMPTY\n\ndef get_next_open_row(board, col):\n    \"\"\"Returns the row index for the next piece in a column.\"\"\"\n    for r in range(ROW_COUNT - 1, -1, -1):\n        if board[r][col] == EMPTY:\n            return r\n    return None\n\ndef drop_piece(board, row, col, piece):\n    \"\"\"Places a piece on the board.\"\"\"\n    board[row][col] = piece\n\ndef check_win(board, piece):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a player has won.\"\"\"\n    # Check horizontal\n    for r in range(ROW_COUNT):\n        for c in range(COLUMN_COUNT - 3):\n            if all(board[r][c+i] == piece for i in range(WINDOW_LENGTH)):\n                return True\n    # Check vertical\n    for c in range(COLUMN_COUNT):\n        for r in range(ROW_COUNT - 3):\n            if all(board[r+i][c] == piece for i in range(WINDOW_LENGTH)):\n                return True\n    # Check positive diagonal\n    for c in range(COLUMN_COUNT - 3):\n        for r in range(ROW_COUNT - 3):\n            if all(board[r+i][c+i] == piece for i in range(WINDOW_LENGTH)):\n                return True\n    # Check negative diagonal\n    for c in range(COLUMN_COUNT - 3):\n        for r in range(3, ROW_COUNT):\n            if all(board[r-i][c+i] == piece for i in range(WINDOW_LENGTH)):\n                return True\n    return False\n\ndef get_move_name(col, row):\n    \"\"\"Converts (col, row) indices to human-readable format like 'a1'.\"\"\"\n    col_name = chr(ord('a') + col)\n    # The visual grid row is 1-indexed, our array is 0-indexed.\n    row_name = str(row + 1)\n    return f\"{col_name}{row_name}\"\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"Finds the optimal moves for player 'O'.\"\"\"\n    board = create_board()\n    player = PLAYER_O\n\n    # --- Step 1: Check for any immediate winning moves ---\n    immediate_wins = []\n    for col in range(COLUMN_COUNT):\n        if is_valid_location(board, col):\n            row = get_next_open_row(board, col)\n            board_copy = board.copy()\n            drop_piece(board_copy, row, col, player)\n            if check_win(board_copy, player):\n                immediate_wins.append(get_move_name(col, row))\n    \n    if immediate_wins:\n        print(\", \".join(sorted(immediate_wins)))\n        return\n\n    # --- Step 2: Look for a forced win (creating multiple unblockable threats) ---\n    forced_wins = []\n    for col1 in range(COLUMN_COUNT):\n        if is_valid_location(board, col1):\n            row1 = get_next_open_row(board, col1)\n            board_after_o1 = board.copy()\n            drop_piece(board_after_o1, row1, col1, player)\n\n            # Find how many winning threats are created by this move.\n            # A threat is a spot where O can play next turn to win.\n            winning_threat_cols = set()\n            for col2 in range(COLUMN_COUNT):\n                if is_valid_location(board_after_o1, col2):\n                    row2 = get_next_open_row(board_after_o1, col2)\n                    board_after_o2 = board_after_o1.copy()\n                    \n                    drop_piece(board_after_o2, row2, col2, player)\n                    if check_win(board_after_o2, player):\n                        winning_threat_cols.add(col2)\n            \n            # If threats exist in at least two different columns, the opponent\n            # cannot block both.
