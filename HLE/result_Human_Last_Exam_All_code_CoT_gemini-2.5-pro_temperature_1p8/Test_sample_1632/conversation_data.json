    "To solve this problem, I will calculate the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D square (Manhattan) lattice, denoted by a(10). A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Understand the Walk:** The walk starts at the origin (0,0). At each step, the walk can move to one of the four neighboring points (up, down, left, or right), as long as that point has not been previously visited.\n2.  **Algorithm Selection:** For a length of 10, the total number of walks is small enough to be counted by a complete enumeration. I will use a recursive backtracking algorithm to explore all possible valid paths.\n3.  **Recursive Function:** I'll implement a function that recursively explores paths. This function will take the current position, the set of visited points, and the number of steps remaining as arguments.\n4.  **Base Case:** The recursion stops when there are no steps left. When this happens, we have found one complete self-avoiding walk, and the function returns 1.\n5.  **Recursive Step:** For a given position, the function will try moving in all four directions. If a move leads to a new, unvisited point, it will make a recursive call for the next step from that new point. The results of these recursive calls (the number of valid walks from each possible next step) will be summed up.\n6.  **Execution:** The process starts from position (0,0) with a visited set containing only the origin and a step count of 10. The final result will be printed to the console.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates a(n), the number of n-step self-avoiding walks\n# on a 2D square lattice, for n=10.\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of steps in the walk.\n    n = 10\n\n    def count_walks(current_pos, visited, steps_left):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts the number of self-avoiding walks.\n\n        Args:\n            current_pos (tuple): The (x, y) coordinates of the current position.\n            visited (set): A set of (x, y) tuples representing visited points.\n            steps_left (int): The number of steps remaining in the walk.\n\n        Returns:\n            int: The total number of valid self-avoiding walks from the current state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If there are no steps left, we have successfully found one valid walk.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        total_walks = 0\n        x, y = current_pos\n\n        # Define the four possible moves: North, East, South, West.\n        moves = [(x, y + 1), (x + 1, y), (x, y - 1), (x - 1, y)]\n\n        # Explore each possible move.\n        for next_pos in moves:\n            # Check if the next position has already been visited.\n            if next_pos not in visited:\n                # If not visited, add it to the path and recurse.\n                visited.add(next_pos)\n                total_walks += count_walks(next_pos, visited, steps_left - 1)\n                # Backtrack: remove the point to explore other paths from the current state.\n                visited.remove(next_pos)\n        \n        return total_walks\n\n    # The walk starts at the origin (0, 0).\n    start_pos = (0, 0)\n    # The initial set of visited points contains only the starting position.\n    visited_set = {start_pos}\n\n    # Start the calculation.\n    result = count_walks(start_pos, visited_set, n)\n    \n    # Output the result, showing each number in the final equation as requested.\n    number_of_steps = n\n    final_count = result\n    print(f\"a({number_of_steps}) = {final_count}\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<44100>>>"
