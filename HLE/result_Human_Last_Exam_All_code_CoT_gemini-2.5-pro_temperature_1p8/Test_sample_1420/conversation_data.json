    "To determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a system with spatial dimension d=3 using the epsilon expansion, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the framework**: The problem is set within the Renormalization Group (RG) theory, specifically using the epsilon (ε) expansion.\n2.  **Define the epsilon parameter**: The epsilon expansion is a perturbative method performed around the upper critical dimension, `d_c`. The expansion parameter is `ε = d_c - d`. For a wide class of models (including the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models), the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`.\n3.  **State the formula for α**: To the first order in ε, the specific heat exponent α is given by the formula:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ε`\n    where `n` is the number of components of the order parameter (e.g., n=1 for the Ising model, n=2 for the XY model).\n4.  **Assume a model**: Since the problem does not specify the model, I will assume the most common case studied, the **Ising model**, where `n=1`.\n5.  **Calculate the result**: I will substitute `d=3`, `d_c=4` (so `ε=1`), and `n=1` into the formula to calculate α. The Python script below will perform this calculation and print the steps.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha (α) using the epsilon expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Parameters ---\n    # Spatial dimension\n    d = 3\n    # Upper critical dimension (for the n-vector model)\n    d_c = 4\n    # Number of components of the order parameter.
