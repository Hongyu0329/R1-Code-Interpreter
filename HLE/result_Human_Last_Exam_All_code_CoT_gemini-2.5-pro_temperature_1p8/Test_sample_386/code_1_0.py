    print("2. Correct Cell Behavior: When stromal keratocytes are cultured in a medium containing Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), they transform into fibroblasts and then into myofibroblasts. This is a key process in wound healing, making it relevant for the study. The cells must adhere to the flask to grow, which option C correctly states.")
