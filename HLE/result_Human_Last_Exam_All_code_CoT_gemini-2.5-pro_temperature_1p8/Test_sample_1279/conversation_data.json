    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the relevant Feynman diagrams, calculate the symmetry factor for each, and then sum these factors.\n\n### Step 1: Identifying the Diagrams\n\nIn $\\phi^4$ theory, a vertex involves four fields ($\\phi^4$). A second-order diagram contains two such vertices. A vacuum bubble diagram has no external lines; all lines are internal propagators. We are interested in connected diagrams.\n\nBy analyzing the possible connections between two 4-point vertices, we can determine that there are only two topologically distinct connected vacuum bubble diagrams at the second order:\n\n1.  **The \"Doughnut\" Diagram:** The two vertices are connected to each other by all four propagators.\n2.  **The \"Double-Scoop\" Diagram:** The two vertices are connected by two propagators. Additionally, each vertex has a single propagator that starts and ends on itself, forming a loop.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Symmetry Factors\n\nThe symmetry factor, S, of a diagram is the order of its automorphism group, which is the number of permutations of its vertices and internal lines that leave the diagram unchanged.\n\n**Rules for calculating S:**\n*   A factor of `n!` for any set of `n` identical vertices that can be permuted without changing the diagram's topology.\n*   A factor of `m!` for any set of `m` identical lines connecting the same two vertices.\n*   A factor of 2 for each line that connects a vertex to itself (representing the symmetry of reversing the line's direction).\n\n**Diagram 1: The \"Doughnut\" Diagram**\n*   **Vertex Permutations:** The two vertices are identical and can be swapped. This gives a factor of `2! = 2`.\n*   **Line Permutations:** There are four identical propagators connecting the two vertices. These can be permuted in `4! = 24` ways.\n*   **Total Symmetry Factor (S₁):** $S_1 = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n**Diagram 2: The \"Double-Scoop\" Diagram**\n*   **Vertex Permutations:** The two vertices are identical and can be swapped. This gives a factor of `2! = 2`.\n*   **Connecting Line Permutations:** There are two identical propagators connecting the two vertices. These can be permuted in `2! = 2` ways.\n*   **Loop Line Reversals:** Each of the two vertices has one line that connects the vertex to itself (a loop). Each of these lines can be reversed, giving a factor of 2 for each. So, we get a total factor of `2 * 2 = 4`.\n*   **Total Symmetry Factor (S₂):** The total symmetry factor is the product of these individual factors: $S_2 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n### Step 3: Summing the Factors\n\nThe final step is to sum the symmetry factors of all the diagrams.\n\nTotal Sum = $S_1 + S_2 = 48 + 16 = 64$.\n\nThe following Python code performs these calculations and prints the results.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factors for the two second-order vacuum bubble\n    diagrams in phi^4 theory and prints their sum.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Calculating the symmetry factors for second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in phi^4 theory.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # --- Diagram 1: \"Doughnut\" Diagram ---\n    # Two vertices, connected by four propagators.\n    print(\"Diagram 1: 'Doughnut' Diagram\")\n    \n    # Factor for permuting the two identical vertices\n    d1_vertex_permutations = math.factorial(2)\n    \n    # Factor for permuting the four identical propagators between the vertices\n    d1_line_permutations = math.factorial(4)\n    \n    # Calculate the symmetry factor S1\n    S1 = d1_vertex_permutations * d1_line_permutations\n    \n    print(f\"Symmetry factor S1 = (vertex permutations) * (line permutations)\")\n    print(f\"S1 = {d1_vertex_permutations} * {d1_line_permutations} = {S1}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # --- Diagram 2: \"Double-Scoop\" Diagram ---\n    # Two vertices, two propagators connecting them, and one loop on each vertex.\n    print(\"Diagram 2: 'Double-Scoop' Diagram\")\n    \n    # Factor for permuting the two identical vertices\n    d2_vertex_permutations = math.factorial(2)\n    \n    # Factor for permuting the two identical propagators between the vertices\n    d2_connecting_line_permutations = math.factorial(2)\n    \n    # Factor for reversing the loop on the first vertex\n    d2_loop1_reversal = 2\n    \n    # Factor for reversing the loop on the second vertex\n    d2_loop2_reversal = 2\n\n    # Calculate the symmetry factor S2\n    S2 = d2_vertex_permutations * d2_connecting_line_permutations * d2_loop1_reversal * d2_loop2_reversal\n\n    print(f\"Symmetry factor S2 = (vertex perms) * (connecting line perms) * (loop 1 reversal) * (loop 2 reversal)\")\n    print(f\"S2 = {d2_vertex_permutations} * {d2_connecting_line_permutations} * {d2_loop1_reversal} * {d2_loop2_reversal} = {S2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # --- Total Sum ---\n    total_sum = S1 + S2\n    print(\"Sum of all symmetry factors:\")\n    # The user requested that the final equation shows each number.\n    print(f\"Total Sum = S1 + S2 = {S1} + {S2} = {total_sum}\")\n\ncalculate_symmetry_factors()\n<<<64>>>\n```"
