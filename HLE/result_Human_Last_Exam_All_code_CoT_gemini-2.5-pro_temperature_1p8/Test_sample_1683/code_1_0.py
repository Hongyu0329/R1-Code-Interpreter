# This script identifies the final product of the multi-step synthesis.

# Step 1: Formation of Compound 1, Tris(2-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl)methanol, (HOCH2-C6H4)3COH
# (2-bromphenyl)methanol + 2 nBuLi -> Li-C6H4-CH2O-Li
# 3 Li-C6H4-CH2O-Li + (EtO)2CO -> (after workup) -> (HOCH2-C6H4)3COH

# Step 2: Formation of Compound 2, a cyclic silyl ether.
# Two of the -CH2OH groups are bridged by a -Si(CH3)2- group.

# Step 3: Formation of Compound 3 via reductive cyclization.
# The silyl ether is cleaved with Li/naphthalene, and the resulting radicals couple to form a -CH2-CH2- bridge.

# Step 4: Formation of Compound 4 via Jones oxidation.
# The primary alcohol is oxidized to a carboxylic acid.
# The -CH2-CH2- bridge is oxidatively cleaved to form two carboxylic acid groups.
# The tertiary alcohol is unreactive.
# The final result is the conversion of all three -CH2OH groups of the initial tripod structure to -COOH groups.

# The molecule has a central carbon atom single-bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH) and three 2-carboxyphenyl groups.
# A 2-carboxyphenyl group is a benzene ring substituted with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at the position adjacent (ortho) to the bond to the central carbon.
