# The plan is to show that the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 0.
# This can be demonstrated by choosing a specific finite ultrametric space X and a Banach space B
# for which no isometric embedding exists.

# Let X be a two-point space {a, b} with distance d(a,b) = 1.
# Let B be the trivial Banach space {0}, where the norm of the single element is ||0|| = 0.
# An isometric embedding f: X -> B must satisfy ||f(a) - f(b)|| = d(a,b).
# Since the only mapping possible is f(a)=0 and f(b)=0, the condition becomes:
# ||0 - 0|| = 1
# This leads to the contradiction 0 = 1.
# Thus, no such embedding exists, and the number of embeddings is 0.

# As requested, I will provide the result as an equation.
# The following code prints a simple equation that results in our answer, 0.

num1 = 1
num2 = 1
result = 0

print(f"The calculation demonstrating the non-existence of an embedding leads to a contradiction.")
print(f"For our chosen X and B, the required distance is {num1}, but the achievable distance is {result}.")
print(f"Therefore, the number of possible embeddings is 0.")
print(f"A simple equation showing the final numerical answer is:")
print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {result}")
