# The problem asks for the value of n, where F is an n-resolvable functor.
# This means n is the projective dimension of F.
#
# Based on the analysis of the problem statement:
# 1. We interpret "$f$ discretizes ..." to mean that the source poset I is discrete.
# 2. The category of representations on a finite discrete poset, Fun(I, Vect_K), is semisimple.
# 3. In a semisimple category, every object is projective.
# 4. We interpret "$f$ discretizes F" to mean F is in the image of the left Kan extension Functor Lan_f.
#    So, F is isomorphic to Lan_f(G) for some G in Fun(I, Vect_K).
# 5. G is an object in a semisimple category, so G is projective.
# 6. The functor Lan_f (denoted f^k in the problem) is a left adjoint to an exact functor,
#    so it preserves projective objects.
# 7. Since G is projective, F = Lan_f(G) must also be projective.
# 8. The projective dimension of a projective object is 0.
#
# Therefore, F is 0-resolvable.

# The final equation is n = 0.
# We will now print this equation.
n = 0
