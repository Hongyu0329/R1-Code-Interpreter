    "To scan the Latin hexameter line, we need to identify the pattern of dactyls (one long syllable followed by two short, marked 'D') and spondees (two long syllables, marked 'S') across six feet. The scansion of this particular line from Lucretius involves several poetic conventions, including elision and synizesis, making it complex. Based on established classical scholarship, the scansion is determined as follows.\n\nThe plan is to:\n1.  Identify the line to be scanned: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n2.  Break the line into its six metrical feet.\n3.  Determine whether each foot is a dactyl (D) or a spondee (S) based on standard scansion rules, including poetic licenses common in Lucretius.\n4.  Print the resulting sequence of 'D's and 'S's for all six feet.\n\nThe process for this specific line is:\n*   **Foot 1:** \"verum ubi\" elides to \"ver' ubi,\" which scans as long-short-short (**Dactyl**).\n*   **Foot 2:** \"equi atque\" scans as two long syllables by treating \"equi\" as a single syllable through synizesis, and recognizing \"at\" is long by position (**Spondee**).\n*   **Foot 3:** \"(at)que hominis\" involves elision and scans as long-short-short (**Dactyl**).\n*   **Foot 4:** \"casu conve-\" scans as long-short-short (**Dactyl**).\n*   **Foot 5:** The fifth foot in hexameter is almost invariably a dactyl, covering \"-(con)venit i-\". This scans as long-short-short (**Dactyl**).\n*   **Foot 6:** \"(-it) imago\" ends the line. The final foot is always treated as a spondee, long-long (**Spondee**).\n\nThis step-by-step analysis results in the scansion D S D D D S.\n\n```python\ndef scan_hexameter_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the scansion of the given Latin hexameter line.\n    The line is \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    D = Dactyl (long, short, short)\n    S = Spondee (long, long)\n    \"\"\"\n    # The established scansion for this line of Lucretius\n    foot1 = \"D\"\n    foot2 = \"S\"\n    foot3 = \"D\"\n    foot4 = \"D\"\n    foot5 = \"D\"\n    foot6 = \"S\"\n\n    print(f\"The scansion of the line is:\")\n    print(f\"{foot1} {foot2} {foot3} {foot4} {foot5} {foot6}\")\n\nscan_hexameter_line()\n```\n<<<D S D D D S>>>"
