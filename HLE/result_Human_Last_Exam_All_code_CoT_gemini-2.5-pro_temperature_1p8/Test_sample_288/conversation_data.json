    "To identify the main synaptic target of the ASJ neurons, I will perform the following steps:\n1.  **Fetch the Data**: I will retrieve the complete adult *C. elegans* hermaphrodite connectome data from a public repository. This dataset contains all known synaptic connections, including the source neuron, target cell, type of synapse, and the number of connections (weight).\n2.  **Filter for ASJ Projections**: I will filter this large dataset to isolate only the connections originating from the ASJ neuron pair (ASJL and ASJR). I will specifically look for chemical synapses, which are the basis of neuronal projections.\n3.  **Aggregate Synapse Counts**: For each unique target cell, I will sum the number of synapses it receives from both ASJL and ASJR. This will give a total synapse count from the ASJ pair to every cell it connects to.\n4.  **Identify the Main Target**: I will then find the cell that has the highest total synapse count from this aggregated list.\n5.  **Display the Result**: Finally, I will print the name of this primary target cell and the total number of synapses it receives from ASJ.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport io\nimport requests\n\ndef find_main_asj_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the main synaptic target of the ASJ neurons in C. elegans.\n    It fetches the connectome data, filters for chemical synapses from ASJL and ASJR,\n    aggregates the synapse counts for each target, and identifies the target with the highest count.\n    \"\"\"\n    # URL for the C. elegans hermaphrodite full connectome edgelist\n    url = \"http://www.openconnecto.me/data/celegans/connectome/herm_full_edgelist.csv\"\n    \n    try:\n        # Step 1: Fetch the data\n        print(\"Fetching C. elegans connectome data...\")\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # This will raise an HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)\n        data = response.content.decode('utf-8')\n        \n        # Load the data into a pandas DataFrame.
