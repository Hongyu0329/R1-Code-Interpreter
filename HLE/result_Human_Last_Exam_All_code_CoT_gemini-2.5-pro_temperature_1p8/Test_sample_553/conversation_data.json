    "This is a great music theory question! The term \"minor fifth chord\" is a little ambiguous, but it most likely refers to a minor chord built on the fifth degree of a scale (a \"v\" chord).\n\nMy plan is to identify the Beatles song that best fits this description.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Chord Progression:** The user is asking for a jump from the tonic (the \"home\" chord, or I) to a minor chord built on the fifth degree (v).\n2.  **Identify the Key and Chords:** In the key of F, the tonic (I) is an F major chord. The fifth note is C. A minor chord built on C is C minor (C-Eb-G). This would be the \"minor fifth chord\" (v).\n3.  **Find the Song:** The song \"Michelle\" from the album *Rubber Soul* has a famous intro that establishes the key of F as the tonic center.\n4.  **Confirm the Jump:** When the vocals start with \"Michelle, ma belle...\", the song's harmony shifts directly to a C minor chord. This move from the F tonic to the C minor (v) chord is exactly the progression described.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to print this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and explains the Beatles song\n    that fits the user's description.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_name = \"Michelle\"\n    album_name = \"Rubber Soul\"\n    key = \"F\"\n    tonic_chord = \"F Major (I)\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"C minor (v)\"\n\n    explanation = f\"\"\"\nThe song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is '{song_name}'.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1.  The song is '{song_name}' from the album '{album_name}'.\n2.  The beautiful instrumental introduction establishes the musical key of '{key}' as the tonic center (the 'home' chord).\n3.  When the vocals begin (\"Michelle, ma belle...\"), the first chord of the verse is a {minor_fifth_chord}.\n4.  This creates a beautiful and musically interesting jump from the established {tonic_chord} to the {minor_fifth_chord}.\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
