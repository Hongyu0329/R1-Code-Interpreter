    "In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix representation, the matrix is partitioned recursively. This structure can be visualized as a full binary tree. The depth of the tree corresponds to the number of levels of partitioning.\n\nFor an HSS matrix multiplication, the algorithm involves operations at each node of this corresponding tree. Therefore, the total number of submatrices accessed is equal to the total number of nodes in the binary tree.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Model the problem as finding the total number of nodes in a full binary tree of a given depth.\n2.  The depth of the tree is given as 4. This means the tree has levels from 0 (the root) to 4 (the leaves).\n3.  The number of nodes at any level `k` in a full binary tree is `2^k`.\n4.  I will write a Python script to calculate the sum of nodes across all levels from 0 to 4, which is `2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4`.\n5.  The script will display the breakdown of the calculation and the final sum.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hss_submatrices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrices accessed during matrix multiplication\n    for an HSS tree of a given depth.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The depth of the Hierarchical Semi-separable tree.\n    depth = 4\n\n    print(\"For a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree, matrix multiplication involves accessing data associated with each node.\")\n    print(f\"The tree has a depth of {depth}, meaning it has levels from 0 to {depth}.\")\n    print(\"The number of nodes at each level 'k' in this binary tree is 2^k.\")\n    print(\"To find the total number of submatrices accessed, we sum the nodes at each level.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    \n    # Calculate the number of nodes at each level from 0 to depth.\n    nodes_per_level = []\n    for k in range(depth + 1):\n        nodes_per_level.append(int(math.pow(2, k)))\n        \n    # Calculate the total number of nodes.\n    total_nodes = sum(nodes_per_level)\n    \n    # Create the equation string to display the calculation.\n    # e.g., \"1 + 2 + 4 + ...\"\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, nodes_per_level))\n    \n    print(f\"Total Submatrices = {equation_str} = {total_nodes}\")\n\nsolve_hss_submatrices()\n```\n<<<31>>>"
