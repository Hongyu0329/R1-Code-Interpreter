    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the spaces and the map:**\n    The domain is $D = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    The codomain is $C = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. Since $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{10}$, the codomain is $C \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$.\n    The map is a natural one arising from the Samelson product, which relates the loop structures.\n\n2.  **Define Connectivity of a Map:**\n    A map $f: D \\to C$ between path-connected spaces is said to be $k$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(D) \\to \\pi_i(C)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and an epimorphism (surjection) for $i = k$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Connectivity of the Spaces:**\n    - The sphere $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected.\n    - The loop space $\\Omega X$ of a $k$-connected space $X$ is $(k-1)$-connected.\n    - The smash product $A \\wedge B$ of a $k$-connected space $A$ and an $l$-connected space $B$ is $(k+l+1)$-connected.\n    - The suspension $\\Sigma X$ of a $k$-connected space $X$ is $(k+1)$-connected.\n\n    - Codomain $C = \\Omega S^{10}$: $S^{10}$ is 9-connected, so $\\Omega S^{10}$ is **8-connected**.\n    - Domain $D = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$:\n        - $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2)=2$-connected.\n        - $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2)=4$-connected.\n        - $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1)=7$-connected.\n        - $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1)=**8-connected**$.\n\n    Both the domain and codomain are 8-connected. This means $\\pi_i(D)=0$ and $\\pi_i(C)=0$ for $i \\le 8$. The map $f_*$ is trivially an isomorphism for $i<9$. We need to analyze the map for $i \\ge 9$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Map on Homotopy Groups for $i \\ge 9$:**\n    We will examine the map on $\\pi_i$ for $i=9, 10, 11, \\dots$ until the connectivity condition is determined. For this, we need to compute the relevant homotopy groups.\n\n    - **Domain homotopy groups:** By the Freudenthal suspension theorem, $\\pi_i(D) = \\pi_i(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_{i-1}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ for $i$ in a certain range. We can approximate $\\Omega S^n$ by its first cell, which is $S^{n-1}$. So, $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\approx S^3 \\wedge S^5 = S^8$ in low dimensions. A better approximation using the next cells is $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\approx S^8 \\vee S^{10} \\vee S^{12} \\dots$. We will use this to calculate the homotopy groups.\n    - **Codomain homotopy groups:** $\\pi_i(C) = \\pi_i(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(S^{10})$.\n\n    We will use known values for the homotopy groups of spheres. The Python code below will carry out this step-by-step analysis.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Store known homotopy groups of spheres as pi_i(S^j) in a dictionary.\n# Key: (i, j), Value: a string representing the group, e.g., 'Z', 'Z2', 'Z24'\nhomotopy_groups = {\n    (8, 8): 'Z', (8, 10): '0',\n    (9, 8): 'Z2', (9, 10): '0',\n    (10, 8): 'Z24', (10, 10): 'Z',\n    (11, 10): 'Z2',\n    (12, 10): '0',\n}\n\ndef get_pi(i, j):\n    \"\"\"Get the homotopy group pi_i(S^j) from the pre-computed table.\"\"\"\n    return homotopy_groups.get((i, j), 'Unknown')\n\ndef get_group_info(group_str):\n    \"\"\"Helper to check if a group is zero or not.\"\"\"\n    if group_str in ['0', 'Unknown']:\n        return '0'\n    return 'non-zero'\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map by checking the effect on homotopy groups dimension by dimension.\n    \"\"\"\n    m = 4\n    n = 6\n\n    print(f\"Goal: Find the connectivity of the map f: Sigma(Omega S^{m} wedge Omega S^{n}) -> Omega(S^{m} wedge S^{n})\")\n    print(f\"For m={m}, n={n}, this is f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^10)\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the connectivity of the domain and codomain.\")\n    conn_domain = (m - 2) + (n - 2) + 1 + 1\n    conn_codomain = (m + n) - 2\n    print(f\"The domain D is {conn_domain}-connected.\")\n    print(f\"The codomain C is {conn_codomain}-connected.\")\n    print(f\"This means f_*: pi_i(D) -> pi_i(C) is an isomorphism for i < {conn_domain + 1} (0 -> 0).\\n\")\n\n    # Start checking from the first non-trivial dimension\n    for k in range(conn_domain + 1, 20):\n        print(f\"--- Checking dimension k = {k} ---\")\n\n        # Domain group calculation\n        # pi_k(D) ~= pi_{k-1}(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6)\n        # We approximate Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6 by S^8 v S^10\n        # so pi_{k-1}(D) ~= pi_{k-1}(S^8) + pi_{k-1}(S^10)\n        pi_k_minus_1_S8 = get_pi(k - 1, 8)\n        pi_k_minus_1_S10 = get_pi(k - 1, 10)\n        \n        domain_group = f\"Z_{int(pi_k_minus_1_S8[1:])} + Z_{int(pi_k_minus_1_S10[1:])}\" if pi_k_minus_1_S8.startswith('Z') and pi_k_minus_1_S10.startswith('Z') else f\"{pi_k_minus_1_S8} + {pi_k_minus_1_S10}\"\n        if pi_k_minus_1_S8 == '0': domain_group = pi_k_minus_1_S10\n        if pi_k_minus_1_S10 == '0': domain_group = pi_k_minus_1_S8\n        if pi_k_minus_1_S8 == '0' and pi_k_minus_1_S10 == '0': domain_group = '0'\n\n        # Codomain group calculation\n        # pi_k(C) ~= pi_{k+1}(S^10)\n        codomain_group = get_pi(k + 1, 10)\n        \n        print(f\"pi_{k}(Domain)  = pi_{k-1}(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) ~= pi_{k-1}(S^8) + pi_{k-1}(S^10) = {pi_k_minus_1_S8} + {pi_k_minus_1_S10} = {domain_group}\")\n        print(f\"pi_{k}(Codomain) = pi_{k+1}(S^10) = {codomain_group}\")\n        \n        # Check map properties based on known results\n        if k == 9:\n            print(\"f_* is an isomorphism (Z -> Z).
