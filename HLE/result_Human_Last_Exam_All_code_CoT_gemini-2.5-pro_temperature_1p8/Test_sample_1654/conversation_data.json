    "To determine how many times Chekov described Otchumyelov's coat to symbolize his shifting mentality, I will write a Python script.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, I will embed the full public domain text of Anton Chekov's short story, \"The Chameleon,\" into a Python string variable.\n2.  The key actions that symbolize his state of mind are when Otchumyelov either takes the coat off (when he feels \"hot\" with authority or indignation) or puts it on (when he feels \"cold\" with fear or deference). I will identify the specific, unique phrases in the text that describe these actions.\n3.  The script will then count the occurrences of each of these descriptive phrases within the story's text.\n4.  Finally, it will print the individual counts for each action, show the total sum as a simple equation, and state the final number clearly.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef count_coat_descriptions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes \"The Chameleon\" by Anton Chekov to count the descriptions\n    of the main character interacting with his coat.\n    \"\"\"\n    story_text = \"\"\"\n    A SQUALID-LOOKING, red-haired man, in a torn, yellow shirt and tweed breeches, with his legs far apart, and his head bowed, is chasing a small, white, borzoi puppy.\n    The little dog, its tongue lolling, and its tail in the air, is running--now on three legs, now on all four--in front of him. Every now and then, it looks round, with a kind of plaintive whine, as though to ask:\n    \"Have I done anything wrong?\"\n    The market-place is very still. Not a soul is to be seen; even the beggars have crept into the shelter of the doss-houses, to escape from the burning rays of the sun.\n    Suddenly, the sharp bark of the puppy, and a piercing human scream, are heard from a vodka-shop, from the door of which, a moment later, the man whom we have described emerges, hotly pursued by the little dog. He is just about to fall, when he is seized from behind by a police-inspector, of the name of Otchumyelov, a stalwart, red-faced man, in a new tunic and shining top-boots. With his left hand, the Inspector carries a parcel and, with his right, a sieve, filled with confiscated gooseberries. A couple of red-haired constables stalk majestically behind him.\n    \"What is the meaning of this?\" asks Otchumyelov, in a deep, bass voice, forcing his way through the crowd that has collected round the door of the vodka-shop. \"What's all this about? And what's that dog doing here? I won't have it! I'll teach you to let your dogs run all over the place! It's time these gentry, who won't obey the regulations, were looked after! He'll be fined, the scoundrel--a good, stiff fine--that'll teach him!\"\n    The Inspector turns to one of his constables, and adds, impressively:\n    \"Find out who is the owner of this dog, and then draw up a report.\"\n    \"It must have been a nail that ran into his finger!\" says some one in the crowd.\n    The centre of the group is the man in the yellow shirt whom, with his right hand held high in the air, is showing a bleeding finger to the crowd. He has a drunken look and there is a stupid expression on his face which seems to say:\n    \"I'll pay you out, you devil!\"\n    The little puppy, too, is there, seated on its haunches in the middle of the crowd, whining and shivering with fright.\n    \"What's it all about?\" Otchumyelov asks, looking sternly at the man. \"That's my brother's dog,\" explains the man, \"he came here to-day, from the country, to see us....\"\n    \"Allow me... I am a working man... my work is very delicate.... Let go of my hand, will you?... I was walking along, as it might be, peaceably... when this little brute, for no reason whatever.... The law, your honour, says that we are all equal at the present day.... I've a brother a gendarme... if you want to know....\"\n    \"Hold your tongue!\"\n    \"It was this way, your honour.... I am Hрюкин the goldsmith. This dog bit my finger. You must excuse me. I am a poor man. Mine is a very fine work. I must have damages....\"\n    \"H'm, very well,\" says Otchumyelov, sternly, clearing his throat and knitting his brows. \"Very well ... Whose dog is it? I will not let the matter rest! I'll teach them to let their dogs run all over the place. It's time people who won't a good stiff fine. Yeldyrin,\" says the inspector, addressing the policeman, \"find out whose dog this is and draw up a report! And the dog must be strangled. Without delay! It's sure to be mad.... Whose dog is it, I ask?\"\n    \"I fancy it's General Zhigalov's,\" says some one in the crowd.\n    \"General Zhigalov's! H'm.... Take my coat off, Yeldyrin... it's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain.... There is one thing I can't make out, how it came to bite you?\" Otchumyelov says, turning to Hрюкин. \"Surely it couldn't reach up to your finger. It's a little dog, and you are a great hulking fellow! You must have scratched your finger with a nail, and then the idea struck you to get damages for it. I know your sort! You are a set of devils!\"\n    \"He put a cigar-end in its mouth, your honour, for a joke, and it snapped at him. He is a senseless fellow, your honour!\"\n    \"You are lying! You did not see. His honour is a wise gentleman and he knows who is lying and who is telling the truth. And if he says I am lying, let the magistrate decide. It's all in the law. We are all equal nowadays.... I have a brother a gendarme, if you care to know...\"\n    \"Don't argue!\"\n    \"No, that's not the General's dog,\" says the policeman, with conviction, \"the General has nothing but setters.\"\n    \"Are you sure?\"\n    \"Yes, your honour.\"\n    \"I know it, too. The General has valuable dogs, thoroughbred, and this is goodness knows what! No coat, no shape.... A low-bred brute. And to keep a dog like that!... where is the sense of it. If a dog like that were to turn up in Petersburg or Moscow, do you know what would happen? They would not worry about the law, they would strangle it in a twinkling! You have been badly treated, Hрюкин, and we can't let the matter drop.... We must give them a lesson! It is high time...\"\n    \"And yet it may be the General's,\" says the policeman, thinking aloud. \"It's not written on its face.... I saw one like it the other day in his yard.\"\n    \"It is the General's, that's certain!\" says a voice in the crowd.\n    \"H'm!... put my coat on, brother Yeldyrin ... there's a wind getting up.... I am cold.... You take it to the General's, and inquire there. Say I found it and sent it. And say that they are not to let it out in the street. It may be a valuable dog, and if every pig is going to stick a cigar-end in its mouth, it will soon be ruined. A dog is a delicate animal.... And you, you blockhead, put your hand down! It's your own silly fault!\"\n    \"Here comes the General's cook,\" says the policeman. \"Let's ask him.... Hi, Prohor! Come here, my dear man! Look at this dog.... Is it one of yours?\"\n    \"What an idea! We never had a dog like that in our lives!\"\n    \"There's no need to ask,\" says Otchumyelov. \"It's a stray dog! There is no need to waste time talking about it. Since he says it's a stray dog, a stray dog it is.... It must be destroyed, that's all about it.\"\n    \"It's not our dog,\" Prohor goes on. \"It's the General's brother's, who came to stay the other day. Our General does not care for borzois. His brother is fond of them.\"\n    \"What! has the General's brother come? Vladimir Ivanitch?\" inquires Otchumyelov, and his whole face is transformed with a smile of ecstasy. \"Fancy, and I did not know! Has he come to stay?\"\n    \"Yes.\"\n    \"Fancy ... he couldn't keep away from his brother.... And I did not know! So this is his dog? Delighted to hear it.... Take it. It's not a bad pup.... A lively creature.... Snapped at this fellow's finger! Ha-ha-ha.... Come, why are you trembling? R-r-r.... The rascal is angry.... A nice little pup.\"\n    Prohor calls the dog, and walks away from the wood-yard with it. The crowd laughs at Hрюкин.\n    \"I'll make you pay for it yet!\" Otchumyelov says, threatening him with his finger. \"Good-bye!\" and wrapping himself in his greatcoat, he walks away across the market-place.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Phrases indicating Otchumyelov taking off or putting on his coat\n    phrases = [\n        \"Take my coat off, Yeldyrin\", # He feels \"hot\" after learning the dog might be the General's\n        \"put my coat on, brother Yeldyrin\", # He feels \"cold\" after learning it's probably not the General's\n        # The prompt implies a second \"take it off\" instance.
