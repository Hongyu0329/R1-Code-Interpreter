    # The mucoid phenotype is caused by mutations in the mucA gene.

    # The mutations occur randomly across the gene.
    # A higher rate means more opportunities for different types of mutations (point, deletion, etc.)
    # at different locations within the mucA gene.
    # This leads to a wider variety, or "spectrum", of mutations.
