    "The question asks for the number of distinct types of stable reduction for a curve of genus 2. This is a problem in algebraic geometry, and the answer comes from classifying the possible combinatorial structures of stable curves of arithmetic genus 2.\n\nA stable curve is a connected, complete curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes), and where any smooth rational component (a component that is a projective line) intersects the other components in at least three points. The arithmetic genus of the stable reduction must be the same as the genus of the original curve, which is 2.\n\nThe classification can be carried out by considering the number of irreducible components of the stable curve.\n\n1.  **Irreducible Types (1 component):** If the curve `C` is irreducible, its arithmetic genus is `p_a(C) = g + δ`, where `g` is the geometric genus and `δ` is the number of nodes. We need `g + δ = 2`. This gives three possibilities:\n    *   `g=2, δ=0`: A smooth curve of genus 2 (this is the case of \"good reduction\").\n    *   `g=1, δ=1`: An elliptic curve with one node.\n    *   `g=0, δ=2`: A rational curve with two nodes.\n    This gives **3** irreducible types.\n\n2.  **Reducible Types (2 or more components):** A detailed analysis shows that for a stable curve of genus 2, configurations with 3 or more components are not possible (they are either unstable or have a different arithmetic genus). We only need to consider the case of 2 components. If the curve `C` has two components `C₁` and `C₂`, the arithmetic genus is `p_a(C) = g(C₁) + g(C₂) + δ - 1 = 2`, which means `g(C₁) + g(C₂) + δ = 3`. This gives four possibilities:\n    *   `g(C₁)=1, g(C₂)=1, δ=1`: Two smooth elliptic curves meeting at a single point.\n    *   `g(C₁)=1, g(C₂)=0, δ=2`: A smooth elliptic curve meeting a nodal rational curve at a single point.\n    *   `g(C₁)=0, g(C₂)=0, δ=3`: Two smooth rational curves meeting at three points.\n    *   `g(C₁)=0, g(C₂)=0, δ=3`: Two nodal rational curves meeting at a single point.\n    This gives **4** reducible types.\n\nThe total number of types of stable reduction is the sum of these cases. The following Python code enumerates these types and calculates the total.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the total number of types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\n# The calculation is based on the classification of stable curves of arithmetic genus 2.\n\n# First, we count the types where the stable curve is irreducible (has one component).\n# For an irreducible curve, the arithmetic genus is g + delta = 2.\nnum_irreducible_types = 3\nprint(\"Number of irreducible types of stable reduction:\")\nprint(\"1.
