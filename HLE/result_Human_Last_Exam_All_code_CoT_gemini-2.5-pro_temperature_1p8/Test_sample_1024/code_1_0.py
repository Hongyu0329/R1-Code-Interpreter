# The reasoning for the solution is as follows:
# Part A: The Sherlock Holmes story is "The Adventure of the Priory School". The deceptive shoes were designed to imitate the hoof-prints of a cow. Thus, the answer is 6.
# Part C: The work during which Nabokov most pervasively experienced "intricate back-referencing" was his monumental translation and commentary on Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin". Thus, the answer is 7.
# Part B: Given A=6 and C=7, and the rule that the sum A+B+C must be a multiple of 8, we solve for B.
# 6 + B + 7 = 13 + B. The next multiple of 8 after 13 is 16.
# 13 + B = 16 -> B = 3.
# This choice, "education vs mis-education", is thematically sound, contrasting Holmes's brilliant deductions with the commentator Kinbote's profound misinterpretations.

part_a = 6
part_b = 3
part_c = 7
total = part_a + part_b + part_c

# The final code outputs each number in the final equation as requested.
print(f"{part_a} + {part_b} + {part_c} = {total}")

# The final answer is presented in the specified format.
print(f"{part_a} {part_b} {part_c}")

# Final Answer
print("<<<6 3 7>>>")
