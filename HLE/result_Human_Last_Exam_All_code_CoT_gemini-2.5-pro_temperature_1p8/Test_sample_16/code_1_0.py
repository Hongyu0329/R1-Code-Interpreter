    Solves the theoretical problem about the minimum number of prototypes.

    The problem asks for the minimum number of prototypes (M) required to guarantee
    that a distance-weighted soft-label kNN classifier correctly classifies C class centroids.

    Let C be the number of classes.
    """

    # Represent C symbolically as it's not given a specific value.
    num_classes = 'C'

    # Step 1: Establishing a Lower Bound (M >= C)
    #
    # To guarantee classification for any k, the condition must hold for k=1.
    # A k=1 classifier with M prototypes partitions the feature space into M Voronoi cells,
    # one for each prototype. All points within a single cell are classified the same way,
    # based on the soft label of the prototype defining that cell.
    # This means the classifier can produce at most M distinct classification results.
    #
    # We need to correctly classify C distinct centroids (c_1, ..., c_C) into
    # C distinct classes (1, ..., C). To guarantee this, the classifier must be
    # able to produce at least C different class labels.
    #
    # By the pigeonhole principle, if we have only M < C possible outcomes for C required
    # classifications, at least one class label cannot be produced, or two centroids
    # requiring different labels will get the same label.
    # Therefore, we need at least C prototypes: M >= C.

    # Step 2: Establishing an Upper Bound (M <= C)
    #
    # We can show that M = C prototypes are sufficient with a constructive strategy.
    # 1. Create C prototypes, p_1, p_2, ..., p_C.
    # 2. Place each prototype p_i arbitrarily close to its corresponding class centroid c_i.
    # 3. The soft label for a prototype p_i is based on its proximity to the class centroids.
    #    As p_i approaches c_i, its distance d(p_i, c_i) approaches 0, while its distance
    #    to other centroids d(p_i, c_j) (for j != i) remains large. Consequently, the soft
    #    label of p_i becomes "pure" for class i (i.e., its i-th component approaches 1).
    # 4. When classifying the centroid c_i, we can make the distance d(c_i, p_i) so small
    #    that p_i is guaranteed to be the nearest prototype to c_i.
    # 5. In a distance-weighted kNN, the influence of a neighbor is inversely proportional
    #    to its distance (e.g., weight = 1/distance). The tiny distance d(c_i, p_i) gives
    #    prototype p_i a massive weight in the classification of c_i.
    # 6. This dominant weight, combined with p_i's pure label for class i, ensures that the
    #    final computed soft label for c_i will have its largest value in the i-th position.
    #    Thus, class(c_i) will be correctly determined as i.
    # This construction works for any k >= 1 and any configuration of centroids.
    # Therefore, C prototypes are sufficient: M <= C.

    # Conclusion: The final equation.
    # Since M must be greater than or equal to C, and C is a sufficient number of
    # prototypes, the minimum number required is exactly C.

    print("The minimum number of prototypes required is equal to the number of classes, C.")
    print("\nThe derived final equation is:")
    # The requirement to "output each number in the final equation" is met by printing
    # the symbolic variable 'C' which represents the number of classes.
