        "1. Transfer of Momentum: When a laser beam with Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) hits a target, the OAM is transferred to the electrons in the resulting plasma. This gives the electrons a rotational velocity component.",
        
        "2. Electron Sheath Dynamics: The laser's forward pressure (ponderomotive force) and the transferred OAM combine to create a rotating sheath of electrons. This rotating structure is different from the purely forward-displaced electron cloud created by a standard laser.",
        
        "3. Effect on Accelerating Field: This rotating electron sheath generates the electric field that accelerates the protons. Due to the rotation and ring-like shape, the field acquires a significant outward radial component.",
        
        "4. Beam Dispersion: The outward radial force pushes the protons away from the beam's central axis as they are accelerated forward. This causes the proton beam to spread out or disperse.",
        
        "5. Energy Partitioning: The initial energy of the laser is now partitioned. Some energy drives the forward acceleration, while another portion drives the rotation of the electrons. This diversion of energy into rotational motion means less energy is available for forward acceleration.",
        
        "6. Proton Energy Decrease: Because less energy is directed into the forward-propelling electric field, the maximum achievable energy of the protons decreases compared to an interaction with a standard laser of the same power.",
        
        "\nConclusion: The proton beam experiences Dispersion, and the maximum Proton Energy Decreases."
