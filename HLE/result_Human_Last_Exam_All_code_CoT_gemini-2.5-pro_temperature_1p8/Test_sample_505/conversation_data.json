    "In this problem, we need to calculate the total number of logical qubits that can be encoded across two separate patches of a surface code, where each patch has two holes.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve this:\n1.  **Determine Qubits per Patch:** First, we need to figure out how many logical qubits a single surface code patch with two holes can encode.\n    *   A standard planar surface code (with no holes) encodes 1 logical qubit.\n    *   Introducing holes into the code allows for encoding additional logical qubits. The number of additional qubits that can be encoded with `n` holes is `n-1`.\n    *   Therefore, for a single patch with `n` holes, the total number of logical qubits is `1 (from the base patch) + (n - 1) (from the holes)`, which simplifies to `n`.\n    *   In our case, each patch has `n=2` holes, so each patch can encode `2` logical qubits.\n\n2.  **Calculate Total Qubits:** Since we have two separate and independent patches, the total number of logical qubits is simply the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n    *   Total qubits = (Qubits from Patch 1) + (Qubits from Patch 2).\n\n3.  **Final Calculation:** With 2 qubits per patch and 2 patches, the total is `2 + 2 = 4`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final result as an equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in\n    two patches of surface code, each with two holes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Number of independent patches\n    num_patches = 2\n\n    # Number of holes in each patch\n    num_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n    # For a single planar surface code patch with 'n' holes, the number of\n    # logical qubits it can encode is equal to 'n'.\n    # This is because the base patch provides 1 qubit and the 'n' holes\n    # provide an additional 'n-1' qubits, for a total of 1 + (n-1) = n.\n    qubits_per_patch = num_holes_per_patch\n\n    # The total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each\n    # independent patch. Since both patches are identical, we can multiply.\n    total_qubits = num_patches * qubits_per_patch\n\n    # Print the final calculation as an equation.\n    # We construct the equation string to show the contribution from each patch.\n    equation_parts = [str(qubits_per_patch) for _ in range(num_patches)]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts) + f\" = {total_qubits}\"\n    \n    print(\"The total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch.\")\n    print(\"Calculation:\")\n    print(equation_str)\n\nsolve()\n<<<4>>>\n```"
