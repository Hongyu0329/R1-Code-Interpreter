# Based on the derivation, the unique integer root must be n=3.
n = 3

# The value of f(3) can be calculated from the formula derived in the thinking steps:
# f(3) = (27 - n**3) - (7/16)*(3-n)
# where the dependency on 'a' has been eliminated by setting its coefficient to zero.

# Let's define the components of the equation for f(3)
term1_val = 27 - n**3
term2_val_coeff = sympy.Rational(7, 16)
term2_val_factor = 3 - n

# Calculate the final value
f3 = term1_val - term2_val_coeff * term2_val_factor
