    "An element of a Coxeter group has a regular eigenvector if and only if it is a regular element. A key result from the theory of reflection groups states that an element `g` is regular with an eigenvalue `λ` that is a primitive `h`-th root of unity (where `h` is the Coxeter number) if and only if `g` is conjugate to a power `c^k` of a Coxeter element `c`, where `k` is an integer coprime to `h`.\n\nHere is the plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Identify Group Properties**: We are working with the reflection group H3. Its order `|W|` is 120, and its Coxeter number `h` is 10.\n2.  **Identify Relevant Elements**: We need to count the elements that are conjugate to `c^k` where `c` is a Coxeter element and `gcd(k, 10) = 1`.\n3.  **Count the Exponents**: We find all integers `k` from 1 to 9 that are coprime to 10. The number of such integers is given by Euler's totient function, `phi(10)`.\n4.  **Count the Conjugacy Classes**: In the H3 group, `c^k` and `c^j` belong to the same conjugacy class if `k` is congruent to `±j` modulo `h`. We will use this to find the number of distinct conjugacy classes.\n5.  **Calculate the Size of Each Class**: The size of the conjugacy class of a regular element `c^k` (with `k` coprime to `h`) is `|W| / h`, since its centralizer has size `h`.\n6.  **Calculate Total**: The final answer is the number of distinct conjugacy classes multiplied by the size of each class.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_h3_regular_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of elements of the reflection group H3\n    that have a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define properties for the H3 group\n    # The order of the H3 group |W| is 120.\n    order_W = 120\n    # The Coxeter number h for H3 is 10.\n    h = 10\n\n    print(\"This script calculates the number of elements in the H3 reflection group with a specific property.\")\n    print(\"The property is having a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order h=10.\")\n    print(f\"Based on the theory of reflection groups, we need to count elements in a set of specific conjugacy classes.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Find the exponents k for the powers of the Coxeter element c.\n    # The elements are conjugate to c^k where gcd(k, h) = 1.\n    coprime_k = [k for k in range(1, h) if math.gcd(k, h) == 1]\n    # The number of such k is given by Euler's totient function, phi(h).\n    phi_h = len(coprime_k)\n    print(f\"The exponents k must be coprime to the Coxeter number h={h}.
