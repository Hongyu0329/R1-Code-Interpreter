# N is derived from a construction that allows a (k-1)-clustering and a (k+1)-clustering
# while making a k-clustering impossible.
# With k=3, we need valid 2-clusterings and 4-clusterings.
# Min N for 4-clustering >= 4*L.
# Our construction has N = 4*L + 2
N = 4 * L + 2

# To minimize the maximum overlap, their sizes should be as balanced as possible.

# Their sizes should also be as balanced as possible, respecting the minimum size L.

# The problem is to find the minimum possible maximum overlap between a cluster from
# the alpha clustering (C_i) and a cluster from the beta clustering (D_j).
# This is a load balancing problem. The maximum overlap w_C must be at least
# the ceiling of the largest average chunk.
