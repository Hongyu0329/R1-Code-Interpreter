    This function identifies the starting material for the described Robinson annulation reaction.
    
    The reaction is between an unknown compound and methyl vinyl ketone, which results in a 
    substituted octahydronaphthalene derivative. This is a classic Robinson annulation.
    
    By performing a retrosynthetic analysis, we can deduce the structure of the starting material.
    The substituents on the final product (4-methyl and 4a-ethylcarboxylate) that were not
    part of the newly formed ring must have been present on the starting material.
    
    This points to a substituted cyclic beta-keto ester. Mapping the substituent positions
    correctly identifies the starting compound.
