    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Base Health:** I will start by finding the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player.\n2.  **Find the Scaling Formula:** Next, I'll identify the formula that Terraria uses to increase boss health for each additional player in Expert Mode.\n3.  **Determine the Player Limit:** The term \"infinite players\" is a mathematical concept. In reality, the game's source code has a hard limit on the number of players it can handle in a session. I will use this engine limit as the practical maximum number of players.\n4.  **Calculate the Maximum Health:** Using the base health, the scaling formula, and the maximum number of players, I will write a Python script to calculate the final theoretical maximum health. The script will also display the full equation used for the calculation.\n\nBased on Terraria's source code, the key values are:\n*   **Base Health (Expert):** 3640\n*   **Health Multiplier per additional player:** 35% (or 0.35)\n*   **Maximum Players:** The engine limits the player count to 255.\n\nThe formula for health in Expert Mode multiplayer is:\n`Total Health = Base Health * (1 + 0.35 * (Number of Players - 1))`\n\nI will now calculate the health for the maximum of 255 players.\n\n```python\n# 1. Define the core variables based on the game's data.\nbase_health = 3640\nplayer_multiplier = 0.35\nmax_players = 255\n\n# 2. Calculate the health for the additional players.\n# The scaling applies to all players after the first one.\nadditional_players = max_players - 1\nhealth_scaling_factor = 1 + (player_multiplier * additional_players)\n\n# 3. Calculate the final theoretical maximum health.\n# The result is cast to an integer because health points in Terraria are whole numbers.\nmax_health = int(base_health * health_scaling_factor)\n\n# 4. Print the final equation and the result.\nprint(\"The formula for max health is: Base Health * (1 + Multiplier * (Max Players - 1))\")\nprint(f\"The calculation is: {base_health} * (1 + {player_multiplier} * ({max_players} - 1)) = {max_health}\")\nprint(f\"The theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu with {max_players} players in Expert Mode is: {max_health}\")\n```\n<<<327236>>>"
