        'A': "Traditional Han Chinese wedding attire, formalized during the Ming Dynasty, includes the embroidered dragon and phoenix robe, the phoenix crown and veil, and the red bridal veil. (Verdict: Correct. The Ming Dynasty did formalize the iconic red wedding attire and the use of the phoenix crown for high-status brides.)",
        'B': "In the Zhou Dynasty, brides covered their heads with a thin silk veil before leaving. (Verdict: Correct. Early texts like the 'Book of Rites' describe veiling practices for brides during the Zhou Dynasty rituals.)",
        'C': "During the Tang and Song dynasties, it was customary for brides to use folding fans to cover their faces when departing their parents' homes. (Verdict: Incorrect. While brides used a fan to cover their face (a practice called 障扇, zhang shan), they used a round silk fan (团扇, tuan shan). The folding fan (折扇, zhe shan) was not widely used for this purpose until later dynasties, making its mention for the Tang Dynasty an anachronism.)",
        'D': "After the Song Dynasty, the xiapei, a shawl-like garment, became the standard attire for married women. The floral crowns...referred to as the phoenix crown. (Verdict: Correct. The xiapei and phoenix crown were indeed key elements of formal attire for noblewomen in subsequent dynasties like the Ming.)",
        'E': "During the Qing Dynasty, Han Chinese brides typically dressed in a red silk blouse beneath a red embroidered robe for their wedding... (Verdict: Correct. This accurately describes the wedding attire (often a 'qun gua') for Han brides during the Qing period.)"
