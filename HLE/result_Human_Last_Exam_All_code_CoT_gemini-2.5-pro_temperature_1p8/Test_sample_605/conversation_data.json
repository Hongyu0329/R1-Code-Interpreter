    "To determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Weights and the Polynomial:** The ambient space is defined by the weights `w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)` for the variables `(z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)`. The link is defined by the polynomial equation $f=0$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Quasi-homogeneous Degree (d):** A polynomial is quasi-homogeneous if every monomial (term) has the same weighted degree. We calculate the degree for each term:\n    *   $z_1^8z_3$: $8 \\times 22 + 1 \\times 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$\n    *   $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$: $4 \\times 22 + 3 \\times 29 + 1 \\times 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$\n    *   $z_1z_2^7$: $1 \\times 22 + 7 \\times 29 = 22 + 203 = 225$\n    *   $z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5$: $1 \\times 22 + 1 \\times 29 + 1 \\times 49 + 1 \\times 50 + 1 \\times 75 = 225$\n    *   $z_2z_3^4$: $1 \\times 29 + 4 \\times 49 = 29 + 196 = 225$\n    *   $z_4^3z_5$: $3 \\times 50 + 1 \\times 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$\n    *   $z_5^3$: $3 \\times 75 = 225$\n    \n    There seems to be a typo in the second term ($z_1^4z_2^3z_3$), as its degree (224) does not match the others (225). Assuming this is a typo and the polynomial is indeed quasi-homogeneous, the degree `d` is 225.\n\n3.  **Check the Calabi-Yau Condition:** A key property of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface in a weighted projective space is that its degree `d` is equal to the sum of the weights `sum(w)`.\n    *   `sum(w) = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225`\n    *   Since `d = 225 = sum(w)`, the Calabi-Yau condition is met.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Crawley-Nordström Invariant:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant is calculated using the formula:\n    `invariant = (d - sum(w)) / d`\n    Given that `d = sum(w)` for a Calabi-Yau manifold, the invariant is expected to be 0.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_crawley_nordstrom():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the weights for the variables (z1, z2, z3, z4, z5)\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the quasi-homogeneous degree 'd'.\n    # Based on the analysis, most terms have a weighted degree of 225.\n    # We assume the polynomial is quasi-homogeneous with this degree.\n    # For example, from the term z5^3: d = 3 * 75 = 225.\n    d = 225\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the sum of the weights.\n    sum_of_weights = sum(weights)\n\n    # A Calabi-Yau hypersurface is defined by the condition d = sum(weights).\n    # Here, 225 == 225, so the condition holds.\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant.\n    # The formula is (d - sum(weights)) / d.\n    # Using float division to ensure the result is a float, although it's 0 here.\n    if d == 0:\n      print(\"Error: Degree 'd' cannot be zero.\", file=sys.stderr)\n      return\n    invariant = (d - sum_of_weights) / float(d)\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation as requested.\n    weights_str = \" + \".join(map(str, weights))\n    print(f\"The Crawley-Nordström invariant is given by the formula (d - sum(w)) / d.\")\n    print(f\"The quasi-homogeneous degree is d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"The sum of the weights is sum(w) = {sum_of_weights}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"({d} - ({weights_str})) / {d} = {invariant}\")\n\nsolve_crawley_nordstrom()\n```\n<<<0.0>>>"
