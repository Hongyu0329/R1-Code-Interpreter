    "The user wants to find the next number in the sequence.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivation:**\n\n1.  Let the sequence be denoted by `a_n`. The given terms are `a_1=2, a_2=11, a_3=23, a_4=51, a_5=119`.\n2.  Let's look for a recursive relationship between consecutive terms. A common pattern is of the form `a_{n+1} = k * a_n + C`, where `k` and `C` are constants. Given the rapid growth, `k=2` is a good guess.\n3.  Let's test the hypothesis `a_{n+1} = 2 * a_n + c_n`, where `c_n` is a sequence of constants that might vary.\n    *   For `n=1`: `a_2 = 2 * a_1 + c_1` => `11 = 2 * 2 + c_1` => `c_1 = 7`.\n    *   For `n=2`: `a_3 = 2 * a_2 + c_2` => `23 = 2 * 11 + c_2` => `c_2 = 1`.\n    *   For `n=3`: `a_4 = 2 * a_3 + c_3` => `51 = 2 * 23 + c_3` => `c_3 = 5`.\n    *   For `n=4`: `a_5 = 2 * a_4 + c_4` => `119 = 2 * 51 + c_4` => `c_4 = 17`.\n4.  The sequence of constants `c_n` is `7, 1, 5, 17, ...`. The first term `c_1=7` seems to break an otherwise clearer pattern starting from `c_2`. Let's analyze the sequence of constants starting from the second term: `1, 5, 17`.\n5.  To find the pattern in `c_n = {1, 5, 17, ...}`, let's look at the differences between its consecutive terms. Let's call this difference sequence `d_n`.\n    *   `d_2 = 5 - 1 = 4`.\n    *   `d_3 = 17 - 5 = 12`.\n6.  The sequence of differences `d_n` is `{4, 12, ...}`. This appears to be a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous one (`12 / 4 = 3`).\n7.  Assuming this pattern continues, the next difference `d_4` will be `12 * 3 = 36`.\n8.  We can use this to find the next constant, `c_5`.\n    *   `c_5 = c_4 + d_4 = 17 + 36 = 53`.\n9.  Now we can calculate the next term in the original sequence, `a_6`.\n    *   `a_6 = 2 * a_5 + c_5 = 2 * 119 + 53`.\n    *   `a_6 = 238 + 53 = 291`.\n\nThe next number in the sequence is 291.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the number sequence puzzle by identifying a multi-layered pattern.\n    1. It establishes a primary recurrence relation: a_{n+1} = 2*a_n + c_n.\n    2. It calculates the sequence of constants, c_n.\n    3. It finds a pattern within the c_n sequence by examining its differences, d_n.\n    4. It extrapolates the next terms for d_n, c_n, and finally the original sequence a_n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    a = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n    \n    # Let's analyze the pattern a_{n+1} = 2*a_n + c_n, focusing on n >= 2\n    c2 = a[2] - 2 * a[1]  # 23 - 2*11 = 1\n    c3 = a[3] - 2 * a[2]  # 51 - 2*23 = 5\n    c4 = a[4] - 2 * a[3]  # 119 - 2*51 = 17\n    \n    # The sequence of constants (starting from the second term) is 1, 5, 17\n    # Let's find the pattern in this new sequence by looking at the differences\n    d2 = c3 - c2  # 5 - 1 = 4\n    d3 = c4 - c3  # 17 - 5 = 12\n    \n    # The differences {4, 12} form a geometric progression with ratio 3\n    ratio = d3 // d2\n    \n    # The next difference d4 follows this pattern\n    d4 = d3 * ratio  # 12 * 3 = 36\n    \n    # Now, we find the next constant c5\n    c5 = c4 + d4  # 17 + 36 = 53\n    \n    # Finally, we find the next term in the original sequence, a6\n    a5 = a[4]\n    a6 = 2 * a5 + c5  # 2 * 119 + 53 = 291\n    \n    # The final equation and its result\n    # We output each number as requested\n    num1 = 2\n    num2 = a5\n    num3 = c5\n    result = a6\n    \n    print(f\"{num1} * {num2} + {num3} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
