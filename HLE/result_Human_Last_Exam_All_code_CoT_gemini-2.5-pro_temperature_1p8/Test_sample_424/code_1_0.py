# The problem asks for the number of points in a given planar set S
# whose removal causes the set to break into 3 or more components.
# This is equivalent to finding the number of points with a connectivity "degree"
# of 3 or more within the set S.
# Based on the geometric analysis, we identify these points and count them.

# Point 1: (0, 1) is a junction of the unit circle, a vertical line, and a horizontal line.
# Degree = 2 (from circle) + 2 (from vertical line) + 2 (from horizontal line) = 6.
# Since 6 >= 3, this point qualifies.
point_1_qualifies = 1

# Point 2: (1, 0) is a junction of the unit circle and a horizontal line.
# Degree = 2 (from circle) + 2 (from line) = 4.
# Since 4 >= 3, this point qualifies.
point_2_qualifies = 1

# Point 3: (-1, 0) is a junction of the unit circle and a horizontal line.
# Degree = 2 (from circle) + 2 (from line) = 4.
# Since 4 >= 3, this point qualifies.
point_3_qualifies = 1

# Point 4: (0, -1) is a junction of the unit circle and a vertical line.
# Degree = 2 (from circle) + 2 (from line) = 4.
# Since 4 >= 3, this point qualifies.
point_4_qualifies = 1

# All other junction points have a degree of 2, and all non-junction points
# have a degree of 1 or 2. None of these qualify.

# The total number of qualifying points is the sum of the points we found.
