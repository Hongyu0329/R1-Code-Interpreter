    # --- Logical Derivation ---
    
    # Step 1: All n points (P_i) must lie on the given lines.
    # The points P_i are on a circle, so they must be at the intersection
    # of a line and the circle. If a point were not on any line, it could
    # not be connected to any other point.
    
    # Step 2: An upper bound for n can be established.
    # The total number of points n is limited by the total number of
    # possible intersection points between the 9 lines and the circle.
    # The number of points in the union of sets is at most the sum of their sizes.
    # n <= sum of intersections for each line
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the maximum possible value for n.
    max_n = num_lines * max_intersections_per_line

    # Step 4: Justify that this maximum is achievable.
    # A working configuration exists: let all 9 lines pass through the circle's
    # center O. Each line creates 2 unique points on the circle if we choose
    # distinct lines. This gives 18 points. This configuration fulfills the
    # "at most 2 lines" travel condition for any pair of points in T = {O, P_1, ..., P_18}.
