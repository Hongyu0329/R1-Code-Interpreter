    Calculates the largest possible number of distinct topologies
    that can arise from iterating the dual topology operator.

    This problem is a known result in point-set topology. The maximal
    number is not achieved on a simple or finite space, but on a
    specifically constructed infinite topological space. The sequence
    of topologies generated by repeatedly applying the dual operator, D,
    eventually enters a cycle.

    Let T_0 be the original topology. Let T_{n+1} = D(T_n).
    The sequence that yields the maximum number of distinct topologies
    is known to have the form:
    T_0, T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4, (T_5, T_6, T_5, T_6, ...)

    The distinct topologies are {T_0, T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4, T_5, T_6}.
    We can calculate the total number by summing the lengths of the
    pre-period (tail) and the cycle.
