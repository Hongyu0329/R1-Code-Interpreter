# This script breaks down the calculation of the required ratio.
# The problem is to find the ratio Area(D)/Area(S) for a cube of side length s.
# D is the region on the surface S at a surface distance of at most sqrt(2)*s from a vertex P.
# The final result is a ratio, so the side length 's' cancels out. We assume s=1 for clarity.

# The final ratio is expressed as (NUM_A + NUM_B) / DENOMINATOR, where NUM_B is pi.
# Let's derive the values for NUM_A and DENOMINATOR.

# Step 1: Area on the three faces adjacent to vertex P.
# The entire area of these three faces is included in D.
# For s=1, the area of three faces is 3.
area_adjacent_faces = 3.0

# Step 2: Area on one of the three 'far' faces.
# This is calculated as Area(R1) + Area(R2) - Area(R1 intersect R2), where R1 and R2
# are regions corresponding to two shortest path unfoldings.
# From the derivation, with s=1:
# Area(R1) = Area(R2) = (pi/4 - 1/2)
# Area(R1 intersect R2) = (pi/3 - 1/2)
area_R1 = (math.pi / 4) - 0.5
area_intersect = (math.pi / 3) - 0.5
area_one_far_face = 2 * area_R1 - area_intersect  # This evaluates to (pi/6 - 1/2)

# Step 3: Total area of D.
# Area(D) = (Area on 3 adjacent faces) + 3 * (Area on one far face)
area_D = area_adjacent_faces + 3 * area_one_far_face # This evaluates to (3 + pi)/2

# Step 4: Total surface area of the cube.
# For s=1, the area S is 6.
area_S = 6.0

# Step 5: The final ratio.
# Ratio = Area(D) / Area(S) = ((3 + pi)/2) / 6 = (3 + pi) / 12
