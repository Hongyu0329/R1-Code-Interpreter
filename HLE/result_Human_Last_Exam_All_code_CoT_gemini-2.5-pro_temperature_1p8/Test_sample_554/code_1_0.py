# A program to calculate the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.

# Step 1: Define the number of hydrogen atoms in a specific, known nanocar model.
# We choose the original nanocar synthesized by the Tour group (2005).
# The formula for its chassis and axle system is C58H36.
# The wheels (C60) have no hydrogens to replace.
num_hydrogens = 36

# Step 2: The prefix "perfluoro-" means every hydrogen atom (H) is replaced by a fluorine atom (F).
# So, the number of fluorine atoms will be equal to the number of hydrogen atoms.
num_fluorines = num_hydrogens

# Step 3: Print the logic and the final answer.
# The final equation will show the total number of fluorine atoms.
print(f"Chosen model: The original Nanocar with a C58H36 chassis/axle framework.")
print(f"Number of hydrogen atoms in the framework: {num_hydrogens}")
print("The prefix 'perfluoro-' indicates that all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.")
print(f"Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms = number of hydrogen atoms.")
print(f"Final Equation: Number of fluorine atoms = {num_fluorines}")
