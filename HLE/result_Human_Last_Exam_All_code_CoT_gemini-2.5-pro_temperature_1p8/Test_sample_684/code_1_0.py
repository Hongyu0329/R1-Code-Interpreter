def solve_hypercube_problem():
    """
    Finds the values of n for which it's possible to leave a single gift.

    The problem is modeled using linear algebra over F_2. The state of the
    n^5 hypercube is a vector, and moves are also vectors. The problem is solvable
    if a specific "change" vector is in the span of the move vectors.

    This condition simplifies to a check on the number of indices modulo 7.
    Let N_k be the number of integers i in {0, ..., n-1} such that i = k (mod 7).
    The condition for solvability is that exactly one of {N_0, N_1, ..., N_6}
    is odd.

    This, in turn, simplifies to the condition that n % 14 must be 1 or 13.
