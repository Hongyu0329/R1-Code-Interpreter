    # A. "The language contains 'red frogs swim swiftly', and it is not the longest sentence in the language."
    # Let's analyze the language. The rule 'REC = REC ADJ' can never produce a finite string of terminals.
    # So the only adjectives are 'red' and 'or alike'.
    # The sentence "red frogs swim swiftly ." is in L via S -> ADJ N.
    # The sentence "or alike snakes swim swiftly ." is also in L and is longer.
    # So the statement is factually true about the language itself, but it ignores the key problem for the parsers.
    print("Analysis of A: True, but it's a statement about the language, not the feasibility of the specified parsers, which is the core issue.")
    
    # B. "RD accepts 'snake big jump well.' but PR does not."
    # The words 'snake' (plural 'snakes' is required) and 'big' are not in the grammar's vocabulary (terminals).
    # Therefore, the sentence is not in the language L, and no correct parser for L would accept it.
    print("Analysis of B: False. The sentence is not in the language.")
    
    # C. "Both RD and PR accept 'jump or alike frog swiftly.' and do not run infinitely."
    # The sentence must start with S (a noun phrase), not a verb like 'jump'. Also, 'frog' is not in the vocabulary.
    # The sentence is not in the language L.
    print("Analysis of C: False. The sentence is not in the language.")

    # D. "Neither RD nor PR can be implemented because the grammar contains left recursion."
    # As demonstrated above, the direct left recursion in 'REC = REC ADJ' makes it impossible to write
    # a standard RD or PR parser function that is guaranteed to terminate. A parser for a language
    # must be able to handle all its grammatical rules. Since this is not possible here (without modifications
    # which are disallowed), the parser for L "cannot be implemented".
