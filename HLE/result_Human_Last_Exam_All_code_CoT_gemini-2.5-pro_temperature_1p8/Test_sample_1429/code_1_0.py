def solve():
    """
    This function provides the answers to the two-part question.

    Part A: Is every boopable function Turing-computable?
    Yes. The described machine is a Turing-complete computational model. Any function it can compute can be simulated by a standard Turing machine, making it Turing-computable.

    Part B: Does a program exist for f(x)=x with time <= x+50?
    No. The performance requirement of x+50 implies a constant-time setup phase (< 50 steps) followed by x single-step BOOPs. This necessitates a "computed jump" to a location based on the input x. The provided instruction set is too minimal to implement a computed jump (either via a branching tree or self-modifying code) in under 50 instructions.
