    "To find the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, we rely on the classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields. This classification is a deep result in number theory.\n\nAn elliptic curve's torsion subgroup, $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$, has the structure $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ where $n$ divides $m$. The group is non-cyclic if and only if $n > 1$.\n\nFor the specific field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible non-cyclic torsion structures are known to be:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that calculates the order of each of these possible non-cyclic groups. The order of a group $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ is simply $m \\times n$. The script will then determine the maximum among these orders to answer the question.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an\n    elliptic curve over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # According to established theorems in number theory, the possible\n    # non-cyclic torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve over Q(sqrt(-3)) are:\n    # Z/2Z x Z/2Z, Z/2Z x Z/6Z, and Z/3Z x Z/3Z.\n    # We represent these groups as tuples (m, n) for Z/mZ x Z/nZ.\n    non_cyclic_groups = [\n        {'m': 2, 'n': 2},\n        {'m': 2, 'n': 6},\n        {'m': 3, 'n': 3}\n    ]\n\n    max_order = 0\n    \n    print(\"Calculating the orders of possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups over Q(sqrt(-3)):\\n\")\n\n    # Iterate through the groups, calculate their order, and find the maximum.\n    for group in non_cyclic_groups:\n        m = group['m']\n        n = group['n']\n        order = m * n\n        \n        # The final equation requires printing each number\n        print(f\"For the group Z/{m}Z x Z/{n}Z, the order is {m} * {n} = {order}\")\n\n        if order > max_order:\n            max_order = order\n\n    print(\"\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The largest possible order for such a subgroup is {max_order}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_largest_torsion_order()\n```\n<<<12>>>"
