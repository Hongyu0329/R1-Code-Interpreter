    # Step 1: Analyze the repair process.
    # The process described is "manual TIG welding (GTAW) build-up of layers of filler material."
    # This specifically refers to an additive process where material is added to restore the
    # original geometry of a component. It is used to replace material that has been lost.

    # Step 2: Evaluate the answer choices in the context of this repair process.
    analysis = {
        "A": "Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) is an internal cracking mechanism. While welding might be part of a complex repair, it's not the primary damage type addressed by a simple material 'build-up'.",
        "B": "Foreign Object Damage (FOD) can cause nicks and gouges, which do involve material loss. Weld build-up is a valid repair, making this a plausible answer.",
        "C": "Blade Tip Rub and Wear is the gradual loss of material from the blade tip due to contact with the engine casing. This results in reduced blade length and increased tip clearance, which hurts efficiency. TIG welding is the standard, routine industry practice to build the tip back up to its original dimensions. This is a perfect match for the described repair.",
        "D": "Creep Deformation is a bulk distortion of the entire blade. Simply adding material does not fix the underlying material degradation or change in shape.",
        "E": "Fatigue Cracking is repaired by removing the crack (e.g., by grinding) and then filling the void, but the primary description of 'build-up of layers' more strongly suggests restoring a larger worn surface area.",
        "F": "High-Temperature Oxidation and Corrosion lead to surface thinning. This is typically managed with new protective coatings rather than a structural weld build-up."
    }

    # Step 3: Conclude the most fitting answer.
    # Comparing the choices, Blade Tip Rub and Wear (C) is the most common and direct application
    # for a TIG welding 'build-up' procedure. It is a routine maintenance action to restore
    # material systematically lost from a specific area (the tip). While FOD (B) is also
    # repaired this way, tip wear is a more predictable and regularly addressed issue with this exact method.
