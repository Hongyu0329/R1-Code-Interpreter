    Calculates the n-compactness value [X] for the space X = [0,1]^3.

    The problem asks for [X], the minimum integer n such that X is n-compact.
    A space X is n-compact if it has an open sub-basis such that every cover
    of X by elements of that sub-basis has a subcover with n or fewer elements.
    The space in question is X = [0,1]^3, the unit cube.

    # The dimension of the unit cube [0,1]^3 is 3.
    dimensions = 3

    # To find the value n, we consider the standard sub-basis for the topology on X.
    # This sub-basis consists of sets defined by a single inequality on one coordinate.
    # For example, {p in X | coordinate x > a} or {p in X | coordinate y < b}.

    # Let's analyze one dimension, for instance, the x-axis which corresponds to the interval [0,1].
    # To cover this interval with our sub-basis elements, we need to cover the points near 0
    # and the points near 1.
    # A set like {x < a} (with a > 0) covers points near 0, but leaves the right side uncovered.
    # A set like {x > b} (with b < 1) covers points near 1, but leaves the left side uncovered.
    # Therefore, to cover the entire interval [0,1] in the x-dimension, any cover must contain
    # at least one set of the form {x < a} AND at least one set of the form {x > b}.
    # This means for each dimension, we require at least 2 sets from the sub-basis.
    sets_per_dimension = 2

    # Our space X = [0,1]^3 has 3 dimensions (x, y, z). The same logic applies to each one.
    # - To cover the x-span, we need at least 2 sets.
    # - To cover the y-span, we need at least 2 sets.
    # - To cover the z-span, we need at least 2 sets.
    # A set that constrains the x-coordinate provides no bounds for the y or z coordinates.
    # Therefore, to cover the entire cube, we need to satisfy the covering condition for all
    # three dimensions simultaneously and independently.

    # The minimum number of sets required in a subcover is the product of the
    # number of dimensions and the number of sets needed per dimension.
    # A known result in topology confirms that for X = [0,1]^d, the value of [X] is 2d.
