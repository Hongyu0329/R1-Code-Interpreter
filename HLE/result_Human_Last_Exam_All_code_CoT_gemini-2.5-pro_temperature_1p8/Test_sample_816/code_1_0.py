    The Marangoni force is due to gradients in surface tension. Flow is directed from low to high surface tension.
    - For most pure metals, surface tension decreases with temperature. The hot center has the lowest tension, causing OUTWARD flow.
    - For stainless steel, trace elements like sulfur reverse this effect. Surface tension INCREASES with temperature.
    - Therefore, the hot center has the highest tension, which pulls fluid INWARDS from the cooler edges.
    - This perfectly matches the observation.
