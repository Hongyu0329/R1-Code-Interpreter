    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to determine the Chern number of the junction.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Understand the components:** We have two Chern insulators. A Chern insulator is a 2D topological phase of matter characterized by an integer topological invariant called the Chern number (C).\n2.  **Identify the properties:** Both insulators are given to have a Chern number C=1.\n3.  **Understand the operation:** The two insulators are connected \"laterally\" to form a junction. This creates a larger, composite system.\n4.  **Apply the relevant physical principle:** For non-interacting or weakly coupled topological systems, the Chern number is an additive quantity. When two Chern insulators with numbers C1 and C2 are joined together, the Chern number of the resulting composite system (C_total) is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n5.  **Calculate the result:**\n    *   C1 = 1\n    *   C2 = 1\n    *   C_total = C1 + C2 = 1 + 1 = 2\n6.  **Interpret the result:** The combined system behaves as a single Chern insulator with a Chern number of 2. This implies that at the external boundary of this composite system, there will be two co-propagating chiral edge states. The interface (the junction) between the two original insulators will have counter-propagating states that gap each other out, becoming insulating, consistent with a net zero flow at the internal boundary.\n7.  **Construct the code:** I will write a Python script that defines the Chern numbers for the two insulators, calculates their sum, and prints the result along with the equation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_junction_chern_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Chern number of a junction of two Chern insulators.\n\n    The Chern number is an additive topological invariant. When two topological\n    insulators are joined, the Chern number of the composite system is the sum\n    of their individual Chern numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Chern number of the first insulator\n    c1 = 1\n    # Chern number of the second insulator\n    c2 = 1\n\n    # The total Chern number of the composite system is the sum of the individuals.\n    c_total = c1 + c2\n\n    print(f\"The system consists of two Chern insulators joined together.\")\n    print(f\"The first insulator has a Chern number C1 = {c1}.\")\n    print(f\"The second insulator has a Chern number C2 = {c2}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe Chern number of the composite system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers:\")\n    print(f\"C_total = C1 + C2\")\n    print(f\"C_total = {c1} + {c2} = {c_total}\")\n\ncalculate_junction_chern_number()\n<<<2>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
