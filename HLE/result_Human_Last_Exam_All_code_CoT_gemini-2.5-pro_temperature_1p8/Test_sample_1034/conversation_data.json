    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Set Up the Geometry Problem**: We are given a triangle ABC with side $BC = S$ and $\\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$. We need to find the number of integer values for side AC for which side AB can have two different possible lengths. For the purpose of this problem, we will assume the placeholder $S=SNYWR$ evaluates to the integer `49197`.\n2.  **Identify the Ambiguous Case**: This problem describes the \"ambiguous case\" of the Law of Sines (or Cosines), often referred to as the Side-Side-Angle (SSA) case. We are given side $BC$, angle $B$, and we are exploring values for side $AC$. For there to be two possible triangles, and thus two possible lengths for side $AB$, a specific condition must be met.\n3.  **Formulate the Condition**: The condition for two distinct triangles to exist when one angle is acute (like $\\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$) is that the side opposite the angle ($AC$) must be longer than the altitude from the other vertex ($A$) but shorter than the other given side ($BC$). Let $h$ be the altitude from vertex $A$ to the line containing side $BC$. No, this is not the right altitude. The altitude that matters is from the vertex connecting the two given sides, which is vertex C. The altitude from C to the line containing AB is $h = BC \\sin(B)$. So the condition for two possible triangles is $h < AC < BC$.\n4.  **Calculate the Bounds**:\n    *   $BC = S = 49197$.\n    *   The altitude $h = S \\times \\sin(30^{\\circ}) = S \\times 0.5$.\n    *   Substituting $S=49197$, we get $h = 49197 \\times 0.5 = 24598.5$.\n    *   So, the inequality for the length of $AC$ is $24598.5 < AC < 49197$.\n5.  **Count the Integers**: We need to find the number of integers in the interval $(24598.5, 49197)$.\n    *   The smallest integer value for $AC$ is $24599$.\n    *   The largest integer value for $AC$ is $49196$.\n    *   The total count is `Last Integer - First Integer + 1`.\n6.  **Create Python Code**: A Python script will be written to perform these calculations and print the reasoning, the final equation, and the result as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_triangle_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of integer values for a side of a triangle in the SSA ambiguous case.\n\n    Let S = SNYWR.
