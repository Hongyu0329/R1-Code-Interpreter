    Analyzes the provided options about interactive proof systems and identifies the correct one.
    
    The analysis logic is as follows:
    - A is incorrect because it describes non-interactive proofs (NP), not interactive ones (IP).
    - B is incorrect because the Graph Non-Isomorphism proof is a classic, foundational example.
    - C is incorrect because quantum entanglement (MIP*) allows verifying extremely complex problems (MIP* = RE).
    - D is correct. It accurately describes the asymmetry of computational power: the verifier is efficient (polynomial-time),
      while the prover is computationally powerful (unbounded, which includes exponential power).
    - E is incorrect because amplification shows the exact completeness/soundness values don't matter, only the gap.
    - F is incorrect because multiple provers (MIP = NEXP) are more powerful than one (IP = PSPACE).
    - G is incorrect because interactive proofs can solve PSPACE problems, which are believed to be much harder than NP problems.
    - H is incorrect because languages in complexity theory are typically defined over a binary alphabet, not trinary.
    - I is incorrect because it states a flawed soundness condition for NP.
    - J describes a very specific concept from PCP theory, not a general characteristic of all interactive proofs.
    
    Conclusion: Statement D is the best and most accurate description among the choices.
