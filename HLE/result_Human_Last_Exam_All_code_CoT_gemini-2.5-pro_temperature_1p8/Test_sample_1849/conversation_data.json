    "To solve this, we need to analyze the conditions for the convergence of the value iteration algorithm.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Introduce the value iteration algorithm and its update rule, which is based on the Bellman operator, `T`.\n2.  Explain that the guarantee of geometric convergence comes from the Banach fixed-point theorem, which applies if the Bellman operator is a contraction mapping.\n3.  Demonstrate the proof that the Bellman operator is a contraction mapping with a factor `γ` (the discount factor).\n4.  Show how the reward `R` behaves in this proof. The key insight is that the reward term cancels out when analyzing the distance between two successive applications of the operator.\n5.  Based on this observation, conclude the range of rewards for which the contraction property holds.\n\nThe following Python script will walk through this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef explain_value_iteration_convergence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the convergence property of the Value Iteration algorithm\n    to determine the required range for the reward function.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The convergence of the Value Iteration algorithm is proven by showing that the Bellman operator, T, is a contraction mapping.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe value iteration update is: V_{k+1}(s) = (T V_k)(s) = max_a Σ_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + γ * V_k(s')]\")\n    print(\"\\nFor T to be a contraction, it must satisfy the following inequality for any two value functions V1 and V2, and a discount factor 0 ≤ γ < 1:\")\n    print(\"||T(V1) - T(V2)|| ≤ γ * ||V1 - V2||\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's analyze the term ||T(V1) - T(V2)||.\")\n    print(\"For any state s, let a1 be the action that maximizes T(V1) and a2 be the action for T(V2).\")\n    print(\"\\nT(V1)(s) - T(V2)(s) = Σ P(s'|s,a1)[R + γV1(s')] - Σ P(s'|s,a2)[R + γV2(s')]\")\n    print(\"\\nBecause a1 is the maximizing action for the first term, we have:\")\n    print(\"T(V1)(s) - T(V2)(s) ≤ Σ P(s'|s,a1)[R + γV1(s')] - Σ P(s'|s,a1)[R + γV2(s')]\")\n    print(\"                     = Σ P(s'|s,a1) * γ * [V1(s') - V2(s')]\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nNotice that the reward term 'R' cancels out in this step of the proof.\")\n    print(\"The derivation continues until we get the final inequality for the contraction property.\")\n    \n    # Final equation output per instructions\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation for Contraction Property:\")\n    # Since there are no numerical values in the property itself, we represent it symbolically.\n    # The property holds for any gamma in the range [0, 1).
