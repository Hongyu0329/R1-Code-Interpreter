    "To answer this question, we first need to understand the notation of the 6-311G** basis set and how it applies to different atoms. The total number of primitive Gaussians depends on the specific atoms in the molecule being studied. I will provide a step-by-step breakdown for a hydrogen atom and a second-row heavy atom (like Carbon), and then write a Python script to calculate the total for a common molecule, methane (CH4), as a representative example.\n\n### **Plan:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name (6-311G**):**\n    *   **6-311G**: This describes the core and valence atomic orbitals. It is a \"split-valence\" triple-zeta basis set.\n        *   **Core electrons**: Each core atomic orbital is represented by a single basis function, which is a sum (contraction) of **6** primitive Gaussian functions.\n        *   **Valence electrons**: Each valence atomic orbital is represented by three basis functions. The \"inner\" valence function is a contraction of **3** primitives. The \"middle\" and \"outer\" valence functions are uncontracted, each composed of **1** primitive.\n    *   **\\*\\***: These asterisks denote the addition of polarization functions, which improve the description of chemical bonding.\n        *   The first `*` adds a set of **d-type** primitive functions to each non-hydrogen (heavy) atom. A set of Cartesian d-functions has 6 primitives (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz).\n        *   The second `*` adds a set of **p-type** primitive functions to each hydrogen atom. A set of p-functions has 3 primitives (p_x, p_y, p_z).\n\n2.  **Calculate Primitives per Atom:**\n    *   **For a Hydrogen atom (H):**\n        *   It has only a 1s valence orbital and no core electrons.\n        *   **s-primitives**: From the \"311\" split, we have 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** primitive s-functions.\n        *   **p-primitives**: The second `**` adds one set of p-functions, which is **3** primitive p-functions.\n        *   Total for H = 5 (s) + 3 (p) = **8** primitives.\n    *   **For a Carbon atom (C), as a representative heavy atom:**\n        *   **Core (1s orbital)**: Represented by a contraction of **6** primitive s-functions.\n        *   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals)**:\n            *   **s-primitives**: The 2s orbital uses the \"311\" split: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitives. Total s-primitives = 6 (core) + 5 (valence) = **11**.\n            *   **p-primitives**: The 2p orbitals also use the \"311\" split: 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** primitive p-functions.\n            *   **d-primitives**: The first `*` adds one set of d-functions, which is **6** primitive d-functions.\n        *   Total for C = 11 (s) + 5 (p) + 6 (d) = **22** primitives.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total for a Molecule (Methane, CH4):**\n    *   The script will sum the primitives for each atom in the molecule (1 Carbon and 4 Hydrogens).\n    *   Total = (1 × Primitives for C) + (4 × Primitives for H)\n\nNow, here is the Python code that performs this calculation for methane (CH4).\n\n```python\ndef calculate_primitives_for_methane():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total number of primitive Gaussians for a methane (CH4)\n    molecule using the 6-311G** basis set.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the number of primitives for each type of atom based on 6-311G**\n    \n    # For Hydrogen (H):\n    # s-primitives (from '311' valence): 3 + 1 + 1 = 5\n    # p-primitives (from '**'): 3\n    primitives_H = 5 + 3\n    \n    # For a second-row heavy atom like Carbon (C):\n    # s-primitives (1s core '6' + 2s valence '311'): 6 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 11\n    # p-primitives (2p valence '311'): 3 + 1 + 1 = 5\n    # d-primitives (from '*'): 6\n    primitives_C = 11 + 5 + 6\n    \n    # Methane (CH4) has 1 Carbon atom and 4 Hydrogen atoms\n    num_C = 1\n    num_H = 4\n    \n    # Calculate total primitives\n    total_primitives = (num_C * primitives_C) + (num_H * primitives_H)\n    \n    # Print the explanation and calculation\n    print(\"Calculation of primitive Gaussians for Methane (CH4) with the 6-311G** basis set:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 75)\n    print(f\"Primitives for one Carbon (C) atom: {primitives_C}\")\n    print(f\"Primitives for one Hydrogen (H) atom: {primitives_H}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 75)\n    \n    # Build and print the equation for methane\n    equation_parts = []\n    # Add carbon part\n    equation_parts.append(str(primitives_C) + \" (C)\")\n    # Add hydrogen parts\n    for _ in range(num_H):\n        equation_parts.append(str(primitives_H) + \" (H)\")\n        \n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(f\"Total for CH4 = {equation_str}\")\n    print(f\"Total = {primitives_C} + {num_H * primitives_H}\")\n    print(f\"Final total number of primitive Gaussians = {total_primitives}\")\n\n# Run the calculation\ncalculate_primitives_for_methane()\n```\n<<<54>>>"
