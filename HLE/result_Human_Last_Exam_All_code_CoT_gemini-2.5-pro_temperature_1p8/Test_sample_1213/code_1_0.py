    This function determines the killing moves for White in the given Go puzzle.

    The analysis shows that White has two primary ways to kill the Black group:
    1.  Playing at B1: This is a direct attack that forces Black into a losing position,
        resulting in a clean capture of the entire group.
    2.  Playing at B2: This is a clever throw-in play (tesuji) that forces a ko
        fight for the life of the group. In Go problems, initiating a ko that the
        defender must win to live is considered a successful kill sequence.

    Other moves are too slow and allow Black to connect at B2, which secures enough
    space for the group to live.
