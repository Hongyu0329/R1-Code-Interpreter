# This script calculates and prints the second critical exponent mentioned in the problem.
# The problem is about a decoupling inequality for the cone in R^3.
# The critical exponents are the points 'p' where the slope of the best constant alpha(p)
# as a function of 1/p changes.
# Based on the literature in harmonic analysis, these exponents are 4 and 10/3.
# As the problem provides 4, the other exponent is 10/3.

numerator = 10
denominator = 3

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final result.
# The result is the fraction 10/3.
