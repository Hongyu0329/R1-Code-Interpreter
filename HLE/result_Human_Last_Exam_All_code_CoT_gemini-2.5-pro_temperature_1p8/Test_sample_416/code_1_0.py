    # Step 1: Summarize the key clinical findings
    print("### Summary of Clinical Findings ###")
    print("Patient: 68 year old male with ankle pain and swelling.")
    print("Onset: Acute, after a long walk (minor trauma/overuse).")
    print("Signs: Erythema (redness), edema (swelling), pain on motion, mild bony tenderness.")
    print("Imaging: X-rays are repeatedly negative for any acute findings.")
    print("Labs: Elevated C-reactive protein (indicates inflammation) and slightly elevated uric acid.")
    print("Treatment Course: Failed treatment with indomethacin (NSAID) and symptoms worsened despite a prednisone (steroid) taper.")
    print("Definitive Test (Synovial Fluid): NO crystals, NO organisms, and NO white blood cells.\n")

    # Step 2: Evaluate each differential diagnosis
    print("### Evaluation of Potential Diagnoses ###\n")

    # A. Osteoarthritis
    print("--- A. Osteoarthritis ---")
    print("Analysis: This is typically a chronic, degenerative 'wear-and-tear' arthritis. While the patient's age is consistent, the acute, severe inflammatory signs (redness, significant swelling) and especially the lack of response to potent anti-inflammatories like prednisone make simple osteoarthritis unlikely.\n")

    # C. Septic Arthritis
    print("--- C. Septic Arthritis ---")
    print("Analysis: This is a bacterial infection of the joint. While it presents acutely with redness and swelling, the diagnosis is definitively ruled out by the synovial fluid analysis, which showed NO organisms and, crucially, NO white blood cells. A septic joint would be filled with white blood cells (pus).\n")

    # E. Pseudogout (or Gout)
    print("--- E. Pseudogout ---")
    print("Analysis: These are inflammatory conditions caused by crystals in the joint fluid. The acute presentation is classic, but the diagnosis is ruled out by the definitive synovial fluid analysis, which showed NO crystals. These conditions should also respond well to steroids, which this patient did not.\n")

    # D. Chronic osteomyelitis
    print("--- D. Chronic osteomyelitis ---")
    print("Analysis: This is a bone infection. While it can cause bony tenderness and persistent symptoms, the negative X-rays and acellular (no WBCs) joint fluid make a deep bone infection that is causing this level of joint inflammation less likely.\n")
    
    # B. Charcot Arthropathy
    print("--- B. Charcot Arthropathy ---")
    print("Analysis: This is a condition of rapid, destructive bone and joint damage that occurs in patients with neuropathy (loss of sensation).")
    print("  - It classically presents in its early stage (Eichenholtz Stage 0) as an acutely red, hot, swollen joint, often after minor or unnoticed trauma (the 'long walk').")
    print("  - X-rays are famously negative in this early inflammatory stage.")
    print("  - A hallmark feature is its failure to respond to standard anti-inflammatory treatments like NSAIDs and steroids.")
    print("  - This diagnosis perfectly fits the entire clinical picture: the presentation, the negative x-rays, and the critical detail of worsening symptoms despite prednisone treatment.\n")

    # Step 3: Final Conclusion
    print("### Conclusion ###")
    print("The combination of an acute, inflammatory, monoarticular process with negative X-rays, acellular/acrystalline joint fluid, and a failure to respond to potent anti-inflammatory therapy is classic for early-stage Charcot Arthropathy. This diagnosis best explains all the patient's findings.")
