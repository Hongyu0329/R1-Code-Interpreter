    "An elegant explanation of my method is presented below in the form of python comments. I will then print the final answer.\n\n```python\n#\n# Method Explanation\n#\n# The goal is to find the index of the given boundary-value problem (BVP).\n#\n# 1.  **Define the Index of a BVP**: For a linear BVP described by an operator L,\n#     the index is defined as: Index = p - q, where:\n#     -   `p = dim(ker(L))`: The dimension of the kernel of the operator. This is the\n#         number of linearly independent solutions to the homogeneous problem,\ne.g., `x'(t) - Ax(t) = 0` with the given boundary conditions.\n#     -   `q = dim(coker(L))`: The dimension of the cokernel of the operator. This\n#         is the number of solvability conditions that the non-homogeneous term\n#         `I(t)` must satisfy for a solution to the BVP to exist.\n#\n# 2.  **Analyze the System**:\n#     -   **Dimension (n)**: The boundary conditions involve the component `x_{2024}(t)`,\n#         which implies the system has at least 2024 components. The mention of\n#         `202000` appears to be a typo. We will proceed with a system dimension of `n = 2024`.\n#     -   **Boundary Conditions (BCs)**: The provided BCs are:\n#         1.  `x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0`\n#         2.  `x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0`\n#         3.  `5*x_2(T) - 5*x_2(0) = 0` (redundant with 2)\n#         4.  `100*x_2(T) - 100*x_2(0) = 0` (redundant with 2)\n#         5.  `1000*x_2(0) - 1000*x_2(T) = 0` (redundant with 2)\n#         6.  `100*x_{2024}(T) - 100*x_{2024}(0) = 0`\n#\n#         After removing redundant equations, we have 3 unique, linearly independent boundary conditions\n#         for components `i=1`, `i=2`, and `i=2024`. The number of independent conditions is `k = 3`.\n#\n# 3.  **Calculate p = dim(ker(L))**:\n#     -   We need to find the number of free parameters in the solution to the homogeneous equation `x'(t) = Ax(t)` that also satisfies the BCs.\n#     -   Since matrix A is diagonal, the system is decoupled: `x_i'(t) = -(1/R_i) * x_i(t)`.\n#     -   The solution is `x_i(t) = c_i * exp(-t/R_i)`, where `c_i = x_i(0)` is the initial condition.\n#     -   Applying the BCs for `i` in `{1, 2, 2024}`: `x_i(T) = x_i(0)`\n#         `c_i * exp(-T/R_i) = c_i`  => `c_i * (exp(-T/R_i) - 1) = 0`.\n#     -   Assuming generic non-zero `T` and finite non-zero `R_i`, the term `(exp(-T/R_i) - 1)` is non-zero.\n#     -   This forces the initial conditions `c_1`, `c_2`, and `c_{2024}` to be zero.\n#     -   For the other components `x_i(t)` where `i` is NOT in `{1, 2, 2024}`, there are no boundary conditions.\n#         Therefore, their initial conditions `c_i` can be chosen freely.\n#     -   The number of such unconstrained components is `n - k = 2024 - 3 = 2021`.\n#     -   Thus, the dimension of the solution space for the homogeneous problem is `p = 2021`.\n#\n# 4.  **Calculate q = dim(coker(L))**:\n#     -   We need to find the number of conditions on `I(t)` for the inhomogeneous problem `x'(t) - Ax(t) = I(t)` to have a solution.\n#     -   The solution to the `i`-th component equation is `x_i(t) = exp(-t/R_i)*x_i(0) + integral_term(I_i)`.\n#     -   Applying the BCs for `i` in `{1, 2, 2024}` gives an equation for `x_i(0)`:\n#         `x_i(0) * (1 - exp(-T/R_i)) = integral from 0 to T of exp(-(T-s)/R_i)*I_i(s) ds`.\n#     -   Since `(1 - exp(-T/R_i))` is non-zero, we can always find a unique `x_i(0)` for any continuous function `I_i(t)`.\n#     -   For the other components, the initial condition `x_i(0)` can be freely chosen (e.g., as 0).\n#     -   Therefore, a solution exists for ANY inhomogeneous term `I(t)`. There are no restrictions.\n#     -   The number of solvability conditions is `q = 0`.\n#\n# 5.  **Compute the Index**:\n#     -   Index = p - q\n\nn = 2024  # Dimension of the system\nk = 3     # Number of independent boundary conditions\n\n# p is the number of components without boundary conditions\np = n - k\n\n# q is the number of solvability conditions, which is 0\nq = 0\n\n# The index is p - q\nindex = p - q\n\nprint(f\"Dimension of the system (n) = {n}\")\nprint(f\"Number of independent boundary conditions (k) = {k}\")\nprint(f\"Dimension of the kernel (p) = n - k = {n} - {k} = {p}\")\nprint(f\"Dimension of the cokernel (q) = {q}\")\nprint(f\"Index of the problem = p - q = {p} - {q} = {index}\")\n\nprint(\"<<<2021>>>\")\n```"
