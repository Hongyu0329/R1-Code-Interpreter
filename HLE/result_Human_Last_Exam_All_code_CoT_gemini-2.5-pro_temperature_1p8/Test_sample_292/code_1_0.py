# Define the size of the vocabulary and the length of the sequence.
n = 99

# The problem asks to compute the sum S = sum_{w in V^n} (n + 1 - |U(w)|)^(-1),
# where n = |V| = 99 and w is a sequence of length n.
# Through mathematical derivation (using integral transforms and generating functions),
# this complex sum can be simplified to the elegant formula: S = (n + 1)^(n - 1).

# We will now use this formula to compute the final answer for n = 99.

# Calculate the base and exponent of the simplified formula.
base = n + 1
exponent = n - 1

# The equation for the sum is S = base^exponent.
# We print the values of the base and exponent.
print(f"The calculation is based on the simplified formula ({n}+1)^({n}-1).")
print(f"For n = {n}, this becomes:")
print(f"{base}^{exponent}")

# The result needs to be expressed as a power of 10.
# We know that the base = 100, which is 10^2.
# So, the expression becomes (10^2)^exponent.
# Using the power rule (a^b)^c = a^(b*c), this is 10^(2 * exponent).
final_power = 2 * exponent

# Print the final result in the requested format.
print(f"This is equal to (10^2)^{exponent} = 10^(2 * {exponent}) = 10^{final_power}.")
print(f"The final answer is expressed as: 10^{final_power}")
