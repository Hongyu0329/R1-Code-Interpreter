    This function symbolically computes the partial derivative D_x rho(alpha, beta).
    
    The problem setup leads to a system of implicit equations for the signed distance rho
    and the closest point's x-coordinate t, as functions of a point (x, y).

    System of equations:
    1) rho = t - x
    2) rho = y - t^5

    We differentiate this system with respect to x to find a linear system for the
    partial derivatives rho_x and t_x, and then solve it.
