  This function solves the mathematical problem regarding the number of homeomorphism classes.
  
  Based on the topological analysis:
  1. The space X must be a 1-dimensional manifold due to its properties (metric, locally compact, one-to-one continuous image of R, and locally connected).
  2. The only connected 1-manifolds are the real line (R) and the circle (S^1).
  3. A continuous bijection from R to S^1 cannot exist, so X cannot be homeomorphic to S^1.
  4. The real line R itself satisfies all the given properties.
  5. Therefore, any space X satisfying the conditions must be homeomorphic to R.
  
  This means there is only one such homeomorphism class.
