    "The task is to determine the number of independent components of the Riemann curvature tensor on a Kähler manifold. This is a problem in differential geometry. The number of components depends on the dimension of the manifold.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  A Kähler manifold is a special type of Riemannian manifold with a compatible complex structure. Its dimension is always even; let's denote the complex dimension by `m` (and the real dimension by `n=2m`).\n2.  The presence of the complex structure imposes additional symmetries on the Riemann curvature tensor, reducing the number of independent components compared to a general Riemannian manifold.\n3.  The set of all possible algebraic curvature tensors at a point on a Kähler manifold is determined by its holonomy group, which is a subgroup of the unitary group U(m).\n4.  Advanced results in differential geometry show that the space of these curvature tensors is isomorphic to the space of real symmetric bilinear forms on the Lie algebra of U(m), which is denoted $\\mathfrak{u}(m)$. The space of symmetric bilinear forms is written as $S^2(\\mathfrak{u}(m))$.\n5.  First, we need to find the dimension of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{u}(m)$. $\\mathfrak{u}(m)$ consists of the $m \\times m$ skew-Hermitian matrices. The real dimension of this space is $d = m^2$.\n6.  Next, we find the dimension of the space of symmetric bilinear forms on a real vector space of dimension $d$. The formula for this is $\\frac{d(d+1)}{2}$.\n7.  By substituting $d=m^2$ into the formula, we arrive at the final expression for the number of independent real components of the Riemann tensor: $\\frac{m^2(m^2+1)}{2}$.\n8.  I will write a Python script that takes the complex dimension `m` as input, calculates this number, and prints out the formula with the specific values plugged in.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_riemann_components_kahler():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor\n    on a Kähler manifold of a given complex dimension.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        m_str = input(\"Enter the complex dimension of the Kähler manifold (m): \")\n        m = int(m_str)\n        if m < 1:\n            print(\"Error: The complex dimension must be a positive integer.\", file=sys.stderr)\n            return\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Error: Please enter a valid integer for the dimension.\", file=sys.stderr)\n        return\n\n    # Step 1: The space of Kähler curvature tensors at a point is isomorphic\n    # to the space of symmetric bilinear forms on the Lie Algebra u(m), S^2(u(m)).\n    # We first need the dimension of u(m).\n    # dim(u(m)) = m^2\n    d = m**2\n\n    # Step 2: The dimension of the space of symmetric bilinear forms on a\n    # vector space of dimension d is d*(d+1)/2.\n    num_components = (d * (d + 1)) // 2\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Calculation Steps ---\")\n    print(f\"For a Kähler manifold of complex dimension m = {m}:\")\n    print(f\"1.
