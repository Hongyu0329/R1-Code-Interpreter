# 1. Determine the answer for each question based on the analysis.
# Question 1: How many lines have compiler errors?
# - Invalid type 'unsigned long long'.
# - Invalid format specifier '%d' in scanf.
# - Invalid format specifier '%d' in printf.
# Total errors = 3.
ans1 = 3

# Question 2: What is the total memory in D for variables in an optimized solution?
# - n (unsigned long): 12D
# - m (unsigned long): 12D
# - a (unsigned int): 6D
# Total memory = 12 + 12 + 6 = 30D.
ans2 = 30

# Question 3: Can the problem be solved without branching?
# Yes, using integer arithmetic for ceiling: (numerator + denominator - 1) / denominator.
ans3 = "Y"

# Question 4: What is the output for n = m = 4*10^9 and a = 1?
n = 4 * (10**9)
m = 4 * (10**9)
a = 1
# na = ceil(n/a) = n, since a=1
# ma = ceil(m/a) = m, since a=1
# result = n * m
ans4 = n * m

# 2. Format the answers into the specified string format "x:y:t:z".
# The prompt format "x:y:z where x, y, t, and z" is contradictory.
# I will assume it should be a four-part, colon-separated string.
final_answer_string = f"{ans1}:{ans2}:{ans3}:{ans4}"

# 3. Print the final result.
print(final_answer_string)
