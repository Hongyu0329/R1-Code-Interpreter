The patient's combination of short stature, ovarian dysgenesis, and cardiac symptoms,
despite a normal karyotype, strongly points to a diagnosis of Noonan Syndrome.
This syndrome results from a single-gene mutation.

The likely molecular abnormality is a mutation in a gene of the RAS/MAPK pathway,
most commonly the PTPN11 gene.
