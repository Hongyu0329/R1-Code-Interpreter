    Identifies and lists the San Francisco November 2024 propositions

    The competing pairs are:
    - Proposition C and Proposition D
    - Proposition H and Proposition I
    - Proposition N and Proposition O

    In each pair, if both propositions pass, the one with fewer 'yes' votes
    is nullified. Therefore, all propositions in these pairs could
    potentially be nullified.
