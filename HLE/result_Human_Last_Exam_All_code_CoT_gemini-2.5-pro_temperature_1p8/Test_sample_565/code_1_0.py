    Calculates the numbers n_j of isomorphism classes of vertex-transitive graphs

    The final answer is based on established results from graph theory census data

    # A graph is vertex-transitive if for any two vertices v1 and v2, there is
    # an automorphism of the graph that maps v1 to v2. A consequence is that
    # the graph must be regular (all vertices have the same degree).

    # The number of vertex-transitive graphs of degree j on n vertices (n_j)
    # is equal to the number of vertex-transitive graphs of degree (n-1-j).
    # For n=8, this means n_j = n_{7-j}.

    # For degree j=0, the only graph is the empty graph (8 isolated vertices),
    # which is vertex-transitive.

    # the only vertex-transitive configurations are a single 8-cycle (C8)

    # 5 connected cubic vertex-transitive graphs on 8 vertices.
