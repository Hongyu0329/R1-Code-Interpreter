    """
    Solves the Turing Machine state complexity limit problem.
    The solution is derived from logical deduction about the nature of the function f(k),
    rather than direct computation, which is infeasible.
    """

    # --- Step 1: Characterize the function f(k) ---
    # f(k) is the minimum number of states for a Turing Machine to recognize
    # strings where the count of '1's is divisible by k.
    # While a simple DFA simulation requires k states (f(k) <= k), a Turing Machine
    # can use its tape to be more efficient.
    # By writing the count of '1's in binary on the tape and hard-coding the value
    # of k into the states, the state complexity is reduced to f(k) = O(log k).
    # This means f(k) grows sub-linearly.

    # --- Step 2: Analyze the properties of the limit L ---
    # We are computing L = lim_{k->inf} [f(k+1) - f(k)].
    # Since f(k) must be an integer (number of states), the difference is always an integer.
    # A sequence of integers can only converge to an integer limit.
    # f(k) is non-decreasing, so f(k+1) - f(k) >= 0.
    # Therefore, L must be a non-negative integer.

    # --- Step 3: Prove the value of L by contradiction ---
    # Assume L >= 1. Since L is an integer, this means L is 1, 2, 3, ...
    # If the limit is L, then for sufficiently large k, we must have f(k+1) - f(k) = L.
    # This implies that f(k) grows linearly (i.e., f(k) is Omega(k)).
    # This contradicts our finding that f(k) = O(log k). The growth rate of f(k) is much
    # slower than linear.

    # --- Step 4: Conclude the result ---
    # The assumption that L >= 1 must be false. Since L must be a non-negative
    # integer, the only possible value is 0.

    final_answer = 0

    # The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
    # The difference f(k+1) - f(k) is 0 for most large k. For example, if we use the
    # model f(k) = C + floor(log2(k)), the value only changes when k is a power of two.
    # For any other k, the difference is 0. Let's represent a sample calculation for
    # a large k where the value of f(k) is stable.
    
    # Let's say for a large k (e.g., k=1000), f(1000) evaluates to some integer.
    # The number of bits in 1000 is 10. The number of bits in 1001 is also 10.
    # So, f(1001) is likely the same as f(1000). Let's represent this.
