    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Let the given quantity be $P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$. We want to find the number of integers $x$ for which $P(x)$ is a perfect square. Let $P(x) = y^2$ for some integer $y$.\n2.  For $P(x)$ to be a perfect square, it must be non-negative. We analyze the sign of $P(x)$ by finding its roots. The roots of $P(x)=0$ are approximately -6.18, 7.48, and 14.71. For $P(x) \\ge 0$, an integer $x$ must lie in the intervals $[-6, 7]$ or $[15, \\infty)$.\n3.  For large values of $x$, we can bound $P(x)$ between the squares of two expressions. It can be shown that for $x \\ge 145$, we have $(x-8)^2(x-1) < P(x) < x(x-8)^2$. Let $P(x) = y^2$. This implies $(x-8)^2(x-1) < y^2 < x(x-8)^2$. Dividing by the positive quantity $(x-8)^2$, we get $x-1 < (y/(x-8))^2 < x$. A square cannot lie strictly between two consecutive integers. Thus, there are no integer solutions for $x \\ge 145$.\n4.  This narrows our search to the finite integer ranges of $[-6, 7]$ and $[15, 144]$. Note that for $x=15$ and $x=16$, $P(x)$ is negative, so we only need to check the range $[17, 144]$.\n5.  We can now write a Python script to iterate through these ranges, calculate $P(x)$, and check if it is a perfect square. The script will count and display the solutions.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a number is a perfect square.\"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    if n == 0:\n        return True\n    root = int(math.sqrt(n))\n    return root * root == n\n\ndef solve_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of integers x for which x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056 is a perfect square.\n    \"\"\"\n    solutions = []\n    \n    # We check the ranges [-6, 7] and [17, 144] based on mathematical analysis.\n    ranges_to_check = list(range(-6, 8)) + list(range(17, 145))\n    \n    for x in ranges_to_check:\n        # Define the expression\n        val = x**3 - 16*x**2 - 72*x + 1056\n        if is_perfect_square(val):\n            solutions.append(x)\n            root = int(math.sqrt(val))\n            # Outputting each number in the final equation\n            # For negative numbers, we use parenthesis to make it clear.\n            if x < 0:\n                x_str = f\"({x})\"\n            else:\n                x_str = str(x)\n                \n            print(f\"For x = {x}, the expression is {x_str}^3 - 16*{x_str}^2 - 72*{x_str} + 1056 = {val} = {root}^2\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nIn total, there are {len(solutions)} integer values of x for which the expression is a perfect square.\")\n\nsolve_problem()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
