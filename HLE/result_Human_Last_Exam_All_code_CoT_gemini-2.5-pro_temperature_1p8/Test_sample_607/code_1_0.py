# The question asks whether it is possible for these algorithms to converge to a non-stationary point.
# Based on the analysis, only the Heavy-ball method has this potential due to its non-descent nature driven by the momentum term.
# Gradient Descent (1) and Doubly-Projected Gradient Descent (2) are descent-based methods (or variants thereof)
# whose limit points are guaranteed to be stationary under normal conditions.
#
# The heavy-ball method's potential for this pathological behavior makes it the correct choice.

ANSWER = "C"

print(f"Based on the analysis of the algorithms' properties, the correct choice is {ANSWER}.")
# There is no specific equation to solve or number to calculate as per the prompt's boilerplate example.
# The task is a conceptual analysis of algorithm behavior.
