# Plan:
# 1. State the formula for the steric-only second osmotic virial coefficient (B22) in the common units of mL/g.
# 2. Assume a typical value for the partial specific volume (v_bar) of a monoclonal antibody (mAb), as this was not provided in the problem description.
# 3. Calculate the result and print the final equation including all numerical values.

# The second osmotic virial coefficient from steric-only behavior (B22, steric),
# also known as the hard-sphere contribution, can be calculated based on the
# partial specific volume (v_bar) of the protein.

# For the coefficient expressed in units of mL/g, the standard formula is:
# B22, steric = 8 * v_bar

# A typical value for the partial specific volume of a monoclonal antibody is 0.73 mL/g.
# We will use this assumed value for the calculation. The information about the
# experimental conditions and the total measured B22 value (-7.585 mL/g) is
# not needed for calculating the theoretical steric-only contribution.

# Define the partial specific volume for a monoclonal antibody (in mL/g)
v_bar = 0.73

# Calculate the steric-only second osmotic virial coefficient
# The factor '8' comes from the hard-sphere model for particles in solution
# (B22_steric [mL/g] = 2 * A2_steric * M = 2 * (4*v_bar/M) * M = 8*v_bar).
b22_steric = 8 * v_bar

# Print the final equation with all numerical values.
