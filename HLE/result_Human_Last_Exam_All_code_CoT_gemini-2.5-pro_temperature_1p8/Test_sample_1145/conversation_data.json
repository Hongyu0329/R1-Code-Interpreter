    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding the particle within a specific interval in a 1D box. This probability is determined by integrating the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over that interval.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Recall the Wavefunction**: The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' is given by:\n    ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(n * π * x / a)\n\n2.  **Determine the Probability Density**: The probability density is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n    P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(n * π * x / a)\n\n3.  **Set up the Integral**: To find the probability in the interval from x₁ to x₂, we integrate the probability density function over this range:\n    P(x₁ ≤ x ≤ x₂) = ∫ [from x₁ to x₂] (2/a) * sin²(n * π * x / a) dx\n\n4.  **Substitute Given Values**:\n    *   Quantum number, n = 2\n    *   Lower limit of interval, x₁ = 0.495a\n    *   Upper limit of interval, x₂ = 0.505a\n\n5.  **Calculate the Integral**: The integral is complex to solve by hand. We will use Python's `scipy` library, which has a powerful numerical integration function (`quad`), to find the precise value. We can set `a=1` for the calculation since the probability is a dimensionless quantity and the box length 'a' will cancel out.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# 1. Define the parameters for the problem based on the user's request.\nn = 2  # The quantum number for the energy state.\na = 1.0  # We can set the box length 'a' to 1.0 for simplicity, as it cancels out.\nx1_ratio = 0.495 # The starting point of the interval as a fraction of 'a'.\nx2_ratio = 0.505 # The ending point of the interval as a fraction of 'a'.\nx1 = x1_ratio * a # The lower bound of the interval.\nx2 = x2_ratio * a # The upper bound of the interval.\n\n# 2. Define the probability density function, P(x) = |ψ(x)|².\n#    ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(n*pi*x/a)\n#    P(x) = (2/a) * sin^2(n*pi*x/a)\ndef probability_density(x, n_val, a_val):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function represents the probability density for a particle in a 1D box.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (2 / a_val) * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * x / a_val))**2\n\n# 3. Use numerical integration (scipy.integrate.quad) to find the probability.\n#    The quad function returns the integral result and an estimated error.\n#    We only need the first value, which is the result of the integration.\nprobability, error = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n, a))\n\n# 4. Print the final result, showing the parameters used in the calculation as requested.\nprint(f\"The equation to solve is the integral of the probability density function:\")\nprint(f\"P = Integral from {x1_ratio}a to {x2_ratio}a of (2/a) * sin^2({n}*pi*x/a) dx\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Calculation Result ---\")\nprint(f\"The probability of finding the particle in the state n = {n} between x = {x1_ratio}a and x = {x2_ratio}a is:\")\nprint(f\"{probability}\")\n```\n<<<6.579736417730947e-06>>>"
