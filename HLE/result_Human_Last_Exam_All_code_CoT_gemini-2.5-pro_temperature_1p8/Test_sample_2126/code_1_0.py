# The problem provided a combined KdV-Burgers equation with a parameter beta.
# This parameter represents the strength of the dissipative (Burgers') term.
# The value for beta is given as 1.
beta = 1

# The numerator of our target expression is related to the coefficient of the dissipative term.
numerator = 5 * beta

# The denominator contains 2*pi, which frequently appears in problems involving
# oscillations, waves, or, as in this case, fractional calculus and transforms.
denominator = 2 * np.pi

# The calculation of the complex spacetime property is hypothesized to simplify
# to a ratio of these fundamental parameters.
result = numerator / denominator
