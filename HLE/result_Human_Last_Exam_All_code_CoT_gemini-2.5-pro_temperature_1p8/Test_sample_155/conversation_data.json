    "To solve this puzzle, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Input:** The puzzle is presented in a `verbatim` block, which preserves spacing and line breaks. The structure consists of three full rows of 't' and 'b' characters, and two segments of vertical columns. This suggests five distinct pieces of information.\n2.  **Form a Hypothesis:** The request to \"output each number in the final equation\" is a strong clue. I hypothesize that the puzzle encodes a mathematical equation rather than a visual word. The most straightforward way to get numbers from the input is to count the occurrences of one of the characters, 't' or 'b'. I will count the number of 't's in each of the five data segments.\n3.  **Extract the Numbers:** I will count the 't's in each of the five strings in the order they appear in the `verbatim` block.\n    *   `t b b t t t t b b b`\n    *   The vertical segment `b, b, b, t, b`\n    *   `t b t t b b b b b b`\n    *   The vertical segment `b, b, t, t, b`\n    *   `b b t t t t b t b b`\n4.  **Find the Equation:** With the sequence of numbers extracted, I will search for a valid mathematical equation that uses these numbers in the given order. The simplest equations use basic operators like `+`, `-`, and `=`.\n5.  **Identify the Word:** The problem asks for a word. The result of the derived equation (e.g., 6) can be spelled out to form the word (e.g., \"SIX\").\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that implements these steps: count the 't's, and then print out the discovered equation and the final word which is the answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the puzzle:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the word puzzle by interpreting the 't' and 'b' characters\n    as an encoding for a mathematical equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The 5 data segments from the verbatim block\n    data_segments = [\n        \"t b b t t t t b b b\", # Row 1\n        \"b b b t b\",           # Column 1 segment\n        \"t b t t b b b b b b\", # Row 7\n        \"b b t t b\",           # Column 10 segment\n        \"b b t t t t b t b b\"  # Row 13\n    ]\n    \n    # Step 1: Count the number of 't's in each segment to get the numbers\n    numbers = [s.count('t') for s in data_segments]\n    \n    # Step 2: Find the unique equation these numbers form\n    # The numbers derived are [5, 1, 3, 2, 5]\n    # We look for an equation of the form: n1 op1 n2 = n3 op2 n4 op3 n5\n    # For the sequence 5, 1, 3, 2, 5, the unique solution is 5 + 1 = 3 - 2 + 5\n    \n    # Hardcoding the unique discovered equation\n    n1, n2, n3, n4, n5 = numbers\n    op1, op2, op3 = \"+\", \"-\", \"+\"\n    eq_str = f\"{n1} {op1} {n2} = {n3} {op2} {n4} {op3} {n5}\"\n    \n    # The result of the equation is 6 (5+1=6 and 3-2+5=6)\n    result = n1 + n2\n    \n    # The problem asks for a word, which is the result spelled out.\n    word_map = {\n        1: \"ONE\", 2: \"TWO\", 3: \"THREE\", 4: \"FOUR\", 5: \"FIVE\",\n        6: \"SIX\", 7: \"SEVEN\", 8: \"EIGHT\", 9: \"NINE\", 10: \"TEN\"\n    }\n    word_answer = word_map.get(result, \"UNKNOWN\")\n    \n    print(\"The numbers derived from the puzzle are:\", ', '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n    print(\"The equation is:\")\n    print(eq_str)\n    print(\"The result of the equation is:\", result)\n    print(\"The encoded word is the result spelled out.\")\n\nsolve_puzzle()\n\n# The final answer based on the puzzle's result\nprint(\"\\n<<<SIX>>>\")\n```"
