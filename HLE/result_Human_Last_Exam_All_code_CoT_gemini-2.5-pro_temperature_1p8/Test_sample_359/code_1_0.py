    # --- Analysis ---
    # In King of the Hill chess, a player wins by checkmate or by moving their king
    # to one of the four central squares: d4, e4, d5, or e5.

    # 1. White's Position: The White King on e3 is just one step away from the center.
    #    However, the central squares d4 and e4 are currently blocked by White's own pawns.

    # 2. The Winning Plan: White's most direct path to victory is to vacate one of the
    #    central squares and then move the King onto it.

    # 3. The Key Move: The move `dxc5` (White's d-pawn captures Black's b-pawn) is decisive.
    #    This move vacates the crucial d4 square.

    # --- The Move Sequence ---

    # Move 1 (White): dxc5
    # After White plays `dxc5`, the board state changes. The d4 square is now empty.
    # It is now Black's turn to move.

    # Move 1 (Black): ... (Any move)
    # Black has no way to stop White's plan. The Black Knight on f6 cannot attack d4,
    # and the Black King on c7 is too far away. Black can make any move,
    # for example ...h4, but it won't prevent White's next move.

    # Move 2 (White): Kd4
    # White moves the King from e3 to d4. Since d4 is a central square, White
    # immediately wins the game.

    num_moves = 2
    move1 = "dxc5"
    move2 = "Kd4"
