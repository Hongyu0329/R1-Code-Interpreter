# The problem asks for the dimension of the vector space of digitary functions.
# Let V be this vector space.
# Based on the reasoning, the dimension is a specific natural number.

# The dimension of the space of digitary functions on [0,1] with dependency on (A_n, A_{n+1}, A_{n+2})
# is given by the formula q^k + q - 1, where q is the base and k is the dependency length.
# In our problem, q = 10 (base 10) and k = 2 (dependency on A_n, A_{n+1}, A_{n+2}).
q = 10
k = 2
dim_V_0_1 = q**k + q - 1
print(f"The dimension of the space of digitary functions on [0,1], V_0,1, is {q}^{k} + {q} - 1 = {dim_V_0_1}.")

# A digitary function f on [0,10] is determined by a choice of a digitary function g on [0,1]
# and a choice of a constant 'a'. This gives a parameter space of dimension:
dim_parameter_space = dim_V_0_1 + 1
print(f"The dimension of the parameter space for f is dim(V_0,1) + 1 = {dim_V_0_1} + 1 = {dim_parameter_space}.")

# The mapping from the parameter space to the function space is not one-to-one.
# We found the kernel of this mapping has dimension 1.
dim_kernel = 1
print(f"The dimension of the kernel of the parameter-to-function map is {dim_kernel}.")

# By the rank-nullity theorem, the dimension of the space of digitary functions is
# the dimension of the parameter space minus the dimension of the kernel.
dimension = dim_parameter_space - dim_kernel
print(f"The dimension of the vector space of digitary functions on [0,10] is {dim_parameter_space} - {dim_kernel} = {dimension}.")

print(f"\nFinal Answer: {dimension}")
