    This function presents the solution to the theoretical problem posed by the user.
    The problem asks for an asymptotic ratio of certain sets of points on an algebraic curve.

    The solution is a theoretical result from arithmetic geometry.
    The ratio approaches 1 divided by the order of the Galois group G,
    where G = Gal(k(C)/k(P^1)) is the monodromy group of the cover
    associated with the linear system g^r_d.
