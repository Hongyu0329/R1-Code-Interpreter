    "To determine the number of involutions in the group PSU(4, 997), we will follow a plan based on the structure of this finite simple group.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand Involutions in a Quotient Group:** The group PSU(4, 997) is a quotient group `SU(4, 997) / Z`, where `Z` is the center of `SU(4, 997)`. An involution in the quotient group is an element `gZ` (where `g` is in `SU(4, 997)` but not in `Z`) such that its square `(gZ)^2` is the identity element. This implies `g^2` must be in the center `Z`.\n\n2.  **Characterize the Center:** The center `Z` of `SU(n, q)` has an order of `d = gcd(n, q+1)`. For our case, `n=4` and `q=997`. So, `d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`. This means the center `Z` is `{I, -I}`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n\n3.  **Count the Preimages:** We need to find the number of elements `g` in `SU(4, 997)` such that `g^2 \\in \\{I, -I\\}` and `g \\notin \\{I, -I\\}`. This total is then divided by `|Z|=2` to get the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n    *   **Case 1: `g^2 = -I`**: For the specific case where `q = 997`, since `997 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`, it can be shown that there are no elements `g` in the unitary group `U(4, 997)` (and thus in `SU(4, 997)`) such that `g^2 = -I`. So, this case contributes 0 elements.\n    *   **Case 2: `g^2 = I`**: These are the elements of order 1 or 2 in `SU(4, 997)`. They are the identity `I`, the central element `-I`, and a single conjugacy class of non-central involutions. The size of this conjugacy class has been determined in the theory of finite groups.\n\n4.  **Apply the Formula:** The number of non-central involutions in `SU(4, q)` is given by the formula `q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)`. The number of involutions in `PSU(4, q)` is this quantity divided by 2 (the order of the center).\n\n5.  **Calculation:** We will write a Python script to calculate the value using the formula with `q=997`. The final formula is:\n    Number of involutions = `(q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)) / 2`\n\nNow, let's execute the calculation.\n\n```python\n# The value of q for PSU(4, q)\nq = 997\n\n# Calculate the terms of the formula\nq_pow_4 = q**4\nq_sq_plus_1 = q**2 + 1\nq_sq_minus_q_plus_1 = q**2 - q + 1\n\n# Calculate the numerator of the formula, which is the number of\n# non-central involutions in SU(4, q)\nnumerator = q_pow_4 * q_sq_plus_1 * q_sq_minus_q_plus_1\n\n# The number of involutions in PSU(4, q) is the numerator divided by 2\nnum_involutions = numerator // 2\n\n# Print the final equation with the computed result.\nprint(f\"Number of involutions = ({q}^4 * ({q}^2 + 1) * ({q}^2 - {q} + 1)) / 2\")\nprint(f\"= ({q_pow_4} * {q_sq_plus_1} * {q_sq_minus_q_plus_1}) / 2\")\nprint(f\"= {num_involutions}\")\n```\n\n<<<487570417937415112675665>>>"
