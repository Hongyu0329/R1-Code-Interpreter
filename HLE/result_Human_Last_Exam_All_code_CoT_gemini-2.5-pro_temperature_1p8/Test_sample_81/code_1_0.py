def solve_contract_puzzle():
    """
    This function identifies the most problematic contract term and represents the answer with an equation.

    Analysis:
    All options are from 'contracts of adhesion'. The key is to find the one that
    violates 'reasonable expectations' by hiding a material term.
    Option E contains a long list of prohibitions, including a very unusual and
    specific clause: "(vi) research or identify any individuals known to be residing in
    the State of Illinois, U.S.A."
    This is not a standard term, and a user would not reasonably expect to find it
    buried in a long list of boilerplate. This makes it a "hidden material term".

    To select this answer, we'll use an equation where the result corresponds to the
    letter 'E', which is the 5th position in the alphabet.
    """

    # We select E, the 5th option.
    # We will represent this with a simple equation.
    num1 = 3
    num2 = 2
    result_index = num1 + num2 # This will be 5

    # Convert the index to the corresponding letter (A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5)
    # The ASCII value of 'A' is 65. So, 'A' is 65 + 1 - 1, 'B' is 65 + 2 - 1, etc.
    final_answer_letter = chr(ord('A') + result_index - 1)

    print(f"The equation to identify the correct option is: {num1} + {num2} = {result_index}")
    print(f"The result {result_index} corresponds to the correct option, which is Option {final_answer_letter}.")
    print(f"\nExplanation: Option {final_answer_letter} is the most likely answer because it contains a highly specific and unexpected restriction (regarding Illinois residents) buried in a long list of standard terms, making it a hidden material term that violates the doctrine of reasonable expectations.")
