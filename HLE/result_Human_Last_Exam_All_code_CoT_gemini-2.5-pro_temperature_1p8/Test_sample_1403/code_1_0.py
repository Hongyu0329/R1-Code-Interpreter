    This script solves the hat puzzle by calculating the guaranteed number of correct
    guesses in two different scenarios and finding the difference.
    """

    # --- Scenario 1: Simultaneous Guessing ---
    # In this scenario, 9 individuals guess at the same time.
    # The optimal strategy is to divide the group into two teams based on parity.
    # To maximize the *guaranteed* number of correct people, the teams should be
    # as close in size as possible. For 9 people, the sizes are 4 and 5.
    # The number of guaranteed correct guesses (N) is the size of the smaller team.
    N = 9 // 2

    # --- Scenario 2: One Person Guesses First ---
    # In this scenario, one person guesses first, signaling information to the rest.
    # The first person signals the parity of the other 8 hats.
    # This allows the other 8 people to deduce their own hat color with certainty.
    # The signaler's guess is not guaranteed to be correct.
    # The number of guaranteed correct guesses (M) is the number of people who hear the signal.
    M = 9 - 1

    # --- Calculation ---
    # The problem asks for the difference, M - N.
    difference = M - N

    # --- Output the result ---
