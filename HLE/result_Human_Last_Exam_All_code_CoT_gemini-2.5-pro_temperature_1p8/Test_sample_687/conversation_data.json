    "To find a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles of a knot, we can use a property of its HOMFLY polynomial, denoted $P_K(a, z)$. The specific property is the span of the polynomial in the variable 'a', which is the difference between the maximum and minimum powers of 'a' in the polynomial.\n\nThe Morton-Franks-Williams inequality provides the relationship we need:\n$s_{min}(K) \\geq \\frac{\\text{span}_a(P_K)}{2} + 1$\nwhere $s_{min}(K)$ is the minimum number of Seifert circles of the knot $K$.\n\nMy plan is to execute a Python script that:\n1.  Identifies the knot $9_{23}$.\n2.  Computes its HOMFLY polynomial using the `spherogram` library.\n3.  Determines the minimum and maximum powers of the variable 'a' in the polynomial.\n4.  Calculates the span in 'a'.\n5.  Applies the inequality to find the lower bound for the number of Seifert circles.\n6.  Prints out all the steps and the final calculation.\n\nThis script requires the `spherogram` library. You can install it by running: `pip install spherogram`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n# The following code requires the 'spherogram' library.\n# If you don't have it, please install it using: pip install spherogram\ntry:\n    import spherogram\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Error: The 'spherogram' library is required to run this code.\")\n    print(\"Please install it by running: pip install spherogram\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\ndef solve_seifert_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles for a given knot\n    using its HOMFLY polynomial.\n    \"\"\"\n    knot_name = '9_23'\n    try:\n        knot = spherogram.Knot(knot_name)\n    except KeyError:\n        print(f\"Error: Knot '{knot_name}' not found in the spherogram database.\")\n        return\n\n    # 1.
