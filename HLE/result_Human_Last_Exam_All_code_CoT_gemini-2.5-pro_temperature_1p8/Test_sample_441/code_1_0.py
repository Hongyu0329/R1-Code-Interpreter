# Step 1: Define the indices for the deferent and epicycle terms based on the symmetry argument.
# The dominant term (deferent) corresponds to n=1.
# The next dominant term (epicycle) corresponds to n=-3.
n_deferent = 1
n_epicycle = -3

# Step 2: Calculate R, the ratio of the radii.
# The radius of the deferent is proportional to |c_1|, and the radius of the epicycle is proportional to |c_-3|.
# A detailed derivation shows that |c_n| is proportional to 1/(n^2).
# Therefore, R = |c_1|/|c_-3| = (1/(n_deferent^2)) / (1/(n_epicycle^2)) = n_epicycle^2 / n_deferent^2.
R_numerator = n_epicycle**2
R_denominator = n_deferent**2
R = R_numerator / R_denominator

# Step 3: Calculate phi, the ratio of the frequencies.
# The frequency of the deferent is n_deferent * Ω and the frequency of the epicycle is n_epicycle * Ω.
# The fundamental frequency Ω cancels out in the ratio.
phi = n_epicycle / n_deferent

# Step 4: Print the reasoning and the result.
