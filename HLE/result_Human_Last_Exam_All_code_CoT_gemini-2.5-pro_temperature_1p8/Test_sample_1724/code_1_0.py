    This function calculates the third term of the nonlinear frequency correction
    for the Rayleigh-Plesset equation using the Poincaré-Lindstedt method.
    
    The steps are outlined based on the perturbation analysis:
    1. The analysis up to the third order (ε³) is performed.
    2. The secular terms at order ε³ give an equation for the frequency correction ω₂.
    3. This equation relates ω₂ to a polynomial in the polytropic index γ.
    4. The problem is interpreted as finding the third term of this polynomial.
