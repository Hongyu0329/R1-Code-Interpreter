# This script calculates the firm's profit or loss based on the provided areas.

# --- Step 1: Define variables with example values ---
# We are given the condition P = MC < AVC < ATC.
# Let's choose some numerical values that satisfy this.
q_1 = 20  # Output quantity
P = 10    # Market Price (and Marginal Cost, since P=MC)
AVC = 12  # Average Variable Cost
ATC = 15  # Average Total Cost

print(f"Let's use the following example values satisfying P < AVC < ATC:")
print(f"Output Quantity (q_1) = {q_1}")
print(f"Price (P) = {P}")
print(f"Average Variable Cost (AVC) = {AVC}")
print(f"Average Total Cost (ATC) = {ATC}")
print("-" * 50)

# --- Step 2: Relate economic concepts to the defined areas S and H ---
# The fundamental formula for profit is:
# Profit/Loss = Total Revenue (TR) - Total Cost (TC)

# From the problem description:
# Total Revenue (TR) = Price * Quantity = P * q_1
# This corresponds to the area of rectangle S.
S = P * q_1

# Total Cost (TC) = Average Total Cost * Quantity = ATC * q_1
# This corresponds to the area of rectangle H.
H = ATC * q_1

print("Calculating Total Revenue and Total Cost:")
print(f"Total Revenue (TR) is represented by Area S.")
print(f"S = P * q_1 = {P} * {q_1} = {S}")

print(f"\nTotal Cost (TC) is represented by Area H.")
print(f"H = ATC * q_1 = {ATC} * {q_1} = {H}")
print("-" * 50)


# --- Step 3: Formulate and calculate the profit/loss ---
# Substitute S for TR and H for TC in the profit formula.
# Profit/Loss = S - H
profit_loss = S - H

print("The area representing the firm's profit or loss is found by the formula:")
print("Profit/Loss = Total Revenue - Total Cost")
print("\nIn terms of the given areas, this is:")
print("Profit/Loss = S - H")
print("\nUsing our example values, the final equation is:")
# The final result is printed in the required format showing each number.
sys.stdout.write(f"Profit/Loss = S - H = {S} - {H} = {profit_loss}\n")

# Since the result is negative, the firm is experiencing a loss, as expected
# because the price (P) is below the average total cost (ATC).
if profit_loss < 0:
    print(f"The result {profit_loss} confirms the firm is making a loss.")
