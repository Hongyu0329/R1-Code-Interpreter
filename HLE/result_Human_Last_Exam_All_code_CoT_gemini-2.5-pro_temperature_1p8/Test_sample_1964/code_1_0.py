    This function outlines the reasoning to determine the order type of Y \ (ω ∪ {ω}).

    Step 1: Analyze the set Y \ (ω ∪ {ω}).
    This set consists of all uncountable cardinals κ such that a Δ-system of size κ
    with a finite root can be found within a specially constructed sequence of sets.

    Step 2: Determine the possible values for uncountable cardinals in Y.
    A cardinal κ in Y corresponds to the size of a set X, where X is a subset of ω₁.
    Therefore, any such cardinal κ must be less than or equal to ω₁, the first uncountable cardinal.
    The only uncountable cardinal satisfying κ ≤ ω₁ is ω₁ itself.
    So, Y \ (ω ∪ {ω}) can be at most {ω₁}.

    Step 3: Prove that ω₁ is an element of Y.
    This requires constructing a sequence A = <a_α : α < ω₁> which is guaranteed to
    contain a Δ-subsystem of size ω₁ with a finite root. Such a construction is possible
    using standard tools from combinatorial set theory (e.g., almost disjoint families and
    the Erdos-Rado theorem ω₁ -> (ω₁)²_ω).
    This confirms that Y \ (ω ∪ {ω}) = {ω₁}.

    Step 4: Find the order type of the resulting set.
    The set Y \ (ω ∪ {ω}) is {ω₁}, which is a singleton set (a set with one element).
    Any singleton set has a trivial well-ordering.

    Step 5: State the final conclusion.
    The order type of a set with one element is 1.
