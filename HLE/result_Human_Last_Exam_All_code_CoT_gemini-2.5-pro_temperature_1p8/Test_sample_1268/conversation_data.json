    "Based on the terminology provided, the question likely refers to the relationship between a squarefree number $N$, the covolume of the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$, and its maximum cusp width. Here is a step-by-step plan to derive the relationship and create the corresponding Python script.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the Group and Covolume:** The problem is best interpreted in the context of the modular congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$. The covolume $(V)$ of the corresponding quotient space $\\Gamma_0(N) \\backslash \\mathbb{H}^2$ (a measure of its \"size\") is given by the formula:\n    $V = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\prod_{p|N} (p+1)$\n    where the product is over the prime factors of the squarefree number $N$.\n\n2.  **Interpret the \"Maximum Norm\" $(k_{k,\\infty})$:** The notation is non-standard. A plausible interpretation, suggested by the $\\infty$ subscript, is that it refers to the maximum width of the cusps of $\\Gamma_0(N)$. The widest cusp is the one at infinity, and its width is exactly $N$. We will proceed with the assumption that $k_{k,\\infty} = N$.\n\n3.  **Derive the Upper Bound:** We want to find an upper bound for $N$ in terms of $V$.\n    *   From the covolume formula, we can write: $\\frac{3V}{\\pi} = \\prod_{p|N} (p+1)$.\n    *   For any prime $p$, we know that $p+1 > p$.\n    *   Therefore, the product of these terms is also greater: $\\prod_{p|N} (p+1) > \\prod_{p|N} p$.\n    *   Since $N$ is squarefree, $\\prod_{p|N} p = N$.\n    *   Combining these, we get the inequality: $\\frac{3V}{\\pi} > N$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The value $N$ (interpreted as $k_{k,\\infty}$) is strictly less than $\\frac{3V}{\\pi}$. Thus, $\\frac{3V}{\\pi}$ serves as an upper bound for $N$.\n\n5.  **Python Script:** The script will take a squarefree number $N$, calculate its covolume $V$, and then demonstrate the inequality by printing out each component of the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the unique prime factors of a given integer n.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = set()\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        if temp % d == 0:\n            factors.add(d)\n            while temp % d == 0:\n                temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors.add(temp)\n    return list(factors)\n\ndef solve_for_bound(N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the covolume V and the upper bound for N, then prints the relationship.\n    \n    Args:\n    N (int): A squarefree natural number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Verify if N is squarefree\n    for p in get_prime_factors(N):\n        if N % (p*p) == 0:\n            print(f\"Error: The number N={N} is not squarefree.\")\n            return\n\n    # Calculate the covolume V for Gamma_0(N)\n    # V = (pi/3) * product_{p|N} (p+1)\n    prime_factors = get_prime_factors(N)\n    prod_p_plus_1 = 1\n    for p in prime_factors:\n        prod_p_plus_1 *= (p + 1)\n    \n    V = (math.pi / 3) * prod_p_plus_1\n\n    # Based on the derivation, the relationship is N < 3V/pi.\n    # The upper bound for N is 3V/pi.\n    upper_bound = (3 * V) / math.pi\n    \n    # We interpret k_{k,inf} as N\n    k_k_inf = N\n\n    # Output the result as an equation with all numbers, as requested.\n    print(f\"For the squarefree number N = {N}:\")\n    print(f\"The covolume is V = {V}\")\n    print(\"\\nAssuming k_{k,inf} represents the maximum cusp width, which is N,\")\n    print(\"the derived relationship is: k_{k,inf} < 3*V/pi\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nPlugging in the values, the final equation is:\")\n    # We use k_k_inf instead of N in the final print to match the user's notation.\n    print(f\"{k_k_inf} < (3 * {V} / {math.pi})\")\n    print(f\"{k_k_inf} < {upper_bound}\")\n\n\n# --- User Execution Area ---\n# You can change the value of N to any squarefree natural number.\n# Examples of squarefree numbers: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30, 105, ...\n# Example where N is the product of two primes\nsquarefree_N = 2 * 3 * 5 # 30\n\nsolve_for_bound(squarefree_N)\n<<<3*V/pi>>>\n```"
