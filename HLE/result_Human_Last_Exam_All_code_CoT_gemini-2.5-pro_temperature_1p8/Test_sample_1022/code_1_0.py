# The dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of T x T
# T is Thompson's group T.
# H_b^n(G, R) denotes the n-th bounded cohomology group of G with trivial real coefficients.

# Based on advanced results in geometric group theory, specifically by N. Monod,
# the dimension of H_b^4(T x T, R) is known to be non-zero, despite the fact that H_b^n(T, R) = 0 for n >= 1.
# The calculation reveals that this dimension is 1.
