    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step reasoning followed by the final Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Establish the Formula:** The primary tool is the formula that connects the rank of the Néron-Severi group of a symmetric power of a curve, `X = C^(d)`, to the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the curve's Jacobian, `Jac(C)`. The rank of the Néron-Severi group is also known as the Picard number, `ρ`.\n2.  **Find the Smallest Rank:** The smallest possible rank for `ρ(X)` corresponds to the smallest possible rank for `ρ(Jac(C))`. This occurs for a \"generic\" genus 3 curve.\n3.  **Find the Largest Rank:** The largest possible rank for `ρ(X)` corresponds to the largest possible rank for `ρ(Jac(C))`. This occurs for a very special \"non-generic\" curve, typically one with Complex Multiplication (CM) and a decomposable Jacobian.\n4.  **Synthesize and Code:** Combine these findings into a Python script that explains the steps and prints the final answer, including the calculations.\n\n### Execution:\n\nThe formula for the Picard number of the d-th symmetric power of a curve `C` is given by MacDonald's formula:\n`ρ(C^(d)) = 1 + ρ(Jac(C))`\n\nOur task is to find the minimum and maximum values of `ρ(Jac(C))` where `C` is a genus 3 curve.\n\n*   **Smallest Rank:**\n    For a generic curve `C` of genus 3, its Jacobian `Jac(C)` is a simple abelian variety whose endomorphism ring is as small as possible, `End(Jac(C)) = Z`. In this case, its Néron-Severi group `NS(Jac(C))` is of rank 1, generated by the canonical principal polarization (the theta-divisor class).\n    Thus, `ρ_min(Jac(C)) = 1`.\n\n*   **Largest Rank:**\n    The rank `ρ(Jac(C))` is maximized for curves `C` with complex multiplication, where the Jacobian decomposes. The theoretical maximum is achieved when `Jac(C)` is isogenous to a product of `g` elliptic curves with CM, i.e., `Jac(C) ~ E^3`. An example of such a curve is the Fermat quartic `x^4 + y^4 = z^4`, a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian is isogenous to `E^3` where `E` is an elliptic curve with CM by `Z[i]`. The Picard number of `E^3` is the maximum possible for a 3-dimensional abelian variety, which is equal to its Hodge number `h^(1,1) = g^2 = 3^2 = 9`.\n    Thus, `ρ_max(Jac(C)) = 9`.\n\nNow we can compute the smallest and largest ranks for `X = C^(15)`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the smallest and largest possible ranks of the\n    Neron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    g = 3\n    d = 15\n\n    print(\"Let C be a Riemann surface (smooth projective curve) of genus g, and let X = C^(d) be its d-th symmetric power.\")\n    print(\"The rank of the Neron-Severi group of X, denoted ρ(X), is related to the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of C, ρ(Jac(C)).\")\n    print(\"The formula is: ρ(C^(d)) = 1 + ρ(Jac(C)).\")\n    print(\"\")\n    print(f\"In this problem, the genus g = {g} and the symmetric power d = {d}.\")\n    print(\"To find the bounds for ρ(X), we must find the smallest and largest possible values for ρ(Jac(C)) for a genus 3 curve.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # --- Smallest Rank ---\n    print(\"Part 1: Finding the Smallest Rank\")\n    print(\"The smallest rank occurs for a 'generic' curve C.
