# The problem simplifies to calculating the value of the expression 28 * ln(2).
# As derived in the steps above, the complex integral formula for l(14) simplifies to:
# l(14) = 2 * ln(2^14)
# which is equivalent to 2 * 14 * ln(2) = 28 * ln(2).

# Define the coefficients of the final equation
coefficient = 28
log_value = math.log(2)

# Calculate the final result
result = coefficient * log_value

# Output the components of the final equation and the result
print(f"The final expression is of the form: c * ln(2)")
print(f"The value of c is: {coefficient}")
print(f"The value of ln(2) is: {log_value}")
print(f"The final result is {coefficient} * {log_value} = {result}")

# The final numeric value
print(f"l(14) = {result}")
