    explanation = """
Magnesium helps lower blood pressure primarily through direct vasodilation. Here is a breakdown of the reasoning:

1.  **Magnesium as a Calcium Antagonist:** Magnesium acts as a natural calcium channel blocker. It competes with calcium ions to bind to smooth muscle cells in the walls of blood vessels.
2.  **Muscle Relaxation:** The entry of calcium into these cells causes them to contract, narrowing the blood vessels (vasoconstriction) and increasing blood pressure. By blocking calcium's entry, magnesium promotes relaxation of these muscle cells.
3.  **Vasodilation:** This relaxation leads to the widening of blood vessels, a process called vasodilation.
4.  **Reduced Blood Pressure:** Wider blood vessels mean less resistance to blood flow, which in turn lowers overall systemic blood pressure.

Therefore, the correct mechanism among the choices is direct vasodilation.
