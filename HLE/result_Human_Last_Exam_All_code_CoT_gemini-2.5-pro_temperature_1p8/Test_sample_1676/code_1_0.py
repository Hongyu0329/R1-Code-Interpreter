    # Starting Material
    print("\nInitial Reactant: Terpinolene")
    print("Molecular Formula: C10H16")
    print("Description: Terpinolene, or 1-methyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclohex-1-ene, has two double bonds: one endocyclic (within the ring) and one exocyclic.")
    
    # Step 1: Epoxidation
    print("\n--- Step 1: Terpinolene + m-CPBA ---> Compound 1 ---")
    print("The reagent m-CPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid) is used for epoxidation.")
    print("The more electron-rich, tetrasubstituted endocyclic double bond is more reactive than the exocyclic double bond.")
    print("m-CPBA selectively adds an oxygen atom across the endocyclic double bond.")
    print("\nCompound 1 is the epoxide of terpinolene.")
    print("Systematic Name: 1-methyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane")
    print("Reaction Summary: C10H16 + [O] ---> C10H16O")

    # Step 2: Thiirane formation
    print("\n--- Step 2: Compound 1 + N,N-dimethylthioformamide ---> Compound 2 ---")
    print("This reaction, catalyzed by trifluoroacetic acid, converts an epoxide to a thiirane (episulfide).")
    print("The sulfur atom from N,N-dimethylthioformamide replaces the oxygen atom of the epoxide ring.")

    print("Reaction Summary: C10H16O ---> C10H16S")
    
    # Step 3: Reduction
    print("\n--- Step 3: Compound 2 + LiAlH4 ---> Compound 3 ---")
    print("The reagent LiAlH4 (Lithium aluminum hydride) is a strong reducing agent that opens the thiirane ring.")
    print("This is a reductive opening, where the C-S bond is broken and hydrogen atoms are added.")
    print("The reaction breaks the three-membered sulfur ring to form a thiol (-SH).")

    # Final Conclusion
