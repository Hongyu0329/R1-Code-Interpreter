    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  I will first analyze the parametric equations for the curve to determine its overall shape and extent. The curve is defined in two pieces, so I'll analyze each piece separately.\n    *   For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, we have $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = \\sin(t)$. This is the upper half of a unit circle.\n    *   For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, we have $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = 5\\sin(t)$. This is the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin with a horizontal semi-axis of 1 and a vertical semi-axis of 5.\n2.  Next, I'll find the minimum and maximum values for the x and y coordinates over the entire curve. This will define the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that encloses the figure.\n    *   The range of $x = \\cos(t)$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ is $[-1, 1]$.\n    *   The range of $y$ is the union of the y-ranges from the two pieces: $[0, 1]$ for the first part and $[-5, 0)$ for the second part. The combined range for y is $[-5, 1]$.\n3.  The side length of the smallest square that can enclose this bounding box must be equal to the larger of its width and height.\n    *   Width of bounding box = $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n    *   Height of bounding box = $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n4.  The side of the square will be $\\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n5.  Finally, I'll calculate the area of this square by squaring its side length. The Python script below will perform these calculations and print out the steps.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the ranges for x and y based on the parametric equations.\n\n# For x = cos(t), the range over t in [0, 2*pi) is [-1, 1].\nx_min = -1\nx_max = 1\n\n# For y = b*sin(t):\n# When t is in [0, pi], b=1, so y = sin(t) ranges from 0 to 1.\n# When t is in (pi, 2*pi), b=5, so y = 5*sin(t) ranges from -5 to 0.\n# The combined range for y is therefore [-5, 1].\ny_min = -5\ny_max = 1\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the dimensions of the bounding box.\nwidth = x_max - x_min\nheight = y_max - y_min\n\nprint(f\"The overall range for x is [{x_min}, {x_max}].\")\nprint(f\"The overall range for y is [{y_min}, {y_max}].\")\nprint(f\"The width of the bounding box for the figure is {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}.\")\nprint(f\"The height of the bounding box for the figure is {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}.\")\n\n# Step 3: Determine the side length of the smallest enclosing square.\n# The side length must be the maximum of the width and height.\nside_length = max(width, height)\nprint(f\"\\nThe side of the smallest square that outcircles the figure is the maximum of its width and height.\")\nprint(f\"Side length = max({width}, {height}) = {side_length}.\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.\narea = side_length ** 2\nprint(f\"\\nThe area of the square is the side length squared.\")\nprint(f\"Area = {side_length} * {side_length} = {area}\")\n\n```\n<<<36>>>"
