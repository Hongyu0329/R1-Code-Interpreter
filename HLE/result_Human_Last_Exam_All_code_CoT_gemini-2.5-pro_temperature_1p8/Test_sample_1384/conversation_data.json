    "To find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$, we need to determine the value of its mantissa in scientific notation.\n\nLet the number be $N = e^{-7^{13}}$.\nWe can express $N$ in base 10 to understand its decimal representation:\n$N = 10^{\\log_{10}(N)}$\n\nThe exponent is $\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}})$. Using logarithm properties, this becomes:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = -7^{13} \\cdot \\log_{10}(e)$\n\nLet's calculate the value of this exponent. Let $y = 7^{13} \\cdot \\log_{10}(e)$. The exponent of $N$ is then $-y$.\n$N = 10^{-y}$\n\nAny positive number $y$ can be written as the sum of its integer part $\\lfloor y \\rfloor$ and its fractional part $\\{y\\}$, where $0 \\le \\{y\\} < 1$.\nSo, $y = \\lfloor y \\rfloor + \\{y\\}$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $N$:\n$N = 10^{-(\\lfloor y \\rfloor + \\{y\\})} = 10^{-\\lfloor y \\rfloor - \\{y\\}}$\nWe can rewrite this as:\n$N = 10^{-(\\lfloor y \\rfloor + 1)} \\cdot 10^{(1 - \\{y\\})}$\n\nHere, the term $10^{-(\\lfloor y \\rfloor + 1)}$ sets the position of the decimal point. It tells us that the number starts with $\\lfloor y \\rfloor$ zeros after the decimal point.\nThe term $M = 10^{(1 - \\{y\\})}$ is the mantissa of the number in scientific notation. Since $0 \\le \\{y\\} < 1$, the exponent $(1 - \\{y\\})$ is in the range $(0, 1]$. Therefore, the mantissa $M$ is in the range $(1, 10]$.\n\nThe first non-zero digits of $N$ are the digits of this mantissa $M$. We need to calculate $M$ to find its first two digits.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Calculate $A = 7^{13}$.\n2.  Calculate $B = \\log_{10}(e)$.\n3.  Calculate $y = A \\cdot B$.\n4.  Find the fractional part of $y$, which is $\\{y\\} = y \\pmod 1$.\n5.  Calculate the mantissa $M = 10^{(1 - \\{y\\})}$.\n6.  The first digit of $M$ is its integer part. The second digit is the first digit after its decimal point.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_first_two_digits():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the first two non-zero digits of e^(-7^13).\n    The calculation is based on the formula M = 10^(1 - {y}), where y = 7^13 * log10(e).\n    The digits of M are the leading digits of the original number.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate 7^13\n    val_7_pow_13 = 7**13\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate log10(e)\n    # log10(e) can be calculated as 1 / ln(10) for better precision with floats.\n    log10_e = 1 / math.log(10)\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate y = 7^13 * log10(e)\n    y = val_7_pow_13 * log10_e\n    \n    # Step 4: Find the fractional part of y\n    # The fractional part {y} is calculated using the modulo operator.\n    frac_y = y % 1\n    \n    # Step 5: Calculate the mantissa M = 10^(1 - {y})\n    mantissa = 10**(1 - frac_y)\n    \n    # The value of mantissa contains the leading digits.\n    # The first digit is the integer part of the mantissa.\n    first_digit = int(mantissa)\n    \n    # The second digit is the first decimal digit of the mantissa.\n    # We can get it by multiplying by 10, taking the integer part, and then modulo 10.\n    second_digit = int(mantissa * 10) % 10\n\n    # Print out the components of the calculation as if it were an equation\n    print(\"Let N = e^(-7^13). We write N = 10^(-y) = 10^-(floor(y)+1) * 10^(1-{y}).\")\n    print(\"The first digits are determined by the mantissa M = 10^(1-{y}).\")\n    print(\"Equation components:\")\n    print(\"7^13 = \" + str(val_7_pow_13))\n    print(\"log10(e) =\", log10_e)\n    print(\"y = 7^13 * log10(e) =\", y)\n    print(\"{y} =\", frac_y)\n    print(\"1 - {y} =\", 1 - frac_y)\n    print(\"M = 10^(1-{y}) =\", mantissa)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe first non-zero digit is: \" + str(first_digit))\n    print(\"The second non-zero digit is: \" + str(second_digit))\n\nfind_first_two_digits()\n```\n<<<63>>>"
