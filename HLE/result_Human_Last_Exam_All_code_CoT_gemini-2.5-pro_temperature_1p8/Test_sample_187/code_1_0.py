# The problem description asks for an ordered list of line numbers
# with programming errors.
# Based on the analysis:
# Line 1: Incorrect import of sqrt leads to floating-point arithmetic.
# Line 11: Use of '^' for XOR instead of '**' for exponentiation.
# Line 22: Use of '/' for float division instead of exact rational division.
# Line 23: Use of '/' for float division instead of exact rational division.
# Line 29: Use of '^' for XOR. Also causes a TypeError with float operands.
# Line 30: Use of '^' for XOR. Also causes a TypeError with float operands.
# Line 31: Use of '^' for XOR. Also causes a TypeError with float operands.
# Line 36: Unsafe equality comparison on floats, leading to incorrect boolean result.

# The user requested an ordered list with no whitespaces.
# The `json.dumps` function with separators can achieve this.
