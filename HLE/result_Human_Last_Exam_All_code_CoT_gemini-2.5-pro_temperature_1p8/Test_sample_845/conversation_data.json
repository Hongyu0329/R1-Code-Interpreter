    "This is a knowledge-based question. The value computed between heartbeats to measure Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is the time interval between those beats. This is most commonly called the **inter-beat interval (IBI)** or, when measured specifically with an electrocardiogram (ECG), the **R-R interval**.\n\nI will provide a simple Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef get_hrv_value_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the name of the value used to compute HRV.\n    HRV (Heart Rate Variability) is the measure of the variation in time\n    between consecutive heartbeats.
