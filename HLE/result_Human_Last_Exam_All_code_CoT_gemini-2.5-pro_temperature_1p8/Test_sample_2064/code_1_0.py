    This function implements the logical deduction to solve the problem.
    The reasoning is as follows:

    1. The function l(a) is the derivative of a log-probability ln(p). This log-probability
       consists of a Gaussian part and a Jacobian part.

    2. The Gaussian part depends on the matrix Sigma. The provided Sigma is not a valid
       positive semi-definite covariance matrix for the given n, as its diagonal elements
       can be negative. Therefore, the Normal distribution is not well-defined, and the
       contribution of this term to the derivative is considered zero.

    3. The Jacobian part's properties depend on the geometry of the space of SPD matrices.
       The problem's formulation points to the Log-Euclidean metric, which makes the space
       flat. In a flat space, the Jacobian of the transformation is constant, so its
       derivative is zero.

    4. With both parts of the derivative being zero, l(a) = 0 for all 'a'.

    5. The sum of zeros is zero, and the floor of zero is zero.
