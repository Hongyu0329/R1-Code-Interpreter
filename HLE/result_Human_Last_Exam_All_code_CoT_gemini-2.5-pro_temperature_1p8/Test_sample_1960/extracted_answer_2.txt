The function `f` and the formula `C` are defined as follows.

Let the "state" formulas `S_k` for `k \in \{0, 1, \dots, b\}` be defined recursively:
*   `S_0 = \bot`
*   `S_{k+1} = 1 \multimap S_k`

1.  **The function `f`:** `f` maps a natural number `w` to the linear logic formula:
    `f(w) = \bigotimes_{k=0}^{b-w} (S_k \multimap S_{k+w})`
    which is the formula `(S_0 \multimap S_w) \otimes (S_1 \multimap S_{w+1}) \otimes \dots \otimes (S_{b-w} \multimap S_b)`.

2.  **The formula `C`:** `C` is a formula that depends on `m` and `b`:
    `C = \bigotimes_{i=1}^{m} (S_0 \multimap S_b)`
    which is the formula `(S_0 \multimap S_b) \otimes (S_0 \multimap S_b) \otimes \dots \otimes (S_0 \multimap S_b)` (`m` times).
