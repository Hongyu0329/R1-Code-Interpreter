# Based on the analysis, the problem simplifies to finding the x^4 coefficient
# of the first term, which is 9*x^4 / (16*e). The coefficient is thus 9/(16*e).
# The final equation for the coefficient is 9 / (16 * e). We use these numbers in the code.

numerator = 9
denominator_constant = 16
e_value = math.e

coefficient = numerator / (denominator_constant * e_value)
