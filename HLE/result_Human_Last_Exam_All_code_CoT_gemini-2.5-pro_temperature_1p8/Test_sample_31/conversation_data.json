    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of stickers a person must look at to uniquely identify any of the 21 possible PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer) cases. The answer lies in finding the most challenging set of cases to distinguish from one another and calculating the number of stickers needed to resolve that ambiguity.\n\nThe most notoriously similar PLL cases are the T-perm and the four G-perms. My plan is as follows:\n1.  Establish that the T-perm and G-perms present the greatest recognition challenge because they share common features.\n2.  Identify the features required to see the base pattern they share. A \"block\" (a solved 1x2 section) and \"headlights\" (two corners with matching sticker colors on a side).\n3.  Count the stickers needed to see the block (2) and the headlights (2).\n4.  Identify the \"tie-breaker\" information needed to distinguish between these 5 similar cases. This is the single sticker on the edge piece between the headlights.\n5.  Sum the number of stickers for the block, headlights, and the tie-breaker to find the minimum required number for the worst-case scenario.\n\nThe python code below will detail this logic and print the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pll_sticker_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed\n    to identify any PLL case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of stickers to identify a 1x2 solved \"block\"\n    # (one corner side-sticker and one edge side-sticker).\n    stickers_for_block = 2\n\n    # The number of stickers to identify \"headlights\" on an adjacent face\n    # (the two side-stickers of the corner pieces).\n    stickers_for_headlights = 2\n\n    # The number of stickers for the \"tie-breaker\" piece.\n    # This is the edge piece located between the headlights. Its state\n    # distinguishes the T-perm from the four G-perms.\n    stickers_for_tiebreaker_edge = 1\n\n    # The total is the sum of stickers needed to see the ambiguous pattern\n    # plus the one sticker needed to resolve the ambiguity.\n    total_stickers_needed = stickers_for_block + stickers_for_headlights + stickers_for_tiebreaker_edge\n\n    print(\"On a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, identifying the PLL case requires looking at the side stickers of the top layer.\")\n    print(\"The minimum number of stickers one must see is determined by the most difficult cases to distinguish.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe hardest cases to tell apart are the T-perm and the four G-perms.\")\n    print(\"To guarantee a correct identification, a solver must observe the following:\")\n    print(f\"\\n1.
