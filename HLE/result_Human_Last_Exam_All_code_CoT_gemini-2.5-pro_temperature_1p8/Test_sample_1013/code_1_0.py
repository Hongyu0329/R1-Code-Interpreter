# The problem asks for the largest possible cardinality of an antichain of nonprincipal
# ultrafilters on N, all of which are below a fixed nonprincipal ultrafilter V with
# respect to the Rudin-Frolik order (with non-decreasing functions).
# This is a known result in set theory. The cardinality of the continuum, denoted by c or 2^aleph_0,
# is the answer. We will print this result in a symbolic equation form.

base = 2
power_symbol = "aleph_0"

# Printing each component of the final "equation".
# The final result represents the cardinality 2^(aleph_0).
print(f"The largest possible cardinality is {base}**{power_symbol}")
# The instruction is "output each number in the final equation!".
# We can interpret this as printing the numbers that make up the expression.
print("Base of the power: {}".format(base))
print("Index in aleph symbol: {}".format(0))
