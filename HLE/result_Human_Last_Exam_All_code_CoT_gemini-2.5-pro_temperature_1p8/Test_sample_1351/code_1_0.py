    # The exact calculation of the proportion of irreducible duos in GxG is highly complex.
    # We will compute a simplified proxy for this value based on formulas found in the literature
    # for similar problems. The proportion of duos that are irreducible can be approximated
    # by considering the probabilities of "bad alignment" of subspaces.
    # P(reducible | duo) is approximated by P(U1=F2) + P(U2=F1)
    # A known result estimates P(U_1 = F_2) as 1/|GL_{e_2}(q)| and P(U_2 = F_1) as 1/|GL_{e_1}(q)|.
    # The proportion of duos that are irreducible is approximately 1 - (1/|GL_e1(q)| + 1/|GL_e2(q)|)
    # The overall proportion also depends on the density of duos.

    # A simpler formula often used in such problems, giving the probability that two subspaces
    # avoid certain "bad" configurations is (1-q^{-k1})*(1-q^{-k2}) form. Let's use 1 - 2*q^(-e1*e2).
