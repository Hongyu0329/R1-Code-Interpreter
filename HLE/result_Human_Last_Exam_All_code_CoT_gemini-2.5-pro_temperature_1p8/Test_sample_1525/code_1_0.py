    This function analyzes the five statements about the Datalog formalism.

    - Statement A: Correct. The critique about relying on "order of appearance" is a valid point concerning the formalism's robustness, as Datalog programs are often treated as unordered sets of rules.
    - Statement B: Incorrect. It mischaracterizes the central claim. The claim is about the outcome P(S0), not the program identity P.
    - Statement C: Correct. It accurately points out that the aggregation operator gamma is lossy, and segregation is not a true inverse (i.e., gamma_inv(gamma(P)) != P in general).
    - Statement D: Incorrect. A set of facts S0 is a simple Datalog program. The definition of segregation for a program P applies directly to S0 without ambiguity.
    - Statement E: Correct. It provides a perfect conceptual interpretation of the main mathematical claim, describing it as an equivalence between coarse-grained inference and a refine-infer-coarsen cycle.

    Counting the correct statements (A, C, E), we find there are 3.
