    This function explains the reaction and provides the IUPAC name of the major product.
    
    The reaction proceeds in two main steps:
    1.  Sulfoxide Elimination: The starting material, 
        phenyl (2-((1,1-dimethylprop-2-en-1-yl)oxy)ethyl) sulfoxide
        (Ph-S(=O)-CH2-CH2-O-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2), undergoes a thermal syn-elimination
        at 180 Â°C. This breaks the C-S bond and forms phenylsulfenic acid (PhSOH)
        and an allyl vinyl ether intermediate:
        CH2=CH-O-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.
        
    2.  Claisen Rearrangement: The allyl vinyl ether intermediate is unstable at high
        temperatures and immediately undergoes a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.
        The bond rearrangement leads to a stable gamma,delta-unsaturated aldehyde.
        
        The structure of the final product is: O=CH-CH2-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.
    
    This script will now provide the IUPAC name of this final product.
