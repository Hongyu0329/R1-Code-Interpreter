    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user wants to find the musical note that corresponds to a specific color range on \"Newton's colour circle\".\n2.  **Establish the Core Mapping:** First, I need to define the relationship between colors and musical notes as proposed by Isaac Newton. He associated the seven colors of the visible spectrum with the seven notes of a diatonic scale. The most common mapping is:\n    *   Red -> C\n    *   Orange -> D\n    *   Yellow -> E\n    *   Green -> F\n    *   Blue -> G\n    *   Indigo -> A\n    *   Violet -> B\n3.  **Identify the Colors:**\n    *   The first color is \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue\". In the context of light and the prismatic spectrum that Newton used, the color that lies between yellow and blue is **green**.\n    *   The second color is explicitly stated as **blue**.\n4.  **Interpret the \"Range\":** The question asks for the single musical note corresponding to the \"range between\" green and blue. On the circle, this range includes the colors starting with green (Note F) and ending with blue (Note G). The question puts a special emphasis on the first color by describing its creation (\"combining yellow and blue\"). The most logical interpretation is to identify the note associated with this derived starting color.\n5.  **Determine the Final Note:** The starting color of the range is Green. According to the mapping, the musical note for Green is **F**.\n6.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script to formalize this process. The script will:\n    *   Store the Newton color-to-note mapping in a dictionary.\n    *   Identify the start and end colors based on the problem's description.\n    *   Retrieve the corresponding notes for both colors.\n    *   Explain the interpretation and print the final \"equation\" and result, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_newton_music_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle of finding a musical note on Newton's color circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the mapping between colors and notes based on Newton's analogy.\n    newton_color_notes = {\n        'red': 'C',\n        'orange': 'D',\n        'yellow': 'E',\n        'green': 'F',\n        'blue': 'G',\n        'indigo': 'A',\n        'violet': 'B'\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the colors in the specified range.\n    # The color produced by combining/being between \"yellow\" and \"blue\" is \"green\".\n    start_color_component_1 = \"yellow\"\n    start_color_component_2 = \"blue\"\n    start_color = \"green\"\n    end_color = \"blue\"\n\n    # Step 3: Find the musical notes for these colors.\n    start_note = newton_color_notes[start_color]\n    end_note = newton_color_notes[end_color]\n\n    # Step 4: Interpret the question and form the answer.\n    # The question asks for the single note for the range starting with the color\n    # derived from yellow and blue.
