    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify the Mathematical Space**: The \"space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$\" is a well-known object in mathematics called a Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $Gr(3, 5)$.\n2.  **Recall a Key Theorem**: I will use the fundamental theorem regarding the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians. This theorem states that the integral cohomology ring, $H^*(Gr(k, n); \\mathbb{Z})$, is always torsion-free.\n3.  **Analyze the Torsion Subgroup**: Based on the theorem, since the cohomology ring is torsion-free, its torsion subgroup must be the trivial group, which contains only the zero element, i.e., $\\{0\\}$.\n4.  **Calculate the Rank**: The rank of an abelian group is the dimension of its free part. The trivial group $\\{0\\}$ has a rank of 0.\n5.  **Construct the Code**: I will write a Python script that explains these steps and prints the final answer, explicitly showing the numbers involved in the problem's definition and solution, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_rank_of_torsion_subgroup():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the rank of the torsion subgroup of the\n    integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of R^5.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters from the problem\n    k = 3\n    n = 5\n\n    print(f\"This problem asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of {k}-subspaces of R^{n}.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 1: Identifying the Space ---\")\n    print(f\"The space of {k}-subspaces in an {n}-dimensional real vector space (R^{n}) is known as the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted Gr({k}, {n}).\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 2: The Structure of the Cohomology Ring ---\")\n    print(\"A key theorem in algebraic topology states that the integral cohomology ring of a real Grassmannian, H*(Gr(k, n); Z), is torsion-free.\")\n    print(\"This means that every element of the ring with finite order must be the zero element.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 3: Identifying the Torsion Subgroup ---\")\n    print(\"The torsion subgroup of a group is the collection of all its elements of finite order.\")\n    print(\"Since H*(Gr({k}, {n}); Z) is torsion-free, its torsion subgroup consists of only the zero element.
