    "Of course. I will provide you with a Python script to answer your question.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the standard numbering of the *bayts* (couplets) in the poem \"Aqeedat al-'Awaam\".\n2.  Locate the specific section where the names of the 25 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an are listed.\n3.  Determine the starting and ending bayt numbers for this list.\n4.  Write a Python script that declares these numbers and prints the answer in a clear sentence, ensuring each individual bayt number is also displayed as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophet_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the bayt numbers in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n    that list the names of the prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to standard editions of the poem, the listing of the\n    # 25 prophets starts at bayt 27 and concludes at bayt 30.\n    start_bayt = 27\n    end_bayt = 30\n\n    # Create a list of the specific bayt numbers\n    bayt_numbers = list(range(start_bayt, end_bayt + 1))\n\n    # Print the answer clearly\n    print(f\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the names of the Prophets are mentioned from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n    \n    # As requested, output each number involved in the final answer.\n    # We will format this as the explicit list of the bayts.\n    print(\"\\nThe specific bayt numbers containing the names are:\")\n    # This loop outputs each number in the sequence\n    for number in bayt_numbers:\n        print(number)\n\n# Execute the function to display the result\nfind_prophet_verses()\n```\n<<<27 to 30>>>"
