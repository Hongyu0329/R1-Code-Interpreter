    print(f"Let's write κ as {aleph}_α for some ordinal α.")
    print(f"The fact that κ is singular means that its index α must be a limit ordinal, and cf(κ) = cf({aleph}_α) = cf(α).")

    print(f"Modern set theory shows that it is consistent with ZFC for cf(2^ω) to be any uncountable regular cardinal not explicitly forbidden. Therefore, the set X of possible cofinalities is the set of *all* uncountable regular cardinals less than {upper_bound}.")

    print(f"Let S be this set of successor ordinals. The order type of S is known to be {index_outer}.")
    print(f"Since S is a subset of I, and I is a subset of all ordinals less than {index_outer}, the order type of I must be squeezed between the order type of S and the order type of {index_outer}.")
    print(f"otp(S) ≤ otp(I) ≤ otp({index_outer})")
