    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this task:\n\n1.  **Identify Noble Gases**: First, I will identify all the elements classified as noble gases. These are Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and the radioactive Radon (Rn).\n2.  **Determine Rarity**: Next, I will compare the natural abundance of these gases within Earth's matter (primarily atmosphere and crust) to find the one with the lowest concentration. Due to its extreme radioactivity and short half-life, Radon is by far the rarest.\n3.  **Find Data for 2002**: I will find a citable value for Radon's abundance from a source relevant to the year 2002. The CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics (a standard reference) from that era lists Radon's abundance in the Earth's crust as approximately 4 x 10⁻¹³ parts per million (ppm).\n4.  **Convert to Percentage**: I will create a Python script that takes this abundance in ppm and converts it to a percentage. The conversion is done by dividing the ppm value by 10,000.\n5.  **Present the Answer**: The Python code will then print the final answer, stating the name of the gas and its percentage as a clear equation, fulfilling your request.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas_percentage():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the rarest noble gas and calculates its percentage\n    of all terrestrial matter based on data from 2002.\n\n    The rarest noble gas is Radon (Rn). Its rarity is due to its radioactivity\n    and short half-life; it decays soon after being formed.\n\n    Data is sourced from the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 83rd Edition (2002-2003),\n    which lists Radon's abundance in the Earth's crust. This is a standard proxy\n    for 'terrestrial matter'.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Rarest noble gas name\n    gas_name = \"Radon\"\n\n    # Abundance in Earth's crust in parts per million (ppm) by mass.\n    # Source value is 4 x 10^-13 ppm.\n    abundance_ppm = 4e-13\n\n    # To convert parts per million (ppm) to a percentage, we divide by 10,000.\n    # 1% = 10,000 ppm\n    conversion_factor = 10000\n    abundance_percentage = abundance_ppm / conversion_factor\n\n    # To fulfill the request to output each number in the final equation,\n    # we will represent the final percentage in the format: base x 10^exponent.\n    # abundance_percentage = 4e-17\n    base = 4.0\n    exponent = -17\n\n    print(f\"The rarest noble gas on Earth as of 2002 is {gas_name}.\")\n    print(f\"Its abundance as a percentage of terrestrial matter (crustal) is approximately:\")\n    print(f\"{base} x 10^{exponent}%\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the result\nfind_rarest_noble_gas_percentage()\n```\n<<<4e-17%>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What was the rarest noble gas on Earth as as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
