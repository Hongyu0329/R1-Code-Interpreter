    "To find the number of real intersection points between the two given plane quadrics, we need to solve the system of two equations with two variables, x and y:\n1. `164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0`\n2. `864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0`\n\nA direct call to a symbolic solver can sometimes be unreliable for complex systems. A more robust method is to eliminate one variable to get a single polynomial in the other variable. We can achieve this using the method of resultants.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  Treat the two equations as polynomials in one variable (say, `y`), where the coefficients are polynomials in the other variable (`x`).\n2.  Compute the **resultant** of these two polynomials with respect to `y`. The resultant is a polynomial in `x` whose roots are the x-coordinates of the intersection points of the two original curves.\n3.  Find the roots of this resultant polynomial.\n4.  Check if any of these roots (the x-coordinates) are real numbers. If all x-coordinates are complex, then there can be no real intersection points `(x, y)`. If there are real x-coordinates, we would then substitute them back into the original equations to find the corresponding real y-coordinates.\n5.  Count the number of valid real pairs `(x, y)`.\n\nI will use Python with the `sympy` library to implement this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_real_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of real intersection points for two quadric equations\n    using the resultant method.\n    \"\"\"\n    x, y = sympy.symbols('x y')\n\n    # Define the two quadric equations from the user input.\n    # Equation 1:\n    eq1_coeffs = {'A': 164, 'B': -216, 'C': 72, 'D': -16, 'E': 0, 'F': 31}\n    p1 = eq1_coeffs['A']*x**2 + eq1_coeffs['B']*x*y + eq1_coeffs['C']*y**2 + \\\n         eq1_coeffs['D']*x + eq1_coeffs['E']*y + eq1_coeffs['F']\n    \n    # Equation 2:\n    eq2_coeffs = {'A': 864, 'B': -1056, 'C': 324, 'D': -560, 'E': 324, 'F': 149}\n    p2 = eq2_coeffs['A']*x**2 + eq2_coeffs['B']*x*y + eq2_coeffs['C']*y**2 + \\\n         eq2_coeffs['D']*x + eq2_coeffs['E']*y + eq2_coeffs['F']\n\n    print(\"Finding the number of real intersection points for the quadrics:\")\n    # Using sympy.Eq to pretty-print the equations with all numbers\n    print(\"Equation 1:\", sympy.Eq(p1, 0))\n    print(\"Equation 2:\", sympy.Eq(p2, 0))\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Treat the polynomials p1 and p2 as polynomials in y\n    p1_poly_y = sympy.poly(p1, y)\n    p2_poly_y = sympy.poly(p2, y)\n\n    # Compute the resultant with respect to y.
