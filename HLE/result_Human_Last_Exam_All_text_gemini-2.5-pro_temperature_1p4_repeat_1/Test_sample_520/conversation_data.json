    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n1.  **Identify the subject:** The central figure is Andre Vernault.\n2.  **Identify the context:** The time is World War II, the place is the United Kingdom, and the situation involves counterintelligence interrogation.\n3.  **Identify the core problem:** British counterintelligence incorrectly identified Vernault as a German spy.\n4.  **Identify the reason for suspicion:** The false belief was based on the fact that he \"concealed from interrogators his true profession.\"\n5.  **Identify the goal:** The question asks to state what his \"true profession\" was.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **The Mindset of Counterintelligence:** During WWII, Britain was under immense threat of invasion and espionage. Interrogators at MI5 (the UK's domestic counterintelligence agency) operated under a high degree of suspicion. Any inconsistency, lie, or omission in a refugee's story was a significant red flag, as it could be a sign of a \"cover story\" created by enemy intelligence.\n2.  **Motive for Lying:** The key to this problem is understanding that people can have strong motivations to lie or conceal their past for reasons entirely unrelated to espionage. These reasons can include shame, fear of prosecution for other crimes, or protecting one's reputation.\n3.  **The Nature of the Profession:** Vernault's true profession was something he believed would be viewed negatively by the British authorities. He likely feared it would lead to his imprisonment or deportation, regardless of any spy connection. This fear motivated his concealment.\n4.  **The Irony:** The very act of hiding a non-espionage-related secret made him appear exactly like a spy to his interrogators. This case is often cited as a classic example of the challenges and potential pitfalls of counterintelligence analysis.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step Analysis\n1.  Andre Vernault was a real Belgian refugee who arrived in Britain in 1941. Like all refugees from German-occupied territory, he was sent for vetting and interrogation by MI5.\n2.  During his questioning, Vernault's story had holes in it. He was evasive about his life and work in Belgium before the war. He provided a simple, respectable-sounding profession that did not stand up to scrutiny.\n3.  Because he was clearly hiding something significant, MI5's default assumption was that he was concealing espionage activities. They believed his real purpose for being in the UK was to work as a German agent.\n4.  However, further investigation and eventual confession revealed the truth. Vernault was not a spy. The secret he was so desperately trying to hide was his true line of work in Brussels.\n5.  His actual profession was that he was a **brothel-keeper** (or pimp). He was ashamed of this illegal and socially sordid profession and correctly assumed the British authorities would take a very dim view of it. His lie was not to cover up spying, but to create a more respectable identity for himself.\n\n<<<Brothel-keeper"
