    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify the most probable mechanism that explains two key outcomes after a gene duplication event:\n1.  **Retention:** Why is the new, duplicate copy of the gene kept in the genome over evolutionary time, instead of being lost?\n2.  **Divergence:** How do the two copies (the original and the duplicate) accumulate differences and evolve into distinct genes?\n\nThe fate of a duplicate gene is not guaranteed. The most common outcome is that the duplicate copy accumulates disabling mutations and becomes a non-functional pseudogene because there's no selective pressure to maintain it when the original copy is still working perfectly. The question is about the exceptions—the cases where both copies are kept and become different.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Answer Choice**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one gene copy is \"converted\" to the sequence of the other copy, effectively erasing any differences that have accumulated. Gene conversion leads to homogenization (making genes identical), which is the *opposite* of divergence. Therefore, it cannot be the mechanism responsible for both retention and divergence.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where a gene copy becomes non-functional due to mutations. While this is the most common fate for a duplicate gene and does involve sequence divergence (the pseudogene's sequence changes from the functional gene), it does not explain the *retention* of two functional genes. It's a mechanism of gene loss, not retention of function.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy keeps the original function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it an entirely new, beneficial function.\n    *   **Retention:** Both copies are retained by natural selection—one for the original function and the new one for its novel benefit.\n    *   **Divergence:** The new copy must diverge significantly to gain a new function.\n    *   **Likelihood:** This process requires a rare event: a mutation that creates a new, advantageous function. While it is a very important mechanism for evolution, the initial period after duplication leaves the second copy redundant and at high risk of being lost to pseudogenization before such a rare beneficial mutation can occur.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** In this model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation or DDC model), the ancestral gene had multiple functions or was expressed in multiple tissues/times. After duplication, each copy accumulates different degenerative (loss-of-function) mutations, such that each copy loses a different subset of the original functions.\n    *   **Retention:** Both copies are now required to collectively perform the full set of functions of the original single gene. Losing either one would be disadvantageous, so selection retains both.\n    *   **Divergence:** The accumulation of different mutations causes the genes to diverge in both their sequence and their functional roles/expression patterns.\n    *   **Likelihood:** This mechanism relies on degenerative mutations, which are much more common than the gain-of-function mutations required for neofunctionalization. It provides a quick and highly probable \"passive\" route to protecting both gene copies from being lost, as they quickly become co-dependent. For this reason, it is often considered a more likely initial mechanism for the retention of duplicate genes.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This describes the rapid diversification of a species or group of species into many different forms to fill new ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that fuels adaptive radiation, adaptive radiation itself is a macroevolutionary pattern, not a molecular mechanism at the level of a single gene pair. The underlying mechanisms would be neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Plausible Mechanisms and Conclude**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are valid mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, the question asks for the \"most likely\" one.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization** is powerful but relies on rare beneficial mutations. The duplicate gene has to \"get lucky\" before it's lost.\n*   **Subfunctionalization** relies on very common degenerative mutations. It provides a more probable and immediate path to a situation where both gene copies are preserved by selection.\n\nTherefore, subfunctionalization is widely considered to be a more frequent or likely mechanism for the *initial* retention of duplicate genes, creating a stable state from which further divergence (and perhaps even later neofunctionalization) can occur.\n\n<<<D>>>"
