    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Triple Crown in MLB\nA \"Triple Crown\" is a prestigious accomplishment for a player who leads their respective league (American League or National League) in three specific statistical categories in a single season. It's important to note that there are two different types of Triple Crowns: one for batters and one for pitchers.\n\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** A player must lead the league in **Batting Average (AVG)**, **Home Runs (HR)**, and **Runs Batted In (RBI)**.\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A player must lead the league in **Wins (W)**, **Strikeouts (SO)**, and **Earned Run Average (ERA)**.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of winners, which implies the total number of unique players who have achieved either the batting or pitching Triple Crown.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Batting Triple Crown Winners\n\nWe need to list all the players who have won the batting Triple Crown and count the number of unique individuals.\n\n*   **Paul Hines** (1878, NL)\n*   **Tip O'Neill** (1887, American Association)\n*   **Hugh Duffy** (1894, NL)\n*   **Nap Lajoie** (1901, AL)\n*   **Ty Cobb** (1909, AL)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1922 & 1925, NL) - *Won twice*\n*   **Chuck Klein** (1933, NL)\n*   **Jimmie Foxx** (1933, AL)\n*   **Lou Gehrig** (1934, AL)\n*   **Joe Medwick** (1937, NL)\n*   **Ted Williams** (1942 & 1947, AL) - *Won twice*\n*   **Mickey Mantle** (1956, AL)\n*   **Frank Robinson** (1966, AL)\n*   **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967, AL)\n*   **Miguel Cabrera** (2012, AL)\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The wins by Hines (1878) and O'Neill (1887) are sometimes disputed. Hines's RBI total is based on retroactive calculation as it wasn't an official stat at the time. O'Neill played in the American Association, which was a major league but not the direct ancestor of the AL or NL. However, most official sources recognize these achievements.\n*   Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams are the only players to win the batting Triple Crown more than once.\n*   Counting the unique players from this list, we get **15** unique batting Triple Crown winners.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Pitching Triple Crown Winners\n\nNext, we list all the players who have won the pitching Triple Crown and count the number of unique individuals.\n\n*   **Amos Rusie** (1894, NL)\n*   **Cy Young** (1901, AL)\n*   **Rube Waddell** (1905, AL)\n*   **Christy Mathewson** (1905 & 1908, NL) - *Won twice*\n*   **Walter Johnson** (1913, 1918, & 1924, AL) - *Won three times*\n*   **Grover Cleveland Alexander** (1915, 1916, & 1920, NL) - *Won three times*\n*   **Dazzy Vance** (1924, NL)\n*   **Lefty Grove** (1930 & 1931, AL) - *Won twice*\n*   **Lefty Gomez** (1934 & 1937, AL) - *Won twice*\n*   **Bucky Walters** (1939, NL)\n*   **Hal Newhouser** (1945, AL)\n*   **Sandy Koufax** (1963, 1965, & 1966, NL) - *Won three times*\n*   **Steve Carlton** (1972, NL)\n*   **Dwight Gooden** (1985, NL)\n*   **Roger Clemens** (1997 & 1998, AL) - *Won twice*\n*   **Pedro Mart√≠nez** (1999, AL)\n*   **Randy Johnson** (2002, NL)\n*   **Johan Santana** (2006, AL)\n*   **Jake Peavy** (2007, NL)\n*   **Justin Verlander** (2011, AL)\n*   **Clayton Kershaw** (2011, NL)\n*   **Shane Bieber** (2020, AL)\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Several pitchers have won the award multiple times, with Walter Johnson, Grover Cleveland Alexander, and Sandy Koufax each winning it three times.\n*   No player has ever won both a batting and a pitching Triple Crown.\n*   Counting the unique players from this list, we get **22** unique pitching Triple Crown winners.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Total\n\nTo find the total number of Triple Crown winners, we add the number of unique batting winners to the number of unique pitching winners.\n\n*   Unique Batting Winners: 15\n*   Unique Pitching Winners: 22\n*   Total Unique Winners = 15 + 22 = 37\n\nThere have been **37** unique players in MLB history who have won a Triple Crown (either for batting or pitching).\n\n<<<37>>>"
