    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the identity of a physicist based on several specific clues:\n    *   He is a physicist.\n    *   He is better known for work in the microscopy field.\n    *   He discovered/explained an optical effect.\n    *   This effect pertains to real imagery.\n    *   The effect was first accidentally observed by a custodial worker.\n    *   The observation was made while the worker was cleaning concave mirrors (or a similar concave surface).\n\n2.  **Analyze the \"Custodial Worker\" Anecdote:** The most crucial and unique clue is the story of a discovery by a custodial worker or cleaner. This specific anecdote is famously associated with the **\"whispering gallery\" effect**. The story goes that a cleaner or guide at St. Paul's Cathedral in London noticed that a whisper against the curved wall under the dome could be heard clearly on the opposite side.\n\n3.  **Identify the Physicist Associated with the Anecdote:** The physicist who investigated and provided the scientific explanation for the whispering gallery effect was **John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh**, commonly known as **Lord Rayleigh**. He explained that the sound waves cling to the concave wall, reflecting continuously and being guided around the gallery with very little loss of intensity.\n\n4.  **Connect the Physicist to Microscopy:** The question states the physicist is \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\" Lord Rayleigh made fundamental contributions to optics. Most notably, he formulated the **Rayleigh criterion**, which defines the limit of resolution for optical instruments. This criterion states that two point sources are just resolvable when the central maximum of the diffraction pattern of one source is directly over the first minimum of the diffraction pattern of the other. This principle is fundamental to determining the maximum resolving power of microscopes and telescopes. This firmly connects Lord Rayleigh to the field of microscopy.\n\n5.  **Address the \"Optical Effect\" and \"Concave Mirror\" Clues:**\n    *   **Optical Effect:** While the original \"whispering gallery\" discovery was acoustical (sound waves), the physical principle of wave-focusing by a concave surface is identical for light waves. Lord Rayleigh was a master of both acoustics and optics. This wave-guiding phenomenon is now studied in optics and is known as a \"whispering-gallery mode,\" which is crucial in designing optical resonators.\n    *   **Concave Mirrors:** A concave mirror is a specific example of a concave surface that focuses waves (in this case, light waves) to form a **real image**. The dome of the whispering gallery acts as a large-scale acoustic reflector, analogous to an optical concave mirror. The mention of \"concave mirrors\" correctly points to the geometry required for this focusing effect.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Findings:** Lord Rayleigh is the only physicist who fits all the criteria.\n    *   He is the physicist who explained the effect observed by a worker/guide in a whispering gallery (a concave surface).\n    *   His Rayleigh criterion is a cornerstone of microscopy and optics, establishing his reputation in that field.\n    *   The phenomenon he explained is a wave-focusing effect directly analogous to how a concave mirror forms a real image with light.\n\nTherefore, the physicist described in the question is Lord Rayleigh.\n\n### Final Answer\n<<<Lord Rayleigh>>>"
