    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Basics**\n\n*   **The Manifold:** The domain is the 2-torus, denoted as $T^2$. This is a compact, connected, and orientable surface (like the surface of a doughnut).\n*   **The Function:** We are considering a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$. \"Smooth\" means the function is infinitely differentiable.\n*   **Critical Points:** A point $p \\in T^2$ is a critical point of $f$ if the derivative (or gradient) of $f$ at $p$ is zero. At such points, the tangent plane to the graph of the function is horizontal.\n\n**Step 2: Elementary Lower Bound from Compactness**\n\n*   The torus $T^2$ is a compact space.\n*   A fundamental theorem in analysis states that any continuous function on a compact space must attain a global maximum and a global minimum value.\n*   Let $p_{max}$ be a point where $f$ attains its maximum, and $p_{min}$ be a point where $f$ attains its minimum.\n*   At these points of global extrema, the derivative of the function must be zero. Therefore, $p_{max}$ and $p_{min}$ are critical points.\n*   This establishes that any smooth function on the torus must have at least **two** critical points (a maximum and a minimum).\n\n**Step 3: Applying Morse Theory for a More Powerful Bound**\n\nMorse theory provides a deep connection between the number of critical points of a function and the topology of the underlying manifold.\n\n*   **Morse Functions:** We can assume, without loss of generality, that our function $f$ is a **Morse function**. A Morse function is a special type of smooth function where all critical points are \"non-degenerate\" (meaning the Hessian matrix of second derivatives is invertible at each critical point). Any smooth function can be slightly perturbed to become a Morse function, and this process does not reduce the number of critical points below the topological minimum.\n*   **Topological Invariants of the Torus:** The key topological properties of the torus are captured by its **Betti numbers** and its **Euler characteristic**.\n    *   **Betti Numbers ($b_k$):** These numbers count the number of \"holes\" of different dimensions.\n        *   $b_0(T^2) = 1$ (1 connected component).\n        *   $b_1(T^2) = 2$ (2 independent non-contractible loops: one along the latitude and one along the longitude of the doughnut).\n        *   $b_2(T^2) = 1$ (1 enclosed two-dimensional void).\n    *   **Euler Characteristic ($\\chi$):** This is the alternating sum of the Betti numbers.\n        *   $\\chi(T^2) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0$.\n\n*   **The Morse Inequalities:** For a Morse function on a manifold $M$, let $c_k$ be the number of critical points of index $k$. (For a surface like the torus, index 0 corresponds to a local minimum, index 1 to a saddle point, and index 2 to a local maximum). The Morse inequalities state:\n    1.  $c_k \\ge b_k$ for each index $k$.\n    2.  $\\sum (-1)^k c_k = \\chi(M)$.\n\n**Step 4: Applying the Inequalities to the Torus**\n\nLet's apply the Morse inequalities to our function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n1.  From $c_k \\ge b_k$:\n    *   $c_0 \\ge b_0(T^2) = 1 \\implies$ There must be at least 1 local minimum.\n    *   $c_1 \\ge b_1(T^2) = 2 \\implies$ There must be at least 2 saddle points.\n    *   $c_2 \\ge b_2(T^2) = 1 \\implies$ There must be at least 1 local maximum.\n\n2.  The total number of critical points is $N = c_0 + c_1 + c_2$. Based on the inequalities above, the minimum possible number of critical points is:\n    $N_{min} \\ge 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n\n3.  From the Euler characteristic formula:\n    *   $c_0 - c_1 + c_2 = \\chi(T^2) = 0$.\n    *   Let's check if the minimal numbers derived from the inequalities ($c_0=1, c_1=2, c_2=1$) are consistent with this formula: $1 - 2 + 1 = 0$. Yes, they are.\n\nSo, Morse theory predicts that the minimal number of critical points is at least 4.\n\n**Step 5: Proving the Minimum is Achievable**\n\nTo confirm that 4 is indeed the minimum, we must show that there exists a smooth function on the torus with exactly 4 critical points.\n\n*   **Construction:** We can represent the torus as the unit square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$ with opposite edges identified. Consider the function:\n    $f(x, y) = \\cos(2\\pi x) + \\cos(2\\pi y)$\n    This function is smooth and periodic, so it is well-defined on the torus.\n\n*   **Finding Critical Points:** The gradient is $\\nabla f = (-2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi x), -2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi y))$. Setting $\\nabla f = 0$ implies $\\sin(2\\pi x)=0$ and $\\sin(2\\pi y)=0$. In the domain $[0,1) \\times [0,1)$, this gives four solutions:\n    1.  $(0, 0)$\n    2.  $(1/2, 0)$\n    3.  $(0, 1/2)$\n    4.  $(1/2, 1/2)$\n\n*   **Classifying Critical Points:** We use the Hessian matrix to classify them:\n    $H(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} -4\\pi^2 \\cos(2\\pi x) & 0 \\\\ 0 & -4\\pi^2 \\cos(2\\pi y) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    1.  At $(0,0)$: The Hessian is $\\begin{pmatrix} -4\\pi^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -4\\pi^2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Both eigenvalues are negative. This is a **local maximum** (index 2).\n    2.  At $(1/2, 0)$: The Hessian is $\\begin{pmatrix} 4\\pi^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -4\\pi^2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues have opposite signs. This is a **saddle point** (index 1).\n    3.  At $(0, 1/2)$: The Hessian is $\\begin{pmatrix} -4\\pi^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 4\\pi^2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues have opposite signs. This is a **saddle point** (index 1).\n    4.  At $(1/2, 1/2)$: The Hessian is $\\begin{pmatrix} 4\\pi^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 4\\pi^2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Both eigenvalues are positive. This is a **local minimum** (index 0).\n\nThis function has exactly 4 critical points: 1 minimum, 2 saddles, and 1 maximum.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe Morse inequalities establish a lower bound of 4 for the number of critical points. The explicit construction of a function with exactly 4 critical points proves that this lower bound is achievable. Therefore, the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on the 2-torus is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
