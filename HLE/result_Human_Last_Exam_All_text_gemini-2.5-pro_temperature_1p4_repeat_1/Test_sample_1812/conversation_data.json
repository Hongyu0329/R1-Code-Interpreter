    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The question asks for the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix `A`. The matrix is provided explicitly. The context mentioning the \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" is background information. Since the matrix `A` is given, we do not need to derive it from this context. The problem is a direct computation of a determinant.\n\n2.  **The Matrix:** The matrix is:\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix} \n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ \n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n    -1 & -1 & 2 \n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n\n3.  **Choose a Method:** There are several standard methods to compute the determinant of a 3x3 matrix.\n    *   **Method A: Observing Matrix Properties (Linear Dependence).** This is often the quickest method if a special property exists.\n    *   **Method B: The Rule of Sarrus.** A formula-based method specific to 3x3 matrices.\n    *   **Method C: Cofactor Expansion.** A general method applicable to any square matrix.\n\n    We will use Method A first and then verify with Method B.\n\n4.  **Execution using Method A (Linear Dependence):**\n    *   A key property of a square matrix is that if its rows or columns are linearly dependent, its determinant is zero.\n    *   Let's check the sum of the columns of matrix `A`. Let `C1`, `C2`, `C3` be the column vectors.\n    \\[ C1 + C2 + C3 = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 - 1 - 1 \\\\ -1 + 2 - 1 \\\\ -1 - 1 + 2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n    *   Since the sum of the column vectors is the zero vector, the columns are linearly dependent.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because the columns of matrix `A` are linearly dependent, its determinant must be 0.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This property can also be observed in the rows. The sum of the elements in each row is 0 (e.g., Row 1: 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0). This implies that the vector \\( \\mathbf{v} = [1, 1, 1]^T \\) is an eigenvector of `A` with an eigenvalue of 0, because \\( A\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0} = 0 \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\). Since the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues, and one eigenvalue is 0, the determinant must be 0.\n\n5.  **Verification using Method B (Rule of Sarrus):**\n    *   The rule of Sarrus states that the determinant is the sum of the products of the three main diagonals minus the sum of the products of the three anti-diagonals.\n    *   **Sum of the products of the main diagonals:**\n        \\[ (2)(2)(2) + (-1)(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)(-1) = 8 + (-1) + (-1) = 6 \\]\n    *   **Sum of the products of the anti-diagonals:**\n        \\[ (-1)(2)(-1) + (-1)(-1)(2) + (2)(-1)(-1) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\]\n    *   **Determinant calculation:**\n        \\[ \\det(A) = (\\text{Sum of main diagonals}) - (\\text{Sum of anti-diagonals}) = 6 - 6 = 0 \\]\n    *   **Careful Point:** Be very careful with the signs during multiplication and summation.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBoth methods confirm that the determinant of the matrix `A` is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
