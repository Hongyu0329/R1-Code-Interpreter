    "An analysis of the question step by step is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the terminology**\n*   **Generalized Quaternion Group of size 128:** This group, denoted as $Q_{128}$, is a non-abelian group of order 128. Its structure is defined by a specific presentation. The generalized quaternion group $Q_{4n}$ is given by the presentation:\n    $Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n    For size 128, we have $4n = 128$, which implies $n = 32$. Thus, the group in question is:\n    $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if it is generated by a single element. In other words, $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ for some $g \\in G$. This is the definition of a **cyclic subgroup**.\nThe question is asking for the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $Q_{128}$.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the elements of Q_128**\nThe elements of $Q_{128}$ can be uniquely written in the form $x^i$ or $x^i y$ for $0 \\le i < 64$.\n*   There are 64 elements of the form $x^i$, which form a subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   There are 64 elements of the form $x^i y$.\n\nWe will find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups by considering the subgroups generated by each type of element.\n\n**Step 3: Count the cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form x^i**\nThe elements of the form $x^i$ for $0 \\le i < 64$ all belong to the subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$. Since $|x|=64$, this subgroup is a cyclic group of order 64, isomorphic to $C_{64}$.\nThe cyclic subgroups generated by these elements are exactly the subgroups of $\\langle x \\rangle$.\nFor a cyclic group of order $m$, there is exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $m$. The total number of subgroups is $\\tau(m)$, the number of divisors of $m$.\nHere, $m=64$. The prime factorization of 64 is $2^6$.\nThe number of divisors is $\\tau(64) = 6+1 = 7$.\nThese 7 subgroups are $\\langle x^d \\rangle$ for each $d$ that divides 64. Specifically, they are: $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\langle 1 \\rangle$, $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$, $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$, $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$, $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$, $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$, and $\\langle x \\rangle$.\nThese are the first 7 power subgroups.\n\n**Step 4: Count the cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form x^i y**\nLet's consider an element $g = x^i y$. We first determine its order.\n$g^2 = (x^i y)^2 = (x^i y)(x^i y) = x^i(yx^i)y$.\nUsing the relation $y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}$, we can derive $yx=x^{-1}y$, and more generally $yx^i = x^{-i}y$.\nSo, $g^2 = x^i(x^{-i}y)y = (x^i x^{-i})y^2 = y^2$.\nFrom the group presentation, we have $y^2=x^{32}$.\nTherefore, $g^2 = x^{32}$.\nSince $x$ has order 64, $x^{32}$ is not the identity element (it has order 2). So, the order of $g$ is not 2.\nLet's calculate $g^4$:\n$g^4 = (g^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\nSince $g^2 \\ne 1$ and $g^4=1$, the order of any element of the form $x^i y$ is 4.\nEach of these 64 elements generates a cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n\n**Step 5: Count the number of *distinct* subgroups from Step 4**\nWe need to determine when two such subgroups, say $\\langle x^i y \\rangle$ and $\\langle x^j y \\rangle$, are the same.\nTwo cyclic groups of the same order are identical if and only if they contain the same generators.\nLet $H_i = \\langle x^i y \\rangle$. The elements of $H_i$ are $\\{1, x^i y, (x^i y)^2, (x^i y)^3\\}$.\nWe know $(x^i y)^2 = x^{32}$.\n$(x^i y)^3 = (x^i y)^2 (x^i y) = x^{32} x^i y = x^{32+i}y$.\nSo, $H_i = \\{1, x^i y, x^{32}, x^{32+i}y\\}$.\nThe elements of order 4 in $H_i$ (its generators) are $x^i y$ and $x^{32+i}y$.\nTherefore, the subgroup $\\langle x^j y \\rangle$ is identical to $\\langle x^i y \\rangle$ if and only if $x^j y$ is a generator of $\\langle x^i y \\rangle$.\nThis implies that either $x^j y = x^i y$ or $x^j y = x^{32+i}y$.\nThis means $j \\equiv i \\pmod{64}$ or $j \\equiv i+32 \\pmod{64}$.\nSo, for each $i$, the subgroup $\\langle x^i y \\rangle$ is the same as $\\langle x^{i+32} y \\rangle$. The 64 elements of the form $x^k y$ come in pairs that generate the same subgroup.\nThe number of distinct subgroups is the number of such elements divided by the number of generators for each subgroup, which is $64 / 2 = 32$.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the results**\nWe have two sets of power subgroups:\n1.  The 7 subgroups contained entirely within $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n2.  The 32 subgroups generated by elements of the form $x^i y$.\n\nAre there any overlaps between these two sets?\nAny subgroup in the second set, like $\\langle x^i y \\rangle$, contains elements ($x^i y$ and $x^{i+32}y$) that are not powers of $x$ and thus are not in the subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$.\nAny subgroup in the first set is completely contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$.\nTherefore, the two sets of subgroups are disjoint.\n\nThe total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from these two disjoint sets.\nTotal number = (Number of subgroups from $\\langle x \\rangle$) + (Number of subgroups from elements $x^i y$)\nTotal number = 7 + 32 = 39.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n*   Correctly identified \"power subgroup\" as \"cyclic subgroup\".\n*   Correctly identified the structure of $Q_{128}$.\n*   Correctly counted the cyclic subgroups contained in $\\langle x \\rangle$ as $\\tau(64)=7$.\n*   Correctly determined the order of elements $x^i y$ to be 4.\n*   Correctly counted the number of distinct cyclic subgroups generated by these elements as $64/2=32$.\n*   Correctly concluded that the two sets of subgroups are disjoint.\n*   Correctly summed the counts to get the final answer. The analysis is sound.\n\nThe final answer is 39.\n\n<<<39>>>"
