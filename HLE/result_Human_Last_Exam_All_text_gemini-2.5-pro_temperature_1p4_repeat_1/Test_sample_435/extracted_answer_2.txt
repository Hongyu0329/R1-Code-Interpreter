Based on its role in promoting the survival of long-lived, less-differentiated memory T cells and preventing T cell exhaustion, it is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 will exhibit an **increased and more sustained release of effector cytokines** (such as IFN-γ and TNF-α) upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without it.
