    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Topology of the Feynman Diagram**\nThe question describes a Feynman diagram with the following properties:\n*   **Two vertices:** Let's call them $v_1$ and $v_2$. These represent interaction points in spacetime.\n*   **Four field contractions:** In a Feynman diagram, a field contraction is represented by a propagator, or a line.\nSince there are only two vertices in the diagram, all four propagators must connect these two vertices. This creates a diagram where $v_1$ is connected to $v_2$ by four distinct lines. This is sometimes called a \"setting-sun\" or \"double-scoop\" vacuum bubble diagram.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Symmetry Factor**\nThe symmetry factor, denoted by $S$, is a crucial concept in perturbative quantum field theory. It is an integer that corrects for the overcounting of topologically identical diagrams that arise from the application of Wick's theorem. Formally, it is the order of the automorphism group of the graph, which means it is the number of ways to permute the internal components (vertices and lines) of the diagram while leaving its overall structure (topology) unchanged.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Symmetries of the Diagram**\nWe need to count all the permutations of vertices and lines that leave the diagram looking the same.\n\n*   **Symmetry 1: Permutation of Identical Vertices**\n    *   The diagram has two vertices, $v_1$ and $v_2$.\n    *   In a typical theory (like $\\phi^4$ theory, which would generate such a diagram), all interaction vertices are identical.\n    *   If we swap the positions of $v_1$ and $v_2$, the diagram's topology remains unchanged. The four lines that previously connected $v_1$ to $v_2$ will now connect $v_2$ to $v_1$.\n    *   The number of ways to permute these two identical vertices is $2! = 2$.\n\n*   **Symmetry 2: Permutation of Identical Lines**\n    *   The diagram has four lines (propagators) connecting the two vertices.\n    *   Since these lines are all propagators for the same field, they are indistinguishable from one another.\n    *   We can permute these four lines among themselves in any way, and the diagram will be topologically identical. For example, swapping line 1 with line 2 results in the same diagram.\n    *   The number of ways to permute these four identical lines is $4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor**\nThe total symmetry factor $S$ is the product of the number of ways each independent symmetry operation can be performed.\n\n*   $S = (\\text{Number of vertex permutations}) \\times (\\text{Number of line permutations})$\n*   $S = (2!) \\times (4!)$\n*   $S = 2 \\times 24$\n*   $S = 48$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Indistinguishability:** The entire concept of a symmetry factor relies on the indistinguishability of identical components. We correctly assumed the two vertices are of the same type and the four propagators are also of the same type (e.g., all are for a scalar field $\\phi$). If they were different, the symmetry would be broken, and the factor would be smaller.\n2.  **Diagram Type:** The description is for an internal part of a larger calculation or a vacuum diagram. The calculation method for the symmetry factor is general. The result holds whether it's a vacuum bubble or a self-energy insertion, as long as the topology is two vertices connected by four lines.\n3.  **No Other Symmetries:** We have considered all possible symmetries for this graph. There are no self-loops on vertices (a line connecting a vertex to itself) and no other rotational symmetries beyond what is captured by permuting the lines. The identified symmetries form the complete set.\n4.  **Verification (Wick's Theorem approach):** The contribution of a diagram to the Green's function is proportional to $1/S$. In a theory with a $\\frac{\\lambda}{4!} \\phi^4$ interaction, the factor for this diagram comes from the second-order term $\\frac{1}{2!} (\\frac{-i\\lambda}{4!})^2$. The number of ways to contract the four fields at one vertex with the four at the other is $4!$. Combining these gives a numerical factor proportional to $\\frac{1}{2!} \\frac{1}{(4!)^2} \\times (4!) = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 4!} = \\frac{1}{48}$. Since this factor is $1/S$, this confirms that $S=48$.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe symmetry factor is the product of the factorial of the number of permutations for each set of identical components.\n*   Permutations of the 2 identical vertices = $2! = 2$.\n*   Permutations of the 4 identical lines = $4! = 24$.\n*   Total Symmetry Factor $S = 2! \\times 4! = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n<<<48>>>"
