    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hurwitz number.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem and translate it into a combinatorial problem.\n\nThe problem asks for a Hurwitz number, which counts the number of ramified covers between two Riemann surfaces with specific properties. Here, the cover is $f: \\mathbb{P}^1 \\to \\mathbb{P}^1$, so the genus of both the covering and base surface is 0.\n\nThe properties of the cover are:\n*   **Degree:** $d=7$.\n*   **Branch points:** There are $k=4$ branch points.\n*   **Ramification profiles:** The profiles are given as partitions of the degree $d=7$.\n    *   $\\mu_1 = (4,3)$\n    *   $\\mu_2 = (5,2)$\n    *   $\\mu_3 = (2,1,1,1,1,1) = (2, 1^5)$\n    *   $\\mu_4 = (2,1,1,1,1,1) = (2, 1^5)$\n\nThis counting problem can be translated into a problem of counting factorizations in the symmetric group $S_d$. The Hurwitz number is the number of tuples of permutations $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4)$ in $S_7$ satisfying:\n1.  **Cycle Type:** Each permutation $\\sigma_i$ belongs to the conjugacy class $C_{\\mu_i}$ corresponding to the ramification profile $\\mu_i$.\n2.  **Product Condition:** The product of the permutations is the identity element: $\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_3 \\sigma_4 = 1$.\n3.  **Transitivity Condition:** The group $G = \\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4 \\rangle$ generated by these permutations is a transitive subgroup of $S_7$.\n\nThe phrase \"respectively\" in the question implies that the branch points are distinguishable, so we count ordered tuples of permutations. The number of covers is equal to the number of such tuples, provided the automorphism group of each cover is trivial.\n\n### Step 2: Check the Riemann-Hurwitz formula.\nThe Riemann-Hurwitz formula relates the genera of the surfaces, the degree, and the ramification data:\n$2g(\\text{cover}) - 2 = d \\cdot (2g(\\text{base}) - 2) + \\sum_{i=1}^k \\text{codim}(\\mu_i)$, where $\\text{codim}(\\mu_i) = d - \\text{length}(\\mu_i)$.\nHere, $g(\\text{cover})=g(\\text{base})=0$ and $d=7$.\n$2(0) - 2 = 7 \\cdot (2(0) - 2) + \\sum \\text{codim}(\\mu_i)$\n$-2 = -14 + \\sum \\text{codim}(\\mu_i)$\nThe codimensions are:\n*   $\\text{codim}(\\mu_1) = 7 - 2 = 5$\n*   $\\text{codim}(\\mu_2) = 7 - 2 = 5$\n*   $\\text{codim}(\\mu_3) = 7 - 6 = 1$\n*   $\\text{codim}(\\mu_4) = 7 - 6 = 1$\nSum of codimensions = $5 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\nThe formula becomes $-2 = -14 + 12$, which is correct. This confirms the consistency of the given data for a genus 0 cover.\n\n### Step 3: Use character theory to count solutions.\nThe total number of tuples $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4)$ satisfying conditions 1 and 2 (ignoring transitivity for a moment) is given by the Frobenius-Schur formula:\n$$N = \\frac{|C_{\\mu_1}| |C_{\\mu_2}| |C_{\\mu_3}| |C_{\\mu_4}|}{|S_7|} \\sum_{\\chi \\in \\text{Irr}(S_7)} \\frac{\\chi(\\mu_1) \\chi(\\mu_2) \\chi(\\mu_3) \\chi(\\mu_4)}{\\chi(1)^{k-1}}$$\nwhere $k=4$ is the number of permutations, $\\chi(\\mu_i)$ is the value of the irreducible character $\\chi$ on the conjugacy class $C_{\\mu_i}$, and $\\chi(1)$ is the dimension of the representation for $\\chi$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the sizes of the conjugacy classes in $S_7$:\n*   $|C_{(4,3)}| = \\frac{7!}{4 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{5040}{12} = 420$.\n*   $|C_{(5,2)}| = \\frac{7!}{5 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{5040}{10} = 504$.\n*   $|C_{(2,1^5)}| = \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 6}{2} = 21$.\n\nThe formula for $N$ with $k=4$ becomes:\n$$N = \\frac{420 \\cdot 504 \\cdot 21^2}{5040} \\sum_{\\chi} \\frac{\\chi(4,3) \\chi(5,2) \\chi(2,1^5)^2}{\\chi(1)^3}$$\n\nWe need the character table of $S_7$. We list the characters that give a non-zero contribution to the sum. A character's contribution is zero if its value on any of the classes $C_{(4,3)}$ or $C_{(5,2)}$ is zero.\nThe characters $\\chi^\\lambda$ (indexed by partitions $\\lambda$ of 7) that have non-zero values on all the relevant classes are:\n[7], [4,3], [3,3,1], [3,2,2], [2,2,2,1], [1^7].\n\nThe character values are:\n| $\\lambda$ | $\\chi(1)$ | $\\chi(4,3)$ | $\\chi(5,2)$ | $\\chi(2,1^5)$ |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| [7] | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| [4,3] | 14 | 2 | -1 | 2 |\n| [3,3,1] | 21 | 1 | 1 | -3 |\n| [3,2,2] | 21 | -1 | -1 | -1 |\n| [2,2,2,1] | 14 | -2 | 1 | -6 |\n| [1^7] | 1 | -1 | -1 | -1 |\n\nNow, we compute the sum $S' = \\sum_{\\chi} \\frac{\\chi(4,3) \\chi(5,2) \\chi(2,1^5)^2}{\\chi(1)^3}$:\n*   $\\chi^{[7]}$: $\\frac{1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1^2}{1^3} = 1$\n*   $\\chi^{[4,3]}$: $\\frac{2 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 2^2}{14^3} = \\frac{-8}{2744} = -\\frac{1}{343}$\n*   $\\chi^{[3,3,1]}$: $\\frac{1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-3)^2}{21^3} = \\frac{9}{9261} = \\frac{1}{1029}$\n*   $\\chi^{[3,2,2]}$: $\\frac{(-1) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-1)^2}{21^3} = \\frac{1}{9261}$\n*   $\\chi^{[2,2,2,1]}$: $\\frac{(-2) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-6)^2}{14^3} = \\frac{-72}{2744} = -\\frac{9}{343}$\n*   $\\chi^{[1^7]}$: $\\frac{(-1) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-1)^2}{1^3} = 1$\n\n$S' = 1 - \\frac{1}{343} + \\frac{1}{1029} + \\frac{1}{9261} - \\frac{9}{343} + 1 = 2 - \\frac{10}{343} + \\frac{1}{1029} + \\frac{1}{9261}$\nThe least common multiple of the denominators is $9261 = 21^3 = 3^3 \\cdot 7^3$.\n$343 = 7^3$, so $9261/343 = 27$.\n$1029 = 3 \\cdot 7^3$, so $9261/1029 = 9$.\n$S' = \\frac{2 \\cdot 9261}{9261} - \\frac{10 \\cdot 27}{9261} + \\frac{1 \\cdot 9}{9261} + \\frac{1}{9261} = \\frac{18522 - 270 + 9 + 1}{9261} = \\frac{18262}{9261}$.\n\nNow, we calculate $N$:\n$N = \\frac{420 \\cdot 504 \\cdot 21^2}{5040} \\cdot S' = \\frac{420 \\cdot 504 \\cdot 441}{5040} \\cdot \\frac{18262}{9261}$\n$N = (\\frac{420}{5040}) \\cdot 504 \\cdot 441 \\cdot \\frac{18262}{9261} = \\frac{1}{12} \\cdot 504 \\cdot 441 \\cdot \\frac{18262}{9261}$\n$N = 42 \\cdot 441 \\cdot \\frac{18262}{9261} = 42 \\cdot \\frac{1}{21} \\cdot 18262 = 2 \\cdot 18262 = 36524$.\n\n### Step 4: Check the transitivity condition.\n\nLet $G = \\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4 \\rangle$. We need to ensure $G$ is transitive. We count the number of solutions $N_{intrans}$ that generate an intransitive group and subtract this from $N$.\nIf $G$ is intransitive, it has a non-trivial orbit structure on the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 7\\}$. An orbit partition must be preserved by all generators $\\sigma_i$.\nLet the partition of $\\{1, \\ldots, 7\\}$ into orbits be $O_1 \\cup O_2 \\cup \\ldots$. The cycle type of any $\\sigma_i$ must be compatible with this partition.\n*   $\\sigma_1$ has cycle type (4,3). This means $\\sigma_1$ has no fixed points. Thus, no orbit can have size 1.\n*   The cycles of $\\sigma_1$ themselves partition $\\{1, \\ldots, 7\\}$ into a set of 4 elements and a set of 3 elements. If $G$ were intransitive, its orbits would have to be a refinement of this partition. Since $\\{1,..,7\\}$ is the only union of these orbits, the only way $G$ could be intransitive is if its orbits are exactly these sets of size 4 and 3.\n*   Let's assume $G$ has orbits of size 4 and 3. This partition must be preserved by $\\sigma_2$. $\\sigma_2$ has cycle type (5,2). It is impossible for a permutation that preserves a partition into sets of size 4 and 3 to have a 5-cycle. A 5-cycle must act on 5 elements, which cannot be contained entirely in a set of size 4 or a set of size 3, nor can it be a combination of permutations on these sets.\n*   A similar argument holds for any other possible intransitive partition of 7 elements (e.g., (5,2), (6,1), (2,2,3), etc.). The cycle types (4,3) and (5,2) are incompatible with any non-trivial partition of $\\{1, \\ldots, 7\\}$.\n\nTherefore, any group $G$ containing a permutation of type (4,3) and another of type (5,2) must be transitive. This implies that all $N=36524$ solutions generate a transitive group. So, $N_{trans} = N$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\nThe number of covers is the number of such tuples of permutations, which is $N_{trans}$. The monodromy group generated by any solution is in fact $S_7$, whose centralizer is trivial. This means the automorphism group of each cover is trivial. So, the number of covers equals the number of tuples.\n\nFinal Answer = $36524$."
