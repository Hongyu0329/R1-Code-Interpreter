    "Answering this question requires combining several results from continuum theory and general topology.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the object of study:** We are analyzing the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, where $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum and $x$ is a point in $X$. Let $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ and let $R = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$ be its Stone-Cech remainder.\n\n2.  **Determine the basic topological properties of the remainder R:**\n    *   The space $X$ is a compact metric space. As $\\{x\\}$ is a closed set in $X$, its complement $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is an open subset of $X$.\n    *   An open subset of a compact Hausdorff space is locally compact. So, $Y$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\n    *   An open subset of a separable metric space (like the compact metric space $X$) is also a separable metric space. So, $Y$ is a locally compact, separable, metric space.\n    *   The remainder $R$ is a compact Hausdorff space. We can determine if it is metrizable. The remainder of a locally compact Hausdorff space is metrizable if and only if the space has a countable base of neighborhoods for its point(s) at infinity. For $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, the \"point at infinity\" corresponds to $x$. A countable base of neighborhoods for $x$ in $X$ is given by the open balls $B(x, 1/n)$. This provides a countable base of neighborhoods for the point at infinity in $Y$. Therefore, the remainder $R$ is a compact metrizable space.\n\n3.  **Determine the structure of R as a continuum:**\n    *   A continuum is a compact, connected metric space. We know $R$ is a compact metric space. Is it connected? A theorem by R. H. Bing states that a continuum is indecomposable if and only if every composant is a proper subset. Since no point of a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum is a cut point, $Y=X\\setminus\\{x\\}$ is connected.\n    *   Furthermore, a key theorem by J. W. Rogers, Jr. (1970) states that if $M$ is a compact metric indecomposable continuum and $p \\in M$, then the remainder $\\beta(M \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\setminus (M \\setminus \\{p\\})$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n    *   Since $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable continuum, it is also an indecomposable continuum. Applying Rogers's theorem, we conclude that the remainder $R$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n    *   Combining results from steps 2 and 3, $R$ is an indecomposable metric continuum.\n\n4.  **Analyze the number of composants of R:**\n    *   The term \"composant\" is defined for indecomposable continua. An indecomposable metric continuum can be either degenerate (consisting of a single point) or non-degenerate.\n    *   If $R$ is degenerate (a single point), it has only one component. By a natural convention, we can say it has 1 composant, as the point forms a component by itself.\n    *   If $R$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum, a classical theorem by S. Mazurkiewicz (1930) states that it has exactly $c$ (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., $2^{\\aleph_0}$) composants. All composants are dense and pairwise disjoint.\n    *   Therefore, the number of composants of $R$ can be either 1 or $c$.\n\n5.  **Address the \"maximum possible\" part of the question:**\n    *   To find the maximum possible number of composants, we need to determine if the case where $R$ is non-degenerate can actually occur for some choice of $X$. If it can, the maximum number will be $c$. If $R$ must always be a single point, the answer would be 1.\n    *   We need an example. The pseudo-arc is the most famous example of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum.\n    *   A theorem by Marcellus Smith (1986, cited by W. Lewis) states that if $X$ is a pseudo-arc and $x \\in X$, then the remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is also a pseudo-arc.\n    *   The pseudo-arc is a non-degenerate continuum. Thus, for this choice of $X$, the remainder $R$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   We have established that it is possible for the remainder $R$ to be a non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum (e.g., a pseudo-arc).\n    *   In this case, the number of its composants is $c$.\n    *   Since the only possible values for the number of composants are 1 and $c$, the maximum possible number is $c$.\n\nThe maximum possible number of composants is $c$, the cardinality of the continuum."
