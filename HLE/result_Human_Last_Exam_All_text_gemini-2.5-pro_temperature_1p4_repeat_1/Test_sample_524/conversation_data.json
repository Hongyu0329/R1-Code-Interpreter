    "To answer the question \"How many homeomorphism classes are there of homogeneous planar continua?\", we must first understand the terms involved and then refer to the relevant classification theorems in topology.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Terminology\n\n*   **Continuum:** In topology, a continuum is a non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. Since we are considering planar continua, these are subsets of the Euclidean plane ($\\mathbb{R}^2$) that are closed, bounded, and connected.\n*   **Planar:** A topological space is planar if it can be embedded in the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This means it is homeomorphic to a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. All the spaces we consider are already subsets of the plane.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space $X$ is homogeneous if for any two points $x, y \\in X$, there exists a homeomorphism (a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse) $h: X \\to X$ such that $h(x) = y$. Intuitively, this means the space \"looks the same\" at every point. No point is topologically distinguishable from any other.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** This is a collection of all topological spaces that are homeomorphic to each other. We are asked for the *number* of these classes, meaning we need to find all the topologically distinct examples of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of Potential Candidates\n\nWe are looking for compact, connected, homogeneous subsets of the plane.\n\n1.  **The Point:**\n    *   A single point is a compact and connected subset of the plane.\n    *   It is trivially homogeneous because for any two points $x, y$ (which must be the same point), the identity map works.\n    *   This is the simplest case, known as a **degenerate continuum**. It forms one homeomorphism class.\n\n2.  **The Circle (Simple Closed Curve):**\n    *   The circle is a compact and connected subset of the plane.\n    *   It is homogeneous: any point can be mapped to any other point via a rotation of the circle, which is a homeomorphism of the circle onto itself.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A closed line segment is a continuum, but it is *not* homogeneous. Its two endpoints are topologically different from its interior points. Similarly, a closed disk is not homogeneous because a boundary point cannot be mapped to an interior point by a homeomorphism of the disk. The circle is the only homogeneous planar continuum that is also **locally connected**. This was proven by S. Mazurkiewicz in 1920.\n\n3.  **Non-Locally Connected Cases:** The classification becomes much more complex if we do not require local connectedness. The search for these objects was a major research program in 20th-century topology.\n\n    *   **The Pseudo-Arc:**\n        *   This is a famous and bizarre continuum first described by B. Knaster in 1922. R. H. Bing and E. Moise independently proved in the late 1940s that it is homogeneous.\n        *   It is a planar continuum that is \"snake-like\" and indecomposable (it cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua).\n        *   It is not locally connected at any of its points.\n        *   Bing proved that any two pseudo-arcs are homeomorphic, so they all belong to a single homeomorphism class.\n        *   **Careful Point:** The pseudo-arc does not separate the plane.\n\n    *   **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:**\n        *   This is another homogeneous planar continuum. It can be visualized as taking a circle and replacing each point with a pseudo-arc in a continuous way.\n        *   Like the pseudo-arc, it is not locally connected.\n        *   Unlike the pseudo-arc, it is decomposable.\n        *   **Careful Point:** Unlike the pseudo-arc, the circle of pseudo-arcs *does* separate the plane into two regions (an \"inside\" and an \"outside\"), just as a standard circle does. This property makes it topologically distinct from the pseudo-arc.\n\n### Step 3: The Classification Theorem\n\nThe question of whether this list was complete was a major open problem for decades. It was finally solved in 1991 by L. G. Oversteegen and E. D. Tymchatyn. Their classification theorem states that every homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to one of the four objects discussed above.\n\n### Step 4: Final List and Conclusion\n\nBased on the complete classification, there are exactly four distinct homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua. They are distinct for the following reasons:\n\n1.  **The Point:** The only 0-dimensional one (a degenerate continuum).\n2.  **The Circle:** The only non-degenerate one that is locally connected.\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc:** Not locally connected, indecomposable, and does not separate the plane.\n4.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** Not locally connected, decomposable, and separates the plane.\n\nSince these four classes exhaust all possibilities and are topologically distinct from one another, the total number of homeomorphism classes is four.\n\n<<<4>>>"
