The edges of the image are progressively smoothed out. Sharp corners are rounded, with convex corners being eroded and concave corners being filled in. Any small features or thin lines with a size smaller than the filter radius $\delta$ are eliminated. The process continues until the image converges to a fixed point where all remaining edges have a radius of curvature that is everywhere greater than or equal to $\delta$.
