A threshold signature scheme is designed based on the linear properties of Schnorr signatures, which allows for the distribution of the signing process. The design is structured into two phases: a one-time Distributed Key Generation (DKG) setup and a repeatable two-round signing protocol.

**Phase 1: Setup (Distributed Key Generation)**
A `(t, n)` Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme like Pedersen DKG is used. All `n` parties jointly create a single group public key `Y=g^x` and their individual public verification keys `Y_i=g^{x_i}`, while each party `P_i` privately holds a secret share `x_i` of the main secret `x`. The full secret `x` is never reconstructed or known by any single entity.

**Phase 2: Two-Round Signing Protocol**
When a subset `S` of `t` parties needs to sign a message `m`:

*   **Round 1 (Commitment):**
    1.  Each participating party `P_i` (`i âˆˆ S`) generates a fresh, secret random nonce `k_i`.
    2.  Each party computes a public commitment to their nonce: `R_i = g^{k_i}`.
    3.  Each party broadcasts `R_i` to t
