    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the thickness of the double point.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the setup**\n\n*   **Curve:** $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. This is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g=2$.\n*   **Valuation:** We are considering the reduction of this curve over the 2-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The valuation $v$ is normalized such that $v(2)=1$. The ring of integers is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   **Reduction of the given model:** The equation over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is $z^2 = 1$, or $(z-1)^2 = 0$. This is a double line, which is a highly singular reduction. To find the stable reduction, we may need to change the model and possibly extend the base field.\n*   **Thickness:** The question implies that the special fiber of the stable model of the curve has a double point (a node). The thickness is an integer invariant $m$ associated with this node, where the local equation of the curve at the node is of the form $uv=t^m$, where $t$ is a uniformizing parameter of the discrete valuation ring over which the stable model is defined.\n\n**Step 2: Find the correct model and field extension**\n\nTo find the stable reduction, we analyze the valuations of the roots of the polynomial $P(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$.\nWe use the Newton polygon method for $P(x)$ with respect to the 2-adic valuation $v$. The vertices of the polygon correspond to the terms of the polynomial. We plot points $(i, v(c_i))$ where $c_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$.\nThe coefficients are $c_5=2, c_3=2, c_0=1$. The points are $(5, v(2))=(5,1)$, $(3, v(2))=(3,1)$, and $(0, v(1))=(0,0)$.\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points consists of a single segment connecting $(0,0)$ to $(5,1)$. Let's check for any intermediate points. Consider a translation of coordinates $x \\to x+a$. A good choice for the shift is often a root of the derivative $P'(x) = 10x^4+6x^2$. However, this complicates the analysis without changing the fundamental nature of the valuations.\nA more direct approach is to find the correct scaling of $x$. Let $x=2^k y$. Let's determine $k$. Let $v(x) = \\alpha$. Then the valuations of the terms in $2x^5+2x^3+1=0$ are $v(2x^5) = 1+5\\alpha$, $v(2x^3) = 1+3\\alpha$, and $v(1)=0$. For a solution to exist, the minimum of these valuations must be achieved at least twice.\nIf $\\alpha \\ge 0$, the minimum is $v(1)=0$, which is unique. This is impossible.\nIf $\\alpha < 0$, the minimum is $1+5\\alpha$. It must be equal to one of the other valuations.\n$1+5\\alpha = 1+3\\alpha \\implies 2\\alpha=0 \\implies \\alpha=0$, contradiction.\n$1+5\\alpha = 0 \\implies \\alpha=-1/5$.\nThis implies that all 5 roots of $P(x)$ have 2-adic valuation $-1/5$. This requires passing to a ramified extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. Let $K' = \\mathbb{Q}_2(\\pi)$ where $\\pi^5 = 2$. $K'$ is a totally ramified extension of degree 5, and $\\pi$ is a uniformizer for its ring of integers $R' = \\mathbb{Z}_2[\\pi]$. The valuation $v'$ on $K'$ can be normalized as $v'(\\pi)=1$, which means $v'(2)=v'(\\pi^5)=5$. This is related to the original valuation by $v(a) = v'(a)/5$ for $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\nThe valuation of the roots being $-1/5$ suggests the change of coordinates $x = \\pi^{-1} X$.\nSubstituting this into the curve equation:\n$z^2 = 2(\\pi^{-1}X)^5 + 2(\\pi^{-1}X)^3 + 1$\n$z^2 = 2\\pi^{-5}X^5 + 2\\pi^{-3}X^3 + 1$\nSince $\\pi^5=2$, this simplifies to:\n$z^2 = X^5 + \\pi^2 X^3 + 1$\nThis is a new model for the curve, defined over the ring $R'=\\mathbb{Z}_2[\\pi]$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the special fiber of the new model**\n\nThe special fiber is obtained by reducing the equation modulo the maximal ideal $(\\pi)$ of $R'$.\nThe reduction is:\n$\\bar{z}^2 = \\bar{X}^5 + 1$\nIn the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$, this is $\\bar{z}^2 = (\\bar{X}+1)(\\bar{X}^4+1) = (\\bar{X}+1)(\\bar{X}+1)^4 = (\\bar{X}+1)^5$.\nThe special fiber is an irreducible curve with a singularity. The singular point occurs where the partial derivatives vanish.\n$2\\bar{z}=0$ (always in $\\mathbb{F}_2$).\n$5\\bar{X}^4 = \\bar{X}^4=0 \\implies \\bar{X}=0$. Whoops, derivative of $X^5+1$ is $5X^4$. In $\\mathbb{F}_2$ this is $X^4$. The singularity is at $X=0$, so $z=1$. But the equation is $z^2=(X+1)^5$. So derivative is $5(X+1)^4=(X+1)^4=0$, which implies $X=1$. Then $z=0$. The singular point is $(\\bar{X},\\bar{z})=(1,0)$.\nThis is a cusp, not a node. The model is not yet the stable model. We need to resolve this singularity.\n\n**Step 4: Resolve the singularity and find the thickness**\n\nWe perform a blow-up of the model scheme at a point lying over the singular point $(\\bar{X},\\bar{z})=(1,0)$ of the special fiber. Let's analyze the model in local coordinates around this point. Let $X_1 = X-1$ and $z_1 = z$.\nThe equation $z^2 = X^5 + \\pi^2 X^3 + 1$ becomes:\n$z_1^2 = (X_1+1)^5 + \\pi^2(X_1+1)^3 + 1$\n$z_1^2 = (1+5X_1+10X_1^2+\\dots) + \\pi^2(1+3X_1+3X_1^2+\\dots) + 1$\n$z_1^2 = (2+\\pi^2) + (5+3\\pi^2)X_1 + (10+3\\pi^2)X_1^2 + \\dots$\n\nA single blow-up at the origin of the $(X_1, z_1)$ coordinates resolves this into a node. The blow-up is defined by a new chart with coordinates $(x_2, z_2)$ such that $X_1 = x_2 z_2$ and $z_1=z_2$. Substituting this into the local equation:\n$z_2^2 = (2+\\pi^2) + (5+3\\pi^2)x_2 z_2 + (10+3\\pi^2)(x_2 z_2)^2 + \\dots$\nRearranging the terms:\n$z_2^2 - (5+3\\pi^2)x_2 z_2 - (10+3\\pi^2)x_2^2 z_2^2 - \\dots - (2+\\pi^2) = 0$\nThe special fiber of this blown-up model is found by setting $\\pi=0$ (note that $2=\\pi^5$):\n$z_2^2 - 5x_2 z_2 - 10x_2^2 z_2^2 - \\dots = 0 \\pmod \\pi$\n$z_2 (z_2 - 5x_2 - 10x_2^2 z_2 - \\dots) = 0$\nIn the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$, this becomes $z_2(z_2-x_2-\\dots)=0$. The two components are locally $z_2=0$ and $z_2-x_2=0$. These are distinct lines meeting transversally at the origin $(x_2, z_2) = (0,0)$. This is the ordinary double point (node) we are looking for.\n\nTo find the thickness, we write the local equation of the model in the form $uv = t^m$.\nLet's define $u=z_2$. The equation is:\n$u^2 - (5+3\\pi^2)x_2 u - \\dots = (2+\\pi^2)$\n$u (u - (5+3\\pi^2)x_2 - \\dots) = 2+\\pi^2$\nLet $v = u - (5+3\\pi^2)x_2 - \\dots$. The functions $u$ and $v$ form a valid local coordinate system at the node because their Jacobian determinant is a unit.\nThe equation for the curve in this new local coordinate system $(u,v)$ is:\n$uv = 2+\\pi^2$\nSince we are working over $R'=\\mathbb{Z}_2[\\pi]$, we evaluate the right hand side:\n$2+\\pi^2 = \\pi^5+\\pi^2 = \\pi^2(1+\\pi^3)$.\nThe term $(1+\\pi^3)$ is a unit in $R'$ because $\\pi$ is in the maximal ideal, so $1+\\pi^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod \\pi$. We can absorb this unit into one of the coordinates, for instance by defining $v' = v / (1+\\pi^3)$. The equation becomes:\n$uv' = \\pi^2$\nThe base ring is the DVR $R'$, whose uniformizer is $t=\\pi$. The equation is in the form $uv' = t^2$. By definition, the thickness is the exponent $m=2$.\n\nThe phrase \"with respect to the valuation v normalized to v(2)=1\" serves to define the 2-adic context of the problem. The thickness itself is an integer invariant of the geometry of the stable model, defined with respect to the uniformizer of the ring over which this model exists ($R'$ in this case)."
