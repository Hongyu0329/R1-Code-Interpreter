    "An isometric embedding of a metric space $(X, d_X)$ into a metric space $(Y, d_Y)$ is a function $f: X \\to Y$ that preserves distances, i.e., for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, we have $d_Y(f(x_1), f(x_2)) = d_X(x_1, x_2)$. The question asks for the smallest possible number of such embeddings, where $X$ is a finite ultrametric space and $B$ is a Banach space of cardinality $K$.\n\nLet's break down the problem and analyze it step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the nature of the spaces involved.**\n*   **A finite ultrametric space $X$**: This is a finite set equipped with a metric $d$ that satisfies the strong triangle inequality: $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$ for all $x, y, z \\in X$.\n*   **A Banach space $B$**: This is a complete normed vector space. The norm $||\\cdot||$ induces a metric $d_B(u, v) = ||u - v||$. The cardinality $K$ of a Banach space over the real or complex numbers is either 1 (for the trivial space $B = \\{0\\}$) or at least $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the question mathematically.**\nWe are looking for the value of:\n$\\min \\{ N(X, B) \\mid X \\text{ is a finite ultrametric space, and } B \\text{ is a Banach space of cardinality } K \\}$\nwhere $N(X, B)$ is the number of isometric embeddings from $X$ into $B$. Since the number of embeddings must be a non-negative integer, we are looking for the smallest non-negative integer that $N(X, B)$ can be for some choice of $X$ and $B$. The smallest possible non-negative integer is 0.\n\n**Step 3: Determine if the number of embeddings can be 0.**\nTo see if 0 is a possible value for $N(X, B)$, we need to check if there exist a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ such that there are no isometric embeddings of $X$ into $B$. This is equivalent to finding an example of a finite ultrametric space that cannot be isometrically embedded into a particular Banach space.\n\nLet's construct such an example.\n\n*   **Choose the finite ultrametric space $X$**:\n    Let $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$ be a set of three points.\n    Define the distance function $d$ on $X$ as follows:\n    $d(x_i, x_i) = 0$ for all $i$.\n    $d(x_1, x_2) = 2$\n    $d(x_2, x_3) = 2$\n    $d(x_1, x_3) = 2$\n    This is a valid metric space. It is also an ultrametric space because the strong triangle inequality holds. For any distinct triple of points (which is just $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$), we must check inequalities like $d(x_1, x_3) \\le \\max(d(x_1, x_2), d(x_2, x_3))$. This becomes $2 \\le \\max(2, 2)$, which is true.\n\n*   **Choose the Banach space $B$**:\n    Let $B = \\mathbb{R}$, the space of real numbers with the standard norm (absolute value), $||y|| = |y|$. This is a Banach space. Its cardinality is $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$, so this choice corresponds to $K=c$.\n\n*   **Check for isometric embeddings**:\n    An isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$ would require finding three points $y_1, y_2, y_3 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that the distances between them match the distances in $X$.\n    $||f(x_1) - f(x_2)|| = |y_1 - y_2| = d(x_1, x_2) = 2$\n    $||f(x_2) - f(x_3)|| = |y_2 - y_3| = d(x_2, x_3) = 2$\n    $||f(x_1) - f(x_3)|| = |y_1 - y_3| = d(x_1, x_3) = 2$\n    Let's see if such points can exist in $\\mathbb{R}$. The points $y_1, y_2, y_3$ must lie on the real line. Let's order them, without loss of generality, as $y_1 < y_2 < y_3$.\n    From $|y_1 - y_2| = 2$ and $y_1 < y_2$, we get $y_2 - y_1 = 2$.\n    From $|y_2 - y_3| = 2$ and $y_2 < y_3$, we get $y_3 - y_2 = 2$.\n    The distance between $y_1$ and $y_3$ is then $y_3 - y_1 = (y_3 - y_2) + (y_2 - y_1) = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n    So, we must have $|y_1 - y_3| = 4$.\n    However, the condition for the embedding is that $|y_1 - y_3| = 2$. Since $4 \\neq 2$, this is a contradiction.\n    Any other ordering of the points on the line leads to a similar contradiction. Thus, there are no three points in $\\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy these distance conditions.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion.**\nWe have found a specific finite ultrametric space $X$ and a specific Banach space $B$ for which the number of isometric embeddings, $N(X, B)$, is 0. Since the number of embeddings cannot be negative, the smallest possible value is 0. This argument holds for any cardinality $K$ for which a suitable Banach space can be chosen (e.g. one-dimensional spaces like $\\mathbb{R}$). For $K=1$, $B=\\{0\\}$, we can choose $X=\\{x_1, x_2\\}$ with $d(x_1, x_2)=1$. The only map sends both points to 0, giving a distance of 0, which is not 1. So again, there are 0 embeddings.\n\nThus, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 0."
