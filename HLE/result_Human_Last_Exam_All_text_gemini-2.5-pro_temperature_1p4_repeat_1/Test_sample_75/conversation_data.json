    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Event and Timeframe:** The \"Second Great War\" refers to the primary conflict in the *StarCraft II* saga. We need to identify its start and end points according to established StarCraft lore.\n    *   **Start of the War:** The war is widely accepted to begin with the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty*. Official timelines, such as the one from the Blizzard Gear store poster and the StarCraft Wiki, place the start of this campaign in the year **2504**. This is when the Zerg Swarm, seemingly leaderless, renews its invasion of the Koprulu Sector.\n    *   **End of the War:** The war concludes with the defeat of the main antagonist, the fallen Xel'naga Amon. This happens in the epilogue campaign of *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void*, titled *Into the Void*. The lore places these final events in the year **2506**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Duration:**\n    *   The war began in **2504** and ended in **2506**.\n    *   This means the conflict was active during three distinct calendar years: 2504, 2505, and 2506.\n    *   The exact start date in 2504 and end date in 2506 are not specified in the lore. This prevents a precise calculation of the elapsed time down to the day. However, we can determine a logical range for the duration.\n    *   Let's denote the duration as *D*.\n        *   **Minimum Possible Duration:** If the war started on the last day of 2504 and ended on the first day of 2506, the duration would be 1 year and 2 days.\n        *   **Maximum Possible Duration:** If the war started on the first day of 2504 and ended on the last day of 2506, the duration would be just shy of 3 full years.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Plausibility:**\n    *   The events of the three campaigns (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, *Legacy of the Void*) are galaxy-spanning and involve significant time for travel, battles, regrouping, and consolidating forces.\n    *   For example, *Wings of Liberty* involves Raynor's Raiders conducting numerous missions across the sector. *Heart of the Swarm* sees Kerrigan travel to the Zerg homeworld of Zerus and back. *Legacy of the Void* has Artanis uniting disparate Protoss factions with the Golden Armada.\n    *   Given the scale of these events, it is highly probable that the total duration was significantly more than one year and very likely more than two full years. For instance, a plausible timeline would be the war starting in early 2504 and concluding in mid-to-late 2506, resulting in a duration of over 2.5 years.\n\n4.  **Apply the Rounding Rule:**\n    *   The question explicitly asks for the duration \"in years, rounded up\". This means we must use the ceiling function (i.e., if a value is any fraction greater than a whole number, it rounds up to the next whole number).\n    *   For example: `Ceiling(2.0) = 2`. `Ceiling(2.1) = 3`. `Ceiling(2.9) = 3`.\n    *   Since our analysis indicates the most plausible duration is a value greater than 2.0 years (e.g., ~2.5 years), rounding this value up results in 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ambiguity of Dates:** The lore provides years but not specific months or days. The final answer must account for this by relying on logical inference based on the span of years and the scope of events.\n*   **\"Rounded Up\" vs. \"Standard Rounding\":** The instruction to \"round up\" is critical. If the duration were, for example, 2.2 years, standard rounding would yield 2, but rounding up yields 3.\n*   **\"Span of Years\" vs. \"Elapsed Time\":** The war spans three calendar years (2504, 2505, 2506). While the precise elapsed time is not exactly 3 years, counting the number of active years is a simple and logical interpretation that leads to the same final answer after rounding up.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe Second Great War started in 2504 and ended in 2506, spanning three calendar years. The narrative scope of the conflict strongly suggests a total elapsed time of over two full years. When this duration (any value greater than 2.0) is rounded up, the result is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
