    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible number of components of the intersection.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem Statement\nLet S be the unit square, `[0, 1] x [0, 1]`. We are given two sets, A and B, with the following properties:\n1.  **Closed:** A and B both contain all their limit points.\n2.  **Connected:** Neither A nor B can be expressed as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. Intuitively, they are each in one \"piece\".\n3.  **Union is the unit square:** `A U B = S`.\n\nWe want to find the maximum possible number of connected components of the intersection, `A ∩ B`.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Thoughts and Simple Cases\n- If `A = [0, 1/2] x [0, 1]` and `B = [1/2, 1] x [0, 1]`, both are closed and connected, and their union is the square S. Their intersection is the line segment `{1/2} x [0, 1]`, which has **one** connected component.\n- If `A = S`, and `B` is any closed connected subset of S (e.g., a line segment), then `A U B = S`. The intersection is `A ∩ B = B`, which is connected by definition. This also gives **one** component.\n\nThese simple examples might suggest the answer is always 1. However, the question asks for the *largest* number, implying that more complex configurations can yield more components.\n\n### Step 3: A Flawed Application of Algebraic Topology\nOne might be tempted to use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence from algebraic topology, which relates the homology of `A U B` to the homologies of A, B, and `A ∩ B`. For the 0th homology group `H_0` (which counts path-connected components), a simplified version of the sequence is:\n`... -> H_1(A U B) -> H_0(A ∩ B) -> H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) -> H_0(A U B) -> 0`\n\nGiven that A, B, and S (`A U B`) are connected, the rank of their `H_0` groups is 1. The sequence suggests that the number of components of `A ∩ B` should be `rank(H_0(A)) + rank(H_0(B)) - rank(H_0(A U B)) + rank(Im(δ)) = 1 + 1 - 1 + ... = 1 + ...`. If `A U B = S` was simply connected (`H_1(S) = 0`), this would lead to the conclusion that `A ∩ B` must be connected.\n\n**Careful point:** The standard Mayer-Vietoris sequence requires that the union of the *interiors* of A and B covers the space (`Int(A) U Int(B) = S`). This condition is not given in the problem and can be violated. The failure of this condition is precisely what allows for more complex intersections.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing an Example with an Arbitrary Finite Number of Components\nWe can construct examples where the intersection has any finite number of components, `n`.\n\nLet's construct an example for `n=2` components.\n- Let `B` be the union of two disjoint closed disks, `D_1` and `D_2`, inside the square. This set is not connected. To make it connected, we add a thin path `P` connecting their boundaries, ensuring `P` does not enter the disks' interiors. So, `B = D_1 U D_2 U P`. This set is closed and connected.\n- Now, let `A = Cl(S \\ B)`. The set `S \\ B` is the square minus the two disks and the path. This set is connected. Therefore, its closure `A` is also a closed and connected set.\n- By construction, `A U B = S`.\n- The intersection is `A ∩ B = Cl(S \\ B) ∩ B`, which is precisely the boundary of B, `∂B`. The boundary of `B` consists of the two circles `∂D_1` and `∂D_2`. The path `P` is contained in `B`, so its interior points are not on the boundary. The endpoints of `P` are on the circles. So, `∂B = ∂D_1 U ∂D_2`. These are two disjoint circles.\n- Therefore, `A ∩ B` has **two** components.\n\nThis process can be generalized to any finite number `n` of disks, showing that the intersection can have at least `n` components for any finite `n`. This means there is no finite upper bound on the number of components.\n\n### Step 5: Constructing an Example with Infinitely Many Components\nSince any finite number is possible, we explore if an infinite number of components is achievable. We can do this using a construction based on \"Voronoi-like\" partitioning of the square.\n\n1.  **Define two \"skeletons\":**\n    *   Let `K_1` be a \"comb\" structure. For instance, `K_1 = ({0} x [0, 1/2]) U (U_{n=1 to ∞} {1/n} x [0, 1/2])`. This set consists of a vertical spine on the y-axis and infinitely many \"teeth\" approaching it. `K_1` is a compact (closed and bounded) and connected set.\n    *   Let `K_2` be a simple shape disjoint from `K_1`. For example, let `K_2` be the top edge of the square, `[0, 1] x {1}`. This is also compact and connected.\n\n2.  **Partition the square:**\n    *   Let `d(p, K)` be the standard Euclidean distance from a point `p` to a set `K`.\n    *   Define `A = {p ∈ S | d(p, K_1) ≤ d(p, K_2)}`. This is the set of points in the square that are closer to (or equidistant from) `K_1` than `K_2`.\n    *   Define `B = {p ∈ S | d(p, K_2) ≤ d(p, K_1)}`. This is the set of points closer to (or equidistant from) `K_2`.\n\n3.  **Verify the properties of A and B:**\n    *   **Closed:** The distance function `d(p, K)` is continuous. Therefore `f(p) = d(p, K_1) - d(p, K_2)` is a continuous function. `A` is the preimage of `(-∞, 0]` and `B` is the preimage of `[0, ∞)`. Since these intervals are closed, `A` and `B` are closed.\n    *   **Union is S:** Every point `p` satisfies either `d(p, K_1) ≤ d(p, K_2)` or `d(p, K_1) ≥ d(p, K_2)`, so `A U B = S`.\n    *   **Connected:** Since `K_1` is connected, one can show that `A` is also connected. (Any point in `A` can be connected by a path within `A` to `K_1`, and `K_1` itself is connected). The same reasoning applies to `B` (since `K_2` is connected).\n\n4.  **Analyze the intersection `A ∩ B`:**\n    *   The intersection `A ∩ B` is the set of points equidistant from `K_1` and `K_2`: `A ∩ B = {p ∈ S | d(p, K_1) = d(p, K_2)}`.\n    *   Consider the open \"channels\" between the teeth of the comb `K_1`. For each integer `n≥1`, there is a channel `G_n = (1/(n+1), 1/n) x (0, 1)`.\n    *   Inside each channel `G_n`, there will be a curve of points that are equidistant from the boundaries of that channel (the `n`-th and `n+1`-th teeth of `K_1`) and the set `K_2`. This curve forms a connected component of `A ∩ B`.\n    *   These curves, one for each channel `G_n`, are separated from each other by the teeth of the comb `K_1`. The teeth themselves belong to `A`, not the intersection (since points on the teeth are at zero distance from `K_1` but a positive distance from `K_2`).\n    *   Therefore, `A ∩ B` contains a separate, disjoint component for each of the infinitely many channels `G_n`.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nThe construction in Step 5 demonstrates that it is possible for the intersection `A ∩ B` to have a countably infinite number of connected components. The number of components of a subspace of the plane cannot be uncountably infinite (as the plane is a separable space). Thus, the largest possible number of components is countably infinite."
