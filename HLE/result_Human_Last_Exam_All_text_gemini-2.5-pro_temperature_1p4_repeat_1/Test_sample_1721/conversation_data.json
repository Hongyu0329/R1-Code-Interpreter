    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest number $c$.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to find the largest constant $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, 2, ..., N\\}$ with a size of approximately $cN$ (formally, $|A| = (c+o(1))N$) for which the sumset $A+A = \\{a_1 + a_2 \\mid a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ contains no perfect square numbers.\n\nThe condition is that for any pair of elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$ (where $a_1$ and $a_2$ can be the same), their sum $a_1 + a_2$ is never a perfect square. The elements of $A$ are from $\\{1, ..., N\\}$, so their sum lies in the range $[2, 2N]$.\n\n**Step 2: Constructing a Set A to Find a Lower Bound for c**\n\nA powerful method to construct such a set $A$ is to use modular arithmetic. The idea is to find a modulus $m$ such that there is a residue class modulo $m$ which is \"sum-proof\" against squares.\n\nLet's test small values of $m$.\nLet's define $S_m = \\{k^2 \\pmod m \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ as the set of square residues modulo $m$.\n\n*   **Case m = 2:**\n    The squares modulo 2 are $0^2 \\equiv 0$ and $1^2 \\equiv 1$. So, $S_2 = \\{0, 1\\}$. All residues are squares, so this modulus is not useful on its own.\n\n*   **Case m = 3:**\n    The squares modulo 3 are $0^2 \\equiv 0$, $1^2 \\equiv 1$, and $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 1$. So, $S_3 = \\{0, 1\\}$. The residue $2$ is not a square modulo 3.\n    This is a promising observation. Let's try to construct a set $A$ where all sums $a_1+a_2$ are congruent to $2 \\pmod 3$.\n    Let's choose $A$ to be the set of all numbers in $\\{1, ..., N\\}$ that are congruent to a specific residue $r \\pmod 3$.\n    $A = \\{k \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} \\mid k \\equiv r \\pmod 3\\}$.\n    If we pick any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, they both satisfy $a_1 \\equiv r \\pmod 3$ and $a_2 \\equiv r \\pmod 3$. Their sum will be $a_1 + a_2 \\equiv 2r \\pmod 3$.\n    We want $2r \\pmod 3$ to be a non-square residue. In this case, we need $2r \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\n    Solving for $r$: $2r \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3 \\implies r \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n    So, let's define our set $A$ as:\n    $A = \\{k \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} \\mid k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$.\n    For any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, we have $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 1+1=2 \\pmod 3$.\n    Since any perfect square $s=k^2$ must be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3, and never 2, the sum $a_1+a_2$ can never be a perfect square.\n    The size of this set $A$ is approximately $N/3$. More precisely, $|A| = \\lfloor\\frac{N-1}{3}\\rfloor + 1 = \\frac{N}{3} + O(1)$.\n    This means $|A| = (\\frac{1}{3} + o(1))N$.\n    This construction shows that a value of $c \\ge 1/3$ is achievable.\n\n*   **Case m = 4:**\n    The squares modulo 4 are $0^2 \\equiv 0$, $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 0$, $3^2=9\\equiv 1$. So, $S_4 = \\{0, 1\\}$. The non-square residues are 2 and 3.\n    We need $2r \\pmod 4$ to be in $\\{2, 3\\}$.\n    - If $r=1$, $2r=2$, which is a non-square. So $A = \\{k \\in \\{1,...,N\\} \\mid k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4\\}$ works. This gives $|A| \\approx N/4$.\n    - If $r=3$, $2r=6\\equiv 2$, which is a non-square. So $A = \\{k \\in \\{1,...,N\\} \\mid k \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4\\}$ works. This gives $|A| \\approx N/4$.\n    Both these constructions yield $c \\ge 1/4$, which is not better than the $c \\ge 1/3$ we found with $m=3$.\n\n*   **Generalizing the modular construction:**\n    We could try to take $A$ as the set of numbers in $\\{1, ..., N\\}$ whose residues modulo $m$ fall into a set $C \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_m$. The condition would be that the sumset $C+C = \\{c_1+c_2 \\pmod m \\mid c_1, c_2 \\in C\\}$ contains no square residues modulo $m$. The density achieved is $|C|/m$.\n    For example, for $m=12$, the squares are $S_{12}=\\{0,1,4,9\\}$. We can find a set $C=\\{1,4,7,10\\}$. The sumset is $C+C=\\{2,5,8,11\\}$, which contains no squares modulo 12. The density is $|C|/12 = 4/12 = 1/3$. This seems like a new construction, but the set of integers congruent to {1, 4, 7, 10} modulo 12 is exactly the set of integers congruent to 1 modulo 3. So this is the same construction.\n\nThese constructions suggest that the maximum value for $c$ might be $1/3$.\n\n**Step 3: Establishing the Upper Bound**\n\nThe question now is whether it is possible to achieve a density $c > 1/3$. This involves proving an upper bound on $c$.\nProving that $c \\le 1/3$ is a significantly harder task. It is a known result in additive number theory, attributed to I. Z. Ruzsa (unpublished) and also mentioned by Deshouillers, Erdős, and Sárközy.\nThe proof is non-elementary and typically uses methods from analytic number theory, such as the circle method or Fourier analysis on finite groups. The core idea of such proofs is to show that if a set $A$ has a density significantly larger than $1/3$, its sumset $A+A$ is sufficiently well-distributed to be guaranteed to contain a square. The choice of modulo 3 in the construction is not accidental; it points to a fundamental obstruction related to the distribution of squares in residue classes.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\n1.  We have constructed a set $A = \\{k \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} \\mid k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$ for which $A+A$ contains no squares.\n2.  The size of this set is $|A| = (1/3 + o(1))N$, which establishes that the largest constant $c$ must be at least $1/3$.\n3.  It is a known result in number theory that it is not possible to construct such a set with a density greater than $1/3$. Therefore, the upper bound for $c$ is $1/3$.\n\nCombining the lower bound from our construction and the known (but non-trivial) upper bound, we can conclude that the largest value of $c$ is $1/3$.\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
