    "An analysis of the problem to find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n1.  **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, is defined by the presentation:\n    $SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    The size of the group is given as 512. Since $512 = 2^9$, we have $n=9$.\n    The group in question is $SD_{512}$, with the presentation:\n    $G = SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n    The elements of this group are of two forms:\n    *   Powers of $r$: $r^k$ for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, 255$. These form a cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order 256.\n    *   Elements in the coset $s\\langle r \\rangle$: $sr^k$ for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, 255$.\n2.  **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a \"power subgroup\" if it is generated by a single element of $G$. In other words, a power subgroup is a **cyclic subgroup**.\n    The question is asking for the total number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $SD_{512}$.\n\n**Step 2: Strategy for counting cyclic subgroups**\nWe can count the cyclic subgroups by categorizing them based on where their generator lies. A cyclic subgroup is either contained entirely within the maximal cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$, or its generator is one of the elements $sr^k$.\n\n**Step 3: Counting cyclic subgroups within $\\langle r \\rangle$**\nThe subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 256. For any cyclic group of order $N$, there is exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $N$.\nThe order is $N = 256 = 2^8$. The divisors of $2^8$ are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \\dots, 2^8$.\nThe number of divisors is $8+1=9$.\nTherefore, there are **9** distinct cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle r \\rangle$. These are $\\langle e \\rangle, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle, \\langle r^{64} \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle r \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Counting cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $sr^k$**\nThese are the cyclic subgroups that are not contained in $\\langle r \\rangle$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups of the form $\\langle sr^k \\rangle$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 255\\}$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the order of these elements. We use the relation $srs = r^{127}$, which implies $sr = r^{127}s$. By conjugation, $sr^k s = (srs)^k = (r^{127})^k = r^{127k}$.\nThe square of an element $sr^k$ is:\n$(sr^k)^2 = sr^k sr^k = (sr^k s) r^k = r^{127k} r^k = r^{128k}$.\nThe order of $r$ is 256, so $r^{256} = e$. Let's find the order of $sr^k$:\n$(sr^k)^4 = ((sr^k)^2)^2 = (r^{128k})^2 = r^{256k} = (r^{256})^k = e^k = e$.\nSo, the order of any element $sr^k$ must divide 4. It cannot be 1 (since $s \\notin \\langle r \\rangle$). Thus, the order is either 2 or 4.\n\n*   **Case 1: $o(sr^k) = 2$**\n    This occurs if $(sr^k)^2 = e$.\n    $r^{128k} = e \\implies 256 \\text{ divides } 128k \\implies 2 \\text{ divides } k$.\n    So, $sr^k$ has order 2 if and only if $k$ is even.\n    The values for $k$ are $0, 2, 4, \\dots, 254$. The number of such values is $254/2 + 1 = 128$.\n    Each of these 128 elements generates a cyclic subgroup of order 2. Since a group of order 2 has only one generator (besides the identity), each of these elements generates a distinct subgroup.\n    So, there are **128** distinct cyclic subgroups of order 2 of the form $\\langle sr^k \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Case 2: $o(sr^k) = 4$**\n    This occurs if $(sr^k)^2 \\ne e$.\n    $r^{128k} \\ne e \\implies 256 \\text{ does not divide } 128k \\implies k \\text{ is odd}$.\n    So, $sr^k$ has order 4 if and only if $k$ is odd.\n    The values for $k$ are $1, 3, 5, \\dots, 255$. The number of such values is 128.\n    A cyclic group of order 4 has $\\phi(4) = 2$ generators. Let's find the generators of $\\langle sr^k \\rangle$. They are $sr^k$ and $(sr^k)^3$.\n    $(sr^k)^2 = r^{128k}$. Since $k$ is odd, $r^{128k} = r^{128}$.\n    $(sr^k)^3 = (sr^k)(sr^k)^2 = sr^k r^{128} = sr^{k+128}$.\n    So, the two generators of the subgroup $\\langle sr^k \\rangle$ are $sr^k$ and $sr^{k+128}$. This means that $\\langle sr^k \\rangle = \\langle sr^{k+128} \\rangle$.\n    The 128 elements of order 4 form pairs, with each pair generating the same subgroup.\n    The number of distinct cyclic subgroups is the number of elements divided by the number of generators per subgroup: $128 / 2 = 64$.\n    So, there are **64** distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4 of the form $\\langle sr^k \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of power subgroups**\nWe sum the numbers of distinct cyclic subgroups from each category.\n1.  Subgroups within $\\langle r \\rangle$: 9\n2.  Subgroups generated by $sr^k$ with $k$ even (order 2): 128\n3.  Subgroups generated by $sr^k$ with $k$ odd (order 4): 64\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = $9 + 128 + 64 = 201$.\n\nThis result can be confirmed with the general formula for the number of cyclic subgroups in $SD_{2^n}$ (for $n \\ge 4$), which is $n + 2^{n-2} + 2^{n-3}$.\nFor $n=9$, the formula gives:\n$9 + 2^{9-2} + 2^{9-3} = 9 + 2^7 + 2^6 = 9 + 128 + 64 = 201$.\n\nThe final answer is 201.\n\n<<<201>>>"
