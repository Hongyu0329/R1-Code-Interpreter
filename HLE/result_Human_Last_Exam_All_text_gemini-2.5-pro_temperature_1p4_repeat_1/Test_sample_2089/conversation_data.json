    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks to identify a specific Oscar-nominated film based on a very precise scene. Let's break down the key components:\n1.  **Oscar-nominated film:** The movie must have received at least one Academy Award nomination in any category. This is a critical filter.\n2.  **A character seals his fate:** This implies a pivotal, irreversible moment for a character, leading directly to a negative outcome like their capture or death.\n3.  **Saying \"Thank you\":** The dialogue itself is the trigger. The specific words uttered are \"Thank you.\"\n4.  **While boarding a bus:** This is the setting of the crucial action.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   The phrase \"seals his fate\" does not necessarily mean the character dies or is captured in that exact moment. It means the action sets in motion the unavoidable chain of events that leads to their downfall.\n*   The \"Thank you\" must be the specific cause. It's not just a line spoken during the scene; it's the very thing that gives the character away or causes the fatal turn of events.\n*   We need to recall films with tense \"on the run\" or \"mistaken identity\" plot lines, as these often feature scenes where a character's past catches up with them.\n*   The film needs to be checked against the list of Academy Award nominees.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer\n\n1.  **Initial Brainstorming:** The scene described is highly specific and memorable. It involves a moment of recognition based on a subtle verbal tic. This points towards a thriller or a crime drama.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Film:** The scene in question occurs in the film **A History of Violence** (2005), directed by David Cronenberg.\n\n3.  **Checking the \"Oscar-Nominated\" Criterion:** *A History of Violence* was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actor for William Hurt and Best Adapted Screenplay for Josh Olson. This satisfies the first condition.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Character and Scene:** The character is the antagonist, **Carl Fogarty** (played by Ed Harris). Fogarty is a mobster who has traveled to a small town in Indiana to confront Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen), a man he insists is a former professional killer from Philadelphia named Joey Cusack.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the \"Seals His Fate\" Moment:**\n    *   Tom has been vehemently denying his past identity, even to his own family. His son, Jack, is confused and doesn't know who to believe.\n    *   After a confrontation, a frustrated Fogarty is about to leave town. As he and his henchmen board a bus, the bus driver says something like, \"Watch your step.\"\n    *   Fogarty responds with a polite, almost automatic, **\"Thank you.\"**\n    *   Jack, the son, is watching from a distance. He recognizes the peculiar, soft-spoken intonation of the \"Thank you\" because it is the exact same way his father, Tom, says it.\n    *   This small moment of politeness is the final proof for Jack that Fogarty is telling the truth and that his father is indeed the violent man from the past.\n    *   Later in the film, Fogarty returns and has Tom cornered. Because Jack is now certain of his father's true nature and the danger Fogarty represents, he intervenes, shooting and killing Fogarty with a shotgun.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Fogarty's fate was sealed by saying \"Thank you.\" That single phrase confirmed his story in Jack's mind, which directly led to Jack killing him later. Every element of the question is perfectly met by this scene.\n\n<<<A History of Violence>>>"
