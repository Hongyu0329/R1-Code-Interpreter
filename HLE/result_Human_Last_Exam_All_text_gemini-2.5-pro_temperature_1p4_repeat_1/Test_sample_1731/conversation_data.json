    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta using the principles of Large Deviation Theory (LDT).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Connecting Statistical Mechanics and Large Deviation Theory (LDT)**\n\nLarge Deviation Theory provides a mathematical framework for understanding why macroscopic systems overwhelmingly occupy their equilibrium state. The core idea is that the probability of observing a system in a macroscopic state (macrostate) other than equilibrium is exponentially small in the system's size.\n\n*   In statistical mechanics, the probability of a macrostate is proportional to the number of microscopic configurations (microstates) $\\Omega$ that realize it: $P(\\text{macrostate}) \\propto \\Omega$.\n*   Boltzmann's principle connects $\\Omega$ to entropy $S$ via $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$. Thus, $P(\\text{macrostate}) \\propto e^{S/k_B}$.\n*   In LDT, the probability of observing a particular empirical state (e.g., a distribution of particles over energy levels) is given by $P \\approx e^{-N \\cdot I}$, where $N$ is the size of the system and $I$ is the \"rate function\".\n*   Comparing these, we see that the rate function is equivalent to the negative entropy per particle (or per degree of freedom), up to constants: $I \\propto -S$.\n*   The equilibrium state is the most probable state, which corresponds to the state of maximum entropy, or minimum rate function. The theorems mentioned guide this process:\n    *   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem provides the form of the rate function for an empirical probability measure. In our context, it gives the form of the entropy based on the statistics of the particles (Bose-Einstein).\n    *   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem & Contraction Principle:** This principle states that to find the probability of a macroscopic observable (like mean energy), which is a function of the underlying microscopic state, we must find the microscopic state that is compatible with the observable and minimizes the rate function (i.e., maximizes entropy).\n\n**2. Defining the System and the Entropy (Rate Function)**\n\n*   **System:** We consider a gas of light quanta (photons). Photons are bosons, and their total number is not conserved. This implies their chemical potential is zero ($\\mu=0$).\n*   **Macrostate:** A macrostate is defined by the set of occupation numbers $\\{N_i\\}$, which is the number of photons in the energy level $\\epsilon_i$. Each level $\\epsilon_i$ may have a degeneracy of $g_i$ states.\n*   **Entropy (from Bose-Einstein Statistics):** For bosons, the number of ways to distribute $N_i$ indistinguishable particles into $g_i$ distinguishable states is given by $\\Omega_i = \\frac{(N_i + g_i - 1)!}{N_i! (g_i - 1)!}$. The total number of microstates is $\\Omega = \\prod_i \\Omega_i$.\n    Using Stirling's approximation for large $N_i$ and $g_i$, the entropy $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$ is found to be:\n    $S(\\{N_i\\}) = k_B \\sum_i \\left[ (N_i+g_i)\\ln(N_i+g_i) - N_i\\ln N_i - g_i\\ln g_i \\right]$.\n    This expression for entropy acts as the (negative of the) rate function, as per the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem's spirit.\n\n**3. Applying the Constraint (Contraction Principle)**\n\nWe seek the equilibrium state, which is the distribution $\\{N_i\\}$ that maximizes the entropy $S$ subject to the physical constraints on the system. For a photon gas in thermal equilibrium, the key constraint is a fixed total (mean) energy, $\\langle E \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Constraint:** The total energy of the system is $\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_i N_i \\epsilon_i$.\n*   **Maximization:** We use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize $S(\\{N_i\\})$ subject to the energy constraint. The functional to be maximized is:\n    $L = \\frac{S}{k_B} - \\beta \\left(\\sum_i N_i \\epsilon_i - \\langle E \\rangle \\right)$\n    where $\\beta$ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the energy constraint.\n*   **Solving:** We set the derivative with respect to each $N_j$ to zero: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial N_j} = 0$.\n    $\\frac{\\partial (S/k_B)}{\\partial N_j} = \\ln(N_j+g_j) - \\ln(N_j) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{g_j}{N_j}\\right)$.\n    The condition becomes:\n    $\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{g_j}{N_j}\\right) - \\beta \\epsilon_j = 0$\n    Solving for the average occupation number per state, $n_j = N_j/g_j$:\n    $1 + \\frac{1}{n_j} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} \\implies n_j = \\frac{N_j}{g_j} = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$.\n    This is the celebrated Bose-Einstein distribution for particles with zero chemical potential. The Lagrange multiplier $\\beta$ is identified with the inverse temperature, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n\n**4. Calculating Equilibrium Mean Energy**\n\nThe equilibrium mean energy is found by substituting the equilibrium distribution back into the energy formula. The sum is over all possible energy levels $i$ with degeneracy $g_i$.\n\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_i N_i \\epsilon_i = \\sum_i g_i n_i \\epsilon_i$\nPlugging in the expression for $n_i$:\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_i \\frac{g_i \\epsilon_i}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} - 1}$\nSubstituting $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_i \\frac{g_i \\epsilon_i}{\\exp(\\epsilon_i / k_B T) - 1}$\n\nThis is the general formula for the mean energy of a photon gas at equilibrium temperature $T$. For a specific system like black-body radiation in a cavity, the sum would be replaced by an integral over a density of states, leading to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\n**5. Calculating Equilibrium Entropy**\n\nThe equilibrium entropy is found by substituting the equilibrium distribution into the entropy formula. A more direct way is to use the thermodynamic relation for the Helmholtz Free Energy, $F = -k_B T \\ln \\mathcal{Z}$, where $\\mathcal{Z}$ is the partition function and the entropy is $S = (\\langle E \\rangle - F)/T$. For bosons with $\\mu=0$:\n\n*   The log of the grand canonical partition function is $\\ln \\mathcal{Z} = -\\sum_i g_i \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_i})$.\n*   The free energy is $F = -k_B T \\ln \\mathcal{Z} = k_B T \\sum_i g_i \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_i})$.\n*   The equilibrium entropy is:\n    $S = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle - F}{T} = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle}{T} - k_B \\sum_i g_i \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_i})$\n    Substituting $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n    $S = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle}{T} - k_B \\sum_i g_i \\ln(1 - \\exp(-\\epsilon_i / k_B T))$\n    This provides the entropy in terms of the mean energy and temperature.\n\nThese two expressions for $\\langle E \\rangle$ and $S$ represent the equilibrium values for the light quanta (photon) gas.\n\n***\n\nThe equilibrium values for mean energy $\\langle E \\rangle$ and entropy $S$ for a gas of light quanta (bosons with zero chemical potential) at a temperature $T$ are given by the following expressions, where the sum is over energy levels $\\epsilon_i$ with degeneracies $g_i$, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant:\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\n$$ \\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_i \\frac{g_i \\epsilon_i}{\\exp(\\epsilon_i / k_B T) - 1} $$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy:**\n$$ S = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle}{T} - k_B \\sum_i g_i \\ln\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon_i}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) $$"
