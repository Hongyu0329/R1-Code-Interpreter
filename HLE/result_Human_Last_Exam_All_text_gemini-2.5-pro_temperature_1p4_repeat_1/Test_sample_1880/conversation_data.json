    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.**\nTo determine the nature of the Galois group, we first need to ensure the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion.\n\n*   **Eisenstein's Criterion:** This criterion states that if there exists a prime number $p$ such that:\n    1.  $p$ divides every coefficient except the leading coefficient.\n    2.  $p$ does not divide the leading coefficient.\n    3.  $p^2$ does not divide the constant term.\n    ...then the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   **Applying the criterion to $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$:**\n    The coefficients are (1, 0, 0, 8, 14). Let's choose the prime $p=2$.\n    1.  $p=2$ divides 0, 8, and 14. This condition is met.\n    2.  $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient, 1. This condition is met.\n    3.  $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term, 14. This condition is met.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Since all conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are satisfied for $p=2$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Because it is an irreducible polynomial of degree 4, its Galois group must be a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (order 8), $C_4$ (order 4), and $V_4$ (order 4).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the discriminant of the polynomial.**\nThe discriminant, $\\Delta$, helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$. The group is a subgroup of $A_n$ if and only if the square root of the discriminant, $\\sqrt{\\Delta}$, is a rational number.\n\n*   **Formula:** For a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + cx + d$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256d^3 - 27c^4$.\n*   **Our polynomial:** For $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $c=8$ and $d=14$.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    $\\Delta = 256(14)^3 - 27(8)^4$\n    $\\Delta = 256(2744) - 27(4096)$\n    $\\Delta = 702464 - 110592$\n    $\\Delta = 591872$\n\n*   **Check if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$:** We need to find $\\sqrt{591872}$.\n    We can factorize the number: $591872 = 2 \\times 295936 = 2^9 \\times 1156 = 2^9 \\times 34^2$.\n    This can be written as $\\Delta = 2 \\times (2^4 \\times 34)^2 = 2 \\times (544)^2$.\n    So, $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 544^2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Since $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = 544\\sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number, the Galois group is **not** a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Construct and analyze the resolvent cubic.**\nThe resolvent cubic is a tool used to distinguish between the remaining possible Galois groups.\n\n*   **Formula:** For a depressed quartic $x^4 + cx + d$, the resolvent cubic is $g(y) = y^3 - 4dy - c^2$.\n*   **Our polynomial:** With $c=8$ and $d=14$, the resolvent cubic is:\n    $g(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - (8)^2$\n    $g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\n*   **Check for reducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$:** We use the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be an integer divisor of the constant term, -64. The divisors are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm8, \\ldots$.\n    Let's test $y=8$:\n    $g(8) = (8)^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 512 - 512 = 0$.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Since $y=8$ is a root, the resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Galois Group and its order.**\nWe now synthesize our findings using the standard classification for the Galois group of an irreducible quartic:\n1.  Is $f(x)$ irreducible? **Yes.**\n2.  Is $\\sqrt{\\Delta} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$? **No.** (Rules out $A_4, V_4$)\n3.  Is the resolvent cubic reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$? **Yes.** (Rules out $S_4$)\n\nThe remaining possibilities are the dihedral group $D_4$ and the cyclic group $C_4$. To distinguish between them, we need a further test. The standard test is to check if the polynomial $f(x)$ becomes reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   The Galois group is $D_4$ if $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   The Galois group is $C_4$ if $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nFor our polynomial, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A key theorem states that for a quartic of the form $x^4+cx+d$, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ if and only if at least one root of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic are $y=8$ and the roots of $y^2+8y+8=0$, which are $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. Let's check the rational root $y=8$.\nIs 8 a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? We need to see if $\\sqrt{8}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n$\\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. Since $2\\sqrt{2}$ is of the form $a+b\\sqrt{2}$ (with $a=0, b=2$), it is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince one of the roots of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. Therefore, the Galois group is $D_4$.\n\nThe order of the dihedral group $D_4$ (the group of symmetries of a square) is 8.\n\nFinal Answer: The order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
