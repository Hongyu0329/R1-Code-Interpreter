    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor and order.\n\n**Question:** Let $d = 53599$. Find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d$ and order $6$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the conductor `d`**\n\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n*   We can test for small prime divisors. $d$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   Dividing by 7: $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$.\n*   Now we factor 7657. $\\sqrt{7657} \\approx 87.5$. We test primes up to 87.\n*   Dividing 7657 by 13: $7657 = 13 \\times 589$.\n*   Now we factor 589. $\\sqrt{589} \\approx 24.2$. We test primes up to 23.\n*   Dividing 589 by 19: $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\n*   The primes 7, 13, 19, and 31 are all distinct.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nLet's denote the prime factors as $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$.\n\n**Careful point:** The conductor $d$ is a square-free integer (no repeated prime factors). This is a critical property that simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n**Step 2: Properties of Dirichlet characters for a square-free conductor**\n\nFor a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$, any Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters modulo each prime factor:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$.\n\n*   **Primitivity:** A character $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $d$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $p_i$. A character modulo a prime $p_i$ is primitive if and only if it is not the principal character (the character of order 1). Thus, for $\\chi$ to be primitive, the order of each $\\chi_i$ must be greater than 1.\n*   **Order:** The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters. Let $k_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$. Then, $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4)$.\n\nWe are looking for primitive characters of order 6. So we have the following conditions on the orders of the component characters:\n1.  $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i) = k_i > 1$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n2.  $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of component characters of a given order**\n\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo a prime $p$ is a cyclic group of order $p-1$. In a cyclic group of order $n$, the number of elements of order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $n$.\n\nLet's find the orders of the character groups for our primes:\n*   Modulo $p_1=7$: The group order is $p_1-1 = 6$.\n*   Modulo $p_2=13$: The group order is $p_2-1 = 12$.\n*   Modulo $p_3=19$: The group order is $p_3-1 = 18$.\n*   Modulo $p_4=31$: The group order is $p_4-1 = 30$.\n\n**Careful point:** For each prime factor $p_i$, the group order $p_i-1$ is a multiple of 6. This means that for each $p_i$, characters of orders 1, 2, 3, and 6 exist.\n\nFrom the condition $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$, each order $k_i$ must be a divisor of 6. So $k_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\nCombined with the primitivity condition ($k_i > 1$), the possible orders for each component character are $k_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nLet's count the number of characters for each of these orders. For any of our primes $p_i$, the number of characters $\\chi_i$ of order $k$ is:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $N_2 = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $N_3 = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $N_6 = \\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\n**Step 4: Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the final count**\n\nWe need to count the number of 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i) = k_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ and $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$.\n\nLet's apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\nFirst, we count the total number of primitive characters whose order divides 6. For this to happen, each component character $\\chi_i$ must have an order $k_i$ that divides 6 and is greater than 1. So, $k_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\nFor each component $\\chi_i$, the number of available choices is $N_2 + N_3 + N_6 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\nSince there are 4 components, the total number of primitive characters whose order divides 6 is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nThis count of 625 includes characters whose order is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., order 2 or 3), in addition to those of order 6. We must subtract these.\n*   **Characters of order 2:** For the overall order to be 2, we need $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 2$. Given that each $k_i > 1$, this forces $k_i=2$ for all $i=1, 2, 3, 4$.\n    The number of characters of order 2 for each component is $N_2 = \\phi(2)=1$.\n    So, the number of primitive characters of order 2 is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n*   **Characters of order 3:** For the overall order to be 3, we need $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 3$. Given that each $k_i > 1$, this forces $k_i=3$ for all $i=1, 2, 3, 4$.\n    The number of characters of order 3 for each component is $N_3 = \\phi(3)=2$.\n    So, the number of primitive characters of order 3 is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe set of characters of order 2 and the set of characters of order 3 are disjoint. Therefore, the number of primitive characters of order exactly 6 is:\n(Number of primitive characters with order dividing 6) - (Number of primitive characters of order 2) - (Number of primitive characters of order 3)\n$= 625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n1.  Factor conductor $d=53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n2.  Identify conditions for primitive characters of order 6: $\\chi = \\chi_1\\chi_2\\chi_3\\chi_4$ where $k_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)>1$ and $\\text{lcm}(k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4)=6$.\n3.  This means $k_i \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$. The number of choices for each $\\chi_i$ is $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2=5$.\n4.  Total primitive characters with order dividing 6 is $5^4 = 625$.\n5.  Subtract characters with order 2: Each $k_i=2$. Number of choices for each $\\chi_i$ is $\\phi(2)=1$. Total = $1^4=1$.\n6.  Subtract characters with order 3: Each $k_i=3$. Number of choices for each $\\chi_i$ is $\\phi(3)=2$. Total = $2^4=16$.\n7.  The number of characters of order 6 is $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
