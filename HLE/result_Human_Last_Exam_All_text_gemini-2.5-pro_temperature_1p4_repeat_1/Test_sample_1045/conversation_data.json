    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula\nFirst, we need to determine the number of atoms of each element in the toluene molecule.\n*   The chemical formula is C7H8.\n*   This means there are **7 Carbon (C) atoms**.\n*   This means there are **8 Hydrogen (H) atoms**.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the 6-31G Basis Set Notation\nThe notation \"6-31G\" describes how many Gaussian functions are used to represent the atomic orbitals of each element. This is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. We need to analyze its meaning for both Carbon and Hydrogen.\n\n#### Analysis for Carbon (C), a second-row element:\n*   **\"6-\"**: This part refers to the **core orbitals**. The 1s core orbital of Carbon is described by a single **contracted Gaussian function (CGF)**. This single CGF is formed by combining (contracting) 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    *   Core CGFs per C = **1**\n\n*   **\"-31G\"**: This part refers to the **valence orbitals** (2s and 2p for Carbon). The valence shell is \"split\" into two parts, an inner and an outer part.\n    *   **\"-3\"**: Describes the inner part of the valence shell. It is represented by one CGF for the 2s orbital and one CGF for each of the three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz). Each of these CGFs is a contraction of 3 PGFs.\n        *   Inner valence CGFs per C = 1 (for 2s) + 3 (for 2p) = **4**\n    *   **\"-1\"**: Describes the outer part of the valence shell. It is represented by a second, more diffuse set of functions. This includes one CGF for the 2s orbital and one CGF for each of the three 2p orbitals. Each of these CGFs consists of a single PGF.\n        *   Outer valence CGFs per C = 1 (for 2s) + 3 (for 2p) = **4**\n\n*   **Total CGFs per Carbon atom** = (Core CGFs) + (Inner valence CGFs) + (Outer valence CGFs) = 1 + 4 + 4 = **9 CGFs**.\n\n#### Analysis for Hydrogen (H), a first-row element:\n*   Hydrogen has no core electrons, only a 1s valence orbital. Therefore, only the \"31G\" part of the notation applies.\n*   **\"3\"**: Describes the inner part of the 1s valence orbital. This is represented by **1 CGF** (contracted from 3 PGFs).\n*   **\"1\"**: Describes the outer part of the 1s valence orbital. This is represented by **1 CGF** (consisting of 1 PGF).\n\n*   **Total CGFs per Hydrogen atom** = (Inner CGF) + (Outer CGF) = 1 + 1 = **2 CGFs**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Contracted Gaussian Functions\nNow we combine the results from the previous steps to find the total for the toluene molecule (C7H8).\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon atoms:**\n    *   7 C atoms × 9 CGFs/C atom = **63 CGFs**\n\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   8 H atoms × 2 CGFs/H atom = **16 CGFs**\n\n*   **Total number of CGFs:**\n    *   Total = (CGFs from Carbon) + (CGFs from Hydrogen)\n    *   Total = 63 + 16 = **79**\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **Distinguish between CGFs and PGFs:** The question asks for *contracted* Gaussian functions (CGFs), not the underlying *primitive* Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **Apply the notation correctly to different elements:** The \"6-\" part only applies to non-hydrogen atoms (second-row and heavier) that have core electrons. Hydrogen only uses the valence part of the description (\"-31G\").\n*   **Account for all orbitals:** For Carbon's valence shell, remember to account for both the single 2s and the three 2p orbitals (px, py, pz) for both the inner and outer sets of functions.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\nTotal CGFs = (Number of C atoms × CGFs per C) + (Number of H atoms × CGFs per H)\nTotal CGFs = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2) = 63 + 16 = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
