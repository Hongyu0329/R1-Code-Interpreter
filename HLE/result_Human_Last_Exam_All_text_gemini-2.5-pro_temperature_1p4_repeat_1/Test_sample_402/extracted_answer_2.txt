The proposed filtering strategy involves four main steps implemented after the initial differential expression (DE) analysis.

1.  **Run Differential Expression Analysis:** Perform a DE analysis comparing the CAR-IL15 T cells against the CAR-only T cells, ensuring the contaminated CAR-only group is set as the baseline/reference condition. This will produce a results table containing metrics like log2FoldChange (L2FC) and adjusted p-value (padj) for each gene.

2.  **Identify Contaminant Genes with Stringent Thresholds:** Filter the DE results to identify genes characterized by a very large negative log2FoldChange and a high statistical significance. The rationale is that contaminating cancer cell genes, present only in the baseline group, will appear as strongly downregulated. A recommended starting threshold is `L2FC < -5` combined with `padj < 0.01`.

3.  **Generate a Contaminant Gene List via the Command Line:** Use a command-line tool like `awk` to parse the DE results file and create a list of gene IDs that meet the criteria from step 2. For a tab-separated results file where gene ID is in column 1, L2FC is in column 3, and padj is in column 7, the command would be:
    `awk -F'\t' 'NR>1 && $3 < -5 && $7 < 0.01 {print $1}' de_results.tsv > contaminant_genes.txt`

4.  **Filter the Original Count Matrix via the Command Line:** Use the generated list (`contaminant_genes.txt`) to remove the corresponding rows from your original raw count matrix using a tool like `grep`. This creates a new, clean count matrix for all further analyses. The command would be:
    `grep -v -f contaminant_genes.txt raw_counts.tsv > filtered_counts.tsv`

Finally, it is critical to verify the list of filtered genes to ensure they are plausible cancer-specific markers and not T-cell genes, and to re-run a PCA on the `filtered_counts.tsv` to confirm that the major source of variance is no longer the contamination.
