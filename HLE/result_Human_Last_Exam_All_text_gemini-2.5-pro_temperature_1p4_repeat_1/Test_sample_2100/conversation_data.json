    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\n*   **Clue:** The poet Andrei Voznesensky called a man \"a joy-discovering sailor\".\n*   **Analysis:** Andrei Voznesensky was a famous Soviet-era Russian poet. This phrase points to one of his poems. The poem in question is \"Saga\" («Сага»), which later formed the basis for the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" («Юнона и Авось»). The central character of this poem and opera is the subject of the question.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the subject of the poem.**\n*   **Clue:** The poem is about a historical figure who was a Russian explorer.\n*   **Analysis:** The poem \"Saga\" and the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" are about the real-life Russian nobleman and explorer, Count Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. He led a round-the-world expedition for Russia and is famous for his journey to Spanish California, where he had a romance with Concepción Argüello. The poetic description \"joy-discovering sailor\" alludes to both his voyages and his famous love story.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second clue about the grave.**\n*   **Clue:** Voznesensky wondered, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"\n*   **Analysis:** This line indicates that at the time the poem was written (1970), the exact location of the man's grave was unknown. Nikolai Rezanov died in 1807 in the city of Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, while returning from his mission. He was buried in the cemetery of the Voskresensky (Resurrection) Cathedral.\n*   **Careful Point:** The key historical fact is that this cathedral and its cemetery were destroyed by the Soviet authorities in the 1930s. As a result, the precise location of Rezanov's grave was lost for many decades, which is why Voznesensky could write this line.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the final clue about the discovery.**\n*   **Clue:** The answer to the question of his grave's location \"emerged in the late 1980s\".\n*   **Analysis:** During the period of *Glasnost* and *Perestroika* in the late 1980s, there was a renewed interest in pre-Soviet Russian history. The popularity of the \"Juno and Avos\" opera intensified the search for Rezanov's lost grave. While a symbolic tombstone was placed in another cemetery earlier, it was during the late 1980s that more concerted efforts were made, leading to the identification of the likely area where his remains lay. A memorial cross was eventually placed at the discovered site. This timeline matches the clue perfectly.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the information to find the answer.**\n*   The man is Nikolai Rezanov, the subject of Voznesensky's poem.\n*   He was an explorer (\"sailor\").\n*   His grave was lost for a long time.\n*   The mystery of its location was revisited and essentially solved in the late 1980s.\n*   The question asks for the man's last name.\n\nTherefore, the man's last name is Rezanov.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
