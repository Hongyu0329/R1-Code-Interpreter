    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ in $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Theory and the Coupling Constant**\n\nThe theory in question is the scalar $\\phi^4$ theory in $d$ Euclidean dimensions. The action is given by:\n$S = \\int d^d x \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + \\frac{u_0}{4!} \\phi^4 \\right]$\nHere, $\\phi$ is a single-component real scalar field, and $u_0$ is the bare coupling constant.\n\n**2. Dimensional Analysis**\n\nTo understand the behavior of the theory under scaling, we first determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant. The action $S$ must be dimensionless (in units where $\\hbar=1, c=1$).\n*   The dimension of the spacetime integral is $[d^d x] = [\\text{Length}]^d = [\\text{Mass}]^{-d}$.\n*   The kinetic term $\\int d^d x (\\nabla \\phi)^2$ must be dimensionless. We have $[\\nabla] = [\\text{Mass}]^1$, so $[\\nabla \\phi]^2 = [\\text{Mass}]^2 [\\phi]^2$. The dimension of the kinetic term is therefore $[\\text{Mass}]^{-d+2} [\\phi]^2$. For this to be dimensionless, the dimension of the field $\\phi$ must be $[\\phi] = [\\text{Mass}]^{(d-2)/2}$.\n*   Now consider the interaction term $\\int d^d x \\frac{u_0}{4!} \\phi^4$. Its dimension is $[\\text{Mass}]^{-d} [u_0] [\\phi]^4$. For this term to be dimensionless, we must have:\n    $[\\text{Mass}]^{-d} [u_0] ([\\text{Mass}]^{(d-2)/2})^4 = [\\text{Mass}]^0$\n    $[\\text{Mass}]^{-d} [u_0] [\\text{Mass}]^{2d-4} = [\\text{Mass}]^0$\n    $[u_0] = [\\text{Mass}]^{4-d}$\n\nWe are interested in the theory *near four dimensions*, so we define a small parameter $\\epsilon = 4 - d$.\nThe dimension of the bare coupling constant is $[u_0] = [\\text{Mass}]^\\epsilon$. Since $u_0$ is not dimensionless for $\\epsilon \\neq 0$, we introduce a dimensionless renormalized coupling constant, $u$, related to $u_0$ via an arbitrary energy scale $\\mu$:\n$u_0 = \\mu^\\epsilon u$\nHere, we are using a simplified relation that holds true at the tree level. Renormalization introduces additional factors (the renormalization constants).\n\n**3. The Renormalization Group and the Beta Function**\n\nThe Renormalization Group (RG) describes how the coupling constant $u$ changes as we change the energy scale $\\mu$. This change is described by the beta function, defined as:\n$\\beta(u) = \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu}$\n\nTo find the beta function, one must perform a one-loop renormalization of the theory. The beta function for the coupling $u$ is calculated by ensuring that the physics, described by the bare coupling $u_0$, is independent of our choice of the arbitrary scale $\\mu$. This requires calculating the loop corrections to the four-point vertex function.\n\n**4. The One-Loop Beta Function**\n\nThe calculation of the beta function for $\\phi^4$ theory is a standard result in quantum field theory. Using dimensional regularization and the Minimal Subtraction (MS) scheme, the one-loop beta function for the coupling $u$ (from the $\\frac{u}{4!} \\phi^4$ interaction) is found to be:\n$\\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2} + O(u^3)$\n\n*   The term $-\\epsilon u$ arises directly from the engineering dimension of the coupling constant.\n*   The term $+\\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2}$ arises from the one-loop quantum corrections. The factor of 3 comes from the three possible Feynman diagrams (s, t, u-channels) that contribute to the four-point function at one-loop. The factor of $16\\pi^2$ is characteristic of one-loop integrals in four dimensions.\n\n**5. Finding the Fixed Point**\n\nA fixed point of the RG flow, denoted by $u^*$, is a value of the coupling at which the beta function is zero:\n$\\beta(u^*) = 0$\nAt a fixed point, the theory is scale-invariant, as the coupling no longer changes with the energy scale.\n\nWe set the beta function to zero to find the possible fixed points:\n$-\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3(u^*)^2}{16\\pi^2} = 0$\n\nThis equation has two solutions:\n1.  $u^* = 0$. This is the **Gaussian fixed point**, which corresponds to a free, non-interacting theory.\n2.  The non-trivial solution is found by factoring out $u^*$:\n    $u^* \\left( -\\epsilon + \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} \\right) = 0$\n    $-\\epsilon + \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = 0$\n    $\\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = \\epsilon$\n    $u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3}\\epsilon$\n\nThis non-trivial fixed point is known as the **Wilson-Fisher fixed point**.\n\n**6. Validity of the Result**\n\nThis calculation was performed using one-loop perturbation theory, which is an expansion in the coupling $u$. For the result to be reliable, the fixed-point coupling $u^*$ must be small.\nSince $u^* \\propto \\epsilon$, the fixed point is indeed at a small value of the coupling if $\\epsilon = 4 - d$ is small. Thus, the $\\epsilon$-expansion is a controlled way to study this non-trivial fixed point. The expression $u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3}\\epsilon$ is the **leading order** result in the $\\epsilon$-expansion. Higher-order loop calculations would provide corrections of order $\\epsilon^2$ and higher.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is the expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling constant.\n\n$u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3}\\epsilon$\n\n<<<u^* = (16*\\pi^2/3)*\\epsilon>>>"
