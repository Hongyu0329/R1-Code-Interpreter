    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the parametric curve definition.**\nThe curve is defined by $x=\\cos t$ and $y=b\\sin t$. The parameter `b` changes based on the value of `t`:\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, we have $b=1$.\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, we have $b=5$.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the first part of the curve ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$).**\nIn this interval, the equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\nWe can find the Cartesian equation by noting that $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\nThis is the equation of a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 1.\nLet's check the range of `t`:\n*   At $t=0$: $(x,y) = (\\cos 0, \\sin 0) = (1, 0)$.\n*   At $t=\\pi/2$: $(x,y) = (\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = (0, 1)$.\n*   At $t=\\pi$: $(x,y) = (\\cos \\pi, \\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$.\nSince $\\sin t \\ge 0$ for $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, this part of the curve is the **upper semi-circle** of the unit circle.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the second part of the curve ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$).**\nIn this interval, the equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\nTo find the Cartesian equation, we can write $\\frac{y}{5} = \\sin t$. Then, $x^2 + (\\frac{y}{5})^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\nThe equation is $x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{25} = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of 5 along the y-axis.\nLet's check the range of `t`:\n*   As $t \\to \\pi^+$: $(x,y) \\to (\\cos \\pi, 5\\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$.\n*   At $t=3\\pi/2$: $(x,y) = (\\cos \\frac{3\\pi}{2}, 5\\sin \\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = (0, -5)$.\n*   As $t \\to 2\\pi^-$: $(x,y) \\to (\\cos 2\\pi, 5\\sin 2\\pi) = (1, 0)$.\nSince $\\sin t \\le 0$ for $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, this part of the curve is the **lower semi-ellipse**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the overall extents (bounding box) of the complete figure.**\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the entire figure.\n\n*   **X-coordinates:** For the entire range $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, the x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos t$. The minimum value of $\\cos t$ is -1 and the maximum value is 1.\n    *   $x_{min} = -1$\n    *   $x_{max} = 1$\n*   **Y-coordinates:** We need to consider both parts.\n    *   For the upper semi-circle ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$), $y = \\sin t$. The y-values range from 0 to 1. So, the maximum y-value is $y_{max} = 1$.\n    *   For the lower semi-ellipse ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$), $y = 5\\sin t$. The y-values range from -5 to 0. So, the minimum y-value is $y_{min} = -5$.\n\nCombining these, the figure extends from $x = -1$ to $x = 1$ and from $y = -5$ to $y = 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the dimensions of the smallest enclosing square.**\nThe width of the figure's bounding box is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\nThe height of the figure's bounding box is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe smallest square that can contain this figure must have a side length equal to the larger of these two dimensions. This is because the figure has a total height of 6, so any square containing it must have a side length of at least 6.\n\nSide length of the square, $s = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the area of the square.**\nThe area of a square with side length `s` is $s^2$.\nArea = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Recognize the piecewise nature of the curve and analyze each piece separately.\n*   Correctly identify the shapes as a semi-circle and a semi-ellipse.\n*   Determine the full range of x and y coordinates by considering the entire path of the curve.\n*   The side length of the smallest enclosing square is determined by the maximum dimension (width or height) of the figure's axis-aligned bounding box.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1. The figure is a composite of an upper semi-circle of radius 1 and a lower semi-ellipse with semi-axes 1 and 5.\n2. The figure's width is from $x=-1$ to $x=1$, so the total width is 2.\n3. The figure's height is from $y=-5$ to $y=1$, so the total height is 6.\n4. The smallest square that can enclose this figure must have a side length equal to the maximum dimension, which is 6.\n5. The area of this square is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
