    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of the given molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Molecular Structure**\n\nThe molecule's name is 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n\n*   **Central Core:** The molecule is built on a central benzene ring. The name \"2,4,6-trimethylbenzene\" indicates three methyl (-CH3) groups at positions 2, 4, and 6.\n*   **Substituents:** The prefix \"1,3,5-tri[...]\" indicates that there are three identical, large substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5 of the benzene ring.\n*   **Linker:** The name of the substituent includes \"...methyl]\", which means each of the three large groups is connected to the benzene ring via a methylene (-CH2-) linker.\n*   **Peripheral Group:** The large group is `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`. This is a complex, rigid, and chiral heterocyclic group derived from camphor. The attachment to the -CH2- linker is at the N2 position of the indazole system.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Overall Symmetry of the Molecule**\n\n*   The central benzene ring is symmetrically substituted with three identical methyl groups at positions 2, 4, 6 and three identical large groups at positions 1, 3, 5.\n*   This arrangement gives the molecule a **C3 rotational axis of symmetry**. This means that rotating the molecule by 120Â° around an axis perpendicular to the center of the benzene ring leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   **Careful Point:** This symmetry is crucial. It implies that the three large arms (each consisting of a -CH2- linker and a camphor-indazole group) are chemically equivalent. Similarly, the three methyl groups on the central ring are chemically equivalent.\n*   Therefore, to find the total number of signals, we only need to count the unique signals from the central core and linkers, and then add the number of unique signals from *one* of the peripheral groups.\n\n**Step 3: Count the Signals from the Central Core and Linkers**\n\n1.  **2,4,6-trimethyl groups:** Due to the C3 symmetry, the three methyl groups on the central benzene ring are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single peak in the NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Signal Count: 1**\n\n2.  **1,3,5-methylene (-CH2-) linkers:** The three -CH2- groups are also equivalent due to C3 symmetry. However, each -CH2- group is attached to a chiral center (the camphor-indazole group is chiral). This makes the two protons on each -CH2- group **diastereotopic**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will have different chemical shifts.\n    *   Therefore, the methylene protons will give rise to two distinct signals.\n    *   **Signal Count: 2**\n\n*   **Subtotal for Core and Linkers:** 1 + 2 = **3 signals**.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Signals from a Single Peripheral Group**\n\nWe need to analyze one `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl` unit. This group is rigid and has no internal symmetry (it is asymmetric). Therefore, every proton that is in a chemically distinct location will produce its own signal.\n\nLet's identify all the unique protons and methyl groups in this unit:\n1.  **Proton on the pyrazole ring (C3-H):** There is one proton on the heterocyclic pyrazole ring. It is in a unique chemical environment.\n    *   **Signal Count: 1**\n2.  **Methyl group on C7:** This methyl group is attached to the C7 bridgehead carbon. It is unique.\n    *   **Signal Count: 1**\n3.  **Two methyl groups on C8 (gem-dimethyl):** These two methyl groups are attached to the same carbon (C8). Because they are in a chiral molecule, they are diastereotopic. One is 'syn' (closer to the C5-C6 bridge) and the other is 'anti' (further away). They are chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   **Signal Count: 2**\n4.  **Proton on the bridgehead C4 (C4-H):** This is a single proton on the other bridgehead carbon. It is unique.\n    *   **Signal Count: 1**\n5.  **Protons on the C5 methylene group (C5-H2):** The two protons (exo and endo) are diastereotopic.\n    *   **Signal Count: 2**\n6.  **Protons on the C6 methylene group (C6-H2):** These two protons are also diastereotopic.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The environment of C5 is different from C6 (C5 is adjacent to C4-H, while C6 is adjacent to the C7-CH3 group). Therefore, the two proton signals from C5 will be different from the two proton signals from C6.\n    *   **Signal Count: 2**\n\n*   **Subtotal for one Peripheral Group:** 1 (C3-H) + 1 (C7-Me) + 2 (C8-Me2) + 1 (C4-H) + 2 (C5-H2) + 2 (C6-H2) = **9 signals**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Expected Peaks**\n\nThe total number of signals is the sum of the signals from the central part and the signals from one peripheral arm.\n\n*   Total Signals = (Signals from Core/Linkers) + (Signals from one Peripheral Group)\n*   Total Signals = 3 + 9 = 12\n\nTherefore, 12 distinct peaks are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<H>>>"
