    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the problem**\nWe are given a first-order autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nWe are asked to find the number of stable equilibrium points, which is denoted by $m$. After finding $m$, we need to calculate the value of the expression $m - 2^{4048}$.\n\n**2. Find the equilibrium points**\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) are the constant solutions of the ODE. They are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. Let's denote the right-hand side of the ODE as $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x $$\nTo find the equilibrium points, we set $f(x) = 0$ and solve for $x$:\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term is a perfect square, $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$. So the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. These are the two equilibrium points of the system.\n\n**3. Determine the stability of the equilibrium points**\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$, we can use the linearization method, which involves checking the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$ at $x^*$, i.e., $f'(x^*)$.\n- If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium point is stable.\n- If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium point is unstable.\n- If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we must use another method, such as a phase line analysis.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\nNow, let's test each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x^* = 0$:**\n    Substitute $x=0$ into $f'(x)$:\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x^* = 1$:**\n    Substitute $x=1$ into $f'(x)$:\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the linearization test is inconclusive. We must analyze the sign of $f(x)$ in the vicinity of $x=1$.\n\n**4. Phase Line Analysis for $x=1$**\nOur function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$. Let's check the sign of $f(x)$ on either side of $x=1$.\n*   **To the left of $x=1$ (e.g., for $x \\in (0,1)$):**\n    Let's pick a test point like $x = 0.5$.\n    $f(0.5) = -0.5(0.5-1)^2 = -0.5(-0.5)^2 = -0.5(0.25) = -0.125$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$ for $x \\in (0,1)$, $x'(t)$ is negative. This means that solutions starting slightly to the left of $x=1$ will move to the left, away from $x=1$.\n\n*   **To the right of $x=1$ (e.g., for $x > 1$):**\n    Let's pick a test point like $x = 2$.\n    $f(2) = -2(2-1)^2 = -2(1)^2 = -2$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$ for $x > 1$, $x'(t)$ is negative. This means that solutions starting slightly to the right of $x=1$ will move to the left, towards $x=1$.\n\nAn equilibrium point is defined as stable if solutions that start sufficiently close to it remain close to it for all future time. Since solutions starting to the left of $x=1$ move away from it, $x=1$ is not a stable equilibrium. It is a semi-stable equilibrium point. By convention, semi-stable points are not included in the count of stable points.\n\n**5. Count the number of stable equilibria ($m$)**\nBased on our analysis, only the equilibrium point $x=0$ is stable.\nTherefore, the number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\n**6. Calculate the final expression**\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$, we get:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n<<<1-2^4048>>>"
