    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Classical Prisoner's Dilemma**\n\nThe Prisoner's Dilemma is a fundamental concept in game theory. We are given the payoff matrix:\n\n| | Player B: Cooperate | Player B: Defect |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Player A: Cooperate** | (5, 5) | (0, 7) |\n| **Player A: Defect** | (7, 0) | (1, 1) |\n\n*   **(C, C):** Both players cooperate and get a reward of 5 each. This is the best collective outcome (Pareto optimal).\n*   **(D, D):** Both players defect and get a punishment of 1 each.\n*   **(C, D):** Player A cooperates (sucker) and gets 0, while Player B defects and gets the temptation payoff of 7.\n*   **(D, C):** Player A defects (temptation) and gets 7, while Player B cooperates (sucker) and gets 0.\n\nIn classical game theory, the only Nash Equilibrium is (Defect, Defect). A Nash Equilibrium is a state where no player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy. If Player B cooperates, A is better off defecting (7 > 5). If Player B defects, A is still better off defecting (1 > 0). The same logic applies to Player B. Thus, both players rationally choose to defect, leading to the suboptimal outcome of (1, 1).\n\n**2. Introduce the Quantum Game Theory Framework (EWL Scheme)**\n\nWhen the game is played in \"quantum space,\" we use a framework like the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) scheme.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The game starts not with independent players, but with an entangled initial state. The question specifies that we should \"design the initial states for an optimal\" outcome. This implies using a **maximally entangled state**. A standard choice is:\n    `|ψ_initial> = J |00>`\n    where `J = (1/√2) * (I ⊗ I + i * σ_x ⊗ σ_x)` is an entangling operator. This creates the state `(1/√2) * (|00> + i|11>)`, a Bell state. The state `|0>` represents Cooperation (C) and `|1>` represents Defection (D).\n\n*   **Player Strategies:** Players' strategies are no longer just C or D. They can apply any unitary transformation (a quantum gate) to their respective qubit. The set of possible strategies is much larger.\n    *   Classical Cooperate (C) corresponds to the identity operator `I = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]`.\n    *   Classical Defect (D) corresponds to a bit-flip operator, like `σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]` or `-iσ_y = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]]`.\n    *   A new, purely **Quantum strategy (Q)** exists, represented by the matrix `Q = iσ_z = [[i, 0], [0, -i]]`.\n\n*   **Payoff Calculation:** After players apply their chosen strategies (operators `U_A` and `U_B`), a disentangling operator `J†` is applied. The final state is then measured in the classical basis `{|00>, |01>, |10>, |11>}`. The probability of each outcome determines the expected payoff for each player.\n\n**3. Finding the Quantum Equilibrium**\n\nThe goal is to find a new Nash Equilibrium in this quantum version of the game. Let's analyze the strategy pair (`Q`, `Q`), where both players choose the quantum strategy.\n\n*   **Outcome of (`Q`, `Q`):** If both players apply the operator `Q` to their part of the entangled state, the calculation `J† (Q ⊗ Q) J |00>` shows that the final state becomes `|00>`.\n    *   This means the outcome is (Cooperate, Cooperate) with 100% probability.\n    *   The payoff for this outcome is **(5, 5)**.\n\n*   **Is (`Q`, `Q`) a Nash Equilibrium?** We must check if any player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate. Let's assume Player B is fixed on playing `Q`. Player A's goal is to choose a strategy `U_A` that maximizes their payoff.\n    *   Player A's payoff can be calculated as a function of their strategy `U_A`, given Player B's strategy is `Q`.\n    *   Detailed calculations show that the temptation payoff (7) is inaccessible to Player A if Player B plays `Q`. The probability of the outcome (D, C), which gives A the payoff of 7, becomes zero.\n    *   The calculation further shows that Player A's payoff is maximized when they also choose the strategy `Q`. Any other strategy results in a payoff less than or equal to 5.\n    *   Therefore, Player A has no incentive to change their strategy from `Q`.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** Since the game is symmetric, the same logic applies to Player B. If Player A plays `Q`, Player B's best response is also `Q`.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Equilibrium:** The strategy pair (`Q`, `Q`) is a stable Nash Equilibrium. With maximal entanglement, it can be shown that the classical (Defect, Defect) equilibrium is no longer stable. Therefore, (`Q`, `Q`) becomes the new, superior equilibrium point.\n\n**4. The Final Answer**\n\nThe equilibrium point refers to the outcome of the game when players choose their optimal strategies in the given framework. In the quantum prisoner's dilemma with an optimal (maximally entangled) initial state, the Nash Equilibrium strategy is for both players to play the \"quantum\" strategy `Q`.\n\nThis leads to the classical outcome of (Cooperate, Cooperate) with certainty. The payoff vector for this outcome is **(5, 5)**.\n\nThe question asks for the equilibrium point. Given the format of the examples, this refers to the symmetric payoff received by each player at this equilibrium.\n\nThe equilibrium payoff for each player is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
