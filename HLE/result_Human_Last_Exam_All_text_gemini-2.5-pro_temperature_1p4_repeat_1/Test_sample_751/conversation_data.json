    "This problem asks us to reduce a given discrete-time system to its observer canonical form and find the new output matrix `C_o`. The reduction is to be performed using the principle of duality.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and Duality**\n\nThe given discrete-time system is:\n`x(k+1) = Ax(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nwith matrices:\n`A = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]`\n`C = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]`\n\nThe principle of duality connects the observability of a system `(A, C)` to the controllability of its dual system `(A', C')`. Transforming a system `(A, C)` to observer canonical form is dual to transforming the system `(A', C')` to controller canonical form. The procedure involves finding a state transformation `x_o = T*x` such that the new system matrices `A_o = T*A*T^(-1)` and `C_o = C*T^(-1)` are in observer canonical form.\n\n**2. Check Observability**\n\nFirst, we must determine if the system is observable, which is a prerequisite for the existence of an observer canonical form. We do this by checking the rank of the observability matrix `O`.\n`O = [C; C*A; C*A^2; ...]`\n\nThe rows of C are:\n`c1 = [0, 1, 0]`\n`c2 = [1, 1, 0]`\n\nNext, we compute `C*A`:\n`C*A = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]] = [[2, 1, 1], [3, 2, 1]]`\nSo, the rows are:\n`c1*A = [2, 1, 1]`\n`c2*A = [3, 2, 1]`\n\nThe observability matrix `O` starts with these rows:\n`O = [[0, 1, 0],`\n     `[1, 1, 0],`\n     `[2, 1, 1],`\n     `[3, 2, 1], ...]`\n\nTo check for observability, we need to find `n=3` linearly independent rows in `O`. Let's take the first three rows:\n`det([[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1]]) = 0*(...) - 1*(1*1 - 0*2) + 0*(...) = -1 â‰  0`\nSince the determinant is non-zero, these three rows are linearly independent. The rank of `O` is 3, which equals the dimension of the state `n`. Thus, the system is observable.\n\n**3. Determine Observability Indices**\n\nThe observer canonical form for a multi-output system depends on its observability indices `(nu_1, nu_2, ..., nu_p)`, where `p` is the number of outputs. We find these by selecting `n` linearly independent rows from `O` in a specific order: `c1, c2, c1*A, c2*A, ...`.\n\n1.  Select `c1 = [0, 1, 0]`. It is non-zero.\n2.  Select `c2 = [1, 1, 0]`. It is linearly independent of `c1`.\n3.  Select `c1*A = [2, 1, 1]`. As shown above, it is linearly independent of `c1` and `c2`.\n\nWe have now found `n=3` linearly independent rows: `{c1, c2, c1*A}`.\n-   Number of rows selected from the `c1` chain (`c1`, `c1*A`, ...): 2. So, `nu_1 = 2`.\n-   Number of rows selected from the `c2` chain (`c2`, `c2*A`, ...): 1. So, `nu_2 = 1`.\nThe sum of indices `nu_1 + nu_2 = 2 + 1 = 3 = n`, which is correct.\n\n**4. Construct the Transformation Matrix `T`**\n\nThe transformation matrix `T` that converts the system to observer canonical form is constructed using the `n` linearly independent rows selected in the previous step. The rows of `T` are ordered according to the observability indices.\n`T` is formed by stacking the rows: `c1, c1*A, ..., c1*A^(nu1-1), c2, ..., c2*A^(nu2-1), ...`\nFor our indices `(nu_1=2, nu_2=1)`, the rows of `T` are `c1`, `c1*A`, and `c2`.\n\n`T = [c1; c1*A; c2] = [[0, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0]]`\n\n**5. Calculate the Inverse of `T`**\n\nTo find the new matrix `C_o = C*T^(-1)`, we need the inverse of `T`.\n`det(T) = 0*(0-1) - 1*(0-1) + 0*(2-1) = 1`\nThe adjugate matrix of `T` is:\n`adj(T) = [[(0-1), -(0-0), (1-0)], [-(0-1), (0-0), -(0-2)], [(2-1), -(0-0), (0-2)]]'`\n`adj(T) = [[-1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2], [1, 0, -2]]'` (Error in manual calculation, let's recompute cofactors carefully)\nCofactors:\n`C11 = -1`, `C12 = -(-1) = 1`, `C13 = 1`\n`C21 = -(0) = 0`, `C22 = 0`, `C23 = -(-1) = 1`\n`C31 = 1`, `C32 = -(0) = 0`, `C33 = -2`\n`adj(T) = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]]' = [[-1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, -2]]`\nSince `det(T) = 1`, `T^(-1) = adj(T)`.\n\n`T^(-1) = [[-1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, -2]]`\n\n**6. Calculate the New Matrix `C_o`**\n\nThe new output matrix is `C_o = C*T^(-1)`.\n`C_o = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[-1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, -2]]`\nPerforming the matrix multiplication:\n-   First row of `C_o`: `[0, 1, 0] * T^(-1) = [1*1 + 0*(-1) + 0*1, 1*0 + 0*0 + 0*1, 1*0 + 0*1 + 0*(-2)] = [1, 0, 0]`\n-   Second row of `C_o`: `[1, 1, 0] * T^(-1) = [1*(-1)+1*1+0*1, 1*0+1*0+0*1, 1*1+1*0+0*(-2)] = [0, 0, 1]`\n\nSo, the new output matrix is:\n`C_o = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n\nThis structure is characteristic of the observer canonical form for a system with observability indices `(2, 1)`. The first output `y1` corresponds to the first canonical state `e1'`, and the second output `y2` corresponds to the `(nu_1 + 1)`-th, i.e., 3rd, canonical state `e3'`."
