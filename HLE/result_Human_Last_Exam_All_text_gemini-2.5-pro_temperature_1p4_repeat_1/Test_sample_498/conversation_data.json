    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sequence to determine the next letter.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the underlying pattern**\nFirst, let's examine the letters in the sequence: Z, X, X, C, V, Y, B, N.\nMost of these letters (Z, X, C, V, B, N) are found on the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard, in order from left to right.\nThe bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard is: **Z X C V B N M**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence as a path on the keyboard**\nThe sequence can be interpreted as a series of movements on the keyboard, starting from 'Z' and generally moving to the right along the bottom row.\n\n*   `Z` -> `X`: The sequence starts with Z and moves one key to the right to X. This follows the base pattern.\n*   `X` -> `X`: The sequence then repeats the letter X. This is the first deviation, a kind of \"stutter\" or pause.\n*   `X` -> `C`: From X, it moves one key to the right to C, resuming the base pattern.\n*   `C` -> `V`: It continues one key to the right to V, following the pattern.\n*   `V` -> `Y` -> `B`: This is the second deviation. The sequence jumps from `V` (bottom row) up to `Y` (top row), and then immediately jumps back down to `B` (bottom row).\n*   **Careful Point:** Note that `B` is the key immediately to the right of `V`. This means the complex `V -> Y -> B` jump effectively accomplishes the same result as a simple one-step move to the right, just with a \"detour\".\n*   `B` -> `N`: After the detour, the sequence resumes its simple pattern, moving one key to the right from B to N.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the next letter**\nThe established pattern is a progression from left to right along the bottom row of the keyboard. While there are interruptions (the 'XX' stutter and the 'VYB' detour), the sequence consistently returns to this fundamental rightward movement. The last step (`B -> N`) was a standard move. Therefore, the most logical next step is to continue this pattern.\n\nFollowing the sequence on the keyboard: after `N`, the next key to the right on the bottom row is `M`.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\nThe sequence traces the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard (Z-X-C-V-B-N-...) with two interruptions. Since the pattern has returned to its simple rightward progression for the last step (B to N), the next letter should continue that progression. The letter to the right of N is M.\n\n<<<M>>>"
