**1. Hotspots for interaction with alpha-1 subunit (binding):**
These residues are located in the conserved Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain of the human beta-1 subunit and form the binding pocket for the alpha-1 subunit's Alpha Interaction Domain (AID). The positions refer to the canonical human beta-1b sequence (UniProt P54283).
*   **Tyrosine-385 (Y385)**
*   **Leucine-388 (L388)**
*   **Tryptophan-416 (W416)**
*   **Isoleucine-417 (I417)**
*   **Arginine-443 (R443)**
*   **Glutamic Acid-447 (E447)**
*   **Aspartic Acid-449 (D449)**
*   **Isoleucine-462 (I462)**

**2. Hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties (gating modulation):**
These residues are primarily located in the variable N- and C-terminal regions of the human beta-1b subunit and allosterically modulate the gating kinetics of the alpha-1 subunit after binding.
*   **N-Terminus Motif:** A poly-arginine motif consisting of **Arginine-21 (R21), Arginine-22 (R22), Arginine-23 (R23), and Arginine-24 (R24)**. This motif is a major determinant of voltage-dependent inactivation.
*   **C-Terminus Residue:** **Leucine-575 (L575)**. This residue in the distal C-terminus is critical for controlling channel inactivation properties.
