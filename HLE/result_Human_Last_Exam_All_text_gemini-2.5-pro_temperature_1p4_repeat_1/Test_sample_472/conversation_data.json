    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion of the line:\n\"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\nThe line is an iambic senarius, a meter common in Roman comedy (Plautus, Terence). It consists of six iambic feet. The basic iambic foot is a short syllable followed by a long syllable (S L). However, various substitutions are allowed, making the meter flexible. Common substitutions include a spondee (L L), an anapest (S S L), a dactyl (L S S, especially in the first foot), or a tribrach (S S S) in place of an iamb.\n\n**Step 1: Syllabification and Basic Quantities**\nFirst, we break the line into syllables and determine their natural quantity (long or short).\n*   A syllable is long by nature if it contains a long vowel or a diphthong.\n*   A syllable is long by position if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (even across word boundaries) or a double consonant like 'x'.\n*   A syllable ending in a short vowel followed by a single consonant is short.\n*   The final syllable of a line is considered long (*brevis in longo*).\n\n`et | ti-bi | be-ne | es-se | so-li | quom | si-bi | sit | ma-le`\n\n*   `et`: Long. It's a closed syllable (ends in a consonant).\n*   `tibi` (`tĭbĭ`): Two short syllables.\n*   `bene` (`bĕnĕ`): Two short syllables.\n*   `esse`: `es-` is long by position (followed by `ss`). `-se` (`ĕ`) is short. So, L S.\n*   `soli`: From `sōlus`, dative `sōlī`. Classically, this is two long syllables (L L). However, in Plautine meter, the final `-i` of a dative can be short. This would make it `sōlĭ` (L S). This is a key point for scanning the line correctly.\n*   `quom`: Long. It is a closed syllable.\n*   `sibi` (`sĭbĭ`): Two short syllables.\n*   `sit`: Long by position. The short vowel `ĭ` is followed by two consonants: the `t` of `sit` and the `m` of the next word, `male`.\n*   `male` (`mălĕ`): The first syllable `ma-` is short. The final syllable `-le` is also short, but as the last syllable of the line, it is treated as long. So, S L.\n\n**Step 2: Dividing the Line into Metrical Feet**\nNow we group the syllables into six feet, following the rules of the iambic senarius.\n\n*   **Feet 5 and 6:** The end of the line is often the most regular. Let's start there.\n    *   `sibi sit male` -> The last foot must be an iamb (S L). `male` scans as **S L**. This fits perfectly.\n    *   This leaves `sibi sit` for the fifth foot. `sibi` is S S, and `sit` is L. This forms an anapest (**S S L**), which is a very common substitution.\n    *   So, the last two feet are: `sibi sit | male` -> `S S L | S L`.\n\n*   **Feet 1-4:** We now need to scan the remaining part: `et tibi bene esse soli quom`.\n    *   **Foot 1:** `et tibi`. `et` is L, `tibi` is S S. This forms a dactyl (**L S S**). A dactyl is a permitted substitution in the first foot of an iambic senarius.\n    *   **Foot 2:** This leaves `bene esse...`. `bene` is S S. The first syllable of `esse`, which is `es-`, is L. This forms an anapest (**S S L**), using the syllables `be-ne es-`. This is also a valid substitution.\n    *   **Feet 3 and 4:** We are left with the syllables `-se soli quom`. Here is where our analysis of `soli` becomes critical. We determined `soli` can be scanned as `sōlĭ` (L S). The syllables are `-se` (S), `sō-` (L), `-lĭ` (S), and `quom` (L).\n    *   This sequence `S L S L` divides perfectly into two iambic feet.\n    *   Foot 3: `-se sō-` -> **S L** (Iamb).\n    *   Foot 4: `-lĭ quom` -> **S L** (Iamb).\n\n**Step 3: Assembling the Final Scansion**\nPutting all the feet together, we get a complete and valid scansion of the line.\n\n*   Foot 1: `et tibi` -> **L S S** (Dactyl)\n*   Foot 2: `bene es-` -> **S S L** (Anapest)\n*   Foot 3: `-se so-` -> **S L** (Iamb)\n*   Foot 4: `-li quom` -> **S L** (Iamb)\n*   Foot 5: `sibi sit` -> **S S L** (Anapest)\n*   Foot 6: `male` -> **S L** (Iamb)\n\nThe resulting scansion, with spaces between the feet, is:\nL S S S S L S L S L S S L S L\n\n<<<L S S S S L S L S L S S L S L>>>"
