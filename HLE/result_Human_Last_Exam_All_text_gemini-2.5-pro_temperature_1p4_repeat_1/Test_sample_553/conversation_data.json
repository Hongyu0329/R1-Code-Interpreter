    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the song.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Song by The Beatles:** The search is limited to the discography of The Beatles.\n    *   **Starts with:** The chord change must be the very first musical event or a prominent part of the introduction.\n    *   **Chord jump from the tonic...:** The first chord must be the \"home\" chord of the song's key, also known as the \"I\" chord in Roman numeral analysis. For a song in G Major, the tonic is a G Major chord.\n    *   **...to the minor fifth chord:** This is the most crucial part. The \"fifth\" refers to the chord built on the fifth note of the scale. In a major key, the chord built on the fifth is naturally a *major* chord (the V chord, or dominant). For example, in G Major, the fifth is D, and the standard V chord is D Major. A \"minor fifth chord\" means this chord is altered to be minor. So, in the key of G Major, the progression would be G Major to D *minor*. This is an unconventional progression (I → v) often achieved through \"modal interchange\" (borrowing a chord from the parallel minor key).\n\n2.  **Search for Potential Candidates:**\n    We need to find a Beatles song in a major key that begins with a I chord followed immediately by a v chord.\n\n    *   Let's consider the song **\"I'll Be Back\"** from the album *A Hard Day's Night*.\n    *   The song is in the key of **A Major**.\n    *   The tonic (I) chord is **A Major**.\n    *   The fifth note of the A Major scale is E. The standard dominant (V) chord would be E Major.\n    *   The song famously opens with a repeating acoustic guitar figure. The first chord played is **A Major**. The very next chord it jumps to is **E minor**.\n    *   This progression, **A Major → E minor**, perfectly matches the description of a jump from the tonic (I) to the minor fifth chord (v).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Other Famous Beatles Intros:**\n    *   **\"A Hard Day's Night\":** Starts with a famous, complex, and dissonant chord (often analyzed as G7sus4/F or similar), not a simple tonic.\n    *   **\"Help!\":** The guitar part follows the vocal line in a descending pattern; the progression is not a simple I → v jump.\n    *   **\"Yesterday\":** In F Major, it starts on the F Major (I) chord but moves to Em7 (the minor seventh chord, vii), not the minor fifth.\n    *   **\"I Feel Fine\":** In G Major, the progression is G → D7 → C. It goes from the tonic (I) to the *dominant 7th* (V7), not the minor fifth.\n    *   **\"Things We Said Today\":** This song is in A minor. It starts with an A minor chord (the tonic) and moves to an E minor chord (the v chord). While this is a tonic to minor fifth jump (i → v), it occurs within a minor key where the v chord is natural. The I → v progression in a major key, as found in \"I'll Be Back,\" is a much more distinctive and unusual harmonic device, and is generally what musicians refer to with this type of question.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Tonic:** The key can be major or minor, but the question's phrasing usually implies a major key tonic unless specified otherwise. The I → v move in a major key is far more striking than the i → v move in a minor key.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** It is critical to distinguish this from the standard dominant chord (V), which is major, or the dominant 7th chord (V7). The minor quality of the chord is the key identifier.\n*   **\"Starts with\":** The progression must be at the very beginning, setting the song's mood. The A → Em shift in \"I'll Be Back\" is the first thing you hear and is the song's main instrumental hook.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe song that fits the description perfectly is \"I'll Be Back.\" It begins in A Major (the tonic) and immediately jumps to E minor (the minor fifth chord), establishing the song's melancholic and indecisive feel right from the start.\n\n<<<I'll Be Back>>>"
