    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function `f`**\n\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n1.  **Injectivity:** The function on the right-hand side, $g(x) = e^x$, is strictly increasing and therefore injective (one-to-one). If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since $e^x$ is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, any solution $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:** A fundamental theorem in real analysis states that a continuous and injective function defined on an interval (in this case, $\\mathbb{R}$) must be strictly monotonic. Thus, any solution $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the case where `f` is strictly decreasing**\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n1.  **Bijectivity:** Since $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its limits at infinity must be $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$ and $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$. This means the range of $f$ is $\\mathbb{R}$, so $f$ is a bijection from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2.  **Fixed Point:** Consider the function $h(x) = f(x) - x$. Since $f$ is continuous, $h$ is also continuous. We have:\n    *   $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} h(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} (f(x) - x) = \\infty - (-\\infty) = \\infty$.\n    *   $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} h(x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} (f(x) - x) = -\\infty - \\infty = -\\infty$.\n    By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist at least one point $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $h(x_0) = 0$, which means $f(x_0) = x_0$. This point $x_0$ is a fixed point of $f$.\n\n3.  **Contradiction:** If $x_0$ is a fixed point of $f$, then $f(x_0) = x_0$. Applying $f$ again gives $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. However, the given equation requires $f(f(x_0)) = e^{x_0}$. Therefore, the fixed point must satisfy the equation $x_0 = e^{x_0}$.\n    The equation $x = e^x$ has no real solutions. This can be shown by considering the function $k(x) = e^x - x$. Its derivative is $k'(x) = e^x - 1$, which is zero only at $x=0$. The minimum value of $k(x)$ is $k(0) = e^0 - 0 = 1$. Since the minimum value is positive, $e^x - x > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, meaning $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    The fact that the required fixed point cannot exist is a contradiction. Therefore, there are **no** strictly decreasing continuous functions that satisfy the given equation.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the case where `f` is strictly increasing**\n\nNow, let's assume $f$ is a strictly increasing continuous function.\n1.  **Range of `f`:** Let the range of $f$ be $R(f)$. The range of $f \\circ f$ is $f(R(f))$. We know the range of $e^x$ is $(0, \\infty)$, so $f(R(f)) = (0, \\infty)$. Since $f$ is continuous and strictly increasing on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range is an open interval, $R(f) = (a, b)$, where $a = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)$ and $b = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)$.\n    So, $f((a,b)) = (0, \\infty)$. Since $f$ is increasing, this implies $\\lim_{y \\to a^+} f(y) = 0$ and $\\lim_{y \\to b^-} f(y) = \\infty$.\n    The condition $\\lim_{y \\to b^-} f(y) = \\infty$ implies $b=\\infty$.\n    The condition $\\lim_{y \\to a^+} f(y) = 0$ implies that $a$ cannot be $-\\infty$ (as that would mean $\\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} f(y) = -\\infty$, not 0). So, $a$ must be a finite real number, which we'll call $c_0$.\n\n2.  **Properties of the solution:**\n    *   $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = c_0$ and $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = \\infty$.\n    *   The range of $f$ is $(c_0, \\infty)$. This means $f(x) > c_0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   Since $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\lim_{y \\to c_0^+} f(y) = 0$, we can evaluate $f$ at $c_0$ to get $f(c_0)=0$.\n    *   As $f(c_0) = 0$ must be in the range $(c_0, \\infty)$, we must have $0 > c_0$. So, $c_0$ is a negative number.\n\n3.  **Construction and Counting of Solutions:**\n    We can construct solutions based on these properties. The construction depends on making two initial choices:\n    a.  **Choice of `c_0`:** We can choose any negative real number for $c_0$. The set of possible choices is $(-\\infty, 0)$, which has a cardinality of $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., the size of the set of real numbers). Each different choice of $c_0$ will result in a function with a different range, $(c_0, \\infty)$, thus they are distinct functions.\n\n    b.  **Choice of a function segment:** Let $c_1=f(c_0)=0$ and $c_2=f(c_1)=f(0)$. From the original equation, $f(f(c_0))=e^{c_0}$, so $f(0)=e^{c_0}$.\n    A solution $f$ must map the interval $[c_0, 0]$ to the interval $[f(c_0), f(0)] = [0, e^{c_0}]$. The function $f$ on this \"base\" interval can be any continuous, strictly increasing function $\\phi: [c_0, 0] \\to [0, e^{c_0}]$. The number of such functions (homeomorphisms between the two intervals) is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. For example, one can add a small multiple of a \"bump\" function like $A(x-c_0)(x-0)$ to a linear map to generate continuously many such functions.\n\n    Once $c_0$ is chosen and the function $f$ is defined on the interval $[c_0, 0]$, the function is uniquely determined for all other $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ by the equation $f(f(x))=e^x$. For instance:\n    *   For $x \\in [0, e^{c_0}]$, $f(x) = e^{f^{-1}(x)}$ where $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of $f$ on $[c_0, 0]$.\n    *   For $x \\in (-\\infty, c_0)$, $f(x) = f^{-1}(e^x)$.\n\n    Since there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for $c_0$, and for each of these, there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ ways to define the function on the base interval, the total number of increasing solutions is at least $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion on Cardinality**\n\n1.  The set $S$ of all solutions contains only strictly increasing functions.\n2.  The number of such increasing solutions is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n3.  The set $S$ is a subset of the set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. The cardinality of the set of all continuous functions is $\\mathfrak{c}$, because a continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on a countable dense subset like the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, so $|S| \\le |\\mathbb{R}^\\mathbb{Q}| = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n4.  Combining the two bounds, $\\mathfrak{c} \\le |S| \\le \\mathfrak{c}$, we conclude that the cardinality of the set $S$ is exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
