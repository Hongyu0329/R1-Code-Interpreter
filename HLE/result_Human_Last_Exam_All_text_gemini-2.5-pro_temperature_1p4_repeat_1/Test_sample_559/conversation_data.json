    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the system of differential equations.**\nThe system is given by:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (5u^2(t) - 3u(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1 - u(t))$\n2.  $u'(t) = u^2(t)(u(t) - 1)$\n\nWe are considering the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points of the system.**\nEquilibrium points (or critical points) are points $(d, u)$ where both $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\n\nFirst, set $u' = 0$:\n$u^2(u - 1) = 0$\nThis gives us two possible values for $u$: $u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\nNow, for each value of $u$, we find the corresponding value(s) of $d$ by setting $d' = 0$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substitute $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$:\n    $2d^2 + (5(0)^2 - 3(0))d - 0^3(1 - 0) = 0$\n    $2d^2 = 0$\n    $d = 0$\n    So, one equilibrium point is **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substitute $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$:\n    $2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d - 1^3(1 - 1) = 0$\n    $2d^2 + (5 - 3)d - 0 = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n    $2d(d + 1) = 0$\n    This gives $d = 0$ or $d = -1$.\n    So, two more equilibrium points are **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\nThe equilibrium points are (0, 0), (0, 1), and (-1, 1).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the nature of the equilibrium points (focus on finding saddle points).**\nTo understand the behavior of trajectories near the equilibrium points, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system. Let $f(d,u) = d'$ and $g(d,u) = u'$.\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d + 5u^2 - 3u & (10u-3)d - (3u^2-4u^3) \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\nSince the Jacobian is an upper triangular matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries:\n$\\lambda_1 = 4d + 5u^2 - 3u$\n$\\lambda_2 = 3u^2 - 2u = u(3u - 2)$\n\nNow we evaluate the eigenvalues at the equilibrium point (-1, 1):\n*   At **(-1, 1)**:\n    $\\lambda_1 = 4(-1) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) = -4 + 5 - 3 = -2$\n    $\\lambda_2 = 1(3(1) - 2) = 1$\nThe eigenvalues are -2 and 1. Since they are real and have opposite signs, the equilibrium point **(-1, 1) is a saddle point**.\n\nA separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. Separatrices are formed by the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\n**Step 4: Search for an invariant manifold.**\nAn invariant manifold is a curve such that any trajectory that starts on the curve remains on the curve for all time. We can look for a simple relationship between $d$ and $u$ that might define such a curve. Let's test if a curve of the form $d = au^2$ can be an invariant manifold.\n\nIf $d = au^2$, then using the chain rule, $d' = \\frac{d}{dt}(au^2) = 2au \\cdot u'$.\nSubstituting the expression for $u'$, we get:\n$d' = 2au(u^2(u - 1)) = 2au^4 - 2au^3$.\n\nNow, substitute $d = au^2$ into the original equation for $d'$:\n$d' = 2(au^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(au^2) - u^3(1 - u)$\n$d' = 2a^2u^4 + (5au^4 - 3au^3) + u^4 - u^3$\n$d' = (2a^2 + 5a + 1)u^4 + (-3a - 1)u^3$.\n\nFor $d = au^2$ to be a solution, the two expressions for $d'$ must be identical. We can equate the coefficients of the powers of $u$:\n1.  Coefficient of $u^4$: $2a = 2a^2 + 5a + 1 \\implies 2a^2 + 3a + 1 = 0$\n2.  Coefficient of $u^3$: $-2a = -3a - 1 \\implies a = -1$\n\nLet's check if $a = -1$ satisfies the first equation:\n$2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) + 1 = 2 - 3 + 1 = 0$.\nIt does. Therefore, $a = -1$ gives a valid solution.\n\nThis means the curve defined by **$d = -u^2$** is an invariant manifold of the system.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the invariant manifold as the separatrix.**\nWe need to check if this invariant manifold is related to the saddle point (-1, 1).\nLet's substitute $u=1$ into the equation of the curve:\n$d = -(1)^2 = -1$.\nThe point (-1, 1) lies on the curve $d = -u^2$.\n\nAn invariant manifold that passes through a saddle point must be its stable or unstable manifold (or a union of them). The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are by definition separatrices.\n\nTherefore, the curve $d = -u^2$ is a separatrix of the system. In fact, by analyzing the eigenvectors of the Jacobian at (-1, 1), one can show that $d = -u^2$ corresponds to the unstable manifold of the saddle point."
