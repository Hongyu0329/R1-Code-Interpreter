    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Key Elements of the Question:**\n*   **\"Academy Award for Best Picture winner\":** The film must have won this specific award.\n*   **\"Luxor Obelisk\":** The film must visually depict one of the two famous obelisks originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n*   **\"First\":** We must search chronologically through the list of Best Picture winners.\n\n**2. Identify the Luxor Obelisks and Their Locations:**\nThere are two Luxor Obelisks that are the subject of the question:\n*   One remains at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   The second was transported to France in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the **Place de la Concorde in Paris**.\n\nTherefore, a qualifying film would likely be set in either Paris (featuring the Place de la Concorde) or Luxor, Egypt (featuring the temple). The Paris location is far more common in early Hollywood cinema.\n\n**3. Chronological Review of Best Picture Winners:**\nWe will examine the winners year by year, looking for films set in Paris or Egypt.\n\n*   **1927/28 to 1936:** The winners from this period (*Wings*, *The Broadway Melody*, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, *Cimarron*, *Grand Hotel*, *Cavalcade*, *It Happened One Night*, *Mutiny on the Bounty*, *The Great Ziegfeld*) are not set in locations that would feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n*   **1937 - *The Life of Emile Zola***: This film is set primarily in Paris. As a biopic of a famous French writer, it is a potential candidate. However, the film's scenes focus on interiors like courtrooms, Zola's home, and cafes, as well as the military courtyard for the Dreyfus degradation. It does not feature prominent establishing shots of the Place de la Concorde. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria.\n\n*   **1938 to 1942:** The winners in this period are *You Can't Take It with You* (New York City), *Gone with the Wind* (American South), *Rebecca* (England), *How Green Was My Valley* (Wales), and *Mrs. Miniver* (England). None are set in the required locations.\n\n*   **1943 - *Casablanca***: The film is mostly set in Casablanca, Morocco. However, it contains a crucial and extended flashback sequence detailing Rick and Ilsa's romance in **Paris** just before the Nazi occupation.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must verify if the Luxor Obelisk at the Place de la Concorde is shown during this flashback.\n    *   **Verification:** During a romantic montage of Rick and Ilsa's time together, there is a distinct shot of them riding in a horse-drawn carriage. The camera pans with them as they pass through the Place de la Concorde, and the **Luxor Obelisk is clearly visible** in the background.\n\n*   **Subsequent Winners:** Films that won later, such as *An American in Paris* (1951) and *Gigi* (1958), are also set in Paris and prominently feature the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk. However, since *Casablanca* won for the year 1943, it precedes them. No Best Picture winner set in Egypt features the remaining obelisk at the Luxor Temple before this time.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy proceeding chronologically through the list of Best Picture winners, we can eliminate early contenders based on their settings. The first winner set in a location with a Luxor Obelisk is *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), but it does not depict the landmark. The next relevant winner is *Casablanca* (1943), which definitively shows the Luxor Obelisk in Paris's Place de la Concorde during its flashback sequence. Therefore, it is the first to meet all the criteria.\n\n<<<Casablanca>>>"
