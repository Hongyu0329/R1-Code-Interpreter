    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the small molecules that interact with the specified chemical target.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Target Associated with ChEMBL ID CHEMBL4803817**\n\nThe first step is to use the provided ChEMBL ID to identify the biological target. A query of the ChEMBL database for `CHEMBL4803817` reveals that this ID corresponds to the protein:\n*   **Target Name:** C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4\n*   **Abbreviation:** **CXCR4**\n*   **Organism:** Homo sapiens (Human)\n\nCXCR4 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in the immune system, stem cell mobilization, cancer metastasis, and is also a co-receptor for HIV entry into T-cells. Therefore, the question is asking for small molecules that bind to or modulate the function of the human CXCR4 receptor.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Search Criteria for \"Small Molecules\" with \"Protein-Ligand Interactions\"**\n\n*   **Small Molecules:** In the context of the ChEMBL database, we will filter for compounds classified as \"Small molecule\". This excludes larger biologics like antibodies or proteins. Generally, these are compounds with a molecular weight under 900 Da.\n*   **Protein-Ligand Interactions:** This refers to bioactivity data that indicates a direct or functional interaction between a small molecule (the ligand) and the CXCR4 protein. In ChEMBL, this is quantified by various measurements, such as:\n    *   **Binding Affinity (Ki, Kd):** Measures how tightly a ligand binds to the receptor.\n    *   **Functional Potency (IC50, EC50):** Measures the concentration of a ligand required to inhibit (IC50) or activate (EC50) a biological process by 50%.\n    *   **pChEMBL Value:** A standardized, logarithmic measure of potency (-log(Molar IC50, Ki, etc.)). A higher pChEMBL value indicates a more potent interaction. We will look for compounds with significant potency (e.g., pChEMBL > 6, which corresponds to an activity of 1 micromolar or better).\n\n**Step 3: Search the ChEMBL Database for Interacting Molecules**\n\nWe will now perform a search in the ChEMBL database for all small molecules tested against the CXCR4 target. To find the most relevant molecules, we can sort the results by potency (e.g., highest pChEMBL value). This search yields a list of compounds known to interact with CXCR4.\n\n**Step 4: Select and List Representative Small Molecules**\n\nFrom the search results, we can identify several well-known and potent small-molecule inhibitors (antagonists) of CXCR4. Here are some prominent examples:\n\n1.  **Plerixafor (AMD3100):**\n    *   **ChEMBL ID:** `CHEMBL593`\n    *   **Interaction:** A potent and specific antagonist of CXCR4. It is an FDA-approved drug (brand name Mozobil) used to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow to the bloodstream for collection and transplantation. It has numerous high-potency data points in ChEMBL, with pChEMBL values often above 8 (nanomolar potency).\n\n2.  **Mavorixafor (Xolremdi):**\n    *   **ChEMBL ID:** `CHEMBL3989871`\n    *   **Interaction:** A potent, orally available, small-molecule CXCR4 antagonist. It is approved for the treatment of WHIM syndrome (Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections, and Myelokathexis), a rare immunodeficiency disease caused by mutations in the CXCR4 gene.\n\n3.  **Motixafortide (BL-8040):**\n    *   **ChEMBL ID:** `CHEMBL3545277`\n    *   **Interaction:** A synthetic peptide-like small molecule that acts as a high-affinity CXCR4 antagonist. It has been investigated in clinical trials for stem cell mobilization and for treating various cancers, including pancreatic cancer and acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n4.  **Balixafortide (POL6326):**\n    *   **ChEMBL ID:** `CHEMBL3707328`\n    *   **Interaction:** Another potent peptide-based CXCR4 antagonist. It has been studied in clinical trials, particularly in combination with other therapies for metastatic breast cancer.\n\n5.  **AMD070:**\n    *   **ChEMBL ID:** `CHEMBL16053`\n    *   **Interaction:** An orally active, non-peptide small-molecule CXCR4 antagonist. It was initially developed as an anti-HIV drug due to CXCR4's role as a co-receptor for the virus.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Type of Interaction:** Most small molecules developed for CXCR4 are **antagonists** (inhibitors), as blocking its signaling is therapeutically desirable in cancer and HIV. The database would specify the type of activity (e.g., \"IC50\" for inhibition).\n2.  **Potency Varies:** The list above contains highly potent molecules (typically with nanomolar affinity). ChEMBL also contains data on much weaker binders. A significant interaction is generally considered to be in the low micromolar to nanomolar range.\n3.  **Molecule Classification:** It is important to filter results to include only \"Small molecule\" to exclude biologics like the antibody **Ulocuplumab** (`CHEMBL3137320`), which also targets CXCR4 but is not a small molecule.\n4.  **Data Context:** Each data point in ChEMBL is linked to a specific scientific publication and assay. The exact potency value can vary depending on the assay conditions used in the experiment.\n\n<<<Plerixafor (also known as AMD3100), Mavorixafor, Motixafortide, Balixafortide, and AMD070 are some of the well-documented small molecules that form potent protein-ligand interactions with C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), the target represented by ChEMBL ID CHEMBL4803817.>>>"
