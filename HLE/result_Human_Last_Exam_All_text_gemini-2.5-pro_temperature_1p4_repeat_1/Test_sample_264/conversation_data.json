    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis and Careful Points\n\n**1. Understanding the Geometry and Setting up a Coordinate System**\n\n*   We are given two identical cubes, each with a side length of 1.\n*   To analyze their intersection, it's best to place them in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system.\n*   Let's place the first cube, Cube A, in a standard position with one corner at the origin (0, 0, 0) and its edges aligned with the coordinate axes.\n*   Therefore, Cube A is the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n    `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n    `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n    `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n**2. Interpreting the Shift**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The most crucial step is to correctly interpret the phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\".\n*   A **main diagonal** (or body diagonal) of a cube connects two opposite vertices. For Cube A in our chosen coordinate system, the main diagonal connects the origin (0, 0, 0) to the vertex (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n*   The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" can be ambiguous. There are two common interpretations:\n    1.  **Interpretation 1 (Parametric Shift):** The shift is proportional to the diagonal's coordinate vector. A shift \"by 1/2\" is applied to each component of the diagonal vector. This results in a shift vector **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This is a common convention in geometry problems for its mathematical simplicity and elegance.\n    2.  **Interpretation 2 (Euclidean Distance Shift):** The magnitude of the shift is a distance of 1/2 along the direction of the main diagonal. This would result in a shift vector of `(1/2) * (unit vector of **d**)`, which is a more complex value.\n*   Given the typical context of such problems, Interpretation 1 is the most likely intended meaning as it leads to a clean, rational answer. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n**3. Defining the Position of the Second Cube**\n\n*   Cube B is the result of shifting Cube A by the vector **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n*   To find the coordinates defining Cube B, we add the shift vector to the bounds of Cube A.\n*   For a point (x, y, z) in Cube B, its coordinates are defined by:\n    `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n    `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n    `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n**4. Finding the Intersection**\n\n*   The intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that belongs to both Cube A and Cube B. A point (x, y, z) in the intersection must satisfy the inequalities for both cubes simultaneously.\n*   We find the overlapping range for each coordinate independently.\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** The point must satisfy `0 ≤ x ≤ 1` (from Cube A) AND `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2` (from Cube B). The combined condition is `max(0, 1/2) ≤ x ≤ min(1, 3/2)`, which simplifies to `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`.\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** Similarly, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1` AND `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2` leads to `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`.\n*   **For the z-coordinate:** Similarly, `0 ≤ z ≤ 1` AND `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2` leads to `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n*   **Careful Point:** The resulting intersection is itself a rectangular prism (specifically, a cube) with its edges aligned with the coordinate axes. This makes the volume calculation straightforward.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n**Step 1: Define the shape of the intersection.**\nThe analysis above shows that the intersection is the region defined by:\n`1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n`1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n`1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`\nThis is a cube.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the side length of the intersection cube.**\nThe length of the side along the x-axis is the difference between the upper and lower bounds: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\nThe length of the side along the y-axis is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\nThe length of the side along the z-axis is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\nSo, the intersection is a cube with a side length of 1/2.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the volume of the intersection cube.**\nThe volume of a cube is the side length cubed.\nVolume = (Side Length)³\nVolume = (1/2)³\nVolume = 1/8\n\nThus, the volume of the intersection of the two cubes is 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
