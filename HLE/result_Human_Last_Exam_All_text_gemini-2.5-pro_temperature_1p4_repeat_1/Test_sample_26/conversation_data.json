    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the space X and its basic topological properties.\n1.  **The Space X:** $X$ is a hypersurface in complex projective 3-space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ defined by a single smooth homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n2.  **Dimension:** $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a complex manifold of dimension 3 (real dimension 6). A hypersurface in it, like $X$, is a complex manifold of dimension $3-1=2$ (real dimension 4).\n3.  **Fundamental Group $\\pi_1(X)$:** The Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem for homotopy groups states that for a smooth subvariety $X$ of dimension $n$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^N$, the inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^N$ induces isomorphisms $i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^N)$ for $k < n$. Here, $X$ has complex dimension $n=2$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. Thus, the map $i_*: \\pi_1(X) \\to \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is an isomorphism. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$), we conclude that $X$ is also simply connected, i.e., $\\pi_1(X)=0$.\n4.  **Homology Groups $H_k(X)$:**\n    *   Since $\\pi_1(X)=0$, its abelianization $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is also 0.\n    *   As $X$ is a compact, connected, oriented 4-manifold, we know $H_0(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_4(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   By Poincaré Duality, $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H^{4-3}(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. By the Universal Coefficient Theorem, $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Ext}(H_0(X, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$. Since $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$ and $H_0(X, \\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}$ is free, this gives $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. Thus, $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$.\n    *   To find $H_2(X)$, we compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$. For a degree $d$ hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the top Chern class (which integrates to $\\chi$) can be found using the adjunction formula. For a quintic ($d=5$) in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ ($n=3$), the Euler characteristic is $\\chi(X) = 55$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic is also the alternating sum of Betti numbers: $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$.\n    *   Plugging in the known values: $55 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n    *   This gives $b_2(X) = 53$. Since $X$ is a simply connected Kähler manifold, its second homology group is torsion-free. Therefore, $H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Homotopy and Homology.\n1.  **Second Homotopy Group $\\pi_2(X)$:** Since $X$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(X)=0$), the Hurewicz theorem states that $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. Therefore, $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n2.  **Third Homotopy Group $\\pi_3(X)$:** For a simply connected space, J.H.C. Whitehead showed there is a natural exact sequence:\n    $$H_4(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\xrightarrow{P} \\Gamma(\\pi_2(X)) \\xrightarrow{J} \\pi_3(X) \\to H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0$$\n    where $\\Gamma$ is Whitehead's universal quadratic functor.\n3.  **Applying the sequence to X:** We have $H_4(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$, and $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$. The sequence simplifies to:\n    $$\\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{P} \\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53}) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to 0$$\n    This implies that $\\pi_3(X)$ is the cokernel of the map $P$. So, $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53}) / \\text{Im}(P)$.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the terms in the sequence.\n1.  **The group $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53})$:** The functor $\\Gamma$ has the property that $\\Gamma(A \\oplus B) \\cong \\Gamma(A) \\oplus \\Gamma(B) \\oplus (A \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} B)$. By repeated application, we get:\n    $$\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53}) \\cong \\left( \\bigoplus_{i=1}^{53} \\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}) \\right) \\oplus \\left( \\bigoplus_{1 \\le i < j \\le 53} \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Z} \\right)$$\n    The group $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to $\\pi_3(K(\\mathbb{Z}, 2))$, where $K(\\mathbb{Z}, 2)$ is the Eilenberg-MacLane space, which can be modeled by $\\mathbb{CP}^\\infty$. The long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the fibration $S^1 \\to S^\\infty \\to \\mathbb{CP}^\\infty$ shows that $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^\\infty) \\cong \\pi_2(S^1)=0$. Thus, $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z})=0$.\n    The formula simplifies to:\n    $$\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{1 \\le i < j \\le 53} \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{\\binom{53}{2}}$$\n    The rank is $\\binom{53}{2} = \\frac{53 \\times 52}{2} = 53 \\times 26 = 1378$.\n2.  **The map $P$:** The map $P: H_4(X) \\to \\Gamma(\\pi_2(X))$ is determined by the intersection form $Q: H_2(X) \\times H_2(X) \\to \\mathbb{Z}$. A fundamental result states that any indefinite, odd, unimodular quadratic form over $\\mathbb{Z}$ (which the intersection form of a quintic surface is) is diagonalizable. This means there exists a basis $\\{e_i\\}$ for $H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\pi_2(X)$ in which the intersection matrix is diagonal.\n3.  **Image of P:** In such a diagonal basis, the cross terms $Q(e_i, e_j)$ for $i \\ne j$ are zero. The formula for the image of the generator of $H_4(X)$ under $P$ simplifies, becoming an element that lies entirely in the $\\bigoplus \\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z} e_i)$ part of $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53})$. Since we established that each $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}e_i) \\cong \\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z})$ is the trivial group, the image of $P$ is the zero element.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation.\nSince the image of the map $P$ is zero, we have:\n$$\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53}) / \\{0\\} \\cong \\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{1378}$$\nThe rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is the rank of this free abelian group.\n\nThe rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is 1378.\n\n<<<1378>>>"
