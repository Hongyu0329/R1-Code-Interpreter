    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the sequence and the given options.**\nSequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\nOptions: A. 291, B. 285, C. 171, D. 167\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between consecutive terms.**\nLet's try to find a pattern by looking at how one term is generated from the previous one. We can test for simple arithmetic (addition) or geometric (multiplication) relationships.\n\n**Method 1: Subtraction (finding the difference)**\n*   11 - 2 = 9\n*   23 - 11 = 12\n*   51 - 23 = 28\n*   119 - 51 = 68\nThe sequence of differences is 9, 12, 28, 68. This sequence does not have an obvious simple pattern.\n\n**Method 2: Multiplication and Addition/Subtraction**\nLet's test for a pattern of the form `Next Term = (Previous Term * Constant) +/- Another Value`. Let's try multiplying by 2 or 3 as these are common in such problems.\n\nLet's try multiplying by 2:\n*   2 * 2 = 4. To get 11, we need to add 7. (2 * 2 + 7 = 11)\n*   11 * 2 = 22. To get 23, we need to add 1. (11 * 2 + 1 = 23)\n*   23 * 2 = 46. To get 51, we need to add 5. (23 * 2 + 5 = 51)\n*   51 * 2 = 102. To get 119, we need to add 17. (51 * 2 + 17 = 119)\nThe sequence of added numbers is 7, 1, 5, 17. This does not reveal an immediate simple pattern.\n\nLet's try multiplying by 3:\n*   3 * 2 = 6. To get 11, we need to add 5. (3 * 2 + 5 = 11)\n*   3 * 11 = 33. To get 23, we need to subtract 10. (3 * 11 - 10 = 23)\n*   3 * 23 = 69. To get 51, we need to subtract 18. (3 * 23 - 18 = 51)\n*   3 * 51 = 153. To get 119, we need to subtract 34. (3 * 51 - 34 = 119)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the emerging pattern.**\nThe pattern seems to be `Next Term = (Previous Term * 3) - X`, starting from the second term. The sequence of numbers being subtracted is 10, 18, 34. Let's find the pattern within this new sequence.\n\n*   Sequence of subtractions: 10, 18, 34\n*   Let's find the difference between these terms:\n    *   18 - 10 = 8\n    *   34 - 18 = 16\n\n**Step 4: Identify the final pattern and apply it.**\nThe differences of the subtracted numbers are 8 and 16. This is a clear geometric progression where each term is twice the previous one (8, 8*2=16, ...).\n*   The next difference in this sequence should be 16 * 2 = 32.\n*   Therefore, the next number in the subtraction sequence (10, 18, 34, ...) will be 34 + 32 = 66.\n\nNow we can calculate the missing term in the original sequence:\n*   The last known term is 119.\n*   The rule is `Next Term = (Previous Term * 3) - (Next subtraction term)`.\n*   Next Term = (119 * 3) - 66\n*   Next Term = 357 - 66\n*   Next Term = 291\n\n**Step 5: Check the answer against the options.**\nThe calculated next term is 291, which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's common for a pattern not to apply to the very first term in a sequence. Here, the `*3 - X` rule consistently applies from the second term onwards.\n*   Sometimes there can be multiple possible patterns. It's important to find one that is consistent and logical. The pattern found here (`a_n = 3*a_(n-1) - d_n`, where the second differences of `d_n` form a geometric progression) is strong and self-consistent.\n*   Always double-check calculations (e.g., 3 * 51 = 153, 153 - 119 = 34. Correct).\n\nFinal calculation is: 3 * 119 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
