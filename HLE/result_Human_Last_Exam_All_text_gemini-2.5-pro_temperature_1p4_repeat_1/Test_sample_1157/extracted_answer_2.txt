**Management Plan:**
1.  **Emergency Phase:** Immediate referral to a physician to begin treatment for uncontrolled diabetes. Dental management involves wound irrigation, suturing of sockets, and prescription of antibiotics and analgesics.
2.  **Interim Phase:** Fabrication of a temporary acrylic removable denture ("flipper") for aesthetics and space maintenance during the 3-6 month healing period and while awaiting glycemic control.
3.  **Definitive Phase:** Once diabetes is controlled (HbA1c < 7.0%) and tissues are healed, proceed with the definitive prosthesis.

**Cells of Interest:**
The primary cells of interest are those involved in healing and immunity, which are all compromised by uncontrolled diabetes: **Neutrophils and Macrophages** (impaired infection control), **Fibroblasts** (delayed soft tissue healing), **Osteoblasts and Osteoclasts** (impaired bone healing), and **Endothelial Cells** (impaired blood vessel formation). **Periodontal Ligament (PDL) cells** are also of interest, as their non-viability after 28 hours precludes replantation.

**Denture Replacement Details:**
*   **Type of Denture:** Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture (RPD).
*   **Material:** Cobalt-Chromium (Co-Cr) alloy for the framework, with acrylic resin teeth and a pink acrylic base.
*   **Abutment Teeth and Reasons:**
    *   **Left Second Premolar (#13/25):** Primary posterior abutment for support (via a mesio-occlusal rest) and retention (via a clasp).
    *   **Left Central Incisor (#9/21):** Primary anterior abutment for support (via a cingulum rest).
    *   **Right First and/or Second Molars (#2, #3 / 16, 17):** Contralateral abutments for cross-arch stabilization and indirect retention (via occlusal rests), which is critical for the function and stability of the denture.
