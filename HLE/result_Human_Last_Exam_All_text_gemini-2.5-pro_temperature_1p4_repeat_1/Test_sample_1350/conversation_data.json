    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Request**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from William Morris's novel, *The House of the Wolfings*. This character must meet two criteria:\n1.  They visited a Roman city.\n2.  They described Roman religious practices in a way that alludes to the myth of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Setting and Plot of *The House of the Wolfings***\nThe novel is set in a forest in Central Europe and concerns a tribe of Goths, the Wolfings, who are preparing to defend their homeland against an invasion by the Roman Empire. Given this plot, it is logical that the Wolfings would send scouts into Roman territory to gather intelligence. These scouts would be the most likely characters to have visited a Roman city.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Relevant Characters**\nEarly in the book, the tribe awaits the return of two scouts who have been spying on the Romans. These characters are named **Fox** and **Otter**. They are kinsmen of the Wolfing clan who have ventured deep into Roman lands.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the Scouts' Report**\nIn Chapter II, \"The Return of the Wanderers,\" Fox and Otter return to the Wolfing hall. Fox, being the more articulate of the two, gives a long and detailed report of their journey and observations to the assembled tribe. He describes the might of the Roman army, their organization, and the nature of the city they visited.\n\n**Step 5: Locate the Specific Description of Religious Practices**\nDuring his report, Fox describes the Romans' beliefs and the images they hold sacred. He specifically mentions seeing a carving or statue that depicts the founding story of their people. He describes it as an image of a she-wolf suckling two infant boys.\n\n**Careful Point:** Fox does not name the boys Romulus and Remus, as he would not know the specific Roman legend by name. Instead, he describes the image from his own perspective as an outsider, noting that the Romans revere this image of \"their she-wolf, and the sucking children, the founders of their race.\" This description is constructed so that the reader, familiar with Roman mythology, immediately recognizes the reference to Romulus and Remus and the Lupa Capitolina (the Capitoline Wolf).\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the Character's Identity**\nThe character who travels to a Roman city and provides this specific description is the scout, **Fox**. While Otter was with him, it is Fox who delivers the detailed oral report to the tribe.\n\n***\n\n<<<Fox>>>"
