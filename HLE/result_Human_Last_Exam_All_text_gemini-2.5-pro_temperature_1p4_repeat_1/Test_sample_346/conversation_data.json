    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given SKI combinator expression.\n\n**Step 1: Parse the Expression**\n\nThe expression is `E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))))(B)`, where:\n*   `A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n*   `B = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n\nThis expression has the form `S(I)(Y)(Z)` where `Y = S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))` and `Z = B`.\n\n**Step 2: Reduce the Top-Level Expression**\n\nWe use the reduction rules for SKI combinators:\n*   `S x y z = x z (y z)`\n*   `K x y = x`\n*   `I x = x`\n\nLet's reduce `E`:\n`E = S(I)(Y)(B) = I B (Y B) = B (Y B)`\n\nNow, let's reduce `Y B`:\n`Y B = S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))) B`\nThis is of the form `S(I)(Y')(B)` where `Y' = S(I)(K(A))`.\n`Y B = I B (Y' B) = B (Y' B) = B (S(I)(K(A)) B)`\n\nFinally, let's reduce the innermost part `S(I)(K(A)) B`:\n`S(I)(K(A)) B = I B (K A B)`\nUsing `K A B = A`, this becomes `I B (A) = B A`.\n\nSubstituting back:\n*   `Y B = B (B A)`\n*   `E = B (Y B) = B (B (B A))`\n\nSo, the entire expression `E` reduces to `n = B(B(B A))`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Sub-expressions A and B**\n\n`A` and `B` are defined using a common operator. Let `Op = S(S(K(S))(K))`.\n*   `A = Op(I)`\n*   `B = Op(S(I)(I))`\n\nFirst, let's analyze the operator `Op`. It contains the term `S(K(S))(K)`.\n*   Let `X = S(K(S))(K)`.\n*   `X y z w = (K(S) y) (K y) z w = S (K y) z w = (K y w) (z w) = y (z w)`.\n*   This combinator `X` is known as `B'`. `B' y z w = y (z w)`.\n\nNow, `Op = S(B')`.\n*   `Op f g x = S(B') f g x = (B' f) (g f) x = f ((g f) x) = f (g (f x))`.\n*   This is the `Φ` (Phi) combinator: `Φ = λf.λg.λx. f(g(fx))`.\n\nSo, we have `Op = Φ`. Now we can determine `A` and `B`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine A, the Church Numeral for 1**\n\n`A = Op(I) = Φ I`.\n`A = λg.λx. I(g(I x)) = λg.λx. g(x)`.\nThe function `A` takes a function `g` and returns `λx. g(x)`, which is equivalent to `g` itself. Thus, `A g = g`, which means `A` is the identity combinator `I`.\nIn the context of Church numerals, `I = λf.f` is equivalent to the Church numeral 1, `C_1 = λf.λx. f x`, because `I f x = f x = C_1 f x`.\nSo, `A = C_1`.\n\n**Step 5: Determine B and the Transformation T**\n\nThe expression for `n` is `n = B(B(B C_1))`. Let's analyze `B`.\n`B = Op(S(I)(I)) = Φ(S(I)(I))`.\n\nFirst, let's identify `S(I)(I)`.\n`S(I)(I) f x = I f (I f) x = f (f x)`.\nThis is the definition of the Church numeral 2, `C_2`.\nSo, `B = Φ C_2`.\n\nWe have `n = T(T(T(C_1)))` where `T(m) = B m = (Φ C_2) m`. Let's find out what the transformation `T` does to a Church numeral `C_m`.\n\n`T(C_m) = (Φ C_2) C_m = λx. C_2(C_m(C_2 x))`.\n\nThis expression must be interpreted in the context of Church numeral arithmetic. The argument `x` should be interpreted as the function `f` that is applied by the numeral.\nLet's evaluate `T(C_m)` by applying it to `f`:\n`T(C_m) f = C_2(C_m(C_2 f))`.\n\nWe need to use the following properties of Church numerals:\n1.  `C_m h = λx. h^m x`. Applying a numeral `C_m` to a function `h` means composing `h` with itself `m` times.\n2.  `C_m (C_k f) = C_{m*k} f`. This is derived from property 1: `(C_k f)^m x = (f^k)^m x = f^{k*m} x`.\n\nNow we can evaluate `T(C_m) f`:\n1.  Inner part: `C_m(C_2 f)`. Using property 2 with `k=2`, this becomes `C_{m*2} f = C_{2m} f`.\n2.  Outer part: `C_2(C_{2m} f)`. Using property 2 again with `m=2` and `k=2m`, this becomes `C_{2*(2m)} f = C_{4m} f`.\n\nSo, `T(C_m) f = C_{4m} f`. This means the transformation `T` maps the Church numeral `C_m` to `C_{4m}`.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Integer n**\n\nWe need to apply the transformation `T` three times, starting with `C_1`.\n*   Initial value: `C_1` (`m=1`).\n*   First application: `T(C_1) = C_{4*1} = C_4`.\n*   Second application: `T(C_4) = C_{4*4} = C_{16}`.\n*   Third application: `T(C_{16}) = C_{4*16} = C_{64}`.\n\nThe expression evaluates to the Church numeral `C_{64}`, which means the integer `n` is 64.\n\n**Step 7: Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n`n = 64`.\n`log_2(64) = log_2(2^6) = 6`.\n\n<<<6>>>"
