**a) The interaction between molecules can be neglected.**

The absorption cross-section $\sigma_a(\omega)$ is described by a single Gaussian peak centered at the transition frequency of an isolated molecule, $\omega_0$. Its magnitude is the incoherent sum of the contributions from all N molecules.

$\sigma_a(\omega) = \frac{\sqrt{\pi} \tau \omega}{\hbar c \epsilon_0} N |\mu|^2 e^{-(\omega_0-\omega)^2 \tau^2}$

where:
*   $\omega$ is the central frequency of the laser pulse.
*   $\tau$ is a measure of the pulse duration.
*   $N$ is the number of molecules in the chain.
*   $|\mu|^2$ is the squared transition dipole moment for a single molecule.
*   $\hbar\omega_0$ is the transition energy for a single molecule.
*   $\hbar, c, \epsilon_0$ are fundamental physical constants.

**b) The interaction between near-neighbors should be considered.**

The interaction delocalizes the excitations into a band of N Frenkel exciton states. The absorption cross-section $\sigma_b(\omega)$ becomes a sum over the optically allowed ("bright") exciton states.

$\sigma_b(\omega) = \frac{\sqrt{\pi} \tau \omega}{\hbar c \epsilon_0} \sum_{m=1,3,5,...}^N |\vec{d}_{mG}|^2 e^{-(\omega_m}
