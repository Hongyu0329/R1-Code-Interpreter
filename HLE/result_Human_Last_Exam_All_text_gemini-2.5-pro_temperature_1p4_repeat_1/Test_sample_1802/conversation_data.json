    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define a Qudit and Pauli Operators**\n*   A qudit is a quantum system whose state lives in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space, $\\mathcal{H}_A$.\n*   The generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) for a $d$-dimensional system form an orthogonal basis for the space of linear operators on $\\mathcal{H}_A$. There are $d^2$ such operators, which we denote as $\\{U_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha=1}^{d^2}$. A common labeling is $U_{k,l} = X^k Z^l$ for $k,l \\in \\{0, 1, ..., d-1\\}$, where $X$ and $Z$ are the generalized shift and phase operators.\n*   These operators are unitary and satisfy the orthogonality relation $\\text{Tr}(U_\\alpha^\\dagger U_\\beta) = d \\cdot \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}$.\n\n**2. Define a Pauli Channel**\n*   A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel that maps a density matrix $\\rho$ to $\\Lambda(\\rho)$ according to the following rule:\n    $$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{d^2} p_\\alpha U_\\alpha \\rho U_\\alpha^\\dagger $$\n*   Here, $\\{p_\\alpha\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_\\alpha \\ge 0$ for all $\\alpha$ and $\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{d^2} p_\\alpha = 1$.\n*   This form is the Kraus representation of the channel. The Kraus operators are $K_\\alpha = \\sqrt{p_\\alpha} U_\\alpha$.\n\n**3. Define the Complementary Channel**\n*   Any quantum channel can be described by a Stinespring dilation, which involves an isometry $V$ from the input space $\\mathcal{H}_A$ to a combined system-environment space $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$. The channel is recovered by tracing out the environment: $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$.\n*   The Stinespring isometry $V$ is constructed from the Kraus operators:\n    $$ V = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{d^2} K_\\alpha \\otimes |e_\\alpha\\rangle_E = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{d^2} \\sqrt{p_\\alpha} U_\\alpha \\otimes |e_\\alpha\\rangle_E $$\n    where $\\{|e_\\alpha\\rangle_E\\}$ forms an orthonormal basis for the environment Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_E$.\n*   The dimension of the environment, $\\dim(\\mathcal{H}_E)$, is equal to the number of Kraus operators in a minimal representation. This corresponds to the number of non-zero probabilities $p_\\alpha$. The maximum possible dimension for $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is $d^2$.\n*   The complementary channel, denoted $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, maps the input state to a state in the environment. It is obtained by tracing out the system space instead of the environment:\n    $$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_A(V \\rho V^\\dagger) $$\n*   Substituting the expression for $V$:\n    $$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_A \\left[ \\left(\\sum_\\alpha \\sqrt{p_\\alpha} U_\\alpha \\rho \\otimes |e_\\alpha\\rangle \\right) \\left( \\sum_\\beta \\sqrt{p_\\beta} U_\\beta^\\dagger \\otimes \\langle e_\\beta| \\right) \\right] $$\n    $$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta} \\sqrt{p_\\alpha p_\\beta} \\text{Tr}_A(U_\\alpha \\rho U_\\beta^\\dagger) |e_\\alpha\\rangle \\langle e_\\beta| $$\n    The output $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho)$ is a $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrix (at most) representing a state on $\\mathcal{H}_E$.\n\n**4. Determine the Maximal Rank of the Complementary Channel**\n*   The rank of a channel is defined as the maximum possible rank of an output state over all possible input states $\\rho$.\n    $$ \\text{Rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\max_{\\rho} \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho)) $$\n*   The question asks for the maximal rank, which means we can also choose the Pauli channel (i.e., the probabilities $p_\\alpha$) that gives the largest possible rank. So we want to find:\n    $$ \\max_{\\Lambda \\in \\text{Pauli}} \\left( \\max_{\\rho} \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho)) \\right) $$\n*   The rank of the output state $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho)$ cannot exceed the dimension of the space it lives in, which is $\\dim(\\mathcal{H}_E)$.\n    $$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho)) \\le \\dim(\\mathcal{H}_E) = (\\text{number of non-zero } p_\\alpha) \\le d^2 $$\n*   Therefore, the maximal possible rank is at most $d^2$. To see if this rank can be achieved, we must find a specific Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ and a specific input state $\\rho$ for which the rank of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho)$ is exactly $d^2$.\n\n**5. Construct an Example to Achieve the Maximum Rank**\n*   **Choosing the Channel:** To maximize the dimension of the environment, we should choose a channel where all $d^2$ probabilities $p_\\alpha$ are non-zero. The canonical example is the **completely depolarizing channel**, where each Pauli error occurs with equal probability:\n    $$ p_\\alpha = \\frac{1}{d^2} \\quad \\text{for all } \\alpha = 1, ..., d^2 $$\n*   **Choosing the Input State:** Let's test the maximally mixed input state, $\\rho = \\frac{I_A}{d}$, where $I_A$ is the identity operator on $\\mathcal{H}_A$.\n*   **Calculating the Output State:** Let's compute $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(I_A/d)$ for this channel and state. The matrix elements of the output state are:\n    $$ [\\tilde{\\Lambda}(I_A/d)]_{\\alpha, \\beta} = \\sqrt{p_\\alpha p_\\beta} \\text{Tr}(U_\\alpha (I_A/d) U_\\beta^\\dagger) $$\n    Substituting $p_\\alpha = p_\\beta = 1/d^2$ and $\\rho = I_A/d$:\n    $$ [\\tilde{\\Lambda}(I_A/d)]_{\\alpha, \\beta} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{d^2} \\frac{1}{d^2}} \\text{Tr}\\left(U_\\alpha \\frac{I_A}{d} U_\\beta^\\dagger\\right) = \\frac{1}{d^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{d} \\text{Tr}(U_\\alpha U_\\beta^\\dagger) $$\n    Using the orthogonality property $\\text{Tr}(U_\\alpha U_\\beta^\\dagger) = d \\cdot \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}$:\n    $$ [\\tilde{\\Lambda}(I_A/d)]_{\\alpha, \\beta} = \\frac{1}{d^3} (d \\cdot \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}) = \\frac{1}{d^2} \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta} $$\n*   The resulting output matrix is:\n    $$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(I_A/d) = \\frac{1}{d^2} \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{d^2} |e_\\alpha\\rangle\\langle e_\\alpha| = \\frac{I_E}{d^2} $$\n    where $I_E$ is the identity matrix on the $d^2$-dimensional environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$.\n*   The rank of this matrix is the rank of the $d^2 \\times d^2$ identity matrix, which is $d^2$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that:\n1.  The rank of the output of a complementary Pauli channel is bounded above by $d^2$.\n2.  We found a specific Pauli channel (the completely depolarizing channel) and a specific input state (the maximally mixed state) for which this bound is achieved.\n\nTherefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
