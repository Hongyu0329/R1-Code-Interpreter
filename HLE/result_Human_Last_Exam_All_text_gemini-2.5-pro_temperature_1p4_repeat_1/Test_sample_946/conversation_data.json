    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe question asks for a specific piece of information from a particular piece of media.\n*   **Media:** The online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n*   **Specific Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n*   **Event within the episode:** The Junior prom.\n*   **Object in question:** A cardboard cutout.\n*   **Identity of the object:** A fictional singer.\n*   **Action of the object:** \"Performs\" at the prom.\n\n**Step 2: Recall or research the specific scene in \"Teen Girl Squad #15\"**\nThe episode focuses on the main characters getting ready for and attending their Junior prom. A key plot point is who will be the musical entertainment.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the dialogue and visuals related to the prom's musical guest**\n*   Cheerleader announces, \"i got the musical guest!\"\n*   So and So asks if it's a \"lame-o 'in real life' band\".\n*   Cheerleader reveals, \"nope! even better! a cardboard cutout of... TARANCHULA!!\"\n*   The scene then cuts to a stage where a cardboard cutout of the band Taranchula is displayed. The cutout has a speech bubble that says \"ROCK!\".\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The question specifies a \"fictional singer\". Taranchula is a fictional hair metal band within the Homestar Runner universe, so this fits the criteria.\n*   The question correctly identifies the performer as a \"cardboard cutout\", which is precisely what is shown in the episode.\n*   The spelling is important. The band's name is \"Taranchula\", a deliberate misspelling of \"tarantula\".\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the findings to form the answer**\nBased on the direct evidence from the cartoon, the cardboard cutout that performs at the Junior prom is of the fictional band/singer Taranchula.\n\n<<<Taranchula>>>"
