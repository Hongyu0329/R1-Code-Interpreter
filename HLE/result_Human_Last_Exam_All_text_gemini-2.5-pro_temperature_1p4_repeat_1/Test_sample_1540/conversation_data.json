    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Objective:** The primary goal is to compare two strings lexicographically.\n2.  **Input:** Two lines of input, each containing a string.\n3.  **String Properties:**\n    *   The two strings are guaranteed to have the same length.\n    *   The length of each string is between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive.\n    *   The strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n4.  **Comparison Rule:** The comparison must be case-insensitive. This means an uppercase letter is treated as identical to its corresponding lowercase letter (e.g., 'A' is equivalent to 'a').\n5.  **Output:**\n    *   Print \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically less than the second string.\n    *   Print \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically greater than the second string.\n    *   Print \"0\" if the two strings are equal (after case conversion).\n6.  **Constraint:** The solution must be the \"most memory-efficient C program\". This means we must minimize the total memory used by the variables in our program.\n7.  **Task:** The final output should be the total memory `m` in bytes used for the variables in this most efficient program.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Case-Insensitive Comparison:** The most important rule. Before comparing any two characters, they must be converted to a common case (either both to lowercase or both to uppercase). The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is ideal for this.\n2.  **Lexicographical Comparison:** Comparison proceeds character by character from left to right (from index 0). The comparison result is determined by the very first pair of characters that differ.\n3.  **Memory Efficiency:** The crucial constraint is minimizing memory. A standard approach would be to read both strings into two separate character arrays (buffers).\n    *   e.g., `char s1[101], s2[101];`\n    *   This would use `101 + 101 = 202` bytes just for the buffers.\n    To be \"most memory-efficient\", we must consider if we can avoid using two full buffers.\n4.  **Input Processing:** Standard input streams are sequential. To read the second string, we must first have processed the first string from the input. This means we cannot compare characters at the same index in an interleaved fashion without storing at least one of the strings. Therefore, buffering at least one string is unavoidable.\n5.  **Single-Buffer Strategy:** The most memory-efficient approach is to read the first string into a buffer. Then, read the second string one character at a time and compare it with the corresponding character from the buffered first string. This eliminates the need for a second buffer, saving significant memory.\n6.  **Variable Sizing:** To further minimize memory, we should choose the smallest possible data type for each variable that can safely hold the required range of values. For example, an index that only goes up to 100 can be stored in a `char` instead of an `int`.\n7.  **Function `getchar()`:** When reading character by character, the `getchar()` function is suitable. It's important to know that `getchar()` returns an `int` type, not a `char`. This is to accommodate the special `EOF` (End-Of-File) value, which is typically a negative integer and may not fit in a `char` type.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation of the Final Answer\n\nWe will design the most memory-efficient C program and then calculate the memory used by its variables.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Declare a character array (buffer) large enough to hold the first string (max 100 chars + 1 for the null terminator).\n2.  Read the first string from standard input into this buffer.\n3.  The first string is followed by a newline character (`\\n`). We must consume this character to begin reading the second string from the next line.\n4.  Read the second string one character at a time using `getchar()` in a loop.\n5.  Inside the loop, for each character read from the second string, compare it case-insensitively with the character at the corresponding position in the buffered first string.\n6.  If a difference is found, print the result (-1 or 1) and terminate the program.\n7.  If the loop finishes without finding any difference, it means the strings are equal. Print 0.\n\n**C Code Sketch for Memory Analysis:**\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // 1. Buffer for the first string.\n    char s1[101];\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // 2. Consume the newline character.\n    getchar();\n\n    // 3. Variables for the loop.\n    char i = 0;   // Index for s1. Max value is 100, so 'char' is sufficient.\n    int c2;       // Variable to hold the return value of getchar(). Must be 'int'.\n\n    while ((c2 = getchar()) != '\\n' && c2 != EOF) {\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(c2)) {\n            // ... print -1 and exit\n        }\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(c2)) {\n            // ... print 1 and exit\n        }\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // ... print 0 and exit\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**Memory Calculation (m):**\nWe now calculate the total memory allocated for the variables in the program sketch above. We assume a standard C environment where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes.\n\n1.  `char s1[101];`\n    *   This is an array of 101 characters. `sizeof(char)` is guaranteed to be 1 byte.\n    *   Memory: `101 * 1 byte = 101 bytes`.\n\n2.  `char i = 0;`\n    *   This variable is used as an index, with a maximum value of 100. A `char` type (1 byte) can safely store this range (0-255 if unsigned, -128 to 127 if signed).\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(char) = 1 byte`.\n\n3.  `int c2;`\n    *   This variable holds the return value of `getchar()`, which must be an `int` to handle the `EOF` value correctly.\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(int) = 4 bytes` (a standard assumption on competitive programming platforms).\n\n**Total Memory (m):**\nSumming the memory usage of all variables:\n`m = sizeof(s1) + sizeof(i) + sizeof(c2)`\n`m = 101 bytes + 1 byte + 4 bytes`\n`m = 106 bytes`\n\nThis single-buffer approach is significantly more memory-efficient than a two-buffer solution, which would use `101 (s1) + 101 (s2) + 1 (i) = 203` bytes or more. Therefore, 106 bytes is the memory usage of the most memory-efficient solution.\n\n<<<106>>>"
