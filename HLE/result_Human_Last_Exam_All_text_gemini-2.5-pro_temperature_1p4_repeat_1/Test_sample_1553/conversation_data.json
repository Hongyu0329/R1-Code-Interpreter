    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core components of the question.**\nThe question asks for the name of a specific character from a specific novel.\n*   **Novel:** \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection)\n*   **Author:** Jacek Dukaj\n*   **Task:** Identify the character whom the main character marries.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main character of the novel.**\nThe protagonist and main character of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski, a human from the 21st century who is resurrected in the distant future.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the plot to find the main character's romantic relationships and marriage.**\n*   Adam Zamoyski's primary guide, protector, and later partner in this far-future reality is a powerful post-human entity known as a \"stahs\" (Standard Human).\n*   Her name is Angelina.\n*   The relationship between Adam and Angelina is central to the entire narrative. It evolves from one of a dependent and his guardian to a deep, complex, and intimate bond.\n*   The concept of \"marriage\" in the novel's universe is not a traditional human ceremony. Instead, it is a profound, almost metaphysical merging of consciousness and existence.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the outcome of the relationship between the main character and his partner.**\n*   Towards the conclusion of the novel, Adam Zamoyski and Angelina undergo a process of merging. Their existences become inextricably linked, culminating in a unique union where they essentially become a single, more powerful entity.\n*   This transformative union is the novel's equivalent of a marriage, representing the ultimate partnership in this post-human context.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude with the name of the character.**\nBased on the analysis, the character that the main character, Adam Zamoyski, \"marries\" (or merges with in a form of ultimate union) is Angelina.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **The definition of \"marriage\":** It is crucial to understand that the term \"marry\" in the context of this science fiction novel is not a traditional ceremony but a far more abstract and profound concept of merging two beings.\n*   **Character Identification:** Correctly identifying the protagonist as Adam Zamoyski is the first critical step.\n*   **Central Relationship:** Recognizing that the core relationship in the book is between Adam and Angelina is key to finding the answer.\n\nFinal Answer: The main character, Adam Zamoyski, marries (or more accurately, merges with) the character Angelina.\n\n<<<Angelina>>>"
