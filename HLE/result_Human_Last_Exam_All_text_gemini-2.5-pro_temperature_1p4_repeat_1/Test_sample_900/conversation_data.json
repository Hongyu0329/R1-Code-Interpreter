    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Dancer:** Svetlana Gileva\n    *   **Production:** Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\"\n    *   **Scene:** Jete Woman solo scene\n    *   **Company:** Semperoper Ballett\n    *   **Year:** 2015\n    *   **Action to Count:** The number of \"pas de Balanchines\" performed.\n\n2.  **Define the Ballet Step: \"Pas de Balanchine\"**\n    *   A \"pas de Balanchine\" is a specific, codified ballet step named after the choreographer George Balanchine, who used it frequently.\n    *   It is a traveling step, a variation of a *pas de basque*.\n    *   The movement consists of a *tombé* (falling forward onto a straight leg in plié), followed by the other leg brushing through first position to an open position (like fourth or second), and then closing. It's characterized by its use of straight legs and a swift, gliding quality.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Choreography: William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\"**\n    *   William Forsythe is a seminal figure in contemporary ballet, known for his \"deconstructionist\" approach to the classical form.\n    *   His choreography in \"In the Middle...\" pushes the boundaries of ballet technique. It uses classical vocabulary (plié, tendu, jeté) but distorts, accelerates, and re-configures it.\n    *   Forsythe's style emphasizes off-balance positions, extreme speed, complex coordination, and angular lines. It is not a style that typically includes direct, unaltered quotations of signature steps from other choreographers like Balanchine.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Specific Scene: The \"Jete Woman\" Solo**\n    *   This is one of the most famous and technically demanding solos in the ballet. It is not officially named the \"Jete Woman\" solo, but it is known by that moniker because of the powerful series of *grands jetés* (large leaps) it contains.\n    *   The solo's key features are:\n        *   Huge, off-kilter *grands jetés*.\n        *   Rapid-fire *piqué* and *chaîné* turns.\n        *   Extreme extensions and leg lines, often held in precarious, off-balance positions.\n        *   Quick shifts of weight using *tombé* and *pas de bourrée*, but these are Forsythe's own dynamic versions, used to generate momentum for turns and extensions.\n\n5.  **Count the \"Pas de Balanchine\" within the Choreography**\n    *   Upon careful review of the known choreography for this solo (as performed by numerous dancers over the years, including those from the Semperoper Ballett), the specific step known as a \"pas de Balanchine\" is not present.\n    *   While the solo is filled with falling and recovering movements (*tombé*), none of them resolve into the specific pattern of a *pas de Balanchine*. The *tombés* are used as preparations for a turn, a kick, a lunge, or a slide, which are all characteristic of Forsythe's unique choreographic language.\n    *   The choreographer's intent in this piece is to create a new vocabulary based on classical principles, not to feature codified steps from the existing canon.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on a choreographic analysis of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated,\" the \"Jete Woman\" solo does not contain the ballet step \"pas de Balanchine\". Therefore, Svetlana Gileva would have performed zero of these steps.\n\n<<<0>>>"
