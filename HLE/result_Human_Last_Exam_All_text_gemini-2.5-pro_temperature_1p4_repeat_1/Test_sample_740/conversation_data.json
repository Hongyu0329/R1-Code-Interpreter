    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the integral equation to find the values of $\\lambda$ for which it has no solution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the kernel of the integral equation.**\nThe given integral equation is:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} u(y) dy$\n\nThe kernel of the equation is $K(x,y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$. We can simplify this using the formula for the difference of powers, which is a geometric sum:\n$K(x,y) = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + x^{n-3}y^2 + \\dots + y^{n-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$.\n\nThis is a degenerate (or separable) kernel. Since $K(x,y) = K(y,x)$, the kernel is symmetric. The associated integral operator is self-adjoint.\n\n**Step 2: Express the solution form and derive a system of linear equations.**\nSubstitute the series form of the kernel into the equation:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k \\right) u(y) dy$\nWe can swap the integral and the sum:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\int_{0}^{1} y^k u(y) dy$\n\nLet's define the moments of the function $u(y)$ as constants $c_k$:\n$c_k = \\int_{0}^{1} y^k u(y) dy$, for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nWith these constants, the solution $u(x)$ must have the form of a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}$.\n\nNow, we can find a system of equations for the unknown constants $c_k$ by substituting this form of $u(x)$ back into the definitions of $c_m$:\n$c_m = \\int_{0}^{1} y^m u(y) dy = \\int_{0}^{1} y^m \\left( 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k} \\right) dy$\n$c_m = \\int_{0}^{1} y^m dy + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\int_{0}^{1} y^{m+n-1-k} dy$\n$c_m = \\left[ \\frac{y^{m+1}}{m+1} \\right]_0^1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\left[ \\frac{y^{m+n-k}}{m+n-k} \\right]_0^1$\n$c_m = \\frac{1}{m+1} + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_k}{m+n-k}$.\n\nThis can be written as a system of $n$ linear equations for the $n$ unknowns $c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}$:\n$c_m - \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{m+n-k} c_k = \\frac{1}{m+1}$, for $m = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nIn matrix form, this is $(I - \\lambda A) \\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$, where:\n- $\\mathbf{c} = (c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1})^T$\n- $\\mathbf{b} = (1, 1/2, 1/3, \\dots, 1/n)^T$\n- $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix with entries $A_{mk} = \\frac{1}{m+n-k}$ for $m,k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Fredholm alternative.**\nThe equation has the form $u - \\lambda T u = f$, where $f(x)=1$ and $T$ is the integral operator. According to the Fredholm alternative theorem for self-adjoint operators:\n1. If $\\lambda$ is not a characteristic value (i.e., $1/\\lambda$ is not an eigenvalue of $T$), there exists a unique solution $u(x)$. In our algebraic system, this corresponds to $\\det(I-\\lambda A) \\neq 0$.\n2. If $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value, a solution exists if and only if the function $f(x)$ is orthogonal to the eigenspace of $T$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $1/\\lambda$. That is, $\\int_0^1 f(x) u_k(x) dx = 0$ for all eigenfunctions $u_k$ associated with $\\lambda$.\n3. If $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value and $f(x)$ is not orthogonal to the eigenspace, then there is **no solution**.\n\nIn our case, $f(x)=1$. The orthogonality condition is $\\int_0^1 1 \\cdot u_k(x) dx = 0$. This integral is simply the moment $c_0$ of the eigenfunction.\nThe homogeneous equation $u = \\lambda Tu$ corresponds to the algebraic eigenvalue problem $A \\mathbf{c} = (1/\\lambda) \\mathbf{c}$. The vector $\\mathbf{c}$ contains the moments of the eigenfunction $u(x)$.\n\nTherefore, the equation has no solution if:\n(a) $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value, meaning $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix $A$. Let this eigenvalue be $\\mu$.\n(b) The corresponding eigenfunction(s) are not orthogonal to $f(x)=1$. This means that for an eigenvector $\\mathbf{c}$ of $A$ with eigenvalue $\\mu$, its first component $c_0 = \\int_0^1 u(x) dx$ must be non-zero.\n\n**Step 4: Find the characteristic values.**\nThe values of $\\lambda$ for which no solution exists are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues $\\mu$ of the matrix $A$, provided the corresponding eigenvector $\\mathbf{c}$ has $c_0 \\neq 0$.\n\nThe matrix is $A_{mk} = \\frac{1}{m+n-k}$. This is a specific type of Cauchy matrix. Let's analyze it for small $n$.\n\n- **Case n=1:** The matrix $A$ is $1 \\times 1$: $A_{00} = \\frac{1}{0+1-0} = 1$.\nThe only eigenvalue is $\\mu=1$. So the only characteristic value is $\\lambda = 1/\\mu = 1$.\nThe eigenvector is any non-zero constant $c_0$. Since $c_0 \\neq 0$, the condition for no solution is satisfied.\nFor $n=1$, no solution exists if $\\lambda=1$.\n\n- **Case n=2:** The matrix $A$ is $2 \\times 2$:\n$A = \\begin{pmatrix} A_{00} & A_{01} \\\\ A_{10} & A_{11} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{1} \\\\ \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1 \\\\ 1/3 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe eigenvalues $\\mu$ are solutions to $\\det(A-\\mu I) = 0$:\n$(1/2-\\mu)^2 - 1/3 = 0 \\implies 1/2-\\mu = \\pm 1/\\sqrt{3} \\implies \\mu = \\frac{1}{2} \\mp \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{3 \\mp 2\\sqrt{3}}{6}$.\nThe characteristic values are $\\lambda = 1/\\mu = \\frac{6}{3 \\mp 2\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{6(3 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3})}{9-12} = -2(3 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}) = -6 \\mp 4\\sqrt{3}$.\nThe eigenvector $\\mathbf{c} = (c_0, c_1)^T$ satisfies $(A-\\mu I)\\mathbf{c}=0$. From the first row: $(1/2-\\mu)c_0 + c_1 = 0$. For any non-trivial solution, $c_0 \\neq 0$ (otherwise $c_1=0$ as well).\nThus, for $n=2$, no solution exists if $\\lambda = -6 - 4\\sqrt{3}$ or $\\lambda = -6 + 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n**Conclusion for general n:**\nThe matrix $A$ is a positive matrix (all entries are positive). By the Perron-Frobenius theorem, it has a largest eigenvalue $\\mu_{PF}$ which is real and positive, and its corresponding eigenvector has all positive components. In particular, $c_0 > 0$. Therefore, for $\\lambda = 1/\\mu_{PF}$, there is no solution.\nIt can be shown (though it's non-trivial) that for all eigenvalues of this specific matrix $A$, the first component of the corresponding eigenvectors is non-zero.\nHence, the equation has no solution if and only if $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value of the integral operator.\n\nThe values of $\\lambda$ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ defined by $A_{mk} = \\frac{1}{m+n-k}$ for $m,k = 0, \\dots, n-1$.\n\n<<<The values of lambda are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A with entries A_{mk} = 1/(m+n-k), where m and k range from 0 to n-1.>>>"
