    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Goal:** Construct a \"full spectral volume\". This is a 3D data set, often called a hyperspectral cube, with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (λ, wavelength). For each pixel in a 2D scene, we want to know its full light spectrum.\n    *   **Method:** Use \"Computed Tomography\" (CT). Standard CT reconstructs a 3D object from its 2D projections taken at various angles. In this application, known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS), the \"3D object\" is the spatiospectral data cube (x, y, λ).\n    *   **Constraint:** The reconstruction must come from a \"single image\". This means all the necessary projection data must be captured simultaneously on one 2D sensor (like a CCD or CMOS chip) in a single snapshot.\n    *   **Tool:** Use \"diffraction gratings\" to generate the required data.\n\n2.  **Understand the Role of the Diffraction Grating:**\n    *   A diffraction grating is an optical component that splits light into its constituent wavelengths. When light from an image passes through a grating, it produces multiple copies of that image on the sensor.\n    *   One copy is the **0th-order diffraction**, which is undispersed. It's essentially a normal black-and-white or color image of the scene, where all wavelengths are superimposed. This serves as one projection of the (x, y, λ) cube onto the (x, y) plane.\n    *   Other copies are the **higher-order diffractions** (+1, -1, +2, -2, etc.). In these orders, the light is dispersed, meaning the position of a point in the image is shifted by an amount that depends on its wavelength. A point of red light is shifted more than a point of blue light. These dispersed images are the other \"projections\" needed for tomography.\n\n3.  **Relate to Computed Tomography Principles:**\n    *   The fundamental principle of CT is that you need projections from multiple different angles to reconstruct a 3D volume accurately. If you only have projections from one angle (or along one axis), the reconstruction problem is ill-posed and cannot be solved uniquely. You would get severe streaking artifacts.\n    *   In CTIS, the different diffraction orders serve as the projections from different \"angles\" of the (x, y, λ) data cube.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Minimum Number of Gratings:**\n\n    *   **Case 1: One Diffraction Grating.** A standard diffraction grating is a 1D structure (like a series of parallel lines). It disperses light along a single axis, perpendicular to the lines of the grating.\n        *   This will produce a 0th-order image and a series of dispersed images (+1, -1, etc.) along a single line on the sensor.\n        *   While this gives multiple projections, they are all \"views\" of the data cube from the same general direction. You are only getting information about spectral dispersion along one spatial axis. This is not enough information to unambiguously reconstruct the full 3D data cube, akin to trying to do a medical CT scan by only taking X-rays from the front and back but not from the sides. Therefore, **1 grating is insufficient.**\n\n    *   **Case 2: Two Diffraction Gratings.** To solve the problem of needing views from different angles, we need to disperse the light in more than one direction. The simplest way to achieve this is to use two 1D gratings placed one after another, with their grating lines oriented perpendicularly (e.g., one horizontal, one vertical). This combination is often referred to as a \"crossed grating\" or a single \"2D grating\".\n        *   This setup disperses light in a 2D pattern. It creates a grid of diffraction orders on the sensor (e.g., a central 0th order, orders dispersed purely horizontally, orders dispersed purely vertically, and orders dispersed diagonally).\n        *   These orders represent projections of the spatiospectral cube from multiple, non-collinear angles.\n        *   This set of projections provides sufficient information for a stable tomographic reconstruction of the (x, y, λ) data cube. Therefore, **2 gratings are sufficient.**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since one grating is insufficient and two (oriented perpendicularly) are sufficient to provide the minimum required data for tomographic reconstruction, the minimum number of gratings necessary is 2.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Definition of \"Grating\":** The question refers to the number of gratings. A 2D grating (a single physical component) functions as two perpendicular 1D gratings. The key concept is that you need diffraction in two orthogonal directions. This requires the optical effect of two gratings.\n*   **\"Minimum\" Requirement:** The question asks for the *minimum* number. While using more gratings or more complex gratings (like a Computer-Generated Hologram) could provide more projections and improve reconstruction quality, two is the minimum required to make the tomographic problem well-posed.\n*   **Single Image Constraint:** The entire system is designed to project this 2D grid of spectrally dispersed images onto a single sensor plane in a single exposure, fulfilling the \"single image\" constraint.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  A single 1D grating provides projections along only one axis. This is insufficient for tomographic reconstruction.\n2.  Two 1D gratings, oriented perpendicularly, provide projections along two independent axes (as well as diagonal axes). This set of non-collinear projections is sufficient for tomographic reconstruction.\n3.  Therefore, the minimum number of gratings required is 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
