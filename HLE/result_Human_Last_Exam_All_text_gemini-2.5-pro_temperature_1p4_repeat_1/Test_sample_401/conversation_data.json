    "Answering this question requires a careful understanding of several concepts from point-set topology, specifically continuum theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core definitions.**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a compact, connected Hausdorff space. The question explicitly states \"not necessarily metric,\" which is a crucial detail. If it were restricted to metric spaces, the answer would be different.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subcontinuum of a continuum $X$ is a subset of $X$ that is also a continuum with the subspace topology. A *proper* subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not equal to $X$.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is called indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. That is, if $X = A \\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are subcontinua, then either $A=X$ or $B=X$.\n*   **Composant:** For a point $x$ in a continuum $X$, the composant of $x$, denoted $C(x)$, is the set of all points $y \\in X$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $x$ and $y$. Equivalently, $C(x)$ is the union of all proper subcontinua of $X$ that contain the point $x$. The distinct sets $C(x)$ for various $x \\in X$ are the composants of $X$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate decomposability to the number of composants.**\n\nThere is a fundamental theorem that connects the decomposability of a continuum to its composants:\n*   A continuum $X$ is **decomposable** if and only if it has a composant that is equal to the entire space, $X$. In this case, $X$ has only **one** composant, which is $X$ itself.\n*   Conversely, for an **indecomposable** continuum, no composant can be equal to the entire space. This implies that an indecomposable continuum must have **more than one** composant.\n\nThis gives us a lower bound: the smallest possible number of composants is at least 2.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the properties of composants in an indecomposable continuum.**\n\nFor any indecomposable continuum $X$, the set of its composants has the following properties:\n*   They form a partition of $X$. That is, they are pairwise disjoint and their union is $X$.\n*   Each composant is a dense subset of $X$.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the metric case first (for contrast).**\n\nIf we restrict ourselves to *metric* continua (compact, connected metric spaces), there is a famous result by Stefan Mazurkiewicz which states:\n*   Every indecomposable metric continuum has exactly $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\nClassic examples like the pseudo-arc or the Knaster continuum (bucket-handle) fall into this category, and both have $c$ composants. If the problem hadn't included the \"not necessarily metric\" clause, the answer would be $c$.\n\n**Step 5: Consider the \"not necessarily metric\" case.**\n\nThe \"not necessarily metric\" clause is key. It means we must consider continua that are compact, connected, and Hausdorff but do not have a compatible metric. The topological properties of such spaces can be very different. The proof that metric indecomposable continua have $c$ composants relies on properties specific to metric spaces (like being a Baire space and having a countable base, which implies separability). Specifically, in the metric case, every composant is a set of the first category (a countable union of nowhere-dense sets). By the Baire Category Theorem, the continuum cannot be a countable union of its composants, forcing the number of composants to be uncountable (and more specifically, $c$).\n\nWhen we remove the metric condition, these arguments may no longer hold. The question then becomes: can we construct a non-metrizable indecomposable continuum with a finite number of composants?\n\n**Step 6: Refer to known results in continuum theory.**\n\nThe construction of such continua is non-trivial, but their existence is a known result in topology.\n*   A landmark paper by Howard Cook (\"Continua with a finite number of composants\", 1970) proved that for **any integer** $n \\ge 2$, there exists an indecomposable (and necessarily non-metrizable) continuum that has exactly $n$ composants.\n*   Cook also constructed an example with a countably infinite number of composants.\n\n**Step 7: Conclude the final answer.**\n\n1.  From Step 2, an indecomposable continuum must have more than 1 composant. So, the smallest possible number is $\\ge 2$.\n2.  From Step 6, we know that for any integer $n \\ge 2$, it is possible to construct an indecomposable continuum with $n$ composants. This means an example with exactly 2 composants exists.\n3.  Combining these two points, the minimum possible number of composants for an indecomposable continuum is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
