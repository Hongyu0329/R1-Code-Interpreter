The ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio depends on the specific application:
*   **For Water Gas Shift (WGS):** A ratio in the range of **0.2 to 0.5** is generally found to be optimal, as it balances the number of active Ni sites with the maximization of the synergistic Ni-Ceria interface.
*   **For Thermochemical Water Splitting:** A lower ratio in the range of **0.05 to 0.2** is typically ideal, as the goal is to dope the ceria lattice to enhance its redox properties without causing phase separation.
*   **For Electrocatalytic Water Splitting:** A significantly higher ratio is often required to maximize the density of active sites. Optimal performance is frequently observed with ratios in the range of **0.5 to 1.0** or even higher, depending on the synthesis method.
