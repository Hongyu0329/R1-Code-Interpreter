    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks for the specific number of a particular ballet step (single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position) performed by a specific dancer (Natalia Osipova) in a specific performance (the Act I variation of the 2008 Bolshoi Ballet's *Don Quixote*).\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Performance Details:**\n    *   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n    *   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n    *   **Year:** 2008\n    *   **Ballet & Act:** *Don Quixote*, Act I\n    *   **Variation:** Kitri's solo variation, often called the \"fan variation\".\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the Ballet Step:**\n    *   **Step:** Pirouette. This is a turn on one leg.\n    *   **Number of rotations:** Single-turn.\n    *   **Direction:** En dehors (outward, away from the supporting leg).\n    *   **Preparation/Starting Position:** From the fifth position (a standard classical ballet position where the feet are turned out and pressed together, heel-to-toe and toe-to-heel).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Choreography of the Variation:**\n    *   Kitri's Act I variation is one of the most famous solos in the classical ballet repertoire. Its choreography is largely standardized, originally by Marius Petipa and later revised by Alexander Gorsky.\n    *   The variation is known for its high energy, sharp movements, and technical virtuosity. Key components include jumps (like grand jetés), sharp balances on pointe (such as in an attitude position), and a famous turning sequence.\n    *   The most prominent turning sequence in this variation is a circle of **piqué turns en tournant**.\n\n5.  **Distinguish Between the Requested Step and the Performed Step (Careful Point):**\n    *   The question specifically asks for a **pirouette from the fifth position**. This step involves a preparation where the dancer bends both knees in a plié from a closed fifth position, then pushes off the floor to relevé onto one leg to execute the turn. This type of pirouette is typically done in place or with minimal travel.\n    *   The turning step that Natalia Osipova (and all dancers performing this traditional choreography) performs in this variation is a **piqué turn**. A piqué turn is a traveling turn. The dancer steps directly onto a straight supporting leg on pointe or demi-pointe, and the other leg is brought up to a retiré position as the turn is executed. It does *not* start from a two-footed plié in the fifth position.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Upon reviewing videos of Natalia Osipova's 2008 performance and analyzing the standard choreography for Kitri's Act I variation, it becomes clear that the signature turning sequence is made up of piqué turns, not pirouettes from the fifth position.\n    *   The choreography for this specific solo does not include any single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position. Therefore, the number of times this specific step is performed is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
