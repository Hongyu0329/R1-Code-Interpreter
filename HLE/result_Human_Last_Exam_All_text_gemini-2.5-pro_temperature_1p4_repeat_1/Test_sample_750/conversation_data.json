    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ for all $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Equation**: The equation involves a standard multiplication on the left-hand side (LHS) and a complex exponentiation on the right-hand side (RHS). The main challenge lies in correctly handling the complex exponentiation $i^z$.\n\n2.  **Handling Complex Exponentiation**: For any complex numbers $a$ and $b$ (with $a \\neq 0$), $a^b$ is defined as $a^b = e^{b \\log(a)}$. Here, $a=i$ and $b=z$. So, $i^z = e^{z \\log(i)}$.\n\n3.  **The Multi-valued Complex Logarithm**: The complex logarithm, $\\log(w)$, is a multi-valued function defined as $\\log(w) = \\ln|w| + i(\\arg(w) + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   For $w = i$, we have $|i| = 1$ and the principal argument $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\log(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\n    *   To capture all possible values of $i^z$, we must include the integer parameter $k$.\n\n4.  **Rewriting the Equation**: Substituting the expression for $i^z$ into the original equation:\n    $z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot \\log(i)}$\n    $z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n5.  **Simplifying with a Substitution**: Let's simplify the equation to a more standard form.\n    *   Let $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2}$. The equation becomes $z \\cdot i = e^{zi \\cdot C_k}$.\n    *   Let $w = z \\cdot i$. The equation transforms into $w = e^{w C_k}$.\n\n6.  **Introducing the Lambert W Function**: An equation of the form $w = e^{cw}$ can be solved using the Lambert W function. The Lambert W function, denoted as $W(x)$, is defined as the solution to the equation $W(x)e^{W(x)} = x$. To use it, we must rearrange our equation into the form $B e^B = A$.\n    *   Starting with $w = e^{w C_k}$, we can write $w e^{-w C_k} = 1$.\n    *   To make the term outside the exponential match the exponent, we multiply by $-C_k$:\n        $(-w C_k) e^{-w C_k} = -C_k$.\n    *   This equation is in the form $B e^B = A$, where $B = -w C_k$ and $A = -C_k$.\n\n7.  **Solving for w**: The solution for $B$ is given by $B = W(A)$. Therefore, $-w C_k = W(-C_k)$.\n    *   The Lambert W function is also multi-valued. The different solutions are represented by branches, $W_n$, where $n$ is any integer. So, to find all solutions, we must write:\n        $-w C_k = W_n(-C_k)$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   Solving for $w$, we get:\n        $w = -\\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$.\n\n8.  **Solving for z**: Finally, we substitute back $w = z \\cdot i$ to find $z$.\n    *   $z \\cdot i = -\\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$\n    *   $z = \\frac{1}{i} \\left( -\\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k} \\right) = -i \\left( -\\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k} \\right) = i \\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$.\n\n9.  **Final Expression**: Substituting the expression for $C_k$ back gives the complete set of solutions for $z$:\n    $z = i \\frac{W_n\\left(-\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)\\right)}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi} = i \\frac{W_n\\left(-\\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2}\\right)}{\\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2}}$ for all integers $k, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Multi-valuedness of $i^z$**: It is crucial to use the general form of the complex logarithm, $\\log(i) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$, to account for all possible interpretations of $i^z$. The integer $k$ generates distinct families of solutions.\n2.  **Multi-valuedness of Lambert W**: The equation $w=e^{cw}$ has infinitely many solutions in the complex plane. These are given by the different branches of the Lambert W function, indexed by the integer $n$.\n3.  **Nature of Solutions**: The argument of the W function is $x_k = -\\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2}$.\n    *   If $k \\leq -1$, $x_k$ is a positive real number. For the principal branch ($n=0$), $W_0(x_k)$ is a real number, which leads to a purely imaginary solution for $z$. All other branches ($n \\neq 0$) give complex values for $W_n(x_k)$.\n    *   If $k \\geq 0$, $x_k$ is a negative real number with $x_k < -1/e$. In this case, all branches $W_n(x_k)$ give complex values, so there are no purely imaginary solutions for these families.\n\nThe final answer encompasses all these possibilities by using the two integer parameters $k$ and $n$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe set of all solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is given by:\n$z = i \\frac{W_n\\left(-\\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2}\\right)}{\\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2}}$\nwhere $k$ and $n$ are any integers ($k, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$), and $W_n$ denotes the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function.\n\n<<<z = i * (W_n(- (4k+1)pi/2)) / ((4k+1)pi/2) for all integers k and n>>>"
