    "An analysis of the problem proceeds as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definitions and the Core Condition**\n\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if `S ∩ S*S = ∅`, where `S*S = {ab | a, b ∈ S}`. This means for any two elements `a, b` in `S` (possibly `a=b`), their product `ab` is not in `S`.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set (MIPS):** A product-free set `S` is a MIPS if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group `G` is filled if every MIPS `S` in `G` generates `G` (i.e., `<S> = G`).\n\nA crucial, more practical criterion for determining if a group is filled has been established in the literature (e.g., in B. Street's thesis and subsequent papers by Balog, Guralnick, et al.). This criterion states:\n**A finite group `G` is filled if and only if for every proper subgroup `H` of `G`, and for every element `g ∈ G \\ H`, it holds that `g² ∉ H`.**\nIn simpler terms, no element outside a proper subgroup can have its square inside that subgroup.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Structure of Groups of Order `2q^m`**\n\nLet `G` be a group of order `|G| = 2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number (`m ≥ 1`).\nWe analyze the group's structure using Sylow's Theorems.\n1.  Let `P` be a Sylow `q`-subgroup of `G`, so `|P| = q^m`.\n2.  Let `n_q` be the number of Sylow `q`-subgroups. According to Sylow's Theorems, `n_q` must divide the index of `P` in `G`, which is `|G|/|P| = 2q^m / q^m = 2`. So, `n_q` can be 1 or 2.\n3.  Also, `n_q` must be congruent to `1` modulo `q`, i.e., `n_q ≡ 1 (mod q)`.\n4.  If `n_q = 2`, then `2 ≡ 1 (mod q)`, which implies `q` divides `2-1=1`. This is impossible for a prime `q`.\n5.  Therefore, `n_q` must be 1. This means the Sylow `q`-subgroup `P` is unique, and hence it is a normal subgroup of `G`.\n\nNow, consider a Sylow 2-subgroup, `K`. Its order is `|K|=2`, so `K ≅ C₂`. Since `P` is a normal subgroup and its order (`q^m`) is coprime to the order of the quotient group `G/P` (which is 2), the Schur-Zassenhaus Theorem applies. It guarantees that `G` is a split extension of `P` by `K`, which means `G` is a semidirect product:\n`G ≅ P ⋊ K ≅ P ⋊ C₂`.\n\nThe question specifies that `G` is nonabelian. This implies that the semidirect product is not a direct product, so the homomorphism from `C₂` to `Aut(P)` defining the action is non-trivial.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Filled Group Condition**\n\nWe will now use the criterion from Step 1 to check if any such group `G` can be filled. We need to see if we can find a proper subgroup `H < G` and an element `g ∈ G \\ H` such that `g² ∈ H`.\n\n*   **Choose a proper subgroup `H`:** Let's choose the normal Sylow `q`-subgroup `H = P`. Since `|G|=2|P|` and `|P| \\ge q \\ge 3`, `P` is a proper subgroup of `G`. (In fact, since its index is 2, a prime, `P` is a maximal subgroup of `G`).\n\n*   **Choose an element `g` outside of `H`:** Let `x` be the non-identity element of the Sylow 2-subgroup `K`. By the definition of the semidirect product, `K ∩ P = {e}`, so `x` is not an element of `P`. Thus, we can choose `g = x`, and we have `g ∈ G \\ P`.\n\n*   **Check the condition:**\n    1.  We have selected a proper subgroup `H = P`.\n    2.  We have selected an element `g = x` such that `g ∉ H`.\n    3.  Now, we compute `g²`. Since `g = x` is the non-identity element of `K`, a group of order 2, we have `g² = x² = e` (the identity element).\n    4.  Finally, we check if `g²` is in `H`. Since `H=P` is a subgroup, it must contain the identity element `e`. So, `g² = e ∈ H`.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nWe have found a proper subgroup (`H=P`) and an element (`g=x`) such that `g` is not in `H` but `g²` is in `H`. This violates the necessary and sufficient condition for `G` to be a filled group.\n\nThis argument holds for any group `G` of order `2q^m`, regardless of whether it is abelian or nonabelian. The structure `G ≅ P ⋊ C₂` is fixed, and the subgroup `P` and the element `x` will always exist.\n\nTherefore, no group of order `2q^m` can be a filled group. Consequently, the set of nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` is empty."
