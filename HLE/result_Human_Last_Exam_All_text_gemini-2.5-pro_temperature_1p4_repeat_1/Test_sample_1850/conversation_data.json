    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### **Step 1: Defining the Terms**\n\nFirst, we must clearly define what constitutes a \"historical saint mentioned by name\" for the purpose of this question.\n*   **Historical:** The figure must be a human who is understood to have actually lived, as opposed to a purely allegorical or mythological being. This includes figures from the Bible.\n*   **Saint:** The figure must be recognized as a saint by a major Christian tradition (e.g., Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Anglican). Milton's personal (Puritan) view on their sainthood is not the deciding factor; the question is about historical recognition. Angels and divine beings (like the Son of God) are excluded from this category.\n*   **Mentioned by Name:** The saint's actual name must appear in the text of *Paradise Lost*. Allusions to a person without naming them (e.g., referring to John the Baptist as \"The voice of one crying in the Desert\") do not count.\n\n### **Step 2: Locating the Relevant Passages**\n\nThe most likely place in *Paradise Lost* to find a list of historical figures is in Books XI and XII. In these books, the Archangel Michael shows a chastened Adam a vision and narrative of future world history, from his expulsion from Eden to the end of time.\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying and Verifying Each Candidate**\n\nWe will go through the historical figures mentioned in Books XI and XII and check them against our criteria.\n\n**Book XI:** Michael shows Adam visions of the future.\n1.  **Abel:** Mentioned as \"righteous Abel\" (XI, 454). Abel is venerated as the first martyr and a saint. **(Count: 1)**\n2.  **Enoch:** Described as \"the only righteous in a World perverse... Enoch\" (XI, 665). Enoch is venerated as a saint. **(Count: 2)**\n3.  **Noah:** Called \"The one just Man alive\" (XI, 808) and named \"him Noah\" (XI, 818). Noah is venerated as a saint. **(Count: 3)**\n\n**Book XII:** Michael continues by narrating future history.\n4.  **Abraham:** Mentioned by name: \"a Nation from one faithful man... Abraham\" (XII, 113). Abraham is a patriarch and venerated saint. **(Count: 4)**\n5.  **Isaac:** Mentioned by name: \"Of ISAAC, and his Twinns...\" (XII, 153). Isaac is a patriarch and venerated saint. **(Count: 5)**\n6.  **Jacob:** Mentioned by name alongside his son: \"Jacob and Joseph, who a shelter find\" (XII, 165). Jacob is a patriarch and venerated saint. **(Count: 6)**\n7.  **Joseph:** Mentioned by name in the same line as his father (XII, 165). Joseph the Patriarch is venerated as a saint. **(Count: 7)**\n8.  **Moses:** Mentioned by name: \"...to his great Leader, MOSES\" (XII, 226). Moses is a major prophet and venerated saint. **(Count: 8)**\n9.  **Joshua:** Mentioned by name: \"JOSHUA, whom the Gentiles JEsus call\" (XII, 310). Joshua is venerated as a saint. **(Count: 9)**\n10. **David:** Mentioned by name: \"To DAVID... from DAVIDS Throne\" (XII, 322, 331). King David is venerated as a saint and prophet. **(Count: 10)**\n11. **Solomon:** Mentioned by name: \"His Son, who richer far... SOLOMON\" (XII, 333). King Solomon is venerated as a saint in some traditions. **(Count: 11)**\n12. **Mary:** Mentioned by name as the mother of the Messiah: \"...a Virgin is his Mother... her name Mary\" (XII, 368). The Virgin Mary is the most prominent of all saints. **(Count: 12)**\n13. **Constantine:** Mentioned by name in the context of the Church's corruption: \"his victor from the persecution great / Of PAGAN... whom ZEAL... shall cause to join / With temporal power\" (XII, 517-520). The Emperor Constantine is a historical figure venerated as a major saint (\"Equal-to-the-Apostles\") in the Eastern Orthodox Church. **(Count: 13)**\n\n### **Step 4: Considering and Excluding Other Figures**\n*   **Adam and Eve:** While venerated as saints in some traditions, their role in the epic is as the universal progenitors of mankind and the central figures of the Fall. They are not mentioned in the context of a list of exemplary saints in the way the figures in Michael's vision are.\n*   **Cain:** Mentioned by name, but he is the archetype of a sinner, not a saint.\n*   **Apostles:** They are mentioned as a group (\"his twelve\"), but none are mentioned individually by name (e.g., Peter, Paul, John).\n*   **John the Baptist:** He is clearly alluded to (\"The voice of one crying in the Desert\"), but he is not mentioned by his name, \"John\".\n\n### **Conclusion**\nBased on a systematic analysis of the text and applying the defined criteria, there are 13 historical figures who are traditionally considered saints and are mentioned by their specific names in *Paradise Lost*.\n\n<<<13>>>"
