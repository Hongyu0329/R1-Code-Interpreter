    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Musical Work and Section:** The piece is Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\". We need to find the very end of the symphony, which is the conclusion of the fourth and final movement, marked \"Allegro con fuoco\".\n\n2.  **Locate the Specific Instrumental Part:** The question asks for the part played by the \"first violin\" (Violino I in the score). In a full orchestral score, this is typically the top line of the string section.\n\n3.  **Examine the Final Measures of the First Violin Part:** To find the last three notes, we must look at the last one or two measures of the score for the first violin.\n    *   The symphony ends on a powerful D Major chord.\n    *   The final measure for the first violin consists of a single whole note.\n    *   The measure just before the final one (the penultimate measure) contains two notes for the first violin.\n    *   Therefore, the \"last three notes\" are the two notes in the penultimate measure followed by the single note in the final measure.\n\n4.  **Identify the Specific Notes:**\n    *   **Note 1 (First of the three):** In the penultimate measure, the first note played by the first violin is a G. In the standard treble clef, this note sits on the space just above the top line of the staff.\n    *   **Note 2 (Second of the three):** The second note in the penultimate measure is a B. This note sits on the first ledger line above the staff.\n    *   **Note 3 (The very last note):** The final note of the symphony for the first violin, held as a whole note in the last measure, is a D. This note sits on the second ledger line above the staff.\n\n5.  **Compare the Pitches of the Three Notes:** The three notes in sequence are G, B, and D. We need to determine their relative pitches to find the lowest one.\n    *   The first note is G5 (the G above the treble clef staff).\n    *   The second note is B5 (the B above the treble clef staff).\n    *   The third and final note is D6 (the D even higher).\n\n    When comparing these three notes (G5, B5, D6), the G5 is the lowest in pitch.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy analyzing the score of Dvořák's Symphony No. 2, we find that the last three notes for the first violin are G, B, and D. Of these three, G is the lowest.\n\n<<<G>>>"
