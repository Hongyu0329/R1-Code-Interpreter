    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad.**\nThe first step is to comb through the text of the *Iliad* to find all references to real, geographical mountains. The main mountains mentioned are:\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, located in Thessaly, Greece. It is the tallest mountain in Greece. The question explicitly asks to exclude this one.\n*   **Mount Ida:** A mountain range in the Troad (modern-day Turkey), near the site of Troy. Zeus often observes the battle from its highest peak, Gargarus.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Samos):** The island of Samothrace has a prominent peak, Mount Fengari. In Book 13, Poseidon sits on this peak to watch the fighting.\n*   **Mount Athos:** A mountain and peninsula in northeastern Greece. In Book 14, Hera flies past it on her journey from Olympus to Lemnos.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** A mountain in Thessaly, Greece, not far from Olympus. It is mentioned as the source of the ash wood for Achilles' famous spear.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** Mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2) as the mountain under which the Maeonians (Lydians) live. It is located in modern-day Turkey.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important to distinguish between mountains that are central to the plot (like Olympus and Ida) and those that are mentioned more in passing as geographical markers (like Athos, Pelion, and Tmolus). All, however, are valid candidates as they are \"mentioned in the Iliad.\"\n\n**Step 2: Exclude Mount Olympus.**\nThe question specifies \"After Mount Olympus,\" so we remove it from our list of candidates for the final answer. Its height (2,918 m or 9,573 ft) serves as the upper benchmark.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the elevation of the remaining mountains.**\nNow we must find the modern elevations of the remaining historical mountains to compare them.\n\n*   **Mount Tmolus (modern Bozdağ, Turkey):** Approximately 2,159 meters (7,083 ft).\n*   **Mount Athos (Greece):** Approximately 2,033 meters (6,670 ft).\n*   **Mount Ida (modern Kaz Dağı, Turkey):** Approximately 1,774 meters (5,820 ft).\n*   **Mount Pelion (Greece):** Approximately 1,624 meters (5,328 ft).\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Mount Fengari, Greece):** Approximately 1,611 meters (5,285 ft).\n\n**Careful Point:** Heights are based on modern geological surveys. We must assume that the relative heights of these mountains have not changed significantly in a way that would alter their ranking since the Bronze Age when the story is set. This is a safe assumption for geological time scales.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the elevations to find the tallest.**\nBy listing the mountains in descending order of height, we can clearly identify the tallest among the candidates.\n\n1.  **Mount Tmolus:** 2,159 m\n2.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n3.  **Mount Ida:** 1,774 m\n4.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n5.  **Mount Samothrace:** 1,611 m\n\nThe tallest mountain on this list is Mount Tmolus.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, after Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
