    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Reverse Turn:** In ballroom dancing, a \"reverse turn\" is a standard figure that turns to the left. The name comes from its opposition to the \"natural turn,\" which turns to the right. This figure exists in various forms across the five standard ballroom dances listed.\n*   **Overturning:** This means turning more than the amount prescribed in the standard, textbook technique for a specific figure. For example, if a step is supposed to make a 1/4 turn, overturning would mean making a 3/8 or 1/2 turn on that same step.\n*   **\"Without Disregarding the Technique\":** This is the most crucial part of the question. It means we must adhere strictly to the established rules and principles of each dance, including footwork, alignment, body action (like CBM, sway, rise and fall), and the overall character of the dance. An action is considered \"impossible\" if it cannot be executed while following these technical rules.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Dance in Relation to the Question**\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz, B. English Waltz, D. Slow Foxtrot, E. Quickstep:** These four dances are known as \"swing\" dances. A fundamental characteristic of swing dances is continuous, flowing movement. Their technique is built on principles like CBM (Contra Body Movement), sway, and rise and fall, which facilitate smooth rotation.\n    *   In these dances, the amount of turn in a figure like the Reverse Turn can often be adjusted. For example, dancers might intentionally overturn a turn to navigate a corner of the dance floor. This is considered acceptable and advanced floorcraft; it does not disregard the fundamental technique but rather applies it skillfully. Therefore, in these four dances, it is *possible* to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:** The Tango is fundamentally different from the swing dances.\n    *   **Character:** It is a \"marching\" or \"staccato\" dance, characterized by sharp, deliberate movements, no rise and fall, and no sway. Movement is direct and not continuously flowing in the same way as swing dances.\n    *   **Technique of the Reverse Turn:** Let's consider a typical Tango Reverse Turn (e.g., the Closed Reverse Turn). The man's steps are: 1. Left Foot forward. 2. Right Foot to side. 3. Left Foot closes to Right Foot.\n    *   **The Key Limitation:** The critical action is on step 3: the feet close together. In Tango technique, this closing action is sharp and precise, and it effectively *stops* the rotation of the figure. To continue turning past the prescribed amount (i.e., to overturn the figure), the dancer would have to *avoid* closing the feet. They would have to take a different step, which would mean they are no longer performing a Closed Reverse Turn. By changing the defined footwork, they would be disregarding the technique of that specific figure. The very nature of the figure's construction, ending in a closing of the feet, makes further rotation technically impossible within the confines of that figure's definition.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude Based on the Analysis**\n\nIn the swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep, Viennese Waltz), overturning a Reverse Turn is a possible and often necessary variation that uses, rather than disregards, the principles of technique for purposes like floorcraft.\n\nIn the European Tango, the technique of the standard Closed Reverse Turn, which culminates in the feet closing together, creates a definitive end to the rotation. Attempting to overturn it would require altering the fundamental footwork of the figure, thus disregarding its technique. Therefore, it is the only dance on the list where it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
