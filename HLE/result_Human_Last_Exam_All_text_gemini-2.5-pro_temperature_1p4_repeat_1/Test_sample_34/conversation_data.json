    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:**\n    *   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the most profitable position in poker. You act last on every post-flop street, giving you a significant informational advantage. This allows you to play the widest range of hands profitably.\n    *   **Stack Depth:** 100 Big Blinds (BB). This is the standard stack depth for cash games, where post-flop play is very important. Implied odds are a factor.\n    *   **Action:** Open-raising to 2.5x. This is a standard opening size that puts pressure on the blinds without risking too much with a wide range.\n    *   **Game Type:** Rake-Free Cash Game. This is a critical detail. In a typical game, the house takes a percentage of the pot (the rake). This rake reduces the expected value (EV) of playing any hand. In a rake-free game, the EV of opening is higher because you get to fight for 100% of the pot. This incentivizes opening an even wider range of hands than usual.\n\n2.  **Understand Button Opening Range Theory:**\n    *   The button's primary goal with a pre-flop raise is often to steal the blinds. When you raise, the Small Blind and Big Blind might fold, and you win their blinds uncontested.\n    *   Even when called, the button has a positional advantage that allows for more profitable bluffing, value betting, and pot control post-flop.\n    *   Because of these factors, a standard GTO (Game Theory Optimal) button opening range is already very wide (around 45-50% of hands) in a raked game. In a rake-free game, this range expands even further, as marginal hands that were previously slightly unprofitable become profitable opens.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Suited Jacks (`JXs`):**\n    *   We need to rank all possible suited Jack combinations from best to worst. The strength of a suited hand is determined by its high card value, flush potential, and straight potential.\n    *   **High Card Value:** All these hands have a Jack, which is a decent high card.\n    *   **Flush Potential:** All these hands can make a Jack-high flush, so this factor is constant across all `JXs` hands.\n    *   **Straight Potential:** This is the key differentiator. The closer the second card is to the Jack, the better the straight potential.\n        *   **JTs:** Strongest. Connects to make Broadway straights (A-K-Q-J-T).\n        *   **J9s:** Very strong. One-gapper straight potential.\n        *   **J8s:** Strong. Two-gapper straight potential.\n        *   ...and so on, down the line.\n\n4.  **Identify the \"Worst\" Hand:**\n    *   As the second card gets lower, the hand's ability to make straights decreases. This reduces its overall playability and expected value.\n    *   The hands in descending order of strength are: `JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s`.\n    *   The weakest hand in this group is **J2s**. The '2' provides the least amount of connectivity to the 'J' for making straights. It has a massive 8-card gap.\n\n5.  **Determine if the \"Worst\" Hand Should Be Opened:**\n    *   The question asks for the worst suited jack you *should* open. This implies the hand is a profitable open-raise.\n    *   In a standard *raked* game, the weakest suited Jacks like J4s, J3s, and J2s might be considered folds or very marginal \"mix\" strategy hands (open sometimes, fold sometimes).\n    *   However, in a **rake-free** environment, the EV of stealing the blinds increases. Any hand that was previously on the borderline of being profitable now becomes a clear open. GTO solvers show that in a rake-free, 100BB game, the button should open an extremely wide range, which includes *all* suited Jack combinations.\n    *   Therefore, even though `J2s` is the weakest of the suited Jacks, it is still a profitable open-raise from the button under these specific game conditions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe weakest suited Jack is `J2s` due to its poor straight connectivity compared to all other `JXs` hands. In a rake-free game from the button, the incentive to open is so high that even this worst-in-class hand becomes a standard, profitable open-raise.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
