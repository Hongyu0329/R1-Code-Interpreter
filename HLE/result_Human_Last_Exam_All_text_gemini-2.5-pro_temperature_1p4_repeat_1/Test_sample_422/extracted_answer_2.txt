The two problems are:

1.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification:** The requirement that a belief must be justified to be knowledge leads to an infinite regress. If a belief (P) must be justified by a reason (J1), then for the belief to be truly justified, the agent must also be justified in holding J1. This second justification (J2) would in turn need its own justification (J3), and so on infinitely, making it impossible to ever fully justify any belief.

2.  **The Problem of Fallible Justification (and Indistinguishability):** The JTB model allows for Justified False Beliefs (which fall into the state of 'Belief'). This means justification can be fallible. However, from the subject's internal perspective, a Justified False Belief can be indistinguishable from a Justified True Belief ('Knowledge'). This poses a dilemma: either a) justification must be infallible (guaranteeing truth) to secure knowledge, which leads to skepticism as most of our justifications are fallible, or b) we can never be certain if we are in the state of 'Knowledge' or merely 'Belief', making the distinction externally determined and not transparent to the agent.
