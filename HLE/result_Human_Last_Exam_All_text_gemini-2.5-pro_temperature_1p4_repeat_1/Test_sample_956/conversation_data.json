    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Group G and its Generators**\n\nThe group $G$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_{12}$ acting on the set $S = \\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z \\}$. It is generated by three permutations:\n*   $a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x)$\n*   $b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, x, 7, 6)$\n*   $c = (1, 2)(3, z)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, y)(9, x)$\n\nOur first goal is to identify the group $G$. A common strategy for such problems is to deduce the group's identity from the properties of its generators, as direct computation is often infeasible.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the Parity of the Generators**\n\nWe determine if the generators are even or odd permutations. The sign of a $k$-cycle is $(-1)^{k-1}$.\n*   The permutation $a$ is an 11-cycle. Its sign is $(-1)^{11-1} = (-1)^{10} = +1$. So, $a$ is an even permutation.\n*   The permutation $b$ is a product of two disjoint 4-cycles. A 4-cycle is an odd permutation (sign $(-1)^{4-1} = -1$). The product of two odd permutations is even. So, $b$ is an even permutation.\n*   The permutation $c$ is a product of six disjoint 2-cycles (transpositions). A 2-cycle is an odd permutation. The product of six odd permutations is even. So, $c$ is an even permutation.\n\nSince all three generators $a, b, c$ are even permutations, the group $G = \\langle a, b, c \\rangle$ they generate must be a subgroup of the alternating group $A_{12}$.\n$G \\le A_{12}$.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Stabilizer of a Point**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of $G$ by looking at the stabilizer of a point. Let's choose the point $z$.\nThe stabilizer of $z$ in $G$ is $Stab_G(z) = \\{ g \\in G \\mid g(z) = z \\}$.\n*   The generator $a$ fixes $z$, so $a \\in Stab_G(z)$.\n*   The generator $b$ fixes $z$, so $b \\in Stab_G(z)$.\n*   The generator $c$ does not fix $z$ (since $c(z)=3$).\n\nThis implies that the subgroup $H = \\langle a, b \\rangle$ is a subgroup of $Stab_G(z)$.\n$H$ acts on the set $S' = S \\setminus \\{z\\}$, which has 11 elements.\n*   The generator $a$ is an 11-cycle on $S'$. Any group acting on a set of prime size $p$ that contains a $p$-cycle is transitive. Thus, $H$ is a transitive group on 11 elements.\n*   A transitive group on a set of prime size is necessarily primitive. So $H$ is a primitive group of degree 11.\n*   The generator $b$ has order 4. Its square, $b^2 = (1, 5)(8, 9)(4, 7)(x, 6)$, is an involution (order 2). On the set $S'$, $b^2$ fixes the points $\\{2, 3, y\\}$, so it's an involution with 3 fixed points.\n*   A classical result of group theory (due to Miller) states that a primitive group of degree 11 containing an involution with 3 fixed points must be the Mathieu group $M_{11}$.\nTherefore, $H = \\langle a, b \\rangle \\cong M_{11}$.\n\nFurthermore, any element $g \\in G$ that fixes $z$ can be written as a word in $a,b,c$. Since only $c$ moves $z$, $g$ must contain an even number of $c$'s when written out. Let's analyze the structure $G/N$ where $N$ is the kernel of the action on the set $\\{ \\{z\\}, S' \\}$. This suggests that any element fixing $z$ must lie in the subgroup generated by $a, b$ and conjugates of the form $g'cg'^{-1}c$ where $g'(z)=z$. A more straightforward argument relies on the maximality of $M_{11}$ in $A_{11}$.\nThe stabilizer $Stab_G(z)$ is a subgroup of $A_{11}$ (acting on $S'$) and contains $M_{11}$. Since $M_{11}$ is a maximal subgroup of $A_{11}$, $Stab_G(z)$ can only be $M_{11}$ or $A_{11}$.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the Group G**\n\nWe have two cases for $Stab_G(z)$:\n*   **Case 1: $Stab_G(z) \\cong M_{11}$.**\n    The group $G$ acts transitively on the set $S$ (the orbit of $z$ contains $c(z)=3$, and since $M_{11}$ is transitive on $S'$, the orbit of 3 under $Stab_G(z)$ is $S'$; thus the orbit of $z$ under $G$ is all of $S$).\n    By the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, $|G| = |S| \\cdot |Stab_G(z)| = 12 \\cdot |M_{11}| = 12 \\cdot 7920 = 95040$. This is the order of the Mathieu group $M_{12}$. A transitive group of degree 12 with a point stabilizer isomorphic to $M_{11}$ is isomorphic to $M_{12}$. So in this case, $G \\cong M_{12}$.\n\n*   **Case 2: $Stab_G(z) \\cong A_{11}$.**\n    By the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, $|G| = |S| \\cdot |Stab_G(z)| = 12 \\cdot |A_{11}| = 12 \\cdot (11!/2) = 12!/2 = |A_{12}|$.\n    Since we already know $G \\le A_{12}$, it must be that $G \\cong A_{12}$.\n\nSo, the group $G$ must be either $M_{12}$ or $A_{12}$. For the purposes of this problem, we do not need to distinguish further.\n\n**Step 5: Finding the Schur Multiplier A**\n\nThe question asks for the Schur multiplier of $G$, which we denote by $A$. The Schur multiplier of a group is its second homology group with integer coefficients, $H_2(G, \\mathbb{Z})$. We need to find the Schur multiplier for both potential candidates for $G$.\n*   The Schur multiplier of the Mathieu group $M_{12}$ is known to be the cyclic group of order 2, $C_2$.\n*   The Schur multiplier of the alternating group $A_n$ for $n \\ge 8$ is also the cyclic group of order 2, $C_2$.\n\nIn both possible cases ($G=M_{12}$ or $G=A_{12}$), the Schur multiplier is the same.\nSo, $A \\cong C_2$.\n\n**Step 6: Counting the Proper Subgroups of A up to Isomorphism**\n\nWe need to find the number of proper subgroups of $A=C_2$, up to isomorphism.\nA proper subgroup of $A$ is a subgroup $H$ such that $H \\neq A$.\nThe group $C_2$ has order 2. Its subgroups are in one-to-one correspondence with the divisors of 2, which are 1 and 2.\n*   The subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup, $\\{e\\}$.\n*   The subgroup of order 2 is $C_2$ itself.\n\nThe only proper subgroup of $A=C_2$ is the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\nThe question asks for the number of these subgroups *up to isomorphism*. The set of proper subgroups is $\\{\\{e\\}\\}$. All subgroups in this set are isomorphic to the trivial group $C_1$. Thus, there is only one isomorphism class of proper subgroups.\n\nThe number of proper subgroups of $A$ up to isomorphism is 1."
