The product is an isomer of the starting material, formed via an intramolecular etherification reaction. The hydroxyl group at C2 adds across the C5=C6 double bond of the norbornene core. This results in a new tetracyclic ether structure containing a C2-O-C6 bridge. All other substituents, including the cyclopentenyl group, the silyl ether, and the ketal, remain intact.
