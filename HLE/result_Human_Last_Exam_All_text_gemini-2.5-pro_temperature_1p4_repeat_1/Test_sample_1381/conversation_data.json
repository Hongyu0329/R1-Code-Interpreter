    "An equilibrium of the system is a point $X = (X_1, \\dots, X_N)$ in the state space where $\\dot{X_i} = 0$ for all $i=1, \\dots, N$. The state space for abundances is the non-negative orthant, $X_i \\ge 0$ for all $i$.\n\nThe dynamical equations are:\n$$ \\dot{X_i} = R_i X_i (1 - \\frac{X_i}{K_i}) + \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^N (A_i - A_j) R_i R_j X_i X_j $$\n\nFor each species $i$, the condition $\\dot{X_i} = 0$ can be satisfied in two ways:\n1.  $X_i = 0$ (the species is extinct).\n2.  $X_i > 0$ and the term in the effective growth rate is zero:\n    $$ R_i (1 - \\frac{X_i}{K_i}) + \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^N (A_i - A_j) R_i R_j X_j = 0 $$\n    Since $R_i \\ge 1$, we can divide by $R_i$:\n    $$ 1 - \\frac{X_i}{K_i} + \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^N (A_i - A_j) R_j X_j = 0 $$\n\nAn equilibrium point is therefore characterized by a partition of the $N$ species into two sets:\n-   The set of extinct species, $S_{extinct} = \\{i \\mid X_i = 0\\}$.\n-   The set of present species, $S_{present} = \\{i \\mid X_i > 0\\}$.\n\nLet's pick an arbitrary subset of species $P \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ and assume it is the set of present species at a potential equilibrium, so $S_{present} = P$. For any species $k \\in P$, its abundance $X_k$ must satisfy the second condition. For species $j \\notin P$, $X_j=0$. The sum is therefore only over species in $P$.\nFor each $k \\in P$, we have:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{X_k}{K_k} + \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum_{j \\in P} (A_k - A_j) R_j X_j = 0 $$\nThis is a system of $|P|$ equations for the $|P|$ unknown abundances $\\{X_k\\}_{k \\in P}$.\n\nLet's rewrite the system of equations for $\\{X_k\\}_{k \\in P}$:\n$$ \\frac{X_k}{K_k} - \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum_{j \\in P} (A_k - A_j) R_j X_j = 1 $$\nThis is a system of linear equations in the variables $X_k$. Let's write it in matrix form $\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{1}$, where $\\mathbf{X}$ is the vector of abundances for species in $P$, and $\\mathbf{1}$ is a vector of ones. The matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ has elements:\n$$ M_{ki} = -\\frac{\\Gamma}{N} (A_k - A_i) R_i \\quad \\text{for } k \\neq i $$\n$$ M_{kk} = \\frac{1}{K_k} - \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} (A_k - A_k) R_k = \\frac{1}{K_k} $$\nThe system is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{K_k} X_k - \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum_{j \\in P, j \\neq k} (A_k - A_j) R_j X_j = 1 \\quad \\text{for each } k \\in P $$\n\nFor generic values of the parameters, the matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ will be invertible, and the system $\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{1}$ will have a unique solution $\\mathbf{X}^* = \\mathbf{M}^{-1} \\mathbf{1}$.\nThis solution is a valid equilibrium if all its components are positive, i.e., $X_k^* > 0$ for all $k \\in P$. If some components are negative or zero, then no such equilibrium with the chosen set $P$ exists.\nEven if the matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ is singular (non-invertible), which can happen for specific parameter choices, there will be either no solution or a line/plane of solutions. However, such cases are non-generic. For any given subset $P$, there is at most one equilibrium (assuming generic parameters).\n\nSince each equilibrium corresponds to a specific subset of species being present, and for each subset there is at most one such equilibrium, the total number of equilibria is at most the total number of subsets of $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$. The number of subsets is $2^N$.\nThis provides an upper bound on the number of possible equilibria.\n\nNow, we need to check if this number of equilibria can actually be achieved for some choice of parameters.\nConsider the special case where all parameters $A_i$ are equal, i.e., $A_i = A_0$ for all $i=1, \\dots, N$.\nIn this case, the interaction term simplifies significantly:\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^N (A_i - A_j) R_j X_j = \\sum_{j=1}^N (A_0 - A_0) R_j X_j = 0 $$\nThe system of equations becomes:\n$$ \\dot{X_i} = R_i X_i (1 - \\frac{X_i}{K_i}) $$\nThis describes $N$ independent logistic growth models, one for each species.\nThe equilibria of the full system are the combinations of the equilibria of each 1D subsystem.\nFor each species $i$, the equation $\\dot{X_i}=0$ has two solutions:\n1.  $X_i = 0$\n2.  $X_i = K_i$\n\nSince there are two possibilities for each of the $N$ species, we can construct an equilibrium point by choosing for each species $i$ whether its abundance is $0$ or $K_i$. The total number of ways to do this is $2 \\times 2 \\times \\dots \\times 2$ ($N$ times), which is $2^N$.\nFor this specific choice of parameters (all $A_i$ equal), the system has exactly $2^N$ equilibria. Each equilibrium is a vector $(x_1, \\dots, x_N)$ where $x_i \\in \\{0, K_i\\}$.\n\nSince the number of equilibria is at most $2^N$, and we have found a case with exactly $2^N$ equilibria, the answer to \"how many equilibria can exist as parameters vary\" is $2^N$."
