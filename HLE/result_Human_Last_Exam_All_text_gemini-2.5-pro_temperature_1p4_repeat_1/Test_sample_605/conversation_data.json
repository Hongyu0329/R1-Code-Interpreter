    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem Definition**\n    The user is asking for the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau manifold. This manifold is defined as a hypersurface in a weighted projective space. The necessary components are:\n    *   The equation of the hypersurface: $F(z_1, \\dots, z_5) = 0$.\n    *   The weights of the ambient projective space: $w = (w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$.\n    *   The Calabi-Yau condition.\n\n2.  **Identify the Weights and Variables**\n    *   The variables are $z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5$. The number of variables is $k=5$.\n    *   The ambient space is defined by the weights $w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Degree of the Hypersurface**\n    The polynomial is given as $0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$. For a hypersurface in a weighted projective space, the defining polynomial must be weighted-homogeneous, meaning each monomial has the same weighted degree. Let's calculate the degree of each term using the weights $w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$:\n    *   `deg`(z₁⁸z₃) = 8 * w₁ + 1 * w₃ = 8 * 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225.\n    *   `deg`(z₁⁴z₂³z₃) = 4 * w₁ + 3 * w₂ + 1 * w₃ = 4 * 22 + 3 * 29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224.\n    *   `deg`(z₁z₂⁷) = 1 * w₁ + 7 * w₂ = 1 * 22 + 7 * 29 = 22 + 203 = 225.\n    *   `deg`(z₁z₂z₃z₄z₅) = w₁ + w₂ + w₃ + w₄ + w₅ = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225.\n    *   `deg`(z₂z₃⁴) = 1 * w₂ + 4 * w₃ = 29 + 4 * 49 = 29 + 196 = 225.\n    *   `deg`(z₄³z₅) = 3 * w₄ + 1 * w₅ = 3 * 50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225.\n    *   `deg`(z₅³) = 3 * w₅ = 3 * 75 = 225.\n    There is a typo in the second term ($z_1^4z_2^3z_3$), as its degree is 224 while all others are 225. We will assume the intended degree of the polynomial is $d=225$.\n\n4.  **Verify the Calabi-Yau Condition**\n    A hypersurface $X_d \\subset \\mathbb{P}_{w_1, \\dots, w_k}^{k-1}$ is Calabi-Yau if its degree $d$ equals the sum of the weights $\\sum w_i$.\n    *   Sum of weights: $\\sum w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n    *   Degree of polynomial: $d = 225$.\n    Since $d = \\sum w_i$, the Calabi-Yau condition is satisfied.\n\n5.  **State the Formula for the Crawley-Nordström Invariant**\n    The \"Calabi-Yau Link\" refers to the link of the isolated singularity of the affine cone over the Calabi-Yau manifold. The Crawley-Nordström invariant for the link of a singularity defined by a weighted homogeneous polynomial in $k$ variables with weights $w_1, \\dots, w_k$ and degree $d$ is given by the formula:\n    $c_N = \\frac{d^k}{\\prod_{i=1}^k w_i}$\n    For this problem, $k=5$, $d=225$, and $w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Invariant**\n    Substitute the values into the formula:\n    $c_N = \\frac{225^5}{22 \\times 29 \\times 49 \\times 50 \\times 75}$\n\n7.  **Simplify the Expression**\n    To simplify, we use the prime factorization of the numerator and the denominator.\n    *   Numerator: $d^5 = 225^5 = (3^2 \\times 5^2)^5 = 3^{10} \\times 5^{10}$.\n    *   Denominator:\n        *   $w_1 = 22 = 2 \\times 11$\n        *   $w_2 = 29$ (prime)\n        *   $w_3 = 49 = 7^2$\n        *   $w_4 = 50 = 2 \\times 5^2$\n        *   $w_5 = 75 = 3 \\times 5^2$\n        *   $\\prod w_i = (2 \\times 11) \\times 29 \\times 7^2 \\times (2 \\times 5^2) \\times (3 \\times 5^2)$\n        *   $\\prod w_i = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^4 \\times 7^2 \\times 11^1 \\times 29^1$\n\n    Now, we form the fraction:\n    $c_N = \\frac{3^{10} \\times 5^{10}}{2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^4 \\times 7^2 \\times 11^1 \\times 29^1}$\n\n    Cancel common factors by subtracting the exponents:\n    $c_N = 3^{10-1} \\times 5^{10-4} \\times 2^{-2} \\times 7^{-2} \\times 11^{-1} \\times 29^{-1}$\n    $c_N = \\frac{3^9 \\times 5^6}{2^2 \\times 7^2 \\times 11 \\times 29}$\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Value**\n    *   Numerator: $3^9 \\times 5^6 = 19,683 \\times 15,625 = 307,546,875$.\n    *   Denominator: $2^2 \\times 7^2 \\times 11 \\times 29 = 4 \\times 49 \\times 11 \\times 29 = 196 \\times 319 = 62,524$.\n\n    The Crawley-Nordström invariant is the rational number:\n    $c_N = \\frac{307,546,875}{62,524}$\n\n    *Careful Point*: Although this invariant is often an integer in known physical examples (as it corresponds to a necessary condition for the existence of a Sasaki-Einstein metric on the link), the formal definition gives a rational number. Given the inputs, there are no further simplifications possible as the prime factors of the denominator (2, 7, 11, 29) are not present in the numerator (which only has factors of 3 and 5). Therefore, the calculated fraction is the final answer based on the provided data.\n\nThe final answer is the fraction obtained from the calculation.\n\n<<<307546875/62524>>>"
