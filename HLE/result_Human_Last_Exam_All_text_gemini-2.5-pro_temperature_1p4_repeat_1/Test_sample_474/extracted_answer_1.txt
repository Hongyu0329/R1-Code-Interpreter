No, this approach is not ecologically valid. The ecological function of mimicry is determined by the perception of natural predators (like birds), not humans. Avian predators have tetrachromatic vision that includes ultraviolet (UV) light, which humans cannot see. Since bee coloration often includes UV patterns, the undergraduates (and the standard cameras used to take the photos) would be blind to a critical component of the visual signal. Therefore, the human-based similarity rankings would not accurately reflect how a predator perceives the bees, making the resulting clusters an invalid representation of functional mimicry syndromes.
