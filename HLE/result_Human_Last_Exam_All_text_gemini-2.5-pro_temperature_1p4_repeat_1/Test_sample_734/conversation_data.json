    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** The question asks for a specific \"Christian theologian.\"\n    *   **What:** This theologian must have \"developed specialized terminology.\" This implies the creation of a specific conceptual system with its own vocabulary, not just a general discussion.\n    *   **Why:** The terminology is used to \"describe changes in the laws of nature.\" This involves the relationship between God's power and the regular, predictable operation of the physical world.\n    *   **Application 1:** The system must be applicable to the \"virgin birth of Jesus.\" This is a singular, unique event that appears to suspend or bypass the ordinary laws of biology. It is a classic example of a miracle.\n    *   **Application 2:** The system must also be applicable to \"possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall.\" This refers to the theological idea that the fundamental operating principles of the natural world (e.g., relating to death, decay, suffering, predation) were different before the sin of Adam and Eve. This is a systemic, universal change, not a singular miracle.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Theological Concepts and Potential Candidates:**\n    *   The core issue is the theology of miracles and divine action. How does an omnipotent God interact with the world He created and ordered?\n    *   Early Church Fathers are the most likely candidates for being \"first.\" Figures like Irenaeus and Athanasius discussed the incarnation and the Fall, but the theologian most famous for building a systematic framework around these ideas is **Augustine of Hippo** (354–430 AD).\n    *   Later Scholastic theologians, such as **Thomas Aquinas**, also developed highly refined terminology (e.g., God's _potentia ordinata_ vs. _potentia absoluta_, or ordered power vs. absolute power). However, Augustine's work predates Aquinas by over 800 years and laid the essential foundation that later thinkers built upon. The question asks who was *first*.\n\n3.  **Analyze Augustine of Hippo's Contribution:**\n    *   Augustine confronted challenges from pagan philosophers who argued that miracles were impossible because they violated the fixed, unchangeable laws of nature.\n    *   To answer this, he developed a crucial distinction. He argued that miracles are not **_contra naturam_** (contrary to nature), because nothing can happen that is contrary to the will of God, the author of nature.\n    *   Instead, he coined the idea that miracles are **_contra quam est nota natura_** (contrary to nature *as it is known to us*). This is the \"specialized terminology\" the question refers to. It creates two levels of understanding: the ordinary, observable laws of nature that humans know, and the higher, complete law of nature as it exists in the mind and will of God.\n\n4.  **Apply Augustine's Terminology to the Specific Cases:**\n\n    *   **The Virgin Birth:** From our perspective, the virgin birth is contrary to the known laws of biology. However, in Augustine's system, it is not contrary to nature itself. God, as the creator, simply acted according to the higher principles of his creative power, which are beyond our limited observation. Augustine also used the concept of **_rationes seminales_** (\"seminal reasons\" or latent potencies) that God embedded in creation, which He could activate at any time to bring about new or miraculous events.\n\n    *   **Alterations in Natural Law at the Fall:** Augustine's framework is uniquely suited to explain this systemic change. He taught that the original created order (before the Fall) operated under a different \"law.\" For example, humans were created conditionally immortal. The Fall introduced sin, and with it, God's judgment brought about a change in the operating principles of the world. Death, decay, and toil became part of the new **_usitatus cursus naturæ_** (the usual course of nature). This wasn't a miracle in the sense of a one-time exception, but a permanent alteration in the very \"laws\" that govern the world as we now know it.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Primacy:** Augustine was the first to systematize this specific theological defense of miracles and divine action in this way in the Latin West. His ideas were profoundly influential on all subsequent Western theology.\n*   **Terminology:** The key is his specific Latin phrasing: _contra quam est nota natura_. This is a precise theological tool designed to solve a specific philosophical problem.\n*   **Dual Applicability:** His system elegantly handles both singular exceptions to the rule (miracles like the virgin birth) and fundamental changes in the rule itself (the effects of the Fall on the natural order).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy developing the distinction between nature *as a whole known only to God* and nature *as it is ordinarily known to humans*, Augustine of Hippo was the first Christian theologian to provide a specialized terminology that could simultaneously explain the virgin birth as an act consistent with God's higher law and the changes at the Fall as an alteration in the ordinary, observable laws of nature.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
