    "**1. Understanding the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s)$. This means we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy the following three conditions:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$.\n2.  $D(s)$ is a polynomial matrix and its determinant is not identically zero (i.e., it's invertible).\n3.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. This means that the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex numbers $s$.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n**Step 1: Set up the equation**\n\nThe defining equation is $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$, which can be rewritten as $D(s) H(s) = N(s)$. We need to find a polynomial matrix $D(s)$ such that the product $D(s)H(s)$ results in another polynomial matrix, $N(s)$.\n\nLet $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. Then $N(s)$ is given by:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11} \\\\ d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Find conditions for N(s) to be a polynomial matrix**\n\nFor $N(s)$ to have all its entries as polynomials, the following must hold:\n-   $N_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s)$ must be a polynomial.\n-   $N_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)$ must be a polynomial.\n-   $N_{11}(s) = d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{s^2-1}$ must be a polynomial. This implies that the numerator must be zero at the roots of the denominator, i.e., at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n-   $N_{21}(s) = \\frac{d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)}{s^2-1}$ must be a polynomial. This implies its numerator must also be zero at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n\n**Step 3: Construct a minimal D(s) satisfying the conditions**\n\nLet's construct the rows of $D(s)$ one by one, aiming for the simplest possible polynomial entries.\n\n*   **First row of D(s):** Let's find $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{12}(s)$.\n    The numerator of $N_{11}(s)$, $d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)$, must be zero at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n    -   At $s=1$: $d_{11}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(1)=0$. Thus, $d_{12}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$.\n    -   At $s=-1$: $d_{11}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0$.\n    Let's try the simplest choice for $d_{11}(s)$, a constant: $d_{11}(s)=1$.\n    The condition at $s=-1$ becomes $4(1) + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(-1) = -2$.\n    We also need $d_{12}(1)=0$. Let's try the simplest polynomial for $d_{12}(s)$ that satisfies these two conditions. A degree-1 polynomial $d_{12}(s) = as+b$.\n    $d_{12}(1) = a+b = 0 \\implies b=-a$.\n    $d_{12}(-1) = -a+b = -2 \\implies -a-a=-2 \\implies -2a=-2 \\implies a=1$.\n    So $b=-1$. This gives $d_{12}(s) = s-1$.\n    Thus, a candidate for the first row of $D(s)$ is $[1 \\quad s-1]$.\n\n*   **Second row of D(s):** Let's find $d_{21}(s)$ and $d_{22}(s)$.\n    The numerator of $N_{21}(s)$, $d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)$, must be zero at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n    Let's try a simple choice: $d_{21}(s)=0$.\n    The condition becomes that $2d_{22}(s)$ must be zero at $s=1$ and $s=-1$. This means $d_{22}(s)$ must have factors of $(s-1)$ and $(s+1)$, i.e., a factor of $(s^2-1)$.\n    The simplest non-zero choice is $d_{22}(s) = s^2-1$.\n    Thus, a candidate for the second row of $D(s)$ is $[0 \\quad s^2-1]$.\n\nCombining these gives our candidate matrix $D(s)$:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe determinant is $\\det(D(s)) = 1(s^2-1) - 0 = s^2-1$, which is not identically zero, so $D(s)$ is invertible.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the corresponding N(s)**\n\nUsing the $D(s)$ we found, we calculate $N(s)=D(s)H(s)$:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN_{11}(s) = 1 \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s-1) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2(s-1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{s-1+2}{s+1} = \\frac{s+1}{s+1} = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nN_{12}(s) = 1 \\cdot 1 + (s-1) \\cdot 0 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nN_{21}(s) = 0 \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s^2-1) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} = 2\n\\]\n\\[\nN_{22}(s) = 0 \\cdot 1 + (s^2-1) \\cdot 0 = 0\n\\]\nSo the resulting $N(s)$ is:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nSince all entries of $N(s)$ are polynomials, our construction is valid.\n\n**Step 5: Verify coprimeness**\n\nWe need to check if $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank (i.e., rank 2) for all $s \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\\[\n[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe rank of a 2x4 matrix is less than 2 only if its two rows are linearly dependent. Let's see if there is any $s$ for which Row 2 is a multiple of Row 1.\nSuppose `Row 2 = k * Row 1` for some scalar $k$.\n$[0, s^2-1, 2, 0] = k[1, s-1, 1, 1] = [k, k(s-1), k, k]$.\nComparing the first elements gives $0 = k$.\nIf $k=0$, the equation becomes $[0, s^2-1, 2, 0] = [0, 0, 0, 0]$. This requires $2=0$, which is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the two rows can never be linearly dependent for any value of $s$. The rank of the matrix is always 2.\nThis confirms that $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe calculated left coprime factorization is $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ where:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n<<<\n\\[ D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n>>>"
