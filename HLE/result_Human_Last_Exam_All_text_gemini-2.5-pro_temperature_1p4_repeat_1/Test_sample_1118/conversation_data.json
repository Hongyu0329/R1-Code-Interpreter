    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n*   **Context:** Created after he had escaped from the Gestapo.\n*   **Core Question:** What object is he holding in his hand, and why is it a symbol of resistance?\n\n**Step 2: Research the specific artwork and its context.**\nThe painting is known as \"Selbstbildnis nach der Flucht vor der Gestapo\" (Self-Portrait after Escaping from the Gestapo) or \"Selbstbildnis mit rotem Tuch\" (Self-Portrait with Red Cloth). In March 1933, following the Nazi seizure of power, Curt Querner, who was a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), was arrested by the Gestapo. He managed to escape.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the painting's composition.**\nThe self-portrait shows Querner with a haggard, tense face. He is looking over his shoulder, conveying a sense of fear and being on the run. The focus of the composition, besides his face, is the object clutched in his hand.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the object and its symbolic meaning.**\nIn his hand, Curt Querner is holding a **red cloth** or rag.\n*   **Careful Point 1: The color is crucial.** The color red has a long and powerful history as a symbol of the workers' movement, socialism, and communism. The red flag was the banner of leftist and revolutionary movements.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The context of 1933 Germany is paramount.** The Nazi regime brutally suppressed all political opposition, particularly communists and socialists. For Querner, a known communist who had just escaped the secret police, to paint himself holding a red cloth was an act of immense bravery and defiance.\n*   **Careful Point 3: The object itself.** By holding a simple red cloth rather than a formal flag, he symbolizes that the spirit of the movement persists even in hiding and suppression, carried by ordinary individuals. It is a personal and potent symbol of his unbroken political convictions.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the information to answer the question.**\nCurt Querner painted this self-portrait in 1933 immediately after escaping the Gestapo. In the painting, he holds a red cloth. This object serves as a powerful symbol of resistance because the color red was the symbol of the communist and socialist movements that the Nazi regime was actively persecuting. By defiantly clutching this symbol of his political allegiance, Querner affirmed his beliefs in the face of mortal danger, making the painting a profound statement of personal and political resistance.\n\n***\n\nIn the 1933 self-portrait painted after his escape from the Gestapo, Curt Querner holds a **red cloth** in his hand as a symbol of resistance. This cloth represents his communist beliefs and defiance against the Nazi regime."
