    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the probability.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the System and the Question**\n\nThe system is a particle in a one-dimensional (1D) infinite potential well, commonly known as a \"particle in a box\".\n*   The length of the box is `a`, extending from `x = 0` to `x = a`.\n*   We are interested in the quantum state with principal quantum number `n = 2`.\n*   The goal is to find the probability of finding the particle in the small interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n\n### **Step 2: Recall the Wavefunction and Probability Density**\n\nThe normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is given by:\n`ψₙ(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)`\n\nThe probability density, `P(x)`, which represents the probability per unit length of finding the particle at a position `x`, is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n`P(x) = |ψₙ(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)`\n\nFor our specific case where `n = 2`, the probability density is:\n`P(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)`\n\n### **Step 3: Set up the Probability Integral**\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval from `x₁` to `x₂` is calculated by integrating the probability density over that interval:\n`Prob(x₁ ≤ x ≤ x₂) = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] |ψₙ(x)|² dx`\n\nSubstituting our specific values:\n`Prob = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx`\n\n### **Step 4: Solve the Integral**\n\nTo solve this integral, we first use the trigonometric power-reduction identity: `sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2`.\nIn our case, `θ = 2πx/a`, so `2θ = 4πx/a`.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n`Prob = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * [ (1 - cos(4πx/a))/2 ] dx`\n`Prob = (1/a) * ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx`\n\nNow, we perform the integration:\n`∫ (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx = x - (a/4π) * sin(4πx/a)`\n\nNext, we evaluate this result at the limits of integration (`x₂ = 0.505a` and `x₁ = 0.495a`):\n`Prob = (1/a) * [ {x₂ - (a/4π)sin(4πx₂/a)} - {x₁ - (a/4π)sin(4πx₁/a)} ]`\n`Prob = (1/a) * [ (x₂ - x₁) - (a/4π){sin(4πx₂/a) - sin(4πx₁/a)} ]`\n\nSubstitute the values for `x₁` and `x₂`:\n*   `x₂ - x₁ = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a`\n*   `4πx₂/a = 4π(0.505a)/a = 2.02π`\n*   `4πx₁/a = 4π(0.495a)/a = 1.98π`\n\nThe expression for the probability becomes:\n`Prob = (1/a) * [ 0.01a - (a/4π){sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)} ]`\n`Prob = 0.01 - (1/4π) * {sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)}`\n\n### **Step 5: Simplify the Trigonometric Terms and Calculate the Final Value**\n\n**Careful Point:** We need to evaluate the sine terms carefully. We can use the properties `sin(2π + α) = sin(α)` and `sin(2π - α) = -sin(α)`.\n*   `sin(2.02π) = sin(2π + 0.02π) = sin(0.02π)`\n*   `sin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)`\n\nSubstituting these back into the probability expression:\n`Prob = 0.01 - (1/4π) * {sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))}`\n`Prob = 0.01 - (1/4π) * {2 * sin(0.02π)}`\n`Prob = 0.01 - (1/2π) * sin(0.02π)`\n\nNow we calculate the numerical value. The angle `0.02π` is small, so we can use the Taylor series expansion for sine: `sin(u) ≈ u - u³/6`. Let `u = 0.02π`.\n`Prob ≈ 0.01 - (1/2π) * [ (0.02π) - (0.02π)³/6 ]`\n`Prob ≈ 0.01 - [ 0.01 - (0.02π)²/12 ]`\n`Prob ≈ (0.02π)²/12 = (0.0004π²)/12 = π²/3 * 10⁻⁴`\n\nLet's also calculate it directly from the final exact expression for better accuracy. Let `w = 0.01`.\n`Prob = w - (1/2π) * sin(2πw)`\nUsing a calculator (in radian mode):\n`2πw = 2 * π * 0.01 ≈ 0.06283`\n`sin(0.06283) ≈ 0.06279`\n`Prob ≈ 0.01 - (1/(2π)) * (0.06279)`\n`Prob ≈ 0.01 - (0.06279 / 6.283)`\n`Prob ≈ 0.01 - 0.0099934`\n`Prob ≈ 0.00000658`\n\nThus, the probability is approximately `6.58 x 10⁻⁶`.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n1.  The center of the interval (`0.5a`) is a node for the `n=2` state, meaning `ψ₂(0.5a) = 0`. A simple approximation `P ≈ |ψ(0.5a)|²Δx` would incorrectly yield zero.\n2.  The calculation requires integrating a `sin²` function, which is always non-negative.\n3.  The final calculation involves subtracting two very close numbers (`0.01` and `sin(0.02π)/(2π)`). This requires either a high-precision calculation or using a Taylor series expansion to reveal the leading term of the result. Both methods, when done correctly, yield the same answer.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n`Prob = (π²/3) * 10⁻⁴ ≈ (9.8696/3) * 10⁻⁴ ≈ 3.2898 * 10⁻⁴`\nLet's recheck the Taylor series algebra.\n`Prob ≈ w - (1/2π)(2πw - (2πw)³/6) = w - w + (8π³w³)/(12π) = (2/3)π²w³`\n`Prob ≈ (2/3)π²(0.01)³ = (2/3)π² * 10⁻⁶ ≈ (2/3) * 9.8696 * 10⁻⁶ ≈ 6.5797 * 10⁻⁶`\nThe final calculation should use `w³`, not `w²` or other terms. The correct leading term is `(2/3)π²w³`.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
