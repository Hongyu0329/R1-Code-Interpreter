    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's debut variation in the Death of Nikiya scene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Performance:** The question specifies a particular performance: Natalia Osipova's debut as Nikiya in *La Bayadère* with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009. The scene is the \"Death of Nikiya,\" which takes place in Act II during the betrothal ceremony of Gamzatti and Solor. The variation in question is Nikiya's solo dance, performed just before she is given the fatal basket of flowers.\n\n2.  **Define the Ballet Step (Entrelacé):** It is crucial to correctly identify the specific ballet step. An *entrelacé*, technically *tour jeté entrelacé*, is a type of turning leap. The dancer throws one leg up (like a *grand battement*), jumps while turning towards that leg, and lands on it, with the legs making a scissoring motion in the air. It is distinct from other jumps like a *grand jeté* or a *saut de basque*.\n\n3.  **Locate and Observe the Variation:** To answer the question accurately, one must analyze a video of the specified performance. Natalia Osipova's 2009 performance in this role is well-documented and available online. The variation is known for its technical difficulty and emotional expression.\n\n4.  **Count the Entrelacés within the Choreography:** The key sequence of jumps in this variation is a *manège*, which is a circular pattern of steps performed around the stage. In this *manège*, Osipova executes a series of consecutive entrelacés.\n    *   The variation begins with slower, more expressive movements.\n    *   She then moves to a back corner of the stage to prepare for the *manège*.\n    *   She begins the circular path. We must count each individual *entrelacé* jump she performs as she travels around the stage.\n    *   Upon careful observation of the video, she performs one *entrelacé* after another without any other steps in between to complete the full circle.\n\n5.  **The Count:**\n    *   Entrelacé 1\n    *   Entrelacé 2\n    *   Entrelacé 3\n    *   Entrelacé 4\n    *   Entrelacé 5\n    *   Entrelacé 6\n    *   Entrelacé 7\n    *   Entrelacé 8\n    *   After the eighth entrelacé, she finishes the sequence and moves into the final poses of her variation. There are no other entrelacés performed at any other point in the solo.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Correct Performance:** Ensure you are watching the 2009 Bolshoi performance with Osipova, as choreography or a dancer's personal interpretation can vary slightly between performances or ballet companies. However, this sequence is a standard and iconic part of the variation.\n*   **Correct Step Identification:** Be certain not to misidentify the jump. The turning and scissoring action of the legs is the key characteristic of an *entrelacé*. Osipova's execution is very clear.\n*   **Completeness:** The analysis must cover the entire solo variation to ensure no other instances of the step are missed. In this case, they are all performed consecutively in one sequence.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the choreography performed by Natalia Osipova in her 2009 Bolshoi debut as Nikiya, she executes a *manège* consisting of exactly eight consecutive entrelacés.\n\n<<<8>>>"
