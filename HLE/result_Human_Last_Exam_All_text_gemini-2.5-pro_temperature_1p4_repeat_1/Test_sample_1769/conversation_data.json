    "This question requires a journey into historical linguistics and a counterfactual scenario. We need to trace the etymology of the current word and then determine what native word it replaced, and how that native word would have evolved into Modern English.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the current word \"sister\":** The Modern English word \"sister\" is not a native Anglo-Saxon word. It is a loanword from Old Norse, the language of the Vikings who invaded and settled in parts of England. The Old Norse word was *systir*. The Vikings' language was similar enough to Old English that many words were borrowed and integrated, often replacing the native equivalent.\n\n2.  **Identify the original Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word:** Before the influence of Old Norse became dominant, the Anglo-Saxons had their own word for a female sibling. This word was **sweoster**. It shares a common Proto-Germanic root (*swestēr) with the Old Norse *systir*, which is why they look somewhat similar.\n\n3.  **Trace the hypothetical evolution of *sweoster*:** If the Norse had never introduced *systir*, the native word *sweoster* would have continued to evolve along with the rest of the English language. We can predict its modern form by observing how other Old English words changed over time.\n    *   **From Old English to Middle English:** The Old English diphthong \"eo\" in *sweoster* (pronounced roughly as /sweo-ster/) typically smoothed into a simple \"e\" sound during the Middle English period. This is a well-documented sound change. Therefore, *sweoster* became **swester** in Middle English. This is not just a guess; the form *swester* is attested in Middle English texts, where it competed with *sister* before eventually dying out.\n    *   **From Middle English to Modern English:** The word *swester* would have then undergone the further sound shifts that led to Modern English. However, the short 'e' sound (/ɛ/) as in \"best\" or \"test\" is quite stable. The consonant cluster 'sw-' and the ending '-ester' are also stable. There are no major sound shifts (like the Great Vowel Shift, which primarily affected long vowels) that would have dramatically altered *swester*.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The Middle English form *swester* would likely have been carried into Modern English with minimal changes to its spelling and core pronunciation. It would be spelled and pronounced similarly to other words with that structure, such as \"Chester\" or \"Leicester\".\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Counterfactual Nature:** This is an educated guess based on linguistic patterns, not a certainty. Language evolution can be unpredictable.\n*   **Competing Forms:** The form *swester* did exist and was used for a time, which strengthens the argument for it being the logical successor. Its disappearance was a direct result of the preference for the Norse-derived *sister*.\n*   **Cognates:** We can look at other West Germanic languages that were not as heavily influenced by Old Norse in this specific vocabulary. For example, the German word is *Schwester* and the Dutch word is *zuster*, both of which evolved from the same root as the Old English *sweoster*. This shows that the \"swe-\" or \"su-\" beginning was the native form.\n\nTherefore, without the Norse influence, the native Old English word *sweoster* would have evolved into *swester*.\n\n<<<swester>>>"
