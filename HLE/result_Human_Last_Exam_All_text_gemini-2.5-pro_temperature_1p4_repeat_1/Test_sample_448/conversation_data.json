    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nFirst, we need to list the elements that are classified as noble gases. These are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring noble gases on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n(Oganesson is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally, so it is not a candidate).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Question's Scope**\nThe question asks for the rarest noble gas as a \"percentage of all terrestrial matter\" in \"2002\".\n*   **\"All terrestrial matter\"**: This means we should consider the total amount of each gas on the entire planet, including the atmosphere, oceans, crust, and mantle.\n*   **\"2002\"**: The relative abundances of these elements do not change on such short timescales. Data from around that period or current general data is acceptable and will lead to the same conclusion.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Abundance of Stable Noble Gases**\nLet's first look at the stable (non-radioactive or very long-lived) noble gases. Their primary reservoir is the Earth's atmosphere. Here are their approximate concentrations in dry air by volume:\n*   **Argon (Ar)**: ~0.934% (or 9,340 parts per million, ppm). It is the most abundant noble gas.\n*   **Neon (Ne)**: ~18.2 ppm\n*   **Helium (He)**: ~5.2 ppm\n*   **Krypton (Kr)**: ~1.1 ppm\n*   **Xenon (Xe)**: ~0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion, ppb)\n\nBased on this atmospheric data, Xenon (Xe) is the rarest of the *stable* noble gases. Even considering amounts dissolved in the oceans or trapped in the Earth's crust, the relative order of abundance for these stable gases remains the same.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Abundance of Radon (Rn)**\nRadon is a unique case because it is radioactive.\n*   **Source**: Radon is not a primordial element from the Earth's formation. It is continuously generated from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium, which are present in trace amounts in the Earth's crust and soil.\n*   **Radioactive Decay**: The most stable isotope of Radon, Radon-222, has a very short half-life of only 3.8 days.\n*   **Accumulation**: Because it decays so quickly, Radon never accumulates in significant quantities. As soon as it's formed, it begins to decay into other elements.\n*   **Concentration**: Its concentration is extremely low and variable. In the atmosphere, its concentration is on the order of 1 part in 10^21, which is vastly lower than Xenon's 90 parts per billion. The total amount of Radon in the entire atmosphere at any given moment is estimated to be only a few tens of kilograms.\n\n**Step 5: Compare All Candidates and Conclude**\nNow we compare the rarest stable noble gas, Xenon, with Radon.\n*   The total mass of **Xenon** in the atmosphere is approximately 2 trillion (2 x 10^12) kilograms.\n*   The total mass of **Radon** in the atmosphere is approximately a few tens of kilograms (e.g., ~40 kg).\n\nThe difference is immense. The total amount of Radon present on Earth at any single moment is many orders of magnitude less than the total amount of Xenon. Therefore, Radon is by far the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  The distinction between stable and radioactive gases is critical. The question does not specify \"stable noble gas,\" so radioactive ones must be included.\n2.  Radon's rarity is a direct consequence of its short half-life, which prevents it from accumulating.\n3.  While Xenon is the rarest of the stable noble gases, Radon is significantly rarer overall.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
