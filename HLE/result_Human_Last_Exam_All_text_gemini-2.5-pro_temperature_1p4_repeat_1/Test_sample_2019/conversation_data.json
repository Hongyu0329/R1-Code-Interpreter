    "Answering this question requires combining concepts from combinatorics and finite geometry. Let's break down the problem methodically.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Board and Constraints\n\n*   **The Board**: A 5x5 toroidal chessboard. The \"toroidal\" nature means the board wraps around. If we label rows and columns from 0 to 4, moving off the right edge brings you to the left edge, moving off the bottom edge brings you to the top, etc. Mathematically, all coordinates are considered modulo 5. A position is an ordered pair `(r, c)` where `r, c` are in `Z_5 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n*   **The Pieces**: 4 queens. We are looking for the number of ways to place these queens on the 25 squares. Since the queens are identical, we are counting the number of valid sets of 4 squares.\n*   **The \"Non-Attacking\" Constraint**: A queen attacks along its row, column, and diagonals. On a toroidal board, these attack lines also wrap around. For two queens placed at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)`, they attack each other if any of the following conditions are met:\n    1.  `r1 = r2` (Same row)\n    2.  `c1 = c2` (Same column)\n    3.  `r1 - c1 ≡ r2 - c2 (mod 5)` (Same main diagonal)\n    4.  `r1 + c1 ≡ r2 + c2 (mod 5)` (Same anti-diagonal)\n\nTherefore, a valid placement of 4 queens is a set of 4 distinct squares `{(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), (r4, c4)}` such that all 4 row indices (`ri`) are distinct, all 4 column indices (`ci`) are distinct, all 4 main diagonal indices (`ri - ci mod 5`) are distinct, and all 4 anti-diagonal indices (`ri + ci mod 5`) are distinct.\n\n### Careful Point 1: Connection to Finite Geometry\n\nThis problem can be elegantly modeled using the affine plane over the finite field of 5 elements, denoted `AG(2, 5)`.\n*   The 25 squares of the board correspond to the 25 points `(x, y)` in `AG(2, 5)`.\n*   The attack lines correspond to lines in this plane. A line in `AG(2, 5)` is a set of points satisfying an equation `y = mx + c` (for lines with a defined slope) or `x = c` (for vertical lines).\n    *   Rows (`y = const`) are lines of slope `m = 0`.\n    *   Columns (`x = const`) are lines of slope `m = ∞`.\n    *   Main diagonals (`y - x = const` or `y = x + k`) are lines of slope `m = 1`.\n    *   Anti-diagonals (`y + x = const` or `y = -x + k`) are lines of slope `m = -1 ≡ 4 (mod 5)`.\n\nThe problem is now transformed: **Find the number of 4-point subsets of `AG(2, 5)` such that no two points lie on the same line of slope `0, 1, 4, or ∞`.**\n\n### Step 2: Finding the Structure of Solutions\n\nA key insight comes from considering sets of points that are themselves collinear. Let's take a set of 4 points that lie on a single line, `y = mx + k`.\n*   If we choose 4 points on this line, they have distinct `x` coordinates.\n*   The `y` coordinates are `m*xi + k`. They are distinct if `m ≠ 0`.\n*   The main diagonal indices are `yi - xi = (m-1)*xi + k`. They are distinct if `m-1 ≠ 0`, i.e., `m ≠ 1`.\n*   The anti-diagonal indices are `yi + xi = (m+1)*xi + k`. They are distinct if `m+1 ≠ 0`, i.e., `m ≠ -1 ≡ 4`.\n\nSo, a set of 4 points chosen from a line `y = mx + k` will form a valid solution if the slope `m` is not one of the \"attacking\" slopes: `0, 1, 4, ∞`.\nThe possible slopes in `Z_5` are `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`. The \"allowed\" slopes are therefore `m=2` and `m=3`.\n\n### Careful Point 2: Are all solutions of this form?\n\nIs it possible to have a valid set of 4 points that are *not* collinear on a line of slope 2 or 3? For this specific problem (`k=4` queens on an `n=5` board), a theorem from finite geometry states that this is not possible. Since `n=5` is prime and the number of queens `k=4` satisfies the condition `k > (n+1)/2` (i.e., `4 > 3`), all solutions must be \"linear\" – that is, they consist of points collinear on a line with an \"allowed\" slope.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Solutions\n\nSince all solutions are sets of 4 points on lines with slope 2 or 3, we just need to count how many such sets exist.\n\n**Case 1: Solutions from lines with slope m = 2**\n*   There are 5 parallel lines with slope 2. These are given by the equations `y = 2x + c` for `c ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n*   Each line in `AG(2, 5)` contains exactly 5 points.\n*   For each of these 5 lines, we need to form a solution by choosing 4 of its 5 points. The number of ways to do this is `C(5, 4) = 5`.\n*   Total solutions from slope 2 lines = (Number of lines) × (Ways to choose points from a line) = `5 × 5 = 25`.\n\n**Case 2: Solutions from lines with slope m = 3**\n*   This case is symmetric to the one above. There are 5 parallel lines with slope 3, given by `y = 3x + c` for `c ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n*   Each of these 5 lines also has 5 points.\n*   For each line, we can choose 4 points in `C(5, 4) = 5` ways.\n*   Total solutions from slope 3 lines = (Number of lines) × (Ways to choose points from a line) = `5 × 5 = 25`.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe total number of ways is the sum of the solutions from these two disjoint cases (a set of 4 points cannot lie on two different lines).\n\nTotal Ways = (Solutions from slope 2) + (Solutions from slope 3) = 25 + 25 = 50.\n\n<<<50>>>"
