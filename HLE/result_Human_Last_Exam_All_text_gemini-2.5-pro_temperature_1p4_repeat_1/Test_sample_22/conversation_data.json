    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Key Terms**\n    *   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** A polygenic score is a tool used to predict an individual's genetic predisposition for a particular trait or disease. It is calculated by summing up the effects of many genetic variants (SNPs) across the genome. The effect of each SNP (its \"weight\" in the sum) is estimated from a large-scale genetic study, typically a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). So, a PGS is a practical predictor built using *estimated* data.\n    *   **Predictive Ability of a PGS:** This measures how well the PGS can forecast the actual phenotype (e.g., height, disease status) in a new group of individuals not used in the original GWAS. This is typically quantified by the R-squared (R²) value, which represents the proportion of the total variance in the phenotype that is explained by the PGS.\n    *   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a theoretical concept. It represents the *total proportion* of phenotypic variance in a population that can be explained by *all* common SNPs combined. It is the theoretical upper limit or ceiling on how much of a trait's variation is attributable to these genetic variants, assuming we knew their *true* effects perfectly. It is not a measure of prediction in a specific sample but an estimate of a population parameter.\n\n2.  **Compare the Concepts**\n    *   The crucial difference lies in **\"estimated effects\" vs. \"true effects\"**.\n    *   A **PGS** is constructed using SNP effect sizes that are *estimated* from a GWAS of a finite sample size. These estimates always contain some level of statistical noise or error. The larger the GWAS, the smaller the error, but it is never zero.\n    *   **SNP heritability** is based on the idea of using the *true*, unknown effect sizes of all SNPs. It represents a perfect-knowledge scenario.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Relationship**\n    *   Since a PGS is built with imperfect (i.e., estimated and therefore noisy) weights, its ability to predict the phenotype will be less than the theoretical maximum possible.\n    *   The SNP heritability represents this theoretical maximum predictive power. It's the amount of variance you could explain if you had a \"perfect\" PGS, one built with the true effect sizes of all SNPs.\n    *   Because any real-world PGS is built from a finite study, its weights are not perfect. This imperfection directly reduces its predictive ability. The variance explained by the PGS (R²) will therefore be lower than the total variance that is theoretically explainable by all SNPs (h²_SNP).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the word \"Necessarily\"**\n    *   The word \"necessarily\" implies that the predictive ability of a PGS must *always* be lower.\n    *   Could the R² of a PGS ever be equal to or greater than the SNP heritability?\n        *   **Equality (R² = h²_SNP):** This would only be possible if the PGS was constructed using the true, perfect effect sizes of every SNP. This would require a GWAS of infinite size, which is impossible. Therefore, in any practical or real-world scenario, the R² will be strictly lower.\n        *   **Greater Than (R² > h²_SNP):** This should not happen in principle. It would mean that a predictor based on noisy information is better than a perfect theoretical predictor. Such a result in a real study would likely be due to statistical artifacts, such as: 1) overfitting, 2) sample overlap between the training and testing datasets, or 3) random chance in a small test sample. When considering the true, expected predictive value, it cannot exceed the heritability ceiling.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Finite Sample Size:** The accuracy of the effect size estimates used in the PGS is limited by the size of the GWAS study. This is the primary reason for the gap between PGS predictive ability and SNP heritability.\n*   **Genetic Architecture:** For traits influenced by many SNPs with very small effects, it is harder to estimate the weights accurately, leading to a larger gap.\n*   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** PGS methods must account for the correlation structure between SNPs (LD). Imperfect modeling of LD can reduce predictive accuracy.\n*   **Population Differences:** If the PGS is trained in one population (e.g., European ancestry) and tested in another, its accuracy will likely decrease due to differences in genetic makeup, further ensuring it remains below the theoretical maximum.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe SNP heritability sets the theoretical ceiling for genetic prediction using SNPs. A polygenic score is a practical attempt to reach that ceiling. Due to real-world limitations, primarily the fact that it is based on *estimated* rather than *true* genetic effects, its predictive power will necessarily be lower than this theoretical ceiling.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **True**.\n\n<<<True>>>"
