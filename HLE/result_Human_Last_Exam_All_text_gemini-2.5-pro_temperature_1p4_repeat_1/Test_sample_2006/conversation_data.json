    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Riddle's Components**\nThe riddle has three main parts:\n1.  **The Title/Question**: \"The Bays\". We are told this is a question.\n2.  **The Clues**: The haiku itself provides the information needed to answer the question.\n    *   \"An August tempest\"\n    *   \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"\n    *   \"A divine one yields\"\n3.  **The Constraint**: The answer must be a word whose letters are in alphabetical order (e.g., 'almost' where a-l-m-o-s-t are sorted alphabetically).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Haiku for Meaning**\nLet's analyze each line of the haiku to extract its meaning. The poem appears to be describing a specific number or value.\n*   **\"An August tempest\"**: This sets the scene. We are talking about a powerful storm, likely over water, during the month of August.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**: This line provides a number. \"Twice fifteen\" is `2 * 15 = 30`. The phrase \"winds of change\" can be taken literally as referencing the wind of the storm.\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"**: In this context, \"yields\" means to produce or add. \"A divine one\" refers to the number 1. So, this line means we should add 1 to our running total.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues to Get a Value**\nBy combining the numerical clues from the haiku, we get a simple calculation:\n*   From the second line: 30\n*   From the third line: + 1\n*   Total: `30 + 1 = 31`\n\nThe haiku cleverly describes the number 31. This number must be significant in the context of an \"August tempest\". On the Beaufort wind scale, a wind speed of 28-33 knots is classified as a \"Near Gale,\" which is a type of tempest. Therefore, the haiku is describing a tempest with a wind speed of 31 knots.\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the Question and Find the Answer**\nNow we connect this back to the question, \"The Bays\".\n*   The question can be interpreted directly: \"What is the state of the water in the bays during this tempest?\"\n*   A strong, 31-knot wind blowing over a bay would create large, swelling, and rolling waves.\n*   We now need to find a word that describes this scene and also meets the alphabetical order constraint.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Alphabetical Constraint**\nThe word we are looking for must describe large, swelling waves, and its letters must be in alphabetical order.\n*   Consider the word **BILLOWY**.\n*   It means \"characterized by or full of billows; swelling or surging.\" This perfectly describes the waves in a bay during a tempest.\n*   Let's check the letters: B, I, L, L, O, W, Y. When placed in alphabetical order, each letter is the same as or comes after the previous one (B ≤ I ≤ L ≤ L ≤ O ≤ W ≤ Y). The word satisfies the constraint.\n\nAll parts of the riddle are satisfied by this answer. The question (\"The Bays\") asks for the state of the water. The haiku describes a tempest with 31-knot winds. The result is \"billowy\" waves, and the word `BILLOWY` has its letters in alphabetical order.\n\n<<<BILLOWY>>>"
