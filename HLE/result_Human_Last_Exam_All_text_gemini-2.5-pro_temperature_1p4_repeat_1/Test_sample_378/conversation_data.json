    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The user is asking for the specific year when a person named \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Person:** The name \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\" refers to the former President of Nigeria, who served from 2010 to 2015.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Name:** The question includes \"Azikiwe\" as part of his name. The first crucial step is to verify if this is accurate.\n    *   The official and widely recognized full name of the former president is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**.\n    *   The name \"Azikiwe\" is famously associated with **Nnamdi Azikiwe**, who was the first President of Nigeria.\n\n4.  **Verify the Premise:** The question operates on the premise that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan at some point adopted or publicly used the name \"Azikiwe\" for himself. This premise needs to be fact-checked.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** Check official records, biographical data, and reputable news archives for any name changes or public declarations by Goodluck Jonathan regarding the name \"Azikiwe\".\n    *   **Finding:** There is no credible evidence, official record, or report from any reputable source that suggests Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever added \"Azikiwe\" to his official name or publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\".\n\n5.  **Address Potential Confusion:**\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** The user might be confusing two different prominent Nigerian leaders: Goodluck Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe. They are separate individuals from different eras.\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** It's possible the user is thinking of a metaphorical statement. A politician might reference a historical figure by saying something like \"I am following in the footsteps of Azikiwe,\" but this is not the same as adopting the name. A thorough search for such speeches or statements also does not yield any event where he identified *as* Azikiwe.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the available facts, the event described in the question—Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe—never happened. His name has consistently been documented as Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a year for an event that did not occur.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the premise of the question is incorrect.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. His full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The name Azikiwe belongs to Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria. Therefore, the event described in the question never occurred.>>>"
