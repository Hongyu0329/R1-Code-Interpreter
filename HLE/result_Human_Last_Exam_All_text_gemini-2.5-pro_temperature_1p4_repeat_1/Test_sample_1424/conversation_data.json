    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Defining the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)**\n\nThe bare Green's function, also known as the non-interacting or free Green's function, describes the propagation of a particle in a system without any interactions. In the Feynman path integral formalism, it is derived from the generating functional corresponding to the non-interacting action, $S_0$. Physically, it represents the probability amplitude for a particle to propagate from one spacetime point to another.\n\n**2. The Feynman Path Integral and the Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$)**\n\nThe Feynman path integral for a quantum field theory is built upon the system's action. For a non-interacting system of fermions (for concreteness), the action is quadratic in the fields $\\psi^*$ and $\\psi$:\n\n$S_0[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\int dt \\, d^d x \\, \\psi^*(x,t) (i\\hbar\\partial_t - H_0) \\psi(x,t)$\n\nHere:\n*   $\\psi(x,t)$ and $\\psi^*(x,t)$ are the field operators (which are integration variables in the path integral).\n*   $H_0$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian for the non-interacting system.\n*   The operator $\\mathcal{O}_0 = (i\\hbar\\partial_t - H_0)$ is the core operator defining the system's dynamics.\n\nThe Green's function is fundamentally the inverse of this operator $\\mathcal{O}_0$. That is, it is the solution to the equation:\n$(i\\hbar\\partial_t - H_0) G_0(x, t; x', t') = \\hbar \\delta(t-t')\\delta(x-x')$\n\n**3. Choosing the Appropriate Basis**\n\nThe question asks for the dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$. These are defined by the eigenvalue equation for the Hamiltonian $H_0$:\n$H_0 |k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |k\\rangle$\n\nHere, $|k\\rangle$ represents a single-particle eigenstate (e.g., a plane wave state with momentum $k$) and $\\epsilon_k$ is its corresponding energy. To make the dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ explicit, we must work in the basis of these eigenstates. This is achieved by performing a Fourier transform from spacetime $(x, t)$ to the energy-eigenstate basis, which we can label by $(k, \\omega)$, where $\\omega$ is the frequency (the Fourier conjugate of time).\n\n**4. Transforming the Operator and Solving for $G_0$**\n\nWhen we transform the operator $\\mathcal{O}_0 = (i\\hbar\\partial_t - H_0)$ into the $(k, \\omega)$ basis, its action on a component with labels $(k, \\omega)$ simplifies dramatically:\n\n*   The time derivative $i\\hbar\\partial_t$ becomes multiplication by the frequency variable $\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   The Hamiltonian operator $H_0$ becomes multiplication by its eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nTherefore, the operator in this basis is just an algebraic expression:\n$\\mathcal{O}_0(k, \\omega) = \\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k$\n\nThe defining equation for the Green's function in this basis becomes:\n$(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k) G_0(k, \\omega) = 1$  (The delta functions on the right-hand side become unity after Fourier transformation).\n\nSolving for $G_0(k, \\omega)$ yields:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**5. Incorporating the Feynman Boundary Conditions (A Careful Point)**\n\nThe expression above has a singularity, or a pole, when $\\hbar\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. The path integral formalism for a time-ordered (Feynman) Green's function provides a specific prescription for handling this pole. It requires shifting the pole infinitesimally off the real axis by adding a small imaginary term, $i\\eta$ (where $\\eta \\to 0^+$), to the denominator. This ensures correct causal propagation.\n\nThe final form for the bare Feynman Green's function in the frequency-eigenstate basis is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\n**(Note:** For many-body systems at zero temperature, the sign of the $i\\eta$ term depends on whether the state $k$ is occupied or unoccupied in the ground state (i.e., whether its energy $\\epsilon_k$ is below or above the chemical potential $\\mu$). The general form is $G_0(k, \\omega) = (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu))^{-1}$. However, the fundamental dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ remains the same in all cases.)\n\n### Summary of the Functional Dependence\n\nThe analysis shows that the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is as follows:\n\n1.  **Pole Structure:** The Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ has a **simple pole** in the complex frequency ($\\omega$) plane.\n2.  **Pole Location:** The real part of the pole's location is determined **directly and solely** by the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. Specifically, the pole lies at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k / \\hbar$.\n3.  **Functional Form:** The dependence is an **inverse linear relationship**. $G_0$ is proportional to the inverse of the difference between the Fourier-transformed energy variable ($\\hbar\\omega$) and the eigenenergy ($\\epsilon_k$).\n\nThis pole structure is the most fundamental feature of the bare propagator. It signifies that a non-interacting particle can only propagate \"on-shell\", i.e., with an energy exactly equal to one of the system's allowed single-particle energy eigenvalues.\n\n### Final Answer\n<<<The bare Green's function, $G_0$, in the frequency-eigenstate representation $(k, \\omega)$, has a simple pole whose location is determined by the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. The functional dependence is of the form $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$, which is an inverse linear dependence on the term $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.>>>"
