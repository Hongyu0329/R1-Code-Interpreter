    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\nFirst, let's understand the key terms in the question:\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** We are working with a simple undirected graph `G = (V, E)` where the number of vertices is `|V| = n = 128`.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. A clique of size `k` is a complete graph `K_k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S \\subseteq V`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` is the graph whose vertex set is `S` and whose edge set consists of all edges in `E` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n*   **Clique sizes that appear as induced subgraphs:** A clique size `k` is said to appear in `G` if there exists a subset of vertices `S \\subseteq V` with `|S| = k` such that the induced subgraph `G[S]` is a `K_k`.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the maximum possible value for the number of *different* clique sizes that can exist simultaneously in a single graph `G` on 128 vertices.\n\nLet `M` be the number of different clique sizes. We want to find the maximum possible value of `M`.\n\n**2. Establish an Upper Bound for M**\n\nLet `G` be any graph on `n=128` vertices. Let the set of all clique sizes that appear as induced subgraphs in `G` be `C = {k_1, k_2, ..., k_M}`, where `M` is the number of different sizes.\n\nBy definition, a clique of size `k` is an induced subgraph on `k` vertices. The number of vertices in any induced subgraph cannot be greater than the total number of vertices in the graph `G`.\nTherefore, any clique size `k` present in `G` must satisfy `1 \\le k \\le n`.\nSo, the set of possible clique sizes `C` must be a subset of the set of integers `{1, 2, 3, ..., n}`.\n`C \\subseteq \\{1, 2, ..., 128\\}`.\n\nThe number of elements in `C`, which is `M`, must be less than or equal to the number of elements in `{1, 2, ..., 128}`.\nThus, `M \\le 128`.\nThis means it's impossible for a graph on 128 vertices to have more than 128 different clique sizes.\n\n**3. Show that the Upper Bound is Achievable**\n\nNow we need to determine if it is possible to construct a graph `G` on 128 vertices that actually achieves this maximum of `M = 128`. This would require constructing a graph that contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n\nConsider the **complete graph** on `n=128` vertices, denoted as `K_{128}`. In a complete graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nLet's check the clique sizes present in `K_{128}`. We want to see if for every integer `k` from 1 to 128, there exists an induced subgraph that is a `K_k`.\n\nLet `V` be the vertex set of `K_{128}`, so `|V| = 128`.\nChoose any integer `k` such that `1 \\le k \\le 128`.\nSelect any subset of vertices `S \\subseteq V` such that `|S| = k`.\nNow consider the induced subgraph `K_{128}[S]`.\nThe vertices of `K_{128}[S]` are the vertices in `S`.\nThe edges of `K_{128}[S]` are all the edges from `K_{128}` that connect two vertices in `S`.\nSince `K_{128}` is a complete graph, every pair of distinct vertices in `V` is connected. This property holds for the subset `S` as well: every pair of distinct vertices in `S` is connected by an edge in `K_{128}`.\nTherefore, the induced subgraph `K_{128}[S]` is a complete graph on `k` vertices, which is a `K_k`.\n\nSince we can do this for any `k` from 1 to 128, the graph `K_{128}` contains induced cliques of all sizes `1, 2, 3, ..., 128`.\nThe set of clique sizes for `K_{128}` is `{1, 2, ..., 128}`.\nThe number of different clique sizes is `M = 128`.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   We have shown that the maximum possible number of different clique sizes, `M`, in a graph on 128 vertices is at most 128.\n*   We have constructed a specific graph, the complete graph `K_{128}`, which achieves this maximum value of `M=128`.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on 128 vertices is 128.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Clique vs. Maximal Clique:** The question uses the term \"clique,\" which is a complete subgraph. It does not say \"maximal clique,\" which is a clique that cannot be extended by adding another vertex. This distinction is crucial. In `K_{128}`, there is only one maximal clique (the whole graph), so if the question were about maximal cliques, the answer would be 1.\n*   **Overlapping Vertex Sets:** The sets of vertices that form the cliques of different sizes are not required to be disjoint. Our construction of `K_{128}` heavily relies on this fact. For example, a set of 3 vertices forming a `K_3` can be a subset of a set of 4 vertices forming a `K_4`. An incorrect assumption of disjoint vertex sets would lead to a much smaller number (which would be 15, from solving `1+2+...+M \\le 128`).\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** The \"induced\" part is important. It means we are not just looking for a `K_k` as a subgraph, but one where there are no extra edges (in the main graph `G`) between its vertices than the ones required for it to be a clique. For a complete graph `G=K_n`, any complete subgraph is automatically an induced subgraph.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis confirms that the problem is straightforward if the definitions are interpreted in their standard graph-theoretic sense.\n\n<<<128>>>"
