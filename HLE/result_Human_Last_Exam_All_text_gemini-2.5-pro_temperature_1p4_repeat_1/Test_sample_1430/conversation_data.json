    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X = Sym¹⁵(C), where C is a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the objects and the goal**\n\n*   **C:** A smooth projective algebraic curve of genus g = 3 over the complex numbers.\n*   **X = Sym¹⁵(C):** The 15th symmetric power of C. This is a smooth projective variety of dimension n = 15. It parameterizes effective divisors of degree 15 on C.\n*   **Néron-Severi Group NS(X):** The group of algebraic equivalence classes of divisors on X. It is a finitely generated abelian group.\n*   **Rank of NS(X):** The rank of NS(X) as a free abelian group, also known as the Picard number, denoted by ρ(X).\n\nOur goal is to find the minimum and maximum possible values of ρ(X) as C varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Picard number of Symⁿ(C) to the Jacobian of C**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is a fundamental result concerning the cohomology and the Néron-Severi group of symmetric powers of a curve. Let J(C) be the Jacobian of C, which is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension g = 3.\n\nFor a smooth curve C of genus g, and its n-th symmetric power Symⁿ(C), there is a standard decomposition of its Néron-Severi group, provided n is sufficiently large. A theorem by Ciliberto and van der Geer states that for n ≥ 2g - 1, there is an isomorphism of Q-vector spaces:\n\nNS(Symⁿ(C)) ⊗ Q ≅ Q[L] ⊕ u*(NS(J(C)) ⊗ Q)\n\nHere:\n*   L is the class of the divisor on Symⁿ(C) consisting of divisors containing a fixed point of C. This class generates an ample line bundle.\n*   u* is the pullback map induced by the Abel-Jacobi map u: Symⁿ(C) → J(C).\n\nTaking the dimension of these Q-vector spaces gives a formula for the Picard numbers:\nρ(Symⁿ(C)) = 1 + ρ(J(C))\n\nIn our case, g = 3 and n = 15. The condition n ≥ 2g - 1 becomes 15 ≥ 2(3) - 1, which is 15 ≥ 5. The condition is satisfied, so the formula holds for any genus 3 curve C.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values of ρ(J(C)), the Picard number of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n**Step 3: Finding the smallest possible rank of NS(J(C))**\n\nThe Picard number of a projective variety is always at least 1, because the class of a hyperplane section is a non-trivial element. For an abelian variety A, ρ(A) ≥ 1, with the class of the principal polarization being a canonical element.\n\nThe rank ρ(J(C)) is related to the endomorphism algebra of J(C). Specifically, ρ(J(C)) is the dimension of the Q-vector space of endomorphisms in End⁰(J(C)) = End(J(C)) ⊗ Q that are fixed by the Rosati involution associated with the principal polarization.\n\nFor a **generic** curve C of genus 3, its Jacobian J(C) is a simple abelian variety (it has no non-trivial abelian subvarieties) and its ring of endomorphisms is as small as possible: End(J(C)) ≅ Z.\n\nIn this case, End⁰(J(C)) ≅ Q. The Rosati involution on Q is the identity. The space of fixed elements is Q itself.\nTherefore, for a generic curve C:\nρ(J(C)) = dim_Q(Q) = 1.\n\nThis is the minimum possible value for ρ(J(C)).\n\nSo, the smallest possible rank of NS(X) is:\nρ_min(X) = 1 + ρ_min(J(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n**Step 4: Finding the largest possible rank of NS(J(C))**\n\nThe Picard number of an abelian variety A of dimension g is bounded by ρ(A) ≤ g². So for J(C), which has dimension g = 3, we have ρ(J(C)) ≤ 3² = 9.\n\nThe maximum value is achieved when the abelian variety has a large endomorphism algebra, a situation known as Complex Multiplication (CM). The maximum ρ(A) = g² is attained if and only if A is isogenous to a product of g copies of a CM elliptic curve, i.e., A ~ Eᵍ for an elliptic curve E with CM.\n\nWe need to determine if there exists a genus 3 curve C whose Jacobian J(C) achieves this maximum. A well-known example is the **Fermat quartic curve**:\nC: x⁴ + y⁴ + z⁴ = 0\n\nThis is a smooth plane curve of degree 4, so its genus is g = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3.\n\nThe Jacobian of the Fermat quartic, J(C), is known to be isogenous to the product of three copies of the elliptic curve E given by y² = x³ - x. This elliptic curve E has CM by the ring of Gaussian integers, Z[i]. So, J(C) is isogenous to E³.\n\nLet's compute ρ(J(C)) for this curve.\n*   A = J(C) is isogenous to E³.\n*   End⁰(A) = End⁰(E³) ≅ M₃(End⁰(E)) = M₃(Q(i)).\n*   The principal polarization on J(C) induces a Rosati involution on M₃(Q(i)). After a suitable change of basis, this involution is the conjugate transpose map: X ↦ X*ᵀ, where * denotes complex conjugation on the entries in Q(i).\n*   The rank ρ(A) is the dimension over Q of the space of Hermitian matrices in M₃(Q(i)):\n    {X ∈ M₃(Q(i)) | X = X*ᵀ}\n*   A 3x3 matrix H = (h_jk) over Q(i) is Hermitian if h_jk = conj(h_kj).\n    *   The 3 diagonal entries (h_jj) must be \"real\", i.e., lie in Q. This contributes 3 dimensions.\n    *   The 3 upper-triangular entries (h₁₂, h₁₃, h₂₃) can be any element in Q(i). Since Q(i) is a 2-dimensional vector space over Q, these 3 entries contribute 3 × 2 = 6 dimensions.\n    *   The lower-triangular entries are determined by the upper-triangular ones.\n*   The total dimension over Q is 3 + 6 = 9.\n*   Thus, for the Fermat quartic curve, ρ(J(C)) = 9.\n\nThis is the maximum possible value for ρ(J(C)).\n\nSo, the largest possible rank of NS(X) is:\nρ_max(X) = 1 + ρ_max(J(C)) = 1 + 9 = 10.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The smallest possible rank of NS(X) is 2, achieved when C is a generic curve of genus 3.\n*   The largest possible rank of NS(X) is 10, achieved when C is the Fermat quartic curve (or another curve whose Jacobian is isogenous to the cube of a CM elliptic curve)."
