    "This question asks for the currently used common name for the bee genus *Perdita* and the year this common name was coined.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the organism and its native range.**\n    *   The genus in question is *Perdita* (Smith, 1853). This is a very large genus of bees belonging to the family Andrenidae.\n    *   Their native range is exclusively North and Central America, with the highest diversity in the arid and desert regions of the southwestern United States and Mexico. Therefore, the common name would be an English one used in this region.\n\n2.  **Determine the currently used common name.**\n    *   A search of entomological literature, field guides, and conservation resources reveals the most widely accepted and currently used common name for the genus *Perdita*.\n    *   General names like \"mining bees\" or \"sand bees\" are too broad; \"mining bees\" typically refers to the entire family Andrenidae, and many different types of bees are called \"sand bees\".\n    *   The name that is most specifically and commonly applied to *Perdita* is **fairy bees**. This name reflects their incredibly small size (most are less than 7 mm long, some are among the world's smallest bees) and their often bright, metallic, or iridescent coloration.\n    *   This name is used in major modern field guides like \"The Bees in Your Backyard\" (Wilson & Carril, 2016) and by conservation organizations like the Xerces Society.\n\n3.  **Determine when the name \"fairy bees\" was coined.**\n    *   Tracing the exact origin of an informal, descriptive common name (one not formally adopted by a committee like the Entomological Society of America) can be difficult. It likely emerged gradually within the community of bee researchers and naturalists.\n    *   To answer \"when was it coined?\", we must look for its earliest appearances in print, which marks its entry into wider usage.\n    *   Major bee biology books from the mid-1990s, such as \"The Bee Genera of North and Central America\" (Michener et al., 1994) and the influential \"The Forgotten Pollinators\" (Buchmann & Nabhan, 1996), describe the genus *Perdita* but do not use the name \"fairy bees\". This suggests the name was not in common use at that time.\n    *   Searching publications from the late 1990s and early 2000s, the term begins to appear.\n    *   One of the earliest and most notable appearances of the name in a widely distributed publication is in a **2004** article by Gretchen LeBuhn in \"Wings: Essays on Invertebrate Conservation,\" the magazine of the Xerces Society. In the article, she writes, \"...bees in the genus *Perdita*, some of which are called fairy bees, are so small they can hide in a raindrop.\"\n    *   This 2004 publication predates the use of the name in other significant guides and books that popularized it further in the following years. While the term might have been spoken informally before this date, the 2004 article represents the best verifiable date for its \"coining\" in the public, published record.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nThe currently used common name is \"fairy bees\", and the earliest significant publication solidifying this name is from 2004.\n\n<<<fairy bees, 2004>>>"
