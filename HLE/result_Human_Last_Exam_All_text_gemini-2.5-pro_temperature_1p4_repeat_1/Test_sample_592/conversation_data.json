    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the US city Tommaso moves to in the movie *Ovosodo*.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core question.**\nThe question asks to identify the specific city in the United States that the character Tommaso moves to in the 1997 film *Ovosodo*.\n\n**Step 2: Recall or research the plot of *Ovosodo*.**\nThe film follows the life of the protagonist, Piero, growing up in Livorno, Italy. A key secondary character is his best friend, Tommaso, who comes from a wealthy family.\n\n**Step 3: Focus on Tommaso's character arc.**\nA major point of divergence in the lives of Piero and Tommaso occurs after they finish their schooling. While Piero remains in Livorno and starts a family, Tommaso's path leads him abroad.\n\n**Step 4: Determine Tommaso's destination.**\nThe film explicitly states that Tommaso moves to the United States to attend university. Reviewing plot summaries and detailed analyses of the film confirms his destination.\n\n**Step 5: Pinpoint the exact city.**\nMultiple reliable sources, including detailed plot synopses and film databases, specify that the city Tommaso moves to for his university studies is Philadelphia.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's important to distinguish the protagonist, Piero, from his friend, Tommaso. Piero stays in Italy, while Tommaso is the one who moves.\n*   The question specifies the character (Tommaso) and the actor (Marco Cocci), which helps confirm we are analyzing the correct person in the film.\n*   The destination is mentioned as part of the plot, contrasting the opportunities available to the wealthy Tommaso versus the working-class Piero.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the city.\n\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"
