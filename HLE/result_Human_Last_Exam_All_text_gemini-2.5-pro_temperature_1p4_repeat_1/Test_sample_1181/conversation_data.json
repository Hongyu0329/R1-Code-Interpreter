    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question:**\n*   **Film:** *Solaris* (1972), directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. It's important to focus specifically on this adaptation, as dialogues can differ from the original novel by Stanis≈Çaw Lem or the 2002 remake.\n*   **Action/Emotion:** A character is \"ashamed\" to miss something. This points to a specific confession or moment of vulnerability, not just a general feeling of homesickness.\n*   **Specific Object of Nostalgia:** The \"sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This is a very poetic and sensory detail, characteristic of Tarkovsky's style.\n*   **Task:** Identify which of the listed characters expresses this specific sentiment.\n\n**2. Analyze the Characters and their Roles:**\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist. He is deeply connected to Earth, especially his dacha (country house), which is shown extensively in the film's opening and in his memories. He certainly misses Earth, but the question is whether he is the one who vocalizes being *ashamed* of missing the sound of leaves. His primary shame and guilt are centered on his deceased wife, Hari.\n*   **B. Hari:** She is a \"guest\" or \"visitor,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memories created by the sentient ocean of Solaris. She has no authentic memories of Earth herself, so she could not miss it in this way.\n*   **C. Dr. Snaut:** One of the two scientists Kris meets on the station. He is cynical, weary, and has been in space for a long time. He often serves as a philosophical voice, explaining the strange situation to Kris and reflecting on humanity's purpose and limitations. A confession of this nature, revealing a hidden, \"unscientific\" sentimentality, would fit his world-weary character.\n*   **D. Dr. Sartorius:** The other scientist on the station. He is cold, rational, and almost militantly scientific. He views the \"guests\" as objects of study and shows disdain for emotional responses. It would be highly out of character for him to admit to such a poetic longing, let alone feel ashamed of it.\n*   **E. Gibarian:** The scientist who committed suicide before Kris's arrival. We only see him through a video recording he left for Kris. While he was clearly tormented, his message is primarily a warning. The specific line about rustling leaves is not in his message.\n\n**3. Locate the Scene and Dialogue:**\n*   The key conversation takes place in the space station's library between Kris Kelvin and Dr. Snaut.\n*   Snaut delivers a long, philosophical monologue about humanity's true motivations for space exploration. He argues that humans don't seek contact with alien life, but rather a mirror for themselves, a way to \"extend the Earth to the borders of the cosmos.\"\n*   During this speech, he has a moment of candid confession. He says that after all their grand ambitions, what they truly miss are the simple things from Earth. He prefaces this confession by saying he is ashamed to admit it, as it's not a sentiment befitting a cosmonaut. He then explicitly mentions missing things like the rustle of leaves.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n*   Based on the specific dialogue from the film, it is Dr. Snaut who expresses shame at missing the simple, earthly sound of rustling leaves. This admission is a key moment that reveals the emotional toll of their mission and the deep-seated human need for connection to their home world, a core theme of Tarkovsky's film.\n\n<<<C>>>"
