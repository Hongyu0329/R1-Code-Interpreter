    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks for a specific anatomical detail about the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*: the number of depressions found within a feature called the lacrimal recess.\n\n2.  **Define the Key Terms:**\n    *   ***Irritator challengeri***: A species of spinosaurid theropod dinosaur. The primary fossil evidence for this species is a nearly complete skull (holotype specimen SMNS 58022).\n    *   **Lacrimal:** A bone in the skull that is located between the nasal bone and the jugal bone, forming the front border of the eye socket (orbit).\n    *   **Recess / Depression:** A hollow, pit, or indentation on the surface of a bone. In paleontology, these features are often associated with air sacs (pneumatization) or muscle attachments.\n\n3.  **Locate the Authoritative Scientific Source:** To answer a question this specific, we must consult the primary scientific literature that describes the anatomy of the *Irritator challengeri* skull. The most comprehensive and widely cited description is the 2002 paper by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David M. Martill, and Diane M. Scott, titled \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil.\" This paper provides a detailed re-examination of the holotype skull.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Description of the Lacrimal Bone in the Source:**\n    *   Within the Sues et al. (2002) paper, the authors provide a detailed breakdown of each bone in the skull. We need to find the section describing the lacrimal bone.\n    *   On page 537 of the paper, the authors describe the lateral (outer) surface of the lacrimal bone.\n    *   The crucial sentence is: \"The lateral surface of the lacrimal bears an extensive, triangular lacrimal recess, which is subdivided by a low, oblique ridge into a smaller anterodorsal and a larger posteroventral depression.\"\n\n5.  **Interpret the Scientific Description:**\n    *   The description explicitly states that there is a large feature called the \"lacrimal recess\".\n    *   This recess is not a single, simple hollow. It is \"subdivided\" by a ridge.\n    *   The subdivision creates two distinct smaller depressions within the larger recess. These are identified by their position: one is \"anterodorsal\" (forward and up) and the other is \"posteroventral\" (backward and down).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the most detailed anatomical description available in the scientific literature, the single large lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri* contains two smaller, distinct depressions.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the primary scientific description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull, the lacrimal recess contains two depressions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
