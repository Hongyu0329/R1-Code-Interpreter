    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A philosopher.\n    *   **Affiliation:** Belonging to the \"Lviv-Warsaw School\".\n    *   **Specific Contribution:** Decomposing the notion of a \"hallmark\" (or a similar concept like \"sign\" or \"mark\").\n    *   **The Components of the Decomposition:** \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   This was a highly influential school of Polish philosophy and logic active in the 20th century.\n    *   Key figures include its founder Kazimierz Twardowski, and his students such as Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Alfred Tarski, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n    *   The school was known for its emphasis on clarity, logical analysis, and the philosophy of science and language. The question is likely pointing to a philosopher who worked on semiotics (the theory of signs) or the philosophy of language.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Key Concepts: \"Hallmark\", \"Symptom\", and \"Signal\":**\n    *   **Hallmark/Sign:** This is the general category of something that stands for or indicates something else.\n    *   **Symptom:** This is generally understood as a *natural* sign. There is a causal or correlational link between the symptom and what it signifies. For example, dark clouds are a symptom of impending rain. The sign is an *indication* or *evidence* of a state of affairs.\n    *   **Signal:** This is generally understood as an *artificial* or *conventional* sign. It is produced intentionally by a sender to communicate a message and influence a receiver. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop. The sign is created for *communication*.\n    *   The question asks which philosopher made this specific distinction central to their work.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Philosophers of the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   **Tadeusz Kotarbiński:** Known for \"reism\" (or concretism) and \"praxiology\" (the theory of efficient action). While praxiology deals with actions, this specific semiotic distinction is not his most famous contribution.\n    *   **Alfred Tarski:** A giant of mathematical logic, famous for his semantic theory of truth. His work deals with meaning and reference but not primarily with this pragmatic distinction between types of signs.\n    *   **Jan Łukasiewicz:** A logician famous for many-valued logic and \"Polish notation\". His focus was on formal logic systems.\n    *   **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz:** This is the most promising candidate. Ajdukiewicz was a leading figure in the philosophy of language, epistemology, and logic. He developed a detailed theory of meaning and language, which he approached from a pragmatic perspective.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint Ajdukiewicz's Contribution:**\n    *   Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, particularly in his work *Pragmatic Logic* (*Logika pragmatyczna*), developed a comprehensive theory of signs.\n    *   He explicitly decomposes the general notion of a sign (*znak*) into several categories based on function.\n    *   His primary distinction is between **symptoms** (*oznaki* or *symptomy*) and **signals** (*sygnały*).\n        *   He defines a **symptom** as a phenomenon that reliably accompanies another phenomenon, allowing one to infer the latter from the former (e.g., smoke as a symptom of fire). This is an indicative relationship.\n        *   He defines a **signal** as something produced by a sender with the intention of causing a certain reaction in a receiver (e.g., uttering a command, a traffic light). This is a communicative, intentional relationship.\n    *   This distinction is fundamental to his analysis of language, where words function as signals within a communication system, a key idea in his pragmatic approach. The term \"hallmark\" (*cecha*) is the general concept of a characteristic or mark that his analysis clarifies by decomposing it into these functional types.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Translation:** The original Polish terms are important. Ajdukiewicz used *oznaka* (mark, indication, symptom) and *sygnał* (signal). \"Hallmark\" is a good English equivalent for the general concept of a distinguishing mark (*cecha*) that is being analyzed.\n*   **Context:** This distinction is not merely a casual observation but a cornerstone of Ajdukiewicz's semiotic theory and his pragmatic philosophy of language.\n*   **School:** It is crucial to correctly place Ajdukiewicz within the Lviv-Warsaw School, of which he was a prominent second-generation member.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who made the distinction between symptoms and signals as types of signs or hallmarks is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
