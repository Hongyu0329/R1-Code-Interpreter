    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Problem:**\n    We are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    *   `X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    *   `H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    We need to find the 4-point DFT of a new 8-point sequence, `y(n)`, which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n    *   `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n\n2.  **Interpret \"4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence\":**\n    Taking an `N`-point DFT of a sequence with length `M > N` (here `N=4`, `M=8`) implies time-domain aliasing. The 8-point sequence `y(n)` is first aliased into a 4-point sequence, let's call it `y'(n)`, and then the 4-point DFT is computed.\n    The aliasing formula is `y'(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    So, the sequence for which we need to find the DFT is:\n    *   `y'(0) = y(0) + y(4) = x(0) + x(2)`\n    *   `y'(1) = y(1) + y(5) = h(0) + h(2)`\n    *   `y'(2) = y(2) + y(6) = x(1) + x(3)`\n    *   `y'(3) = y(3) + y(7) = h(1) + h(3)`\n\n3.  **Relate the desired DFT to the DFT of the original sequence `y(n)`:**\n    A key property of the DFT (related to the decimation-in-frequency FFT algorithm) states that the DFT of the time-aliased sequence `y'(n)` is equal to the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`.\n    Let `Y_8(k)` be the 8-point DFT of the 8-point sequence `y(n)`.\n    Let `Y'_4(k)` be the 4-point DFT of the 4-point aliased sequence `y'(n)`.\n    Then, the relationship is: `Y'_4(k) = Y_8(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    So, our goal is to compute `Y_8(0)`, `Y_8(2)`, `Y_8(4)`, and `Y_8(6)`.\n\n4.  **Find the 8-point DFT of the interleaved sequence `y(n)`:**\n    The interleaved sequence `y(n)` can be expressed as the sum of two sequences:\n    *   An up-sampled version of `x(n)`: `x_up(n) = {x(0), 0, x(1), 0, x(2), 0, x(3), 0}`\n    *   A shifted, up-sampled version of `h(n)`: `h_upshift(n) = {0, h(0), 0, h(1), 0, h(2), 0, h(3)}`\n    The 8-point DFT of `y(n)`, denoted `Y_8(k)`, is the sum of the DFTs of these two sequences due to linearity.\n    *   The 8-point DFT of `x_up(n)` is `X(k mod 4)`.\n    *   The 8-point DFT of `h_upshift(n)` is `W_8^{-k} * H(k mod 4)`, where `W_8 = e^{-j2\\pi/8}` is the twiddle factor.\n    Therefore, the 8-point DFT of `y(n)` is:\n    `Y_8(k) = X(k \\mod 4) + W_8^{-k} H(k \\mod 4)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the required DFT samples:**\n    We need `Y_8(0)`, `Y_8(2)`, `Y_8(4)`, and `Y_8(6)`. Let's calculate them one by one.\n\n    *   **For k=0:** `Y'_4(0) = Y_8(0)`\n        `Y_8(0) = X(0 \\mod 4) + W_8^0 H(0 \\mod 4)`\n        `Y_8(0) = X(0) + 1 * H(0)`\n        `Y_8(0) = 1 + 0 = 1`\n\n    *   **For k=1:** `Y'_4(1) = Y_8(2)`\n        `Y_8(2) = X(2 \\mod 4) + W_8^{-2} H(2 \\mod 4)`\n        `Y_8(2) = X(2) + W_8^{-2} H(2)`\n        The twiddle factor `W_8^{-2} = e^{-j2\\pi(2)/8} = e^{-j\\pi/2} = -j`.\n        `Y_8(2) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j`\n\n    *   **For k=2:** `Y'_4(2) = Y_8(4)`\n        `Y_8(4) = X(4 \\mod 4) + W_8^{-4} H(4 \\mod 4)`\n        `Y_8(4) = X(0) + W_8^{-4} H(0)`\n        The twiddle factor `W_8^{-4} = e^{-j2\\pi(4)/8} = e^{-j\\pi} = -1`.\n        `Y_8(4) = 1 + (-1) * 0 = 1`\n\n    *   **For k=3:** `Y'_4(3) = Y_8(6)`\n        `Y_8(6) = X(6 \\mod 4) + W_8^{-6} H(6 \\mod 4)`\n        `Y_8(6) = X(2) + W_8^{-6} H(2)`\n        The twiddle factor `W_8^{-6} = e^{-j2\\pi(6)/8} = e^{-j3\\pi/2} = j`.\n        `Y_8(6) = -1 + (j) * 1 = -1 + j`\n\n6.  **Assemble the final answer:**\n    The resulting 4-point DFT is the collection of these calculated values:\n    `Y'_4(k) = {Y'_4(0), Y'_4(1), Y'_4(2), Y'_4(3)}`\n    `Y'_4(k) = {1, -1-j, 1, -1+j}`\n\n### Careful Points\n*   Correctly interpreting what \"4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence\" means. It implies time-domain aliasing.\n*   Knowing the DFT property that relates the DFT of the aliased sequence to the samples of the DFT of the original longer sequence (`Y'_4(k) = Y_8(2k)`).\n*   Knowing the formula for the DFT of an interleaved sequence (`Y_8(k) = X(k \\mod 4) + W_8^{-k} H(k \\mod 4)`).\n*   Careful calculation of the twiddle factors (`W_8^{-2}`, `W_8^{-4}`, `W_8^{-6}`).\n*   Using the correct values from the given `X(k)` and `H(k)` vectors for the corresponding indices. Note that we only needed `X(0), X(2), H(0), H(2)`.\n\nThe final answer is the 4-point sequence derived from the calculations.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
