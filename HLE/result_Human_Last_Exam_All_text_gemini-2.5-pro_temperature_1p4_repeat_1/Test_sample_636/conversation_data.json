    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a 2x2 state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` has its eigenvalues at the specified locations `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**Careful points:**\n*   The system is a multi-input system (matrix `B` has two columns), and the state feedback gain `F` will be a 2x2 matrix. Let's denote it as `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`.\n*   The closed-loop matrix is given as `A + BF`, not the more common `A - BF`. We must use the specified formula.\n*   For multi-input systems, the solution for `F` is generally not unique. We have more degrees of freedom (the four elements of `F`) than constraints (placing two eigenvalues).\n\n**Step 2: Check for Controllability**\nBefore designing a controller, we must verify if the system is controllable. A system is controllable if we can move its poles to any desired location. Controllability is checked by examining the rank of the controllability matrix `C = [B, AB]`. The system is controllable if `rank(C)` is equal to the number of states (which is 2 in this case).\n\n*   Matrices `A` and `B` are given as:\n    `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`, `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n*   Calculate the product `AB`:\n    `AB = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] * [[1, 2], [1, 0]] = [[(-1*1 + 1*1), (-1*2 + 1*0)], [(1*1 + 0*1), (1*2 + 0*0)]] = [[0, -2], [1, 2]]`\n*   Form the controllability matrix `C`:\n    `C = [B, AB] = [[1, 2, 0, -2], [1, 0, 1, 2]]`\n*   Calculate the rank of `C`. We can check the rank by looking at a 2x2 submatrix. Let's take the first two columns, which is the matrix `B` itself.\n    `det(B) = det([[1, 2], [1, 0]]) = (1*0) - (2*1) = -2`\n*   Since `det(B) ≠ 0`, `B` has full rank (rank 2). Therefore, the rank of `C` is 2.\n*   The system is controllable, so a state feedback gain `F` that places the poles at the desired locations exists.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe desired closed-loop eigenvalues are `p1 = -1 + j` and `p2 = -1 - j`. The desired characteristic polynomial `p_d(s)` is formed from these roots:\n`p_d(s) = (s - p1)(s - p2)`\n`p_d(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))`\n`p_d(s) = ((s + 1) - j)((s + 1) + j)`\n`p_d(s) = (s + 1)^2 - j^2 = s^2 + 2s + 1 - (-1)`\n`p_d(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Characteristic Polynomial of the Closed-Loop System**\nThe closed-loop system matrix is `A_cl = A + BF`.\n*   First, calculate `BF`:\n    `BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n*   Next, calculate `A_cl = A + BF`:\n    `A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]] = [[-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n*   The characteristic polynomial of a 2x2 matrix `M` is `s^2 - tr(M)s + det(M)`.\n    `tr(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3) + f2 = f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1`\n    `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3)(f2) - (1 + f2 + 2*f4)(1 + f1)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f4 + 2*f1*f4)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4`\n*   The characteristic polynomial `p_cl(s)` is:\n    `p_cl(s) = s^2 - (f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1)s + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4)`\n\n**Step 5: Equate the Polynomials and Solve for F**\nWe match the coefficients of `p_cl(s)` with `p_d(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`.\n*   **Coefficient of s:**\n    `-(f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1) = 2`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1 = -2`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2*f3 = -1`  (Equation 1)\n*   **Constant term:**\n    `-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 2`\n    `f1 + 2*f2 - 2*f2*f3 + 2*f4 + 2*f1*f4 = -3`  (Equation 2)\n\nWe have a system of two equations with four unknowns. This confirms that the solution is not unique. We can find a particular solution by making simplifying assumptions. A common approach is to set some elements of `F` to zero.\nLet's assume the second input is not used, which means the second row of `F` is zero.\nLet `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`.\n\n*   The equations become:\n    1.  `f1 + f2 + 2(0) = -1` => `f1 + f2 = -1`\n    2.  `f1 + 2*f2 - 2*f2(0) + 2(0) + 2*f1(0) = -3` => `f1 + 2*f2 = -3`\n*   Now we solve this simple 2x2 system:\n    Subtracting the first equation from the second:\n    `(f1 + 2*f2) - (f1 + f2) = -3 - (-1)`\n    `f2 = -2`\n*   Substitute `f2 = -2` back into the first equation:\n    `f1 + (-2) = -1`\n    `f1 = 1`\n*   So, a valid gain matrix is `f1=1, f2=-2, f3=0, f4=0`.\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer**\nThe calculated state feedback gain matrix is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\nWe can quickly verify this result. With this `F`, `A_cl = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`. The characteristic equation is `det(sI - A_cl) = s(s+2) - (-1)(2) = s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`, which has roots `-1 ± j`. The solution is correct.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
