    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of the given hypothesis class.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem and Definitions\n\n*   **Domain:** We have an input space $X$ with a finite size $|X| = T$.\n*   **Hypothesis Class:** The class $H_{z-ones}$ consists of all functions (hypotheses) $h: X \\to \\{0,1\\}$ such that the number of inputs mapped to 1 is exactly $z$.\n    *   Formally, $H_{z-ones} = \\{h:X \\to \\{0,1\\} \\mid |\\{x \\in X : h(x)=1\\}|=z\\}$.\n    *   For this class to be non-empty, we must have $z \\le T$. We will assume this is the case.\n*   **VC Dimension:** The VC dimension of a hypothesis class $H$ is the size $d$ of the largest set of points $S \\subseteq X$ that can be *shattered* by $H$.\n*   **Shattering:** A set $S$ is shattered by $H$ if for every possible binary labeling of the points in $S$, there exists a hypothesis $h \\in H$ that produces this labeling. The number of possible labelings for a set of size $d$ is $2^d$.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nOur goal is to find the largest integer $d$ for which we can find a set $S \\subseteq X$ with $|S|=d$ that is shattered by $H_{z-ones}$. We will establish a lower bound and an upper bound for the VC dimension.\n\n#### **Analyzing the Shattering Condition**\n\nLet's pick an arbitrary subset $S \\subseteq X$ with $|S| = d$. To shatter $S$, we must be able to realize any of the $2^d$ possible labelings on $S$.\n\nConsider an arbitrary labeling for the points in $S$. Let this labeling assign '1' to a subset $S_1 \\subseteq S$ and '0' to the points in $S_0 = S \\setminus S_1$. Let the number of points labeled '1' be $k = |S_1|$, where $k$ can be any integer from $0$ to $d$.\n\nFor this labeling to be realized by a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$, two things must happen:\n1.  $h(x)=1$ for all $x \\in S_1$.\n2.  $h(x)=0$ for all $x \\in S_0$.\n3.  The global constraint for $h$ must be met: $|\\{x \\in X : h(x)=1\\}| = z$.\n\nFrom points 1 and 2, we have already accounted for $k$ points that are labeled '1'. To satisfy the global constraint (point 3), we must label exactly $z-k$ additional points as '1'. These points must be chosen from the complement set $X \\setminus S$. The remaining points in $X \\setminus S$ will be labeled '0'.\n\nThis procedure is only possible if we can actually choose $z-k$ points from the set $X \\setminus S$. This leads to two fundamental constraints:\n*   **Constraint A:** The number of points we need to choose, $z-k$, must be non-negative. So, $z-k \\ge 0 \\implies k \\le z$.\n*   **Constraint B:** The number of points we need to choose, $z-k$, cannot exceed the number of available points in the complement set. The size of the complement set is $|X \\setminus S| = T-d$. So, $z-k \\le T-d$.\n\nFor the set $S$ of size $d$ to be shattered, these two constraints must hold for **every possible value of $k$** in $\\{0, 1, 2, ..., d\\}$.\n\n#### **Establishing a Lower Bound (Finding a $d$ that works)**\n\nLet's find the maximum value of $d$ for which Constraints A and B hold for all $k \\in \\{0, ..., d\\}$.\n*   For Constraint A ($k \\le z$) to hold for all $k \\in \\{0, ..., d\\}$, it must hold for the largest possible value of $k$, which is $d$. This gives us our first condition: **$d \\le z$**.\n*   For Constraint B ($z-k \\le T-d$) to hold for all $k \\in \\{0, ..., d\\}$, it must hold for the value of $k$ that makes the left side ($z-k$) largest. This occurs when $k$ is smallest, i.e., $k=0$. This gives us our second condition: $z-0 \\le T-d \\implies z \\le T-d \\implies **d \\le T-z$**.\n\nSo, we can shatter any set of size $d$ as long as both conditions are met: $d \\le z$ and $d \\le T-z$. This is equivalent to saying $d \\le \\min(z, T-z)$.\nThis means the VC dimension must be at least $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n$VC(H_{z-ones}) \\ge \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n#### **Establishing an Upper Bound (Showing $d+1$ fails)**\n\nNow, let's show that we cannot shatter *any* set of size $d' = \\min(z, T-z) + 1$. Let $S$ be an arbitrary set with $|S|=d'$. We need to find just one labeling of $S$ that no hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$ can realize.\n\nWe consider two cases based on the value of $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $z \\le T-z$**\n    In this case, $\\min(z, T-z) = z$. We want to show that we cannot shatter any set $S$ of size $d' = z+1$.\n    Let's consider the \"all-ones\" labeling for $S$, where every point in $S$ is labeled '1'. For this labeling, the number of ones is $k = |S| = z+1$.\n    To realize this labeling, according to our analysis, we must satisfy Constraint A: $k \\le z$.\n    But here, $k = z+1$, so $z+1 \\le z$, which is false.\n    Intuitively, any hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$ can only label $z$ points as '1' in total. It is therefore impossible to label the $z+1$ points of $S$ as '1'. So, the all-ones labeling cannot be realized, and $S$ cannot be shattered.\n    Thus, if $z \\le T-z$, the VC dimension is at most $z$.\n\n*   **Case 2: $z > T-z$**\n    In this case, $\\min(z, T-z) = T-z$. We want to show we cannot shatter any set $S$ of size $d' = (T-z)+1$.\n    Let's consider the \"all-zeros\" labeling for $S$, where every point in $S$ is labeled '0'. For this labeling, the number of ones is $k=0$.\n    To realize this labeling, according to our analysis, we must satisfy Constraint B: $z-k \\le T-|S|$.\n    Substituting $k=0$ and $|S|=T-z+1$:\n    $z - 0 \\le T - (T-z+1)$\n    $z \\le T - T + z - 1$\n    $z \\le z-1$\n    This is false.\n    Intuitively, to realize the all-zeros labeling on $S$, a hypothesis must label all $z$ of its required '1's from the complement set $X \\setminus S$. The size of this complement set is $|X \\setminus S| = T - |S| = T - (T-z+1) = z-1$. It is impossible to choose $z$ points from a set of size $z-1$. So, the all-zeros labeling cannot be realized, and $S$ cannot be shattered.\n    Thus, if $z > T-z$, the VC dimension is at most $T-z$.\n\nCombining these two cases, the VC dimension can be no more than $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n$VC(H_{z-ones}) \\le \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nWe have shown from our analysis that:\n1.  $VC(H_{z-ones}) \\ge \\min(z, T-z)$\n2.  $VC(H_{z-ones}) \\le \\min(z, T-z)$\n\nTherefore, the VC dimension of the class $H_{z-ones}$ is exactly $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n**Careful Points Summary:**\n*   The core of the problem is translating the global constraint (exactly $z$ ones in $X$) to a local shattering problem on a subset $S$.\n*   The key insight is that a labeling on $S$ with $k$ ones is realizable if and only if one can pick the remaining $z-k$ ones from the $T-d$ points outside of $S$.\n*   A complete proof requires showing both a lower bound (a set of size $d=\\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered) and an upper bound (no set of size $d+1$ can be shattered).\n*   The upper bound proof requires checking specific \"hard\" labelings (all-ones or all-zeros) depending on which term, $z$ or $T-z$, is smaller.\n\n<<<\\min(z, T-z)>>>"
