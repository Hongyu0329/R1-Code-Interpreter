To relieve the second patch of its native amino acids and the negatively charged environment, the best replacement would be to mutate all four amino acids from Serine-Glutamate-Glutamate-Aspartate (S-E-E-D) to Alanine-Alanine-Alanine-Alanine (A-A-A-A). This change would simultaneously prevent phosphorylation at position 47 and neutralize the negative charges at positions 48, 49, and 50, thus directly testing the hypothesis that the negative charge of this patch is autoinhibitory.
