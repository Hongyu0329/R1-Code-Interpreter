At sunrise, the table must change its shape from an elongated, linear form (representing the stable *trans*-isomer) to a bent, V-shape form (representing the *cis*-isomer). At sunset, it must reverse this process, changing from the bent *cis* form back to the elongated *trans* form. This mimics the molecule's photoisomerization in response to UV light from the sun and its thermal relaxation back to the stable form in the dark.
