The formula is $Z = \int_{\psi(\beta)=-\psi(0)} \mathcal{D}\bar{\psi} \mathcal{D}\psi \, e^{-S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi]}$, where the Euclidean action is given by $S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi] = \int_0^\beta d\tau \left[ \sum_k \bar{\psi}_k(\tau) \partial_\tau \psi_k(\tau) + H(\{\bar{\psi}_k(\tau)\}, \{\psi_k(\tau)\}) \right]$. Here, the integration measure $\mathcal{D}\bar{\psi} \mathcal{D}\psi$ represents a functional integral over all Grassmann field paths satisfying the anti-periodic boundary condition $\psi_k(\beta) = -\psi_k(0)$. The term $H(\{\bar{\psi}\}, \{\psi\})$ is the normal-ordered Hamiltonian with creation/annihilation operators replaced by Grassmann fields.
