    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** We need to identify two specific individuals.\n    *   **What:** They are Nobel laureates.\n    *   **Where:** They were featured in a commercial for the company Enron.\n    *   **When:** The commercial aired in the year 2000.\n    *   **Key Detail:** The commercial's tagline was \"Ask Why\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Entities and Concepts:**\n    *   **Enron:** An American energy, commodities, and services company that was based in Houston, Texas. It famously filed for bankruptcy in late 2001, revealing a massive and systemic accounting fraud, making it one of the most infamous corporate scandals in U.S. history.\n    *   **\"Ask Why\" Campaign:** This was a real, high-profile advertising campaign launched by Enron in 2000. It was created by the advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather and was intended to rebrand Enron from a simple energy company into a revolutionary, innovative global entity. The tagline is now seen as deeply ironic, as critics and investigators later had to \"ask why\" the company's financials were so deceptive.\n    *   **Nobel Laureates:** Individuals who have been awarded the Nobel Prize, a highly prestigious international award. Their participation would have been intended to lend immense credibility and intellectual authority to Enron's brand.\n\n3.  **Research and Identification:**\n    *   A search for \"Enron Ask Why commercial Nobel\" or similar terms quickly points to a specific TV ad from the campaign.\n    *   The ad featured several prominent thinkers discussing ideas. Among them were two economists who either were or would become Nobel laureates.\n    *   **Individual 1: Paul Krugman.** At the time of the commercial in 2000, he was a well-respected economist and professor at MIT. He was not yet a Nobel laureate. He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his work on new trade theory and economic geography.\n    *   **Individual 2: Myron Scholes.** At the time of the commercial, he was already a Nobel laureate. He, along with Robert C. Merton, was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997 for developing a new method to determine the value of derivatives (the Black-Scholes model).\n\n4.  **List of Careful Points:**\n    *   **Timing of the Nobel Prize:** This is a crucial detail. Myron Scholes was a Nobel laureate *at the time* the commercial was made. Paul Krugman was a prominent economist but won his Nobel Prize eight years *after* the commercial aired and seven years after Enron's collapse. However, the question asks which two \"Nobel laureates were featured,\" which is grammatically correct from our present-day perspective, as both are now laureates.\n    *   **The Irony:** The ad campaign is infamous because of the deep irony. Enron was encouraging the public to \"Ask Why\" and question everything, presenting itself as an engine of new ideas, while simultaneously hiding massive debt and engaging in fraudulent accounting that could not withstand scrutiny.\n    *   **Field of Expertise:** Both individuals are economists. This was fitting for Enron, which was trying to portray itself as a master of modern, complex financial markets and a key player in the \"new economy.\"\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the two individuals featured in the 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial who are Nobel laureates are Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"
