    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for four key things:\n1.  An **earliest known date**.\n2.  It must be **recorded** in writing.\n3.  The record must be from a **pre-Columbian civilization** in the Americas.\n4.  The writing must be in an **aboriginal (native) writing system**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Civilizations with Early Writing and Calendars\nSeveral pre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations developed writing and complex calendrical systems. The primary candidates for the \"earliest\" record are:\n*   **Zapotec:** Centered in the Oaxaca Valley, they had one of the first writing systems in Mesoamerica.\n*   **Olmec and Epi-Olmec:** The \"mother culture\" of Mesoamerica and its successor culture in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec region.\n*   **Maya:** Famous for their highly sophisticated hieroglyphic script and Long Count calendar.\n\n### Step 3: Differentiate Between Types of Dates\nIt is crucial to understand the two main types of dates recorded by these civilizations:\n1.  **Cyclical Dates:** These are dates from the 260-day sacred calendar (Tzolk'in in Mayan). A date like \"1 Earthquake\" or \"7 Deer\" would repeat every 260 days. While it is a specific day, it's not fixed in a long-term, non-repeating timeline without additional information.\n2.  **Long Count Dates:** This system, used by the Maya and Epi-Olmec, pinpoints a unique, non-repeating date within a great cycle of approximately 5,125 years. These are often written as a series of five numbers (e.g., 7.16.3.2.13).\n\nThe question asks for the \"earliest... date recorded,\" which can be fulfilled by either type. The determining factor will be the age of the artifact on which the date is recorded.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Primary Candidates for the Earliest Recorded Date\n\n*   **Candidate 1: The Earliest Long Count Date**\n    *   **Artifact:** Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico.\n    *   **Civilization/Script:** Epi-Olmec or proto-Maya.\n    *   **Date Recorded:** The inscription shows a Long Count date of **7.16.3.2.13**. Using the standard GMT correlation, this corresponds to **December 10, 36 BCE** in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The monument is assumed to be contemporaneous with the date it records. Another famous early Long Count date is on Tres Zapotes Stela C (**32 BCE**), which is slightly later.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: The Earliest Cyclical Date (Recent Maya Discovery)**\n    *   **Artifact:** Painted plaster fragments from the Las Pinturas pyramid at San Bartolo, Guatemala.\n    *   **Civilization/Script:** Maya.\n    *   **Date Recorded:** The glyphs depict the day **\"7 Deer\"**, a date in the 260-day calendar.\n    *   **Dating:** While the date \"7 Deer\" is cyclical, the crucial evidence is the age of the artifact itself. Associated charcoal was securely radiocarbon dated to between **300 and 200 BCE**. This discovery, announced in 2022, established it as the earliest *Maya* calendrical inscription.\n\n*   **Candidate 3: The Earliest Cyclical Date (Zapotec)**\n    *   **Artifact:** Monument 3 from San José Mogote, Oaxaca, Mexico.\n    *   **Civilization/Script:** Zapotec.\n    *   **Date Recorded:** This carved stone slab shows a slain captive. Between his legs are glyphs that are widely interpreted as the calendrical name **\"1 Earthquake\"** (or \"1 Motion\"), a day in the 260-day calendar. In this culture, people were often named for the day they were born.\n    *   **Dating:** The monument was found in an archaeological context that was radiocarbon dated. This places the creation of the monument, and thus the recording of the date, at approximately **600 BCE**.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nComparing the candidates, the timeline is as follows:\n*   **c. 600 BCE:** The Zapotecs record the date \"1 Earthquake\" on a stone monument at San José Mogote.\n*   **c. 300-200 BCE:** The Maya record the date \"7 Deer\" on plaster at San Bartolo.\n*   **c. 36 BCE:** The Epi-Olmec/proto-Maya record the absolute Long Count date corresponding to 36 BCE on a stela at Chiapa de Corzo.\n\nAlthough the Long Count date of 36 BCE is the earliest *absolute, non-repeating* date, the inscription of \"1 Earthquake\" from San José Mogote is a record of a date made on an artifact that is significantly older. Therefore, the Zapotec inscription represents the earliest known instance of a date being recorded in a native writing system in the Americas.\n\n***\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization is **\"1 Earthquake\"**, a day in the 260-day ritual calendar. This date was written in Zapotec script on **Monument 3 at the site of San José Mogote in Oaxaca, Mexico**. Archaeological evidence dates the carving of this monument to approximately **600 BCE**."
