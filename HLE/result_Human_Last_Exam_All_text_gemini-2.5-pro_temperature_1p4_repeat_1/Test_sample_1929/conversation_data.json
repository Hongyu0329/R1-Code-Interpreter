    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (specifically, 1,3-butadiene). Its structure is CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂. This is a conjugated diene, a molecule with two double bonds separated by one single bond.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. Its structure is CCl₂=CF₂. This is an alkene, which can act as a dienophile (a \"diene-loving\" species).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition, meaning it involves 4 π-electrons from the diene and 2 π-electrons from the dienophile to form a new six-membered ring.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Suitability of the Reactants for a Diels-Alder Reaction\n*   **Diene:** Butadiene is the archetypal diene for this reaction. For the reaction to occur, it must adopt an *s-cis* conformation (where both double bonds are on the same side of the central single bond). Butadiene can easily rotate into this conformation.\n*   **Dienophile:** A good dienophile is typically \"electron-poor,\" meaning its double bond is attached to electron-withdrawing groups. In CCl₂=CF₂, the carbons of the double bond are attached to four highly electronegative halogen atoms (two chlorine and two fluorine atoms). These atoms strongly withdraw electron density, making the double bond electron-deficient and thus making 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene a highly reactive dienophile.\n\n### Step 3: Predict the Product's Connectivity\nThe Diels-Alder reaction is a concerted process, forming a cyclic product.\n1.  Let's number the carbons of butadiene from 1 to 4: C¹H₂=C²H−C³H=C⁴H₂.\n2.  Let's label the carbons of the dienophile: CªCl₂=CᵇF₂.\n3.  Two new single bonds (sigma bonds) are formed: one between C¹ of butadiene and one carbon of the dienophile, and another between C⁴ of butadiene and the other carbon of the dienophile.\n4.  The two π-bonds in butadiene and the one π-bond in the dienophile are broken.\n5.  A new π-bond is formed between C² and C³ of the original butadiene molecule.\n\nThe resulting structure is a six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative). The connectivity will be: -C¹H₂-C²H=C³H-C⁴H₂-CªCl₂-CᵇF₂- closed in a ring.\n\n**Careful Point (Regiochemistry):** The diene (butadiene) is symmetrical, but the dienophile (CCl₂=CF₂) is not. We must consider if C¹ bonds to Cª or Cᵇ.\n*   Path A: C¹ bonds to Cª(Cl₂) and C⁴ bonds to Cᵇ(F₂).\n*   Path B: C¹ bonds to Cᵇ(F₂) and C⁴ bonds to Cª(Cl₂).\nHowever, since butadiene is symmetrical (C¹ is equivalent to C⁴), Path A and Path B produce the exact same molecule. You can see this by rotating the molecule from Path A to get the molecule from Path B. Therefore, only one constitutional isomer is formed as the product.\n\nThe product's structure is a cyclohexene ring where two adjacent carbons (not part of the double bond) bear a -CCl₂ group and a -CF₂ group.\n\n### Step 4: Draw and Name the Product\n1.  **Draw the structure:**\n    We start with a cyclohexene ring. We place the substituents on the saturated carbons adjacent to each other.\n    ```\n            (H)C=C(H)\n           /      \\\n      (H₂)C        C(H₂)\n          |          |\n      (F₂)C--------C(Cl₂)\n    ```\n\n2.  **Name the structure using IUPAC rules:**\n    *   **Parent:** The six-membered ring with one double bond is **cyclohexene**.\n    *   **Numbering:** The ring must be numbered to give the double bond the lowest possible locants, which are always 1 and 2. We have two ways to do this:\n        a) Numbering clockwise so the double bond is C1-C2. This places the substituted carbons at positions 4 and 5.\n        b) Numbering counter-clockwise so the double bond is C1-C2. This also places the substituted carbons at positions 4 and 5.\n    *   **Assigning Locants to Substituents:** Let's choose one direction of numbering. Let's say C1=C2, then C3, C4, C5, C6.\n        *   If the -CCl₂ group is on C4 and the -CF₂ group is on C5, the name would involve **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluoro**.\n        *   If we numbered the other way (or if the molecule was formed with the opposite connectivity, which we established is the same molecule), the -CF₂ group could be on C4 and the -CCl₂ group on C5. The name would involve **5,5-dichloro-4,4-difluoro**.\n    *   **Tie-Breaker Rule:** When numbering gives the same set of locants (here, {4,4,5,5}), we must use alphabetical order to decide. The substituent names are \"dichloro\" and \"difluoro\". Alphabetically, \"chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\". Therefore, the carbon atom with the chlorine atoms should be given the lower number.\n    *   The lower number available is 4. So, the -CCl₂ group is on C4, and the -CF₂ group is on C5.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\nThe reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\nThe product is a cyclohexene ring.\nThe substituents are two chlorine atoms on one carbon and two fluorine atoms on the adjacent carbon.\nBased on IUPAC naming rules, the final product name is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
