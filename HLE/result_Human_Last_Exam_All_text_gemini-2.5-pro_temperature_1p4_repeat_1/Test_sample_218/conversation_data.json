    "Answering this question requires understanding the relationship between the irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_n$ and the partitions of $n$.\n\n### Step 1: Irreducible Representations and Partitions\nThe irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers, $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ where $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k > 0$ and $\\sum \\lambda_i = n$.\nThe problem is to find the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of $n=25$ for which the dimension of the corresponding irrep, denoted $d_\\lambda$, is strictly less than 500,000.\n\n### Step 2: Dimension Formula and Properties\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ can be calculated using the Hook Length Formula:\n$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod h_{ij}}$, where the product is over the hook lengths $h_{ij}$ of all boxes in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$.\n\nA crucial property is that the dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is the same as the dimension of the irrep for its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$. The conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ is obtained by transposing the Young diagram of $\\lambda$.\nIf $\\lambda = \\lambda'$, the partition is called self-conjugate. Otherwise, $\\lambda$ and $\\lambda'$ form a pair of distinct partitions with the same dimension.\nThis means that irreps with dimensions less than 500,000 will either come from a self-conjugate partition or a pair of non-self-conjugate partitions.\n\n### Step 3: Strategy for finding low-dimension irreps\nThe dimensions of irreps are generally smallest for partitions that are \"far from the center,\" meaning partitions with a very large first part, like $(n-k, \\dots)$ for small $k$, or their conjugates (which are partitions with many small parts). We will systematically search for such partitions.\nLet a partition $\\lambda$ of $n=25$ be written in the form $(n-k, \\pi)$, where $\\pi$ is a partition of $k$.\n\n**Case k=0: Partitions of 25 with largest part 25.**\n*   $\\lambda = (25)$. This corresponds to the trivial representation. $d_{(25)} = 1$.\n*   Its conjugate is $\\lambda' = (1^{25})$, the sign representation. $d_{(1^{25})} = 1$.\n    Both are < 500,000. These are distinct. (Count = 2)\n\n**Case k=1: Partitions of 25 with largest part 24.**\n*   $\\lambda = (24,1)$. The dimension is $d_{(n-1,1)} = n-1$. For $n=25$, $d_{(24,1)}=24$.\n*   Its conjugate is $\\lambda' = (2, 1^{23})$. $d_{(2,1^{23})}=24$.\n    Both are < 500,000. These are distinct. (Count = 2)\n\n**Case k=2: Largest part 23.** We check partitions $(23, \\pi)$ where $\\pi$ is a partition of 2.\n*   $\\pi=(2) \\implies \\lambda=(23,2)$. $d_{(23,2)} = \\frac{25 \\times (25-3)}{2} = \\frac{25 \\times 22}{2} = 275$.\n*   $\\pi=(1,1) \\implies \\lambda=(23,1,1)$. $d_{(23,1,1)} = \\binom{25-1}{2} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$.\n    Both dimensions are < 500,000. Their conjugates, $(2,2,1^{21})$ and $(3,1^{22})$, also have the same dimensions. All four are distinct. (Count = 4)\n\n**Case k=3: Largest part 22.** Partitions are of the form $(22, \\pi)$ for $\\pi$ a partition of 3.\n*   $\\pi=(3) \\implies \\lambda=(22,3)$, $d=2,000$.\n*   $\\pi=(2,1) \\implies \\lambda=(22,2,1)$, $d=4,025$.\n*   $\\pi=(1,1,1) \\implies \\lambda=(22,1,1,1)$, $d=\\binom{24}{3}=2,024$.\n    All three dimensions are < 500,000. This gives 3 partitions and their 3 distinct conjugates. (Count = 6)\n\n**Case k=4: Largest part 21.** Partitions of 4 are 5. All irreps for $(21,\\pi)$ are < 500,000.\n*   $d_{(21,4)} = 10,350$.\n*   $d_{(21,3,1)} = 24,310$.\n*   $d_{(21,2,2)} = 12,650$.\n*   $d_{(21,2,1,1)} = 26,000$.\n*   $d_{(21,1^4)} = \\binom{24}{4} = 10,626$.\n    All 5 dimensions are < 500,000. This gives 5 partitions and their 5 distinct conjugates. (Count = 10)\n\n**Case k=5: Largest part 20.** Partitions of 5 are 7. All irreps for $(20,\\pi)$ are < 500,000.\n*   $d_{(20,5)} = 40,480$.\n*   $d_{(20,4,1)} = 106,260$.\n*   $d_{(20,3,2)} = 116,280$.\n*   $d_{(20,3,1,1)} = 118,755$.\n*   $d_{(20,2,2,1)} = 134,550$.\n*   $d_{(20,2,1,1,1)} = 131,560$.\n*   $d_{(20,1^5)} = \\binom{24}{5} = 42,504$.\n    All 7 dimensions are < 500,000, giving 7 partitions and their 7 distinct conjugates. (Count = 14)\n\n**Case k=6: Largest part 19.** Partitions of 6 are 11.\n*   $d_{(19,6)} = 123,970 < 500,000$. (2 irreps)\n*   $d_{(19,5,1)} = 376,740 < 500,000$. (2 irreps)\n*   $d_{(19,4,2)} = 455,455 < 500,000$. (2 irreps)\n*   $d_{(19,4,1,1)} = 475,020 < 500,000$. (2 irreps)\n*   $d_{(19,3,3)} = 352,716 < 500,000$. (2 irreps)\n*   $d_{(19,3,2,1)} = 593,775 > 500,000$.\n*   $d_{(19,1^6)} = \\binom{24}{6} = 134,596 < 500,000$. (2 irreps)\n    The other 5 partitions of 6 also result in dimensions greater than 500,000. So we have 6 partitions in this category. This gives 6 partitions and their 6 distinct conjugates. (Count = 12)\n\n**Case k=7: Largest part 18.** Partitions of 7 are 15.\n*   $d_{(18,7)} = 303,600 < 500,000$. (2 irreps)\n*   $d_{(18,1^7)} = \\binom{24}{7} = 346,104 < 500,000$. (2 irreps)\n    Other partitions like $(18,6,1)$ have dimensions over 1,000,000. Only these two types yield dimensions under the limit. (Count = 4)\n\n**Case k=8: Largest part 17.**\n*   $d_{(17,8)} = 600,875 > 500,000$.\n*   $d_{(17,1^8)} = \\binom{24}{8} = 735,471 > 500,000$.\n    Since the dimensions for the \"extreme\" partitions of the form $(17, \\pi)$ are already too large, we can stop here. Partitions with $k>8$ will also have larger dimensions.\n\n**Step 4: Self-conjugate partitions**\nA self-conjugate partition would be counted only once. However, these partitions are \"central\" and tend to have very large dimensions. For $n=25$, the smallest dimension of a self-conjugate irrep corresponds to the partition $\\lambda=(13,1^{12})$, and its dimension is $d_\\lambda=\\binom{24}{12}=2,704,156$, which is much larger than 500,000. Thus, none of the irreps we have found are self-conjugate.\n\n### Step 5: Final Tally\nWe sum the counts from each case:\n*   k=0: 2 irreps\n*   k=1: 2 irreps\n*   k=2: 4 irreps\n*   k=3: 6 irreps\n*   k=4: 10 irreps\n*   k=5: 14 irreps\n*   k=6: 12 irreps\n*   k=7: 4 irreps\n\nTotal number of irreps = $2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 12 + 4 = 54$."
