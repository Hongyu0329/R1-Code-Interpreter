    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n    *   **Landmark:** Pantheon.\n    *   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature.\"\n    *   **Action:** It was removed.\n    *   **Date:** Specifically around 1950.\n    *   **Agent:** The city administration.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   The most famous feature ever removed from the Pantheon is the pair of bell towers added in the 17th century by the architect Bernini (or his contemporary Maderno).\n    *   These towers were widely disliked by the Romans, who gave them the derisive nickname *\"le orecchie d'asino\"* (the donkey's ears).\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** While these towers fit the description of a \"unique architectural feature\" that was removed, the timing is incorrect. They were demolished much earlier, around 1883, not in 1950. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.\n\n3.  **Investigating the 1950 Timeframe:**\n    *   The year 1950 is a crucial clue. It is in the post-World War II period, a time of significant urban change and modernization across Europe.\n    *   We need to look for a feature of the Piazza della Rotonda that was removed during this specific era by a municipal decision. This shifts the focus from the Pantheon building itself to the infrastructure of the square.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Correct Feature:**\n    *   In the first half of the 20th century, like many European cities, Rome had an extensive network of tramways for public transportation.\n    *   These tram lines ran through many of the city's most historic areas, including the Piazza della Rotonda.\n    *   The feature in the square consisted of the metal **tramway tracks** set into the cobblestones and the **overhead electrical lines** (catenary) that powered the trams. This network of tracks and wires was a very prominent, and to many, intrusive feature of the historic square's landscape.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** While we might not immediately think of tram lines as \"architectural,\" they are a significant element of urban infrastructure and design. Their presence or absence dramatically defines the character and architecture of a public space.\n\n5.  **Confirming the Removal:**\n    *   After WWII, and specifically around 1950, the Rome city administration began a program to dismantle many tram lines within the historic center.\n    *   The goals were to reduce visual clutter (getting rid of the overhead wires), ease traffic congestion for the growing number of cars and buses, and \"restore\" a more classical appearance to the historic piazzas.\n    *   The tram line passing through the Piazza della Rotonda was one of those decommissioned and physically removed during this period.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe \"unique architectural feature\" refers to the network of **tramway lines**, including the tracks and overhead electrical wires, that passed through the square. While the \"donkey's ears\" bell towers are a more famous removal from the Pantheon, their demolition date is incorrect. The removal of the tram lines perfectly matches the 1950 timeframe and the action by the city administration to change the urban fabric of the piazza.\n\n<<<The tramway lines (tracks and overhead electrical wires)>>>"
