    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Reagents**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n    *   The \"benzamide\" core is a benzene ring attached to a C(=O)N group.\n    *   \"N,N-diethyl\" means two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are on the nitrogen of the amide.\n    *   \"3-dimethylamino\" means a -N(CH₃)₂ group is at the meta position (C-3) relative to the amide group (at C-1).\n\n    The structure is a benzene ring with a -C(=O)N(C₂H₅)₂ group at position 1 and a -N(CH₃)₂ group at position 3.\n\n*   **Reagents for the first step:** sec-BuLi and TMEDA in THF.\n    *   **sec-BuLi (sec-Butyllithium):** A very strong organolithium base. Its primary role here is to remove a proton (deprotonation).\n    *   **TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine):** A chelating agent for the lithium ion (Li⁺). It breaks down the aggregates of sec-BuLi, increasing its reactivity, and coordinates to the lithium, facilitating a specific type of reaction called Directed ortho-Metalation.\n    *   **THF (Tetrahydrofuran):** A polar aprotic solvent suitable for this reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Reaction of the First Step (Directed ortho-Metalation)**\n\nThe combination of a functionalized aromatic ring with a strong base like sec-BuLi/TMEDA strongly suggests a **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)** reaction. In a DoM reaction, a \"directing group\" on the benzene ring coordinates to the lithium ion, directing the base to deprotonate one of the adjacent (ortho) C-H bonds.\n\n1.  **Identify the Directing Groups (DMG):** Our starting material has two potential directing groups:\n    *   **-C(=O)N(C₂H₅)₂ (N,N-diethylamide group) at C-1:** This is a very powerful directing group due to the ability of its carbonyl oxygen to chelate the lithium ion.\n    *   **-N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino group) at C-3:** This is also a directing group, but it is weaker than the amide group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Deprotonation (Lithiation):** We need to see where each group directs the deprotonation.\n    *   The amide group at C-1 directs lithiation to its ortho positions: **C-2** and **C-6**.\n    *   The amino group at C-3 directs lithiation to its ortho positions: **C-2** and **C-4**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Combined Effect:** Both groups direct the lithiation towards the **C-2** position. This is a cooperative or synergistic effect. The proton at C-2 is the most acidic on the ring because its removal is stabilized by proximity to both electron-withdrawing/chelating groups. Therefore, sec-BuLi will selectively remove the proton from C-2.\n\n4.  **Form the Intermediate:** This deprotonation results in the formation of an aryllithium intermediate, where a lithium atom is bonded to C-2.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Step of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n*   **Reaction:** The aryllithium intermediate formed in Step 1 is a powerful nucleophile (essentially an aryl carbanion). Methyl iodide is an electrophile, with the carbon atom being electron-deficient. The nucleophilic carbon at C-2 attacks the electrophilic methyl carbon of CH₃I, displacing the iodide ion (I⁻) in an Sₙ2-type reaction.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Final Product**\n\nThe net result of the two steps is the replacement of the hydrogen atom at the C-2 position of the starting material with a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n*   **Starting Material:** N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n*   **Final Product:** The parent structure is the same, but with a new methyl group at the C-2 position.\n\nThe name of the final product is constructed as follows:\n*   Parent name: **benzamide**\n*   Substituents on the amide nitrogen: **N,N-diethyl**\n*   Substituents on the benzene ring: a **methyl** group at C-2 and a **dimethylamino** group at C-3. Listed alphabetically, \"dimethylamino\" comes before \"methyl\".\n\nThus, the final product is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide>>>"
