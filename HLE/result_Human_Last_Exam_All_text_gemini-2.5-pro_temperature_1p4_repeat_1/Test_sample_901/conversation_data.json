    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction.\n\n**1. Identify Reactants and Reagents**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring with defined stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent/Solvent System:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) in tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH). Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. This combination strongly favors the E2 elimination mechanism over SN2 substitution.\n\n**2. Determine the Reaction Mechanism**\n*   The reaction involves a secondary alkyl halide and a strong, bulky base. This is a classic setup for an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n*   A key feature of the E2 mechanism is its stereochemical requirement: the reaction proceeds via a concerted (one-step) pathway that requires the leaving group (Bromine) and a β-hydrogen (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) to be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation. In a cyclohexane ring, this means the leaving group and the β-hydrogen must both be in **axial** positions, one pointing up and the other pointing down.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemistry and Conformation of the Substrate**\n*   The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. In this molecule, the bromine atom at C1 and the methyl group at C2 are **trans** to each other (one points \"up\" and the other \"down\" relative to the plane of the ring).\n*   Cyclohexane exists in two chair conformations that are in equilibrium. We must draw both to determine which one can undergo the E2 reaction.\n    *   **Conformation A (di-equatorial):** The bulky bromine and methyl groups can both occupy equatorial positions. The Br would be equatorial 'down' and the methyl group would be equatorial 'up'. This is the **more stable** conformer because bulky groups prefer the less sterically crowded equatorial position.\n    *   **Conformation B (di-axial):** After a ring flip, the bromine atom becomes axial 'down' and the methyl group becomes axial 'up'. This is the **less stable** conformer due to significant 1,3-diaxial steric interactions.\n\n**4. Identify the Reactive Conformation**\n*   The E2 reaction requires the leaving group (Br) to be in an **axial** position.\n*   Therefore, the reaction can only proceed through the less stable di-axial conformer (Conformation B). Even though its concentration is low at equilibrium, the molecule will continuously interconvert, and any molecule that adopts this conformation can react.\n\n**5. Locate the Anti-Periplanar β-Hydrogens**\n*   Let's examine the reactive conformation (Br axial down, CH₃ axial up). The β-carbons (carbons adjacent to C1) are C2 and C6.\n    *   **β-Hydrogen at C2:** The methyl group is in the axial 'up' position. This means the hydrogen on C2 is in the **equatorial 'down'** position. This hydrogen is *not* anti-periplanar to the axial 'down' bromine; it is gauche (dihedral angle ≈ 60°). Therefore, elimination involving this hydrogen is impossible via the E2 mechanism.\n    *   **β-Hydrogen at C6:** Carbon C6 has two hydrogens: one axial and one equatorial. The **axial 'up' hydrogen** is perfectly anti-periplanar (dihedral angle = 180°) to the **axial 'down' bromine** at C1.\n\n**6. Predict the Product**\n*   Since only the axial hydrogen on C6 can be abstracted by the base in an E2 reaction, the double bond can only form between C1 and C6.\n*   The base (tert-butoxide) removes the axial proton from C6, and the bromide ion leaves from C1, forming a double bond between C1 and C6. The methyl group on C2 is unaffected.\n*   The resulting product is an alkene where the double bond is between the original C1 and C6, and the methyl group is on the original C2.\n\n**7. Name the Final Product**\n*   To name the product, we number the ring to give the double bond the lowest possible numbers (C1 and C2).\n*   If the double bond is now between C1 and C2, the methyl group is located on C3.\n*   Therefore, the name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This outcome, where the less substituted alkene is formed, is a classic example of stereoelectronic control overriding the usual Zaitsev's rule (which favors the more substituted alkene). The stereochemistry of the starting material forces the reaction to proceed through a specific pathway, leading to a single regiochemical product.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
