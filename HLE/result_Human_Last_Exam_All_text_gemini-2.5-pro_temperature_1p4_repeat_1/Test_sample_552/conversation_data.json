    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The user wants to know whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his specific 1905 paper about Brownian motion.\n\n2.  **Identify the Specific Paper:** The paper in question is one of Einstein's four \"Annus Mirabilis\" papers. Its German title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n3.  **Examine the Paper for Citations:** A careful review of this specific 1905 paper reveals a notable feature: like his paper on special relativity from the same year, it contains no formal bibliography or list of citations. Einstein wrote it from first principles, building his argument from the ground up. He makes a brief, informal mention of the experimental work of Henry Siedentopf and Richard Zsigmondy with the ultramicroscope, but he does not cite a specific publication or lectures from them. Therefore, strictly speaking, the 1905 paper on Brownian motion cites no one's lectures.\n\n4.  **Consider the Broader Context of Einstein's 1905 Work:** This is a crucial step, as questions of this nature often have a nuanced answer. In the same year, 1905, Einstein also completed his doctoral dissertation, titled \"Eine neue Bestimmung der Moleküldimensionen\" (\"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\"). This thesis is intellectually and thematically inseparable from his paper on Brownian motion. Both works are cornerstones of his early research into statistical mechanics and aimed to provide evidence for the existence of atoms.\n\n5.  **Examine the Citations in the Doctoral Thesis:** Unlike the journal paper, Einstein's doctoral thesis *does* contain formal citations to the scientific literature. Among the few works he references is the influential book by **Ludwig Boltzmann**, titled **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\" (\"Lectures on Gas Theory\")**.\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** The question specifically asks about the \"1905 paper on Brownian motion,\" which technically has no such citation. However, it is a very common and understandable conflation to associate the citations in his PhD thesis with his work on Brownian motion from the same year, as they were part of the same research program. The most likely and intended answer to the question refers to the citation found in this closely related work.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Precision of the Question:** The question is very specific about the \"paper,\" which makes the strictly correct answer \"no one.\"\n*   **Likely Intent:** The question is more likely probing Einstein's influences during his work on Brownian motion in 1905. In that context, the citation in his thesis from the same year is highly relevant.\n*   **Distinction between Paper and Thesis:** It is important to distinguish between the journal paper published in *Annalen der Physik* and the doctoral dissertation submitted to the University of Zurich. While developed concurrently and closely related, they are distinct documents.\n*   **The Person Cited:** The key figure whose lectures (in published book form) were cited is Ludwig Boltzmann, a pioneer of statistical mechanics whose work heavily influenced Einstein.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation:\n\nBased on this analysis, the person whose lectures were cited in Einstein's 1905 work on molecules and their motion is Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
