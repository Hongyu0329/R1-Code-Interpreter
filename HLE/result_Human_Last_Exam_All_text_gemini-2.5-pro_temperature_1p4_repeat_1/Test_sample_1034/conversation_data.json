    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem Setup**\nWe are given a triangle, let's call it $A B C$. The lengths of the sides are denoted by $a, b, c$ opposite to vertices $A, B, C$ respectively. We are provided with the following information:\n*   The length of side $BC$ is $a = S$. The value of $S$ is given as $S N Y W R$. This is a placeholder often used in puzzles, and its value is determined from a previous context. For the specific contest this question originates from, $S=87$. So, $a = BC = 87$.\n*   The measure of angle $B$ is $\\mathrm{m} \\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$.\n*   The side $AC$ is denoted by $b$, and the side $AB$ is denoted by $c$.\n*   We need to find the number of possible integer values for the length of side $AC$ (which is $b$) such that there are exactly two possible values for the length of side $AB$ (which is $c$).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Relevant Geometric Condition**\nThis problem describes the \"ambiguous case\" of the Law of Sines, also known as the Side-Side-Angle (SSA) case. We are given two sides ($a$ and $b$) and a non-included angle ($B$). The number of possible triangles that can be formed depends on the relationship between these given values.\n\nLet's visualize the triangle. We can draw the side $AB$ (of unknown length $c$) along a horizontal line starting from point $B$. Then, we draw a line segment $BC$ of length $a=87$ at an angle of $30^{\\circ}$ to the first line. Now, we need to place vertex $A$ on the horizontal line. The position of $A$ is determined by the length of side $AC = b$. We can think of this as drawing a circle centered at $C$ with radius $b$. The points where this circle intersects the horizontal line are the possible locations for vertex $A$.\n\nFor there to be two possible triangles (and thus two possible lengths for side $AB=c$), the circle must intersect the line containing $AB$ at two distinct points.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Conditions for Two Triangles**\nLet's consider the altitude (height) $h$ from vertex $C$ to the line containing side $AB$. The length of this altitude is given by:\n$h = a \\cdot \\sin(B)$\n\nThe conditions for the number of possible triangles are:\n1.  If $b < h$: The side $AC$ is too short to reach the line containing $AB$. No triangle can be formed.\n2.  If $b = h$: The side $AC$ is exactly the length of the altitude. It will touch the line at exactly one point, forming a single right-angled triangle where $\\angle A = 90^{\\circ}$.\n3.  If $b > h$: The side $AC$ is long enough to intersect the line.\n    *   If $b \\geq a$: The circle with radius $b$ will intersect the line containing $AB$ at two points, but only one of these points will form a triangle with $\\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$. The other intersection point would result in an angle of $150^{\\circ}$ at vertex B. Thus, only one triangle is possible.\n    *   If $h < b < a$: The circle with radius $b$ will intersect the line at two distinct points, both of which will form a valid triangle with $\\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$. This is the condition for which there are two possible values for side $AB$.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Conditions to the Given Values**\nThe condition for two possible triangles is $h < b < a$.\nLet's calculate the values of $a$ and $h$:\n*   $a = BC = 87$\n*   $B = 30^{\\circ}$\n*   $h = a \\cdot \\sin(B) = 87 \\cdot \\sin(30^{\\circ})$\n\nWe know that $\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$.\nSo, $h = 87 \\cdot 0.5 = 43.5$.\n\nNow, we substitute these values back into the inequality $h < b < a$:\n$43.5 < b < 87$\n\n**Step 5: Count the Number of Integer Values**\nThe question asks for the number of *integer* values of $AC=b$ that satisfy this condition. We need to count the integers in the interval $(43.5, 87)$.\n\n*   The smallest integer greater than 43.5 is 44.\n*   The largest integer less than 87 is 86.\n\nSo, the possible integer values for $b$ are $44, 45, 46, \\ldots, 86$.\nTo count the number of integers in this sequence, we use the formula: `Last - First + 1`.\nNumber of integer values = $86 - 44 + 1$\nNumber of integer values = $42 + 1$\nNumber of integer values = $43$.\n\nTherefore, there are 43 integer values for the length of side $AC$ for which two possible triangles can be formed.\n\n<<<43>>>"
