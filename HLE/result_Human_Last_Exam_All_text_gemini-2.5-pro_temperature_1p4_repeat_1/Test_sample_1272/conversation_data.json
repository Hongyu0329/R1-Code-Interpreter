    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the historical context and the key figure.**\nThe question concerns the military campaigns of the Ming Dynasty in Vietnam during the early 15th century. The specific individual is General Mu Sheng (沐晟), a prominent military commander of the Ming Dynasty who was heavily involved in the affairs of Vietnam (then known to the Ming as Jiaozhi province).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mu Sheng's campaigns in Vietnam to find the \"major defeat\".**\nMu Sheng participated in two main phases of Ming military action in Vietnam:\n1.  **The initial invasion (1406–1407):** Mu Sheng, alongside General Zhang Fu, led the successful Ming invasion that overthrew the Hồ dynasty. This campaign was a victory for the Ming, so his first major defeat did not occur here.\n2.  **The Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427):** This was a widespread Vietnamese rebellion led by Lê Lợi to oust the Ming occupiers. While Ming forces faced numerous difficulties and battles throughout this period, the most decisive and major defeats occurred at the end of the conflict.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the specific event of Mu Sheng's defeat.**\nIn 1427, the Ming Emperor sent a large final relief expedition to Vietnam to break the siege of the Ming capital, Dongguan (modern Hanoi). This expedition was split into two armies:\n*   One army, led by General Liu Sheng (柳升), advanced from Guangxi.\n*   Another army, led by General Mu Sheng, advanced from Yunnan.\n\nLiu Sheng's army was ambushed and utterly annihilated in the famous Battle of Chi Lăng – Xương Giang. Upon hearing the news of Liu Sheng's catastrophic defeat, Mu Sheng's army, which was advancing south from Yunnan, lost its morale and began to retreat.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the location of the battle.**\nAs Mu Sheng's army retreated, Lê Lợi dispatched his generals, including Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, to pursue and attack them. The Vietnamese forces caught up with Mu Sheng's army and inflicted heavy losses in a series of ambushes. The key locations mentioned in historical records for this rout are **Lãnh Câu** (also written as Lãnh Cẩu or Khâu Cấp) and **Đan Xá**. This engagement was a decisive victory for the Vietnamese and a clear, major defeat for Mu Sheng, forcing him to flee back to Yunnan. This was his most significant and defining defeat in the Vietnamese theater.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the current Vietnamese province corresponding to the historical location.**\nThe battles of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá took place along the Thao River (Sông Thao), which is the name for the upper stretch of the Red River in Vietnam. The historical route from Yunnan into the Red River Delta passes through this region. Geographically and historically, this area is located within the present-day **Yên Bái Province**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **\"First\" Major Defeat:** While Mu Sheng may have encountered smaller setbacks or difficult campaigns earlier, the 1427 rout at Lãnh Câu/Đan Xá was his most significant personal command failure and is universally acknowledged as a major defeat. It directly contributed to the end of Ming rule in Vietnam.\n*   **Distinguishing from other battles:** It's important not to confuse Mu Sheng's defeat with the more famous defeat of Liu Sheng at Chi Lăng (which is in modern Lạng Sơn Province). Mu Sheng's defeat happened shortly after, in a different location, as he was leading the second relief army from a different direction (Yunnan).\n*   **Historical vs. Modern Names:** The key is to correctly map the historical battle locations (Lãnh Câu, Đan Xá) to a modern administrative unit (Yên Bái Province).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first and most significant major defeat during the Lam Sơn uprising is Yên Bái.\n\n<<<Yên Bái Province>>>"
