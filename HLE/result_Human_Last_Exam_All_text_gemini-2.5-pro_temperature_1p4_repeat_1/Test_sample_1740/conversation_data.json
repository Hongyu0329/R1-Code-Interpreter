    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and define \"let-7 family member\".**\nThe question asks for the total number of members of the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family found in humans to date. A \"family member\" can be interpreted in two ways:\n1.  The number of unique mature miRNA sequences (e.g., let-7a, let-7b, etc.).\n2.  The number of distinct genes (precursor miRNAs or paralogs) that produce these mature miRNAs.\nThe most precise and standard way to count members of a gene family is to count the number of distinct gene loci. We will follow this approach for the most accurate answer. The primary and authoritative source for miRNA data is the miRBase database.\n\n**Step 2: List the canonical let-7 family members.**\nThe let-7 family is named with letters (e.g., let-7a, let-7b). In humans (`Homo sapiens`, abbreviated hsa), the following mature let-7 miRNAs are well-established:\n*   hsa-let-7a\n*   hsa-let-7b\n*   hsa-let-7c\n*   hsa-let-7d\n*   hsa-let-7e\n*   hsa-let-7f\n*   hsa-let-7g\n*   hsa-let-7i\n\n**Step 3: Identify other closely related members.**\nBased on high sequence similarity, especially in the crucial \"seed\" region, another miRNA is consistently included as a member of the let-7 family:\n*   hsa-mir-98\n\n**Step 4: Count the distinct genes (paralogs) for each member.**\nSome mature miRNAs are produced from more than one gene located at different positions in the genome. We need to count each of these distinct gene loci as a separate family member.\n*   **let-7a:** is encoded by 3 different genes (paralogs): `hsa-let-7a-1`, `hsa-let-7a-2`, and `hsa-let-7a-3`.\n*   **let-7b:** is encoded by 1 gene: `hsa-let-7b`.\n*   **let-7c:** is encoded by 1 gene: `hsa-let-7c`.\n*   **let-7d:** is encoded by 1 gene: `hsa-let-7d`.\n*   **let-7e:** is encoded by 1 gene: `hsa-let-7e`.\n*   **let-7f:** is encoded by 2 different genes: `hsa-let-7f-1` and `hsa-let-7f-2`.\n*   **let-7g:** is encoded by 1 gene: `hsa-let-7g`.\n*   **let-7i:** is encoded by 1 gene: `hsa-let-7i`.\n*   **miR-98:** is encoded by 1 gene: `hsa-mir-98`.\n\n**Step 5: Sum the number of genes.**\nNow, we add up the number of distinct genes for each family member to get the total count.\n*   Count from let-7a: 3\n*   Count from let-7b: 1\n*   Count from let-7c: 1\n*   Count from let-7d: 1\n*   Count from let-7e: 1\n*   Count from let-7f: 2\n*   Count from let-7g: 1\n*   Count from let-7i: 1\n*   Count from miR-98: 1\n*   **Total = 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12**\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Ambiguity of \"member\":** It is crucial to clarify whether the question asks for mature miRNA types or the genes encoding them. Counting the genes (paralogs) provides a more precise and stable number. There are 9 distinct mature miRNA types (let-7a, b, c, d, e, f, g, i, and miR-98), but these are produced by 12 distinct genes.\n*   **Exclusion of let-7h:** `let-7h` was previously annotated but later removed from miRBase for humans as it was determined not to be a distinct miRNA precursor. Therefore, it is not included in the current count.\n*   **Inclusion of miR-98:** While not named \"let-7\", miR-98 is universally considered part of the family due to its shared seed sequence and function.\n*   **Source of Truth:** All data is based on the current annotations in the miRBase database, the central repository for miRNA nomenclature and sequences.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the analysis of distinct gene loci (paralogs) as recorded in the authoritative miRBase database, there are 12 members of the let-7 family in humans.\n\n<<<12>>>"
