    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the verses in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the Prophets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Poem and its Structure:** The poem is 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi. It's a short, metered text (a *matn*) that systematically covers the essential pillars of Islamic faith (*Iman*). The section on the Messengers/Prophets (*Rusul*) comes after the discussion of Allah and His attributes.\n\n2.  **Locate the Preamble to the List:** Before listing the Prophets by name, the author provides an introductory verse stating the number of prophets whose names are obligatory for a Muslim to know. This verse is:\n    *   **Bayt 28:** وَتَفْصِيْلُهُمْ خَمْسَةٌ وَعِشْرُوْنَ لَزِمْ\n      كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    *   **Translation:** \"Their details are twenty-five, it is binding upon every accountable person, so verify and seize this opportunity.\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** This verse tells us that a list of 25 prophets is about to begin, but it does not contain any of the names itself. Therefore, the list starts in the *next* verse.\n\n3.  **Identify the Starting Bayt (Verse):** The very next verse begins the enumeration of the Prophets' names.\n    *   **Bayt 29:** هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ\n      صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    *   **Translation:** \"They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim, each to be followed.\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is clearly the beginning of the list, mentioning the first six prophets.\n\n4.  **Trace the Continuation of the List:** The poem continues to list the names in the subsequent verses.\n    *   **Bayt 30:** لُوْطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيْلُ إِسْحَاقٌ كَذَا\n      يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى\n    *   **Bayt 31:** شُعَيْبٌ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ\n      ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\n    *   **Bayt 32:** إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُsسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى\n      وَعِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ عَنِ الْغَيِّ\n    *   **Careful Point:** The standard version of the poem often splits the last set of names between two couplets for rhyming and meter. A more common and widely accepted division places the end of the list in bayt 33. Let's re-examine the division.\n\n5.  **Re-evaluating the Standard Versification and Identifying the Ending Bayt:** Looking at the most standard printed versions and commentaries, the division of verses is as follows:\n    *   **Bayt 29:** Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, Salih, Ibrahim.\n    *   **Bayt 30:** Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, Ayyub.\n    *   **Bayt 31:** Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, and Al-Yasa'.\n    *   **Bayt 32:** Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman, Ilyas.\n    *   **Bayt 33:** Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ), who is the seal.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The name 'Yunus' starts Bayt 33 in this standard versification, and the list concludes in the same verse with 'Taha'. Therefore, Bayt 33 is the final verse containing the names. The subsequent verse (Bayt 34) discusses the angels.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the poem's standard structure, the enumeration of the 25 prophets' names begins in **Bayt 29** and concludes in **Bayt 33**.\n\n<<<From bayt 29 to bayt 33>>>"
