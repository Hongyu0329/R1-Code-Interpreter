    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Coiled-Coil Heptad Repeat:**\n    Coiled-coils are formed by amphipathic alpha-helices that have a characteristic seven-residue repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The key to this structure is the packing of hydrophobic side chains. Positions 'a' and 'd' are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues and form the core of the oligomer, packing against each other in a \"knobs-into-holes\" fashion. Positions 'e' and 'g' are often charged and can form salt bridges between helices, but they can also be involved in packing.\n\n2.  **Determine the Heptad Register for the Given Sequence:**\n    The sequence is `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`. We need to find the `(abcdefg)` assignment that places hydrophobic residues (like I, L, A, W) at the 'a' and 'd' core positions.\n    Let's test possible alignments. The most likely alignment is one that maximizes the hydrophobicity of the 'a' and 'd' positions across the entire sequence.\n    Consider the repeating pattern `I-X-X-X-L/W-X-X`. This strongly suggests a `d-e-f-g-a-b-c` repeat. Let's assign the first Isoleucine (I) to the 'd' position.\n\n    Sequence: `G E` **`I A Q S L K E`** **`I A K S L K E`** **`I A W S L K E`** **`I A Q S L K G`**\n    Register:       **`d e f g a b c`** **`d e f g a b c`** **`d e f g a b c`** **`d e f g a b c`**\n\n    Let's verify this assignment by listing the amino acids at each position of the heptad repeat:\n    *   **Position 'a' (Core):** L, L, W, L — All are hydrophobic. W (Tryptophan) is very large.\n    *   **Position 'b':** K, K, S, K — Polar/Charged.\n    *   **Position 'c':** E, E, L, E — Mostly Charged (E) or hydrophobic (L).\n    *   **Position 'd' (Core):** I, I, I, I — All are Isoleucine, a hydrophobic residue.\n    *   **Position 'e' (Flanking):** A, A, A, A — All are Alanine, a small hydrophobic residue.\n    *   **Position 'f':** Q, K, W, Q — Mostly Polar/Charged (Q, K), with one large hydrophobic (W). (Note: There is a typo in my alignment. Looking back at the sequence: `I-A-W-S-L-K-E`. So f position is S, not W. Let's recheck)\n\n    Let's re-verify the alignment very carefully:\n    Heptad 1: `I A Q S L K E` -> a=L, b=K, c=E, d=I, e=A, f=Q, g=S\n    Heptad 2: `I A K S L K E` -> a=L, b=K, c=E, d=I, e=A, f=K, g=S\n    Heptad 3: `I A W S L K E` -> a=L, b=K, c=E, d=I, e=A, f=W, g=S\n    Heptad 4: `I A Q S L K G` -> a=L, b=K, c=G, d=I, e=A, f=Q, g=S\n\n    There's still a mistake in my manual transcription. Let's do it one character at a time from the source: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n    *   Heptad 1: I(3) A Q S L(7) K E -> `I(d) A(e) Q(f) S(g) L(a) K(b) E(c)`\n    *   Heptad 2: I(10) A K S L(14) K E -> `I(d) A(e) K(f) S(g) L(a) K(b) E(c)`\n    *   Heptad 3: I(17) A W S L(21) K E -> `I(d) A(e) W(f) S(g) L(a) K(b) E(c)`\n    *   Heptad 4: I(24) A Q S L(28) K G -> `I(d) A(e) Q(f) S(g) L(a) K(b) G(c)`\n\n    Wait, the sequence has a W at position 20, which is `I A W S`. `W` is at the `f` position? No, `W` is at position 19. Let me restart the whole register assignment, as it is critical and I am making errors.\n\n    Sequence: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n    Let's just list the positions:\n    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31\n    G  E  I  A  Q  S  L  K  E  I  A  K  S  L  K  E  I  A  W  S  L  K  E  I  A  Q  S  L  K  G\n\n    Let's test `d`=I at pos 3. Then `a` is at pos 7 (3+4), `d` at pos 10 (3+7), `a` at pos 14, `d` at pos 17, `a` at pos 21, `d` at pos 24, `a` at pos 28.\n    *   **Positions 'd':** I(3), I(10), I(17), I(24) -> All Isoleucine.\n    *   **Positions 'a':** L(7), L(14), L(21), L(28) -> All Leucine.\n\n    THIS is the correct core assignment. The `W` is at position 19, which is not a core `a` or `d` position. Let's find out what position it is.\n    d(17), e(18), f(19). So `W` is at an `f` position. My previous attempts were incorrect.\n\n    Corrected Heptad Positions based on **`d`=I(3), `a`=L(7)** register:\n    *   **Position 'a' (Core):** L, L, L, L — Excellent. All hydrophobic.\n    *   **Position 'd' (Core):** I, I, I, I — Excellent. All hydrophobic.\n    *   **Position 'e':** K, K, K, K — All Lysine. Positively charged.\n    *   **Position 'g':** E, E, E, E — All Glutamate. Negatively charged.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Core Packing and Flanking Interactions:**\n    *   **Core (`a` and `d` positions):** We have Leucine (L) at all 'a' positions and Isoleucine (I) at all 'd' positions. This `a=L, d=I` pattern is a classic determinant of oligomeric state.\n        *   **Dimer:** A standard dimer prefers beta-branched amino acids (like Isoleucine) at the 'a' position and non-beta-branched (like Leucine) at the 'd' position. This is because of the way the side chains pack (`a-a'` vs `d-d'` interface). Our sequence has the reverse: `I` at `d` and `L` at `a`. The bulky, beta-branched Isoleucine side chain at the 'd' position creates significant steric clashes in the parallel, two-stranded coiled-coil of a dimer.\n        *   **Trimer:** In a trimer, the packing is different. The `d` knobs pack into a hole created by `g` and `a` residues of the adjacent helix. This geometry accommodates the beta-branched Isoleucine at the 'd' position much better than a dimer does. Therefore, an `I` at the 'd' position strongly favors a trimer over a dimer.\n        *   **Tetramer:** A tetramer is also possible and can accommodate `I` at `d`. However, a tetramer is most strongly favored by the reverse pattern (`a=I, d=L`).\n    *   **Flanking (`e` and `g` positions):** We have Lysine (K, positive) at all 'e' positions and Glutamate (E, negative) at all 'g' positions. In an oligomer, the 'e' position of one helix is spatially close to the 'g' position of the adjacent helix in the *next* heptad (`g` -> `e'`). The repeating K at `e` and E at `g` allows for the formation of highly favorable, repeating electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between helices, which would further stabilize the oligomer. This K-E pattern is compatible with dimers, trimers, and tetramers.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Evidence and Conclude:**\n    The strongest piece of evidence for determining the oligomeric state from this sequence lies in the identity of the residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions. The consistent presence of Isoleucine at the 'd' position is a well-established motif that disfavors the formation of dimers due to steric hindrance. This packing problem is relieved in a trimeric (or tetrameric) structure. Given that the `a=I, d=L` pattern is the most common for tetramers, the `a=L, d=I` pattern found here is most indicative of a **trimer**. The favorable `e-g` salt bridges provide stability but do not strongly differentiate between the possible oligomeric states beyond a dimer. The overwhelming factor is the steric constraint imposed by having Isoleucine at every 'd' position.\n\nFinal Answer Prediction: The protein will form a trimer.\n\nAnswer Choice mapping:\nA. 2 (Dimer) - Unlikely due to I at 'd'.\nB. 3 (Trimer) - Highly likely. Best fits the `a=L, d=I` core pattern.\nC. 4 (Tetramer) - Possible, but less likely than a trimer for this specific pattern.\nD. 5 (Pentamer) - No indication for this. Pentamers usually have specific features like a polar Gln-zipper, which is absent here.\nE. 6 (Hexamer) - No indication.\nF. 7 (Heptamer) - No indication.\nG. 8 (Octamer) - No indication.\n\nThe most logical answer based on biophysical principles of coiled-coil assembly is 3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
