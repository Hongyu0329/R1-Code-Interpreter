    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ where $S$ contains 4 unary predicates.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Language and Concepts\n\n*   **Schema $S$**: The schema consists of four unary predicates, let's denote them as $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A model $M$ for this schema consists of a universe of discourse $U$ and interpretations for these predicates, which are subsets of the universe: $P_1^M, P_2^M, P_3^M, P_4^M \\subseteq U$.\n\n*   **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of First-Order Logic.\n    *   The formulas are built using only the existential quantifier ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the constants for true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$).\n    *   The formulas use the predicates from schema $S$.\n    *   Crucially, this logic fragment does not include negation ($\\neg$), disjunction ($\\lor$), or the universal quantifier ($\\forall$). This makes it a positive, existential fragment of logic.\n\n*   **Concept Class**: A formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ defines a *concept* on a given model $M$. The concept is the set of elements in the universe $U$ that satisfy the formula:\n    $C_{\\phi,M} = \\{a \\in U \\mid M \\models \\phi(a)\\}$.\n    The collection of all such concepts definable by formulas in our logic, for a given model $M$, forms the *concept class* $\\mathcal{C}_M$.\n\n*   **VC Dimension of a Logic**: The VC dimension of a logic fragment is defined as the maximum VC dimension of the concept class $\\mathcal{C}_M$ over all possible models $M$.\n    $\\text{VCdim}(\\text{Logic}) = \\sup_{M} \\text{VCdim}(\\mathcal{C}_M)$.\n\n### Step 2: Characterizing the Definable Concepts\n\nLet's analyze the structure of any formula $\\phi(x)$ in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$.\nA formula with one free variable $x$ is built by applying $\\exists$ and $\\land$ to atomic formulas. Atomic formulas are of the form $P_i(v)$, where $v$ is a variable.\n\nAny formula $\\phi(x)$ can be rewritten by distributing $\\exists$ over variables that are not conjunctively linked. A general form of such a formula is equivalent to a conjunction of a \"local part\" involving the free variable $x$ and a \"sentential part\" (a formula with no free variables).\nSpecifically, any formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to one of the form:\n$(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)) \\land \\sigma$\nwhere $I$ is some subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, and $\\sigma$ is a sentence (a formula without free variables). The sentence $\\sigma$ is a conjunction of statements of the form $\\exists y_1, \\dots, y_m (\\dots)$, which assert the existence of certain elements or element combinations in the model.\n\nIn a fixed model $M$, the sentence $\\sigma$ is either true or false.\n*   If $M \\models \\sigma$, the concept defined by $\\phi(x)$ is $\\{a \\in U \\mid M \\models \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(a)\\} = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M$.\n*   If $M \\not\\models \\sigma$, the concept defined by $\\phi(x)$ is the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\n\nTherefore, for any model $M$, the class of definable concepts $\\mathcal{C}_M$ is a subset of the collection of all possible intersections of the predicate interpretations $P_i^M$, plus the empty set.\nLet $H_i = P_i^M$. The class of concepts formed by all possible intersections is $\\mathcal{H}_M = \\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} H_i \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\}$.\nThe concept class $\\mathcal{C}_M$ is contained in $\\mathcal{H}_M \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$. Note that for any $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, the set $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} H_i$ is itself definable by the simple formula $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ (where the sentential part $\\sigma$ is $\\top$). So, $\\mathcal{H}_M \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}_M$. Therefore, the non-empty concepts in $\\mathcal{C}_M$ are precisely the sets in $\\mathcal{H}_M$.\n\n### Step 3: Upper Bound for the VC Dimension\n\nWe want to find an upper bound for $\\text{VCdim}(\\mathcal{C}_M)$ that holds for any model $M$. The VC dimension of $\\mathcal{C}_M$ is the size $d$ of the largest set $X \\subseteq U$ that can be shattered by $\\mathcal{C}_M$.\n\nTo shatter a set $X$ of size $d$, we must be able to generate all $2^d$ of its subsets using concepts from $\\mathcal{C}_M$. The number of concepts available in $\\mathcal{C}_M$ is the number of distinct sets in $\\mathcal{H}_M \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$. The class $\\mathcal{H}_M$ is generated by intersecting 4 sets ($H_1, H_2, H_3, H_4$). The number of possible subsets of these four sets to intersect is $2^4 = 16$. So, $|\\mathcal{H}_M| \\le 16$. This means $|\\mathcal{C}_M| \\le 16 + 1 = 17$ (including the empty set).\n\nSuppose we try to shatter a set $X$ of size 5. This would require generating all $2^5 = 32$ subsets of $X$. Since our concept class $\\mathcal{C}_M$ contains at most 17 distinct sets for any model $M$, it is impossible to generate 32 distinct subsets.\nTherefore, no set of size 5 can be shattered. This implies that for any model $M$, $\\text{VCdim}(\\mathcal{C}_M) \\le 4$.\nThus, the VC dimension of the logic is at most 4.\n\n### Step 4: Lower Bound for the VC Dimension\n\nTo establish a lower bound of 4, we must show that there exists at least one model $M$ for which $\\text{VCdim}(\\mathcal{C}_M) \\ge 4$. This requires us to construct a model $M$ and identify a set $X$ of size 4 that can be shattered by the corresponding concept class $\\mathcal{C}_M$.\n\nLet's choose the universe to be $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$. We need to define the interpretations of the predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ as subsets of $X$. A standard construction for this purpose is the \"dual-atom\" or \"co-atom\" encoding:\n*   $P_1^M = X \\setminus \\{x_1\\} = \\{x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $P_2^M = X \\setminus \\{x_2\\} = \\{x_1, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $P_3^M = X \\setminus \\{x_3\\} = \\{x_1, x_2, x_4\\}$\n*   $P_4^M = X \\setminus \\{x_4\\} = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$\n\nNow we show that any subset $Y \\subseteq X$ can be generated as an intersection of these four sets. Let $Y \\subseteq X$. Define an index set $I_Y \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ as $I_Y = \\{i \\mid x_i \\notin Y\\}$.\nLet's compute the intersection corresponding to $I_Y$:\n$\\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} P_i^M = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} (X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}) = X \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in I_Y} \\{x_i\\} = X \\setminus \\{x_i \\mid i \\in I_Y\\} = X \\setminus \\{x_i \\mid x_i \\notin Y\\} = Y$.\n\nSo, for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we can find an index set $I_Y$ such that $Y = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} P_i^M$.\nEach of these intersections is definable by the formula $\\phi_Y(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_Y} P_i(x)$.\nThis means that for this specific model $M$, the concept class $\\mathcal{C}_M$ contains every subset of $X$. The class of all subsets of $X$, $\\mathcal{P}(X)$, shatters $X$. The VC dimension of $\\mathcal{P}(X)$ is $|X|$.\nSince $|X|=4$, we have constructed a model $M$ where $\\text{VCdim}(\\mathcal{C}_M) = 4$.\nThis establishes a lower bound: the VC dimension of the logic is at least 4.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 3, we have the upper bound VCdim $\\le 4$.\nFrom Step 4, we have the lower bound VCdim $\\ge 4$.\nCombining these two results, the VC dimension must be exactly 4.\n\nThe number of unary predicates in the schema is the determining factor. For a schema with $k$ unary predicates, the VC dimension of this logic fragment would be $k$."
