    "Answering this question requires finding the slice rank of a specific tensor and matching it to the given asymptotic formula. Let's break down the analysis into steps.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Tensor and the Slice Rank**\n\nThe function is $T(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$, where $x, y, z \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n$. This function can be viewed as a 3-tensor in the space $V^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V^{\\otimes n}$, where $V = \\mathbb{C}^{\\{0, 1\\}}$ is the 2-dimensional space of functions from $\\{0, 1\\}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. The dimensions of this tensor are $2^n \\times 2^n \\times 2^n$.\n\nThe slice rank of a 3-tensor $T$ is the smallest integer $r$ such that $T$ can be written as a sum of $r$ \"slices\". A slice is a tensor of rank 1 in one of its modes, i.e., it has the form $A(x)B(y,z)$, $C(y)D(x,z)$, or $E(z)F(x,y)$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Property of Symmetric Tensors**\n\nThe tensor $T(x,y,z)$ is a symmetric tensor. This means its value is unchanged if we permute the roles of $x, y,$ and $z$. For example, $T(x,y,z) = T(y,x,z)$.\nThis symmetry is a crucial property. For a symmetric 3-tensor, the slice rank is equal to the rank of any of its \"flattenings\". A flattening is a matrix representation of the tensor. For example, the 1-flattening $M_x$ is a matrix where rows are indexed by $x$ and columns are indexed by the pair $(y,z)$. The entries of this matrix are the values of the tensor, $M_x[x, (y,z)] = T(x,y,z)$.\n\nDue to symmetry, we have $\\text{slicerank}(T) = \\text{rank}(M_x)$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Rank of the Flattening Matrix**\n\nThe rank of the matrix $M_x$ is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows. The rows are the functions $f_x(y,z) = T(x,y,z)$ for each fixed $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$.\n\nLet's analyze these functions. Let $x_S$ be the indicator vector for a subset $S \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. Any $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ can be represented as $x_S$ for some $S$.\nThe corresponding function is:\n$f_{x_S}(y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_{S,i} + y_i + z_i) - 1 = \\left( \\prod_{i \\in S} (1 + y_i + z_i) \\right) \\left( \\prod_{i \\notin S} (0 + y_i + z_i) \\right) - 1$.\n\nLet's define a set of basic functions $g_i(y,z) = y_i + z_i$. The domain is $\\{0,1\\}^2$ and the values are in $\\{0,1,2\\}$.\nThe functions spanning our space are of the form:\n$f_{x_S}(y,z) = \\left( \\prod_{i \\in S} (1 + g_i) \\right) \\left( \\prod_{i \\notin S} g_i \\right) - 1$.\n\nThe vector space spanned by these $2^n$ functions is $W = \\text{span}\\{ f_{x_S} \\mid S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\}$.\nThe rank of the matrix $M_x$ is $\\dim(W)$.\n\nLet's consider the set of $2^n$ functions $P_S(y,z) = \\left( \\prod_{i \\in S} (1 + g_i) \\right) \\left( \\prod_{i \\notin S} g_i \\right)$.\nThe space $W$ is contained in $\\text{span}(\\{1\\} \\cup \\{P_S\\})$. Since $f_{x_S} = P_S - 1$, if the constant function $1$ is in the span of $\\{P_S\\}$, then $\\text{dim}(W) = \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{P_S\\})$.\nThe set of functions $\\{P_S\\}_{S \\subseteq \\{1,...,n\\}}$ forms a basis for the space of polynomials in the variables $g_1, \\dots, g_n$ which have degree at most 1 in each variable. This is analogous to changing basis from the monomial basis $\\{\\prod_{i \\in L} g_i\\}_{L \\subseteq \\{1,...,n\\}}$ to the \"shifted\" monomial basis $\\{P_S\\}_S$.\nTo prove that the dimension is $2^n$, we need to show that the functions $\\{P_S\\}_{S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}}$ are linearly independent. This is equivalent to showing that the functions $h_L(y,z) = \\prod_{i \\in L} g_i = \\prod_{i \\in L} (y_i+z_i)$ for $L \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ are linearly independent.\n\nConsider a linear combination $\\sum_{L \\subseteq \\{1,..,n\\}} c_L h_L = 0$. We want to show all $c_L=0$.\nThis can be shown by induction or by evaluation at specific points. For instance, evaluating at $(y,z)$ where all $y_i=z_i=0$, gives $g_i=0$ for all $i$, so $h_L=0$ for $L \\ne \\emptyset$. This yields $c_\\emptyset h_\\emptyset = c_\\emptyset \\cdot 1 = 0$, so $c_\\emptyset=0$.\nNext, fixing $y_1=1, z_1=0$ (so $g_1=1$) and $y_i=z_i=0$ for $i>1$ (so $g_i=0$), we get $c_{\\{1\\}}=0$. Continuing this process, we can show that all coefficients $c_L$ must be zero.\nTherefore, the $2^n$ functions $\\{P_S\\}$ are linearly independent, and their span has dimension $2^n$. The constant function $1 = P_\\emptyset$ is in this set. Thus, the dimension of the space spanned by $\\{f_{x_S} = P_S-1\\}$ is also $2^n$.\n\nSo, the slice rank of the tensor is exactly $2^n$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine K**\n\nWe are given that the slice rank is asymptotically $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. The term $e^{o(n)}$ can account for sub-exponential factors (like polynomials in $n$), but the base of the exponential must match.\nWe have found that the slice rank is exactly $2^n$.\nTherefore, we can equate the bases of the exponential terms:\n$2 = \\frac{3}{2^K}$\n$2 \\cdot 2^K = 3$\n$2^{K+1} = 3$\nTaking $\\log_2$ on both sides:\n$K+1 = \\log_2(3)$\n$K = \\log_2(3) - 1$\n\nThis can also be written as $K = \\log_2(3/2)$.\n\n>>>\\log_2(3)-1"
