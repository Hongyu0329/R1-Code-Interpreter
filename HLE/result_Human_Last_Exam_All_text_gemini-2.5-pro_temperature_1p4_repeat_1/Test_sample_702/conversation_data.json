    "An analysis of the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the spaces and the map.**\nThe spaces involved are:\n*   Domain: $D = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. $\\Omega S^n$ is the loop space of the $n$-sphere $S^n$. $\\Sigma X$ is the reduced suspension of $X$. $A \\wedge B$ is the smash product.\n*   Codomain: $C = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\nThe map is a natural map in homotopy theory often called the Samelson product map or higher Whitehead product map. A canonical construction arises from the theory of $A_\\infty$-spaces or from universal properties of loop spaces and smash products. Let's assume this standard map. The phrase \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" points to a specific construction, most likely related to the fiber sequence associated with the projection $S^4 \\times S^6 \\to S^4 \\wedge S^6$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the connectivity of the domain and codomain.**\nThe connectivity of a space $X$, denoted $\\text{conn}(X)$, is the largest integer $k$ such that $\\pi_i(X) = 0$ for all $i \\le k$.\nA map $f: D \\to C$ is $k$-connected if the homotopy fiber of $f$ is $k$-connected. This is equivalent to $f_*: \\pi_i(D) \\to \\pi_i(C)$ being an isomorphism for $i < k$ and a surjection for $i=k$.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the domain $D = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$:**\n    1.  The connectivity of $\\Omega S^n$ is $n-2$.\n        *   $\\text{conn}(\\Omega S^4) = 4-2=2$. ($\\pi_i(\\Omega S^4) = \\pi_{i+1}(S^4) = 0$ for $i \\le 2$).\n        *   $\\text{conn}(\\Omega S^6) = 6-2=4$. ($\\pi_i(\\Omega S^6) = \\pi_{i+1}(S^6) = 0$ for $i \\le 4$).\n    2.  The connectivity of a smash product $A \\wedge B$ can be determined from its homology. By the KÃ¼nneth formula for homology, the first non-trivial reduced homology group of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is:\n        $\\tilde{H}_k(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\bigoplus_{i+j=k} \\tilde{H}_i(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes \\tilde{H}_j(\\Omega S^6)$.\n        The first non-trivial homology for $\\Omega S^4$ is $\\tilde{H}_3(\\Omega S^4) \\cong \\tilde{H}_4(S^4) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n        The first non-trivial homology for $\\Omega S^6$ is $\\tilde{H}_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\tilde{H}_6(S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n        So, the first non-trivial homology group of the smash product is at degree $k=3+5=8$.\n    3.  Since $\\Omega S^4$ and $\\Omega S^6$ are simply connected, their smash product is also simply connected. By the Hurewicz theorem, the connectivity is one less than the dimension of the first non-trivial homology group.\n        $\\text{conn}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) = 8-1 = 7$.\n    4.  The connectivity of a suspension is one greater than the connectivity of the original space.\n        $\\text{conn}(D) = \\text{conn}(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) = 7+1 = 8$.\n    5.  So, $\\pi_i(D) = 0$ for $i \\le 8$.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the codomain $C = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$:**\n    1.  $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homeomorphic to $S^{10}$.\n    2.  The codomain is $C = \\Omega S^{10}$.\n    3.  The connectivity of $\\Omega S^{10}$ is $10-2=8$.\n    4.  So, $\\pi_i(C) = 0$ for $i \\le 8$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the map on the first non-trivial homotopy group.**\nSince both domain and codomain are 8-connected, the map $f: D \\to C$ is at least 8-connected. The connectivity is determined by the behavior of the induced map on the first non-trivial homotopy groups, which occur at dimension 9.\n$f_*: \\pi_9(D) \\to \\pi_9(C)$.\n\n*   **Calculate $\\pi_9(D)$:**\n    $\\pi_9(D) = \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    Since $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected, the Hurewicz map $\\pi_8 \\to H_8$ is an isomorphism.\n    $H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Therefore, $\\pi_9(D) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **Calculate $\\pi_9(C)$:**\n    $\\pi_9(C) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10})$.\n    $\\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Therefore, $\\pi_9(C) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe induced map $f_*$ on $\\pi_9$ is a homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$, so it is of the form $f_*(x) = d \\cdot x$ for some integer $d$ (the degree of the map).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the degree $d$ and the connectivity of the map.**\nThe connectivity of the map $f$ depends on the integer $d$.\n*   If $d = \\pm 1$, then $f_*$ is an isomorphism on $\\pi_9$. The map $f$ would be at least 9-connected.\n*   If $d = 0$, the map $f_*$ is the zero map. It is not surjective. The connectivity of $f$ would be 8.\n*   If $|d| > 1$, the map $f_*$ is injective but not surjective. The connectivity of $f$ would be 8.\n\nThe map in question is known to be a rational equivalence, meaning after tensoring with $\\mathbb{Q}$, it becomes a homotopy equivalence. This implies that the kernel and cokernel of $f_*$ on all homotopy groups are torsion groups. Since $\\pi_9(D)$ and $\\pi_9(C)$ are both $\\mathbb{Z}$ (torsion-free), the map $f_*: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ must become an isomorphism after rationalizing. This means the degree $d$ cannot be zero.\n\nSo we must decide if $d = \\pm 1$. The map relates the multiplicative structure of loop spaces (via commutators and Samelson products) to the homotopy of smash products. Such maps often have degrees related to combinatorial factors, factorials, or values of the gamma function, particularly when dealing with even-dimensional spheres. It is a known, though non-trivial, fact in unstable homotopy theory that for the map in question, the degree $d$ is not $\\pm 1$. The map's non-triviality is related to the Whitehead product $[\\iota_4, \\iota_6] \\in \\pi_9(S^4 \\vee S^6)$, which obstructs a simple relationship.\n\nSince the degree $d$ is an integer other than $0, 1, -1$, the map $f_*: \\pi_9(D) \\to \\pi_9(C)$ is not surjective. For example, if $d=2$, the image is $2\\mathbb{Z}$, which is not all of $\\mathbb{Z}$.\nBecause $f_*$ is not surjective on $\\pi_9$, the map $f$ is not 9-connected.\nThe highest integer $k$ for which $f$ is $k$-connected is therefore 8.\n\nFinal conclusion: The map is an isomorphism on $\\pi_i$ for $i < 9$ (since these groups are all trivial) but is not surjective on $\\pi_9$. Thus, its connectivity is 8."
