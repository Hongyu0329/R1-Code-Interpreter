    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in the given configuration.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Basics of Surface Code Encoding**\n\n*   **Surface Code:** A quantum error-correcting code where physical qubits are arranged on a 2D grid. Errors are detected by measuring local \"stabilizer\" operators (called star and plaquette operators).\n*   **Logical Qubit:** A single quantum bit of information that is encoded across many physical qubits to protect it from errors. A logical qubit is defined by a pair of logical operators, a logical X ($X_L$) and a logical Z ($Z_L$), that act on the encoded state. These logical operators must commute with all the stabilizers but anticommute with each other.\n*   **Topological Encoding:** In a surface code, logical operators are \"non-trivial,\" meaning they cannot be expressed as a product of stabilizers. They typically correspond to strings or loops of single-qubit Pauli operators that stretch across the code or around topological features like holes or the entire surface (if it's a torus).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze a Single Patch of Surface Code**\n\n*   A \"patch\" of surface code is a finite, 2D area of the code, which is topologically equivalent to a disk. It has an outer boundary.\n*   A simple planar patch of surface code (without any holes) is typically used to encode **one** logical qubit. The logical operators are strings that connect different parts of the outer boundary.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Role of Holes**\n\n*   A \"hole\" is created in the surface code by intentionally not measuring a set of stabilizers in a specific region. This region effectively becomes a new, internal boundary within the patch.\n*   Holes introduce new non-trivial topological features. For each hole you create, you create a new independent \"cycle\" around which a logical operator can loop.\n*   The number of logical qubits that can be stored in a single patch of surface code is directly related to the number of holes it contains. The established formula for a single planar patch with *h* holes is:\n    *   Number of logical qubits, *k* = *h*\n\n*   **Why k = h?**\n    *   For each hole, we can define a distinct logical Z operator ($Z_L$) as a closed loop of Z-type Pauli operators around that specific hole.\n    *   For each such $Z_L$, we can define a corresponding logical X operator ($X_L$) as a string of X-type Pauli operators connecting that hole to the outer boundary of the patch.\n    *   For a patch with *h* holes, we can define *h* such pairs of ($X_L, Z_L$). These *h* pairs are independent and satisfy the commutation rules for *h* distinct logical qubits.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Capacity of the Given System**\n\nThe question specifies a system with two components:\n\n1.  **Patch 1:** A surface code patch with **two holes**.\n    *   Using the principle from Step 3, with *h₁* = 2, this patch can encode at most *k₁ = h₁ = 2* logical qubits.\n\n2.  **Patch 2:** A second surface code patch, also with **two holes**.\n    *   Similarly, with *h₂* = 2, this patch can also encode at most *k₂ = h₂ = 2* logical qubits.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Logical Qubits**\n\n*   The two patches are described as separate entities. This means they are not connected and operate independently.\n*   The total number of logical qubits that can be encoded in the entire system is the sum of the logical qubits that can be encoded in each independent part.\n*   Total logical qubits = (Qubits in Patch 1) + (Qubits in Patch 2)\n*   Total logical qubits = *k₁* + *k₂* = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Independence of Patches:** The calculation assumes the two patches are not connected. If they were connected by a bridge, they would form a single, more complex topological surface, and the counting rule would be different.\n*   **\"At Most\":** The question asks for the maximum number. The encoding scheme described (*k=h*) is the standard and most efficient way to use holes on a planar surface to store logical information. Therefore, this calculation gives the maximum capacity.\n*   **Hole Type:** The type of hole boundary (rough/smooth or Z/X) does not change the number of logical qubits that can be encoded, although it affects how the specific logical operators are constructed. The principle of *k=h* holds regardless.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  A single surface code patch with *h* holes can encode *h* logical qubits.\n2.  The first patch has 2 holes, so it can encode 2 logical qubits.\n3.  The second patch has 2 holes, so it can also encode 2 logical qubits.\n4.  Since the patches are separate, the total capacity is the sum of their individual capacities.\n5.  Total = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
