A finite group G is a "filled group" (meaning the union of its maximal product-free sets is G \\ {e}) if and only if it has zero or one element of order 2. A finite nilpotent group G satisfies this property if and only if it is of one of the following two types:
1.  **G has odd order.** This means G is a direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups, where all primes p are odd.
2.  **G is the direct product `S_2 × H`**, where `H` is a finite nilpotent group of odd order and `S_2` (the Sylow 2-subgroup of G) is a non-trivial **cyclic 2-group** (C_{2^n} for n ≥ 1) or a **generalized quaternion group** (Q_{2^m} for m ≥ 3).
