    "This problem asks for the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice. Let's break down the problem and the method for solving it.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** This is a 2D square grid, also known as the ZÂ² lattice. From any point (x, y), you can move to one of its four neighbors: (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), or (x, y-1).\n*   **Walk:** A sequence of points (vertices) on the lattice, where each point is a neighbor of the previous one. A walk of `n` steps consists of `n+1` vertices.\n*   **Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW):** A walk that never visits the same vertex more than once. All `n+1` vertices in the sequence must be unique.\n*   **a(n):** The number of distinct `n`-step self-avoiding walks starting from a fixed origin, say (0,0).\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points\n\n1.  **Starting Point:** By convention, all walks start at the origin (0,0). We are counting the number of distinct paths.\n2.  **Symmetry:** The lattice is highly symmetric. A walk starting by going Right has the same number of possible completions as a walk starting Up, Down, or Left. We can use this to simplify counting:\n    `a(n) = 4 * (number of n-step SAWs that start with a move to the Right)`\n3.  **No Simple Formula:** There is no known simple closed-form formula for `a(n)`. The number must be determined by enumeration, which becomes computationally intensive as `n` grows.\n4.  **Counting Method:** For small `n`, we can count by hand. For larger `n`, this requires a systematic search algorithm, like recursive backtracking, typically implemented on a computer.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis and Calculation for Small `n`\n\nLet's find the values of `a(n)` for the first few steps to illustrate the process.\n\n*   **a(1):**\n    From the origin (0,0), there are 4 possible first steps: Right, Left, Up, Down. All are valid 1-step SAWs.\n    *   `a(1) = 4`\n\n*   **a(2):**\n    Let's consider a walk starting with a \"Right\" move to (1,0). From (1,0), the possible moves are to (2,0), (1,1), (1,-1), or (0,0). The move back to (0,0) is forbidden as it revisits a vertex. So, there are 3 valid continuations.\n    By symmetry, each of the 4 initial moves has 3 valid continuations.\n    *   `a(2) = 4 * 3 = 12`\n\n*   **a(3):**\n    Continuing from the previous step, let's analyze the walks that start by going Right.\n    1.  Start with `(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0)`. From (2,0), we can't go to (1,0). Valid moves are to (3,0), (2,1), (2,-1). (3 paths)\n    2.  Start with `(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1)`. From (1,1), we can't go to (1,0). Valid moves are to (2,1), (1,2), (0,1). (3 paths)\n    3.  Start with `(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,-1)`. From (1,-1), we can't go to (1,0). Valid moves are to (2,-1), (1,-2), (0,-1). (3 paths)\n    The total number of 3-step SAWs starting with \"Right\" is `3 + 3 + 3 = 9`.\n    Therefore, the total number of 3-step SAWs is:\n    *   `a(3) = 4 * 9 = 36`\n\n*   **a(4):**\n    This is where paths can begin to close back on themselves in a more complex way. For example, the path `(0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(0,1)` is valid. From the endpoint (0,1), the possible moves are to `(0,0)`, `(-1,1)`, `(0,2)`, and `(1,1)`. Both `(0,0)` and `(1,1)` have already been visited, leaving only 2 valid continuations. Other paths of length 3 might have 3 valid continuations. A careful enumeration, typically via a computer program, shows there are 25 distinct 4-step SAWs starting with \"Right\".\n    *   `a(4) = 4 * 25 = 100`\n\n### Step 4: Acquiring the Answer for a(10)\n\nCalculating `a(10)` by hand is not feasible due to the exponential growth in the number of paths. The standard method is to use a recursive backtracking algorithm (a form of depth-first search) to explore all possible paths of length 10 and count the ones that are self-avoiding.\n\nThis is a well-studied problem in computational physics and combinatorics, and the values of `a(n)` have been computed and verified for `n` up to high numbers. We can use the established results from these computations. The sequence for `a(n)` is:\n\n*   `a(1) = 4`\n*   `a(2) = 12`\n*   `a(3) = 36`\n*   `a(4) = 100`\n*   `a(5) = 284`\n*   `a(6) = 780`\n*   `a(7) = 2172`\n*   `a(8) = 5916`\n*   `a(9) = 16268`\n*   **`a(10) = 44100`**\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, `a(10)`, is obtained by a systematic and exhaustive enumeration of all possible valid paths. Based on established computational results for this classic problem, the value is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
