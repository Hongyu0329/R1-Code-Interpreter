    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Constraints**\n\n*   **Board:** A standard 8x8 chessboard.\n*   **Pieces:** Bishops.\n*   **Placement Area:** Only the \"edge squares\" of the board.\n*   **Objective:** Place the maximum number of bishops on these edge squares.\n*   **Rule:** The placed bishops cannot attack each other. This means no two bishops can share the same diagonal.\n*   **Question:** After placing the maximum number of bishops, how many edge squares are left empty (lack bishops)?\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Count the Edge Squares**\n\nThe edge squares are all the squares on the first rank, last rank, 'a' file, and 'h' file.\n*   An 8x8 board has 8 squares on the top edge and 8 on the bottom edge.\n*   It has 8 squares on the left edge and 8 on the right edge.\n*   To avoid double-counting the 4 corner squares, the total number of edge squares is (8 + 8 + 8 + 8) - 4 = 28.\nSo, there are 28 total positions available for placement.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Bishop's Attack**\n\nA crucial property of a bishop is that it always stays on squares of the same color. A bishop on a light square can only attack other bishops on light squares, and a bishop on a dark square can only attack other bishops on dark squares. This allows us to solve the problem for each color independently.\n\n*   **Counting Edge Squares by Color:** The 28 edge squares are perfectly balanced between the two colors. There are **14 light-colored edge squares** and **14 dark-colored edge squares**.\n\n**Step 4: Maximize Bishops on Dark Squares**\n\nLet's find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on the 14 dark edge squares.\nThe dark edge squares are: a1, c1, e1, g1, a3, a5, a7, h2, h4, h6, b8, d8, f8, h8.\n\nIf we trace their diagonals, we find that they form connected attack groups:\n*   The corner square `a1` attacks the corner square `h8`. We can only place one bishop between these two squares.\n*   The squares `c1`, `a3`, `f8`, and `h6` all attack each other in a cycle. We can place a maximum of two non-attacking bishops on these four squares (for example, on `c1` and `f8`).\n*   The squares `e1`, `a5`, `d8`, and `h4` form a similar cycle. We can place a maximum of two bishops here (e.g., on `e1` and `d8`).\n*   The squares `g1`, `a7`, `b8`, and `h2` form the last cycle. We can place a maximum of two bishops here (e.g., on `g1` and `b8`).\n\nSumming these up: 1 (from the a1-h8 pair) + 2 + 2 + 2 = **7 bishops** on the dark squares.\n\n**Step 5: Maximize Bishops on Light Squares**\n\nThe situation for the 14 light edge squares is perfectly symmetrical to the dark squares.\n*   The corners `h1` and `a8` attack each other (1 bishop max).\n*   Four more groups exist, allowing 2 bishops each, just like the dark squares.\n*   Total maximum bishops on light squares = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **7 bishops**.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Total Number of Bishops and the Final Answer**\n\n*   **Maximum Total Bishops:** The maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is the sum of the maximums for each color: 7 (dark) + 7 (light) = **14 bishops**.\n\n*   **Empty Edge Squares:** The question asks how many edge squares would lack bishops.\n    *   Total edge squares: 28\n    *   Maximum bishops placed: 14\n    *   Edge squares lacking bishops = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
