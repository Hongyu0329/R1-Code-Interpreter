The post-reset covariance Σ' is computed from the pre-reset covariance Σ and the pre-reset deviation estimate δ using the formula: Σ' = J_l(δ) * Σ * J_l(δ)^T, where J_l(δ) is the left Jacobian of the SO(3) group. The exact expression for J_l(δ) is: J_l(δ) = I + (1 - cos(||δ||)) / ||δ||^2 * [δ]x + (||δ|| - sin(||δ||)) / ||δ||^3 * ([δ]x)^2, with I being the 3x3 identity matrix, ||δ|| the magnitude of the vector δ, and [δ]x the skew-symmetric matrix of δ.
