    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical linguistic developments.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form**\n\n*   **PIE Form:** `*seh₂gieti`\n*   **Root:** `*seh₂g-`. This is the 'e-grade' of the root. The `h₂` is a laryngeal consonant.\n*   **Suffix:** `-ieti`. This indicates a present tense verb of the *ye/yo-* class (a primary thematic verb). The `-ti` is the 3rd person singular ending.\n*   **Meaning:** '(s)he’s giving a sign' or 's/he perceives'. The cognates (Lat. `sāgīre` 'to be keen-nosed', Hitt. `sākizzi` 'gives a sign/omen') confirm this root and its general meaning.\n\n### **Step 2: From PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\nWe will apply the systematic sound changes that occurred as PIE evolved into Proto-Germanic.\n\n1.  **Laryngeal Effect:** The laryngeal `*h₂` colors an adjacent `*e` to `*a`. Thus, `*seh₂g-` becomes `*sah₂g-`. Then, the laryngeal lengthens the preceding vowel and disappears before a consonant. So, `*sah₂g-` becomes `*sāg-` (with a long *ā*).\n2.  **Grimm's Law:** This law describes a chain shift of stop consonants. The PIE voiced stop `*g` becomes the PGmc voiceless stop `*k`. Therefore, `*sāg-` becomes `*sāk-`.\n    *   **Careful Point (Verner's Law):** Verner's Law voices a voiceless fricative if the preceding vowel was unaccented in PIE. In `*seh₂giéti`, the accent is on the suffix, so Verner's Law should apply (`*g` > `*k` > `*g` [ɣ]). However, the Latin and Hittite cognates, as well as the surviving Germanic forms, point to a `*k` in Germanic. This implies that the form ancestral to Germanic had the accent on the root (`*séh₂g-`), which is a common type of accent shift in PIE verbs. Assuming root accent, Verner's Law does not apply, and we correctly get PGmc `*sāk-`.\n3.  **Verb Formation:** The PIE *ye/yo-* present becomes the Class 1 weak verb in Proto-Germanic. The infinitive suffix is `*-janą`.\n4.  **Final Proto-Germanic Form:** Combining the root `*sāk-` with the suffix `*-janą`, we get the infinitive **`*sākjaną`**.\n\n### **Step 3: From Proto-Germanic to Old Norse (ON)**\n\n1.  **Root Vowel:** PGmc `*ā` is subjected to **i-umlaut** (or i-mutation) caused by the following `*-j-` in the suffix. The `*ā` is fronted to `*ǣ` (a long \"ash\" sound, like in \"hat\" but long).\n2.  **Consonants:** The consonants `*s` and `*k` remain `s` and `k`. The `*j` is retained in Old Norse after a consonant.\n3.  **Ending:** The PGmc infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-a` in Old Norse.\n4.  **Final Old Norse Form:** `*sākjaną` > `*sǣkjan` > **`sækja`**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The common Old Norse verb for 'to seek' is `sœkja`, which derives from the o-grade `*sōkijaną`. The form `sækja` is the phonologically regular descendant of the given e-grade PIE form.\n\n### **Step 4: From Proto-Germanic to Old English (OE)**\n\n1.  **Root Vowel:** PGmc `*ā` first becomes `ǣ` in early Old English. This `ǣ` is then subjected to **i-umlaut** from the `*-j-`. The vowel remains `ǣ`.\n2.  **Consonants:** The PGmc `*k` undergoes **palatalization** before the front glide `*j`. It shifts from a /k/ sound to a /tʃ/ sound (like \"ch\" in \"church\"). This is written as `ċ` in Old English manuscripts.\n3.  **Suffix:** After causing umlaut and palatalization, the `*-j-` is lost in Old English when it follows a long/heavy syllable (like `*sāk-`). The infinitive ending becomes `-an`.\n4.  **Final Old English Form:** `*sākjaną` > `*sǣċjan` > **`sǣċan`**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This form is attested in Old English, often as a side-form of the more common `sēcan` ('to seek'), which derives from the o-grade `*sōkijaną`. `sǣċan` typically means 'to visit, attack, go to'.\n\n### **Step 5: From Proto-Germanic to Old High German (OHG)**\n\n1.  **Root Vowel:** The PGmc `*ā` is subject to **i-umlaut** from the `*-j-`. In Old High German, an umlauted long `*ā` becomes a long `*ē` (written `e`).\n2.  **Consonants:** The PGmc `*k` undergoes the **High German Consonant Shift**. After a vowel, `*k` shifts to the voiceless fricative `*hh` (pronounced /x/, like the \"ch\" in Scottish \"loch\"). This is written `hh` or `ch`.\n3.  **Suffix:** The infinitive ending becomes `-en` or `-an`.\n4.  **Final Old High German Form:** `*sākjaną` > (`*sāhhan` without umlaut) > (`*sæhhen` or `*sehhen` with umlaut). The combination of the shifted consonant and the umlauted vowel gives **`sehhen`**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Like in the other languages, this e-grade form is not the common survivor. The widely attested OHG verb for 'to seek' is `suohhen` (or `süechen` with umlaut), from the o-grade `*sōkijaną`. The form `sehhen` is the phonologically predicted result from the PIE form given in the question.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sākjaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sækja`\n*   **Old English:** `sǣċan`\n*   **Old High German:** `sehhen`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sākjaną, Old Norse: sækja, Old English: sǣċan, Old High German: sehhen>>>"
