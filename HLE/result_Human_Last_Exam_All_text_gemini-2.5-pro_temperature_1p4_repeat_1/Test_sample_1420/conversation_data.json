    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Epsilon (ϵ) Expansion\nThe epsilon expansion is a powerful technique within the renormalization group (RG) framework used to calculate critical exponents. The method involves performing calculations in a dimension `d` that is slightly below the upper critical dimension `d_c`. We define a small parameter `ϵ = d_c - d` and express the critical exponents as a power series in `ϵ`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Upper Critical Dimension (d_c)\nFor a large class of statistical models exhibiting continuous phase transitions, including the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models (which belong to the O(n) universality class), the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`. Above this dimension, fluctuations are negligible on large scales, and mean-field theory provides the correct critical exponents.\n\n### Step 3: Set up the Parameters for this Problem\nThe problem specifies a spatial dimension `d = 3`.\nUsing the upper critical dimension `d_c = 4`, we can calculate the expansion parameter `ϵ`:\n`ϵ = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1`\n\n**Careful Point:** Although `ϵ = 1` is not mathematically small, the epsilon expansion is often used in this way to obtain a first-order estimate for exponents in `d=3`. The results are surprisingly reasonable compared to more sophisticated calculations.\n\n### Step 4: Use the Hyperscaling Relation\nCritical exponents are not all independent; they are connected by scaling relations. The specific heat exponent `α` is related to the correlation length exponent `ν` and the spatial dimension `d` by the hyperscaling relation:\n`2 - α = νd`\nWe can rearrange this to solve for `α`:\n`α = 2 - νd`\n\n### Step 5: Find the Epsilon Expansion for the Correlation Length Exponent (ν)\nTo find `α`, we first need the epsilon expansion for `ν`. A one-loop RG calculation for the general O(n) model yields the following result for `ν`, to first order in `ϵ`:\n`ν ≈ 1/2 + (n+2) / (4(n+8)) * ϵ`\n\n**Careful Point:** The question does not specify the model (i.e., the value of `n`). In such cases, it is standard practice to assume the simplest and most common model for which these calculations are performed: the Ising model, which corresponds to `n=1`.\n\nFor the Ising model (`n=1`), the expression for `ν` becomes:\n`ν ≈ 1/2 + (1+2) / (4(1+8)) * ϵ = 1/2 + 3 / 36 * ϵ = 1/2 + 1/12 * ϵ`\n\n### Step 6: Derive the Epsilon Expansion for α\nNow we substitute the expansions for `d = 4 - ϵ` and `ν` into the hyperscaling relation `α = 2 - νd`. We will keep terms only up to the first order in `ϵ`.\n\n`α = 2 - (1/2 + 1/12 * ϵ) * (4 - ϵ)`\n`α = 2 - [ (1/2 * 4) - (1/2 * ϵ) + (1/12 * ϵ * 4) - (1/12 * ϵ * ϵ) ]`\n`α = 2 - [ 2 - 1/2 * ϵ + 1/3 * ϵ + O(ϵ^2) ]`\n`α = 2 - 2 - (-1/2 + 1/3) * ϵ + O(ϵ^2)`\n`α = - (-3/6 + 2/6) * ϵ + O(ϵ^2)`\n`α = - (-1/6) * ϵ + O(ϵ^2)`\n`α = 1/6 * ϵ + O(ϵ^2)`\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the Final Answer\nWe now have a first-order expression for `α` in terms of `ϵ`: `α ≈ 1/6 * ϵ`.\nUsing the value `ϵ = 1` which corresponds to `d=3`, we get our final estimate for the specific heat exponent:\n`α ≈ 1/6 * (1) = 1/6`\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
