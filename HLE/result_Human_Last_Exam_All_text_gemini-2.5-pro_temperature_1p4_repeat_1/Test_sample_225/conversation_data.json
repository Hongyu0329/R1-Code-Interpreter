    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations x = cos(9t) and y = sin(5t).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe need to find the number of distinct points (x, y) where the curve C(t) = (cos(9t), sin(5t)) crosses itself. A self-intersection occurs at a point P if there exist two different time values, t1 and t2, such that C(t1) = C(t2) = P.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Period of the Curve**\nFirst, we find the period of the entire curve. The period is the least common multiple (LCM) of the individual periods of the x and y components.\n- The period of x(t) = cos(9t) is T_x = 2π / 9.\n- The period of y(t) = sin(5t) is T_y = 2π / 5.\nThe period of the curve C(t) is T = LCM(T_x, T_y) = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5).\nSince 9 and 5 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), T = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π * (1 / GCD(9,5)) = 2π.\nSo, the entire curve is traced for t in the interval [0, 2π). We look for self-intersections within this interval.\n\n**Step 3: Set up the Equations for Self-Intersection**\nA self-intersection occurs when C(t1) = C(t2) for 0 ≤ t1 < t2 < 2π. This gives the system of equations:\n1.  cos(9*t1) = cos(9*t2)\n2.  sin(5*t1) = sin(5*t2)\n\n**Step 4: Solve the Trigonometric Equations**\nThe general solutions to these equations for integers k and m are:\n1.  9*t1 = ± 9*t2 + 2kπ\n2.  5*t1 = 5*t2 + 2mπ  OR  5*t1 = π - 5*t2 + 2mπ\n\nSince t1 ≠ t2, we can exclude trivial solutions. We must analyze the combinations of these conditions.\n\nThis algebraic method is quite lengthy and prone to errors in counting the unique points from the pairs of solutions (t1, t2). A more direct method is to use known results for Lissajous curves.\n\n**Step 5: Use the Formula for Lissajous Curves**\nThe curve described by x = cos(at) and y = sin(bt) is a type of Lissajous curve. There are established formulas for the number of self-intersection points, which depend on the integers a and b.\n\nFor a curve given by x = cos(at), y = sin(bt), where a and b are coprime integers (GCD(a,b)=1), the number of self-intersection points (N) is given by:\nN = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\nIn our case, a = 9 and b = 5.\nFirst, check if they are coprime: GCD(9, 5) = 1. Yes, they are.\nBoth a=9 and b=5 are odd integers. The formula holds for this case.\n\nNow, we apply the formula:\nN = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nN = (8)(4) / 2\nN = 32 / 2\nN = 16\n\n**Step 6: Sanity Check (Optional but Recommended)**\nWe can perform a partial analysis to check if the result is plausible. Let's count the number of self-intersections that lie on the coordinate axes.\n\n*   **Intersections on the x-axis (y=0):**\n    y = sin(5t) = 0  =>  5t = kπ  =>  t = kπ/5 for an integer k.\n    For t in [0, 2π), k can be 0, 1, 2, ..., 9.\n    A self-intersection occurs if two different values t1 = k1π/5 and t2 = k2π/5 give the same x-value, i.e., cos(9*t1) = cos(9*t2).\n    cos(9*k1*π/5) = cos(9*k2*π/5).\n    This implies 9k1π/5 = ±9k2π/5 + 2mπ, which simplifies to 9(k1 ± k2) = 10m.\n    Since GCD(9, 10) = 1, k1 ± k2 must be a multiple of 10.\n    With t1 < t2, we must have k1+k2 = 10. (k1-k2 cannot be 10 as k1,k2 are in {1,...,9} for intersections inside the interval).\n    The pairs (k1, k2) are: (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6).\n    These 4 pairs lead to 4 distinct intersection points on the x-axis: (cos(9π/5), 0), (cos(18π/5), 0), (cos(27π/5), 0), (cos(36π/5), 0). These are (cos(π/5),0), (cos(2π/5),0), (-cos(2π/5),0), (-cos(π/5),0). So, 4 points.\n\n*   **Intersections on the y-axis (x=0):**\n    x = cos(9t) = 0  =>  9t = (k + 1/2)π  =>  t = (2k+1)π/18.\n    For t in [0, 2π), k can be 0, 1, ..., 17.\n    A self-intersection occurs if sin(5*t1) = sin(5*t2).\n    sin(5(2k1+1)π/18) = sin(5(2k2+1)π/18).\n    This implies 5(2k1+1)π/18 = π - 5(2k2+1)π/18 + 2mπ.\n    This simplifies to 10(k1+k2+1) = 18(2m+1) => 5(k1+k2+1) = 9(2m+1).\n    So, k1+k2+1 must be an odd multiple of 9.\n    k1+k2+1 = 9 => k1+k2 = 8. Pairs: (0,8), (1,7), (2,6), (3,5). This gives 4 distinct intersection points.\n    k1+k2+1 = 27 => k1+k2 = 26. Pairs: (9,17), (10,16), (11,15), (12,14). This gives another 4 distinct intersection points (the negative y-values of the first set).\n    In total, there are 8 self-intersection points on the y-axis.\n\nSo far, we have found 4 + 8 = 12 intersection points on the axes. The formula gives a total of 16. This implies there are 16 - 12 = 4 intersection points that are not on the axes. Given the symmetry of the curve (C(π-t) = (-x,y), C(-t)=(x,-y)), these 4 points would form a symmetric set (±x₀, ±y₀). This makes the result from the formula highly plausible.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe number of self-intersection points for the curve C(t) = (cos(9t), sin(5t)) is 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
