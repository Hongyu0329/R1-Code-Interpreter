    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Ensemble**\n\n*   **System:** We are given a quantum system with a Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$.\n*   **Ensemble:** The system is in the grand canonical ensemble.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the grand canonical partition function, $Z$.\n*   **Method:** We must use the path integral formalism.\n\n**2. Interpret the Hamiltonian**\n\n*   The grand canonical partition function is defined as $Z = \\text{Tr} \\left( e^{-\\beta (\\hat{H}_0 - \\mu \\hat{N})} \\right)$, where $\\hat{H}_0$ is the intrinsic Hamiltonian of the system (kinetic + potential energy), $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $\\hat{N}$ is the number operator.\n*   The problem states the Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. This is an unusual but crucial simplification. We will interpret this to mean that the intrinsic Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0 = 0$. This describes a system where particles do not have any kinetic or potential energy; their only contribution to the grand canonical operator $K = \\hat{H}_0 - \\mu \\hat{N}$ comes from their presence, as measured by the chemical potential.\n*   Under this interpretation, the operator we need to trace is $e^{-\\beta (0 - \\mu \\hat{N})} = e^{\\beta \\mu \\hat{N}}$.\n*   So, we need to calculate $Z = \\text{Tr} \\left( e^{\\beta \\mu \\hat{N}} \\right)$.\n\n**3. Formulate the Path Integral**\n\n*   The partition function $Z$ can be expressed as a functional integral over fields $\\phi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$ (for bosons) or Grassmann fields $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$ (for fermions), where $\\tau$ is the imaginary time variable running from $0$ to $\\beta = 1/k_B T$.\n*   The general form is $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\phi^*, \\phi] e^{-S[\\phi^*, \\phi]}$, where $S$ is the Euclidean action.\n*   The action $S$ is derived from the operator $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_0 - \\mu \\hat{N}$. In our case, $\\hat{K} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$.\n*   The number operator in second quantization is $\\hat{N} = \\int d^d x \\, \\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger(\\mathbf{x}) \\hat{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x})$.\n*   The standard procedure for deriving the action for an operator $\\hat{K} = \\int d^d x \\, \\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger(\\mathbf{x}) \\hat{k} \\hat{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x})$ gives:\n    $S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi^*(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\hat{k}) \\phi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$.\n*   For our system, $\\hat{k} = -\\mu$. Therefore, the Euclidean action is:\n    $S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi^*(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\phi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Path Integral**\n\n*   The partition function is now a Gaussian integral over the fields:\n    $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\phi^*, \\phi] \\exp\\left( -\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi^* (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\phi \\right)$.\n*   The value of such a Gaussian integral is related to the determinant of the operator in the quadratic form. The result depends on whether the fields are complex numbers (bosons) or Grassmann numbers (fermions).\n    *   **For Bosons:** $Z_B = \\frac{1}{\\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)} = [\\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)]^{-1}$.\n    *   **For Fermions:** $Z_F = \\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)$.\n*   We can evaluate the determinant using the identity $\\det(M) = \\exp(\\text{Tr}(\\ln M))$.\n    *   $\\ln Z = \\mp \\text{Tr} \\ln(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)$. (Upper sign '-' for bosons, lower sign '+' for fermions).\n\n**5. Diagonalize the Operator and Sum Over States**\n\n*   The trace is computed by summing the eigenvalues of the operator $\\ln(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)$. We work in a basis that diagonalizes the operator, which is the basis of plane waves in both space and imaginary time (Fourier basis).\n*   In this basis, the operator $\\partial_\\tau$ becomes multiplication by $-i\\omega_n$, where $\\omega_n$ are the Matsubara frequencies. The operator $(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)$ becomes $(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)$.\n*   The trace is a sum over all single-particle states (labeled by an index $k$, e.g., momentum) and all Matsubara frequencies $n$.\n    $\\ln Z = \\mp \\sum_k \\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)$.\n*   This sum over Matsubara frequencies is a standard calculation in many-body physics. The result is:\n    $\\ln Z = \\mp \\sum_k \\ln(1 \\mp e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)})$.\n    Here, $\\epsilon_k$ would be the single-particle energy for the state $k$.\n\n**6. Apply the Specific Condition $\\hat{H}_0=0$**\n\n*   In our specific problem, the intrinsic Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$ is zero. This means all single-particle energy levels are zero: $\\epsilon_k = 0$ for all $k$.\n*   Substituting $\\epsilon_k = 0$ into the general result:\n    *   **For Bosons:** $\\ln Z_B = - \\sum_k \\ln(1 - e^{\\beta \\mu})$.\n    *   **For Fermions:** $\\ln Z_F = \\sum_k \\ln(1 + e^{\\beta \\mu})$.\n\n**7. Find the Final Expression for Z**\n\n*   To get the partition function $Z$, we exponentiate the logarithm:\n    *   **For Bosons:**\n        $Z_B = \\exp \\left( - \\sum_k \\ln(1 - e^{\\beta \\mu}) \\right) = \\exp \\left( \\sum_k \\ln \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta \\mu}} \\right) \\right) = \\prod_k \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta \\mu}}$.\n    *   **For Fermions:**\n        $Z_F = \\exp \\left( \\sum_k \\ln(1 + e^{\\beta \\mu}) \\right) = \\prod_k (1 + e^{\\beta \\mu})$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Interpretation of the Hamiltonian:** The primary assumption is that the given $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$ represents the full operator in the grand canonical exponent, i.e., $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_0 - \\mu\\hat{N}$ with $\\hat{H}_0=0$. Any other interpretation would change the result.\n2.  **Particle Statistics:** The question does not specify whether the particles are bosons or fermions. The path integral formalism and the final result are different for the two cases. The use of complex fields $\\phi$ implies bosons, while Grassmann fields $\\psi$ imply fermions. Both answers are derived for completeness.\n3.  **Sum/Product over States:** The index $k$ in $\\prod_k$ represents a complete set of single-particle quantum states (e.g., momentum and spin). The exact value of $Z$ depends on how many such states exist. The expression is left in its general form as a product over these states.\n4.  **Convergence Condition for Bosons:** The result for bosons involves the term $1/(1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})$. This expression is derived from a geometric series that only converges if $|e^{\\beta\\mu}| < 1$, which implies $\\beta\\mu < 0$, or $\\mu < 0$. This is a physical stability condition for an ideal gas of bosons, ensuring the occupation of any state doesn't diverge.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nSince the particle statistics (boson or fermion) were not specified, we provide the answer for both cases.\n\n**For a system of bosons:**\nThe partition function is a product over all single-particle states $k$:\n$Z_B = \\prod_k \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta \\mu}}$\n\n**For a system of fermions:**\nThe partition function is a product over all single-particle states $k$:\n$Z_F = \\prod_k (1 + e^{\\beta \\mu})$\n\n<<<For bosons, the partition function is $Z_B = \\prod_k \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta \\mu}}$. For fermions, it is $Z_F = \\prod_k (1 + e^{\\beta \\mu})$. In both expressions, the product is taken over all single-particle states $k$.>>>"
