  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Problem and Relevant Information\nThe question asks for the maximum possible length of a secret message. This is an information coding problem. We need to extract the parameters required to solve it from the provided text.\n\n*   **Encoding Source (Codewords):** The message is encrypted using the 9999 symbols from the Ching.\n    *   Total number of symbols available (L): 9999.\n*   **Encoding Alphabet (Symbols):** The symbols are of the \"yinyang-wuxing\" type.\n    *   Yinyang has 2 possibilities (yin, yang).\n    *   Wuxing has 5 possibilities (metal, wood, water, fire, earth).\n    *   The number of unique symbols in the encoding alphabet (K) is `2 * 5 = 10`.\n*   **Message Alphabet (Characters):** The message is written using letters from the Shu, specifically the 120 most common characters.\n    *   The number of unique characters to be encoded (N) is 120.\n\n### Step 2: Identify and Discard Irrelevant Information\nThe problem contains several details that are not needed to calculate the maximum message length. These are likely included to make the problem seem more complex.\n\n*   The Shu book containing \"around 3000 ancient Chinese characters\" is context, but the actual alphabet size for the message is 120.\n*   The computer vision recognition time (12 ms).\n*   The computation time for integer and float operations (10 ns and 30 ns).\n\nThese details would be relevant if the question was about the time taken to process or decode the message, but it only asks for the maximum possible length.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Encoding Requirement\nTo have a secret message, we need an encoding scheme that maps each of the 120 Chinese characters to a unique sequence of the 10 yinyang-wuxing symbols. The goal is to maximize the number of characters we can represent using the 9999 available symbols. This means we must find the most efficient encoding possible.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate a Fixed-Length Encoding Scheme\nThe simplest way to encode the characters is to assign a codeword of a fixed length, `c`, to each of the 120 characters.\n\n*   The number of unique codewords of length `c` using 10 symbols is `10^c`.\n*   This must be large enough to represent all 120 characters: `10^c >= 120`.\n*   Let's test values for `c`:\n    *   If `c = 1`, `10^1 = 10` (not enough).\n    *   If `c = 2`, `10^2 = 100` (not enough).\n    *   If `c = 3`, `10^3 = 1000` (this is sufficient).\n*   So, using a fixed-length code, each character requires 3 symbols.\n*   The maximum message length would be the total symbols divided by the symbols per character: `floor(9999 / 3) = 3333` characters.\n\nThis gives us one possible answer, but we must check if a more efficient scheme (a variable-length code) could yield a longer message.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate a Variable-Length Encoding Scheme\nA variable-length code (like a Huffman code) can be more efficient. The question asks for the **max length of this message**, implying we can construct a specific message that is as long as possible. Such a message would be composed entirely of the characters that are assigned the shortest possible codewords.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the minimum possible length for any codeword in a scheme that must be able to represent all 120 characters. The existence of a valid prefix code is governed by Kraft's inequality:  \n`Sum_{i=1 to N} (K^(-c_i)) <= 1`  \nwhere `N=120`, `K=10`, and `c_i` is the length of the codeword for character `i`.\n\n*   **Can any codeword have length 1?**\n    *   Let's assume `n_1` characters have length 1. To represent all 120 characters, the other `120 - n_1` characters must have a length of at least 2.\n    *   Applying Kraft's inequality: `n_1 * (10^-1) + (120 - n_1) * (10^-2) <= 1`.\n    *   `0.1*n_1 + 1.2 - 0.01*n_1 <= 1`\n    *   `0.09*n_1 <= -0.2`.\n    *   This is impossible for any non-negative `n_1`. So, no character can be encoded with a single symbol.\n\n*   **Therefore, the minimum possible codeword length is 2.**\n\nNow, we must check if a valid code can be constructed where at least some characters have a length of 2.\n\n*   Let's try to assign `n_2` characters a length of 2 and the remaining `n_3 = 120 - n_2` characters a length of 3.\n*   Kraft's inequality: `n_2 * (10^-2) + n_3 * (10^-3) <= 1`.\n*   Multiply by 1000: `10*n_2 + n_3 <= 1000`.\n*   Substitute `n_3 = 120 - n_2`: `10*n_2 + (120 - n_2) <= 1000`.\n*   `9*n_2 <= 880` => `n_2 <= 97.77...`\n*   This shows it is possible to construct a valid code where up to 97 characters are assigned a 2-symbol codeword, with the rest having longer codewords (e.g., length 3).\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Final Maximum Message Length\nSince a valid encoding scheme can be created where the shortest codewords have a length of 2, a message designed to be maximally long would consist only of characters assigned these 2-symbol codes.\n\n*   Total available symbols: 9999.\n*   Symbols used per character in this optimal message: 2.\n*   Maximum message length = `floor(Total Symbols / Symbols per Character)`.\n*   Maximum message length = `floor(9999 / 2) = floor(4999.5) = 4999`.\n\nA message of 4999 characters would use `4999 * 2 = 9998` symbols, which is within the 9999 symbol limit.\n\n<<<4999>>>"
