    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Artist and her Subject Matter**: The question refers to Lady Butler, whose full name was Elizabeth Southerden Butler (1846–1933). She was a renowned British painter famous for her military scenes. The key is to analyze the historical events she painted, not when she painted them.\n\n2.  **List Major Paintings and the Historical Battles Depicted**: We need to compile a list of her significant works and the dates of the battles they portray.\n\n    *   ***Scotland Forever!*** (painted in 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the **Battle of Waterloo**, which occurred on **June 18, 1815**.\n    *   ***The Remnants of an Army*** (painted in 1879): Depicts the arrival of Assistant Surgeon William Brydon at Jalalabad, the lone European survivor of the **1842 retreat from Kabul** during the First Anglo-Afghan War.\n    *   ***The Roll Call*** (painted in 1874): Shows a roll call of the Grenadier Guards after the **Battle of Inkerman**, fought on **November 5, 1854**, during the Crimean War.\n    *   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted in 1880): Portrays the famous defence of the mission station during the **Battle of Rorke's Drift** on **January 22–23, 1879**, in the Anglo-Zulu War.\n    *   ***Tel-el-Kebir*** (painted in 1885): Depicts the British storming Egyptian positions at the **Battle of Tel El Kebir** on **September 13, 1882**, during the Anglo-Egyptian War.\n    *   ***Rescue of the Wounded on the Retreat from Maiwand*** (c. 1905): Depicts an event from the **Battle of Maiwand** on **July 27, 1880**.\n    *   ***The Irish Guards after the First Battle of Ypres***: Lady Butler lived through World War I and created paintings depicting it. This work shows soldiers from the **First Battle of Ypres**, which took place from **October 19 to November 22, 1914**. Another of her WWI paintings is ***In the Retreat from Mons***, depicting an event from **August 1914**.\n\n3.  **Compare the Dates of the Battles**: Now, we arrange the historical events in chronological order to find the latest one.\n    *   Battle of Waterloo: **1815**\n    *   Retreat from Kabul: **1842**\n    *   Battle of Inkerman: **1854**\n    *   Battle of Rorke's Drift: **1879**\n    *   Battle of Maiwand: **1880**\n    *   Battle of Tel El Kebir: **1882**\n    *   Retreat from Mons: **August 1914**\n    *   First Battle of Ypres: **October-November 1914**\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: Comparing the dates, the latest historical battle depicted in a known painting by Lady Butler is the First Battle of Ypres, which occurred in late 1914.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguish Painting Date from Event Date**: It is crucial not to confuse the year the painting was created with the year the historical event took place. For example, *Scotland Forever!* was painted in 1881, but the Battle of Waterloo it depicts was in 1815.\n*   **Comprehensive Search of Works**: The answer depends on considering her entire body of work, including her later paintings of World War I, which are less famous than her Victorian-era masterpieces.\n*   **Specificity of the Title**: Titles like *The Irish Guards after the First Battle of Ypres* are very specific and directly link the painting to a dated event, making identification straightforward.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the latest historical battle Lady Butler depicted was the First Battle of Ypres.\n\n<<<First Battle of Ypres>>>"
