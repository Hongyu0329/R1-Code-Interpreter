    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe question asks for the surname of an English poet. This surname appears in a specific context: within the Russian translation of an essay, specifically in a passage describing the wide boulevards of Vienna.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key clues**\n1.  **Source:** A \"certain essay\" in its \"Russian translation.\"\n2.  **Setting:** The description of the \"wide boulevards of Vienna.\"\n3.  **Subject:** The surname of an \"English poet.\"\n4.  **Language:** The connection is made within the Russian language, which suggests the answer may involve a pun, wordplay, or a specific cultural reference understood by a Russian-speaking audience.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the literary source and reference**\nThe question refers to a famous passage from the essay \"A Guide to a Renamed City\" (\"Путеводитель по переименованному городу\") by the Russian-American Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky. While the essay is about St. Petersburg (specifically Nevsky Prospekt), it makes a comparison to Vienna to emphasize the grandeur of the Russian city's main street.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the specific reference and wordplay**\nThe reference is an allusion to a very famous line from Nikolai Gogol's novel \"Dead Souls,\" which describes the Dnieper River: \"Редкая **птица** долетит до середины Днепра\" (Redkaya **ptitsa** doletit do serediny Dnyepra), meaning \"A rare **bird** will fly to the middle of the Dnieper.\"\n\nIn his essay, Brodsky adapts this famous line to describe the vastness of Vienna's boulevards. He substitutes the word **\"птица\" (ptitsa - bird)** with the surname of an English poet that serves a similar function in the phrase. The substituted line reads something like: \"не всякий **Байрон** перелетит до середины\" (ne vsyakiy **Bayron** pereletit do serediny), meaning \"not every **Byron** will fly over to the middle.\"\n\n**Step 5: Explain the connection and identify the poet**\nBrodsky replaces \"bird\" with \"Byron.\" Lord Byron, the famous English Romantic poet, is chosen for this substitution. The wordplay works on multiple levels:\n*   It elevates the comparison from a simple bird to a towering figure of Romanticism, known for his grand passions and \"high-flying\" spirit.\n*   In Russian, \"Байрон\" (Bayron) can be seen as a clever, intellectual replacement for \"птица\" (ptitsa) in the classic Gogol phrase.\n\nTherefore, the English poet whose surname is used is Lord Byron.\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer Formulation**\nThe question asks for the surname in English. Based on the analysis, the surname is Byron.\n\n<<<Byron>>>"
