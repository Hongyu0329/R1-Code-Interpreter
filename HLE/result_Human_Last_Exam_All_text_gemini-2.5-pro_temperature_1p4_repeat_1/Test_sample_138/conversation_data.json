    "Answering this question requires knowledge from the mathematical theory of integral lattices, also known as integral quadratic forms.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:**\n    We are looking for the number of isomorphism classes of lattices $L$ with the following properties:\n    *   **Lattice:** A discrete subgroup of $\\mathbb{R}^{17}$ that spans it.\n    *   **Positive definite:** For any non-zero vector $v \\in L$, its squared norm $(v, v)$ is positive.\n    *   **Even:** For any vector $v \\in L$, its squared norm $(v, v)$ is an even integer. (These are also known as Type II lattices).\n    *   **Dimension:** The dimension of the real vector space $\\mathbb{R}^{17}$ that $L$ spans is 17.\n    *   **Determinant:** The determinant of the Gram matrix of any basis for $L$ is 2. The Gram matrix is formed by the inner products of basis vectors, $G_{ij} = (b_i, b_j)$.\n\n2.  **Check for existence using theoretical constraints:**\n    There is a fundamental relationship between the dimension ($n$), signature ($\\sigma$), and determinant ($d$) of an even lattice. The signature of a positive definite lattice is just its dimension, so $\\sigma=n=17$. The relation can be expressed via the Gau√ü-Milgram sum formula:\n    $$ \\exp\\left(\\frac{i\\pi\\sigma}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{x \\in L^*/L} \\exp(i\\pi(x,x)) $$\n    where $L^*$ is the dual lattice of $L$.\n    *   For our lattice, $n = 17$, $\\sigma = 17$, and $d = 2$.\n    *   The discriminant group $L^*/L$ has order $d=2$, so $L^*/L \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. It has two elements: the trivial element 0 and a generator $g$.\n    *   The left-hand side (LHS) of the formula is: $\\exp(i\\pi \\cdot 17/4) = \\exp(i(4\\pi + \\pi/4)) = \\exp(i\\pi/4) = \\frac{1+i}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n    *   The right-hand side (RHS) is: $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (\\exp(i\\pi(0,0)) + \\exp(i\\pi(g,g))) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (1 + \\exp(i\\pi q_L(g)))$, where $q_L(g) = (g,g) \\pmod{2}$ is the value of the discriminant quadratic form.\n    *   Equating the two sides: $\\frac{1+i}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (1 + \\exp(i\\pi q_L(g)))$.\n    *   This simplifies to $1+i = 1 + \\exp(i\\pi q_L(g))$, which means $\\exp(i\\pi q_L(g)) = i$.\n    *   This implies $\\pi q_L(g) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for some integer $k$, so $q_L(g) \\equiv \\frac{1}{2} \\pmod{2}$.\n    *   This result implies two things:\n        a) Such lattices can exist because there is a valid solution. A contradiction here would have meant no such lattices exist.\n        b) The discriminant form is uniquely determined by the other properties.\n\n3.  **Genus and Class Number:**\n    Lattices are classified into genera. All lattices in a genus are locally isomorphic at all primes. The properties of dimension, determinant, and discriminant form determine the genus. Since we found that the discriminant form is uniquely determined, all lattices satisfying the question's conditions must belong to the *same genus*.\n    The question then becomes: \"What is the number of isomorphism classes (the class number) in this specific genus?\"\n\n4.  **Finding the number of classes:**\n    The problem of calculating class numbers is generally difficult. However, the classification of lattices of small dimension and determinant is a known result in number theory, with key contributions from mathematicians like Kneser, Eichler, Borcherds, Conway, and Sloane.\n    For positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2, the classification is known. We can construct some of the classes to demonstrate that the number is greater than one.\n\n5.  **Constructing the lattice classes:**\n    We can construct lattices by taking the orthogonal direct sum ($\\oplus$) of known lattices.\n    *   Let $A_1$ be the root lattice of dimension 1. Its Gram matrix is (2). It is even, positive definite, and has determinant 2.\n    *   Let $E_8$ be the exceptional root lattice. It is an even, positive definite, unimodular (determinant 1) lattice of dimension 8.\n    *   There are two non-isomorphic even unimodular positive definite lattices of dimension 16: $E_8 \\oplus E_8$ and $D_{16}^+$ (the Barnes-Wall lattice BW$_{16}$).\n\n    This allows us to construct two candidates for our required lattice type:\n    *   **Lattice 1 ($L_1$):** $(E_8 \\oplus E_8) \\oplus A_1$.\n        *   Dimension: $8+8+1 = 17$.\n        *   Determinant: $\\det(E_8) \\times \\det(E_8) \\times \\det(A_1) = 1 \\times 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n        *   It is an orthogonal sum of even, positive definite lattices, so it is also even and positive definite.\n        This is a valid lattice.\n\n    *   **Lattice 2 ($L_2$):** $D_{16}^+ \\oplus A_1$.\n        *   Dimension: $16+1 = 17$.\n        *   Determinant: $\\det(D_{16}^+) \\times \\det(A_1) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n        *   It is also even and positive definite for the same reasons.\n        This is another valid lattice.\n\n6.  **Distinguishing the classes:**\n    $L_1$ and $L_2$ are non-isomorphic. A simple way to see this is to consider the sublattice generated by their \"roots\" (vectors of norm 2).\n    *   For $L_1 = (E_8 \\oplus E_8) \\oplus A_1$, the lattice is generated by its roots. The root system is $2E_8 \\oplus A_1$.\n    *   For $L_2 = D_{16}^+ \\oplus A_1$, the root system is $D_{16} \\oplus A_1$. The lattice $D_{16}^+$ properly contains the lattice $D_{16}$ (which is generated by the roots of $D_{16}$). Therefore, $L_2$ is not generated by its roots.\n    *   Since one lattice is generated by its roots and the other is not, they cannot be isomorphic. So there are at least 2 such lattices.\n\n7.  **Consulting the literature:**\n    The complete classification shows that there is one more class. According to the classification work initiated in J.H. Conway and N.J.A. Sloane's papers and R. Borcherds' Ph.D. thesis, the class number for this genus is 3. The third lattice is indecomposable (it cannot be written as an orthogonal direct sum) and can be constructed as a \"neighbor\" of one of the other two lattices.\n\n### Final conclusion:\nThere is a single genus of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2. The number of isomorphism classes within this genus is 3. Two of these are decomposable, and one is indecomposable."
