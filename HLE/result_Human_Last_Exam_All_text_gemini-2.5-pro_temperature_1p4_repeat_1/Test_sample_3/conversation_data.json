    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWe are asked to find the maximum possible size (order) of the torsion subgroup, $E(K)_{tors}$, for an elliptic curve $E$ defined over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, with the condition that this subgroup must be non-cyclic.\n\n*   **Elliptic Curve and Torsion Subgroup:** For an elliptic curve $E$ over a field $K$, the set of $K$-rational points $E(K)$ forms an abelian group. The torsion subgroup, $E(K)_{tors}$, consists of all points of finite order in $E(K)$.\n*   **Structure of the Torsion Subgroup:** By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, the torsion subgroup $E(K)_{tors}$ is isomorphic to a group of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/n_1\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n_2\\mathbb{Z}$, where $n_1$ is a divisor of $n_2$.\n*   **Non-cyclic Condition:** A group of this form is non-cyclic if and only if $n_1 > 1$.\n*   **The Field:** The base field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This is an imaginary quadratic field of degree 2 over $\\mathbb{Q}$. It is also the third cyclotomic field, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$, since $\\zeta_3 = \\frac{-1+\\sqrt{-3}}{2}$. This field is special because it is a field of complex multiplication (CM) for elliptic curves with j-invariant 0.\n\n### Step 2: Recall the Classification Theorems\nThe possible structures of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields are highly constrained.\n*   **Mazur's Theorem** classifies torsion subgroups over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Merel's Theorem** provides a uniform bound on the order of torsion points for all elliptic curves over number fields of a fixed degree.\n*   For quadratic fields, a complete classification of all possible torsion subgroups is known, due to the work of Kamienny, Kenku, Momose, and others. For the specific field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, an explicit list of possibilities has been determined (e.g., by F. Najman in \"Torsion of elliptic curves over quadratic cyclotomic fields\").\n\n### Step 3: List Possible Non-Cyclic Torsion Subgroups for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$\nAccording to the classification for the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups are of the following types:\n1.  $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$\n2.  $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$\n3.  $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe specific values of $N$ that can occur for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are known.\n\n**Careful Point:** The fact that $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is a CM field is crucial. The existence of a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$ for $m \\ge 3$ on an elliptic curve $E/K$ forces $E$ to have CM by an order in an imaginary quadratic field $K'$, and furthermore, $K'$ must be a subfield of $K$. For $m=3$ or $m=6$, this requires CM by $\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-3}}{2}]$, which means $K' = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. Since our base field is indeed $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, these larger torsion structures are possible. In contrast, a group like $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ would require CM by $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, so the base field would have to contain $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$, which $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ does not.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Orders of Possible Groups\nLet's list the specific non-cyclic groups that can be realized over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ and calculate their orders.\n\n1.  **Type $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$**: For $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible values for $N$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6$.\n    *   $N=1$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    *   $N=2$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n    *   $N=3$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $2 \\times 6 = 12$.\n    *   $N=4$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $2 \\times 8 = 16$.\n    *   $N=6$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $2 \\times 12 = 24$.\n    The largest order in this family is **24**.\n\n2.  **Type $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$**: For $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible values for $N$ are $1, 2, 3$.\n    *   $N=1$: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n    *   $N=2$: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $3 \\times 6 = 18$.\n    *   $N=3$: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $3 \\times 9 = 27$.\n    The largest order in this family is **27**.\n\n3.  **Type $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$**: For $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the group $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ is possible.\n    *   Its order is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n    The order in this family is **36**.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Maximum Order\nWe now compare the largest orders found in each family of possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups:\n*   From type 1: 24\n*   From type 2: 27\n*   From type 3: 36\n\nThe maximum among these values is 36.\n\nTherefore, the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 36.\n\n<<<36>>>"
