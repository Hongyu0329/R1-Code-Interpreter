    "This problem asks for the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a specific conductor $N$ and order $6$. Let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties of Primitive Dirichlet Characters\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely factored into a product of characters based on the prime factorization of $N$. Let the prime factorization of $N$ be $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$. Then, any character $\\chi \\pmod{N}$ can be written as $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\nTwo crucial properties are:\n1.  **Conductor:** The character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$ is primitive modulo $N$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$. The conductor of $\\chi$ is $N$.\n2.  **Order:** The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_k))$.\n\nWe need to find the number of combinations of primitive characters $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_k)$ such that their lcm of orders is exactly 6.\n\n### Step 2: Factorize the Conductor N\n\nThe given conductor is $N = 36036$. We find its prime factorization:\n$N = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\nSo, we are looking for characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$ where:\n*   $\\chi_1$ is a primitive character modulo $2^2=4$.\n*   $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character modulo $3^2=9$.\n*   $\\chi_3$ is a primitive character modulo $7$.\n*   $\\chi_4$ is a primitive character modulo $11$.\n*   $\\chi_5$ is a primitive character modulo $13$.\n\nAnd the orders must satisfy $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5)) = 6$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Primitive Characters for Each Prime Power Factor\n\nFor each prime power $p^a$, we need to find the number of primitive characters and their possible orders. The number of primitive characters modulo $p^a$ is $\\phi(p^a) - \\phi(p^{a-1})$ for $a \\ge 2$, and $\\phi(p)-1$ for $a=1$. The orders of these characters are divisors of the order of the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p^a\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is $\\phi(p^a)$.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$):**\n    *   The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(4)=2$.\n    *   The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(4) - \\phi(2) = 2-1 = 1$.\n    *   This single primitive character must have order 2.\n    *   So, for $\\chi_1$, there is **1 choice**, and its order is 2.\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$):**\n    *   The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, a cyclic group of order $\\phi(9)=6$.\n    *   The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6-2=4$.\n    *   The orders of characters in a cyclic group of order 6 can be 1, 2, 3, or 6. The non-primitive characters are induced from modulo 3, whose character group has order $\\phi(3)=2$. These have orders 1 and 2.\n    *   Therefore, the primitive characters mod 9 must have orders 3 or 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3 is $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6 is $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    *   So, for $\\chi_2$, there are **4 choices** (2 of order 3, 2 of order 6).\n\n*   **Modulo 7:**\n    *   The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, a cyclic group of order $\\phi(7)=6$.\n    *   The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(7) - \\phi(1) = 6-1=5$.\n    *   The orders are the divisors of 6, except 1. So, orders can be 2, 3, or 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3 is $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6 is $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    *   So, for $\\chi_3$, there are **5 choices** (1 of order 2, 2 of order 3, 2 of order 6).\n\n*   **Modulo 11:**\n    *   The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, a cyclic group of order $\\phi(11)=10$.\n    *   The primitive characters are all but the principal one, so there are 9. Their orders are divisors of 10 except 1: 2, 5, 10.\n\n*   **Modulo 13:**\n    *   The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, a cyclic group of order $\\phi(13)=12$.\n    *   The primitive characters are all but the principal one, so there are 11. Their orders are divisors of 12 except 1: 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Combinations for Order 6\n\nFor the final character $\\chi$ to have order 6, the orders of the components $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$ must satisfy:\n1.  **Divisibility:** Each $o_i$ must divide 6.\n2.  **LCM condition:** The lcm of the orders must be exactly 6. This means the set of orders $\\{o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4, o_5\\}$ must contain an order divisible by 2 and an order divisible by 3.\n\nLet's count the number of choices for each $\\chi_i$ such that its order divides 6.\n*   **Choices for $\\chi_1$ (mod 4):** The only order is 2, which divides 6. There is **1** choice.\n*   **Choices for $\\chi_2$ (mod 9):** The possible orders are 3 and 6, both divide 6. There are $2+2=\\mathbf{4}$ choices.\n*   **Choices for $\\chi_3$ (mod 7):** The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6, all divide 6. There are $1+2+2=\\mathbf{5}$ choices.\n*   **Choices for $\\chi_4$ (mod 11):** The possible orders for primitive characters are 2, 5, 10. Only 2 divides 6. The number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$. There is **1** choice.\n*   **Choices for $\\chi_5$ (mod 13):** The possible orders for primitive characters are 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Those that divide 6 are 2, 3, 6. The number of choices is $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2=\\mathbf{5}$.\n\nNow, we check the lcm condition. For any combination of characters chosen from the sets above:\n*   The order of $\\chi_1$ is always 2, so the lcm will always be divisible by 2.\n*   The order of $\\chi_2$ is always 3 or 6, so it is always divisible by 3. This means the lcm will always be divisible by 3.\n\nSince any valid combination of component choices results in an lcm that is divisible by both 2 and 3, and since all individual orders divide 6, the lcm must be exactly 6.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nThe total number of primitive characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6 is the product of the number of valid choices for each component character.\n\nNumber of characters = (choices for $\\chi_1$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_2$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_3$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_5$)\nNumber of characters = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5$\nNumber of characters = $100$"
