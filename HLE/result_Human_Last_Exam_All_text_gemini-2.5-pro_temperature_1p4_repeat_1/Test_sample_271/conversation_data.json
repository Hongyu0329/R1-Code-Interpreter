    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the polynomial and its splitting field.**\n    Let $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We can try to factor it by grouping terms:\n    $f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n    $f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n    $f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$.\n    Let $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $h(x) = x^2 - 2$.\n    The roots of $f(x)$ are the union of the roots of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$.\n    The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the composite of the splitting field of $g(x)$, let's call it $K_g$, and the splitting field of $h(x)$, let's call it $K_h$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Galois group of each factor.**\n    *   For $h(x) = x^2 - 2$, the roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a normal extension of degree 2, and its Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n    *   For $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we first check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$: $3$ divides all coefficients except the leading one (which is 1), and $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term $3$. Thus, $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   The degree of $g(x)$ is 5, so its Galois group $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$. Since the degree is a prime number (5), $G_g$ must contain an element of order 5 (a 5-cycle).\n    *   To determine the number of real roots of $g(x)$, we analyze its derivative: $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are $x = \\pm\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. There are two real critical points.\n        *   $g(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = (9/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} - 9\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 = 3 - (36/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} < 0$.\n        *   $g(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = -(9/5)(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) - 9(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) + 3 = 3 + (36/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} > 0$.\n        Since the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $g(x)$ has exactly 3 real roots and 2 complex conjugate roots.\n    *   The complex conjugation is an automorphism of $K_g$ which swaps the two complex roots and fixes the three real roots. This corresponds to a transposition in $G_g \\le S_5$.\n    *   A subgroup of $S_5$ containing a 5-cycle and a transposition must be the entire group $S_5$. Therefore, $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$. The degree of the extension is $[K_g : \\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Galois group of the composite field.**\n    The splitting field of $f(x)$ is $K = K_h K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\text{roots of } g(x))$.\n    The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $G_h \\times G_g$. The structure is exactly the direct product if the intersection of the fields is trivial, i.e., $K_h \\cap K_g = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    The field $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a quadratic extension.\n    The group $S_5$ has only one normal subgroup of index 2, which is $A_5$. By Galois theory, $K_g$ has a unique quadratic subfield, which is the fixed field of $A_5$. This subfield is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $g(x)=x^5-9x+3$.\n    $D = (-1)^{5(4)/2}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + 4^4(-9)^5) = 1 \\cdot (3125 \\cdot 81 - 256 \\cdot 59049) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\n    The unique quadratic subfield is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$, which is an imaginary quadratic field.\n    Since $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field, $K_h \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$. Therefore, $K_h \\cap K_g = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    This implies that the Galois group of the composite field is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n    $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\n    The degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G| = |C_2| \\cdot |S_5| = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$.\n\n4.  **Find the possible degrees of normal intermediate fields.**\n    According to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, a field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset L \\subset K$ is normal if and only if the corresponding subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$ is a normal subgroup of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$.\n    The degree of such an extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n    We need to find all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$ and calculate their indices.\n\n    The normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\n    The normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$ (the alternating group of order 60), and $S_5$.\n\n    We can construct normal subgroups of $G$ as direct products of normal subgroups of its factors:\n    *   $H_1 = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$. $|H_1|=2$. Index is $240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $H_2 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$. $|H_2|=60$. Index is $240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$. $|H_3|=120$. Index is $240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $H_4 = C_2 \\times A_5$. $|H_4|=2 \\cdot 60=120$. Index is $240/120 = 2$.\n    *   The trivial subgroups $G=C_2 \\times S_5$ and $\\{e\\} \\times \\{e\\}$ correspond to $L=\\mathbb{Q}$ and $L=K$ respectively, which are excluded by the condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\n\n    We must also check for \"diagonal\" normal subgroups. A normal subgroup of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ is not always a direct product of normal subgroups of the factors. Using Goursat's Lemma or direct analysis, we can find these. Such a subgroup $H$ arises from an isomorphism $\\phi: G_1/N_1 \\to G_2/N_2$ where $N_1, N_2$ are normal subgroups.\n    The non-trivial quotients of $C_2$ is $C_2/\\{e\\} \\cong C_2$.\n    The non-trivial quotients of $S_5$ are $S_5/\\{e\\} \\cong S_5$ and $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$.\n    The only non-trivial isomorphism is between $C_2$ and $S_5/A_5$. Let $\\psi: C_2 \\to S_5/A_5$ be this isomorphism.\n    This gives rise to a normal subgroup $H_5 = \\{(c,s) \\in C_2 \\times S_5 \\mid \\psi(c) = sA_5\\}$.\n    This subgroup consists of pairs $(e,s)$ where $s \\in A_5$ and pairs $(c_0, s)$ where $c_0$ is the non-identity element of $C_2$ and $s \\notin A_5$.\n    The order of this subgroup is $|H_5| = |A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n    The index of this subgroup is $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n5.  **List all possible degrees.**\n    The orders of the proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G=C_2 \\times S_5$ are 2, 60, and 120.\n    The corresponding indices (degrees of the normal extensions) are:\n    *   For $|H|=2$, the degree is $240/2 = 120$.\n    *   For $|H|=60$, the degree is $240/60 = 4$.\n    *   For $|H|=120$, the degree is $240/120 = 2$.\n\n    The set of all possible degrees for such field extensions $L$ is therefore {2, 4, 120}.\n\nFinal answer should be the list of these numbers.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
