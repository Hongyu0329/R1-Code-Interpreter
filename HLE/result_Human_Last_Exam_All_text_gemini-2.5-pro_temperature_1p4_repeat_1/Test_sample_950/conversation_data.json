    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the space and the question's object.**\nThe space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $Gr(3, 5)$. We are interested in its integral cohomology ring, $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^{\\infty} H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$. The question asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup of this ring. Let $T = T(H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})) = \\bigoplus_i T(H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}))$ be this torsion subgroup.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the term \"rank of the torsion subgroup\".**\nFor any finitely generated abelian group $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^r \\oplus T_A$ (where $T_A$ is the torsion subgroup), its rank is $r$. By definition, a torsion group has a rank of 0. The group $T$ is a torsion group. Therefore, its rank in the strict mathematical sense is 0.\nHowever, in algebraic topology, \"rank of torsion\" is often used colloquially to mean the minimum number of generators of the torsion subgroup, or the sum of the $p$-ranks over all primes $p$. For a group like $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^k$, this value would be $k$. Given the nature of the problem, it is highly likely that this colloquial meaning is intended. We will proceed to calculate this number.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the key properties of $Gr(3, 5)$.**\n- The dimension of $Gr(k, n)$ is $d = k(n-k)$. For $Gr(3, 5)$, the dimension is $d = 3(5-3) = 6$.\n- The manifold $Gr(k, n)$ is orientable if and only if its first Stiefel-Whitney class of the tangent bundle, $w_1(T)$, is zero. This class is given by $w_1(T) = (n \\pmod 2) \\cdot w_1(\\gamma)$, where $\\gamma$ is the tautological bundle. For $Gr(3, 5)$, $n=5$ is odd, and $w_1(\\gamma) \\neq 0$. Thus, $w_1(T) \\neq 0$, and $Gr(3, 5)$ is a non-orientable manifold.\n- Non-orientable compact manifolds generally have torsion in their integral homology and cohomology groups. Specifically for real Grassmannians, all torsion is 2-torsion.\n\n**Step 4: Use the Schubert cell decomposition and the Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT).**\nThe Grassmannian $Gr(3, 5)$ has a cellular decomposition into Schubert cells. The number of $i$-cells, denoted $\\beta_i$, determines the dimension of the homology with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients, because a key (but non-trivial) result states that all boundary maps in the cellular chain complex with $\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients have even entries. This means the boundary maps become zero when using $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients.\n- The number of $i$-cells $\\beta_i$ for $Gr(k, n)$ is the number of partitions of $i$ that fit into a $k \\times (n-k)$ box. For $Gr(3,5)$, this is a $3 \\times 2$ box.\n- $\\beta_0=1$: (0,0,0)\n- $\\beta_1=1$: (1,0,0)\n- $\\beta_2=2$: (1,1,0), (2,0,0)\n- $\\beta_3=2$: (1,1,1), (2,1,0)\n- $\\beta_4=2$: (2,1,1), (2,2,0)\n- $\\beta_5=1$: (2,2,1)\n- $\\beta_6=1$: (2,2,2)\nThe Poincaré polynomial for $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients is $P(t; \\mathbb{Z}_2) = 1+t+2t^2+2t^3+2t^4+t^5+t^6$. So $\\dim H_i(Gr(3,5);\\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\beta_i$.\n\nLet $H_k(\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{b_k} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_k}$ be the integral homology groups (since all torsion is 2-torsion). The UCT for homology states that:\n$0 \\to H_k(\\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to H_k(\\mathbb{Z}_2) \\to \\mathrm{Tor}(H_{k-1}(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\to 0$.\nThe dimensions satisfy $\\dim H_k(\\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\dim(H_k \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}_2) + \\dim \\mathrm{Tor}(H_{k-1}, \\mathbb{Z}_2)$.\nThis gives the relation: $\\beta_k = (b_k + t_k) + t_{k-1}$.\n\n**Step 5: Use Poincaré Duality to solve for the structure.**\nFor any compact $d$-manifold, the Betti numbers satisfy Poincaré Duality: $b_k = b_{d-k}$. Here, $d=6$. We now build a system of equations for $b_k$ and $t_k$.\n- We know $H_0=\\mathbb{Z}$ for a connected space, so $b_0=1, t_0=0$. Also $t_{-1}=0, t_k=0$ for $k>6$.\n- $k=0: \\beta_0=1 = b_0+t_0+t_{-1} \\implies 1 = b_0+0+0 \\implies b_0=1$.\n- $k=6: \\beta_6=1 = b_6+t_6+t_5$. By PD, $b_6=b_0=1$. So $1=1+t_6+t_5 \\implies t_6+t_5=0$. Since $t_k \\ge 0$, this means $t_6=0$ and $t_5=0$.\n- $k=1: \\beta_1=1 = b_1+t_1+t_0 \\implies 1 = b_1+t_1$.\n- $k=5: \\beta_5=1 = b_5+t_5+t_4$. With $t_5=0$, this gives $1 = b_5+t_4$. By PD, $b_5=b_1$. So $1=b_1+t_4$. Comparing with $k=1$ equation, we get $t_1=t_4$.\n- $k=2: \\beta_2=2 = b_2+t_2+t_1$.\n- $k=4: \\beta_4=2 = b_4+t_4+t_3$. With $b_4=b_2$ and $t_4=t_1$, this gives $2=b_2+t_1+t_3$. Comparing with $k=2$ equation, we get $t_2=t_3$.\n- $k=3: \\beta_3=2 = b_3+t_3+t_2$. With $t_3=t_2$, we have $2=b_3+2t_2$.\n\nThis system does not have a unique solution. We need more information. The relation $b_1+t_1=1$ implies two cases: either ($b_1=1, t_1=0$) or ($b_1=0, t_1=1$). We can distinguish these using the Steenrod square $Sq^1$.\n\n**Step 6: Use Steenrod squares to resolve ambiguity.**\nThe torsion in $H^k(X;\\mathbb{Z})$ is related to the Bockstein homomorphism, which is $Sq^1$ in the Bockstein spectral sequence. The rank of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-torsion in $H^k(X;\\mathbb{Z})$ is equal to the dimension of the image of $Sq^1: H^{k-2}(X;\\mathbb{Z}_2) \\to H^{k-1}(X;\\mathbb{Z}_2)$. The torsion rank of $H^k$ is $t_{k-1}$ (homology torsion).\n$t_{k-1} = \\dim(\\mathrm{im}(Sq^1: H^{k-1}(\\mathbb{Z}_2) \\to H^k(\\mathbb{Z}_2)))$.\nLet's check $t_1 = t^2$: $t_1 = \\dim(\\mathrm{im}(Sq^1: H^1(\\mathbb{Z}_2) \\to H^2(\\mathbb{Z}_2)))$.\n$H^*(Gr(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is generated by Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_1, w_2, w_3$. $H^1(\\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is generated by $w_1$.\n$Sq^1(w_1) = w_1^2 + w_2$. This element is non-zero in $H^2(Gr(3,5);\\mathbb{Z}_2)$.\nThus, the image of $Sq^1$ on $H^1$ is non-trivial, so its dimension is 1. This means $t_1=1$.\nThis resolves the ambiguity: since $b_1+t_1=1$, we must have $b_1=0$ and $t_1=1$.\n\n**Step 7: Complete the calculation.**\nWith $t_1=1$, we can find the other values.\n- $t_4 = t_1 = 1$.\n- $t_5 = 0, t_6 = 0$.\n- $2 = b_3 + 2t_2$. Since $b_3 \\ge 0, t_2 \\ge 0$, we have two options: ($b_3=2, t_2=0$) or ($b_3=0, t_2=1$).\n- To resolve this, we check $Sq^1$ on $H^2$. The dimension of its image gives $t_2$. $Sq^1(w_2) = w_1w_2 + w_3 = w_1w_2 + w_1^3$ (using the relation $\\bar{w}_3=0$). This is a non-zero element in $H^3$. So the image is non-trivial, and $t_2 = \\dim(\\mathrm{im}(Sq^1|_{H^2})) \\ge 1$.\n- Thus, we must have $t_2=1$ and $b_3=0$.\n- Then $t_3=t_2=1$.\n\nThe torsion ranks of the integral **homology** groups $H_k(Gr(3,5);\\mathbb{Z})$ are:\n$t_0=0, t_1=1, t_2=1, t_3=1, t_4=1, t_5=0, t_6=0$.\n\n**Step 8: Find the torsion of the cohomology ring.**\nThe Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology states that $H^k(X;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{b_k} \\oplus T(H_{k-1}(X;\\mathbb{Z}))$.\nTherefore, the torsion subgroup of $H^k$ is isomorphic to the torsion subgroup of $H_{k-1}$.\nLet $t^k$ be the number of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ summands in $T(H^k)$. Then $t^k = t_{k-1}$.\n- $T(H^0), T(H^1)$ are trivial, so $t^0=t^1=0$.\n- $T(H^2) \\cong T(H_1)$ has rank $t_1=1$.\n- $T(H^3) \\cong T(H_2)$ has rank $t_2=1$.\n- $T(H^4) \\cong T(H_3)$ has rank $t_3=1$.\n- $T(H^5) \\cong T(H_4)$ has rank $t_4=1$.\n- $T(H^6) \\cong T(H_5)$ has rank $t_5=0$.\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring is $T = \\bigoplus_{k=0}^6 T(H^k(\\mathbb{Z}))$.\n$T \\cong T(H^2) \\oplus T(H^3) \\oplus T(H^4) \\oplus T(H^5) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$.\nThe \"rank\" in the colloquial sense (number of generators) is the sum of the ranks of these components: $1+1+1+1 = 4$."
