    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integrand**\n\nThe integral we need to evaluate is ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx.\nLet's consider a general function u(x). The derivative of ln(u(x)) with respect to x is given by the chain rule:\nd/dx [ln(u(x))] = (1/u(x)) * u'(x) = u'(x)/u(x).\n\nBy recognizing this pattern, we can see that our integrand, F₃'(x)/F₃(x), is the derivative of ln(F₃(x)).\nSo, ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx = ln(F₃(x)) + C. This is a crucial observation that simplifies the problem immensely.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Definite Integral**\n\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we can evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1:\n∫ [from 0 to 1] (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx = [ln(|F₃(x)|)] from 0 to 1\nThis evaluates to: ln(|F₃(1)|) - ln(|F₃(0)|).\n\n**Step 3: Define the Function F₃(x)**\n\nWe are given a sequence of functions defined by composition:\n*   F₀(x) = x\n*   F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n*   F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n*   F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n**Step 4: Check the Sign of F₃(x) on the Interval [0, 1]**\n\nWe need to determine if the absolute value signs are necessary. Let's analyze the behavior of F₃(x) for x in the interval [0, 1].\n1.  For x in [0, 1], sin(x) is an increasing function. The value of x is in radians.\n    *   At x=0, sin(0) = 0.\n    *   At x=1, sin(1) ≈ 0.841.\n    *   So, for x in [0, 1], we have 0 ≤ sin(x) ≤ sin(1).\n2.  The exponential function e^y is always positive.\n    *   e^(sin(x)) will be between e⁰ = 1 and e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.841 ≈ 2.32.\n3.  The term (1 + e^(sin(x))) will be between (1+1) = 2 and (1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ 3.32.\n4.  The natural logarithm function ln(z) is positive for z > 1.\n    *   Since (1 + e^(sin(x))) ≥ 2 for x in [0, 1], its logarithm, F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x))), will be positive throughout the interval.\n    *   The minimum value is F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.693, which is greater than 0.\n\nSince F₃(x) is always positive on [0, 1], we can remove the absolute value signs.\nThe value of the integral (V) is: V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this is also V = ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0)).\n\n**Step 5: Calculate F₃(0) and F₃(1)**\n\n*   **Calculate F₃(0):**\n    F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2).\n\n*   **Calculate F₃(1):**\n    F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))).\n    Note: '1' is in radians.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Numerical Value of the Integral (V)**\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for F₃(0) and F₃(1) into the formula for V.\nV = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) = ln( ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ) - ln( ln(2) )\n\nLet's compute the numerical value:\n1.  sin(1) ≈ 0.84147098\n2.  e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.84147098 ≈ 2.3197864\n3.  1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 3.3197864\n4.  F₃(1) = ln(3.3197864) ≈ 1.20000005\n5.  F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.69314718\n6.  V = ln(1.20000005) - ln(0.69314718)\n7.  V ≈ 0.1823216 - (-0.3665129)\n8.  V ≈ 0.5488345\n\n**Step 7: Find the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.5488345 = 5488.345\nThe closest integer to 5488.345 is 5488."
