    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical object:** The question is about the representation theory of the algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$, which is the Lusztig's small quantum group (or Frobenius-Lusztig kernel) associated with the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C}$. The parameter $q$ is a primitive third root of unity (e.g., $q = e^{2\\pi i / 3}$). This algebra is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra over $\\mathbb{C}$. The key parameter for its representation theory is the smallest integer $l > 1$ such that $q^{2l}=1$. Since $q$ is a primitive 3rd root of unity, $q^2 = e^{4\\pi i / 3}$ is also a primitive 3rd root of unity. Thus, $l=3$.\n\n2.  **Understand the category C:** The objects of the category $C$ are the isomorphism classes of all finite-dimensional indecomposable representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$. A representation is indecomposable if it cannot be written as a direct sum of two non-zero subrepresentations.\n\n3.  **The goal:** The question asks for the percentage of irreducible objects among all objects of $C$. An irreducible (or simple) representation is one with no proper non-trivial subrepresentations. Every irreducible representation is indecomposable. The percentage is calculated as:\n    $$ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{\\text{Number of irreducible objects in } C}{\\text{Total number of objects in } C} \\times 100\\% $$\n\n4.  **Count the number of irreducible representations:** We need to find how many non-isomorphic irreducible representations this algebra has.\n    *   The irreducible representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ are classified by a highest weight $\\lambda$ (which must be a 3rd root of unity: $1, q, q^2$) and their dimension, which is at most $l=3$.\n    *   **Dimension 1:** A 1-dimensional representation is always irreducible. The generators $E$ and $F$ must act as zero, and the generator $K$ acts as a scalar $\\lambda$. The relation $K^3=1$ (part of the definition of the small quantum group) implies $\\lambda^3=1$. There are three such scalars: $1, q, q^2$. Thus, there are **3** one-dimensional irreducible representations.\n    *   **Dimension 2:** A standard calculation shows that there is a 2-dimensional irreducible representation if the highest weight $\\lambda$ satisfies $\\lambda \\neq 1$ and $\\lambda^2=q^2$. Among the allowed highest weights $\\{1, q, q^2\\}$, only $\\lambda=q$ works. Thus, there is **1** two-dimensional irreducible representation.\n    *   **Dimension 3:** A 3-dimensional representation is irreducible if its highest weight $\\lambda$ satisfies $\\lambda \\neq 1$ and $\\lambda^2 \\neq q^2$. Among $\\{1, q, q^2\\}$, only $\\lambda=q^2$ satisfies these conditions. This gives **1** three-dimensional irreducible representation, often called the Steinberg module.\n    *   In total, the number of non-isomorphic irreducible representations is finite: $3 + 1 + 1 = 5$.\n\n5.  **Count the total number of indecomposable representations:** This requires knowing the representation type of the algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ for $l=3$.\n    *   The representation type of a finite-dimensional algebra can be finite, tame, or wild.\n        *   **Finite type:** Only a finite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations.\n        *   **Tame type:** Infinitely many indecomposables, but they can be classified. For each dimension, they fall into a finite number of discrete modules and a finite number of one-parameter families.\n        *   **Wild type:** The classification is considered a \"hopeless\" problem.\n    *   It is a well-established result in the theory of quantum groups that for $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, the representation type is tame when $l=3$.\n    *   The existence of one-parameter families of indecomposable modules (called \"band modules\") means there are uncountably many non-isomorphic indecomposable representations. For example, for $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ with $l=3$, there is a family of indecomposable modules of dimension 2 parameterized by a complex number $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{C}^*$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the percentage:**\n    *   The number of irreducible objects in $C$ is 5.\n    *   The total number of objects in $C$ is infinite.\n    *   The percentage is the ratio of a finite number to an infinite number:\n        $$ \\frac{5}{\\infty} \\times 100\\% = 0\\% $$\n\n### Careful points:\n\n*   The phrasing of the question is precise and standard in a mathematical context. A literal interpretation is the most likely one intended.\n*   One could speculate that \"indecomposable\" might implicitly refer to a special, finite subclass, like the indecomposable projective modules. In that case, there are 5 indecomposable projectives, of which only the Steinberg module is irreducible, leading to an answer of $1/5 = 20\\%$. However, this requires an unsubstantiated assumption that a more restricted class of objects is meant.\n*   Without any such assumption, the conclusion that the total number of indecomposables is infinite is robust, based on the established theory of the representation type of this algebra.\n\nThe most accurate answer based on a direct interpretation of the question is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
