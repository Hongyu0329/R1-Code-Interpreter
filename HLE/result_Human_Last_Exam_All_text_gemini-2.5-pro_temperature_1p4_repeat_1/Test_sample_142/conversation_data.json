    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) in a Full CI (FCI) calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using a 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the number of electrons ($N_{elec}$)**\n\nFirst, we identify the atoms in the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ and sum their electrons to find the total number of electrons in the system.\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 1 atom, Atomic number = 6 -> 6 electrons\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 3 atoms (2 from $\\mathrm{CH}_2$, 1 from HF part), Atomic number = 1 -> 3 Ã— 1 = 3 electrons\n*   **Silicon (Si):** 1 atom, Atomic number = 14 -> 14 electrons\n*   **Fluorine (F):** 1 atom, Atomic number = 9 -> 9 electrons\n\nTotal number of electrons, $N_{elec} = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = 32$.\n\nFor a closed-shell molecule like this, the ground state is a singlet state. In a singlet state, the number of alpha-spin electrons ($N_{\\alpha}$) equals the number of beta-spin electrons ($N_{\\beta}$).\n$N_{\\alpha} = N_{\\beta} = N_{elec} / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of basis functions (spatial orbitals, K)**\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of basis functions contributed by the 6-31G** basis set for all atoms in the molecule.\n\n*   **6-31G** part: This is a split-valence basis set.\n    *   For H: The 1s orbital is split into two functions (1s' and 1s''). This gives 2 basis functions.\n    *   For 2nd-row heavy atoms (like C and F): The core 1s orbital is one function. The valence 2s and 2p orbitals are each split into two functions (inner and outer). This gives 1 (for 1s) + 4 (for inner 2s, 2p) + 4 (for outer 2s, 2p) = 9 basis functions.\n    *   For 3rd-row heavy atoms (like Si): The core 1s, 2s, 2p orbitals are represented, and the valence 3s and 3p orbitals are split. This results in a total of 13 basis functions for the s and p orbitals.\n\n*   **\\*\\*** (Polarization functions) part:\n    *   The first '*' adds one set of d-type polarization functions to each heavy (non-hydrogen) atom. A standard set of Cartesian d-functions has 6 components (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz).\n    *   The second '*' adds one set of p-type polarization functions to each hydrogen atom. A set of p-functions has 3 components (p_x, p_y, p_z).\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of basis functions for each atom:\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** 2 (from 6-31G) + 3 (from p-polarization) = 5 basis functions.\n*   **For the Carbon (C) atom:** 9 (from 6-31G) + 6 (from d-polarization) = 15 basis functions.\n*   **For the Fluorine (F) atom:** 9 (from 6-31G) + 6 (from d-polarization) = 15 basis functions.\n*   **For the Silicon (Si) atom:** 13 (from 6-31G) + 6 (from d-polarization) = 19 basis functions.\n\nTotal number of basis functions (which is the number of spatial orbitals, K):\n$K = (1 \\times \\text{C}) + (3 \\times \\text{H}) + (1 \\times \\text{Si}) + (1 \\times \\text{F})$\n$K = (1 \\times 15) + (3 \\times 5) + (1 \\times 19) + (1 \\times 15)$\n$K = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = 64$.\n\nSo, we have $K = 64$ spatial orbitals.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of singlet CSFs**\n\nThe number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a singlet state ($S=0$) with $N_{elec}$ electrons distributed among $K$ spatial orbitals is given by the formula:\n\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{K}{N_{\\alpha}}^2 - \\binom{K}{N_{\\alpha}-1}\\binom{K}{N_{\\alpha}+1}$\n\nwhere $\\binom{n}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\".\n\nPlugging in our values:\n*   $K = 64$\n*   $N_{\\alpha} = 16$\n\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{15}\\binom{64}{17}$\n\n**Step 4: Compute the numerical value**\n\nWe now calculate the values of the binomial coefficients:\n\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} = \\frac{64!}{15!49!} = 262,038,827,405,775$\n*   $\\binom{64}{16} = \\frac{64!}{16!48!} = 1,053,155,309,623,100$\n*   $\\binom{64}{17} = \\frac{64!}{17!47!} = 3,717,008,151,593,300$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the formula:\n\n*   $\\binom{64}{16}^2 = (1,053,155,309,623,100)^2 = 1,109,136,000,000,000,000,000,000,000$\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} \\times \\binom{64}{17} = (262,038,827,405,775) \\times (3,717,008,151,593,300) = 974,050,274,191,636,250,000,000,000,000$\n\nFinally, calculate the difference:\n\n$N_{CSF} = 1,109,136,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 - 974,050,274,191,636,250,000,000,000,000$\n$N_{CSF} = 135,085,725,808,363,750,000,000,000,000$\n\nThis can also be written in scientific notation as approximately $1.351 \\times 10^{29}$."
