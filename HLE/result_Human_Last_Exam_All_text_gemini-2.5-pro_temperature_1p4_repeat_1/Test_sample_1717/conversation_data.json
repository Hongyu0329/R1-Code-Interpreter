    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks for the maximum health of the boss \"Eye of Cthulhu\" under specific conditions.\n\n2.  **Identify the Conditions:**\n    *   **Game Mode:** Expert Mode.\n    *   **Player Count:** A theoretical infinite number of players.\n    *   **Basis of Answer:** \"According to the source code of the video game Terraria.\" This is the most critical constraint.\n\n3.  **Determine the Base Health:** First, we need the starting health value for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode before multiplayer scaling is applied. According to the game's data, in single-player Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has **3,640 HP**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Health Scaling Formula:** In Terraria, the health of bosses increases in Expert and Master modes with more than one player. The specific formula for health scaling in Expert Mode is:\n    `Total Health = BaseExpertHealth * (1 + 0.35 * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))`\n    *   `BaseExpertHealth` is the health with one player (3,640 for the Eye of Cthulhu).\n    *   `NumberOfPlayers` is the number of active players in the world.\n    *   `0.35` represents a 35% health increase for each additional player.\n\n5.  **Apply the \"Infinite Players\" Condition to the Formula:** The question asks for the theoretical maximum health with an infinite number of players. This requires us to find the limit of the health formula as the `NumberOfPlayers` (let's call it `N`) approaches infinity.\n    `Limit as N → ∞ of [3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))]`\n    As `N` becomes infinitely large, the `(N - 1)` term also becomes infinitely large. Multiplying this by 0.35 and then by 3,640 results in a value that also approaches infinity.\n    *   **Mathematical Conclusion:** From a purely mathematical standpoint, the health would be infinite.\n\n6.  **Apply the \"Source Code\" Constraint:** This is the key to finding the correct answer. A computer program cannot store an infinitely large number. Variables have defined data types with upper limits. In Terraria's source code (which is written in C#), NPC health is stored in a standard 32-bit signed integer variable (`int`).\n    *   A 32-bit signed integer can hold values from -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum positive value that can be stored for health is **2,147,483,647**.\n\n7.  **Synthesize the Conclusion:** While the mathematical scaling formula would increase health infinitely with infinite players, the game's engine is limited by the data type used to store health. Any calculation that results in a health value greater than `2,147,483,647` will be capped at this value to prevent a data overflow. Thus, the theoretical maximum health any NPC can have in the game is the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Mode Specificity:** It is essential to use the Expert Mode scaling factor (35%) and not the Master Mode factor.\n*   **Base Health Accuracy:** The calculation must start from the correct single-player Expert Mode health (3,640).\n*   **Theoretical vs. Technical Limits:** The question's use of \"theoretical\" could be interpreted mathematically (infinity) or technically (the limit of the software). The phrase \"according to the source code\" strongly implies that the technical limitation is the intended answer.\n*   **Data Type Limitation:** The answer hinges entirely on knowing that game values like health are stored in variables with finite limits, in this case, a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  Eye of Cthulhu health scaling formula in Expert Mode: `Health = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (Players - 1))`\n2.  With infinite players, the result of this formula approaches infinity.\n3.  The game's source code stores health as a 32-bit signed integer (`int`).\n4.  The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is 2^31 - 1.\n5.  Calculation: 2^31 - 1 = 2,147,483,648 - 1 = 2,147,483,647.\n6.  This technical limit overrides the mathematical formula's unbounded growth.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health is 2,147,483,647.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
