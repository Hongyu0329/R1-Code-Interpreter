    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the value computed between heartbeats for HRV.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n    *   **Measurement Method:** Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used to capture \"beat-to-beat intervals\".\n    *   **Core Question:** HRV is calculated from a \"value between heartbeats.\" What is this value called?\n\n2.  **Analyze the \"Beat-to-Beat Interval\":**\n    *   A heartbeat is a single event. The time *between* one heartbeat and the next is a duration or an interval.\n    *   HRV is not the heart rate itself, but the *variation* in these time intervals from one beat to the next.\n    *   Therefore, the fundamental unit of measurement for HRV is the time duration between consecutive heartbeats.\n\n3.  **Identify the Technical Terminology:**\n    *   **R-R Interval:** In electrocardiography (ECG), which is the gold standard for measuring the heart's electrical activity, the most distinct point of a heartbeat is the \"R wave\" (the tall spike in the QRS complex). The time measured from the peak of one R wave to the peak of the next is called the **R-R interval**. This is the most common and standard term used in all HRV literature.\n    *   **Inter-beat Interval (IBI):** When using methods other than ECG, like the mentioned PPG, we are not measuring electrical R waves but the peak of a blood pulse wave. The time between these consecutive pulse peaks is more generically called the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**. In practice, for the purpose of HRV, IBI and R-R interval are often used synonymously.\n    *   **N-N Interval:** For accurate HRV analysis, it's important to exclude abnormal beats (e.g., arrhythmias). After the raw R-R intervals or IBIs are filtered to remove these artifacts, the remaining intervals between consecutive \"normal\" sinus beats are called **Normal-to-Normal (N-N) intervals**. Most HRV metrics (like SDNN and RMSSD) are calculated from this cleaned set of N-N intervals.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   The \"value between heartbeats\" is the time interval.\n    *   The most fundamental and widely recognized technical term for this interval, which forms the basis of all HRV calculations, is the **R-R interval**.\n    *   While other terms like IBI and N-N interval are also correct in specific contexts, the R-R interval is the foundational concept from which the others are derived or named by analogy.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **HR vs. HRV:** Do not confuse Heart Rate (HR), which is an average (e.g., 60 beats *per minute*), with the R-R interval, which is a specific duration between two beats (e.g., 1000 milliseconds).\n*   **Measurement Source:** Although the prompt mentions PPG, the term R-R interval (from ECG) is so standard that it is frequently used in the literature even when discussing PPG-derived data.\n*   **Specificity:** The question asks for \"that value,\" implying a singular concept. The R-R interval is the most direct and standard answer for the raw beat-to-beat time measurement.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe value being described is the duration of the time interval between successive heartbeats. This is the fundamental data point used to calculate HRV. The most common and standard technical name for this value is the R-R interval.\n\n<<<R-R interval"
