    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the relevant physical principles and given information.**\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle relates the uncertainty in a particle's position ($\\Delta x$) to the uncertainty in its momentum ($\\Delta p$). The mathematical relation is $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar = h/2\\pi$). For this problem, we will consider the minimum uncertainty, so we use the equality: $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n*   **Bohr Model:** This model describes the momentum of an electron in a specific orbit around a nucleus. For an electron in the n-th orbit, the angular momentum is quantized: $L = mvr = n\\hbar$. The linear momentum is $p = mv$.\n*   **Given Information:**\n    *   The electron is in the first Bohr orbit, so n = 1.\n    *   The uncertainty in its position is $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the uncertainty in the electron's momentum ($\\Delta p$).**\n\n*   Using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle formula: $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$.\n*   We are given $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$. We need to convert this to SI units (meters):\n    $\\Delta x = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$.\n*   Substituting this value into the equation gives the expression for $\\Delta p$:\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\times (10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m})}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit ($p_1$).**\n\n*   According to the Bohr model, the angular momentum ($L$) in the first orbit (n=1) is $L_1 = r_1 p_1 = 1 \\cdot \\hbar$, where $r_1$ is the radius of the first Bohr orbit and $p_1$ is the momentum.\n*   The radius of the first Bohr orbit ($r_1$) is a known physical constant, the Bohr radius ($a_0$), which is approximately $r_1 = 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n*   From the angular momentum equation, we can find the momentum $p_1$:\n    $p_1 = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$.\n*   Substituting the value of $r_1$:\n    $p_1 = \\frac{\\hbar}{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum to the momentum ($\\Delta p / p_1$).**\n\n*   Now we construct the desired ratio using the expressions from Step 2 and Step 3:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1} \\right)}$\n*   The reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ cancels out, simplifying the expression significantly:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$\n*   Now, we can plug in the numerical values for $r_1$ and $\\Delta x$:\n    *   $r_1 = 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$\n    *   $\\Delta x = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$\n*   Calculate the ratio:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11}}{2 \\times (10 \\times 10^{-12})} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11}}{20 \\times 10^{-12}} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11}}{2 \\times 10^{-11}}$\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1} = \\frac{5.29}{2} = 2.645$\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n1.  **Choice of Uncertainty Formula:** The rigorous form of the uncertainty principle is $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. When asked to calculate uncertainty, it is standard practice to use the minimum uncertainty condition, i.e., the equality $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n2.  **Unit Consistency:** All physical quantities must be in consistent units before calculation. Here, converting picometers (pm) to meters (m) is crucial.\n3.  **Constants:** It's important to use the correct values for physical constants like the Bohr radius ($a_0 = r_1$). However, in this specific problem, the clever algebraic simplification of the ratio eliminates the need for Planck's constant, reducing the chance of calculation errors.\n4.  **Momentum in Bohr Orbit:** The momentum is derived from the quantization of angular momentum ($L=n\\hbar$), not by directly calculating $p=mv$ without first finding the velocity. The relation $p_1 = \\hbar / r_1$ is a direct and reliable result from the model.\n5.  **Final Answer:** The question asks for a ratio, which is a dimensionless quantity. The units of meters in the numerator and denominator cancel out as expected.\n\n### **Final Answer Derivation**\n\n1.  **Uncertainty in Momentum ($\\Delta p$):**\n    From Heisenberg's Principle: $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n    Given $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$.\n\n2.  **Momentum in First Bohr Orbit ($p_1$):**\n    From Bohr's Model: $p_1 = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$\n    The first Bohr radius is $r_1 = 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\n3.  **Ratio Calculation:**\n    Ratio = $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1} = \\frac{\\hbar / (2 \\Delta x)}{\\hbar / r_1} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$\n    Ratio = $\\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times (10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m})}$\n    Ratio = $\\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11}}{2 \\times 10^{-11}}$\n    Ratio = $\\frac{5.29}{2}$\n    Ratio = 2.645\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
