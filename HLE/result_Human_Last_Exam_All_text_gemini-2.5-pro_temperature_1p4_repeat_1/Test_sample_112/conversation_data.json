    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks for the name of a \"book of manners\" that was physically preserved in the same source as the poem \"Sir Launfal.\" This points to a specific historical manuscript.\n\n2.  **Identify \"Sir Launfal\":** \"Sir Launfal\" is a 14th-century Middle English romance poem written by Thomas Chestre. To find what it was preserved alongside, we must identify the manuscript in which it survives.\n\n3.  **Locate the Manuscript:** The primary and sole surviving manuscript containing Thomas Chestre's \"Sir Launfal\" is a famous collection known as **MS Cotton Caligula A.ii**, now held in the British Library. This manuscript is a miscellany, meaning it contains a variety of different texts bound together.\n\n4.  **Examine the Contents of the Manuscript:** The next step is to examine the other works included in MS Cotton Caligula A.ii to find one that fits the description of a \"book of manners.\" A book of manners, also known as a courtesy book or conduct book, is a genre of literature that provides instruction on social etiquette, behavior, and morals.\n\n5.  **Identify the Book of Manners:** Within the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript, alongside romances like \"Sir Launfal\" and \"Emar√©,\" there is a well-known didactic poem titled **\"How the Good Wijf Taughte Hir Doughtir\"** (often modernized as \"How the Good Wife Taught Her Daughter\"). This poem consists of a mother giving her daughter advice on how to be a respectable and successful wife and mistress of a household, covering topics from public behavior and speech to managing servants and finances. This work is a quintessential example of a medieval book of manners for women.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Answer:** Therefore, the poem \"Sir Launfal\" was preserved alongside the book of manners known as \"How the Good Wijf Taughte Hir Doughtir\" in the manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Manuscript is Key:** The answer depends entirely on the contents of the specific physical manuscript where \"Sir Launfal\" is found.\n*   **Genre Definition:** It's important to understand what a \"book of manners\" was in the medieval context. They were instructional texts on proper conduct. \"How the Good Wijf Taughte Hir Doughtir\" is a perfect example of this genre.\n*   **Middle English Spelling:** Be aware that the original title uses Middle English spelling (e.g., \"Wijf,\" \"Hir,\" \"Doughtir\"), though modern translations are also common.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the specific text requested.\n\n<<<How the Good Wijf Taughte Hir Doughtir>>>"
