    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the key phrases in the question.**\n*   **\"Veronika Campan's interpretation\":** This is the primary lead. Veronika Campan is a contemporary psychoanalyst of the Lacanian school. This tells us the subject is likely a major figure studied in psychoanalysis, such as Sigmund Freud or Jacques Lacan.\n*   **\"at the end of HIS work\":** This suggests either the final part of a specific book or a major work published late in the author's career.\n*   **\"HE separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions\":** This points strongly toward an analysis of the Ten Commandments, specifically the commandment(s) against coveting a neighbor's property (\"house,\" \"goods,\" etc.).\n*   **\"HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\":** This is a complex clue. In the context of the Ten Commandments, the most famous \"prohibition against representation\" is the Second Commandment forbidding graven images of God. The clue suggests that the person's method of analyzing the commandment on possessions involved bypassing or setting aside the commandment on images.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the clues to a specific figure and work.**\n*   The figure who wrote a famous, late-career work combining psychoanalysis with an analysis of the Ten Commandments is **Sigmund Freud**.\n*   The work is his final book, **\"Moses and Monotheism\"** (published in 1939), which fits the \"at the end of HIS work\" description.\n*   In this book, Freud discusses the origins of monotheism and the significance of the Ten Commandments. He is particularly interested in the \"prohibition against representation\" (the Second Commandment), which he argues was a significant advance for civilization as it forced a turn from the sensory to the abstract and intellectual.\n*   Freud also analyzes the final commandments against coveting. Different religious traditions number the commandments differently. The Catholic and Lutheran traditions split the final commandment into two: the Ninth (\"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house\") and the Tenth (\"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife...\"). This allows for a separate address of \"another's material possessions\" (the house) versus the person (the wife).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the interpretation.**\n*   According to Lacanian analysts like Veronika Campan (and her teacher Jacques-Alain Miller), Freud's analysis of the commandments is radical. By focusing on the *psychological* content of the commandments against coveting—which forbid not just an act, but a thought or desire—he shifts the focus from divine law to the internal world of the human subject.\n*   In doing so, he treats the sacred text as an object for scientific analysis. He is creating his own interpretation, or *representation*, of their meaning. This act of psychoanalytic reinterpretation \"naturally ignores the [original] prohibition against representation,\" both in the specific sense of the Second Commandment (which he analyzes as a historical/psychological phenomenon rather than obeying as a divine rule) and in the broader sense of not questioning the sacred text. By dissecting the law, he sets aside its divine, unrepresentable character. He specifically isolates the coveting of material goods by adopting a framework that separates it from the coveting of a person.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the identity of \"HE\".**\nBased on the evidence—the link to psychoanalysis via Veronika Campan, the late-career work on Moses and the Ten Commandments, and the specific thematic analysis of coveting and the prohibition of representation—the figure described is Sigmund Freud.\n\n<<<Sigmund Freud>>>"
