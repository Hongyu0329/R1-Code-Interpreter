    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the radius of the circle.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe problem asks for the radius of a large circle that can \"tightly pack\" fourteen smaller circles of radius one. This is a classic mathematical problem known as \"circle packing in a circle\". The phrase \"tightly packed\" implies the most efficient arrangement, where the radius of the large circle is minimized.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **The Arrangement is Key:** The optimal arrangement of the 14 smaller circles is not trivial. One cannot simply assume a simple pattern (like one circle in the center and thirteen around it). The densest known packing for 14 circles has a specific, proven configuration.\n2.  **Use of Established Results:** The solutions to circle packing problems for various numbers of circles have been studied extensively. Instead of trying to derive the complex geometry from scratch, it is best to use the established mathematical formula for the radius of the circumcircle for n=14.\n3.  **The Formula:** The known optimal packing for n=14 was proven by F. Fodor. For unit circles (radius `r=1`), the radius `R` of the containing circle is given by a precise formula.\n4.  **Calculation Precision:** The calculation involves a square root of an irrational number. It's important to use sufficient precision during intermediate steps to avoid rounding errors affecting the final result.\n5.  **Significant Digits:** The final answer must be presented with 4 significant digits, which requires careful rounding according to standard rules.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the problem and the relevant formula.**\nThe problem is to find the minimum radius `R` of a circle that can contain 14 smaller circles of radius `r=1`. The known optimal configuration for 14 circles leads to the following formula for the radius `R`:\n\n`R = r * [1 + sqrt( (16 + 2*sqrt(31)) / 7 )]`\n\nSince the radius `r` of the small circles is 1, the formula simplifies to:\n\n`R = 1 + sqrt( (16 + 2*sqrt(31)) / 7 )`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the value inside the formula.**\nWe will calculate the value of the expression step-by-step, keeping several decimal places for accuracy.\n\n*   First, calculate the square root of 31:\n    `sqrt(31) ≈ 5.56776436`\n*   Next, multiply this by 2:\n    `2 * sqrt(31) ≈ 2 * 5.56776436 = 11.13552872`\n*   Add 16 to the result:\n    `16 + 11.13552872 = 27.13552872`\n*   Divide the sum by 7:\n    `27.13552872 / 7 ≈ 3.87650410`\n*   Take the square root of this result:\n    `sqrt(3.87650410) ≈ 1.96888397`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the final radius R.**\nNow, add 1 to the value calculated in the previous step to find the radius `R`.\n\n`R = 1 + 1.96888397`\n`R ≈ 2.96888397`\n\n**Step 4: Round the answer to 4 significant digits.**\nThe question asks for the answer up to 4 significant digits. Let's look at our calculated value for `R`: `2.96888397`.\n\n*   The first significant digit is 2.\n*   The second significant digit is 9.\n*   The third significant digit is 6.\n*   The fourth significant digit is 8.\n*   The fifth significant digit is 8.\n\nSince the fifth significant digit (8) is 5 or greater, we must round up the fourth significant digit. So, the 8 becomes a 9.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to 4 significant digits, is **2.969**.\n\n<<<2.969>>>"
