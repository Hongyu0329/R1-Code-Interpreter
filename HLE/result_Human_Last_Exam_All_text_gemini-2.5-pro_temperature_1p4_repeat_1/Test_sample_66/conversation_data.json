    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Structure of the Flag of Tonga:**\n    The flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton (a rectangle in the upper-left corner). Inside this white canton, there is a red cross.\n\n2.  **Model the Flag as a Matrix:**\n    We are creating a matrix where each pixel's value is determined by its color. Red pixels are assigned the value `a`, and white pixels are assigned the value `b`. We can think of the flag's image as a large grid or matrix, `M`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Different Types of Rows in the Matrix:**\n    The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). Let's analyze the rows of the matrix `M`. Due to the flag's simple geometric design, there are only a few distinct types of rows.\n\n    *   **Type 1: Purely Red Rows.** These are rows that do not pass through any white pixels.\n        *   Any row that lies entirely below the canton is purely red.\n        *   Any row that passes through the horizontal bar of the red cross within the canton is also purely red (since the cross is red and the rest of the flag in that row is red).\n        *   All such rows will be identical, consisting only of the value `a`. Let's call this row vector `R_red = (a, a, a, ..., a)`.\n\n    *   **Type 2: Mixed Red and White Rows.** These are rows that pass through the white background of the canton (i.e., the parts of the canton that are not the red cross).\n        *   These rows will contain red sections and white sections. Specifically, a row of this type will have the value `a` (for the part of the flag outside the canton and for the vertical bar of the red cross) and the value `b` (for the white background of the canton).\n        *   All such rows will be identical to each other. Let's call this row vector `R_mix`. For example, `R_mix = (..., a, a, ..., b, b, ..., a, a, ...)`. The exact pattern of `a`'s and `b`'s depends on the dimensions of the cross, but all rows of this type share the same pattern.\n\n4.  **Determine the Row Space and Rank:**\n    The entire matrix `M` is composed of only these two types of rows (`R_red` and `R_mix`). The set of all rows in the matrix is just a collection of many copies of `R_red` and many copies of `R_mix`.\n\n    The row space of the matrix `M` is the vector space spanned by all its rows. Since all rows are either `R_red` or `R_mix`, the row space is `span({R_red, R_mix})`.\n\n    The rank of the matrix is the dimension of its row space. The dimension of the space spanned by two vectors can be at most 2. Thus, the rank of matrix `M` can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Conditions for Each Possible Rank:**\n    We want to find the *maximal possible* rank, which means we can choose the values of `a` and `b` to achieve this maximum.\n\n    *   **Rank 0:** The rank is 0 if and only if both spanning vectors are the zero vector. This happens only if `a = 0` and `b = 0`.\n\n    *   **Rank 1:** The rank is 1 if the two vectors `R_red` and `R_mix` are linearly dependent (and at least one is non-zero). This occurs if one vector is a scalar multiple of the other.\n        *   Case A: If `a = b` (and not both zero). Then `R_red = (a, a, ..., a)` and `R_mix` also becomes `(a, a, ..., a)`. The two vectors are identical, so they span a 1-dimensional space. The rank is 1.\n        *   Case B: If `a = 0` and `b ≠ 0`. Then `R_red` is the zero vector `(0, 0, ..., 0)`. `R_mix` becomes `(..., 0, ..., b, ..., 0, ...)`, which is a non-zero vector. The space is spanned by a single non-zero vector, so the rank is 1.\n\n    *   **Rank 2:** The rank is 2 if the two vectors `R_red` and `R_mix` are linearly independent. This happens if one is not a scalar multiple of the other. Based on the analysis above, this occurs whenever `a ≠ b` and `a ≠ 0`.\n        *   For example, let `a = 1` and `b = 0`.\n            *   `R_red = (1, 1, 1, ..., 1)`\n            *   `R_mix = (..., 1, ..., 0, ..., 1, ...)`\n            These two vectors are clearly not multiples of each other, so they are linearly independent. The rank is 2.\n        *   Another example, let `a = 2` and `b = 1`.\n            *   `R_red = (2, 2, 2, ..., 2)`\n            *   `R_mix = (..., 2, ..., 1, ..., 2, ...)`\n            Again, `R_mix` is not a multiple of `R_red`. They are linearly independent, and the rank is 2.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Generality:** The analysis does not depend on the specific dimensions of the flag, the canton, or the cross, as long as all described regions (red field, white background, red cross) exist and have a non-zero area.\n*   **Distinct Row Types:** The core insight is that a complex-looking matrix is built from just two fundamental row patterns.\n*   **Maximization:** The question asks for the *maximal possible* rank. We have shown that a rank of 2 is achievable by choosing appropriate values for `a` and `b` (e.g., `a=1, b=0`). Since the rank cannot exceed 2, this is the maximum.\n\nThe maximal possible rank of the matrix is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
