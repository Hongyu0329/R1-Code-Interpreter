No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The reason is that SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical effect that requires the material to have a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾). This property is only present in materials that lack a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., are non-centrosymmetric). The common, stable polymorphs of boron nanosheets all possess centrosymmetric crystal structures, meaning their intrinsic χ⁽²⁾ is zero.
