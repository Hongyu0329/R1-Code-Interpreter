    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core physical process: Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC).**\nSPDC is a quantum optical process where one photon of higher energy (the \"pump\" photon, frequency ω_p) spontaneously splits into two photons of lower energy (the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons, frequencies ω_s and ω_i) inside a nonlinear optical medium. This is a second-order nonlinear optical effect, meaning its strength is proportional to the square of the incident electric field.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the fundamental material requirement for SPDC.**\nSecond-order nonlinear optical effects, including SPDC and its counterpart, second-harmonic generation (SHG), are governed by the material's second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, denoted as χ⁽²⁾. For an SPDC process to occur with any significant efficiency, the material must have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the material requirement (non-zero χ⁽²⁾) to its crystal structure.**\nUnder the electric dipole approximation, which describes the dominant light-matter interaction, a material can only possess a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ if its crystal structure lacks a center of inversion. Such materials are called \"non-centrosymmetric\". If a material's crystal lattice has an inversion center (i.e., it is \"centrosymmetric\"), its χ⁽²⁾ is identically zero, and it cannot support second-order nonlinear processes like SPDC.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the crystal structure of boron nanosheets (borophene).**\nBoron nanosheets are 2D allotropes of boron, similar to how graphene is a 2D allotrope of carbon. Borophene is known to exist in several different atomic arrangements, known as polymorphs. The most common and stable predicted/synthesized phases include:\n*   β₁₂ borophene (space group *Pmmm*)\n*   χ₃ borophene (space group *Cmcm*)\n*   Striped borophene (space group *Pmmn*)\n\nAll of these common space groups (*Pmmm*, *Cmcm*, *Pmmn*) describe crystal structures that **possess a center of inversion**. They are centrosymmetric.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the findings to answer the question.**\nSince the common, stable structures of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, their intrinsic second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero. As SPDC is a process that requires a non-zero χ⁽²⁾, one would not expect ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets to exhibit this effect.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ideal vs. Real-World Materials:** The conclusion is based on the ideal crystal structure. In real-world, fabricated nanosheets, imperfections such as strains, wrinkles, tears, edges, and atomic defects can locally break the inversion symmetry of the lattice. These symmetry-breaking features could, in principle, induce a weak, localized χ⁽²⁾ response, potentially leading to a very weak SPDC signal. However, this would be an extrinsic effect, not an intrinsic property of the material itself. The primary *expectation* for the material is based on its ideal structure.\n2.  **Comparison to other 2D materials:** This contrasts with other 2D materials like single-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂). Monolayer MoS₂ is intrinsically non-centrosymmetric, has a large χ⁽²⁾, and is well-known to exhibit strong second-harmonic generation and has been used to generate SPDC. Graphene, like borophene, is centrosymmetric and does not intrinsically exhibit second-order effects.\n3.  **\"Free-standing\" condition:** The question specifies \"free-standing\". This is important because placing a centrosymmetric material on a substrate can break the overall symmetry of the system (material + substrate) and induce a nonlinear response. This possibility is excluded by the problem's premise.\n4.  **Higher-Order Contributions:** Extremely weak nonlinear effects can occur in centrosymmetric media through higher-order interactions (e.g., electric quadrupole or magnetic dipole). These effects are typically many orders of magnitude weaker than the electric-dipole-allowed effects in non-centrosymmetric materials and are generally not what is meant when discussing SPDC in a practical context.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis of the fundamental physical requirements and the material's intrinsic properties, the conclusion is as follows.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The reason is that SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical effect that requires the material to have a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾). This property is only present in materials that lack a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., are non-centrosymmetric). The common, stable polymorphs of boron nanosheets all possess centrosymmetric crystal structures, meaning their intrinsic χ⁽²⁾ is zero.>>>"
