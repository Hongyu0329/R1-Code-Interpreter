    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, including careful points to consider, leading to the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The Functional Integral and Euclidean Action**\n\nIn finite-temperature quantum field theory, the partition function $Z$ for a system described by a field $\\phi$ at temperature $T=1/\\beta$ is given by a functional integral (or path integral) over all possible field configurations. For a neutral scalar field $\\phi(x)$, this is:\n\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n\n*   $S_E[\\phi]$ is the **Euclidean action**. We work in Euclidean spacetime where the time coordinate is imaginary, $\\tau = it$, and the metric is positive definite.\n*   The integral is over all field configurations $\\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$ that are **periodic in imaginary time** with period $\\beta$. This periodicity condition, $\\phi(0, \\mathbf{x}) = \\phi(\\beta, \\mathbf{x})$, is a direct consequence of taking the trace in the statistical mechanical definition of the partition function, $Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta H})$.\n\nFor a free, neutral scalar field of mass $m$, the Euclidean Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}_E$ is:\n$\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)(\\partial_\\mu \\phi) + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2$\n\nThe Euclidean action is the integral of this density over Euclidean spacetime:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n\n**Step 2: Expressing the Action in a Quadratic Form**\n\nThe term $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ represents the action written in a quadratic form, analogous to $\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{v}^T A \\mathbf{v}$ in linear algebra. Our goal is to manipulate the expression for $S_E[\\phi]$ to find the differential operator $D_\\phi$. The action should take the form:\n\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} (\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(x) D_\\phi \\phi(x)$\n\nThe standard definition of the inner product for real functions over a domain $\\Omega$ is $(f, g) = \\int_\\Omega dx f(x)g(x)$. Here, the domain is the Euclidean spacetime cylinder $[0, \\beta] \\times \\mathbb{R}^d$.\n\n**Step 3: Using Integration by Parts**\n\nTo isolate the operator $D_\\phi$, we use integration by parts on the derivative terms in the action.\n\n1.  **Time derivative term:**\n    $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 = \\left[ \\phi (\\partial_\\tau \\phi) \\right]_0^\\beta - \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\phi (\\partial_\\tau^2 \\phi)$\n    The boundary term $\\left[ \\phi (\\partial_\\tau \\phi) \\right]_0^\\beta$ vanishes because of the periodicity of $\\phi$ in imaginary time.\n\n2.  **Spatial derivative term:**\n    $\\int d^d x \\, (\\nabla \\phi)^2 = - \\int d^d x \\, \\phi (\\nabla^2 \\phi)$\n    This holds assuming the standard boundary condition that the field $\\phi$ vanishes at spatial infinity, which ensures the surface term from the integration is zero.\n\n**Step 4: Assembling the Final Form**\n\nNow we substitute these integrated forms back into the expression for the Euclidean action:\n\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (-\\phi \\partial_\\tau^2 \\phi) + \\frac{1}{2} (-\\phi \\nabla^2 \\phi) + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n\nWe can factor out the fields $\\phi$ to reveal the operator:\n\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\left( -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$\n\n**Step 5: Identifying the Inner Product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$**\n\nComparing this result to the general form $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D_\\phi)$, we can identify the components:\n\n*   The operator is $D_\\phi = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$. This is the **Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator**. It is sometimes written as $D_\\phi = -\\Box_E + m^2$, where $\\Box_E = \\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2$ is the Euclidean d'Alembertian.\n*   The inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is the full integral expression, which is equal to twice the free Euclidean action:\n    $(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\left( -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) = 2S_E[\\phi]$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Euclidean vs. Minkowski Space:** The entire formulation is in Euclidean spacetime. The sign convention is crucial; the Klein-Gordon operator in Euclidean space has the form $(-\\Box_E + m^2)$, whereas in Minkowski space it is $(\\Box_M + m^2) = (\\partial_t^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2)$.\n2.  **Boundary Conditions:** The derivation relies heavily on the boundary conditions. The periodicity in imaginary time, $\\phi(0, \\mathbf{x}) = \\phi(\\beta, \\mathbf{x})$, is essential for making the boundary term from the time integration vanish. The assumption that fields decay at spatial infinity is also used.\n3.  **Free Theory:** This result holds for the free (non-interacting) part of the action. If interaction terms like $\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$ were present, the full action would not be a simple quadratic form, and this \"inner product\" would only describe the kinetic and mass terms (the \"Gaussian\" part of the integral).\n4.  **Meaning of $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$:** The notation represents the full quadratic form in the exponent of the functional integral, not just the operator $D_\\phi$. It is the quantity whose exponential is integrated to find the partition function.\n\n***\n\nThe final answer is the explicit integral form of the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$.\n\n<<<int_0^beta dtau int d^d x , phi(tau, x) ( - partial_tau^2 - nabla^2 + m^2 ) phi(tau, x)>>>"
