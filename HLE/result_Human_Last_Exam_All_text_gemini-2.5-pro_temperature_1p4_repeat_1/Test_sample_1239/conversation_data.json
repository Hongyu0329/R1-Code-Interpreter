    "Answering this question requires finding the Lie algebra of infinitesimal symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and determining its dimension.\n\n### Step 1: Write down the equations\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ for a fluid with constant viscosity $\\nu > 0$ and density $\\rho=1$ are a system of partial differential equations for the velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}) = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and the pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$:\n\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $(t, \\mathbf{x})$ are the independent variables (time and space), and $(\\mathbf{u}, p)$ are the dependent variables.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Symmetries\n\nA symmetry of these equations is a transformation of the independent and dependent variables that maps any solution to another solution. We find the Lie algebra of these symmetries, whose elements are infinitesimal generators (vector fields). The dimension of the Lie group is the dimension of its Lie algebra. The full symmetry group is infinite-dimensional, but the question is understood to be about the maximal finite-dimensional Lie subalgebra, often called the \"principal\" or \"classical\" symmetry algebra.\n\nWe list the generators of this finite-dimensional algebra, which arise from fundamental physical principles and scaling properties.\n\n1.  **Time Translation:** The equations are autonomous (no explicit dependence on $t$), so they are invariant under time shifts $t \\to t + s$.\n    *   Generator: $T = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$\n    *   Dimension: 1\n\n2.  **Space Translations:** The equations are set in homogeneous space $\\mathbb{R}^3$, so they are invariant under spatial shifts $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$.\n    *   Generators: $P_i = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$.\n    *   Dimension: 3\n\n3.  **Space Rotations:** The equations are isotropic (no preferred direction), so they are invariant under rotations $\\mathbf{x} \\to R\\mathbf{x}$ (where $R \\in SO(3)$). The velocity $\\mathbf{u}$ transforms as a vector and the pressure $p$ as a scalar.\n    *   Generators: $J_k = \\sum_{i,j=1}^3 \\epsilon_{kij} (x_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} + u_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_j})$ for $k=1, 2, 3$.\n    *   Dimension: 3\n\n4.  **Galilean Boosts:** The equations are invariant under a change of inertial reference frame. This corresponds to the Galilean transformation:\n    $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$, $t \\to t$, $p \\to p$.\n    *   Generators: $G_i = t\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$.\n    *   Dimension: 3\n\n5.  **Scaling Transformation:** The equations admit a specific scaling symmetry. By substituting $t' = \\lambda^a t$, $\\mathbf{x}' = \\lambda^b \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u}' = \\lambda^c \\mathbf{u}$, $p' = \\lambda^d p$ into the equations and requiring invariance, we find the relations $a=2, b=1, c=-1, d=-2$ (up to a common power). This leads to the scaling transformation:\n    $t \\to \\lambda^2 t, \\quad \\mathbf{x} \\to \\lambda \\mathbf{x}, \\quad \\mathbf{u} \\to \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}, \\quad p \\to \\lambda^{-2} p$.\n    *   Generator: $D = 2t\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} - \\sum_{i=1}^3 u_i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i} - 2p\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$.\n    *   Dimension: 1\n\n6.  **Pressure Shift:** The pressure $p$ only appears through its gradient $\\nabla p$. Therefore, shifting the pressure by a constant, $p \\to p+c$, does not change the equations.\n    *   Generator: $I = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$.\n    *   Dimension: 1\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Dimension\n\nThese generators form a closed Lie algebra under the commutator bracket. We sum the dimensions contributed by each type of symmetry:\n\n*   Time translation: 1\n*   Space translations: 3\n*   Space rotations: 3\n*   Galilean boosts: 3\n*   Scaling: 1\n*   Pressure shift: 1\n\nTotal Dimension = $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\n\nIt is important to note that the full Lie group of symmetries is infinite-dimensional. The additional symmetries correspond to, for instance, adding an arbitrary function of time to the pressure ($p \\to p + f(t)$), or adding any solution of the linear Stokes equations to a solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. However, the standard interpretation of this question is to ask for the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional subgroup.\n\nThe dimension of this finite-dimensional Lie group of symmetries is 12."
