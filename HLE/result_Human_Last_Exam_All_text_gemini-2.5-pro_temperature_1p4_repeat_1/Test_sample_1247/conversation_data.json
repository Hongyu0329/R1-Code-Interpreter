    "Answering this question requires analyzing permutations \\(\\sigma \\in S_{333}\\) that satisfy two conditions:\n1.  They avoid the pattern 1324. This means there are no indices \\(i<j<k<l\\) such that \\(\\sigma_i < \\sigma_k < \\sigma_j < \\sigma_l\\).\n2.  They have exactly \\(k=3\\) inversions. An inversion is a pair of indices \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(i < j\\) and \\(\\sigma_i > \\sigma_j\\).\n\nLet's first characterize permutations with exactly 3 inversions. A permutation has a low number of inversions if it is \"close\" to the identity permutation \\((1, 2, 3, \\dots, n)\\). Most elements \\(\\sigma_i\\) are equal to \\(i\\). The elements for which \\(\\sigma_i \\ne i\\) are called displaced elements. For a permutation to have few inversions, its displaced elements must be few and not moved far from their original positions.\n\nAny permutation with \\(k\\) inversions can be characterized by its set of inversions. The set of inversions of a permutation with 3 inversions must be one of the following structural types, determined by how the three inverted pairs relate to each other. Let an inversion be denoted by the pair of values \\((a,b)\\) where \\(a>b\\) and \\(a\\) appears before \\(b\\) in the permutation.\n1.  \\(\\{(d,a), (d,b), (d,c)\\}\\): One element \\(d\\) is inverted with respect to three smaller elements \\(a, b, c\\). For this to be exactly 3 inversions, the elements \\(a,b,c\\) must appear in increasing order. The local structure is \\(\\dots d \\dots a \\dots b \\dots c \\dots\\). To minimize inversions, these elements must be close. This structure corresponds to a permutation where the displaced elements are \\((d, a, b, c)\\) forming a local pattern of relative order 4123, such as \\(\\sigma_i=d, \\sigma_{i+1}=a, \\sigma_{i+2}=b, \\sigma_{i+3}=c\\). Let's call this a **Type A** permutation.\n2.  \\(\\{(c,a), (c,b), (b,a)\\}\\): Three elements \\(c>b>a\\) are fully inverted relative to each other. This corresponds to a local pattern of relative order 321, such as \\(\\sigma_i=c, \\sigma_{i+1}=b, \\sigma_{i+2}=a\\). Let's call this a **Type B** permutation.\n3.  \\(\\{(c,a), (c,b), (e,d)\\}\\): Two inversions involve one element \\(c\\), and the third is disjoint. This corresponds to a local 21 pattern and another separate 21 pattern, like \\(\\dots c \\dots a \\dots b \\dots\\) and \\(\\dots e \\dots d \\dots\\). This forms structures like \\(c a b \\dots e d\\) e.g. 312...54.\n4.  \\(\\{(b,a), (d,c), (f,e)\\}\\): Three disjoint inversions.\n5. Other structures involving more than 4 displaced elements, like those arising from cycles of length > 4.\n\nA crucial observation is that permutations with few inversions have their displaced elements clustered together. If the displaced elements are far apart, they are more likely to form a 1324 pattern with the many fixed points \\(\\sigma_i=i\\) that lie between them. For example, \\(\\sigma = 21543...\\). The inversions are \\((2,1), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)\\). 4 inversions. The pattern \\(\\sigma_1<\\sigma_4<\\sigma_3<\\sigma_2\\) is not possible. A 1324-pattern is formed by \\(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_4 = 2,5,1,4 \\implies\\) not increasing indices. How about \\(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_4, \\sigma_5 = 2,1,4,3 \\implies 1<4<2<3\\), No. How about \\(1,5,3, \\dots\\)?\n\nIt's a known property that for a permutation \\(\\sigma\\) to avoid 1324, certain structural constraints must be met. Our analysis will proceed by checking which permutations with 3 inversions satisfy these constraints. The permutations that avoid 1324 are those where the displaced elements are clustered at the very beginning or very end of the permutation. Any other arrangement tends to create a 1324 pattern by interacting with the fixed points.\n\nLet \\(\\tau\\) be a permutation of \\(\\{1, 2, \\dots, m\\}\\) with 3 inversions. Consider \\(\\sigma = \\tau_1 \\tau_2 \\dots \\tau_m (m+1) \\dots n\\).\n\\(\\sigma\\) avoids 1324 if \\(\\tau\\) avoids 1324 and there's no pattern formed by mixing \\(\\tau\\) and the fixed points. A mixed pattern \\(\\sigma_a < \\sigma_c < \\sigma_b < \\sigma_d\\) would require \\(a, b, c \\le m\\) and \\(d > m\\), with \\(\\sigma_a < \\sigma_c < \\sigma_b\\). This means \\(\\tau\\) must not contain a 132-subsequence.\n\nBy reversing the permutation and its elements (reverse-complement), we can analyze the case where the displaced elements are at the end. \\(\\sigma\\) avoids 1324 iff \\(\\sigma^{rc}\\) avoids \\(1324^{rc}=1324\\). This is not the tool needed. Direct analysis is better.\nIf \\(\\sigma = 1 \\dots (n-m) \\tau'_1 \\dots \\tau'_m\\), where \\(\\tau'\\) is a permutation on \\(\\{n-m+1, \\dots, n\\}\\). A mixed pattern is formed if \\(a \\le n-m\\) and \\(b,c,d > n-m\\). This requires \\(\\sigma_b, \\sigma_c, \\sigma_d\\) to form a 213-like subsequence (\\(\\sigma_c < \\sigma_b < \\sigma_d\\)).\n\nSo we need to find all permutations \\(\\tau\\) on \\(\\{1, \\dots, m\\}\\) with 3 inversions, and check if they contain a 132 or 213 subsequence.\nThe permutations on a minimal set of elements \\(\\{1, ..., m\\}\\) with 3 inversions are:\n-   m=3: \\(\\tau = 321\\). Inversions: \\((3,2), (3,1), (2,1)\\). (3 total)\n-   m=4: There are 6 such permutations:\n    -   \\(\\tau = 4123\\). Inversions: \\((4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\\).\n    -   \\(\\tau = 1432\\). Inversions: \\((4,3), (4,2), (3,2)\\).\n    -   \\(\\tau = 2413\\). Inversions: \\((2,1), (4,1), (4,3)\\).\n    -   \\(\\tau = 3142\\). Inversions: \\((3,1), (3,2), (4,2)\\).\n    -   \\(\\tau = 3214\\). Inversions: \\((3,2), (3,1), (2,1)\\). (this is 321 on \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\) with 4 as a fixed point)\n    -   \\(\\tau = 2341\\). Inversions: \\((2,1), (3,1), (4,1)\\).\n\n**Prefix Case: Displaced elements at the beginning.** (\\(\\sigma = \\tau \\oplus Id_{n-m}\\))\nWe check which of these \\(\\tau\\) do *not* contain a 132 subsequence.\n-   \\(\\tau = 321\\): No 132 subsequence. -> **1 avoider** (\\(32145...333\\))\n-   \\(\\tau = 4123\\): No 132 subsequence. -> **1 avoider** (\\(41235...333\\))\n-   \\(\\tau = 1432\\): Contains 143, 142, 132 as subsequences. Not an avoider.\n-   \\(\\tau = 2413\\): No 132 subsequence. -> **1 avoider** (\\(24135...333\\))\n-   \\(\\tau = 3142\\): Contains 142. Not an avoider.\n-   \\(\\tau = 3214\\): No 132 subsequence. -> **1 avoider** (\\(32145...333\\))\n-   \\(\\tau = 2341\\): No 132 subsequence. -> **1 avoider** (\\(23415...333\\))\nNote that \\(3214\\) is essentially the case \\(m=3\\) (\\(321\\)) with the next element \\(4\\) being a fixed point relative to the block. So \\(3214\\) doesn't add a new permutation type, it is just a different choice of \\(\\tau\\). The permutation starts with 3214.\nWe have 5 permutations whose prefix is a \\(\\tau\\) from the list. Wait, 3214 is the same form as 321..., but \\(m=4\\) not 3. This is subtle. The number of avoiders is the number of distinct permutations from \\(S_{333}\\).\n1.  \\(\\sigma = 32145...\\)\n2.  \\(\\sigma = 41235...\\)\n3.  \\(\\sigma = 24135...\\)\n4.  \\(\\sigma = 23415...\\)\nThese are 4 distinct permutations.\n\n**Suffix Case: Displaced elements at the end.** (\\(\\sigma = Id_{n-m} \\oplus \\tau\\))\nWe check which of these \\(\\tau\\) do *not* contain a 213 subsequence.\n-   \\(\\tau = 321\\): No 213 subsequence. -> **1 avoider** (\\(...330,333,332,331\\))\n-   \\(\\tau = 4123\\): No 213 subsequence. -> **1 avoider** (\\(...329,333,330,331,332\\))\n-   \\(\\tau = 1432\\): No 213 subsequence. -> **1 avoider** (\\(...329,330,333,332,331\\))\n-   \\(\\tau = 2413\\): Contains 213 and 413. Not an avoider.\n-   \\(\\tau = 3142\\): Contains 312. Also 314 is 213. Not an avoider.\n-   \\(\\tau = 3214\\): Contains 324, 214, 314. Not an avoider.\n-   \\(\\tau = 2341\\): No 213 subsequence. -> **1 avoider** (\\(...329,331,332,333,330\\))\nThis gives 4 distinct permutations where the displaced numbers are at the end.\n\nThe two sets of permutations are disjoint. The first set has \\(\\sigma_i = i\\) for \\(i>4\\), while the second set has \\(\\sigma_i = i\\) for \\(i<333-4\\). For \\(n=333\\), these sets are disjoint.\nSo, the total number of such permutations is the sum of the counts from the two cases.\n\nTotal count = (Number of prefix-type avoiders) + (Number of suffix-type avoiders)\nTotal count = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nThe eight permutations are:\n1.  The permutation beginning with the pattern 3214...\n2.  The permutation beginning with the pattern 4123...\n3.  The permutation beginning with the pattern 2413...\n4.  The permutation beginning with the pattern 2341...\n5.  The permutation ending with the pattern ...n(n-1)(n-2)\n6.  The permutation ending with the pattern ...n(n-3)(n-2)(n-1)\n7.  The permutation ending with the pattern ...(n-3)n(n-1)(n-2)\n8.  The permutation ending with the pattern ...(n-2)(n-1)n(n-3)\n\nEach of these corresponds to a unique permutation in \\(S_{333}\\) with 3 inversions that avoids the 1324 pattern."
