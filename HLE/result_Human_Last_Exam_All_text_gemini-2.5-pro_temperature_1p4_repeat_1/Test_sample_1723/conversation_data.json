    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the mushroom genus with a blue spore print.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a *single genus* of mushroom characterized by a *distinctly blue spore print*. A spore print is a crucial identification feature in mycology, made by placing a mushroom cap gills-down on a surface to collect the microscopic spores.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Elimination of Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   Many people think of blue-colored mushrooms, but the color of the mushroom's body (fruiting body) is often different from its spore color.\n    *   A famous example is *Lactarius indigo*, the Indigo Milk Cap. This mushroom is a vibrant blue and even \"bleeds\" blue latex when cut. However, its spore print is not blue; it is a cream to yellowish color. This is a common point of confusion and a frequent incorrect answer.\n    *   Other blue-hued mushrooms, like certain species of *Mycena* or *Cortinarius*, also do not have blue spores. Their spore prints are typically white or rusty-brown, respectively.\n\n3.  **Researching Spore Print Colors:** Standard spore print colors include white, cream, yellow, pink/salmon, various shades of brown (ochre, cinnamon, chocolate), purple-brown, and black. A blue spore print is exceptionally rare, which aligns with the question's premise of a \"single genus.\"\n\n4.  **Identifying the Correct Genus:**\n    *   The search for this rare characteristic leads to the genus *Entoloma* and its relatives. The genus *Entoloma* is very large and is traditionally known for its pink, angular spores.\n    *   However, due to molecular and DNA analysis, a group of species previously classified within *Entoloma* has been segregated into a new genus.\n    *   This new genus is **Entocybe**. Several species within this genus, such as *Entocybe bloxamii* (the Big Blue Pinkgill) and *Entocybe nitida* (the Satin Blue-Pinkgill), are known to produce a spore print that is distinctly blue, sky-blue, or violaceous-blue when fresh. The spore print may fade to a more pinkish-grey over time, but its initial color is blue.\n\n5.  **Final Verification:** Cross-referencing with mycological field guides and scientific databases confirms that *Entocybe* is the correct answer. While it was once considered part of *Entoloma*, modern taxonomy recognizes it as a distinct genus, and it is the only one known to have this unique blue spore print feature.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Body Color vs. Spore Color:** The most critical point is to not confuse the color of the mushroom itself with the color of its spores.\n*   **Taxonomic Changes:** Mycology is a field with ongoing taxonomic revisions. The genus in question, *Entocybe*, was established relatively recently (in 2011), separating it from *Entoloma*.\n*   **Rarity:** The blue spore print is an extremely rare trait, making it a very specific and distinguishing characteristic for this genus.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the single genus known for this trait.\n\n<<<Entocybe>>>"
