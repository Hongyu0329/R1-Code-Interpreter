    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question asks to identify a specific novel based on two key pieces of information, both attributed to the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges:\n    *   **A specific quote about the novel:** It has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n    *   **A description of the novel's author:** He is \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues and Identify the Author:**\n    *   The description of an author as a \"continuator... of Faulkner\" is a significant critical statement. Borges, a keen reader of English-language literature, often compared his contemporaries to masters like Faulkner.\n    *   Research into Borges's essays, prologues, and reviews reveals that he consistently applied this description to the Uruguayan novelist **Juan Carlos Onetti**. Onetti's dense, psychologically complex style, his creation of the mythical city of Santa María (akin to Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County), and his themes of alienation and decay led Borges and other critics to see him as a direct heir to Faulkner's legacy in Latin American literature.\n\n3.  **Trace the Quote to a Specific Novel:**\n    *   Now that we have identified the author as Juan Carlos Onetti, we need to find which of his novels Borges described with the quote about the \"intensity of a tiger.\"\n    *   This quote comes from a very early and influential review Borges wrote. In November 1939, Borges published a review in the literary magazine *Sur* for Onetti's debut novella.\n    *   In that review, Borges praised the work, stating that this brief novel possesses \"la intensidad de un tigre o de una música\" (\"the intensity of a tiger or a piece of music\") and the complexity and variety of a chess match.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   The author whom Borges described as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is Juan Carlos Onetti.\n    *   The novel by Onetti that Borges described as having \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\" is his first one.\n    *   Therefore, the novel in question is Onetti's 1939 debut work.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Accuracy of Attribution:** It is crucial to confirm that both the quote and the author description originate from Borges. In this case, both are well-documented in his critical writings and in literary studies of both Borges and Onetti.\n*   **Original Language and Translation:** The original Spanish quote is slightly different (\"la intensidad de un tigre o de una música\") but the essence, including the comparison to chess, is the same. The \"tiger\" metaphor is the key identifier.\n*   **Identifying the Specific Work:** Borges wrote about Onetti on other occasions, but this particular, very famous quote is tied directly to his review of Onetti's first novel, distinguishing it from his later works.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis confirms that the author is Juan Carlos Onetti, and the novel is his 1939 debut novella, which Borges reviewed in the magazine *Sur*.\n\nThe name of this novel is **El pozo** (published in English as *The Pit*).\n\n<<<El pozo>>>"
