    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Group and the Question**\n\n*   The question asks for the number of involutions in the Projective Special Unitary group PSU(4, 997).\n*   An involution is an element `g` of a group such that `g^2 = 1` and `g ≠ 1`.\n*   The group `PSU(n, q)` is defined as `PSU(n, q^2) = SU(n, q^2) / Z(SU(n, q^2))`. Here, `n=4` and `q=997`, so the group is `PSU(4, 997^2)`. The notation `PSU(n,q)` is often used for `PSU(n, q^2)`, which is the case here. Let's work with the field `GF(997^2)`. Let's denote `q=997`.\n*   `SU(n, q^2)` is the Special Unitary group: `n x n` matrices `A` over `GF(q^2)` with `A*A = I` and `det(A) = 1`. `A*` is the conjugate transpose.\n*   `Z(SU(n, q^2))` is the center of `SU(n, q^2)`.\n\n**2. Relate Involutions in PSU to Elements in SU**\n\n*   Let `π: SU(4, q^2) -> PSU(4, q^2)` be the canonical projection map.\n*   An element `g ∈ PSU(4, q^2)` is an involution if `g^2 = 1` and `g ≠ 1`.\n*   If `g = π(A)` for some `A ∈ SU(4, q^2)`, then `g^2 = π(A^2) = 1`. This implies `A^2 ∈ Z(SU(4, q^2))`.\n*   The condition `g ≠ 1` means `A ∉ Z(SU(4, q^2))`.\n*   So, we need to count the number of elements `A ∈ SU(4, q^2)` such that `A^2` is in the center, but `A` is not. Let this set of elements be `S`.\n*   The number of involutions in `PSU(4, q^2)` is `|S| / |Z(SU(4, q^2))|`.\n\n**3. Determine the Center of SU(4, 997^2)**\n\n*   The center `Z` consists of scalar matrices `λI` that are in `SU(4, q^2)`.\n*   The conditions are: `det(λI) = λ^4 = 1` and `(λI)*(λI) = λ̄λI = λ^{q+1}I = I`.\n*   So, `λ` must satisfy `λ^4 = 1` and `λ^(q+1) = 1`. This means `λ` must be a `d`-th root of unity, where `d = gcd(4, q+1)`.\n*   For `q=997`, `d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998)`. Since `998 = 2 * 499`, `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\n*   So, `|Z| = 2`. The center is `Z = {I, -I}` because `λ=1` and `λ=-1` are the only elements in `GF(997^2)` satisfying `λ^2=1`.\n\n**4. Classify the Pre-images in SU(4, 997^2)**\n\nWe are looking for elements `A ∈ SU(4, q^2)` such that `A^2 ∈ {I, -I}` and `A ∉ {I, -I}`. This gives two cases:\n*   **Case 1: `A^2 = I`** (and `A ≠ ±I`). These are the non-central involutions in `SU(4, q^2)`.\n*   **Case 2: `A^2 = -I`**. These are elements of order 4 in `SU(4, q^2)`. (Note: if `A^2=-I` and `A` were central, `A=λI`, then `λ^2=-1`, but `A*A=λ̄λI=I`. If `q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`, `λ \\in GF(q)`, so `λ̄=λ`, which implies `λ^2=1`, a contradiction. So elements with `A^2=-I` are never central in this case).\n\n**5. Count the Elements in Case 1 (`A^2 = I`)**\n\n*   An involution `A` is diagonalizable with eigenvalues `±1`.\n*   `det(A)=1` implies the number of `-1` eigenvalues must be even.\n*   `A ≠ ±I` means the multiplicity of `-1` is not 0 or 4. So it must be 2.\n*   The eigenvalues are `(1, 1, -1, -1)`.\n*   Such an element `A` corresponds to an orthogonal decomposition of the unitary space `V = W \\oplus W^⊥`, where `W` is the 2-dimensional eigenspace for `-1` and `W^⊥` is the 2-dimensional eigenspace for `+1`. `W` must be non-degenerate.\n*   The number of such elements is the number of ways to choose a non-degenerate 2-dimensional subspace `W`.\n*   This number is given by `|GU(n, q^2)| / (|GU(k, q^2)| |GU(n-k, q^2)|)`.\n*   For `n=4, k=2`, the number of such elements is `|C₁| = |GU(4, q^2)| / |GU(2, q^2)|^2`.\n*   Using the formula `|GU(k, q^2)| = q^{k(k-1)/2} \\prod_{i=1}^{k} (q^i - (-1)^i)`, we find:\n    *   `|C₁| = q^4 (q^2+1) (q^2-q+1)`.\n\n**6. Count the Elements in Case 2 (`A^2 = -I`)**\n\n*   The structure of these elements depends on whether `t^2+1=0` is reducible over `GF(q)`.\n*   This depends on `q \\pmod 4`. Here `q = 997 = 4 \\times 249 + 1`, so `q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`.\n*   This implies there exists an element `j \\in GF(q)` such that `j^2 = -1`.\n*   The eigenvalues `λ` of `A` must satisfy `λ^2 = -1`, so `λ = ±j`.\n*   The unitarity condition requires that if `λ` is an eigenvalue, so is `1/λ̄`. Since `j ∈ GF(q)`, `j̄=j`, so `1/j = -j`. This means `j` and `-j` must appear as eigenvalues with the same multiplicity.\n*   Since `n=4`, the eigenvalues must be `(j, j, -j, -j)`. This gives `det(A) = j^2(-j)^2 = j^4 = (-1)^2 = 1`.\n*   For such matrices, the space `V` decomposes into a direct sum of two 2-dimensional *maximal totally isotropic* subspaces `V_j` and `V_{-j}`.\n*   The number of such elements is found by computing the size of the conjugacy class, which is `|SU(4, q^2)| / |C_{SU(4, q^2)}(A)|`, where `C(A)` is the centralizer of `A`.\n*   The centralizer `C_{GU(4, q^2)}(A)` is isomorphic to `GL(2, q^2)`. The centralizer within `SU` corresponds to the subgroup of `X ∈ GL(2, q^2)` where `det(X) ∈ GF(q)^*`.\n*   The size of the centralizer `C_{SU(4, q^2)}(A)` is `q^2(q^4-1)(q-1)`.\n*   The number of elements is `|C₂| = |SU(4, q^2)| / |C_{SU(4, q^2)}(A)| = q^4 (q+1)^2 (q^2-q+1)`.\n\n**7. Calculate the Total Number of Involutions**\n\n*   The total number of pre-images (elements in `S`) is `|S| = |C₁| + |C₂|`.\n*   `|S| = q^4 (q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + q^4 (q+1)^2 (q^2-q+1)`\n*   `|S| = q^4 (q^2-q+1) [ (q^2+1) + (q+1)^2 ]`\n*   `|S| = q^4 (q^2-q+1) [ q^2+1 + q^2+2q+1 ]`\n*   `|S| = q^4 (q^2-q+1) [ 2q^2+2q+2 ]`\n*   `|S| = 2 q^4 (q^2-q+1) (q^2+q+1)`\n*   Using the identity `(x-y)(x+y) = x^2-y^2` is not directly useful, but we know `(q^2-q+1)(q^2+q+1) = (q^2+1-q)(q^2+1+q) = (q^2+1)^2 - q^2 = q^4+2q^2+1-q^2 = q^4+q^2+1`.\n*   `|S| = 2 q^4 (q^4+q^2+1)`.\n*   The number of involutions in `PSU(4, q^2)` is `|S| / |Z|`.\n*   Number of involutions = `(2 q^4 (q^4+q^2+1)) / 2 = q^4 (q^4+q^2+1)`.\n\n**8. Final Answer**\n\n*   Substituting `q = 997` into the formula gives the number of involutions.\n*   Number = `997^4 (997^4 + 997^2 + 1)`.\n\nThe final answer is this expression. It is not typically required to compute the full numerical value, which is astronomically large.\n\nFinal Answer: The number of involutions is `q^4 (q^4 + q^2 + 1)` where `q=997`.\n\n<<<997^4 * (997^4 + 997^2 + 1)>>>"
