    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of each coiled-coil protein sequence.\n\n**Fundamental Principles of Coiled-Coil Oligomerization**\n\nThe oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) of a coiled-coil is primarily determined by the amino acid residues at the core positions of the heptad repeat, denoted `a` and `d`. The heptad repeat is a seven-amino-acid pattern `(abcdefg)`.\n\n1.  **Hydrophobic Core:** Positions `a` and `d` are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues. These residues pack together to form the stable core of the coiled-coil structure.\n2.  **Packing Rules (Knobs-into-Holes):** The geometry of the side chains at `a` and `d` dictates how the helices can pack together.\n    *   **Dimers:** Often favored by non-β-branched residues (like Leucine, L) at `a` and `d`. Polar residues like Asparagine (N) at `a` or `d` can form specific hydrogen bonds that strongly favor dimers.\n    *   **Trimers:** Favored by a β-branched residue (like Isoleucine, I, or Valine, V) at the `a` position and a non-β-branched residue (like Leucine, L, or Alanine, A) at the `d` position. The `Ia-Td` pair (Isoleucine at `a`, Threonine at `d`) is also a strong trimer motif.\n    *   **Tetramers:** Favored when β-branched residues occupy both `a` and `d` positions (e.g., `Ia-Id`) or in the reverse orientation of a trimer (`La-Id`).\n    *   **Higher-Order Oligomers:** Often require specific patterns, such as polar residues (e.g., Glutamine, Q) placed in the core (e.g., `Ia-Qd` for pentamers).\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Sequence**\n\nFirst, we need to identify the correct heptad repeat frame. A consistent frame places hydrophobic residues at positions `a` and `d`. For all the given sequences, a frame assignment starting with the first residue at position `g` works best (`g-a-b-c-d-e-f`).\n\n*   **`a` positions:** Residues 2, 9, 16, 23\n*   **`d` positions:** Residues 5, 12, 19, 26\n\n---\n\n**1. Sequence: EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**\n*   **`a` positions:** I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n*   **`d` positions:** A, A, W, A (Alanine, Tryptophan)\n*   **Analysis:** The core is dominated by the `Ia-Ad` pairing. While the `Ia-Ld` pairing is a classic trimer motif, the Alanine (A) side chain is very small. This may not provide enough steric constraint to enforce a trimeric structure over the default, more common dimeric state. Given the options, it is most plausible that this sequence forms a **Dimer (2)**.\n\n**2. Sequence: EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**\n*   **`a` positions:** I, I, N, I (Isoleucine, Asparagine)\n*   **`d` positions:** A, A, A, A (Alanine)\n*   **Analysis:** This sequence is similar to the first but has a single Asparagine (N), a polar residue, at an `a` position. An N residue in the core is a powerful determinant. It can form a specific inter-helical hydrogen bond (N-N pair) that strongly stabilizes a parallel dimeric structure. This single substitution is sufficient to enforce a **Dimer (2)** state.\n\n**3. Sequence: EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**\n*   **`a` positions:** I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n*   **`d` positions:** I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n*   **Analysis:** The core consists exclusively of Isoleucine at both `a` and `d` positions (`Ia-Id`). Packing β-branched Isoleucine residues at all core positions is a canonical motif for forming a **Tetramer (4)**.\n\n**4. Sequence: EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**\n*   **`a` positions:** I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n*   **`d` positions:** Q, Q, W, Q (Glutamine, Tryptophan)\n*   **Analysis:** This core contains the polar residue Glutamine (Q) at most `d` positions. While specially designed `Ia-Qd` motifs can form pentamers, the introduction of polar residues into the hydrophobic core is generally destabilizing for higher-order structures. A plausible outcome is that the coiled-coil reverts to the stable dimeric state, which might be further stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the Q residues at the `d-d'` interface. Therefore, this sequence likely forms a **Dimer (2)**.\n\n**5. Sequence: EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**\n*   **`a` positions:** I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n*   **`d` positions:** T, T, W, T (Threonine, Tryptophan)\n*   **Analysis:** The core is dominated by the `Ia-Td` pairing. Threonine (T) is a β-branched amino acid whose hydroxyl group can form stabilizing hydrogen bonds within the trimeric interface. The `Ia-Td` pairing is a well-established motif for forming a **Trimer (3)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the analysis for each sequence gives the following oligomeric states:\n*   Sequence 1: **2**\n*   Sequence 2: **2**\n*   Sequence 3: **4**\n*   Sequence 4: **2**\n*   Sequence 5: **3**\n\nThe resulting sequence of states is **2, 2, 4, 2, 3**. This corresponds to answer choice D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
