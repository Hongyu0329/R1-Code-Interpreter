    "The problem asks for the conditions under which a system of three functions, `F`, `G`, and `H`, has a \"tripled fixed point\". This is a concept from fixed-point theory, typically analyzed in the context of metric spaces. The solution involves defining the tripled fixed point, constructing an operator on a product space, and then applying the Banach Fixed Point Theorem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the \"FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\"**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the question and define the core concept. The function signatures are given as:\n*   `F: X * Y * Z → X`\n*   `G: Y * X * Y → Y`\n*   `H: Z * Y * X → Z`\n(Note: The question listed `G` twice; we assume the third function is `H` with a signature that fits the pattern, such as `H: Z*Y*X → Z`.)\n\nAn **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triple `(x, y, z)` with `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, `z ∈ Z` that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations, where the arguments for each function are drawn from the triple in a way that respects their domains:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**Step 2: Reframe as a Single Fixed Point Problem**\n\nTo find conditions for the existence of a solution, we can reframe this system of three equations as a single fixed-point problem.\n*   **Define the Product Space:** Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be metric spaces. We can form the product space `W = X × Y × Z`. We can equip `W` with a metric, for instance, the sum metric:\n    `d((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n*   **Define a Combined Operator:** We define a single operator `T: W → W` as:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n*   **Equivalence:** A fixed point of this operator `T` is a point `(x, y, z)` such that `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`. This is exactly the definition of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Banach Fixed Point Theorem**\n\nThe Banach Fixed Point Theorem provides a powerful tool for guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point. The theorem states:\n> If `(W, d)` is a non-empty **complete metric space** and `T: W → W` is a **contraction mapping**, then `T` has a unique fixed point in `W`.\n\nBased on this theorem, we need two main conditions:\n1.  The space `(W, d)` must be complete.\n2.  The operator `T` must be a contraction.\n\n**Step 4: Derive the Conditions on F, G, and H**\n\n*   **Condition 1: Completeness.** For the product space `(W, d)` to be complete, the individual spaces `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be complete metric spaces.\n\n*   **Condition 2: Contraction.** For the operator `T` to be a contraction, there must exist a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `w₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `w₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `W`, the following inequality holds:\n    `d(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * d(w₁, w₂)`\n\nLet's expand `d(T(w₁), T(w₂))`:\n`d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂))`\n\nThis global inequality will be satisfied if `F`, `G`, and `H` satisfy individual Lipschitz-type (contractive) conditions. We assume there exist non-negative constants such that:\n\na) For `F`: `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α*d_X(x₁, x₂) + β*d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ*d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\nb) For `G`: `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ ε*d_X(x₁, x₂) + δ'*d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\nc) For `H`: `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ ι*d_X(x₁, x₂) + θ*d_Y(y₁, y₂) + η*d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\nSumming these inequalities gives:\n`d(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ (α+ε+ι)d_X(x₁,x₂) + (β+δ'+θ)d_Y(y₁,y₂) + (γ+η)d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\nLet `k = max(α+ε+ι, β+δ'+θ, γ+η)`. The inequality becomes:\n`d(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)) = k * d(w₁, w₂)`\n\nFor `T` to be a contraction, we must have `k < 1`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Defining the Problem:** The term \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" is not standard. Its definition must be inferred from the function signatures and the context of fixed point theory. Our definition `F(x,y,z)=x, G(y,x,y)=y, H(z,y,x)=z` is a logical interpretation.\n2.  **Prerequisites on Spaces:** The conditions rely on the assumption that `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are not just sets, but **complete metric spaces**. Without this structure, the Banach Fixed Point Theorem cannot be applied.\n3.  **Nature of the Conditions:** The derived conditions are **sufficient**, not always necessary. They guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the FGH-tripled fixed point. Other theorems (e.g., based on partially ordered sets) could provide alternative conditions.\n4.  **Uniqueness:** A key consequence of using the Banach Fixed Point Theorem is that if the conditions are met, the FGH-tripled fixed point is **unique**.\n5.  **Contraction Coefficients:** The constants (`α, β, γ`, etc.) must be non-negative. The final global condition (`max(...) < 1`) ensures that the combined operator `T` shrinks distances in the product space, forcing any sequence of iterations to converge to a single point.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point exists and is unique for the functions `F: X*Y*Z→X`, `G: Y*X*Y→Y`, and `H: Z*Y*X→Z` if the following conditions are met:\n1.  **Space Requirement:** `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces.\n2.  **Contraction Requirement:** There exist non-negative constants (`α, β, γ, ε, δ', ι, θ, η`) such that for any two points `(x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `(x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `X×Y×Z`, the functions satisfy the following inequalities:\n    a) `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α*d_X(x₁, x₂) + β*d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ*d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    b) `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ ε*d_X(x₁, x₂) + δ'*d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n    c) `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ ι*d_X(x₁, x₂) + θ*d_Y(y₁, y₂) + η*d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n3.  **Global Condition:** The sum of the contraction constants for each dimension of the product space is less than 1. Formally:\n    `max(α + ε + ι, β + δ' + θ, γ + η) < 1`>>>"
