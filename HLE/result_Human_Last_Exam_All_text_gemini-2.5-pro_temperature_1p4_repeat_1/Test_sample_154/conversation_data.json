    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n**1. Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph with no loops and no multiple edges.\n*   **5 Vertices:** The graph has a set of vertices V where |V|=5.\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We are counting distinct graph structures, not labeled graphs.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected:** A graph G is 2-vertex-connected if its vertex connectivity, κ(G), is at least 2. This means the graph is connected and remains connected even after removing any single vertex. A key property of such graphs is that the minimum degree of any vertex, δ(G), must be at least 2.\n\n**2. Strategy**\n\nA systematic way to find these graphs is to enumerate them by the number of edges, |E|. For a graph with n=5 vertices to be 2-vertex-connected, it must have at least n=5 edges. The maximum number of edges is C(5,2) = 10. So, we will examine graphs with |E| from 5 to 10.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n*   **Case |E| < 5:**\n    A graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges to be connected. If |E| < 4, the graph is disconnected. If |E| = 4, the only connected graphs on 5 vertices are trees (specifically, the path P5 and the three other non-isomorphic trees). All trees with n > 2 have at least two leaves (degree-1 vertices). Removing a vertex adjacent to a leaf will disconnect the leaf, making it a cut-vertex. Therefore, no graph with |E| ≤ 4 is 2-vertex-connected.\n\n*   **Case |E| = 5:**\n    For a graph with n vertices and n edges to be 2-connected, it must be a cycle.\n    *   **Graph 1:** The 5-cycle (C5). This graph is 2-vertex-connected because removing any vertex leaves a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected. Its degree sequence is (2, 2, 2, 2, 2).\n    (Total for |E|=5: 1 graph)\n\n*   **Case |E| = 6:**\n    We can construct these graphs by adding an edge (a chord) to C5. Since C5 is vertex-transitive, adding any chord results in an isomorphic graph.\n    *   **Graph 2:** C5 plus a chord (e.g., connecting vertices 1 and 3 in C5=1-2-3-4-5-1). Adding an edge to a 2-connected graph preserves 2-connectivity. This graph is unique for |E|=6. Its degree sequence is (2, 2, 2, 3, 3). This graph is also the complement of the path graph P5.\n    (Total for |E|=6: 1 graph)\n\n*   **Case |E| = 7:**\n    We can add an edge to the unique 2-connected graph with 6 edges. By analyzing the symmetries of that graph, we find there are two non-isomorphic ways to add an edge.\n    This can also be analyzed by considering the complement graph, which would have C(5,2) - 7 = 3 edges. There are two non-isomorphic graphs on 5 vertices with 3 edges that have a 2-connected complement: P4 U K1 (a path of 4 vertices and an isolated vertex) and P3 U P2 (a path of 3 vertices and a disjoint edge).\n    *   **Graph 3:** The complement of P4 U K1. This graph has a degree sequence of (2, 2, 3, 3, 4).\n    *   **Graph 4:** The complement of P3 U P2. This graph has a degree sequence of (2, 3, 3, 3, 3).\n    Both are 2-vertex-connected.\n    (Total for |E|=7: 2 graphs)\n\n*   **Case |E| = 8:**\n    The complement graph has 2 edges. There are two such non-isomorphic graphs: P3 U 2K1 (a path of 3 vertices and two isolated vertices) and 2P2 U K1 (two disjoint edges and an isolated vertex).\n    *   **Graph 5:** The complement of P3 U 2K1. Its degree sequence is (2, 3, 3, 4, 4).\n    *   **Graph 6:** The complement of 2P2 U K1. This is the wheel graph W5. Its degree sequence is (3, 3, 3, 3, 4).\n    Both are 2-vertex-connected (in fact, 3-vertex-connected).\n    (Total for |E|=8: 2 graphs)\n\n*   **Case |E| = 9:**\n    The complement graph has 1 edge (K2 U 3K1).\n    *   **Graph 7:** The complement of K2 U 3K1. This is the complete graph K5 with one edge removed (K5-e). It is 3-vertex-connected, hence also 2-vertex-connected.\n    (Total for |E|=9: 1 graph)\n\n*   **Case |E| = 10:**\n    The only simple graph with 5 vertices and 10 edges is the complete graph K5.\n    *   **Graph 8:** The complete graph K5. The connectivity of Kn is n-1, so κ(K5)=4. It is 2-vertex-connected.\n    (Total for |E|=10: 1 graph)\n\n**Final Count**\n\nSumming the number of graphs from each case:\n*   |E|=5: 1\n*   |E|=6: 1\n*   |E|=7: 2\n*   |E|=8: 2\n*   |E|=9: 1\n*   |E|=10: 1\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8.\n\nThere are 8 such graphs.\n\n<<<8>>>"
