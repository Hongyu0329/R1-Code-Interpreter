No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is not considered radial. It typically follows the Parker Spiral, making a substantial angle with the radial direction. The use of magnetic components perpendicular to the radial direction is an approximation; the physically correct method for field-aligned AIC waves is to use components perpendicular to the local background magnetic field, which requires transforming the data into a Field-Aligned Coordinate system.
