    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, along with careful points to consider, leading to the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Terms**\n*   **Beyond-Use Date (BUD):** This is the date and/or time after which a compounded sterile preparation or an opened medication container should not be used. The BUD's purpose is to ensure the product remains sterile, stable, and potent.\n*   **Single-Dose Container (SDC):** A container of a sterile medication intended for a single use in a single patient. SDCs, by definition, lack an antimicrobial preservative. An ampule is a type of SDC.\n*   **Ampule:** A sealed glass or plastic container with a neck that must be broken to access the sterile medication inside.\n*   **Puncture:** In the context of an ampule, this means \"broken open,\" as ampules are not punctured with a needle like vials are.\n*   **Sterile Environment:** This refers to a controlled environment designed to prevent microbial contamination, such as an ISO Class 5 Primary Engineering Control (PEC), which includes Laminar Airflow Workbenches (LAFWs) and Biological Safety Cabinets (BSCs).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Critical Difference Between Ampules and Vials**\n*   This is the most important point for answering the question correctly.\n*   A **vial** has a rubber stopper. When a needle punctures the stopper and is withdrawn, the stopper reseals to a degree, providing a barrier against the outside environment.\n*   An **ampule**, once broken, is an open container. It cannot be resealed. Its contents are continuously and completely exposed to the surrounding air.\n\n**Step 3: Consult the Governing Standard (USP Chapter <797>)**\n*   The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797> provides the standards for sterile compounding, including BUDs.\n*   The 2023 version of USP <797> states that a single-dose container (like a vial) that has been punctured within a sterile environment (ISO Class 5 PEC) can be used for up to **12 hours**.\n*   **However**, this rule is intended for containers that maintain a closed system, like a vial with a resealing stopper. It is not intended for an open ampule.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Principle of Aseptic Technique to an Open Ampule**\n*   Because an ampule becomes an open system once broken, the risk of contamination is immediate and high, even within the clean air of a sterile environment. There is no barrier to protect the contents from airborne particles or microorganisms.\n*   Due to this high risk, the fundamental principle of aseptic technique dictates that the contents of a freshly opened ampule must be used immediately.\n*   \"Immediate use\" means the contents should be drawn into a syringe promptly after the ampule is opened, without any period of storage.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and Conclude**\n*   Although USP <797> provides a 12-hour BUD for SDCs opened in a sterile environment, this rule does not safely apply to ampules due to their open-system nature after being broken.\n*   The standard of practice and the core principle of maintaining sterility require that an opened ampule not be stored for any length of time.\n*   Therefore, the BUD for the ampule and its contents is **immediate use**. Any contents not withdrawn immediately after opening must be discarded along with the opened ampule.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe medication from an ampule must be withdrawn immediately after it is opened. The ampule and any unused contents must then be discarded. There is no storage time allowed.\n\n<<<Immediate use>>>"
