    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Movement:** *Cambré derrière*. This is a classical ballet movement meaning \"arched to the back.\" It involves bending the upper torso backward from the waist.\n    *   **Methods:** Vaganova and Balanchine. These are two distinct and influential methods or styles of ballet training, each with its own aesthetic, technique, and pedagogical approach. The Vaganova method is a codified Russian system known for its precision and strength. The Balanchine method (or style) was developed by George Balanchine for the New York City Ballet and is known for its speed, dynamism, and unique aesthetic lines.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the primary technical or stylistic difference in the execution of this specific movement between these two methods.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Vaganova *Cambré Derrière*:**\n    *   **Foundation:** The Vaganova method places a strong emphasis on a stable and strong core and proper alignment.\n    *   **Hip Placement:** In a *cambré derrière*, the hips must remain absolutely square and stable, directly over the supporting legs/feet. The dancer is taught to lift the chest up and then arch the upper back, keeping the weight over the balls of the feet. Pushing the hips forward is considered a technical fault as it breaks the line and indicates a lack of control and back strength.\n    *   **The Line:** The resulting line is a pure, clean curve of the upper and middle spine over a solid, vertical foundation from the hips down. The focus is on spinal flexibility and control.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Balanchine *Cambré Derrière*:**\n    *   **Aesthetic:** The Balanchine style often prioritizes creating dramatic, expansive lines and visual effects, sometimes by modifying classical rules.\n    *   **Hip Placement:** The most notable characteristic of a Balanchine *cambré derrière* is the deliberate pushing of the hips forward as the upper body bends back. This action creates a much deeper and more extreme-looking arch.\n    *   **The Line:** Instead of a pure spinal curve over a stable base, the Balanchine version creates a large \"C\" curve with the entire body. While it can be visually spectacular, it relies on a different principle of leverage and creates a shape that is \"broken\" by Vaganova standards.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices based on the Analysis:**\n\n    *   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there might be subtle differences in arm styling or the *allongé* (extended) quality, the basic pathways of the arms are often similar. This is not the most fundamental or defining difference.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the core difference identified in the analysis. Vaganova keeps the hips stable and aligned, while Balanchine allows them to push forward. This is a major technical and aesthetic distinction.\n    *   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's choreography is famous for its speed, a *cambré* is fundamentally an *adagio* (slow, sustained) movement. Its speed is not the primary distinguishing factor; the execution of the shape is.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** The degree of the backbend is a *result* of the technique used. The Balanchine method *achieves* a greater visual degree of backbend precisely *because* of the forward hip placement. Therefore, hip placement is the root cause and the more accurate technical distinction.\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head generally follows the line of the spine to complete the arch. While there may be stylistic nuances in the gaze or angle, it's not the primary point of divergence compared to the hip action.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most significant, well-known, and technically fundamental difference between the Vaganova and Balanchine execution of a *cambré derrière* lies in the **placement of the hip**. Vaganova demands stability, while Balanchine utilizes a forward press of the hips to create a different aesthetic line.\n\n<<<B>>>"
