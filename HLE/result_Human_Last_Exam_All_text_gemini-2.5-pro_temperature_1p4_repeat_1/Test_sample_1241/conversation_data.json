    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of steady-state probabilities, $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$, for a system described by a set of linear ordinary differential equations known as the Kolmogorov-Chapman system. These equations model the dynamics of a continuous-time Markov chain with four states {0, 1, 2, 3}. The steady-state probabilities, denoted as $P_i = \\lim_{t \\to +\\infty} P_i(t)$, are the long-term probabilities of the system being in each state.\n\n**2. Careful Points and Correction of the Equations**\n\nA crucial step in analyzing this problem is to verify the validity of the given equations. For a system of probabilities, the sum of probabilities must be conserved, i.e., $\\sum_{i=0}^{3} P_i(t) = 1$. Differentiating this with respect to time gives $\\sum_{i=0}^{3} P_i'(t) = 0$.\n\nLet's check if the given system of equations satisfies this condition:\n- $P_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)$\n- $P_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n- $P_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t)$\n- $P_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n\nSumming these equations:\n$\\sum P_i'(t) = (-\\lambda_{01} - \\lambda_{01})P_0(t) + (\\lambda_{10} - \\lambda_{10} - \\lambda_{12} + \\lambda_{12})P_1(t) + (\\lambda_{21} - \\lambda_{21} - \\lambda_{23} + \\lambda_{23})P_2(t) + (\\lambda_{31} - \\lambda_{31})P_3(t)$\n$\\sum P_i'(t) = -2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$\n\nSince $\\sum P_i'(t)$ must be 0 and $\\lambda_{01}=0.019 \\ne 0$, this implies $P_0(t) = 0$ for all $t$. If we impose this condition, the system becomes inconsistent, as it leads to a contradiction when trying to find a steady state.\n\nThis indicates a typo in the problem statement. In a standard Kolmogorov-Chapman system, the term corresponding to a transition from state $i$ to state $j$ (rate $\\lambda_{ij}$) should appear as $+\\lambda_{ij}P_i(t)$ in the equation for $P_j'(t)$. The term $-\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$ in the equation for $P_1'(t)$ violates this principle, as it should represent the flow of probability *into* state 1 from state 0.\n\nThe corrected second equation should be:\n$P_{1}'(t) = \\mathbf{+\\lambda_{01}}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n\nWe will proceed with this corrected, physically meaningful system.\n\n**3. Setting up and Solving the Steady-State Equations**\n\nIn the steady state, $P_i'(t) = 0$. Let $P_i$ denote the steady-state probabilities. The corrected system becomes a set of linear algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}P_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1} + \\lambda_{21}P_{2} + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n5.  $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$ (Normalization)\n\nThese equations, often called balance equations, can be solved for $P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3$.\n\n**Step-by-step Solution:**\n\n**Step A: Express $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in terms of $P_1$.**\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$\\lambda_{01}P_{0} = \\lambda_{10}P_{1} \\implies P_{0} = \\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}}P_{1}$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$(\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_{2} = \\lambda_{12}P_{1} \\implies P_{2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}}P_{1}$\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$\\lambda_{31}P_{3} = \\lambda_{23}P_{2} \\implies P_{3} = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}}P_{2}$\n\n**Step B: Substitute the numerical values for the transition rates.**\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019, \\lambda_{10} = 0.65, \\lambda_{12} = 0.4, \\lambda_{21} = 0.392, \\lambda_{23} = 0.008, \\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\n$P_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}P_{1}$\n\n$P_{2} = \\frac{0.4}{0.392 + 0.008}P_{1} = \\frac{0.4}{0.4}P_{1} = P_{1}$\n\n$P_{3} = \\frac{0.008}{0.008}P_{2} = P_{2}$. Since $P_2 = P_1$, we have $P_{3} = P_{1}$.\n\n**Step C: Use the normalization condition to find $P_1$.**\nSubstitute the expressions for $P_0, P_2, P_3$ into the normalization equation (5):\n$P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right)P_{1} + P_{1} + P_{1} + P_{1} = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right)P_{1} = 1$\n$P_1 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}} = \\frac{0.019}{0.65 + 0.057} = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n**Step D: Calculate $P_0$ and the final sum $P_0 + P_1$.**\nNow, find $P_0$ using the expression from Step B:\n$P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\nFinally, compute the required sum $P_0 + P_1$:\n$P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\n**Step E: Calculate the final numerical value.**\n$\\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\nRounding to five decimal places gives 0.94625.\n\nFinal Answer\nThe final answer is $\\frac{0.669}{0.707}$.\n\n<<<0.94625>>>"
