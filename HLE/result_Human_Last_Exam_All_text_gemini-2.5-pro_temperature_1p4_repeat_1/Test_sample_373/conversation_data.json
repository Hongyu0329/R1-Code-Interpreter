    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Barbell Graph\n\nA barbell graph is constructed by connecting two complete graphs (the \"bells\") with a path. The problem specifies a barbell graph with 10 nodes. The most standard and symmetric construction for a barbell graph with an even number of nodes (2n) is to connect two identical complete graphs ($K_n$) with a single edge.\n\n1.  **Total Nodes**: $|V| = 10$.\n2.  **Cliques**: The graph consists of two complete graphs, $C_1$ and $C_2$. With 10 nodes in total, each clique must have 5 nodes. So, $C_1$ and $C_2$ are both $K_5$ graphs.\n3.  **Bottleneck Edge**: The two $K_5$ cliques are connected by a single edge. This edge is the \"bottleneck edge,\" as it's the only path between the two dense clusters of nodes. Let's call this edge $e_b$.\n4.  **Nodes connected by the bottleneck**: Let the bottleneck edge be $e_b = \\{u, v\\}$, where node $u$ is in clique $C_1$ and node $v$ is in clique $C_2$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Degrees of the Nodes\n\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. We need to find the degrees of the nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n\n1.  **Consider node `u`**: Node `u` belongs to the complete graph $C_1$ (a $K_5$). In a $K_5$, each node is connected to every other node. So, `u` is connected to the other 4 nodes within its own clique $C_1$.\n2.  Additionally, node `u` is connected to node `v` via the bottleneck edge.\n3.  Therefore, the total degree of node `u` is $\\text{deg}(u) = 4 (\\text{internal to } C_1) + 1 (\\text{bottleneck}) = 5$.\n4.  **Consider node `v`**: By symmetry, node `v` also has a degree of $\\text{deg}(v) = 4 (\\text{internal to } C_2) + 1 (\\text{bottleneck}) = 5$.\n\n### Step 3: Interpret the Sampling Process (\"Randomized Uniform Gossiping\")\n\nThe term \"gossiping\" refers to a class of algorithms where nodes in a network iteratively communicate with their neighbors to spread information. A standard model for a single step of \"randomized uniform gossoping\" is as follows:\n\n1.  **Select a Node**: One node is chosen uniformly at random from the set of all nodes in the graph. Since there are 10 nodes, the probability of picking any specific node is $1/|V| = 1/10$.\n2.  **Select a Neighbor**: The chosen node then selects one of its neighbors, again uniformly at random, to communicate with. The probability of choosing a specific neighbor depends on the node's degree. For a node `x`, the probability of it choosing neighbor `y` is $1/\\text{deg}(x)$.\n\nThis process defines a probability of sampling a *directed* edge $(x \\to y)$. The probability of sampling the undirected edge $\\{x, y\\}$ is the probability of either sampling $(x \\to y)$ or $(y \\to x)$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge\n\nWe want to find the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge $e_b = \\{u, v\\}$. This happens in two mutually exclusive scenarios:\n\n*   **Scenario A**: Node `u` is chosen, and it then chooses to gossip with its neighbor `v`.\n*   **Scenario B**: Node `v` is chosen, and it then chooses to gossip with its neighbor `u`.\n\nThe total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios.\n\n1.  **Probability of Scenario A ($u \\to v$)**:\n    *   Probability of choosing node `u` = $1/|V| = 1/10$.\n    *   Probability of `u` choosing `v` from its neighbors = $1/\\text{deg}(u) = 1/5$.\n    *   $P(u \\to v) = (1/10) \\times (1/5) = 1/50$.\n\n2.  **Probability of Scenario B ($v \\to u$)**:\n    *   Probability of choosing node `v` = $1/|V| = 1/10$.\n    *   Probability of `v` choosing `u` from its neighbors = $1/\\text{deg}(v) = 1/5$.\n    *   $P(v \\to u) = (1/10) \\times (1/5) = 1/50$.\n\n3.  **Total Probability**:\n    *   $P(\\text{sampling } e_b) = P(u \\to v) + P(v \\to u)$\n    *   $P(\\text{sampling } e_b) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50$.\n\n4.  **Final Answer**:\n    *   The probability simplifies to $1/25$.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Graph Identification**: Correctly interpreting the \"barbell graph with 10 nodes\" as two $K_5$ cliques connected by an edge is the necessary first step.\n*   **Degree Calculation**: Accurately calculating the degrees of the nodes connected by the bottleneck edge is critical. An error here would propagate through the entire calculation.\n*   **Gossip Model**: The choice of the gossiping model is the most important assumption. The random-node-random-neighbor model is a standard interpretation of randomized gossiping and accounts for the local connectivity (degree) of nodes, which is particularly relevant for bottlenecks.\n*   **Undirected Edge Probability**: Remembering to sum the probabilities for both directions of traversal ($u \\to v$ and $v \\to u$) is essential to find the probability of sampling the undirected edge.\n\nThe final probability is $1/25$.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
