    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the core concepts**\n\n*   **Curve of Genus 2:** A smooth, projective algebraic curve whose genus is 2.\n*   **Stable Curve:** A connected, projective curve of arithmetic genus $g \\ge 2$ with only ordinary double points (nodes) as singularities, and which has a finite automorphism group. The finiteness of the automorphism group is the key stability condition.\n*   **Stable Reduction:** The Stable Reduction Theorem of Deligne and Mumford states that any one-parameter family of smooth curves degenerating over a point can be extended to a family whose central fiber is a unique stable curve. The combinatorial type of this central fiber is the \"type of stable reduction\".\n*   **Arithmetic Genus:** For a nodal curve $C$ with $n$ irreducible components $C_i$ of geometric genera $g_i$, and a total of $\\delta$ nodes, the arithmetic genus $p_a(C)$ is given by the formula:\n    $p_a(C) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i + \\delta - n + 1$.\n    For a stable reduction of a genus 2 curve, the resulting stable curve must have an arithmetic genus of 2. So, we are classifying stable curves with $p_a(C) = 2$.\n*   **Stability Condition (practical check):** A nodal curve is stable if and only if for each of its irreducible components $C_i$, the pointed normalization $(\\tilde{C_i}, P_i)$ is stable, where $P_i$ is the set of points on the normalization $\\tilde{C_i}$ lying over the nodes of $C$. This translates to:\n    *   If a component $C_i$ is rational (geometric genus $g_i=0$), the number of points on its normalization lying over the nodes must be at least 3. This count is $2\\delta_i + v_i \\ge 3$, where $\\delta_i$ is the number of self-nodes on $C_i$ and $v_i$ is the number of nodes connecting $C_i$ to other components.\n    *   If a component $C_i$ is elliptic (geometric genus $g_i=1$), the number of points on its normalization lying over the nodes must be at least 1. This count is $2\\delta_i + v_i \\ge 1$.\n\n### **Step 2: Systematic enumeration of possibilities**\n\nWe classify the possibilities based on the number of irreducible components, $n$.\n\n**Case 1: Irreducible Curves ($n=1$)**\nThe formula becomes $p_a(C) = g_1 + \\delta - 1 + 1 = g_1 + \\delta = 2$.\n1.  **$\\delta = 0$:** This implies $g_1 = 2$. The curve is a smooth, non-singular curve of genus 2. This is the case of \"good reduction\". This is a valid type of stable curve.\n2.  **$\\delta = 1$:** This implies $g_1 = 1$. The curve is an irreducible elliptic curve with one node. The stability condition for an irreducible elliptic curve is that it must have at least one node. This is satisfied.\n3.  **$\\delta = 2$:** This implies $g_1 = 0$. The curve is an irreducible rational curve with two nodes. A rational curve is stable if and only if it has at least 3 nodes. This configuration is not stable.\n\n**Case 2: Reducible Curves with 2 Components ($n=2$)**\nThe formula is $p_a(C) = g_1 + g_2 + \\delta - 2 + 1 = g_1 + g_2 + \\delta - 1 = 2$, which means $g_1 + g_2 + \\delta = 3$. The curve must be connected, so there is at least one node between the components. Let $\\delta_{12}$ be the number of nodes connecting $C_1$ and $C_2$, and $\\delta_i$ be the number of self-nodes on $C_i$. Then $\\delta = \\delta_1 + \\delta_2 + \\delta_{12}$.\n\n4.  **$g_1=1, g_2=1$:** Then $\\delta=1$. Connectivity requires $\\delta_{12}=1$, so $\\delta_1=\\delta_2=0$.\n    *   $C_1$ (elliptic): has 1 connecting node. Special point count is 1. Stable.\n    *   $C_2$ (elliptic): has 1 connecting node. Special point count is 1. Stable.\n    This gives a stable type: **two elliptic curves meeting at one node**.\n5.  **$g_1=1, g_2=0$:** Then $\\delta=2$. So $\\delta_{12} + \\delta_1 + \\delta_2 = 2$.\n    *   Check stability for the rational component $C_2$: $2\\delta_2 + \\delta_{12} \\ge 3$.\n    *   If $\\delta_{12}=1$, then $\\delta_1+\\delta_2=1$. The stability condition for $C_2$ becomes $2\\delta_2+1 \\ge 3 \\implies \\delta_2 \\ge 1$. So we must have $\\delta_2=1$ and $\\delta_1=0$. Let's check stability for $C_1$ (elliptic): $2\\delta_1+\\delta_{12} = 2(0)+1=1 \\ge 1$. This works.\n    This gives a stable type: **an elliptic curve and a rational curve with one self-node meeting at one point**.\n    *   If $\\delta_{12}=2$, then $\\delta_1=\\delta_2=0$. Stability for $C_2$ fails: $2(0)+2 = 2 < 3$. Not stable.\n6.  **$g_1=0, g_2=0$:** Then $\\delta=3$. So $\\delta_{12} + \\delta_1 + \\delta_2 = 3$.\n    *   Stability for $C_1$: $2\\delta_1 + \\delta_{12} \\ge 3$.\n    *   Stability for $C_2$: $2\\delta_2 + \\delta_{12} \\ge 3$.\n    *   If $\\delta_{12}=1$, then $\\delta_1+\\delta_2=2$. Stability conditions are $2\\delta_1+1\\ge3 \\implies \\delta_1\\ge1$ and $2\\delta_2+1\\ge3 \\implies \\delta_2\\ge1$. The unique solution is $\\delta_1=1, \\delta_2=1$.\n    This gives a stable type: **two rational curves, each with one self-node, meeting at one point**.\n    *   If $\\delta_{12}=2$, then $\\delta_1+\\delta_2=1$. Stability for $C_1$ is $2\\delta_1+2\\ge3 \\implies \\delta_1\\ge1$. This implies $\\delta_1=1, \\delta_2=0$. But then stability for $C_2$ fails: $2(0)+2=2<3$. Not stable.\n    *   If $\\delta_{12}=3$, then $\\delta_1=\\delta_2=0$. Stability for $C_1$ is $2(0)+3\\ge3$. For $C_2$ it's $2(0)+3\\ge3$. Both are satisfied.\n    This gives a stable type: **two rational curves meeting at three distinct points**.\n\n**Case 3: Reducible Curves with 3 or more Components ($n \\ge 3$)**\nThe formula is $p_a(C) = \\sum g_i + \\delta - n + 1 = 2$.\nA systematic check of all possible configurations of genera and component graphs (chains, cycles) reveals that no stable configurations exist for $n \\ge 3$. For any configuration, at least one rational component will have fewer than 3 special points on its normalization, or an elliptic component will have 0 special points, violating the stability conditions.\nFor instance, for a chain of three rational curves ($n=3, g_i=0$), we get $\\delta=4$. For the middle component $C_2$ to be stable, it needs at least one self-node ($2\\delta_2 + 2 \\ge 3 \\implies \\delta_2 \\ge 1$). For the end components $C_1, C_3$ to be stable, they each need at least one self-node ($2\\delta_1+1 \\ge 3 \\implies \\delta_1 \\ge 1$, etc.). This requires at least 3 self-nodes in total, but we only have $\\delta_{12}+\\delta_{23}+\\delta_1+\\delta_2+\\delta_3=4$, and with $\\delta_{12} \\ge 1, \\delta_{23} \\ge 1$, we have at most 2 self-nodes. This leads to a contradiction. Similar contradictions arise in all other cases for $n \\ge 3$.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Count**\n\nBased on the exhaustive analysis, we have found 6 distinct combinatorial types of stable curves of arithmetic genus 2. These represent all possible types of stable reduction for a genus 2 curve.\n\nThe 6 types are:\n1.  A smooth curve of genus 2.\n2.  An irreducible elliptic curve with one node.\n3.  Two elliptic curves meeting at one node.\n4.  An elliptic curve and a rational curve with one self-node, meeting at one node.\n5.  Two rational curves, each with one self-node, meeting at one node.\n6.  Two rational curves meeting at three nodes.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 different types of stable reduction.\n\n<<<6>>>"
