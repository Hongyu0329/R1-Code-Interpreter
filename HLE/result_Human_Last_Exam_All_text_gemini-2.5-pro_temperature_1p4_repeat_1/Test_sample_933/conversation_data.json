    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) can be produced efficiently.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Synthesis Reaction**\nThe primary method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is the direct reaction between xenon (Xe) gas and fluorine (F₂) gas. The balanced chemical equation is:\nXe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Factors Affecting the Reaction**\n1.  **Thermodynamics:** The formation of XeF₄ from its elements is an exothermic reaction (ΔH = -251 kJ/mol). According to Le Chatelier's principle, lower temperatures favor the formation of the product in an exothermic reaction.\n2.  **Kinetics:** Chemical reactions require a certain amount of energy, known as activation energy, to proceed at a reasonable rate. For the reaction between xenon and fluorine, this activation energy is substantial because xenon is a noble gas and is very unreactive. Therefore, a sufficiently high temperature is needed to provide the reactant molecules with enough kinetic energy to overcome this energy barrier.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Balance between Thermodynamics and Kinetics**\nThere is a trade-off between the thermodynamic favorability (lower temperature) and the kinetic requirement (higher temperature).\n*   If the temperature is too low (e.g., room temperature or below), the reaction will be extremely slow, making the production process highly inefficient, even though the formation of the product is favored thermodynamically.\n*   If the temperature is too high, the reaction may proceed quickly, but the equilibrium can shift back towards the reactants, reducing the overall yield. Also, at very high temperatures, other xenon fluorides, such as xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆), may be formed, especially if there is an excess of fluorine.\n\n**Step 4: Research Established Synthesis Methods and Conditions**\nThe standard, well-established, and most efficient method for synthesizing XeF₄ involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine in a specific ratio (typically 1 part Xe to 5 parts F₂ by volume to prevent the formation of XeF₂) in a sealed nickel or Monel container.\n*   **Temperature:** The reaction is typically carried out at a temperature of **400 °C**. This temperature provides a sweet spot—it is high enough to overcome the activation energy for a high reaction rate and yield, but not so high that it causes significant decomposition of XeF₄ or favors the formation of XeF₆.\n*   **Pressure:** The reaction is also conducted under pressure, usually around 6 atmospheres, to increase the concentration of reactants and further promote the reaction.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Answer Choices**\nThe question asks for the *coldest* temperature at which production is *still efficient*. This implies we are looking for the lower bound of the optimal temperature range for the standard synthesis method.\n\n*   **A. 600 °C:** This temperature is too high. While the reaction would be fast, it would likely favor the formation of XeF₆ and reduce the yield of XeF₄.\n*   **B. 400 °C:** This is the widely cited and experimentally verified temperature for the efficient synthesis of XeF₄. It represents the optimal balance between reaction rate and product yield.\n*   **C. 200 °C:** At this temperature, the reaction rate would be significantly lower than at 400 °C. The process would be considered inefficient due to the long time required to produce a substantial amount of product.\n*   **D. 78 °C, E. 0 °C, F. -78 °C:** These temperatures are far too low to provide the necessary activation energy for a direct thermal reaction between xenon and fluorine. The reaction rate would be negligible, making production completely inefficient. (Note: Other non-thermal methods like photolysis or electric discharge can work at lower temperatures but are often less efficient for bulk synthesis).\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, 400 °C is the standard and efficient temperature for producing Xenon tetrafluoride. While a reaction might occur at slightly lower temperatures, the efficiency drops off significantly. Therefore, among the given choices, 400 °C is the best answer representing the coldest temperature for *efficient* production.\n\n<<<B>>>"
