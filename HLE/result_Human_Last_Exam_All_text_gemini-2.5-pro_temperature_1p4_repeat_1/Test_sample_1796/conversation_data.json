    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Sentence and the Target Word**\nThe sentence is: \"Fat people eat accumulates.\"\nThe question asks for the part of speech of the *first word*, which is \"Fat\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Grammatical Structure Around the Target Word**\nIn the sentence, the word \"Fat\" is placed directly before the word \"people\". The word \"people\" is a noun (referring to a group of persons).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Function of the Target Word**\nThe word \"Fat\" is used here to describe or modify the noun \"people\". It tells us *what kind* of people are being referred to. Words that describe or modify nouns are called adjectives. The phrase \"Fat people\" functions as the subject of the sentence.\n\n**Step 4: Consider Potential Confusions (Careful Points)**\n*   **The sentence is grammatically incorrect:** The verb part of the sentence, \"eat accumulates,\" is nonsensical as it contains two consecutive verbs. However, this grammatical error does not change the function of the word \"Fat\" at the beginning of the sentence. We must analyze the part of speech based on its role in the phrase it belongs to (\"Fat people\").\n*   **\"Fat\" can be a noun:** The word \"fat\" can also be used as a noun (e.g., \"This food contains a lot of fat.\"). But in the context of the given sentence, it is positioned before the noun \"people\" to describe it, which is the role of an adjective.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n*   A. Verb: A verb expresses an action or state of being. \"Fat\" is not an action here.\n*   B. Noun: A noun is a person, place, or thing. While \"fat\" can be a noun, here it is describing another noun (\"people\"), not acting as one itself.\n*   C. Adjective: An adjective modifies a noun or pronoun. \"Fat\" modifies the noun \"people\". This fits perfectly.\n*   D. Adverb: An adverb modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb. \"Fat\" is not modifying a verb or any other part of speech in that way.\n*   E. Conjunction: A conjunction connects words or clauses (e.g., and, but). \"Fat\" is not a conjunction.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, the word \"Fat\" is functioning as an adjective because it describes the noun \"people\".\n\n<<<C>>>"
