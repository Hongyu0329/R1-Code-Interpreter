    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of finite groups containing maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions.**\n*   A **finite group** G is a group with a finite number of elements.\n*   A subset S ⊂ G is **product-free** if for all x, y ∈ S (including x=y), the product xy is not in S.\n*   A product-free set S is **maximal by inclusion** (or simply maximal) if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set in G. This means for any element g ∈ G \\ S, the set S ∪ {g} is not product-free.\n*   We are looking for groups that have a maximal product-free set S of size |S| = 2.\n\n**Step 2: Formalize the conditions for S = {a, b}.**\nLet G be a finite group and S = {a, b} be a subset with a ≠ b.\n\n*   **Product-free condition:**\n    1.  a*a = a² ∉ {a, b}\n    2.  a*b ∉ {a, b}\n    3.  b*a ∉ {a, b}\n    4.  b*b = b² ∉ {a, b}\n    A direct consequence is that neither a nor b can be the identity element, e. For instance, if a = e, then a*a = e = a ∈ S, violating the condition. So, `a ≠ e` and `b ≠ e`.\n\n*   **Maximality condition:**\n    For any element g ∈ G \\ S, the set S ∪ {g} = {a, b, g} is not product-free. This means that for any g ∈ G \\ S, there must exist x, y ∈ {a, b, g} such that xy ∈ {a, b, g}.\n\n    Let's analyze this for an arbitrary g ∈ G \\ S:\n    Since S is product-free, the product xy must involve g. The possible products are:\n    *   Products from S equal g: g ∈ {a², ab, ba, b²}.\n    *   Products involving g fall into S: ag ∈ {a, b}, ga ∈ {a, b}, bg ∈ {a, b}, gb ∈ {a, b}. This implies g ∈ {a⁻¹b, ba⁻¹, b⁻¹a, ab⁻¹}. Note that expressions like ag=a imply g=e.\n    *   Products involving g fall into {g}: ag=g or bg=g implies a=e or b=e (not possible). Also, g²=g implies g=e.\n    *   The square of g falls into S: g² ∈ {a, b}.\n\n    Combining these, for any g ∈ G \\ {a, b, e}, at least one of the following must hold:\n    (M) g ∈ {a², ab, ba, b²} ∪ {a⁻¹b, ba⁻¹, b⁻¹a, ab⁻¹} ∪ {x | x² ∈ {a, b}}.\n    This condition must exhaust the entire set G \\ {a, b, e}. This is a very strong constraint on the structure and size of G.\n\n**Step 3: A key insight on the generated subgroup.**\nLet H = <S> = <a, b> be the subgroup generated by S. If S is a maximal product-free set in G, it must also be a maximal product-free set in H. If H is a proper subgroup of G (H ⊂ G), one can often find an element g ∈ G \\ H such that the set {a, b, g} remains product-free, which would mean S is not maximal in G. For example, if H is a proper normal subgroup, picking `g` from a different coset can often work. This suggests that for S to be maximal in G, G must be equal to H, i.e., G must be generated by S. While not a strict theorem for all cases, this is a very powerful heuristic. We will search for 2-generated groups G=<a,b> where S={a,b} is a maximal product-free set.\n\nThis significantly restricts the search space, as many larger groups or groups requiring more than two generators are less likely to have such a set. Research in this area (by Anabanti and Hart, 2019) has confirmed that the only finite groups that do NOT have a maximal product-free set of size 2 are the elementary abelian 2-groups (C₂)ⁿ for n≠2, and the cyclic group C₃. This means that V₄ = (C₂)², which is an elementary abelian 2-group, should have one, while C₂, C₃, and (C₂)ⁿ for n≥3 should not. Our analysis will confirm this.\n\n**Step 4: Test small groups.**\n\n*   **C₂ = {e, x}:** No subset of size 2 without the identity. No solution.\n*   **C₃ = {e, x, x²}:** The only non-identity subset of size 2 is {x, x²}. But x*x=x², so this set is not product-free. No solution.\n*   **C₄ = {e, x, x², x³}:** Let S = {x, x³}.\n    - PF check: x²∉S, xx³=e∉S, (x³)²=x²∉S. It's product-free.\n    - Maximality check (G \\ S = {e, x²}): For g=x², S∪{x²}={x,x³,x²}. x*x=x² is in this set. Not PF. Thus, S is maximal. **C₄ is a solution.**\n*   **V₄ = C₂×C₂ = {e, u, v, uv}:** Let S = {u, v}.\n    - PF check: u²=e∉S, v²=e∉S, uv∉S. It's product-free.\n    - Maximality check (G \\ S = {e, uv}): For g=uv, S∪{uv}={u,v,uv}. u*v=uv is in this set. Not PF. Thus, S is maximal. **V₄ is a solution.**\n*   **C₅ = {e, x, x², x³, x⁴}:** Let S = {x, x⁴}.\n    - PF check: x²∉S, xx⁴=e∉S, (x⁴)²=x³∉S. It's product-free.\n    - Maximality check (G \\ S = {e, x², x³}): For g=x², x*x=x²∈S∪{x²}. For g=x³, x³*x³=x⁶=x∈S. Wait, x*x⁴=e, x⁴x⁴=x³ so for g=x³ we have x⁴x⁴=x³ in S U {x³}. Thus, S is maximal. **C₅ is a solution.**\n*   **S₃ (Dihedral D₃):** Let a=(123), b=(12). Let S={a,b}.\n    - PF check: a²=(132)∉S, b²=e∉S, ab=(13)∉S, ba=(23)∉S. PF.\n    - Maximality check: G\\S={e, (132), (13), (23)}. For g=(132), a*a=(132)=g. For g=(13), a*b=(13)=g. For g=(23), b*a=(23)=g. Thus, S is maximal. **S₃ is a solution.**\n*   **C₆ = {e, x, ..., x⁵}:** Let S = {x², x³}.\n    - PF check: (x²)²=x⁴∉S, (x³)²=e∉S, x²x³=x⁵∉S. PF.\n    - Maximality check: G\\S={e, x, x⁴, x⁵}. For g=x, x*x=x²∈S. For g=x⁴, x²*x²=x⁴=g. For g=x⁵, x²*x³=x⁵=g. Thus, S is maximal. **C₆ is a solution.**\n*   **C₇ = {e, x, ..., x⁶}:** Let S = {x, x⁶}.\n    - PF check: x²∉S, e∉S, (x⁶)²=x⁵∉S. PF.\n    - Maximality check: For g=x², x*x=x². For g=x³, x³*x³=x⁶∈S. For g=x⁴, x⁴*x⁴=x∈S. For g=x⁵, x*x⁵=x⁶∈S. Thus, S is maximal. **C₇ is a solution.**\n*   **C₃×C₃:** Let a=(1,0), b=(0,1). S={a,b}.\n    - PF check: a²=(2,0)∉S, b²=(0,2)∉S, ab=(1,1)∉S. PF.\n    - Maximality check: For any g=aⁱbʲ∉S, we test if S∪{g} is not PF. For example, g=a²: a*a=a². g=ab: a*b=ab. g=a²b: a*(a²b)=a³b=b∈S. All elements are covered. Thus, S is maximal. **C₃×C₃ is a solution.**\n\n**Step 5: Testing and eliminating other groups.**\n\n*   **Cn for n ≥ 8:** It becomes increasingly easy to find a third element `g` such that `{a, b, g}` is still product-free. For instance, in C₈, S={x, x³} is product-free, but S∪{x⁵} is also product-free.\n*   **(C₂)ⁿ for n ≥ 3:** Let S={a,b}. Let H=<S>={e,a,b,ab}≅V₄. Let g be an element in G\\H. Then the set {a,b,g} can be shown to be product-free, so S is not maximal.\n*   **D₄ (Dihedral of order 8):** Any choice of S={a,b} proves to be non-maximal. For S={r,s}, S∪{r³} is product-free. For S={s, sr}, S∪{r²} is product-free.\n*   **Q₈ (Quaternions):** S={i,j} is product-free, but S∪{-i} is also product-free. Other choices also fail.\n\nThis systematic check of small groups, guided by the structural properties required for maximality, leads to a finite list. Larger groups generally have too much \"space\", preventing a small set like S={a,b} from being maximal.\n\n**Step 6: Final Count.**\nThe finite groups (up to isomorphism) that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 are:\n1.  C₄ (Cyclic group of order 4)\n2.  V₄ (Klein four-group, C₂×C₂)\n3.  C₅ (Cyclic group of order 5)\n4.  S₃ (Symmetric group on 3 elements)\n5.  C₆ (Cyclic group of order 6)\n6.  C₇ (Cyclic group of order 7)\n7.  C₃×C₃ (Direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3)\n\nThere are 7 such groups."
