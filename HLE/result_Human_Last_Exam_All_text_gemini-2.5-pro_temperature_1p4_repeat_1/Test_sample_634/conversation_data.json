    "This problem asks for the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices.\n\n### Step 1: Definition of GCRD and Method\nA polynomial matrix R(s) is a **right divisor** of P(s) if P(s) = Q(s)R(s) for some polynomial matrix Q(s).\n\nA polynomial matrix D(s) is a **greatest common right divisor (GCRD)** of P1(s) and P2(s) if:\n1.  D(s) is a common right divisor of both P1(s) and P2(s).\n2.  Any other common right divisor of P1(s) and P2(s) is a right divisor of D(s).\n\nThe GCRD is not unique; if D(s) is a GCRD, then so is U(s)D(s) for any unimodular matrix U(s) (a polynomial matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant). We typically seek a GCRD in a normalized form, like the row-reduced echelon form.\n\nThe standard method to find a GCRD is to use the Euclidean algorithm, which involves performing elementary row operations on a stacked matrix formed by P1(s) and P2(s).\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1(s) = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2(s) = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n### Step 2: Form the Stacked Matrix\nWe form the compound matrix M(s) by stacking P1(s) on top of P2(s):\nM(s) =\n[ s^2 + s,  -s     ]  (Row 1)\n[ -s^2 - 1,  s^2    ]  (Row 2)\n[ s,         0      ]  (Row 3)\n[ -s - 1,    1      ]  (Row 4)\n\n### Step 3: Apply Elementary Row Operations\nWe will perform elementary row operations on M(s) to reduce it to a simpler (row-echelon) form. The non-zero rows of the resulting matrix will form the GCRD.\n\n1.  **Use Row 3 to eliminate the first element of other rows.** The polynomial in the first element of Row 3, `s`, has the lowest degree.\n    *   **R1 <- R1 - (s+1) * R3**:\n        [ (s^2+s) - (s+1)s,  -s - (s+1)*0 ] = [ 0, -s ]\n    *   **R2 <- R2 + s * R3**: To determine the multiplier, we divide -s^2 - 1 by s, which gives -s with a remainder of -1. So the multiplier is -(-s) = s.\n        [ (-s^2-1) + s*s,  s^2 + s*0 ] = [ -1, s^2 ]\n    *   **R4 <- R4 + 1 * R3**: To determine the multiplier, we divide -s-1 by s, which gives -1 with a remainder of -1. So the multiplier is -(-1)=1.\n        [ (-s-1) + s,  1 + 0 ] = [ -1, 1 ]\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [ 0,        -s     ]\n    [ -1,       s^2    ]\n    [ s,        0      ]\n    [ -1,       1      ]\n\n2.  **Use the new Row 4, which is [-1, 1], to eliminate the first element of other rows.** Let's denote R4' = [-1, 1].\n    *   **R2 <- R2 - R4'**:\n        [ -1 - (-1), s^2 - 1 ] = [ 0, s^2 - 1 ]\n    *   **R3 <- R3 + s * R4'**:\n        [ s + s*(-1), 0 + s*1 ] = [ 0, s ]\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [ 0,        -s      ]\n    [ 0,        s^2 - 1 ]\n    [ 0,        s       ]\n    [ -1,       1       ]\n\n3.  **Simplify the rows with leading zeros.** We now have three rows where the first element is zero: [0, -s], [0, s^2 - 1], and [0, s]. We can think of this as finding the GCD of the second elements: -s, s^2-1, and s.\n    *   Let's use R_c = [0, s] to simplify the others.\n    *   **R_a = [0, -s]**: R_a_new = R_a + R_c = [0, -s+s] = [0, 0].\n    *   **R_b = [0, s^2 - 1]**: R_b_new = R_b - s*R_c = [0, (s^2-1) - s*s] = [0, -1].\n\n    So the rows [0, -s], [0, s^2-1], [0, s] are transformed into [0, 0], [0, -1], [0, s]. Since we now have a row [0, -1], we can use it to eliminate the 's' in [0, s].\n    *   **R_c_new = [0, s] + s*[0, -1] = [0, 0]**.\n\n    After these operations, the matrix simplifies to:\n    [ 0,        0       ]\n    [ 0,        -1      ]\n    [ 0,        0       ]\n    [ -1,       1       ]\n\n4.  **Final Reduction.** We are left with two non-zero rows, [-1, 1] and [0, -1]. We use the second row to eliminate the '1' in the first row.\n    *   **R_first <- [-1, 1] + [0, -1] = [-1, 0]**.\n\n    The final matrix with non-zero rows at the top is:\n    [ -1,   0 ]\n    [ 0,    -1 ]\n    [ 0,    0 ]\n    [ 0,    0 ]\n\n### Step 4: Identify the GCRD\nThe GCRD is formed by the non-zero rows of the reduced matrix.\nD(s) = [[-1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nThe determinant of this GCRD is det(D(s)) = (-1)*(-1) - 0*0 = 1. Since the determinant is a non-zero constant, D(s) is a unimodular matrix. This means that the original matrices P1(s) and P2(s) are **right coprime**.\n\nWhen the GCRD is unimodular, it is conventional to give the answer in the simplest unimodular form, which is the identity matrix I. We can obtain the identity matrix from our result D(s) by elementary row operations (multiplying each row by -1).\n-1 * [-1, 0] -> [1, 0]\n-1 * [0, -1] -> [0, 1]\n\nSo, the normalized GCRD in row-reduced echelon form is the identity matrix.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe greatest common right divisor of the given matrices P1(s) and P2(s) is the identity matrix.\n\n[[1, 0], [0, 1]]\n\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
