    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the core components of the question.**\n*   **Subject:** Pavel Milyukov. He was a prominent Russian historian and liberal politician, leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets).\n*   **Action:** He \"frequently accused the Western culture of his time\". This sets the general context.\n*   **Specifics:** He denounced \"X-Ys\" as a \"stagnant swamp\". This is the key piece of information. The term \"X-Ys\" represents a two-word phrase. The metaphor \"stagnant swamp\" implies decay, lack of progress, and corruption.\n\n**Step 2: Consider careful points and potential misunderstandings.**\n*   **Milyukov's Stance:** It is crucial to understand that while Milyukov was a \"Westernizer\" in his political and social views (advocating for a parliamentary democracy in Russia based on Western models), his aesthetic and cultural tastes were quite conservative. His \"Westernism\" was focused on rationalism, law, and political structure, not on what he perceived as the chaotic and irrational trends in modern Western culture.\n*   **The Target of Criticism:** His criticism was not aimed at Western culture as a whole, but at a specific, contemporary aspect of it that he found decadent.\n*   **\"X-Y\" format:** The placeholder suggests a two-word term used to describe a group or a movement.\n\n**Step 3: Conduct a focused search and analysis based on the clues.**\n*   Researching Pavel Milyukov's cultural criticisms reveals that he was a vocal and harsh critic of the early 20th-century artistic avant-garde.\n*   He famously attacked modern art movements like Cubism and Futurism, which were gaining traction in Europe and Russia at the time.\n*   His most famous critiques were published in the newspaper *Rech'* (Речь), where he reviewed art exhibitions, such as those by the \"Jack of Diamonds\" (Бубновый валет) group, a prominent Russian avant-garde association.\n*   In these critiques, Milyukov referred to the proponents of this new art as **\"leftist artists\"**. This term became a common pejorative for the avant-garde, whom he accused of charlatanism, lacking skill, and representing a \"dead end\" in cultural development.\n*   His description of their work and influence as a \"stagnant swamp\" or a sign of cultural disease fits perfectly with his known public statements.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude and verify.**\n*   The term \"leftist artists\" fits the \"X-Y\" pattern (X=Leftist, Y=Artists).\n*   The target (avant-garde art) aligns with Milyukov's known conservative cultural views.\n*   The harsh metaphor (\"stagnant swamp\") is characteristic of his documented attacks on this specific group.\n*   Therefore, X-Y refers to the modernist avant-garde artists of his time, whom he collectively branded as \"leftist artists\".\n\n<<<leftist artists>>>"
