    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the Japanese character 謄.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Character:** The first step is to correctly identify the components of the kanji 謄. This character has a left-right structure (a structure type known as *hen-tsukuri*).\n    *   **Left Component (hen):** The component on the left side is 言.\n    *   **Right Component (tsukuri):** The component on the right side is a phonetic element composed of 龹 on top and 月 at the bottom.\n\n2.  **Identify the Radical (Bushu):** In kanji with a left-right structure, the left-side component (*hen*) is very often the semantic radical that determines the character's category in a dictionary.\n    *   The radical of 謄 is the left-side component, **言**.\n    *   This radical is associated with concepts like \"speech,\" \"words,\" \"language,\" and \"records.\" This is semantically consistent with the meaning of 謄, which is \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe.\"\n\n3.  **Determine the Japanese Name of the Radical:** Kanji radicals have specific names in Japanese, which can change depending on their position within a character.\n    *   The radical is 言.\n    *   When 言 appears on the left side of a character, it is known by the specific name **ごんべん (gonben)**. The \"gon\" part comes from the *on'yomi* (Sino-Japanese reading) of 言, and \"ben\" is a variation of \"hen,\" the term for a left-side radical.\n\n4.  **Transcribe the Name into Hepburn Romanization:** The final step is to write the Japanese name ごんべん using Hepburn romanization.\n    *   ご -> go\n    *   ん -> n\n    *   べ -> be\n    *   ん -> n\n    *   The resulting transcription is **Gonben**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correctly Identifying Components:** The character 謄 is complex. It is essential not to misidentify the components. For instance, the right side is not the character 朕. The radical is clearly the 言 component on the left.\n*   **Positional Naming of Radicals:** The question's example (媛 -> Onnahen) shows that the specific positional name is required. For the radical 女, its left-side version is called \"onnahen.\" Similarly, for the radical 言, its left-side version is \"gonben,\" which is the expected answer format, rather than just \"gen\" or \"kotoba\" (the readings of the character 言 itself).\n*   **Hepburn Romanization:** Standard Hepburn romanization should be used for the final answer. \"Gonben\" is the correct spelling.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the radical and its correct name.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
