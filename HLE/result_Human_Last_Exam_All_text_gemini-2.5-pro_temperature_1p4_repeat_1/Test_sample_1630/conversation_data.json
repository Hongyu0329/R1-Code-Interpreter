    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of fixed points for $f(g(x))$.\n\n**Step 1: Define the problem mathematically**\n\nWe are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3. Let's denote them as:\n$f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ with $a \\neq 0$.\n$g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$ with $p \\neq 0$.\n\nWe are given the constraints that their derivatives are always positive:\n$f'(x) > 0$ for all real $x$.\n$g'(x) > 0$ for all real $x$.\n\nA fixed point of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a real number $x$ such that $h(x) = x$. Our goal is to find the maximum possible number of such fixed points.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the equation for the fixed points**\n\nThe fixed points are the solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\nWe can define a new function $k(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. The fixed points are the real roots of the equation $k(x) = 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the degree of the polynomial equation**\n\nThe composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also a polynomial. To find its degree, we substitute $g(x)$ into $f(x)$:\n$f(g(x)) = a(g(x))^3 + b(g(x))^2 + c(g(x)) + d$\nThe term with the highest power of $x$ will come from $a(g(x))^3$. The leading term of $g(x)$ is $px^3$.\nSo, the leading term of $f(g(x))$ is $a(px^3)^3 = ap^3x^9$.\nSince $a \\neq 0$ and $p \\neq 0$, the coefficient $ap^3$ is non-zero.\nThus, $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree 9.\n\nThe equation for the fixed points, $f(g(x)) - x = 0$, is a polynomial equation of degree 9. By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, there can be at most 9 fixed points.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the constraints on the derivatives**\n\nThe condition $f'(x) > 0$ means $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function. $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$ is a quadratic. For it to be always positive, its leading coefficient must be positive ($3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$) and its discriminant must be negative ($(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies 4b^2 - 12ac < 0 \\implies b^2 - 3ac < 0$).\nSimilarly, for $g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r > 0$, we must have $p > 0$ and $q^2 - 3pr < 0$.\n\nNow we must check if these constraints reduce the maximum number of roots from 9.\n\n**Step 5: Use Rolle's Theorem and analyze the derivative**\n\nAccording to Rolle's Theorem, between any two roots of a differentiable function $k(x)$, there must be at least one root of its derivative $k'(x)$. This implies that if $k(x)$ has $N$ distinct roots, then $k'(x)$ must have at least $N-1$ distinct roots. Equivalently, the number of roots of $k(x)$ is at most one more than the number of roots of its derivative, $k'(x)$.\n\nLet's find the derivative of $k(x) = f(g(x)) - x$:\n$k'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x))) - 1$\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x))) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\nSo, $k'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n\nThe roots of $k'(x)$ are the solutions to the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$. Let's call the function on the left side $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the degree of $H(x)$**\n\n$f'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2. $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n$f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n$g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\nTherefore, $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\nThe roots of $k'(x)$ are the solutions to $H(x) = 1$, which is an 8th-degree polynomial equation. This equation can have at most 8 real roots.\nSo, $k'(x)$ has at most 8 roots.\n\n**Step 7: Determine the maximum number of local extrema of $k(x)$**\n\nThe roots of $k'(x)$ correspond to the critical points (local maxima and minima) of $k(x)$. Since $k'(x)$ has at most 8 roots, $k(x)$ can have at most 8 local extrema.\n\n**Step 8: Determine the maximum number of roots of $k(x)$**\n\nA polynomial of degree 9 (like $k(x)$) that has 8 local extrema can have at most $8+1 = 9$ real roots. This happens when the values of the function at the local maxima are positive and the values at the local minima are negative, causing the graph to cross the x-axis 9 times.\n\n**Step 9: Verify that 9 fixed points are achievable**\n\nThe analysis so far shows that 9 is the theoretical upper bound. To confirm this is the maximum, we need to be sure that it's possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the conditions and result in 9 fixed points.\n\nThis would require finding $f$ and $g$ (with $f'>0, g'>0$) such that the 8th-degree polynomial $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ intersects the line $y=1$ at 8 distinct points. This in turn requires $H(x)$ to have 7 local extrema (its derivative $H'(x)$, a 7th-degree polynomial, must have 7 distinct real roots), and the values at these extrema must appropriately straddle $y=1$. While constructing an explicit example is complex and requires careful tuning of the polynomials' coefficients, it is theoretically possible. The large number of free parameters in the coefficients of $f$ and $g$ allows for the creation of a function $H(x)$ with the required number of extrema, and for the function $k(x)$ to be shifted vertically to achieve 9 roots.\n\nThere is no theorem stemming from the constraints that would inherently limit the number of roots to be less than the maximum allowed by the degree. For example, the argument that a strictly increasing function $f$ can't have 2-cycles (and thus fixed points of $f(f(x))$ must be fixed points of $f(x)$) does not apply here, as $f$ and $g$ are different functions.\n\nConclusion: The degree of the polynomial equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ is 9. The analysis of its derivative, while accounting for the constraints on $f'$ and $g'$, confirms that it is theoretically possible to have enough local extrema for the function to have 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9."
