    "For a 6-31G basis set calculation, the number of contracted Gaussian functions for each atom is determined as follows:\n\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom:** The 6-31G basis set uses one contracted function for the core 1s orbital. The valence orbitals (2s and 2p) are each split into two contracted functions (a double-zeta valence). This results in one function for the 1s orbital, two for the 2s orbital, and two for each of the three 2p orbitals (px, py, pz). Therefore, each carbon atom has a total of 1 + 2 + (3 * 2) = 9 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** Hydrogen has only a 1s valence orbital. In the 6-31G basis set, this is represented by two contracted functions.\n\nToluene has the chemical formula C7H8, meaning it is composed of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\nTo find the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the entire molecule, we calculate:\n\n(Number of Carbon atoms × Functions per Carbon) + (Number of Hydrogen atoms × Functions per Hydrogen)\n(7 × 9) + (8 × 2) = 63 + 16 = 79\n\nA 6-31G basis set calculation for toluene uses a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n<<<79>>>"
