The "value" of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral that maintains the Pauli exclusion principle is not a single number but is defined by the fundamental integration rules: the integral of a bare Grassmann differential is zero, and the integral of a Grassmann variable with its corresponding differential is one. This, combined with the anti-commuting property of Grassmann variables (ψiψj = -ψjψi), where the square of any Grassmann variable is zero, inherently enforces the Pauli exclusion principle within the path integral formalism.
