The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is not universal and depends on the specific application. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, an optimal range is generally between 5 wt% and 12.5 wt% Nickel, with some studies pointing to an optimum around 7% molar Ni. For water splitting, the ideal ratio is different, with Ni/Ce atomic ratios of 3:1 and 1:1 showing high activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and a ratio of 1:2 being optimal for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).
