    "Without the influence of the Old Norse word `systir`, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely have evolved from the Old English word `sweoster`. Following the established patterns of language change from Old to Modern English, the word would probably be **suster** or perhaps **swester**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the linguistic journey the word would have taken:\n\n*   **Old English:** The original Anglo-Saxon word for a female sibling was `sweoster`, with regional variations such as `swustor` and `swester`. It came from the Proto-Germanic `*swestēr`.\n\n*   **The Fork in the Road - Norse Influence:** When Norsemen began to settle in England, their language heavily influenced English. The Old Norse word for sister, `systir`, began to affect the native English word. The primary influence was the change of the vowel sound from the Old English \"eo\" (or \"u\") to the Norse \"y\" (pronounced /i/), which eventually gave us the modern spelling and pronunciation of \"sister\".\n\n*   **An Alternate Path:** Had the Norse invasion never occurred, `sweoster` would have evolved naturally.\n    *   In the transition to Middle English, the Old English diphthong \"eo\" often became \"e\". This might have resulted in the form `swester`, which is identical to the word in some other Germanic languages like German (`Schwester`).\n    *   Alternatively, and more commonly found in Middle English texts, the initial \"sw\" combination influenced the following vowel, causing it to round and the \"w\" to be dropped, resulting in the Middle English form `suster`. This is similar to how the Old English `sweord` became `sword`, where the \"w\" is no longer pronounced.\n\n*   **From Middle English to Modern English:** Starting from the documented Middle English form `suster`, the short \"u\" sound (pronounced like the \"u\" in \"put\") would have most likely undergone the same change as other words with that vowel, such as `sunne` becoming \"sun\". This would result in the modern \"uh\" sound (/ʌ/). The unstressed ending `-er` would have remained, similar to `brother` and `mother`.\n\nTherefore, the most probable Modern English word for a female sibling, without Norse influence, would be spelled **Suster** and pronounced to rhyme with \"duster\".\n\n<<<Suster>>>"
