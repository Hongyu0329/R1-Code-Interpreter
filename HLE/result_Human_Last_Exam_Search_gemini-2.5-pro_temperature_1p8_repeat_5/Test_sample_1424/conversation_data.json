    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, also known as the free Green's function, describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues is fundamental to understanding the behavior of quantum many-body systems before interactions are taken into account.\n\nThe bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, for a given momentum **k** and frequency ω (or energy) has a distinct relationship with the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ**ₖ**. The specific form of this dependence reveals where the single-particle excitations of the non-interacting system lie.\n\nIn frequency-momentum space, the bare Green's function G₀(**k**, ω) is given by:\n\n***G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iδ sign(ϵₖ - µ))***\n\nHere:\n*   **G₀(k, ω)** is the bare Green's function.\n*   **ω** represents the frequency (energy) of the particle.\n*   **ϵₖ** is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a given momentum **k**.\n*   **µ** is the chemical potential, which sets the reference energy level.\n*   **δ** is an infinitesimal positive quantity that ensures proper causality, determining whether the pole is slightly above or below the real axis. The term `sign(ϵₖ - µ)` indicates that for particles (ϵ**ₖ** > µ), the pole is in the lower half of the complex frequency plane, and for holes (ϵ**ₖ** < µ), it is in the upper half.\n\nThe most critical aspect of this relationship is that the bare Green's function has poles when the frequency ω is equal to the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ**ₖ**. These poles correspond to the energies of the non-interacting particles and are a defining feature of the system's single-particle excitation spectrum. In essence, the functional dependence is an inverse relationship with respect to the difference between the frequency variable and the single-particle energy."
