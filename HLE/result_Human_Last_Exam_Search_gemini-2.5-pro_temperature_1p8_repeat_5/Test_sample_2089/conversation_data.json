    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character's seemingly innocuous action seals his fate is likely a misremembered scene from Quentin Tarantino's 2009 film, *Inglourious Basterds*. While the movie does not feature a character saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus, it contains a famous and pivotal scene where a character's gesture gives him away, leading to his demise.\n\nIn a tense tavern scene, a British officer, Lieutenant Archie Hicox, who is undercover as a German officer, orders three drinks. He does so by holding up his index, middle, and ring fingers, which is the common gesture in Britain and the United States. However, a nearby Gestapo Major notices this, as the German custom is to count to three using the thumb, index, and middle fingers. This subtle mistake confirms the Major's suspicions about the group's true identities, resulting in a violent shootout where Hicox is killed.\n\n*Inglourious Basterds* was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The scene is widely discussed among film enthusiasts for its suspense and the minute detail that leads to a catastrophic outcome for the characters. It is highly probable that this is the film being referenced, with the specific details of the gesture and location being misremembered as saying \"thank you\" on a bus.\n\n<<<Inglourious Basterds>>>"
