    "The rule activation level, also known as the firing strength of a fuzzy rule, is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the membership degrees of the antecedents of the rule. A t-norm is a function that models the logical \"AND\" operation in fuzzy logic. The choice of the specific t-norm function affects the resulting activation level.\n\nGiven the values `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`, which represent the membership degrees of the rule's antecedents, the rule activation level is calculated by applying a t-norm to these two values. While the context is an interval type-3 fuzzy set, the fundamental calculation of the firing strength for a single rule still relies on this t-norm operation.\n\nHere are the results for the most common t-norms:\n\n*   **Minimum t-norm:** This is the most frequently used t-norm. It takes the minimum of the membership values.\n    *   `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n*   **Product t-norm:** This t-norm calculates the product of the membership values.\n    *   `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\n*   **Łukasiewicz t-norm:** This t-norm is defined as `max(0, a + b - 1)`.\n    *   `max(0, 0.7 + 0.9 - 1) = max(0, 0.6) = 0.6`\n\nThe rule activation level will be a single value between 0 and 1, which then influences the output of the fuzzy rule. Without a specified t-norm, a definitive single answer isn't possible. However, the most common practice is to use the minimum t-norm.\n\n<<<The rule activation level depends on the specific t-norm used. Using the minimum t-norm, the result is 0.7. Using the product t-norm, the result is 0.63.>>>"
