    "This is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. To determine the values of `λ` for which this equation has no solution, we can convert it into a system of linear equations.\n\nThe given integral equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ ((xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)) u(y) dy`, for `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`.\n\nFirst, we simplify the kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`. Using the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series, we can write:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + xⁿ⁻³y² + ... + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k`.\n\nThe kernel is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of products of functions of `x` and functions of `y`. Let `g_k(x) = x^(n-1-k)` and `h_k(y) = y^k`. The equation becomes:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) g_k(x) ∫₀¹ h_k(y) u(y) dy`\n\nLet us define a set of constants `c_k` as:\n`c_k = ∫₀¹ h_k(y) u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`, for `k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nSubstituting these constants back into the equation for `u(x)`, we see that `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k x^(n-1-k)`.\n\nTo find the values of the constants `c_j`, we substitute this expression for `u(x)` into their definition:\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j (1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k y^(n-1-k)) dy`\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k ∫₀¹ y^(j+n-1-k) dy`\n`c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k / (j+n-k)`.\n\nThis gives a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknowns `c_0, c_1, ..., c_(n-1)`. We can write this in matrix form as `(I - λA)c = b`, where:\n*   `c` is the column vector of the unknown coefficients, `c = [c_0, c_1, ..., c_(n-1)]ᵀ`.\n*   `b` is a constant column vector, `b = [1, 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/n]ᵀ`.\n*   `A` is an `n x n` matrix with elements `A_jk = 1 / (j+n-k)` (where `j` is the row index and `k` is the column index, both from 0 to `n-1`).\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this system of equations has:\n1.  A unique solution for `c` if the determinant `det(I - λA)` is non-zero.\n2.  No solution or infinitely many solutions if `det(I - λA) = 0`.\n\nThe condition `det(I - λA) = 0` is equivalent to `1/λ` being an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. If `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of `A`, the equation has no solution if the vector `b` is not in the column space of `(I - λA)`. Since the kernel is symmetric (`K(x,y) = K(y,x)`), the operator is self-adjoint, and this condition simplifies: no solution exists if the forcing function `f(x) = 1` is not orthogonal to the eigenfunction corresponding to `λ`. This is equivalent to checking if the first coefficient of the corresponding eigenvector, `c_0 = ∫₀¹ u(y) dy`, is non-zero. For this specific problem, it turns out that this condition is always met.\n\nTherefore, the equation has no solution for values of `λ` that are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `A`.\n\n### Case n=1\nThe kernel is `K(x,y) = 1`. The equation becomes `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y)dy`.\nThe matrix `A` is `1x1` with `A_00 = 1/(0+1-0) = 1`.\nThe only eigenvalue is `μ=1`. Thus, `λ = 1/μ = 1`.\nFor `λ=1`, we get `c_0(1-1) = 1`, which is `0=1`, indicating no solution.\n\n### Case n=2\nThe kernel is `K(x,y) = x+y`. The matrix `A` is `2x2`:\n`A_00 = 1/(0+2-0) = 1/2`\n`A_01 = 1/(0+2-1) = 1`\n`A_10 = 1/(1+2-0) = 1/3`\n`A_11 = 1/(1+2-1) = 1/2`\nSo, `A = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]`.\nThe eigenvalues `μ` of `A` are the roots of `det(A-μI)=0`:\n`(1/2 - μ)² - 1/3 = 0`\n`1/2 - μ = ±1/√3`\n`μ = 1/2 ± 1/√3`.\nThe values of `λ` for which no solution exists are the reciprocals of these eigenvalues:\n`λ = 1 / (1/2 ± 1/√3) = 1 / ((√3 ± 2) / 2√3) = 2√3 / (√3 ± 2)`.\nRationalizing the denominator gives:\n`λ₁ = 2√3(√3 - 2) / ((√3 + 2)(√3 - 2)) = (6 - 4√3) / (3 - 4) = -6 + 4√3`.\n`λ₂ = 2√3(√3 + 2) / ((√3 - 2)(√3 + 2)) = (6 + 4√3) / (3 - 4) = -6 - 4√3`.\n\nFor a general integer `n`, the values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `A` with entries `A_jk = 1 / (j+n-k)`.\n\n<<<The values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `A` whose elements are given by `A_jk = 1 / (j+n-k)` for `j,k` in `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`.>>>"
