    "In the context of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat of a system with spatial dimension d=3 can be determined using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion. This expansion is a perturbative approach performed in terms of the small parameter ϵ = d_c - d, where d_c is the upper critical dimension of the theory.\n\nFor a broad class of systems described by the O(N)-symmetric φ⁴ field theory, the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4. The epsilon expansion provides expressions for the critical exponents as a series in ϵ. To first order in ϵ, the exponent α for the specific heat is given by:\n\nα = (4 - N) / (2(N + 8)) * ϵ + O(ϵ²)\n\nHere, N represents the number of components of the order parameter. The specific question does not define N, so we will consider the most common cases:\n\n*   **Ising Model (N=1):** This model describes systems with a scalar order parameter, such as a simple ferromagnet or a liquid-gas transition.\n*   **XY Model (N=2):** This model is used for systems with a two-component order parameter, like superfluid helium.\n*   **Heisenberg Model (N=3):** This applies to isotropic ferromagnets where the magnetization has three components.\n\nFor a system with a spatial dimension d=3, the expansion parameter is ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n*   **For the Ising model (N=1):**\n    α = (4 - 1) / (2(1 + 8)) * 1 = 3 / 18 = 1/6 ≈ 0.167\n\nThis value represents the first-order approximation in the ϵ expansion. Higher-order corrections can be calculated to obtain more precise theoretical values which are in good agreement with results from other methods like numerical simulations. The first-order result, however, correctly predicts a divergent specific heat (α > 0), a significant improvement over the mean-field theory prediction of α=0.\n\n<<<\nIn the epsilon expansion for a system with spatial dimension d=3 (which means ϵ = 1), the scaling exponent α for the specific heat, assuming an N-component order parameter, is given to the first order by the formula α = (4-N)ϵ / (2(N+8)). For the common case of the Ising model (N=1), this yields α = (4-1)*1 / (2*(1+8)) = 3/18 = 1/6.\n>>>"
