    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol results in an E2 elimination reaction. The major product of this reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reaction:\n*   **Reactant and Reagent**: The starting material is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, which is a trans-substituted cyclohexane. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu), a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Reaction Type**: The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong base leads to an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction. This reaction is stereospecific and requires the hydrogen being removed and the leaving group (bromine) to be in an anti-periplanar arrangement. In cyclohexane chairs, this corresponds to a trans-diaxial orientation.\n*   **Chair Conformation**: For the E2 reaction to occur, the bromine atom must be in an axial position. In the chair conformation of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane where bromine is axial, there are two adjacent (beta) hydrogens that are also in an axial position and anti-periplanar to the bromine: one at carbon 2 and one at carbon 6.\n*   **Regioselectivity (Zaitsev vs. Hofmann Rule)**:\n    *   Removal of the hydrogen from carbon 2 would lead to the more substituted alkene, **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is known as the Zaitsev product.\n    *   Removal of a hydrogen from carbon 6 would lead to the less substituted alkene, **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is known as the Hofmann product.\n*   **Role of the Bulky Base**: Potassium tert-butoxide is a bulky base. Due to its large size, it preferentially abstracts the more sterically accessible proton. The proton at carbon 6 is less sterically hindered than the proton at carbon 2, which is adjacent to the methyl group. Therefore, the bulky base will preferentially remove the proton from carbon 6, leading to the formation of the Hofmann product.\n\nThus, the major product of the reaction is the less substituted and kinetically favored alkene, 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
