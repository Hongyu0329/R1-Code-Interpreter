    "Based on a standard 100 big blind cash game opening range from the button, the weakest suited jacks you should open are J5s and J6s. One source suggests an opening range that includes suited jacks down to J5s, making it the worst suited jack to open. Another source indicates a slightly wider range where J6s is the weakest suited jack to be opened. In a rake-free environment, the incentive to steal the blinds is slightly diminished, and the value of playing in position post-flop is emphasized.\n\n<<<J5s>>>"
