The upper bound for the maximum norm, interpreted as the sup-norm $\|f\|_\infty$ of a Hecke-Maass cusp form with square-free level $N$, is proportional to $N^{1/3+\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon > 0$. Since the covolume $V$ of the corresponding modular curve is proportional to $N$, the relationship can be expressed as $k_{k,\infty} \ll V^{1/3+\epsilon}$.
