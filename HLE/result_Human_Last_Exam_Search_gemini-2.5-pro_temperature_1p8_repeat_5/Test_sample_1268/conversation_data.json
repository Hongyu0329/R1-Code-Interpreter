    "An upper bound for the maximum norm in the context of Hecke-Maass cusp forms of square-free level is a well-studied topic in number theory. Based on the provided terms, the most likely interpretation is within the framework of automorphic forms. Here, we identify:\n\n*   **A square-free natural number ($N$)**: as the level of a Hecke-Maass cusp form.\n*   **The maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$)**: as the sup-norm, denoted by $\\|f\\|_\\infty$, which measures the maximum value of the form.\n*   **The covolume ($V$)**: as the volume of the associated modular curve, which is proportional to the level $N$.\n\nFor an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform $f$ of square-free level $N$ and a fixed Laplace eigenvalue $\\lambda$, a significant result provides an upper bound on its sup-norm. It has been shown that:\n\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} N^{1/3+\\epsilon}$\n\nThis bound demonstrates that the maximum value of the form grows sub-linearly with the level $N$. For the case of a square-free integer, this bound was established by Nicolas Templier, building upon earlier work.\n\nThe covolume $V$ of the modular curve $Y_0(N) = \\Gamma_0(N)\\setminus\\mathbb{H}$ is directly related to the level $N$. For large $N$, the volume is asymptotically proportional to $N$. Therefore, we can express the upper bound for the maximum norm in terms of the covolume $V$ as:\n\n$k_{k,\\infty} \\ll_{\\epsilon} V^{1/3+\\epsilon}$\n\nThis indicates that the maximum norm is bounded by the covolume to the power of one-third (plus an arbitrarily small epsilon).\n\n<<<The upper bound for the maximum norm, interpreted as the sup-norm $\\|f\\|_\\infty$ of a Hecke-Maass cusp form with square-free level $N$, is proportional to $N^{1/3+\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$. Since the covolume $V$ of the corresponding modular curve is proportional to $N$, the relationship can be expressed as $k_{k,\\infty} \\ll V^{1/3+\\epsilon}$.>>>"
