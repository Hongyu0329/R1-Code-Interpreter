    "A key result in homotopy theory, established by G. W. Whitehead, states that for path-connected CW-complexes X and Y, there exists a natural map:\n$$f: \\Sigma(\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y) \\to \\Omega(X \\wedge Y)$$\nThe connectivity of this map is given by the sum of the connectivities of the spaces X and Y.\n\nTo determine the connectivity of the specific map in the question, we first need to determine the connectivity of the spaces $S^4$ and $S^6$.\n\nA pointed space $Z$ is said to be $k$-connected if its homotopy groups $\\pi_i(Z)$ are trivial for all $i \\leq k$.\n\n*   The homotopy groups of the sphere $S^n$ are $\\pi_i(S^n) = 0$ for $i < n$. Thus, $S^4$ is 3-connected and $S^6$ is 5-connected.\n\nAccording to the theorem by Whitehead, the connectivity of the map is the sum of these connectivities.\n\nConnectivity = conn($S^4$) + conn($S^6$) = 3 + 5 = 8.\n\nLet's verify this by checking the connectivity of the domain and target spaces:\n\n*   **Domain:** The space $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$-connected. Therefore, $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected and $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected. For the smash product of two connected CW-complexes, the connectivity is at least the sum of their connectivities plus one. Thus, $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is at least $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected. The suspension of a $k$-connected space is $(k+1)$-connected, so the domain $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is at least 8-connected.\n\n*   **Target:** The smash product $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{10}$. The target space is therefore homotopy equivalent to $\\Omega S^{10}$. The loop space $\\Omega S^{10}$ is $(10-2) = 8$-connected.\n\nA map is $k$-connected if it induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ for $i<k$ and a surjection for $\\pi_k$. Since both the domain and target spaces are 8-connected (their homotopy groups are trivial for dimensions less than or equal to 8), the map is at least 8-connected. The first non-trivial homotopy groups appear in dimension 9 for both spaces. A more detailed analysis of the map's behavior on $\\pi_9$ would be required to determine if the connectivity is higher, but the established theorem gives the connectivity as 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
