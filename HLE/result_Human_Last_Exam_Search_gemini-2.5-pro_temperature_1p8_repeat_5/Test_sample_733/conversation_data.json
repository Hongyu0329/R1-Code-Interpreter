    "The number of finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2 has been determined through a classification provided by the work of Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart. A product-free set S in a group G is a subset where for any two elements a and b in S (not necessarily distinct), their product ab is not in S. Such a set is called maximal by inclusion (or locally maximal) if it is not properly contained in any other product-free set within the same group.\n\nThe classification of these groups is primarily detailed in the paper \"Small maximal sum-free sets,\" where \"sum-free\" is used synonymously with \"product-free\". This classification work is also referenced in several other research papers.\n\nThe complete list of finite groups containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 is as follows:\n*   Six cyclic groups: C₃, C₄, C₅, C₆, C₇, and C₈.\n*   The Klein four-group: C₂ × C₂.\n*   The symmetric group on three elements: S₃ (isomorphic to the dihedral group D₆).\n*   The dihedral group of order 8: D₈.\n*   The quaternion group of order 8: Q₈.\n*   The elementary abelian group of order 8: C₂ × C₂ × C₂.\n*   The dicyclic group of order 12: Q₁₂ (also known as the generalized quaternion group).\n*   A specific non-abelian group of order 16 with the presentation ⟨x, y | x⁴ = 1, y⁴ = 1, xy = yx⁻¹⟩.\n\nCounting these distinct groups, we find there are a total of 13 such groups.\n\n<<<13>>>"
