    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in Homer's *Iliad* is Mount Ida on the island of Crete.\n\nSeveral mountains feature in the epic poem, serving as vantage points for the gods or as significant geographical landmarks. While Mount Olympus is the most famous and the highest peak in Greece at 2,917 meters (9,570 feet), other mountains also play a role in the narrative.\n\nThe second highest among these historical mountains is Mount Ida on Crete, also known as Psiloritis, which stands at an elevation of 2,456 meters (8,058 feet). In mythology, this Mount Ida is renowned as the birthplace and hiding place of Zeus.\n\nAnother mountain mentioned is Mount Ida in Turkey (formerly Anatolia), from which the gods are said to have witnessed the Trojan War. This peak, also known as Kaz Dağı, has an elevation of 1,774 meters (5,820 feet).\n\nOther mountains with connections to the Trojan War and Greek mythology include:\n*   **Mount Athos**, located on the Chalkidiki peninsula and mentioned in the *Iliad*, has a height of 2,033 meters (6,670 feet).\n*   **Mount Samothrace**, also called Fengari or Saos, is where Poseidon is said to have watched the Trojan War. Its peak reaches 1,611 meters (5,285 feet).\n*   **Mount Pelion** in Thessaly, known as the home of the Centaurs, has a highest summit of 1,624 meters (5,328 ft).\n\nTherefore, with an elevation of 2,456 meters, Crete's Mount Ida is the tallest of these historical mountains mentioned in the context of the *Iliad* and its surrounding mythology, second only to Mount Olympus.\n\n<<<Mount Ida (Crete)>>>"
