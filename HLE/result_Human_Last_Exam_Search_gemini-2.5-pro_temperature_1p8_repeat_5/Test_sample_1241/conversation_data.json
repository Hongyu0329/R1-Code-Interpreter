    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to determine the limiting (or stationary) probabilities of the system. For a continuous-time Markov chain, as described by the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations, the limiting probabilities $P_i = \\lim_{t \\to +\\infty} P_i(t)$ can be found by setting the derivatives $P_i'(t)$ to zero. This converts the system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\nThe given system of equations is:\n$P_{0}'(t) = -0.019 P_{0}(t) + 0.65 P_{1}(t)$\n$P_{1}'(t) = 0.019 P_{0}(t) - (0.65 + 0.4)P_{1}(t) + 0.392 P_{2}(t) + 0.008 P_{3}(t)$\n$P_{2}'(t) = 0.4 P_{1}(t) - (0.392  + 0.008)P_{2}(t)$\n$P_{3}'(t) = 0.008 P_{2}(t) - 0.008 P_{3}(t)$\nWith the additional condition that the probabilities must sum to one:\n$P_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1$\n\nIn the stationary state, as $t \\to +\\infty$, we have $P_i'(t) = 0$. The system becomes:\n1. $0 = -0.019 P_{0} + 0.65 P_{1}$\n2. $0 = 0.019 P_{0} - 1.05 P_{1} + 0.392 P_{2} + 0.008 P_{3}$\n3. $0 = 0.4 P_{1} - 0.4 P_{2}$\n4. $0 = 0.008 P_{2} - 0.008 P_{3}$\n5. $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n\nFrom equation (4), we can deduce that $P_2 = P_3$.\nFrom equation (3), we get $0.4 P_1 = 0.4 P_2$, which simplifies to $P_1 = P_2$.\nTherefore, we have the relationship $P_1 = P_2 = P_3$.\n\nNow, using equation (1), we can express $P_0$ in terms of $P_1$:\n$0.019 P_0 = 0.65 P_1 \\implies P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1$\n\nWe can now substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}) P_1 + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3) P_1 = 1$\n\nTo solve for $P_1$, we first calculate the fraction:\n$\\frac{0.65}{0.019} = \\frac{650}{19}$\n\nNow substitute this back into the equation for $P_1$:\n$(\\frac{650}{19} + 3) P_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650 + 3 \\times 19}{19}) P_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}) P_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19} P_1 = 1 \\implies P_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\nNow we can find $P_0$:\n$P_0 = \\frac{650}{19} P_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}$\n\nThe desired value is the sum of $P_0$ and $P_1$:\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768$\n\n"
