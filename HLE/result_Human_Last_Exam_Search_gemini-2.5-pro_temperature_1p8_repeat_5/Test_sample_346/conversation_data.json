    "To find the value of `log_2(n)`, we first need to determine the integer `n` represented by the given SKI combinator expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nLet's break down and simplify the components of this expression.\n\n**1. Identifying the Combinators**\n\n*   **S, K, I:** These are the basic combinators:\n    *   `S x y z = x z (y z)`\n    *   `K x y = x`\n    *   `I x = x`\n\n*   **`A = S(S(K(S))(K))`**: Let's reduce this combinator.\n    `A x y z = (S(S(K S) K) x) y z`\n    `= (K S x (K x)) y z`\n    `= (S (K x)) y z`\n    `= (K x z) (y z)`\n    `= x (y z)`\n    This is the function composition combinator, commonly known as `B`. So, `A = B`. The `B` combinator is also used for the multiplication of Church numerals, `mul m n = B m n`.\n\n*   **`S(I)`**: Let's analyze the function `S(I)`. There are two common interpretations for `S` applied to one argument.\n    The most standard interpretation that yields a result consistent with Church numerals is `(S I) n f x = I f (n f) x = f (n f x)`. This is the successor function, `SUCC`, which adds one to a Church numeral (`SUCC n = n + 1`).\n    Let's verify this. `SUCC n = λf.λx. f((n f) x)`. The combinator for this is `S I`.\n    So, `S(I)` can be interpreted as `S I = SUCC`.\n\n*   **`C = S(I)(I)`**: Applying the successor function to the identity combinator `I`. The combinator `I` is the Church numeral for 1 (`I f x = f x`).\n    Therefore, `C = SUCC(I) = SUCC(1) = 2`.\n\n**2. Parsing the Main Expression**\n\nThe expression has a structure that suggests `S` is applied to three arguments. The most plausible parsing, given the use of combinators for arithmetic, is that the outermost `S` is applied to `I` and two subsequent large expressions.\n\nLet's rewrite `E` with our simplified terms:\n`E = S(I) (b) (c)`\nwhere:\n*   `b = S(I)(S(I)(K(A(I))))`\n*   `c = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)) = A(C) = B(2)`\n\nNow, let's evaluate `b` and `c`:\n\n*   **Argument `c`**:\n    `c = B(2)`. As we established `B` is the multiplication combinator, `B(2)` is a function that multiplies a Church numeral by 2. We can call it `mul2`.\n\n*   **Argument `b`**:\n    `b = S(I)(S(I)(K(A(I))))`\n    `A(I) = B(I) = B(1)`. The application `B(1)` corresponds to multiplication by 1, which is the identity function on numerals. So, `B(1) = I`.\n    The term `K(A(I))` becomes `K(I)`. The combinator `K` applied to a numeral `m` produces that numeral, so `K(I)` is equivalent to the numeral 1.\n    So, `b` simplifies to `SUCC(SUCC(K(I))) = SUCC(SUCC(1))`.\n    `SUCC(1) = 2`.\n    `SUCC(2) = 3`.\n    So, `b = 3`.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Final Expression**\n\nNow we substitute the evaluated `b` and `c` back into the expression for `E`:\n`E = S(I) (3) (B(2))`\n\nThis can be parsed as `(S(I)(3))(B(2))`.\n`S(I)(3) = SUCC(3) = 4`.\nSo, `E` becomes `4 (B(2))`.\n\nThis means the Church numeral `4` is applied to the function `mul2 = B(2)`. The application of a Church numeral `m` to a function `g` results in the m-fold composition of `g`, i.e., `g^m`.\n`E = (B(2))^4 = λx. B(2)(B(2)(B(2)(B(2)x)))`\nThis is a function that takes a Church numeral `x` and multiplies it by 2, four times.\n`λx. 2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * x))) = λx. 16x`.\nLet's call this function `mul16`.\n\nThe problem states that the expression *is* a Church integer `n`. We have derived a function on Church integers, `mul16`. In the context of foundations of mathematics using combinatory logic, a function `F` that operates on numerals can be identified with the numeral `F(1)`. Applying this principle:\n`n = E(1) = mul16(1) = 16 * 1 = 16`.\n\nSo, the Church integer `n` is 16.\n\n**4. Calculating `log_2(n)`**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the logarithm base 2 of `n`.\n`log_2(n) = log_2(16) = 4`.\n\nFinal Answer is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
