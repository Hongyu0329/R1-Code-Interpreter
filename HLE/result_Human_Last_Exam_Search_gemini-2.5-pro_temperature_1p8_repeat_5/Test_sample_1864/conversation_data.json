    "For a flow cytometry sorting experiment with five detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750) and utilizing streptavidin beads, a series of essential controls must be prepared to ensure data accuracy and proper cell sorting. These controls are crucial for setting up the instrument, compensating for spectral overlap, and accurately identifying the target cell population. The necessary controls can be broken down into several categories, resulting in a substantial number of control tubes.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls you should prepare:\n\n### 1. Basic Setup Controls:\n*   **Unstained Control (1 sample):** This consists of the cells of interest without any fluorescent labels. This control is fundamental for assessing the natural autofluorescence of your cells and for setting the initial forward and side scatter voltages on the flow cytometer.\n\n### 2. Viability Control:\n*   **Viability Dye Control (1 sample):** It is critical to include a viability dye in your panel to exclude dead cells from your analysis and sorting. Dead cells tend to bind non-specifically to antibodies and can have high autofluorescence, which can lead to false positive results. You will need a sample of your cells stained only with the viability dye to set the gate for live cells.\n\n### 3. Compensation Controls:\nTo correct for the spectral overlap between the five different fluorochromes, single-color compensation controls are required for each fluorochrome in your panel. These can be prepared using either cells or compensation beads.\n*   **AF350 Compensation Control (1 sample)**\n*   **GFP Compensation Control (1 sample)**\n*   **PE Compensation Control (1 sample)**\n*   **AF647 Compensation Control (1 sample)**\n*   **AF750 Compensation Control (1 sample)**\n\nTherefore, you will need a total of **5 single-stained samples** for compensation. It is crucial that the positive signal in your compensation control is at least as bright as the signal in your experimental samples.\n\n### 4. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:\nFMO controls are essential for accurately setting gates in a multicolor experiment, as they reveal the spread of fluorescence from all other channels into the channel of interest. An FMO control is a sample stained with all the fluorochromes in your panel except for one. While you can run an FMO for every channel, they are most critical for identifying positive versus negative populations, especially for markers that are dim or have a continuous expression pattern. For a five-color panel, you would ideally prepare:\n*   **FMO for AF350 (1 sample):** Stained with GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750.\n*   **FMO for GFP (1 sample):** Stained with AF350, PE, AF647, and AF750.\n*   **FMO for PE (1 sample):** Stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, and AF750.\n*   **FMO for AF647 (1 sample):** Stained with AF350, GFP, PE, and AF750.\n*   **FMO for AF750 (1 sample):** Stained with AF350, GFP, PE, and AF647.\n\nThis accounts for another **5 control samples**.\n\n### 5. Streptavidin and Isotype Controls:\nThe use of streptavidin adds another layer of necessary controls to ensure the specificity of the staining. Assuming one of your five fluorochromes is conjugated to streptavidin to detect a biotinylated primary antibody (for instance, let's assume the PE is a PE-Streptavidin conjugate):\n*   **Streptavidin-fluorochrome alone (1 sample):** This control contains cells stained only with the streptavidin-PE conjugate (without the biotinylated primary antibody). This is to check for any non-specific binding of the streptavidin conjugate itself.\n*   **Isotype Control (1 sample, optional but recommended):** If you are using a biotinylated primary antibody, you should use a biotinylated isotype control antibody of the same species and subclass. This sample would then be stained with the streptavidin-PE conjugate. This control helps to determine the level of non-specific binding from the primary antibody. The use of isotype controls can be controversial, but they are often requested by reviewers.\n\n### 6. Biological Controls:\n*   **Positive and Negative Controls (at least 2 samples, if applicable):** These are experimental controls. A positive control would be a sample known to express the markers of interest, while a negative control would be a sample known to lack expression. For example, if you are stimulating cells, an unstimulated control serves as a biological negative control.\n\n### Summary of Essential Controls:\n\nTo be thorough, for a five-channel sorting experiment using a streptavidin-fluorochrome conjugate, you should prepare the following control tubes in addition to your fully stained experimental sample:\n\n*   Unstained cells: **1**\n*   Viability dye only: **1**\n*   Single-stain compensation controls: **5**\n*   Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls: **5**\n*   Streptavidin-fluorochrome only control: **1**\n*   Isotype control: **1**\n*   Biological controls (optional but highly recommended): **2** (one positive, one negative)\n\nThis brings the total number of essential controls to prepare to **at least 14**. Depending on whether biological controls are relevant and if you decide to use an isotype control, this number can vary slightly. However, for a rigorous and well-controlled experiment, preparing these controls is highly recommended.\n\n<<<14>>>"
