    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is in one-to-one correspondence with the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes in its Weyl group $W$.\n\nFor a split reductive group, such as the group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the Weyl group. In this situation, the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes are the same as the ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group.\n\nThe problem is therefore reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$. The structure of the conjugacy classes of Weyl groups was famously described by Roger Carter. For the specific case of $W(E_8)$, the number of conjugacy classes is 112.\n\nThus, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
