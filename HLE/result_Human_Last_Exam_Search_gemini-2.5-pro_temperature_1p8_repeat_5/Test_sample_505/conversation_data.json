    "In two separate patches of surface code, each with two holes, a maximum of 4 logical qubits can be encoded.\n\nHere's the breakdown of how this is determined:\n*   **Single Patch with Holes:** In the standard surface code, each hole introduced into the code patch can be used to encode one logical qubit. Therefore, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode two logical qubits. The holes, which are essentially boundaries within the surface, are fundamental to this process.\n*   **Independent Patches:** When you have multiple, separate patches of surface code, each one acts as an independent quantum memory. The total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits encoded in each individual patch.\n*   **Calculation:** Since each of the two patches has two holes, each patch encodes two logical qubits. The total is the sum from both patches: 2 (from the first patch) + 2 (from the second patch) = 4 logical qubits.\n\nThese patches of logical qubits can then be used for computation, with operations sometimes performed by merging and splitting the patches in a process called lattice surgery.\n\n<<<4>>>"
