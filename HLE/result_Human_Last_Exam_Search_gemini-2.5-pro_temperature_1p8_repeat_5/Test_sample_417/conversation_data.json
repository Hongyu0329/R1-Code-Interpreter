    "To determine the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, a careful analysis of the molecule's structure and symmetry is required. The number of signals in a 1H NMR spectrum corresponds to the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule.\n\nThe structure can be broken down into two main parts: the central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core and the three identical substituents attached at the 1, 3, and 5 positions.\n\n1.  **Symmetry of the Molecule**: The central core is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene. This arrangement possesses a C3 rotational axis of symmetry. This symmetry makes the three large substituents chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the unique proton signals from one of these substituents and the signals from the central benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Protons on the Central Benzene Ring**:\n    *   The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. These nine protons will give rise to a single signal.\n    *   There are no protons directly attached to the aromatic ring as all positions are substituted.\n    *   **Peak Count for Central Core: 1**\n\n3.  **Protons of One Substituent Arm**: The substituent is ((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl. Each substituent is chiral, which has significant consequences for the signals of nearby protons.\n    *   **Bridging Methylene (`-CH2-`) Group**: This group connects the achiral benzene core to the chiral indazole moiety. Protons of a CH2 group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic, meaning they are in chemically non-equivalent environments. Thus, these two protons will produce two distinct signals.\n    *   **Camphor-Derived Indazole Moiety**: This part of the molecule is rigid and chiral.\n        *   **Indazole Ring Proton (`H-3`)**: There is one proton on the pyrazole ring at position C3. It is in a unique chemical environment.\n        *   **Camphor Skeleton Protons**:\n            *   **Methyl Groups**: The original camphor skeleton has three methyl groups. The two geminal methyl groups on the C8 bridge are diastereotopic due to the chirality of the molecule and will show two separate signals. The third methyl group, attached to the C7 bridgehead, is also unique. This gives a total of three signals for the three methyl groups of the camphor part.\n            *   **Bridgehead Proton (`H-4`)**: The single proton at the C4 bridgehead is in a unique environment.\n            *   **Methylene Protons (`H-5` and `H-6`)**: The camphor skeleton contains a six-membered ring with two methylene groups. Due to the rigid, bicyclic, and chiral nature of the framework, all four protons (two on C5 and two on C6) are chemically non-equivalent. The two protons on C5 are diastereotopic to each other, and the two protons on C6 are also diastereotopic. Furthermore, the C5 protons are in a different environment from the C6 protons. Therefore, these four protons will give rise to four separate signals.\n\n**Summary of Expected Peaks:**\n\n*   **Central Ring Methyls:** 1 signal\n*   **Bridging Methylene Protons (`-CH2-`)**: 2 signals (diastereotopic)\n*   **Indazole Ring Proton (`H-3`)**: 1 signal\n*   **Camphor Bridgehead Proton (`H-4`)**: 1 signal\n*   **Camphor Methylene Protons (`-CH2CH2-`)**: 4 signals (all non-equivalent)\n*   **Camphor C7-Methyl Proton**: 1 signal\n*   **Camphor C8-Methyl Protons**: 2 signals (diastereotopic)\n\n**Total Number of Signals**: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 = **12**\n\nTherefore, a total of 12 peaks are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<H>>>"
