    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a key component of the posterior subesophageal mass (PSEM), a major division of the cuttlefish brain responsible for controlling various motor functions. This region of the brain is a complex arrangement of several distinct lobes that work in concert.\n\nAnatomical studies of the cuttlefish brain, including the dwarf cuttlefish, have identified a \"palliovisceral lobe complex.\" This complex is comprised of the palliovisceral lobe itself, along with the lateral ventral palliovisceral lobes, the dorsal and ventral vasomotor lobes, and notably, the posterior chromatophore lobes. The close association of these lobes within the same complex points to their adjacent positioning.\n\nFurthermore, research on the closely related *Sepia officinalis* has detailed the structure of the posterior subesophageal mass, identifying the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes as being situated in this posterior region of the brain, alongside the palliovisceral lobe. Studies involving retrograde labeling of nerve fibers have confirmed that motoneurons for the fins are primarily located in the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes within the PSEM, further solidifying the close anatomical and functional relationship between these structures. Therefore, based on the available neuroanatomical data, the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes are positioned adjacently and posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish.\n\n<<<The brain regions adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"
