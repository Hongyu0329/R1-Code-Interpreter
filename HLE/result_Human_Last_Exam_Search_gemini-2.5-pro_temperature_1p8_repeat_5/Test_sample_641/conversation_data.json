    "I am unable to determine the number of involutions in PSU(4,997).\n\nMy research has indicated the following:\n*   The number of involutions in a finite group is the sum of the sizes of its conjugacy classes of involutions.\n*   The size of a conjugacy class of an element `t` in a group `G` is given by the formula `|G| / |C(t)|`, where `|G|` is the order of the group and `|C(t)|` is the order of the centralizer of `t`.\n*   The order of PSU(4,997) can be calculated using the formula for the order of PSU(n,q):\n    |PSU(n,q)| = (1/gcd(n, q+1)) * q^(n(n-1)/2) * Π_{i=2 to n} (q^i - (-1)^i).\n    For PSU(4,997), n=4 and q=997. `gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\n    Therefore, `|PSU(4,997)| = (1/2) * 997^6 * (997^2 - 1) * (997^3 + 1) * (997^4 - 1)`.\n*   The number of conjugacy classes of involutions in PSU(4,q) for an odd prime `q` depends on the value of `q` modulo 8. Specifically, for q=997, which is congruent to 5 modulo 8, the available search results do not explicitly state the number of these classes.\n*   Detailed information regarding the number of conjugacy classes of involutions and the structure of their centralizers for PSU(4,q) when `q ≡ 5 (mod 8)` is likely contained within specialized academic literature on finite groups of Lie type, which I am unable to access and analyze in the required depth.\n\nWithout knowing the number of conjugacy classes of involutions and the orders of their corresponding centralizers, I cannot compute the total number of involutions in PSU(4,997).\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a numerical answer to the question with the available information.>>>"
