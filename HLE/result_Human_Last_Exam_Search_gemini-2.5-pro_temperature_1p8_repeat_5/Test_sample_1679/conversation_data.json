    "An American in Paris*, the 1951 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, is the first film to hold that honor and feature a depiction of the Luxor Obelisk. The film includes an extended ballet sequence set in a stylized version of Paris, with one of the backdrops clearly representing the Place de la Concorde, where the obelisk is located.\n\nThe climactic ballet scene in *An American in Paris* was filmed on meticulously crafted sets at MGM studios. These sets were inspired by the works of French painters, and the segment representing the Place de la Concorde was designed in the style of artist Raoul Dufy. In this sequence, the iconic fountains of the Place de la Concorde are prominently featured as a setting for a romantic dance between Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron's characters. A model of the Place de la Concorde fountain was created for the production to plan the intricate choreography and camera work for this scene.\n\nWhile earlier Best Picture winners were set in or had scenes in Paris, there is no evidence that they depicted the Luxor Obelisk. Later Best Picture winners, such as *Gigi* (1958) and *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956), also featured Parisian locations. Notably, a fountain in the Place de la Concorde is also seen in *Gigi*. However, *An American in Paris* predates these films, securing its position as the first Best Picture victor to showcase the famous Egyptian monument. The film's ambitious and now-famous ballet sequence recreated a Parisian vista that includes one of its most recognizable landmarks, the Luxor Obelisk.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
