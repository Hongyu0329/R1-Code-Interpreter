    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in four primary colors: white, red, violet, and black.\n\nThe most common and reactive allotrope is white phosphorus, which is a translucent waxy solid. It can appear yellowish due to impurities or upon exposure to light and heat, which causes it to gradually convert to red phosphorus; this form is often referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n\nRed phosphorus is another common allotrope, which is more stable than the white form. It can be created by heating white phosphorus. While generally described as red, it can have an iron-grey lustre.\n\nViolet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, is a crystalline form that can be produced by annealing red phosphorus at high temperatures.\n\nBlack phosphorus is the most stable and least reactive allotrope. It has a graphite-like appearance, being black and flaky, and is a conductor of electricity. There are two forms of black phosphorus, α-black and β-black.\n\nIn addition to these solid allotropes, gaseous diphosphorus exists at high temperatures. There is also mention of blue phosphorus, which is a more recent discovery.\n\nTherefore, counting the distinct, commonly recognized colors of pure phosphorus allotropes, we have white, red, violet, and black.\n\n<<<4>>>"
