    "The SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` represents a molecule known as triethynyl-expanded triangulene. This molecule is a derivative of triangulene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon composed of fused benzene rings in a triangular arrangement.\n\nThe core of the molecule, triangulene, has a planar, threefold symmetric structure. The addition of three ethynyl (`-C≡CH`) groups at the corners of the triangulene core maintains this high degree of symmetry.\n\nThe symmetry of a molecule is described by its point group. For triethynyl-expanded triangulene, the key symmetry elements are:\n\n*   A principal three-fold rotational axis (C₃) perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n*   Three two-fold rotational axes (C₂) in the molecular plane, each passing through one of the ethynyl groups and the center of the molecule.\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n*   Three vertical mirror planes (σᵥ), each containing the C₃ axis and one of the C₂ axes.\n*   Two three-fold improper rotation axes (S₃).\n\nThe combination of a C₃ axis, three perpendicular C₂ axes, and a horizontal mirror plane places the molecule in the **D₃ₕ** point group. Molecules with D₃ₕ symmetry are non-polar and achiral. Examples of other molecules belonging to the D₃ₕ point group include boron trifluoride (BF₃), cyclopropane, and triphenylene.\n\n<<<D₃ₕ>>>"
