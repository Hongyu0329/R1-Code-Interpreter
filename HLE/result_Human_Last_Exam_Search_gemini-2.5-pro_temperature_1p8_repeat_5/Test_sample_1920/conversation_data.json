    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Factor the conductor $d$\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\nThrough trial division, we find:\n$53599 = 7 \\times 7657$\n$7657 = 13 \\times 589$\n$589 = 19 \\times 31$\nThus, the prime factorization of $d$ is $d = 7 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 31$.\nSince $d$ is a product of distinct primes (i.e., it is square-free), a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a non-principal character modulo the corresponding prime factor $p_i$.\n\n### 2. Conditions on the component characters\nLet $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where $\\chi_1$ is a character modulo 7, $\\chi_2$ modulo 13, $\\chi_3$ modulo 19, and $\\chi_4$ modulo 31.\nFor $\\chi$ to be a primitive character with conductor $d$, each component character $\\chi_i$ must be a primitive character with conductor $p_i$. For a prime modulus, this is equivalent to $\\chi_i$ being a non-principal character, which means its order must be greater than 1.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters. We are given that the order of $\\chi$ is 6.\nLet $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$. Then we must have $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$.\n\nThis condition implies that each $o_i$ must be a divisor of 6. Since each $\\chi_i$ must be non-principal, $o_i > 1$. Therefore, the possible orders for each $\\chi_i$ are $o_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n### 3. Counting the number of suitable component characters\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ in this group is $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n\nLet's check the condition for each prime factor:\n*   For $p_1 = 7$, the group of characters has order $\\phi(7) = 6$. The required orders {2, 3, 6} all divide 6.\n*   For $p_2 = 13$, the group of characters has order $\\phi(13) = 12$. The required orders {2, 3, 6} all divide 12.\n*   For $p_3 = 19$, the group of characters has order $\\phi(18) = 18$. The required orders {2, 3, 6} all divide 18.\n*   For $p_4 = 31$, the group of characters has order $\\phi(30) = 30$. The required orders {2, 3, 6} all divide 30.\n\nFor each of the four prime factors, we count the number of non-principal characters whose order divides 6:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\nSo, for each prime factor, there are $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$ possible characters whose order is in the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n### 4. Combining the component characters\nWe need to find the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ such that their orders $o_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ satisfy $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$.\n\nWe can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\nLet $S$ be the set of all possible tuples where each $\\chi_i$ has an order that divides 6 (and is greater than 1). The total number of such tuples is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nThe condition $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$ is satisfied if and only if the set of orders $\\{o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4\\}$ contains at least one multiple of 2 and at least one multiple of 3.\n\nWe subtract the cases where this condition fails:\n1.  **The lcm has no factor of 2**: This means all orders $o_i$ must be odd. From the possible orders $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$, this means $o_i=3$ for all $i$. For each prime, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3. So there are $2^4 = 16$ such combinations.\n2.  **The lcm has no factor of 3**: This means all orders $o_i$ are not divisible by 3. From the possible orders $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$, this means $o_i=2$ for all $i$. For each prime, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2. So there is $1^4 = 1$ such combination.\n\nThe intersection of these two cases would require all orders to be neither a multiple of 2 nor a multiple of 3, which is impossible as the orders must be in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6 is the total number of tuples in $S$ minus those where the lcm condition is not met:\nNumber of characters = (Total combinations) - (combinations with lcm not divisible by 2) - (combinations with lcm not divisible by 3)\nNumber of characters = $625 - 16 - 1 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
