    "The reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide in refluxing THF, followed by an aqueous work-up, results in the substitution of all three halogen atoms with phenyl groups.\n\nThe reactivity of halogens in this type of nucleophilic substitution reaction with a Grignard reagent follows the order I > Br > Cl > F. This means the iodine atom is the most reactive, and the bromine atoms are less reactive.\n\nThe reaction proceeds in the following steps:\n1.  The iodine atom at the C-2 position is the most reactive and is replaced first by a phenyl group from the phenyl magnesium bromide.\n2.  Since phenyl magnesium bromide is used in excess and the reaction is heated (refluxed), the less reactive C-Br bonds at positions 1 and 3 also react.\n3.  The bromine atoms at C-1 and C-3 are subsequently replaced by phenyl groups.\n\nThis sequence of substitutions on the benzene ring results in a final product where three phenyl groups are attached to the central benzene ring at positions 1, 2, and 3. The aqueous work-up step is performed to quench any remaining excess Grignard reagent.\n\nThe IUPAC name for this final product, a benzene ring substituted with phenyl groups at the 1, 2, and 3 positions, is **1,2,3-triphenylbenzene**.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
