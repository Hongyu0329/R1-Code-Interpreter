    "The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q128, has a total of 7 power subgroups.\n\nA power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup of the form G<sup>k</sup> = {g<sup>k</sup> | g ∈ G} for some integer k. To determine the number of distinct power subgroups of Q128, we first need to understand its structure.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group Q128 can be defined by the presentation:\nQ128 = ⟨a, x | a<sup>64</sup> = 1, x<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>32</sup>, xax<sup>-1</sup> = a<sup>-1</sup>⟩\n\nThe elements of Q128 consist of those in the cyclic subgroup ⟨a⟩ of order 64, and elements of the form a<sup>i</sup>x. The elements not in ⟨a⟩, i.e., of the form a<sup>i</sup>x, all have an order of 4.\n\nWe can find the distinct power subgroups by examining G<sup>k</sup> for various integers k:\n\n*   **k = 1:** G<sup>1</sup> is the group G itself. So, Q128<sup>1</sup> = Q128 is the first power subgroup. For any odd integer k, the mapping g → g<sup>k</sup> is a permutation of the elements of a finite group, so the set of k-th powers is the entire group. Thus, Q128<sup>k</sup> = Q128 for all odd k.\n\n*   **k = 2:** We consider the squares of all elements.\n    *   For elements g = a<sup>i</sup> in the cyclic subgroup ⟨a⟩, g<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2i</sup>. These elements generate the cyclic subgroup ⟨a<sup>2</sup>⟩ of order 32.\n    *   For elements g = a<sup>i</sup>x, g<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>32</sup>.\n    Since a<sup>32</sup> is already an element of ⟨a<sup>2</sup>⟩, the subgroup generated by all squares is Q128<sup>2</sup> = ⟨a<sup>2</sup>⟩. This is the second power subgroup.\n\n*   **k = 4:** We consider the fourth powers of all elements.\n    *   For elements g = a<sup>i</sup>, g<sup>4</sup> = a<sup>4i</sup>. These generate the subgroup ⟨a<sup>4</sup>⟩ of order 16.\n    *   For elements g = a<sup>i</sup>x (which have order 4), g<sup>4</sup> = 1.\n    Therefore, Q128<sup>4</sup> = ⟨a<sup>4</sup>⟩. This is the third power subgroup.\n\n*   **k = 8:** Following the same logic, the eighth powers of elements are either in ⟨a<sup>8</sup>⟩ or are the identity. Thus, Q128<sup>8</sup> = ⟨a<sup>8</sup>⟩, a cyclic group of order 8. This is the fourth power subgroup.\n\n*   **k = 16:** Q128<sup>16</sup> = ⟨a<sup>16</sup>⟩, a cyclic group of order 4. This is the fifth power subgroup.\n\n*   **k = 32:** Q128<sup>32</sup> = ⟨a<sup>32</sup>⟩, a cyclic group of order 2. This is the sixth power subgroup.\n\n*   **k = 64:** Every element raised to the power of 64 is the identity element.\n    *   For g = a<sup>i</sup>, g<sup>64</sup> = (a<sup>64</sup>)<sup>i</sup> = 1<sup>i</sup> = 1.\n    *   For g = a<sup>i</sup>x, g<sup>64</sup> = (g<sup>4</sup>)<sup>16</sup> = 1<sup>16</sup> = 1.\n    Thus, Q128<sup>64</sup> is the trivial subgroup {1}. This is the seventh power subgroup.\n\nAny higher power of 2 for k will also result in the trivial subgroup. Any even k that is not a power of 2 can be written as k = 2<sup>m</sup> * (odd number), and Q128<sup>k</sup> will be equal to Q128<sup>2<sup>m</sup></sup>. Therefore, the distinct power subgroups are:\n\n1.  Q128 (order 128)\n2.  ⟨a<sup>2</sup>⟩ (order 32)\n3.  ⟨a<sup>4</sup>⟩ (order 16)\n4.  ⟨a<sup>8</sup>⟩ (order 8)\n5.  ⟨a<sup>16</sup>⟩ (order 4)\n6.  ⟨a<sup>32</sup>⟩ (order 2)\n7.  {1} (order 1)\n\nThere are 7 distinct power subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
