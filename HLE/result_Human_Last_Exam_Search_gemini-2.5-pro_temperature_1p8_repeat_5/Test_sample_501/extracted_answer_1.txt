The force law between the polymer ends when the polymer is thermally isolated is given by $f(x) = \frac{2 E(0) x}{n^2 \ell^2} \exp\left(\frac{x^2}{n^2 \ell^2}\right)$, where $E(0)$ is the kinetic energy of the polymer at zero extension, $n$ is the number of mass points, $\ell$ is the length of each strut, and $x$ is the separation of the ends. For small separations, this approximates to a linear force law $f(x) \approx \frac{2 E(0)}{n^2 \ell^2} x$.
