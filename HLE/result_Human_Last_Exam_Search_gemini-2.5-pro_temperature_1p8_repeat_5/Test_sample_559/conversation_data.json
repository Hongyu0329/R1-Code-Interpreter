    "To find the separatrix of the system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and their stability.\n\nThe given system is:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n2.  $u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nWe are considering the phase plane for $u \\ge 0$.\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points are found by setting $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\nFrom $u' = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$, we get:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + 0 - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    So, one equilibrium point is $(0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$, we get:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0$\n    $d' = 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1)=0$.\n    This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, two other equilibrium points are $(0, 1)$ and $(-1, 1)$.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the upper half-plane are $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(-1, 1)$.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis of Equilibrium Points**\n\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(d, u)$ for the system:\n$f(d, u) = 2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^4+u^3$\n$g(d, u) = u^3-u^2$\n\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d + 5u^2-3u & (10u-3)d - 4u^3+3u^2 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2-2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **At (0, 1):**\n    $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0) + 5-3 & 0 - 4+3 \\\\ 0 & 3-2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Both are positive, so $(0, 1)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n\n*   **At (-1, 1):**\n    $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) + 5-3 & (10-3)(-1) - 4+3 \\\\ 0 & 3-2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -7 - 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -8 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since they are real and have opposite signs, $(-1, 1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The linearization is inconclusive; this is a degenerate equilibrium point.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nSeparatrices are trajectories that separate regions of different dynamical behavior. They are typically the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points. We have a saddle point at $(-1, 1)$. Its stable and unstable manifolds are the separatrices of this system.\n\nLet's test if there is a simple curve of the form $d = ku^n$ that represents a trajectory. We can find the equation of trajectories by considering $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'}$.\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^3+u^4}{u^3-u^2}$\n\nLet's test the particular solution $d(t) = -u(t)^2$.\nFirst, we find the derivative of this proposed solution with respect to $t$:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}(-u^2) = -2u \\cdot u' = -2u(u^3-u^2) = 2u^3 - 2u^4$.\n\nNext, we substitute $d = -u^2$ into the first differential equation:\n$d' = 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n$d' = 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 - u^3 + u^4$\n$d' = (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nThe results match. Thus, the curve defined by the equation **$d = -u^2$** is an exact trajectory of the system.\n\nLet's verify if this curve passes through any of the equilibrium points:\n*   For the point $(-1, 1)$: $d = -1$ and $u=1$. $(-1) = -(1)^2$, which is true. The curve passes through the saddle point.\n*   For the point $(0, 0)$: $d = 0$ and $u=0$. $(0) = -(0)^2$, which is true. The curve passes through the degenerate equilibrium point.\n\nA trajectory that connects two equilibrium points is a separatrix. Specifically, this separatrix is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(-1,1)$. Its tangent at $(-1,1)$ can be calculated from its slope $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$, which at $u=1$ is $-2$. This corresponds to a direction vector $(1, -2)$, which aligns with the unstable eigenvector of the Jacobian matrix at the saddle point.\n\nThe curve $d = -u^2$ separates the phase plane into regions with different long-term behaviors and is therefore the separatrix of the system. Another separatrix is the line $u=1$, which contains the stable manifold of the saddle point. However, the curve $d = -u^2$ represents a specific heteroclinic connection between two equilibria and is a canonical example of a separatrix.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
