    "Recent works by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis, later simplified by Gander and Wanner, have provided exact expressions for the A($\\alpha$)-stability angles of the BDF methods.\n\nFor the BDF4 scheme, the angle $\\alpha$ of A($\\alpha$)-stability is given by the expression:\n\n$\\alpha = \\arctan \\left( \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2033}}{89} \\right)$\n\nThis value is approximately 73.35 degrees. The discovery of these exact values represented a significant advancement from previously known numerical approximations.\n\nThe stability angle is a crucial property for numerical methods, especially when solving stiff differential equations, as it defines the sector in the complex plane for which the method is stable. For BDF methods of order `k` from 3 to 6, they are not A-stable (which would require a stability angle of 90Â°) but are A($\\alpha$)-stable.\n\n<<<$\\alpha = \\arctan \\left( \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2033}}{89} \\right)$>>>"
