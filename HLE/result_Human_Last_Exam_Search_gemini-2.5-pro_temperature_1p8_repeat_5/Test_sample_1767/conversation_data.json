    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the resulting junction is 2.\n\nThe Chern number is a topological invariant that characterizes the quantization of the Hall conductance. In a composite system formed by bringing together multiple topological phases, the total Chern number is the sum of the individual Chern numbers, provided the coupling between them is significant enough to form a single, coherent system. The \"negligible tunneling barrier\" ensures this condition is met.\n\nThis principle is supported by research on stacked and laterally stitched Chern insulators, where combining multiple Chern insulator layers leads to a higher overall Chern number for the combined system. For instance, stacking two Chern insulators can result in a composite system with a Chern number of C=2. The additive nature of the Berry flux, which determines the Chern number, is the fundamental reason for this behavior.\n\n<<<2>>>"
