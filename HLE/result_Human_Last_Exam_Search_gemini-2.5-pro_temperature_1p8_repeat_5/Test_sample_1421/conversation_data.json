    "### The Formula for the Fermionic Partition Function in Imaginary Time Path Integral Formalism\n\nThe partition function, denoted by Z, for a system of fermions in the imaginary time representation, as described by Feynman's path integral formalism, is a fundamental concept in quantum statistical mechanics. It is expressed as a functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields.\n\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function is given by:\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\">\n  $Z = \\int_{A.P.} \\mathcal{D}\\psi^*(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\mathcal{D}\\psi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\exp(-S_E[\\psi^*, \\psi])$\n</div>\n<br>\nWhere:\n\n*   **Z** is the partition function.\n*   **$ \\psi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) $ and $ \\psi^*(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) $** are Grassmann-valued fermionic fields. These are anti-commuting numbers, which is a mathematical necessity to correctly represent the nature of fermions and the Pauli exclusion principle in the path integral framework. The fields are functions of imaginary time $ \\tau $ and spatial coordinates $ \\mathbf{x} $.\n*   **$ \\int_{A.P.} \\mathcal{D}\\psi^* \\mathcal{D}\\psi $** represents the functional integral, or path integral, over all possible configurations of the fermionic fields. The subscript \"A.P.\" signifies that the integral is taken with anti-periodic boundary conditions imposed on the fields in the imaginary time direction.\n*   **$ S_E[\\psi^*, \\psi] $** is the Euclidean action of the system, which is a functional of the Grassmann fields. It is obtained by taking the classical action and performing a Wick rotation to imaginary time ($ t \\rightarrow -i\\tau $).\n\nThe Euclidean action is defined as:\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\">\n$ S_E[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\mathcal{L}_E(\\psi^*(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}), \\psi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})) $\n</div>\n<br>\nHere:\n\n*   **$ \\beta $** is the inverse temperature, defined as $ \\beta = 1/(k_B T) $, where $ T $ is the temperature and $ k_B $ is the Boltzmann constant (often set to 1 in theoretical physics). The integration in imaginary time $ \\tau $ is performed over the interval from 0 to $ \\beta $.\n*   **$ \\mathcal{L}_E $** is the Euclidean Lagrangian density, expressed in terms of the fermionic fields. For example, for non-relativistic fermions, this often takes the form $ \\psi^*(\\partial_\\tau - \\frac{\\nabla^2}{2m} - \\mu)\\psi $, where $ \\mu $ is the chemical potential.\n\nA crucial aspect of this formalism is the implementation of **anti-periodic boundary conditions** for the fermionic fields in the imaginary time direction:\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\">\n  $ \\psi(\\tau + \\beta, \\mathbf{x}) = -\\psi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) $\n</div>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\">\n  $ \\psi^*(\\tau + \\beta, \\mathbf{x}) = -\\psi^*(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) $\n</div>\n<br>\nThese boundary conditions arise from the trace in the definition of the partition function ($ Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta H}) $) when evaluated in a basis of fermionic states. This is a direct consequence of the anti-commutation relations that fermionic operators obey and distinguishes them from bosons, which require periodic boundary conditions. This requirement ensures that the path integral correctly calculates the statistical mechanical partition function."
