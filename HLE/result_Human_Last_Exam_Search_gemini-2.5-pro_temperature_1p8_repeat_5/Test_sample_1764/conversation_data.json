    "It is possible for the number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a given Banach space $B$ to be zero.\n\nHere is a constructive proof:\n1.  **Define a finite ultrametric space, $X$**:\n    Let $X$ be a set of three points, $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$. Let the distance function $d$ be defined as:\n    *   $d(x_i, x_j) = 1$ if $i \\neq j$\n    *   $d(x_i, x_i) = 0$\n    This is an equilateral metric space. Any equilateral space is also an ultrametric space. To verify the ultrametric (or strong triangle) inequality, $d(x_i, x_k) \\le \\max\\{d(x_i, x_j), d(x_j, x_k)\\}$ for any distinct $i, j, k$, we have $1 \\le \\max\\{1, 1\\}$, which is true.\n\n2.  **Define a Banach space, $B$**:\n    Let $B$ be the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard norm, $||a|| = |a|$. This is a one-dimensional Banach space. The cardinality of $\\mathbb{R}$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $c$.\n\n3.  **Attempt to find an isometric embedding**:\n    An isometric embedding is a function $f: X \\to B$ such that for any two points $x_i, x_j \\in X$, the distance in $B$ between their images is equal to their original distance. The distance in $B$ is given by $||f(x_i) - f(x_j)||$.\n    Let $p_1 = f(x_1)$, $p_2 = f(x_2)$, and $p_3 = f(x_3)$ be the images of the points of $X$ in $\\mathbb{R}$. For $f$ to be an isometric embedding, the following conditions must be met:\n    *   $||p_1 - p_2|| = |p_1 - p_2| = d(x_1, x_2) = 1$\n    *   $||p_2 - p_3|| = |p_2 - p_3| = d(x_2, x_3) = 1$\n    *   $||p_1 - p_3|| = |p_1 - p_3| = d(x_1, x_3) = 1$\n\n    Let's arrange the three points $p_1, p_2, p_3$ on the real number line. Without loss of generality, let's assume $p_1 < p_2 < p_3$.\n    *   From $|p_1 - p_2| = 1$, we get $p_2 - p_1 = 1$.\n    *   From $|p_2 - p_3| = 1$, we get $p_3 - p_2 = 1$.\n    Now consider the distance between $p_1$ and $p_3$:\n    $|p_1 - p_3| = p_3 - p_1 = (p_3 - p_2) + (p_2 - p_1) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    However, for an isometric embedding, we require $|p_1 - p_3|$ to be 1. This leads to the contradiction $2 = 1$. The result is the same regardless of the ordering of $p_1, p_2, p_3$. Therefore, no such set of three points exists in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**:\n    There are no isometric embeddings of the 3-point equilateral ultrametric space $X$ into the Banach space $\\mathbb{R}$. The number of such embeddings is 0. Since the number of embeddings must be a non-negative integer, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\n"
