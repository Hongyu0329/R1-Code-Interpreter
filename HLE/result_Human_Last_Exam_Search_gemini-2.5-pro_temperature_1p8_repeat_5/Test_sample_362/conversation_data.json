    "The product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane is primarily **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how the product is formed:\n*   **Reactants**: The reaction involves an aldehyde (pivalaldehyde, (CH₃)₃CCHO) and a phosphorus ylide ((2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenylphosphorane, Ph₃P=CHCH₂(C₆H₄Cl)). The Wittig reaction is a method used to convert aldehydes and ketones into alkenes.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism**: In the Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the aldehyde and the triphenylphosphine group of the ylide are replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond. The driving force behind this reaction is the formation of the highly stable triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O).\n*   **Structure of the Product**: The tert-butyl group from pivalaldehyde and the 2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethyl group from the ylide become substituents on the newly formed carbon-carbon double bond. This results in the alkene `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)`. The IUPAC name for this structure is 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The stereochemistry of the resulting alkene is determined by the nature of the ylide. The ylide used in this reaction, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenylphosphorane, is considered an unstabilized ylide because the carbon atom of the ylide is attached to an alkyl-like group. Wittig reactions involving unstabilized ylides predominantly yield the (Z)-isomer (where the main substituents are on the same side of the double bond). This selectivity occurs because the reaction is under kinetic control, favoring the formation of the Z-alkene.\n\nTherefore, the major product is (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene, along with triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct.\n\n<<<**(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**"
