In the context of Interval Type-3 Membership Functions (IT3 MFs), the mathematical formulation for a vertical cross-section at a fixed primary input x' is an Interval Type-2 Membership Function (IT2 MF). Utilizing Gaussian-based paradigms, this is characterized by an Upper Membership Function (UMF) and a Lower Membership Function (LMF) that bound the uncertainty for a secondary input variable *u*.

The vertical cross-section is represented as an interval:
**µ<sub>Ã(x')</sub>(u) = [µ<sub>L</sub>(u|x'), µ<sub>U</sub>(u|x')]**

The Gaussian-based formulations for the UMF and LMF are:

**Upper Membership Function (UMF):**
**µ<sub>U</sub>(u | x') = exp [ -½ ( ( u - c<sub>U</sub>(x') ) / σ<sub>U</sub> )² ]**

**Lower Membership Function (LMF):**
**µ<sub>L</sub>(u | x') = *S* ⋅ exp [ -½ ( ( u - c<sub>L</sub>(x') ) / σ<sub>L</sub> )² ]**

Where:
*   **µ<sub>Ã(x')</sub>(u)** is the interval membership grade for the secondary variable *u* at the fixed primary input *x'*.
*   **u** is the secondary input variable, with u ∈ J<sub>x'</sub> ⊆.
*   **c<sub>U</sub>(x')** and **c<sub>L</sub>(x')** are the means (centers) of the Gaussian functions for the UMF and LMF, respectively, which can be dependent on the primary input *x'*.
*   **σ<sub>U</sub>** and **σ<sub>L</sub>** are the standard deviations (spreads) of the UMF and LMF Gaussian functions.
*   ***S*** is a scaling factor for the LMF, where 0 ≤ *S* ≤ 1, which adjusts the height of the lower bound relative to the upper bound.
