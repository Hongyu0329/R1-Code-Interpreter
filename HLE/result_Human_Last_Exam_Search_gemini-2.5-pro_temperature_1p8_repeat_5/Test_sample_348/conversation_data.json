    "To find the total welfare, we first need to determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand functions are equal.\n\nThe given functions are:\n*   **Supply:** P = ln(Q_s³ - 2)\n*   **Demand:** P = 18e^(-arctan(Q_d))\n\n**1. Finding Market Equilibrium:**\n\nAt equilibrium, the quantity supplied (Q_s) equals the quantity demanded (Q_d), which we can call the equilibrium quantity (Q_E). Similarly, the prices are equal, which we call the equilibrium price (P_E). We can find Q_E by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nln(Q_E³ - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q_E))\n\nSolving this equation for Q_E requires numerical methods. Using a computational tool, we find that the equilibrium quantity is approximately:\n\nQ_E ≈ 4.682\n\nWe can then find the equilibrium price, P_E, by substituting Q_E into either the supply or the demand function. Using the demand function:\n\nP_E = 18e^(-arctan(4.682)) ≈ 4.625\n\n**2. Calculating Total Welfare:**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. It represents the total benefit to both consumers and producers in the market. It can be calculated by integrating the difference between the demand and supply curves from the minimum quantity to the equilibrium quantity.\n\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS):** This is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price. It is calculated as:\n    CS = ∫[from 0 to Q_E] (P_d(Q) - P_E) dQ\n\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS):** This is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price. It is calculated as:\n    PS = ∫[from Q_min to Q_E] (P_E - P_s(Q)) dQ\n\nThe supply function P = ln(Q³ - 2) is only defined when Q³ - 2 > 0, which means Q > ∛2 ≈ 1.26. Therefore, the producer surplus is integrated from ∛2 to Q_E.\n\nThe total welfare (TW) is the sum of CS and PS, which simplifies to:\n\nTW = ∫[from 0 to Q_E] P_d(Q) dQ - ∫[from ∛2 to Q_E] P_s(Q) dQ\n\nWe will calculate these two integrals separately:\n\n*   **Integral of the demand function:** ∫[from 0 to 4.682] 18e^(-arctan(Q)) dQ\n*   **Integral of the supply function:** ∫[from 1.26 to 4.682] ln(Q³ - 2) dQ\n\nUsing numerical integration tools, we find the values of these integrals to be approximately:\n\n*   Integral of demand ≈ 48.06\n*   Integral of supply ≈ 11.41\n\nThe total welfare is the difference between these two values:\n\nTotal Welfare ≈ 48.06 - 11.41 = 36.65\n\n<<<36.65>>>"
