    "It is not possible to provide a definitive number of \"pas de Balanchine\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo for several reasons.\n\nFirst, the \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally defined or universally recognized step in ballet vocabulary. It is a descriptive term for movements that evoke the characteristic style of choreographer George Balanchine, which could be interpreted differently by various observers.\n\nSecond, a choreographic analysis that counts specific stylistic movements within a particular performance from 2015 is not available. While reviews and roster information from that period confirm that Svetlana Gileva was a Principal dancer with the Semperoper Ballett and performed in William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated,\" these documents do not offer a move-by-move breakdown of the solo. A YouTube video of the \"Jete Woman solo\" from a 2015 Semperoper Ballett performance exists, but it is currently unavailable for viewing.\n\nWithout access to the performance footage and a standardized definition of the step, any count would be subjective.\n\n<<<It is not possible to provide a specific number based on available information.>>>"
