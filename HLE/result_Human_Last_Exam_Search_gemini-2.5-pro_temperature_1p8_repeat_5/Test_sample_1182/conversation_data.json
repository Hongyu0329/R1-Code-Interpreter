    "To determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers, we need to analyze its structure and reduction type at the prime 2.\n\nThe curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. The stable reduction of a curve is a \"nicest\" possible model in a family of curves, where the only allowed singularities are ordinary double points (nodes). The number of these double points is a key invariant of the reduction.\n\nThe procedure to determine the stable reduction involves analyzing the 2-adic valuations of the roots of the polynomial defining the curve. Let $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThe curve is given by $y^2=f(x)$. First, we find the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f(x)=0$.\nThe polynomial can be factored as $f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8)$. One root is clearly $x_0 = 0$.\n\nLet $g(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$. We analyze the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $g(x)$ using its Newton polygon. The vertices of the Newton polygon are $(i, v_2(a_i))$, where $a_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$. For $g(x)$, the coefficients are $(a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4) = (8, 1, 4, 4, 8)$. The points for the polygon are:\n*   $(0, v_2(8)) = (0, 3)$\n*   $(1, v_2(1)) = (1, 0)$\n*   $(2, v_2(4)) = (2, 2)$\n*   $(3, v_2(4)) = (3, 2)$\n*   $(4, v_2(8)) = (4, 3)$\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points consists of two segments:\n1.  A segment from $(0, 3)$ to $(1, 0)$, which has a slope of -3. This corresponds to one root, let's call it $\\alpha$, with a 2-adic valuation of $v_2(\\alpha) = -(-3) = 3$.\n2.  A segment from $(1, 0)$ to $(4, 3)$, which has a slope of 1. This corresponds to three roots, let's call them $\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3$, each with a 2-adic valuation of $v_2(\\beta_i) = -(1) = -1$.\n\nSo, the five roots of $f(x)$ have the following 2-adic valuations: one root is 0, one root $\\alpha$ has valuation 3, and three roots $\\beta_i$ have valuation -1.\n\nA hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 defined by an equation of degree 5 has a total of six branch points for the cover $C \\to \\mathbb{P}^1$. These are the five roots of $f(x)$ and the point at infinity. Let the set of branch points be $B = \\{0, \\alpha, \\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3, \\infty\\}$.\n\nThe structure of the stable reduction is determined by the way these branch points cluster at different 2-adic scales. The \"distance\" between two roots $r_1, r_2$ is measured by $v_2(r_1-r_2)$.\n*   The distance between 0 and $\\alpha$ is $v_2(\\alpha - 0) = v_2(\\alpha) = 3$.\n*   The distance between any other pair of finite roots is $\\min(v_2(r_i), v_2(r_j))$. For example, $v_2(\\alpha - \\beta_i) = \\min(3, -1) = -1$, and $v_2(0 - \\beta_i) = -1$.\n*   It can also be shown that $v_2(\\beta_i - \\beta_j) = -1$ for $i \\neq j$.\n\nThe set of branch points shows a distinct partition based on these valuations. The pair $\\{0, \\alpha\\}$ is much \"closer\" (valuation of difference is high) than any other pair. This suggests they form a cluster. We can partition the six branch points into two sets:\n*   $P_2 = \\{0, \\alpha\\}$\n*   $P_4 = \\{\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3, \\infty\\}$\n\nAccording to the theory of stable reduction of hyperelliptic curves (developed by mathematicians like Liu and Saito), this type of partition of branch points into a set of two and a set of four corresponds to a specific kind of stable fiber. The stable model consists of:\n*   An elliptic curve (a curve of genus 1), whose branch points are the four points in $P_4$.\n*   A rational curve, $\\mathbb{P}^1$ (a curve of genus 0), which arises from the \"pinching\" corresponding to the two points in $P_2$.\n\nFor the resulting stable curve to have an arithmetic genus of 2 (to match the genus of the original curve), these two components must intersect in two points. Each intersection point is a double point (a node).\nThe arithmetic genus $p_a$ of a curve with two components, an elliptic one ($C_1$) and a rational one ($C_2$), intersecting at $\\delta$ points, is given by the formula $p_a = g(C_1) + g(C_2) + \\delta - N_{comp} + 1$, where $N_{comp}$ is the number of components.\nPlugging in the values, we need $2 = 1 + 0 + \\delta - 2 + 1$, which simplifies to $2 = \\delta$.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction consists of an elliptic curve and a rational curve intersecting at two points. These two intersection points are the double points of the stable reduction.\n\n<<<2>>>"
