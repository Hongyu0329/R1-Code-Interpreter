    "The Crawley-Nordström invariant is a sophisticated mathematical concept arising in the study of 7-dimensional manifolds with G₂ holonomy, which are significant in M-theory, a successor to string theory. For a Calabi-Yau link, which is a 7-manifold created by the intersection of a Calabi-Yau threefold with a 9-sphere, this invariant helps to distinguish between different G₂ structures.\n\nThe Calabi-Yau threefold in question is defined by the polynomial equation $0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$ in a weighted complex space where the coordinates $(z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)$ have weights $(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n\nA check of the weighted degree of each monomial term in the polynomial reveals a small inconsistency. The term $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ has a total weight of $4(22) + 3(29) + 49 = 224$, while all other terms have a weight of 225. For the geometry to be well-defined, the polynomial must be homogeneous. Assuming this is a typographical error and the intended degree is 225, we can proceed. The sum of the weights $22+29+49+50+75$ is also 225, satisfying the Calabi-Yau condition for this space.\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant, denoted $\\nu$, takes values in the integers modulo 48 ($\\mathbb{Z}_{48}$). An important finding in the field is that for Calabi-Yau links of this type (quasi-regular Sasakian manifolds), the invariant depends only on the weights of the ambient space and the degree of the polynomial, not on the specific coefficients or monomial terms of the polynomial itself.\n\nFor a quasi-regular Calabi-Yau link defined by a weighted homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{P}(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$, the Crawley-Nordström invariant can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$\\nu \\equiv d \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{5} w_i \\pmod{48}$\n\nGiven the data:\n*   Degree of the polynomial, $d = 225$\n*   Weights: $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$\n\nThe sum of the weights is $\\sum w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n\nNow, we can compute the invariant:\n$\\nu \\equiv 225 \\cdot 225 \\pmod{48}$\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we find the remainders of 225 when divided by 48:\n$225 = 4 \\times 48 + 33$. So, $225 \\equiv 33 \\pmod{48}$.\n\nThen,\n$\\nu \\equiv 33 \\cdot 33 \\pmod{48}$\n$\\nu \\equiv 1089 \\pmod{48}$\n\nFinally, we find the remainder of 1089 when divided by 48:\n$1089 = 22 \\times 48 + 33$.\n\nTherefore, the Crawley-Nordström invariant is $33 \\pmod{48}$.\n\n<<<33>>>"
