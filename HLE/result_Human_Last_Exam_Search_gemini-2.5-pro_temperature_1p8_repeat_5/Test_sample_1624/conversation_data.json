    "An upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$ exists, and it is the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step argument to arrive at this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Understanding the space U**: The set $U$ is an open subset of $X$. The condition that each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$ for some non-negative integer $n$ means that $U$ is a topological manifold.\n\n2.  **U must be connected**: Let's assume $U$ is not connected. Then it can be written as a disjoint union of at least two non-empty open sets, say $U = A \\cup B$, where $A$ and $B$ are open in $U$. Since $U$ is open in $X$, both $A$ and $B$ are also open sets in $X$.\n    The closure of $U$ in $X$ is $X$ itself, because $U$ is dense, i.e., $\\bar{U} = X$. So, $X = \\overline{A \\cup B} = \\bar{A} \\cup \\bar{B}$.\n    A key property is that since A and B are disjoint open sets in X, the closure of A does not intersect B, and the closure of B does not intersect A. Let's consider the sets $A' = X \\setminus \\bar{B}$ and $B' = X \\setminus \\bar{A}$. Both $A'$ and $B'$ are non-empty open sets that are disjoint and whose union is $X$, which contradicts the assumption that $X$ is connected.\n    A simpler argument is that if $U$ had more than one connected component, say $C_1, C_2, \\dots$, each would be an open set in $U$ and thus open in $X$. Since they are disjoint and their union is $U$, this would make $X$ a disjoint union of the open sets $C_i$, which contradicts the connectedness of $X$ unless there is only one such component. Therefore, $U$ must be connected.\n\n3.  **Dimension of U**: Since $U$ is a connected manifold, it must have a single, well-defined dimension, let's call it $n$.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the cardinality based on dimension**: We now have two cases for the dimension $n$:\n    *   **Case 1: n = 0**. A connected 0-dimensional manifold is a single point. So, $U$ is a single point. Since $U$ is an open and dense subset of a connected space $X$, $X$ must also be that single point. Therefore, the cardinality of $X$ is $|X| = 1$.\n    *   **Case 2: n > 0**. Since $X$ is a metric space, it is a Hausdorff space. A connected Hausdorff manifold of positive dimension ($n>0$) necessarily has the cardinality of the continuum, which is $2^{\\aleph_0}$. Thus, $|U| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n5.  **Relating the cardinality of U to X**: We have a metric space $X$ with a dense subset $U$. The cardinality of a metric space is related to the cardinality of its dense subsets. Specifically, for a metric space $X$ with a dense subset $U$, the cardinality of $X$ is bounded by $|X| \\le |U|^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    *   Applying this to our case where $|U|=2^{\\aleph_0}$, we get $|X| \\le (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\times \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    *   Furthermore, since $U$ is a subset of $X$, the cardinality of $X$ must be at least the cardinality of $U$. So, $|X| \\ge |U| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    *   Combining these two inequalities, we find that the cardinality of $X$ must be $|X| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe possible cardinalities for the space $X$ are 1 (when the dimension of the manifold $U$ is 0) and $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (when the dimension is greater than 0). Therefore, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$, and that upper bound is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n<<<An upper bound on the cardinality of $X$ is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.>>>"
