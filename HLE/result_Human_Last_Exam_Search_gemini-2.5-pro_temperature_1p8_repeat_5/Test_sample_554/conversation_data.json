    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain a number of fluorine atoms equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar structure. The term \"perfluoro\" indicates that all hydrogen atoms in a compound have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\nThe precise number of fluorine atoms would depend on the specific chemical structure of the nanocar in question, as different nanocars have different molecular formulas. For instance, one synthesized nanocar with a flexible chassis has the chemical formula C310H34. In a hypothetical perfluorinated version of this specific nanocar, all 34 hydrogen atoms would be replaced by 34 fluorine atoms.\n\nOther examples of nanocars include a nanotruck with the formula C282H18N4 and another nanocar with the formula C430H274O. A perfluorinated version of the nanotruck would contain 18 fluorine atoms, while a perfluorinated version of the latter nanocar would contain 274 fluorine atoms.\n\nTherefore, the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar is entirely dependent on the chemical composition of the specific nanocar's chassis and its molecular components.\n\n<<<34>>>"
