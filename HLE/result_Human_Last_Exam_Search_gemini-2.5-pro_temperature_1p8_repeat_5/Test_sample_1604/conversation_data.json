    "The battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler that was the latest historically is the **Charge at Huj**.\n\nThis engagement took place on **November 8, 1917**, during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War. The painting is titled *The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj*.\n\nOther notable battle paintings by Lady Butler and their historical dates include:\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras***: depicting the Battle of Quatre Bras on June 16, 1815.\n*   ***Scotland Forever!***: showing the charge of the Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815.\n*   ***Remnants of an Army***: portraying the arrival of William Brydon at Jalalabad on January 13, 1842, after the Battle of Gandamak.\n*   ***The Roll Call*** and ***The Return from Inkerman***: both depicting scenes after the Battle of Inkerman in November 1854.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift***: illustrating the battle on January 22-23, 1879.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!***: showing an incident at the Battle of Laing's Nek on January 28, 1881.\n*   ***Tel-el-Kebir***: depicting the battle on September 13, 1882.\n*   ***The 'Footballers at Loos'***: showing an event from the Battle of Loos in September 1915.\n*   ***In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards***: a scene from the retreat in 1914.\n\nWhile Lady Butler's last oil painting, *A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders*, was completed in 1929 and depicts a World War I scene, the specific event is not dated as precisely as the Charge at Huj. Therefore, based on confirmed historical dates, the Charge at Huj is the latest.\n\n<<<Charge at Huj>>>"
