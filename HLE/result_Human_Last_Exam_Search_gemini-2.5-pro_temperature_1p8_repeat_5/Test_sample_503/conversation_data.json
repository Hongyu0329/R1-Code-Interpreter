    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-category, from $[n]$ to $[m]$ is a pair of order-preserving maps, $f: [n] \\to [m]$ and $g: [m] \\to [n]$, that form a Galois connection. This means that for all $i \\in [n]$ and $j \\in [m]$, the following equivalence holds: $f(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le g(j)$.\n\nThis adjunction is uniquely determined by either the left adjoint map $f$ or the right adjoint map $g$. The number of such adjunctions can be found by counting the number of possible left adjoint maps or, equivalently, the number of right adjoint maps.\n\n1.  **Counting Left Adjoints**: An order-preserving map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all joins (suprema). In the context of the totally ordered sets $[n]$ and $[m]$, any order-preserving map automatically preserves non-empty joins. For $f$ to preserve all joins, it must also preserve the empty join, which corresponds to mapping the bottom element of $[n]$ to the bottom element of $[m]$. Thus, a map $f$ is a left adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and $f(0) = 0$.\n\n    For the given problem from $$ to $$, we need to count the number of order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ such that $f(0)=0$. Such a map is defined by the non-decreasing sequence of values $f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(23)$, where each value is in the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. This is equivalent to choosing a multiset of 23 elements from a set of 38 elements ($\\{0, \\dots, 37\\}$). The number of ways to do this is given by the stars and bars formula:\n    $\\binom{k+r-1}{k} = \\binom{23+38-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n2.  **Counting Right Adjoints**: Dually, an order-preserving map $g: [m] \\to [n]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all meets (infima). This requires that $g$ preserves the empty meet, meaning it maps the top element of $[m]$ to the top element of $[n]$. Therefore, $g$ is a right adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and $g(m)=n$.\n\n    For this problem, we need to count the order-preserving maps $g: \\to$ such that $g(37)=23$. Such a map is defined by the non-decreasing sequence $g(0), g(1), \\dots, g(36)$, where each value is in $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$. This is equivalent to choosing a multiset of 37 elements from a set of 24 elements ($\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$). The number of ways is:\n    $\\binom{k+r-1}{k} = \\binom{37+24-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same number, as $\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{37}$. Calculating this value gives:\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!(60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!} = 43,330,614,067,331,800$.\n\n<<<43330614067331800>>>"
