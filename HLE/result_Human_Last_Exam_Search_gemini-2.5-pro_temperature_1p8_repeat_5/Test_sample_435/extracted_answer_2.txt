Based on the available evidence, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 are predicted to exhibit a significantly enhanced cytokine release upon antigen stimulation, including higher levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, compared to CAR T cells manufactured without this cytokine. This is due to IL-15's ability to promote a more persistent, memory-like T-cell phenotype that is primed for a potent effector response.
