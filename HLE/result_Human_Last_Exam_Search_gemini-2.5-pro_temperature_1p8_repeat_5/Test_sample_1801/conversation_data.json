    "The two Nobel laureates featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why,\" were Murray Gell-Mann and Paul Krugman.\n\nPhysicist Murray Gell-Mann, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles, is visibly present in the \"Ask Why\" commercials. In one of the advertisements, he is explicitly identified.\n\nEconomist Paul Krugman, who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity, also had a connection to Enron. He served on Enron's advisory board in 1999. While his direct on-screen appearance in a commercial is not as clearly documented as Gell-Mann's, his paid advisory role during the period the \"Ask Why\" campaign was being developed has been widely reported.\n\nAnother individual, who has been described in some online forums as an \"Indian commentator,\" also appears in one of the commercials alongside Gell-Mann. However, the identity of this person and whether they are a Nobel laureate remains unconfirmed by available sources.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Paul Krugman>>>"
