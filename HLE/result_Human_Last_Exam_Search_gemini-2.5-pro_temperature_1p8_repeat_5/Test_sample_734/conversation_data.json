    "**Augustine of Hippo: A Pioneer in Theological Terminology for Natural Law**\n\nThe Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the potential alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD).\n\nAugustine's key insight was to define a miracle not as an event that violates the laws of nature, but as an event that is contrary to our limited human understanding of nature. He famously articulated this in his work, *City of God*: \"A portent, therefore, happens not contrary to nature, but contrary to what we know as nature\". This concept provided a sophisticated framework for understanding divine action within the created order.\n\nHe applied this principle to various theological issues, including the virgin birth and the consequences of the Fall of man. Augustine viewed the virgin birth as a \"notable miracle\". According to his framework, the virgin birth was not a violation of nature as God constituted it, but rather an event that transcended the normal, observable processes of human reproduction known to humankind. He wrote that while Jesus was born of a woman, which speaks to his human nature, the fact that a virgin could give birth indicates something beyond ordinary human experience.\n\nSimilarly, Augustine applied this understanding to the changes in the natural world and human nature resulting from the Fall. In *City of God*, he argued that human flesh was constituted differently before and after sin. Before the Fall, the human body was not subject to death, but after sin, it entered a state of mortality. This change was not a violation of some eternally fixed natural law, but a change in the very nature of humanity as willed by God in response to sin. Augustine equated the state of natural law with humanity's condition before the Fall, suggesting that after this event, a life lived perfectly according to that original unbroken human nature was no longer possible without divine grace.\n\nTherefore, Augustine of Hippo was the first to develop the specific terminology and conceptual framework to describe events like the virgin birth and the altered state of nature after the Fall as \"not contrary to nature, but contrary to what is known of nature\". This allowed for a theological explanation of divine actions that appear to be exceptions to the observable order of the world. Later theologians, including Thomas Aquinas, would adopt and further develop Augustine's foundational ideas on miracles and natural law.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
