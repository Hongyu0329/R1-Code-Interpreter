    "In Isaac Newton's color circle, the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue (which is green) and blue itself corresponds to the musical note **G**.\n\nNewton created a color wheel where he associated the seven colors of the visible spectrum with the notes of a musical scale. In his model, he used the Dorian musical mode starting on the note D. The correspondence between colors and notes in his system is as follows:\n\n*   **Red:** D\n*   **Orange:** E\n*   **Yellow:** F\n*   **Green:** G\n*   **Blue:** A\n*   **Indigo:** B\n*   **Violet:** C\n\nWhen yellow and blue are mixed, they produce the color green. Following Newton's mapping, the color green corresponds to the musical note G. The question asks for the range \"between\" green and blue. Given the discrete nature of Newton's assignments, the note associated with green, which precedes blue in his circular arrangement, is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
