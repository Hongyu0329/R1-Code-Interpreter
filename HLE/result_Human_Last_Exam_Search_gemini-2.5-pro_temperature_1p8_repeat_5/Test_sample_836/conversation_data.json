    "In the nuclear criticality community, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function describes the correlation between pairs of neutrons in both space and time. Its transformation into the frequency and wavevector domain provides a way to analyze the system's behavior. In the context of nuclear reactor noise analysis, the fluctuations in the neutron population, which are a result of the underlying correlations from fission chains, are measured by neutron detectors. The analysis of this \"neutron noise\" is a cornerstone of nuclear criticality safety and reactor diagnostics.\n\nThe Power Spectral Density (PSD) represents the distribution of the power of these neutron fluctuations as a function of frequency. It is mathematically related to the autocorrelation function of the neutron signal through the Fourier transform, a relationship known as the Wiener-Khinchin theorem. This makes the PSD the frequency-domain counterpart to time-domain correlation techniques like the Feynman-alpha and Rossi-alpha methods, which also analyze neutron noise to determine key reactor parameters.\n\nTherefore, while in other areas of physics this transform might be known as the dynamic structure factor, within the practical application of nuclear criticality analysis, it is the Power Spectral Density that is measured and used to characterize the reactor's state.\n\n<<<Power Spectral Density>>>"
