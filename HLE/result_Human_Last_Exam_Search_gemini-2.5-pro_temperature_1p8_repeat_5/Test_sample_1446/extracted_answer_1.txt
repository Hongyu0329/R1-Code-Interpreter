The precise value of the critical exponent ν depends on the specific universality class and spatial dimension, as a "G₄-theoretical framework" is not standard. For the O(4) model, ν ≈ 0.748 in d=3, ν = 1/2 in d=4, and ν=∞ in d=2. For the more common Ising model (O(1)), ν ≈ 0.630 in d=3 and ν=1 in d=2.
