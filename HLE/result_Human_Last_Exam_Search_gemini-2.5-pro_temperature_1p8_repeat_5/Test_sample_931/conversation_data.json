    "Adult Raphidopterans (snakeflies) are predatory insects, primarily feeding on soft-bodied arthropods like aphids. Several sources also indicate that adults have been recorded consuming pollen and nectar.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the options:\n*   **A. Nectar:** There are records of adult snakeflies feeding on nectar.\n*   **B. Māhoe pollen:** While the specific type of pollen, Māhoe, is not mentioned, adult snakeflies are known to eat pollen.\n*   **C. Fungus:** This is not a recorded food source.\n*   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** Raphidopterans are not herbivorous and do not eat leaf tissue.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** Aphids are a major food source for adult snakeflies. It is highly probable they would feed on a specific type like the Totara aphid.\n\nBased on the evidence, adult Raphidopterans have been recorded feeding on both nectar and aphids. Therefore, option F, which includes both, is the most complete answer.\n\n<<<F>>>"
