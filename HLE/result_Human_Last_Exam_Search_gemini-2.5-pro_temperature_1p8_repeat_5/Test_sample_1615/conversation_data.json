    "The final answer is $\\boxed{12344}$.\n\nLet $n = 12345$ be the number of vertices in the graph $G$.\n\nThe chromatic number of a graph with $n$ vertices, denoted $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring. A fundamental result in graph theory states that for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, its chromatic number is at most $n$, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n\nFurthermore, the equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if the graph $G$ is a complete graph, $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\nThe problem states that the graph $G$ is not a complete graph. Therefore, its chromatic number must be strictly less than the number of vertices.\n$$ \\chi(G) < n $$\nSince the chromatic number must be an integer, this implies:\n$$ \\chi(G) \\le n-1 $$\nFor the given graph $G$ with $n = 12345$ vertices, this means the chromatic number is at most:\n$$ \\chi(G) \\le 12345 - 1 = 12344 $$\nThis establishes an upper bound for the number of colors required. To show that this is the maximum possible number of colors, we must demonstrate that there exists a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices that is not complete and has a chromatic number of $12344$.\n\nConsider the following construction of a graph $G$:\n1.  Take a complete subgraph (a clique) on $n-1 = 12344$ vertices. Let this set of vertices be $S$.\n2.  Add one more vertex, $v$, to the graph, for a total of $n = 12345$ vertices.\n3.  Do not add any edges connecting $v$ to any of the vertices in $S$. (This graph is the disjoint union of $K_{12344}$ and a single isolated vertex).\n\nLet's analyze this constructed graph $G$:\n*   **Number of vertices:** The graph has $(n-1) + 1 = n = 12345$ vertices.\n*   **Is it a complete graph?** No, it is not a complete graph because the vertex $v$ is not adjacent to any other vertex in the graph.\n*   **What is its chromatic number?** The subgraph on the set of vertices $S$ is a clique of size $12344$ ($K_{12344}$). A clique of size $k$ requires $k$ colors for a proper coloring, as every vertex in the clique must have a distinct color. Therefore, we need at least $12344$ colors to color the vertices in $S$. This means $\\chi(G) \\ge 12344$.\n\nSince we have already established that for any non-complete graph with $n$ vertices, $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$, we have $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n\nCombining the two inequalities, we find that the chromatic number for our constructed graph is exactly:\n$$ \\chi(G) = 12344 $$\nSince we have found a graph that is not complete and requires $12344$ colors, and we know that no such graph can require more than $12344$ colors, the maximum number of colors needed is $12344$. The information about the maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ is not needed to determine this maximum value, although for the graph we constructed, $\\Delta(G) = 12343$ and the chromatic number is $\\Delta(G) + 1$, which is consistent with Brooks' theorem.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
