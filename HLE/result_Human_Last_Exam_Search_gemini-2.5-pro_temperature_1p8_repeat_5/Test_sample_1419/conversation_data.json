    "Near four dimensions, in the ϕ^4 theory, the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling u* is given in terms of ϵ = 4 - d, where 'd' is the dimensionality of space.\n\nThe non-trivial fixed point, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, is found by calculating the beta function for the coupling constant and finding its zero. To the leading order in ϵ, the fixed point coupling is:\n\n***\n<br>\n$$ u^* = \\frac{2}{3} \\epsilon $$\n<br>\n***\n\nThis result is a cornerstone of the renormalization group analysis of critical phenomena, providing a way to calculate critical exponents in a perturbative expansion in ϵ. The beta function describes how the coupling constant changes under a change of scale, and its fixed points correspond to scale-invariant theories, which describe systems at a critical point. The ϕ^4 theory in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions is a fundamental model for understanding the universal behavior of systems near a second-order phase transition.\n\n<<<u* = (2/3)ϵ>>>"
