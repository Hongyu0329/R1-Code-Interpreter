    "The number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512 is determined by analyzing the structure of the group and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\nThe semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as SD₅₁₂, can be presented as G = <a, x | a²⁵⁶ = x² = 1, x⁻¹ax = a¹²⁷>. The order of the group is 2⁹, so in the notation SD₂ⁿ, we have n=9. A power subgroup Gᵐ is the subgroup generated by the m-th powers of all elements in G, for some integer m.\n\nThe elements of SD₅₁₂ are of the form aⁱ or xaⁱ, for 0 ≤ i < 256. The calculation of the power subgroups Gᵐ is divided into two cases based on the parity of m.\n\n**1. When m is an odd integer:**\nThe m-th powers of the elements aⁱ generate the cyclic subgroup <a>, because m is coprime to the order of a (256). The m-th powers of the elements xaⁱ produce elements that are also outside of the subgroup <a>. Consequently, for any odd m, the power subgroup Gᵐ is the entire group G. This gives one power subgroup.\n\n**2. When m is an even integer:**\nLet m = 2k for some integer k ≥ 1.\n*   The m-th power of aⁱ is (aⁱ)ᵐ = aⁱᵐ. These elements generate the subgroup <aᵐ>.\n*   The m-th power of xaⁱ is (xaⁱ)ᵐ = ((xaⁱ)²)ᵏ. It can be shown that (xaⁱ)² = a¹²⁸ⁱ. Therefore, (xaⁱ)ᵐ = (a¹²⁸ⁱ)ᵏ = a¹²⁸ⁱᵏ. These elements generate the subgroup <a¹²⁸ᵏ>.\n\nThe power subgroup Gᵐ is the subgroup generated by both <aᵐ> and <a¹²⁸ᵏ>. Since 128k is a multiple of m=2k, the subgroup <a¹²⁸ᵏ> is always contained in <aᵐ>. Thus, for any even m, the power subgroup is Gᵐ = <aᵐ> = <aᵍᶜᵈ(m, 256)>.\n\nThe possible values for gcd(m, 256) where m is even are the even divisors of 256. These are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256. This leads to the following eight distinct power subgroups:\n*   <a²>\n*   <a⁴>\n*   <a⁸>\n*   <a¹⁶>\n*   <a³²>\n*   <a⁶⁴>\n*   <a¹²⁸>\n*   <a²⁵⁶> = {e} (the trivial subgroup)\n\nCombining both cases, the distinct power subgroups are the group G itself and the eight cyclic subgroups listed above.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 1 + 8 = 9 power subgroups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
