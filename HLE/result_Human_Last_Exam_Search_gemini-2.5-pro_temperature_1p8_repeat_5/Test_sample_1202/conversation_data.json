    "After a gene is duplicated, it becomes redundant. Without selective pressure to maintain both copies, one is likely to accumulate debilitating mutations and become a non-functional pseudogene, which is the most common outcome. For both copies to be retained and diverge in the genome, a specific mechanism must act to preserve them.\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion** is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange that can make the sequences of two duplicate genes more similar to each other. While it plays a role in the evolution of gene families, its homogenizing effect is contrary to the divergence of function.\n*   **B. Pseudogenization** is the process by which a gene becomes non-functional. This represents the *loss* of a duplicate gene's function, not its retention and divergence.\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation** is a macroevolutionary process where a single lineage rapidly diversifies into multiple species, each adapted to a different ecological niche. It describes the diversification of species, not the retention of genes within a genome.\n\nThis leaves neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization as the primary mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization** is a process where one copy of the duplicated gene retains its original function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it an entirely new function. This is an adaptive process that preserves both genes.\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization** proposes that the two gene copies divide the original functions of the ancestral gene. For example, if the original gene was active in two different tissues, each duplicate might specialize to be active in only one of those tissues. In this scenario, both copies become necessary to carry out the complete original function, ensuring their preservation through a neutral process.\n\nWhile both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are crucial for the evolution of duplicate genes, there is strong theoretical and empirical support for subfunctionalization being a highly probable initial outcome. The \"Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation\" (DDC) model of subfunctionalization suggests that neutral, degenerative mutations in different sub-functions of each gene copy are more likely to occur than a relatively rare mutation that bestows a completely new beneficial function (neofunctionalization). This process provides a clear and immediate reason for the retention of both copies. Furthermore, many researchers suggest that subfunctionalization can act as a transitional state, preserving duplicate genes over evolutionary time and allowing for the eventual evolution of a new function in one of the copies (neofunctionalization). Because subfunctionalization offers a more common, neutral pathway for the initial preservation of duplicate genes, which is a prerequisite for their subsequent divergence, it is considered a highly likely mechanism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
