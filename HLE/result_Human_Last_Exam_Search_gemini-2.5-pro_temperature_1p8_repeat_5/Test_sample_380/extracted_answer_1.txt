To summarize, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is **not** considered radial. For practical measurement purposes from a single spacecraft, the normalized magnetic helicity is calculated using the magnetic field components perpendicular to the solar wind velocity, which is approximately radial. The justification for this method is that the relationship between this measurement and the known alignment of the local magnetic field is then used to correctly identify the properties of the Alfven ion cyclotron waves. The analysis relies on correlating the measured helicity with the angle between the solar wind flow and the local magnetic field, which confirms the wave's properties.
