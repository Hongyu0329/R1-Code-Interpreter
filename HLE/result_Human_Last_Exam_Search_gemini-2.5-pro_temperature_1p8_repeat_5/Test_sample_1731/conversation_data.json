    "I have started by gathering information on the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems, as well as on the concepts of entropy and mean energy within the framework of Bose-Einstein statistics for light quanta (photons). The search results provide a good foundation on these individual topics. I now need to connect these concepts to find the equilibrium values. The next step will be to explicitly look for the derivation of the Bose-Einstein distribution and its associated thermodynamic quantities using the principles of large deviation theory. This will involve finding how the rate function in large deviation theory relates to the entropy and how minimizing this function under constraints (like fixed mean energy) leads to the equilibrium state.I have gathered some initial information on Large Deviation Theory (LDT) and its connection to statistical mechanics, including specific mentions of the Bose-Gas and photons. The search results confirm that LDT provides a mathematical framework for understanding equilibrium statistical mechanics and that entropy is related to the rate function in LDT. Some articles directly discuss the application of LDT to derive properties of a Bose gas.\n\nHowever, the specific steps to derive the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons) using the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems are not yet explicitly detailed. I need to find a more direct connection between these theorems and the derivation of the Bose-Einstein distribution, from which entropy and mean energy can be calculated. My next step will be to focus on finding a clear derivation of the Bose-Einstein distribution using the principles of large deviation theory. This will be the key to solving the user's request.The previous search results have confirmed that Large Deviation Theory (LDT) is a suitable framework for deriving the properties of a Bose gas, including that of photons. Some papers explicitly mention using Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems to reproduce the results of Bose and Planck. I've also found resources that outline the derivation of the Bose-Einstein distribution, which is the crucial step to finding the entropy and mean energy. Specifically, the connection between the rate function in LDT and entropy, and the use of Lagrange multipliers to handle constraints like total energy, appear to be key elements in the derivation.\n\nHowever, a detailed, step-by-step derivation that explicitly starts from the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems and arrives at the equilibrium entropy and mean energy for a photon gas is still not fully laid out. While the components are present across various sources, a unified derivation needs to be constructed. The next logical step is to synthesize the information from the search results to build this derivation. I will focus on how the large deviation principles for empirical measures (Boltzmann-Sanov) and for sums of random variables (Cramer-Chernoff) are applied to the specific case of a photon gas, where the number of particles is not conserved. This will allow me to determine the equilibrium distribution and subsequently the entropy and mean energy. Since I have the core components, I will now proceed to construct the final answer.\n\nLarge deviation theorems provide a powerful mathematical framework for understanding the equilibrium properties of statistical mechanical systems, including the Bose gas of light quanta (photons). By applying the principles of the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems, we can derive the equilibrium values for entropy and mean energy.\n\n### Theoretical Framework: Large Deviation Theory in Statistical Mechanics\n\nIn statistical mechanics, the macroscopic properties of a system are understood as the most probable a \"state\" of maximum entropy, subject to certain constraints like the conservation of energy. Large deviation theory formalizes this by quantifying the probability of rare events, or deviations from the most probable state.\n\nThe **Boltzmann-Sanov theorem** is concerned with the large deviations of the empirical measure of a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. In the context of statistical mechanics, this relates to the probability of observing a particular distribution of particles among different states, where the rate function is directly related to the concept of entropy. Specifically, the probability of observing an empirical distribution that is different from the true underlying distribution decays exponentially with a rate given by the relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence).\n\nThe **Cramer-Chernoff theorem**, on the other hand, deals with the large deviations of the sum of i.i.d. random variables. This is applicable to the total energy of the system, which is the sum of the energies of individual particles. The theorem states that the probability of the average energy deviating from its expected value also decays exponentially, with a rate function given by the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the cumulant generating function.\n\n### Derivation for the Bose Gas of Photons\n\nFor a gas of photons in thermal equilibrium, we consider the distribution of photons over different energy levels. Photons are bosons, meaning an unlimited number of them can occupy the same energy state. A crucial characteristic of a photon gas in a black-body cavity is that the number of photons is not conserved, which implies that the chemical potential is zero.\n\nThe equilibrium distribution is the one that minimizes the large deviation rate function (which is equivalent to maximizing the entropy) subject to the constraint of a fixed average total energy. The application of the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems leads to the Bose-Einstein distribution for the average number of photons with energy ε. For photons, where the chemical potential is zero, this distribution takes the form of the Planck distribution.\n\nThe equilibrium state is found by maximizing the entropy of the system under the constraint of a fixed total energy. This procedure, which can be formally justified using the principles of large deviation theory, yields the most probable distribution of particles among energy levels.\n\n### Equilibrium Values\n\nThe equilibrium properties of a photon gas can be derived from the Bose-Einstein statistics and Planck's law, which are themselves derivable from large deviation principles.\n\n**Mean Energy:**\n\nThe mean energy (U) of a photon gas in a volume V at a temperature T is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is obtained by integrating the energy density over all frequencies as dictated by Planck's law. The energy density u(T) = U/V is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature.\n\nThe total mean energy is:\n**U = (8π⁵k⁴ / 15h³c³) * V * T⁴**\n\nWhere:\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant\n*   h is the Planck constant\n*   c is the speed of light\n*   V is the volume\n*   T is the temperature\n\n**Entropy:**\n\nThe entropy (S) of the photon gas at equilibrium can also be calculated from the principles of statistical mechanics, consistent with the large deviation framework. The entropy is found to be proportional to the third power of the temperature.\n\nThe total entropy is:\n**S = (32π⁵k⁴ / 45h³c³) * V * T³**\n\nThese expressions for the equilibrium mean energy and entropy are the macroscopic thermodynamic quantities that emerge from the statistical behavior of the photons, the likelihood of which is described by the large deviation theorems of Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff. The equilibrium state is the one that is overwhelmingly most probable, with all other states being exponentially less likely for a large number of particles.\n\nIn summary, the equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas are determined by the temperature and volume of the system. Large deviation theory provides the fundamental probabilistic underpinning for why these specific macroscopic equilibrium states are observed.\n\n<<<The equilibrium value of the mean energy of a photon gas is given by U = (8π⁵k⁴ / 15h³c³) * V * T⁴, and the equilibrium value of the entropy is S = (32π⁵k⁴ / 45h³c³) * V * T³.>>>"
