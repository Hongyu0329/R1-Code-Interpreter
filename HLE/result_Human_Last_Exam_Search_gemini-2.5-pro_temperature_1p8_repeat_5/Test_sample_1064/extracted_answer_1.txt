The expected chain quality is given by the formula:

**Chain Quality =  \frac{(1-β)² * [1 + β(1-β)(2-p)]}{1 - β² + β³}**

Where:
*   **β** is the fraction of the total mining power controlled by the adversary.
*   **p** is the probability that honest miners will choose to mine on the adversary's block when a tie occurs.
