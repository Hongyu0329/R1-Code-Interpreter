    "A barbell graph with 10 nodes consists of two complete graphs of 5 nodes each, connected by a single edge, which is known as the bottleneck edge. In randomized uniform gossiping, each node is chosen with equal probability and then communicates with a randomly chosen neighbor.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the graph's structure:\n*   **Nodes:** A total of 10 nodes, with 5 in each complete graph.\n*   **Edges within complete graphs:** Each complete graph of 5 nodes has (5 * 4) / 2 = 10 edges. So, there are 20 edges within the two complete graphs.\n*   **Bottleneck edge:** There is one edge connecting the two complete graphs.\n*   **Total edges:** The total number of edges is 10 + 10 + 1 = 21.\n\nIn randomized uniform gossiping, a node is first selected uniformly at random. The probability of selecting any specific node is 1/10. This selected node then chooses one of its neighbors to communicate with, with each neighbor having an equal chance of being chosen.\n\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge depends on which of its two connected nodes is chosen and then whether that node chooses its neighbor across the bottleneck. Let's call the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge Node A and Node B.\n\n*   The degree of Node A (and Node B) is 5 (4 connections within its own complete graph and 1 connection to the other complete graph). The other 8 nodes each have a degree of 4.\n*   The probability of selecting Node A is 1/10. The probability of Node A then choosing Node B is 1/5. So the probability of this specific exchange is (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n*   Similarly, the probability of selecting Node B is 1/10, and the probability of it choosing Node A is 1/5. This also results in a probability of (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n\nTo find the total probability of the bottleneck edge being sampled, we add the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events:\n\n1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25\n\nThus, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is 1/25.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
