    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern, labeled `abcdefg`. The residues at the `a` and `d` positions are crucial as they form the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil through \"knobs-into-holes\" packing, which dictates the final oligomeric state. The given sequence is 28 amino acids long, corresponding to four heptad repeats.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the correct register (phasing) of the heptad repeat. We look for a register where the `a` and `d` positions are predominantly occupied by hydrophobic residues (like I, L, A, W, V). After testing the seven possible frames, one stands out as the most plausible. Let's assign the first residue, G, to the `d` position and follow the `defgabc` pattern.\n\nLet's test the register `d-e-f-g-a-b-c`:\n**Sequence**:   `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n**Position**:   `d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a` (The final 'G' would be in position 'a' of a fifth repeat)\n\nLet's list the residues at the critical `a` and `d` positions for the four full heptads:\n*   **Position `a`**: Q (Gln), K (Lys), W (Trp), Q (Gln)\n*   **Position `d`**: G (Gly), E (Glu), E (Glu), E (Glu)\n\nThis register is incorrect because both the `a` and `d` positions contain numerous polar and charged residues (Gln, Lys, Glu) and Glycine, which are not favorable for the hydrophobic core.\n\nLet's try another register, starting with the third residue 'I' at the `d` position, which corresponds to a `b-c-d-e-f-g-a` pattern for the start of the sequence.\n**Sequence**:   `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n**Position**:   `b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a`\n\nLet's list the residues at the `a` and `d` positions:\n*   **Position `a`**: S, K, E, E\n*   **Position `d`**: I, I, I, I\n\nHere, the `d` positions are consistently Isoleucine (I), a bulky hydrophobic residue. However, the `a` positions are Serine (S), Lysine (K), and Glutamic acid (E), all of which are polar or charged. This is also not a typical hydrophobic core arrangement.\n\nLet's try one more plausible frame. Given the repeating `E-I-A-x-S-L-K` motif, let's test a frame that places the hydrophobic residues `I`, `A`, and `L` in core (`a`, `d`) or stabilizing positions. Let's align the sequence so `I` is at `a` and `L` is at `d`. This means the `E` before the first `I` would be at position `g`.\n**Sequence**:   `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n**Register**:   `f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c`\n\n*   **Position `a`**: I, I, I, I\n*   **Position `d`**: L, L, L, L\n\nThis register provides a highly consistent and hydrophobic core, with all `a` positions occupied by Isoleucine (I) and all `d` positions by Leucine (L). This arrangement is a classic example used in studies of coiled-coil oligomerization.\n\nNow we can apply the established rules based on the identity of residues at the `a` and `d` positions, derived from the seminal work of Harbury et al.:\n*   **`a`=I, `d`=L**: Favors the formation of a **dimer**. The side chains of Isoleucine and Leucine pack efficiently into the core of a two-stranded coiled-coil in this specific arrangement.\n*   **`a`=I, `d`=I**: Favors a **trimer**.\n*   **`a`=L, `d`=I**: Favors a **tetramer**.\n\nBased on our analysis, the sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` has a clear `a=I, d=L` pattern. This combination optimizes the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing for a dimeric structure. The side chains fit together snugly, burying the hydrophobic surfaces and providing the thermodynamic driving force for the formation of a stable two-helix coiled-coil. The other residues at positions `b, c, e, f, g` are primarily polar or charged, which is typical as they are exposed to the solvent and can form stabilizing salt bridges.\n\nTherefore, the protein coiled-coil sequence would have a dimeric oligomeric state.\n\n<<<A>>>"
