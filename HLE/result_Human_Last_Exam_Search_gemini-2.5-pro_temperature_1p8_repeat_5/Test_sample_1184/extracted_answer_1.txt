The hotspots for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit on the human beta-1 subunit are the residues forming the Alpha-Binding Pocket (ABP) within the guanylate kinase (GK) domain. While exact residue numbers for human beta-1 are not specified in the provided context, key residues for gating modulation, which is also controlled by the GK domain, have been identified in the highly similar beta-1b isoform as Proline 221 and Serine 228.
