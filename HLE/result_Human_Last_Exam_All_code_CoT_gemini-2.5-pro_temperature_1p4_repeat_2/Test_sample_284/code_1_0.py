    This function demonstrates the reasoning for the p=4 case.
    It proves that if (t1, t2) and (s1, s2) satisfy the first two moment equations,
    they must be roots of the same quadratic polynomial. This implies {t1, t2} = {s1, s2}.
    Then it shows that the third moment equation is automatically satisfied.
    This proves that the L^4 norm of the extension operator applied to the constant function is finite,
    providing a counterexample for p=4.
