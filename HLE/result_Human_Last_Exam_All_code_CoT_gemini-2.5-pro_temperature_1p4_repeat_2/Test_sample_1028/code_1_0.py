    Analyzes strategies for mitigating identifiability issues in birth-death models.

    The core problem with fitting a birth-death model with time-varying speciation (lambda, L)
    and extinction (mu, M) rates on a phylogeny of only extant species is that the
    likelihood of the tree is determined by the pulled diversification rate (L(t) - M(t)).
    This means different combinations of L(t) and M(t) can yield the same likelihood,
    making them unidentifiable from the data alone.

    To mitigate this, one must either add information or reframe the problem.

    Let's analyze the given choices:
    A. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 constant pieces: This simplifies (regularizes) the
       rate functions, which is a common and necessary step for practical inference. It does not
       solve the core L vs. M problem but is a pragmatic part of a mitigation strategy.

    B. Incorporating prior information in a Bayesian framework: Priors add external information
       to the model, constraining the parameter space and helping to resolve the ambiguity
       between lambda and mu. This HELPS.

    C. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5: This
       drastically increases model complexity and the number of parameters without adding any
       new data. Such over-parameterization will only exacerbate the identifiability
       problem, making it worse, not better. This does NOT HELP.

    D. Incorporating fossils tips and sampled ancestors in the phylogeny: Fossils are direct
       evidence of extinct lineages. This provides the crucial data needed to independently
       estimate the extinction rate. This HELPS.

    E. Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled diversification rate: This strategy
       reframes the problem to estimate the parameter combination (L(t) - M(t)) that IS
       identifiable from the data. This is a classic way to handle unidentifiable models.
       This HELPS.

    F. Incorporating fossils tips in the phylogeny: As with D, adding fossil data directly
       addresses the lack of information about extinction. This HELPS.

    G. Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled speciation rate: Similar to E, this
       is another reparameterization that focuses on estimating a quantity that is
       identifiable from the extant phylogeny. This HELPS.

    Conclusion: The only strategy that is counter-productive and worsens the
    identifiability problem is to drastically increase model flexibility without adding
    any new information or constraints.

    answer = "C"
    explanation = """The strategy that does NOT help mitigate the identifiability issue is C.
Fitting a highly complex model (e.g., using high-degree polynomials for 10 different pieces) without adding new data (like fossils) or constraints (like priors) will only exacerbate the identifiability problem. It introduces a massive number of parameters, allowing for an even greater number of speciation and extinction rate functions to fit the data equally well, making the underlying rates less identifiable, not more."""
