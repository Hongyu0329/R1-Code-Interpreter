    "To determine the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a standard procedure for analyzing quartic polynomials.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Check Irreducibility**: First, we will determine if the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion for this. An irreducible polynomial of degree 4 will have a transitive Galois group, which can be $S_4$, $A_4$, $D_4$, $C_4$, or $V_4$.\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**: The discriminant helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. If $\\Delta$ is a perfect square of a rational number, the group is a subgroup of $A_4$ (i.e., $A_4$ or $V_4$). The discriminant for a depressed quartic $x^4+px+q$ is $\\Delta = 256q^3 - 27p^4$.\n3.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**: We will construct the resolvent cubic polynomial, $g(t)$. The reducibility of $g(t)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ provides crucial information. For $f(x)=x^4+px+q$, the resolvent cubic is $g(t) = t^3 - 4qt - p^2$.\n    *   If $g(t)$ is irreducible, the group is $S_4$ or $A_4$.\n    *   If $g(t)$ is reducible, the group is $D_4$, $C_4$, or $V_4$.\n4.  **Determine the Group**: By combining the information from the discriminant and the resolvent cubic, we can pinpoint the Galois group. If the group is narrowed down to $D_4$ or $C_4$, a final check of reducibility of $f(x)$ over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ is needed. A practical test for this is to check if any of the roots of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nThe following Python code will carry out these calculations and print the reasoning for each step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + p*x + q\n    p = 8\n    q = 14\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the polynomial f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\")\n    print(\"The polynomial is irreducible over Q by Eisenstein's criterion with prime p=2.\")\n    print(\"Thus, the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of S4.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the discriminant\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the discriminant Delta.\")\n    delta = 256 * (q**3) - 27 * (p**4)\n    print(f\"For the polynomial x^4 + {p}x + {q}, the discriminant is:\")\n    print(f\"Delta = 256 * (q^3) - 27 * (p^4)\")\n    print(f\"Delta = 256 * ({q}^3) - 27 * ({p}^4)\")\n    print(f\"Delta = 256 * {q**3} - 27 * {p**4}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {256 * (q**3)} - {27 * (p**4)}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {delta}\")\n    \n    sqrt_delta_int = math.isqrt(delta)\n    if sqrt_delta_int**2 == delta:\n        is_square = True\n    else:\n        is_square = False\n\n    print(f\"Is the discriminant a perfect square in Q? {is_square}\")\n    if not is_square:\n        print(\"Since the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group is not a subgroup of A4.\")\n        print(\"Possible groups are S4, D4, or C4.\\n\")\n    else:\n        # This case is not reached for this polynomial\n        print(\"Since the discriminant is a perfect square, the Galois group is a subgroup of A4.\")\n        print(\"Possible groups are A4 or V4.\\n\")\n        \n    # Step 3: Analyze the resolvent cubic\n    print(\"Step 3: Construct and analyze the resolvent cubic g(t).\")\n    # For x^4 + px + q, the resolvent cubic is g(t) = t^3 - 4*q*t - p^2\n    c1 = -4 * q\n    c0 = -(p**2)\n    print(f\"The resolvent cubic is g(t) = t^3 - 4*q*t - p^2\")\n    print(f\"g(t) = t^3 - 4*({q})*t - ({p})^2\")\n    print(f\"g(t) = t^3 + {c1}t + {c0}\")\n\n    # Find rational roots of g(t) using the Rational Root Theorem\n    # Possible roots are integer divisors of the constant term c0\n    divisors_of_c0 = [i for i in range(1, abs(c0) + 1) if c0 % i == 0]\n    divisors_of_c0.extend([-i for i in divisors_of_c0])\n    \n    rational_roots = []\n    for r in sorted(divisors_of_c0):\n        if r**3 + c1 * r + c0 == 0:\n            rational_roots.append(r)\n\n    print(f\"The rational roots of the resolvent cubic are: {rational_roots}\")\n    \n    if len(rational_roots) == 0:\n        # Not reached for this polynomial\n        print(\"The resolvent cubic is irreducible over Q.
