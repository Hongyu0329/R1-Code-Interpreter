    This function explains why the Si-N bond is shorter than expected.

    explanation = """
The experimentally determined Si-N bond distance is shorter than the calculated single bond distance due to a phenomenon called pπ-dπ back-bonding.

Here's the breakdown:
1.  A standard single covalent bond (a σ-bond) exists between Silicon and Nitrogen.
2.  The Nitrogen atom has a lone pair of electrons in a filled 2p orbital.
3.  The Silicon atom, being a period 3 element, has vacant and energetically accessible 3d orbitals.
4.  The filled 2p orbital of Nitrogen can overlap with an empty 3d orbital of Silicon.
5.  This overlap forms an additional, partial π-bond.
6.  This gives the Si-N bond partial double-bond character, which makes the bond stronger and shorter than a pure single bond.

This explanation corresponds to answer choice A.
