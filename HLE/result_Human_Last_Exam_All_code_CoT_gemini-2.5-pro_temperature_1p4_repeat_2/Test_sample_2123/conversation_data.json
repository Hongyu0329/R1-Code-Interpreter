    "This is a classic riddle based on a multi-layered pun. The solution involves identifying the specific essay, the key phrase within it, and then deciphering the wordplay that connects Vienna to an English poet. Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Essay and Author:** The riddle points to an essay by a Russian writer. The most famous instance of this clue relates to the Nobel Prize-winning poet Joseph Brodsky. In his essay \"A Guide to a Renamed City\" («Путеводитель по переименованному городу»), while describing his native St. Petersburg, he compares its avenues to the boulevards of other cities, explicitly mentioning Vienna's \"Ring\".\n\n2.  **Isolate the Vienna Clue:** The \"wide boulevards of Vienna\" refers to the Ringstrasse, Vienna's grand circular boulevard. In his essay, Brodsky uses the word \"Ring\" to refer to it.\n\n3.  **Decipher the Pun:** This is the crucial part.\n    *   The famous tram lines that run along Vienna's Ringstrasse are designated by letters.\n    *   One of the historic and well-known tram lines is the \"B\" line.\n    *   Combining the tram line (\"B\") with the boulevard (\"Ring\") gives you \"B-Ring\".\n\n4.  **Make the Final Connection:** The sound \"B-Ring\" is a pun on the surname of the famous English poet, Robert **Browning**.\n\nThe following Python code will print this deductive logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_vienna_poet_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle by explaining the multi-layered pun\n    connecting a Russian essay, Viennese boulevards, and an English poet.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Solving the riddle step-by-step:\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Identify the source.\")\n    print(\"The essay is Joseph Brodsky's 'A Guide to a Renamed City'. In it, he compares St. Petersburg's avenues to other cities' boulevards, including the 'Ring' in Vienna.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Identify the key location and feature.\")\n    print(\"The 'wide boulevards of Vienna' refers to the Ringstrasse. The key word used by Brodsky is 'Ring'.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Uncover the pun.\")\n    print(\"Vienna has tram lines running on the Ringstrasse, designated by letters. A famous line is the 'B' line.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Combine the clues.\")\n    print(\"Combining the tram line 'B' with the boulevard 'Ring' gives the phonetic clue: 'B-Ring'.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 5: Connect to the English poet.\")\n    print(\"The sound 'B-Ring' is a pun on the surname of the English poet Robert Browning.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the surname is:\")\n    surname = \"Browning\"\n    print(surname)\n\nsolve_vienna_poet_riddle()\n<<<Browning>>>\n```"
