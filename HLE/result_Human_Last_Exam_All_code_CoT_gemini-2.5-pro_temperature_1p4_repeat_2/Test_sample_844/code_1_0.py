    # Statement A
    print_wrapped("A. 'CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs than MA biotypes.'")
    print_wrapped("Analysis: The text states CA thrives on a raffinose (RFO) diet while MA thrives on a sucrose-only diet. This specialization strongly implies that CA has a more efficient mechanism for metabolizing RFOs. \nConclusion: Statement A is likely TRUE.")

    # Statement B
    print_wrapped("B. 'CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.'")
    print_wrapped("Analysis: The text says each biotype 'did well' on its respective diet. In a biological context, thriving on a specific food source is a strong indicator of adaptation and preference. \nConclusion: Statement B is likely TRUE.")
    print("-" * 50)

    # Statement C
    print_wrapped("C. 'Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.'")
    print_wrapped("Analysis: CA is transferred from watermelon (high-raffinose) to cotton (inferred low-raffinose). According to the principle of substrate induction, the lack of raffinose in the new environment would cause the aphid to produce less of the enzyme needed to digest it (galactosidase). The stated reason ('lower raffinose levels') is the direct cause. \nConclusion: Statement C is likely TRUE.")

    # Statement D
    print_wrapped("D. 'Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.'")
    print_wrapped("Analysis: This statement proposes the same outcome as C but gives a different reason. The reason here is 'higher glucose levels'. While cotton is high in sucrose (which breaks down into glucose and fructose), the text does not provide any information to confirm that this leads to overall higher internal glucose levels compared to the original watermelon diet, or that such a mechanism (known as catabolite repression) is the primary cause in these aphids. The reason provided in C ('lower raffinose levels') is a much more direct and certain consequence based on the text. Therefore, this statement introduces a speculative cause that is not supported by the evidence. \nConclusion: Statement D is NOT necessarily true, as the causal link is unverified.")

    # Statement E
    print_wrapped("E. 'Upon the host transfer, the MA biotypes showed increased galactosidase activity, owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.'")
    print_wrapped("Analysis: MA is transferred from cotton (low-raffinose) to watermelon (high-raffinose). The introduction of a high-raffinose diet would induce the production of the galactosidase enzyme to metabolize the new food source. \nConclusion: Statement E is likely TRUE.")
