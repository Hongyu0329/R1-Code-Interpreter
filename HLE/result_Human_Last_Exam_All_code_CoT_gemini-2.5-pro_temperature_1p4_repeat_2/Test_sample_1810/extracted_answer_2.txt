For k=3 and a=[2, 3, 4]:
The equation is:
N[3, 5, 4, 3, 2] = N[2, 3, 4, 4, 3] + c_k
Substituting the calculated values:
501 = 411 + 90

Verification using the derived formula for c_k:
c_k = N[a_1,...,a_k] * N[a_2,...,a_{k-1}]
c_k = 30 * 3 = 90
The result is consistent.

==============================

For k=2 and a=[5, 6]:
The equation is:
N[7, 6, 5] = N[5, 6, 6] + c_k
Substituting the calculated values:
247 = 216 + 31

Verification using the derived formula for c_k:
c_k = N[a_1,...,a_k] * N[a_2,...,a_{k-1}]
c_k = 31 * 1 = 31
The result is consistent.
