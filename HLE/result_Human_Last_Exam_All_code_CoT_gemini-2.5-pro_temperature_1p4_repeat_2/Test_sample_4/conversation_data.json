    "Of course, I can help you compute the Poincaré polynomial for the given Lie algebra. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Lie Algebra Structure:** The given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a 6-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra. It can be seen as a semidirect product $\\mathfrak{g} \\cong \\mathbb{R} \\ltimes \\mathfrak{h}$, where $\\mathfrak{h}$ is a 5-dimensional abelian ideal spanned by $\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$. The action is defined by the Lie brackets involving $e_1$.\n\n2.  **Decompose the Action:** The action of $e_1$ on the ideal $\\mathfrak{h}$ splits into two independent actions on subspaces.\n    *   One action is on $\\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4\\}$, where $e_2 \\to e_3 \\to e_4 \\to 0$. This corresponds to a standard nilpotent operator (a Jordan block) of size 3.\n    *   The other action is on $\\text{span}\\{e_5, e_6\\}$, where $e_5 \\to e_6 \\to 0$. This corresponds to a Jordan block of size 2.\n\n3.  **Use Known Results for Poincaré Polynomials:** The Poincaré polynomial for a semidirect product of this type can be constructed from the polynomials associated with its components.\n    *   The Betti numbers of a nilpotent Lie algebra defined by a single Jordan block of size $n$ are all 1. The corresponding polynomial is $1 + x + x^2 + \\dots + x^n$.\n    *   For our case, we have two such polynomials: $P_1(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3$ for the size-3 block, and $P_2(x) = 1 + x + x^2$ for the size-2 block.\n\n4.  **Combine the Polynomials:** The intermediate polynomial, which I'll call $P_{ker}(x)$, is found by multiplying the polynomials from the individual blocks: $P_{ker}(x) = P_1(x) \\cdot P_2(x)$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** The final Poincaré polynomial of the full Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is obtained by multiplying the intermediate polynomial by a factor of $(1+x)$, which arises from the structure of the semidirect product: $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x) \\cdot P_{ker}(x)$.\n\n6.  **Implementation:** I will implement this polynomial multiplication using Python's `numpy` library to get the final coefficients and then format the result into a readable polynomial string.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the Poincaré polynomial for the given 6-dimensional Lie algebra.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 3: Define the polynomials for the Jordan blocks.\n    # For the size-3 block {e2, e3, e4}, the polynomial is 1 + x + x^2 + x^3.\n    # Coefficients are for powers 0, 1, 2, 3.\n    p1_coeffs = [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    # For the size-2 block {e5, e6}, the polynomial is 1 + x + x^2.\n    # Coefficients are for powers 0, 1, 2.\n    p2_coeffs = [1, 1, 1]\n\n    # Step 4: Multiply these polynomials to get the intermediate polynomial P_ker(x).\n    # numpy.polymul performs polynomial multiplication (convolution of coefficients).\n    # Note: numpy's convention is high-power to low-power, so we reverse for our convention.\n    p_ker_coeffs = np.polymul(p1_coeffs[::-1], p2_coeffs[::-1])[::-1]\n\n    # Step 5: Multiply by (1+x) to get the final Poincaré polynomial.\n    # The coefficients for (1+x) are [1, 1].\n    one_plus_x_coeffs = [1, 1]\n    final_coeffs = np.polymul(p_ker_coeffs[::-1], one_plus_x_coeffs[::-1])[::-1]\n    \n    # Format the final polynomial string for printing.\n    poly_terms = []\n    for i, coeff in enumerate(final_coeffs):\n        if coeff == 0:\n            continue\n        # Format the term\n        if i == 0:\n            term = str(coeff)\n        elif i == 1:\n            if coeff == 1:\n                term = \"x\"\n            else:\n                term = f\"{coeff}*x\"\n        else:\n            if coeff == 1:\n                term = f\"x^{i}\"\n            else:\n                term = f\"{coeff}*x^{i}\"\n        poly_terms.append(term)\n    \n    # The final equation is requested. Let's build the equation string explicitly.\n    final_equation_parts = []\n    for i, coeff in enumerate(final_coeffs):\n        if i == 0:\n            final_equation_parts.append(str(coeff))\n        else:\n            final_equation_parts.append(f\"{coeff}*x^{i}\")\n\n    final_equation = \" + \".join(final_equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"The Poincaré polynomial is P(x) = B_0 + B_1*x + B_2*x^2 + ...\")\n    print(\"The computed Betti numbers (coefficients) are:\")\n    for i, coeff in enumerate(final_coeffs):\n        print(f\"B_{i} = {coeff}\")\n        \n    print(\"\\nThe polynomial is:\")\n    print(final_equation)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<1 + 3*x + 5*x^2 + 6*x^3 + 5*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
