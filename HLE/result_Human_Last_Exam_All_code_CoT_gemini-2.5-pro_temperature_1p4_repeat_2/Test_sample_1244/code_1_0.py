    # The problem asks for the smallest integer d such that a specific lattice L
    # is a d-neighbor of K = Z^n.
    # The lattice L is the even unimodular lattice in R^24 with root system D_24.
    # This lattice is known as D_24^+ or N(D_24).
    # K is the standard integer lattice Z^24.

    # By definition, two lattices L and K are d-neighbors if their intersection M = L \cap K
    # has index d in both L and K.
    # So, we need to find d = [L : M] = [K : M].

    # Step 1: Identify the intersection M = L \cap K.
    # L is constructed as D_24 union (v + D_24), where v = (1/2, ..., 1/2).
    # K = Z^24 consists of vectors with integer coordinates.
    # Vectors in (v + D_24) have half-integer coordinates, so they are not in K.
    # Therefore, the intersection M is the D_24 lattice itself.

    # This is because D_n is the kernel of the group homomorphism f: Z^n -> Z_2

    # We must ensure this is the smallest d >= 1.
    # d=1 would mean L is isometric to Z^24.
