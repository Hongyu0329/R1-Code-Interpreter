    "To find the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction, we first need to find a suitable model of the curve and then analyze its most singular point. The stable reduction of a curve is a complex process, but the \"thickness\" of a singularity can often be determined by a local analysis.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Transform the Curve Equation**: The given equation is $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. The leading coefficient `2` is not a unit in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ (since $v(2)=1$). It is standard practice to work with a model where the polynomial is monic. We perform the change of variables $x = 1/X$ and $z = Z/X^3$.\n    This transforms the equation into:\n    $(Z/X^3)^2 = 2(1/X)^5 + 2(1/X)^3 + 1$\n    $Z^2/X^6 = (2X + 2X^3 + X^6) / X^6$\n    $Z^2 = X^6 + 2X^3 + 2X$\n    This is a monic model, which is better for analyzing singularities.\n\n2.  **Locate and Isolate the Singularity**: We examine the reduction of this model modulo 2. The equation becomes $Z^2 = X^6$ or $(Z-X^3)^2 = 0$. This indicates a highly singular model over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, with the singularity located at $(X,Z) = (0,0)$.\n    To analyze this singularity, we make a change of coordinates to \"center\" it. Let $Z_1 = Z - X^3$. Substituting this into our monic model:\n    $(Z_1 + X^3)^2 = X^6 + 2X^3 + 2X$\n    $Z_1^2 + 2Z_1X^3 + X^6 = X^6 + 2X^3 + 2X$\n    $Z_1^2 + 2Z_1X^3 - 2X^3 - 2X = 0$\n    This equation describes the curve in the neighborhood of its worst singularity, now centered at $(X, Z_1) = (0,0)$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Singularity with a Newton Polygon**: The local behavior of the singularity is governed by the terms with the lowest valuation. The valuations of the coefficients are $v(1)=0$ and $v(2)=1$. The terms are $Z_1^2$, $2Z_1X^3$, $-2X^3$, and $-2X$. The equation can be written as:\n    $1 \\cdot Z_1^2 + (2Z_1 - 2)X^3 - 2X = 0$.\n    The Newton Polygon for this local equation relates the powers of $X$ and $Z_1$. The critical part of the polygon is determined by the two points corresponding to the terms $Z_1^2$ (powers (0,2)) and $-2X$ (powers (1,0)). The valuations of their coefficients are $v(1)=0$ and $v(2)=1$. The lower convex hull of points $(i, v(c_{ij}))$ is more complex. A simpler method is to balance the valuations of the terms.\n    The main terms that define the singularity are $Z_1^2$ and $-2X$. Their valuations must be equal and minimal:\n    $v(Z_1^2) = v(2X)$\n    $2 \\cdot v(Z_1) = v(2) + v(X)$\n    Given that $v(2)=1$, this becomes $2 \\cdot v(Z_1) = 1 + v(X)$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Valuations**: The structure of the singularity (specifically the slope of the Newton polygon edge connecting the points for $Z_1^2$ and $-2X$) tells us the ratio of the valuations needed to resolve it. This ratio is $v(Z_1)/v(X) = 2$.\n    We now have a system of two linear equations for $v(X)$ and $v(Z_1)$:\n    1) $2 \\cdot v(Z_1) - v(X) = 1$\n    2) $v(Z_1) - 2 \\cdot v(X) = 0$\n    Solving this system gives $v(X)=1/3$ and $v(Z_1)=2/3$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Thickness**: The \"thickness\" of the singularity is the common valuation of the dominant terms that define it. This value represents the \"depth\" of the singularity in the arithmetic direction.\n    Thickness = $v(2X) = v(2) + v(X) = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3$.\n    Alternatively, Thickness = $v(Z_1^2) = 2 \\cdot v(Z_1) = 2 \\cdot 2/3 = 4/3$.\n\nThe thickness is therefore $4/3$. The following code prints the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# We are given the valuation v(2) = 1.\nv_2 = 1\n\n# From analyzing the singularity of the curve's model, we derived a system of\n# linear equations for the valuations of the local coordinates X and Z1.\n# Let v(X) be x and v(Z1) be y.\n# The equations are:\n# 1) 2*y - x = v(2)\n# 2) y - 2*x = 0\nx, y = sympy.symbols('x y')\nsolution = sympy.solve([\n    2*y - x - v_2,\n    y - 2*x\n], (x, y))\n\nv_X = solution[x]\nv_Z1 = solution[y]\n\n# The thickness of the double point is the common valuation of the\n# principal terms defining the singularity.\n# Thickness = v(2*X) = v(2) + v(X)\nthickness = v_2 + v_X\n\n# We output the equation used to calculate the thickness\n# along with its final value.\nprint(f\"The thickness is calculated as v(2) + v(X).\")\nprint(f\"With v(2) = {v_2} and the calculated v(X) = {v_X}, the equation is:\")\n# sympy.Rational automatically finds the common denominator for printing.\nprint(f\"{v_2} + {v_X} = {thickness}\")\n\n```\n<<<$4/3$>>>"
