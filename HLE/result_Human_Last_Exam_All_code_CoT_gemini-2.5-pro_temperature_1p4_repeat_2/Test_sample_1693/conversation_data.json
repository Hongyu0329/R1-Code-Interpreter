    "I will identify the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat in the specified period by looking through naval loss records from the start of World War II (September 1, 1939) to the French armistice (June 22, 1940). After compiling a list of French ships sunk by U-boats, I will compare them by their displacement (measured in Gross Register Tonnage or GRT for merchant vessels) to find the largest one. Finally, I will write a Python script to present this information.\n\n```python\n# Data about the ship and the event\nship_name = \"Bretagne\"\nship_type = \"passenger liner\"\ndisplacement_grt = 10108\nsinking_date = \"October 14, 1939\"\nu_boat = \"U-45\"\narmistice_date = \"June 22, 1940\"\n\n# Print the final answer in a descriptive sentence\nprint(f\"The largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the {armistice_date} armistice was the {ship_type} SS {ship_name}.\")\nprint(f\"It had a displacement of {displacement_grt} GRT.\")\nprint(f\"The ship was sunk by the German submarine {u_boat} on {sinking_date}.\")\n```\n<<<SS Bretagne>>>"
