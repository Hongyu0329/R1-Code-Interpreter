    # --- Theoretical Background ---
    # The problem asks for the dimension of the quotient ring R/I, where:
    # R = C[x_1, ..., x_10] is a polynomial ring.
    # G is a finite group of order 10000 acting on R.
    # I is the ideal generated by G-invariant homogeneous polynomials of positive degree.
    #
    # This quotient ring R/I is known as the "coinvariant algebra".
    # A fundamental theorem in invariant theory states that for a finite group G acting on a
    # polynomial ring over a field of characteristic zero (like the complex numbers C),
    # the dimension of the coinvariant algebra is equal to the order of the group, |G|.
    #
    # Dimension(R/I) = |G|
    #
    # This result holds for any finite group G.
    
    # --- Calculation ---
    # The problem states |G| = 10000. Therefore, the dimension of R/I is 10000 for any such group G.
    # The question asks for the *largest possible* dimension. Since the dimension is constant
    # for any group of order 10000, the maximum value is this constant value.
    
    dimension_of_R_I = group_order
    
    # --- Outputting the Result ---
    # The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
    # The final equation is: Dimension(R/I) = |G|
