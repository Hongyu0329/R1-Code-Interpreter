    Analyzes several statements about Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and identifies the false one.

Analysis of the Statements:

A. Mathematically, you cannot have a valid SVM solution using support vectors from only one class.
   - Status: TRUE. This is due to the KKT condition `sum(alpha_i * y_i) = 0`. If all support vectors were from one class, the sum would be strictly positive, violating the condition.

B. With imbalanced or asymmetric data, having unequal margins can be optimal for SVM.
   - Status: TRUE. Weighted SVMs use different penalty parameters (C) for each class, which is conceptually equivalent to creating unequal margins to better handle imbalanced data.

C. Effective mapping to an infinite-dimensional space is computationally tractable for some kernels.
   - Status: TRUE. The 'kernel trick' (e.g., using the RBF kernel) allows for computations in an infinite-dimensional space without ever explicitly representing the data in that space.

D. It is possible to add or move data points and not affect the decision boundary at all, as long as they're interior points.
   - Status: TRUE. The decision boundary is defined only by support vectors. Points correctly classified and far from the boundary do not influence it.

E. Any strictly convex function has a unique global minimizer.
   - Status: FALSE. This statement is too general and is not universally true. A strictly convex function can lack a global minimizer. A classic counterexample is f(x) = e^x, which is strictly convex on the set of real numbers but has no minimum value (its infimum is 0, which is never attained).

Conclusion: The only statement that is not true is E.
