  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nXenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school. She is now learning the addition operation.\n\nThe teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils should calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+4.\n\nYou've got the sum that was written on the board. Rearrange the summans and print the sum in such a way that Xenia can calculate the sum.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains a non-empty string s — the sum Xenia needs to count. String s contains no spaces. It only contains digits and characters \"+\". Besides, string s is a correct sum of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. String s is at most 1000 characters long.\n\nOutput\nPrint the new sum that Xenia can count.\n\nTask:\n\nWrite the most memory-efficient C program to solve this problem.

    "My plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  Read the entire sum from the input as a single string.\n2.  The numbers in the sum are separated by the `+` character. I will split the input string by `+` to get a list of the numbers (as strings).\n3.  Then, I will sort this list of numbers. Since the numbers are all single digits, a standard lexicographical sort will correctly order them numerically.\n4.  Finally, I will join the elements of the sorted list back together into a single string, using `+` as the separator. This new string is the required result, which I will print to the console.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a sum, sorts the numbers, and prints the new sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the input line, e.g., \"3+2+1\"\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Split the string by '+' to get a list of numbers, e.g., ['3', '2', '1']\n    numbers = s.split('+')\n    \n    # Sort the list of numbers. For single digits, default sort is fine.\n    # e.g., ['1', '2', '3']\n    numbers.sort()\n    \n    # Join the sorted numbers back with '+' and print\n    # e.g., \"1+2+3\"\n    print('+'.join(numbers))\n\nsolve()\n```\nTo write the most memory-efficient C program for this problem, the optimal approach is to avoid storing the entire input string in memory. Instead, we can process the input character by character as it's being read. We only need to maintain a count of how many times each number (1, 2, 3, or 4) appears. After reading the entire input, we can construct and print the sorted sum based on these counts.\n\nThe variables required for this C program and their minimal memory consumption on a typical 64-bit system are:\n*   **An array for counts:** To store the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. The number of terms can be up to 501, so a `short` type is sufficient. `short counts[4];` requires `4 * 2 = 8` bytes.\n*   **A variable for input:** The `getchar()` function returns an `int`. `int c;` requires `4` bytes.\n*   **Loop counters:** An outer loop for numbers 1 through 4 (0 to 3) can use `char i;` (`1` byte), and the inner loop for printing can use `short j;` (`2` bytes), as the count can exceed a char's limit.\n*   **A flag variable:** To handle the printing of `+` signs correctly. A `char first_term;` is sufficient, taking `1` byte.\n\nThe total memory used for these variables would be the sum of their sizes: `8 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 16` bytes.\n<<<16>>>"
