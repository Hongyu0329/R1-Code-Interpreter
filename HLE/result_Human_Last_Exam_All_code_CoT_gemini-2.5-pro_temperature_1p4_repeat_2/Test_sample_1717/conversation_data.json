    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process and the final code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Base Values:** First, I will identify the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Normal Mode from the game's data.\n2.  **Apply Expert Mode Multiplier:** Next, I will apply the standard health multiplier for Expert Mode.\n3.  **Incorporate Multiplayer Scaling:** I will then incorporate the specific multiplayer health scaling formula for Expert Mode. This formula adds a certain percentage of health for each additional player in the game.\n4.  **Formulate the General Equation:** Using the above values, I will construct a general mathematical equation for the Eye of Cthulhu's health, `H`, as a function of the number of players, `N`.\n5.  **Analyze for Infinity:** Finally, I will analyze the behavior of this equation as the number of players `N` approaches infinity to determine the theoretical maximum health. The code will print out each component of the final, simplified equation and state the conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_eoc_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health of Terraria's\n    Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the base constants from Terraria's source code.\n    base_health = 2800\n    expert_mode_multiplier = 2.0\n    per_player_increase = 0.35  # 35% health increase for each player after the first.\n\n    print(\"To find the theoretical maximum health, we first need to establish the health formula.\")\n    print(f\"1.
