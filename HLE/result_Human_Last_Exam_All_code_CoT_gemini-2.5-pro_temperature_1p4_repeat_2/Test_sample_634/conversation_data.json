    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices P1 and P2, I will follow the standard procedure based on the Euclidean algorithm. The plan is as follows:\n\n1.  A compound matrix `M` is formed by stacking `P1` and `P2` vertically.\n2.  The problem of finding the GCRD is then equivalent to finding a basis for the row space of `M`.\n3.  I will use elementary row operations to reduce `M` to its row-reduced echelon form (RREF). This can be efficiently done using a symbolic math library.\n4.  The non-zero rows of the RREF of `M` will form the desired GCRD matrix.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan using the `sympy` library.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two\n    pre-defined polynomial matrices P1 and P2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's' which is common in control theory for the Laplace variable.\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2 as given in the problem.\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s**2 + s, -s],\n        [-s**2 - 1, s**2]\n    ])\n\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s, 0],\n        [-s - 1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    # To find the GCRD, we form a compound matrix by stacking P1 and P2 vertically.\n    M = P1.vstack(P2)\n\n    # The extended Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices involves reducing this\n    # compound matrix to its row-echelon form. The non-zero rows of the result\n    # form a basis for the row-space of M, which is a GCRD of P1 and P2.\n    # The sympy rref() method computes the row-reduced echelon form and pivot columns.\n    rref_M, pivots = M.rref()\n\n    # The number of non-zero rows in the RREF gives the rank of the matrix,\n    # and these rows form the GCRD. We extract these rows.\n    num_gcrd_rows = len(pivots)\n    GCRD = rref_M[:num_gcrd_rows, :]\n\n    # Print the resulting GCRD matrix. The problem asks to output each number\n    # in the final equation, so we will format the printout to clearly show the matrix elements.\n    print(\"The greatest common right divisor is the matrix:\")\n    \n    # Format the output to look like a standard matrix representation.\n    # We iterate through the rows of the GCRD matrix to print it.\n    output_str = \"\"\n    for i in range(GCRD.rows):\n        row_str = \"[ \" + \", \".join(map(str, GCRD.row(i))) + \" ]\"\n        output_str += row_str + \"\\n\"\n    print(output_str.strip())\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_gcrd()\n```\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
