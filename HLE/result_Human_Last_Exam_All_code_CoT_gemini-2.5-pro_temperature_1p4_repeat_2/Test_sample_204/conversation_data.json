    "To determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field, we will use the Whitehead formula's interpretation as the linking number of the preimages of two points on the target sphere S². This approach is often more direct than computing the integral of `A . B`.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Choose Two Points**: We'll select two distinct points, `p1` and `p2`, on the sphere S² (the space where the unit vector `n` lives). For convenience, we will choose the \"South Pole\", `p_S = (0, 0, -1)`, and a point on the \"equator\", `p_E = (1, 0, 0)`.\n2.  **Find Preimages**: We will find the set of points `(x,y,z)` in the 3D space that map to `p_S` and `p_E`. These preimages, `n⁻¹(p_S)` and `n⁻¹(p_E)`, will be closed curves (loops) in R³.\n    *   **Preimage of the South Pole (`C_S`)**: `n = (0, 0, -1)` implies `nz = cos(G) = -1`, which means `G = PI`. From the definition `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`, this gives `exp(-10 * r2) = 1`, so `r2 = 0`. This occurs when `(x*x+y*y-0.5)² + z*z = 0`, which is true only for the circle `x² + y² = 0.5` and `z = 0`.\n    *   **Preimage of the Equatorial Point (`C_E`)**: `n = (1, 0, 0)` implies `nx = 1`, `ny = 0`, `nz = 0`.\n        *   `nz = cos(G) = 0` implies `G = PI / 2`.\n        *   `ny = sin(G)sin(f) = 1 * sin(f) = 0` and `nx = sin(G)cos(f) = 1 * cos(f) = 1`. This requires `f=0`.\n        *   The condition `f = atan2(y,x) = 0` means `y = 0` and `x > 0`.\n        *   The condition `G = PI / 2` implies `PI * exp(-10*r2) = PI/2`, which gives `r2 = ln(2) / 10`. Substituting the definition of `r2` and `y=0`, we get the curve defined by `(x² - 0.5)² + z² = (ln(2)/10)²` in the half-plane `y=0, x>0`.\n3.  **Calculate Linking Number**: The Hopf charge is the linking number of these two curves, `H = Lk(C_S, C_E)`. We can compute this using the Gauss double integral formula:\n    `Lk(C1, C2) = (1 / 4π) ∫_C1 ∫_C2 (r1 - r2) ⋅ (dr1 × dr2) / |r1 - r2|³`\n4.  **Implement in Python**: We will write a Python script to parametrize the two curves and numerically compute the double integral using `scipy.integrate.dblquad`. The result should be an integer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the Hopf charge.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import dblquad\n\ndef solve_hopf_charge():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hopf charge of the given vector field by computing the\n    linking number of the preimages of two points on the sphere.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
