    This function provides the solution to the quantum symmetries quiz.

    # Analysis of the statements:
    # A: False. Momentum operator is a counter-example.
    # B: False. Sub-statement B2 is false because the scaling factor is incorrect.
    # C: False. The condition is necessary and sufficient.
    # D: True. Follows from [τ, H] = 0.
    # E: True. This is the definition of the generator for z-axis rotations.
    # F: True. Follows from the Heisenberg equation of motion.
    # G: False. The operators S(θ1) and S(θ2) always commute.
    # H: False. The angular momentum operator L_z is a counter-example.
    # I: True. This is a direct consequence of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula.
    # J: True. Follows from [S, H] = 0.
