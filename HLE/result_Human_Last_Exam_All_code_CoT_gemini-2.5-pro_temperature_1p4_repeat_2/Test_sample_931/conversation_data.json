    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Subject:** The question is about the diet of adult Raphidioptera, commonly known as snakeflies.\n2.  **Research Feeding Habits:** I will access my knowledge base regarding entomology to find documented food sources for adult snakeflies. Key facts are that they are predatory insects but may also supplement their diet.\n3.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n    *   **A. Nectar & B. Pollen:** I will check if adult snakeflies consume plant-based resources like nectar or pollen. Many predatory insects do this for energy.\n    *   **E. Aphids:** I will verify if small, soft-bodied insects like aphids are a primary food source. This aligns with their predatory nature.\n    *   **C. Fungus & D. Leaf Tissue:** I will check if there is any record of snakeflies being fungivores or herbivores.\n    *   **Geographic Specificity:** Choices B, D, and E mention Māhoe, Karamū, and Totara, which are plants native to New Zealand. I will verify the geographic distribution of Raphidioptera to see if this is relevant or a distractor.\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** Based on the evaluation, I will determine the most accurate and comprehensive answer from the choices provided (A-G).\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_snakefly_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the diet of adult Raphidioptera (snakeflies)\n    by evaluating the provided options based on biological facts.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the question: What do adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) eat?\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Step 1: Recall general biological knowledge about adult Raphidioptera.\n    fact1 = \"Adult Raphidioptera are primarily predatory, equipped with chewing mouthparts to hunt small, soft-bodied arthropods.\"\n    fact2 = \"In addition to predation, they are also known to supplement their diet with pollen and nectar for energy.\"\n    \n    print(\"Fact 1:\", fact1)\n    print(\"Fact 2:\", fact2)\n    print(\"\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Evaluate each choice.\n    print(\"Evaluating the answer choices:\")\n    \n    # Choice A: Nectar\n    evaluation_A = \"A.
