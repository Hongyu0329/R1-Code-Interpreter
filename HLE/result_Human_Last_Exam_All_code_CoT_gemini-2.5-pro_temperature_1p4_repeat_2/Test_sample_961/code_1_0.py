# The stable commutator length of a single commutator [a, b] in a free group F_2
# is a known result from geometric group theory.
scl_of_single_commutator = 0.5

# Step 1: Calculate the scl of one component c_i^30 in its respective group F_i.
# Using the homogeneity property: scl(g^n) = n * scl(g).
scl_of_one_component = exponent * scl_of_single_commutator

# Step 2: Calculate the total scl.
# Using the additivity property for free products, the total scl is the sum
# of the scl of each component. Since all components are identical, we multiply.
total_scl = num_groups * scl_of_one_component

# Print the final equation with each number and the result.
# The calculation is based on the formula: total_scl = num_groups * (exponent * scl_of_single_commutator)
# Which simplifies to: total_scl = num_groups * scl_of_one_component
