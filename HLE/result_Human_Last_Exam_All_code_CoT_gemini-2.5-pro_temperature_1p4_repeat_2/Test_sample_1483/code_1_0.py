def solve_continuum_problem():
    """
    This function determines the smallest possible cardinality of the collection
    of regular proper subcontinua of a nondegenerate decomposable continuum.

    The solution is based on established results in topological continuum theory.

    1. A theorem states that any decomposable continuum must have at least one
       regular proper subcontinuum. This means the cardinality is >= 1.

    2. An example can be constructed to show that a cardinality of 2 is possible.
       This is done by joining two indecomposable continua (like pseudo-arcs)
       at a single point. In this space, the only two regular proper subcontinua
       are the two original indecomposable continua themselves.

    3. It is conjectured and widely believed that a cardinality of 1 is not possible.

    Combining these points, the smallest possible cardinality is 2.
