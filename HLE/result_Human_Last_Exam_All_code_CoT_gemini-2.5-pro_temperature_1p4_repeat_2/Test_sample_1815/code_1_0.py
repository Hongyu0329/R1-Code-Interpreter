# The problem is to find the number of totally bounded group topologies 
# on the integers (Z) with no nontrivial convergent sequences.

# Step 1: Characterize the "no nontrivial convergent sequences" property.
# A sequence is nontrivial if it is not eventually constant.
# This property means that any convergent sequence must be eventually constant.
# In the theory of topological groups, this property is equivalent to the group being a P-space
# (a space where any countable intersection of open sets is open).

# Step 2: Characterize P-space topological groups.
# A major result in the field states that a P-space topological group must be discrete
# under very general conditions that apply to Z.
# So, any such topology on the integers must be the discrete topology.

# Step 3: Check if the discrete topology on Z is totally bounded.
# A group G is totally bounded if for every open neighborhood U of the identity,
# G can be covered by a finite number of translates of U.
# Let's check this for G = Z with the discrete topology.
# The identity element in Z (with addition) is 0.
# In the discrete topology, every set is open. So, U = {0} is an open neighborhood of 0.
# If the topology were totally bounded, there would have to be a finite number of integers
# g_1, g_2, ..., g_n such that:
# Z = (g_1 + U) U (g_2 + U) U ... U (g_n + U)
# Substituting U = {0}, we get:
# Z = {g_1} U {g_2} U ... U {g_n}
# Z = {g_1, g_2, ..., g_n}
# This equation states that the infinite set of all integers Z is equal to a finite set.
# This is a contradiction.

# Step 4: Conclude.
# The discrete topology on Z is not totally bounded.
# Since any topology satisfying the given conditions must be discrete, and the discrete
# topology is not totally bounded, no such topology exists.
# The number of such topologies is 0.
