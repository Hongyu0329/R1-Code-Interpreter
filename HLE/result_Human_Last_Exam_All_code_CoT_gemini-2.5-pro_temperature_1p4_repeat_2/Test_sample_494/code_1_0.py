Yes, the ammonia molecule with exotic spin-0 hydrogens would still exhibit tunneling. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1.  **The Origin of Tunneling:** The tunneling phenomenon in an ammonia molecule (NH3), known as "ammonia inversion," is a direct consequence of its physical structure. The molecule is a pyramid with the nitrogen atom at the apex. There is a potential energy barrier that the nitrogen atom must overcome to move to an equivalent position on the other side of the plane formed by the three hydrogen atoms. Quantum mechanics allows the nitrogen atom to "tunnel" through this barrier instead of going over it. This process is determined by the shape of the potential energy surface and the masses of the nuclei, none of which are changed by altering the nuclear spin. Therefore, the physical conditions for tunneling remain.

2.  **The Role of Nuclear Spin and Quantum Statistics:** The critical change is in the nature of the hydrogen nuclei.
    *   **Ordinary Hydrogen:** Has a nucleus (a proton) with spin-1/2. Particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**. The Pauli Exclusion Principle dictates that the total wavefunction of a system of identical fermions must be *antisymmetric* when you exchange any two of them.
    *   **Exotic Hydrogen:** Has a nucleus with spin-0. Particles with integer spin are **bosons**. The total wavefunction of a system of identical bosons must be *symmetric* when you exchange any two of them.

3.  **Symmetry and "Allowed" States:** This symmetry requirement acts as a selection rule, dictating which energy states are physically allowed to exist. The tunneling itself splits the molecule's ground vibrational state into a pair of very closely spaced energy levels: a lower-energy symmetric state and a higher-energy antisymmetric state.

4.  **Analysis for Exotic (Bosonic) Ammonia:**
    *   The total wavefunction must be symmetric under the exchange of any two spin-0 hydrogen nuclei.
    *   The combined nuclear spin state for three spin-0 particles is inherently symmetric.
    *   This means the rest of the wavefunction (the product of the vibrational and rotational parts) must also be symmetric.
    *   Crucially, both the lower and upper energy levels of the tunneling doublet can be combined with appropriate, allowed rotational states to satisfy this overall symmetry requirement.

5.  **Conclusion:** Because the rules of quantum mechanics permit both the lower and upper energy levels of the tunneling doublet to exist, the energy splitting due to tunneling is still present. Molecules could be found in the lower state, and transitions to the upper state would be possible (e.g., by absorbing a microwave photon). Thus, the phenomenon of tunneling would still be exhibited. The primary observable difference would be in the fine structure of the absorption spectrum, as some rotational lines would be "missing" compared to normal ammonia, but the fundamental tunneling splitting would persist.
