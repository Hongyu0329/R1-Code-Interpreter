    "An assemblé is a classical ballet step that involves jumping from one foot and landing on two feet. The core principle of a basic assemblé (specifically, an assemblé côté, or to the side) is to return to the original starting position.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each option:\n1.  **Starting Position:** We'll assume the standard 5th position, right foot in front.\n2.  **Entrechat six:** This is a jump with three beats of the legs (resulting in six movements). Starting from the 5th position with the right foot front, the dancer lands in the 5th position with the left foot front. The position is *changed*.\n3.  **Échappé battu changé:** The name itself indicates a change. The dancer jumps from the 5th position, opens the legs to the 2nd position, and then jumps from the 2nd position to close in the 5th position with the opposite foot in front. The position is *changed*.\n4.  **Assemblé:** The dancer brushes the working foot out (e.g., the right foot to the side from the 5th position), jumps off the supporting (left) foot, and brings both legs together (\"assembles\" them) in the air to land simultaneously in the original 5th position (right foot front). The position is the *same*.\n5.  **Glissade derrière:** This is a gliding, traveling step. Starting with the right foot in front, the dancer glides the back (left) foot out and closes the right foot *behind* it. The new position is the 5th position with the left foot front. The position is *changed*.\n6.  **Gargouillade:** This is a complex decorative step similar to a pas de chat, involving circular movements (ronds de jambe) of both legs in the air. It typically results in landing with the opposite foot in front. The position is *changed*.\n\nBased on this analysis, the assemblé is the step that ends in the same position it started from.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ballet_steps():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to determine which one ends in the same\n    leg position as its starting position.\n    \"\"\"\n    steps = {\n        \"A.
