    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Number:** First, I need to determine the specific number that \\( m_{4/7} \\) represents. In this context, generalized Markov numbers are quadratic irrationals associated with rational numbers. For a given rational \\( p/q \\), the number \\( m_{p/q} \\) is derived from a quadratic form related to \\( p/q \\). The specific definition I will use is the one from the theory of Markoff forms, which defines \\( m_{p/q} \\) as a root of a quadratic equation.\n\n2.  **Calculate Parameters:** For \\( p/q = 4/7 \\), I'll first find the integer \\( k \\) such that \\( 0 < k < 7 \\) and \\( 4k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 7 \\). This \\(k\\) is essential for defining the quadratic form.\n\n3.  **Find the Quadratic Irrational:** The number \\( m_{p/q} \\) is the positive root associated with the quadratic form \\( px^2 + (2k-q)xy - ky^2 \\). The root (as a value for x/y) is \\( \\frac{-(2k-q) + \\sqrt{(2k-q)^2 - 4(p)(-k)}}{2p} \\). This can be written in the standard form \\( \\frac{P + \\sqrt{D}}{Q} \\), which is the input for the continued fraction algorithm.\n\n4.  **Compute the Continued Fraction:** I will implement the standard PQa algorithm for computing the continued fraction of a quadratic irrational. This is an efficient, integer-based method that involves iteratively finding coefficients and updating the state variables \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) until a repeating state is found, which signifies the periodic part of the fraction.\n\n5.  **Format the Output:** The final Python code will perform all these calculations and print out the definition of the number \\( m_{4/7} \\), its value in radical form, and its final continued fraction. As requested, the code will also print each coefficient of the resulting periodic fraction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_markov_cf():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number m_{4/7}.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Plan:\n    # 1. For the generalized Markov number m_{p/q}, we first need to identify the specific quadratic irrational number it represents.\n    #    For a given rational p/q, a standard definition associates it with a quadratic form px^2 + (2k-q)xy - ky^2, where k is an integer\n    #    such that pk = 1 (mod q) and 0 < k < q.\n    # 2. The generalized Markov number m_{p/q} is the larger root of the corresponding quadratic equation in x/y, which can be found using the quadratic formula.\n    #    This root is a quadratic irrational of the form (P + sqrt(D))/Q.\n    # 3. For p/q = 4/7, we will calculate k, then find the discriminant D, and the specific number m_{4/7}.\n    # 4. Once we have the number in the form (P + sqrt(D))/Q, we use the PQa algorithm to compute its continued fraction.\n    #    This algorithm iteratively finds the integer parts (coefficients) and the new P, Q values until a (P, Q) pair repeats, indicating a period.\n    # 5.
