# The problem asks for the number of Maslov 2 holomorphic disks for a specific
# Lagrangian torus in the 4-dimensional complex projective space (CP^4).
# This corresponds to the case where n=4.

n = 4

# The number of such disks is given by the formula: 2^(n-1) - 1.
# We will now calculate this value for n=4.

# Define the constants for the equation
base = 2
one = 1

# Calculate the exponent
exponent = n - 1

# Calculate the final result
result = base**exponent - one

# To fulfill the requirement of showing each number in the final equation,
# we print the equation with its intermediate and final values.
power_result = base**exponent
