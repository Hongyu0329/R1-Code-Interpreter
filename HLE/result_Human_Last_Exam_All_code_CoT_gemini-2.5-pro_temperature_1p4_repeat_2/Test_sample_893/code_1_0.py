def solve():
    """
    This function prints the solution to the given problem.
    The solution is a six-letter string corresponding to the answers for classes A through F.
    - Y: All sets in the class have a maximal element.
    - N: No set in the class has a maximal element.
    - D: It depends on the specific set chosen from the class.
    
    The reasoning for each case is as follows:
    A) N: For any H-free graph, we can add an isolated vertex to get a larger H-free graph.
    B) D: A finite set has a maximal element if and only if it is non-empty.
    C) D: The set of integers has no maximal element, but the set {0, -1, -2, ...} does.
    D) Y: There are no uncountable discrete subsets of R, so the statement is vacuously true.
    E) Y: A constant sequence (c, c, ...) is maximal under the supersequence order.
    F) Y: A universal sequence (containing every n in N infinitely often) is maximal under the subsequence order.
