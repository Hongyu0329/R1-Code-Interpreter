    This function solves the mathematical problem.
    Based on the logical deduction, the property of the topological group G implies that G is locally connected.
    In a locally connected space, the components of any open subset are themselves open.
    Therefore, for any open subset of G, the number of non-open components is 0.
    The largest possible number of non-open components is consequently 0.
