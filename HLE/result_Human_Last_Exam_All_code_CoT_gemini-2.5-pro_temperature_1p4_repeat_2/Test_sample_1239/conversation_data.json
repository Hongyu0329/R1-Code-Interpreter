    "To determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify all the continuous transformations of the independent variables (time $t$, space $\\mathbf{x}$) and dependent variables (velocity $\\mathbf{v}$, pressure $p$) that leave the equations invariant. The total number of independent parameters for these transformations gives the dimension of the group.\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are:\n1.  $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}$\n2.  $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0$\n\nThe symmetries are as follows:\n1.  **Time translation**: The equations do not explicitly depend on time, so they are invariant under a shift in time $t \\rightarrow t + s$. This provides 1 dimension.\n2.  **Space translations**: The equations are homogeneous in space, so they are invariant under a shift in spatial coordinates $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$. Since space is 3-dimensional, this provides 3 dimensions.\n3.  **Space rotations**: The equations are isotropic, meaning they are invariant under spatial rotations $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow R\\mathbf{x}$, where $R \\in SO(3)$. The group of rotations in 3D has 3 dimensions.\n4.  **Galilean boosts**: The equations are invariant under a transformation to a uniformly moving reference frame. This transformation affects space and velocity as $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x} + t\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{u}$. This gives another 3 dimensions for the boost velocity $\\mathbf{u}$.\n5.  **Scaling (Dilatation)**: The equations are invariant under a specific scaling transformation: $t \\rightarrow \\lambda^2 t$, $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\lambda \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{v} \\rightarrow \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{v}$, and $p \\rightarrow \\lambda^{-2} p$. This is a one-parameter family of transformations, adding 1 dimension.\n6.  **Pressure shift**: Since the pressure $p$ only appears through its gradient $\\nabla p$, we can add any constant to it without changing the equations, i.e., $p \\rightarrow p + c$. This provides 1 more dimension.\n\nThe following Python script calculates the total dimension by summing the dimensions contributed by each of these symmetries.\n\n```python\ndef solve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries\n    for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The dimension of the Lie group is the number of independent parameters\n    # in the continuous transformations that leave the equations invariant.\n    # We sum the dimensions from each type of symmetry.\n\n    # 1.
