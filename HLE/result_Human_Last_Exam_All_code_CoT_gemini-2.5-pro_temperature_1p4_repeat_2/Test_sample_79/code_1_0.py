    # --- Analysis Step by Step ---

    # Statement 1 Analysis
    # The problem explicitly states the phenotype has "no bearing on fitness" and
    # "all genotypes have equal fitness". This is the literal definition of no selection.
    is_statement_1_true = True
    reason_1 = "The problem explicitly states the phenotype has 'no bearing on fitness' and 'all genotypes have equal fitness'. This is the definition of no selection."

    # Statement 2 Analysis
    # The term "non-overlapping generations" is a modeling assumption primarily about
    # reproductive timing (parents and offspring don't reproduce simultaneously). It does
    # not logically forbid all forms of parental care before the parents die.
    is_statement_2_true = False
    reason_2 = "The term 'non-overlapping generations' is a modeling assumption about reproductive timing. It does not absolutely forbid all forms of parental care, so this statement is not a necessary truth."

    # Statement 3 Analysis
    # The problem establishes the absence of all primary evolutionary mechanisms:
    # no selection, no mutation, no genetic drift (infinite population), and no gene flow.
    # Without these mechanisms, the population cannot evolve. Speciation is an evolutionary outcome.
    is_statement_3_true = True
    reason_3 = "The problem establishes the absence of all primary evolutionary mechanisms: no selection, no mutation, no genetic drift, and no gene flow. Without any mechanism for evolution, speciation cannot occur."

    # Statement 4 Analysis
    # While random mating ensures uniform allele frequencies across the region, broad-sense
    # heritability (H^2 = 0.7) is less than 1. This means environmental factors account for
    # 30% of phenotypic variance. The environment could differ systematically between the
    # west and east, causing a substantial difference in the average phenotype.
    is_statement_4_true = False
    reason_4 = "Heritability is not 1 (it is 0.7), meaning environment influences the phenotype. The environment could differ between the west and east, creating a phenotypic difference even if the genetic makeup is uniform."
