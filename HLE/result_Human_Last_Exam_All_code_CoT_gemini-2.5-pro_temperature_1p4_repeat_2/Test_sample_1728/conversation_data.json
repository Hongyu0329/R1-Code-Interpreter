    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the definitions of the \"sum of graphs\" and the \"chromatic number\".\n\n**1. Sum of Graphs (Graph Join):**\nThe \"sum\" of graphs, often called the graph join and denoted by the `+` symbol, is a graph formed from disjoint copies of the graphs by adding all possible edges between the vertices of different graphs.\nLet \\(G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_k\\) be graphs. Their join, \\(G = G_1 + G_2 + \\ldots + G_k\\), connects every vertex of \\(G_i\\) to every vertex of \\(G_j\\) for all \\(i \\neq j\\).\n\n**2. Chromatic Number of a Graph Join:**\nA key property of the graph join is that its chromatic number is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs.\n\\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2 + \\ldots + G_k) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) + \\ldots + \\chi(G_k) \\)\nIn our case, the graph \\(G\\) is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\), let's call them \\(C_n\\). So, \\(G = C_n + C_n + C_n\\).\nTherefore, \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) \\).\n\n**3. Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\(C_n\\)):**\nThe chromatic number of a cycle graph \\(C_n\\) (where \\(n \\ge 3\\)) depends on whether \\(n\\) is even or odd:\n*   If \\(n\\) is **even**, we can color the vertices by alternating two colors. So, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n*   If \\(n\\) is **odd**, we need a third color for the last vertex. So, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n\n**4. Finding the Maximal Chromatic Number:**\nTo find the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\), we must maximize the value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\). The maximum possible value for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 3, which occurs when \\(n\\) is an odd number.\n\nBy substituting this maximal value into our equation for \\( \\chi(G) \\), we get the maximal chromatic number.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and explains this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The problem is to find the maximal chromatic number of a graph G, where G is the sum of three cycles of length n.\")\n    print(\"Let the three cycles be C_n^1, C_n^2, and C_n^3. Then G = C_n^1 + C_n^2 + C_n^3.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Understand the chromatic number of a graph sum (join).\")\n    print(\"The chromatic number of a join of graphs is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers.\")\n    print(\"So, X(G) = X(C_n^1) + X(C_n^2) + X(C_n^3).\")\n    \n    num_cycles = 3\n    print(f\"Since all three graphs are cycles of length n, X(G) = {num_cycles} * X(C_n).\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Understand the chromatic number of a cycle C_n (for n >= 3).\")\n    print(\"- If n is even, X(C_n) = 2.\")\n    print(\"- If n is odd, X(C_n) = 3.\")\n    \n    chi_cn_even = 2\n    chi_cn_odd = 3\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Find the maximal chromatic number of G.\")\n    print(\"To maximize X(G), we must maximize X(C_n).\")\n    max_chi_cn = max(chi_cn_even, chi_cn_odd)\n    print(f\"The maximum value for X(C_n) is {max_chi_cn}, which occurs when n is odd.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Calculate the final result.\")\n    maximal_chromatic_number = num_cycles * max_chi_cn\n    \n    # Final output showing the numbers in the equation\n    print(\"The maximal chromatic number of G is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"{num_cycles} * {max_chi_cn} = {maximal_chromatic_number}\")\n\nsolve_chromatic_number()\n<<<9>>>\n```"
