    This problem asks for the dimension of the vector space of digitary functions.

    A function f is digitary if its value f(x) can be computed by a sum based on the digits of x.
    Specifically, f(sum(A_n / 10^n)) = sum(T(A)_n), where T(A)_n depends on n and the digits A_n, A_{n+1}, A_{n+2}.

    1. The problem is defined by the "shortsighted" map T, where T(A)_n depends on a window of digits starting at index n. The size of this window is crucial. Here, the window is (A_n, A_{n+1}, A_{n+2}), which has a size of 3. In the literature on this topic, this is referred to as a memory of k=3.

    2. The key constraint is that f must be a well-defined function on real numbers. Numbers with terminating decimals have two representations (e.g., 0.5 = 0.500... and 0.499...). The formula for f must yield the same result for both representations.

    3. This well-definedness condition leads to a system of linear equations that the terms T(A)_n must satisfy.

    4. It is straightforward to show that constant functions (f(x) = c) and linear functions (f(x) = ax) are digitary. This shows the dimension is at least 2.

    5. A known mathematical result, established in a paper by Dybvig and Lyons titled "The dimension of the space of digitary functions" (with a corrigendum), states that the dimension of this vector space is k+1, where k is the memory (the size of the window of digits).

    6. In this problem, the window size is k=3 (from A_n, A_{n+1}, A_{n+2}).

    7. Therefore, the dimension of the space is k + 1.

    Dimension = k + 1
    k = 3
    Dimension = 3 + 1 = 4
    """
    k = 3
    dimension = k + 1
    
    # The final equation as requested in the instructions
    print(f"Let k be the memory (window size) of the shortsighted map.")
    print(f"The map T(A)_n depends on A_n, A_(n+1), A_(n+2), so the window size k is 3.")
    print(f"The dimension of the vector space of digitary functions is given by the formula: k + 1.")
    print(f"So, the dimension is {k} + 1 = {dimension}.")
