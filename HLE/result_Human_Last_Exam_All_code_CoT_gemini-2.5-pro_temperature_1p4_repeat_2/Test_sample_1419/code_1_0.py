# The task is to find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u*
# in φ^4 theory near d=4 dimensions. This is found by solving the
# renormalization group (RG) beta function for its non-trivial fixed point.

# 1. The one-loop beta function is β(u) = -ϵu + (3u^2)/(16π²)
# 2. We set β(u*) = 0 and solve for u* ≠ 0.
#    -ϵu* + (3(u*)^2)/(16π²) = 0
#    Dividing by u* (since we seek the non-trivial solution):
#    -ϵ + 3u*/(16π²) = 0
# 3. Solving for u*:
#    3u*/(16π²) = ϵ
#    u* = (16π²/3) * ϵ

# Let's formulate the final expression using the components
