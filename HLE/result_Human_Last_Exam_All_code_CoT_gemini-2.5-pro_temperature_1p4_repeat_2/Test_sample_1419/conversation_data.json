    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step derivation and the Python code to present the final expression.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling, denoted as `u*`, for the `ϕ⁴` scalar field theory. This is done in the context of the epsilon expansion, where the spacetime dimension `d` is set to `d = 4 - ϵ`.\n2.  **Renormalization Group (RG) Framework:** In quantum field theory, the change of a coupling constant `u` with the energy scale is described by the beta function, `β(u)`. A fixed point `u*` is a value of the coupling where this change stops, i.e., where `β(u*) = 0`.\n3.  **State the Beta Function:** For the `ϕ⁴` theory in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, the one-loop beta function for the dimensionless coupling `u` is given by:\n    `β(u) = -ϵu + (3 / (16π²)) * u²`\n    The `-ϵu` term arises from the engineering dimension of the coupling, and the `u²` term is the one-loop quantum correction.\n4.  **Solve for the Fixed Point:** To find the fixed point `u*`, we solve the equation `β(u*) = 0`.\n    `-ϵu* + (3 / (16π²)) * (u*)² = 0`\n    This equation has two solutions:\n    *   `u* = 0`: The trivial Gaussian fixed point, corresponding to a free theory.\n    *   `-ϵ + (3 / (16π²)) * u* = 0`: The non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n5.  **Isolate u*:** Solving the second equation for `u*` gives the desired leading-order expression:\n    `(3 / (16π²)) * u* = ϵ`\n    `u* = (16π² / 3) * ϵ`\n6.  **Python Code:** The following Python code will print this derivation and the final expression, breaking down the numerical components as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define symbols for a clear representation\nepsilon = sympy.Symbol('ϵ')\nu_star = sympy.Symbol('u*')\npi = sympy.pi\n\n# The task is to find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u*\n# in φ^4 theory near d=4 dimensions. This is found by solving the\n# renormalization group (RG) beta function for its non-trivial fixed point.\n\n# 1. The one-loop beta function is β(u) = -ϵu + (3u^2)/(16π²)\n# 2. We set β(u*) = 0 and solve for u* ≠ 0.\n#    -ϵu* + (3(u*)^2)/(16π²) = 0\n#    Dividing by u* (since we seek the non-trivial solution):\n#    -ϵ + 3u*/(16π²) = 0\n# 3. Solving for u*:\n#    3u*/(16π²) = ϵ\n#    u* = (16π²/3) * ϵ\n\n# Let's formulate the final expression using the components\nnumerator_coeff = 16\ndenominator_coeff = 3\npi_squared_str = \"π²\"\nepsilon_str = \"ϵ\"\n\nprint(\"The leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling u* is derived from the beta function.\")\nprint(\"The one-loop β-function for φ⁴ theory in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions is:\")\nprint(f\"β(u) = -{epsilon_str}u + (3u²)/(16{pi_squared_str})\")\nprint(\"\\nSetting β(u*) = 0 and solving for the non-trivial fixed point u* gives the following result.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nHere are the components of the final equation for u*:\")\nprint(f\"The numerical coefficient in the numerator is: {numerator_coeff}\")\nprint(\"The equation includes pi squared, π², in the numerator.\")\nprint(f\"The numerical coefficient in the denominator is: {denominator_coeff}\")\nprint(f\"The expression is proportional to: {epsilon_str}\")\n\n# Print the final, fully-formed equation\nprint(\"\\nThe complete expression for the fixed point coupling is:\")\nprint(f\"u* = ({numerator_coeff}{pi_squared_str} / {denominator_coeff}) * {epsilon_str}\")\n\n```\n<<<(16*π**2 / 3) * ϵ>>>"
