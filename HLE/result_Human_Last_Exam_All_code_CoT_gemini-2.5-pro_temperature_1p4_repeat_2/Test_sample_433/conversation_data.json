    "The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for sterile compounds is determined by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), specifically in General Chapter <797>. The rules are in place to minimize the risk of microbial contamination.\n\nAn ampule is a single-dose container, meaning it does not contain antimicrobial preservatives. Once it is opened, the risk of contamination begins. The guidelines specify how long the contents may be used after being opened in a sterile environment (defined as an ISO Class 5 or cleaner primary engineering control).\n\nI will write a simple python script to state this guideline and the specific time limit.\n\n```python\ndef get_bud_for_single_dose_ampule():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule\n    according to USP <797> guidelines.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to USP <797>, the BUD for a single-dose container opened\n    # in an ISO Class 5 environment is 12 hours.\n    bud_in_hours = 12\n\n    print(\"According to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) <797> guidelines for a single-dose container (e.g., an ampule) opened in a sterile, ISO Class 5 environment:\")\n    print(\"\\nThe Beyond-Use Date (BUD) is determined from the time of puncture or opening.\")\n\n    # Display the final \"equation\" or rule\n    print(\"\\nThe final rule is:\")\n    print(f\"Time from puncture + {bud_in_hours} hours = Expiration Time\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the BUD is {bud_in_hours} hours.\")\n\nget_bud_for_single_dose_ampule()\n```\n<<<12 hours>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the BUD for a single dose container ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
