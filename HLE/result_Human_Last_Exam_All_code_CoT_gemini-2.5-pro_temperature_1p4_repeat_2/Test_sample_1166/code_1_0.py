    Analyzes the properties of functions to determine if they are necessarily Lebesgue integrable.

    A function f is Lebesgue integrable if and only if:
    1. f is measurable.
    2. The integral of the absolute value of f is finite (∫|f| dμ < ∞).

    Analysis of Choices:
    F. A continuous function on [a,b]: Is measurable. Is bounded on a compact set [a,b]. A bounded measurable function on a set of finite measure is integrable. Correct.
    L. A measurable function whose absolute value is integrable: This is the definition of a Lebesgue integrable function. Correct.
    M. A bounded continuous function on (a,b): Is measurable (since continuous) and bounded. The domain (a,b) has finite measure. A bounded measurable function on a set of finite measure is integrable. Correct.

    Other choices fail because they are not guaranteed to be measurable (e.g., just "bounded function") or the integral of their absolute value is not guaranteed to be finite (e.g., functions on ℝ or unbounded functions on finite intervals).
