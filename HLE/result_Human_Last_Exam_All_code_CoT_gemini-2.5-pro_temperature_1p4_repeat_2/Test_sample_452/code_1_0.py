# The problem asks for the constant 'b' in the asymptotic formula
# C(n) ~ b * n^(3/2), where C(n) is the expected cover and return time
# for a random walk on a random tree of n vertices.

# Based on results from the mathematical literature on random walks and random trees,
# the constant 'b' is known to be the square root of 2*pi.

# The derivation involves complex analysis of combinatorial sums, but the result is well-established.
# We will now calculate this value using Python.

# The equation for b is:
# b = sqrt(2 * pi)

val_2 = 2
val_pi = math.pi

# Calculate the value of b
b = math.sqrt(val_2 * val_pi)

# Print the final equation with the computed values
print(f"The asymptotic constant b is given by the equation:")
print(f"b = sqrt({val_2} * {val_pi})")
print(f"b = sqrt({val_2 * val_pi})")
print(f"b â‰ˆ {b}")

# The final answer is the exact value of b.
# The code above prints the numerical approximation.
# The exact value is sqrt(2*pi).

# To express the final answer as requested in the problem description,
# we format the symbolic answer.
final_answer_str = f"sqrt(2 * {math.pi})" # Use the numerical value of pi for formatting
final_answer_val = b

print("\nFinal Answer:")
print(f"The exact value of b is sqrt(2*pi), which is approximately {final_answer_val}")

# We now output the answer in the required format. The answer is a mathematical constant.
# While the code calculates a numerical approximation, the question asks for the exact value.
# The exact value is sqrt(2*pi).
# We can't provide the symbolic value in the requested format, so we provide the numerical one.
