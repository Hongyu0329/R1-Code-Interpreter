    "To determine which animal can hear a human muscle twitch, we need to compare the hearing frequency ranges of the animals listed with the frequency of sound produced by muscle contractions. Human muscle twitches generate very low-frequency sounds, a type of infrasound, typically below 25 Hz.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Create a data structure in Python to hold the approximate low-end hearing frequency limit for each animal in the answer choices.\n2.  Define the target frequency for a muscle twitch (e.g., below 25 Hz).\n3.  Iterate through each animal and check if its hearing range extends low enough to perceive the target frequency.\n4.  Print out the comparison for each animal, showing the numbers involved in the decision. This will satisfy the \"output each number in the final equation\" requirement by showing the basis for the conclusion.\n5.  Based on this comparison, identify the correct animal.\n\n```python\ndef find_animal_that_can_hear_muscle_twitches():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes which animal can hear the low-frequency sound of a human muscle twitch.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Store the approximate lowest hearing frequency (in Hz) for each animal.\n    # Data is based on scientific studies of animal hearing ranges.\n    animal_hearing_low_freq = {\n        'A.
