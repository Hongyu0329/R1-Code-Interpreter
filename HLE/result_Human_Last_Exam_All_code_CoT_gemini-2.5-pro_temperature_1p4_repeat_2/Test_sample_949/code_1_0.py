    Solves the parenthesis string property questions.

    This function determines the truth value for each of the 6 statements.
    My analysis, detailed in the thought process, leads to the following conclusions:

    1. sum(log L(x)) = O(sum(log D(x))): False. A "comb" structure provides a counterexample where the LHS grows as O(n) and the RHS is O(1).
    2. sum(loglog L(x)) = O(sum(loglog D(x))): False. The same "comb" counterexample applies, assuming sums over well-defined terms.
    3. sum(log^5 L(x)) = O(sum(log^5 D(x))): False. Same counterexample.
    4. sum(2^sqrt(log L(x))) = sum(2^O(sqrt(log D(x)))): False. Same counterexample.
    5. sum(L(x)^0.1) = O(sum(D(x)^0.11)): True. The larger exponent on the RHS (D) appears to be sufficient to bound the LHS for all tree structures.
    6. sum(L(x)^0.25) = O(sum(D(x)^0.5)): True. Same reasoning as statement 5.

    The final answer string is a concatenation of these findings (T for True, F for False).
