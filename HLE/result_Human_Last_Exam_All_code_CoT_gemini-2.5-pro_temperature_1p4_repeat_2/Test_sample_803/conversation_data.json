    "This problem is a question of group theory classification, which can be solved by applying known theorems. Here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the properties of the group G:** The group $G$ has order $2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m$ is a natural number. By Burnside's $p^a q^b$ theorem, any group of this order is solvable. The question asks for *nonabelian* groups of this order.\n2.  **Find the relevant theorem:** The concept of a \"filled group\" is specific. The primary source for this is the paper \"Filled groups\" by G. Garonzi, A. Lucchini, and D. Nemmi (2022). Since $G$ is a nonabelian solvable group, we can use their classification theorem for such groups.\n3.  **Apply the theorem:** The theorem states that a nonabelian solvable group $G$ is filled if and only if:\n    a. The quotient group $G/F(G)$ is cyclic, where $F(G)$ is the Fitting subgroup of $G$.\n    b. The quotient group $V = F(G)/\\Phi(G)$ is an irreducible and faithful $G/F(G)$-module, where $\\Phi(G)$ is the Frattini subgroup of $G$.\n4.  **Analyze the structure of G:**\n    *   A group of order $2q^m$ has a normal Sylow $q$-subgroup, let's call it $P$. $P$ is a $q$-group and is therefore nilpotent.\n    *   Since $P$ is a normal nilpotent subgroup, it is contained in the Fitting subgroup $F(G)$.\n    *   If the Sylow 2-subgroup were also normal, $G$ would be a nilpotent group. For a nonabelian nilpotent group to be filled, the order of $G/\\Phi(G)$ must be a prime. For a group of order $2q^m$, this is not possible. Thus, the Sylow 2-subgroup is not normal.\n    *   This implies $G$ is a semidirect product $G = P \\rtimes Z_2$, and the Fitting subgroup is exactly $P$, so $F(G) = P$.\n5.  **Check the theorem's conditions:**\n    a. **Condition 1:** $G/F(G) = G/P \\cong Z_2$. The group $Z_2$ is cyclic. This condition is satisfied.\n    b. **Condition 2:** $V = F(G)/\\Phi(F(G)) = P/\\Phi(P)$ must be an irreducible and faithful $G/F(G) \\cong Z_2$-module. The action is conjugation.\n6.  **Deduce the structure of P:**\n    *   $V = P/\\Phi(P)$ is an elementary abelian $q$-group, which can be seen as a vector space over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n    *   The action of the non-identity element of $Z_2$ on this vector space corresponds to an automorphism $\\sigma$ such that $\\sigma^2=I$ and $\\sigma \\neq I$.\n    *   For $V$ to be an irreducible module over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ (with $q$ odd), it must be 1-dimensional. This implies that $P/\\Phi(P)$ is a cyclic group of order $q$.\n    *   A $q$-group $P$ for which $P/\\Phi(P)$ is cyclic of order $q$ must itself be a cyclic group. So, $P \\cong Z_{q^m}$.\n7.  **Identify the group G:**\n    *   $G$ must be a nonabelian semidirect product of $Z_{q^m}$ by $Z_2$. There is only one such group up to isomorphism: the dihedral group $D_{2q^m}$.\n    *   The group presentation for $D_{2n}$ is $\\langle r, s \\mid r^n=1, s^2=1, srs^{-1}=r^{-1} \\rangle$. For $n=q^m$, this defines the group structure.\n    *   This group satisfies all the conditions. The action of $s$ on the generator $r$ is inversion, which corresponds to the action on the module $P/\\Phi(P)$ being multiplication by -1, which makes it a faithful and irreducible 1-dimensional module.\n\nThis derivation concludes that the only nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ are the dihedral groups of that order. The following Python code prints this result.\n\n```python\ndef find_filled_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents the solution to the user's group theory question.\n    The problem is to identify all nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m,\n    where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number.\n\n    The solution is derived from the classification of solvable filled groups.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    q = \"q\"\n    m = \"m\"\n    n = f\"{q}^{m}\"\n\n    answer = f\"\"\"\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order 2{q}^{m} for an odd prime {q} and natural number {m} are the dihedral groups of order 2{q}^{m}.\n\nThis family of groups is denoted by D_{{2{n}}}.\n\nThe presentation of the dihedral group D_{{2n}} (in this case, n = {n}) is given by two generators, r (rotation) and s (reflection), and the following relations (equations):\n\n1. r^{n} = 1\n2. s^2 = 1\n3. srs⁻¹ = r⁻¹\n\nSubstituting n = {n}, the specific relations are:\n\nr^({n}) = 1\ns^2 = 1\nsrs⁻¹ = r⁻¹\n\"\"\"\n    print(answer)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_filled_groups()\n\n```\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and a natural number m are the dihedral groups D_{2q^m}.>>>"
