The nonabelian filled groups of order 2{q}^{m} for an odd prime {q} and natural number {m} are the dihedral groups of order 2{q}^{m}.

This family of groups is denoted by D_{{2{n}}}.

The presentation of the dihedral group D_{{2n}} (in this case, n = {n}) is given by two generators, r (rotation) and s (reflection), and the following relations (equations):

1. r^{n} = 1
2. s^2 = 1
3. srs⁻¹ = r⁻¹

Substituting n = {n}, the specific relations are:

r^({n}) = 1
s^2 = 1
srs⁻¹ = r⁻¹
