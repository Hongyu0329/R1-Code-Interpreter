    "To find the first Academy Award for Best Picture winner that depicts a Luxor Obelisk, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Locations:** First, determine the real-world locations of the Luxor Obelisks. There are two: one in Luxor, Egypt, and one in Paris, France (at the Place de la Concorde).\n2.  **Chronological Search:** Review the list of Best Picture winners chronologically. The search will focus on films set in either Egypt or Paris.\n3.  **Analyze Candidates:** Examine the likely candidates. No Best Picture winner has been set in Luxor. The search narrows to films set in Paris that might feature the famous Place de la Concorde.\n4.  **Pinpoint the Winner:** The first film on the list confirmed to show the obelisk will be the answer. Key Paris-set winners include *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), *An American in Paris* (1951), and *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956). Analysis shows *An American in Paris* is the earliest confirmed film to feature the landmark.\n\nThe following Python script will execute this plan and print the detailed reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_movie_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script outlines the reasoning to find the first Best Picture winner\n    to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying the locations of the two Luxor Obelisks.\")\n    print(\"- One obelisk stands at the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\")\n    print(\"- The second stands at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Searching for Best Picture winners set in these locations.\")\n    print(\"A chronological review of Best Picture winners shows no films set at the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the search focuses on the first winner to depict the obelisk in Paris.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyzing Paris-set Best Picture winners in chronological order.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nCandidate 1: 'The Life of Emile Zola' (Winner for 1937)\")\n    print(\"  - Analysis: This film is set in Paris but was primarily filmed on studio backlots.\")\n    print(\"  - Verdict: An on-screen depiction of the Place de la Concorde is unconfirmed and unlikely.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nCandidate 2: 'An American in Paris' (Winner for 1951)\")\n    print(\"  - Analysis: This musical is a celebration of Paris.
