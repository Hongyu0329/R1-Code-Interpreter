    # The problem asks for the minimum number of diffraction gratings to construct a
    # full spectral volume (3D space + energy) from a single 2D image using computed tomography.

    # This advanced technique requires encoding information from multiple angles (for tomography)
    # and multiple energies (for spectral data) onto a single detector.

    # Grating-based X-ray interferometry is the relevant technique. The most robust and
    # common setup for this, especially when using standard laboratory X-ray sources,
    # is the Talbot-Lau interferometer.

    # The Talbot-Lau interferometer requires a specific number of gratings, each with a
    # critical role, making it the necessary foundation for such a system.

    # Grating 1 (G0 - Source Grating):
    # Its purpose is to create spatial coherence. A standard X-ray source is incoherent.
    # G0 is placed after the source to create an array of individually coherent virtual
    # sources, which is essential for the interferometry to work.
    grating_G0 = 1

    # Grating 2 (G1 - Phase Grating):
    # This grating impresses a periodic phase shift onto the X-ray wavefront,
    # which generates a complex interference pattern downstream known as the Talbot carpet.
    grating_G1 = 1

    # Grating 3 (G2 - Analyzer Grating):
    # This absorption grating is placed just before the detector. The interference pattern
    # is too fine for the detector pixels to resolve directly. G2 samples this pattern,
    # converting tiny shifts caused by the object into measurable intensity variations.
    grating_G2 = 1

    # The total number of gratings is the sum of these essential components.
    # While systems with 1 or 2 gratings exist, they require highly specialized sources
    # (like a synchrotron or microfocus tube). For a practical system using a
    # conventional source, all three are necessary.
