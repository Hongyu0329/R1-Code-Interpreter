    "The user is asking a knowledge-based question about the hardware requirements for an advanced imaging technique. My plan is to provide a Python script that explains the reasoning and prints the final answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Problem:** The goal is to reconstruct a \"full spectral volume\" (a 4D dataset: 3D space + 1D energy) from a \"single image\" (a 2D dataset) using \"computed tomography\" and \"diffraction gratings\". This is a highly advanced imaging problem that requires multiplexing a massive amount of information onto a single detector plane.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Computed Tomography (CT):** Requires information from multiple viewing angles to reconstruct a 3D object.\n    *   **Spectral Imaging:** Requires dispersing the X-ray beam into its constituent energies. A diffraction grating can perform this task.\n    *   **\"Single Image\":** This constraint implies that information from all angles and all energies must be encoded and captured in a single snapshot.\n    *   **Practicality with X-ray Sources:** Standard laboratory X-ray sources have a relatively large focal spot and are not spatially coherent. Advanced imaging techniques like interferometry need to account for this.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Plausible Setups:**\n    *   A system needs components to encode both angular (for tomography) and spectral information.\n    *   A single grating can encode spectral information but not angular information.\n    *   A two-grating system could potentially be designed to encode both, but it would require a special X-ray source (a \"microfocus\" source) to provide the necessary spatial coherence.\n    *   A three-grating system, known as a **Talbot-Lau interferometer**, is a well-established and robust design for X-ray phase-contrast imaging that works with standard, incoherent laboratory sources.\n\n4.  **The Talbot-Lau Interferometer (3 Gratings):** This setup is the key to the answer. It requires a specific number of gratings, each with a critical function:\n    *   **G0 (Source Grating):** Placed right after the conventional X-ray tube. It effectively splits the large source into an array of small, individually coherent line sources. This is *necessary* to perform interferometry with a standard source.\n    *   **G1 (Phase Grating):** A phase-shifting grating that creates a complex interference pattern downstream. The object to be imaged is placed in this pattern.\n    *   **G2 (Analyzer Grating):** An absorption grating placed directly in front of the detector. It analyzes the interference pattern, which is too fine for the detector to resolve directly, and translates its distortions into measurable intensity signals.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** While the standard Talbot-Lau interferometer is used for phase-contrast CT (requiring object rotation) and not explicitly for \"single-shot spectral CT\", it represents the minimum necessary hardware foundation to perform this kind of advanced interferometry with a practical, conventional X-ray source. The requirement of a source grating (G0) to make the system work under normal lab conditions makes **3** the minimum number of gratings necessary for a robust implementation. Fewer gratings would necessitate highly specialized and less common sources (like a synchrotron or microfocus tube), which is not a general solution. Therefore, the minimum necessary number for a practical system is 3.\n\n```python\ndef solve_grating_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the reasoning to determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings\n    for single-shot spectral computed tomography.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The problem asks for the minimum number of diffraction gratings to construct a\n    # full spectral volume (3D space + energy) from a single 2D image using computed tomography.\n\n    # This advanced technique requires encoding information from multiple angles (for tomography)\n    # and multiple energies (for spectral data) onto a single detector.\n\n    # Grating-based X-ray interferometry is the relevant technique.
