def find_nullified_propositions():
    """
    This function identifies and lists the San Francisco November 2024 propositions
    that could be nullified by other propositions on the same ballot.

    Based on the official Voter Information Pamphlet:
    - Proposition K (Real Property Transfer Tax) is a competing measure with Propositions C and J.
      If Prop K passes but Prop C or Prop J passes with more 'yes' votes, Prop K is nullified.
    - Proposition L (Transportation Sales Tax) and Proposition M (Transportation Sales Tax) are
      competing measures. If both pass, the one with fewer 'yes' votes is nullified.

    Therefore, the propositions that could be nullified are K, L, and M.
