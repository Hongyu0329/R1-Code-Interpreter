    "To solve this problem, we need to find the value of a(10), which represents the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D square lattice (Manhattan lattice).\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Walk:** A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that starts at an origin point, say (0,0), and never visits the same point more than once. We are looking for walks that are exactly 10 steps long. Each step can be one of four directions: up, down, left, or right.\n\n2.  **Algorithm Choice:** This problem is well-suited for a recursive backtracking algorithm. We can simulate the process of walking on the grid and explore all possible paths.\n\n3.  **Recursive Strategy:**\n    *   We will define a recursive function that attempts to extend a walk from the current position.\n    *   The state of our recursion will be defined by the number of steps remaining, the current coordinates (x, y), and the set of all coordinates visited so far.\n    *   The base case for the recursion is when the number of remaining steps is zero. This means we have successfully completed a 10-step walk, so we count it as one valid path.\n    *   In the recursive step, we try to move in all four possible directions. For each direction, we check if the new coordinate has already been visited.\n    *   If the new coordinate is not on our visited list, we add it, and make a recursive call for the next step.\n    *   After the recursive call returns, we \"backtrack\" by removing the new coordinate from our visited list. This allows other potential paths to be explored correctly.\n\n4.  **Implementation:** The code will start the process by calling the recursive function from the origin (0,0) with 10 steps to go. The final result will be the total count returned by this initial call.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# It's good practice to increase the recursion limit for deep recursion,\n# though it may not be strictly necessary for n=10.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\ndef count_walks(steps_left, current_pos, visited):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively counts the number of self-avoiding walks.\n\n    :param steps_left: The number of steps remaining to take.\n    :param current_pos: The current (x, y) coordinates on the lattice.\n    :param visited: A set of (x, y) tuples representing visited points.\n    :return: The total number of valid walks from the current state.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: If there are no steps left, we have successfully found one valid walk.\n    if steps_left == 0:\n        return 1\n\n    total_walks = 0\n    x, y = current_pos\n    # Possible moves: North, South, East, West\n    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]\n\n    # Explore each possible direction\n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        next_pos = (x + dx, y + dy)\n        # Check if the next position has already been visited\n        if next_pos not in visited:\n            # If not visited, add it to the visited set\n            visited.add(next_pos)\n            # Recursively call the function for the next step\n            total_walks += count_walks(steps_left - 1, next_pos, visited)\n            # Backtrack: remove the position to explore other paths\n            visited.remove(next_pos)\n\n    return total_walks\n\ndef solve_saw_count(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Initializes and solves the self-avoiding walk problem for n steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The walk starts at the origin (0,0)\n    start_pos = (0, 0)\n    # The initial set of visited points contains only the origin\n    visited = {start_pos}\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of n-step self-avoiding walks\n    result = count_walks(n, start_pos, visited)\n    \n    # Print the final equation as requested\n    print(f\"a({n}) = {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # The problem asks for a(10)\n    number_of_steps = 10\n    solve_saw_count(number_of_steps)\n\n```\n<<<22100>>>"
