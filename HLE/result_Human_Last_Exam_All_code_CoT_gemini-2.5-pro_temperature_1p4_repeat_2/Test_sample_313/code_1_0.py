    print("1. The combination of these two letter clusters ('ggj' and 'skt') is highly unique.")
    print("2. The 'skt' cluster is found in Maltese, largely due to significant vocabulary influence from Sicilian and Italian.")
    print("3. The 'ggj' cluster, though very rare globally, is a known distinctive feature of Maltese. Such clusters can arise from its Semitic grammatical structure (using roots and patterns) being written with a Latin-based alphabet.")
    print("4. Maltese is the official language of Malta, and this unique blend of Semitic grammar and Romance vocabulary makes it the sole candidate fitting both clues.")
