    "My plan is to solve this by first identifying the geometric shape of the \"outer-hull of the great icosahedron\". This shape is a regular icosahedron, as its vertices coincide with those of the great icosahedron. The problem then becomes finding the number of triangular faces of a regular icosahedron. I will use Euler's polyhedron formula, V - E + F = 2, to determine the number of faces (F). For a regular icosahedron, the number of vertices (V) is 12 and the number of edges (E) is 30. The Python code will define these values, calculate F, and then print the final equation with all the numbers to show the result.\n\n```python\n# The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n# We need to find the number of its faces (F), which are all triangles.\n# We use Euler's formula for polyhedra: V - E + F = 2\n# For a regular icosahedron:\n# Number of vertices (V)\nV = 12\n# Number of edges (E)\nE = 30\n\n# Solve for F: F = 2 - V + E\nF = 2 - V + E\n\nprint(\"The outer-hull is a regular icosahedron. We find its number of faces (F) using Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2.\")\nprint(f\"For an icosahedron, V = {V} and E = {E}.\")\nprint(\"The equation with the final number of faces is:\")\nprint(f\"{V} - {E} + {F} = 2\")\nprint(f\"\\nThus, the minimal number of triangles needed is {F}.\")\n```\n<<<20>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
