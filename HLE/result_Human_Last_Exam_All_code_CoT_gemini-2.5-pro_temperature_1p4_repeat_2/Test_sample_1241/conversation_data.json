    "To solve this problem, we need to find the steady-state probabilities of the system, which are the values of $P_i(t)$ as $t \\to +\\infty$. Let's denote these steady-state probabilities as $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\nIn the steady state, the probabilities no longer change with time, so all time derivatives are zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$. This transforms the given system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given system. The second equation, $P_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$, appears to contain a typo. In the standard Kolmogorov-Chepmen equations, the rate of flow of probability *into* a state is positive. The term $-\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$ would represent a negative flow from state 0 to state 1, which is physically incorrect. The flow from state 0 to state 1 should correspond to a positive term $+\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$ in the equation for $P_1'(t)$, balanced by the negative term $-\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$ in the equation for $P_0'(t)$. Assuming this is a typo, we will proceed with the corrected second equation:\n$P_{1}'(t) = +\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n\nSetting all derivatives to zero, we get the following system of linear equations:\n1. $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n2. $0 = \\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n3. $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n4. $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n\nAdditionally, the sum of all probabilities must equal 1:\n5. $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\nThis gives us a system of five equations for four unknowns ($p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3$). One of the first four equations is redundant. We can solve this system by creating a matrix equation $A \\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{b}$ using three of the first four equations and the normalization equation.\n\nHere is the plan for the Python code:\n1. Define the given transition rates $\\lambda_{ij}$.\n2. Construct the matrix `A` and vector `b` for the linear system.\n3. Solve the system for the probability vector `p` = $[p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3]$.\n4. Calculate the desired sum $p_0 + p_1$.\n5. Print the values of $p_0$, $p_1$, and their sum clearly.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the given transition rates\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# We need to solve a system of linear equations for the steady-state probabilities p_i.\n# The equations are:\n# 1) -lambda_01*p0 + lambda_10*p1 = 0\n# 2) lambda_12*p1 - (lambda_21 + lambda_23)*p2 = 0\n# 3) lambda_23*p2 - lambda_31*p3 = 0\n# 4) p0 + p1 + p2 + p3 = 1\n# This can be written in matrix form A*p = b\n\n# Set up the coefficient matrix A\nA = np.array([\n    [-lambda_01, lambda_10, 0, 0],\n    [0, lambda_12, -(lambda_21 + lambda_23), 0],\n    [0, 0, lambda_23, -lambda_31],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n])\n\n# Set up the result vector b\nb = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])\n\n# Solve the system of linear equations A*p = b for p\ntry:\n    p = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\n    p0, p1, p2, p3 = p[0], p[1], p[2], p[3]\n    \n    # Calculate the required sum\n    sum_p0_p1 = p0 + p1\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(\"The steady-state probabilities are:\")\n    print(f\"P0(inf) = {p0:.6f}\")\n    print(f\"P1(inf) = {p1:.6f}\")\n    print(f\"P2(inf) = {p2:.6f}\")\n    print(f\"P3(inf) = {p3:.6f}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe problem is to find the value of P0(inf) + P1(inf).\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"P0(inf) + P1(inf) = {p0:.6f} + {p1:.6f} = {sum_p0_p1:.6f}\")\n\nexcept np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n    print(\"The system of equations has no unique solution.\")\n\n```\n<<<0.946252>>>"
