    # Analysis:
    # A "True Avalanche" repeats a syllable pattern. The keyword is "computer",
    # so we're looking for a phrase that mimics the syllables "com-pu-ter".
    # The description is about software telling birds where to go.

    # Choice A: "comp few urns" does not sound like "computer". Fails syllable test.
    # Choice B: "Come poo, tern" sounds very similar to "com-pu-ter".
    #           The meaning also fits: The 'Computer' tells a 'tern' (a type of bird) to 'poo'. This is a perfect match.
    # Choice C: "Come, pee you turkey" does not sound like "computer". Fails syllable test.
    # Choice D: "Comb pewter" sounds like "computer", so it is a True Avalanche. However, the meaning has nothing
    #           to do with the description. Fails meaning test.
    # Choice E: This is just a sentence, not an avalanche. Fails syllable test.
