    This function determines the maximum integer k for which k-matchings can be counted in subcubic time.
    
    Based on fine-grained complexity theory:
    - The best algorithm for counting 4-matchings runs in O(n^2.985), which is subcubic.
    - Counting 5-matchings is believed to require at least n^(3-o(1)) time, due to reductions from problems like the All-Pairs Shortest Path (APSP) problem.
    
    Therefore, the maximum k for which a subcubic algorithm is known to exist is 4.
