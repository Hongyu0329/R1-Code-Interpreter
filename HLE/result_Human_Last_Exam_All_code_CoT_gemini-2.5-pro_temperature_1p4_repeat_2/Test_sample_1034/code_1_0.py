# Step 1: Define the value of S.
# Based on the problem's likely source (a multi-stage puzzle), S represents
# the order of admission of South Dakota into the United States.
S = 40

# In the triangle, side BC is given as S.
BC = S

# Step 2: Define the condition for two possible triangles.
# For the "ambiguous case" (SSA) in a triangle with angle B = 30 degrees,
# there are two possible values for side AB if and only if the length
# of side AC is in the open interval (BC/2, BC).
lower_bound = BC / 2
upper_bound = BC

# Step 3: Count the number of integers in this interval.
# The integers are from floor(lower_bound) + 1 to ceil(upper_bound) - 1.
# For S=40, this means integers from floor(20) + 1 = 21 to ceil(40) - 1 = 39.
# The count can be found with the formula: floor((S - 1) / 2)
count = math.floor((S - 1) / 2)

# Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final equation as requested.
