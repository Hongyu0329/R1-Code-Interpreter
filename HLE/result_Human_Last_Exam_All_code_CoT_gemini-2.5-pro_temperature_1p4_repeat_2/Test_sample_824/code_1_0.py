    print("Clinical Analysis:")
    print("1. The patient's constellation of symptoms (facial rash, joint pain, fever, hematuria) strongly suggests an underlying autoimmune disease, most likely Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).")
    print("2. The abrupt cessation of corticosteroid treatment likely triggered a severe rebound flare of her SLE.")
    print("3. This flare manifested as rapidly progressive lupus nephritis, leading to end-stage kidney disease.")
    print("\nIdentifying the Best Lab Indicator:")
    print("To find the cause of the renal decline, we need a marker that reflects the activity of the autoimmune attack on the kidneys.")
    print("- A rise in serum creatinine would show the kidneys are failing, but not why.")
    print("- Low complement levels (C3/C4) would indicate immune complex consumption and high disease activity.")
    print("- A significant rise in Anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody levels is highly specific for an SLE flare and correlates strongly with lupus nephritis activity.")
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("A sharp increase in anti-dsDNA antibody levels would be the most direct and specific indicator for the cause of the rapid renal function decline, as it measures the pathogenic antibodies responsible for the attack.")
