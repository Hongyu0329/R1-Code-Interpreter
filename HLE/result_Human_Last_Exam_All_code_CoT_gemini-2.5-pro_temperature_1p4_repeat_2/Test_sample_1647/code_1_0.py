# Bagua Computing Architecture Specification Analysis

def solve_pioneer_probe_problem():
    """
    Calculates the gravitational time dilation factor (f) and the memory usage (z)
    for the most memory-efficient Bagua C program.

    # 1. Define the constants based on the problem description and analysis.
    # The Schwarzschild Radius (Rs) of Pegasi is calculated to be ~184 m.
    Rs = 184  # meters

    # The probe's distance from the event horizon is 13 km.
    d = 13000  # meters

    # The total distance from the center of the black hole (r) is Rs + d.
    r = Rs + d

    # 2. Calculate the time dilation factor 'f' using the binomial approximation.
    # The Bagua architecture lacks a sqrt function for its `frac` type,
    # so we must use the approximation: f â‰ˆ 1 + Rs / (2 * r).
    time_dilation_factor = 1 + Rs / (2 * r)

    # 3. Determine the memory usage 'z' for the most efficient program.
    # The most memory-efficient C program would perform the calculation using a
    # single pre-simplified frac variable: `frac f = 1 + 23/3296;`
    # The memory usage is the size of one `frac` variable.
    # frac size = sizeof(signed char) + sizeof(unsigned wchar) + sizeof(signed char)
    size_n_trits = 2  # for numerator 'n'
    size_d_trits = 4  # for denominator 'd'
    size_e_trits = 2  # for exponent 'e'
    memory_usage_trits = size_n_trits + size_d_trits + size_e_trits

    # 4. Print the final answer in the format f:z.
    # 'f' is rounded to 0.001 as requested.
    # The print statement below uses the calculated numbers to form the final "equation" or output string.
    print(f"{time_dilation_factor:.3f}:{memory_usage_trits}")
