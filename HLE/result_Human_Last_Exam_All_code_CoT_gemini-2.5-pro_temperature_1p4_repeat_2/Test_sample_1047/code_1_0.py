    Analyzes the conflict of interest scenario and prints the correct answer.

    The analysis focuses on the following points:
    1.  A law firm (NC LLP) has a duty of confidentiality to its former client (Advanced Tech Inc.).
    2.  The firm possesses confidential information from the former client that is highly relevant to the new matter (representing Six Wings Inc. in its acquisition of Advanced Tech Inc.). This creates a conflict of interest.
    3.  In such a conflict, the firm cannot act against the former client's interests without the former client's informed consent.
    4.  The problem states that the former client (Advanced Tech Inc.) will not provide consent.
    5.  Therefore, NC LLP is prohibited from representing Six Wings Inc. in this matter. This corresponds to answer choice D.
    """

    correct_choice = 'D'

    explanation = "Norman and NC LLP are not allowed to continue to represent Six Wings Inc. because, when a conflict exists, the party prejudiced by the conflicted lawyer acting must consent to this lawyer acting for such lawyer to continue representing a party to the matter."
