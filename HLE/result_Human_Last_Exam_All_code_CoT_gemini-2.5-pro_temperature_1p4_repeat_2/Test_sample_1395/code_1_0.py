# Step 1: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian subgraph before the Soviet dissolution.
# The graph of sovereign nations is planar. By the Four-Color Theorem and the map's complexity, the chromatic number is 4.
chi_before_dissolution = 4
print(f"Chromatic number of the Asian graph before Soviet dissolution = {chi_before_dissolution}")

# Step 2: Determine the chromatic number after the Soviet dissolution.
# The dissolution created new countries but did not change the graph's planarity or reduce its overall complexity. The chromatic number remains 4.
chi_after_dissolution = 4
print(f"Chromatic number of the Asian graph after Soviet dissolution = {chi_after_dissolution}")

# Step 3: Calculate the incremental change in the chromatic number, delta_soviet.
delta_soviet = chi_after_dissolution - chi_before_dissolution
print(f"The incremental change, delta_soviet = {chi_after_dissolution} - {chi_before_dissolution} = {delta_soviet}")

# Step 4: Determine if the planarity of the graph changed.
# A graph of bordering countries on a map is inherently planar. This property did not change.
planarity_changed = False
print(f"Did the planarity of the Asian country graph change? {planarity_changed}")

# Step 5: Assign the value to beta based on the change in planarity.
# If planarity did not change, beta is 1. If it did, beta is 2.
beta = 1 if not planarity_changed else 2
print(f"As planarity did not change, beta = {beta}")

# Step 6: Calculate the final answer.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"Final Answer: beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}")
