    "My plan is to determine the symmetry point group of the molecule using a computational approach. First, I will use the `rdkit` library to interpret the provided SMILES string and generate an initial 3D structure. Since the initial structure might not be in its most stable or symmetric form, I will then perform a geometry optimization using the MMFF94 force field, also within `rdkit`. Once I have the optimized 3D coordinates of all atoms (including hydrogens), I will pass this information to the `pyscf` library. `pyscf` has a robust algorithm that can analyze the geometry and identify all present symmetry elements to assign the correct point group. Finally, the script will print the identified point group.\n\n```python\nimport sys\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import AllChem\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"RDKit library not found.
