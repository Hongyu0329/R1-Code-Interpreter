    Step-by-step analysis of the DisjointCycles problem complexity:

    1. Understanding the Problem's Structure:
    The problem asks for 'k' vertex-disjoint subgraphs, a common pattern in parameterized complexity.
    A crucial detail is that the property of each subgraph (cycle length >= k) depends on the parameter 'k'.
    This dependency often makes problems harder than when the subgraph structure is fixed. For example, finding 'k' disjoint triangles (cycles of a fixed length 3) is W[1]-complete, whereas finding 'k' disjoint cycles of any length is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT).

    2. Complexity on General Graphs:
    For general graphs, the problem is W[1]-hard. This is a known result in parameterized complexity literature (e.g., confirmed in the paper "Disjoint Cycles of Length at least k" by K. S. Klein, 2021).
    The intuition for this hardness comes from its similarity to other W[1]-hard problems like k-Clique. A reduction from a canonical W[1]-hard problem would typically involve constructing gadgets that can form long cycles, where the constraints of the original problem (like clique edges) are encoded as either allowing or preventing these cycles from being formed disjointly. The interaction between the 'k' different cycle constructions is what makes the problem hard.
    This W[1]-hardness result means that an algorithm with a running time of f(k) * poly(|V|) is unlikely to exist for general graphs, assuming FPT != W[1]. This rules out option A.

    3. Complexity on Planar Graphs:
    When the input graph G is restricted to be planar, the problem becomes fixed-parameter tractable (FPT).
    This is a common phenomenon for graph problems. FPT algorithms for planar graphs often use a dichotomy based on treewidth:
    - Case 1: The treewidth of the graph is small (bounded by a function of k). In this case, dynamic programming over a tree decomposition can solve the problem in FPT time. The DP state would need to track the formation of up to k partial cycles and their lengths (capped at k).
    - Case 2: The treewidth is large. For planar graphs (and more generally, graphs excluding a fixed minor), large treewidth implies the existence of a large grid-like structure as a subgraph (or minor). This grid structure is so rich and interconnected that one can usually prove that the desired k long cycles can always be constructed.
    Thus, the overall algorithm is: if treewidth is large, answer YES; otherwise, use the FPT algorithm for bounded-treewidth graphs. This approach establishes that the problem is FPT on planar graphs. This is confirmed by recent research (e.g., the paper "On the complexity of finding long disjoint cycles" by Agrawal, Saurabh, and Zeh, 2018, and the aforementioned Klein paper).

    4. Evaluating the Answer Choices:
    - A. DisjointCycles is fixed-parameter tractable. (False, it's W[1]-hard on general graphs).
    - B. DisjointCycles is fixed-parameter tractable on planar graphs, but W[1]-complete on general graphs. (True, this matches our analysis).
    - C. DisjointCycles is W[2]-complete. (False, the problem structure fits W[1] better, and it is indeed known to be W[1]-hard).
    - D. DisjointCycles is coNP-hard. (False, the problem is in NP, so this would imply NP=coNP).
    - E. DisjointCycles is fixed-parameter tractable on graphs of bounded degree, but W[1]-complete on general graphs. (While the second part is true, the first part is less certain and a weaker statement than FPT on planar graphs. Bounded degree graphs can have arbitrarily large treewidth, and the standard FPT techniques for planar graphs do not directly apply. Statement B is more accurate and directly supported by literature).

    Conclusion: The correct statement is B.
