# Step 1 & 2: Analysis of the Greek passages.
# In Passage 1, the word "εἶμαι" is the first-person singular present indicative of the verb "to be".
# The correct Classical Attic form is "εἰμί". The form "εἶμαι" becomes standard in Koine and later Demotic Greek.
# So, W1 = "εἶμαι", C1 = "εἰμί", P1 = "KoineDemotic".

# In Passage 2, the word "ὄρνιθα" is the accusative singular of "ὄρνις" (bird).
# While this form is found in later Greek, its most prominent non-Classical origin is Homeric Greek.
# The standard Classical Attic form is "ὄρνιν".
# So, W2 = "ὄρνιθα", C2 = "ὄρνιν", P2 = "Homeric".

# Step 3: Assign the identified values to variables.
W1 = "εἶμαι"
C1 = "εἰμί"
P1 = "KoineDemotic"

W2 = "ὄρνιθα"
C2 = "ὄρνιν"
P2 = "Homeric"

# Step 4: Format and print the final answer string.
final_answer = f"{W1},{C1},{P1},{W2},{C2},{P2}"
print(final_answer)
<<<εἶμαι,εἰμί,KoineDemotic,ὄρνιθα,ὄρνιν,Homeric>>>
