    "In many-body physics, the bare Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, represents the propagator of a single, non-interacting particle through a system. The question asks for its functional dependence on the energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, of the single-particle states (where $k$ represents the quantum numbers, like momentum, of the state).\n\nThis relationship is most clearly expressed in the frequency-momentum (or frequency-eigenstate) representation. The time-ordered bare Green's function at zero temperature is given by the following formula:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\delta \\text{ sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nHere is a breakdown of the terms:\n*   $G_0(k, \\omega)$: The Green's function for a particle in state $k$ at frequency $\\omega$.\n*   $\\omega$: The frequency, which corresponds to the energy of the particle being added to or removed from the system.\n*   $\\epsilon_k$: This is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for the state $k$. The dependence of $G_0$ on $\\epsilon_k$ is the core of your question.\n*   $\\mu$: The chemical potential, which defines the Fermi level (the energy that separates occupied from unoccupied states at zero temperature).\n*   $\\delta$: A small positive infinitesimal number ($ \\delta \\to 0^+$).\n*   $i\\delta \\text{ sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)$: This crucial imaginary term ensures causality. The sign function, `sgn`, makes the term positive if the state $k$ is unoccupied ($\\epsilon_k > \\mu$) and negative if it's occupied ($\\epsilon_k < \\mu$). This shifts the pole of the function slightly off the real axis and into the complex plane, which is essential for calculations.\n\nThe formula shows that the Green's function has a pole (i.e., its value diverges) when the denominator is zero. This occurs when the probe energy $\\omega$ is equal to the particle's energy relative to the chemical potential, $\\epsilon_k - \\mu$. Therefore, the functional dependence is an inverse relationship with respect to the energy difference $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the value of $G_0$ for a given set of parameters and prints the final equation with all the numbers substituted in, demonstrating this relationship.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# --- Parameters ---\n# omega: Frequency (energy of the probe particle) in arbitrary energy units\nomega = 2.0\n# epsilon_k: Single-particle energy eigenvalue in the same energy units\nepsilon_k = 1.5\n# mu: Chemical potential in the same energy units\nmu = 0.5\n# delta: Small positive infinitesimal for causality. We use a small number for the calculation.\ndelta = 0.1\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n# The energy of the state relative to the chemical potential\nxi_k = epsilon_k - mu\n\n# Determine the sign of the imaginary term.\n# The term is +1 for states above the Fermi level (unoccupied) and -1 for states below (occupied).\nsign_xi_k = np.sign(xi_k)\n# Handle the case where the state is exactly at the Fermi level\nif sign_xi_k == 0:\n    sign_xi_k = 1 # By convention, treat as unoccupied\n\n# The complex denominator of the Green's function\ndenominator = (omega - xi_k) + 1j * delta * sign_xi_k\n\n# The bare Green's function G_0\nG0 = 1 / denominator\n\n# --- Output the final equation with numbers ---\nprint(\"The functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy epsilon_k is given by:\")\nprint(\"G_0(k, omega) = 1 / (omega - (epsilon_k - mu) + i*delta*sgn(epsilon_k - mu))\")\nprint(\"\\nFor the given values:\")\nprint(f\"omega = {omega}\")\nprint(f\"epsilon_k = {epsilon_k}\")\nprint(f\"mu = {mu}\")\nprint(f\"delta = {delta}\\n\")\n\n# Reconstruct the equation string with the numerical values\nimag_part_sign = \"+\" if sign_xi_k > 0 else \"-\"\nprint(\"The final equation with these values is:\")\nprint(f\"G_0 = 1 / ( {omega} - ({epsilon_k} - {mu}) {imag_part_sign} i * {delta} )\")\n\n# Print the result of the calculation\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated bare Green's function is G_0 = {G0.real:.4f} {G0.imag:+.4f}j\")\n```\n<<<$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\delta \\text{ sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$>>>"
