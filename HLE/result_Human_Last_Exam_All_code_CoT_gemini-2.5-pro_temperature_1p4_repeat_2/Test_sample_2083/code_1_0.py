    # Let N be the dimension of the input vector. We'll use an example value.
    N = 10

    # Step 1: Goal
    # The goal is to find the minimum hidden-layer width H for a shallow neural network
    # with GELU activation to compute the function f(x) = ||x||^2 = Σ_{j=1 to N} x_j^2.

    # Step 2: Network Representation
    # The network computes f(x) ≈ Σ_{i=1 to H} c_i * GELU(w_i ⋅ x).
    # Using the Taylor series for GELU(z) ≈ z/2 + z^2/sqrt(2π), we get:
    # f(x) ≈ (1/2) * (Σ c_i * w_i) ⋅ x + (1/sqrt(2π)) * Σ c_i * (w_i ⋅ x)^2

    # Step 3: Required Conditions
    # To make this equal to ||x||^2, we must satisfy two conditions on the weights {w_i} and {c_i}:
    # 1. The linear term must be zero: Σ c_i * w_i = 0
    # 2. The quadratic term must match: Σ c_i * w_i * w_iᵀ = k * I (where I is the NxN identity matrix)

    # Step 4: Minimum H
    # We need to find the minimum H for which these conditions can be met.
    # - H must be at least N to span the N-dimensional space.
    # - H=N is not possible because it would require all c_i to be 0 to satisfy condition 1,
    #   which would violate condition 2.
    # - Therefore, H must be strictly greater than N. H > N.

    # Step 5: Sufficiency of H = N+1
    # A solution exists for H = N+1. This can be constructed using the N+1 vertices of a regular
    # N-simplex centered at the origin for the weight vectors {w_i}. This construction satisfies both conditions.

    # Conclusion: The minimum integer H such that H > N is N+1.
    min_hidden_width = N + 1
