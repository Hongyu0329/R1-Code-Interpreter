    "Based on publicly available drug identification databases, the numerical imprints on the specified capsules can be identified. I will provide a Python script to display this information clearly.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the numerical imprint for the Teva fluoxetine 10mg capsule, which is \"3105\".\n2.  Identify the numerical imprint for the Teva fluoxetine 20mg capsule, which is \"3106\".\n3.  Create a Python script that assigns these numbers to variables.\n4.  The script will print which number belongs to which capsule.\n5.  Finally, the script will print a simple inequality equation to show the difference between the two numbers, displaying each number in the equation.\n\n```python\ndef find_imprint_differences():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the different numerical imprints\n    on Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg and 20mg capsules.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Numerical imprint on the 10mg capsule\n    imprint_10mg = 3105\n    \n    # Numerical imprint on the 20mg capsule\n    imprint_20mg = 3106\n    \n    print(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule is: {imprint_10mg}\")\n    print(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule is: {imprint_20mg}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final equation showing the different numbers is:\")\n    print(f\"{imprint_10mg} != {imprint_20mg}\")\n\nfind_imprint_differences()\n```\n<<<3105 and 3106>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
