    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the SKI Expression**: The first step is to parse the complex SKI expression into smaller, more manageable parts. I'll identify the main operators and operands.\n2.  **Identify Known Combinators**: I will analyze the components to see if they match known combinators or patterns. A key part of the expression is `S(S(K(S))(K))`. This is very similar to the known `succ` (successor) combinator, `S(S(K S)(K))`. The single difference in parentheses, `(K(S))` vs `(K S)`, likely represents a typo, as the former expression doesn't represent a simple arithmetic operation, while the latter (`succ`) is fundamental for Church numerals. I will proceed assuming it means `succ`.\n3.  **Simplify the Components**:\n    *   The combinator `I` represents the Church numeral `1`.\n    *   The term `K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))` will be simplified. Assuming the `succ` combinator, this becomes `K(succ(1))`, which is `K(2)`.\n    *   The term `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))` becomes `succ(S(I)(I))`. The expression `S(I)(I)` is the `ω` combinator (`λf. f f`). So this term is `succ(ω)`.\n4.  **Reduce the Main Expression**: The overall structure of the expression is `A(A(A(B))(C)))`, where `A = S(I)`, `B = K(2)`, and `C = succ(ω)`. I will apply the reduction rules for these combinators step by step.\n    *   The rule for `S(I)` is `S(I) X Y = Y(X Y)`.\n    *   The innermost part `A(B)(C)` reduces to `C(B C) = C(K(2) C) = C(2)`.\n    *   I need to figure out what the function `C = succ(ω)` does when applied to a Church numeral `m`. A detailed reduction shows that `C(m)` evaluates to the Church numeral `m^3`.\n    *   Using this, `C(2)` becomes `2^3 = 8`.\n    *   The expression simplifies to `A(A(8))`.\n    *   I will reduce this further. `A(A(8))` evaluates to the function `λf. f(f(8f))`.\n5.  **Interpret as a Church Numeral**: The problem states the expression *is* a Church integer `n`. This means the final functional form must be equivalent to `λf.λx. f^n x`.\n    *   Applying `λf. f(f(8f))` to an argument `x` gives `f(f(8f x))`.\n    *   In the context of Church numerals, function application like this implies composition. `8f` means applying `f` eight times. So, `f(f(8f x))` means applying `f` once, then again, then 8 more times.\n    *   This gives a total of `1 + 1 + 8 = 10` applications of `f`.\n    *   So, the Church numeral `n` is `10`.\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: The question asks for `log_2(n)`. I will compute `log_2(10)`.\n7.  **Generate Code**: I will write a simple Python script to perform the final calculation and print the result as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Analyze the SKI expression.\n# The expression is E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))\n# Let A = S(I)\n# Let B = K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))\n# Let C = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))\n# The structure is A(A(A(B))(C))).\n\n# Step 2: Simplify the components.\n# We assume S(S(K(S))(K)) is a typo for the successor combinator, succ = S(S(K S)(K)).\n# I represents the church numeral 1.\n# So, B simplifies to K(succ(1)) = K(2).\n# And C simplifies to succ(S(I)(I)). S(I)(I) is the omega combinator, ω. So C = succ(ω).\n\n# Step 3: Reduce the expression.\n# The reduction rule for A is A X Y = S(I) X Y = Y(X Y).\n# The innermost expression is A(B)(C) = C(B C) = C(K(2) C) = C(2).\n# The function C = succ(ω), when applied to a Church numeral 'm', evaluates to the Church numeral m^3.\n# Therefore, C(2) = 2^3 = 8.\n# The expression becomes A(A(8)).\n# A(8) = S(I)(8) = λy. y(8y).\n# The full expression is A(A(8)) = S(I)(λy. y(8y)) = λf. f((λy. y(8y)) f) = λf. f(f(8f)).\n\n# Step 4: Interpret the result as a Church Numeral 'n'.\n# The problem states the expression is a church integer 'n', meaning it's equivalent to λf. f^n x.\n# Our result is λf. f(f(8f)).\n# When applied to 'x', this becomes f(f(8f x)).\n# In this context, application of functions of the same type is interpreted as composition.\n# f(f(f^8(x))) means f is applied 1 + 1 + 8 times.\n# So, n = 1 + 1 + 8 = 10.\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the final result.\nn = 10\nresult = math.log2(n)\n\n# Print the final equation and the result.\n# The 'f' string formatting requires Python 3.6+\nprint(f\"The church integer is n = {n}.\")\nprint(f\"The calculation is log_2(n).\")\nprint(f\"log_2({n}) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<3.3219280948873626>>>"
