# Step 1: Analyze the SKI expression.
# The expression is E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))
# Let A = S(I)
# Let B = K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))
# Let C = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))
# The structure is A(A(A(B))(C))).

# Step 2: Simplify the components.
# We assume S(S(K(S))(K)) is a typo for the successor combinator, succ = S(S(K S)(K)).
# I represents the church numeral 1.
# So, B simplifies to K(succ(1)) = K(2).
# And C simplifies to succ(S(I)(I)). S(I)(I) is the omega combinator, ω. So C = succ(ω).

# Step 3: Reduce the expression.
# The reduction rule for A is A X Y = S(I) X Y = Y(X Y).
# The innermost expression is A(B)(C) = C(B C) = C(K(2) C) = C(2).
# The function C = succ(ω), when applied to a Church numeral 'm', evaluates to the Church numeral m^3.
# Therefore, C(2) = 2^3 = 8.
# The expression becomes A(A(8)).
# A(8) = S(I)(8) = λy. y(8y).
# The full expression is A(A(8)) = S(I)(λy. y(8y)) = λf. f((λy. y(8y)) f) = λf. f(f(8f)).

# Step 4: Interpret the result as a Church Numeral 'n'.
# The problem states the expression is a church integer 'n', meaning it's equivalent to λf. f^n x.
# Our result is λf. f(f(8f)).
# When applied to 'x', this becomes f(f(8f x)).
# In this context, application of functions of the same type is interpreted as composition.
# f(f(f^8(x))) means f is applied 1 + 1 + 8 times.
# So, n = 1 + 1 + 8 = 10.

# Step 5: Calculate the final result.
n = 10
result = math.log2(n)

# Print the final equation and the result.
# The 'f' string formatting requires Python 3.6+
print(f"The church integer is n = {n}.")
print(f"The calculation is log_2(n).")
print(f"log_2({n}) = {result}")
