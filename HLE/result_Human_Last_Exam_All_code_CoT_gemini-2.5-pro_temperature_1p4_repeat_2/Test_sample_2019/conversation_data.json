    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Model the Board and Attacks**: The chessboard is a 5x5 grid, but it's toroidal, meaning it wraps around. An attack by a queen on this board covers:\n    *   The same row.\n    *   The same column.\n    *   The same diagonals, which also wrap around. For a queen at `(r, c)`, the main diagonal is defined by all squares `(r', c')` where `(r - c) % 5 == (r' - c') % 5`. The anti-diagonal is defined by `(r + c) % 5 == (r' + c') % 5`.\n\n2.  **Strategy**: The problem asks for the number of ways to place 4 queens on this 25-square board. Since the number of squares and queens is small, a brute-force approach is efficient enough. I will generate every possible combination of placing 4 queens on the 25 squares and then check each combination to see if it's a valid, non-attacking arrangement.\n\n3.  **Implementation**:\n    *   I will use Python's `itertools.combinations` to generate all possible sets of 4 squares. The total number of combinations is C(25, 4), which is 12,650.\n    *   For each combination of 4 squares, I will check if any two queens attack each other based on the toroidal rules.\n    *   I will loop through every pair of queens in the current placement. If any pair is found to be in an attacking position (same row, column, or toroidal diagonal), I will discard the entire placement.\n    *   A counter will be used to keep track of the number of valid, non-attacking placements.\n\n4.  **Final Output**: After checking all 12,650 combinations, the final value of the counter will be the answer. The script will print this final count in a descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_toroidal_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5\n    toroidal chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 5\n    NUM_QUEENS = 4\n    board_size = N * N\n    \n    # Generate all possible squares on the board, represented by indices 0-24.\n    all_squares = range(board_size)\n    \n    # Generate all combinations of placing NUM_QUEENS queens on the board.\n    possible_placements = itertools.combinations(all_squares, NUM_QUEENS)\n    \n    valid_solution_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each possible placement of 4 queens.\n    for placement in possible_placements:\n        # Convert the 1D square indices to 2D (row, col) coordinates.\n        coords = []\n        for square_index in placement:\n            row = square_index // N\n            col = square_index % N\n            coords.append((row, col))\n            \n        # Assume the current placement is valid until an attack is found.\n        is_valid = True\n        \n        # Check all pairs of queens for attacks.\n        for queen1, queen2 in itertools.combinations(coords, 2):\n            r1, c1 = queen1\n            r2, c2 = queen2\n            \n            # Check for attacks:\n            # 1.
