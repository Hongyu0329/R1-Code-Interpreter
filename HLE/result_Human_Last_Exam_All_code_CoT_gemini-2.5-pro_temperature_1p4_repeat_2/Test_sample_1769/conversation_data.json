    "Here is my plan to determine the Modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence:\n\n1.  **Identify the Source of \"Sister\"**: The current word \"sister\" comes from the Old Norse `systir`. This word was adopted into English during the period of Viking raids and settlement in England.\n2.  **Find the Original Word**: Before the Norse influence, Old English had its own native word. I will identify this original word, which is \"sweostor\".\n3.  **Trace its Evolution**: I will trace the phonetic and orthographic (spelling) changes that \"sweostor\" would have likely undergone from Old English, through Middle English, to Modern English, based on the known evolution of similar words.\n    *   **Simplification**: In Middle English, \"sweostor\" was often simplified to \"suster,\" losing the 'w' sound. This is a common linguistic simplification.\n    *   **Vowel Shift**: The vowel sound in \"suster\" would have evolved according to standard English sound changes, most notably the \"foot-strut split,\" which would change the vowel sound to the one in \"cup\" or \"strut.\"\n    *   **Analogy**: The spelling and pronunciation would likely align with other core family words like `mother` (from Old English `mōdor`) and `brother` (from Old English `brōþor`).\n4.  **Construct the Code**: I will write a Python script that prints this explanation and reveals the final resulting word.\n\n```python\ndef find_native_english_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the etymological path of the word for 'sister'\n    and determines what it would likely be without Norse influence.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the origin of the current word 'sister'.\")\n    print(\"The Modern English word 'sister' is a loanword from the Old Norse 'systir'.\")\n    print(\"This word was adopted due to the extensive interaction and settlement of Norse-speaking Vikings in England between the 7th and 12th centuries.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Identifying the original Old English word.\")\n    print(\"Before the Norse influence, the native Old English word for 'sister' was 'sweostor'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Tracing the likely evolution of 'sweostor' to Modern English.\")\n    print(\" - In Middle English, complex starting sounds were often simplified. 'sweostor' commonly became 'suster', losing the 'w' sound.\")\n    print(\" - The short 'u' vowel in 'suster' (pronounced like the vowel in 'put') would have undergone a standard English sound change known as the 'foot-strut split'.\")\n    print(\" - This would change the vowel to the /ʌ/ sound, like the 'u' in 'cup'.\")\n    print(\" - The spelling and pronunciation of the final syllable would likely follow the pattern of other kinship terms like mother (from mōdor) and brother (from brōþor).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Conclusion: Without the Old Norse loanword, the native Old English 'sweostor' would most likely have evolved into:\")\n    final_word = \"suster\"\n    print(f\"'{final_word}'\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_native_english_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
