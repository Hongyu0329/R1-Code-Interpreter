    This simulation demonstrates that a PCP that is both Red and Blue might not
    lead to a P=NP collapse, making its existence plausible under P != NP.

    The core idea is to show that a local search algorithm, which could
    potentially solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time, can fail.
    The search fails because the rejection probability function can have
    local minima, even when the underlying distance function does not.
