He is unable to form new memories (anterograde amnesia), leading him to forget to eat, and has difficulty recalling facts like the date. The confabulation is a classic symptom of a severe memory disorder. Therefore, categorizing the pathology as related to 'Short-term memory' is a direct and accurate description of the primary issue.")

    # Choice B
    print("\nChoice B: Restrictive cardiomyopathy")
    print("  Evaluation: This is a disease of the heart muscle. The patient has no cardiac symptoms and a normal physical exam. This choice is not supported by any evidence in the case.")

    # Choice C
    print("\nChoice C: Hepatic encephalopathy")
    print("  Evaluation: This condition is caused by severe liver failure. The case explicitly states the patient does not have cirrhosis, making this diagnosis incorrect.")

    # Choice D
    print("\nChoice D: Parasitic infection")
    print("  Evaluation: The 'tapeworm' is a story invented by the patient. This is not a diagnosis but a symptom of his memory disorder called confabulation. There is no clinical evidence of an actual infection.")

    # Choice E
    print("\nChoice E: ATP depletion")
    print("  Evaluation: This describes a basic cellular process. While neurological disorders ultimately involve cellular dysfunction, 'ATP depletion' is not a clinical diagnosis or a way to categorize a patient's syndrome. It is too general and non-specific.")
