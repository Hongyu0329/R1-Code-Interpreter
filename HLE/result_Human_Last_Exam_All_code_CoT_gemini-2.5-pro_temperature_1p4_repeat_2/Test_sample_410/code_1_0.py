# Step 1: Find the coefficients of f(x) = a_f*e^(2x) + b_f*e^x + c_f
# From the limit condition, we determined b_f = 1 and c_f = -3.
# Let's call them b_f and c_f to avoid confusion.
b_f = 1
c_f = -3
print(f"From the limit condition, we find the coefficient of e^x is b_f = {b_f}, and the constant term is c_f = {c_f}.")

# From the condition f(ln(2)) = 0, we find the coefficient a_f.
# The equation is a_f * e^(2*ln(2)) + e^(ln(2)) - 3 = 0
# a_f * 4 + 2 - 3 = 0
# 4*a_f - 1 = 0
a_f = 1/4
print(f"From the condition f(ln(2)) = 0, we find the coefficient of e^(2x) is a_f = {a_f}.")

# So the function f(x) is:
print(f"The function is f(x) = {a_f}*e^(2x) + {b_f}*e^x + {c_f}.")

# Step 2: Analyze the integral equation to find the condition on a and b.
# The problem asks to find a and b that satisfy the integral equation.
# Comparing the given equation with the standard identity for inverse function integrals,
# we deduced that the equation holds if a = f(ln(b)).
print("\nThe integral equation is equivalent to the condition: a = f(ln(b)).")

# Step 3: Solve for a and b.
# We substitute the function f(x) into the condition a = f(ln(b)).
# a = (1/4)*e^(2*ln(b)) + e^(ln(b)) - 3
# a = (1/4)*b^2 + b - 3
print("This gives the relation between a and b: a = (1/4)*b^2 + b - 3.")

# The problem uses ln(2) and f(ln(2))=0 as the starting point for the integrals.
# A natural special case to check is when the integration interval is zero.
# This occurs if we set ln(b) = ln(2), which means b = 2.
b = 2
print(f"\nLet's test the special case where b = {b}.")

# Now we find the corresponding value of a using the relation a = f(ln(b)).
# a = f(ln(2))
# From the given conditions, we know f(ln(2)) = 0.
a = 0
print(f"For b = {b}, we get a = f(ln({b})) = f({math.log(b):.3f}) = {a}.")
print(f"The values that satisfy the condition are a = {a} and b = {b}.")

# Step 4: The final equation and the final answer
# The problem asks for the sum a + b.
final_sum = a + b
print(f"\nThe final equation with these values is:")
print(f"Integral from 0 to {a} of g(x)dx + Integral from ln(2) to ln({b}) of f(x)dx = {a}*ln({b})")
# Substitute values
print(f"Integral from 0 to 0 of g(x)dx + Integral from {math.log(2):.3f} to {math.log(2):.3f} of f(x)dx = 0 * {math.log(2):.3f}")
print("0 + 0 = 0, which is true.")


print(f"\nThe sum a + b is {a} + {b} = {final_sum}.")

# Output the final answer in the requested format
# print(f'<<<{final_sum}>>>')
