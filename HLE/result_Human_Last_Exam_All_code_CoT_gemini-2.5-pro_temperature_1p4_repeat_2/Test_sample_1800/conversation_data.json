    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the ideal Ni/Ce ratio.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user is asking for the ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for Water Gas Shift (WGS) and Water Splitting (WS) reactions. This is a scientific question that relies on experimental data from published literature, not a direct calculation.\n2.  **Synthesize Scientific Data:** I will access my knowledge base of scientific research on Ni-Ceria catalysts. The \"ideal\" ratio is typically a range that represents a trade-off between having enough active Nickel sites and maintaining high dispersion of Ni nanoparticles on the Ceria support to maximize the crucial metal-support interface.\n3.  **Formulate a Code-Based Answer:** To meet the user's request for a coding solution, I will write a Python script. This script will not compute the ratio from scratch but will encode and present the findings from the literature.\n4.  **Structure the Python Script:**\n    *   Define variables representing the lower and upper bounds of the optimal Ni/Ce molar ratio range commonly reported for both WGS and WS.\n    *   Use `print()` statements to explain the context: that this is an experimentally determined range and why it's optimal (balancing active sites vs. dispersion).\n    *   Present the conclusion in a clear, equation-like format, printing each number as requested, to summarize the findings.\n\n```python\ndef find_ideal_ni_ce_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents findings from scientific literature on the ideal Ni/Ce\n    molar ratio for catalytic applications like Water Gas Shift (WGS) and Water Splitting (WS).\n\n    The ideal ratio is not a single fixed number but an optimal range that can\n    vary with synthesis method and reaction conditions. The key is to balance\n    the number of active Ni sites with high dispersion (small particle size)\n    to maximize the Ni-Ceria interface, which is crucial for catalytic activity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Based on literature, the optimal performance is often found when the molar\n    # percentage of Ni relative to the total metal content (Ni + Ce) is between 10% and 20%.\n    # We can translate this to a direct Ni/Ce molar ratio.\n\n    # Lower bound calculation: 10% Ni -> Ni/(Ni+Ce) = 0.1 -> 0.9*Ni = 0.1*Ce -> Ni/Ce = 0.1/0.9\n    optimal_ratio_lower_bound = 0.1 / 0.9\n\n    # Upper bound calculation: 20% Ni -> Ni/(Ni+Ce) = 0.2 -> 0.8*Ni = 0.2*Ce -> Ni/Ce = 0.2/0.8\n    optimal_ratio_upper_bound = 0.2 / 0.8\n\n    print(\"Analysis of the Ideal Ni/Ce Molar Ratio for Catalysis\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"The ideal Ni/Ce ratio maximizes catalytic sites while preventing Ni particle agglomeration.\")\n    print(\"This optimal balance is generally found within a specific range.\")\n    print(\"\\nBased on a review of experimental data for WGS and water splitting reactions:\")\n    \n    # Printing the numbers for the \"final equation\" as requested\n    print(\"\\n--- Optimal Range Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Represents a Ni/(Ni+Ce) molar percentage of 10% to 20%.\")\n    print(f\"Calculated Lower Bound (Ni/Ce Ratio): {optimal_ratio_lower_bound:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Calculated Upper Bound (Ni/Ce Ratio): {optimal_ratio_upper_bound:.2f}\")\n\n    # Final Conclusion\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"The final optimal molar ratio equation is represented by the range:\")\n    print(f\"Ideal_Ni/Ce_Ratio = ({optimal_ratio_lower_bound:.2f}) to ({optimal_ratio_upper_bound:.2f})\")\n    print(\"\\nA representative value within this range, often cited for high, stable activity, is approximately 0.18.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_ideal_ni_ce_ratio()\n```\n<<<0.18>>>"
