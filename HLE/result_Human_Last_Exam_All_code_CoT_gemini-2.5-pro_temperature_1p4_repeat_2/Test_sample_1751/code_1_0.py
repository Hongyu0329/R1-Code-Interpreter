# The key difference between the two lipids is the saturation of the sphingoid base chain.
# C16-dihydroceramide has a fully saturated sphingoid base (d18:0) and a saturated fatty acid (16:0).
# Saturated hydrocarbon chains are straight and can pack together very tightly and efficiently.
# This tight packing minimizes the area each molecule occupies.

# C16-ceramide has a sphingoid base with one double bond (d18:1).
# This double bond introduces a small, rigid disruption in the chain's shape.
# This disruption prevents the molecules from packing as closely as the fully saturated C16-dihydroceramide.
# Less efficient packing means each molecule occupies a larger area.

# Therefore, the lipid with the fully saturated chains will have a lower surface area when compressed.
