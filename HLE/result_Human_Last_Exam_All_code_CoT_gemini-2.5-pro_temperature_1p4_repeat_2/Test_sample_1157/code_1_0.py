    print("--- 1. Immediate Systemic Management ---")
    print("Priority 1: Managing Uncontrolled Diabetes")
    print("- Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 7.5% indicates poor long-term glucose control. High blood sugar impairs wound healing and increases the risk of post-procedural infections.")
    print("- Action: An urgent consultation with an endocrinologist or primary care physician is necessary to manage her diabetes. Elective dental procedures should be postponed until her glycemic levels are better controlled (e.g., HbA1c < 7%).")
    print("- Consideration: Her obesity is a contributing factor to her diabetes and is also a risk factor for surgical procedures.\n")

    print("--- 2. Management of Dental Trauma ---")
    print("Lost Teeth: Left lateral incisor (tooth #10), canine (#11), and first premolar (#12).")
    print("- The 28-hour delay makes reimplantation of the avulsed (knocked out) teeth impossible. The periodontal ligament cells on the root surface would not be viable.")
    print("- Procedure: The immediate focus would be on cleaning the wound, managing any soft tissue injuries, and ensuring there are no bone fractures in the jaw. A radiograph (X-ray) is essential.")
    print("- Pain and Infection Control: Prescribing analgesics for pain and antibiotics is crucial due to the delay, contamination of the wound, and the patient's diabetic status.\n")

    print("--- 3. Prosthodontic (Tooth Replacement) Plan ---")
    print("Skeletal Profile: An SNB angle of 88 degrees (normal is ~80Â°) indicates a protrusive mandible, characteristic of a Class III skeletal relationship. This affects the bite and the choice of replacement.")
    print("\nOption: Removable Partial Denture (RPD)")
    print("- Justification: This is a conservative, non-invasive, and cost-effective initial option, especially given the need to stabilize her systemic health first. It allows for easy cleaning and does not put stress on adjacent teeth initially.")
    print("- Denture Type: A flexible removable partial denture.")
    print("- Material: Valplast or a similar nylon thermoplastic resin. This material is lightweight, flexible, aesthetically pleasing (no metal clasps), and comfortable.")
    print("- Abutment Teeth: The primary abutment teeth would be the left first molar (#14) and the left central incisor (#9).")
    print("- Reasons for Abutment Choice: These teeth provide good distal and mesial support for the denture, ensuring stability during function. Clasps would engage these teeth to hold the denture in place.\n")
    print("Note: Dental implants are a superior long-term solution but would be contraindicated until her diabetes is well-controlled for several months due to the high risk of implant failure.\n")

    print("--- 4. Cells of Interest ---")
    print("The primary cells involved in the healing and response process are:")
    print("- Osteoblasts: Cells responsible for forming new bone to heal the sockets (alveolar bone).")
    print("- Fibroblasts: Cells that produce collagen and form fibrous tissue for wound healing.")
    print("- Neutrophils and Macrophages: Immune cells critical for cleaning the wound site of debris and bacteria. Their function can be impaired by hyperglycemia.")
    print("- Osteoclasts: Cells responsible for resorbing bone, which unfortunately leads to the gradual shrinkage of the jawbone ridge after tooth loss.")
