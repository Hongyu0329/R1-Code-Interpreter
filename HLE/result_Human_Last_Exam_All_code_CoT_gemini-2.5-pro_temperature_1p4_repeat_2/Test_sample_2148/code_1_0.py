# Step 1: Define the coupling constants for neutrinos
c_V = 0.5
c_A = 0.5

# Step 2: Calculate the term (c_V^2 + c_A^2)
cv2_plus_ca2 = c_V**2 + c_A**2

# Step 3: From the derivation, we know that (X_1 * X_2)^-1 = (36 * pi) / (c_V^2 + c_A^2)^2
# Let's calculate the coefficient C = 36 / (c_V^2 + c_A^2)^2
coefficient = 36 / (cv2_plus_ca2**2)

# The final expression is coefficient * pi
result = coefficient * math.pi

# Step 4: Print the final equation and its numerical value
# The instruction "output each number in the final equation" is interpreted
# as showing the components of the final derived expression, which is 144 * pi.
print("The final derived equation is (X_1 * X_2)^-1 = C * pi")
print(f"The value for the coefficient C is: {int(coefficient)}")
