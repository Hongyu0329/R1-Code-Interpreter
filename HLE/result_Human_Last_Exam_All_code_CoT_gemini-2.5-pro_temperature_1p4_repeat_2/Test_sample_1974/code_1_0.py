    Solves for the maximum possible cardinality of the set S.

    The problem asks for the maximum cardinality of a set S of Diophantine equations.
    These equations have no solutions, but their unsolvability is unprovable in ZFC,
    yet provable in ZFC + psi for some statement psi.

    1.  The set of all possible Diophantine equations (polynomials with integer
        coefficients) is countably infinite. This is because each equation can be
        encoded as a finite string of characters, and the set of all finite
        strings over a finite alphabet is countable. This establishes an upper
        bound on the cardinality of S: |S| <= ℵ₀ (aleph-null).

    2.  To show that this maximum can be achieved, we can construct a countably
        infinite set of such equations. This is done by repeatedly applying
        Gödel's second incompleteness theorem.

        -   Let σ₀ be the statement "ZFC is consistent". This statement is equivalent to
            the unsolvability of a specific Diophantine equation D₀ (by the MRDP
            theorem). ZFC cannot prove σ₀.
        -   Let σ₁ be "ZFC + σ₀ is consistent". This corresponds to another
            Diophantine equation D₁ whose unsolvability is not provable in ZFC.
        -   This process can be repeated infinitely to generate a countable set of
            Diophantine equations {D₀, D₁, D₂, ...} whose unsolvability is
            unprovable in ZFC.

    3.  We need a single statement ψ such that ZFC + ψ proves the unsolvability of
        all these equations. A sufficiently strong large cardinal axiom can serve
        as ψ. The existence of such cardinals can be forced, meaning we can move from
        a model M where ψ is false to a model M[G] where ψ is true. In M[G],
        the theory ZFC + ψ can prove the consistency of ZFC, ZFC + Con(ZFC), etc.,
        thereby proving the unsolvability of all the constructed equations Dₙ.

    4.  Therefore, it is possible to construct a set S of countably infinite size.
        Since |S| cannot exceed ℵ₀, the maximum possible cardinality is ℵ₀.
