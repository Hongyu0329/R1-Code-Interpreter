    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will identify the famous Islamic poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi.\nSecond, I will locate the specific section within the poem that lists the names of the 25 prophets mentioned in the Quran.\nThird, I will determine the starting and ending verse numbers (bayt) for that section based on the standard numbering of the poem.\nFinally, I will create a Python script that stores these numbers in variables and prints the answer in a clear, descriptive sentence, ensuring the numbers of the starting and ending bayt are explicitly printed as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophets_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the range of verses (bayt) in the poem\n    'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' where the names of the Prophets are mentioned.\n    \"\"\"\n    poem_name = \"'Aqeedat al-'Awaam (The Creed of the Laymen)'\"\n    author_name = \"Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi\"\n\n    # Based on the standard numbering of the poem, the list of 25 prophets\n    # begins at bayt 30 and concludes at bayt 33.\n    start_bayt = 30\n    end_bayt = 33\n\n    print(f\"In the poem {poem_name} by {author_name},\")\n    print(\"the names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned in the following range:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    # The final equation, printing each number explicitly as requested\n    print(f\"Starting bayt: {start_bayt}\")\n    print(f\"Ending bayt:   {end_bayt}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"The full range is from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n\nfind_prophets_verses()\n```\n<<<from bayt 30 to bayt 33>>>"
