    # Introduction to the problem
    explanation = [
        "The problem asks whether for any given sequence <f_alpha : alpha < omega_2> of functions",
        "from omega_1 to omega_1 that is strictly increasing modulo finite sets (f_alpha <^* f_beta for alpha < beta),",
        "it is a provable theorem in ZFC that there must exist an uncountable set X subset of omega_2",
        "and a function g from omega_1 to omega_1 that serves as a pointwise upper bound for all functions",
        "indexed by X (i.e., for all beta in X and gamma in omega_1, f_beta(gamma) < g(gamma)).",
        "\nThe answer is No. This property is not a theorem of ZFC. We can demonstrate this by showing that a",
        "counterexample is consistent with ZFC.",
        
        "\nStep 1: Define a potential counterexample structure.",
        "Consider a special kind of sequence called an 'omega_2-scale'. An omega_2-scale is a <^*-increasing",
        "sequence of functions <f_alpha : alpha < omega_2> which is also 'cofinal' (or 'dominating')",
        "in the partial order ({}^(omega_1)omega_1, <^*). Cofinality means that for any function h from",
        "omega_1 to omega_1, there is some function f_alpha in the sequence that eventually dominates it",
        "(i.e., h <^* f_alpha).",
        
        "\nStep 2: Show that an omega_2-scale is a counterexample.",
        "Assume such an omega_2-scale <f_alpha> exists. Let's suppose for contradiction that there is",
        "an uncountable set X subset of omega_2 and a bounding function g for {f_beta : beta in X}.",
        "By definition of g, for every beta in X, f_beta is pointwise bounded by g, which implies f_beta <^* g.",
        
        "Since the sequence <f_alpha> is a scale, it is cofinal. Therefore, for our function g, there must",
        "exist some ordinal delta < omega_2 such that g <^* f_delta.",
        
        "Now, X is an uncountable subset of omega_2, and delta is a specific element of omega_2.",
        "Thus, there must exist an element beta in X such that beta > delta.",
        "For this specific beta, we have three relations:",
        "  1. f_delta <^* f_beta (since beta > delta and the sequence is <^*-increasing)",
        "  2. f_beta <^* g      (since beta is in X and g is the bounding function)",
        "  3. g <^* f_delta      (by the cofinality property of the scale)",
        
        "Combining these gives a contradiction: f_delta <^* f_beta <^* g <^* f_delta, which means f_delta <^* f_delta.",
        "This is impossible, as the relation <^* is irreflexive. Therefore, if an omega_2-scale exists,",
        "no such uncountable bounded subsequence X and function g can exist.",
        
        "\nStep 3: Show that the existence of an omega_2-scale is consistent with ZFC.",
        "The existence of an omega_2-scale is not provable in ZFC alone, but it is consistent with ZFC.",
        "For example, in a model of ZFC satisfying the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH),",
        "we have 2^omega_1 = omega_2. In such a model, the dominating number d(omega_1) is equal to omega_2.",
        "This allows for the construction of an omega_2-scale by transfinite recursion, ensuring the sequence",
        "dominates every function in an enumeration of all omega_2 functions from omega_1 to omega_1.",
        
        "\nConclusion:",
        "Since we have a model of ZFC (e.g., ZFC + GCH) where a counterexample (the omega_2-scale) exists,",
        "the original statement cannot be a theorem of ZFC. The existence of the bounding function g and",
