# This script prints the symbolic formula for the instantaneous force f_x(t).
# The formula corresponds to Choice B, which captures all the physical effects described,
# including the negative sign from the Lorentz force direction, temperature dependence,
# and magnetic saturation.

# Symbolic representation of the final formula from Choice B.
# The numeric coefficient is -2.
