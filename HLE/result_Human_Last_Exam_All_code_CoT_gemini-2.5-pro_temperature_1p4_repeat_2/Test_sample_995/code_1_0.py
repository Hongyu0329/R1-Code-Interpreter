    This script calculates the solution to the agent problem based on analytical derivation.

    Step 1: Define A's win probability P(A wins | D, F).
    The target's radial distance `r` is uniformly distributed on [0, 1].
    Agent A is at D, Agent B is at F. A wins if |D - r| < |F - r|.
    This inequality simplifies to:
    - If D > F, A wins if r > (D+F)/2. P(A wins) = 1 - (D+F)/2.
    - If D < F, A wins if r < (D+F)/2. P(A wins) = (D+F)/2.

    Step 2: Determine A's optimal strategy for a given F.
    A chooses D in [0, 1] to maximize P(A wins).
    - If A chooses D to be just less than F, the probability approaches F.
    - If A chooses D to be just more than F, the probability approaches 1 - F.
    A will choose D to be infinitesimally close to F on the side that gives the
    higher probability. Thus, A's maximum win probability is P_max(F) = max(F, 1-F).

    Step 3: Determine the optimal F to minimize A's win probability.
    We need to find F in [0, 1] that minimizes P_max(F) = max(F, 1-F).
    The function max(F, 1-F) is minimized at the point where F = 1-F,
    which is F = 0.5.

    Step 4: Calculate the minimized probability and the final answer.
    The minimized probability of A winning occurs at F = 0.5 and is max(0.5, 1-0.5) = 0.5.
    The final value is floor(1 / P(A wins)).

    # The value of F that minimizes A's win probability
    optimal_F = 0.5

    # The minimized probability of A winning
    minimized_prob_A_wins = max(optimal_F, 1 - optimal_F)

    # The problem asks for floor(1 / P(A wins))
    numerator = 1
    denominator = minimized_prob_A_wins
    value = numerator / denominator
    final_answer = math.floor(value)

    # Print out the components of the final calculation as requested
    print(f"The minimized probability of A winning is P(A wins) = {minimized_prob_A_wins}.")
    print("The final calculation is floor(1 / P(A wins)).")
    print(f"Plugging in the value: floor({numerator} / {denominator})")
    print(f"This is equal to: floor({value})")
