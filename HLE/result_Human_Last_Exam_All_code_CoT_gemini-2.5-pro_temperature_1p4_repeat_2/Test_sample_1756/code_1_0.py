# Step 1: Analyze each statement to determine its validity.
# A) True. The final sampling pool is the intersection of the sets of tokens selected by top-k and nucleus sampling, which is equivalent to the more restrictive of the two.
# B) False. Beam search with b=1 is identical to greedy decoding regardless of ties. Both methods would deterministically pick one of the tied top tokens (e.g., based on vocabulary index).
# C) True. Temperature > 1 flattens the distribution, increasing the probabilities of lower-ranked tokens. This means more tokens are needed to reach the cumulative probability mass p, potentially including tokens that were originally outside the nucleus set.
# E) True. When resampling from a truncated distribution, the new probability of a token is its original probability divided by the sum of probabilities of all tokens in the truncated set. This scaling factor is the same for all tokens, so their relative ratios are preserved.
# F) False. This is not guaranteed. For nucleus p=0.9, the excluded mass is <= 0.1. One can easily "tune" k to be very large (e.g., k=|V|), making the excluded mass by top-k zero. In this case, the nucleus excluded mass is greater.
# G) True. Standard implementations apply these as filters. The final set of candidates is the intersection of the top-k set and the nucleus set. Set intersection is a commutative operation, so the order does not matter.
# H) False. Greedy search produces a single, deterministic sequence (zero diversity). Beam search maintains multiple hypotheses, which inherently represents more diversity than a single output.
# I) False. Temperature < 1 sharpens the distribution, making the model more confident and deterministic. This increases the chance of all beams following the same high-probability path, making identical beams more likely, not preventing them.
# J) False. Length normalization corrects for the model's bias towards shorter sequences. The "beam curse" is a diversity problem, which is addressed by techniques like diversity penalties, not length normalization.
# K) False. This incorrectly conflates resampling with repetition penalty and temperature scaling. These are distinct concepts.
# L) False. Nucleus sampling with p=1 considers the entire vocabulary, which is identical to standard multinomial sampling. Ties in probabilities do not affect this equivalence.
# M) False. `torch.manual_seed()` is generally insufficient for perfect determinism on GPUs. Non-deterministic algorithms (e.g., for atomic adds in CUDA) must also be disabled via `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)`. Even then, other factors can cause issues.
# N) False. There is no evidence of a monotonic relationship. Deeper models often become more confident, leading to lower-entropy distributions and thus less variance in sampling.
# O) True. Different GPU architectures (like A100 vs. V100) can have slightly different implementations of floating-point operations. These tiny numerical differences can cascade in a sensitive process like beam search, leading to different outcomes.
# P) True. If expert pruning is dynamic (e.g., based on system load or other non-deterministic factors that can vary "across runs"), the effective model changes between runs, leading to different probability distributions and thus different nucleus sampling sets.
# Q) False. Even with deterministic routing, other sources of non-determinism exist, such as non-associative floating-point math in parallel reductions and differences in CUDA kernels, as mentioned in other points.
# R) True. Batches with different maximum sequence lengths result in tensors of different shapes. This can cause the underlying CUDA/cuDNN library to select different computation kernels which may not be bit-for-bit identical, causing minor numerical variations that affect outcomes.
# S) False. A mixture-of-depth model might route a token through a shallow path, which could be less certain (higher entropy) than the deepest possible path. Therefore, the final entropy is not necessarily bounded by the entropy of the deepest model.
# T) False. Quantization introduces small errors that can alter the logit values non-uniformly, meaning relative token rankings are not guaranteed to be preserved.
# W) False. Temperature is an external parameter applied to logits; it is not an intrinsic property of a model. The statement is conceptually ill-defined.
# X) True. The sum in the softmax denominator is a classic source of non-determinism. Due to the non-associativity of floating-point addition, performing the sum in a different order (which can happen due to parallel hardware scheduling) can yield a slightly different result, affecting beam search paths.
# Y) True. Activation checkpointing involves recomputing parts of the forward pass. This recomputation is subject to the same sources of numerical non-determinism as the original pass (e.g., from points O, X). The recomputed activations can be slightly different, altering the final distribution.

# Step 3: Sort the letters lexicographically and print them as a comma-separated string.
# The prompt's instruction "output each number in the final equation" is interpreted as
