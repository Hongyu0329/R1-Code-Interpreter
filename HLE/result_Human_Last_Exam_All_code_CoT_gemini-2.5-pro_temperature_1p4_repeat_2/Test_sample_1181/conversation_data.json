    "In this task, I need to identify the character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris* who says they are ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Characters:**\n    *   A. Kris Kelvin: The main protagonist, a psychologist. His primary struggle is with the reappearance of his dead wife, Hari.\n    *   B. Hari: A \"visitor\" or simulacrum of Kris's wife. She is not from Earth and wouldn't have memories of rustling leaves to miss.\n    *   C. Snaut: A cyberneticist on the station. He is cynical and resigned to their situation, but this specific sentiment isn't attributed to him.\n    *   D. Sartorius: A cold, scientifically-minded astrobiologist. He is focused on the phenomenon of Solaris and is generally dismissive of emotional or terrestrial concerns.\n    *   E. Gibarian: Kris's friend and a fellow psychologist who was on the station. He commits suicide before Kris arrives. Kris watches a final video message left by him.\n\n2.  **Recall the Scene:** The sentiment is expressed in the final video testament that Dr. Gibarian records for Kris. In his message, a distraught Gibarian confesses his feelings of failure, isolation, and psychological torment. He reflects on their loss of humanity and connection to Earth, mentioning that he is even ashamed to admit he misses simple terrestrial things like the sound of leaves rustling.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The character is Gibarian. This corresponds to answer choice E. I will write a Python script that explains this and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_solaris_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the question about the 1972 movie Solaris\n    and determines the correct character.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"In the 1972 Andrei Tarkovsky movie Solaris which character is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth?\"\n\n    characters = {\n        \"A\": \"Kris\",\n        \"B\": \"Hari\",\n        \"C\": \"Snaut\",\n        \"D\": \"Sartorius\",\n        \"E\": \"Gibarian\"\n    }\n\n    explanation = (\n        \"The character who expresses this sentiment is Dr. Gibarian.\\n\"\n        \"Before Kris Kelvin arrives on the space station, Gibarian takes his own life.\\n\"\n        \"He leaves a final, rambling video message for Kris. In this message, he confesses his despair and shame, \"\n        \"mentioning his longing for Earth and that he is ashamed to admit he misses something as simple as the sound of rustling leaves. \"\n        \"This highlights his psychological torment and profound sense of isolation.\"\n    )\n\n    correct_answer_letter = \"E\"\n    correct_character_name = characters[correct_answer_letter]\n\n    print(f\"Question: {question}\")\n    print(\"\\nAnalyzing the characters and plot points...\")\n    print(f\"\\nExplanation:\\n{explanation}\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the correct character is {correct_character_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The correct answer choice is: {correct_answer_letter}\")\n\n# Execute the function to solve the problem\nsolve_solaris_question()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
