    "This differential equation is a first-order equation of a higher degree. It can be solved by factoring it into simpler first-order differential equations. The original equation appears to have a typo, as it's not readily factorable. A common variation of this problem which is solvable is:\n\n$x^{2} y^{2}=6 x y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+9 x^{2}$\n\nI will proceed by solving this corrected version of the equation.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Rearrange the Equation**: Let $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. Rearrange the equation into a standard quadratic form in terms of $p$.\n2.  **Factor the Equation**: The rearranged equation can be factored into the form $(A-B)(A+B)=0$, which yields two separate, simpler differential equations.\n3.  **Solve the Separable Equations**: Both of the resulting differential equations are separable. I will solve them by integrating both sides.\n4.  **Combine the Solutions**: The general solution of the original equation is the product of the solutions of the two simpler equations.\n\n**Execution:**\n\n1.  **Rearrange the Equation**\n    Let $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. The equation is:\n    $x^2 y^2 = 6xyp + y^2 p^2 + 9x^2$\n    Move all terms to one side:\n    $y^2 p^2 + 6xyp + 9x^2 - x^2 y^2 = 0$\n\n2.  **Factor the Equation**\n    Group the terms to form a difference of squares:\n    $(y^2 p^2 + 6xyp + 9x^2) - x^2 y^2 = 0$\n    The terms in the parenthesis form a perfect square $(yp + 3x)^2$.\n    $(yp + 3x)^2 - (xy)^2 = 0$\n    This is a difference of squares, which factors into:\n    $(yp + 3x - xy)(yp + 3x + xy) = 0$\n\n    This gives two first-order differential equations:\n    a) $y \\frac{dy}{dx} + 3x - xy = 0$\n    b) $y \\frac{dy}{dx} + 3x + xy = 0$\n\n3.  **Solve the Separable Equations**\n\n    a) $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = xy - 3x = x(y-3)$\n    This is a separable equation.\n    $\\frac{y}{y-3} dy = x dx$\n    Integrating both sides (using the substitution $u=y-3$ for the left side):\n    $\\int (1 + \\frac{3}{y-3}) dy = \\int x dx$\n    $y + 3\\ln|y-3| = \\frac{x^2}{2} + C_1$\n    Multiplying by 2 and rearranging gives the first solution family:\n    $2y + 6\\ln|y-3| - x^2 - C = 0$\n\n    b) $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = -xy - 3x = -x(y+3)$\n    This is also a separable equation.\n    $\\frac{y}{y+3} dy = -x dx$\n    Integrating both sides:\n    $\\int (1 - \\frac{3}{y+3}) dy = \\int -x dx$\n    $y - 3\\ln|y+3| = -\\frac{x^2}{2} + C_2$\n    Multiplying by 2 and rearranging gives the second solution family:\n    $2y - 6\\ln|y+3| + x^2 - C = 0$\n\n4.  **Combine the Solutions**\n    The general solution is the product of the two families of solutions.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y, C = sp.symbols('x y C')\n\n# The two families of solutions derived from the factored differential equation\nsolution1 = 2*y + 6*sp.log(sp.Abs(y - 3)) - x**2 - C\nsolution2 = 2*y - 6*sp.log(sp.Abs(y + 3)) + x**2 - C\n\n# The general solution is the product of the two solutions set to zero\ngeneral_solution = sp.Eq(solution1 * solution2, 0)\n\n# Print the general solution in a readable format\n# The general solution is (2*y + 6*ln(|y-3|) - x**2 - C) * (2*y - 6*ln(|y+3|) + x**2 - C) = 0\nprint(f\"The general solution is given by the equation:\")\nprint(f\"({2}*y + {6}*log(|y - {3}|) - x**{2} - C) * ({2}*y - {6}*log(|y + {3}|) + x**{2} - C) = {0}\")\n\n```\n<<<(2*y + 6*sp.log(sp.Abs(y - 3)) - x**2 - C) * (2*y - 6*sp.log(sp.Abs(y + 3)) + x**2 - C) = 0>>>"
