    "An analytical approach is required to find the separatrix for the given system of differential equations. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. Often, these are the stable or unstable manifolds associated with saddle points of the system.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Find the equilibrium points**: We will solve for $(d, u)$ such that $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\n2.  **Classify the equilibrium points**: We will compute the Jacobian matrix of the system and evaluate its eigenvalues at each equilibrium point. This will allow us to identify any saddle points.\n3.  **Identify the separatrix**: The separatrix is typically the unstable manifold of a saddle point. This manifold is itself a trajectory of the system. We will seek an explicit equation for this trajectory, which must pass through the saddle point.\n4.  **Find the equation for the separatrix**: We can form a differential equation for the trajectories in the phase plane, $\\frac{d d}{d u} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)}$. We will look for a simple polynomial solution of the form $d=f(u)$ that satisfies this equation and passes through the saddle point.\n5.  **Output the result**: The final step is to present the derived equation of the separatrix and explicitly state the numerical coefficients and powers involved, as requested.\n\nThe Python code below executes this plan by first explaining the analytical steps and then printing the final equation for the separatrix.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the analytical steps to find the separatrix of the given system\n    and prints the final equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Finding the equilibrium points.\")\n    print(\"The system of equations is:\")\n    print(\"d'(t) = 2*d**2 + (-3*u + 5*u**2)*d - u**3*(1-u)\")\n    print(\"u'(t) = u**2*(u - 1)\")\n    print(\"Setting u'(t) = 0, we get u**2*(u - 1) = 0, which yields u = 0 or u = 1.\")\n    print(\"Case 1: u = 0.
