    "My plan is to solve the given equation.\nFirst, I will decipher the Coptic numerals into modern Arabic numerals.\nThe equation is: `പ്പെ/𒌋𒌋𒌋-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹=?`\n\n1.  `പ്പെ` represents the number 80.\n2.  `𒌋𒌋𒌋` represents the number 30 (10 + 10 + 10).\n3.  `𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹` represents the number 23 (10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1).\n\nSo, the equation in modern numbers is `80 / 30 - 23 = ?`\n\nNext, I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the full equation with the solution.\n\n```python\n# The equation is translated from Coptic numerals to modern numbers.\n# πε (80) / 𒌋𒌋𒌋 (30) - 𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹 (23)\n\nnum1 = 80\nnum2 = 30\nnum3 = 23\n\n# Calculate the result following the order of operations (division then subtraction)\nresult = num1 / num2 - num3\n\n# Print the equation in modern numbers along with the final answer\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-20.333333333333336>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is a solution to this equation:\n𒄶/𒌋𒌋𒌋-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹=?\n\nAnswer using modern numbers\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
