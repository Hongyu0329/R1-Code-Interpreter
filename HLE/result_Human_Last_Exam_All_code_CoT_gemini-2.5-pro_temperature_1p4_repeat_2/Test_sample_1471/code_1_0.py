# The equation is translated from Coptic numerals to modern numbers.
# πε (80) / 𒌋𒌋𒌋 (30) - 𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹 (23)

num1 = 80
num2 = 30
num3 = 23

# Calculate the result following the order of operations (division then subtraction)
result = num1 / num2 - num3

# Print the equation in modern numbers along with the final answer
print(f"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}")
