    print("The statement is false.")
    print("A counterexample is provided by the logarithmic multiplicative group, which we denote as G_m^log.")
    print("\nHere is a step-by-step explanation:")
    
    print("\n1. G_m^log is a log group scheme.")
    print("   In the category of log schemes, there is a group object called the logarithmic multiplicative group. It plays a role analogous to the standard multiplicative group G_m in the category of schemes.")
    
    print("\n2. The underlying scheme of G_m^log is the projective line P^1.")
    print("   By construction, the scheme underlying G_m^log is the projective line P^1 over the base scheme.")
    
    print("\n3. The projective line P^1 is not a group scheme.")
    print("   We can show this by looking at the sheaf of differential 1-forms. A necessary condition for a smooth scheme G of dimension n to be a group scheme is that its sheaf of 1-forms, Omega^1_G, must be a free O_G-module of rank n (isomorphic to the direct sum of n copies of the structure sheaf O_G).")
    
    print("\n   Let's check this for G = P^1:")
    print("   - The dimension of P^1 is n = 1.")
    print("   - Therefore, if P^1 were a group scheme, its sheaf of 1-forms, Omega^1_{P^1}, would have to be isomorphic to its structure sheaf, O_{P^1}.")
    print("   - However, it is a standard result in algebraic geometry that the sheaf of 1-forms on P^1 is isomorphic to the twisting sheaf O_{P^1}(-2).")
    
    print("\n4. Conclusion:")
    print("   The sheaves O_{P^1} and O_{P^1}(-2) are not isomorphic. A simple way to see this is by looking at their global sections over a field k:")
    print("   - The space of global sections of O_{P^1} is H^0(P^1, O_{P^1}), which is the set of constant functions, so it is a 1-dimensional vector space over k.")
    print("   - The space of global sections of O_{P^1}(-2) is H^0(P^1, O_{P^1}(-2)), which is the zero vector space.")
    print("   Since 1 is not equal to 0, the spaces of global sections are different, so the sheaves cannot be isomorphic.")
    print("   Thus, P^1 is not a group scheme.")
    
    print("\nSince the underlying scheme of the log group scheme G_m^log is P^1, which is not a group scheme, the original statement is false.")
