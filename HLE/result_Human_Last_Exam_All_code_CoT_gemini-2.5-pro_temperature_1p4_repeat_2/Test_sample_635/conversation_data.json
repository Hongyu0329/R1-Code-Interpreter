    "To find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Write H(s) over a common denominator**: We'll find the least common multiple of all the denominators in $H(s)$ and rewrite the matrix as $H(s) = \\frac{1}{p(s)} P(s)$, where $p(s)$ is a scalar polynomial and $P(s)$ is a polynomial matrix. This gives an initial, but not necessarily coprime, factorization with $D_0(s) = p(s)I$ and $N_0(s) = P(s)$.\n2.  **Identify common factors**: The initial factorization may have common left divisors. We can identify these by checking the rank of the composite matrix $[D_0(s) \\quad N_0(s)]$ at the roots of $\\det(D_0(s))$. If the rank drops at a certain root $s=s_0$, it indicates a common factor, often related to $(s-s_0)$.\n3.  **Extract the common factors**: Using elementary row operations and polynomial matrix division, we will extract a greatest common left divisor (GCLD) of $D_0(s)$ and $N_0(s)$. Let this GCLD be $G(s)$. Then we have $D_0(s) = G(s)D(s)$ and $N_0(s) = G(s)N(s)$. The new factorization is $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$.\n4.  **Verify coprimeness**: We will verify that the final matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime by checking that $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex numbers $s$.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivation:**\n\n1.  The given transfer function is:\n    $H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n    The least common denominator is $p(s) = s^2 - 1$.\n    $H(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2-1} \\begin{bmatrix} (s-1)^2 & s^2-1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n2.  This gives an initial factorization with $D_0(s) = (s^2-1)I = \\begin{bmatrix} s^2-1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $N_0(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s^2-2s+1 & s^2-1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. The roots of $\\det(D_0(s))$ are $s=1$ and $s=-1$. We can find that $[D_0(s) \\quad N_0(s)]$ loses rank at both $s=1$ and $s=-1$, so the factorization is not coprime.\n\n3.  After a systematic procedure of extracting the greatest common left divisor, we arrive at the following factorization:\n    $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n    $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n4.  We verify this solution. First, let's check if $D^{-1}(s)N(s) = H(s)$:\n    $D^{-1}(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2-1} \\begin{bmatrix} s^2-1 & -(s-1) \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{s^2-1} \\end{bmatrix}$\n    $D^{-1}(s)N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{s^2-1} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 - \\frac{2}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = H(s)$.\n    The factorization is correct.\n\n5.  Next, we verify coprimeness. The roots of $\\det(D(s)) = s^2-1$ are $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n    At $s=1$, $[D(1) \\quad N(1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, which has rank 2.\n    At $s=-1$, $[D(-1) \\quad N(-1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, which has rank 2.\n    Since the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ is 2 (full row rank) at all critical points, the factorization is left coprime.\n\nThe following Python code defines and prints the resulting matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef coprime_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function defines and prints the matrices for a left coprime factorization\n    of the given transfer function H(s).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # The resulting matrices D(s) and N(s) for the left coprime factorization\n    # H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s)\n    D = sympy.Matrix([\n        [1, s - 1],\n        [0, s**2 - 1]\n    ])\n\n    N = sympy.Matrix([\n        [1, 1],\n        [2, 0]\n    ])\n\n    # Print the final answer in a structured format\n    print(\"A left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) is given by:\")\n\n    print(\"\\nD(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(D)\n\n    print(\"\\nN(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(N)\n    \n    # Print each element of the final equation as requested\n    print(\"\\nIn element-wise form, the components of D(s) and N(s) are:\")\n    print(f\"D(1,1) = {D[0,0]}\")\n    print(f\"D(1,2) = {D[0,1]}\")\n    print(f\"D(2,1) = {D[1,0]}\")\n    print(f\"D(2,2) = {D[1,1]}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nN(1,1) = {N[0,0]}\")\n    print(f\"N(1,2) = {N[0,1]}\")\n    print(f\"N(2,1) = {N[1,0]}\")\n    print(f\"N(2,2) = {N[1,1]}\")\n\ncoprime_factorization()\n<<<D(s) = [[1, s - 1], [0, s**2 - 1]], N(s) = [[1, 1], [2, 0]]>>>\n```"
