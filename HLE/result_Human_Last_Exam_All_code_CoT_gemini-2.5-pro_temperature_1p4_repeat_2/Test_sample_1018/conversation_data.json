    "To compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical objects**: We are dealing with the product of two closed, oriented surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$. The genus for the first surface is $g_1 = 31$ and for the second is $g_2 = 17$.\n2.  **Recall the formula for the simplicial volume of a surface**: For a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 2$, the surface is hyperbolic and its simplicial volume is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g - 4$. Since $31 \\ge 2$ and $17 \\ge 2$, we can apply this formula.\n3.  **Calculate the simplicial volume of each surface**:\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{31}$: $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4 \\times 31 - 4$.\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{17}$: $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4 \\times 17 - 4$.\n4.  **Recall the formula for the simplicial volume of the product**: For the product of two such surfaces $\\Sigma_{g_1}$ and $\\Sigma_{g_2}$ (with $g_1, g_2 \\ge 2$), the simplicial volume is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_{g_1} \\times \\Sigma_{g_2}\\| = \\frac{1}{6} \\|\\Sigma_{g_1}\\| \\|\\Sigma_{g_2}\\|$.\n5.  **Compute the final result**: We will substitute the values calculated in step 3 into the formula from step 4 to obtain the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements these steps to compute the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the genera of the surfaces.\ng1 = 31\ng2 = 17\n\n# Step 2 & 3: Define the formula for the simplicial volume of a surface\n# ||Σ_g|| = 4g - 4 for g >= 2, and calculate the volumes.\nvol_g1 = 4 * g1 - 4\nvol_g2 = 4 * g2 - 4\n\n# Step 4 & 5: Define the formula for the product and compute the final volume.\n# ||Σ_g1 x Σ_g2|| = (1/6) * ||Σ_g1|| * ||Σ_g2||\n# We use integer arithmetic as the result is an integer.\nfinal_volume = (vol_g1 * vol_g2) // 6\n\n# Print the calculation step-by-step\nprint(f\"The simplicial volume of a surface Σ_g with genus g≥2 is ||Σ_g|| = 4g - 4.\")\nprint(f\"For g1 = {g1}, the simplicial volume is ||Σ_{g1}|| = 4 * {g1} - 4 = {vol_g1}.\")\nprint(f\"For g2 = {g2}, the simplicial volume is ||Σ_{g2}|| = 4 * {g2} - 4 = {vol_g2}.\")\nprint(f\"The simplicial volume of the product is given by the formula: ||Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2}|| = (1/6) * ||Σ_{g1}|| * ||Σ_{g2}||.\")\nprint(f\"Plugging in the numbers, we get the final equation:\")\nprint(f\"||Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2}|| = (1/6) * {vol_g1} * {vol_g2} = {final_volume}\")\n```\n<<<1280>>>"
