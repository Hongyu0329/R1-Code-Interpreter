# --- Question 1 Analysis ---
# The provided C code has compiler errors on the following lines:
# 1. `unsigned long long n = 0, ...;`: The data type `unsigned long long` is not supported by the XVM compiler.
# 2. `scanf("%d %d %d", &n, &m, &a);`: The format specifier `%d` is for a single `digit`. The variables (correctly typed as `unsigned long`) require the `%n` specifier.
# 3. `printf("%d",na * ma);`: The format specifier `%d` is for a single `digit`. The result, a large number, requires the `%n` specifier.
q1_answer = 3

# --- Question 2 Analysis ---
# To rewrite the code with the least memory and branching, we can use 3 variables (n, m, a)
# and a mathematical formula to avoid 'if' statements.
# The data type for n, m, and a must be `unsigned long` to hold the potential input values.
# The XVM `unsigned long` data type has a size of 12D.
# Total memory = 3 variables * 12D/variable = 36D.
q2_answer = 36

# --- Question 3 Analysis ---
# The problem can be solved without branching statements.
# The calculation `ceil(n / a)` can be expressed using only integer arithmetic
# as `(n + a - 1) // a`. This eliminates the need for an `if` statement.
q3_answer = "Y"

# --- Question 4 Calculation ---
# This part calculates the required number of flagstones for n = 4*10^9, m = 4*10^9, a = 1.
n = 4 * 10**9
m = 4 * 10**9
a = 1

# Number of flagstones for the 'n' side: ceiling(n/a)
flagstones_n = math.ceil(n / a)

# Number of flagstones for the 'm' side: ceiling(m/a)
flagstones_m = math.ceil(m / a)

# Total flagstones
q4_answer = flagstones_n * flagstones_m

# Print the equation as requested in the instructions
# Using int() to get clean integer representation for printing
print(f"The calculation for the number of flagstones is:")
print(f"{int(flagstones_n)} * {int(flagstones_m)} = {int(q4_answer)}")


# --- Final Answer Formatting ---
# The prompt asks for the answer in the format x:y:z where x, y, t, z correspond
# to the questions. This appears to be a typo. Assuming the intended format is
# x:y:z:t for questions 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
final_answer_string = f"{q1_answer}:{q2_answer}:{q3_answer}:{int(q4_answer)}"
# This final string will be presented as the answer.
