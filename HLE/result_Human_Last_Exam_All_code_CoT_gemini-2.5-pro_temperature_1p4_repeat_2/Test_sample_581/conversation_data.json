    "This is a knowledge-based question from the field of combinatorial number theory. The \"cap set problem\" asks for the maximum size of a subset of the vector space `(Z/3)^n` that contains no three distinct elements in an arithmetic progression (i.e., no `x, y, z` such that `x + z = 2y`). This maximum size is denoted `r_3(n)`.\n\nFinding the exact values or tight bounds for `r_3(n)` is a very difficult problem. For small `n`, the exact values are known:\n*   `r_3(1) = 2`\n*   `r_3(2) = 4`\n*   `r_3(3) = 9`\n*   `r_3(4) = 20`\n*   `r_3(5) = 45`\n*   `r_3(6) = 112`\n\nFor `n > 6`, the exact values are unknown. To find a lower bound for `r_3(8)`, we can use a \"product construction\", which states that `r_3(n+m) >= r_3(n) * r_3(m)`. This allows us to build larger cap sets from smaller ones.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that:\n1.  Defines the known values for `r_3(n)` up to `n=6`.\n2.  Uses the product construction to calculate a strong lower bound for `r_3(8)`. For example, `r_3(8) >= r_3(6) * r_3(2)`.\n3.  States that while this method gives a good bound, the \"best-known\" bound comes from more complex, specific constructions found in mathematical literature.\n4.  Prints the current record for the lower bound of `r_3(8)`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cap_set_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and calculates lower bounds for the cap set problem in dimension 8.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The cap set problem asks for the size of the largest subset of (Z/3)^n\n    # without a 3-term arithmetic progression.
