# Plan:
# 1. Analyze the line: "And in the letter, my cousin mentions a piece of advice"
# 2. Identify the stress of each syllable.
#    - And (x) in (x) the (x) let(/)ter(x)
#    - my (x) cou(/)sin(x)
#    - men(/)tions(x)
#    - a (x) piece (/)
#    - of (x) ad(x)vice(/)
# 3. Concatenate the stress marks ("x" and "/") into a single string.
#    The resulting string should be: xxx/xx/x/xx/xx/
# 4. Print the final scansion string.

scansion_result = "xxx/xx/x/xx/xx/"
print(scansion_result)
