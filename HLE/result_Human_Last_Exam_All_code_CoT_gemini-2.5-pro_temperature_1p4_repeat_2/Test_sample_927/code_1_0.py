Analysis of the Definable Sets:

The problem asks to characterize the subsets of the natural numbers (N) that are definable by an existential formula in the language {+, -, .} interpreted over the real numbers (R), with a predicate P for N. Arbitrary real parameters are allowed.

1.  Direction 1: Every definable set is Recursively Enumerable (RE).
    A set S is definable if membership of an element n can be expressed by an existential formula. We can show that any such formula, even with arbitrary real parameters, can be reduced to a question about the solvability of a system of polynomial equations where some variables must be real and others must be natural numbers.

    Specifically, a set S is definable if S = {n in N | exists y-vector in R^k, z-vector in N^l, Q(n, y, z) = 0} for some integer polynomial Q.

    To check if 'n' is in S, one can write a program that does the following:
    - Iterate through all possible tuples for `z-vector` from N^l.
    - For each `z-vector`, check if the polynomial equation Q(n, y, z-vector) = 0 has a solution for `y-vector` in R^k.
    - The existence of real solutions to a system of polynomial equations is decidable, a classic result by Tarski.
    - If a solution is found for any `z-vector`, the program halts and confirms that n is in S.

    This describes a semi-decision procedure, which is the definition of a recursively enumerable (RE) set. Thus, every definable set is RE.

2.  Direction 2: Every RE set is definable.
    By the Davis-Putnam-Robinson-Matiyasevich (DPRM) theorem, any RE set S can be represented by a Diophantine equation. This means there's a polynomial P with integer coefficients such that:
    n in S if and only if there exist natural numbers z_1, ..., z_k such that P(n, z_1, ..., z_k) = 0.

    This statement can be directly translated into an existential L-formula:
    exists z_1, ..., z_k (P(z_1) AND P(z_2) AND ... AND P(z_k) AND P(n, z_1, ..., z_k) = 0)

    This formula uses the available symbols and structure, so every RE set is definable.

Conclusion:
Since the definable sets are exactly the RE sets, the correct answer is D.
