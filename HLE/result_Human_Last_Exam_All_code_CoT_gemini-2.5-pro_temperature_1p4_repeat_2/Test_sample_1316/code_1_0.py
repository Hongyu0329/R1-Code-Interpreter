    # Step 2: Determine the gametes that formed this offspring.
    # To be X0, the offspring needs one X and one 'null' gamete.
    # Since the phenotype is paternal, the X chromosome must come from the father's sperm.
    paternal_gamete = "Sperm with an X chromosome"
    # This means the mother must have provided the 'null' gamete.
    maternal_gamete = "Egg with no X chromosome (nullo-X egg)"

    # Step 3: Identify the cause of the abnormal maternal gamete.
    # A nullo-X egg is formed by non-disjunction, an error during meiosis.
    # Since the egg is from the mother, the event occurred in female meiosis.
    cause = "Non-disjunction of the X chromosome in the female"

    # Step 4: Specify the meiotic stage.
    # Non-disjunction in Meiosis I (failure of homologous chromosomes to separate) results
    # in the production of both nullo-X eggs and XX eggs.
    # The nullo-X eggs, when fertilized by an X-sperm, produce X0 males (like the one in the question).
    # The XX eggs, when fertilized by a Y-sperm, produce XXY females (the other exceptional
    # offspring Bridges observed).
    # This single event in Meiosis I provides a complete explanation for all of Bridges'
    # exceptional flies.
