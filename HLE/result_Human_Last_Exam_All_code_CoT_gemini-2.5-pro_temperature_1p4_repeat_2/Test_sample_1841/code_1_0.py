# The student's analysis resulted in a Simpson's Diversity Index of 0.
# Let's analyze what this means.

# The formula for Simpson's Diversity Index (D) is:
# D = 1 - (Σn(n-1)) / (N(N-1))
# where:
# n = the number of individuals of a single species
# N = the total number of individuals of all species
# Σ = the sum for all species

# A Simpson's Diversity Index of 0 can only be obtained under one condition:
# when the community contains only one species.
# Let's create a hypothetical scenario to prove this.

# Assume the student sampled for a month and found 42 bats, but they were all
# of the same species.
n = 42  # Number of individuals of the single species found.

# In this case, the total number of individuals (N) is also 42.
N = 42

# Let's calculate the components of the formula.
# The sum of n(n-1) for all species. Since there is only one species,
# this is just n * (n - 1).
sum_n_minus_1 = n * (n - 1)

# The total number of individuals (N) * (N - 1).
N_N_minus_1 = N * (N - 1)

# Now, calculate the Simpson's Diversity Index (D).
# First, we calculate the Simpson's Index (Lambda), which is the part in the parentheses.
lambda_index = sum_n_minus_1 / N_N_minus_1
D = 1 - lambda_index

# Print the results and the explanation.
