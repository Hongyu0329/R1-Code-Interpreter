    "Yes, it does follow that f = 0.\n\nMy plan is to prove this statement by using the properties of the Fourier transform. The core idea is to show that if all the moments of a function $f$ are zero, then all the derivatives of its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ at the origin must also be zero. Since the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is analytic, this implies that the Fourier transform is identically zero. Finally, because the Fourier transform is injective, the function $f$ itself must be zero.\n\nI will provide a Python script that uses the `sympy` library to symbolically walk through the steps of this proof. This script serves as an executable explanation of the mathematical reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import Function, Symbol, Integral, I, pi, oo, Derivative, Eq\n\ndef prove_moment_problem_solution():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step proof for the problem:\n    If a Schwartz class function f(x) has all its moments equal to zero,\n    does it follow that f = 0?\n    \n    The proof uses the properties of the Fourier transform.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Introduction to the problem and the method.\n    print(\"The problem asks whether a Schwartz function f(x) must be the zero function\")\n    print(\"if all its moments, Integral(x**k * f(x) dx), are zero for all non-negative integers k.\")\n    print(\"The answer is yes.
