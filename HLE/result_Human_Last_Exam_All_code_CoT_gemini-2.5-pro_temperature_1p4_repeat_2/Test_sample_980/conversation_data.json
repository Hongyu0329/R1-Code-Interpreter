    "Here is my plan to solve this puzzle.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the structure of the user's request. The request contains a sequence of numbers and asks for the next one. Crucially, it includes the instruction: \"Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\". This suggests that the solution is not just a single number, but an equation.\n\nSecond, I will examine the sequence itself. The numbers do not seem to follow a simple mathematical progression (e.g., arithmetic or geometric). Attempts to decode it as a text-based cipher (like ASCII sums) are common for such puzzles but can be complex and depend on finding the exact source text and encoding rule.\n\nThird, I will focus on the \"equation\" hint and the end of the sequence. The sequence ends with `..., 36, 124`. A simple and elegant interpretation is that these last two distinct numbers are the components of a simple equation to find the next number. Let's denote the numbers as `A` and `B`, and the unknown next number as `X`.\n\nMy hypothesis is that the sequence is setting up the problem `A + X = B`.\nThe last two distinct numbers that appear are 36 and 124. Therefore, I will set `A = 36` and `B = 124`.\n\nThe equation to solve is:\n`36 + X = 124`\n\nSolving for `X`:\n`X = 124 - 36`\n`X = 88`\n\nSo, the next number in the sequence is 88.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script that performs this calculation and prints the complete equation as requested by the user, showing all three numbers.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the next number in the sequence based on the hypothesis\n    that the last two distinct numbers form a simple equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The last part of the sequence suggests an equation.\n    # The two main numbers appear to be 36 and 124.\n    # Let's assume the equation is a + x = b.\n    a = 36\n    b = 124\n\n    # Solve for the unknown next number, x.\n    x = b - a\n\n    # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"{a} + {x} = {b}\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<88>>>"
