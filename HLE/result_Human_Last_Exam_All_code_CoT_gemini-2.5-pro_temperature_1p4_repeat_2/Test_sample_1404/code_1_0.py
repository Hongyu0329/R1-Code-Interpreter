# Step 1: Calculate arrangements for the large package (L)
# There are 9 distinct red candles for 9 horizontal positions (9!)
# and 9 distinct green candles for 9 vertical positions (9!).
# L = 9! * 9!

# Step 2: Calculate arrangements for the small package (S)
# There are 16 distinct candles (8 red, 8 green) for 16 horizontal positions.
# S = 16!
