    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structure of the Problem**: The problem asks for the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a specific conductor `d` and order `k`.\n    *   A character `χ` modulo `d` can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters `χ = ∏χ_p`, where `p` are the prime factors of `d`.\n    *   The character `χ` is primitive with conductor `d` if and only if `d` is square-free (which `d=53599` is) and each component character `χ_p` is non-principal (i.e., not the character that is always 1).\n    *   The order of `χ` is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters `χ_p`.\n\n2.  **Factorize Conductor and Order**:\n    *   First, I will find the prime factorization of the conductor `d = 53599`.\n    *   Then, I will find the distinct prime factors of the order, which is `6`.\n\n3.  **Use Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: The condition `lcm(ord(χ_p₁), ..., ord(χ_pₙ)) = 6` is complex to count directly. It's easier to count the number of characters where the order *divides* a certain number.\n    *   Let `N(k)` be the number of primitive characters with conductor `d` whose order divides `k`. The order of `χ = ∏χ_p` divides `k` if and only if the order of each `χ_p` divides `k`.\n    *   For a single prime `p`, the number of non-principal characters modulo `p` whose order divides `k` is `gcd(k, p-1) - 1`.\n    *   Therefore, `N(k) = ∏_p|d (gcd(k, p-1) - 1)`.\n    *   The number of characters of exact order 6 can be found using the inclusion-exclusion principle on the prime factors of 6 (which are 2 and 3):\n        *   `Number = N(6) - N(6/2) - N(6/3) + N(6/(2*3))`\n        *   `Number = N(6) - N(3) - N(2) + N(1)`\n\n4.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Performs the prime factorization of `d` and `order`.\n    *   Implements the formula for `N(k)`.\n    *   Applies the inclusion-exclusion principle to calculate the final count.\n    *   Prints out the steps of the calculation, including the factorization and the final equation used to get the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    order = 6\n\n    # Helper function for prime factorization\n    def get_prime_factorization(n):\n        factors = {}\n        num = 2\n        temp = n\n        while num * num <= temp:\n            while (temp % num) == 0:\n                factors[num] = factors.get(num, 0) + 1\n                temp //= num\n            num += 1\n        if temp > 1:\n            factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n        return factors\n\n    print(f\"Task: Find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order {order}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 1: Factorize the conductor d and order\n    d_factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    d_primes = sorted(d_factors.keys())\n    order_prime_factors = sorted(get_prime_factorization(order).keys())\n\n    print(f\"Step 1: Prime factorization of conductor d = {d}.\")\n    d_factors_str = \" * \".join([f\"{p}\" for p in d_primes])\n    print(f\"d = {d_factors_str}\")\n    print(f\"This is a square-free conductor.\\n\")\n    print(f\"Step 2: Use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion for order = {order}.\")\n    print(f\"The distinct prime factors of the order {order} are {order_prime_factors}.\")\n    print(\"Let N(k) be the number of primitive characters with conductor d whose order divides k.\")\n    print(\"The number of characters of order exactly 6 is N(6) - N(3) - N(2) + N(1).\\n\")\n    \n    # Function to calculate N(k)\n    def calculate_N_k(k, d_prime_list):\n        if k == 0: return 0\n        total_prod = 1\n        calc_strs = []\n        for p in d_prime_list:\n            # The number of non-principal characters mod p with order dividing k is gcd(k, p-1) - 1.\n            count_p = math.gcd(k, p - 1) - 1\n            calc_strs.append(str(count_p))\n            total_prod *= count_p\n        \n        print(f\"Calculating N({k}):\")\n        print(f\"  N({k}) = Product over p|d of (gcd({k}, p-1) - 1)\")\n        print(f\"       = {' * '.join(calc_strs)} = {total_prod}\")\n        return total_prod\n\n    # Step 3: Apply inclusion-exclusion\n    total_count = 0\n    equation_parts = []\n    \n    num_order_factors = len(order_prime_factors)\n    \n    # Iterate through all subsets of the order's prime factors\n    for i in range(1 << num_order_factors):\n        subset_prod = 1\n        num_items_in_subset = 0\n        for j in range(num_order_factors):\n            if (i >> j) & 1:\n                subset_prod *= order_prime_factors[j]\n                num_items_in_subset += 1\n        \n        sign = 1 if num_items_in_subset % 2 == 0 else -1\n        k = order // subset_prod\n        \n        term_val = calculate_N_k(k, d_primes)\n        \n        total_count += sign * term_val\n        \n        if sign == 1:\n            equation_parts.append(f\"+ {term_val}\")\n        else:\n            equation_parts.append(f\"- {term_val}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Final Result\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"Final Calculation:\")\n    final_equation = \" \".join(equation_parts).lstrip('+ ')\n    print(f\"Number of characters = {final_equation}\")\n    print(f\"                     = {total_count}\")\n    return total_count\n\n# Run the solver to get the final answer.\nfinal_answer = solve()\n<<<608>>>\n```"
