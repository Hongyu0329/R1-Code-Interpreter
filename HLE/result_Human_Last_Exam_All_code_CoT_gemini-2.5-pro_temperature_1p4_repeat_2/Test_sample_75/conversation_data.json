    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to find the start and end years of the Second Great War from StarCraft lore. Based on established lore timelines:\n*   The war is considered to have started with the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* in the year **2504**.\n*   While the main conflict against Amon concluded in 2506, the war was not formally declared over until **2508**, after the remaining hostile factions were pacified.\n\nNext, I will calculate the total duration by subtracting the start year from the end year. The problem asks for the result to be rounded up, which I will account for, although in this case the result is a whole number.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script that defines these years, performs the subtraction, and prints the equation and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# According to StarCraft lore, the Second Great War began in 2504\n# and was formally declared over in 2508.\nstart_year = 2504\nend_year = 2508\n\n# Calculate the duration\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# The request is to round up, though the result is a whole number.\n# We will apply math.ceil() for correctness as per the prompt.\nfinal_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\n# Print the final equation and result\nprint(f\"The Second Great War in StarCraft lore started in the year {start_year} and officially ended in {end_year}.\")\nprint(f\"The calculation for the duration is: {end_year} - {start_year} = {duration}\")\nprint(f\"The total duration was {final_duration} years.\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
