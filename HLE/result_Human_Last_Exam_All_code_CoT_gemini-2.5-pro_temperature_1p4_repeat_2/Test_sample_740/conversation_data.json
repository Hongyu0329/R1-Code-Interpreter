    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, I will analyze the given integral equation `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y)`.\n2.  The kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, is a separable (or degenerate) kernel, which can be expressed as a sum of products of functions of `x` and `y`: `K(x,y) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`.\n3.  This structure implies that the solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. I will express `u(x)` as `u(x) = a₀ + a₁x + ... + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}`.\n4.  Substituting this polynomial form back into the integral equation will convert it into a system of `n` linear algebraic equations for the `n` unknown coefficients `a₀, ..., a_{n-1}`.\n5.  This system can be written in the matrix form `(I - λM)a = f`, where `I` is the identity matrix, `a` is the vector of coefficients, `f` is a vector derived from the constant term `1` in the equation, and `M` is an `n x n` matrix that represents the integral operator in the chosen basis. I will derive the elements of this matrix `M` as `M_{ij} = 1/(n+j-i)` for `i,j = 0, ..., n-1`.\n6.  According to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this system has no solution for `a` if `det(I - λM) = 0` and the vector `f` is not in the range of the operator `(I - λM)`. The first condition means `1/λ` must be an eigenvalue of the matrix `M`. The second condition can be checked by ensuring `f` is not orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint operator.\n7.  I will show that the second condition holds, meaning that for any `λ` that is a reciprocal of an eigenvalue of `M`, the equation has no solution.\n8.  Since finding a symbolic formula for the eigenvalues of `M` for a general `n` is a very hard problem, I will provide a Python script that numerically computes these eigenvalues for a given `n` and thus finds the corresponding values of `λ`. The code will demonstrate the calculation for `n=1, 2, 3`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_lambda_values_with_no_solution(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solution.\n\n    The problem is reduced to finding the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of a\n    specific matrix M.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The integer parameter n from the integral equation.\n\n    Returns:\n        numpy.ndarray: An array containing the complex values of λ.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Based on the analysis, the critical values of λ are the reciprocals\n    # of the eigenvalues of the matrix M, where M_ij = 1/(n + j - i).\n    # i denotes the row index (from 0 to n-1) and j the column index (from 0 to n-1).\n    M = np.array([[1.0 / (n + j - i) for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)])\n\n    # Calculate the eigenvalues of the matrix M.\n    try:\n        eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(M)\n    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n        print(f\"Error: Eigenvalue computation failed for n={n}.
