def calculate_packing_radius():
    """
    Calculates the radius of a circle tightly packing fourteen unit circles.

    The problem of finding the densest packing of N circles in a larger circle
    is a well-studied problem in mathematics. For N=14, the optimal arrangement
    is complex and was proven by F. Fodor in 2003.

    This function uses the results from that proof. In the optimal configuration,
    the large circle is centered at the origin (0,0). One of the 14 small circles
    (with radius r=1) is positioned on the x-axis, and its center is the furthest
    from the origin among all circle centers that are part of the packing boundary.
    The distance of this center from the origin determines the radius of the
    enclosing circle.

    # From the known optimal solution for N=14, the distance from the origin to the
