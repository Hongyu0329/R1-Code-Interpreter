    print("Problem: High genetic differentiation (Fst) is found at some, but not all, genetic markers between males and females of the same population.")
    print("\nAnalysis Steps:")
    print("1. Fst measures genetic divergence. A high Fst here means allele frequencies differ significantly between the sexes for specific genes.")
    print("2. Since males and females are in the same interbreeding population, explanations based on geographic separation or barriers between different populations (C, D, E) are unlikely.")
    print("3. Let's evaluate the most relevant options:")
    print("   - A. Genetic Load: While selection might act differently on the sexes, genetic load itself is not a direct cause of fixed genetic differentiation at specific loci between them.")
    print("   - B. XY vs ZW sex determining systems: This is the most direct cause.")
    print("     - In an XY system, males have a Y chromosome that females lack.")
    print("     - In a ZW system, females have a W chromosome that males lack.")
    print("     - Therefore, any marker unique to the Y or W chromosome will be present in one sex and absent in the other.")
    print("     - This results in maximum possible differentiation (Fst = 1) for those specific markers (the sex-specific region of the Y or W chromosome).")
    print("     - Markers on shared sex chromosomes (like X or Z) will also show differentiation due to differences in copy number (hemizygosity) and effective population size between sexes.")
    print("     - Markers on autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) would be inherited equally and show Fst â‰ˆ 0.")
    print("\nConclusion: The presence of sex chromosomes that differ between males and females is the clear explanation for why *some* markers exhibit pronounced differentiation.")
