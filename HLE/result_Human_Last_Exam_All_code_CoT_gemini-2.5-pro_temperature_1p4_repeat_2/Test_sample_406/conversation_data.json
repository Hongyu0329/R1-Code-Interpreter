    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a point `(x, y, z)` that remains unchanged after the application of three functions, F, G, and H, in a specific manner. Here are the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point, followed by a Python script to demonstrate the concept.\n\n### My thinking steps\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:**\n    *   **Functions:** The user specifies `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y`, and `G:Z*Y*X→Z`. The repetition of `G` is likely a typo for `H` in `H:Z*Y*X→Z`, as \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" is a more standard term in the mathematical literature. I will proceed with this assumption.\n    *   **Goal:** Find the \"conditions\" for these functions to have a tripled fixed point.\n    *   **Task:** Explain the conditions and provide a Python script to illustrate them.\n\n2.  **Identify the Mathematical Concept:**\n    *   This problem belongs to the field of *Fixed-Point Theory*.\n    *   An FGH-tripled fixed point is a point `(x, y, z)` in the product space `X × Y × Z` that satisfies the system of equations:\n        *   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n        *   `G(y, x, y) = y`\n        *   `H(z, y, x) = z`\n    *   The core condition for the existence and uniqueness of such a point is a generalization of the famous **Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Conditions:**\n    *   **The Setting:** We consider `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` to be **complete metric spaces**. A metric space is a set with a notion of distance, and \"complete\" means that any sequence of points that get progressively closer to each other will converge to a point within the space. The real numbers (`R`) with the absolute difference as the distance metric (`d(a, b) = |a - b|`) is a classic example.\n    *   **The Operator:** We can combine the three functions into a single operator `T` that maps a triplet to another triplet:\n        `T(x, y, z) = ( F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x) )`\n        This operator `T` maps the product space `X × Y × Z` to itself. An FGH-tripled fixed point is simply a fixed point of this operator `T`, i.e., `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`.\n    *   **The Main Condition (Contraction Mapping):** The Banach Fixed-Point Theorem states that if `T` is a **contraction mapping** on a complete metric space, it has a unique fixed point. For our operator `T` to be a contraction, there must exist a constant `k` with `0 ≤ k < 1` such that for any two points `(x1, y1, z1)` and `(x2, y2, z2)`:\n        `distance(T(x1, y1, z1), T(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ k * distance((x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2))`\n    *   **The Condition Spelled Out:** Using a standard distance metric on the product space (like the sum of individual distances), the condition becomes:\n        `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) + d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) + d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2))   ≤   k * (d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2))`\n        In simple terms, applying the functions `F, G, H` must bring any two points in the space closer together.\n\n4.  **Plan the Python Demonstration:**\n    *   I will use the real numbers (`R`) for `X`, `Y`, and `Z`.\n    *   I'll define simple linear functions for `F`, `G`, and `H` that are guaranteed to satisfy the contraction condition.\n    *   The script will use an iterative method to find the fixed point:\n        1.  Start with an initial guess `(x_0, y_0, z_0)`.\n        2.  Repeatedly apply the operator: `(x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}, z_{n+1}) = T(x_n, y_n, z_n)`.\n        3.  The sequence will converge to the unique fixed point.\n    *   Finally, the script will display the converged values and verify that they satisfy the fixed-point equations, printing each number in the final equations as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef F(x, y, z):\n    \"\"\"\n    Function F: X * Y * Z -> X.\n    We use X=Y=Z=R (real numbers).\n    \"\"\"\n    return 0.1 * x + 0.1 * y + 0.1 * z + 1\n\ndef G(y_arg1, x_arg, y_arg2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Function G: Y * X * Y -> Y.\n    In the fixed-point system, this is called as G(y, x, y).\n    \"\"\"\n    return 0.1 * y_arg1 + 0.1 * x_arg + 0.1 * y_arg2 + 2\n\ndef H(z_arg, y_arg, x_arg):\n    \"\"\"\n    Function H: Z * Y * X -> Z.\n    \"\"\"\n    return 0.1 * z_arg + 0.1 * y_arg + 0.1 * x_arg + 3\n\ndef find_fgh_tripled_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the FGH-tripled fixed point using an iterative method.\n    An FGH-tripled fixed point (x,y,z) satisfies:\n      x = F(x, y, z)\n      y = G(y, x, y)\n      z = H(z, y, x)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initial guess for the fixed point\n    x, y, z = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0\n\n    # Number of iterations.
