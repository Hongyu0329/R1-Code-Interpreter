# The problem describes a hypothetical algorithm A which provides a
# deterministic fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) reduction from the
# Dominating Set problem (W[2]-complete) to the #IndependentSet problem (#W[1]-complete).
# The existence of such a powerful algorithm for an NP-hard problem like Dominating Set
# is expected to have significant consequences for classical complexity classes.
#
# A key theorem in parameterized complexity states that the Dominating Set problem
# does not have a polynomial-size kernel (a form of efficient preprocessing)
# unless the polynomial hierarchy (PH) collapses.
#
# While not a direct proof, it is a very strong and standard line of reasoning
# in complexity theory that an algorithmic tool as powerful as the hypothesized
# reduction A could be used to construct such a polynomial kernel for Dominating Set.
#
# Therefore, the most logical consequence of the existence of algorithm A among the
# given choices is the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy.

# The reasoning leads to option D.
# The code below will print the final answer as requested.
# The question itself is a multiple-choice question about theoretical computer science.
# No equation is provided in the problem statement, so the instruction
# "output each number in the final equation" seems to be a template error and is not applicable here.
