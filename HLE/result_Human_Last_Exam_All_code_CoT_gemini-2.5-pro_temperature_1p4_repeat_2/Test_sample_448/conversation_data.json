    "To determine the rarest noble gas on Earth, we need to compare the abundance of all noble gases. The plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Noble Gases:** The noble gases are Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn).\n2.  **Gather Abundance Data:** I will use data for the abundance of these gases in Earth's atmosphere. While the question asks for abundance in \"all terrestrial matter,\" atmospheric concentrations are a well-documented and standard proxy for comparing the relative rarity of these gases. The order of rarity in the atmosphere reflects their overall rarity on Earth. Radon, a product of radioactive decay with a very short half-life, has an exceptionally low steady-state concentration everywhere, making it the rarest. The abundance values for these elements have not changed meaningfully since 2002.\n3.  **Code the Comparison:** I will write a Python script that stores these abundance values in a dictionary. The script will then iterate through the data to show the numbers being compared and use the `min()` function to identify the gas with the lowest percentage.\n4.  **Output the Result:** The script will print the name and percentage of the rarest noble gas found.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the rarest noble gas by comparing their atmospheric abundances.\n    \n    Data represents the abundance of noble gases in Earth's atmosphere.\n    While the query asks for abundance in \"all terrestrial matter,\" atmospheric\n    abundance is a well-documented and standard proxy for comparing the relative\n    rarity of these gases. Radon's extreme rarity is due to its short\n    half-life as a product of radioactive decay, making its steady-state\n    concentration minuscule throughout all terrestrial domains.\n    The abundances are given in percent by volume of the atmosphere.\n    The 2002 date doesn't significantly change these well-established values.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Abundance of noble gases as a percentage of Earth's atmosphere by volume.\n    noble_gas_abundance_percent = {\n        'Helium': 0.000524,\n        'Neon': 0.001818,\n        'Argon': 0.934,\n        'Krypton': 0.000114,\n        'Xenon': 0.0000087,\n        # Radon's abundance is highly variable and extremely low. An average\n        # atmospheric mole fraction is ~6e-18, which is 6e-16 percent.\n        'Radon': 6e-16 \n    }\n\n    print(\"Comparing the abundance of noble gases in Earth's atmosphere (% by volume):\")\n    \n    # This loop outputs each number used in the comparison, as requested.\n    # We use a format that can display very small numbers for Radon.\n    for gas, percentage in noble_gas_abundance_percent.items():\n        # Using 'g' format for clean printing of both large and small numbers.\n        print(f\"- {gas}: {percentage:g}%\")\n\n    # Find the rarest gas by identifying the key with the minimum value in the dictionary.\n    rarest_gas = min(noble_gas_abundance_percent, key=noble_gas_abundance_percent.get)\n    rarest_gas_percentage = noble_gas_abundance_percent[rarest_gas]\n\n    print(f\"\\nBased on this data, the rarest noble gas is {rarest_gas}.\")\n    print(f\"Its abundance is approximately {rarest_gas_percentage:g}% of the atmosphere.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_rarest_noble_gas()\n\n```\n<<<Radon>>>"
