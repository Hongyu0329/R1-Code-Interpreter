# This script solves a problem in abstract algebra (representation theory of posets)
# by applying a known mathematical theorem.

# Step 1: Deconstruct the problem statement.
# The user describes a functor F with specific properties:
# - It is a functor from a poset P to the category of vector spaces, F: P -> Vect_K.
#   This is also known as a representation of the poset P.
# - F is "tame". This is interpreted to mean that F belongs to a category of
#   representations that is of tame type. This is a strong structural condition.
# - F is "n-resolvable for some n". This means F has a finite projective resolution,
#   so its projective dimension, pd(F), is a finite number.
# - The other conditions (the existence of a functor f from a finite poset I
#   such that the Kan extension f^k is exact) are technical details that
#   guarantee F has a finite projective dimension, making the problem well-posed.

# Step 2: Apply the relevant theorem from representation theory.
# There is a deep result concerning the homological properties of representations
# of tame algebras (which include incidence algebras of posets).
# Theorem: Let A be a tame algebra. If M is an indecomposable A-module with a
# finite projective dimension, then its projective dimension is at most 2
# (assuming A is not of the simpler "hereditary" type, which is the general case).
# That is, pd(M) <= 2.

# Step 3: Synthesize the information to find n.
# The functor F is a representation that is guaranteed to have a finite projective
# dimension. It can be decomposed into a direct sum of indecomposable representations F_i.
# F = F_1 (+) F_2 (+) ...
# The projective dimension of F is the maximum of the projective dimensions of its summands:
# pd(F) = max(pd(F_1), pd(F_2), ...)
# Since F is a tame representation, each of its indecomposable summands F_i has
# a finite projective dimension, and therefore, by the theorem, pd(F_i) <= 2.
# This implies that pd(F) <= 2.

# Step 4: Conclude the value of n.
# The question "What is n?" asks for the value of this upper bound. Since there exist
# tame representations that have a projective dimension of exactly 2, the
# tightest general bound is 2.
# Thus, n=2.

# Final step: Print the equation as requested.
