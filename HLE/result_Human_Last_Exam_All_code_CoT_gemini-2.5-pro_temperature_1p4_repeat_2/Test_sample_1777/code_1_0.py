n_target = 3     # Principal quantum number for the target state

# Step 1: Calculate the binding energy of the 1s exciton (E_b_1s)
# The relationship is: Exciton Energy = Band Gap - Binding Energy
# So, Binding Energy = Band Gap - Exciton Energy
E_b_1s = E_g - E_1s

# Step 2: Calculate the effective Rydberg energy (R_y*) for the 2D material
# For a 2D exciton, the binding energy is E_b_n = R_y* / (n - 0.5)^2
# From the 1s state, we can find R_y*: R_y* = E_b_1s * (n - 0.5)^2

# Step 3: Calculate the Rydberg energy (binding energy) for n=3
# Use the calculated R_y* and the same formula for n=3
E_b_3 = effective_rydberg / (n_target - 0.5)**2
