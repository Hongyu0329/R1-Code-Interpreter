    # Step 1: Determine delta, the order type of X.
    # X is the set of possible cardinalities of the power set of the natural numbers.
    # The conditions imply X = {aleph_lambda | lambda is a limit ordinal and omega <= lambda < omega_2}.
    # The order type of this set, delta, corresponds to the order type of the set of indices,
    # {lambda | lambda is a limit ordinal and omega <= lambda < omega_2}.
    # This set of limit ordinals has an order type of omega_2.
    delta = "omega_2"

    # Step 2: Determine gamma, the cofinality of the cardinality of the power set of natural numbers.
    # gamma = cf(2^omega).
    # Since 2^omega is in X, it has the form aleph_lambda for omega <= lambda < omega_2.
    # gamma = cf(aleph_lambda) = cf(lambda).
    # Since lambda < omega_2, cf(lambda) is a regular cardinal < omega_2.
    # The possible values are omega and omega_1.
    # By Konig's Theorem, cf(2^omega) > omega.
    # Therefore, gamma must be omega_1.
    gamma = "omega_1"

    # Step 3: Calculate the ordinal sum delta + gamma.
    # The result is an ordinal sum, which is not commutative.
