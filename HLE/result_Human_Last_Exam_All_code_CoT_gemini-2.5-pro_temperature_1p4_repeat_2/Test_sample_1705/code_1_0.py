    Solves the mathematical problem regarding the Lebesgue measure of the set S.

    The problem asks for the Lebesgue measure of the set S of points x_0 in [0,1]
    such that the sequence x_{n+1} = f(x_n) with f(x) = (2x + sin(2*pi*x))/3
    contains exactly 7 distinct values.

    1. For the sequence {x_n} to have a finite number of distinct values, it must
       be eventually periodic.
    2. The condition of having exactly 7 distinct values means that x_0, x_1, ..., x_6
       are all distinct, and x_7 = x_k for some k in {0, 1, ..., 6}.
    3. This means that for any x_0 in S, x_0 must satisfy the equation f^7(x_0) = f^k(x_0)
       for some k in {0, 1, ..., 6}.
    4. The function f(x) is an analytic function. Any iterate f^n(x) is also analytic.
       The difference g_k(x) = f^7(x) - f^k(x) is also an analytic function.
    5. An analytic function that is not identically zero can only have a countable number
       of roots. The functions g_k(x) are not identically zero since their derivatives
       are not identically zero.
    6. The set S is a subset of the union of the roots of g_0(x),...,g_6(x). This union
       is a countable set.
    7. In measure theory, any countable set of real numbers has a Lebesgue measure of 0.
    8. Therefore, the Lebesgue measure of S is 0.
    9. The question asks for this measure multiplied by 10^6, which is 0 * 10^6 = 0.
