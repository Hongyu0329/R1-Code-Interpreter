    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the person from the provided clues.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the key phrases in the user's request:\n1.  **\"Andrei Voznesensky\"**: The author of the quote. This points to a subject relevant to Russian culture.\n2.  **\"a joy-discovering sailor\"**: A poetic description of the man's character and profession as an explorer or sailor.\n3.  **\"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"**: This indicates the man's burial place was unknown or lost for a long time.\n4.  **\"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s\"**: This provides a timeframe for the rediscovery or popularization of the man's story and fate.\n\nThese clues point to Nikolai Rezanov. Voznesensky's most famous work, the rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" is about Rezanov's life. The opera contains the lines you quoted and became a massive cultural phenomenon in the Soviet Union during the late 1980s, bringing Rezanov's story and the mystery of his lost grave back into the public consciousness. The following script will confirm this and print his last name.\n\n```python\ndef find_historical_figure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies a historical figure based on a set of clues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clues provided in the query\n    poet = \"Andrei Voznesensky\"\n    description = \"a joy-discovering sailor\"\n    grave_mystery_quote = \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"\n    time_frame = \"late 1980s\"\n\n    # Analysis based on the clues\n    # The poem is from the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\".\n    # The opera is about the Russian diplomat and explorer Nikolai Rezanov.\n    # Rezanov's grave in Krasnoyarsk was lost, and Voznesensky's work revived public interest in his fate,\n    # effectively providing a cultural \"answer\" in the 1980s.\n    last_name = \"Rezanov\"\n\n    print(f\"The man described by the poet {poet} is identified as Nikolai Rezanov.\")\n    print(f\"The last name is: {last_name}\")\n\nfind_historical_figure()\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
