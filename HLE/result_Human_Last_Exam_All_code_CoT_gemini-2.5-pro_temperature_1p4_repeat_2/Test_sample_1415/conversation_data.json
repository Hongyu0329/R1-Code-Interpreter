    "My plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will solve the integral analytically. The integrand is of the form `f'(x)/f(x)`. The integral of `f'(x)/f(x)` is `ln|f(x)|`.\n2.  The definite integral from 0 to 1 is given by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n    `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1 = `[ln(F₃(x))]` from 0 to 1.\n3.  This evaluates to `ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`, which simplifies to `ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0))`.\n4.  Next, I need to compute the values of `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)`.\n    *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n    *   For x = 0: `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`.\n    *   For x = 1: `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`.\n5.  Let `V` be the value of the integral. Then `V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2))`.\n6.  Finally, I will use a Python script to compute the numerical value of `V` and then find the closest integer to `10000 * V`. The script will also print the numerical values for `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` which are the numbers in the final equation for V.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the function F3(x)\ndef f3(x):\n  \"\"\"Calculates the value of F3(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\"\"\"\n  return math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(x)))\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the values of F3(1) and F3(0)\n# These are the numbers in the final equation V = ln(F3(1)/F3(0))\nf3_at_1 = f3(1)\nf3_at_0 = f3(0)\n\nprint(f\"The integral is ln(F3(1)/F3(0))\")\nprint(f\"Value of F3(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))): {f3_at_1}\")\nprint(f\"Value of F3(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))): {f3_at_0}\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the value of the integral V\n# V = ln(F3(1) / F3(0))\nV = math.log(f3_at_1 / f3_at_0)\nprint(f\"The value of the integral V is: {V}\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final result as the closest integer to 10000 * V\nresult = round(10000 * V)\nprint(f\"The closest integer to 10000 * V is: {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<5487>>>"
