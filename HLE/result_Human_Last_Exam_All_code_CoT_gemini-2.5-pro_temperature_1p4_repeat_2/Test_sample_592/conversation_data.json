    "My plan is to first identify the key information from your request: the movie title (\"Ovosodo\"), the character's name (\"Tommaso\"), and the question (which US city he moves to). I will then search for the plot summary of the movie to find this specific detail. Finally, I will write a Python script that stores this information in variables and prints the answer in a clear, formatted sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_city_in_movie():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the answer to the user's question\n    about the movie 'Ovosodo'.\n    \"\"\"\n    movie_title = \"Ovosodo\"\n    year = 1997\n    character_name = \"Tommaso\"\n    destination_city = \"Philadelphia\"\n\n    print(f\"In the {year} movie '{movie_title}', the character {character_name} moves to the US city of {destination_city}.\")\n\nfind_city_in_movie()\n```\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"
