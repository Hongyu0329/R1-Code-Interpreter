def solve_anomaly_implication():
    """
    Analyzes the physical implication of the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition.

    The 't Hooft anomaly matching condition requires that the anomaly for a global
    symmetry calculated in the UV (high-energy) theory must be reproduced by the
    low-energy (IR) effective theory.

    This has a major physical implication: it serves as a powerful, non-perturbative
    consistency check on any proposed IR theory. If the IR theory's degrees of
    freedom (e.g., composite particles) cannot match the known anomaly of the
    fundamental UV theory (e.g., quarks), then the proposed IR theory is invalid.

    Therefore, the most fundamental implication is that the condition imposes a
    strong constraint on the structure and content of low-energy effective theories.
