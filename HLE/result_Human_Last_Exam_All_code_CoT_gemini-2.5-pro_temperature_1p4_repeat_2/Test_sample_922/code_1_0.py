    Solves the Stand-up Maths sequence puzzle from August 2022.
    
    The sequence is generated from solutions to the equation x³+y³+z³ = k*d³,
    where k is a prime number such that k ≡ 1 (mod 3).
    
    The sequence given is: 24663, 35005, 119261, 196219, 211770, 227296
    
    The corresponding k values are: 7, 13, 19, 31, 37, 43.
    
    The next k in the sequence is 61.
