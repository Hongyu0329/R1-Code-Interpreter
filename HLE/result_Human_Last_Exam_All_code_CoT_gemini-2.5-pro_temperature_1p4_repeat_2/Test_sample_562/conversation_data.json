    "My plan is to identify the radical for the character 謄 and then find the specific name for that radical based on its position within the character.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Character:** The character 謄 is composed of two parts. The left part is 言, and the right part is 滕 without the ⺼.\n2.  **Identify the Radical:** In Japanese characters, the radical (or *bushu*) is the component by which the character is indexed in a dictionary. For characters with a left-right structure, the radical is very often the left-hand component. In this case, the radical is 言, which means \"speech\" or \"words\".\n3.  **Determine the Radical's Name:** Radicals are often given specific names based on their form and position. When the radical 言 appears on the left side of a character (a position called *hen*), its name is ごんべん (*gonben*).\n4.  **Provide the Hepburn Transcription:** The Hepburn romanization for ごんべん is \"Gonben\". I will write a Python script to print this name.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to find the name of the radical for the Japanese character 謄.\n# 1. The character is 謄.\n# 2. The radical for this character is 言 (word, speech).\n# 3. When this radical appears on the left side of a character, it is called ごんべん (gonben).\n# 4. The Hepburn transcription for ごんべん is \"Gonben\".\n# This script will print the final answer.\n\nradical_name = \"Gonben\"\nprint(radical_name)\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
