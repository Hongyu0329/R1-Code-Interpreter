    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length 333 with exactly 3 inversions. Let this number be \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\).\n\nA permutation is a 1324-avoiding permutation if there are no indices `i < j < k < l` such that `p_i < p_k < p_j < p_l`.\nAn inversion is a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `p_i > p_j`.\n\nA key insight is that permutations with a small number of inversions have a very structured form. The elements involved in inversions typically form a compact block of consecutive integers. For any other arrangement, additional inversions are introduced.\n\nWe can classify the permutations of length `n` with 3 inversions and then count how many of them are 1324-avoiding.\n\nA permutation that avoids the `132` pattern is guaranteed to avoid the `1324` pattern. This is because if a permutation contains no subsequence `a, c, b` with `a < b < c`, it cannot contain `a, c, b, d` with `a < b < c < d`.\n\nIf a permutation *does* contain a `132` pattern (`p_i < p_k < p_j` for `i<j<k`), it will contain a `1324` pattern if there is any element `p_l > p_j` at a position `l > k`. To avoid `1324`, all elements appearing after the `132` pattern must be smaller than the '3' of the pattern. This severely restricts the structure of such permutations, typically forcing the `132` pattern to involve the largest elements at the end of the permutation.\n\nLet's enumerate the types of permutations of length `n` with 3 inversions:\n\n1.  **Type `...cba...`**: Permutations formed by reversing a block of 3 consecutive numbers `{i, i+1, i+2}`. The permutation is `1 ... (i-1) (i+2)(i+1)i (i+3) ... n`.\n    These permutations are `132`-avoiding, and thus `1324`-avoiding.\n    The number of such permutations is the number of possible choices for `i`, which is `n-2`.\n\n2.  **Type `...dabc...`**: Permutations formed by arranging 4 consecutive numbers `{i, ..., i+3}` as `(i+3)i(i+1)(i+2)`.\n    These permutations are `132`-avoiding, thus `1324`-avoiding.\n    The number of choices for `i` is `n-3`.\n\n3.  **Type `...bcda...`**: Permutations formed by arranging 4 consecutive numbers `{i, ..., i+3}` as `(i+1)(i+2)(i+3)i`.\n    These are also `132`-avoiding and thus `1324`-avoiding.\n    The number of choices for `i` is `n-3`.\n\n4.  **Type `...bdac...`**: Permutations formed by arranging 4 consecutive numbers `{i, ..., i+3}` as `(i+1)(i+3)i(i+2)`. This pattern contains a `132` subsequence. It avoids `1324` only if the four numbers are the largest in the permutation, i.e., `{n-3, n-2, n-1, n}`. This corresponds to a single choice of `i = n-3`. There is **1** such permutation.\n\n5.  **Type `...cadb...`**: Permutations formed by arranging 4 consecutive numbers `{i, ..., i+3}` as `(i+2)i(i+3)(i+1)`. This pattern also contains `132`. It avoids `1324` only if the four numbers are the largest, i.e., `i = n-3`. There is **1** such permutation.\n\n6.  **Type `2+1` (disjoint blocks)**: Permutations with two blocks of inversions, one with 2 inversions and one with 1. For example, `... (i+2)i(i+1) ... (j+1)j ...`. This structure contains a `132` pattern. It avoids `1324` only if the second block is `{n-1, n}`. Then `j=n-1`. The first block based on `{i,i+1,i+2}` can be chosen in `n-4` ways (since `i+2 < j=n-1`). So there are `n-4` such permutations.\n\n7.  **Type `1+1+1` (three disjoint swaps)**: Permutations like `...(b)a...(d)c...(f)e...`. This structure almost always creates a `1324` pattern. For instance, `214365` contains the `1324` pattern `1436`. Thus, there are **0** such permutations that avoid `1324`.\n\nNow, we substitute `n = 333` into these formulas and sum the results.\n- Count for type 1: `333 - 2 = 331`\n- Count for type 2: `333 - 3 = 330`\n- Count for type 3: `333 - 3 = 330`\n- Count for type 4: `1`\n- Count for type 5: `1`\n- Count for type 6: `333 - 4 = 329`\n\nThe total number is the sum of these counts.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates av_{333}^3(1324), the number of 1324-avoiding permutations\n    of length 333 with 3 inversions.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 333\n\n    # Case 1: Permutations with a ...cba... structure on 3 consecutive elements.\n    # These are 132-avoiding.
