    "To determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed to identify a PLL case, we need to find the smallest number of stickers that can distinguish between the most similar-looking cases. There are 21 distinct PLL permutations.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Problem:** We are looking for the minimum number of side-stickers on the last layer that must be observed to uniquely identify any PLL case. This is a \"worst-case\" problem, where we need to find the information required to solve the most difficult-to-distinguish cases.\n2.  **Prove that 3 Stickers are Insufficient:** I will show an example of two different PLL cases that can look identical if you only observe 3 stickers. The F-perm and Y-perm are a classic example of this. From one angle, both can show \"headlights\" (two corner stickers of the same color) with the edge sticker between them having the color of the opposite face. Seeing these three stickers is not enough to know which case you have.\n3.  **Prove that 4 Stickers are Sufficient:** I will demonstrate that by observing one additional, strategically chosen sticker, we can resolve the ambiguity from the previous step. For the F/Y perm case, looking at just one corner sticker on the back face is enough to tell if the back is solved (Y-perm) or swapped (F-perm). This logic extends to other ambiguous pairs of cases as well.\n4.  **Construct Python Code:** I will write a Python script that explains this logic step-by-step using `print()` statements and displays the final calculation and answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_pll_sticker_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains and calculates the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers\n    required to be seen to fully identify any PLL case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the problem context.\n    print(\"### The Problem ###\")\n    print(\"On a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, the PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer) stage is the final step in the CFOP method.\")\n    print(\"At this point, the top face is a solid color, and we must permute the last layer pieces without changing their top orientation.\")\n    print(\"To execute the correct algorithm, one must first identify which of the 21 PLL cases they are looking at.\")\n    print(\"This identification is done by observing the pattern of stickers on the vertical sides of the last layer pieces.\")\n    print(\"\\nQuestion: What is the minimum number of these stickers one must see to guarantee the case is identified?\")\n    sys.stdout.flush()\n\n    # Step 2: Show that 3 stickers are not enough by finding a counterexample.\n    print(\"\\n### Analysis Part 1: Proving 3 Stickers are NOT Enough ###\")\n    print(\"Let's consider two similar-looking cases: the F-perm and the Y-perm.\")\n    print(\"Both can be oriented so that the front face displays 'headlights' (the two corner stickers have the same color).\")\n    print(\"Furthermore, in this orientation for both perms, the edge sticker between the headlights has the color of the back face.\")\n    print(\"Observing these 3 stickers (2 for the headlights + 1 for the edge) is insufficient to distinguish an F-perm from a Y-perm.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the minimum required number of stickers must be greater than 3.\")\n    sys.stdout.flush()\n    \n    # Step 3: Show that 4 stickers are sufficient by resolving the ambiguity.\n    print(\"\\n### Analysis Part 2: Proving 4 Stickers are Sufficient ###\")\n    print(\"To resolve the ambiguity between the F-perm and Y-perm, we need one more piece of information.\")\n    print(\"The key difference is on the back face: a Y-perm has solved corners on the back, while an F-perm has swapped corners.\")\n    print(\"We don't need to see the whole back face; we only need to check the status of one back corner.\")\n    print(\"By observing just one of the back corner's side-stickers, we can tell if it is in a solved position or not.\")\n    print(\"This single extra sticker provides the necessary information to distinguish the two cases.\")\n    sys.stdout.flush()\n\n    # Step 4: Present the final calculation in the form of an equation.\n    print(\"\\n### The Calculation for the Worst-Case Scenario ###\")\n    print(\"We can represent this recognition process with a simple equation:\")\n    stickers_for_headlights = 2\n    stickers_for_front_edge = 1\n    stickers_for_back_check = 1\n    total_stickers = stickers_for_headlights + stickers_for_front_edge + stickers_for_back_check\n    \n    print(f\"{stickers_for_headlights} (to see front headlights) + {stickers_for_front_edge} (to see front edge) + {stickers_for_back_check} (to check one back corner) = {total_stickers}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis logic applies to other difficult cases as well. Therefore, 4 stickers are sufficient.\")\n    sys.stdout.flush()\n\nsolve_pll_sticker_puzzle()\n<<<4>>>\n```"
