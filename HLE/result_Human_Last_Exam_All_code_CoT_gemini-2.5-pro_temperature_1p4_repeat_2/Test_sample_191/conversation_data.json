    "My plan is to identify the specific protein involved in the immune response to amyloid plaques, focusing on the process of opsonization, where a target is marked for ingestion by phagocytic cells like macrophages. The key is finding the protein that is cleaved or \"broken down\" to create the signal for engulfment. Based on my knowledge of immunology and neurodegenerative diseases, this points to a component of the complement system. I will write a Python script that states the name of this protein and provides a brief explanation of its mechanism.\n\n```python\ndef solve_amyloid_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the role of the protein that,\n    when broken down, facilitates macrophage engulfment of amyloid.\n    \"\"\"\n    protein_name = \"Complement component 3 (C3)\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"The protein that is broken down (cleaved) to allow for macrophage \"\n        f\"engulfment of amyloid is {protein_name}. \\n\\n\"\n        \"When the complement system is activated by amyloid plaques, C3 is cleaved into C3a and C3b. \"\n        \"The C3b fragment then coats the surface of the amyloid, a process called opsonization. \"\n        \"This C3b tag is recognized by complement receptors on macrophages, signaling them to engulf and clear the amyloid.\"\n    )\n    print(explanation)\n    \n    # The final answer in the required format.\n    final_answer = \"Complement component 3\"\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\nsolve_amyloid_question()\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
