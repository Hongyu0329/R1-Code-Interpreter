def solve_closepact_problem():
    """
    Analyzes which of the given sets are necessarily closepact subsets of themselves.

    The method is based on the following key insights:
    1.  The property "closepact in itself" is equivalent to the topological property of being "H-closed".
    2.  For metric spaces (which all the examples are), a space is H-closed if and only if it is compact.
    3.  For subsets of Euclidean space (R, C), the Heine-Borel theorem states that a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.

    Therefore, the problem is reduced to checking which of the given sets are necessarily closed and bounded.
