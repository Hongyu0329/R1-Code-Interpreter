    print("1. The set S is defined as S = {(|<y_1, s>|^2, ..., |<y_n, s>|^2) | ||s||=1, s in span{y_i}}.")
    print("2. Let beta_j = <y_j, s>. Then the coordinates of a point x in S are x_j = beta_j^2.")
    print("3. The vector beta = (beta_1, ..., beta_n) is constrained by the equation: beta^T * G^(-1) * beta = 1.")
    print("   Here, G is the Gram matrix of the vectors {y_i}, with G_ij = <y_i, y_j>.")

    print("a) If {y_i} are orthogonal, the Gram matrix G and its inverse G^(-1) are diagonal.")
    print("   The constraint simplifies to a linear equation: sum(x_j / ||y_j||^2) = 1.")
    print("   This defines a simplex in the non-negative orthant. So, the shape can be a simplex.")

    print("b) For the general case with n=2 and non-orthogonal vectors, the equation for S can be shown to be a quadratic equation in x_1 and x_2.")
    print("   Since S is a bounded set, this equation describes an ellipse, which is a 2D ellipsoid. So, the shape can be an ellipsoid.")

    print("c) For the general case with n >= 3 and non-orthogonal vectors, the equation for S is not a simple quadratic in x_j and therefore does not describe an ellipsoid.")

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The shape of S is not uniquely one of the given options for all possible choices of {y_i}. It can be a simplex or an ellipsoid (for n=2).")
    print("In multiple-choice questions of this nature, we often consider the 'generic' case. The generic case involves non-orthogonal vectors.")
    print("The simplest non-trivial generic case is for n=2, where the shape is an ellipsoid.")
    print("Based on this reasoning, the most plausible answer is an ellipsoid.")
