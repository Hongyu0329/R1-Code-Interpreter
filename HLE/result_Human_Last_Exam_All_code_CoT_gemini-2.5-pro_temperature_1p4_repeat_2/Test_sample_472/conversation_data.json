    "My plan is to scan the provided Latin line, \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\". After analyzing the line, I've determined it is not dactylic hexameter but an Iambic Senarius, a meter common in Roman comedies like those of Plautus, from where this line originates.\n\nMy process for scanning the line as an Iambic Senarius is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Elisions**: The phrase \"bene esse\" contains an elision where the final \"-e\" of \"bene\" is dropped before the initial \"e-\" of \"esse\", becoming \"ben'esse\".\n2.  **Determine Syllable Quantities**: I will determine if each syllable is long (L) or short (S) based on standard Latin rules (vowel length, diphthongs, and position). I will also apply rules specific to dramatic meter, such as *brevis brevians* (iambic shortening), which allows a word with an S-L pattern like `tibi` to be scanned as S-S.\n3.  **Divide into Feet**: The line is divided into six metrical feet. For an Iambic Senarius, the base foot is an iamb (S L). However, substitutions are allowed: a spondee (L L), a tribrach (S S S), or an anapest (S S L) can replace an iamb in the first five feet. The final foot must be a pure iamb (S L).\n4.  **Assemble the Scansion**: By combining these rules, I have constructed a complete scansion of the line foot by foot.\n\nThe Python code below will define this analysis and print the resulting metrical pattern, with each foot separated by a space. The instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" does not appear to apply to this linguistic task, so the code will focus on clearly presenting the scansion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_latin_scansion():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and prints the scansion of a Latin line from Plautus.\n    The scansion is determined manually based on the rules of the Iambic Senarius meter\n    and encoded here to be presented as the solution.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n    meter = \"Iambic Senarius\"\n    \n    # Analysis based on manual scansion\n    # 1. Elision: ben(e) esse -> ben'esse\n    # 2. Feet are constructed using valid substitutions for an iamb (S L),\n    #    such as Tribrach (S S S), Spondee (L L), and Anapest (S S L).\n    # 3. Iambic shortening applies to words like 'tibi'.\n    # 4. The final foot is a pure iamb.\n    \n    feet_syllables = [\"et ti bi\", \"ben' es-\", \"-se so-\", \"-li quom\", \"si bi sit\", \"ma le\"]\n    feet_scansion = [\"S S S\", \"L L\", \"S L\", \"L L\", \"S S L\", \"S L\"]\n    \n    print(f\"Line: \\\"{line}\\\"\")\n    print(f\"Meter: {meter}\")\n    print(\"\\nScansion Breakdown:\")\n    \n    for i in range(len(feet_syllables)):\n        print(f\"Foot {i+1} ({feet_syllables[i]}): {feet_scansion[i]}\")\n\n    # The final pattern joins the scansion of each foot with a space.\n    final_pattern = \" \".join(feet_scansion)\n    \n    # The instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" is ambiguous for this text-based task.\n    # The code instead prints each \"L\" and \"S\" that forms the final answer, separated by feet.\n    print(\"\\nFinal Pattern:\")\n    print(final_pattern)\n\nsolve_latin_scansion()\n<<<S S S L L S L L L S S L S L>>>\n```"
