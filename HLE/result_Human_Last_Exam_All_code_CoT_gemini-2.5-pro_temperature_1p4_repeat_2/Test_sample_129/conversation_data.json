    "To find the number of true boolean expressions of length 5, we can use dynamic programming. The key is to correctly define the structure of a valid expression based on the allowed symbols `T F ! & | ( )` and precedence rules `! > & > |`.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define Syntactic Categories**: To handle precedence correctly, we'll split expressions into two types:\n    *   **Terms (S)**: Basic building blocks. A Term is either a literal (`T`, `F`), a negated term (`!S`), or a parenthesized expression `(E)`. Examples: `T`, `!F`, `!!T`, `(T|F)`.\n    *   **Expressions (E)**: A full expression. An Expression can be a Term, or a binary operation combining an Expression and a Term (`E & S` or `E | S`). This structure ensures `&` and `|` are evaluated after terms (which include `!`).\n\n2.  **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We will calculate the number of true and false expressions/terms for every length from 1 to 5.\n    *   `TS[n]`, `FS[n]`: Number of true and false Terms of length `n`.\n    *   `TE[n]`, `FE[n]`: Number of true and false Expressions of length `n`.\n\n3.  **Recursive Calculation**:\n    *   A Term `S` of length `n` is formed from:\n        *   `!S'` where `S'` has length `n-1`.\n        *   `(E')` where `E'` has length `n-2`.\n    *   An Expression `E` of length `n` is formed from:\n        *   A Term `S` of length `n`.\n        *   `E' op S'` where `op` is `&` or `|`, and `len(E') + len(S') = n-1`.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: The total number of true expressions of length 5, `TE[5]`, is the sum of true \"Terms\" of length 5 and true \"Binary Operations\" of length 5. We will calculate and sum these components.\n\nThe following Python code implements this dynamic programming approach. It calculates the counts for each length up to 5 and then prints the breakdown of the final calculation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of true boolean expressions of length 5.\n    \n    This problem is solved using dynamic programming. We define two categories of\n    syntactic structures: \"Terms\" and \"Expressions\", which allows us to correctly\n    model the specified operator precedence (! > & > |).\n\n    - A \"Term\" (S) can be a literal ('T', 'F'), a negated term ('!S'), or a\n      parenthesized expression ('(E)').\n    - An \"Expression\" (E) can be a Term, or a binary operation combining an\n      Expression and a Term ('E & S', 'E | S').\n\n    We build arrays to store the counts of true and false expressions/terms for\n    lengths 1 through 5.\n\n    Let:\n    TE[n]: number of true Expressions of length n\n    FE[n]: number of false Expressions of length n\n    TS[n]: number of true Terms of length n\n    FS[n]: number of false Terms of length n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # DP arrays, size 6 for indices 0 to 5.
