    # The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride involves the direct reaction of xenon and fluorine gas.
    # The chemical equation is: Xe + 2F2 -> XeF4

    # The most common, reliable, and efficient method for producing XeF4
    # is by heating the two gases together in a sealed nickel container.
    # This thermal synthesis method has well-documented optimal conditions.

    # Reaction conditions for efficient synthesis:
    # - Reactants: Xenon (Xe) and Fluorine (F2)
    # - Molar Ratio: A surplus of fluorine is used, typically 1 part Xenon to 5 parts Fluorine.
    # - Pressure: Approximately 6 atmospheres.
    # - Temperature: The mixture is heated to 400 °C.
