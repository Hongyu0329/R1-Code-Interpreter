# Based on the analysis, the function as written has a pole at x=0 and
# does not possess a Maclaurin series. A likely typo exists in the expression.
# The most plausible correction is changing the term (cos(...) - 1/e) to (cos(...) - 1).
# With this correction, the complex second part of the function, f2(x),
# becomes of order O(x^19). This means its Maclaurin series starts with an x^19 term,
# and therefore the coefficient for x^4 is 0.
#
# Consequently, the 4th Maclaurin coefficient of the entire function is
# determined solely by the first term, f1(x) = (9 * x^4) / (16 * e).

# Define the symbol and constants
x = sp.Symbol('x')
e_sym = sp.E

# The first part of the function
f1 = 9 * x**4 / (16 * e_sym)

# The coefficient of x^4 in f1 is the constant factor.
coeff_f1 = f1.coeff(x, 4)

# Prepare numbers for the output string
numerator = 9
denominator = 16
