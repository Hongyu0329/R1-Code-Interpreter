    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of unique grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot with the minimal grid number, considering translational and rotational symmetries.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Determine the Minimal Grid Number**: The trefoil knot (3_1) is the simplest non-trivial knot. It is a known result in knot theory that its minimal grid number is 3. So, we are looking for diagrams on a 3x3 grid.\n\n2.  **Represent Grid Diagrams**: An `n x n` grid diagram can be represented by a pair of permutations, `(X, O)`, of the set `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`. The positions of the 'X' markers are `(i, X[i])` and the 'O' markers are `(i, O[i])` for `i = 0, ..., n-1`.\n\n3.  **Characterize the Knot Type**: The knot type represented by a diagram `(X, O)` is determined by the composite permutation `sigma = O o X⁻¹`.\n    *   For an `n x n` grid, the diagram represents a single-component knot if and only if `sigma` is a single cycle of length `n`.\n    *   For `n=3`, the permutations of `{0, 1, 2}` that are 3-cycles are `[1, 2, 0]` (cycle `0->1->2->0`) and `[2, 0, 1]` (cycle `0->2->1->0`).\n    *   These two 3-cycles are inverses of each other. In knot theory, if a knot `K` is represented by `sigma`, its mirror image is represented by `sigma⁻¹`. The two trefoil knots (left-hand and right-hand) are mirror images.\n    *   By convention and detailed analysis (e.g., by calculating the writhe or drawing the diagram), `sigma = [1, 2, 0]` corresponds to the right-hand trefoil, and `sigma = [2, 0, 1]` corresponds to the left-hand trefoil.\n\n4.  **Identify All Left-Hand Trefoil Diagrams**: We need to find all pairs `(X, O)` such that `O o X⁻¹ = [2, 0, 1]`. This is equivalent to `O = [2, 0, 1] o X`. There are `3! = 6` possible permutations for `X`, so there are exactly 6 such diagrams.\n\n5.  **Define Symmetries (Equivalences)**:\n    *   **Translation**: A cyclic shift of rows by `r` and columns by `c`. A diagram `(X, O)` is equivalent to `(p_c o X o p_r⁻¹, p_c o O o p_r⁻¹)`, where `p_c` and `p_r` are cyclic shift permutations.\n    *   **Rotation**: Rotation of the grid by 90, 180, or 270 degrees. These operations transform the pair `(X, O)` to a new pair `(X', O')`. The question implies we should consider these as equivalences. However, an operation is only a valid equivalence for this problem if it maps a left-hand trefoil diagram to another left-hand trefoil diagram.\n\n6.  **Partition the Diagrams into Equivalence Classes**: We will use a program to:\n    *   Generate the 6 diagrams for the left-hand trefoil.\n    *   Define the symmetry operations (translation and rotation).\n    *   Systematically explore the equivalence classes. We start with one diagram, find all other diagrams equivalent to it under the allowed symmetries, forming one orbit. We then repeat for any remaining diagrams until all are classified. An operation is \"allowed\" if it maps a left-hand trefoil diagram to another.\n\n7.  **Execution**: The Python code will implement this plan. It will first define the permutations and the set of 6 left-hand trefoil diagrams. Then, it will implement the symmetry operations. Finally, it will perform a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from an arbitrary diagram to find all equivalent diagrams, thus identifying the orbits. The number of orbits found will be the answer. Crucially, we will verify which rotations preserve the left-hand trefoil type.\n\nLet's proceed with the code.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef compose(p1, p2):\n    \"\"\"Computes the composition of two permutations p1 o p2.\"\"\"\n    return [p1[p2[i]] for i in range(len(p1))]\n\ndef inverse(p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the inverse of a permutation.\"\"\"\n    inv = [0] * len(p)\n    for i, pi in enumerate(p):\n        inv[pi] = i\n    return inv\n\ndef tuple_to_list(p_tuple):\n    return list(p_tuple)\n\ndef list_to_tuple(p_list):\n    return tuple(p_list)\n\ndef main():\n    n = 3\n    \n    # All 3! = 6 permutations of {0, 1, 2}\n    perms_list = [\n        [0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 1], [1, 0, 2],\n        [1, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]\n    ]\n    perms = {list_to_tuple(p): p for p in perms_list}\n    perm_tuples = list(perms.keys())\n\n    # sigma_lht corresponds to the left-hand trefoil\n    sigma_lht = [2, 0, 1]\n\n    # Generate all diagrams (X, O) for the left-hand trefoil\n    lht_diagrams = set()\n    for x_tuple in perm_tuples:\n        x = perms[x_tuple]\n        o = compose(sigma_lht, x)\n        lht_diagrams.add((x_tuple, list_to_tuple(o)))\n    \n    # Cyclic shift permutations for translations\n    shifts = {\n        0: [0, 1, 2],\n        1: [1, 2, 0],\n        2: [2, 0, 1]\n    }\n    \n    # Define symmetry operations\n    # Reversal permutation for rotations\n    rev = [2, 1, 0]\n\n    def apply_translation(d, r_shift_idx, c_shift_idx):\n        x, o = tuple_to_list(d[0]), tuple_to_list(d[1])\n        pr_inv = inverse(shifts[r_shift_idx])\n        pc = shifts[c_shift_idx]\n        \n        x_new = compose(pc, compose(x, pr_inv))\n        o_new = compose(pc, compose(o, pr_inv))\n        return (list_to_tuple(x_new), list_to_tuple(o_new))\n\n    def apply_rotation(d, angle):\n        x, o = tuple_to_list(d[0]), tuple_to_list(d[1])\n        x_inv, o_inv = inverse(x), inverse(o)\n        \n        if angle == 0:\n            return d\n        # Formula for 90-degree rotation on permutations (derived from coordinate transformation)\n        if angle == 90:\n            x_new = compose(rev, x_inv)\n            o_new = compose(rev, o_inv)\n        # Formula for 180-degree rotation\n        elif angle == 180:\n            x_new = compose(rev, compose(x, rev))\n            o_new = compose(rev, compose(o, rev))\n        # Formula for 270-degree rotation\n        elif angle == 270:\n            x_new = compose(x_inv, rev)\n            o_new = compose(o_inv, rev)\n        else:\n            return None\n        \n        return (list_to_tuple(x_new), list_to_tuple(o_new))\n\n    # Check which rotations are valid (map LHT diagrams to LHT diagrams)\n    valid_rotations = []\n    sample_diagram = next(iter(lht_diagrams))\n    for angle in [0, 90, 180, 270]:\n        rotated_d = apply_rotation(sample_diagram, angle)\n        if rotated_d in lht_diagrams:\n            valid_rotations.append(angle)\n\n    # Find the number of orbits (equivalence classes)\n    orbits = []\n    unclassified = set(lht_diagrams)\n    \n    while unclassified:\n        start_node = unclassified.pop()\n        current_orbit = {start_node}\n        queue = collections.deque([start_node])\n        \n        visited = {start_node}\n        \n        while queue:\n            current_d = queue.popleft()\n            \n            # Apply translations\n            for r in range(n):\n                for c in range(n):\n                    next_d = apply_translation(current_d, r, c)\n                    if next_d in lht_diagrams and next_d not in visited:\n                        visited.add(next_d)\n                        current_orbit.add(next_d)\n                        queue.append(next_d)\n            \n            # Apply valid rotations\n            for angle in valid_rotations:\n                next_d = apply_rotation(current_d, angle)\n                if next_d in lht_diagrams and next_d not in visited:\n                    visited.add(next_d)\n                    current_orbit.add(next_d)\n                    queue.append(next_d)\n\n        orbits.append(current_orbit)\n        unclassified.difference_update(current_orbit)\n\n    num_orbits = len(orbits)\n    print(f\"The {len(lht_diagrams)} minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil are partitioned into {num_orbits} orbit(s) under translation and rotation.\")\n    # The actual answer is the number of orbits found\n    print(f\"The number of unique diagrams is: {num_orbits}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```\n<<<1>>>"
