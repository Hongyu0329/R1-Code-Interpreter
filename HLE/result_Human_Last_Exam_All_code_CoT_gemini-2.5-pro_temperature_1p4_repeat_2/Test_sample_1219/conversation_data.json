    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to perform a calculation with high precision because the argument `x = 10^100` (a googol) is extraordinarily large. Standard floating-point arithmetic is insufficient.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Use a high-precision math library**: Python's `mpmath` library is perfectly suited for this. It can handle arbitrary-precision arithmetic and provides implementations of transcendental functions like `tan` that work correctly with large arguments.\n2.  **Understand the math**: The tangent function is periodic with a period of `π`. This means `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. The core of the problem is to accurately calculate `10^100 mod π`.\n3.  **Set adequate precision**: To correctly compute the remainder, the precision (number of digits) used for `π` and the calculations must be greater than the number of digits in the integer part of `10^100 / π`. Since `10^100` is a 101-digit number, `10^100 / π` is a 100-digit number. We need a precision of at least 100 decimal places. To be safe and to get a few correct digits in the final result, we will set the precision to 110 decimal places (`dps=110`) in `mpmath`.\n4.  **Perform the calculation**: We will use `mpmath` to compute `tan(10^100)`. The library automatically handles the argument reduction `(10^100 mod π)`.\n5.  **Extract and present the result**: From the calculated value of `tan(10^100)`, which will be a high-precision number, we will extract the first 3 digits following the decimal point. Per the instructions, the code will also print the key numbers involved in the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\n# 1. Set the precision for mpmath. 10^100 is a very large number, so we need\n# high precision for the argument reduction (x mod pi).\n# The number of required decimal places is about log10(10^100) = 100.\n# We set it to 110 for a margin of safety.\nmpmath.mp.dps = 110\n\n# 2. Define the numbers for the expression tan(10^100)\nbase = 10\nexponent = 100\n\n# Represent 10^100 as a high-precision number\nx = mpmath.power(base, exponent)\n\n# 3. The tangent function has a period of pi. tan(x) = tan(x mod pi).\n# We can find the remainder of x divided by pi to understand the calculation.\npi = mpmath.pi\nremainder = mpmath.fmod(x, pi)\n\n# 4. Calculate the tangent. mpmath.tan(x) correctly handles the large argument.\nresult = mpmath.tan(x)\n\n# 5. The instruction asks to output each number in the final equation.\n# The equation can be written as: tan(10^100) = tan(remainder) = result.\n# We will display these key numbers, truncating them for readability.\nremainder_str = mpmath.nstr(remainder, 4)\nresult_str = mpmath.nstr(result, 4)\n\nprint(\"tan({}^{}) = tan({}) = {}\".format(base, exponent, remainder_str, result_str))\n\n# 6. Extract the first 3 digits after the comma from the full-precision result.\n# We convert the result to a string and find the characters after the decimal point.\nfull_result_str = mpmath.nstr(result, 10)\ndigits_after_comma = full_result_str.split('.')[1]\nfirst_three_digits = digits_after_comma[:3]\n\n# Print the final answer.\nprint(\"The first 3 digits after the comma are: {}\".format(first_three_digits))\n```\n<<<944>>>"
