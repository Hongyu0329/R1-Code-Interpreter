    "To solve this packing problem, we need to find the most efficient way to arrange the 9x1x1 blocks inside the 15x15x15 cube. A simple division of volumes gives an upper limit but doesn't account for the empty space created by the shapes not fitting together perfectly.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the dimensions:** The cube edge is 15, and the block's longest edge is 9. We can think of the 15-unit length as a combination of `9 + 6`.\n2.  **Partition the cube:** We can apply this `9 + 6` split along all three axes (length, width, and height). This divides the 15x15x15 cube into 8 smaller cuboids:\n    *   One 9x9x9 cuboid.\n    *   Three 9x9x6 cuboids.\n    *   Three 9x6x6 cuboids.\n    *   One 6x6x6 cuboid.\n3.  **Calculate blocks per partition:** We will calculate how many 9x1x1 blocks fit into each of these 8 regions. For a block to fit, its length of 9 must be aligned with an edge of the region that is at least 9 units long.\n4.  **Sum the results:** The total number of blocks is the sum of the blocks from all partitions. This method is effective because it concentrates all the unavoidable empty space into the 6x6x6 region where no blocks can fit.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan, calculating the number of blocks for each partition and summing them up to find the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_packing_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest number of 9x1x1 blocks that will fit inside a cube of edge length 15.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The strategy is to partition the 15x15x15 cube.\n    # We split the 15-unit edge into 9 + 6.
