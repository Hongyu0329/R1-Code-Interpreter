# Plan: Calculate the cost for the most efficient computation strategy for 2A - 3B.
# The strategy is 2(A - B) - B which we compute as 2(A + B') + B' where B' = -B.
# The steps are:
# 1. Compute P1 = A + B' using mixed-coordinate addition.
# 2. Compute P2 = 2 * P1 using doubling.
# 3. Compute P3 = P2 + B' using mixed-coordinate addition.

# Cost of step 1: Convert A to extended coordinates (1M) and then add B' (affine) (7M).
cost_step1 = 1 + 7

# Cost of step 2: Double the result of step 1, which is in extended coordinates (8M).
cost_step2 = 8

# Cost of step 3: Add B' (affine) to the result of step 2 (extended) (7M).
cost_step3 = 7

# Total cost is the sum of the costs of the three steps.
total_cost = cost_step1 + cost_step2 + cost_step3

# The individual costs for each main operation in the sequence are:
# Cost of initial mixed-add to get A+B'
c1 = cost_step1
# Cost of doubling to get 2(A+B')
c2 = cost_step2
# Cost of final mixed-add to get 2(A+B') + B'
c3 = cost_step3

print("The minimal cost is computed by the sequence: (A+B') -> 2*(A+B') -> 2*(A+B') + B'")
print("The costs for the operations are:")
print(f"1. Cost of (A+B'): 1M (convert A to extended) + 7M (mixed add) = {c1}M")
print(f"2. Cost of doubling the result: {c2}M")
print(f"3. Cost of adding B' to the doubled result: {c3}M")
print("\nThe final cost equation is:")
# We break down the first step in the final equation to be more explicit.
c1_convert = 1
c1_add = 7
