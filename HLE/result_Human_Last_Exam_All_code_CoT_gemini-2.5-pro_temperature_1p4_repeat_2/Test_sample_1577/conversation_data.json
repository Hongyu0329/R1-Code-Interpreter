    "My plan is to determine the formula for the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code based on the number of smooth and rough holes.\n\n1.  **GSD and Logical Qubits:** The ground space degeneracy of a topological code is given by `GSD = 2^k`, where `k` is the number of independent logical qubits the code can store.\n2.  **Sources of Logical Qubits:** In the toric code, logical qubits are associated with the topology of the surface. For a surface of genus `g` without any holes, `k = 2g`. Our problem is on a surface with holes, which is topologically a sphere (genus `g=0`) with punctures. The logical qubits, in this case, arise from the boundaries (holes).\n3.  **Holes as Boundaries:** The `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes correspond to `n` boundaries of \"e-type\" (smooth/electric) and `m` boundaries of \"m-type\" (rough/magnetic).\n4.  **Degrees of Freedom from Holes:**\n    *   **Smooth Holes:** One can create a pair of `e`-type anyons (electric charges) from the vacuum. These anyons can be moved to the boundaries of the smooth holes without any energy cost. The total charge across all boundaries must be conserved (i.e., sum to zero). With `n` smooth holes, we have `n-1` independent ways to distribute the charges. This corresponds to `n-1` logical degrees of freedom, giving a degeneracy contribution of `2^(n-1)`. This reasoning holds for `n ≥ 1`.\n    *   **Rough Holes:** Similarly, `m`-type anyons (magnetic fluxes/vortices) can be moved to the boundaries of the `m` rough holes. The total flux is conserved, leading to `m-1` independent degrees of freedom. This gives a degeneracy contribution of `2^(m-1)`, valid for `m ≥ 1`.\n5.  **Total Degeneracy:** The electric and magnetic degrees of freedom are independent. Therefore, the total ground space degeneracy is the product of the degeneracies from each type of hole.\n    *   `GSD = (degeneracy from smooth holes) × (degeneracy from rough holes)`\n    *   `GSD = 2^(n-1) × 2^(m-1)`\n    *   `GSD = 2^((n-1) + (m-1)) = 2^(n+m-2)`\n6.  **Conclusion:** The formula `2^(n+m-2)` accurately describes the ground space degeneracy, assuming there is at least one of each type of hole (`n≥1` and `m≥1`). Among the given choices, this is the only one that correctly captures the physics for this general case.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that calculates the GSD using this formula for an example case.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_toric_code_gsd(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of smooth holes (must be >= 1).\n        m (int): The number of rough holes (must be >= 1).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 1 or m < 1:\n        print(\"This formula 2^(n+m-2) is valid for n >= 1 and m >= 1.\")\n        # The more general formula gives 2**(max(0, n-1) + max(0, m-1))\n        # For this problem, we stick to the formula from the likely answer choice.\n        return\n\n    # The number of logical qubits is k = (n-1) + (m-1) = n+m-2\n    k = n + m - 2\n    \n    # The GSD is 2^k\n    gsd = 2**k\n\n    print(\"The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is given by the formula: 2^(n + m - 2)\")\n    print(f\"For n = {n} and m = {m}:\")\n    # Using f-string to explicitly show the calculation steps in the final equation.\n    print(f\"GSD = 2^({n} + {m} - 2) = 2^{k} = {gsd}\")\n\n# Example usage with n=2 smooth holes and m=3 rough holes.\ncalculate_toric_code_gsd(2, 3)\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
