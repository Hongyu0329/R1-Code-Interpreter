    "To determine the number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables needed for the supersymmetric sigma-model in symmetry class D with two replicas, we need to find the dimension of the bosonic part of the model's target space.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Space:** For symmetry class D in the supersymmetric formalism, the target space of the sigma-model is the Riemannian symmetric superspace `O(2n|2n) / (O(n|n) x O(n|n))`, where `n` is the number of replicas.\n2.  **Identify the Bosonic Sector:** The bosonic part of this superspace, which corresponds to the non-Grassman variables, is a manifold composed of two parts:\n    *   One part comes from the boson-boson (BB) block of the supermatrix `Q`. This manifold is the symmetric space `O(n,n) / (O(n) x O(n))`.\n    *   The other part comes from the fermion-fermion (FF) block of the supermatrix `Q`. This manifold is the symmetric space `Sp(2n, R) / U(n)`.\n3.  **Calculate the Dimensions:** The total number of bosonic variables is the sum of the dimensions of these two spaces.\n    *   The dimension of `O(n,n) / (O(n) x O(n))` is `n^2`.\n    *   The dimension of `Sp(2n, R) / U(n)` is `n(n+1)`.\n    *   The total dimension is `n^2 + n(n+1)`.\n4.  **Substitute the Number of Replicas:** The user specifies `n=2` replicas. We will substitute this value into the formula to get the final count.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** The code will perform these calculations and print the steps and the final result clearly.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_d_class_variables():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassman variables for the supersymmetric\n    sigma-model in symmetry class D with a given number of replicas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of replicas as specified by the user\n    n = 2\n    print(f\"Symmetry Class: D\")\n    print(f\"Number of replicas (n): {n}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables is the dimension of the bosonic sector of the target space.\")\n    print(\"This dimension is the sum of contributions from the boson-boson (BB) and fermion-fermion (FF) blocks.\\n\")\n\n    # Contribution from the boson-boson block manifold: O(n,n) / (O(n) x O(n))\n    dim_bb = n**2\n    print(f\"The dimension of the BB sector is n^2.\")\n    print(f\"dim_BB = {n}^2 = {dim_bb}\")\n\n    # Contribution from the fermion-fermion block manifold: Sp(2n, R) / U(n)\n    dim_ff = n * (n + 1)\n    print(f\"\\nThe dimension of the FF sector is n(n+1).\")\n    print(f\"dim_FF = {n} * ({n} + 1) = {dim_ff}\")\n\n    # Total number of bosonic variables\n    total_dim = dim_bb + dim_ff\n    print(\"\\nThe total number of non-Grassman variables is the sum of these two dimensions.\")\n    print(f\"Total Dimension = dim_BB + dim_FF\")\n    print(f\"Result: {dim_bb} + {dim_ff} = {total_dim}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_d_class_variables()\n<<<10>>>\n```"
