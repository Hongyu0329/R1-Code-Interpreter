    "An optimal strategy for White involves neutralizing Black's primary threat while capitalizing on White's main advantage.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the Position:** White has a strong passed pawn on the d-file (`d6`), which is very close to promotion. Black's queen is very active and poses a significant threat of delivering a perpetual check to the White king, which would result in a draw.\n2.  **Evaluate Candidate Moves:** The key is to find a move that deals with the threat of Black's queen.\n    *   Moves like `Qf8+` or `Qe1` keep the queens on the board, allowing Black to continue checking the White king and likely force a draw.\n    *   The move `Qxc5+` is a forcing move that exchanges queens.\n3.  **Analyze the Resulting Endgame:** After `1. Qxc5+`, Black is forced to recapture with `1... bxc5`. This leads to a pawn-only endgame. In this endgame, White's passed `d6` pawn becomes the decisive factor. White's king is free to advance, support the pawn, and stop any counterplay from Black's pawns. This endgame is easily winning for White.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The move `Qxc5+` simplifies the position into a winning endgame and is therefore the best move.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to print this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chess position from the given FEN and determines the optimal move for White.\n    The analysis concludes that trading queens leads to a winning pawn endgame.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    fen_position = \"8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\"\n    \n    print(\"--- Chess Puzzle Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"Position FEN: {fen_position}\")\n    print(\"It is White's turn to move.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Situation Analysis:\")\n    print(\"White's key asset is the passed pawn on d6, which is only two squares away from promoting to a Queen.\")\n    print(\"Black's main strength is the active Queen on c5, which threatens to create a perpetual check on the White King and force a draw.\")\n    \n    best_move = \"Qxc5+\"\n    \n    print(\"\\nRecommended Move and Justification:\")\n    print(f\"The best move for White is {best_move}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThis move forces a trade of Queens.
