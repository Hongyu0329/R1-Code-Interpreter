    # Reactant: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane (cis isomer)
    # Reagent: Potassium tert-butoxide (strong, bulky base)
    # Reaction Type: E2 Elimination
    
    # Analysis:
    # 1. The reaction is E2, requiring a trans-diaxial arrangement of H and Br.
    # 2. The cis-isomer must adopt a conformation with an axial Br to react.
    #    This conformation has an equatorial CH3 group, which is stable.
    # 3. There are two possible beta-protons for elimination:
    #    - At C2: leads to 1-methylcyclohexene (Zaitsev, more substituted).
    #    - At C6: leads to 3-methylcyclohexene (Hofmann, less substituted).
    # 4. The base, potassium tert-butoxide, is bulky. It preferentially removes
    #    the less sterically hindered proton at C6.
    # 5. This leads to the formation of the Hofmann product.
