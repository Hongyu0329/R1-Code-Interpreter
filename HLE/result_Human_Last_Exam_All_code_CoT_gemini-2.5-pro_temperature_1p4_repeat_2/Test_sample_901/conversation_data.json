    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu), which is a strong and sterically bulky base. The solvent is tert-butyl alcohol. This combination of a secondary alkyl halide and a strong, bulky base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze Substrate Stereochemistry**: In a disubstituted cyclohexane, having the stereochemistry (1S, 2R) or (1R, 2S) on adjacent carbons means the two substituents are **cis** to each other. So, we are starting with cis-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\n\n3.  **Determine the Reactive Conformation**: An E2 reaction requires a specific geometry: the leaving group (Bromine) and the proton being removed must be in an **anti-periplanar** (or trans-diaxial) arrangement. This means both must be in axial positions, one pointing up and one pointing down.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Chair Conformers**: The cis-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane molecule exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations:\n    *   **Conformer A**: This has an **axial Bromine** and an **equatorial methyl group**. This conformation is relatively stable because the bulky methyl group is in the more favorable equatorial position.\n    *   **Conformer B**: This has an **equatorial Bromine** and an **axial methyl group**. This is less stable and exists in a lower concentration.\n\n    Since the E2 reaction can only proceed when the Bromine atom is in an axial position, the reaction must occur via **Conformer A**.\n\n5.  **Identify Possible Elimination Products**: In Conformer A, the Bromine is axial. We now look for beta-hydrogens (hydrogens on adjacent carbons, C2 and C6) that are also axial.\n    *   **Path 1 (Zaitsev elimination)**: The hydrogen on C2 is axial and anti-periplanar to the bromine. Removing this proton would form a double bond between C1 and C2, yielding **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the more substituted (trisubstituted) and more stable alkene, known as the Zaitsev product.\n    *   **Path 2 (Hofmann elimination)**: The hydrogen on C6 is also axial and anti-periplanar to the bromine. Removing this proton would form a double bond between C1 and C6, yielding **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted (disubstituted) and less stable alkene, known as the Hofmann product.\n\n6.  **Predict the Major Product**: The choice between the Zaitsev and Hofmann products depends on the base. Potassium tert-butoxide is a very **bulky base**. Due to its size, it has difficulty accessing the more sterically hindered proton on C2 (which is close to the methyl group). It will preferentially attack the more easily accessible proton on C6. Therefore, the reaction favors the Hofmann elimination pathway.\n\n**Conclusion**: The major product of the reaction between (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane and potassium tert-butoxide is the Hofmann product, **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the product of the given chemical reaction based on\n    the principles of organic chemistry, specifically E2 elimination reactions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Reactant: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane (cis isomer)\n    # Reagent: Potassium tert-butoxide (strong, bulky base)\n    # Reaction Type: E2 Elimination\n    \n    # Analysis:\n    # 1.
