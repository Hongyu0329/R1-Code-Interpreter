    This function designs a molecule based on a specific set of constraints and provides its SMILES representation.
    
    Constraints Analysis:
    1.  Molecular Formula: Derived as C12H18O6 from the given molecular weight (258.11 g/mol), heavy atom count (18), and heteroatom composition (6 Oxygens).
    2.  Valence Electrons: C12H18O6 has (12*4 + 18*1 + 6*6) = 102 valence electrons, matching the requirement.
    3.  Degrees of Unsaturation: The formula gives 4 degrees of unsaturation, consistent with the required 3 rings and 1 carbonyl group.
    4.  Core Structure: The constraints of having zero rotatable bonds, a bicyclic arrangement, and three rings point to a rigid polycyclic cage. A [5.5.5]propellane skeleton (tricyclo[5.5.5.0^1,7]heptadecane) fits the deduced atomic connectivity perfectly. It consists of two central carbon atoms connected by three 5-atom bridges.
    5.  Atom Placement: The 12 carbons and 5 ether oxygens are arranged in this propellane cage. The required carbonyl group and the ether oxygens are placed within the bridges to satisfy all constraints, including avoiding forbidden functional groups like esters.

    The resulting molecule is a hetero-propellane, which is rigid and meets all specified criteria.

    # SMILES string for the derived molecule. This represents a tricyclo[5.5.5.0] system.
    # The structure can be described as follows:
    # - Two central bridgehead carbons (C1 and C7 in the numbering below).
    # - Bridge 1 (5 atoms): -CH2-O-CH2-O-CH2-
    # - Bridge 2 (5 atoms): -CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-
    # - Bridge 3 (5 atoms): -O-CH2-O-CH2-O-
    # The SMILES string is constructed by defining a 12-membered ring and then adding the third bridge.
