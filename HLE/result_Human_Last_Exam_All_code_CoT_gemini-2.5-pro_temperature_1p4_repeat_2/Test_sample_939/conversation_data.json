    "Answering this question requires converting color values from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. A color can be represented in sRGB if, after this conversion, all its R, G, and B components are between 0 and 1, inclusive. If any component is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is \"out-of-gamut\" for sRGB and cannot be represented without clipping, which changes the color.\n\nThe conversion process involves a matrix multiplication. The input ROMM RGB values are multiplied by a specific 3x3 transformation matrix to get the equivalent linear sRGB values. We will use a standard, well-established matrix for this conversion.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Define the list of five ROMM RGB colors to be tested.\n2.  Define the transformation matrix that converts linear ROMM RGB values to linear sRGB values.\n3.  Iterate through each color.\n4.  For each color, perform the matrix multiplication to get the resulting linear sRGB vector.\n5.  Check if any of the three components in the resulting vector are outside the valid [0, 1] range.\n6.  If a color is out of range, we'll mark it as \"cannot be represented\".\n7.  Finally, we will list the numbers of all the colors that cannot be represented in sRGB.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines which ROMM RGB colors cannot be represented in sRGB.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The transformation matrix to convert from linear ROMM RGB (D50)\n    # to linear sRGB (D65).
