    # Step 1: Vaganova Method Analysis
    print("1. Vaganova Cambré Derrière:")
    print("   In the Russian Vaganova method, the bend comes primarily from the upper back (thoracic spine).")
    print("   The key principle is stability and control. To achieve this, the dancer must keep their hips square and vertically aligned over their supporting feet. Pushing the hips forward is considered a technical error as it breaks the classical line and compromises turnout.")

    # Step 2: Balanchine Method Analysis
    print("2. Balanchine Cambré Derrière:")
    print("   The Balanchine style, developed by George Balanchine, often exaggerates classical lines for visual effect and dynamism.")
    print("   In a cambré derrière, the dancer is allowed to push the hips forward. This forward displacement of the hips acts as a counterbalance, which in turn allows the dancer to achieve a significantly deeper and more dramatic backbend.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 3: Conclusion based on comparison
    print("3. Comparison and Conclusion:")
    print("   While there may be subtle differences in head or arm placement (E, A) or the resulting degree of the bend (D), the foundational mechanical difference that enables these other variations is the hip placement.")
    print("   The Vaganova method demands the hips stay put, while the Balanchine method uses a forward hip placement to create a different aesthetic.")
    print("-" * 70)
    print("Therefore, the most accurate answer is B: Placement of hip.")
