    "To determine the primary difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods, I will analyze the biomechanics and stylistic goals of each technique for this specific movement.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  **Define Cambré Derrière:** First, I'll establish the basic definition of a cambré derrière, which is a backward bend of the torso.\n2.  **Analyze the Vaganova Technique:** I will describe the execution of the movement in the Vaganova style, focusing on its principles of stability, control, and maintaining a pure classical line.\n3.  **Analyze the Balanchine Technique:** I will then describe the Balanchine execution, noting its emphasis on dynamic shapes, speed, and creating more extreme lines.\n4.  **Compare and Contrast:** By comparing the two methods, I will pinpoint the most fundamental difference in their approach, specifically referencing the provided multiple-choice options.\n5.  **Select the Best Answer:** I will choose the option that most accurately represents this core distinction.\n\nThis analysis will be presented within a Python script that prints the step-by-step reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef ballet_technique_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and explains the difference between a Vaganova and Balanchine cambré derrière.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the difference between a cambré derrière in Vaganova and Balanchine methods:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 1: Vaganova Method Analysis\n    print(\"1. Vaganova Cambré Derrière:\")\n    print(\"   In the Russian Vaganova method, the bend comes primarily from the upper back (thoracic spine).\")\n    print(\"   The key principle is stability and control. To achieve this, the dancer must keep their hips square and vertically aligned over their supporting feet. Pushing the hips forward is considered a technical error as it breaks the classical line and compromises turnout.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Balanchine Method Analysis\n    print(\"2. Balanchine Cambré Derrière:\")\n    print(\"   The Balanchine style, developed by George Balanchine, often exaggerates classical lines for visual effect and dynamism.\")\n    print(\"   In a cambré derrière, the dancer is allowed to push the hips forward. This forward displacement of the hips acts as a counterbalance, which in turn allows the dancer to achieve a significantly deeper and more dramatic backbend.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Conclusion based on comparison\n    print(\"3. Comparison and Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"   While there may be subtle differences in head or arm placement (E, A) or the resulting degree of the bend (D), the foundational mechanical difference that enables these other variations is the hip placement.\")\n    print(\"   The Vaganova method demands the hips stay put, while the Balanchine method uses a forward hip placement to create a different aesthetic.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(\"Therefore, the most accurate answer is B: Placement of hip.\")\n\nballet_technique_analysis()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
