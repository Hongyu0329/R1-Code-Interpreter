    "This is a bit of a trick question in the world of mycology. While many mushrooms have blue coloring or bruise blue, a true, distinctly blue spore print is not known to exist. The pigments that color spores, primarily melanin, do not produce the color blue.\n\nHowever, the question likely refers to the genus that contains the most famous blue-colored mushroom, *Lactarius indigo*. This mushroom has a vibrant blue cap, blue gills, and bleeds a blue latex \"milk\" when cut. Due to its overwhelmingly blue appearance, it is a very common misconception that its spore print is also blue. The actual spore print color is creamy white to pale yellow.\n\nGiven this common association, the genus you are looking for is almost certainly *Lactarius*.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mushroom_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the name of the mushroom genus commonly, though incorrectly,\n    associated with a blue spore print.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The genus is Lactarius, famous for the Lactarius indigo (Indigo Milk Cap) mushroom.\n    # This mushroom is so vividly blue that it's often assumed its spores are also blue.\n    # In reality, its spore print is a yellowish-white color.\n    # No known mushroom genus produces a truly blue spore print.\n    genus_name = \"Lactarius\"\n    print(f\"The genus of mushroom known for its distinctly blue species, leading to the common (but incorrect) belief of a blue spore print, is: {genus_name}\")\n\nsolve_mushroom_riddle()\n```\n<<<Lactarius>>>"
