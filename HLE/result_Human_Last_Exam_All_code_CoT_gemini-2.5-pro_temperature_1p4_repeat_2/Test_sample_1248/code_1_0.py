# The final answer is obtained by following the step-by-step reasoning outlined above.
# The Python code below will print the final formatted answer.

# (a) Reasoning: The conditions g.1_R = 0 and g^2.1_R = 1_R imply 1_R = 0,
# so R is the zero ring where the statement is vacuously true.
answer_a = "Yes"

# (b) Reasoning: Evaluate the formula for j=2, q=-1. The q-binomial coefficient C(2,1,-1) is 0.
# The k=0 term's coefficient is 1.
# The k=2 term's coefficient is -1.
# The final expression is Term_0 - Term_2.
answer_b = "1 * (x . 1_R)^2 (a . 1_R) - 1 * (g^2 a . 1_R) (x . 1_R)^2"

# (c) Reasoning: From the givens, we deduce w(g^k.r) = 0 for k>=1.
# This causes all terms except for k=0 in the sum to vanish. The k=0 term has a coefficient of 1.
answer_c = "1 * w^3 (a . 1_R)"

# Final output string construction.
final_answer_string = f"(a) {answer_a} (b) {answer_b} (c) {answer_c}"
