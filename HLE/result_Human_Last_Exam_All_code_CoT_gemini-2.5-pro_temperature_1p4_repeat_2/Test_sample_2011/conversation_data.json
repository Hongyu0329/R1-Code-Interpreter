    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The first step is to precisely understand what is being asked. The goal is to find the maximum number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs within a single graph of n=128 vertices.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Properties of Induced Cliques:** Let's analyze the structure of the set of possible induced clique sizes for any given graph. Let this set be $S$. If a graph $G$ contains an induced clique of size $k$ (i.e., a set of $k$ vertices that are all connected to each other), what does this imply about other clique sizes? I will show that if $k \\in S$, then every integer $j$ from 1 to $k$ must also be in $S$. This means the set of induced clique sizes for any graph is always of the form $\\{1, 2, ..., k_{max}\\}$.\n\n3.  **Relate to a Standard Graph Property:** The value $k_{max}$ is the size of the largest clique in the graph, a fundamental property known as the clique number, denoted $\\omega(G)$. Therefore, the number of different induced clique sizes is simply the clique number of the graph.\n\n4.  **Maximize the Clique Number:** The problem is now simplified to finding the maximum possible clique number for a graph with 128 vertices. The clique number of any graph cannot exceed its number of vertices.\n\n5.  **Construct the Optimal Graph:** To show that this maximum is achievable, I'll describe the graph that has the maximum possible clique number. This is the complete graph $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. For $n=128$, this is $K_{128}$.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation and Code:** Based on the reasoning, the maximum number of clique sizes is equal to the number of vertices, $n$. I will write a Python script that states this logic and prints the final answer.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef solve_max_clique_sizes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n    that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph with n=128 vertices.\n\n    The reasoning is as follows:\n\n    1. Let G be any graph with n vertices.\n    2. Let S be the set of sizes k for which an induced k-clique exists in G.\n       For an induced subgraph to be a k-clique, it must be a complete graph of size k (K_k).\n    3. Let omega(G) be the clique number of G, which is the size of the largest clique in G.\n       This means omega(G) is the maximum value in the set S.\n    4. If a graph G contains an induced clique of size k, say on a set of vertices C, then any\n       subset of C of size j (where 1 <= j <= k) also forms an induced clique.\n    5. This implies that if omega(G) is in S, then the set S must contain all integers from 1 to omega(G).\n       Therefore, for any graph G, the set of its induced clique sizes is S = {1, 2, ..., omega(G)}.\n    6. The number of different clique sizes is |S| = omega(G).\n    7. The problem is now to find the maximum possible value of omega(G) for a graph with n vertices.\n    8. The clique number of a graph cannot be larger than its total number of vertices, so omega(G) <= n.\n    9. This maximum value is achieved by the complete graph K_n, in which all n vertices form a clique.\n       For K_n, omega(K_n) = n.\n    10. Therefore, the maximum number of different clique sizes is n.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 128\n\n    # The maximum number of different clique sizes is n.\n    max_sizes = n\n\n    print(f\"For a graph with n = {n} vertices:\")\n    print(\"The set of possible induced clique sizes is always of the form {1, 2, ..., k}, where k is the graph's clique number.\")\n    print(\"To maximize the number of different clique sizes, we need to maximize the clique number k.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum possible clique number for a graph with {n} vertices is {n}.\")\n    print(\"This is achieved by the complete graph K_128.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Maximum Number of Different Clique Sizes = n = {max_sizes}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_max_clique_sizes()\n```\n<<<128>>>"
