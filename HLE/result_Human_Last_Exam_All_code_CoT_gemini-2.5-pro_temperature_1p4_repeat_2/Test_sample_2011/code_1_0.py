def solve_max_clique_sizes():
    """
    This function determines the maximum possible number of different clique sizes
    that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph with n=128 vertices.

    The reasoning is as follows:

    1. Let G be any graph with n vertices.
    2. Let S be the set of sizes k for which an induced k-clique exists in G.
       For an induced subgraph to be a k-clique, it must be a complete graph of size k (K_k).
    3. Let omega(G) be the clique number of G, which is the size of the largest clique in G.
       This means omega(G) is the maximum value in the set S.
    4. If a graph G contains an induced clique of size k, say on a set of vertices C, then any
       subset of C of size j (where 1 <= j <= k) also forms an induced clique.
    5. This implies that if omega(G) is in S, then the set S must contain all integers from 1 to omega(G).
       Therefore, for any graph G, the set of its induced clique sizes is S = {1, 2, ..., omega(G)}.
    6. The number of different clique sizes is |S| = omega(G).
    7. The problem is now to find the maximum possible value of omega(G) for a graph with n vertices.
    8. The clique number of a graph cannot be larger than its total number of vertices, so omega(G) <= n.
    9. This maximum value is achieved by the complete graph K_n, in which all n vertices form a clique.
       For K_n, omega(K_n) = n.
    10. Therefore, the maximum number of different clique sizes is n.
