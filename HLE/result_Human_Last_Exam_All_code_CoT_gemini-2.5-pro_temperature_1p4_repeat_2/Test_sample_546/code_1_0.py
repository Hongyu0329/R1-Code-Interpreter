# The value of p provided in the problem statement.
p = 18446744074401676349

# Based on the analysis, the function f(p) simplifies to p^2 + 4.
# We calculate this value using Python's support for large integers.
result = p**2 + 4

# Print the final equation as requested, showing each number involved.
