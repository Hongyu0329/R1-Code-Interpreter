    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this chess puzzle:\n\n1.  **Calculate the total number of edge squares** on a standard 8x8 chessboard. An 8x8 board has 4 sides, each with 8 squares. Since the 4 corner squares are counted twice, we subtract them.\n2.  **Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops** that can be placed on these edge squares. Bishops only attack along diagonals of the same color. To place the maximum number of bishops without any of them attacking each other, you can place one on every edge square of a single color (e.g., all the light-colored edge squares).\n3.  **Calculate the number of edge squares without bishops.** This is simply the total number of edge squares minus the maximum number of bishops placed.\n4.  **Present the final equation** and the answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishops_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares on a chessboard when the\n    maximum number of non-attacking bishops are placed on the edge.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    # An N x N board has 4 sides of N squares, with 4 corners counted twice.\n    # Formula: (N * 4) - 4\n    total_edge_squares = (board_size * 4) - 4\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge.\n    # The edge squares are divided equally between two colors (light and dark).\n    # On an 8x8 board, there are 14 light and 14 dark edge squares.\n    # Bishops can't attack bishops on squares of a different color.\n    # So, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place is the\n    # number of edge squares of a single color.\n    max_bishops_on_edge = total_edge_squares / 2\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate how many edge squares are empty.\n    # This is the total number of edge squares minus the ones occupied by bishops.\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - max_bishops_on_edge\n\n    print(\"To solve this, we first find the total number of edge squares on an 8x8 board.\")\n    print(f\"An 8x8 board has {total_edge_squares} edge squares.\")\n    print(\"\\nTo place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, we can occupy all edge squares of a single color.\")\n    print(f\"There are {int(max_bishops_on_edge)} edge squares of one color.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, a maximum of {int(max_bishops_on_edge)} bishops can be placed on the edge without attacking each other.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe number of edge squares that lack bishops is the total minus the number of bishops placed.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal calculation:\")\n    print(f\"{total_edge_squares} - {int(max_bishops_on_edge)} = {int(empty_edge_squares)}\")\n\nsolve_bishops_puzzle()\n\n# The final answer is the number of empty squares.\nprint(\"\\n<<<14>>>\")\n```"
