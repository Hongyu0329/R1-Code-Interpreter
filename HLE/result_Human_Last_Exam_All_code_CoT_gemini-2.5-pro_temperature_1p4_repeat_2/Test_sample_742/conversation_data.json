    "Of course. Here is my plan to address your question.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the User's Question:** The user wants to know if the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics (QM) can be used to prove Gödel's ontological proof for the existence of God-like entities.\n2.  **Examine Gödel's Ontological Proof:** This proof is a work of formal logic. It uses modal logic (specifically, system S5) and higher-order logic. Its axioms and theorems are about abstract concepts like \"properties,\" \"essence,\" \"positive properties,\" and \"necessary existence.\" It does not rely on physics.\n3.  **Examine the Mathematics of Quantum Mechanics:** The \"customary setting\" for QM math involves Hilbert spaces (complex vector spaces), linear operators, the Schrödinger equation, and the Born rule for probabilities. This framework is designed to model the behavior of physical systems (particles, energy, fields) and make probabilistic predictions about measurement outcomes.\n4.  **Compare the Two Systems:** The two mathematical systems are fundamentally different and operate in entirely separate domains.\n    *   Gödel's proof is a metaphysical argument within a system of logic.\n    *   Quantum mechanics is a physical theory described by a specific set of mathematical tools from analysis and linear algebra.\n5.  **Conclusion on Feasibility:** There is no known or plausible way to derive the axioms or theorems of Gödel's logical system from the mathematical postulates of quantum mechanics. You cannot use a Hilbert space or a wave-function to prove a theorem about \"positive properties\" as defined by Gödel. The two systems do not intersect in a way that would allow for such a proof. Therefore, the answer is no.\n6.  **Formulate the Code:** Since the request is impossible, the Python code will not perform the proof. Instead, it will serve an educational purpose. It will:\n    *   Define the core concepts of both systems symbolically.\n    *   Print them out to illustrate their fundamental differences.\n    *   State the conclusion that one cannot be used to prove the other.\n    *   To satisfy the strange constraint \"output each number in the final equation,\" I will create a symbolic inequality representing this conclusion, such as `G(P) ≠ f(H, ψ)`, and then print each character of that symbolic \"equation\" to fulfill the instruction literally.\n\nHere is the Python code that illustrates this conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef explain_incompatibility():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains why quantum mechanics cannot be used to prove\n    Gödel's ontological argument.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Gödel's Ontological Proof is based on modal logic and axioms about properties.\n    godel_concepts = {\n        'Axiom 1': \"A property is positive if and only if its negation is not positive.\",\n        'Axiom 2': \"Any property entailed by a positive property is positive.\",\n        'Theorem 1': \"The property of being God-like is positive.\",\n        'Axiom 3': \"Being God-like is an essential property of any individual that has it.\",\n        'Axiom 4': \"Necessary existence is a positive property.\",\n        'System': \"Modal Logic S5\"\n    }\n\n    # Quantum Mechanics is based on a mathematical framework for physics.\n    qm_concepts = {\n        'Postulate 1': \"The state of a system is described by a vector |ψ⟩ in a Hilbert space H.\",\n        'Postulate 2': \"Observables are represented by Hermitian operators.\",\n        'Postulate 3': \"Time evolution is governed by the Schrödinger equation: iħ(d/dt)|ψ(t)⟩ = Ĥ|ψ(t)⟩.\",\n        'Postulate 4': \"The probability of measuring an eigenvalue is given by the Born rule.\",\n        'System': \"Linear Algebra, Probability Theory, and Differential Equations\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Gödel's Ontological Proof Framework ---\")\n    for key, value in godel_concepts.items():\n        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Quantum Mechanics Mathematical Framework ---\")\n    for key, value in qm_concepts.items():\n        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"The two systems operate in different domains.
