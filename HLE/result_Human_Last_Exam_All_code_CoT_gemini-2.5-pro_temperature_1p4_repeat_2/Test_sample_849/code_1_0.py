    Determines the safe goal for a model M that cannot prove predictive success
    due to the uncomputability of the set of successful predictors.

    The model M must pursue a goal that is computable and achievable based on
    the information it has access to.

    1. The type of learning: The model learns how to select a good predictor from
       its repertoire for a specific task. This is "learning to learn," or
       'meta-learning'. This is a safe goal because it's a process of
       improvement, not a claim of guaranteed success.

    2. The source of information: The model cannot rely on a priori proofs. It
       can only use the empirical evidence it gathers, which includes the
       initial sequence and the feedback from its predictions. This information
       source is its 'observations'.

    The completed template is "{learning_type} from {information_source}".
