    "My plan is to first identify the currently used common name for the bee genus *Perdita*. Then, I will research the origin of this common name to find the earliest verifiable publication where it was used, which I will consider as the year it was \"coined\" for public and scientific use. Finally, I will write a Python script to store these two pieces of information (the name and the year) in variables and then print them in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef get_bee_common_name_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the common name and the year it was coined for the bee genus 'Perdita'.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The genus in question is \"Perdita\".\n    # Based on entomological sources and publications, its common name is \"Fairy bees\".\n    common_name = \"Fairy bees\"\n    \n    # The term was used in the publication \"Native bees are a rich resource in urban California gardens\"\n    # by Frankie, G. W., et al. in the journal California Agriculture.\n    # We will use the year of this publication as the \"coined\" date.\n    year = 2005\n\n    # The final answer is formatted as \"<name>, <year>\".\n    # The print statement below will construct and display this string.\n    print(f\"{common_name}, {year}\")\n\nget_bee_common_name_info()\n```\n<<<Fairy bees, 2005>>>"
