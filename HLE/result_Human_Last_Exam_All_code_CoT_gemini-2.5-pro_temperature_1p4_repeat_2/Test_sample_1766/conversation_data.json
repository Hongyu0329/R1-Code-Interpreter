    "Of course, I can help you with that. This is a classic quantum mechanics problem involving the addition of angular momenta. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the quantum numbers:** For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 1`, and the spin quantum number is `s = 1/2`.\n2.  **Determine total angular momentum (j):** The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, is found by adding `l` and `s`. The possible values for `j` range from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n3.  **Determine magnetic quantum numbers (m_j):** For each value of `j`, the magnetic quantum number, `m_j`, can take `2j + 1` values, ranging from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n4.  **Calculate eigenvalues:**\n    *   The eigenvalues of the $J^2$ operator are given by `ħ² * j * (j + 1)`.\n    *   The eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are given by `ħ * m_j`.\n5.  **Code the solution:** I will write a Python script that calculates and prints all the possible pairs of `(J^2, J_z)` eigenvalues for a p-electron. The script will set `ħ=1` for the numerical calculation and represent it as a symbol (`ħ` or `hbar`) in the output strings, clearly showing how the eigenvalues are formed.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbital_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues for J^2 and J_z\n    for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1\n    s = 0.5\n    \n    print(f\"Solving for the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron (l={l}, s={s}).\")\n    print(\"The eigenvalues of J^2 are of the form j(j+1)ħ².\")\n    print(\"The eigenvalues of J_z are of the form m_j*ħ.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    # j takes values from |l-s| to l+s in integer steps\n    j_values = np.arange(j_min, j_max + 1, 1.0)\n\n    # Iterate through each possible j value\n    for j in j_values:\n        # Step 4: Calculate J^2 eigenvalue\n        j2_eigenvalue_val = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        print(f\"For the state with total angular momentum quantum number j = {j}:\")\n        print(f\"  The eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1)ħ² = {j}({j}+1)ħ² = {j2_eigenvalue_val:.2f}ħ².\")\n        \n        # Step 3: Determine the possible m_j values for the current j\n        mj_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1.0)\n        \n        print(f\"  The possible magnetic quantum numbers m_j are: {', '.join(map(str, mj_values))}.\")\n        print(\"  The corresponding common eigenvalue pairs (for J^2, J_z) are:\")\n\n        # Iterate through m_j values and print the pair of eigenvalues\n        for mj in mj_values:\n            # J_z eigenvalue is mj*ħ\n            jz_eigenvalue_val = mj\n            print(f\"    - ( {j2_eigenvalue_val:.2f}ħ², {jz_eigenvalue_val:+.1f}ħ ) for the state |j, m_j> = |{j}, {mj:+.1f}>\")\n        print(\"-\" * 60)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_spin_orbital_coupling()\n```\n<<<j=1/2, 3/2>>>"
