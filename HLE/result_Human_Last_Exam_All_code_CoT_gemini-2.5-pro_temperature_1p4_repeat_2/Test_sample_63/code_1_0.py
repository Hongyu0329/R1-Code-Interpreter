# The user's riddle asks to identify a man based on two clues:
# 1. A description by Kurt Vonnegut as looking "like a porcupine."
# 2. A name consisting of two words that start with the same letter.

# The direct quote from Vonnegut is about composer Johannes Brahms, but his name (J, B) is not alliterative.
# A fitting answer that satisfies the spirit of the riddle is the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
# He has a strong connection to Vonnegut's work, a famously "prickly" personality,
# and an alliterative first name.

# Storing the two words of his name.
first_word = "Jean"
second_word = "Jacques"

# Printing the two-word name as the solution.
print(f"The man's name is: {first_word} {second_word}")
