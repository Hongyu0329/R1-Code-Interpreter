    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principles and formulas:**\n    *   Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in position (`Δx`) and the uncertainty in momentum (`Δp`): `Δp ≈ ħ / (2 * Δx)`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   The formula for the momentum (`p`) of an electron in the first Bohr orbit (`n=1`). The angular momentum is quantized: `L = r * p = n * ħ`. For the first orbit, `p = ħ / r₁`, where `r₁` is the radius of the first Bohr orbit, also known as the Bohr radius (`a₀`).\n\n2.  **Formulate the ratio:**\n    *   The desired ratio is `Δp / p`.\n    *   Substitute the formulas from step 1: `(ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a₀)`.\n    *   The reduced Planck constant `ħ` cancels out, simplifying the ratio to `a₀ / (2 * Δx)`.\n\n3.  **Define the given values and physical constants:**\n    *   Uncertainty in position `Δx = 10 pm = 10 * 10⁻¹² m`.\n    *   Bohr radius `a₀ ≈ 5.29177 * 10⁻¹¹ m`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final ratio using Python:**\n    *   Write a script to define the values for `a₀` and `Δx`.\n    *   Compute the ratio using the simplified formula.\n    *   Print the final equation with all the numbers, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_momentum_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron\n    to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Physical Constants and Given Values ---\n\n    # Bohr radius (radius of the first Bohr orbit), in meters\n    bohr_radius_a0 = 5.29177e-11\n\n    # Given uncertainty in position, in meters (10 pm = 10 * 10^-12 m)\n    uncertainty_position_dx = 10e-12\n\n    # --- Calculation ---\n\n    # The ratio of momentum uncertainty to momentum (Δp / p) simplifies to:\n    # (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a₀) = a₀ / (2 * Δx)\n    # where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    # We can directly calculate this simplified ratio.\n\n    ratio = bohr_radius_a0 / (2 * uncertainty_position_dx)\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    print(\"This script calculates the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the momentum (p) of an electron in the first Bohr orbit.\")\n    print(\"The formula for the ratio Δp / p simplifies to a₀ / (2 * Δx).\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Equation ---\")\n    print(f\"Ratio = Bohr Radius / (2 * Uncertainty in Position)\")\n    print(f\"Ratio = {bohr_radius_a0} m / (2 * {uncertainty_position_dx} m)\")\n    print(f\"Final Ratio = {ratio}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_momentum_ratio()\n```\n<<<2.645885>>>"
