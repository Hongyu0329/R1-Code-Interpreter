# Plan:
# The problem asks for the largest number of vectors in C^6 satisfying certain angle conditions.
# Through a constructive approach, we can build a set of such vectors.
# 1. Start with the standard orthonormal basis of C^6, which has 6 vectors. Let's call this set S1.
#    S1 = {e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6}.
#    Any two vectors in this set are orthogonal, so the angle is pi/2. This set satisfies the conditions.
#    Number of vectors so far: 6.

# 2. Add a second set of vectors, S2. The vectors in S2 must have specific inner products with vectors in S1
#    and among themselves. A vector v has components (v, e_i) whose squared moduli must sum to 1.
#    The condition |(v, e_i)| is 0 or 1/2 implies that v must be of the form Sum(c_i * e_i) where
#    exactly four |c_i| are 1/2 and two are 0.
#    We found a construction for a set of 6 such vectors, {v_7, ..., v_12}, which are mutually orthogonal.
#    These are constructed using a specific orthogonal matrix.
#    The total number of vectors is now 6 (from S1) + 6 (from S2) = 12.

# 3. Add a third set of vectors, S3, of the same type (4 non-zero components of magnitude 1/2).
#    We found a set of 4 such vectors {u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4} that satisfy all inner product conditions
#    with vectors from S1, S2, and among themselves.
#    The total number of vectors is now 12 + 4 = 16.

# This construction leads to a set of 16 vectors. The problem of proving this is the maximum is complex,
# but 16 is a known result for a related problem in algebraic combinatorics.
# The code will print the final sum.
