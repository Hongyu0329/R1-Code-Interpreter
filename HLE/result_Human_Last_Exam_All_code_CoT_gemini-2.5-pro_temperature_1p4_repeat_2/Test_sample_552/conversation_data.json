    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the core question, which is about a specific historical fact: the person whose lectures were cited by Albert Einstein in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\nSecond, since this is a factual question rather than a computational one, I will write a Python script that stores this information in variables and then prints it in a clear and informative way. This fulfills the requirement of providing an answer using code.\n\nThird, the script will:\n1.  Store the name of the scientist in a variable.\n2.  Store a brief explanation in another variable.\n3.  Print the explanation and the answer.\n\nFinally, I will provide the direct answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef find_cited_scientist():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the scientist whose work\n    was foundational to Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The scientist whose work on statistical mechanics was foundational\n    # for Einstein's paper.\n    scientist_name = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n\n    # Explanation of the context.\n    explanation = (\n        \"In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, 'On the motion of small particles\\n\"\n        \"suspended in a stationary liquid, as required by the molecular-kinetic\\n\"\n        \"theory of heat,' Albert Einstein built his theoretical treatment upon\\n\"\n        \"the principles of statistical mechanics.\\n\\n\"\n        \"The primary architect of this field, whose work (disseminated through\\n\"\n        \"publications and lectures) was foundational for Einstein's own, was:\"\n    )\n\n    # Print the information for the user.\n    print(explanation)\n    print(\"\\n\" + scientist_name)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_cited_scientist()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
