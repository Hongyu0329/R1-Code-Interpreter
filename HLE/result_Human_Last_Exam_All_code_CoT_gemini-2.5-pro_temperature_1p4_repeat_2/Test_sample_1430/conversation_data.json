    "To find the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Néron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$, the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface $C$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate the Néron-Severi rank to Hodge theory.** The rank of the Néron-Severi group, $\\rho(X)$, also known as the Picard number, is the number of algebraically independent divisor classes on $X$. It is bounded by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}(X) = \\dim H^{1,1}(X, \\mathbb{C})$. For the varieties in question (symmetric powers of curves), the Hodge conjecture holds, meaning $\\rho(X)$ is precisely the dimension of the space of rational $(1,1)$-classes.\n\n2.  **Compute the Hodge numbers of X.** The Hodge numbers of $X = C^{(d)}$ can be calculated from the genus $g$ of the curve $C$ and the degree $d$ of the symmetric power. We are given $g=3$ and $d=15$.\n    *   The second Betti number $b_2(X)$ can be found using the Macdonald formula, whose generating function implies that for $d \\ge 2$, $b_2(C^{(d)}) = g(2g-1)+1$.\n    *   For a symmetric power $X=C^{(d)}$ with $d \\ge g$, the Hodge number $h^{2,0}(X)$ is given by the formula $h^{2,0}(X) = \\binom{g}{2}$. By Hodge symmetry, $h^{0,2}(X) = h^{2,0}(X)$.\n    *   Using the decomposition $b_2(X) = h^{2,0}(X) + h^{1,1}(X) + h^{0,2}(X)$, we can compute $h^{1,1}(X)$.\n\n3.  **Determine the structure of the Néron-Severi group of X.** For $d \\ge g$, the Néron-Severi group of $C^{(d)}$ is closely related to that of the Jacobian of the curve, $J(C)$. There is an isomorphism of groups up to numerical equivalence which implies their ranks are related by the formula: $\\rho(C^{(d)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\n4.  **Find the range of possible ranks for the Jacobian.** The problem then reduces to finding the minimum and maximum possible values for $\\rho(J(C))$ for a curve $C$ of genus 3.\n    *   The **smallest** rank, $\\rho(J(C))=1$, is achieved for a generic curve $C$, whose Jacobian has endomorphism ring $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The **largest** rank, $\\rho(J(C)) = g^2$, is achieved for very special curves whose Jacobians have maximal complex multiplication. For $g=3$, such curves exist (e.g., the Klein quartic), leading to $\\rho(J(C))=9$.\n\nBy combining these results, we can find the smallest and largest possible ranks for $\\rho(X)$. The following Python code implements this calculation and prints the results.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Neron-Severi group\n    of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    g = 3  # Genus of the curve C\n    d = 15 # Degree of the symmetric power X = C^(d)\n\n    print(f\"Let C be a Riemann surface of genus g = {g}.\")\n    print(f\"Let X be its d-th symmetric power, X = C^({d}).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the second Betti number b_2(X)\n    # For d >= 2, b_2(C^(d)) = g(2g-1) + 1\n    if d >= 2:\n        b2_X = g * (2 * g - 1) + 1\n        print(f\"Step 1: The second Betti number b_2(X) is g*(2g-1) + 1 = {g}*(2*{g}-1) + 1 = {b2_X}.\")\n    else:\n        # A more complex calculation would be needed for d<2, but it's not our case.\n        print(\"The case for d < 2 is not considered here.\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the Hodge number h^{2,0}(X)\n    # For d >= g, h^{2,0}(C^(d)) = g C 2\n    if d >= g:\n        h20_X = math.comb(g, 2)\n        print(f\"Step 2: The Hodge number h^(2,0)(X) is C(g, 2) = C({g}, 2) = {h20_X}.\")\n        # By Hodge symmetry, h^(0,2)(X) is also h20_X\n        h02_X = h20_X\n    else:\n        print(\"The case for d < g is not considered here.\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the Hodge number h^{1,1}(X)\n    # b_2(X) = h^(2,0)(X) + h^(1,1)(X) + h^(0,2)(X)\n    h11_X = b2_X - h20_X - h02_X\n    print(f\"Step 3: The Hodge number h^(1,1)(X) is b_2(X) - h^(2,0)(X) - h^(0,2)(X) = {b2_X} - {h20_X} - {h02_X} = {h11_X}.\")\n    print(f\"This means the rank of the Neron-Severi group, rho(X), is at most {h11_X}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Step 4: Use the formula relating rho(X) and rho(J(C))\n    # For d >= g, rho(X) = rho(J(C)) + 1\n    print(\"Step 4: The rank rho(X) is related to the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of C, rho(J(C)).\")\n    print(f\"For d={d} >= g={g}, the formula is: rho(X) = rho(J(C)) + 1.\")\n    \n    # Step 5: Find the range of rho(J(C)) for a genus 3 curve\n    # Smallest rho(J(C)) = 1 (for a generic curve)\n    # Largest rho(J(C)) = g^2 (for a special curve with Complex Multiplication)\n    min_rho_JC = 1\n    max_rho_JC = g**2\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe possible range for rho(J(C)) for a genus 3 curve is known:\")\n    print(f\" - Smallest rho(J(C)) = {min_rho_JC} (for a generic curve).\")\n    print(f\" - Largest rho(J(C)) = g^2 = {g}^2 = {max_rho_JC} (for special curves, e.g., the Klein quartic).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 6: Calculate the smallest and largest possible ranks for X\n    smallest_rank = min_rho_JC + 1\n    largest_rank = max_rho_JC + 1\n\n    print(\"Final Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Smallest possible rank of NS(X) = (Smallest rho(J(C))) + 1 = {min_rho_JC} + 1 = {smallest_rank}\")\n    print(f\"Largest possible rank of NS(X) = (Largest rho(J(C))) + 1 = {max_rho_JC} + 1 = {largest_rank}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The smallest possible rank is 2.\")\n    print(\"The largest possible rank is 10.\")\n\n\nsolve_neron_severi_rank()\n```\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
