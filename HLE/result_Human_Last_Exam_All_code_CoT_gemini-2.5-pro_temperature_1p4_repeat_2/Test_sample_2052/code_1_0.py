# This script provides answers to the theoretical questions about the matrix model.
# The reasoning is based on the standard understanding of superintegrability and
# W-algebra actions in the context of matrix models.

# Part (a): Does superintegrability hold for n = 3 in the matrix model Z_{-3}(t)?
# The problem statement provides a character expansion for Z_{-n}(t) which is valid for n >= 2.
# The existence of such a character expansion is the definition of superintegrability
# for this class of models. Since n=3 is in the valid range, superintegrability holds.
answer_a = "Yes"

# Part (b): For n = 4, is the operator W_hat_{-4} necessary to generate Z_{-4}(t)?
# The operator W_hat_{-n} is the generator that introduces the potential term Tr(Phi^n)/n.
# The generators {W_hat_{-m}} for m >= 2 are generally independent generators
# of the associated W-algebra. Therefore, to generate the model corresponding to n=4,
# the operator W_hat_{-4} is required and cannot be constructed from other generators.
answer_b = "Yes"

# The final answer is printed in the specified format.
print(f"(a) {answer_a}; (b) {answer_b}")
