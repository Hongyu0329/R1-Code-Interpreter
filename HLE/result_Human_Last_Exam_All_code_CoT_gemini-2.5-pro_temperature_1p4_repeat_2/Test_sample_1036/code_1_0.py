    Calculates the number of positive integers n <= lcm(1, ..., 100)
    that have the property that n gives different remainders when divided by
    each of 2, 3, ..., 100.
    
    Let L = lcm(1, 2, ..., 100). We are looking for the number of integers n
    with 1 <= n <= L such that the remainders r_k = n mod k are all distinct
    for k in {2, 3, ..., 100}.

    Let's analyze the conditions on these remainders.
    For any pair of integers i, j in {2, ..., 100} where i divides j (j=mi),
    n = r_j (mod j) => n = r_j (mod i).
    Also n = r_i (mod i).
    So, r_j = r_i (mod i).
    Since all remainders must be distinct, r_i != r_j.
    This means r_j = r_i + q*i for some non-zero integer q.
    As 0 <= r_i < i and 0 <= r_j < j=mi, q must be in {1, 2, ..., m-1}.

    Let's consider the special case where j = 2k, for k in {2, 3, ..., 50}.
    Here m=2, so q must be 1. This means r_{2k} = r_k + k.
    This condition must hold for all k from 2 to 50.

    Let n = q_k * k + r_k, where q_k = floor(n/k).
    The condition r_{2k} = r_k + k translates to q_k = floor(n/k) being an odd integer.
    This must be true for all k in {2, 3, ..., 50}.

    Let's test candidate solutions of the form n = L - c.
    The quotient q_k = floor((L-c)/k).
    For k in {2, ..., 100}, L is divisible by k.
    q_k = floor(L/k - c/k) = L/k - ceil(c/k) if k does not divide c.
    q_k = L/k - c/k if k divides c.
    The power of 2 in L is 6 (from 64=2^6). For any k in {2, ..., 50}, the highest
    power of 2 is 5 (from 32=2^5). Thus, v_2(k) <= 5 < v_2(L).
    This implies L/k is always an even number for k in {2, ..., 50}.
    
    For q_k to be odd, its parity must be odd.
    If k does not divide c: parity(q_k) = parity(even - ceil(c/k)) = parity(ceil(c/k)). So ceil(c/k) must be odd.
    If k divides c: parity(q_k) = parity(even - c/k) = parity(c/k). So c/k must be odd.
    This must hold for all k from 2 to 50.

    Case c=1: For any k>1, k does not divide 1. ceil(1/k) = 1, which is odd. This holds for all k.
    The remainders are r_k = (L-1)%k = k-1. The set of remainders is {1, 2, ..., 99}, which are all distinct.
    So, n = L-1 is a solution.

    Case c=2: If k>2 and k does not divide 2, ceil(2/k) = 1 (odd). This holds.
    If k=2, it divides 2. c/k = 2/2 = 1, which is odd. This holds.
    So the quotient condition holds for all k.
    The remainders are r_k = (L-2)%k. r_2=0, and for k>2, r_k = k-2.
    The set of remainders is {0, 1, ..., 98}, which are all distinct.
    So, n = L-2 is a solution.

    Case c=3: Let k=2. 2 does not divide 3. ceil(3/2) = 2, which is even. The condition fails.
    So n = L-3 is not a solution. We can check directly: r_2 = (L-3)%2 = 1 and r_4 = (L-3)%4 = 1. Not distinct.

    Case c>2: We can show that for any c > 2, there is some k in {2, ..., 50} for which the condition on the quotient fails.
    For example, if c>2, there's always an integer k in [c/2, c). If this k is in {2, ..., 50}, ceil(c/k)=2, which is even.
    This works for c up to 101. For larger c, a similar argument with ceil(c/k)=2m can be made.
    
    This analysis strongly suggests that only n = L-1 and n = L-2 are solutions. While a full proof that no other types of solutions exist is very complex, this line of reasoning is robust for this type of problem.
