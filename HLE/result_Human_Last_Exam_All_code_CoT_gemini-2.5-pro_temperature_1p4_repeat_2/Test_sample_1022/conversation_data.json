    "To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Use the Künneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology**: For two groups $G_1$ and $G_2$, the dimension of the bounded cohomology of their direct product can be calculated using a Künneth-like formula. For any degree $n$, the formula is:\n    $\\dim H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=n} \\dim H_b^p(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\times \\dim H_b^q(G_2; \\mathbb{R})$\n\n2.  **State the Known Cohomology Dimensions for Thompson's Group T**: The dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of Thompson's group T with trivial real coefficients, $\\dim H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R})$, are well-established mathematical results:\n    *   $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n    *   $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n    *   $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n    *   $\\dim H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 3$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula for the Specific Case**: We need to compute the dimension for $G_1 = T$, $G_2 = T$, and degree $n=4$. We will sum the products of the dimensions for all non-negative integer pairs $(p, q)$ such that $p+q=4$:\n    *   $(p, q) = (0, 4)$\n    *   $(p, q) = (1, 3)$\n    *   $(p, q) = (2, 2)$\n    *   $(p, q) = (3, 1)$\n    *   $(p, q) = (4, 0)$\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation by defining a function for the known dimensions of $H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R})$ and then applying the Künneth formula for $n=4$.\n\n```python\ndef get_dim_Hb_T(k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the dimension of the k-th bounded cohomology group of Thompson's group T\n    with trivial real coefficients, based on established mathematical results.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k == 0:\n        return 1\n    elif k == 2:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 0\n\ndef compute_dim_product_cohomology(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the dimension of the n-th bounded cohomology group of T x T\n    using the Künneth formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_dim = 0\n    print(f\"To compute the dimension of H_b^{n}(T x T; R), we use the Künneth formula:\")\n    print(f\"dim(H_b^{n}(T x T)) = Sum_{{p+q={n}}} [ dim(H_b^p(T)) * dim(H_b^q(T)) ]\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # We need to sum over all integer pairs (p, q) such that p+q=n\n    sum_string_parts = []\n    for p in range(n + 1):\n        q = n - p\n        dim_p = get_dim_Hb_T(p)\n        dim_q = get_dim_Hb_T(q)\n        term_value = dim_p * dim_q\n        total_dim += term_value\n        \n        # Print the breakdown of each term in the summation\n        print(f\"Term for (p={p}, q={q}): dim(H_b^{p}(T)) * dim(H_b^{q}(T)) = {dim_p} * {dim_q} = {term_value}\")\n        sum_string_parts.append(str(term_value))\n\n    # Print the final equation with all the numbers\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    final_equation = f\"dim(H_b^{n}(T x T)) = \" + \" + \".join(sum_string_parts)\n    print(final_equation)\n    print(f\"Total dimension = {total_dim}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # The degree of the cohomology group we are interested in is 4.\n    degree = 4\n    compute_dim_product_cohomology(degree)\n```\n<<<1>>>"
