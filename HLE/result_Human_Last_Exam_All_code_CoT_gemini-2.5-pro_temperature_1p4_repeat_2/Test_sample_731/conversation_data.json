    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The problem concerns the semidihedral group of size 512. The general form for a semidihedral group is $SD_{2^n}$, where $2^n$ is the order (size) of the group. We'll first find the value of $n$ corresponding to the size 512.\n\n2.  **Recall the Theory of Power Subgroups:** A power subgroup is a subgroup formed by taking the k-th power of every element in the parent group. A key theorem from group theory states that for a semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ (where $n \\ge 3$), the total number of distinct power subgroups is simply $n$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Theorem:** We will verify that our value of $n$ satisfies the condition $n \\ge 3$. Then, we can directly use the theorem to find the answer.\n\n4.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will write a simple Python script to calculate $n$ from the group size and then print the final answer based on the theorem. The code will also show the calculation step as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # Step 1: Identify the parameter 'n' for the semidihedral group SD_{2^n}.\n    # The order of the group is 2^n. We solve the equation 2^n = 512.\n    # n = log2(512)\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    print(\"The group is the semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as SD_512.\")\n    print(f\"This group is of the form SD_(2^n), where 2^n = {group_size}.\")\n    print(f\"Solving for n gives: n = log2({group_size}) = {n}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the relevant theorem.\n    # For a semidihedral group SD_{2^n} with n >= 3, the number of power subgroups is n.\n    # Here, n = 9, which is greater than or equal to 3.\n    if n >= 3:\n        number_of_subgroups = n\n        print(f\"Since n = {n} >= 3, the theorem applies.\")\n        print(f\"The number of power subgroups in SD_{group_size} is equal to n.\")\n        print(f\"Final Answer: {number_of_subgroups}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The case for n < 3 is different, but n=9 here.\")\n\nsolve_power_subgroups()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
