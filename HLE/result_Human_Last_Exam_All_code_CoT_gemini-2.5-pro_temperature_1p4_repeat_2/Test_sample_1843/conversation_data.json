    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Decomposition of the Character Group**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if its decomposition into characters $\\chi_{p^a}$ for each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$ consists of characters that are themselves primitive modulo $p^a$. The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters.\n\n2.  **Prime Factorization**: First, we find the prime factorization of $N = 36036$. This is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$. Thus, any character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$, where each $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a character modulo the respective prime power. For $\\chi$ to be primitive, each component $\\chi_{p^a}$ must be a primitive character.\n\n3.  **Counting Primitive Characters**: For each prime power modulus $p^a$, we will determine the number of primitive characters and their possible orders. We are interested in characters whose order is 6, which means the lcm of the orders of the components must be 6. This requires that each component's order must be a divisor of 6 (i.e., 1, 2, 3, or 6), at least one component's order must be a multiple of 2, and at least one must be a multiple of 3.\n\n4.  **Applying Inclusion-Exclusion**: We will count the total number of combinations of primitive characters where each component's order divides 6. Let this count be $C_6$. Then, we will subtract the combinations where the lcm of the orders divides 3 ($C_3$) and the combinations where the lcm of the orders divides 2 ($C_2$). By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of characters of order 6 is $C_6 - C_3 - C_2 + C_1$, where $C_1$ counts combinations where the order is 1 (which is 0 for primitive characters with conductor > 1).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: We will use the counts from the previous step to compute the final answer.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function, which counts the number of elements of a given order in a cyclic group.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\nprint(\"Let N be the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6.\")\nprint(\"The conductor is N = 36036 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 * 13.\")\nprint(\"A character chi is primitive mod N if it is a product of primitive characters for each prime power factor.\")\nprint(\"The order of chi is the lcm of the orders of its components.\\n\")\n\n# For each modulus, count primitive characters with orders dividing 6.\n# c_m[k] is the number of primitive characters mod m of order k.\n\n# Mod 4: Primitive characters have order 2.\nc4 = {2: 1}\n# Mod 9: Primitive characters have orders 3 and 6.\nc9 = {3: phi(3), 6: phi(6)} # {3: 2, 6: 2}\n# Mod 7: Primitive characters have orders 2, 3, 6.\nc7 = {2: phi(2), 3: phi(3), 6: phi(6)} # {2: 1, 3: 2, 6: 2}\n# Mod 11: Primitive characters have orders 2, 5, 10.\nc11 = {2: phi(2), 5: phi(5), 10: phi(10)} # {2: 1, 5: 4, 10: 4}\n# Mod 13: Primitive characters have orders 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\nc13 = {2: phi(2), 3: phi(3), 4: phi(4), 6: phi(6), 12: phi(12)} # {2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 2, 6: 2, 12: 4}\n\nprint(\"We count the number of choices for each component character (chi_4, chi_9, chi_7, chi_11, chi_13):\")\n\n# Number of combinations where all orders divide 6 (lcm divides 6)\nn4_div_6 = c4.get(2, 0)\nn9_div_6 = c9.get(3, 0) + c9.get(6, 0)\nn7_div_6 = c7.get(2, 0) + c7.get(3, 0) + c7.get(6, 0)\nn11_div_6 = c11.get(2, 0)\nn13_div_6 = c13.get(2, 0) + c13.get(3, 0) + c13.get(6, 0)\nC6 = n4_div_6 * n9_div_6 * n7_div_6 * n11_div_6 * n13_div_6\n\nprint(f\"Number of choices where order divides 6 for mod 4: {n4_div_6}\")\nprint(f\"Number of choices where order divides 6 for mod 9: {n9_div_6}\")\nprint(f\"Number of choices where order divides 6 for mod 7: {n7_div_6}\")\nprint(f\"Number of choices where order divides 6 for mod 11: {n11_div_6}\")\nprint(f\"Number of choices where order divides 6 for mod 13: {n13_div_6}\")\nprint(f\"Total combinations where lcm of orders divides 6 (C_6) = {n4_div_6} * {n9_div_6} * {n7_div_6} * {n11_div_6} * {n13_div_6} = {C6}\\n\")\n\n# Number of combinations where all orders divide 2 (lcm divides 2)\nn4_div_2 = c4.get(2, 0)\nn9_div_2 = c9.get(2, 0)\nn7_div_2 = c7.get(2, 0)\nn11_div_2 = c11.get(2, 0)\nn13_div_2 = c13.get(2, 0)\nC2 = n4_div_2 * n9_div_2 * n7_div_2 * n11_div_2 * n13_div_2\nprint(f\"Total combinations where lcm of orders divides 2 (C_2) = {n4_div_2} * {n9_div_2} * {n7_div_2} * {n11_div_2} * {n13_div_2} = {C2}\")\n\n# Number of combinations where all orders divide 3 (lcm divides 3)\nn4_div_3 = c4.get(3, 0)\nn9_div_3 = c9.get(3, 0)\nn7_div_3 = c7.get(3, 0)\nn11_div_3 = c11.get(3, 0)\nn13_div_3 = c13.get(3, 0)\nC3 = n4_div_3 * n9_div_3 * n7_div_3 * n11_div_3 * n13_div_3\nprint(f\"Total combinations where lcm of orders divides 3 (C_3) = {n4_div_3} * {n9_div_3} * {n7_div_3} * {n11_div_3} * {n13_div_3} = {C3}\")\n\n# Number of combinations where all orders divide 1 (lcm divides 1)\nC1 = 0\nprint(f\"Total combinations where lcm of orders divides 1 (C_1) = {C1}\\n\")\n\n# By the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, the number of characters with order exactly 6 is:\n# N = C_6 - C_2 - C_3 + C_1\nresult = C6 - C2 - C3 + C1\n\nprint(\"By the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, the final number is:\")\nprint(f\"N = C_6 - C_2 - C_3 + C_1 = {C6} - {C2} - {C3} + {C1} = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<100>>>"
