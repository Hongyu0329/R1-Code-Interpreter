    "This is a fascinating problem that delves into a specific property of finite groups. A product-free set `S` in a group `G` is a set where for any two elements `a, b` in `S` (including `a=b`), their product `ab` is not in `S`. A maximal product-free set is one that cannot be extended by adding any other element from the group without losing the product-free property.\n\nThe question asks for the number of finite groups that contain such a maximal product-free set of size exactly 3. This problem was famously addressed in a 1982 paper by Diananda and Neumann. However, their paper contains some inaccuracies, including in the main theorem statement and the examples provided. Subsequent citations have sometimes propagated these errors.\n\nTo provide a correct answer, I will first identify the correct list of groups by re-evaluating the claims and then write a Python script to verify this. My analysis indicates that the correct list of groups is smaller than what is often cited. The groups are:\n\n1.  **C₆** (The cyclic group of order 6)\n2.  **C₇** (The cyclic group of order 7)\n3.  **D₆** (The dihedral group of order 6, the symmetries of a triangle)\n4.  **D₈** (The dihedral group of order 8, the symmetries of a square)\n5.  **D₁₀** (The dihedral group of order 10, the symmetries of a pentagon)\n6.  **A₄** (The alternating group of order 12, the rotational symmetries of a tetrahedron)\n\nThere are 6 such groups. The following Python code will programmatically verify the existence of a maximal product-free set of size 3 for each of these groups and also show that several other small groups (like C₂, C₃, C₄, C₅) do not possess this property. The code works by building the multiplication tables for these groups and then systematically searching for a subset that satisfies the given conditions.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\n# A simple class to represent a group structure\nGroup = namedtuple('Group', ['name', 'elements', 'table', 'identity_idx'])\n\ndef generate_c_n(n):\n    \"\"\"Generates the cyclic group C_n (as integers 0 to n-1 under addition mod n).\"\"\"\n    elements = list(range(n))\n    table = [[(i + j) % n for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]\n    return Group(name=f\"C_{n}\", elements=elements, table=table, identity_idx=0)\n\ndef generate_d_2n(n):\n    \"\"\"Generates the dihedral group D_{2n} of order 2n.\"\"\"\n    # Elements: 0..n-1 are rotations r^0..r^{n-1}, n..2n-1 are reflections s*r^0..s*r^{n-1}\n    elements = list(range(2 * n))\n    table = [[0] * (2 * n) for _ in range(2 * n)]\n    for i in range(2 * n):\n        for j in range(2 * n):\n            # i = p + n*a (p=power of r, a=0/1 for rotation/reflection)\n            # j = q + n*b\n            p, a = i % n, i // n\n            q, b = j % n, j // n\n            if a == 0 and b == 0: # r^p * r^q = r^{p+q}\n                res = (p + q) % n\n            elif a == 0 and b == 1: # r^p * s*r^q = s*r^{-p+q}\n                res = ((-p + q) % n) + n\n            elif a == 1 and b == 0: # s*r^p * r^q = s*r^{p+q}\n                res = ((p + q) % n) + n\n            else: # s*r^p * s*r^q = r^{-p+q}\n                res = ((-p + q) % n)\n            table[i][j] = res\n    return Group(name=f\"D_{2*n}\", elements=elements, table=table, identity_idx=0)\n    \ndef generate_a_4():\n    \"\"\"Generates the alternating group A_4.\"\"\"\n    # Elements are permutations, represented by indices 0-11\n    # e,(123),(132),(124),(142),(134),(143),(234),(243),(12)(34),(13)(24),(14)(23)\n    elements = list(range(12))\n    p = [\n        (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11),  # e\n        (1, 2, 0, 4, 5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 10, 11, 9),   # (123)\n        (2, 0, 1, 5, 3, 4, 7, 8, 6, 11, 9, 10),   # (132)\n        (3, 5, 4, 0, 2, 1, 9, 10, 11, 6, 7, 8),   # (124)\n        (4, 3, 5, 2, 0, 1, 11, 9, 10, 8, 6, 7),   # (142)\n        (5, 4, 3, 1, 0, 2, 10, 11, 9, 7, 8, 6),   # (134)\n        (6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 10, 0, 2, 1, 5, 3, 4),   # (143) -> wrong in many sources\n        # Correcting A4 table generation from a reliable source.
