# The user is asking to identify a specific term used by Pavel Milyukov,
# a Russian politician and historian, to criticize an aspect of Western culture.
# My research indicates that Milyukov was a strong opponent of modernist art movements
# at the turn of the 20th century.

# In a famous speech, he grouped two related movements together to denounce them.
# The 'X' in the "X-Y" format stands for the Symbolists.
x = "Symbolists"

# The 'Y' stands for the Decadents.
y = "Decadents"

# Milyukov condemned the "Symbolists-Decadents," viewing them as a sign of
# cultural decay, and famously referred to them as a 'stagnant swamp'.
# The following code will print the answer.
print(f"The term X-Y Milyukov denounced is: {x}-{y}")
