    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to calculate the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Theory and Formula:** The problem asks for the scaling exponent α for the specific heat using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion. We will use the standard formula for α derived from renormalization group theory for the n-vector model, calculated to the first order in ϵ. The formula is:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n\n2.  **Define Parameters:**\n    *   `n`: The number of components of the order parameter. For the most common case, the Ising model, `n = 1`. We will use this value.\n    *   `d_c`: The upper critical dimension. For this class of models, `d_c = 4`.\n    *   `d`: The spatial dimension given in the problem, `d = 3`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Epsilon (ϵ):** The expansion parameter `ϵ` is defined as the difference between the upper critical dimension and the spatial dimension:\n    `ϵ = d_c - d`\n\n4.  **Substitute and Compute:** Substitute the values of `n` and `ϵ` into the formula for α to get the final result.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the formula with the values plugged in, as well as the final numerical answer.\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha (α) using the epsilon expansion.\n\n    In the context of renormalization group theory, the epsilon expansion is a technique\n    used to calculate critical exponents near the upper critical dimension (d_c).\n    For the n-vector model, the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4.\n\n    The scaling exponent α for the specific heat is given to the first order in epsilon (ϵ) by the formula:\n    α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\n\n    We will solve this for a system with spatial dimension d=3.
