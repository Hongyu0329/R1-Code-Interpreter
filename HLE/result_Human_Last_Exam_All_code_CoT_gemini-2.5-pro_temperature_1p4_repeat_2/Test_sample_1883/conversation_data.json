    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction with FMO Theory**: The reaction is an electrocyclization of an 8-pi electron system under thermal conditions. I will apply the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, which are derived from FMO theory, to determine the allowed mode of ring closure (disrotatory or conrotatory).\n2.  **Identify Pathways to Products A and B**: The problem states that both a *cis*-isomer (A) and a *trans*-isomer (B) are formed from the starting material, \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. I will determine the stereochemical pathway that leads to each product. This involves considering the reactive conformations of the starting material and its stereoisomers which can exist in thermal equilibrium.\n    *   The given \\((...,8E)\\)-isomer will be shown to cyclize to the *trans*-product (B).\n    *   The formation of the *cis*-product (A) will be explained by the cyclization of the \\((...,8Z)\\)-isomer, which is accessible via thermal isomerization.\n3.  **Apply the Curtin-Hammett Principle**: The ratio of the products is determined by the difference in the free energies of the transition states leading to A and B. I will estimate this energy difference by considering two factors:\n    *   The relative ground-state energies of the \\((...,8E)\\) and \\((...,8Z)\\) isomers.\n    *   The difference in steric strain (torquoselectivity) in the two conrotatory transition states. Specifically, the energetic penalty for rotating a bulky methyl group inward versus a smaller hydrogen atom.\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio**: I will write a Python script that uses the estimated energy values and the Arrhenius equation to calculate the product ratio `[A]/[B]` at a typical reaction temperature (100 °C). The script will explain each step of the reasoning and print the final calculated ratio.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and explain the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef predict_product_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the product ratio of a thermal electrocyclization using FMO theory\n    and transition state energy analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Part 1: Theoretical Background based on FMO Theory\n    print(\"--- Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"1.
