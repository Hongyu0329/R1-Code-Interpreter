    1. Starting material: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide
    2. Reagents: 
       a) sec-BuLi/TMEDA: A strong base for directed ortho-metalation. It deprotonates the C-2 position, which is ortho to both the amide and amino directing groups.
       b) Methyl Iodide (CH3I): An electrophile that gets attacked by the newly formed nucleophilic site.
    3. Result: A methyl group is added to the C-2 position.
