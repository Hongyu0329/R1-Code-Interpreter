Here is a step-by-step explanation of the chemical transformations:

**Starting Material: [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene**

First, let's correctly identify the starting material. The name indicates a benzene ring substituted with a (3S)-3-bromobutyl group. The structure is Phenyl-CH2-CH2-CH(Br)-CH3. A more systematic IUPAC name is (3S)-3-bromo-1-phenylbutane. The carbon atom attached to the bromine is a stereocenter with the (S) configuration.

**Step 1: Reaction with Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu)**

*   **Reaction:** The starting material, a secondary alkyl halide, is treated with potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu), which is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 elimination reaction over substitution.
*   **Mechanism (Hofmann Elimination):** In an E2 reaction, a base removes a beta-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the carbon with the leaving group). There are two types of beta-protons in the starting material: those on C2 (the -CH2- group) and those on C4 (the terminal -CH3 group). Because KOtBu is a bulky base, it preferentially removes the sterically more accessible proton. The protons on the terminal methyl group (C4) are much less hindered than the protons on the internal methylene group (C2). This selective removal of the less hindered proton is known as Hofmann elimination, which leads to the formation of the less substituted alkene.
*   **Product A:** The product of this reaction is **4-phenyl-1-butene** (structure: Phenyl-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2). The double bond is formed, and the chiral center at C3 is destroyed. Product A is achiral.

**Step 2: Hydroboration-Oxidation of Product A**

*   **Reaction:** Product A (4-phenyl-1-butene) is treated with borane in THF (BH3Â·THF), followed by an oxidative workup with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).
*   **Mechanism (Anti-Markovnikov Hydroboration-Oxidation):** This is a two-step process to convert an alkene into an alcohol. The key feature of this reaction is its anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity. The borane adds across the double bond, with the boron atom (which is later replaced by an -OH group) attaching to the less substituted carbon of the alkene, and a hydrogen atom attaching to the more substituted carbon.
*   **Product B:** The -OH group adds to the terminal carbon of the butene chain. The resulting product is **4-phenylbutan-1-ol** (structure: Phenyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH). This is a primary alcohol and is achiral.

**Step 3: Bromination of Product B**

*   **Reaction:** Product B (4-phenylbutan-1-ol) is treated with phosphorous tribromide (PBr3).
*   **Mechanism:** PBr3 is a standard reagent used to convert primary and secondary alcohols into their corresponding alkyl bromides. The reaction involves the substitution of the hydroxyl (-OH) group with a bromine (-Br) atom.
*   **Product C:** The hydroxyl group of the primary alcohol is replaced by a bromine atom. The final product, C, is revealed below.

---

**Final Product Identity, IUPAC Name, and Chirality**

The final product, C, is **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**.
*   **Structure:** Phenyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br

*   **IUPAC Name:** **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**

*   **Chirality Explanation:** The final product, 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, is **achiral**. The original stereocenter in the starting material was located at carbon 3. This stereocenter was destroyed in the first step of the synthesis (E2 elimination) to form the alkene, Product A. The subsequent reactions did not create any new stereocenters. Therefore, the resulting molecule has no chiral centers and is superimposable on its mirror image, making it achiral.
