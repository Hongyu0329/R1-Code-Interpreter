    explanation = """
    The question asks to identify the genetic alteration that leads to copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH). Let's break down this concept and evaluate the options:

    1.  **Understanding Copy-Neutral Loss of Heterozygosity (CN-LOH):**
        *   **Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH):** A cell normally has two different versions (alleles) of a gene, one from each parent. LOH occurs when one of these alleles is lost.
        *   **Copy-Neutral:** Despite the loss of one allele's information, the total number of chromosomes remains the same (usually two copies).
        *   **In summary:** CN-LOH is an event where a cell loses one parental allele but duplicates the remaining one, resulting in two identical copies. The gene dosage is maintained, but the genetic diversity is lost.

    2.  **Analyzing the Choices:**
        *   **A. Mitotic recombination:** This is a mechanism that can cause LOH. While it can be copy-neutral, it is one of several processes that can lead to the state described.
        *   **B. A deletion of a chromosomal region:** This causes LOH but is NOT copy-neutral. It results in a copy number loss (from two copies to one).
        *   **C. Trisomy:** This is the presence of an extra chromosome, resulting in a copy number GAIN (three copies), not copy-neutral.
        *   **D. Uniparental disomy (UPD):** This term means having two copies ('disomy') of a chromosome from a single parent ('uniparental'). This condition perfectly describes CN-LOH. The cell has two copies of the chromosome (copy-neutral), but since both came from one parent, any heterozygous loci are lost (LOH). This is the most accurate and encompassing description of the phenomenon among the choices.
        *   **E. Duplication of a chromosomal region:** This results in a copy number GAIN, not copy-neutral.

    3.  **Conclusion:**
        While mitotic recombination is a valid mechanism, Uniparental Disomy is the term that best defines the resulting state of having two copies of a chromosome from one parent, which is the essence of copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity.
