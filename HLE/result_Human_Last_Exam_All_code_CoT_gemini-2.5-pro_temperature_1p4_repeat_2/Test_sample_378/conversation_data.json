    "Based on my research, the user's question is based on a false premise. The former President of Nigeria is named Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, not Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan. There is no public record of him ever identifying himself as \"Azikiwe\".\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that clarifies this misunderstanding. The script will print a message explaining that Goodluck Jonathan has never publicly used the name \"Azikiwe\" and that his middle name is Ebele.\n\n```python\ndef check_name_identification():\n    \"\"\"\n    Addresses the user's question about Goodluck Jonathan identifying as \"Azikiwe\".\n    \"\"\"\n    person_name = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    queried_name = \"Azikiwe\"\n    \n    explanation = (\n        f\"The question is based on an incorrect premise.
