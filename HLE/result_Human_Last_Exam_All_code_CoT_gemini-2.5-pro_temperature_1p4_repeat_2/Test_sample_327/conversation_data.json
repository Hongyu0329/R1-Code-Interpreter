    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we can construct its simplest representation as a single stack of colored pieces.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Representation**: The value ($V$) of a stack of red and blue pieces can be calculated using a signed binary expansion. The formula is:\n    $V = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{c_i}{2^{i-1}} = \\frac{c_1}{1} + \\frac{c_2}{2} + \\frac{c_3}{4} + \\dots$\n    where $i$ is the position of the piece from the bottom (starting at $i=1$), and $c_i$ is `+1` for a red piece and `-1` for a blue piece. The total number of pieces is $n$, the number of terms in the sum.\n\n2.  **Algorithm**: We can find the required sequence of colored pieces using a greedy algorithm.\n    *   Start with the value we need to represent, $V = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n    *   For each position $i$ from 1 upwards, we determine the color of the piece. If the remaining value to be represented is positive, we choose a red piece ($c_i=1$). If it is negative, we choose a blue piece ($c_i=-1$).\n    *   We then subtract the value of that piece in the expansion ($\\frac{c_i}{2^{i-1}}$) from the remaining value.\n    *   We repeat this until the remaining value becomes zero. The number of steps taken gives us the total number of pieces.\n\n3.  **Execution**: I will provide a Python script to execute this algorithm. The script will calculate the sequence of pieces, print the step-by-step process, display the final equation, and output the total number of pieces.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_hackenbush(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of pieces needed to represent the fraction p/q\n    in red-blue-Hackenbush and prints the derivation.\n    \"\"\"\n    target_value = Fraction(p, q)\n    print(f\"Finding the Hackenbush representation for the number {target_value}\")\n    print(\"The value of a stack of pieces is calculated using the formula:\")\n    print(\"V = c_1/1 + c_2/2 + c_3/4 + ...\")\n    print(\"where c_i is +1 for a Red piece and -1 for a Blue piece at level i.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    colors = []\n    remaining_value = target_value\n    i = 1\n\n    while remaining_value != 0:\n        # Determine the color/coefficient c_i based on the sign of the remaining value\n        if remaining_value > 0:\n            c = 1\n            color = \"Red\"\n        else:\n            c = -1\n            color = \"Blue\"\n        \n        colors.append(color)\n        \n        # The value of the piece at level i is c_i / 2^(i-1)\n        piece_value = Fraction(c, 2**(i - 1))\n        \n        print(f\"Step {i}:\")\n        print(f\"  Remaining value to represent: {remaining_value}\")\n        print(f\"  The sign is positive, so we choose a {color} piece.\")\n        print(f\"  Value of this piece's term = {piece_value}\")\n        \n        # Subtract the piece's value from the remainder\n        remaining_value -= piece_value\n        print(f\"  New remaining value = {remaining_value - piece_value} - ({piece_value}) = {remaining_value}\")\n        print(\"-\" * 25)\n        \n        i += 1\n        # Safety break to prevent infinite loops, though not expected with dyadic rationals\n        if i > q + 5:\n            print(\"Error: Exceeded expected number of iterations.\")\n            break\n\n    print(\"Calculation finished.
