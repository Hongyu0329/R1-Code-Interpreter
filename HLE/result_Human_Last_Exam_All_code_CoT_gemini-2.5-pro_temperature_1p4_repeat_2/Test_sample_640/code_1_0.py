def analyze_scattering_statements():
    """
    Analyzes statements about multichannel quantum scattering.

    This function evaluates five statements based on the theoretical relationships
    between the potential V(r), the Jost matrix F(E), and the S-matrix S(E).

    Let "TC" mean "Trivially Coupled" (diagonalizable by a constant matrix).
    Let "NTC" mean "Nontrivially Coupled".

    Key Links:
    1. V-F Link: V is TC <=> F is TC.
    2. F-S Link: F is TC => S is TC. (Converse is false).

    # Logic: It is known that NTC potentials/Jost matrices can produce a
    # diagonal S-matrix (asymptotic decoupling). An NTC potential is non-diagonal.
    # Therefore, a non-diagonal V(r) can lead to a diagonal S(E).

    # By the V-F Link, if F(E) is TC, then V(r) must also be TC.
    # This contradicts the premise that V(r) is NTC.
