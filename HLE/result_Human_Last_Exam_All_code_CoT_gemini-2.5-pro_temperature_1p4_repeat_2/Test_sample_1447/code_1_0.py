    This function determines the correct translation practices and prints the formatted answer.

    The riddle requires identifying a shared plot element in two mystery stories and then
    selecting the translation practices that could overcome the challenge this element poses.

    1.  The shared element in Asimov's "The Next Day" and Christie's "The Thumb Mark of
        St. Peter" is a plot-critical phonetic pun (a word or phrase that is misheard).
        - "The Next Day": The clue is the phrase "the next day", which is a mishearing of
          "The Nick's day" (referring to St. Nicholas's day).
        - "The Thumb Mark of St. Peter": The clue is the word "ichthus", which is
          misheard as "fish".

    2.  The translation challenge is that such phonetic puns are language-specific and do
        not translate literally. The solution must preserve the function of the pun as a
        clever puzzle for the reader.

    3.  Evaluating the options:
        - I (Transcreation): Creating a new, analogous pun in the target language. This is
          the ideal solution. It is a valid method.
        - II (Audio Links): Relies on the reader understanding English, breaking the
          narrative. This is not a true translation solution.
        - III (Changing Setting): A strategy to enable transcreation by providing a new
          cultural context for a new pun. It is a valid method.
        - IV (Foreigner with Accent): A strategy to provide a narrative reason for a
          mispronunciation, enabling a new pun. It is a valid method.
        - V (Illustration): This would give away the solution, destroying the mystery.
        - VI (Footnotes): This explains the puzzle instead of letting the reader
          experience it, destroying the narrative function.

    4.  The valid options that preserve the narrative puzzle are I, III, and IV. They should
        be listed in ascending order and separated by hyphens.
