    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the relationship and provide the corresponding Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Interpret the Mathematical Context:** The question relates to the geometry of numbers applied to real quadratic number fields. We are considering fields of the form $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is a squarefree natural number.\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Covolume (V):** For the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of the field $K$, its embedding into $\\mathbb{R}^2$ forms a lattice. The covolume $V$ is the volume of the fundamental domain of this lattice, which is equal to $\\sqrt{D_K}$, where $D_K$ is the discriminant of $K$.\n    *   **Maximum Norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$):** This non-standard term is best interpreted as the Minkowski bound, which provides an upper limit on the norm of an ideal that can be found in any ideal class. The theory guarantees that every ideal class has an ideal $I$ with a norm satisfying a certain inequality. The upper bound in this inequality is what we're looking for.\n3.  **Apply Minkowski's Bound:** For a real quadratic field ($n=2, r_2=0$), Minkowski's theorem provides a bound on the norm of an ideal $I$ in any given ideal class:\n    $$ \\text{Norm}(I) \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{D_K} $$\n4.  **Establish the Relationship:** By substituting the definition of the covolume, $V = \\sqrt{D_K}$, into the inequality, we get:\n    $$ \\text{Norm}(I) \\le \\frac{1}{2} V $$\n    This means the upper bound for the \"maximum norm\" ($k_{k,\\infty}$) in relation to the covolume ($V$) is given by the expression $\\frac{1}{2}V$. The constant factor in this relationship is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n5.  **Create a Python Script:** I will provide a Python script that takes a squarefree number $N$ as input, calculates the field discriminant and the covolume, and then prints the explicit inequality for that field, demonstrating the general relationship.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation for an example case.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_upper_bound_relation(N: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the relationship between the maximum norm and covolume\n    for the real quadratic field K = Q(sqrt(N)).\n\n    Args:\n        N (int): A squarefree natural number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Validate that N is a squarefree natural number.\n    if not isinstance(N, int) or N <= 0:\n        print(f\"Error: Input '{N}' must be a natural number (positive integer).\")\n        return\n\n    i = 2\n    temp_n = N\n    while i * i <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % (i * i) == 0:\n            print(f\"Error: Input N={N} is not squarefree as it is divisible by {i*i}.\")\n            return\n        i += 1\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the field K = Q(sqrt({N}))...\")\n\n    # 2. Calculate the discriminant D_K of the number field.\n    if N % 4 == 1:\n        discriminant = N\n    else:  # This covers N % 4 == 2 and N % 4 == 3\n        discriminant = 4 * N\n    print(f\"The discriminant of the field is D_K = {discriminant}.\")\n\n    # 3. Calculate the covolume V.\n    covolume = math.sqrt(discriminant)\n    print(f\"The covolume is V = sqrt({discriminant}) ≈ {covolume:.4f}.\")\n\n    # 4. The Minkowski bound gives the relation k_k,inf <= (1/2) * V.\n    constant = 0.5\n    bound_value = constant * covolume\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe upper bound for the maximum norm (k_k,∞) is {constant} times the covolume V.\")\n    print(f\"For K = Q(sqrt({N})), this value is {constant} * {covolume:.4f} ≈ {bound_value:.4f}.\")\n\n    # 5. Output the final relationship, showing each number in the equation.\n    print(\"\\nThe general relationship is expressed by the inequality:\")\n    print(f\"k_k,∞ <= {constant} * V\")\n\n\n# --- Main execution ---\n# We will use N=15 as an example squarefree natural number.\n# 15 = 3 * 5, so it is squarefree.\n# 15 % 4 = 3, so the discriminant D_K will be 4 * 15 = 60.\nexample_N = 15\nget_upper_bound_relation(example_N)\n\n```\n<<<0.5>>>"
