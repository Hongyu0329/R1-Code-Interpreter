# Step 1: Define the initial parameters from the problem description.
num_folds = 4
num_cuts_on_folded_paper = 4
num_original_edges = 4

# Step 2: Calculate the number of paper layers after all the folds.
# Each fold doubles the number of layers.
num_layers = 2**num_folds

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of new edges created by the cuts.
# Each of the 4 cuts goes through all the layers of the folded paper.
# Therefore, each cut creates a number of new edge segments equal to the number of layers.
new_edges_from_cuts = num_cuts_on_folded_paper * num_layers

# Step 4: Determine the number of original edge segments that remain.
# The cuts are made near the corners of the folded paper, which correspond to locations
# across the original paper (corners, edges, center). The cuts shorten the original 4
# edges of the square paper but do not eliminate them completely. The middle portion
# of each of the 4 original edges remains as a distinct edge in the final shape.
remaining_original_edges = num_original_edges

# Step 5: Calculate the total number of edges in the final unfolded shape.
# This is the sum of the new edges created by the cuts and the remaining original edges.
total_edges = new_edges_from_cuts + remaining_original_edges

# Step 6: Print the explanation and the final equation.
