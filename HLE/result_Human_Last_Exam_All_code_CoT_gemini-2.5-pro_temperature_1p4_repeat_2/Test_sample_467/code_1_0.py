# This script calculates the Morse index of a minimal surface M based on its given properties.
#

# 1. Define the parameters for the minimal surface M from the problem description.
#    - d: degree of the Gauss map g(z)
#    - g: genus of the surface M
#    - k: number of ends of the surface M

# 2. Determine the degree 'd' of the Gauss map g(z) = z / (z^3 + 2).
#    The degree of a rational function P(z)/Q(z) is max(deg(P), deg(Q)).
numerator_degree = 1
denominator_degree = 3
d = max(numerator_degree, denominator_degree)

# 3. Determine the genus 'g' and number of ends 'k'.
#    The surface M is conformally equivalent to the complex plane C.
#    Topologically, this is a sphere with one puncture (one end).
#    A sphere has genus 0.
g = 0
k = 1

# 4. Use the Nayatan formula for the Morse index of a complete minimal surface
#    with finite total curvature: index = 2*d - 2*g - k + 1
morse_index = 2 * d - 2 * g - k + 1

# 5. Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result.
print("To find the Morse index of the minimal surface M, we use the formula:")
print("index = 2*d - 2*g - k + 1")
print("\nFirst, we determine the parameters from the problem statement:")
print(f" - The Gauss map is g(z) = z/(z^3+2). Its degree 'd' is max(degree(numerator), degree(denominator)) = max(1, 3) = {d}.")
print(f" - The surface is conformally equivalent to C, so its genus 'g' is {g}.")
print(f" - As the surface is conformally equivalent to C (a punctured sphere), it has {k} end.")

print("\nNext, we substitute these values into the formula:")
print(f"index = 2 * {d} - 2 * {g} - {k} + 1")
print(f"index = {2*d} - {2*g} - {k} + 1")
print(f"index = {morse_index}")
print("\nThe Morse index of M is 6.")
