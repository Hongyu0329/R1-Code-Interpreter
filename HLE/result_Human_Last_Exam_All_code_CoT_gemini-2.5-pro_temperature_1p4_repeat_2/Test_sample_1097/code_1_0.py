    explanation = """
To apply the Banach fixed-point theorem to the boundary value problem:
u''(x) - exp(u(x)) = 0, for x in (0, 1)
u(0) = 0, u(1) = 0

We must define a complete metric space M and a contraction mapping T : M -> M whose fixed point is the solution.

1.  **Integral Operator Formulation:**
    The BVP can be rewritten as a fixed-point problem u = T(u) using the Green's function G(x, s) for the operator -d²/dx² with zero boundary conditions. The operator T is defined as:
    (Tu)(x) = integral from 0 to 1 of G(x, s) * exp(u(s)) ds
    The Green's function G(x,s) is non-positive, and its integral over s gives:
    integral from 0 to 1 of |G(x, s)| ds = x(1-x)/2, which has a maximum value of 1/8 at x = 1/2.

2.  **Key Property of the Solution:**
    From the differential equation, u''(x) = exp(u(x)) > 0. This implies that any solution u(x) must be convex. A convex function on [0, 1] that is 0 at the endpoints (u(0) = u(1) = 0) must be non-positive everywhere else, i.e., u(x) <= 0.

3.  **Defining the Set M:**
    This physical insight guides us to define our space M as a set of non-positive functions. We choose M to be a closed subset of the Banach space C([0, 1]) (space of continuous functions on [0, 1] with the sup-norm), making M a complete metric space. Let's define M as:
    M = {u in C([0, 1]) | u(0) = u(1) = 0 and -R <= u(x) <= 0 for x in [0, 1]}
    for some constant R > 0.

4.  **Verifying Banach's Conditions:**

    a) **T is a Contraction:** We need to find the Lipschitz constant q for T on M.
       ||Tu - Tv||_inf <= (sup_{c in [-R,0]} exp(c)) * (max_x integral |G(x,s)|ds) * ||u - v||_inf
       Since u, v are in M, their values lie in [-R, 0]. The intermediate value c from the Mean Value Theorem also lies in [-R, 0]. Therefore, exp(c) <= exp(0) = 1.
       The maximum of the integral part is 1/8.
       So, the Lipschitz constant q <= 1 * (1/8) = 1/8.
       Since q = 1/8 < 1, T is a contraction on M for any R > 0.

    b) **T maps M to M:** We need to ensure that if u is in M, then T(u) is also in M.
       For u in M, u(x) <= 0, so exp(u(x)) <= exp(0) = 1.
       ||Tu||_inf = sup_x |(Tu)(x)| <= sup_x integral(|G(x,s)| * |exp(u(s))|)ds
       ||Tu||_inf <= (sup exp(u(s))) * (max_x integral |G(x,s)|ds) <= 1 * (1/8) = 1/8.
       For T(u) to be in M, we need ||Tu||_inf <= R. This gives the condition: R >= 1/8.

5.  **Conclusion:**
    We need to satisfy R >= 1/8. The simplest and most elegant choice is to set R = 1/8. This leads to the following definition for the set M.

The set M you should define is:
M = {u in C([0, 1]) | u(0) = u(1) = 0 and -1/8 <= u(x) <= 0 for all x in [0, 1]}
