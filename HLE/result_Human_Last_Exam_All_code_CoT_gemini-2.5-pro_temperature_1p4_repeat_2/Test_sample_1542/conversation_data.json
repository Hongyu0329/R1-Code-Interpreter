    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of orbits of the set of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ under the action of the group of invertible linear transformations $GL_2(R)$.\n\nA quadratic form in two variables is defined by a polynomial $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where the coefficients $a, b, c$ are elements of $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, each quadratic form can be represented by a tuple $(a, b, c)$.\n\nAn invertible linear transformation is given by a matrix $P = \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11} & p_{12} \\\\ p_{21} & p_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$ where the entries are in $R$ and the determinant $\\det(P) = p_{11}p_{22} - p_{12}p_{21}$ is a unit in $R$. The units in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$. This group of matrices is denoted as $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe action of a transformation $P$ on a quadratic form $Q$ results in a new quadratic form $Q'$ defined by $Q'(x, y) = Q(p_{11}x + p_{12}y, p_{21}x + p_{22}y)$. The coefficients $(a', b', c')$ of $Q'$ can be calculated from $(a, b, c)$ and the entries of $P$.\nThe transformation rules for the coefficients are:\n$a' = a p_{11}^2 + b p_{11}p_{21} + c p_{21}^2$\n$b' = 2ap_{11}p_{12} + b(p_{11}p_{22} + p_{12}p_{21}) + 2cp_{21}p_{22}$\n$c' = a p_{12}^2 + b p_{12}p_{22} + c p_{22}^2$\nAll calculations are performed modulo 8.\n\nTwo quadratic forms are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by such an invertible linear transformation. The problem is to count the number of such equivalence classes (orbits).\n\nI will write a Python script to solve this computationally. The plan is as follows:\n1.  Generate all possible quadratic forms $(a, b, c)$, where $a, b, c \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 7\\}$. There are $8^3 = 512$ such forms.\n2.  Generate all matrices in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$. A $2 \\times 2$ matrix over $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ is in this group if its determinant is one of $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\n3.  For each quadratic form, compute its entire orbit by applying every matrix in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n4.  To identify unique orbits, we'll find a canonical representative for each orbit. A simple choice for the canonical representative is the lexicographically smallest tuple $(a, b, c)$ in the orbit.\n5.  We will store these canonical representatives in a set to ensure that each equivalence class is counted only once.\n6.  The final answer will be the number of elements in the set of canonical representatives.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the number of equivalence classes.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_equivalence_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables\n    over the ring Z/8Z.\n    \"\"\"\n    R = 8\n    units = {1, 3, 5, 7}\n\n    # Generate all 2x2 matrices with entries in Z/8Z\n    all_matrices = []\n    entries = list(range(R))\n    for p11, p12, p21, p22 in itertools.product(entries, repeat=4):\n        all_matrices.append(((p11, p12), (p21, p22)))\n\n    # Filter for matrices in GL_2(Z/8Z)\n    gl2_z8 = []\n    for mat in all_matrices:\n        p11, p12 = mat[0]\n        p21, p22 = mat[1]\n        det = (p11 * p22 - p12 * p21) % R\n        if det in units:\n            gl2_z8.append(mat)\n\n    # Generate all quadratic forms (a, b, c)\n    all_forms = []\n    for a, b, c in itertools.product(entries, repeat=3):\n        all_forms.append((a, b, c))\n\n    # Use a set to store canonical representatives of orbits\n    canonical_forms = set()\n    \n    # Keep track of forms that have already been classified\n    classified_forms = set()\n\n    for form in all_forms:\n        if form in classified_forms:\n            continue\n\n        orbit = set()\n        a, b, c = form\n        \n        # Compute the orbit of the current form\n        for mat in gl2_z8:\n            p11, p12 = mat[0]\n            p21, p22 = mat[1]\n\n            # Apply the transformation\n            # Q'(x,y) = a(p11x+p12y)^2 + b(p11x+p12y)(p21x+p22y) + c(p21x+p22y)^2\n            \n            # New coefficient a'\n            a_prime = (a * p11**2 + b * p11 * p21 + c * p21**2) % R\n            \n            # New coefficient b'\n            b_prime = (2 * a * p11 * p12 + b * (p11 * p22 + p12 * p21) + 2 * c * p21 * p22) % R\n            \n            # New coefficient c'\n            c_prime = (a * p12**2 + b * p12 * p22 + c * p22**2) % R\n            \n            orbit.add((a_prime, b_prime, c_prime))\n        \n        # Add all forms in the orbit to the classified set\n        for f in orbit:\n            classified_forms.add(f)\n            \n        # Find the canonical representative (lexicographically smallest) and add to the set\n        canonical_form = min(orbit)\n        canonical_forms.add(canonical_form)\n\n    # Print the final count\n    print(f\"The number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over Z/8Z is:\")\n    print(len(canonical_forms))\n\ncount_equivalence_classes()\n```\n<<<20>>>"
