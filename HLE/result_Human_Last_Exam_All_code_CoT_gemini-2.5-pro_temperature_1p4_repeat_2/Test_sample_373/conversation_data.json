    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph:** First, I will define the structure of a barbell graph with 10 nodes. A standard barbell graph is composed of two identical, fully connected subgraphs (cliques), which are connected by a single edge. This connecting edge is known as the \"bottleneck.\" For a 10-node graph, this means we have two 5-node cliques (`K_5`).\n2.  **Define Randomized Uniform Gossiping:** This gossiping protocol works in two steps:\n    a. A node is selected uniformly at random from the entire graph.\n    b. The selected node then chooses one of its neighbors uniformly at random to gossip with. The edge between these two nodes is considered \"sampled\".\n3.  **Identify the Bottleneck Edge:** Let's name the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge as `u` and `v`.\n4.  **Calculate Node Degrees:** I will determine the degree (number of neighbors) for nodes `u` and `v`. Since `u` is part of a 5-node clique, it's connected to 4 other nodes in its clique, plus it's connected to `v`. Therefore, its degree is `4 + 1 = 5`. The same applies to node `v`.\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:** The bottleneck edge `(u, v)` is sampled if one of two mutually exclusive events happens:\n    a. Node `u` is chosen first, and then it chooses `v`.\n    b. Node `v` is chosen first, and then it chooses `u`.\n    I will calculate the probability for each event and sum them up to get the total probability. The formula is:\n    `P(sample edge) = P(choose u) * P(u chooses v) + P(choose v) * P(v chooses u)`\n6.  **Construct Python Code:** I will write a Python script that implements these calculations, prints the logic, shows the final equation with all the numbers, and provides the final probability.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_gossip_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph\n    with 10 nodes using randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define the parameters of the barbell graph.\n    # Total number of nodes in the graph.\n    total_nodes = 10\n    # A 10-node barbell graph consists of two K_5 cliques.\n    clique_size = 5\n\n    # 2. Define the nodes connected by the bottleneck edge. Let's call them u and v.\n    # We need to find their degrees.\n    \n    # 3. Calculate the degree of the nodes connected by the bottleneck.\n    # A node in a K_n clique is connected to (n-1) other nodes in that clique.\n    # The bottleneck edge adds one more connection.\n    degree_of_bottleneck_node = (clique_size - 1) + 1\n\n    # 4. Calculate the probability based on the two ways the edge can be sampled.\n    # In randomized uniform gossiping, we first pick a node uniformly at random.\n    prob_pick_any_node = 1 / total_nodes\n\n    # Case A: We pick node 'u' first, and it picks neighbor 'v'.\n    # The probability that 'u' picks 'v' is 1 / degree(u).\n    prob_u_then_v = prob_pick_any_node * (1 / degree_of_bottleneck_node)\n\n    # Case B: We pick node 'v' first, and it picks neighbor 'u'.\n    # The probability is the same due to symmetry.\n    prob_v_then_u = prob_pick_any_node * (1 / degree_of_bottleneck_node)\n\n    # The total probability is the sum of these two mutually exclusive cases.\n    total_probability = prob_u_then_v + prob_v_then_u\n\n    # 5.
