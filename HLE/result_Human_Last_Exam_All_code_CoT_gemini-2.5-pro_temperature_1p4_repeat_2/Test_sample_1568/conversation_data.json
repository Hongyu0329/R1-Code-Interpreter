    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\nThe goal is to find a closed-form expression for the infinite product $\\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$. I will use the properties of the Gamma function, specifically its infinite product representation (the Weierstrass product), to solve this.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  First, I will factor the term inside the product, $1 - z^3/n^3$, using the complex cube roots of unity. The cube roots of unity are $1, \\omega, \\omega^2$, where $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$. This allows us to write the product as a combination of three simpler products.\n2.  Next, I will find the closed form for the product starting from $n=1$, i.e., $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$. This is a known result that can be derived using the Weierstrass product formula for the Gamma function:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-x)} = e^{\\gamma x} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1-\\frac{x}{n}\\right)e^{x/n} $$\n    By applying this formula to each of the three products from step 1 and combining them, the exponential convergence factors conveniently cancel out, yielding a compact expression in terms of Gamma functions.\n3.  Finally, I will adjust the result from step 2 to match the desired starting index of $n=3$. This is done by dividing the expression for the product from $n=1$ by the terms corresponding to $n=1$ and $n=2$.\n\nThis procedure will give the final symbolic expression for the infinite product. The provided python code will then print this final formula in a clear and readable format.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to evaluate the infinite product:\n# Product_{n=3 to infinity} (1 - z^3 / n^3)\n#\n# The final result can be expressed using the Gamma function.\n# The following code prints the symbolic formula for the product.\n\n# The equation is of the form: Product = Numerator / Denominator\n# Let's define the parts of the formula.\n# In the formula, 'z' is a complex variable.\n# 'Gamma' represents the Gamma function.\n# 'exp(j*theta)' is the complex exponential e^(j*theta).\n\n# The formula contains several numbers: 1, 3, 8, 2, 4.\n# As requested, the code will output these numbers directly in the final equation.\n\nnumerator = \"1\"\n\nterm1 = \"(1 - z**3)\"\nterm2 = \"(1 - z**3 / 8)\"\nterm3 = \"Gamma(1 - z)\"\nterm4 = \"Gamma(1 - z * exp(i*2*pi/3))\"\nterm5 = \"Gamma(1 - z * exp(i*4*pi/3))\"\n\ndenominator = f\"{term1} * {term2} * {term3} * {term4} * {term5}\"\n\nprint(\"The infinite product is equal to:\")\nprint(f\"{numerator} / ({denominator})\")\nprint(\"\\nWhere:\")\nprint(\"'z' is a complex variable.\")\nprint(\"'Gamma' is the Gamma function.\")\nprint(\"'i' is the imaginary unit.\")\nprint(\"'pi' is the mathematical constant pi.\")\nprint(\"'exp' is the exponential function.\")\n\n```\n<<<$ \\frac{1}{(1-z^3)(1-z^3/8)\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-ze^{i2\\pi/3})\\Gamma(1-ze^{i4\\pi/3})} $>>>"
