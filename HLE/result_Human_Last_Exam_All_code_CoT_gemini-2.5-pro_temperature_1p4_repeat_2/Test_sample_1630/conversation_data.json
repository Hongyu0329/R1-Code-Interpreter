    "A fixed point of a function $H(x)$ is a value of $x$ for which $H(x) = x$. We are asked to find the maximum number of fixed points for the function $H(x) = f(g(x))$, where $f$ and $g$ are polynomials of degree 3, and their derivatives $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are positive for all real numbers $x$.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Determine the degree of the composite function.**\n    Since $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both degree 3 polynomials, their composition $H(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the fixed-point equation.**\n    The fixed points are the solutions to the equation $H(x) = x$, which can be written as $H(x) - x = 0$. Since $H(x)$ is a degree 9 polynomial, $H(x) - x$ is also a degree 9 polynomial. A polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n3.  **Analyze the constraints.**\n    We are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$. This means both $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing functions.\n    Let's find the derivative of $H(x)$ using the chain rule: $H'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n    Since $g(x)$ can take any real value, $f'(g(x))$ is always positive. Also, $g'(x)$ is always positive. The product of two positive numbers is positive, so $H'(x)$ must be positive for all $x$. This means $H(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\n4.  **Use Rolle's Theorem to confirm the upper bound.**\n    Let $P(x) = H(x) - x$. We are looking for the maximum number of roots of $P(x)$. By Rolle's Theorem, between any two roots of $P(x)$, there must be at least one root of its derivative $P'(x)$.\n    $P'(x) = H'(x) - 1$.\n    Similarly, between any two roots of $P'(x)$, there is a root of $P''(x) = H''(x)$.\n    Let's determine the degree of $H''(x)$.\n    $H'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$.\n    $H''(x) = f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$.\n    Since $f$ and $g$ are degree 3 polynomials, $f', g'$ are degree 2; $f'', g''$ are degree 1; and $f''', g'''$ are constants.\n    The highest power of $x$ in $H''(x)$ comes from $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$. As $g(x)$ is degree 3 and $f''(x)$ is degree 1, $f''(g(x))$ is degree 3. As $g'(x)$ is degree 2, $(g'(x))^2$ is degree 4. The product is a polynomial of degree $3+4=7$.\n    So, $H''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, and can have at most 7 real roots.\n    -   $P''(x) = H''(x)$ has at most 7 roots.\n    -   By Rolle's theorem, $P'(x)$ has at most $7 + 1 = 8$ roots.\n    -   By Rolle's theorem, $P(x)$ has at most $8 + 1 = 9$ roots.\n    This confirms that the maximum number of fixed points is indeed 9.\n\n5.  **Show that 9 fixed points is achievable.**\n    To show that 9 fixed points are possible, we need to construct functions $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the conditions and result in $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ having 9 real roots.\n    Instead of explicitly finding complex $f$ and $g$, we can construct a valid composite function $H(x)$ and argue that it can be decomposed into appropriate $f$ and $g$.\n\n    a.  **Construct a polynomial with 9 fixed points and a positive derivative:** Let's start with a polynomial that has 9 distinct real roots, for example, the 9th-degree Chebyshev polynomial, $T_9(x)$, whose roots are all real and in the interval $[-1, 1]$. Let this polynomial be $P(x)$.\n    b.  Define a function $H(x) = x + \\epsilon P(x)$ for a small constant $\\epsilon$. The fixed points of $H(x)$ are the roots of $H(x) - x = \\epsilon P(x) = 0$, which are the 9 roots of $P(x)$.\n    c.  We need to ensure $H'(x) > 0$. $H'(x) = 1 + \\epsilon P'(x)$. The polynomial $P'(x)$ has a minimum value, say $m$. If $m$ is negative, we can choose a very small positive $\\epsilon$ such that $1 + \\epsilon m > 0$. This ensures $H'(x)$ is always positive.\n    d.  **Decomposability:** According to Ritt's theorems on polynomial decomposition, any polynomial of degree 9 can be decomposed into two polynomials of degree 3. Furthermore, the condition that $H'(x)$ is always positive implies that its constituent polynomials $f$ and $g$ must also be strictly monotonic (i.e., their derivatives have no real roots). Thus, an $H(x)$ constructed this way can be represented as $f(g(x))$ with $f'>0$ and $g'>0$.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates the construction of such a polynomial equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ that has 9 distinct real roots.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P\n\n# Step 1: Define a polynomial with 9 distinct real roots.\n# We use the roots of the 9th Chebyshev polynomial, T_9(x), which are known to be\n# x_k = cos((2k-1)pi / 18) for k = 1, ..., 9.\nn = 9\nchebyshev_roots = np.cos((2 * np.arange(1, n + 1) - 1) * np.pi / (2 * n))\n\n# Construct the monic polynomial P(x) with these roots.\n# This polynomial will represent the \"wiggling\" part of our function.\np_poly = P.Polynomial.fromroots(chebyshev_roots)\n\n# Step 2: Ensure the composite function H(x) is strictly increasing.\n# We define H(x) = x + epsilon * P(x).\n# We need H'(x) = 1 + epsilon * P'(x) > 0 for all x.\n# First, find the derivative P'(x).\np_prime_poly = p_poly.deriv()\n\n# Find the minimum value of P'(x).
