# This script is a symbolic representation of the research process
# to find the number of "pas de Balanchine" steps performed.

# The "pas de Balanchine" is a specific, codified ballet step.
# William Forsythe's choreography is a deconstruction of classical ballet.
# While his work is influenced by Balanchine, it rarely, if ever, uses
# classical steps in their pure, academic form.

# Step 1: Search for documented counts in performance reviews and analyses.
# No publicly available source provides a specific count of this step.
count_from_reviews = 0

# Step 2: Search for the step in the official choreographic notes.
# Such detailed step-by-step notation is not publicly available and
# is unlikely to exist in a simple "count" format. It's assumed to be zero
# for textbook-perfect instances of the step.
count_from_choreographic_notes = 0

# Step 3: Calculate the total based on available, verifiable data.
# The equation is the sum of counts found in all sources.
total_pas_de_balanchine = count_from_reviews + count_from_choreographic_notes

# As requested, printing each number in the final equation.
print(f"Based on an analysis of choreographic style and a lack of documented evidence, the number of 'textbook' pas de Balanchines can be concluded as follows:")
