    Analyzes the statements about attack graph analysis and identifies the incorrect one.

    A. Correct. Describes the graph structure and common analysis algorithms.
    B. Correct. Explains the state explosion problem, a key computational challenge.
    C. Incorrect. The generation problem's difficulty stems from its potentially exponential size (EXPTIME/PSPACE), not from being NP-hard, which is a common category error. NP-hardness typically applies to analysis problems (e.g., finding optimal attack paths) rather than the generation process itself.
    D. Correct. Highlights the crucial need for dynamic updates to reflect system changes.
    E. Correct. Describes the valid application of model checking for formal security verification.

    The only incorrect statement is C.
