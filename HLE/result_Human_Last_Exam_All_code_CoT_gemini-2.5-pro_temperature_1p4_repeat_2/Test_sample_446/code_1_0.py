    This function uses a knowledge-based approach. The RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) tripeptide is the core
    recognition sequence for many integrins. The flanking amino acids are critical for affinity
    and specificity. The RGDSP sequence is a well-characterized motif from fibronectin,
    a major integrin ligand. Therefore, the peptide containing this sequence is the most
    likely candidate.
