    "My plan is to answer the user's theological history question by first identifying the correct theologian and then presenting the answer in the requested Python code format.\n\n1.  **Identify the Theologian:** The question asks for a theologian who developed specialized terminology for changes in natural law, specifically referencing the virgin birth and the Fall. The key figure who developed an extensive and influential framework for this is Augustine of Hippo.\n\n2.  **Explain the Concepts:**\n    *   For miracles like the **virgin birth**, Augustine argued they were not contrary to nature as a whole (since God is the author of nature), but were \"against the *known course* of nature\" (*contra usitatum cursum naturae*). This provided a way to talk about miracles as divine acts that supersede the normal, observable rules without abolishing them.\n    *   For the **Fall**, Augustine taught that it resulted in a fundamental change to the created order itself. Nature, which was originally created \"very good,\" became subject to corruption, decay, and death as a consequence of human sin. This represents a lasting alteration in how the laws of nature operate, moving from a perfected state to a fallen one.\n\n3.  **Format the Output:** I will provide a simple Python script that prints the theologian's name. This fulfills the requirement of providing a code block for the user to execute.\n\n```python\ntheologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\nprint(theologian_name)\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
