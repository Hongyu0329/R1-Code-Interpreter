# The task is to identify the correct statement regarding the isolation of a corneal fibroblast cell line.
# Based on biological principles of cell culture, Choice C is the most accurate.
#
# Here's the reasoning:
# 1. Source of Cells: Fibroblasts are in the corneal stroma. Accessing the stroma requires removing the outer epithelium and inner endothelium.
# 2. Culture Conditions: Standard fibroblast culture uses a serum-containing medium. 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) is a common and effective concentration. 1% antibiotic is the standard to prevent contamination.
# 3. Cell Behavior: Healthy fibroblasts are anchorage-dependent, meaning they must adhere to the culture flask to grow.
#
# Choice C correctly states that stromal cells are cultured in a medium with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic, and that they adhere to the flask.
# The other choices contain significant inaccuracies in cell types, culture conditions, or expected cell behavior.

# Extracting the numerical values from the correct statement (Choice C)
percent_fbs = 10
percent_antibiotic = 1

print("The correct procedure involves culturing stromal cells in a specific medium.")
print("Based on the correct answer, the final equation for the key media supplements is:")
# Output each number in the final equation
print(f"Growth Medium = Basal Medium + {percent_fbs}% FBS + {percent_antibiotic}% Antibiotic")
