        "Background on Myotonic Dystrophy (DM1)": "DM1 is caused by an expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the DMPK gene. 'Somatic instability' means this repeat length tends to increase further in various body tissues over a person's life, worsening the disease.",
        "Function of LIG1": "LIG1 (DNA Ligase I) is a critical enzyme in DNA replication and repair. Its primary role is to seal 'nicks' (breaks in one DNA strand), particularly to join together Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand during DNA replication.",
        "Mechanism of Instability": "During the replication of long CTG repeat tracts, the DNA can form stable hairpin structures. These structures can disrupt the normal replication process.",
        "Impact of LIG1 Knockout": "When LIG1 is absent or deficient, the final step of sealing the DNA backbone at these problematic repeat sites is compromised. This leads to the accumulation of unligated nicks and DNA flaps. The cell's machinery attempts to repair this state, but in doing so, it often mistakenly incorporates the hairpin loop into the new DNA strand, resulting in an expansion of the repeat tract.",
        "Conclusion": "The loss of LIG1 function compromises the fidelity of DNA replication at CTG repeats, leading to a higher frequency of expansions. Therefore, knocking out LIG1 increases somatic instability."
