# The final expression to be calculated is derived from the solution of the differential equation.
# The expression is of the form: (3/2) * 10**(10/3) + (37/4)

# Define the components of the final equation
val1 = 3/2
val2 = 10
val3 = 10/3
val4 = 37/4

# Calculate the final result
result = val1 * (val2**val3) + val4

# Output the components of the equation as requested
