    Analyzes explanations for Japan's university entrant trends and identifies incorrect ones.

    The problem asks to identify the incorrect or inappropriate explanations for the trend where
    the number of university entrants in Japan has increased, despite a declining birthrate.

    1.  Analyze Option A: "The decrease in the 18-year-old population was smaller than predicted".
        This is factually incorrect. The 18-year-old population in Japan has declined sharply
        and consistently since its peak in 1992, roughly halving by 2024. The predictions of
        a steep decline were accurate. Therefore, this explanation is incorrect.

    2.  Analyze Option B: "Increase in university enrollment rate".
        This is correct. The university advancement rate has risen from under 30% in the
        early 1990s to over 50% in the 2020s. This is a primary driver that counteracts the
        population decline.

    3.  Analyze Option C: "Increased demand for re-learning by working adults".
        This is a correct, albeit smaller, contributing factor. Lifelong learning and
        reskilling are growing trends.

    4.  Analyze Option D: "Diversification of higher education... as a kind of prep schools".
        This is inappropriate/misleading. While transfers from two-year or vocational colleges
        exist, the dominant trend has been the decline of two-year colleges as students opt
        to enter four-year universities directly from high school. This is not a primary cause
        for the overall increase in entrants.

    5.  Analyze Option E: "Government policies".
        This is correct. The government eased university establishment standards, which led to a
        significant increase in the number of universities, thus increasing capacity and
        competition for students.

    Conclusion: The incorrect or inappropriate options are A and D.
    The final answer should list these letters alphabetically, separated by a comma.
    """
    incorrect_options = ["A", "D"]

    # Ensure the options are in alphabetical order
    incorrect_options.sort()

    # Format the output as a comma-separated string
    final_answer = ",".join(incorrect_options)

    print(final_answer)
