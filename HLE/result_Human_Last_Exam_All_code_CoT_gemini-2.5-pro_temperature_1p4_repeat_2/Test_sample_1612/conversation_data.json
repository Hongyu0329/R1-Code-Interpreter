    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the total number of MLB Triple Crown winners.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the two types of Triple Crowns in Major League Baseball: one for batters and one for pitchers.\n\n1.  **Batting Triple Crown:** A player must lead their league (American or National) in three categories in the same season: batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI).\n2.  **Pitching Triple Crown:** A pitcher must lead their league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA).\n\nNext, I will compile lists of all the players who have achieved these feats. Since some players have won a Triple Crown more than once, I will use a list of all instances and then count the number of *unique* players for each category.\n\nFinally, I will add the number of unique batting winners to the number of unique pitching winners to get the total number of individual players who have won an MLB Triple Crown. Since the skill sets are entirely different, no player has won both a batting and a pitching Triple Crown.\n\nThe Python code below will perform these steps: it stores the lists of all Triple Crown instances, calculates the number of unique winners for both batting and pitching, and then prints the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef count_mlb_triple_crown_winners():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the total number of unique MLB Triple Crown winners.\n    The data is compiled from historical MLB records.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Batting Triple Crown winners (instances)\n    # A player is listed for each time they won.\n    batting_winners_instances = [\n        \"Paul Hines\", \"Tip O'Neill\", \"Hugh Duffy\", \"Nap Lajoie\", \"Ty Cobb\",\n        \"Heinie Zimmerman\", \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"Chuck Klein\",\n        \"Jimmie Foxx\", \"Lou Gehrig\", \"Joe Medwick\", \"Ted Williams\", \"Ted Williams\",\n        \"Mickey Mantle\", \"Frank Robinson\", \"Carl Yastrzemski\", \"Miguel Cabrera\"\n    ]\n\n    # Pitching Triple Crown winners (instances)\n    # A pitcher is listed for each time they won.\n    pitching_winners_instances = [\n        \"Tommy Bond\", \"Old Hoss Radbourn\", \"Tim Keefe\", \"John Clarkson\", \"Amos Rusie\",\n        \"Cy Young\", \"Rube Waddell\", \"Christy Mathewson\", \"Christy Mathewson\",\n        \"Walter Johnson\", \"Walter Johnson\", \"Walter Johnson\", \"Dazzy Vance\",\n        \"Lefty Grove\", \"Lefty Grove\", \"Lefty Gomez\", \"Lefty Gomez\",\n        \"Grover Cleveland Alexander\", \"Grover Cleveland Alexander\", \"Grover Cleveland Alexander\",\n        \"Bucky Walters\", \"Hal Newhouser\", \"Sandy Koufax\", \"Sandy Koufax\", \"Sandy Koufax\",\n        \"Dwight Gooden\", \"Roger Clemens\", \"Roger Clemens\", \"Pedro Martinez\",\n        \"Randy Johnson\", \"Johan Santana\", \"Clayton Kershaw\", \"Justin Verlander\",\n        \"Shane Bieber\", \"Gerrit Cole\"\n    ]\n\n    # Use a set to get the count of unique players for each category\n    num_unique_batting_winners = len(set(batting_winners_instances))\n    num_unique_pitching_winners = len(set(pitching_winners_instances))\n\n    # Calculate the total number of unique winners\n    total_unique_winners = num_unique_batting_winners + num_unique_pitching_winners\n\n    print(f\"Number of unique batting Triple Crown winners: {num_unique_batting_winners}\")\n    print(f\"Number of unique pitching Triple Crown winners: {num_unique_pitching_winners}\")\n    print(\"\\nTotal unique MLB Triple Crown winners is the sum of these two groups.\")\n    print(\"Final Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"{num_unique_batting_winners} + {num_unique_pitching_winners} = {total_unique_winners}\")\n\ncount_mlb_triple_crown_winners()\n<<<41>>>"
