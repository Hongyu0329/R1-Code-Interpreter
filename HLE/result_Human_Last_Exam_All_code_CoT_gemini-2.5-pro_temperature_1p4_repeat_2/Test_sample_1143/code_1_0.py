    # By checking the lyrics of Coldplay's 11-track albums, we can find the answer.
    # The album "A Rush of Blood to the Head" contains lyrics corresponding to many of these words.
    # For example:
    # Track 2, "In My Place", contains "trouble".
    # Track 3, "God Put a Smile upon Your Face", contains "sparks".
    # Track 5 is "Clocks".
    # Track 8, "Warning Sign", mentions a "desert island".
    # Track 10, "A Rush of Blood to the Head", contains "petrified".
    # Track 11, "Amsterdam", contains "breathless".
    # This thematic link is too strong to be a coincidence.
