def solve_diamond_problem():
    """
    Solves the diamond arrangement problem by constructing a worst-case scenario.

    The problem asks for the largest value k such that for every valid arrangement,
    at least k diamonds are movable. This is equivalent to finding the minimum
    number of movable diamonds over all possible arrangements.

    We can construct a "checkerboard" arrangement where diamonds are placed on
    all cells (r, c) where r + c is even. In this arrangement, we prove that
    no diamond is movable, making the minimum 0.
