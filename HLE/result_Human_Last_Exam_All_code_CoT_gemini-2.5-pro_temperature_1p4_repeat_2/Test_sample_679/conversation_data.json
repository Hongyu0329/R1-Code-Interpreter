    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: I will first look at the molecular formula, C7H14. By comparing it to the general formula for saturated alkanes (CnH2n+2), I can calculate the degree of unsaturation. This will tell me if the molecule contains double bonds or rings.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 13C NMR Data**: I will examine each signal provided:\n    *   **Chemical Shift**: The position of the signal (in ppm) indicates the chemical environment of the carbon (e.g., alkene, alkane).\n    *   **Multiplicity**: The splitting pattern (s, d, t, q) tells me how many hydrogens are directly attached to that carbon (s=0H, d=1H, t=2H, q=3H), based on the DEPT or off-resonance decoupled spectrum.\n    *   **Number of Signals**: Comparing the number of signals to the number of carbons in the formula tells me if there is any symmetry in the molecule.\n\n3.  **Piece Together the Structure**: I will use the information from the previous steps to build structural fragments and then assemble them into a complete molecule. I'll start with the most informative signals, which are typically those for double bonds or other functional groups.\n\n4.  **Verify and Name the Final Structure**: Once I have a candidate structure, I will verify that it is consistent with all the provided data (molecular formula and all NMR signals). Finally, I will determine the correct IUPAC name for the verified structure.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan and prints the solution.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Capture the original stdout to restore it later\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Create a string buffer to hold the output\noutput_buffer = io.StringIO()\n# Redirect stdout to the buffer\nsys.stdout = output_buffer\n\n\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemical structure puzzle based on the provided molecular formula and 13C NMR data.\n    The function prints the step-by-step reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula C7H14\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The general formula for a saturated alkane is C(n)H(2n+2).\")\n    print(\"For n=7, a saturated alkane would be C7H16.\")\n    print(\"The given formula, C7H14, has two fewer hydrogens, which corresponds to one degree of unsaturation.\")\n    print(\"This means the compound must contain either one C=C double bond or one ring structure.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the 13C NMR Data\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The provided signals are: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\")\n    print(\"- Signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are in the alkene region (approx. 100-150 ppm), confirming a C=C double bond.\")\n    print(\"- 145(s): The 's' for singlet indicates a quaternary carbon (0 hydrogens).
