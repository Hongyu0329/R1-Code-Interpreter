    # Analysis of the options:
    # A continuous map f sends points that are close to each other to points
    # that are also close to each other. In nonstandard analysis, this is
    # formalized using the concept of infinitesimals and monads.

    # Continuity at a *standard* point x_0 means that any point x_1
    # infinitesimally close to x_0 gets mapped to a point f(x_1)
    # that is infinitesimally close to f(x_0).

    # A function is continuous on its domain X (of standard points) if it is
    # continuous at every standard point x_0 in X.

    # Let's review the options based on this:
    # A: Is trivial as for standard points x_0, x_1, x_0 ~ x_1 implies x_0 = x_1 (in Hausdorff spaces).
    # B: This precisely captures the definition. For any standard point x_0,
    #    if x_1 is in the monad of x_0, then f(x_1) is in the monad of f(x_0).
    #    This must hold for all standard points for f to be continuous. This is correct.
    # C: This is the definition of *uniform continuity*, a stronger property.
    #    It requires the property to hold even for nonstandard points far from the standard part.
    # D, E, F: These are related to injectivity or continuity of the inverse map.
