    "Your question delves into the philosophy of language and mind, specifically Gareth Evans's Generality Constraint (GC). The GC posits that thought is systematic; if someone can think a certain thought (e.g., \"a is F\"), they must possess the conceptual resources to understand other thoughts that can be formed by recombining those same concepts (e.g., \"b is F\" or \"a is G,\" assuming they also have concepts for 'b' and 'G').\n\nMy plan is to model this philosophical principle using Python. I will create classes to represent different types of concepts (Predicates, Singular Terms, Quantifiers). Then, I'll create a `Thinker` class that can \"understand\" propositions by acquiring their constituent concepts. Finally, I will simulate your scenario: a `Thinker` who understands 'Fa' and universal quantification, and then check if they have the necessary concepts to form the thought '∀x(Fx)'. The code will print out the step-by-step reasoning based on this model.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\nclass Concept:\n    \"\"\"A base class for a conceptual component.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"Concept({self.name})\"\n\nclass Predicate(Concept):\n    \"\"\"Represents a predicate, like 'is red' or 'F'.\"\"\"\n    pass\n\nclass SingularTerm(Concept):\n    \"\"\"Represents a singular term or name, like 'the ball' or 'a'.\"\"\"\n    pass\n\nclass Quantifier(Concept):\n    \"\"\"Represents a quantifier, like 'for all x' or 'there exists an x'.\"\"\"\n    pass\n\nclass Thinker:\n    \"\"\"Models a mind that adheres to the Generality Constraint.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.concepts = set()\n\n    def learn_from_proposition(self, proposition_components):\n        \"\"\"\n        Models understanding a proposition by acquiring its constituent concepts.\n        This is the core of the Generality Constraint: understanding a thought\n        gives you reusable conceptual parts.\n        \"\"\"\n        for concept in proposition_components:\n            print(f\"-> Acquired concept '{concept.name}' from the proposition.\")\n            self.concepts.add(concept)\n\n    def learn_concept(self, concept):\n        \"\"\"Models directly learning a concept, like a quantifier.\"\"\"\n        print(f\"-> Acquired concept '{concept.name}' through direct understanding.\")\n        self.concepts.add(concept)\n\n\n    def can_form_thought(self, target_components):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if a new thought can be formed by recombining existing concepts.\n        \"\"\"\n        possessed_concept_names = {c.name for c in self.concepts}\n        required_concept_names = {c.name for c in target_components}\n\n        return required_concept_names.issubset(possessed_concept_names)\n\ndef run_philosophy_simulation():\n    # 1.
