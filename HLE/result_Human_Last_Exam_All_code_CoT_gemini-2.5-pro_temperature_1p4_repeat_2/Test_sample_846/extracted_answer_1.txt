To be functionally accurate, the azobenzene-shaped picnic table must change its shape in response to sunlight. When the sun rises, the table should bend and contract from an elongated shape into a more compact, bent shape, mimicking the *trans* to *cis* isomerization caused by UV light. When the sun sets, the table should slowly relax and straighten back out to its original elongated shape, mimicking the thermal relaxation from the *cis* back to the more stable *trans* form that occurs in the dark.
