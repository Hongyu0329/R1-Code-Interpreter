# The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a space X
# with specific properties. Based on topological analysis, we concluded that
# any such space X must be homeomorphic to the Stone-ÄŒech compactification of
# the long ray, which in turn is homeomorphic to the closed long ray [0, omega_1].
# Since all such spaces are homeomorphic to a single model space, there is only
# one homeomorphism class.

number_of_homeomorphism_classes = 1
