    Finds the largest natural number n such that the (2n)th K-group of Z/27 is nonzero.
    
    Based on the formula for the order of K-groups of Z/p^v:
    |K_{2i-2}(Z/p^v)| = p^(v + nu_p(i)) for i divisible by p-1.
    We assume this formula holds for i < phi(p^v).

    For Z/27, p=3, v=3.
    We are looking for K_{2n}(Z/27).
    Let 2n = 2i-2, so n = i-1.
    p-1 = 2, so i must be an even number.
    This implies n must be an odd number.
    
    The assumed bound is phi(27) = 3^(3-1) * (3-1) = 18.
    So, we need the largest odd n such that i = n+1 < 18.
