    "This is a problem in algebraic K-theory. To solve it, we need to find the structure of the K-groups of the ring `R = Z/27`.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Ring and K-groups:** We are looking at the Quillen K-groups `K_i(R)` for the ring `R = Z/27 = Z/3^3`. We are interested in even-indexed groups `K_{2n}(Z/27)`.\n\n2.  **Use Known Results:** The K-groups of `Z/m` have been studied extensively. For `m = p^v` where `p` is an odd prime, the structure of the `p`-primary part of these groups is known. For `i >= 2`, the group `K_i(Z/p^v)` is a `p`-group. In our case, `p=3` which is an odd prime, so for `n >= 1`, `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is a 3-group.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula:** According to results by Arlettaz and others, for an odd prime `p`, `v >= 1`, and an integer `i >= 2` which is a multiple of `p-1`, the following isomorphism holds:\n    `K_{2i-2}(Z/p^v) \\cong Z / p^{v + \\nu_p(i)} Z`\n    where `\\nu_p(i)` is the `p`-adic valuation of `i` (the exponent of `p` in the prime factorization of `i`).\n    For other indices, the `p`-primary part of the K-group is often zero. We will assume that `K_{2n}(Z/p^v)_p` is zero if the index `2n` is not of the form `2i-2` with `i` being a multiple of `p-1`.\n\n4.  **Apply to our case:**\n    *   `p = 3`, `v = 3`. The ring is `Z/27`.\n    *   `p-1 = 2`. So, the integer `i` must be an even number.\n    *   The index of the K-group is `2n`. We set `2n = 2i-2`, which simplifies to `n = i-1`.\n    *   Since `i` must be a positive even integer, `n = i-1` must be a positive odd integer.\n    *   So, `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is non-zero if and only if `n` is a positive odd integer. The order of the group would be `3^(3 + \\nu_3(n+1))`.\n\n5.  **Address the \"Largest n\" part:** The formula suggests that `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is non-zero for *every* odd natural number `n`. This contradicts the premise of the question that there is a \"largest\" such `n`. This implies there might be a hidden condition or the question is based on a theorem that holds only up to a certain range. A natural bound for phenomena related to the ring `Z/p^v` is the order of its group of units, `phi(p^v) = p^(v-1) * (p-1)`. Let's hypothesize that the formula is only known to hold for `i < phi(p^v)`.\n    *   For `Z/27`, this bound is `phi(27) = 3^(3-1) * (3-1) = 9 * 2 = 18`.\n    *   So, we are looking for the largest odd natural number `n` such that `i = n+1` is an even number and `n+1 < 18`.\n\n6.  **Find the Number:** We need to find the largest odd `n` such that `n < 17`. This number is `15`.\n\n7.  **Write Code:** We will write a Python script that implements this logic to find the largest `n`. The script will check odd numbers downwards from the calculated bound.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_p_adic_valuation(n, p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the p-adic valuation of n.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0 and n % p == 0:\n        count += 1\n        n //= p\n    return count\n\ndef solve_k_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest natural number n such that the (2n)th K-group of Z/27 is nonzero.\n    \n    Based on the formula for the order of K-groups of Z/p^v:\n    |K_{2i-2}(Z/p^v)| = p^(v + nu_p(i)) for i divisible by p-1.\n    We assume this formula holds for i < phi(p^v).\n\n    For Z/27, p=3, v=3.\n    We are looking for K_{2n}(Z/27).\n    Let 2n = 2i-2, so n = i-1.\n    p-1 = 2, so i must be an even number.\n    This implies n must be an odd number.\n    \n    The assumed bound is phi(27) = 3^(3-1) * (3-1) = 18.\n    So, we need the largest odd n such that i = n+1 < 18.\n    This means n < 17.\n    The largest odd natural number n < 17 is 15.\n    \"\"\"\n    p = 3\n    v = 3\n    \n    # Calculate the bound based on Euler's totient function\n    # phi(p^v) = p^(v-1) * (p-1)\n    bound = p**(v - 1) * (p - 1)\n    \n    largest_n = 0\n    # We search for the largest n < bound - 1\n    for n in range(bound - 2, 0, -1):\n        # The K-group K_{2n}(Z/27) is non-zero if n is odd.\n        # This corresponds to i = n+1 being even.\n        if n % 2 != 0:\n            largest_n = n\n            break\n            \n    # Let's verify our found n and print the equation for its K-group order.\n    if largest_n > 0:\n        i = largest_n + 1\n        nu_p_i = get_p_adic_valuation(i, p)\n        # The order of the K-group is p^(v + nu_p(i))\n        order_log_p = v + nu_p_i\n        order = p**order_log_p\n        \n        print(f\"The ring is Z/{p**v}.\")\n        print(f\"The largest natural number n is conjectured to be {largest_n}.\")\n        print(f\"This is based on the assumption that the formula for K-groups holds for i < phi({p**v}) = {bound}.\")\n        print(f\"For n = {largest_n}, we consider the K-group K_{2*largest_n}(Z/{p**v}) = K_{{2*largest_n}}(Z/{p**v}).\")\n        print(f\"The index corresponds to i = n + 1 = {i}.\")\n        print(f\"Since {i} is even (divisible by p-1 = {p-1}) and {i} < {bound}, the group is non-zero.\")\n        print(f\"The order of K_{{{2*largest_n}}}(Z/{p**v}) is {p}^({v} + nu_{p}({i})) = {p}^({v} + {nu_p_i}) = {p}^{{{order_log_p}}} = {order}.\")\n        print(f\"The final answer is: {largest_n}\")\n\nsolve_k_theory_problem()\n\n```\n<<<15>>>"
