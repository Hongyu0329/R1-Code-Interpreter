    "To answer your historical question using code, I will first find the name of the judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461 from historical records. Then, I will write a Python script that stores this information in variables (year, city, judge's name) and prints the answer in a complete sentence. This fulfills the request to use code and output the relevant number (the year 1461).\n\n```python\ndef find_judge_of_bartfa_1461():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov)\n    in the year 1461 based on historical records.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Information based on historical data for Bártfa (Bardejov)\n    year = 1461\n    city = \"Bártfa (now Bardejov)\"\n    judge_name = \"Jakub\"\n\n    # The final answer statement, which includes the number from the query.\n    print(f\"In the year {year}, the judge of {city} was {judge_name}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the answer.\nfind_judge_of_bartfa_1461()\n```\n<<<Jakub>>>"
