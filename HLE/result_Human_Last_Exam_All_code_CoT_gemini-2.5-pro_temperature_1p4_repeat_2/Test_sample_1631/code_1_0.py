# The scientific basis for adding bypass notches in sheet metal stamping dies
# is to manage the flow of material during the forming operation.

# Problem: When stamping parts with complex geometries, such as very small radii,
# sharp corners, or deep sections, the sheet metal can get "stuck" or "locked"
# in these areas. This prevents material from the flange/binder area from flowing
# smoothly into the die cavity where it is needed.

# Consequence: This restricted material flow forces other areas of the part to
# stretch excessively, leading to defects like severe thinning (necking) or cracks.

# Solution: A "bypass notch" is strategically cut into the edge of the blank.
# This notch acts as a channel, creating an easier path for the material to
# "bypass" the restrictive geometry and flow into the die cavity. By enabling
# better material inflow, the notch ensures the part can be formed completely
# without localized thinning or failure.

# Therefore, the most accurate answer is the one that describes this fundamental
# issue of material flow.

# D. To counteract issues of material inflow into forming cavities around complex
# geometries of the workpiece (e.g. small radii, zero draft angles, etc.)
