    "The user is asking a historical trivia question but has requested the answer be delivered via a script. My plan is to first determine the answer to the trivia question. Then, I will write a simple Python script that prints this answer, as the user's instructions require a code-based solution. The code will simply display the text of the answer.\n\nThe unique feature in the Piazza della Rotonda that was removed in the post-war period (around 1950) was the tramway line that passed through the square. The dismantling of tram lines in Rome's historic center was a significant urban change during that era to make way for increasing car traffic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the answer to the historical trivia question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The feature that was removed.\n    feature = \"A tramway\"\n    \n    # The year mentioned in the question.\n    year = 1950\n\n    # The prompt asks to \"output each number in the final equation\",\n    # but there is no equation. We will just print the relevant year from the prompt.\n    print(f\"The unique architectural feature removed from the Piazza della Rotonda around the year {year} was:\")\n    print(feature)\n\nsolve_trivia()\n```\n<<<A tramway>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
