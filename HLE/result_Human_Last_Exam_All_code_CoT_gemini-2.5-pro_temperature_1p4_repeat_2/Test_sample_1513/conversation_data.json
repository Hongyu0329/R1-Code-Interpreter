    "My plan to solve this riddle is as follows:\n1.  First, I will break down the riddle into its key components:\n    *   An island town.\n    *   Located more than 500 kilometers from any other inhabited island, making it extremely remote.\n    *   Situated on a bay that was formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    *   The town and the bay it sits on share the same name.\n2.  I will then evaluate well-known remote islands against these criteria.\n3.  The remoteness clue points towards candidates like Easter Island, Tristan da Cunha, or the Pitcairn Islands.\n4.  By checking each candidate against the naming and geographical clues, I will identify the correct location.\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script that outlines this deductive process in its comments and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\n# This script is designed to solve the riddle by logically evaluating the provided clues.\n\ndef find_island_town():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle by filtering candidates based on a set of criteria.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clue 1: An island town.\n    # Clue 2: More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island.\n    # Clue 3: Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    # Clue 4: The town and the bay share the same name.\n\n    # Candidate evaluation:\n    # - Tristan da Cunha: The main settlement is Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. It is extremely remote,\n    #   but the town's name does not match a specific bay it sits on. -> Incorrect.\n    # - Pitcairn Islands: The main settlement is Adamstown. It is near Bounty Bay.\n    #   The names do not match. -> Incorrect.\n    # - Easter Island (Rapa Nui): The main town is Hanga Roa.\n    #   - Is it remote (> 500 km)? Yes, it is one of the most isolated inhabited islands on Earth.\n    #   - Do the town and bay share a name? Yes, the town of Hanga Roa is on the bay of Hanga Roa.\n    #   - Is the bay formed by a volcanic caldera? The island is entirely of volcanic origin,\n    #     and its geography, including its bays, was shaped by its three main volcanoes and their calderas. -> Correct.\n\n    # The only candidate that satisfies all conditions is Hanga Roa.\n    # The riddle asks for the island town's name.\n    answer = \"Hanga Roa\"\n\n    # The riddle mentions the distance of 500 kilometers. Let's include that in the output.\n    distance_in_km = 500\n    print(f\"The riddle specifies a distance of more than {distance_in_km} kilometers from another inhabited island.\")\n    print(f\"The island town that sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera and shares the bay's name is: {answer}\")\n\nfind_island_town()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
