    "To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify the Group G**: The group $G$ is generated by three permutations, $a, b, c$, on a set of 12 elements. I will use a computational approach to determine the structure of $G$. Specifically, I will use Python's `sympy` library to represent these permutations and compute the order of the group they generate. The order, along with properties of the generators (like being even permutations and containing an 11-cycle), will allow me to identify $G$ as a well-known finite group.\n2.  **Determine the Schur Multiplier A**: After identifying $G$, I will find its Schur multiplier, A. The Schur multipliers for many finite simple groups are standard results in group theory.\n3.  **Analyze the Subgroups of A**: The Schur multiplier, A, is an abelian group. I will determine its structure.\n4.  **Count Proper Subgroups Up to Isomorphism**: The final step is to count the number of proper subgroups of A, considering two subgroups the same if they are isomorphic. A proper subgroup is any subgroup other than the group itself.\n\nI will now implement this plan in a Python script. The script will perform the group identification and then lay out the reasoning to arrive at the final count.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.perm_groups import PermutationGroup\n\ndef solve_group_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by identifying the group G, its Schur multiplier A,\n    and counting the proper subgroups of A up to isomorphism.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the group G from its generators.\n    # The set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z}.\n    # We map these to {0, 1, ..., 11} for sympy's 0-based indexing.\n    # Mapping: 1->0, 2->1, 3->2, 4->3, 5->4, 6->5, 7->6, 8->7, 9->8, x->9, y->10, z->11\n    \n    # a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x) corresponds to the permutation:\n    a_perm = Permutation(0, 2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 8, 7, 10, 9)\n    \n    # b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, x, 7, 6) corresponds to the permutation:\n    b_perm = Permutation(0, 7, 4, 8)(3, 9, 6, 5)\n    \n    # c = (1, 2)(3, z)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, y)(9, x) corresponds to the permutation:\n    c_perm = Permutation(0, 1)(2, 11)(3, 7)(4, 5)(6, 10)(8, 9)\n    \n    # Create the permutation group G\n    G = PermutationGroup([a_perm, b_perm, c_perm])\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the group G.\n    # We can do this by computing its order.\n    # All generators are even permutations, so G is a subgroup of A_12.\n    # A transitive group on 12 points containing an 11-cycle must be M_12 or A_12.\n    # Order of M_12 is 95040.
