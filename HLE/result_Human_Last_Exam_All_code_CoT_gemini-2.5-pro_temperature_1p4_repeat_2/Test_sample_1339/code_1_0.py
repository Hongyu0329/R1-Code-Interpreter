    Solves the given group theory problem regarding the p-completion of a solvable group.

    The reasoning is as follows:

    Part (a): Existence and Uniqueness of the minimal group G_hat.
    The group G, having a subnormal series with abelian factors, is solvable.
    For a solvable group G, a unique minimal group G_hat exists in which any
    p-nonsingular system of equations over G has a solution. This group G_hat
    is known as the p-completion of G. Its existence and uniqueness (up to
    isomorphism) are established results in group theory.

    Part (b): Maximum possible derived length of G_hat.
    Let dl(H) denote the derived length of a group H.

    Step 1: Relate dl(G_hat) to dl(G).
    The p-completion functor is exact on short exact sequences of nilpotent groups,
    and this property extends to solvable groups in a way that preserves the derived
    length. The derived series of G_hat is the completion of the derived series of G.
    Therefore, dl(G_hat) = dl(G). The problem reduces to finding the maximum possible
    derived length of G.

    Step 2: Find an upper bound for dl(G).
    We are given a subnormal series: G = G_1 > G_2 > ... > G_{n+1} = {1}, where G_{i+1}
    is a normal subgroup of G_i, and the factor groups B_i = G_i / G_{i+1} are abelian.
    - Since G_1/G_2 is abelian, the derived subgroup G' = G_1' must be a subgroup of G_2.
    - The second derived subgroup G^(2) = [G', G'] is a subgroup of [G_2, G_2].
    - Since G_2/G_3 is abelian, [G_2, G_2] is a subgroup of G_3. Thus, G^(2) is a subgroup of G_3.
    - By induction, we can show that G^(k) is a subgroup of G_{k+1} for all k in {1, ..., n}.
    - For k=n, this gives G^(n) <= G_{n+1} = {1}.
    - This implies that the derived length of G is at most n, i.e., dl(G) <= n.

    Step 3: Show that the bound n is achievable.
    We need an example of a group G satisfying the premises with dl(G) = n.
    Consider the iterated wreath product G = A wr A wr ... wr A (n times), where A is a
    non-trivial p'-torsion-free abelian group (for example, the integers Z).
    - The derived length of this group is known to be n.
    - Let's take the derived series of G: G > G' > G'' > ... > G^(n) = {1}.
    - This is a normal series of length n. We can set G_i = G^(i-1).
    - The factors B_i = G_i / G_{i+1} = G^(i-1) / G^(i) are abelian by definition.
    - For a wreath product of torsion-free abelian groups like Z, the factors of the
      derived series are also torsion-free. A torsion-free group is p'-torsion-free
      for any prime p.
    - Thus, this group G fulfills all conditions and has dl(G) = n.

    Conclusion:
    The maximum possible derived length for G (and thus for G_hat) is n.
