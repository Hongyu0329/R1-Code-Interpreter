    "The user wants to solve the initial value problem given by the differential equation $x'(t)=(t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$ with the initial condition $x(0)=-8$, and find the value of $x(1)$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the type of differential equation:** The given equation is a first-order separable ordinary differential equation.\n2.  **Separate the variables:** I will rearrange the equation to have all terms involving $x$ on one side and all terms involving $t$ on the other side. This gives $\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt$.\n3.  **Integrate both sides:** I will integrate both sides of the separated equation. The integral of $\\frac{1}{x^2}$ with respect to $x$ is $-\\frac{1}{x}$. The integral of $(t-1)$ with respect to $t$ is $\\frac{t^2}{2} - t$. This yields the general solution: $-\\frac{1}{x(t)} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C$, where $C$ is the constant of integration.\n4.  **Use the initial condition to find C:** I will use the condition $x(0)=-8$ to find the value of the constant $C$. By substituting $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution, I can solve for $C$.\n5.  **Write the particular solution:** After finding $C$, I will write the specific equation for $x(t)$.\n6.  **Calculate x(1):** Finally, I will substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution to find the value of $x(1)$.\n7.  **Python Script:** I will create a Python script to perform these calculations and print out the steps and the final answer, including the numbers used in the final computation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_ivp():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the initial value problem x'(t) = (t-1)x^2(t) with x(0) = -8, and finds x(1).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define initial conditions and target time\n    t0 = 0\n    x0 = -8\n    t_target = 1\n\n    print(\"The initial value problem is x'(t) = (t-1) * x^2(t), with x(0) = -8.\")\n    print(\"This is a separable differential equation.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Separate variables and integrate.\")\n    print(\"∫(1/x^2) dx = ∫(t-1) dt\")\n    print(\"This gives the general solution: -1/x = t^2/2 - t + C\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Use the initial condition x(0) = -8 to find the constant C.\")\n    # Calculate C\n    # -1/x0 = t0^2/2 - t0 + C\n    # C = -1/x0 - (t0^2/2 - t0)\n    C = -1/x0 - (t0**2 / 2 - t0)\n    print(f\"Substitute t = {t0} and x = {x0}:\")\n    print(f\"-1/({x0}) = {t0}^2/2 - {t0} + C\")\n    print(f\"1/8 = 0 + C\")\n    print(f\"So, C = {sympy.Rational(C)}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Write the particular solution.\")\n    print(f\"-1/x(t) = t^2/2 - t + {sympy.Rational(C)}\")\n    print(\"Solving for x(t):\")\n    print(\"x(t) = 1 / (-(t^2/2 - t + 1/8))\")\n    print(\"x(t) = 1 / (-t^2/2 + t - 1/8)\")\n    print(\"Multiplying numerator and denominator by 8 for a cleaner look:\")\n    print(\"x(t) = 8 / (-4*t^2 + 8*t - 1)\\n\")\n\n\n    print(f\"Step 4: Find x({t_target}).\")\n    # Calculate x(t_target)\n    # Denominator = -t_target**2/2 + t_target - C\n    denominator = -(t_target**2 / 2 - t_target + C)\n    x_target = 1 / denominator\n\n    # Using the cleaned-up formula for printing\n    num_clean = 8\n    den_clean_term1 = -4 * t_target**2\n    den_clean_term2 = 8 * t_target\n    den_clean_term3 = -1\n    den_clean = den_clean_term1 + den_clean_term2 + den_clean_term3\n\n    print(f\"Substitute t = {t_target} into the particular solution:\")\n    print(f\"x({t_target}) = 8 / (-4*({t_target})^2 + 8*({t_target}) - 1)\")\n    print(\"Let's calculate the denominator:\")\n    print(f\"Denominator = {den_clean_term1} + {den_clean_term2} + {den_clean_term3}\")\n    print(f\"Denominator = {den_clean}\")\n    print(\"\\nSo the final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"x({t_target}) = {num_clean} / {den_clean}\")\n\n    # Use sympy.Rational for exact fraction representation\n    result_fraction = sympy.Rational(num_clean, den_clean)\n    result_float = float(x_target)\n    print(f\"\\nThe value of x(1) is {result_fraction} or approximately {result_float:.4f}.\")\n\nsolve_ivp()\n```\n<<<8/3>>>"
