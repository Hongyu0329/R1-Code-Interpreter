No. Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) requires a material to have a strong second-order nonlinear optical response, which is forbidden in materials with inversion symmetry. The common, stable allotropes of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) are centrosymmetric. Therefore, under ideal conditions, they are not expected to exhibit SPDC.
