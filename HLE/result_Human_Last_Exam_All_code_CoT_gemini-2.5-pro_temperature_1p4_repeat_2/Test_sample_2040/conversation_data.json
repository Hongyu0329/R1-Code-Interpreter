    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to address your request:\n\nFirst, I will address the core scientific question about Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) in boron nanosheets.\n1.  I will start by explaining the fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit SPDC, which is the possession of a significant second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n2.  I will explain that this property is directly related to the material's crystal symmetry. Specifically, a material must lack a center of inversion (i.e., be non-centrosymmetric) to have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾.\n3.  Then, I will discuss the crystal structure of common, free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene). These structures are typically centrosymmetric.\n4.  Based on this symmetry, I will conclude that ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit SPDC.\n\nSecond, to fulfill your request for a code block, I will provide a Python script. Since boron nanosheets are not suitable for SPDC, this script will not simulate them. Instead, it will serve as a general tool to demonstrate the principle of energy conservation in any hypothetical SPDC process. The script will take a pump wavelength and a signal wavelength as input and calculate the corresponding idler wavelength, printing the full equation with the numbers as you requested.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_spdc_idler_wavelength(pump_wavelength_nm, signal_wavelength_nm):\n    \"\"\"\n    In SPDC, energy is conserved: E_pump = E_signal + E_idler.\n    Since energy E is inversely proportional to wavelength λ (E = hc/λ),\n    the conservation law can be written as:\n    1/λ_pump = 1/λ_signal + 1/λ_idler\n\n    This function calculates the idler wavelength based on this principle.\n\n    Args:\n        pump_wavelength_nm (float): The wavelength of the pump photon in nm.\n        signal_wavelength_nm (float): The wavelength of the signal photon in nm.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The wavelength of the idler photon in nm, or None if inputs are invalid.\n    \"\"\"\n    if pump_wavelength_nm <= 0 or signal_wavelength_nm <= 0:\n        print(\"Error: Wavelengths must be positive values.\")\n        return None\n    \n    # The signal photon must have lower energy (longer wavelength) than the pump photon.\n    if signal_wavelength_nm <= pump_wavelength_nm:\n        print(f\"Error: Signal wavelength ({signal_wavelength_nm} nm) must be longer than pump wavelength ({pump_wavelength_nm} nm).\")\n        return None\n\n    # Calculate 1/λ_idler from 1/λ_idler = 1/λ_pump - 1/λ_signal\n    try:\n        inv_idler_wavelength = (1 / pump_wavelength_nm) - (1 / signal_wavelength_nm)\n        if inv_idler_wavelength <= 1e-9: # Effectively zero or negative\n             return None\n        idler_wavelength_nm = 1 / inv_idler_wavelength\n        return idler_wavelength_nm\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# --- Example Calculation ---\n# This is a hypothetical calculation to demonstrate the physical principle.\n# We assume a common green laser for the pump and a standard near-infrared\n# wavelength for the signal photon.\n\n# Input values\npump_lambda = 532.0  # Wavelength of a common green laser pointer (nm)\nsignal_lambda = 810.0 # Wavelength of a common Ti:Sapphire laser (nm)\n\n# Perform the calculation\nidler_lambda = calculate_spdc_idler_wavelength(pump_lambda, signal_lambda)\n\n# Print the results in the requested format\nif idler_lambda is not None:\n    print(\"This script demonstrates the energy conservation principle in a hypothetical SPDC process.\")\n    print(f\"Given a pump wavelength of {pump_lambda:.1f} nm and a signal wavelength of {signal_lambda:.1f} nm, the idler wavelength is calculated.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Result ---\")\n    print(f\"The final equation showing the down-conversion is:\")\n    print(f\"{pump_lambda:.1f} nm (pump) -> {signal_lambda:.1f} nm (signal) + {idler_lambda:.1f} nm (idler)\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Could not calculate a valid idler wavelength with the provided inputs.\")\n\n```\n<<<No. Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) requires a material to have a strong second-order nonlinear optical response, which is forbidden in materials with inversion symmetry. The common, stable allotropes of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) are centrosymmetric. Therefore, under ideal conditions, they are not expected to exhibit SPDC.>>>"
