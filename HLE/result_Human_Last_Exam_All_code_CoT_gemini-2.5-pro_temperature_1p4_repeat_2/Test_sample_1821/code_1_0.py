def solve_cardinality_problem():
    """
    This function solves the set theory problem based on the following reasoning:

    1.  The problem asks for the number of cardinalities in the interval [|T_1|, |T_2|],
        where |T_1| and |T_2| are the minimal and maximal possible number of branches
        in a pruned tree of height omega_2 with countably infinite levels.

    2.  The maximal number of branches, |T_2|, is 2^(aleph_2). This is the cardinality
        of the set of all possible paths in the tree.

    3.  The minimal number of branches, |T_1|, is aleph_0. The "pruned" property
        and the fact that branches cannot re-merge guarantee at least one branch for
        each of the aleph_0 nodes at level 0. A tree with exactly aleph_0 parallel
        branches can be constructed, showing this minimum is achievable.

    4.  So the interval is [aleph_0, 2^(aleph_2)]. The number of cardinals in this
        interval depends on the value of 2^(aleph_2), which is independent of ZFC.
        To obtain a specific numerical answer, we assume the Generalized Continuum
        Hypothesis (GCH), a standard convention in such problems.

    5.  Under GCH, 2^(aleph_2) = aleph_3.

    6.  The interval is therefore [aleph_0, aleph_3]. The cardinals in this interval are
        aleph_0, aleph_1, aleph_2, and aleph_3.

    7.  Counting these cardinals gives the final answer.
