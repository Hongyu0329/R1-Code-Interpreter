    explanation = """
Magnesium plays a key role in regulating blood pressure primarily through its action as a natural calcium channel blocker. Here is the mechanism:

1.  Muscle Contraction and Calcium: Smooth muscle cells in the walls of blood vessels require calcium ions (Ca2+) to contract. When calcium enters these cells, the blood vessels constrict (vasoconstriction), which increases blood pressure.

2.  Magnesium as a Calcium Antagonist: Magnesium (Mg2+) competes with calcium. It blocks the channels that allow calcium to enter the smooth muscle cells.

3.  Resulting Vasodilation: With less calcium entering the cells, the vascular smooth muscle relaxes. This relaxation and widening of the blood vessels is known as vasodilation.

4.  Effect on Blood Pressure: Vasodilation reduces the resistance to blood flow throughout the body (systemic vascular resistance), which directly results in a lower blood pressure.

Based on this, option A is the correct answer.
