    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve for the total welfare:\n\n1.  **Find Market Equilibrium:** The first step is to find the point where the market is in equilibrium. This occurs when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (Q_S = Q_D = Q_e) and the price is the same for both functions (P_S = P_D = P_e). To find this, we set the two equations equal to each other: `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`. This equation is complex and will be solved numerically to find the equilibrium quantity `Q_e`.\n2.  **Calculate Equilibrium Price:** Once we have the equilibrium quantity `Q_e`, we can plug it back into either the supply or demand function to find the equilibrium price `P_e`.\n3.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** Total welfare is the sum of consumer and producer surplus. It represents the total net benefit to society and can be calculated by finding the area between the demand curve and the supply curve from Q=0 up to the equilibrium quantity `Q_e`. The formula is:\n    `Total Welfare = ∫ D(Q)dQ - ∫ S(Q)dQ`\n    where the first integral is from `0` to `Q_e` and the second is from the minimum quantity where supply is defined (`Q > 2^(1/3)`) to `Q_e`. These integrals will also be calculated numerically.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan and calculates the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_and_print_welfare():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the total welfare based on given\n    supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
