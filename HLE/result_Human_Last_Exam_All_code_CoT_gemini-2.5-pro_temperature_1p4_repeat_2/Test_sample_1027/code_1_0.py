def solve_homology_dimension():
    """
    Computes the dimension of the homology of G with trivial real coefficients in degree 31.
    
    The group G is given by generators g and h. We can analyze the structure of G.
    There is a homomorphism phi from G to Z^2 based on the asymptotic behavior of
    the homeomorphisms at -infinity and +infinity.
    
    phi(f) = (lim_{x -> -inf} (f(x)-x), lim_{x -> +inf} (f(x)-x))
    
    phi(g) = (1, 0)
    phi(h) = (0, 2)
    
    The image of phi is a lattice isomorphic to Z^2. The kernel K consists of
    homeomorphisms with compact support. This gives a short exact sequence:
    1 -> K -> G -> Z^2 -> 1
    
    Elements of K are piecewise linear homeomorphisms with dyadic rational
    breakpoints and slopes that are powers of 2. This means K is a subgroup
    of Thompson's group F.
    
    We use the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence for this extension, which
    converges to the homology of G. The E^2 page has terms:
    E^2_{p,q} = H_p(Z^2, H_q(K, R))
    
    The homology of Z^2 is only non-zero for degrees p = 0, 1, 2.
    A deep result states that for any subgroup H of Thompson's group F,
    the real homology H_q(H, R) vanishes for q >= 3. A stronger (conjectured,
    but widely expected to be true) result states H_q(F, R) = 0 for q >= 2.
    We can safely assume H_q(K, R) = 0 for q >= 3.
    
    We want to compute dim H_31(G, R). The contributors to this group are the
    E^infinity_{p,q} terms where p+q=31. The only possibly non-zero terms
    on the E^2 page are for p in {0, 1, 2}.
    This implies we need to check q = 31, 30, 29.
