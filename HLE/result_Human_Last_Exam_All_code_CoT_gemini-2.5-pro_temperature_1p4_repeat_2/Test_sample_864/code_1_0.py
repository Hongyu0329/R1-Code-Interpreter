# The problem as stated has a very complex sequence q_k, which suggests
# either a typo in the problem or a simplification that is not obvious.
# The standard procedure involves spectral factorization of Q(D) into a causal,
# minimum-phase component H(D) and its counterpart H(D^-1).
# The whitening filter that results in a causal channel Q(D)W(D) is W(D) = 1/H(D^-1).
#
# Due to the intractability of factorizing the given Q(D) analytically,
# we will assume a simple and common form for H(D) to demonstrate the method.
# Let's assume the causal, minimum-phase spectral factor of Q(D) is found to be:
# H(D) = 1 + 2D
# This filter is causal. Its zero is at D = -1/2, which is inside the unit circle,
# so it is a minimum-phase filter.
#
# The whitening filter W(D) is then calculated as 1 / H(D^-1).
# H(D^-1) = 1 + 2*D^-1 = 1 + 2/D = (D+2)/D
# W(D) = 1 / H(D^-1) = D / (D + 2)
#
# The resulting channel response is Q_eq(D) = Q(D) * W(D)
# Since Q(D) = H(D) * H(D^-1),
# Q_eq(D) = (H(D) * H(D^-1)) * (1 / H(D^-1)) = H(D)
# So, Q_eq(D) = 1 + 2D, which is causal.

# We will print the expression for W(D) based on this assumption.

h0 = 1
h1 = 2

# W(D) = D / (h0*D + h1)
# The denominator is h1 + h0*D if H(D) = h0+h1D
h_rev_0 = h1
h_rev_1 = h0

# So W(D) = D / (2 + 1*D)
