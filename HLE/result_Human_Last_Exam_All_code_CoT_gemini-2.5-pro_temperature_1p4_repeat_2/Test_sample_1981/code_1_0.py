# Step 1: Solving for X_0
# The problem simplifies to solving the equation for X_0.
# From the analysis of the solvability conditions and the integral equation, we find:
# X_0^(15/2) = 10^117
# We can solve for X_0 from this equation.

# Power is 15/2 = 7.5
# So, X_0 = (10^117)^(1/7.5) = (10^117)^(2/15)
exponent = 117 * 2 / 15
X0 = 10**exponent

# Step 2: Calculate the final expression
# The expression to calculate is 10^30 * X_0^2 - 10^30 * X_0 + 10

# Calculate each term of the final expression
# As per the instruction "output each number in the final equation",
# we calculate X0, X0^2, and then the full expression.

term1_val = 10**30 * (X0**2)
term2_val = 10**30 * X0
term3_val = 10

# The equation is term1_val - term2_val + term3_val
final_result = term1_val - term2_val + term3_val
