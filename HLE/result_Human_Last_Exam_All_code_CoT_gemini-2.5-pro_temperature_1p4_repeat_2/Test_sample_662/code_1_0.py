# Step 1: Define the given parameters from the problem.
Ro = 3.0  # Basic Reproduction Number
breakthrough_rate = 0.06  # 6% of vaccinated people got the infection

# Step 2: Calculate the vaccine's efficacy (e).
# Efficacy is the vaccine's effectiveness at preventing infection.
# If 6% of vaccinated people still get infected, the vaccine is 100% - 6% = 94% effective.
vaccine_efficacy = 1 - breakthrough_rate

# Step 3: Calculate the critical vaccination coverage (p_c) needed for herd immunity.
# The formula is p_c = (1 - 1/Ro) / e
# This tells us the proportion of the population we need to vaccinate with a non-perfect vaccine.
critical_coverage = (1 - (1 / Ro)) / vaccine_efficacy

# Step 4: Display the logic, the final equation, and the result.
