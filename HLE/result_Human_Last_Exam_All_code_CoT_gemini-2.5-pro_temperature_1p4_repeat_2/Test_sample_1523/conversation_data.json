    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` followed by a Python script to represent the final expression symbolically.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\n1.  **Identify the Context:** We are working within finite-temperature quantum field theory for a neutral scalar field `ϕ`. The central object is the partition function `Z`, represented as a functional integral over the field configurations: `Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S[ϕ])`, where `S[ϕ]` is the Euclidean action.\n\n2.  **Define the Action:** At a finite temperature `T`, the theory is formulated in Euclidean spacetime, where imaginary time `τ` is compactified on a circle of length `β = 1/T` (with `k_B = 1`, `ħ = 1`). The Euclidean action for a neutral scalar field is:\n    `S[ϕ] = ∫ d³x ∫₀^β dτ [ ½ ((∂_τ ϕ)² + (∇ϕ)²) + ½ m² ϕ² + V(ϕ) ]`\n    Here, `m` is the mass of the field and `V(ϕ)` represents interaction terms. The operator `D` is defined by the quadratic part of the action (the free theory, where `V(ϕ) = 0`).\n\n3.  **Define the Operator D:** The free action `S_free[ϕ]` can be written in the form `S_free[ϕ] = ½ (ϕ, Dϕ)`, where `D` is a differential operator. To find `D`, we use integration by parts on the derivative terms of the action, assuming the fields satisfy periodic boundary conditions in `τ` and vanish at spatial infinity.\n    `∫ (∂_μ ϕ)² d⁴x = - ∫ ϕ (∂_μ²) ϕ d⁴x`\n    In Euclidean space, `∂_μ² = ∂_τ² + ∇²`. So, the free action becomes:\n    `S_free[ϕ] = ½ ∫ d⁴x ϕ(x) [ -∂_τ² - ∇² + m² ] ϕ(x)`\n    By comparing this to `S_free[ϕ] = ½ (ϕ, Dϕ)`, we can identify the operator `D` as the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\n    `D = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²`\n\n4.  **Define the Inner Product:** The inner product `(f, g)` for real fields in this context is defined as the integral of their product over the entire Euclidean spacetime volume:\n    `(f, g) = ∫ d³x ∫₀^β dτ f(x,τ)g(x,τ)`\n\n5.  **Construct (ϕ, D_ϕ):** Using the definitions from the previous steps, we can write down the expression for the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)`. Note that `D_ϕ` simply means the operator `D` acting on the field `ϕ`.\n    `(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫ d³x ∫₀^β dτ ϕ(x,τ) [D] ϕ(x,τ)`\n    Substituting the expression for `D`:\n    `(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫ d³x ∫₀^β dτ ϕ(x,τ) [ -∂_τ² - ∇² + m² ] ϕ(x,τ)`\n    Note that this expression is exactly twice the free action, `2 * S_free[ϕ]`.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to symbolically construct and print this mathematical expression.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function uses the sympy library to symbolically represent the inner product\n    (ϕ, Dϕ) in finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Set up pretty printing for a clear mathematical output\n    sympy.init_printing(use_unicode=True)\n\n    # --- 1.
