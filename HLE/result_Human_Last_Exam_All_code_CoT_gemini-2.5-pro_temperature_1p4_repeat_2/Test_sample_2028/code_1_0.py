    # Despite the commutativity constraint, the problem remains expressive enough to encode #W[2]-hard
    # counting problems like #k-Set-Cover or #k-Dominating-Set.

    # (b) Is VEST #W[1]-hard if T_i are diagonal Z_2-matrices with at most one non-zero entry?
    # This restriction simplifies the matrices to be either 0 or E_jj.
    # The VEST calculation reduces to computing binomial coefficients modulo 2, which is FPT.
    # Therefore, it is not #W[1]-hard (unless FPT=W[1]).

    # (c) Complexity of decision VEST if T_i have one non-zero entry per row?
    # These matrices are equivalent to functions f:[n]->[n] with weights.
    # The problem is in XP. A reduction from the W[1]-hard k-Clique problem
    # shows that it is also W[1]-hard.
