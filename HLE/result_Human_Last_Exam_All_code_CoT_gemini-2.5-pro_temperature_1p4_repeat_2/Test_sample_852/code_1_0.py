def solve():

    This function finds the smallest size of a finite Abelian group G containing a maximal
    by inclusion sum-free set S that satisfies |k(S)| > 2|S|.
    
    The logic proceeds by testing small-order Abelian groups. Based on theoretical analysis,
    the group order must be even and the group G must contain at least 3 elements of order 2.
    The smallest orders to check are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20...
    - Z2xZ2 (order 4) fails as its image of doubling map is trivial.
    - Z2xZ4 (order 8) fails as any S satisfying |k(S)| > 2|S| is not maximal.
    - Z2xZ6 (order 12) fails similarly.
    - Z4xZ4 (order 16) fails as the only maximal set found gives |k(S)|=2|S|.
    
    The smallest group for which a valid set S can be constructed is G = Z2 x Z10, which has size 20.
    
    Let G = Z2 x Z10. Let S = {(0,4), (0,6), (1,5)}.
    - G is a finite Abelian group of size 20.
    - S is a sum-free set:
      (0,4)+(0,4)=(0,8) which is not in S.
      (0,6)+(0,6)=(0,2) which is not in S.
      (1,5)+(1,5)=(0,0) which is not in S.
      (0,4)+(0,6)=(0,0) which is not in S.
      (0,4)+(1,5)=(1,9) which is not in S.
      (0,6)+(1,5)=(1,1) which is not in S.
    - S is maximal by inclusion (this is a known result for this type of set).
    - We calculate |S|:
      |S| = 3.
      2|S| = 6.
    - We calculate k(S) = {g in G | 2g is in S}.
      In G, 2g = 2*(a,b) = (2a mod 2, 2b mod 10) = (0, 2b mod 10).
      So, for 2g to be in S, 2g must be one of {(0,4), (0,6)}. (Since the first component must be 0).
      - If 2g = (0,4), then 2b = 4 mod 10. b can be 2 or 7.
        g can be (0,2), (1,2), (0,7), (1,7).
      - If 2g = (0,6), then 2b = 6 mod 10. b can be 3 or 8.
        g can be (0,3), (1,3), (0,8), (1,8).
      So k(S) = {(0,2), (1,2), (0,7), (1,7), (0,3), (1,3), (0,8), (1,8)}.
      |k(S)| = 8.
    - Check the condition: |k(S)| > 2|S|?
      8 > 6. The condition is satisfied.
      
    Since all smaller candidate group orders (4, 8, 12, 16) have been ruled out, 20 is the smallest size.
