    "My plan is to analyze the poker scenario by breaking it down into its key components: position, stack size, and the game situation (the money bubble). I will then use standard poker principles to determine the correct strategy.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario**: The user is in an early position (UTG+1) with a short stack (16 big blinds). This stack size is typically considered in the \"push/fold\" zone, meaning the primary decision is whether to go all-in or fold.\n2.  **Incorporate the Bubble Factor**: The most critical piece of information is being \"near the money bubble.\" This dramatically changes player behavior. Opponents with medium-to-large stacks will play very cautiously to avoid busting out before the paid positions. This means they will only call an all-in with a very strong range of hands. This high \"fold equity\" allows the short stack to shove with a wider range of hands than normal.\n3.  **Evaluate Hand Options**: I will assess each hand choice based on how it performs against a likely (and very tight) calling range from an opponent on the bubble. A reasonable calling range in this spot would be something like pocket tens or better (TT+) and Ace-King (AK).\n4.  **Calculate and Compare Equities**: I will use standard, pre-calculated poker equities to show how each of the user's potential hands (QJs, 99, AJo, AKo) would fare if called by that tight range. This numerical comparison forms the basis of the decision.\n5.  **Formulate a Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, I'll determine which hand is a profitable jam. While several options are correct, the hand `99` stands out as it's not a premium monster like `AKo`, but it has very robust equity against the tight calling range you'd face on the bubble, making it a fundamentally sound and highly profitable shove.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef analyze_poker_hand():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the poker scenario and determines the correct hand to jam.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- 1.
