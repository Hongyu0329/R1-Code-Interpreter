# The reasoning above leads to a specific number.
# The two possible graphs are determined by whether their "base graph" H on 1000 vertices
# is a cycle or a path.
# Case 1: H is a cycle (C_1000). This leads to one graph (the prism graph Y_1000).
# Case 2: H is a path (P_1000). This leads to one graph (a form of MÃ¶bius ladder graph).
# These two graphs are non-isomorphic.
# Total number of non-isomorphic graphs is 1 + 1 = 2.
