    "The statement is **True**.\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   **SNP heritability (h²_SNP)** represents the proportion of phenotypic variation in a population that is due to all of the measured single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). It is a theoretical upper bound on how much of the trait's variance can be predicted using a linear model of those SNPs. It assumes you know the *true* effect size of every single SNP.\n*   **A Polygenic Score (PGS)** is a practical tool used to predict a phenotype. It is constructed using *estimated* effect sizes from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). These estimates are never perfect due to factors like finite GWAS sample sizes, the specific SNPs chosen, and the statistical methods used.\n*   Because the PGS is built with imperfect, noisy estimates rather than the true, unknown effect sizes, its ability to explain variance in the phenotype (its predictive R²) will necessarily be lower than the theoretical maximum represented by the SNP heritability. The R² of a PGS can approach the SNP heritability as GWAS sample sizes become infinitely large, but it cannot exceed it.\n\nTo demonstrate this, the following Python script simulates a scenario where we know the \"true\" genetic architecture and can therefore compare the SNP heritability directly with the R² of a simulated PGS.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef demonstrate_pgs_heritability():\n    \"\"\"\n    A simulation to demonstrate that the predictive R^2 of a Polygenic Score (PGS)\n    is lower than the SNP heritability.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- 1.
