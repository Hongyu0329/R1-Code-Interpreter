    "Of course. Here is a plan to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, followed by a Python script to execute the plan.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The task is to find the total number of 2D wallpaper groups whose associated point group has an order of 2.\n2.  **Define Point Groups of Order 2:** In two-dimensional crystallography, a point group of order 2 corresponds to a symmetry with two operations: the identity and one other. This can be either a 2-fold rotation (group '2') or a reflection across a mirror line (group 'm').\n3.  **Structure the Data:** I will create a Python dictionary to store the fundamental data of the 17 wallpaper groups. For each group, I'll store its designated point group and the order (number of symmetry operations) of that point group.\n4.  **Filter and Count:** The script will iterate through this data. It will first identify the distinct point groups that have an order of 2 (i.e., '2' and 'm').\n5.  **Group and Sum:** For each of these point groups, the script will count how many wallpaper groups belong to it.\n6.  **Display the Result:** The final output will present a clear breakdown of the count, showing how many wallpaper groups correspond to each relevant point group type. It will then display the sum as a simple equation to arrive at the total number.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the number of 2D wallpaper groups\n    that have a point group of a specific order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data of the 17 wallpaper groups with their point group and its order.\n    wallpaper_groups_data = {\n        'p1':   {'point_group': '1',   'order': 1},\n        'p2':   {'point_group': '2',   'order': 2},\n        'pm':   {'point_group': 'm',   'order': 2},\n        'pg':   {'point_group': 'm',   'order': 2},\n        'cm':   {'point_group': 'm',   'order': 2},\n        'p2mm': {'point_group': '2mm', 'order': 4},\n        'p2mg': {'point_group': '2mm', 'order': 4},\n        'p2gg': {'point_group': '2mm', 'order': 4},\n        'c2mm': {'point_group': '2mm', 'order': 4},\n        'p4':   {'point_group': '4',   'order': 4},\n        'p4mm': {'point_group': '4mm', 'order': 8},\n        'p4gm': {'point_group': '4mm', 'order': 8},\n        'p3':   {'point_group': '3',   'order': 3},\n        'p3m1': {'point_group': '3m',  'order': 6},\n        'p31m': {'point_group': '3m',  'order': 6},\n        'p6':   {'point_group': '6',   'order': 6},\n        'p6mm': {'point_group': '6mm', 'order': 12}\n    }\n\n    target_order = 2\n    \n    print(f\"Finding wallpaper groups where the point group has an order of {target_order}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Group wallpaper groups by their point group name\n    groups_by_pg = {}\n    for wg_name, data in wallpaper_groups_data.items():\n        if data['order'] == target_order:\n            pg_name = data['point_group']\n            if pg_name not in groups_by_pg:\n                groups_by_pg[pg_name] = []\n            groups_by_pg[pg_name].append(wg_name)\n    \n    counts = []\n    total_count = 0\n\n    # Print the breakdown\n    for pg_name, wg_list in sorted(groups_by_pg.items()):\n        count = len(wg_list)\n        counts.append(str(count))\n        total_count += count\n        print(f\"Point group '{pg_name}' has order {target_order}.\")\n        print(f\"  - It corresponds to {count} wallpaper group(s): {', '.join(wg_list)}\")\n        \n    # Print the final equation and total\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(counts)\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"The calculation for the total is: {equation_str} = {total_count}\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, there are a total of {total_count} wallpaper groups with a point group of order {target_order}.\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncount_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
