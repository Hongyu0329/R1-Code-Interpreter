    This function determines the smallest possible number of complements a topology can have.

    A complement S to a topology T on a set X is another topology such that:
    1. T union S generates the discrete topology.
    2. T intersect S is the trivial topology {empty_set, X}.

    The problem specifies the set X has cardinality of the continuum, and the topology T
    is neither trivial nor discrete.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. We seek the minimum size of the set of complements for any valid topology T.
    2. It has been proven that there exist topologies on any infinite set that have
       exactly one complement. These are known as uniquely complemented topologies.
       (See W. J. R. Mitchell, "A uniquely complemented topology on an infinite set", 1998).
    3. Since a topology with one complement exists, and the number of complements cannot be zero
       (we can construct topologies with complements), the minimum possible number of complements is 1.
