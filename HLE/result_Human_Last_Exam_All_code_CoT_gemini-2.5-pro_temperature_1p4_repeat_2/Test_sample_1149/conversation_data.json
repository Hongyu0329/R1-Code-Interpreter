    "This is a question that requires retrieving a specific piece of anatomical information from paleontological research papers. My plan is to find the number of depressions from the scientific description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull and then present this number using a Python script as requested.\n\nThe information is based on the description of the holotype skull of *Irritator challengeri* (specimen SMNS 58022). The lacrimal bone, which is part of the skull, features a recess (the lacrimal recess) that contains a specific number of openings, or depressions. According to the scientific literature, there are two such depressions.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to output this answer.\n\n```python\n# This script provides the answer to the anatomical question about Irritator challengeri.\n\n# Based on paleontological descriptions, the lacrimal recess in the skull\n# of Irritator challengeri contains a specific number of depressions (pneumatic foramina).\nnumber_of_depressions = 2\n\n# We will now print this information.\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {number_of_depressions} depressions.\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
