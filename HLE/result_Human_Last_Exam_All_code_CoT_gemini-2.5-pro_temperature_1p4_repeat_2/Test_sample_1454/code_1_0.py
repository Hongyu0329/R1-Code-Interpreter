    The problem asks for the smallest possible number of nondegenerate, locally connected components
    of a closed set F in [0,1]^2 that satisfies the equation:
    
        F = union over d in D of (F+d)/4
    
    where D = {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)}.

    This equation defines F as a fixed point of a Hutchinson operator. We need to find all possible
    closed sets F that satisfy this and then find the minimum number of components.

    There are two possible sets F that satisfy the condition:

    1. The empty set: F = {}.
       The empty set is a closed set. Plugging it into the equation:
       union over d in D of ({} + d)/4 = union({}) = {}
       So, F = {} is a valid solution. The empty set has 0 components. Therefore, the number
       of components with the desired properties is 0.

    2. The non-empty attractor: F = C x [0,1].
       This is the unique non-empty compact set satisfying the equation. Here, C is the
       middle-half Cantor set on the x-axis, and [0,1] is the interval on the y-axis.
       The components of this set are the vertical line segments {x} x [0,1] for each point x in
       the Cantor set C.
       - Each component is a line segment, so it is 'nondegenerate' (not a single point).
       - Each component is a line segment, so it is 'locally connected'.
       The number of components is equal to the number of points in the Cantor set C, which is
       uncountably infinite.

    Comparing the two possibilities:
    The problem asks for the "smallest possible number". The possible numbers of components are 0
    (from the empty set) and infinity (from the non-empty attractor). The smallest of these is 0.
