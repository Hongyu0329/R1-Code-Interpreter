# The individual in question is identified through several specific clues:
# 1. His work is interpreted by Veronika Campan.
# 2. His analysis focuses on the "prohibition against representation," a key concept in the Ten Commandments.
# 3. He specifically discusses the commandments concerning "another's material possessions" (coveting).
# These clues point directly to Sigmund Freud and his 1939 book "Moses and Monotheism."
# In this book, Freud offers a psychoanalytic interpretation of the Ten Commandments, emphasizing the significance of
# both the ban on images and the advanced psychological nature of the prohibition on coveting.

# The script will now print his full name.
