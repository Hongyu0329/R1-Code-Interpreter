        "2. The key is to identify the clause that hides a 'material term' or violates the 'doctrine of reasonable expectations'. A material term is one a user would not expect and would likely not agree to if they could negotiate.",
        "3. Option G states: 'You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content... without any compensation to you.'",
        "4. This clause is highly material because it allows the company to use a person's identity (name and photo) and actions as an endorsement in advertisements.",
        "5. This practice arguably violates the 'doctrine of reasonable expectations'. A user reasonably expects that 'liking' a page will show that activity to their friends, but they do not reasonably expect their identity to be formally attached to a paid advertisement shown to their social network, all without their specific consent for that ad or any compensation.",
        "6. While other clauses are restrictive, they are often more standard or expected for the type of service offered (e.g., no-scraping, no-benchmarking). Clause G grants the service a significant commercial right by leveraging the user's personal identity in a way that is not immediately obvious from the core function of the service.",
        "7. Therefore, this clause is the most likely to be considered a hidden material term within a contract of adhesion."
