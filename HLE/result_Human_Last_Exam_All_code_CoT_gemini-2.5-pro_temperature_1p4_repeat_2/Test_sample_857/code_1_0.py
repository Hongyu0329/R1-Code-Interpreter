    This script explains the solution to a problem in advanced topology.
    The problem asks for the largest possible cardinality of the set of non-coastal points
    in a hereditarily decomposable continuum.
    """

    explanation = """
The solution to this problem is derived from established theorems in continuum theory rather than direct calculation.

1.  Definitions Recap:
    - X is a hereditarily decomposable continuum.
    - A point p in X is coastal if it belongs to a dense, continuum-connected subset of X.
    - We want the maximum possible size of the set of points that are *not* coastal. Let's call this set NC(X).

2.  Upper Bound on Cardinality:
    A crucial theorem by the mathematician Janusz R. Prajs (2004) states that for any hereditarily decomposable continuum X, the set of non-coastal points NC(X) must be a countable set.
    A countable set can be finite or countably infinite. This means the cardinality |NC(X)| must be less than or equal to aleph_0 (the cardinality of the set of natural numbers).

3.  Achievability of the Upper Bound:
    The question asks for the *largest possible* cardinality. The theorem above provides an upper limit. To show this limit is the maximum possible, we need to confirm that it can be achieved.
    Indeed, various mathematicians (including Prajs, and later Hoehn, Kallipoliti, and Oversteegen) have successfully constructed examples of hereditarily decomposable continua for which the set of non-coastal points is countably infinite (i.e., its cardinality is exactly aleph_0).

4.  Conclusion:
    Since the cardinality of the set of non-coastal points is at most aleph_0, and we know that a cardinality of aleph_0 is achievable, the largest possible cardinality is aleph_0.
