# --- Biological Explanation ---
# The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system presents peptides to T-cells.
# This is a key step in immune surveillance to detect foreign invaders or cancerous cells.
# However, this system can mistakenly present "self-antigens" (peptides from the body's own proteins).
# If a T-cell recognizes a self-antigen and becomes activated, it can trigger an autoimmune response,
# where the immune system attacks the body's own tissues.

# A 1000-fold increase in the presentation of a specific disease-causing self-antigen
# dramatically raises the probability that a self-reactive T-cell will encounter this antigen and get activated.
# Therefore, this change would very likely INCREASE a person's risk of developing the associated disease.

# --- Mathematical Illustration ---
# Let's assign a hypothetical baseline probability for this event to illustrate the change.
baseline_probability = 0.00002 # A small, hypothetical base risk

# The fold increase from the new HLA variant.
fold_increase = 1000

# Calculate the new probability.
new_probability = baseline_probability * fold_increase

# Print the calculation in the specified equation format.
