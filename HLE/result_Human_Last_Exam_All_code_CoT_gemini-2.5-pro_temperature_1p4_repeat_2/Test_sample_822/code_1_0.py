    Analyzes the provided medical case study to determine the most likely disease.

    The key features pointing to the diagnosis are:
    - Initial symptoms: Polyarthritis, fatigue.
    - Imaging: Multiple pulmonary nodules.
    - Progressive symptoms: Systemic signs like confusion, bruising, and cutaneous lesions, suggesting vasculitis.
    - Complications: High susceptibility to a severe, treatment-resistant infection leading to sepsis, indicating an immunocompromised state often associated with both the disease and its treatment (steroids).

    This combination of upper/lower respiratory tract disease, polyarthritis, and systemic vasculitis is a classic presentation of Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA).
