    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms in the molecule:** Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it contains 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Understand the 6-31G basis set:** This notation tells us how many functions are used to represent the atomic orbitals of each element.\n    *   **For Carbon (C):** It is a second-row element with core (1s) and valence (2s, 2p) electrons.\n        *   The `6` represents the core 1s orbital, which is described by **1** contracted Gaussian function.\n        *   The `31` represents the split-valence shell. This means each valence orbital (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz) is described by two functions: an \"inner\" part and an \"outer\" part.\n            *   The inner part (from the `3`) contributes 1 function for the 2s orbital and 3 functions for the 2p orbitals (px, py, pz).\n            *   The outer part (from the `1`) contributes another 1 function for the 2s orbital and 3 functions for the 2p orbitals.\n        *   In total, a single Carbon atom has 1 (core) + 2 (for 2s) + 6 (for 2p) = **9** contracted functions.\n    *   **For Hydrogen (H):** It is a first-row element with only a valence 1s orbital.\n        *   The `31` split applies directly to the 1s orbital.\n        *   This means the 1s orbital is represented by **2** contracted functions (an inner part from `3` primitives and an outer part from `1` primitive).\n3.  **Calculate the total:** Multiply the number of each type of atom by the number of functions it contributes and sum the results.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this calculation and print the final result.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon = 7\nnum_hydrogen = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon: 1 (1s core) + 2 (2s valence) + 6 (2p valence) = 9\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen: 2 (1s valence)\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions\ntotal_functions_carbon = num_carbon * functions_per_carbon\ntotal_functions_hydrogen = num_hydrogen * functions_per_hydrogen\ntotal_functions = total_functions_carbon + total_functions_hydrogen\n\n# Print the explanation and the final calculation\nprint(\"Calculation for the number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with the 6-31G basis set.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 80)\nprint(f\"Number of Carbon atoms: {num_carbon}\")\nprint(f\"Number of Hydrogen atoms: {num_hydrogen}\")\nprint(\"\\nAccording to the 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"  - Each Carbon atom contributes {functions_per_carbon} functions.\")\nprint(f\"  - Each Hydrogen atom contributes {functions_per_hydrogen} functions.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe total number of functions is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"Total = (Number of C atoms * Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms * Functions per H)\")\nprint(f\"Total = ({num_carbon} * {functions_per_carbon}) + ({num_hydrogen} * {functions_per_hydrogen})\")\nprint(f\"Total = {total_functions_carbon} + {total_functions_hydrogen}\")\nprint(f\"Total = {total_functions}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer: {total_functions} contracted Gaussian functions are used.\")\n<<<79>>>\n```"
