def solve():
    """
    This function determines the necessary assumptions and formats the answer
    in Conjunctive Normal Form.

    The problem asks for the assumptions required to prove that the expected
    information gain for a Bayesian agent approaches zero.

    1.  Assumption (a), finite prior entropy, provides an upper bound on the total
        information that can be gained. If the sum of information gains over time is
        finite, the terms must approach zero. This is a critical information-theoretic
        condition.

    2.  Assumption (b), a well-behaved MDP (finite or compact state space with
        Lipschitz dynamics), is necessary to ensure the stability of the learning
        process in an interactive setting. It prevents pathological feedback loops
        where the agent's actions prevent it from learning effectively.

    3.  Assumptions (c), (d), and (e) are flawed. (c) is a consequence, not a
        prerequisite. (d) contradicts the non-i.i.d. nature of an agent acting
        in the world. (e) is a restatement of the conclusion, not a foundational
        assumption.

    Therefore, both (a) and (b) are required assumptions. The logical form is "a AND b".
    In the specified Conjunctive Normal Form, this is written as [(a) AND (b)],
    with clauses and literals alphabetized.
