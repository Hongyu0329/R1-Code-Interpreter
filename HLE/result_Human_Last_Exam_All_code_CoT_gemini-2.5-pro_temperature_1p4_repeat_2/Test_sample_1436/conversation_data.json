    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the symmetry factor of the described Feynman diagram, followed by a Python script to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Diagram Structure:** The user describes a Feynman diagram with two vertices and four field contractions. In a connected diagram with only two vertices, these four contractions must be propagators (lines) that connect the two vertices. This creates a diagram that looks like two points connected by four parallel lines. This is a common vacuum diagram in theories like $\\lambda\\phi^4$.\n\n2.  **Define Symmetry Factor:** The symmetry factor, `S`, of a Feynman diagram is the order of its automorphism group. In simpler terms, it's the number of ways you can swap identical components (vertices and lines) without changing the diagram's overall structure (i.e., how everything is connected).\n\n3.  **Calculate Vertex Symmetry:** The diagram has two vertices. Assuming they arise from the same interaction term in the Lagrangian (e.g., both are $\\phi^4$ vertices), they are identical. Swapping these two vertices leaves the diagram unchanged. The number of permutations is 2!.\n\n4.  **Calculate Line Symmetry:** The diagram has four lines connecting the two vertices. These lines are also identical (representing the same type of propagator). They can be freely interchanged without altering the diagram. The number of permutations is 4!.\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Symmetry Factor:** The total symmetry factor is the product of the individual symmetry contributions from permuting vertices and lines, as these are independent operations.\n    *   S = (Vertex Permutations) * (Line Permutations)\n    *   S = 2! * 4!\n\n6.  **Code the Solution:** A Python script will be written to calculate these factorial values and multiply them, printing out each step of the calculation for clarity.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with\n    two vertices and four internal lines connecting them.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of identical vertices in the diagram\n    num_vertices = 2\n\n    # Number of identical lines (propagators) connecting the vertices\n    num_lines = 4\n\n    print(\"Calculating the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two vertices and four connecting lines.\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # 1.
