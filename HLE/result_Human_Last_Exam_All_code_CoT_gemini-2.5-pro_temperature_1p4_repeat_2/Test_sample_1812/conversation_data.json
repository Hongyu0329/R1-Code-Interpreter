    "My plan is to compute the determinant of the provided 3x3 matrix. The information about the Markov quiver and \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) is context, but the core task is a matrix determinant calculation.\n\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} \na & b & c \\\\ \nd & e & f \\\\ \ng & h & i \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nis `det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n\nI will write a Python script that:\n1.
