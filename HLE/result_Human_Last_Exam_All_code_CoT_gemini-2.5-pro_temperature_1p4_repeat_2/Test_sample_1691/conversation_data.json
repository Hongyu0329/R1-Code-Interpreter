    "To develop an analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$, we can use asymptotic analysis.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the singular behavior**: The integral is $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + f(x)} dx$, where $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the integrand becomes very large where $f(x)$ is very small. This occurs near $x=0$, since $f(0)=0$. The dominant contribution to the integral will come from this region.\n2.  **Approximate the function**: Near $x=0$, the function $f(x)$ can be approximated by its term with the lowest power of $x$. So, $f(x) \\approx a x^d$, with $a = 9.0$ and $d = 5.0$.\n3.  **Approximate the integral**: We can approximate the integral by using the simplified form of $f(x)$ and extending the integration limit from $15.0$ to $\\infty$. The error introduced by extending the limit is a constant term, which is less significant than the term dependent on $\\epsilon$. The approximate integral is $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + a x^d} dx$.\n4.  **Solve the approximate integral**: This integral can be solved analytically. The result is of the form $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\epsilon^p$. A change of variables shows that the power is $p = (1-d)/d$ and the coefficient is $C = \\frac{\\pi}{d \\sin(\\pi/d)} a^{-1/d}$.\n5.  **Calculate and present the formula**: I will use a Python script to compute the numerical values of the coefficient $C$ and the power $p$ and then print the resulting analytical formula.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and display the final formula.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the analytical approximation for the integral\n    I(epsilon) = integral from 0 to 15 of 1 / (epsilon + 9*x^5 + 5*x^6 + 9*x^8) dx\n    for small epsilon.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The function in the denominator is f(x) = 9.0*x^5.0 + 5.0*x^6.0 + 9.0*x^8.0.\n    # For small x, the dominant term is a * x^d.\n    a = 9.0\n    d = 5.0\n\n    # The integral is approximated as I(eps) ~ C * eps^p.\n    # The power p is given by p = (1-d)/d.\n    p = (1.0 - d) / d\n\n    # The coefficient C is given by C = (1/d) * a**(-1/d) * (pi / sin(pi/d)).\n    C = (1.0 / d) * (a**(-1.0 / d)) * (np.pi / np.sin(np.pi / d))\n\n    # Print the final derived formula with the calculated numerical values.\n    # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    print(\"The analytical formula that approximates I(epsilon) for small epsilon is:\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) \\u2248 {C:.4f} * epsilon^({p})\")\n    \n    # We can also express C and p as fractions for clarity\n    print(\"\\nIn fractional form, the formula is:\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) \\u2248 C * epsilon^(-4/5)\")\n    print(f\"where the coefficient C = (\\u03C0 / (5 * sin(\\u03C0/5))) * 9^(-1/5) \\u2248 {C:.4f}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<I(epsilon) = 0.7039 * epsilon^(-0.8)>>>"
