    "To find the French equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\", we can follow a linguistic and etymological approach.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the original name:** \"Odobeccus\" is the Latinized form of a name from late antiquity in Gaul. The `-us` ending is a standard Latin nominative suffix and can be removed to find the root name.\n2.  **Deconstruct the name root:** The root, \"Odobecc\", appears to be composed of two parts: \"Odo-\" and \"-becc\".\n3.  **Trace the etymology of the first part:** \"Odo-\" is a well-known Germanic (specifically, Frankish) element meaning \"wealth\" or \"riches\". In French, this element evolved into the name **Eudes**. A famous example is Odo of Paris, who is known as Eudes de Paris in French.\n4.  **Trace the etymology of the second part:** \"-becc\" comes from the Gaulish word \"beccos\", meaning \"beak\". This word was adopted into the Vulgar Latin of Gaul and survived into modern French as **bec**.\n5.  **Combine the French parts:** By combining the French equivalents of the two parts, we get the modern French equivalent of the name.\n\n\"Odo-\" -> \"Eudes\"\n\"-becc\" -> \"bec\"\n\nTherefore, \"Odobeccus\" becomes **Eudesbec**.\n\nHere is a Python script to display the result.\n\n```python\n# This script finds the French equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\".\n# The name is deconstructed into its etymological roots, and their French descendants are identified.\n\n# The original name in its Latinized form\nlatin_name = \"Odobeccus\"\n\n# Part 1: \"Odo-\"\n# This is a Germanic root that became \"Eudes\" in French.\nfrench_part1 = \"Eudes\"\n\n# Part 2: \"-beccus\"\n# This comes from the Gaulish \"beccos\", which became \"bec\" in French.\nfrench_part2 = \"bec\"\n\n# Combine the parts to form the full French name.\nfrench_equivalent = french_part1 + french_part2\n\n# Print the resulting name.\nprint(f\"The French equivalent of '{latin_name}' is '{french_equivalent}'.\")\n```\n<<<Eudesbec>>>"
