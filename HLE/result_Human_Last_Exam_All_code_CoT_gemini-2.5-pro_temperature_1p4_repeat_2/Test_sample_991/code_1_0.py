# My plan is to solve this riddle by breaking it down into visual parts
# and assembling them into a single Chinese character.

print("Let's solve the riddle: 'A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center.'")
print("-" * 40)

# Step 1: Identify the "wooden stick".
# This is a common description for the Chinese radical for 'wood' or 'tree'.
part1_char = "木"
part1_desc = "A wooden stick"
print(f"'{part1_desc}' refers to the component: {part1_char} (mù)")

# Step 2: Identify the "square box" with a "ladder" inside.
# The component 田 (tián) looks like a square box with a cross, or 'ladder', in its center.
# The word "hanging" suggests this part is on top of the stick.
part2_char = "田"
part2_desc = "A square box, a ladder placed in the center"
print(f"'{part2_desc}' refers to the component: {part2_char} (tián)")

# Step 3: Create the "final equation" by combining the parts.
# The character is formed by placing the 田 component on top of the 木 component.
final_character = "果"
print("\nNow, let's assemble the parts into a final 'equation':")
print(f"Component '{part1_char}' + Component '{part2_char}' = Final Character '{final_character}'")

# Final Answer
print(f"\nThus, the character described by the riddle is {final_character} (guǒ), which means 'fruit'.")
