    "This is a classic problem in differential topology, and the answer can be found using Morse theory.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the topological space**: The space is the 2-torus, denoted as $T^2$. It is a compact, connected surface (like a donut).\n2.  **Relate critical points to topology**: For any smooth function on a compact manifold like the torus, a set of results known as the Morse inequalities relate the number of critical points to the topological invariants of the space, specifically its Betti numbers.\n3.  **State the key theorem**: A fundamental result, which is a consequence of the Morse inequalities, states that the total number of critical points for any smooth function $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must be greater than or equal to the sum of the Betti numbers of the manifold $M$.\n    *   Minimal number of critical points $\\ge \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim(M)} b_k(M)$.\n4.  **Determine the Betti numbers for the 2-torus ($T^2$)**:\n    *   $b_0$: The number of connected components. For a torus, $b_0 = 1$.\n    *   $b_1$: The number of one-dimensional \"holes\" or non-contractible loops. A torus has two independent loops (one \"around\" the tube, and one \"through\" the hole). So, $b_1 = 2$.\n    *   $b_2$: The number of two-dimensional \"voids\". The interior of the donut shape constitutes one such void. So, $b_2 = 1$.\n5.  **Calculate the lower bound**: Sum the Betti numbers to find the theoretical minimum number of critical points.\n6.  **Confirm the minimum**: To prove this lower bound is the true minimum, we need to show that there exists a function that has exactly this number of critical points. A standard example is the height function on a torus placed vertically. This function has one minimum, two saddle points, and one maximum, for a total of four critical points.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the calculation based on this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_critical_points_on_torus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function\n    on a 2-torus using Morse theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2)\n    # b_0: number of connected components\n    b_0 = 1\n    # b_1: number of 1D holes (non-contractible loops)\n    b_1 = 2\n    # b_2: number of 2D voids/cavities\n    b_2 = 1\n    \n    betti_numbers = [b_0, b_1, b_2]\n\n    # According to a result from Morse theory, the number of critical points of a smooth\n    # function on a compact manifold is at least the sum of its Betti numbers.\n    min_critical_points = sum(betti_numbers)\n\n    # We demonstrate that this minimum is achievable.\n    # Consider the height function on a torus standing vertically.
