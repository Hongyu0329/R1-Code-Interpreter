    "This problem asks for the natural density of primes $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$. This is a classic application of the Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Chebotarev Density Theorem:** According to this theorem, the desired density is the ratio of the number of elements in the Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$ that correspond to the irreducible case, divided by the total number of elements in the group, $|G|$.\n2.  **Galois Group:** The polynomial $f(x)$ is a known polynomial, sometimes referred to as Trinks's polynomial. Its Galois group over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the projective special linear group $PSL(2,7)$, also isomorphic to $GL(3,2)$. This is a simple group of order 168.\n3.  **Irreducibility Condition:** For $f(x)$ (a degree 7 polynomial) to be irreducible modulo $p$, the corresponding Frobenius element in the Galois group must act as a single 7-cycle on the 7 roots of the polynomial.\n4.  **Counting 7-cycles:** Elements that act as 7-cycles are precisely the elements of order 7 in the Galois group $G = PSL(2,7)$.\n5.  **Calculation:** The task is to compute the order of $G$ and the number of elements of order 7 within it. The density is then the ratio:\n    $$ \\text{Density} = \\frac{\\text{Number of elements of order 7 in } G}{|G|} $$\n6.  **Implementation:** I will use the `sympy` library in Python to represent the group $PSL(2,7)$ and programmatically count the elements of order 7. This provides a direct computational solution to the problem. The script will then calculate and print the final fraction.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.named_groups import PSL\n\ndef solve_density():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the natural density of primes p for which the polynomial\n    f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 is irreducible mod p.\n\n    This is done by analyzing the structure of its Galois group, PSL(2,7).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The Galois group of the polynomial is PSL(2,7).\n    # We create this group using sympy.\n    # By default, sympy represents PSL(2,7) as a permutation group on 8 points.\n    try:\n        G = PSL(2, 7)\n    except ImportError:\n        print(\"Sympy library not found.
