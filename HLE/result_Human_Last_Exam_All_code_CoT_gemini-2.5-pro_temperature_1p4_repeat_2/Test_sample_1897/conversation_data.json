    "My plan to solve this problem is to use the theory of q-series and modular functions. Here are the steps:\n1.  First, I will represent the infinite product in terms of q-series notation. The product is $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$. If we let $q = e^{-\\pi}$, the product becomes $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$. This is a standard q-series denoted as $(q;q^2)_{\\infty}$.\n2.  Next, I'll express this q-series using the Euler function $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$. The identity is $(q;q^2)_{\\infty} = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)}$. So, our product is $P = \\frac{\\phi(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})}$.\n3.  Then, I will relate the Euler function $\\phi(q)$ to the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$, which is defined as $\\eta(\\tau) = q^{1/24}\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$ where $q = e^{2\\pi i\\tau}$. This relation is $\\phi(q) = q^{-1/24}\\eta(\\tau)$.\n4.  By substituting the appropriate values of $\\tau$ for $q=e^{-\\pi}$ (which gives $\\tau=i/2$) and for $q=e^{-2\\pi}$ (which gives $\\tau=i$), I can express the product $P$ in terms of values of the eta function at imaginary arguments.\n5.  The resulting ratio of eta functions, $\\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}$, can be identified as a value of a Weber modular function, specifically $f_1(i)$.\n6.  The values of Weber modular functions at $\\tau=i$ are well-known. Using the standard identities $f_1(i)=f_2(i)$ and $f(i)f_1(i)f_2(i)=\\sqrt{2}$, along with the known value $f(i)=2^{1/4}$ (which can be derived from the j-invariant $j(i)=1728$), I will find the value of $f_1(i)$.\n7.  Finally, I will combine all these pieces to arrive at the closed-form expression for the product $P$.\n\nI will now implement this plan in Python code. The code will print the derivation steps and the final expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_infinite_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds a closed-form expression for the infinite product\n    P = product_{n=0 to inf} (1 - exp(-(2n+1)*pi)).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Let P be the infinite product we want to find:\")\n    print(\"P = \\u220F_{n=0}^{\\u221E} (1 - exp(-(2n+1)\\u03C0))\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Express the product in terms of q-series.\")\n    print(\"Let q = exp(-\\u03C0).
