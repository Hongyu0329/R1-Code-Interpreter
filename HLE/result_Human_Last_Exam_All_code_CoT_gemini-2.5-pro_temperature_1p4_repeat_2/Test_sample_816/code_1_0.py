    Explains the dominant mechanism for inward flow in a GTAW weld pool
    for 304 stainless steel.
    """
    explanation = """
The dominant mechanism responsible for the inward flow of the outer portions of the weld pool is the Marangoni force, also known as the surface tension gradient force.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1.  **Surface Tension and Temperature:** The flow on the surface of a liquid weld pool is heavily influenced by gradients in surface tension. Surface tension itself is a function of temperature and material composition.

2.  **Surface-Active Elements:** 304 stainless steel contains surface-active elements, most notably sulfur (S). The presence of these elements fundamentally changes how surface tension behaves with temperature.

3.  **Positive Surface Tension Gradient (dÎ³/dT > 0):** For materials with sufficient surface-active elements like 304 stainless steel, the surface tension *increases* as the temperature increases. The center of the weld pool, directly under the arc, is the hottest part.

4.  **Flow Direction:** Fluid on a surface naturally flows from regions of lower surface tension to regions of higher surface tension.
    *   The outer, cooler portions of the weld pool have lower surface tension.
    *   The inner, hotter center of the weld pool has higher surface tension.
    *   Therefore, the flow is directed from the outer edges **inwards** towards the center.

5.  **Conclusion:** This inward flow, driven by the Marangoni effect, concentrates heat at the center, leading to a deeper and narrower weld penetration profile, a well-documented phenomenon for steels. The other forces listed are either less dominant for this surface effect (Lorentz, Buoyancy) or would cause an outward flow (Arc Drag).
