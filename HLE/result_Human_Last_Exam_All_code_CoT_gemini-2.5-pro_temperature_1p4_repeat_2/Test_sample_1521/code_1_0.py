Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

--- Question 1: The original Markov chain ---

1.  **Setup**: We have an irreducible Markov chain $X_n$ with a given function $h(x)$ which is zero on a finite set $A$, positive elsewhere, harmonic outside $A$, and tends to infinity at infinity.

2.  **Key Insight (Martingale)**: We can define a process $M_n = h(X_{n \\wedge T_A})$, where $T_A$ is the first time the chain hits the set $A$. For any starting point not in $A$, this process is a non-negative martingale.

3.  **Analysis**: The Martingale Convergence Theorem implies $M_n$ converges almost surely.
    - If the chain hits $A$ (i.e., $T_A < \\infty$), $M_n$ eventually becomes $h(X_{T_A}) = 0$.
    - If the chain never hits $A$ (i.e., $T_A = \\infty$), it must go to infinity, and since $h(x) \\to \\infty$, $M_n \\to \\infty$.

4.  **Conclusion**: The expectation of the martingale is bounded ($E[M_n] = h(X_0)$). An infinite outcome for $M_\\infty$ would lead to an infinite expectation, unless the probability of that outcome is zero. Therefore, the probability of never hitting $A$ must be zero. Since the chain is irreducible and is sure to hit the finite set $A$ from any state, it is recurrent.

The first answer is '{}'.

--- Question 2: The h-transformed Markov chain ---

1.  **Setup**: The new chain has transitions $q(x,y) = p(x,y) \\times \\frac{h(y)}{h(x)}$.

2.  **Key Insight (No return to A)**: The definition of $q(x,y)$ has a critical consequence. For any state $x \\notin A$ and any state $y \\in A$, we have $h(y)=0$. This forces the transition probability to be zero:
    $q(x,y) = p(x,y) \\times \\frac{h(y)}{h(x)} = p(x,y) \\times \\frac{0}{h(x)} = 0$.
    This means that once the chain is outside of set $A$, it can never return to $A$.

3.  **Analysis**:
    - Any state in $A$ is transient because the original chain's irreducibility ensures the chain can leave $A$. Once the q-chain leaves $A$, it never returns.
    - The states in $\\Sigma \\setminus A$ are also transient. The $h$-transform biases the walk to move towards states where $h$ is larger, effectively "pushing" the chain towards infinity and away from $A$. This behavior is characteristic of a transient process.

4.  **Example Equation**: To illustrate, consider a 1D symmetric random walk on $\\mathbb{Z}$ ($p(x, x\\pm1) = 0.5$), which is recurrent. Let $A = \\{0\\}$ and $h(x)=|x|$. For $x=10$:
    The original transitions are p(10, 11) = 0.5 and p(10, 9) = 0.5.
    The new transition probabilities are calculated as follows:
    q(10, 11) = p(10, 11) * h(11)/h(10) = 0.5 * 11/10 = 0.55
    q(10, 9) = p(10, 9) * h(9)/h(10) = 0.5 * 9/10 = 0.45
    The numbers in the final equations are 10, 11, 0.5, 11, 10, 0.55 and 10, 9, 0.5, 9, 10, 0.45.
    The bias towards infinity makes the new chain transient.

5.  **Conclusion**: Since all states in the new chain are transient, the chain is transient.

The second answer is '{}'.
