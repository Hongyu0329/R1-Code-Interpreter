    "This is a biological question about neuroanatomy, not a computational task that can be solved with a script. I will provide the answer based on established neuroanatomical knowledge of cephalopods.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a major component of the posterior subesophageal mass in the cuttlefish brain. It is one of the most posterior lobes itself. The structures that are anatomically located directly posterior to, or extending from, the main body of the palliovisceral lobe are the **giant fiber lobes**. These lobes are the origin of the giant axon system that controls the powerful contractions of the mantle for jet propulsion. Therefore, the giant fiber lobes and the subsequent pallial nerves that exit the brain are the most posterior adjacent structures.\n\n<<<The giant fiber lobes.>>>"
