    "This problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of a complete graph $K_n$. Let the family of bipartite graphs be $\\mathcal{B} = \\{B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_k\\}$. We are looking for the minimum value of $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(B_i)|$, where $V(B_i)$ is the set of vertices of graph $B_i$.\n\nThis is a well-known problem in extremal combinatorics. A theorem by G. Hansel (and later proved in different ways by others like G. Katona) provides the answer. The theorem states that the minimum sum of the sizes of the vertex sets of bipartite subgraphs of $K_n$ needed to cover all its edges is exactly $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this for n = 35:\n1.  Set the value of $n$ to 35.\n2.  Calculate $\\log_2(35)$.\n3.  Apply the ceiling function to find $\\lceil \\log_2(35) \\rceil$. The ceiling function $\\lceil x \\rceil$ gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$.\n4.  Multiply the result from step 3 by $n=35$ to get the final answer.\n5.  I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print out the components of the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_graph_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\n    covering all the edges of the complete graph K_n for n = 35.\n    \n    The solution is based on the theorem that the minimum value is n * ceil(log2(n)).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 35\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate k = ceil(log2(n))\n    # 2^5 = 32 and 2^6 = 64, so log2(35) is between 5 and 6.\n    # The ceiling will be 6.\n    k = math.ceil(math.log2(n))\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the result by multiplying n with k\n    result = n * k\n\n    # Step 3: Print the explanation and the final calculation,\n    # showing each number in the equation.\n    print(f\"The complete graph is K_n where n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"The minimum total number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering K_n is given by the formula: n * ceil(log2(n)).\")\n    print(f\"First, we calculate the value of ceil(log2({n})).\")\n    print(f\"log2({n}) is approximately {math.log2(n):.4f}\")\n    print(f\"The ceiling of {math.log2(n):.4f} is {k}.\")\n    print(\"\\nNow, we compute the final result:\")\n    print(f\"{n} * {k} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_graph_problem()\n```\n<<<210>>>"
