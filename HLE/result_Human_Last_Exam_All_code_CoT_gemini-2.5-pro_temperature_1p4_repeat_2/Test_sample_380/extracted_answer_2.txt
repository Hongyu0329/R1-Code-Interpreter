Your physical intuition is correct. For a rigorous analysis of Alfven Ion Cyclotron waves, one must calculate the normalized magnetic helicity using magnetic field components that are perpendicular to the local background magnetic field, not just perpendicular to the radial direction. The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial due to the Parker Spiral. Therefore, a transformation into a Field-Aligned Coordinate (FAC) system is the proper method.
