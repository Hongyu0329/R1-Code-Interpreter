    print("The word 'rusybavlamdei' is a 'lujvo' (a compound word). It is composed of the following root forms ('rafsi'):")
    print(" - rusy-: from 'grusi', meaning 'gray'.")
    print(" - bav-: from 'balvi', meaning 'future'.")
    print(" - lam-: from 'mlana', meaning 'adjacent' or 'side'.")
    print(" - dei: from 'djedi', meaning 'day' or '24-hour period'.")

    print("Step 2: Analyze the structure of the compound word.")
    print("In Lojban, the final component of a 'lujvo' (the 'seltau') defines the main relationship and its argument structure (place structure).")
    print("The components that come before it act as modifiers, typically describing the first argument (x1) of the 'seltau'.")

    print("The full term 'rusybavlamdei' inherits the place structure of 'djedi'. The modifier part, 'rusybavlam-' (gray-future-adjacent), specifies the nature of the x1 argument.")
    print("Therefore, the place structure for 'rusybavlamdei' is:")
    print(" - x1: a 'gray-future-adjacent' event or period.")
    print(" - x2: the number of full days corresponding to x1.")
    print(" - x3: the 'day standard'.")

    print("Step 5: Conclusion.")
    print("The question asks for the most likely interpretation of the second (x2) and third (x3) arguments.")
    print("Based on our analysis, x2 is 'the number of full days' and x3 is 'the day standard'.")
