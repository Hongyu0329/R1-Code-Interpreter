def solve_construction():
    """
    This function determines the shortest sequence of commands to construct an inscribed square.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. A square inscribed in a circle has two perpendicular diameters as its diagonals.
    2. Given the circle's center (O) and a point on its circumference (A), the first diameter is found by drawing a line through O and A. This gives a new point C. This is command 'L'.
    3. The second diameter must be perpendicular to the first (AC) and pass through O. This is achieved by constructing the perpendicular bisector of the segment AC.
    4. To construct the perpendicular bisector of AC, draw a circle centered at A passing through C (command 'C'), and a second circle centered at C passing through A (command 'C').
    5. The line connecting the two intersection points of these new circles is the perpendicular bisector. This is command 'L'.
    6. This process finds all four vertices of the square.

    The shortest sequence of commands is therefore LCCL.
