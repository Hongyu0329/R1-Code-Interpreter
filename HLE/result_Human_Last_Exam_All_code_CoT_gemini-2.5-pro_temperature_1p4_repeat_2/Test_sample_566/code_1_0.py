    # Step 1: Explain the basic CARS principle and its equation.
    print("Step 1: Understand the CARS process.")
    print("In CARS, three laser beams interact with a sample: a pump beam (frequency ω_p), a Stokes beam (frequency ω_s), and a probe beam (frequency ω_pr).")
    print("When the frequency difference between the pump and Stokes beams matches a molecular vibration (Ω), a coherent excitation occurs.")
    print("This is the resonance condition: Ω = ω_p - ω_s")
    print("The probe beam then interacts with this excited state to generate a signal at the anti-Stokes frequency (ω_as).")
    print("The final equation for the anti-Stokes signal frequency is:")
    omega_as = "ω_as"
    omega_p = "ω_p"
    omega_s = "ω_s"
    omega_pr = "ω_pr"
    print(f"-> {omega_as} = {omega_p} - {omega_s} + {omega_pr}")
    print("Often, the pump and probe beams are the same, so the equation simplifies to ω_as = 2*ω_p - ω_s.\n")

    # Step 2: Explain Broadband CARS (B-CARS).
    print("Step 2: Understand the 'Broadband' modification.")
    print("In Broadband CARS (or multiplex CARS), one of the beams has a wide range of frequencies (is broadband).")
    print("While the question specifies a broadband pump beam, the most common B-CARS configuration uses a narrowband pump and a broadband Stokes beam. The principle, however, is to cover a wide range of frequency differences (ω_p - ω_s) at once.")
    print("By doing so, many different vibrational modes (Ω_1, Ω_2, Ω_3, ...) can be excited simultaneously.\n")

    # Step 3: Describe the resulting signal.
    print("Step 3: Characterize the anti-Stokes signal in B-CARS.")
    print("Since multiple vibrations are excited, an anti-Stokes signal is generated for each one.")
    print("This means the total anti-Stokes signal is itself broadband, composed of different frequency components, where each component corresponds to a specific molecular vibration.")
    print("By using a spectrometer to analyze this signal, one can measure an entire vibrational spectrum from the sample in a single shot.\n")

    # Step 4: Evaluate the answer choices.
    print("Step 4: Evaluate the given options.")
    print("A. You can only generate a Stokes beam: Incorrect. The technique is defined by the generation of an anti-Stokes signal.")
    print("B. You can generate an anti Stokes beam, but it doesn't contain separate vibrational information: Incorrect. The entire purpose of B-CARS is that the anti-Stokes beam's spectrum contains information from multiple distinct vibrations.")
    print("C. You can generate an anti Stokes beam that contains distinguishable information: Correct. The spectrum of the anti-Stokes beam reveals the different vibrational frequencies present in the sample as distinguishable peaks or features.")
    print("E. You cannot generate an anti Stokes beam: Incorrect. An anti-Stokes beam is fundamentally generated by the CARS process.")
    print("\nBased on this analysis, statement C is the true description of broadband CARS microscopy.")
