    "To determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Knots:** First, we list all the prime knots with four or fewer crossings. These are the unknot (0_1), the trefoil knot (3_1), and the figure-eight knot (4_1). We also need to consider their mirror images, although the unknot and figure-eight knot are amphichiral (identical to their mirrors).\n\n2.  **Interpret \"Integral Surgery\":** The term \"integral surgery\" can mean surgery with any integer coefficient `n`. However, this interpretation would lead to an infinite number of distinct homology cobordism elements for any non-trivial knot. A more standard interpretation in many contexts, which leads to a finite and meaningful answer, is that \"integral surgery\" refers to surgery with coefficients `n = +1` or `n = -1`. This is because these specific surgeries produce *integral* homology spheres (manifolds whose integer homology groups are the same as the 3-sphere), which form a key subgroup of all rational homology spheres. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n3.  **Use Knot Invariants:** To distinguish the homology cobordism classes of the resulting manifolds, we can use invariants. A key result states that if a knot `K` is slice (bounds a smooth disk in the 4-ball), then `+/-1` surgery on it results in a manifold homology cobordant to the 3-sphere (the trivial element). For non-slice knots, a powerful invariant is the Ozsváth-Szabó `τ` (tau) invariant. The `d`-invariant (or correction term) of the resulting homology sphere, which determines its cobordism class, can be calculated from `τ`. Specifically, for `+/-1` surgery on a knot `K`, the `d`-invariant `δ` of the resulting manifold is given by:\n    *   `δ(S^3_{+1}(K)) = -2 * τ(K)`\n    *   `δ(S^3_{-1}(K)) = +2 * τ(K)`\n    Two manifolds with different `d`-invariants belong to different homology cobordism classes.\n\n4.  **Execute and Count:** We will apply this logic to each knot, calculate the `d`-invariants for the resulting manifolds from `+1` and `-1` surgeries (and for their mirrors), and count the total number of unique `d`-invariant values we find. This count will be our final answer.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_homology_cobordism_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of homology cobordism elements from integral (+/-1)\n    surgery on knots with at most 4 crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Knots with at most 4 crossings and their tau-invariants.\n    # The unknot (0_1) and figure-eight (4_1) are slice knots, with tau=0.\n    # The trefoil (3_1) is not slice.
