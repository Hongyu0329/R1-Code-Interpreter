    "This problem asks for the number of certain combinatorial structures (rooted forests) on a topological space (the Möbius band) with a specific property (non-collapsibility). This number can be determined using a result from algebraic combinatorics and topology.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical framework:** The question is about \"higher dimensional rooted forests\" on a simplicial complex and their \"simplicial collapse\". In the language of modern algebraic combinatorics, a forest that fails to collapse onto its root is often called \"non-acyclic\". A theorem by A. Engström provides a formula for the number of such non-acyclic rooted forests.\n2.  **State the theorem:** For a given simplicial complex `K` and a field `F`, the number of non-acyclic rooted forests is equal to the square of the sum of its Betti numbers over that field: `(Σ β_i(K, F))^2`.\n3.  **Determine the Betti numbers of the Möbius band:** The Betti numbers are topological invariants, meaning they do not depend on the specific triangulation of the space. We can find them by analyzing the homology groups of the Möbius band. The Möbius band is homotopy equivalent to a circle, `S^1`, which means they have the same homology groups and Betti numbers.\n4.  **Calculate the Betti numbers for a circle `S^1`:**\n    *   The 0-th Betti number, `β_0`, counts the number of connected components. For a circle, `β_0 = 1`.\n    *   The 1-st Betti number, `β_1`, counts the number of \"1-dimensional holes\". For a circle, `β_1 = 1`.\n    *   Higher Betti numbers, `β_i` for `i > 1`, are all zero.\n    *   These Betti numbers are the same regardless of the coefficient field used (like the rationals `Q` or reals `R`) because the integer homology groups of the circle are torsion-free.\n5.  **Sum the Betti numbers:** The sum is `β_0 + β_1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n6.  **Apply the formula:** Using the theorem, the number of non-collapsible rooted forests is `(sum of Betti numbers)^2 = 2^2 = 4`.\n7.  **Generate the code:** Write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final equation showing all the numbers involved.\n\n```python\n# The Betti numbers for the Möbius band (which has the homotopy type of a circle).\n# beta_0 is the number of connected components.\nbeta_0 = 1\n# beta_1 is the number of 1-dimensional holes.\nbeta_1 = 1\n\n# The sum of all Betti numbers (higher Betti numbers are zero).\nsum_of_betti_numbers = beta_0 + beta_1\n\n# The number of non-collapsible rooted forests is the square of the sum of the Betti numbers.\nresult = sum_of_betti_numbers**2\n\n# Print the final calculation, showing each number in the equation.\nprint(f\"The calculation is based on the Betti numbers of the Möbius band (β_0, β_1, ...).\")\nprint(f\"β_0 = {beta_0}\")\nprint(f\"β_1 = {beta_1}\")\nprint(f\"The number of non-collapsible forests is (β_0 + β_1)^2.\")\nprint(f\"So, the final equation is: ({beta_0} + {beta_1})^2 = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<4>>>"
