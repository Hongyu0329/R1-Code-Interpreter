    # Step 1: Define the known information based on the problem description.
    # The problem states that a customer's checkout took 10 minutes, and we are told
    # to assume this is the expected value for the checkout process.
    expected_checkout_time_any_customer = 10  # in minutes

    # Step 2: Explain the underlying principle.
    # The statement "the probability that a person completes the checkout process is constant per second"
    # implies that the checkout time follows a memoryless distribution (like the Exponential distribution).
    # For a memoryless process, each event is independent.
    print("The checkout process is memoryless, meaning each customer's checkout time is an independent event.")
    print(f"The expected checkout time for any customer is given as {expected_checkout_time_any_customer} minutes.")

    # Step 3: Apply the principle to the friend's situation.
    # Your friend's checkout is a new, independent trial from this same process.
    # Therefore, the expected time for your friend's checkout is the same as the general expected time.
    expected_time_for_friend = expected_checkout_time_any_customer

    # Step 4: Print the final conclusion and equation.
    print("\nSince your friend's checkout is a new, independent instance of this process,")
    print("its expected duration is the same as the average for any customer.")
    
    # The final equation as requested.
    # We output each number in the equation.
