    "To determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$ over the field of 2-adic numbers, we will analyze the geometry of its branch points.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Branch Points:** A hyperelliptic curve of the form $y^2 = f(x)$ where `deg(f) = 5` has genus `g=2`. The branch points are the 5 roots of $f(x)$ and the point at infinity. Let's label them $e_0, e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4$ and $e_\\infty$.\n2.  **Determine 2-adic Valuations:** We need to find the 2-adic valuations ($v_2$) of the roots and their pairwise differences. This gives us a notion of \"distance\" between the branch points.\n    *   The polynomial is $f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8)$. One root is $e_0 = 0$.\n    *   The other roots are from $g(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8 = 0$. Using Newton's polygon method, we find that its roots are:\n        *   One root, let's call it $e_1$, with $v_2(e_1) = 3$.\n        *   Three roots, $e_2, e_3, e_4$, with $v_2(e_2) = v_2(e_3) = v_2(e_4) = -1$.\n3.  **Calculate Pairwise Distances:** The \"distance\" between two branch points $e_i, e_j$ is defined as $d(e_i, e_j) = v_2(e_i - e_j)$. To handle the point at infinity, we perform a change of coordinates $x' = x-1$. The new roots are $e_i' = e_i-1$. The distance to infinity is then $d(e_i', e_\\infty) = -v_2(e_i')$. The valuations of the differences are:\n    *   $v_2(e_0' - e_1') = v_2(e_0 - e_1) = 3$.\n    *   $v_2(e_i' - e_j') \\le -1$ for all other pairs of finite roots.\n    *   $d(e_0', e_\\infty) = -v_2(-1) = 0$.\n    *   $d(e_1', e_\\infty) = -v_2(e_1-1) = 0$.\n    *   $d(e_i', e_\\infty) = -v_2(e_i-1) = -(-1) = 1$ for $i \\in \\{2,3,4\\}$.\n4.  **Construct the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST):** We create a graph where the vertices are the 6 branch points. The weight of an edge between two points is its distance. We build an MST of this graph by greedily adding edges with the highest weights.\n5.  **Count Components of Stable Reduction:** The irreducible components of the stable reduction correspond to the leaves and branch points (nodes of degree > 2) of the MST.\n6.  **Calculate Double Points:** The number of double points (nodes) in the stable reduction is the number of components minus 1, as the components form a tree structure.\n\nThe following Python code implements steps 4 to 6 to find the number of double points.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef find_double_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve\n    y^2 = 8*x^5 + 4*x^4 + 4*x^3 + x^2 + 8*x above 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define branch points and their pairwise distances.\n    # The branch points are e0, e1, e2, e3, e4, and e_inf.\n    # We computed the 2-adic valuations of their differences.\n    # Let's list all edges with non-negative weights (distances).\n    # All other pairs have negative distances.\n    edges = [\n        # (point1, point2, distance)\n        ('e0', 'e1', 3),\n        ('e2', 'e_inf', 1),\n        ('e3', 'e_inf', 1),\n        ('e4', 'e_inf', 1),\n        ('e0', 'e_inf', 0),\n        ('e1', 'e_inf', 0),\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The branch points are e0, e1, e2, e3, e4, e_inf.\")\n    print(\"Step 2 & 3: The 'distances' (2-adic valuations of differences) between branch points are computed.\")\n    print(\"The positive distances are:\")\n    print(\"d(e0, e1) = 3\")\n    print(\"d(e2, e_inf) = 1\")\n    print(\"d(e3, e_inf) = 1\")\n    print(\"d(e4, e_inf) = 1\")\n    print(\"d(e0, e_inf) = 0\")\n    print(\"d(e1, e_inf) = 0\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Construct the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) using these distances.\")\n\n    # Sort edges by distance in descending order\n    edges.sort(key=lambda item: item[2], reverse=True)\n    \n    # Kruskal's algorithm to find the MST\n    parent = {f'e{i}': f'e{i}' for i in range(5)}\n    parent['e_inf'] = 'e_inf'\n    \n    def find_set(v):\n        if v == parent[v]:\n            return v\n        parent[v] = find_set(parent[v])\n        return parent[v]\n\n    def unite_sets(a, b):\n        a = find_set(a)\n        b = find_set(b)\n        if a != b:\n            parent[b] = a\n            return True\n        return False\n\n    mst_edges = []\n    for u, v, weight in edges:\n        if find_set(u) != find_set(v):\n            unite_sets(u,v)\n            mst_edges.append((u, v))\n            if len(mst_edges) == 5: # 6 vertices, so 5 edges in MST\n                break\n    \n    print(\"The edges of the MST are:\")\n    for u, v in mst_edges:\n        print(f\"({u}, {v})\")\n\n    # Step 5: Find the number of components in the stable reduction.\n    # These correspond to leaves (degree 1) and branch points (degree > 2) in the MST.\n    degrees = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    for u, v in mst_edges:\n        degrees[u] += 1\n        degrees[v] += 1\n    \n    leaves = [node for node, deg in degrees.items() if deg == 1]\n    branch_points = [node for node, deg in degrees.items() if deg > 2]\n    \n    num_components = len(leaves) + len(branch_points)\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 5: The components of the stable reduction correspond to leaves and branch points of the MST.\")\n    print(f\"Leaves (degree 1 nodes) in MST: {leaves}\")\n    print(f\"Branch points (degree > 2 nodes) in MST: {branch_points}\")\n    print(f\"Total number of components = {len(leaves)} + {len(branch_points)} = {num_components}\")\n\n    # Step 6: The number of double points is the number of components - 1.\n    num_double_points = num_components - 1\n    print(f\"\\nStep 6: The number of double points is the number of components minus 1.\")\n    print(f\"Number of double points = {num_components} - 1 = {num_double_points}\")\n\n    return num_double_points\n\nresult = find_double_points()\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer: The number of double points is {result}.\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"
