    "This is a question from the mathematical field of point-set topology. My plan is to answer it by first providing the formal definitions for the key terms: \"continuum,\" \"indecomposable continuum,\" and \"composant.\" Then, I will state the central mathematical theorem that directly specifies the number of composants in such a space.\n\nSince this is a theoretical question, the provided Python code will not perform a calculation. Instead, it will print a clear explanation of the concepts and the theorem that leads to the final answer, fulfilling the requirement to use a code block and the `print` function.\n\n```python\ndef solve_topology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the reasoning and provides the answer to the question about\n    the smallest number of composants in an indecomposable continuum.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nTo determine the smallest number of composants in an indecomposable continuum, we refer to established theorems in point-set topology.\n\n**1. Definitions:**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected Hausdorff space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A proper subcontinuum is a closed, connected subset that is not the entire space.\n*   **Composant:** For a given point `p` in a continuum `X`, its composant is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain `p`. The composants of a continuum form a partition of the space (they are pairwise disjoint and their union is the whole space).\n\n**2. Key Theorem:**\n\nA foundational result concerning the structure of indecomposable continua is a theorem by the Polish mathematician Stefan Mazurkiewicz:\n\n**Theorem (Mazurkiewicz):** In any indecomposable continuum, the set of composants has cardinality **c**, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nThe value **c** is the size of the set of real numbers, also denoted as $2^{\\\\aleph_0}$.\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\n\nThis powerful theorem shows that for *any* indecomposable continuum, the number of composants is not just an arbitrary uncountable number, but is precisely **c**. It is not possible for such a continuum to have a finite or a countably infinite number of composants.\n\nTherefore, the smallest (and in fact, the only possible) number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is **c**.\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_topology_question()\n```\n<<<$c$ (the cardinality of the continuum)>>>"
