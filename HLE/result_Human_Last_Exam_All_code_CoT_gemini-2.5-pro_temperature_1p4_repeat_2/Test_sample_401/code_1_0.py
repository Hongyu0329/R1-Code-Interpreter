    explanation = """
To determine the smallest number of composants in an indecomposable continuum, we refer to established theorems in point-set topology.

**1. Definitions:**

*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected Hausdorff space.
*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A proper subcontinuum is a closed, connected subset that is not the entire space.
*   **Composant:** For a given point `p` in a continuum `X`, its composant is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain `p`. The composants of a continuum form a partition of the space (they are pairwise disjoint and their union is the whole space).

**2. Key Theorem:**

A foundational result concerning the structure of indecomposable continua is a theorem by the Polish mathematician Stefan Mazurkiewicz:

**Theorem (Mazurkiewicz):** In any indecomposable continuum, the set of composants has cardinality **c**, the cardinality of the continuum.

The value **c** is the size of the set of real numbers, also denoted as $2^{\\aleph_0}$.

**3. Conclusion:**

This powerful theorem shows that for *any* indecomposable continuum, the number of composants is not just an arbitrary uncountable number, but is precisely **c**. It is not possible for such a continuum to have a finite or a countably infinite number of composants.

Therefore, the smallest (and in fact, the only possible) number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is **c**.
