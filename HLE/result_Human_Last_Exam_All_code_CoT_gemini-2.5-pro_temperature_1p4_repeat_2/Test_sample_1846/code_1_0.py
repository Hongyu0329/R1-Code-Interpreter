# This script is designed to determine which patient population with Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
# experiences prolonged overall survival when treated with PD-1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy
# compared to chemotherapy alone.

# The conclusion is based on the results of major clinical trials like KEYNOTE-355.
# In the KEYNOTE-355 trial, the combination of pembrolizumab (a PD-1 inhibitor) and chemotherapy
# was compared to chemotherapy alone.

# Let's define the primary populations studied:
population_A = "Intention-to-treat population"
population_B = "PD-L1-positive population"
population_D = "PD-L1-negative population"

# The study found that the benefit in overall survival was statistically significant
# and clinically meaningful primarily in the PD-L1-positive population.
# For example, in patients with a Combined Positive Score (CPS, a measure of PD-L1 expression) >= 10,
# the median overall survival was 23.0 months with immunotherapy vs. 16.1 months with chemotherapy alone.
# The benefit was not statistically significant in the overall intention-to-treat population for survival.
