    "The task is to find the equilibrium expressions for the mean energy and entropy for a system of light quanta (photons). This is a classic problem in statistical mechanics for a Bose-Einstein gas where the number of particles is not conserved. The theoretical justification for the method used comes from large deviation theory.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Principle of Maximum Entropy**: The equilibrium state of the system corresponds to the macrostate with the largest number of possible microscopic arrangements (`W`). This is equivalent to maximizing the Boltzmann entropy `S = k * ln(W)`. The large deviation theorems by Boltzmann, Sanov, and others provide the formal mathematical foundation for this principle, showing that states with non-maximal entropy are exponentially less probable.\n2.  **System Definition (Bose Gas of Photons)**:\n    *   Particles are bosons (photons).\n    *   Let `n_i` be the number of photons in the `i`-th energy level, which has energy `ε_i` and `g_i` degenerate states.\n    *   The number of microstates `W` is given by the product of Bose-Einstein counting factors for each level: `W = Π_i [(n_i + g_i - 1)! / (n_i! * (g_i - 1)!)]`.\n    *   Using Stirling's approximation for `ln(W)`, the entropy `S/k` becomes `Σ_i [(n_i+g_i)ln(n_i+g_i) - n_i*ln(n_i) - g_i*ln(g_i)]`.\n3.  **Constraint**: For a system of photons (like black-body radiation), the total number of particles `N = Σ n_i` is not conserved. However, the total energy `E = Σ n_i * ε_i` is constant for an isolated system.\n4.  **Method of Lagrange Multipliers**: To find the distribution `{n_i}` that maximizes `S` subject to the constraint on `E`, we use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We maximize the function `L = S/k - β * E`, where `β` is the Lagrange multiplier.\n5.  **Derivation using Python**: The Python script below will use the symbolic mathematics library `sympy` to carry out the differentiation and solve for the equilibrium distribution `n_i`.\n6.  **Final Expressions**: Once the equilibrium distribution `n_i` is found, it will be substituted back into the formulas for total energy `E` and entropy `S` to find their equilibrium values.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_bose_einstein_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script derives the equilibrium values for mean energy and entropy\n    for a gas of light quanta (photons) using symbolic mathematics.\n\n    The physical principle, supported by large deviation theorems (like Boltzmann-Sanov),\n    is that the equilibrium state of an isolated system is the one that maximizes\n    entropy subject to physical constraints.\n\n    For a photon gas (Bose statistics):\n    1. Entropy (S): S = k * ln(W), where W is the number of microstates.\n       Using Stirling's approximation, S/k becomes a sum over energy levels 'i'.\n    2. Constraint: The total energy E = Σ (n_i * ε_i) is constant.\n    3. Non-Constraint: The number of photons N = Σ n_i is NOT conserved.\n\n    We use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize S subject to the energy constraint.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Derivation of the Equilibrium Distribution ---\")\n    print(\"We maximize the function L = S/k - β * E, where β is a Lagrange multiplier.\")\n    print(\"This is equivalent to solving ∂(S/k - βE)/∂n_i = 0 for each energy level i.\")\n\n    # Define symbolic variables using sympy\n    # Using English names for variables for broader compatibility\n    n, g, epsilon, beta = sympy.symbols('n_i g_i epsilon_i beta', real=True, positive=True)\n\n    # Entropy term for a single energy level 'i' (S_i / k)\n    # Using the approximation for large numbers: ln(W_i) ≈ (n+g)ln(n+g) - n*ln(n) - g*ln(g)\n    log_W_i = (n + g) * sympy.log(n + g) - n * sympy.log(n) - g * sympy.log(g)\n\n    # Lagrangian for a single level 'i'\n    Lagrangian_i = log_W_i - beta * n * epsilon\n    \n    # Use pretty symbols for printing\n    n_sym, g_sym, e_sym, b_sym = sympy.symbols('n_i g_i ε_i β')\n    lag_print = ((n_sym + g_sym) * sympy.log(n_sym + g_sym) - n_sym * sympy.log(n_sym) - g_sym * sympy.log(g_sym)) - b_sym*n_sym*e_sym\n\n\n    print(\"\\nThe Lagrangian term for a single energy level 'i' is:\")\n    print(f\"L_i = S_i/k - β*n_i*ε_i = {sympy.pretty(lag_print, use_unicode=True)}\")\n\n    # Differentiate with respect to n\n    dL_dn = sympy.diff(Lagrangian_i, n)\n    dL_dn_print = sympy.diff(lag_print, n_sym)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nDifferentiating with respect to n_i and setting to 0:\")\n    print(f\"∂L_i/∂n_i = {sympy.pretty(dL_dn_print, use_unicode=True)} = 0\")\n\n    # Solve the equation dL/dn = 0 for n\n    equilibrium_eq = sympy.Eq(dL_dn, 0)\n    solution = sympy.solve(equilibrium_eq, n)\n    n_equilibrium = solution[0]\n\n    print(\"\\nSolving for n_i gives the equilibrium occupation number (Bose-Einstein distribution):\")\n    # Using f-string to insert numbers like '1' explicitly\n    final_dist_str = f\"n_i = g_i / (exp(β*ε_i) - 1)\"\n    print(final_dist_str)\n    print(\"where g_i is the number of states at energy level ε_i, and the Lagrange multiplier β is related to temperature T by β = 1/(k*T).\")\n    print(\"The average occupation per state is <n_i> = n_i/g_i.\")\n\n\n    print(\"\\n\\n--- Equilibrium Mean Energy (E_eq) ---\")\n    print(\"The mean energy of the system is found by summing the energy of all occupied states using the equilibrium distribution:\")\n    # Again using f-string to ensure numbers are present\n    energy_eq_str = \"E_eq = Σ_i [ n_i * ε_i ] = Σ_i [ g_i * ε_i / (exp(β*ε_i) - 1) ]\"\n    print(energy_eq_str)\n\n\n    print(\"\\n\\n--- Equilibrium Entropy (S_eq) ---\")\n    print(\"The equilibrium entropy is found by substituting the equilibrium distribution n_i back into the entropy formula.\")\n    print(\"This yields the following expression, expressed in terms of the average occupation number <n_i> = n_i/g_i:\")\n    entropy_eq_str = \"S_eq = k * Σ_i g_i * [ (1 + <n_i>) * ln(1 + <n_i>) - <n_i> * ln(<n_i>) ]\"\n    print(entropy_eq_str)\n\n    print(\"\\nAn alternative (and equivalent) expression is derived from the thermodynamic relation S = (E - A)/T, where A is the Helmholtz free energy:\")\n    entropy_alt_str = \"S_eq = k * [ β*E_eq - Σ_i g_i * ln(1 - exp(-β*ε_i)) ]\"\n    print(entropy_alt_str)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_bose_einstein_equilibrium()\n```\n<<<E_eq = Σ_i [ g_i * ε_i / (exp(β*ε_i) - 1) ], S_eq = k * Σ_i g_i * [ (1 + <n_i>) * ln(1 + <n_i>) - <n_i> * ln(<n_i>) ]>>>"
