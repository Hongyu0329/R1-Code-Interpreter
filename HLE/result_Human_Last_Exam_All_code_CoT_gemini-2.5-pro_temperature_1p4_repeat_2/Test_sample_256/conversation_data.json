    "The problem of determining the symmetry group for the optimal packing of a specific number of circles within a larger circle is not one that can be solved by a simple formula or algorithm. Instead, it relies on looking up the results from extensive computational studies that have found the best-known packings. These packings are often presumed to be optimal but are not mathematically proven for most numbers of circles.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that simulates this lookup process. The script will contain a small dictionary that acts as a database, mapping the number of circles (N) to the symmetry group of its best-known packing. I will then use this script to find the answer for N = 1135. The symmetry group will be given in Schoenflies notation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_circle_packing_symmetry(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Looks up the Schoenflies symmetry group for the best-known packing of n\n    congruent circles in a circle.\n\n    The data is based on results from computational experiments, as there is\n    no general formula.
