# Plan: To illustrate the dimensional difference between Type-2 and Type-3 fuzzy sets,
# we will focus on the number of variables in the domain of their respective membership functions (MFs).
# This increase in variables allows for a more complex, higher-dimensional model of uncertainty.

# A Type-2 MF models uncertainty about a primary membership grade. It is a function of two variables:
# 1. The primary variable from the universe of discourse (x).
# 2. The primary membership grade itself (u).
# The function, mu(x, u), defines a 3D surface. The uncertainty it models is represented
# by a 2D "Footprint of Uncertainty" (FOU).
t2_domain_variables = 2

# A Type-3 MF models uncertainty about the Type-2 membership grades. It adds another layer of fuzziness.
# This requires adding a third variable to the domain:
# 1. The primary variable (x).
# 2. The primary membership grade (u).
# 3. The secondary membership grade (v).
# The function, mu(x, u, v), defines a 4D structure. This addition enables the modeling of
# uncertainty in three dimensions, making the FOU itself fuzzy.
t3_domain_variables = 3

# The fundamental difference is the addition of one more variable to the domain,
# which corresponds to adding a new dimension to the uncertainty model.
added_dimensions = t3_domain_variables - t2_domain_variables

# Let's present this dimensional addition as a simple equation.
# This demonstrates the structural expansion from Type-2 to Type-3.
print("The fundamental dimensional shift from a Type-2 to a Type-3 fuzzy membership function can be understood by the change in the domain's dimensionality.")
print("\nType-2 MF Domain Variables: Defines a 2D uncertainty model (Footprint of Uncertainty).")
print("Type-3 MF Domain Variables: Defines a 3D uncertainty model (Fuzzy Footprint of Uncertainty).")
print("\nThis structural evolution can be expressed as an equation:")

print(f"{t2_domain_variables} (Type-2 vars) + {added_dimensions} (added uncertainty dimension) = {t3_domain_variables} (Type-3 vars)")

# The addition of this third dimension to model uncertainty is the key structural difference.
# This directly corresponds to the concept of adding "three-dimensional uncertainty modeling".
