    Calculates the maximal k based on the dimension d.

    The problem asks for the maximal k such that, for any choice of k d-dimensional
    probability measures (with mean 0 and genuinely d-dimensional support),
    it is not possible to guarantee that a controlled random walk returns to the origin.

    This translates to finding the maximal k such that for any choice of k measures,
    all control strategies result in a transient walk.

    The condition for the existence of a recurrent strategy is that the conic hull
    of the inverse covariance matrices spans the entire cone of positive semi-definite
    d x d matrices. The space of symmetric d x d matrices has dimension N = d*(d+1)/2.
    If k < N, the matrices cannot span this space, so no recurrent strategy can exist.
    The maximal k is therefore N - 1.
