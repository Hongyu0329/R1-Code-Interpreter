    "My plan to solve this problem is to follow these steps:\n1.  Identify the appropriate group presentation for the fundamental group of the complement of the 5-twist-spun trefoil knot in the 4-sphere, $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\Sigma)$.\n2.  Use a standard result from knot theory to derive the presentation of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over this surface, $\\pi_1(M)$.\n3.  Simplify the resulting group presentation algebraically to identify the group.\n4.  Determine the minimal number of generators for this simplified group.\n\n**Step 1: Fundamental Group of the Knot Complement**\nThe trefoil knot ($3_1$) is a 2-bridge knot, and its group, $\\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus 3_1)$, has a standard presentation from braid theory:\n$G = \\langle x, y \\mid xyx = yxy \\rangle$.\nHere, $x$ and $y$ are generators corresponding to the two braids and can both be considered meridians of the knot.\n\nFor an $m$-twist-spun knot, the fundamental group of its complement in $S^4$ is constructed from the original knot group $G$. For the 5-twist-spun trefoil, we have $m=5$. The group $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\Sigma)$ is given by taking the generators of $G$ and adding a new generator $t$ that is central and satisfies $t = \\mu^m$, where $\\mu$ is a meridian.\nChoosing $\\mu=x$, we get the presentation:\n$\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\Sigma) = \\langle x, y, t \\mid xyx = yxy, xt=tx, yt=ty, x^5=t \\rangle$.\nWe can substitute $t=x^5$. The relation $xt=tx$ becomes trivial, and $yt=ty$ becomes $yx^5 = x^5y$.\nSo, $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\Sigma) = \\langle x, y \\mid xyx = yxy, yx^5 = x^5y \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Fundamental Group of the Double Branched Cover**\nThe fundamental group of the double branched cover, $\\pi_1(M)$, is obtained by taking the group of the complement and adding relations that the squares of the meridians are equal to the identity. Since both $x$ and $y$ are meridians, we add the relations $x^2 = 1$ and $y^2 = 1$.\nThe presentation for $\\pi_1(M)$ is:\n$\\pi_1(M) = \\langle x, y \\mid xyx = yxy, yx^5 = x^5y, x^2 = 1, y^2 = 1 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3 & 4: Simplify the Presentation and Find Minimal Generators**\nI will now write a Python script to carry out the simplification of this group presentation and find the minimal number of generators. The script will print out each step of the algebraic simplification.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the step-by-step simplification of the group presentation\n    for the fundamental group of the double branched cover of S^4 over the 5-twist-spun trefoil.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The starting presentation of the fundamental group is:\")\n    print(\"pi_1(M) = <x, y | xyx = yxy, yx^5 = x^5y, x^2 = 1, y^2 = 1>\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Simplify the term x^5 using the relation x^2 = 1.\")\n    print(\"Since x^2 = 1, any even power of x is 1. We can write x^5 as:\")\n    print(\"x^5 = x^(2*2 + 1) = (x^2)^2 * x\")\n    print(\"Substituting x^2 = 1, we get: 1^2 * x = x.\")\n    print(\"So, the term x^5 simplifies to x.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Substitute x^5 = x into the relation yx^5 = x^5y.\")\n    print(\"The relation 'yx^5 = x^5y' becomes 'yx = xy'.\")\n    print(\"This means the generators commute, making the group abelian with respect to these generators.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Simplify the first relation 'xyx = yxy' using the commutativity 'xy = yx'.\")\n    print(\"Left-hand side (LHS): xyx = x(yx) = x(xy) = (x*x)y = x^2 * y.\")\n    print(\"Right-hand side (RHS): yxy = y(xy) = y(yx) = (y*y)x = y^2 * x.\")\n    print(\"So, the relation 'xyx = yxy' simplifies to 'x^2 * y = y^2 * x'.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Use the relations x^2 = 1 and y^2 = 1 in the simplified relation from Step 3.\")\n    print(\"The relation 'x^2 * y = y^2 * x' becomes '1 * y = 1 * x'.\")\n    print(\"This simplifies to 'y = x'.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 5: Reduce the entire group presentation using 'y = x'.\")\n    print(\"The group is generated by a single generator <x>.\")\n    print(\"The relations become:\")\n    print(\"  1. xyx = yxy  =>  xxx = xxx  =>  x^3 = x^3 (trivial)\")\n    print(\"  2. yx = xy    =>  xx = xx    =>  x^2 = x^2 (trivial)\")\n    print(\"  3. x^2 = 1\")\n    print(\"  4. y^2 = 1    =>  x^2 = 1 (redundant)\")\n    print(\"All relations collapse to the single, non-trivial relation 'x^2 = 1'.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 6: Final group identification and minimal number of generators.\")\n    print(\"The final presentation is <x | x^2 = 1>.\")\n    print(\"This is the cyclic group of order 2, Z_2.\")\n    print(\"A cyclic group of order 2 is generated by one element.\")\n    min_generators = 1\n    print(f\"\\nThe minimal number of generators is: {min_generators}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
