    "To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link, we first need to determine its weighted degree, `d`. A polynomial is quasi-homogeneous if all its monomials have the same weighted degree. We will calculate the degree of each monomial using the provided weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75) for the variables (z₁, z₂, z₃, z₄, z₅).\n\n1.  `z₁⁸z₃`: degree = 8 * 22 + 1 * 49 = 176 + 49 = 225\n2.  `z₁⁴z₂³z₃`: degree = 4 * 22 + 3 * 29 + 1 * 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224\n3.  `z₁z₂⁷`: degree = 1 * 22 + 7 * 29 = 22 + 203 = 225\n4.  `z₁z₂z₃z₄z₅`: degree = 1 * 22 + 1 * 29 + 1 * 49 + 1 * 50 + 1 * 75 = 225\n5.  `z₂z₃⁴`: degree = 1 * 29 + 4 * 49 = 29 + 196 = 225\n6.  `z₄³z₅`: degree = 3 * 50 + 1 * 75 = 150 + 75 = 225\n7.  `z₅³`: degree = 3 * 75 = 225\n\nAlmost all monomials have a weighted degree of 225. The single monomial with degree 224 is likely a typo in the polynomial representation, as the link is stated to be Calabi-Yau, which requires the defining polynomial to be quasi-homogeneous. Therefore, we will proceed with the weighted degree `d = 225`.\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant is calculated using the formula:\n`Invariant = d - Σwᵢ`\n\nWe will now calculate this value using a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordstrom invariant for a Calabi-Yau link.\n    \n    The invariant is defined as d - sum(w_i), where d is the weighted\n    degree of the polynomial and w_i are the weights of the ambient space.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Weights for the variables (z1, z2, z3, z4, z5)\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n    \n    # The weighted degree 'd' of the quasi-homogeneous polynomial.\n    # As determined by analyzing the monomials, the consistent degree is 225.\n    degree = 225\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the weights\n    sum_of_weights = sum(weights)\n    \n    # Calculate the invariant\n    invariant = degree - sum_of_weights\n    \n    # Construct the weight sum string for the final equation\n    weights_str = \" + \".join(map(str, weights))\n    \n    print(\"The Crawley-Nordström invariant is calculated as the degree (d) minus the sum of the weights (Σwᵢ).\")\n    print(f\"For the given link:\")\n    print(f\"Degree (d) = {degree}\")\n    print(f\"Weights (wᵢ) = {weights}\")\n    print(f\"The calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{degree} - ({weights_str}) = {invariant}\")\n    \n    # Final answer in the specified format\n    print(f\"\\n<<<The final answer is {invariant}>>>\")\n\ncalculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
