    "To find the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms up to isomorphism, we'll follow a systematic approach.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the basic structure**: A category requires objects, morphisms, identity morphisms for each object, and an associative composition law. We have 2 objects, let's call them `A` and `B`, and a total of 4 morphisms.\n2.  **Account for identity morphisms**: Every category must have an identity morphism `id_X` for each object `X`. So, we must have `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`. These are two of the four morphisms.\n3.  **Distribute the remaining morphisms**: We have 2 non-identity morphisms left to distribute among the four possible `Hom`-sets: `Hom(A,A)`, `Hom(A,B)`, `Hom(B,A)`, and `Hom(B,B)`. Let `n_XY = |Hom(X,Y)|`. The problem is equivalent to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to `(n_AA - 1) + n_AB + n_BA + (n_BB - 1) = 2`.\n4.  **Enumerate distributions**: We will list all possible distributions `(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB)`.\n5.  **Group by isomorphism**: A category with distribution `(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB)` is isomorphic to one with `(n_BB, n_BA, n_AB, n_AA)` by simply swapping the labels of the objects `A` and `B`. We will group the distributions into isomorphism classes.\n6.  **Analyze each case**: For each isomorphism class of distributions, we determine how many non-isomorphic composition structures can be defined that satisfy the category axioms (primarily associativity). This involves analyzing possible monoid structures on `Hom(A,A)` and `Hom(B,B)` and checking the consistency of compositions between different `Hom`-sets.\n7.  **Sum the results**: The total number is the sum of the counts from each distinct case.\n\nThe following Python script will execute this plan by printing the step-by-step analysis.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script details the step-by-step derivation of the number of \n    non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"### Analysis of Categories with 2 Objects and 4 Morphisms ###\")\n    print(\"\\nLet the two objects be A and B.\")\n    print(\"A category must have an identity morphism for each object.\")\n    print(\"So, we have id_A in Hom(A,A) and id_B in Hom(B,B).\")\n    print(\"This accounts for 2 of the 4 morphisms.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nWe have 2 non-identity morphisms to distribute among the four Hom-sets:\")\n    print(\"Hom(A,A), Hom(A,B), Hom(B,A), and Hom(B,B).\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nLet n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB be the number of morphisms in these sets.\")\n    print(\"We have n_AA >= 1, n_BB >= 1, and n_AA + n_AB + n_BA + n_BB = 4.\")\n    print(\"This leads to 10 possible distributions of morphisms:\")\n    \n    distributions = [\n        (3, 0, 0, 1), (1, 0, 0, 3),\n        (1, 2, 0, 1), (1, 0, 2, 1),\n        (2, 1, 0, 1), (1, 0, 1, 2),\n        (2, 0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 0, 2),\n        (2, 0, 0, 2),\n        (1, 1, 1, 1)\n    ]\n    # print(f\"Distributions: {distributions}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThese 10 distributions can be grouped into 6 classes up to isomorphism (by swapping objects A and B):\")\n    print(\"1. {(3, 0, 0, 1), (1, 0, 0, 3)}\")\n    print(\"2. {(1, 2, 0, 1), (1, 0, 2, 1)}\")\n    print(\"3. {(2, 1, 0, 1), (1, 0, 1, 2)}\")\n    print(\"4. {(2, 0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 0, 2)}\")\n    print(\"5. {(2, 0, 0, 2)} (symmetric)\")\n    print(\"6. {(1, 1, 1, 1)} (symmetric)\")\n    \n    counts = []\n\n    # Case 1: (3,0,0,1)\n    case1_count = 5\n    counts.append(case1_count)\n    print(f\"\\nCase 1: (3,0,0,1).
