print("\nStep 1: The code will not compile.")
print("The primary reason is a violation of Rust's borrowing rules, which guarantees memory safety at compile time.")

print("\nStep 2: Identifying the source of the error.")
print("The error is located in the `FeedForward::backward` method. The following line attempts to read from and write to the same matrix `self.w2` in a way that the borrow checker disallows:")
print("\n  self.w2.set(j, k, self.w2.get(j, k) - ...);\n")

print("Step 3: Explaining the borrow checker violation.")
print("The `Matrix::set` method requires a mutable borrow of the matrix (`&mut self.w2`) to modify it.")
print("To calculate the new value for the `set` method, the code calls `self.w2.get(j, k)`, which requires an immutable borrow (`&self.w2`).")
print("Rust's core rule: You cannot have a mutable borrow of a variable at the same time as an immutable borrow.")
print("This line violates that rule by attempting to create both types of borrows on `self.w2` simultaneously. The compiler will stop and report a fatal error.")
print("The same error pattern exists for the update of `self.w1`.")


print("\nStep 4: Considering compiler warnings.")
print("The provided code also includes functions `exp` and `ln` that are defined but never used.")
print("A standard Rust compilation would produce warnings for this kind of 'dead code'.")

print("This makes choice C the most accurate description of the outcome.")

print("\nFinal Answer Selection:")
