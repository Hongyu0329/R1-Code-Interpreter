def solve_frostman_decay():
    """
    Calculates the smallest possible value of c based on the provided problem parameters.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible value of c, where c is related to the decay
    rate of the Fourier transform of a Frostman measure on a circle. The value of c
    depends on the dimension of the space (n) and the dimension of the measure (alpha).

    The argument is as follows:
    1.  The squared L^2 norm of the restricted Fourier transform, let's call it A(r),
        is known to decay like r^(-d), where d = (n-1)/2. This holds if d < alpha,
        where alpha is the dimension of the Frostman measure.
    2.  The problem states this squared norm is O(r^(2c+epsilon)).
    3.  Comparing the exponents, we get the inequality 2c >= -d, so c >= -d/2.
    4.  This bound is sharp (the smallest possible value) because there exist measures
        that achieve this decay rate.
    5.  The final formula for the minimal c is c = -d/2 = -(n-1)/4.
