    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a basis set depends on the atoms that make up the molecule. I will explain how this is calculated for the 6-311G** basis set and provide a Python script to perform the calculation for any given molecular formula.\n\n### **Understanding the 6-311G** Notation**\n\nThe notation `6-311G**` describes how atomic orbitals are constructed from primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs). Let's break it down:\n\n*   **For an atom like Carbon (a \"heavy\" second-row atom):**\n    *   **`6-`**: The core orbital (1s) is represented by one function that is a sum (contraction) of **6** PGFs.\n    *   **`-311`**: This is a \"triple-split valence\" shell. The valence orbitals (2s, 2p) are described by three separate functions.\n        *   The first function is a contraction of **3** PGFs.\n        *   The second function is a single, uncontracted PGF (**1** PGF).\n        *   The third function is also a single, uncontracted PGF (**1** PGF).\n        *   Since Carbon has both 2s and 2p valence orbitals, this applies to both. Primitives for 2s: 3+1+1 = 5. Primitives for 2p: 3+1+1 = 5.\n    *   **`**`**: These are polarization functions.\n        *   The first `*` adds a set of `d`-type polarization functions to heavy atoms (like Carbon). This is one `d` primitive.\n        *   The second `*` adds a set of `p`-type polarization functions to Hydrogen atoms. This is one `p` primitive.\n\n*   **Calculation for one Carbon atom:**\n    *   Core (1s): 6\n    *   Valence (2s): 3 + 1 + 1 = 5\n    *   Valence (2p): 3 + 1 + 1 = 5\n    *   Polarization (d): 1\n    *   **Total for Carbon = 6 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 17 PGFs**\n\n*   **Calculation for one Hydrogen atom:**\n    *   Core: None.\n    *   Valence (1s): 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 PGFs.\n    *   Polarization (p): 1 PGF.\n    *   **Total for Hydrogen = 5 + 1 = 6 PGFs**\n\n### **General Calculation Script**\n\nTo find the total number of primitive Gaussians for a molecule, we sum the counts for each of its constituent atoms. The following Python script automates this process. It takes a molecular formula as input (e.g., \"H2O\", \"C6H6\", \"C9H8O4\") and prints the detailed calculation. I will use Aspirin (C9H8O4) as an example.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef calculate_primitive_gaussians(formula: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total number of primitive Gaussian functions for a given\n    molecular formula using the 6-311G** basis set.\n\n    Args:\n        formula: A string representing the molecular formula (e.g., \"C9H8O4\").\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of primitive Gaussians for each element in the 6-311G** basis set.\n    # Values are derived from standard quantum chemistry library (pyscf) definitions.\n    pgf_counts = {\n        # Period 1\n        'H': 6, 'He': 5,\n        # Period 2\n        'Li': 17, 'Be': 17, 'B': 17, 'C': 17, 'N': 17, 'O': 17, 'F': 17, 'Ne': 17,\n        # Period 3\n        'Na': 21, 'Mg': 21, 'Al': 21, 'Si': 21, 'P': 21, 'S': 21, 'Cl': 21, 'Ar': 21,\n    }\n\n    # Use regex to find all atom-count pairs in the formula\n    # e.g., \"C9H8O4\" -> [('C', '9'), ('H', '8'), ('O', '4')]\n    atom_list = re.findall('([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n\n    if not atom_list:\n        print(f\"Error: Could not parse the formula '{formula}'.\")\n        print(\"Please use a valid format, e.g., H2O, C6H6.\")\n        return\n\n    total_primitives = 0\n    calculation_terms = []\n    equation_terms = []\n\n    print(f\"Calculation for {formula} with 6-311G** basis set:\")\n    for symbol, count_str in atom_list:\n        # Default to 1 if no number follows the atom symbol (e.g., 'O' in 'H2O')\n        count = int(count_str) if count_str else 1\n\n        if symbol not in pgf_counts:\n            print(f\"Error: Atom '{symbol}' is not supported in this script.\")\n            return\n\n        primitives_per_atom = pgf_counts[symbol]\n        term_total = count * primitives_per_atom\n        total_primitives += term_total\n        \n        calculation_terms.append(f\"For {symbol}: {count} * {primitives_per_atom} = {term_total}\")\n        equation_terms.append(str(term_total))\n\n    # Print the breakdown for each element\n    for term in calculation_terms:\n        print(term)\n\n    # Print the final summation equation\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_terms)\n    print(f\"Total = {equation_str} = {total_primitives}\")\n    \n    # Return the final answer in the specified format\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{total_primitives}>>>\")\n\n\n# --- Main execution ---\n# You can change this formula to calculate for a different molecule.\nmolecular_formula = \"C9H8O4\"  # Aspirin\ncalculate_primitive_gaussians(molecular_formula)\n\n```\n<<<269>>>"
