    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of binary operations on a set of 3 elements that satisfy both the commutative and associative properties. We can do this computationally by checking every possible commutative operation for associativity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Represent the operation**: A binary operation on a set of `n` elements (we'll use `n=3`) can be represented by an `n x n` multiplication table, often called a Cayley table. Let the set be S = {0, 1, 2}.\n\n2.  **Handle Commutativity**: The commutative property (`x * y = y * x`) means the Cayley table must be symmetric about its main diagonal. This significantly reduces the number of operations we need to check. Instead of `n*n = 9` entries to define, we only need to define the entries on and above the main diagonal. For `n=3`, this is `n*(n+1)/2 = 3*(3+1)/2 = 6` entries.\n\n3.  **Count Commutative Operations**: Since each of these 6 entries can be any of the 3 elements in S, the total number of distinct commutative operations is `3^6 = 729`.\n\n4.  **Handle Associativity**: The associative property (`(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)`) must hold for all `x, y, z` in the set S.\n\n5.  **Brute-force Search**: The most straightforward approach is to write a script that:\n    a. Generates each of the 729 possible commutative operations.\n    b. For each operation, checks if it is associative by testing the condition `(x*y)*z = x*(y*z)` for all `3*3*3 = 27` possible combinations of `x, y, z`.\n    c. Counts how many of the 729 operations satisfy the associativity test.\n\n6.  **Output the result**: The final count from the script will be the answer. The script will also print the intermediate numbers used in the calculation, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_associative_commutative_operations():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of binary operations on a set of n=3\n    elements that are both associative and commutative.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
