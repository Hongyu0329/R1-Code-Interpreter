    # The problem asks for the order type of X, the set of possible cofinalities
    # of the cardinality of the power set of the natural numbers (2^omega).

    # The given conditions are:
    # 1. 2^omega > aleph_1 (Continuum Hypothesis fails)
    # 2. 2^omega < aleph_{omega_{omega+5}} (Upper bound)
    # 3. 2^omega is a singular cardinal (i.e., cf(2^omega) < 2^omega)

    # Let lambda be a possible cofinality in X.
    # From KÃ¶nig's Theorem, we know cf(2^omega) > omega. So, lambda is an uncountable cardinal.
    # The cofinality of any cardinal is always a regular cardinal. So, lambda is a regular cardinal.
    # From the problem's conditions, lambda = cf(2^omega) < 2^omega < aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}.
    
    # Therefore, X is the set of all uncountable regular cardinals less than aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}.
    
    # The order type of this set of cardinals is the order type of the set of their ordinal indices.
    # Let this set of indices be I.
    # I = {alpha | 0 < alpha < omega_{omega+5} and aleph_alpha is a regular cardinal}
    
    # For an ordinal alpha > 0, aleph_alpha is regular if and only if alpha is a regular ordinal.
    # So, we need the order type of the set of regular ordinals less than omega_{omega_{omega+5}}.
    
    # A key theorem in set theory states: For any regular cardinal Lambda, the set of regular
    # ordinals less than Lambda has order type Lambda.
    
    # We must check if Lambda = omega_{omega+5} is a regular cardinal.
    # An initial ordinal omega_beta is regular if its index beta is a successor ordinal.
    # The index here is omega + 5.
    
    number_in_index = 5
    
    # The ordinal "omega + 5" is a successor ordinal (its predecessor is omega + 4).
    # Therefore, omega_{omega+5} is a regular cardinal.
    
    # Applying the theorem, the order type of the set of regular ordinals less than
    # omega_{omega+5} is omega_{omega+5} itself.
    
    # This is the order type of X.
