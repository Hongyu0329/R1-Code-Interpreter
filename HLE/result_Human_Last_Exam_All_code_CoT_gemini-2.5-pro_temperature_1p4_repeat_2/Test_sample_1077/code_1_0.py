    The letter, written on August 20, 1921, expresses deep disappointment
    after a visit to Heidegger. The author, a student of Heidegger's, felt a
    disconnect between the profound thinker behind 'Being and Time' and the man himself.
    This correspondence is a well-documented piece of 20th-century intellectual history.
