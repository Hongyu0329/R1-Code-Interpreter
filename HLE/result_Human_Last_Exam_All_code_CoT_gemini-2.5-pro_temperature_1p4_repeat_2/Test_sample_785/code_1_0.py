    Calculates the number of orbits by solving an equivalent integer partition problem.

    The problem is to find the number of orbits of a group action on a set of matrix tuples.
    This can be mapped to a representation theory problem. The steps are:
    1. The relations on the matrices define a group G, which is identified as the symmetric group S5.
    2. The orbits of the action correspond to the non-isomorphic 1000-dimensional complex representations of S5.
    3. Any such representation is a direct sum of irreducible representations (irreps).
    4. The problem reduces to finding the number of ways to make a sum of 1000 using the dimensions of S5's irreps.
