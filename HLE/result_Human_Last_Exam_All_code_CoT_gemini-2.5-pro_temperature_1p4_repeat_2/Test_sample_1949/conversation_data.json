    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid:\n\n1.  **Identify Rivers:** I will first compile a list of real-world rivers that are mentioned in the Aeneid. This includes major rivers like the Nile and Tiber, as well as others that appear in various contexts throughout the epic.\n2.  **Find River Lengths:** I will find the approximate modern lengths (in kilometers) for each of these identified rivers.\n3.  **Sort and Select:** Using a Python script, I will store these rivers and their lengths, sort them from longest to shortest, and select the top three.\n4.  **Display the Result:** The script will then print the names and lengths of the three longest rivers.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_rivers_in_aeneid():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid,\n    sorts them by length, and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of prominent rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their approximate lengths in km.\n    # Sources for mentions include discussions of geography, omens, and battle scenes.\n    rivers = {\n        'Nile': 6650,\n        'Danube': 2850,\n        'Euphrates': 2800,\n        'Tigris': 1900,\n        'Rhine': 1233,\n        'Po': 652,\n        'Hebrus': 480,\n        'Tiber': 406\n    }\n\n    # Sort the rivers by length in descending order.\n    # The sorted() function returns a list of tuples (key, value) from the dictionary items.\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three rivers from the sorted list.\n    top_three = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    # Loop through the top three and print their names and lengths.\n    for i, (river, length) in enumerate(top_three):\n        # We present this as an \"equation\" showing the river name and its length.\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {river} = {length} km\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_longest_rivers_in_aeneid()\n```\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Nile, the Danube, and the Euphrates.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
