    This function prints the answers to the two-part question.

    Part A: Is every boopable function Turing-computable?
    Answer: Yes. The machine model described is Turing-complete. The instruction set allows for universal computation (arithmetic, universal logic gates via BITWISENAND, and conditional branching), and the problem statement guarantees sufficient memory, register space, and word size (R,A,W >= N) to compute any given function without being limited by finite hardware resources, which is analogous to a Turing machine's infinite tape. Thus, the set of boopable functions is equivalent to the set of Turing-computable functions.

    Part B: Does there exist a program L of length <= 2^32+50 such that, for all x in [0, 2^32), L on (R,A,W)=(64,64,512) maps x to x and halts in <= x+50 many steps?
    Answer: No. The strict time limit of x+50 steps implies that the program must perform a very fast setup (under 50 steps) and then execute x BOOP instructions, each taking one step. This requires a jump to a specific starting address calculated from x. Since the instruction set lacks an indirect jump, this must be accomplished with self-modifying code by constructing a BRANCH instruction with the calculated address. This construction requires bit-shifting the calculated address to place it correctly within the instruction word. Without a SHIFT instruction, a 64-bit shift must be simulated with 64 ADD instructions, which takes at least 64 steps. This operation alone exceeds the setup time budget of < 50 steps. Therefore, such a program cannot exist.
