    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this task.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the technical characteristics of the reverse turn in each of the listed ballroom dances. The key part of the question is the phrase \"impossible to overturn... without disregarding the technique.\" This implies that for one specific dance, the act of overturning a turn isn't just a mistake in quantity (like turning too much), but a fundamental violation of how movement in that dance is supposed to be executed.\n\n1.  **Analyze Swing vs. Tango:** I will group the dances. The Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep are all \"swing\" dances, characterized by continuous, flowing movement and momentum. The European Tango is distinct, characterized by staccato action, no \"swing,\" and sharp, precise movements.\n2.  **Evaluate Overturning in Swing Dances:** In swing dances, the body is already in continuous rotation. Overturning a figure is a common error where a dancer allows momentum to carry them too far. While this is a significant technical flaw, it's an exaggeration of the existing rotational mechanic.\n3.  **Evaluate Overturning in Tango:** In Tango, turns are not executed with a continuous, swinging rotation. They are sharp and clipped. A Reverse Turn in Tango is a specific, staccato action. To \"overturn\" it, a dancer would have to introduce a continuous, flowing rotation, which fundamentally contradicts the core technique of the dance. It's not just doing the move wrong; it's doing a completely different type of action.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on this, the European Tango is the dance where overturning a reverse turn is conceptually impossible without completely abandoning its characteristic technique.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script to symbolically represent this logic. The script will define the dances and their technical properties, identify the correct answer based on the logic, and then print a final \"equation\" that summarizes the conclusion, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_technique_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the technical characteristics of ballroom dances\n    to determine in which one overturning a reverse turn is fundamentally\n    against the technique.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the options and their core movement principles regarding rotation.\n    dance_characteristics = {\n        'A. Viennese Waltz': 'Swing Dance: Continuous, flowing rotation. Overturning is a rotational error.',\n        'B. English Waltz': 'Swing Dance: Continuous, flowing rotation with rise and fall. Overturning is a rotational error.',\n        'C. European Tango': 'Staccato Dance: Sharp, clipped actions. Turns are precise and not continuous. Introducing continuous rotation is a fundamental breach of technique.',\n        'D. Slow Foxtrott': 'Swing Dance: Continuous, linear movement. Overturning is a rotational error.',\n        'E. Quickstep': 'Swing Dance: Dynamic, brisk movement. Overturning is a rotational error.'\n    }\n\n    # The logic dictates that the dance without continuous, swinging rotation is the answer.\n    # In Tango, to overturn, one must introduce swing, which is disregarding the core technique.\n    # In the other dances, one is simply exaggerating an existing technical element (swing/rotation).\n    correct_dance = 'European Tango'\n    \n    # Building the \"equation\" to print, as requested.\n    part1 = correct_dance\n    part2 = \"Reverse Turn\"\n    part3 = \"Attempted Overturn\"\n    result = \"Impossible Without Disregarding Core Staccato Technique\"\n\n    print(\"Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"The key difference lies in the style of movement. All listed dances except one are 'swing' dances based on continuous momentum.\")\n    print(f\"In the {correct_dance}, movement is staccato (sharp and disconnected).
