    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the structure of the integral cohomology ring $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ of the Grassmannian of 3-planes in $\\mathbb{R}^5$. Specifically, we are interested in its torsion subgroup.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify the space**: The space is the real Grassmannian $Gr(3, 5)$. Its dimension is $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$.\n2.  **Universal Coefficient Theorem**: The integral cohomology of this space is known to have only 2-torsion. The Universal Coefficient Theorem provides a relationship between the ranks of cohomology groups with $\\mathbb{Q}$ coefficients (the Betti numbers, $b_i$), $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients (the $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$-Betti numbers, $d_i$), and the dimensions of the 2-torsion subgroups of the integral cohomology groups ($t_i = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}} \\text{Tor}(H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}))_2$). The relationship is given by the formula:\n    $d_i = b_i + t_i + t_{i+1}$\n3.  **Calculate Betti numbers ($b_i$)**: The Betti numbers $b_i = \\text{rank}(H^i(Gr(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}))$ are the dimensions of the rational cohomology groups. The rational cohomology ring of $Gr(3,5)$ is known to be $H^*(Gr(3,5); \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}[p_1]/ (p_1^2)$, where $p_1$ is the first Pontryagin class of the tautological bundle, which is in degree 4. This implies that the only non-zero Betti numbers are $b_0=1$ and $b_4=1$.\n4.  **Calculate $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$-Betti numbers ($d_i$)**: The cohomology groups $H^i(Gr(k,n); \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})$ have dimensions $d_i$ equal to the number of Schubert cells of dimension $i$. These cells are indexed by partitions $\\lambda=(\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ such that $n-k \\ge \\lambda_1 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k \\ge 0$. The dimension of the cell is $|\\lambda| = \\sum \\lambda_j$. We will enumerate these partitions for $Gr(3,5)$ and count them by dimension.\n5.  **Solve for Torsion ($t_i$)**: With the values of $b_i$ and $d_i$, we can solve the system of equations for $t_i$ iteratively, starting with $t_0=0$.\n6.  **Find the rank**: The \"rank of the torsion subgroup\" is interpreted as the sum of the dimensions of the torsion components, $\\sum t_i$. This is the 2-rank of the total torsion subgroup of the cohomology ring.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_grassmannian_torsion_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology\n    ring of the Grassmannian Gr(3, 5).\n    \"\"\"\n    k = 3\n    n = 5\n    dim = k * (n - k)\n\n    # Step 1: Determine the Betti numbers b_i.\n    # The rational cohomology ring H*(Gr(3,5); Q) is Q[p1]/(p1^2),\n    # where deg(p1) = 4.\n    # This means the only non-zero Betti numbers are b_0 = 1 and b_4 = 1.\n    b = [0] * (dim + 1)\n    b[0] = 1\n    b[4] = 1\n    print(f\"Betti numbers b_i (ranks over Q): {b}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the dimensions d_i of H^i(Gr(3,5); Z/2Z).\n    # These are the number of Schubert cells of dimension i.\n    # The cells are indexed by partitions (l1, l2, l3) such that\n    # n-k >= l1 >= l2 >= l3 >= 0.
