    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the relevant theorem:** The connection between the HOMFLY polynomial of a knot and its Seifert circles is given by the Morton-Franks-Williams inequality. This inequality relates the span of the polynomial in one of its variables to the minimum number of Seifert circles.\n2.  **State the inequality:** For a knot K, its HOMFLY polynomial $P(l, m)$, and its minimum number of Seifert circles $s(K)$, the inequality is:\n    $span_m(P) \\le 2 \\cdot (s(K) - 1)$\n    where $span_m(P)$ is the difference between the maximum and minimum powers of the variable $m$ in the polynomial.\n3.  **Find the lower bound:** By rearranging the inequality, we can find a lower bound for $s(K)$:\n    $s(K) \\ge \\frac{span_m(P)}{2} + 1$\n4.  **Execute the plan in Python:** I will write a Python script to:\n    a. Obtain the HOMFLY polynomial for the knot $9_{23}$ using the `spherogram` library.\n    b. Analyze the resulting polynomial to find the maximum and minimum degrees of the variable `m`.\n    c. Calculate the span and then the lower bound using the formula.\n    d. To make the code robust, I'll include a fallback mechanism that uses the known polynomial for $9_{23}$ in case the `spherogram` library is not installed or fails.\n5.  **Present the result:** The script will print out the steps of the calculation, including the final equation with all the numbers, to arrive at the answer.\n\n```python\nimport spherogram\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_knot_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles\n    for the 9_23 knot using its HOMFLY polynomial.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Define symbolic variables\n        l, m = sympy.symbols('l, m')\n        \n        # 1.
