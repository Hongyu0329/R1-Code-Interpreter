    "In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix, the matrix is recursively partitioned. This partitioning can be visualized as a binary tree, where each node corresponds to a specific submatrix (or block) of the original matrix. A matrix-matrix multiplication operation involving HSS matrices requires processing the information (known as generators) stored at each node of the tree. Therefore, to find the total number of submatrices accessed, we need to count the total number of nodes in the corresponding HSS tree.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  The problem states the tree has a depth of 4. In a typical representation, this means we have levels 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n2.  Assuming a full binary tree (which is standard for HSS), the number of nodes at any given level `l` is `2^l`.\n3.  The total number of submatrices accessed is the sum of the nodes at each level, from the root (level 0) to the deepest level (level 4).\n4.  The code will calculate the number of nodes at each level, print the full summation equation, and then compute the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hss_submatrices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrices in an HSS tree of a given depth.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The depth of the Hierarchical Semi-separable tree.\n    depth = 4\n\n    print(\"For a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree, the total number of accessed submatrices\")\n    print(\"corresponds to the total number of nodes in the tree representation.\")\n    print(f\"Given a tree of depth {depth}, we have levels 0 through {depth}.\")\n    print(\"The number of nodes (submatrices) at each level 'l' is 2^l.\")\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total, we sum the number of nodes at each level:\")\n\n    # Calculate the number of nodes at each level\n    nodes_per_level = []\n    for level in range(depth + 1):\n        num_nodes = int(math.pow(2, level))\n        nodes_per_level.append(num_nodes)\n\n    # Format the equation string\n    equation_parts = [str(n) for n in nodes_per_level]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    # Calculate the total sum\n    total_nodes = sum(nodes_per_level)\n\n    # Print the final equation and the result\n    print(f\"Total Submatrices = {equation_str}\")\n    print(f\"Total Submatrices = {total_nodes}\")\n\nsolve_hss_submatrices()\n```\n<<<31>>>"
