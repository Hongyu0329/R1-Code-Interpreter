def solve():
    """
    Evaluates statements about probabilistic graphical models and identifies the true ones.
    
    A: False. Approximate inference methods are often more efficient for graphs with high treewidth.
    B: False. The junction tree algorithm is not resilient to high treewidth; its complexity is exponential in it.
    C: True. The nodes of a junction tree are cliques, and the algorithm operates on potential tables representing the joint distributions within these cliques.
    D: False. This statement is based on the incorrect premise that the algorithm is resilient to high treewidth.
    E: True. High treewidth leads to large cliques, and the exponential complexity makes the algorithm impractical.
    F: False. Same as D.
    G: True. The reason the algorithm is not resilient to high treewidth is that it needs to handle joint distributions over large cliques, which is computationally expensive.
    H: False. The complexity increases exponentially, not linearly, with the number of variables in the largest clique.
    I: True. The computational cost is exponential in the size of the largest clique (treewidth + 1). As the number of variables in that clique increases linearly, the cost grows exponentially, thus efficiency diminishes exponentially.
    J: False. The efficiency is heavily dependent on the size of the largest clique.
    L: False. This describes a consequence of the running intersection property, not its most precise definition. The actual definition applies to the intersection of any *two* cliques.
