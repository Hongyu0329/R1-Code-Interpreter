    # The problem can be solved by applying a known theorem from continuum theory.

    # Step 1: State the relevant theorem.
    # A theorem by F. B. Jones states that a continuum X is aposyndetic if and only if
    # the set of its non-block points is the entire space X.
    # Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the smallest possible cardinality
    # of an aposyndetic continuum X.

    # Step 2: Analyze the cardinality of a continuum (a compact, connected, Hausdorff space).
    # We consider two cases for the continuum X.

    # Case A: The degenerate continuum.
    # Let X be a space with a single point. This space is compact, connected,
    # and Hausdorff, so it is a continuum. The condition for being aposyndetic
    # is vacuously satisfied because there are no two distinct points.
    # Thus, a single-point space is an aposyndetic continuum.
    cardinality_degenerate_case = 1

    # Case B: A non-degenerate continuum.
    # If a continuum X has more than one point, it can be proven that it must be
    # uncountably infinite. For example, the interval [0, 1] is an aposyndetic
    # continuum, and its cardinality is the cardinality of the continuum, c.
    # The smallest cardinality for a non-degenerate continuum is c.

    # Step 3: Conclude the minimum cardinality.
    # The possible cardinalities for an aposyndetic continuum are 1 (from Case A)
    # or at least c (from Case B). The minimum of these possibilities is 1.

    smallest_possible_cardinality = 1
