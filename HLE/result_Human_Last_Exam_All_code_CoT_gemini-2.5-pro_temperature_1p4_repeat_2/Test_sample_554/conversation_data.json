    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar, we first need to establish the chemical formula of a standard nanocar. Then, we apply the chemical definition of the \"perfluoro-\" prefix.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the Nanocar's Formula**: We will base our calculation on the chassis of the original nanocar molecule. Its chemical structure is well-documented. By counting the atoms, we find its chemical formula is C38H20.\n2.  **Define \"Perfluoro-\"**: In organic chemistry, the prefix \"perfluoro-\" means that all hydrogen (H) atoms in a hydrocarbon have been replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.\n3.  **Calculate Fluorine Atoms**: Since the nanocar chassis has 20 hydrogen atoms, a perfluoronanocar would have all 20 of these hydrogen atoms replaced with fluorine atoms. Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms is 20.\n\nThis script will perform the calculation based on this logic.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perfluoronanocar_atoms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n    \n    This is based on the chemical formula of the chassis of the first synthesized nanocar.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the chemical composition of the nanocar chassis.\n    # The formula for the chassis of the original nanocar is C38H20.\n    carbon_atoms_nanocar = 38\n    hydrogen_atoms_nanocar = 20\n    \n    print(f\"The chemical formula for a standard nanocar chassis is C{carbon_atoms_nanocar}H{hydrogen_atoms_nanocar}.\")\n    print(\"The prefix 'perfluoro-' means every hydrogen atom (H) is replaced by a fluorine atom (F).\")\n    \n    # Step 2: In a perfluorinated compound, the number of fluorine atoms\n    # is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original molecule.\n    fluorine_atoms_perfluoronanocar = hydrogen_atoms_nanocar\n    \n    # Step 3: Print the final calculation and result.\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the number of fluorine atoms:\")\n    print(f\"Number of hydrogen atoms to replace = {hydrogen_atoms_nanocar}\")\n    print(f\"Number of fluorine atoms in perfluoronanocar = {fluorine_atoms_perfluoronanocar}\")\n\ncalculate_perfluoronanocar_atoms()\n<<<20>>>"
