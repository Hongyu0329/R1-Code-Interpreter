    "This is a classic movie trivia question. The scene in question is the climactic moment where the protagonist finally locates the man who framed him.\n\nMy plan is to create a Python script that will:\n1.  Store the name of the film in a variable.\n2.  Provide a brief explanation of the specific scene.\n3.  Print the film's title and the explanation to answer your question.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_by_quote():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the movie based on the \"Thank you\" on a bus scene.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Information about the film and the specific scene\n    movie_title = \"The Fugitive\"\n    year = 1993\n    character_saying_line = \"Dr. Charles Nichols\"\n    protagonist = \"Dr. Richard Kimble\"\n\n    # The explanation of the scene\n    explanation = (\n        f\"The Oscar-nominated film is '{movie_title}' from the year {year}.\\n\\n\"\n        f\"In a key scene, the villain, {character_saying_line}, boards an 'L' train (often mistaken for a bus) in Chicago. \"\n        f\"He says a simple 'Thank you' to the operator. The protagonist, {protagonist}, who is already on the train but hasn't \"\n        f\"seen him yet, recognizes his voice. This recognition leads directly to the final confrontation.\"\n    )\n\n    # Print the final answer\n    print(explanation)\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer\nfind_movie_by_quote()\n```\n<<<The Fugitive>>>"
