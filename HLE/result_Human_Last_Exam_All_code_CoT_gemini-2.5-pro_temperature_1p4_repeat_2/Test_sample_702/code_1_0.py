# This script calculates the connectivity of the specified topological map.

# 1. Identify the dimensions of the spheres from the map.
# The map is of the form Sigma(Omega S^m wedge Omega S^n) -> Omega(S^m wedge S^n).
# From the user's query, we have S^4 and S^6.
m = 4
n = 6

# 2. State the relevant theorem from homotopy theory.
# A theorem states that the connectivity of this map is (m+n).
# This means the map induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups up to degree m+n-1,
# and a surjection at degree m+n.

# 3. Calculate the connectivity.
connectivity = m + n

# 4. Print the explanation and the result.

print("According to a theorem in algebraic topology, the connectivity of this map is given by the sum of the sphere dimensions (m+n).")
print("This is because the map is an (m+n)-equivalence.")

print(f"\nThus, the connectivity of the map is {connectivity}.")
