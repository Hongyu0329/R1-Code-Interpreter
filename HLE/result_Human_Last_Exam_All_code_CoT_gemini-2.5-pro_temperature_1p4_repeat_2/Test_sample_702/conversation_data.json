    "Of course, I can help with that. This question pertains to the field of algebraic topology, specifically homotopy theory.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Map:** The map given is $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. This is an instance of a general map in homotopy theory, often denoted as $H_{m,n}$, which is given by $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^m \\wedge \\Omega S^n) \\to \\Omega(S^m \\wedge S^n)$. In this specific case, we have $m=4$ and $n=6$.\n\n2.  **Define Connectivity:** The connectivity of a map $f: X \\to Y$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups, $\\pi_i(f): \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i=k$. This is also referred to as being a \"k-equivalence\".\n\n3.  **State the Relevant Theorem:** There is a significant result in homotopy theory, established by topologists like F. Cohen and J. Wu, concerning the connectivity of the map $H_{m,n}$. The theorem states that for spheres $S^m$ and $S^n$ with dimensions $m, n \\ge 2$, the map $H_{m,n}$ is an $(m+n)$-equivalence.\n\n4.  **Apply the Theorem:** According to the theorem, the connectivity of the map is the sum of the dimensions of the two spheres involved.\n    *   Sphere 1 has dimension $m=4$.\n    *   Sphere 2 has dimension $n=6$.\n    *   The connectivity is therefore $m+n = 4+6$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Result:** The final calculation is a simple addition. The python script below will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the connectivity of the specified topological map.\n\n# 1. Identify the dimensions of the spheres from the map.\n# The map is of the form Sigma(Omega S^m wedge Omega S^n) -> Omega(S^m wedge S^n).\n# From the user's query, we have S^4 and S^6.\nm = 4\nn = 6\n\n# 2. State the relevant theorem from homotopy theory.\n# A theorem states that the connectivity of this map is (m+n).\n# This means the map induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups up to degree m+n-1,\n# and a surjection at degree m+n.\n\n# 3. Calculate the connectivity.\nconnectivity = m + n\n\n# 4. Print the explanation and the result.\nprint(\"The map is of the form H_m,n: Sigma(Omega S^m wedge Omega S^n) -> Omega(S^m wedge S^n).\")\nprint(f\"For the given map, the sphere dimensions are m = {m} and n = {n}.\")\nprint(\"According to a theorem in algebraic topology, the connectivity of this map is given by the sum of the sphere dimensions (m+n).\")\nprint(\"This is because the map is an (m+n)-equivalence.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"{m} + {n} = {connectivity}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThus, the connectivity of the map is {connectivity}.\")\n```\n<<<10>>>"
