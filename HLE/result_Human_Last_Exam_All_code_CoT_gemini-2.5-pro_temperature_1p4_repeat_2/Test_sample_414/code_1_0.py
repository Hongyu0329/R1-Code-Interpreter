    Solves for the time between sample separation and first measurement.

    The problem describes the ingrowth of a daughter nuclide (La-140) from a
    parent (Ba-140) after chemical separation. The activity measured is assumed
    to be that of the daughter La-140, as its Cherenkov signal is much stronger.

    Let t be the time from separation to the first measurement.
    A1 = Activity at time t
    A2 = Activity at time t + 14 days

    The ratio A2/A1 is given by the Bateman equation for daughter growth,
    where the constant terms cancel out. We need to solve the following
    equation for t:
    A2/A1 = [exp(-lambda_p*(t+14)) - exp(-lambda_d*(t+14))] / [exp(-lambda_p*t) - exp(-lambda_d*t)]
