    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to calculate the \"rule activation level\" for a fuzzy rule, given the firing level of the antecedent and the membership value of the consequent.\n2.  **Identify the Operation:** The calculation requires a **t-norm** operation. A t-norm is a function used in fuzzy logic to model the intersection, which is equivalent to a logical \"AND\". There are several types of t-norms, but the most common one, and the one I will use here, is the **minimum (min)** operator. Other t-norms include the product and the Lukasiewicz t-norm.\n3.  **Define the Formula:** The rule activation level, let's call it `w`, is calculated by applying the chosen t-norm to the given values.\n    *   Given firing level of the antecedent: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`\n    *   Given membership value of the consequent: `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n    *   Using the minimum t-norm, the formula is: `w = min(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** Substitute the given values into the formula:\n    *   `w = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n    *   The result is `0.7`.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Initializes variables for `Phi_k(x′)` and `μG_k_j(y_j)`.\n    *   Calculates the minimum of these two values.\n    *   Prints the final equation showing the inputs and the result, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\n# The firing level of the rule's antecedent (the \"IF\" part)\nphi_k = 0.7\n\n# The membership value of the rule's consequent (the \"THEN\" part)\nmu_G = 0.9\n\n# The rule activation level is calculated using a t-norm operation, which\n# models a fuzzy \"AND\". The most common t-norm is the minimum operator.\nactivation_level = min(phi_k, mu_G)\n\nprint(\"Calculating the rule activation level using the minimum t-norm:\")\nprint(f\"Antecedent Firing Level Phi_k(x') = {phi_k}\")\nprint(f\"Consequent Membership Value μG_k_j(y_j) = {mu_G}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe activation level (w) is the t-norm of these two values:\")\nprint(f\"w = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\nprint(f\"w = min({phi_k}, {mu_G})\")\nprint(f\"w = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
