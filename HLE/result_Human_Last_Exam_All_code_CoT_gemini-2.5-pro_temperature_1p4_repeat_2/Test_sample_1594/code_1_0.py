# Plan:
# 1. The task is to identify the letter formed by the buildings of two specific
#    high schools in Pisa when viewed from above.
# 2. This is a visual knowledge task, not a computational one. The standard way
#    to solve this is by using a mapping service with satellite imagery.
# 3. By searching for "Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti" and "Istituto Ulisse Dini"
#    on a map and switching to satellite view, we can observe their shapes.
# 4. The Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti building forms a long horizontal line.
#    The Istituto Ulisse Dini building is connected to the middle of the first
#    building, forming a perpendicular vertical line.
# 5. This arrangement clearly resembles a letter of the alphabet.

# The resulting letter from the building layout
formed_letter = "T"
