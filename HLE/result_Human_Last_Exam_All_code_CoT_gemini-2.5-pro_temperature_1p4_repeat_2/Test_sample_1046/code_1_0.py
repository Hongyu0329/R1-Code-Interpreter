    # --- Scenario ---
    # Bacterium 1: Acquires resistance via fast Lateral Gene Transfer (LGT).
    # Bacterium 2: Acquires resistance via slow/rare mutations.
    # Observation: Both acquire resistance at an equal pace.
    # Question: How is this possible for Bacterium 2?

    # --- Key Concepts ---
    factors = {
        "Rare Mutation": "The initial event that provides resistance. Necessary but not sufficient to explain the pace.",
        "Fitness Cost": "Resistance mutations are often detrimental to the bacterium's normal functions, slowing its growth.",
        "Compensatory Mutation": "A second mutation that alleviates the fitness cost of the first, restoring growth rate.",
        "Cross-Resistance": "A single mutation providing resistance to multiple different drugs, making it highly advantageous."

    analysis_b = "This is the most powerful combination. A highly impactful initial event (cross-resistance) is followed by fitness restoration (compensatory mutation), allowing the super-fit, multi-resistant strain to sweep the population rapidly. This provides the strongest explanation for matching the pace of LGT."
