        'A': "This is a plausible, common interpretation. Augustine's later writings on predestination and grace are seen by many as precursors to Calvinist doctrine, making this a valid point of scholarly discussion.",
        'B': "This statement is incorrect. R. A. Markus, a renowned historian, did argue for an 'asymmetrical' view of freedom in Augustine. However, the claim that he did so 'while ignoring his thoughts on predestination and grace' is a mischaracterization. A serious scholar like Markus would not ignore such central tenets; rather, his work integrates them into a broader analysis of Augustine's thought on history and society.",
        'C': "This is correct. Augustine's concept of 'voluntas' (the will) is a cornerstone of his psychology, and the influence of Stoic thinkers like Seneca on his development of this concept is widely acknowledged by scholars.",
        'D': "This is a correct and fundamental interpretation of Augustine. For him, faith and reason (theology and philosophy) are inextricably linked, a principle often summarized as 'faith seeking understanding.' Questions like 'free will' cannot be understood apart from theological concepts like 'grace.'",
        'E': "This is correct. Etienne Gilson was a leading scholar of medieval philosophy. He accurately identified that Augustine's idea of grace was 'irresistible,' while also making the nuanced and correct distinction that this was not identical to the later, more rigid formulation by the Jansenists.",
        'F': "This is correct. In his work 'On Free Choice of the Will' (De libero arbitrio), Augustine's dialogue with Evodius establishes that evil originates from the will's misuse of its freedom, thereby making human beings responsible for their own actions."
