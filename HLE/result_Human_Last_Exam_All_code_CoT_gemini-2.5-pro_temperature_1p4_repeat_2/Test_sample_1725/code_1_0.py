    Solves the two parts of the crystal model problem.

    Part A: The dimension of the fibers of the bundle pi.
    The physical field is the 3x3 distortion tensor, so the fiber dimension is 9.

    Part B: The number of coefficients specifying the energy functional E.
    The energy is a quadratic form in the strain tensor. For a cubic crystal, the
    stiffness tensor has 3 independent coefficients.
