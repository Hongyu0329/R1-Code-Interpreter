        "2. Impact on CAR T Cell Manufacturing: When IL-15 is used during the ex vivo expansion phase of CAR T cell production, it enriches the final product with these desirable memory-like cells.",
        "3. Enhanced Functional Potency: Memory T cells are known for their superior persistence after infusion and their ability to mount a robust and rapid response upon re-encountering their target antigen.",
        "4. Conclusion on Cytokine Release: A key part of this robust T cell response is the secretion of effector cytokines (e.g., Interferon-gamma, TNF-alpha). Therefore, since IL-15 cultivates a more functionally potent CAR T cell population, these cells are predicted to release a higher quantity of cytokines upon stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured in the absence of IL-15."
