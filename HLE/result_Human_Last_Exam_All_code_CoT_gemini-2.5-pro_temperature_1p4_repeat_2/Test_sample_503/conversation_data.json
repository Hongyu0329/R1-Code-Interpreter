    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, I need to understand the mathematical concepts in the user's request. The problem is about finding the number of \"internal adjunctions\" from an object `[23]` to an object `[37]` in the simplex category `Δ`, viewed as a specific type of 2-category.\n2.  An \"internal adjunction\" in a locally posetal 2-category (like `Δ` is described) between two objects, say `A` and `B`, is a pair of morphisms (maps) `L: A -> B` and `R: B -> A` that form a Galois connection. For the objects `[m]` and `[n]`, which are totally ordered sets (posets), this means we have two order-preserving maps `L: [m] -> [n]` and `R: [n] -> [m]` such that for any `x` in `[m]` and `y` in `[n]`, the condition `L(x) ≤ y` is equivalent to `x ≤ R(y)`.\n3.  It is a known result in category theory that such an adjunction is uniquely determined by an order-preserving map `L: [m] -> [n]` that preserves all suprema (joins). For a finite total order like `[m]`, this preservation property is equivalent to the simple condition `L(0) = 0`.\n4.  Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of order-preserving (monotone non-decreasing) functions `L` from `[23]` to `[37]` that satisfy `L(0) = 0`.\n5.  An order-preserving function `L: [23] -> [37]` is defined by a sequence of values `L(0), L(1), ..., L(23)` such that `0 ≤ L(0) ≤ L(1) ≤ ... ≤ L(23) ≤ 37`.\n6.  The condition `L(0) = 0` fixes the first value. So we need to count the number of sequences `L(1), ..., L(23)` such that `0 ≤ L(1) ≤ L(2) ≤ ... ≤ L(23) ≤ 37`.\n7.  This is a classic combinatorial problem, often called \"stars and bars\" or \"combinations with repetition\". We are choosing 23 values from the set `{0, 1, ..., 37}` (which has `37 + 1 = 38` elements) with replacement. The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient formula `C(N+k-1, k)`, where `k` is the number of items to choose (`m=23`) and `N` is the number of options (`n+1=38`).\n8.  The formula evaluates to `C( (37+1) + 23 - 1, 23) = C(38+22, 23) = C(60, 23)`.\n9.  A more direct formula for the number of adjunctions from `[m]` to `[n]` is `C(n+m, m)`. For `m=23` and `n=37`, this is `C(37+23, 23) = C(60, 23)`.\n10. I will write a Python script to calculate this value using the `math.comb` function. The script will print the values used in the formula as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_adjunction_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category\n    from [m] to [n].\n\n    This problem is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps\n    L: [m] -> [n] such that L(0) = 0.
