### Step-by-Step Explanation

1.  **The Bose-Einstein Distribution**
    The foundation for understanding a gas of non-interacting bosons is the Bose-Einstein distribution. It describes the average number of particles, `n_i`, in a single-particle quantum state with a specific energy `ε_i`. The formula is:

    `n_i = 1 / (exp((ε_i - μ) / (k_B * T)) - 1)`

2.  **The Terms in the Equation**
    As requested, here is a breakdown of each term in the equation:
    *   `n_i`: The average number of bosons occupying the state `i`. This must be a positive number.
    *   `ε_i`: The energy of the single-particle state `i`. The lowest possible energy is the ground state energy, denoted as `ε_0`.
    *   `μ` (mu): The chemical potential. It is a thermodynamic quantity that controls the average number of particles in the system.
    *   `k_B`: The Boltzmann constant, a fundamental constant in physics.
    *   `T`: The absolute temperature of the system.

3.  **The Fundamental Physical Constraint**
    For `n_i` to be a positive number, the denominator in the formula must also be positive:
    `exp((ε_i - μ) / (k_B * T)) - 1 > 0`

4.  **Deriving the Limit on the Chemical Potential**
    To satisfy the inequality above, the exponential term must be greater than 1:
    `exp((ε_i - μ) / (k_B * T)) > 1`

    By taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:
    `(ε_i - μ) / (k_B * T) > 0`

    Since `k_B` and `T` are positive constants, this inequality holds if and only if:
    `ε_i - μ > 0`  which means  `μ < ε_i`

5.  **The Universal Upper Limit for μ**
    The condition `μ < ε_i` must be true for all possible energy states `i`. This implies that the chemical potential `μ` must be strictly less than the energy of the lowest possible state, the ground state `ε_0`.
    
    `μ < ε_0`

6.  **The Role of μ in Condensation**
    As a Bose gas is cooled, particles accumulate in the lowest available energy states. To account for a fixed total number of particles, the chemical potential `μ` must increase and get closer to `ε_0`. When `μ` becomes infinitesimally close to `ε_0`, the denominator for the ground state, `exp((ε_0 - μ) / (k_B*T)) - 1`, approaches zero, allowing its occupation `n_0` to become macroscopically large. This is the definition of Bose-Einstein condensation. In the condensed phase (T ≤ T_critical), the chemical potential is effectively clamped at this maximum value: `μ = ε_0`.

7.  **Evaluating the Answer Choices**
    We are looking for the choice that correctly states this limit, `μ = ε_0`.
    *   Choice C is: "μ must be equal to the chemical potential of a non-interacting Bose gas at zero temperature."
    *   At zero temperature (T=0), all particles in a non-interacting Bose gas must be in the ground state. The chemical potential under these conditions is exactly the ground state energy, `ε_0`.
    *   Therefore, choice C is an accurate and correct way of stating the condition for the chemical potential in a Bose-Einstein condensate.
