    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n### Step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Properties of the function `f`**\n    *   The function `f` is given to be continuous.\n    *   `f` must be injective (one-to-one): If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which implies $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since $\\exp(x)$ is injective, $x_1 = x_2$.\n    *   A continuous and injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic.\n    *   `f` cannot be strictly decreasing. A strictly decreasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have a unique fixed point $x_0$ (i.e., $f(x_0) = x_0$). Applying `f` to both sides gives $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. But from the given equation, $f(f(x_0)) = \\exp(x_0)$. This would mean $x_0 = \\exp(x_0)$, which has no real solutions. Thus, `f` cannot be strictly decreasing.\n    *   Therefore, any solution `f` must be strictly increasing.\n\n2.  **Domain and Range of `f`**\n    *   Let `f` be a strictly increasing continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$. Its range must be an open interval $(a, b)$, where $a = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$ and $b = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)$.\n    *   The range of $f(f(x))$ is $f((a,b))$, which must be equal to the range of $\\exp(x)$, i.e., $(0, \\infty)$.\n    *   Since `f` is increasing, $f((a,b)) = (\\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y), \\lim_{y\\to b^-} f(y))$. Thus, we must have $\\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y) = 0$ and $\\lim_{y\\to b^-} f(y) = \\infty$.\n    *   The second condition, $\\lim_{y\\to b^-} f(y) = \\infty$, implies that the upper limit of the range, `b`, must be $\\infty$.\n    *   The first condition involves the limit of `f` as its argument approaches `a`. For this limit to be well-defined within the real numbers, `a` must be a finite real number, and by continuity, we must have $f(a)=0$.\n    *   So, for any solution `f`, there exists a finite real number `a` such that $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = a$ and its range is $(a, \\infty)$. Also, we must have $f(a)=0$.\n\n3.  **Constructing the Solutions**\n    *   Since `f` is strictly increasing and $f(a)=0$, we must have $a<0$ (because if $a \\ge 0$, then for $x<a$, we would have $f(x) < f(a) = 0$, but the range of `f` is $(a, \\infty)$, which for $a \\ge 0$ does not contain negative numbers).\n    *   From $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, it can be shown that `f` must commute with $\\exp(x)$, i.e., $f(\\exp(x)) = \\exp(f(x))$.\n    *   Taking the limit as $x \\to -\\infty$, we get $f(0) = \\exp(a)$.\n    *   A solution `f` is completely determined by the choice of `a` and its definition on the interval $[a, 0]$. On this interval, `f` must be a continuous, strictly increasing function `h` such that $h(a) = 0$ and $h(0) = \\exp(a)$. Any such function `h` can be extended to a full solution `f` on $\\mathbb{R}$ using the relation $f(f(x))=\\exp(x)$.\n\n4.  **Counting the Solutions**\n    *   The construction of a valid function `f` depends on two independent choices:\n        1.  The value of `a`. It can be any number in $(-\\infty, 0)$. The cardinality of this set of choices is $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n        2.  For each choice of `a`, the function `h: [a, 0] \\to [0, \\exp(a)]`. This `h` can be any strictly increasing homeomorphism between these two intervals. The set of such functions also has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   The total number of distinct solutions is the product of the cardinalities of these sets of choices.\n\nThe following Python code prints the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cardinality():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the steps to find the cardinality of the set of\n    continuous functions f: R -> R satisfying f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Let S be the set of continuous functions f: R -> R such that f(f(x)) = exp(x).\")\n    print(\"We want to find the cardinality of S, denoted as |S|.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Determine the properties of f.\")\n    print(\"1. f must be strictly increasing.
