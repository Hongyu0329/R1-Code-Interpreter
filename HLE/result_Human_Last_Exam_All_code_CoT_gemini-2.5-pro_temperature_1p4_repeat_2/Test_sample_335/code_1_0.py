# The problem is to compute floor(10^6 * V), where V is the simplicial volume
# of the complement of the knot K = C_{4,3}(Conway) # Wh_-^2(Eight).

# Step 1: Define the simplicial volumes of the base knot complements.
# The simplicial volume of a knot K complement is denoted as ||S^3 \ K||.

# For the Conway knot (also known as 11n34):
# The Conway knot is a slice knot. A key theorem in knot theory states that
# the simplicial volume of the complement of any slice knot is 0.

# For the figure-8 knot (also known as 4_1):
# The figure-8 knot is the simplest hyperbolic knot. Its complement S^3 \ Eight is a
# hyperbolic manifold. The simplicial volume is given by Vol(S^3 \ Eight) / v_3,
# where Vol is the hyperbolic volume and v_3 is the volume of a regular ideal tetrahedron.
# This value is known to be exactly 2.
vol_eight_comp = 2
print(f"The simplicial volume of the figure-8 knot complement is: ||S^3 \\ Eight|| = {vol_eight_comp}")

# Step 2: Calculate the simplicial volume for the component knots K1 and K2.
# K = K1 # K2, where # is the connected sum.

# K1 is the (4,3)-cable of the Conway knot, K1 = C_{4,3}(Conway).
# The simplicial volume of a cabled knot C_{p,q}(K') is given by the formula:
# ||S^3 \ C_{p,q}(K')|| = |p| * ||S^3 \ K'||.
# For K1, the cabling parameters are (p,q) = (4,3).
p = 4
vol_k1_comp = p * vol_conway_comp

print("----------------------------------------")

# K2 is the 2-twisted negative Whitehead double of the figure-8 knot, K2 = Wh_-^2(Eight).
# A theorem on Whitehead doubles states that for a t-twisted double Wh_t(K') with |t|=2,
# the simplicial volume of its complement is independent of the knot K' and is equal to the
# simplicial volume of the figure-8 knot complement.
# The number of twists is t=-2 (or 2 depending on convention), so |t|=2.
# Therefore, ||S^3 \ Wh_-^2(Eight)|| = ||S^3 \ Eight||.
vol_k2_comp = vol_eight_comp
print(f"K2 = Wh_-^2(Eight)")
print(f"The simplicial volume of K2's complement is: ||S^3 \\ K2|| = ||S^3 \\ Eight|| = {vol_k2_comp}")
print("----------------------------------------")

# Step 3: Calculate the total simplicial volume V for the connected sum K = K1 # K2.
# The simplicial volume is additive over connected sums of knots:
# ||S^3 \ (KA # KB)|| = ||S^3 \ KA|| + ||S^3 \ KB||.
V = vol_k1_comp + vol_k2_comp
print(f"K = K1 # K2")
print(f"The total simplicial volume V = ||S^3 \\ K|| is the sum of the individual volumes.")
print(f"V = ||S^3 \\ K1|| + ||S^3 \\ K2|| = {vol_k1_comp} + {vol_k2_comp} = {V}")
print("----------------------------------------")

# Step 4: Compute the final value as requested.
# The task is to compute floor(10^6 * V).
final_value = math.floor(10**6 * V)

print(f"The final computation is floor(10^6 * V)")
print(f"floor(1000000 * {V}) = {final_value}")
