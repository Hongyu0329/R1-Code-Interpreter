    "The problem asks for the value of `a(3)`, where `a(n)` represents the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n` for electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics.\n\nThis number `a(n)` is calculated using the formula for the double factorial:\n`a(n) = (2n - 1)!!`\n\nThe double factorial of an odd number `k` (denoted as `k!!`) is the product of all odd integers from `k` down to 1.\n\nFor `n = 3`, we need to calculate:\n`a(3) = (2 * 3 - 1)!! = (6 - 1)!! = 5!!`\n\nSo, we need to compute the value of `5!!`, which is `5 * 3 * 1`.\n\nI will provide a Python script that calculates this value and prints the equation step-by-step as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_feynman_diagrams(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n) = (2n - 1)!!, the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams\n    of order 2n for electron or photon propagators.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 1:\n        print(\"n must be a positive integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # The starting number for the double factorial\n    k = 2 * n - 1\n    \n    # List to store the numbers in the multiplication\n    factors = []\n    \n    # Variable to store the final product\n    result = 1\n    \n    # Calculate the double factorial (product of all odd numbers from k down to 1)\n    for i in range(k, 0, -2):\n        result *= i\n        factors.append(str(i))\n    \n    # Format the equation string\n    equation = \" * \".join(factors)\n    \n    # Print the final result and the equation\n    print(f\"For n = {n}, the order is 2n = {2*n}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of diagrams a({n}) is (2*{n} - 1)!! = {k}!!\")\n    print(\"The calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation} = {result}\")\n\n# The user asked for a(3)\nn_value = 3\ncalculate_feynman_diagrams(n_value)\n```\n<<<15>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
