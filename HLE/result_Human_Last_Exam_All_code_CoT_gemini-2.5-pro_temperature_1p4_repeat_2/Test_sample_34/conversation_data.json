    "In poker, specifically No-Limit Texas Hold'em, the value of a starting hand is determined by several factors, including its raw card strength (high cards), its ability to make straights (connectedness), and its ability to make flushes (suitedness). When opening from the button (BTN), you want to play a very wide range of hands to attack the blinds.\n\nThe question asks for the \"worst\" suited jack that you should still open-raise. This means we are looking for the suited jack with the lowest expected value (EV) that is still considered a profitable play.\n\nLet's break down the suited jacks: JXs (where X is the other card and 's' denotes suited).\n\n1.  **Strength Hierarchy**: The strength of a JXs hand is primarily determined by the rank of the kicker (the 'X' card). A higher kicker is better for two main reasons:\n    *   It reduces the chance of being dominated. If you make a pair of jacks, a hand like KJs is much stronger than J2s because an opponent is less likely to have a better jack (only AJ).\n    *   It improves straight potential. Hands like JTs and J9s are connectors, making them excellent for forming straights. As the kicker gets lower (J8s, J7s, ... J2s), the gap between the cards increases, reducing the number of straights you can make.\n\n2.  **Game Theory Optimal (GTO) Ranges**: According to standard GTO pre-flop charts for a 100BB deep, rake-free game, a button opening range is very wide (often 45-50% of hands). This range typically includes all suited jacks, from AJs down to the very weakest one.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: Following the logic above, the value of suited jacks decreases as the kicker gets lower. Therefore, the hierarchy is AJs > KJs > QJs > ... > J3s > J2s. The hand with the lowest kicker that is still included in a standard opening range is Jack-Two suited.\n\nTherefore, the worst suited jack you should open from the button is J2s.\n\n```python\ndef solve_poker_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the worst suited jack to open from the button\n    in a 100BB rake-free cash game and prints the result.\n\n    The ranking of suited jacks (JXs) from best to worst is based on the kicker card.\n    Higher kickers are better due to less domination and better straight potential.\n    - Best: AJs, KJs, QJs, JTs (strong broadway cards and connectors)\n    - Middle: J9s, J8s, J7s (suited connectors and one-gappers)\n    - Weakest: J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s (low kickers, poor connectivity)\n\n    In a standard GTO button opening range, all suited jacks are typically included\n    as a raise. The one with the lowest value, and therefore the \"worst\" one you should\n    still open, is the one with the lowest kicker.\n    \"\"\"\n    worst_suited_jack = \"J2s\"\n    print(worst_suited_jack)\n\nsolve_poker_question()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
