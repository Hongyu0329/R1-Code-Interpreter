    "To determine the symmetry point group of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Composition**: The molecule consists of a central copper (Cu) atom. It is coordinated by two (\"bis\") 2,5-dithiahexane ligands. 2,5-dithiahexane (CH₃-S-CH₂-CH₂-S-CH₃) is a bidentate ligand, meaning it binds to the copper atom at two points (the two sulfur atoms). This creates a 4-coordinate complex.\n\n2.  **Determine the 3D Geometry**: The ligand is flexible and forms a puckered 6-membered ring (Cu-S-C-C-S) upon coordination. This flexible, non-planar nature of the ligand strongly favors a pseudo-tetrahedral arrangement of the four sulfur atoms around the copper center, rather than a rigid square planar geometry.\n\n3.  **Identify Symmetry Elements**: For a tetrahedral complex formed by two identical, symmetric bidentate ligands, we must consider the conformation of the puckered rings. The highest symmetry structure, which is often the most stable, is the *meso* form. In this form, the two puckered chelate rings are mirror images of each other. This idealized structure has the following symmetry elements:\n    *   An **S₄** improper rotation axis (the principal axis). This is the key symmetry element.\n    *   A **C₂** axis that is coincident with the S₄ axis.\n    *   Two **C₂'** axes that are perpendicular to the principal S₄ axis.\n    *   Two **σᏧ** (dihedral) mirror planes that contain the S₄ axis.\n\n4.  **Assign the Point Group**: The unique combination of a principal Sₙ axis (where n is even), n C₂ axes perpendicular to it, and n dihedral mirror planes (σᏧ) defines the **DₙᏧ** point group family. Since the principal axis is S₄ (so n=2, as S₄ relates to C₂), the point group for this molecule is **D₂Ꮷ**.\n\nThe following Python script encapsulates this reasoning and prints the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef get_point_group_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the structure of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper and determines its symmetry point group.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step determination of the point group for bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper:\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the molecule's structure\n    print(\"\\n1.
