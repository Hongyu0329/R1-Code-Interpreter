Based on published structural and functional data for the human CaV beta-1 subunit (UniProt: P54283):

1) Residues from beta-1 subunit for INTERACTION with alpha-1 subunit:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Location: Beta Interaction Domain (BID) on the GK-like domain
Description: Hotspots for direct binding to the alpha-1 subunit (AID-BID interaction).
Residues:
  - Y237: Forms wall of the binding pocket
  - W284: Key hydrophobic anchor for the AID helix
  - M313: Contributes to the hydrophobic pocket
  - F316: Contributes to the hydrophobic pocket
  - I317: Contributes to the hydrophobic pocket
  - Y370: Forms wall of the binding pocket
  - W373: Key hydrophobic anchor for the AID helix
  - M395: Contributes to the hydrophobic pocket
  - A399: Contributes to the hydrophobic pocket


2) Residues from beta-1 subunit for GATING MODULATION of alpha-1 subunit:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Gating modulation is controlled by multiple regions. Key sites for fine-tuning include:

Location: SH3 Domain Surface
Description: This cluster of basic residues on the SH3 domain surface is involved in modulating the kinetics of voltage-dependent inactivation.
Residues:
  - K181: Surface charge modulation
  - R183: Surface charge modulation
  - K185: Surface charge modulation

Location: GK Domain Intramolecular 'beta-ANCHOR' Site
Description: These residues anchor the N-terminus of the beta-1 subunit to its own GK domain. This intramolecular interaction is critical for the specific modulatory effects of the beta-1 subunit on channel gating.
Residues:
  - K377: N-terminus anchor point
  - R469: N-terminus anchor point

Note: The interaction hotspots listed in (1) are also fundamentally required for gating modulation, as binding is a prerequisite for any modulatory effect.
