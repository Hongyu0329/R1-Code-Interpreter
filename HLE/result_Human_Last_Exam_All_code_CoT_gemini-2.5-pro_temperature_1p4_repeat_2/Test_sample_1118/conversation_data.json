    "Here is my plan to answer your question:\n1.  I will first research the specific self-portrait painted by Curt Querner in 1933.\n2.  I will identify the object he is depicted holding in the artwork.\n3.  I will confirm the symbolic meaning of this object in the context of his political persecution and resistance.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that stores this information in variables and prints a clear, descriptive answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol_of_resistance():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.\n    \"\"\"\n    artist = \"Curt Querner\"\n    year = 1933\n    event = \"after having escaped from Gestapo\"\n    symbol = \"a painter's spatula\"\n\n    print(f\"In his self-portrait from the year {year}, painted {event}, {artist} holds {symbol}.\")\n    print(f\"He holds the spatula defiantly, symbolizing that his art is his weapon and his identity as an artist is his form of resistance against the regime.\")\n\nfind_symbol_of_resistance()\n```\n<<<a painter's spatula>>>"
