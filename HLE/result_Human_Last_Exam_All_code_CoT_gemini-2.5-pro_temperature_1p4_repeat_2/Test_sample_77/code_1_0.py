Fluid solvers, especially particle-based ones like FLIP, simulate volume and can struggle with objects that have no thickness. Fluid particles are very likely to pass through, or 'leak' through, the plane as if it weren't there. For a reliable obstacle, the object must have some volume (thickness), even if it's very slight. A better choice would be a very thin cube or a solidified plane.")
