    "To determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric body, we can follow a systematic plan. The problem essentially asks for an analysis of the Schwarzschild metric, which is the solution to the Einstein field equations for this physical situation.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Metric**: The relevant metric is the Schwarzschild metric. In standard spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal. Its components depend only on the radial coordinate `r` and the polar angle `theta`.\n2.  **Recall the Formula**: The Christoffel symbols (of the second kind) are calculated from the metric tensor using the formula:\n    $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\sigma} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\sigma\\mu} - \\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n    where $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is the inverse metric tensor and $\\partial_\\mu$ denotes the partial derivative with respect to the coordinate $x^\\mu$.\n3.  **Automate Calculation**: Given the complexity of the derivatives and summations, using a computer algebra system is the most reliable approach. We will use Python with the `sympy` library to define the metric, compute all the derivatives, and simplify the resulting expressions for each Christoffel symbol.\n4.  **Count Systematically**: The code will iterate through all possible indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ from 0 to 3. Due to the symmetry of the Christoffel symbols in their lower indices ($\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$), we only need to compute the components for $\\mu \\le \\nu$. This gives 40 unique components to check for a 4-dimensional spacetime.\n5.  **Display Results**: The code will identify and print each unique non-zero Christoffel symbol and its formula. It will then provide a final count, broken down by the value of the upper index $\\rho$, to clearly demonstrate how the total is reached.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and counts the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n    This requires the sympy library.
