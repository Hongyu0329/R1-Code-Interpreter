Step 1: The patient's initial symptoms (agitation, insomnia, increased sexual activity, careless spending) and family history of mood disorders strongly suggest a manic episode, characteristic of Bipolar Disorder.

Step 2: The patient was prescribed medication for these symptoms. A first-line treatment for bipolar mania is the mood stabilizer Lithium.

Step 3: After starting treatment, the patient developed a new symptom: decreased interest in sex (sexual dysfunction).

Step 4: A well-known side effect of Lithium is hypothyroidism. One of the primary symptoms of hypothyroidism is decreased libido and sexual dysfunction.

Step 5: This creates the most plausible sequence of events: Manic Episode -> Treatment with Lithium -> Lithium-induced Hypothyroidism -> Sexual Dysfunction. While the occupational history is relevant to the patient's overall health, it does not explain the specific timing and progression of symptoms as well as the iatrogenic (medication-caused) explanation.
