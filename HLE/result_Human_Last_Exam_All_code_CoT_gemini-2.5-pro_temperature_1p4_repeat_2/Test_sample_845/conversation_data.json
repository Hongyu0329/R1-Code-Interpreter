    "The user is asking for the specific name of the value measured between heartbeats, which is the fundamental data point for calculating Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Identify the correct terminology for the time interval between consecutive heartbeats. This value is most commonly referred to as the Inter-Beat Interval (IBI) or, when using an ECG, the R-R interval.\n2.  Create a simple Python script that defines this term.\n3.  The script will then use a `print` function to output a clear sentence explaining that this is the value the user is asking about.\n\n```python\ndef find_hrv_term():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the term used for the time\n    value between heartbeats in HRV analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The value between heartbeats is called the Inter-Beat Interval.\n    term = \"Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)\"\n    \n    # Another common term, specific to ECG, is R-R Interval.\n    # Since the context is general (PPG), IBI is the more appropriate term.\n    \n    # Formulate the answer as a clear sentence.\n    explanation = f\"The value computed between consecutive heartbeats for HRV analysis is called the {term}. It represents the time duration between each beat, typically measured in milliseconds.\"\n    \n    print(explanation)\n\nfind_hrv_term()\n```\n<<<Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    HR and HRV were tracked  by capturing beat-to-beat intervals by using PPG.
