    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of linearly independent commutators of order 10, which can be generated from two elements, X and Y. This quantity is given by Witt's formula for the dimension of the subspace of homogeneous elements of degree `n` in a free Lie algebra on `k` generators.\n\nThe formula is:\n`d(n) = (1/n) * sum_{d|n} (mu(d) * k^(n/d))`\n\nFor our specific case:\n-   `n = 10` (the order of the coefficients).\n-   `k = 2` (the number of generators, X and Y).\n-   `d|n` means `d` is a divisor of `n`.\n-   `mu(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nThe plan is to implement a Python script that performs the following steps:\n1.  Define the parameters `n = 10` and `k = 2`.\n2.  Find all divisors `d` of `n=10`, which are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n3.  For each divisor `d`, calculate the value of the Möbius function `mu(d)`.\n4.  Calculate each term `mu(d) * k^(n/d)` in the summation.\n5.  Sum all the terms and divide by `n` to get the final result.\n6.  The script will print the final equation with all the numbers used in the calculation, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns the prime factorization of a number as a dictionary of {prime: exponent}.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp_num = num\n    while d * d <= temp_num:\n        while (temp_num % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp_num //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp_num > 1:\n       factors[temp_num] = factors.get(temp_num, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Möbius function mu(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    \n    # If any prime factor is squared, mu(n) is 0\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n            \n    # Otherwise, it's (-1)^k where k is the number of distinct prime factors\n    if len(factors) % 2 == 1:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return 1\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all divisors of a number.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef calculate_bch_coefficients():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients for a given order in the\n    BCH expansion using Witt's formula and prints the detailed calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10  # Order\n    k = 2   # Number of generators (X and Y)\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the number of nonzero BCH coefficients of order n={n} for k={k} generators.\")\n    print(\"Using Witt's formula: d(n) = (1/n) * sum over d|n of (mu(d) * k^(n/d))\")\n    \n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    print(f\"\\nThe divisors 'd' of n={n} are: {divisors}\\n\")\n    \n    terms = []\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Calculate each term in the summation\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power_val = k**(n // d)\n        term = mu_d * power_val\n        terms.append(term)\n        total_sum += term\n        \n    print(\"The final equation and its step-by-step evaluation is:\")\n    \n    # 1.
