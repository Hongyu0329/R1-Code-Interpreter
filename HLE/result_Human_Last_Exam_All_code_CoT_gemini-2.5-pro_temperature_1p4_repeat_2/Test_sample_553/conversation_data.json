    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a music theory question that can be broken down logically. While the song doesn't literally start with the first two chords being this progression, the most famous and definitive example of this specific harmonic device in The Beatles' catalog is found in one particular song.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will identify the song that contains this specific and notable chord progression.\n2.  I will then use a Python script to define the musical key of that song.\n3.  The script will programmatically determine the \"tonic\" chord (the I chord) and the \"minor fifth\" chord (the v chord) based on the notes of the key.\n4.  Finally, the script will print out the name of the song and the specific chord progression, including the roman numerals as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_beatles_chord_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the Beatles song with a prominent jump from the\n    tonic (I) chord to the minor fifth (v) chord. It breaks down the music\n    theory behind the progression.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1. The song in question is \"Michelle\". It's in the key of F major.\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    key = \"F Major\"\n    scale_notes = [\"F\", \"G\", \"A\", \"Bâ™­\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\"]\n    \n    # 2. The \"tonic\" is the first degree of the scale. The chord built on it is the I chord.\n    tonic_degree_numeral = \"I\"\n    tonic_root_note = scale_notes[0]\n    tonic_chord_name = f\"{tonic_root_note} major\"\n    \n    # 3. The \"fifth\" is the fifth degree of the scale. A \"minor fifth chord\"\n    # is a minor chord built on this note, making it a \"v\" chord (lowercase).\n    # This is a \"borrowed\" chord, as the natural chord on the fifth degree in a major key is major (V).\n    fifth_degree_numeral = \"v\"\n    fifth_root_note = scale_notes[4]\n    minor_fifth_chord_name = f\"{fifth_root_note} minor\"\n    \n    # 4. Print the explanation and the final answer.\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that famously uses a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThis progression occurs in the key of {key}.\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe tonic chord (represented by the Roman numeral '{tonic_degree_numeral}') is {tonic_chord_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The minor fifth chord (represented by the Roman numeral '{fifth_degree_numeral}') is {minor_fifth_chord_name}.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nWhile the song doesn't start with this exact jump, it's a defining feature of its bridge section ('Until I find a way...').\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final 'equation' for the chord jump is:\")\n    print(f\"{tonic_degree_numeral} -> {fifth_degree_numeral}\")\n\n# Execute the function to solve the puzzle.\nsolve_beatles_chord_puzzle()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
