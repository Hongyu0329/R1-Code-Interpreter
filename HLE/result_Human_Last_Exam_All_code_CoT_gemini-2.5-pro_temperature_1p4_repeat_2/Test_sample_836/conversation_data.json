    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function in nuclear criticality is a fundamental quantity used in reactor noise analysis. It transforms the correlation between two particle detection events from the space-time domain $(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ to the wavevector-frequency domain $(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$.\n\nThis transformed quantity is most commonly called the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** of the neutron noise. It represents the contribution of fluctuations at a specific temporal frequency ($\\omega$) and spatial mode (represented by wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$) to the overall variance of the neutron population. The shape of the PSD provides crucial information about the kinetic parameters of the nuclear system, such as the prompt neutron decay constant (Rossi-alpha), which is vital for assessing the system's subcriticality.\n\nThe following Python code defines and calculates the Power Spectral Density for a simplified case based on one-group neutron diffusion theory without delayed neutrons. This model results in a characteristic Lorentzian shape for the PSD as a function of frequency. The code calculates the PSD for a given set of reactor parameters, wavevector `k`, and angular frequency `omega`, and prints out the calculation step-by-step as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_neutron_noise_psd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of neutron noise for a\n    simplified one-group diffusion model.\n\n    The generalized pair correlation function C(r, t) describes the correlation\n    between neutron events separated in space r and time t.
