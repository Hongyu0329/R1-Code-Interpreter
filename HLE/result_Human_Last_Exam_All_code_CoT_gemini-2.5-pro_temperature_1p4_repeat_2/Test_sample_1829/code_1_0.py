# The statements' truth values are determined by logic.
S1_truth_value = True # "if False then Q" is always True.
S5_truth_value = False # A self-contradictory statement.
S4_truth_value = False # If S4 were true, S3 would also be true, violating the "only one is true" rule.
S3_truth_value = False # Since S1 is the one true statement.

# The puzzle contains a paradox: a mix of true and false statements
# cannot be uttered by a classic knight/knave figure.
# The resolution lies in interpreting S1 as self-referential,
# pointing to the day that creates the paradox.
# S1: "If I am lying, then today is Wednesday."

# Analysis:
# If the lying day is Wednesday, the statement becomes "True -> True", which is TRUE.
# A liar cannot say a true statement. So the lying day cannot be Wednesday without a paradox.
# If the lying day is NOT Wednesday, the statement is "True -> False", which is FALSE.
# A liar CAN say a false statement.
# The statement S1 is identified as the single true statement in the problem.
# For the puzzle to be consistent, the statement "If I am lying, then today is Wednesday" MUST be true.
# This happens under two conditions:
# 1. He is on a truth day (the premise "I am lying" is false, making the conditional true).
# 2. He is on his lying day, AND that day is Wednesday.
# But he cannot speak a truth on his lying day. This paradox makes Wednesday unique.
# It is Fred's lying day.

lying_day = "Wednesday"
truth_days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]

# The question is "Which day does Fred say the truth?".
# This is ambiguously phrased, as there are 6 such days.
# In these types of puzzles, the answer is the unique day identified by the logic.
# The unique day is the Lying Day. Let's assume the question implicitly asks for this special day.
# However, to directly answer the question as stated, any of the 6 days would be correct.
# Given the multiple choice format, we select the day mentioned in the paradoxical statement.
# The core logic points to Wednesday as the key. Let's assume there is a mistake in the question's
# phrasing and it should be "what is the lying day". Or that the Truth day in question is the one
# referenced in the statements. The problem logic makes Wednesday the only answer that can be deduced.

# Let's consider the statements were made on Wednesday. Fred tells lies on Wednesday.
# S1: 'My name is Fred; and if yesterday was after tomorrow, it would be Wednesday.' This is a true statement.
# As Fred only tells lies on Wednesday, he cannot make this statement on Wednesday.
# Thus, he must have made this statement on a day he tells the truth.
# As S1 is the only true statement, S1 refers to the day Fred tells the truth. S1 refers to Wednesday.
