    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we can use the classification of finite crystallographic Coxeter groups. A finite Weyl group is either irreducible (if its Dynkin diagram is connected) or a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups (if its diagram is disconnected). The rank of the group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  List the number of irreducible Weyl groups for each rank from 1 to 4. Note that the Weyl groups for B_n and C_n are isomorphic, so we count them as a single type.\n    *   **Rank 1:** A_1 (1 group)\n    *   **Rank 2:** A_2, B_2, G_2 (3 groups)\n    *   **Rank 3:** A_3, B_3 (2 groups)\n    *   **Rank 4:** A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4 (4 groups)\n2.  Find all integer partitions of 4. These partitions represent the possible ways to combine ranks of irreducible components to get a total rank of 4.\n    *   `{4}`: An irreducible group of rank 4.\n    *   `{3, 1}`: A product of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group.\n    *   `{2, 2}`: A product of two rank 2 groups.\n    *   `{2, 1, 1}`: A product of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    *   `{1, 1, 1, 1}`: A product of four rank 1 groups.\n3.  For each partition, calculate the number of distinct groups that can be formed. If a partition has repeated parts (e.g., `{2, 2}`), we must use combinations with replacement to count correctly.\n4.  Sum the counts for all partitions to get the total number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nThe following Python script automates this counting process.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef combinations_with_replacement(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n types,\n    with replacement allowed.
