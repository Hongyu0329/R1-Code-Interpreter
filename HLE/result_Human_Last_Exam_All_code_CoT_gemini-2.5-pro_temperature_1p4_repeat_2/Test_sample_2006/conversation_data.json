    "This is a riddle hidden within a haiku. Here is my step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Haiku**: I'll break down each line of the haiku to find the numbers and operations it represents.\n    *   \"The Bays\": The title is a question. It sounds like a pun for \"The Base,\" referring to a number base.\n    *   \"An August tempest\": \"August\" is the 8th month, giving us the number 8. A \"tempest\" is a violent storm, hinting at a subtraction operation.\n    *   \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\": \"Twice fifteen\" is `2 * 15`, which gives us the digits 30. The phrase \"winds of change\" suggests that this number needs to be re-interpreted through a \"change of base\".\n    *   \"A divine one yields\": \"Yields\" means \"equals,\" and \"a divine one\" is the number 1. This sets the result of the equation to 1.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation**: Based on the deconstruction, I will form an algebraic equation. Let 'b' be the unknown base we need to find.\n    *   The equation is: `(Value of \"30\" in base b) - 8 = 1`.\n    *   The value of a number \"30\" in a base 'b' is calculated as `(3 * b^1) + (0 * b^0)`, which simplifies to `3 * b`.\n\n3.  **Solve for the Base**: I will solve the equation `3 * b - 8 = 1`.\n    *   `3 * b = 9`\n    *   `b = 3`\n    *   So, the unknown base is 3.\n\n4.  **Find the Final Answer**: The question asks for the answer in alphabetical order. The 3rd letter of the alphabet is 'C'. The script below will perform these calculations and print the final, solved equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_haiku_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle presented in the haiku.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Extract numbers and operators from the haiku's text.\n    # \"An August tempest\" gives the number 8. \"tempest\" suggests subtraction.\n    term_2 = 8\n    # \"A divine one yields\" gives the result 1. \"yields\" means equals.\n    result = 1\n    # \"Twice fifteen\" gives the digits 3 and 0.\n    # The title \"The Bays\" is a pun for \"The Base\". The phrase \"winds of change\"\n    # implies we must interpret the digits \"30\" in an unknown base 'b'.\n    # The equation is: (value of \"30\" in base 'b') - 8 = 1\n    \n    # Step 2: Solve for the unknown base 'b'.\n    # The equation is: 3*b - 8 = 1\n    # 3*b = 8 + 1\n    # 3*b = 9\n    # b = 9 / 3\n    base = 3\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the value of the first term using the solved base.\n    # The value of \"30\" in base 3 is (3 * 3^1) + (0 * 3^0)\n    term_1 = 3 * base**1 + 0 * base**0\n    \n    # Step 4: The final answer to \"The Bays\" (The Base) is 3.\n    # In alphabetical order, the 3rd letter is C.\n    \n    print(\"The riddle describes an equation in an unknown number base.\")\n    print(\"Solving '3 * base - 8 = 1' reveals the base is 3.\")\n    print(\"The question 'The Bays' is a pun for 'The Base', so the answer is 3, which is 'C' in alphabetical order.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation using the discovered base is:\")\n    print(f\"{int(term_1)} - {term_2} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_haiku_riddle()\n<<<C>>>\n```"
