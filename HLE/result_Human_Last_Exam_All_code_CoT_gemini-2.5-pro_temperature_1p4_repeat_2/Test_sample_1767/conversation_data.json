    "When two topological systems, such as Chern insulators, are brought together to form a combined system, the topological invariant of the new system is the sum of the invariants of the individual components. This is known as the additivity of the Chern number.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n*   Chern insulator 1 with Chern number `C1 = 1`.\n*   Chern insulator 2 with Chern number `C2 = 1`.\n\nThe Chern number of the combined system (the junction) is `C_total = C1 + C2`. This total Chern number corresponds to the number of net chiral edge states that will appear at the outer boundary of the combined system.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to calculate this sum and display the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern number for each of the two Chern insulators.\nchern_number_1 = 1\nchern_number_2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of a composite system is the sum of the Chern numbers\n# of its individual parts.\ntotal_chern_number = chern_number_1 + chern_number_2\n\n# Print the explanation and the final equation.\nprint(\"The Chern number of the junction formed by two Chern insulators is the sum of their individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(f\"C_total = C1 + C2\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {chern_number_1} + {chern_number_2} = {total_chern_number}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
