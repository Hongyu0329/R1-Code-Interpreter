# The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a space X
# with specific properties.
#
# Let X be a compact connected metric space.
# Let C_n(X) be the n-th configuration space of X, which is the set of n-tuples
# of distinct points from X.
# The problem states that for some n >= 2, C_n(X) is disconnected.
#
# The solution follows these logical steps:
# 1. A key theorem in topology (PantiÄ‡, 2018) states that if a compact,
#    connected, Hausdorff space X has a disconnected n-th configuration space
#    for some n >= 2, then X must be an orderable space. A metric space is
#    Hausdorff, so this applies.
#
# 2. A classical theorem (Brouwer, ~1910) states that any non-degenerate,
#    compact, connected, orderable metric space is homeomorphic to the
#    closed interval [0,1].
#
# 3. Combining these results, any space X satisfying the given conditions
#    must be homeomorphic to the interval [0,1].
#
# 4. Since all such spaces are homeomorphic to each other, they all belong
#    to a single homeomorphism class.
#
# 5. Therefore, the number of distinct homeomorphism classes is 1.

number_of_homeomorphism_classes = 1
