    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the problem**: The problem asks for the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ that has $n=12345$ vertices and is not a complete graph.\n2.  **Recall Graph Theory Principles**: The key theorem is that for a graph with $n$ vertices, its chromatic number $\\chi(G) = n$ if and only if the graph is a complete graph, $K_n$.\n3.  **Apply the Principle**: The problem states that the graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph. Therefore, its chromatic number must be strictly less than the number of vertices, $n$. This gives us an upper bound: $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$. For $n=12345$, this means $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n4.  **Verify Attainability**: To confirm that $n-1$ is the maximum possible value, we need to show that there exists at least one non-complete graph on $n$ vertices with a chromatic number of $n-1$. A simple example is a graph constructed from a complete graph $K_{n-1}$ by adding one more vertex that is completely disconnected from all other vertices (an isolated vertex). This graph has $n$ vertices, is not complete, and requires $n-1$ colors for a proper coloring (since its $K_{n-1}$ subgraph requires $n-1$ colors).\n5.  **Conclusion**: Since the chromatic number cannot exceed $n-1$ and we have found a case where it equals $n-1$, the maximum number of colors required is $n-1$.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to perform the calculation $12345 - 1$ and print the reasoning along with the final equation and result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors for a proper vertex coloring of a graph G\n    with 12345 vertices, given that G is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_vertices = 12345\n\n    # A fundamental theorem in graph theory states that for a graph with n vertices,\n    # its chromatic number (the minimum number of colors for a proper coloring)\n    # is equal to n if and only if the graph is a complete graph (K_n),\n    # where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\n    # The problem specifies that the graph G is not a complete graph.\n    # Therefore, its chromatic number must be less than the total number of vertices.\n    max_colors = num_vertices - 1\n\n    print(\"Let n be the number of vertices in the graph G.\")\n    print(f\"Given n = {num_vertices}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe problem states that the graph G is not a complete graph.\")\n    print(\"\\nA key result from graph theory states that the chromatic number of a graph with n vertices, Ï‡(G),\")\n    print(\"is equal to n if and only if G is the complete graph K_n.\")\n    print(\"\\nSince G is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be strictly less than n.\")\n    print(f\"This means the maximum possible chromatic number is n - 1.\")\n    print(\"\\nTo confirm this maximum is achievable, consider a graph formed by a complete subgraph K_{n-1} and one isolated vertex.\")\n    print(f\"This graph has {num_vertices} vertices, is not complete, and requires {max_colors} colors to be properly colored.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, we calculate the maximum number of colors needed as:\")\n    print(f\"{num_vertices} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe maximum number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of G properly is {max_colors}.\")\n\nsolve_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
