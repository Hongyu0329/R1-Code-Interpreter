The problem describes a situation that contradicts a simple Modus Tollens argument.
Initial Argument:
  P → Q (If intruder, then bark)
  ¬Q (No bark)
  ∴ ¬P (No intruder)

Contradictory Fact: We know P (intruder detected) and ¬Q (no bark) are both true.
This means the initial premise P → Q is too simple and must be false in this context.

We need a new logical structure that explains how P and ¬Q can be true simultaneously.

Analysis of Answer C:
This option introduces a third proposition, R, to create a more nuanced and logical explanation for the events.

  P: The dog detects an intruder.
  Q: The dog barked.
  R: The dog was asleep.

The proposed logical argument is: [(P ∧ ¬R)→Q] ∧ (¬Q ∧ P),∴R

Let's validate this argument:
1.  New Premise: (P ∧ ¬R)→Q. This translates to: "If the dog detects an intruder AND is not asleep, THEN it will bark." This is a highly plausible condition. A dog, even if trained, would not bark if it were asleep.

2.  Factual Premise: (¬Q ∧ P). This translates to: "The dog did not bark AND the dog detected an intruder." This matches the verifiable proof.

3.  Conclusion: ∴R. This translates to: "Therefore, the dog was asleep."

This deduction is logically sound. Here is the proof:
  - We are given (¬Q ∧ P), so we know that ¬Q is true and P is true.
  - We can apply Modus Tollens to the premise [(P ∧ ¬R)→Q] using ¬Q.
  - This allows us to conclude the negation of the antecedent: ¬(P ∧ ¬R).
  - Using De Morgan's laws, ¬(P ∧ ¬R) is logically equivalent to (¬P ∨ R).
  - We now have two true statements: (¬P ∨ R) and P.
  - This is a Disjunctive Syllogism. Since P is true, ¬P must be false. For (¬P ∨ R) to be true, R must be true.

The conclusion 'R' (The dog was asleep) logically resolves the puzzle and is supported by other evidence (the dog being blind and deaf, and the intruder being stealthy, could explain why it wasn't woken up).
