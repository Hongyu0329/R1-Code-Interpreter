    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the string comparison problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\nMy plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  Read the two input strings provided by the user.\n2.  Convert both strings to a common case (lowercase) to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive as required.\n3.  Compare the two new lowercase strings lexicographically.\n4.  Print \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller, \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically larger, and \"0\" if they are equal.\n\nFollowing this plan, here is a Python script that accomplishes the task.\n\n```python\ndef compare_strings():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads two strings, compares them case-insensitively, and prints the result.\n    -1 if the first is less than the second.\n    1 if the first is greater than the second.\n    0 if they are equal.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Read the first string from input\n        s1 = input()\n        # Read the second string from input\n        s2 = input()\n\n        # Convert both strings to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\n        s1_lower = s1.lower()\n        s2_lower = s2.lower()\n\n        # Perform the lexicographical comparison\n        if s1_lower < s2_lower:\n            print(\"-1\")\n        elif s1_lower > s2_lower:\n            print(\"1\")\n        else:\n            print(\"0\")\n\n    except EOFError:\n        # Handle cases where input is not provided as expected\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    compare_strings()\n\n```\nTo calculate `m`, the total memory in bytes for the most memory-efficient C program, we need to design a C program that minimizes variable storage. Such a program would avoid storing the second string entirely. It would read the first string into a buffer and then read the second string character by character, comparing as it goes.\n\nThe variables required for this C program would be:\n*   A character array to store the first string: `char s1[101]`. Given the maximum length of 100, we need 101 bytes for the characters and the null terminator (`sizeof(char)` is 1 byte).\n*   An integer to use as an index for the first string's array: `int i`. On a typical system, `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes.\n*   An integer to store the character being read from the second string. We use `int` because the `getchar()` function returns an `int` to accommodate the special `EOF` value: `int c`. This takes 4 bytes.\n\nThe total memory usage `m` is the sum of the memory used by these variables:\nm = (size of s1) + (size of i) + (size of c)\nm = 101 bytes + 4 bytes + 4 bytes\nm = 109 bytes\n\n<<<109>>>"
