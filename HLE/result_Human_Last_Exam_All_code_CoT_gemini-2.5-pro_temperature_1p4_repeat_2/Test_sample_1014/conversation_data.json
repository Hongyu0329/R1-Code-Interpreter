    "Of course. Here is a plan to find the largest prime divisor, followed by the Python code to execute the plan.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Start with the number:** The number we need to factor is 8139881.\n2.  **Trial Division:** I will implement a prime factorization algorithm called trial division.\n    *   I'll start checking for divisibility with the smallest prime, 2.\n    *   Then, I'll proceed with odd numbers (3, 5, 7, ...) as potential divisors.\n    *   For each potential divisor `d`, I will check if it divides the current number. If it does, I'll add `d` to our list of factors and divide the number by `d` repeatedly until it's no longer divisible.\n    *   This process continues as long as the square of the potential divisor `d` is less than or equal to the number. This is an optimization because if there's a factor larger than the square root, there must be a corresponding factor smaller than it, which we would have already found.\n3.  **Find the Largest Factor:** After the loop finishes, if the remaining value of our number is greater than 1, it means the number itself is prime or the remaining part is a prime factor. This will be the largest prime factor.\n4.  **Format the Output:** The script will print the complete prime factorization in the format `N = p1 * p2 * ...` and then provide the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the prime divisors of 8139881, prints the factorization equation,\n    and identifies the largest prime divisor.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 8139881\n    original_n = n\n    factors = []\n    \n    # Handle the factor 2 if the number is even\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n //= 2\n        \n    # Handle odd factors from 3 upwards\n    # We only need to check up to the square root of n\n    limit = int(math.sqrt(n))\n    for i in range(3, limit + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n //= i\n            # Update the limit as n gets smaller\n            limit = int(math.sqrt(n))\n            \n    # If n is still greater than 1 after all divisions, \n    # the remaining n must be a prime factor itself.\n    if n > 1:\n        factors.append(n)\n        \n    # If the number was prime, factors list will be empty until now\n    if not factors:\n        factors.append(original_n)\n\n    # Print the full factorization equation\n    print(f\"{original_n} = {' * '.join(map(str, factors))}\")\n    \n    # The largest prime divisor is the last or maximum element in the list\n    largest_prime = max(factors)\n    return largest_prime\n\n# Run the function and get the result\nlargest_divisor = find_largest_prime_divisor()\n# The final answer is submitted in the special format below\n# The equation is printed by the function itself.\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe largest prime divisor is: {largest_divisor}\")\n```\n<<<8139881>>>"
