    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this task:\n1.  First, I will analyze the provided words (`utpshtheas`, `fkuhu`, `numhkatnatu`) to identify the encoding pattern. The most likely pattern is a simple substitution cipher where each letter is replaced by another letter based on a consistent rule. A Caesar cipher is a good candidate.\n2.  I will test the hypothesis that the pattern is a Caesar cipher with a shift of -1, meaning each letter is replaced by the previous letter in the alphabet (e.g., 'b' becomes 'a', and 'a' wraps around to 'z').\n3.  Once the pattern is confirmed, I will create a Python script to decode the final word, `anhaeketn`.\n4.  As requested, the script will not only perform the decoding but also explicitly show the numerical calculation for each character's transformation, illustrating the \"final equation\" for each step.\n5.  Finally, the script will print the fully decoded word.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute the plan:\n\n```python\ndef decode_and_explain(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Decodes a word by shifting each character one position back in the alphabet ('a' becomes 'z').\n    It also prints the equation for each character's transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n    decoded_word = \"\"\n    print(f\"Decoding the word: '{word}'\")\n    print(\"The pattern is a Caesar cipher with a shift of -1.\")\n    print(\"The equation for each letter is: new_letter = chr(ord(original_letter) - 1)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    final_equation_parts = []\n\n    for char in word:\n        original_ord = ord(char)\n        if char == 'a':\n            # Handle wraparound for 'a'\n            decoded_char = 'z'\n            new_ord = ord('z')\n        else:\n            decoded_char = chr(original_ord - 1)\n            new_ord = original_ord - 1\n        \n        # Build the visual equation for each character\n        equation_step = f\"{char}({original_ord}) - 1 = {decoded_char}({new_ord})\"\n        print(equation_step)\n        \n        decoded_word += decoded_char\n        final_equation_parts.append(f\"{decoded_char}\")\n        \n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Final decoded word:\")\n    print(decoded_word)\n    \n    # Per the instruction \"output each number in the final equation!\", we print the components.\n    # We will show the final decoded letters which result from the equations.\n    print(\"\\nLetters in the final decoded word from each equation:\")\n    print(\" -> \".join(final_equation_parts))\n\n# The word to be decoded\nword_to_decode = \"anhaeketn\"\n\n# Run the decoding process\ndecode_and_explain(word_to_decode)\n```\n<<<zmgzdjdsdms>>>"
