    # Statement A: Correct. The "segregation of facts" is defined recursively
    # based on an ordered multiset of constants C_P, where the order is
    # determined by the "order of appearance in the program P". A Datalog
    # program is a set of rules and facts, which has no inherent order.
    # Therefore, the definition is ambiguous and order-dependent.
    statement_A_is_correct = True

    # Statement B: Incorrect. The statement questions the identity gamma[gamma^-1[P]] = P.
    # Let's trace the operations. gamma^-1[P] generates a set of programs {P'} by
    # replacing constants 'c' in P with 'c'' from its pre-image. By definition of the
    # pre-image, gamma(c') = c. When gamma is applied to any P', it replaces
    # all such constants c' back with gamma(c') = c, restoring the original program P.
    # Thus, gamma[gamma^-1[P]] results in a set containing only P. The identity holds.
    statement_B_is_correct = False

    # Statement C: Correct. This statement describes the composition gamma^-1[gamma[P]].
    # The gamma operator is many-to-one, meaning it can map multiple distinct
    # constants to a single constant (e.g., gamma(c1)=c, gamma(c2)=c). This is an
    # irreversible loss of information. Applying gamma^-1 to gamma[P] would not
    # uniquely determine whether to restore 'c' to 'c1' or 'c2'. Thus,
    # gamma^-1[gamma[P]] would not be identical to P in general.
    statement_C_is_correct = True

    # Statement D: Correct. It highlights the ambiguity in the definition for
    # segregating a set of facts, gamma^-1[S_0]. The recursive definition for P_{k+1}
    # involves a union and operates on P_k, which itself becomes a set of programs
    # after the first step. The notation for applying a replacement to a set of
    # programs is not specified, making the process and its outcome unclear.
    statement_D_is_correct = True

    # Statement E: Correct. This provides an accurate conceptual interpretation of the
    # main claim. The conditions gamma[P]=P and gamma[S_0]=S_0 mean the program
    # and facts are at a "stable level of granularity". The equation states that
    # the result of refining (gamma^-1), inferring, and coarsening (gamma) is identical
    # to simply inferring on the stable, coarse-grained level. This captures the essence of the claim.
