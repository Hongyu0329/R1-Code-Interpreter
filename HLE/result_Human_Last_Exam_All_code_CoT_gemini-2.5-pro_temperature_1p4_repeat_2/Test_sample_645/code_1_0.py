I will determine which of the subsets S have the property based on the following criterion from the theory of power series:

A set of indices S can support a power series f(z) = sum_{n in S} a_n * z^n that converges everywhere on the closed unit disk (|z| <= 1) but does not converge absolutely for |z|=1 if and only if the set S satisfies two conditions:
1. The sum of the reciprocals of its elements diverges: sum_{n in S} 1/n = infinity. This condition ensures the set is "dense" enough to construct a series with non-absolute convergence (i.e., where sum |a_n| = infinity is possible).
2. The sum of the squared reciprocals of its elements converges: sum_{n in S} 1/n^2 < infinity. This condition ensures the set is "sparse" enough to guarantee that a series can be constructed which converges to a continuous function on the unit circle, and thus converges everywhere on the disk.

I will now check each of the four sets against this two-part criterion. The Python code below will generate terms from each set and compute the partial sums to numerically verify the theoretical analysis.
