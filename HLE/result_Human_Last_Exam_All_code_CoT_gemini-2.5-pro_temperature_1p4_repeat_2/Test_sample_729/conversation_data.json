    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I'll identify the structure of the generalized quaternion group of size 128, which is denoted as $Q_{128}$. The presentation of this group is $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n2.  I'll clarify that a \"power subgroup\" is another term for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element.\n3.  I'll categorize the cyclic subgroups of $Q_{128}$ into two disjoint sets:\n    a. Cyclic subgroups that are contained within the subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n    b. Cyclic subgroups that are generated by elements of the form $x^i y$.\n4.  For the first category, I'll calculate the number of cyclic subgroups of $\\langle x \\rangle$. Since $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64, the number of its subgroups is equal to the number of divisors of 64, denoted by $\\tau(64)$. I'll write a simple function to compute this.\n5.  For the second category, I'll determine the number of distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $x^i y$. I'll show that all these elements have an order of 4 and that the 64 elements of this form generate $64/2 = 32$ distinct subgroups.\n6.  Finally, since these two categories of subgroups are disjoint, I'll sum their counts to get the total number of power subgroups. The code will print out this step-by-step reasoning and the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of divisors of a positive integer n, denoted tau(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # If divisors are different, count both\n            if n / i == i:\n                count += 1\n            else:\n                count += 2\n    return count\n\ndef solve_q128_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of power subgroups in the\n    generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted Q_128, has the presentation:\")\n    print(\"<x, y | x^64 = 1, x^32 = y^2, y^-1*x*y = x^-1>\")\n    print(\"\\nA 'power subgroup' is a cyclic subgroup, i.e., a subgroup generated by a single element.\")\n    print(\"To find the number of power subgroups, we count the number of distinct cyclic subgroups.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"We can partition the cyclic subgroups into two types:\")\n    print(\"1.
