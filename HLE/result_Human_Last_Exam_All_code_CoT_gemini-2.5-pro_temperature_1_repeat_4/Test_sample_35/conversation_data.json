    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct hand to shove all-in.\n\n**1. Understand the Scenario:**\n*   **Position:** UTG+1 (Under The Gun + 1) is an early position. Ranges from here should be relatively tight, as many players are left to act behind you.\n*   **Stack Size:** 16 big blinds (bb) is a classic \"shove-or-fold\" stack. It's generally not deep enough to raise and then fold to a 3-bet.\n*   **Game State:** \"Near the money bubble\" is the most critical factor. This creates high ICM (Independent Chip Model) pressure. Players with medium or large stacks will call your all-in with a much tighter range than usual because they want to avoid busting before the very short stacks. This means your all-in has high \"fold equity\" (the chance your opponents fold).\n\n**2. Define a Shoving Range:**\nA standard, solid shoving range for 16bb from UTG+1, especially considering the increased fold equity on the bubble, would include strong pairs and high-card combinations. A typical range is `88+` (the pairs 88 through AA) and strong Aces like `AJs+` (AJ suited, AQ suited, AK suited) and `AQo+` (AQ offsuit, AK offsuit). Marginal hands like QJs or AJo are often too weak from this early position, as you will be dominated when called.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options:**\nI will write a Python script to check which of the given hands fall into this standard shoving range.\n\n*   **A. QJs (Queen-Jack suited):** This hand is generally too weak to shove from UTG+1. It's a profitable shove from later positions, but not from this early.\n*   **C. 99 (Pocket Nines):** This is a strong pair. It falls squarely within the `88+` portion of our range. It's a clear and profitable shove.\n*   **D. AJo (Ace-Jack offsuit):** This hand is often dominated by the hands that would call a 16bb shove (e.g., AQ, AK, TT+). It's typically excluded from a UTG+1 range, falling just below the `AQo+` threshold.\n*   **E. AKo (Ace-King offsuit):** This is a premium hand. It's one of the strongest starting hands in poker and is an easy, automatic shove in this situation. It dominates other Ax hands and has excellent equity against pairs.\n\n**4. Conclusion from Analysis:**\nBoth `99` and `AKo` are correct hands to shove in this situation according to standard poker strategy. However, multiple-choice questions usually have a single best answer. While both are profitable, `AKo` is a premium hand that performs better against a typical calling range and is one of the most unambiguous and powerful hands you can shove with here.\n\n```python\ndef solve_poker_shove():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a poker hand scenario to determine the correct all-in action.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
