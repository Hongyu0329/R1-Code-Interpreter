    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Explain the Principle:** I will start by explaining the fundamental concept of how logical qubits are created in a surface code. The number of logical qubits (`k`) that can be encoded in a single patch of surface code is determined by the number of topological features called \"holes\" (`h`) within that patch. The relationship is simple: `k = h`.\n2.  **Analyze the Configuration:** The problem describes a system with two separate patches of surface code and a total of two holes distributed among them.\n3.  **Calculate the Total:** The total number of logical qubits in the system is the sum of the logical qubits from each individual patch. Since the number of logical qubits per patch equals its number of holes, the total number of logical qubits for the entire system equals the total number of holes.\n4.  **Demonstrate with Code:** I will write a Python script that defines the given parameters (number of patches and holes) and calculates the result. The script will also explicitly show the two possible scenarios for distributing the holes to prove that the maximum number of logical qubits is constant.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_logical_qubits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits for a given surface code configuration.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of holes available in the system.\n    total_holes = 2\n    # Total number of separate surface code patches.\n    num_patches = 2\n\n    print(\"The number of logical qubits (k) in a single patch of surface code is equal to the number of holes (h) it contains.\")\n    print(\"Formula per patch: k = h\\n\")\n\n    # The total number of logical qubits is the sum of logical qubits from all patches,\n    # which is equal to the total number of holes in the system.\n    total_logical_qubits = total_holes\n\n    print(f\"With {num_patches} patches and a total of {total_holes} holes, the total number of logical qubits is {total_logical_qubits}.\")\n    print(\"This holds true regardless of how the holes are distributed. For example:\\n\")\n\n    # Scenario 1: One hole in each of the two patches.\n    patch1_holes_s1 = 1\n    patch2_holes_s1 = 1\n    total_qubits_s1 = patch1_holes_s1 + patch2_holes_s1\n    print(\"Scenario 1 (1 hole per patch):\")\n    print(f\"Logical Qubits = (Qubits in Patch 1) + (Qubits in Patch 2)\")\n    print(f\"                 = {patch1_holes_s1} + {patch2_holes_s1} = {total_qubits_s1}\\n\")\n\n    # Scenario 2: Both holes in one patch.\n    patch1_holes_s2 = 2\n    patch2_holes_s2 = 0\n    total_qubits_s2 = patch1_holes_s2 + patch2_holes_s2\n    print(\"Scenario 2 (2 holes in one patch):\")\n    print(f\"Logical Qubits = (Qubits in Patch 1) + (Qubits in Patch 2)\")\n    print(f\"                 = {patch1_holes_s2} + {patch2_holes_s2} = {total_qubits_s2}\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Therefore, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is {total_logical_qubits}.\")\n\ncalculate_logical_qubits()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
