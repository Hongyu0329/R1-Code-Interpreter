    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization of the Conductor:** First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n2.  **Condition for Primitive Characters:** A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if it is not induced by a character of a smaller modulus dividing $d$. When the conductor $d$ is a square-free integer, say $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$ (a product of distinct primes), a character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a *non-principal* character modulo the prime factor $p_i$. Our given $d=53599$ is indeed square-free.\n3.  **Order of the Character:** The order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its constituent characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_k))$. We are given that the order must be $g=6$.\n4.  **Counting Using Inclusion-Exclusion:** The group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $p-1$. The number of characters of a specific order $o$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(o)$, provided that $o$ divides $p-1$.\n    To find the number of character tuples $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_k)$ whose orders have an lcm of 6, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion (which is equivalent to Mobius inversion on the divisor lattice of 6).\n    Let $S(j)$ be the number of tuples of non-principal characters $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_k)$ such that the order of each $\\chi_i$ divides $j$. This can be calculated as:\n    $S(j) = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} (\\gcd(j, p_i - 1) - 1)$\n    The \"-1\" accounts for excluding the principal character (order 1).\n    The number of characters with order exactly 6 is then given by the formula:\n    $N = \\sum_{j|6} \\mu(6/j) S(j)$\n    where $\\mu$ is the Mobius function. For $g=6$, the divisors are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The formula becomes:\n    $N = \\mu(6)S(1) + \\mu(3)S(2) + \\mu(2)S(3) + \\mu(1)S(6)$\n    $N = (1)S(1) + (-1)S(2) + (-1)S(3) + (1)S(6)$\n5.  **Execution:** The Python code below will implement this plan by first finding the prime factors of $d$, then computing $S(j)$ for each divisor $j$ of 6, and finally applying the formula to get the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a sorted list of all divisors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    divs = {1}\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    primes = list(factors.keys())\n    \n    def generate(k, current_div):\n        if k == len(primes):\n            divs.add(current_div)\n            return\n        \n        p = primes[k]\n        for i in range(factors[p] + 1):\n            generate(k + 1, current_div * (p**i))\n\n    generate(0, 1)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef mobius_mu(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Mobius mu function for n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters for a given\n    conductor d and order g.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    g = 6\n\n    # Step 1: Find prime factorization of d\n    d_factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    primes = list(d_factors.keys())\n    \n    # Check if d is square-free\n    is_square_free = all(exp == 1 for exp in d_factors.values())\n    if not is_square_free:\n        print(f\"Conductor d={d} is not square-free.
