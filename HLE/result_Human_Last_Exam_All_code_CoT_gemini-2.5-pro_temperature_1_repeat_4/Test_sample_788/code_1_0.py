# This script calculates the number of equivalence classes based on the algebraic analysis of the game.

# Step 1: Define the dimension of the vector space of all possible 3x3 parity matrices (V).
# Each of the 3x3=9 entries can be 0 or 1, so the dimension is 9.
dim_V = 3 * 3

# Step 2: Define the dimension of the subspace of transformations (W).
# A transformation is equivalent to adding a matrix T where T_ij = a_i + b_j.
# The vectors 'a' and 'b' are in F_2^3, so they are defined by 3+3=6 parameters.
# However, there is a dependency: if we change a to a+(1,1,1) and b to b+(1,1,1),
# T remains unchanged (mod 2). This creates a 1-dimensional dependency.
# So, the dimension of the transformation subspace is 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.
dim_W = (3 + 3) - 1

# Step 3: Calculate the number of equivalence classes.
# The number of classes is the size of the quotient space V/W, which is 2^(dim(V) - dim(W)).
num_classes = 2**(dim_V - dim_W)

# Step 4: Print the final calculation, showing each number involved.
print(f"The dimension of the space of parity matrices is {dim_V}.")
print(f"The dimension of the transformation subspace is {dim_W}.")
print("The number of equivalence classes is given by the equation:")
print(f"2^({dim_V} - {dim_W}) = 2^{dim_V - dim_W} = {num_classes}")
