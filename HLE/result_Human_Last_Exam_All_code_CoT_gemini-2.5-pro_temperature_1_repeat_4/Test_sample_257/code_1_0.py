    print("  - Explanation: The concept of betting 'for information' relies on an opponent reacting in an exploitable way. A GTO player's response is perfectly balanced. They will call, fold, or raise with a calculated range of hands that gives away no extra exploitable information. You cannot gain an 'informational edge' against a perfect strategy.")

    print("  - Explanation: A GTO player has no secret 'tendencies' to protect. Their strategy is mathematically sound and unexploitable even if the opponent knows it completely. Seeing one hand at showdown doesn't provide exploitable data, as the GTO player is balancing that same action across a wide range of value hands and bluffs. The strategy itself is the 'information,' and it's already perfect.")
