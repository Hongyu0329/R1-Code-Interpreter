    "To solve this problem, I will determine the symmetry factor for the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Interpret the Diagram:** I'll first interpret the description \"two vertices and four field contractions\". In a common scalar field theory like $\\phi^4$ theory, this describes a vacuum diagram where two vertices are connected by four propagators (lines). This is one of the simplest loop diagrams beyond the single-vertex \"tadpole\".\n2.  **Define Symmetry Factor:** The symmetry factor, `S`, of a diagram is the number of ways its internal lines and vertices can be permuted without changing the diagram's structure (topology).\n3.  **Calculate Component Symmetries:** I'll calculate the total symmetry factor by considering the different types of symmetries present in this specific diagram:\n    *   **Propagator Symmetry:** There are four identical propagators connecting the two vertices. I will calculate the number of ways these can be permuted.\n    *   **Vertex Symmetry:** There are two identical vertices. I will calculate the number of ways these can be interchanged.\n4.  **Calculate Total Symmetry:** The total symmetry factor `S` is the product of the component symmetry factors.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to execute this calculation. The script will use the `math.factorial` function to compute the permutations and will print out each step of the calculation, including the final equation and result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two vertices\n    connected by four propagators.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the parameters of the diagram\n    num_vertices = 2\n    num_propagators = 4\n\n    # Explain the context and method\n    print(\"The Feynman diagram described has two vertices and four field contractions.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to a vacuum bubble diagram in a phi^4-type theory, where two vertices are connected by four propagators.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe symmetry factor, S, is the number of permutations of the diagram's internal parts that leave the topology unchanged.\")\n    print(\"S can be calculated as the product of the symmetries from its vertices and propagators (lines).\")\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the symmetry from interchanging identical vertices.\n    # Since the two vertices are identical, they can be swapped.\n    vertex_symmetry = math.factorial(num_vertices)\n    print(f\"\\nStep 1: Calculate Vertex Symmetry\")\n    print(f\"There are {num_vertices} identical vertices which can be interchanged.\")\n    print(f\"This contributes a factor of {num_vertices}! = {vertex_symmetry}.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the symmetry from interchanging identical propagators.\n    # The four propagators connecting the vertices are identical and can be permuted.\n    propagator_symmetry = math.factorial(num_propagators)\n    print(f\"\\nStep 2: Calculate Propagator Symmetry\")\n    print(f\"There are {num_propagators} identical propagators connecting the two vertices which can be permuted.\")\n    print(f\"This contributes a factor of {num_propagators}! = {propagator_symmetry}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the total symmetry factor.\n    # The total symmetry factor is the product of the individual symmetries.\n    total_symmetry_factor = vertex_symmetry * propagator_symmetry\n    print(f\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor\")\n    print(\"The total symmetry factor S is the product of the vertex and propagator symmetries.\")\n    print(f\"S = (Vertex Symmetry) * (Propagator Symmetry)\")\n    print(f\"S = {vertex_symmetry} * {propagator_symmetry} = {total_symmetry_factor}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe final symmetry factor associated with the diagram is {total_symmetry_factor}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_symmetry_factor()\n```\n<<<48>>>"
