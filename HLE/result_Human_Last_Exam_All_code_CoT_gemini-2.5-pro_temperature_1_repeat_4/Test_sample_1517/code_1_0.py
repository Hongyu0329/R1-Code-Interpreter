    Analyzes the problem about the topological group G and the index I_G.
    
    The problem asks for the largest possible value of I_G, where I_G is the minimum
    cardinality of the quotient group G / <A> for a discrete subset A.

    1. If a group G can be generated by a discrete set A, then <A> = G, and the
       quotient group G/<A> has cardinality 1. So, I_G = 1 for such groups.
       Many countably infinite non-discrete Hausdorff topological groups (e.g., direct
       sums of finite groups) fall into this category.

    2. If a group G cannot be generated by any discrete set, I_G will be greater than 1.
       A prime example of such a group is the set of rational numbers Q with the
       usual topology.

    3. For G = Q, it can be shown that for any discrete subset A, the subgroup <A>
       is a proper subgroup of infinite index. This means the cardinality of
       Q / <A> is always infinite (ℵ₀). Therefore, I_Q = ℵ₀.

    4. The value of I_G is always less than or equal to the cardinality of G itself,
       which is ℵ₀.

    5. Since we have found a group G (namely, Q) for which I_G reaches this
       upper bound, the largest possible value for I_G is ℵ₀.

    print("The reasoning leads to the conclusion that the set of possible finite values for I_G is not bounded.")
    print("For example, for any integer n > 1, one can construct a group G for which I_G >= n, though these constructions are complex.")
    print("Furthermore, there exists a group (the rational numbers Q) for which I_G is countably infinite (ℵ₀).")
    print(f"Therefore, the supremum, or the largest value, of I_G is infinity.")
