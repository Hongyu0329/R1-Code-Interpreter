# This script calculates the final answer based on the analytical solution derived above.

# Step 1: Find the optimal F by solving the equation where the two win probabilities are equal.
# The equation is F^2 = 1 - F^2.
print("To find the optimal F that minimizes A's maximum win probability, we solve the equation:")
print("F^2 = 1 - F^2")
print("2 * F^2 = 1")
F_squared = 1 / 2
print(f"F^2 = {F_squared}")

# Step 2: Calculate the minimized probability of A winning at this optimal F.
# At this point, P(A wins) = F^2.
P_A_wins = F_squared
print("\nThe minimized probability of A winning, P(A wins), is equal to F^2.")
print(f"P(A wins) = {P_A_wins}")

# Step 3: Calculate the final required value based on this probability.
# The problem asks for floor(1 / P(A wins)).
inverse_prob = 1 / P_A_wins
print("\nFinally, we calculate the required value:")
# The final equation is floor(1 / P(A wins))
# We print each number involved in this equation.
final_answer = math.floor(inverse_prob)
print(f"⌊1 / {P_A_wins}⌋ = {final_answer}")
