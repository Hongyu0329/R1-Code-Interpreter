    # Description of the phenomenon: A "coarsening gas" evolves from impurities
    # during sintering. This gas gets trapped in pores, creating internal pressure
    # that opposes densification and can inhibit grain growth.

    # Analysis of answer choices:
    choices = {
        'A': "Higher heating rates to isothermal holds resulting in lower sintered densities. (Likely: Fast heating traps gas.)",
        'B': "De-densification when sintering under some atmospheres, but not others. (Likely: Gas evolution is atmosphere-dependent.)",
        'C': "Large, randomly distributed voids in the sintered part. (Likely: Classic result of trapped gas.)",
        'D': "Larger grain sizes in the interior of the part than near the part's surface. (Unlikely: Trapped gas in the interior *inhibits* grain growth, leading to smaller grains compared to the surface.)",
        'E': "Cracking. (Likely: High internal gas pressure can exceed material strength.)",
        'F': "Higher green densities resulting in lower sintered densities when parts are sintered under the same heating schedules. (Likely: A known counter-intuitive effect where denser starting parts trap gas more effectively.)"
    }

    # The most unlikely effect is D, as trapped gas in the interior is expected to
    # hinder grain growth, not enhance it relative to the surface.
