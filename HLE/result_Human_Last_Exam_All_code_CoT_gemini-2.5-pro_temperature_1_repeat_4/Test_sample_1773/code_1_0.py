    # Step 2: Detail the drug's specific effects.
    print("2. It decreases the production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain, which is why it is used to lower high intracranial pressure in conditions like idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).")
    print("3. Crucially, it ALSO decreases the production of aqueous humor in the eye. This action directly lowers the pressure inside the eye (intraocular pressure or IOP).")
    
    # Step 3: Analyze the patient's situation.
    print("4. The patient's IIH is in 'sudden remission,' meaning the high intracranial pressure has resolved.")

    # Step 4: Combine the drug's effect with the patient's situation to find the answer.

    print("C. Normal intraocular pressure - Unlikely. The drug's purpose is to lower pressure below its baseline.")
    print("D. Low intracranial pressure - This is also likely true, but the question asks about an intraocular (eye) pressure test, not an intracranial (skull) one.")
