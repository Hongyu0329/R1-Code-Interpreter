    Analyzes five scenarios against Ontario securities regulations as of Jan 2020
    to find the compliant distribution.

    print("Analyzing which distribution complies with Ontario securities regulations...\n")

    # Option A Analysis
    print("--- Option A: Bonds from Bank of China (Canada) ---")
    print("Issuer: Bank of China (Canada), a Schedule III bank.")
    print("Security: Bonds (a type of debt security).")
    print("Regulation: NI 45-106, Section 2.38 provides a prospectus exemption for debt securities issued by a Schedule I, II, or III bank.")
    print("Conclusion: This distribution is exempt from the prospectus requirement. This appears compliant.\n")

    # Option B Analysis
    print("--- Option B: Bonds from JPMorgan Chase ---")
    print("Issuer: JPMorgan Chase, a foreign bank branch, not a Schedule I, II, or III bank.")
    print("Security: Bonds.")
    print("Regulation: The specific bank exemption under NI 45-106 does not apply.")
    print("Conclusion: Distributing to a large number of investors without an exemption requires a prospectus. This is not compliant.\n")

    # Option C Analysis
    print("--- Option C: Shares from a private issuer to an individual ---")
    print("Investor financial details: Salary = $35,000, Net Assets = $10,000.")
    print("Regulation: To be an 'accredited investor', one needs income > $200k, net financial assets > $1M, or net assets > $5M.")
    print("Conclusion: The investor does not meet the accredited investor criteria. This is not compliant.\n")

    # Option D Analysis
    print("--- Option D: Shares from Fairstone Bank of Canada ---")
    print("Issuer: Fairstone Bank of Canada, a Schedule I bank.")
    print("Security: Shares (an equity security).")
    print("Regulation: The bank exemption in NI 45-106 s. 2.38 applies to DEBT securities, not equity securities like shares.")
    print("Conclusion: Distributing shares to the public requires a prospectus. This is not compliant.\n")

    # Option E Analysis
    print("--- Option E: Shares from Caisse populaire acadienne ltée ---")
    print("Issuer: Caisse populaire acadienne ltée, a credit union.")
    print("Security: Shares.")
    print("Investor detail: One investor has zero net assets and is unemployed.")
    print("Regulation: NI 45-106, Section 2.39 provides a prospectus exemption for any security issued by a credit union to its members or prospective members.")
    print("Conclusion: The financial status of the member is irrelevant for this exemption. This is a core function of credit unions. This distribution is fully compliant.\n")
    
    # Final Verdict
    print("--- Final Verdict ---")
    print("Both A and E appear compliant with prospectus rules. However, Option E describes a scenario that is fundamentally and unambiguously supported by a specific exemption designed for the structure of a credit union, regardless of member's wealth. It is the most clear-cut example of a compliant distribution under the full scope of securities regulations.")
    print("The compliant distribution is E.")
