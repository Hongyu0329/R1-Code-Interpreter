    "My plan is to determine the number of power subgroups by analyzing the algebraic structure of the generalized quaternion group of size 128, which is denoted $Q_{128}$.\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The group $Q_{128}$ is a member of the family of generalized quaternion groups of order $2^k$, where $k \\ge 3$. Since $128 = 2^7$, we have $k=7$. The group is $Q_{2^7}$.\n2.  **Analyze Power Subgroups:** A power subgroup is a set of the form $G^j = \\{g^j \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $j$. We can classify these subgroups based on whether the exponent $j$ is odd or even.\n3.  **Count for Odd Exponents:** I will show that for any odd integer $j$, the power subgroup $G^j$ is always the group $G$ itself. This provides one unique subgroup.\n4.  **Count for Even Exponents:** For any even integer $j$, the power subgroup $G^j$ is always one of the proper cyclic subgroups of $G$. I will count how many distinct subgroups arise from this case. For $Q_{2^k}$, this results in $k-1$ distinct subgroups.\n5.  **Calculate Total:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from the odd and even exponent cases.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this logic, calculate the final number, and print the steps of the final calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The size of the generalized quaternion group.\n    group_size = 128\n\n    # A generalized quaternion group of size N must have N be a power of 2, N = 2^k, for k >= 3.\n    # We find the exponent k.\n    if group_size <= 4 or (group_size & (group_size - 1)) != 0:\n        print(f\"A generalized quaternion group of size {group_size} is not standard.\")\n        print(\"Standard generalized quaternion groups have size 2^k for k >= 3.\")\n        return\n\n    k = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    # The power subgroups G^j = {g^j | g in G} are analyzed based on the parity of the exponent j.\n    \n    # Case 1: j is an odd integer.\n    # For any odd j, the mapping g -> g^j is a permutation of the group elements.\n    # Thus, G^j = G.
