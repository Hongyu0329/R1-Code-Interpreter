    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Mathematical Object:** The \"space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$\" is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted $G(3, 5)$. This space is known to be diffeomorphic to $G(2, 5)$, which is easier to work with. The question asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n2.  **Use Topological Invariants:** Instead of calculating the entire cohomology ring structure, which is quite complex, I will use a well-known relationship between the homology groups over different coefficients. The integral homology groups $H_i(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ of a space $X$ determine its integral cohomology groups $H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ as well as its homology groups with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients, $H_i(X; \\mathbb{Z}_2)$.\n\n3.  **Formulate an Equation:** For any space $X$ where the torsion is entirely 2-torsion (which is true for real Grassmannians), the following relation holds for their Betti numbers:\n    \n    $\\sum_i b_i(\\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\chi(X) + 2S$\n    \n    Where:\n    *   $b_i(\\mathbb{Z}_2)$ are the Betti numbers with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients. Their sum $\\sum_i b_i(\\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is the total dimension of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-homology.\n    *   $\\chi(X)$ is the Euler characteristic of the space. It is defined as $\\sum_i (-1)^i \\beta_i$, where $\\beta_i$ are the rational Betti numbers. For spaces like Grassmannians whose rational cohomology is concentrated in even degrees, this sum is simply $\\sum_i \\beta_i$.\n    *   $S$ is the total rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral homology $H_*(X; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n4.  **Relate Homology and Cohomology Torsion:** The Universal Coefficient Theorem implies that the rank of the torsion subgroup of the cohomology ring is equal to the rank of the torsion subgroup of the homology ring. Therefore, the value $S$ we are solving for is precisely the answer to the user's question.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Components:**\n    *   The total dimension of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-homology of $G(k, n)$ is the total number of its Schubert cells, which is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$. For $G(3,5)$, this is $\\binom{5}{3}=10$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic $\\chi(G(k, n))$ is calculated by finding all Schubert cells, classifying them by their dimension (even or odd), and computing $\\chi = (\\text{number of even cells}) - (\\text{number of odd cells})$.\n\n6.  **Solve for S:** I will implement a Python script to perform these calculations and solve the equation for $S$. The script will first compute $\\binom{5}{3}$, then generate the Schubert cells for $G(2,5)$ to compute $\\chi$, and finally calculate $S = (\\binom{5}{3} - \\chi) / 2$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_torsion_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring\n    of the space of 3-subspaces of R^5, which is the Grassmannian G(3, 5).\n\n    The plan is to use the formula relating the sum of Z_2-Betti numbers,\n    the Euler characteristic, and the total rank of homology torsion (S):\n    Sum(b_i(Z_2)) = chi(X) + 2*S\n    The rank of the cohomology torsion is equal to S.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 5\n    k_orig = 3\n\n    print(f\"The space in question is the real Grassmannian G({k_orig}, {n}).\")\n    print(f\"This space is diffeomorphic to G({n-k_orig}, {n}), which is G(2, 5).
