    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, we need to apply a t-norm operation to the firing level of the antecedent (`Phi_k(x′)`) and the membership grade of the consequent (`μG_k_j(y_j)`). The most commonly used t-norm is the minimum operator.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define two variables for the given values: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  Use the minimum t-norm to calculate the activation level: `Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)`.\n3.  Print the full equation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# Given values for the fuzzy rule\nphi_k = 0.7  # Firing level of the antecedent\nmu_G_k_j = 0.9 # Membership grade of the consequent\n\n# The rule activation level is calculated using a t-norm operation.\n# We will use the most common t-norm, which is the minimum operator.\nactivation_level = min(phi_k, mu_G_k_j)\n\n# Print the calculation steps and the final result\nprint(\"The rule activation level is the t-norm of the antecedent's firing level and the consequent's membership grade.\")\nprint(f\"Using the minimum t-norm, the calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"Rule Activation Level = min({phi_k}, {mu_G_k_j})\")\nprint(f\"Rule Activation Level = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
