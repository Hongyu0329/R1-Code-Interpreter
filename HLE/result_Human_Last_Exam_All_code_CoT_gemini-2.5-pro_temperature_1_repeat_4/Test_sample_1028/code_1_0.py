    # The core problem:
    # On a phylogeny of only extant species, a birth-death model with time-varying
    # speciation (lambda) and extinction (mu) rates is unidentifiable. This means
    # multiple combinations of lambda(t) and mu(t) can result in the same likelihood,
    # making it impossible to distinguish between them.

    # Analysis of the options:

        'A': "Fitting a birth-death model with 10 constant pieces: This simplifies the model, reducing its flexibility. This is a form of regularization which can help make inference more stable, even if it doesn't solve the theoretical problem within each piece. So, it is considered a helpful strategy.",
        'B': "Incorporating prior information in a Bayesian framework: Priors add external information, which helps the model distinguish between parameter combinations that have equal likelihood. This is a standard and effective method to mitigate identifiability. This helps.",
        'C': "Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5: This dramatically increases the model's complexity and flexibility (120 parameters). For a model that is already unidentifiable, increasing flexibility makes the problem worse, not better. It allows for an even wider range of functions to fit the data equally well. This does NOT help.",
        'D': "Incorporating fossils tips and sampled ancestors: Fossils provide direct evidence of extinction events, giving the model the information it needs to disentangle the extinction rate (mu) from the speciation rate (lambda). This is a very powerful way to solve the problem. This helps.",
        'E': "Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled diversification rate: The pulled diversification rate (lambda - mu) is an identifiable parameter combination. By reparametrizing the model to estimate this directly, we sidestep the problem by asking a question the data can answer. This helps.",
        'F': "Incorporating fossils tips in the phylogeny: Same as D, adding fossil data provides crucial information about extinction. This helps.",
        'G': "Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled speciation rate: The pulled speciation rate is another identifiable parameter. Similar to E, this is a valid reparameterization strategy. This helps."
