    # The problem describes a system where a one-way door allows gas molecules
    # to move from one compartment to another, but not back.
    # The goal is to find the parameter required for this process to occur.

    # 1. The movement of gas molecules is due to their kinetic energy.
    #    This random motion is known as thermal motion.
    print("Step 1: The process described relies on the movement of gas molecules.")
    print("Gas molecules in an ideal gas are in constant, random motion.")

    # 2. Temperature is the measure of the average kinetic energy of these molecules.
    #    The relationship is given by KE_avg = (3/2) * k * T, where T is temperature.
    print("\nStep 2: The motion of gas molecules is fundamentally governed by temperature.")
    print("Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules.")

    # 3. Consider the case where temperature is at its absolute minimum.
    #    If Temperature (T) is 0 Kelvin (absolute zero), the kinetic energy (KE) is 0.
    print("\nStep 3: Consider the case of absolute zero temperature (T=0 K).")
    print("At T=0 K, molecules have no kinetic energy and therefore do not move.")

    # 4. Without motion, molecules cannot travel to the one-way door and pass through it.
    #    Therefore, the system would remain static with gas on both sides.
    print("\nStep 4: If molecules do not move, they cannot pass through the door.")
    print("Thus, the described trapping of gas on one side cannot occur.")

    # 5. Conclusion: A non-zero temperature is required to provide the molecules with
    #    the kinetic energy needed to move and interact with the door.
    print("\nConclusion: A temperature above absolute zero is the essential parameter required for the gas molecules to have motion and for the apparatus to work as described.")
    
    # The answer is Temperature.
    final_answer = 'B'
