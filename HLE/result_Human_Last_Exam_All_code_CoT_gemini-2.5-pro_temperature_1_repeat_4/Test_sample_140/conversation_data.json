    "To solve this problem, we need to find the most efficient way to pack 9x1x1 blocks into a 15x15x15 cube. A simple volume calculation (`15*15*15 / (9*1*1) = 375`) gives an upper limit, but it doesn't account for the geometry of packing. A perfect packing of 375 blocks is impossible because the block's length (9) does not divide the cube's edge length (15).\n\nMy strategy is to use a recursive, greedy algorithm to pack the blocks. The main idea is to slice the cube in a way that creates a sub-space that can be perfectly filled with blocks, and then recursively try to pack the remaining space.\n\nHere is the plan for the Python code:\n1.  Define the dimensions of the cube (15x15x15) and the block (9x1x1).\n2.  Create a recursive function, `calculate_max_blocks`, that takes the dimensions of a space as input.\n3.  Inside the function, try three main packing orientations:\n    *   Cut a `9 x 15 x 15` slab, fill it perfectly with `1*15*15 = 225` blocks, and recursively pack the remaining `6 x 15 x 15` space.\n    *   (Due to the cube's symmetry, the other two initial orientations are identical).\n4.  The recursion continues until the remaining space is too small to fit any more blocks (i.e., all dimensions are smaller than 9).\n5.  To avoid re-computing results for the same sub-space, the function will use memoization (caching).\n6.  The function will return not just the total count, but also the number of blocks from each step, allowing us to print the final equation.\n\nThis approach simulates a practical and efficient way of filling the cube and will give us the maximum number of blocks for this specific packing strategy.\n\n```python\nimport functools\n\ndef solve_block_packing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest number of 9x1x1 blocks that fit inside a 15x15x15 cube\n    and prints the step-by-step calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the dimensions of the block, sorted for consistency.\n    block_dim = sorted([9, 1, 1], reverse=True)\n    l, w, h = block_dim[0], block_dim[1], block_dim[2]\n\n    # Use memoization (lru_cache) to store results for previously computed dimensions,\n    # which avoids re-calculating for the same sub-problem.\n    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def calculate_max_blocks(space_dim_tuple):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively calculates the maximum number of blocks that can fit in a given space.\n        It tries to cut a slab that can be perfectly filled and then recursively calls\n        itself on the remaining space.
