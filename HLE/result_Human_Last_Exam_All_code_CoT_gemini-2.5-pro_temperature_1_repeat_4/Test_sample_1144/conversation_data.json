    "To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the momentum (p) of an electron in the first Bohr orbit.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp):** We will use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is approximately equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ) divided by 2.\n    *   Formula: Δp ≈ ħ / (2 * Δx)\n2.  **Calculate the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit (p):** In the Bohr model, the angular momentum of an electron in the n-th orbit is quantized and given by L = nħ. For the first orbit (n=1), L = ħ. Since angular momentum is also L = r * p (where r is the orbit radius and p is the linear momentum), we have p = ħ / r. For the first Bohr orbit, the radius (r₁) is the Bohr radius (a₀).\n    *   Formula: p = ħ / a₀\n3.  **Find the ratio (Δp / p):** We will divide the expression for Δp by the expression for p.\n    *   Ratio = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a₀)\n    *   Simplifying this expression, we get: Ratio = a₀ / (2 * Δx)\n4.  **Substitute the known values and calculate:**\n    *   Bohr radius (a₀) ≈ 5.29177 × 10⁻¹¹ m\n    *   Given position uncertainty (Δx) = 10 pm = 10 × 10⁻¹² m = 1 × 10⁻¹¹ m\n    *   Plug these values into the simplified ratio formula to get the final numerical answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants\n\ndef calculate_momentum_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron\n    to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known values\n    # Position uncertainty given in the problem (10 pm)\n    delta_x = 10e-12  # in meters\n\n    # Physical constants\n    # Bohr radius (radius of the first Bohr orbit)\n    bohr_radius = scipy.constants.physical_constants['Bohr radius'][0] # a_0\n\n    # The ratio Δp/p simplifies to a_0 / (2 * Δx)\n    # Δp ≈ ħ / (2 * Δx)\n    # p = ħ / a_0 (for the first Bohr orbit, n=1)\n    # Ratio = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a_0) = a_0 / (2 * Δx)\n    ratio = bohr_radius / (2 * delta_x)\n\n    # Output the result and the equation with the values used\n    print(\"To find the ratio of the uncertainty of momentum (Δp) to the momentum (p), we use the formula:\")\n    print(\"Ratio = a₀ / (2 * Δx)\\n\")\n    print(\"Where:\")\n    print(f\"  Bohr radius (a₀) = {bohr_radius:.5e} m\")\n    print(f\"  Position uncertainty (Δx) = {delta_x:.5e} m\\n\")\n    print(\"Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Ratio = {bohr_radius:.5f} / (2 * {delta_x:.5f})\")\n    print(f\"Ratio = {ratio:.6f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_momentum_ratio()\n```\n<<<2.645886>>>"
