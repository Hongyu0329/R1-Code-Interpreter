    # 1. Symmetry: M must be symmetric.
    # 2. Positive Semidefinite (PSD): M must be PSD (diagonal entries >= 0, determinant >= 0).
    # 3. Trace >= 1: Tr(M) must be at least 1.
    
    results = []
    
    # Matrix A
    A = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 0]])
    tr_A = np.trace(A)
    # The trace is Tr(A) = 0 + 0 = 0.
    # For any M in P, Tr(M) >= 1.
    # Since 0 < 1, A is not in P.
    
    # Matrix B
    B = np.array([[6, 4], [3, 7]])
    # B is not symmetric because B[0,1] = 4 != B[1,0] = 3.
    # Any matrix in P must be symmetric. So B is not in P.

    # Matrix C
    C = np.array([[1, -0.5], [-0.5, 1]])
    # C is symmetric, Tr(C) = 1+1=2 >= 1, det(C) = 1*1 - (-0.5)^2 = 0.75 >= 0.
    # All necessary conditions are met.
    # We can construct C as a convex combination.
    # Let S1 = v1*v1.T for v1 = (1, 1).T => S1 = [[1, 1], [1, 1]]
    # Let S2 = v2*v2.T for v2 = (1, -1).T => S2 = [[1, -1], [-1, 1]]
    # C = (1/4)*S1 + (3/4)*S2
    # C = (1/4)*[[1, 1], [1, 1]] + (3/4)*[[1, -1], [-1, 1]]

    # This is a valid convex combination. So C is in P.

    # Matrix D
    D = np.array([[np.pi, 1], [1, np.pi**2]])
    # D is symmetric, Tr(D) > 1, det(D) = pi^3 - 1 > 0.
    # A matrix M in P has property m22=m11^2 only if it is a convex combination
    # of generators v=(a,b) where |b|=a^2.
    # This leads to Var(a^2) = E[(a^2)^2] - (E[a^2])^2 = (m22) - (m11)^2 = pi^2 - pi^2 = 0.
    # Zero variance means a^2 must be a constant, c.
    # E[a^2] = c, so c = m11 = pi.
    # But c=a^2 must be an integer (a perfect square). Pi is not. Contradiction.
    # So D is not in P.
    
    # Matrix E
    E = np.array([[1, np.pi], [np.pi, 1]])
    # E is symmetric. But det(E) = 1*1 - pi*pi = 1 - pi^2 < 0.
    # It is not PSD. So E is not in P.
    
    # Matrix F
    F = np.array([[42, 0], [0, 0]])
    # F is symmetric, Tr(F)=42 >= 1, det(F)=0 >= 0.
    # All necessary conditions met.
    # The condition m22 = 0 implies F must be a convex combination of generators
    # v=(a,0). These look like [[a^2, 0], [0, 0]].
    # We need to represent 42 as a convex combination of perfect squares.
    # We can use 36 and 49.
    # 42 = (7/13)*36 + (6/13)*49.
    # This is a valid convex combination. So F is in P.
