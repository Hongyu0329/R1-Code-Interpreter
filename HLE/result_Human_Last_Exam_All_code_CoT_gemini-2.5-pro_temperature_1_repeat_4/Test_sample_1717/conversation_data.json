    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Base Health:** First, I will find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n2.  **Identify Health Scaling Formula:** Next, I will determine the formula the game uses to increase boss health for each additional player in multiplayer.\n3.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:** I'll apply the concept of an infinite number of players to this formula. Mathematically, this would result in infinite health.\n4.  **Consider Technical Limitations:** However, games have technical limitations. I will research the data type used to store NPC health in Terraria's source code. This data type has a maximum possible value, which acts as a hard cap on the boss's health.\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** The theoretical maximum health is therefore not infinite, but is instead limited to this maximum data type value.\n6.  **Construct Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that defines the health and scaling parameters, prints the scaling formula, and explains that the true maximum health is dictated by the 32-bit integer limit, printing this final value.\n\n```python\ndef solve_terraria_health_limit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu\n    in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the base health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n    base_health_expert = 3640\n\n    # Step 2: Define the health increase factor for each additional player.\n    # In Expert Mode, boss health increases by 35% for each player after the first.\n    health_increase_factor = 0.35\n\n    # The formula for health (H) based on the number of players (N) is:\n    # H = BaseHealth * (1 + HealthIncreaseFactor * (N - 1))\n    # As N approaches infinity, H also approaches infinity.\n\n    # Step 3: Identify the game's technical limitation.\n    # Terraria's source code stores NPC health in a standard 32-bit signed integer (int).\n    # This data type has a fixed maximum value.\n    theoretical_max_health = 2147483647\n\n    # Step 4: Print the explanation and the final answer.\n    print(\"In Terraria's Expert Mode, the health of the Eye of Cthulhu scales with the number of players.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe formula is: Health = Base Health * (1 + Per-Player Bonus * (Number of Players - 1))\")\n    print(\"\\nUsing the specific numbers for the Eye of Cthulhu:\")\n    print(f\"Health = {base_health_expert} * (1 + {health_increase_factor} * (Number of Players - 1))\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nWith an infinite number of players, this formula would yield infinite health.\")\n    print(\"However, the game's code stores health as a 32-bit signed integer, which has a maximum value.\")\n    print(\"This value acts as the true theoretical health limit in the game engine.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health is:\")\n    print(f\"{theoretical_max_health}\")\n\nsolve_terraria_health_limit()\n```\n<<<2147483647>>>"
