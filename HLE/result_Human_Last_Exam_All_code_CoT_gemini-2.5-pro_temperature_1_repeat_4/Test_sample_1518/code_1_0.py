    # Step 1: State the principle.
    # The 't Hooft anomaly matching condition is a non-perturbative statement connecting
    # the high-energy (UV) and low-energy (IR) descriptions of a quantum field theory.
    # It posits that the value of an anomaly for a global symmetry cannot change as we
    # flow from the UV to the IR.
    print("Thinking Step 1: Understanding the 't Hooft Anomaly Matching Condition")
    print("The condition requires that anomalies of global symmetries must be consistent between the high-energy (UV) and low-energy (IR) descriptions of a theory.")
    print("The anomaly, calculated with UV fields (e.g., quarks), must be identical to the anomaly calculated with IR fields (e.g., composite hadrons).\n")

    # Step 2: Analyze the physical implication of this principle.
    # Because the IR theory must reproduce the UV anomaly, it is heavily constrained.
    # We can use this principle to test or rule out proposed low-energy effective theories.
    print("Thinking Step 2: Deriving the Physical Implication")
    print("This condition acts as a powerful consistency check. If a proposed low-energy effective theory of composite particles does not reproduce the anomaly calculated from the fundamental underlying theory, that low-energy theory must be incorrect.")
    print("Therefore, the principle severely restricts the possible dynamics, degrees of freedom, and symmetry-breaking patterns that can occur at low energies.\n")

    # Step 3: Conclude the best description.
    # The most general and accurate description of this implication is that it constrains
    # the structure of possible low-energy effective theories.
    print("Thinking Step 3: Selecting the Best Answer Choice")
    print("The most fundamental implication is that the anomaly matching condition serves as a 'Constraint on low-energy effective theories'.")
    print("This encompasses other related consequences, such as constraining the particle content (degrees of freedom) and guiding possible symmetry breaking patterns.\n")
