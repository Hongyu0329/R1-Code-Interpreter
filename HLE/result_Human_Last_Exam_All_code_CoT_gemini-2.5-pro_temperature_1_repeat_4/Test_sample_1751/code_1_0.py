# Step 1: Explain the key structural difference.
print("Step 1: Identify the key structural difference.")
print(f"The structure of {lipid_A} contains two fully saturated hydrocarbon chains (an 18-carbon chain and a 16-carbon chain).")

# Step 2: Relate structure to molecular packing.
print("Step 2: Relate structure to molecular packing.")
print("Saturated hydrocarbon chains are straight and flexible. They can pack together very tightly and in an ordered fashion, maximizing van der Waals interactions.")
print("A trans double bond, while less disruptive than a cis bond, introduces a kink or 'jog' in the hydrocarbon chain. This disruption prevents the molecules from packing as tightly as fully saturated chains.")
print("\n")

# Step 3: Connect packing to surface area in a monolayer.
print("Step 3: Connect packing density to surface area.")
print("In a monolayer at an air-water interface, tighter packing results in a lower surface area per molecule when the monolayer is compressed.")
print("The 'highly ordered domains' of C16-dihydroceramide indicate tighter packing, while the 'less ordered' domains of C16-ceramide indicate looser packing.")

# Step 4: State the conclusion.
print("Conclusion:")
print(f"Because its two saturated chains allow for more efficient, tighter packing, {lipid_A} will occupy a smaller area per molecule.")
print(f"Therefore, {lipid_A} will have a lower surface area when compressed in a monolayer.")
