    # --- Part (a): Analysis of the proposed equality ---
    # Question: Is H(U_{n-1, E})(t) = t^(n-1) d_n(t)?
    # Reasoning: We compare the polynomial degrees.
    # Degree of LHS, H(U_{n-1, E})(t), is rank - 1 = (n-1) - 1 = n-2.
    # Degree of RHS, t^(n-1) d_n(t), is deg(t^(n-1)) + deg(d_n(t)) = (n-1) + (n-1) = 2n-2.
    # Since n-2 != 2n-2 for n >= 2, the equality is false.

    # --- Part (b): Leading coefficient of d_n(t) ---
    # Question: Is the leading coefficient of d_n(t) for n >= 2 always 1?
    # Reasoning: The leading coefficient is the number of derangements with the maximum
    # number of excedances (n-1). There is only one such derangement: the cycle (2, 3, ..., n, 1).
