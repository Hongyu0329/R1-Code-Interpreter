    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the curve type:** The curve is a Lissajous curve. Lissajous curves are a family of curves described by parametric equations of the form `x(t) = A sin(at + δ)` and `y(t) = B sin(bt)`. Our curve `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)` fits this category with `a=9`, `b=5`, and a phase shift in the x-component (since `cos(θ) = sin(θ + π/2)`).\n\n2.  **Check the frequency ratio:** The parameters are `n = 9` and `m = 5`. For the curve to be a simple closed curve (that doesn't retrace itself), the ratio of the frequencies `n/m` must be a rational number. Here, `9/5` is rational. We also check if `n` and `m` are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1). `gcd(9, 5) = 1`, which confirms the curve is traced completely once over the interval `t` in `[0, 2π)`.\n\n3.  **Apply the standard formula:** For a Lissajous curve of the form `x(t) = cos(nt)` and `y(t) = sin(mt)`, where `n` and `m` are coprime integers, the number of self-intersection points (`N`) is given by the well-established formula:\n    `N = (n - 1) * (m - 1) / 2`\n\n4.  **Calculate the result:** We substitute our values `n = 9` and `m = 5` into the formula to find the number of self-intersection points.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints each step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of self-intersection points for the curve\n    (cos(9t), sin(5t)).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The curve is a Lissajous curve of the form x(t) = cos(nt), y(t) = sin(mt).\n    # The parameters are n and m.\n    n = 9\n    m = 5\n\n    # The number of self-intersection points for such a curve,\n    # where n and m are coprime, is given by the formula:\n    # N = (n - 1) * (m - 1) / 2\n    \n    # First, confirm that n and m are coprime.\n    if math.gcd(n, m) != 1:\n        print(f\"Error: n={n} and m={m} are not coprime.\")\n        return\n\n    # Apply the formula and show the steps of the calculation.\n    n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    m_minus_1 = m - 1\n    numerator = n_minus_1 * m_minus_1\n    num_intersections = numerator // 2\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of self-intersections for the curve (cos({n}t), sin({m}t)).\")\n    print(\"The formula for the number of self-intersections is (n - 1) * (m - 1) / 2.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation steps:\")\n    print(f\"({n} - 1) * ({m} - 1) / 2\")\n    print(f\"= {n_minus_1} * {m_minus_1} / 2\")\n    print(f\"= {numerator} / 2\")\n    print(f\"= {num_intersections}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe total number of self-intersection points is {num_intersections}.\")\n\nsolve_intersections()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
