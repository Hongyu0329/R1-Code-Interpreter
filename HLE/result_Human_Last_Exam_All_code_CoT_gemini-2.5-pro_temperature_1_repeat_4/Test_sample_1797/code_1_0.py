    Analyzes the statements about attack graph analysis and determines which are incorrect.

    A. Correct. Describes the basic graph structure and application of graph algorithms.
    B. Correct. Describes the well-known state explosion problem and its complexity.
    C. Correct. Characterizes the generation problem as computationally intractable (NP-hard is a correct classification).
    D. Correct. Addresses the dynamic nature of systems and the need for incremental updates.
    E. Correct. Mentions the valid application of formal verification and model checking.

    Since all statements are correct, the answer is 'N'.
