    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can use topological relations that govern these diagrams.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Theory:** We are considering an interacting scalar field theory. The simplest and most common interaction is the $\\phi^4$ theory, where each vertex connects four propagator lines.\n2.  **Use Topological Formulas:** There are two key formulas for connected Feynman diagrams:\n    *   The relationship between the number of loops (L), internal propagators (I), and vertices (V): `L = I - V + 1`\n    *   A relationship derived from counting line ends. For a $\\phi^4$ theory, each of the V vertices has 4 lines. These lines are either internal (I) or external (E). Each internal line connects two vertices, and each external line connects to one. This gives: `4V = 2I + E`\n3.  **Combine and Solve:** We will algebraically combine these two equations to express the number of vertices (V) in terms of the number of loops (L) and external lines (E).\n4.  **Minimize:** To find the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop diagram (L=2), we will find the minimum possible value for the number of external lines (E). The smallest possible number of external lines is E=0, which corresponds to a vacuum diagram.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Result:** Substitute L=2 and the minimum E into the derived formula to find the minimum V.\n\nThe Python code below will carry out these steps and print the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    for a phi^4 interacting scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of loops required\n    L = 2\n\n    print(\"We want to find the minimum number of vertices (V) for a two-loop Feynman diagram.\")\n    print(\"For a phi^4 theory, we use two fundamental equations:\")\n    print(\"1.
