    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The formula $C_7H_{14}$ has a Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) of 1, which indicates the presence of either one C=C double bond or one ring.\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**:\n    *   The chemical shifts at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are in the alkene region, confirming a C=C double bond. This rules out a cycloalkane.\n    *   The multiplicities tell us about the hydrogens on each carbon. The signal at 112 ppm with multiplicity (t) corresponds to a =CH$_2$ group, indicating a terminal alkene. The signal at 145 ppm with multiplicity (s) is a quaternary carbon, confirming the alkene structure is of the type R-C(R')=CH$_2$.\n    *   There are 6 signals for 7 carbons, meaning one signal must represent two chemically equivalent carbons.\n3.  **Deduce the Molecular Fragments**: I will determine the set of fragments that make up the molecule by analyzing the multiplicities. By testing which duplicated fragment results in the correct molecular formula C$_7$H$_{14}$, I'll find that the molecule contains three methyl groups in total, two of which are equivalent.\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**: Using the identified fragments (>C=CH$_2$, -CH$_2$-, -CH-, -CH$_3$, and two equivalent -CH$_3$), I will piece together the only structure that is chemically plausible and consistent with all the data. The two equivalent methyls on a methine carbon strongly suggest an isopropyl group.\n5.  **Assign Signals and Name the Compound**: I will assign each of the given NMR signals to a specific carbon in the proposed structure to verify the fit. Finally, I will determine the correct IUPAC name for the deduced structure.\n\nThis entire process will be detailed in the Python script below.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hydrocarbon_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided molecular formula and 13C NMR data to determine the\n    IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon compound.
