    "This is a music theory question. My plan is to first understand the musical terms in the user's request and then find a song by The Beatles that fits the description.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request**: The user is asking for a Beatles song that starts with a specific chord change.\n    *   **Tonic**: This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. For a song in C major, the tonic is C major. For a song in A minor, the tonic is A minor.\n    *   **Minor Fifth Chord**: This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale, but as a minor chord. In a minor key (like A minor), the fifth note is E. The chord built on this note in the *natural* minor scale is an E minor chord. This is the most common interpretation of a \"minor fifth chord\" relative to the key.\n    *   **Chord Jump**: This implies a direct and immediate change from the first chord to the second.\n\n2.  **Analysis**: I need to find a Beatles song in a minor key that starts with a progression from the tonic chord (i) to the minor dominant chord (v).\n    *   A great example is the song \"Things We Said Today\".\n    *   The song is in the key of **A minor**.\n    *   The tonic chord (i) is **A minor (Am)**.\n    *   The fifth note of the A minor scale is E. The minor chord built on it (v) is **E minor (Em)**.\n    *   The song's verse begins immediately with the lyrics \"You say you will love me...\", with the chords changing from **Am** to **Em**. This perfectly matches the user's description.\n\n3.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that states the answer and explains the music theory behind it using the `print()` function. The script will also print the core components of the musical \"equation\" as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and explains the Beatles song that matches\n    the user's music theory question.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Things We Said Today\"\n    artist = \"The Beatles\"\n    key = \"A minor\"\n    tonic_chord = \"A minor (Am)\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"E minor (Em)\"\n\n    # Print the main answer\n    print(f\"The song by {artist} that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the musical explanation:\")\n\n    # Print the components of the musical \"equation\"\n    print(f\"1. The song's key is {key}.\")\n    print(f\"2. The tonic chord (the 'I' chord) is {tonic_chord}.\")\n    print(f\"3. The minor fifth chord (the 'V' chord in a natural minor scale) is {minor_fifth_chord}.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe song's verse starts by moving directly from Am to Em, fitting the description perfectly.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Things We Said Today>>>"
