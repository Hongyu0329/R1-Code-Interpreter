    # Step 1: Analyze the definition of the 'self-stabilizing effect'.
    # The key phrase is that the effect is "driven by the increasing number of knowledge gaps that open up during the learning process."
    # This means: more learning -> more awareness of gaps -> more interest (stronger effect). It describes a positive feedback loop.

    # Step 2: Evaluate each option based on this definition and a logical progression through the learning phases.

    analysis = {
        'A': "The more knowledge you have, the more knowledge gaps occur, and the stronger is the self-stabilizing effect. -> This statement directly reflects the core mechanism described in the definition. It captures the positive feedback loop. While the effect might not increase indefinitely (it likely peaks in the intermediate phase), this statement is the best general description of the principle.",
        'B': "In the early learning phase, many knowledge gaps occur because students knowledge is fragmented and lot is unknown. Thus, the self-stabilizing effect is strongest. -> This is incorrect. In the early phase, a learner is often unaware of what they don't know. The number of *perceived* gaps is low, so the effect is weak.",
        'C': "The self-stabilizing effect peaks in the late learning phase, where a learnerâ€™s foundational understanding allows them to discover more knowledge gaps. -> This is incorrect. In the late phase, knowledge is comprehensive, meaning most gaps are filled. The effect would have peaked earlier.",
        'D': "none -> This is a possibility, but option A aligns well with the provided definition.",
        'E': "The self-stabilizing effect remains constant throughout all learning phases, as the number of knowledge gaps is constant for every gained knowledge. -> This is incorrect. The definition explicitly mentions an 'increasing number of knowledge gaps,' which contradicts the idea of a constant effect."
    }

    # Step 3: Conclude which statement is the most accurate.
    # Statement A is the only one that correctly describes the fundamental dynamic of the self-stabilizing effect as defined in the prompt.
    # It describes the process, while B and C incorrectly identify when the effect is strongest. E is logically inconsistent with the definition.
