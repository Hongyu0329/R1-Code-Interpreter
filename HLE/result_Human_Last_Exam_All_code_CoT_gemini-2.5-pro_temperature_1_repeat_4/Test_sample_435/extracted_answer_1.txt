CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would be predicted to exhibit increased and more sustained cytokine release (such as IFN-γ and TNF-α) upon antigen stimulation. This is because IL-15 promotes the development of a less differentiated, memory-like T cell phenotype with greater functional fitness and persistence compared to T cells manufactured without it.
