    "To find the number of involutions in the Projective Special Unitary group PSU(4, 997), we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and Involutions:**\n    The group is G = PSU(n, q), which is defined as `SU(n, q^2) / Z(SU(n, q^2))`, where `SU(n, q^2)` is the Special Unitary Group and `Z` is its center. We are given n=4 and q=997.\n    An involution in a group is an element `x` of order 2, meaning `x^2 = 1` (the identity element) and `x ≠ 1`.\n    In PSU(n, q), an element is a coset `gZ`. An involution `gZ` satisfies `(gZ)^2 = Z` and `gZ ≠ Z`. This implies `g^2` must be in the center `Z`, and `g` must not be in `Z`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Center Z(SU(4, 997^2)):**\n    The order of the center `Z(SU(n, q^2))` is `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n    For our case, `n=4` and `q=997`. So, `d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\n    This means the center `Z` has two elements: the identity matrix `I` and `-I`.\n\n3.  **Count the Pre-images in SU(4, 997^2):**\n    We need to count the number of elements `g` in `SU(4, 997^2)` such that `g^2 \\in Z = {I, -I}`. This count is the sum of two parts:\n    *   The number of elements `g` such that `g^2 = I`. Let's call this `k_I`. These are the identity and the involutions of `SU(4, q^2)`.\n    *   The number of elements `g` such that `g^2 = -I`. Let's call this `k_{-I}`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Calculation:**\n    Based on established results for finite classical groups, these quantities are given by the following formulas for `q` odd:\n    *   `k_I = 2 + q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1)`\n    *   `k_{-I} = q^2(q^3 + 1)`\n\n    The total number of pre-images is `S = k_I + k_{-I}`. The number of pre-images that are not in the center is `S - |Z| = S - 2`.\n    Since each coset `gZ` contains `|Z|=2` elements, the number of involutions in PSU(4, q) is:\n    `Num_involutions = (S - 2) / 2 = (k_I + k_{-I} - 2) / 2`\n    `= ( (2 + q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1)) + (q^2(q^3 + 1)) - 2 ) / 2`\n    `= ( q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1) + q^2(q^3 + 1) ) / 2`\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    We will use Python to compute this value for `q=997`. The code will calculate the two main terms of the numerator, sum them, and then perform the final division.\n\n```python\n# Plan: Calculate the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) using the derived formula.\n\n# 1. Set the value of q.\nq = 997\n\n# 2.
