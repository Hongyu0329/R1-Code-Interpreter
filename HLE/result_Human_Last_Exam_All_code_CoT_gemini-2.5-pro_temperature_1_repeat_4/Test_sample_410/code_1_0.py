# Based on the derivation, the problem's conditions lead to a system of equations
# for the coefficients a and b. After assuming a typo in the limit condition and
# solving the system, we found the intended values for a and b.

# The value of the coefficient 'a'
a = -3/4

# The value of the coefficient 'b'
b = 3

# Calculate the sum a + b
sum_ab = a + b

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
# We will print the summation explicitly.
print(f"The value of a is: {a}")
print(f"The value of b is: {b}")
print(f"The final equation is: {a} + {b} = {sum_ab}")
