    "To determine which peptide is most likely to bind an integrin receptor, we need to analyze the amino acid sequence of each option.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Recognize the Core Motif:** All five peptides contain the RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid) sequence. This is the fundamental recognition motif for a large family of integrin receptors.\n2.  **Analyze Flanking Residues:** The specificity and affinity of the RGD-integrin interaction are heavily influenced by the amino acid residues that surround the RGD core. Different integrins prefer different flanking sequences.\n3.  **Search for Known High-Affinity Sequences:** We will look for sequences that are derived from natural integrin ligands, such as fibronectin or vitronectin, as these are known to bind with high affinity. The sequence **RGDSP** is a well-characterized motif from fibronectin, a major component of the extracellular matrix that binds strongly to integrins like α5β1.\n4.  **Implement a Script:** I will write a Python script that simulates this search. The script will have a small \"database\" of known high-affinity motifs (in this case, 'RGDSP'). It will then scan the provided peptide options to find which one contains this well-established binding sequence. The script will then print the identified peptide and the reason for its selection.\n\n```python\ndef find_integrin_binding_peptide():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of RGD-containing peptides to find the one most likely\n    to bind an integrin receptor based on known high-affinity motifs.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of the candidate peptides provided in the question\n    peptides = {\n        \"A\": \"RGDMAA\",\n        \"B\": \"RGDSPSS\",\n        \"C\": \"RGDLTTP\",\n        \"D\": \"RGDQVSK\",\n        \"E\": \"RGDARGG\"\n    }\n\n    # A mock database of well-known high-affinity integrin-binding motifs.\n    # The RGDSP sequence is a famous motif from fibronectin, a natural ligand.\n    known_high_affinity_motifs = {\n        \"RGDSP\": \"a classic high-affinity binding site from the protein fibronectin, which binds strongly to integrins like α5β1 and αvβ3.\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing candidate peptides against a database of known motifs...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    found_candidate = False\n    for option, peptide_sequence in peptides.items():\n        for motif, description in known_high_affinity_motifs.items():\n            # Check if the known high-affinity motif is present in the candidate peptide\n            if motif in peptide_sequence:\n                print(f\"Result: Option {option} is the most likely candidate.\")\n                print(f\"Peptide Sequence: {peptide_sequence}\")\n                print(f\"Reason: This peptide contains the '{motif}' sequence.
