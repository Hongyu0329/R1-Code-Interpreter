    print("This program outlines the solution to a mathematical problem from set theory.")
    print("The problem asks for the second smallest possible length of a specific type of 'tower' of subsets of omega_2.")

    print("\n--- Step 1: Understanding the structure ---")
    print("The structure described is an unbounded tower under the 'almost subset' relation (subseteq*).")
    print("The length of such a tower is an ordinal, delta.")

    print("\n--- Step 2: Relating to Cardinal Characteristics ---")
    print("The minimum possible length of such a tower is a cardinal characteristic known as the tower number, t(omega_2).")
    print("It is a theorem that for any such tower of length delta, its cofinality must be at least the tower number.")
    print("Condition for a tower of length delta to exist: cf(delta) >= t(omega_2).")

    print("\n--- Step 3: The range of t(omega_2) ---")
    print("The value of t(omega_2) is not fixed by ZFC. However, it is provably a regular cardinal greater than omega_2.")
    print("The smallest possible value for t(omega_2) is the first regular cardinal after omega_2, which is omega_3.")
    print("It is consistent with ZFC to have t(omega_2) = omega_3.")

    print("\n--- Step 4: Determining all possible tower lengths ---")
    print("A cardinal delta is a 'possible' length if a tower of that length can exist in some model of ZFC.")
    print("This is true if and only if cf(delta) >= omega_3.")
    print(" - If cf(delta) >= omega_3, we can use a model with t(omega_2) = omega_3, and the condition is met.")
    print(" - If cf(delta) < omega_3, then cf(delta) <= omega_2. But t(omega_2) is always > omega_2, so the condition can never be met.")
    print("So, the set of all possible lengths is L = {delta | cf(delta) >= omega_3}.")

    print("\n--- Step 5: Finding the second smallest cardinal in L ---")
    print("We need to find the second smallest cardinal delta satisfying cf(delta) >= omega_3.")
    print(" - The smallest such cardinal is omega_3 itself (since cf(omega_3) = omega_3).")
    print(" - The next cardinal in sequence is omega_4.")
    print(" - The cofinality of omega_4 is omega_4, which is >= omega_3.")
    print(" - Since there are no cardinals between omega_3 and omega_4, omega_4 is the second smallest.")

    print("\n--- Final Answer ---")
    print("The second smallest possible cardinal delta is omega_4.")

    print(f"The smallest possible length for the tower is omega_{first_possible_length_index}.")
