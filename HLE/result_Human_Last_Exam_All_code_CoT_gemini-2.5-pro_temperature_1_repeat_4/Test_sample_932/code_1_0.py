def find_unlikely_tribes():
    """
    This function identifies and prints the indices of insect tribes whose
    immatures are unlikely to be collected using a beat-sheet method.

    The beat-sheet method is effective for insects on plant foliage.
    - 1) Apis: Immatures are in hives. Unlikely.
    - 2) Melipotini: Caterpillars on leaves. Likely.
    - 3) Eupholini: Larvae are internal borers. Unlikely.
    - 4) Acritini: Larvae in decaying matter. Unlikely.
    - 5) Oxyptilini: Caterpillars on leaves/flowers. Likely.
    - 6) Dictyophorini: Nymphs on plant stems. Likely.
    - 7) Acanthocerini: Larvae in rotting wood. Unlikely.

    The function will print the indices of the unlikely tribes in ascending
    order, separated by commas.
