    "The user wants to find the Szeged/Wiener index ratio for a specific molecule.\n\n### **Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecule**: The starting material is \"di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide\". This molecule has two perylene units connected by a disulfide (-S-S-) bridge at position 3 of each perylene. The \"major reduction product\" of a disulfide is formed by breaking the S-S bond and adding hydrogen, resulting in two thiol (-SH) molecules. Therefore, the molecule of interest is **perylene-3-thiol (C₂₀H₁₁SH)**.\n\n2.  **Represent as a Graph**: The molecule will be represented as an undirected graph where atoms are the nodes (vertices) and chemical bonds are the edges. The problem states that hydrogen atoms must be included in the graph. The final graph will have 20 Carbon, 12 Hydrogen, and 1 Sulfur atom, for a total of 33 nodes.\n\n3.  **Use Libraries**: I will use the `rdkit` library to reliably construct the molecular structure and `networkx` to represent it as a graph and perform calculations.\n\n4.  **Construct the Graph**:\n    *   Generate a perylene molecule with explicit hydrogens using `rdkit`.\n    *   Identify a carbon atom corresponding to the IUPAC \"3-position\" and the hydrogen atom attached to it.\n    *   Build a `networkx` graph by adding all atoms from the perylene molecule *except* for the identified hydrogen on C3.\n    *   Add two new nodes to the graph: a Sulfur atom (S) and a Hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Add edges corresponding to all the bonds in the original molecule, omitting the bond to the removed hydrogen.\n    *   Add two new edges to represent the new bonds: one from C3 to S, and one from S to H.\n\n5.  **Calculate Indices**:\n    *   **Wiener Index (W)**: First, calculate the shortest path distance between all pairs of nodes in the graph. The Wiener index is the sum of all these distances.\n        $W = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j} d(i,j)$\n    *   **Szeged Index (Sz)**: For each edge `e=(u,v)` in the graph, count the number of nodes closer to `u` than to `v` (`n_u`) and the number of nodes closer to `v` than to `u` (`n_v`). The Szeged index is the sum of the products `n_u * n_v` over all edges.\n        $Sz = \\sum_{e=(u,v) \\in E} n_u(e) \\cdot n_v(e)$\n\n6.  **Compute the Ratio**: Calculate the final ratio Sz / W and present the result.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Error: RDKit is not installed.
