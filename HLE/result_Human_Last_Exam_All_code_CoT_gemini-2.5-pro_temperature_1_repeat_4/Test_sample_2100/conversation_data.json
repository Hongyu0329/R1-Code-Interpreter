    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** I will break down the riddle into key pieces of information: the poet (Andrei Voznesensky), the description (\"a joy-discovering sailor\"), the mystery of the grave (\"Where is your grave?\"), and the timeline for its discovery (\"late 1980s\").\n2.  **Connect the Clues:** I will use these clues to identify the historical figure. The reference to Voznesensky is critical, as it points to his famous work, the rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\" This opera is about the Russian explorer and diplomat Nikolai Rezanov.\n3.  **Verify the Details:** I will confirm that the details about Rezanov's life and death match the riddle. He died in 1807, his grave was lost, and its location was indeed rediscovered in the late 1980s, largely due to the renewed interest sparked by the opera.\n4.  **Generate the Code:** I will write a simple Python script to declare the identified last name and print it as the solution.\n\n```python\n# The riddle describes the Russian diplomat and explorer Nikolai Rezanov.\n# The poet Andrei Voznesensky wrote the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\"\n# which is based on Rezanov's story.\n# In the opera, Voznesensky's poetry laments Rezanov's unknown resting place.\n# Rezanov's grave in Krasnoyarsk was lost during the Soviet era but was rediscovered in the late 1980s.\n\n# The man's last name is Rezanov.\nlast_name = \"Rezanov\"\n\nprint(f\"The last name of the man in the riddle is: {last_name}\")\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
