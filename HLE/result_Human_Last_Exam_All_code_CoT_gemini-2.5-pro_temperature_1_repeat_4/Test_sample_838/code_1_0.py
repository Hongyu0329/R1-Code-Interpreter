Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:

**Step 1: Starting Material to Product A**

*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene, whose IUPAC name is (3S)-3-bromo-1-phenylbutane. It's a secondary alkyl halide with a chiral center at carbon 3.
*   **Reagents & Reaction:** It is reacted with potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically bulky base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (elimination) reaction.
*   **Regioselectivity (Hofmann Rule):** Because t-BuOK is a large, bulky base, it preferentially removes the most sterically accessible proton. The protons on the terminal methyl group (C4) are less hindered than those on the internal methylene group (C2). This leads to the **Hofmann product**, which is the least substituted alkene.
*   **Product A:** The elimination reaction forms **4-phenylbut-1-ene**. This process removes the chiral center, so product A is achiral.
    *   Reaction: Ph-CH2-CH2-CH(Br)-CH3  ---(t-BuOK)-->  Ph-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2

**Step 2: Product A to Product B**

*   **Starting Material:** Product A, 4-phenylbut-1-ene.
*   **Reagents & Reaction:** The alkene is subjected to hydroboration-oxidation, using borane in THF (BH3/THF) followed by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).
*   **Regioselectivity (Anti-Markovnikov Addition):** This two-step process results in the **anti-Markovnikov** addition of water across the double bond. The hydroxyl (-OH) group is added to the less substituted carbon of the double bond (C1).
*   **Product B:** The resulting product is the primary alcohol, **4-phenylbutan-1-ol**. This molecule is achiral.
    *   Reaction: Ph-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2  ---(1. BH3/THF, 2. H2O2/NaOH)-->  Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH

**Step 3: Product B to Product C**

*   **Starting Material:** Product B, 4-phenylbutan-1-ol.
*   **Reagent & Reaction:** The alcohol is treated with phosphorous tribromide (PBr3), a standard reagent for converting primary and secondary alcohols into alkyl bromides.
*   **Mechanism:** The reaction proceeds via an SN2-like mechanism, where the -OH group is replaced by a bromine atom.
*   **Product C:** The final product is **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**.
    *   Reaction: Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH  ---(PBr3)-->  Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br

**Conclusion: The Final Product C**

*   **IUPAC Name:** The final product, C, is **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**.
*   **Chirality:** The molecule is **achiral**. The original stereocenter was destroyed in the first elimination step, and no new stereocenters were formed in the subsequent reactions.
