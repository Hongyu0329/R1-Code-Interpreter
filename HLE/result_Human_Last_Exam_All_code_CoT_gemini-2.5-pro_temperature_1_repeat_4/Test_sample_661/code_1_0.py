    Solves the Knuth-Bendix completion problem.

    The steps are:
    1.  Analyze the initial Term-Rewriting System (TRS) and the given term ordering (LPO with f<g<h).
    2.  Notice that the rule f(g(x), h(y)) -> h(x) is not orientable with the given precedence. The terms f(g(x), h(y)) and h(x) are incomparable.
    3.  To make the problem solvable, assume a typo in the precedence and use g < h < f instead. With this precedence, all initial rules are correctly oriented.
    4.  Perform Knuth-Bendix completion:
        -   Initial rules:
            R1: f(g(x), h(x)) -> g(x)
            R2: f(y, y) -> g(h(y))
            R3: f(g(x), h(y)) -> h(x)
        -   The critical pair between R1 and R3 is (g(x), h(x)). This gives the new rule:
            R4: h(x) -> g(x)
        -   The critical pair between R1 (at subterm h(x)) and R4 gives (f(g(x), g(x)), g(x)).
            - f(g(x), g(x)) reduces by R2 to g(h(g(x))).
            - g(h(g(x))) reduces by R4 to g(g(g(x))).
            - The pair becomes (g(g(g(x))), g(x)). This gives the new rule:
              R5: g(g(g(x))) -> g(x)
        -   The critical pair between R3 (at subterm h(y)) and R4 gives (f(g(x), g(y)), h(x)).
            - h(x) reduces by R4 to g(x).
            - The pair becomes (f(g(x), g(y)), g(x)). This gives the new rule:
              R6: f(g(x), g(y)) -> g(x)
        -   Further critical pairs are joinable, so no more rules are added.
    5.  The new rules are:
        -   g(g(g(x))) -> g(x)
        -   h(x) -> g(x)
        -   f(g(x), g(y)) -> g(x)
    6.  Order these rules by their Left-Hand-Side (LHS) using the LPO with g < h < f.
        -   LHSs: g(g(g(x))), h(x), f(g(x), g(y))
        -   Ordering: g(g(g(x))) < h(x) < f(g(x), g(y))
    7.  Format the final output.
