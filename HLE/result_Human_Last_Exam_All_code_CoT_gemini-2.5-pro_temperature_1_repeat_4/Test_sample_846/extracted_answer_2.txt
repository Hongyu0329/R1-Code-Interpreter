To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its physical shape in response to sunlight. At sunrise, the UV radiation from the sun should cause the table to convert from its stable, flat *trans* form to a bent *cis* form. At sunset, as the UV light disappears, the table should relax back from the bent *cis* form to its original flat *trans* shape.
