    This function addresses the puzzle of finding the smallest number of pieces (k)
    to cut a square into, such that they can be reassembled into the square in
    exactly 5 distinct ways.

    This is a known problem in recreational mathematics, often called Wallace's Problem.
    The number of reassemblies (5) is unusual because it is not a divisor of 8,
    which is the number of symmetries of a square. This indicates that the solution
    is not straightforward.

    The problem is one of geometric dissection and has been explored by experts.
    - The original solution by Wallace used k = 7 pieces.
    - An improved solution was later found by Greg N. Frederickson, who achieved
      the same result with k = 6 pieces.

    Currently, 6 is the smallest known value for k. It has not been formally proven
    to be the absolute minimum, but it is the best-known answer.
