    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to determine the product of the specified Wittig reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Reactants**: The reaction involves pivalaldehyde and a phosphonium ylide, specifically (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane.\n2.  **Understand the Wittig Reaction**: This reaction forms an alkene by coupling an aldehyde (or ketone) with a phosphonium ylide. The carbonyl oxygen (C=O) of the aldehyde is replaced by the carbon group of the ylide (the part double-bonded to phosphorus), forming a new C=C double bond. The other product is triphenylphosphine oxide.\n3.  **Determine Structures**:\n    *   Pivalaldehyde: (CH₃)₃C-CHO\n    *   Ylide: (C₆H₅)₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), where the chloro group is at the ortho (2-) position on the phenyl ring.\n4.  **Construct the Product**: The `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` part of pivalaldehyde combines with the `=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)` part of the ylide.\n    *   This forms the alkene: (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl).\n5.  **Name the Product**: The systematic IUPAC name for this structure is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n6.  **Write Python Code**: I will write a Python script using the `rdkit` library to represent this chemical reaction. The code will:\n    *   Define the reactants and products using their SMILES strings (a standard chemical notation).\n    *   Calculate the molecular formula for each compound to verify the reaction is balanced.\n    *   Print the full reaction equation, including the names and molecular formulas of all species involved, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to detail the reaction:\n\n```python\n# First, ensure you have rdkit installed:\n# pip install rdkit\n\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem.rdMolDescriptors import CalcMolFormula\n\ndef get_molecular_formula(smiles: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Calculates the molecular formula from a SMILES string.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n        if mol is None:\n            return \"Invalid SMILES\"\n        return CalcMolFormula(mol)\n    except Exception as e:\n        return f\"Error: {e}\"\n\n# --- Reactants ---\npivalaldehyde_name = \"pivalaldehyde\"\n# SMILES for (CH3)3C-CHO\npivalaldehyde_smiles = \"CC(C)(C)C=O\"\n\nylide_name = \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane\"\n# SMILES for (C6H5)3P=CH-CH2-(ortho-chlorophenyl)\nylide_smiles = \"c1(Cl)ccccc1CC=[P](c2ccccc2)(c3ccccc3)c4ccccc4\"\n\n# --- Products ---\nproduct_name = \"1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene\"\n# SMILES for (CH3)3C-CH=CH-CH2-(ortho-chlorophenyl).
