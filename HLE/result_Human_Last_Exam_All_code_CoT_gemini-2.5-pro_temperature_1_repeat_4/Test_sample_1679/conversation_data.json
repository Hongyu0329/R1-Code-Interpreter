    "Of course. Here is the plan to find the answer:\n1.  First, I will identify the locations of the two ancient Luxor Obelisks that exist today. One is in Luxor, Egypt, and the other was moved to Paris, France.\n2.  Next, I will review the list of Academy Award winners for Best Picture in chronological order.\n3.  For each film, I will determine its setting to see if it takes place in either Luxor or Paris.\n4.  Once a film set in one of these locations is found, I will verify if the specific landmark (the Luxor Temple or the Place de la Concorde) and the obelisk are actually shown on-screen.\n5.  The first film on the list that meets these criteria will be the answer.\n\nBased on this plan, I have determined that while earlier Best Picture winners like *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) were set in Paris, the first winner to definitively and famously depict the Luxor Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde is *An American in Paris* (1951).\n\n```python\ndef find_first_oscar_winner_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the first Academy Award Best Picture winner\n    to feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: There are two Luxor Obelisks.
