# Define the symbols for the variables and constants in the problem.
# C: Gate capacitance per unit area (the quantity we want to find)
# e: Elementary charge
# h: Planck's constant
# B: Magnetic field
# V1: The voltage at which the first quantum Hall feature is observed

# Step 1: The carrier density 'n' in an FET is given by the capacitor model:
# n = (C * V_bg) / e
# where V_bg is the backgate voltage.

# Step 2: In the quantum Hall effect, the carrier density 'n' is also given by:
# n = nu * (e * B) / h
# where 'nu' is the Landau level filling factor.

# Step 3: By equating the two expressions for 'n', we get:
# (C * V_bg) / e = nu * (e * B) / h

# Step 4: We can solve for the voltage V_bg:
# V_bg = nu * (e**2 * B) / (C * h)
# This shows that the gate voltage is directly proportional to the filling factor nu.

# Step 5: The problem states that features are seen at V1, 3*V1, and 5*V1.
# This means the corresponding filling factors are in the ratio 1:3:5.
# We can therefore associate the first voltage, V1, with the first filling factor, nu = 1.

# Step 6: Substitute V_bg = V1 and nu = 1 into the equation from Step 4:
# V1 = 1 * (e**2 * B) / (C * h)

# Step 7: Solve for the gate capacitance C.
# C * V1 * h = e**2 * B
# C = (e**2 * B) / (h * V1)

# Now, we print the final formula.
