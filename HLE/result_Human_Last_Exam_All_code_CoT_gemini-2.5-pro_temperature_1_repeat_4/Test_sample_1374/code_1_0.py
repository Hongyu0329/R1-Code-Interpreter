# The problem asks for the maximum distance from a point A to the surface of a 
# 1 cubic meter volume of playdough, shaped to create the strongest possible 
# gravitational field at A.

# The optimal shape is defined in spherical coordinates by the surface r = k * sqrt(cos(θ)),
# where A is at the origin (r=0). The volume of this shape is given by the formula:
# V = (4 * pi * k^3) / 15

# The furthest point on the surface from A corresponds to the maximum value of r.
# This occurs when cos(θ) is maximum (i.e., cos(θ) = 1).
# So, the maximum distance is r_max = k.

# We are given that the volume V is 1 cubic meter. We can use this to solve for k.
# 1 = (4 * pi * k^3) / 15
# Rearranging the formula to solve for k:
# k^3 = (15 * V) / (4 * pi)
# k = ( (15 * V) / (4 * pi) )^(1/3)

# Define the variables for the final equation
