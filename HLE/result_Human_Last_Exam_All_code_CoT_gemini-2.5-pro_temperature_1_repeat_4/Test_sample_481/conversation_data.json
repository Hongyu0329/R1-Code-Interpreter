    "Of course. I will identify the numerical imprints on each capsule and then determine which numbers are different between the two.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will define the numerical imprint for the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule, which is \"3105\".\n2.  I will define the numerical imprint for the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule, which is \"3106\".\n3.  I will use Python to compare these two sets of numbers and find the digits that are not shared.\n4.  The script will then print the numbers on each capsule and finally output the numbers that are different.\n\n```python\ndef find_different_imprints():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the different numbers on Teva brand fluoxetine\n    10mg and 20mg capsules.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Numerical imprints on the capsules, excluding non-numeric parts\n    imprint_10mg = \"3105\"\n    imprint_20mg = \"3106\"\n\n    # Create sets of the individual numbers (digits) for easy comparison\n    set_10mg = set(imprint_10mg)\n    set_20mg = set(imprint_20mg)\n\n    # Find the numbers that are not present in both sets (the symmetric difference)\n    different_numbers = sorted(list(set_10mg.symmetric_difference(set_20mg)))\n\n    # Output the results as requested\n    print(\"The numbers on the 10mg capsule are: \" + \", \".join(list(imprint_10mg)))\n    print(\"The numbers on the 20mg capsule are: \" + \", \".join(list(imprint_20mg)))\n    print(\"\\nThe different numbers imprinted on the capsules are: \" + \", \".join(different_numbers))\n\nfind_different_imprints()\n```\n<<<5, 6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
