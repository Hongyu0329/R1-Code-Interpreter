    "To find the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, we need to determine the number of unique, independent Lie bracket structures that can be formed with 10 elements. This is a classic problem in the study of free Lie algebras.\n\nThe solution is given by Witt's formula, which calculates the dimension of the n-th graded component of a free Lie algebra on k generators. In the context of the BCH formula for `log(exp(X)exp(Y))`, we have two generators (X and Y), so `k=2`. The order of the expansion is `n=10`.\n\nWitt's formula is:\n`L_n(k) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n\nWhere:\n-   `n = 10` (the order)\n-   `k = 2` (the number of generators)\n-   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n-   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nMy plan is to implement a Python script that performs the following steps:\n1.  Set `n=10` and `k=2`.\n2.  Find all divisors of `n`.\n3.  For each divisor `d`, calculate the Möbius function `μ(d)`.\n4.  Calculate each term `μ(d) * k^(n/d)` in the sum.\n5.  Sum all the terms and divide by `n` to get the final result.\n6.  The script will print out each step of the calculation to show how the final number is derived.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of the prime factors of num and their powers.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        # If any prime factor is repeated (i.e., n is not square-free), mu(n) is 0.\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    \n    # If n is square-free, mu(n) is (-1)^k where k is the number of distinct prime factors.\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\n# --- Main Calculation ---\nn = 10  # The order of the BCH expansion\nk = 2   # The number of generators (X and Y)\n\nprint(f\"Calculating the number of nonzero coefficients of order {n} using Witt's formula.\")\nprint(f\"L_n(k) = (1/n) * sum over d|n of (mu(d) * k^(n/d))\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\n\ndivisors = get_divisors(n)\nprint(f\"For n = {n}, the divisors 'd' are: {', '.join(map(str, divisors))}\\n\")\n\ntotal_sum = 0\ncalculation_terms = []\n\nprint(\"Calculating each term of the sum:\")\nfor d in divisors:\n    mu_d = mobius(d)\n    exponent = n // d\n    term_val = mu_d * (k**exponent)\n    \n    print(f\"d = {d:2}:  mu({d}) * {k}^({n}/{d}) = {mu_d:2} * {k}^{exponent:<2} = {term_val:5}\")\n    \n    total_sum += term_val\n    calculation_terms.append(str(term_val))\n\nsum_expression = \" + \".join(f\"({t})\" if int(t) < 0 else t for t in calculation_terms)\n\nprint(\"\\nFinal calculation:\")\nprint(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * ({sum_expression})\")\nprint(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * {total_sum}\")\n\nresult = total_sum // n\nprint(f\"L_{n}({k}) = {result}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order {n} is {result}.\")\n<<<99>>>\n```"
