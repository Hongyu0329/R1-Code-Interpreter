    "Based on StarCraft lore, the Second Great War began in the year 2504 and concluded with the reclamation of Aiur and the defeat of Amon's host body in 2506.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the duration of the war.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The Second Great War in StarCraft lore started in 2504.\nstart_year = 2504\n\n# The war is considered to have ended with the defeat of Amon's forces on Aiur in 2506.\nend_year = 2506\n\n# Calculate the duration\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# Round the duration up to the nearest whole number as requested.\n# In this case, the result is already an integer.\nrounded_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\nprint(f\"The Second Great War began in {start_year} and ended in {end_year}.\")\nprint(f\"Equation: {end_year} - {start_year} = {duration}\")\nprint(f\"The total duration, rounded up, is {rounded_duration} years.\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
