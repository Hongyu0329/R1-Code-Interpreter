    "My plan to find the separatrix of the system is as follows:\n\n1.  **Find Equilibrium Points:** I will first find the equilibrium points (also known as fixed points or critical points) of the system by setting both derivatives, $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$, to zero and solving the resulting algebraic equations for $d$ and $u$.\n\n2.  **Classify Equilibrium Points:** Next, I will determine the stability and type of each equilibrium point. This is done by calculating the Jacobian matrix of the system and evaluating its eigenvalues at each equilibrium point. An equilibrium point is a saddle point if its eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs.\n\n3.  **Identify the Separatrix:** Separatrices are special trajectories in the phase plane that separate regions of different long-term behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are always separatrices. I will focus on finding the equation for one of these manifolds.\n\n4.  **Find the Equation of the Separatrix:** I will look for an invariant manifold, which is a curve that is a union of trajectories. I'll test a simple polynomial form, like $d = au^2 + bu + c$, by substituting it into the original differential equations. If the equation holds for some constant values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, then we have found an invariant manifold.\n\n5.  **Verification:** I will then verify that this invariant manifold passes through the saddle point and that its slope at the saddle point matches the direction of the corresponding eigenvector (either stable or unstable). This will confirm that the curve is indeed the separatrix we are looking for.\n\nFollowing this plan, I have derived the equation for the separatrix. The python code below will print this equation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the derived equation of the separatrix for the given system of ODEs.\n    The derivation steps are outlined in the text explanation.\n    The separatrix is found to be the unstable manifold of the saddle point (1, -1),\n    and its equation is d = -u^2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The equation of the separatrix is d = -u^2.\n    # We will display this equation, explicitly showing the numbers involved as requested.\n    # The equation can be written as d = -1 * u^2.\n    \n    coefficient = -1\n    variable = 'u'\n    power = 2\n    \n    # We use sympy to format the equation nicely.\n    u = sympy.Symbol(variable)\n    d = sympy.Symbol('d')\n    \n    equation = sympy.Eq(d, coefficient * u**power)\n    \n    # Print the equation with explicit numbers as requested\n    print(\"The equation for the separatrix is:\")\n    print(f\"d = {coefficient} * {variable}**{power}\")\n    \n    # For a more standard mathematical output:\n    print(\"\\nIn standard mathematical notation:\")\n    print(sympy.pretty(equation))\n\nsolve_separatrix()\n```\n<<<d = -u**2>>>"
