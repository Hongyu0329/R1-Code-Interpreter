    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Represent the Permutations and Group**: I will represent the generating permutations $a$, $b$, and $c$ using the `sympy` library in Python. The set of 12 elements $\\{ 1, 2, ..., 9, x, y, z \\}$ will be mapped to the integer range $\\{0, 1, ..., 11\\}$ for compatibility with `sympy`. Then, I will create the permutation group $G$ generated by these permutations.\n2.  **Compute the Schur Multiplier**: I will use the `schur_multiplier()` method from `sympy` to compute the Schur multiplier of $G$, which we denote as $A$. This method returns the structure of the abelian group $A$ as a list of orders of cyclic groups in its decomposition (e.g., `[n1, n2]` for $C_{n1} \\times C_{n2}$).\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of A**: The result from the previous step gives us the structure of $A$. To count its subgroups up to isomorphism, I'll need to analyze this structure. The number of non-isomorphic subgroups of a finite abelian group is the product of the number of non-isomorphic subgroups of its Sylow p-subgroups.\n4.  **Count Non-Isomorphic Subgroups**: For each prime $p$ dividing the order of $A$, I will determine the structure of the Sylow p-subgroup (as a partition type $\\lambda$). Then, I will calculate the number of non-isomorphic subgroups for that p-group. I have implemented a function that handles common, simple partition types, which are expected for the Schur multipliers of such groups.\n5.  **Calculate Final Answer**: The total number of non-isomorphic subgroups of $A$ is the product of the counts from each Sylow p-subgroup. The number of *proper* subgroups is this total minus one (to exclude the group $A$ itself). The code is designed to print out each step of this calculation clearly.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom functools import reduce\nimport operator\nfrom sympy.combinatorics import Permutation\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.perm_groups import PermutationGroup\n\ndef count_iso_p_subgroups(p, lam):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of non-isomorphic subgroups of an abelian p-group\n    of type lambda.
