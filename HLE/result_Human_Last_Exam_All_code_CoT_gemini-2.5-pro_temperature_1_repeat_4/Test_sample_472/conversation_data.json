    "The user wants me to provide the scansion for the Latin line: `\"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"`.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Meter**: This line is not from classical epic poetry (like Virgil or Ovid) which typically uses dactylic hexameter. It is from the Roman playwright Plautus (*Trinummus*, line 249). Plautine comedies use meters like iambic senarius or, in this case, a **trochaic septenarius**.\n\n2.  **Understand the Meter**: A trochaic septenarius consists of seven trochaic feet (`L S` or `— ˘`) followed by a final syllable, making 15 syllables in total. The pattern is often represented as:\n    `L S | L S | L S | L S || L S | L S | L S`\n    The double bar `||` indicates the main caesura (a pause) that typically occurs after the fourth foot.\n    In Plautine meter, many substitutions are allowed:\n    *   A spondee (`L L`) can replace a trochee (`L S`).\n    *   A long syllable can be \"resolved\" into two short syllables, so a trochee (`L S`) can become a tribrach (`S S S`).\n    *   Other substitutions like an iamb (`S L`) or a pyrrhic (`S S`) are also possible in certain positions.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Line Syllable by Syllable**: I will break the line down into its 15 syllables and determine the quantity (long 'L' or short 'S') of each, applying the rules of Latin prosody with allowances for Plautine conventions like hiatus (not eliding a vowel at a word boundary).\n\n4.  **Group Syllables into Feet**: I will group the syllables into the seven feet of the trochaic septenarius meter, identifying any substitutions used.\n\n### Step-by-Step Scansion\n\n*   **Line**: `et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male`\n*   **Syllabification (15 syllables, with hiatus between `bene` and `esse`)**:\n    `et | ti-bi | be-ne | es-se | so-li | quom | si-bi | sit | ma-le`\n\n*   **Foot 1**: `et ti`\n    *   `et`: Long by position (the vowel 'e' is followed by two consonants: 't' and the 't' of `tibi`). -> **L**\n    *   `ti`: Short by nature, open syllable. -> **S**\n    *   Result: `L S` (a perfect trochee).\n\n*   **Foot 2**: `bi be ne`\n    *   `bi` (from `tibi`): Short. -> **S**\n    *   `be` (from `bene`): Short. -> **S**\n    *   `ne` (from `bene`): Short. -> **S**\n    *   Result: `S S S` (a tribrach, which is a \"resolved\" trochee).\n\n*   **Foot 3**: `es se`\n    *   `es`: Long by position (vowel 'e' is followed by 'ss'). -> **L**\n    *   `se`: Short by nature, open syllable. -> **S**\n    *   Result: `L S` (a perfect trochee).\n\n*   **Foot 4**: `so li`\n    *   `so`: The 'o' in `solus` is naturally long. -> **L**\n    *   `li`: The 'i' in the dative `soli` is long. -> **L**\n    *   Result: `L L` (a spondee, a common substitution).\n    *   (This is the location of the main caesura).\n\n*   **Foot 5**: `quom si`\n    *   `quom`: Long by position (closed syllable ending in 'm'). -> **L**\n    *   `si` (from `sibi`): Short. -> **S**\n    *   Result: `L S` (a perfect trochee).\n\n*   **Foot 6**: `bi sit`\n    *   `bi` (from `sibi`): Short. -> **S**\n    *   `sit`: Long by position (vowel 'i' is followed by 't' and the 'm' of `male`). -> **L**\n    *   Result: `S L` (an iamb, a permitted substitution).\n\n*   **Foot 7**: `ma le`\n    *   `ma`: Short by nature, open syllable. -> **S**\n    *   `le`: Short by nature, open syllable. -> **S**\n    *   Result: `S S` (a pyrrhic, a permitted substitution in the final position).\n\nCombining these feet gives the complete scansion for the line. The following Python code will print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the scansion of the Latin line:\n    \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n    The meter is a trochaic septenarius.\n    'L' stands for a long syllable, 'S' for a short syllable.\n    Feet are separated by spaces.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The scansion is determined by analyzing each foot according to the rules of Plautine meter.\n    foot1 = \"L S\"  # et ti\n    foot2 = \"S S S\" # bi be ne (resolved trochee)\n    foot3 = \"L S\"  # es se\n    foot4 = \"L L\"  # so li (spondee)\n    foot5 = \"L S\"  # quom si\n    foot6 = \"S L\"  # bi sit (iamb)\n    foot7 = \"S S\"  # ma le (pyrrhic)\n    \n    # The final scansion is the combination of all feet.\n    final_scansion = f\"{foot1} {foot2} {foot3} {foot4} {foot5} {foot6} {foot7}\"\n    \n    print(final_scansion)\n\nsolve()\n<<<L S S S S L S L L L S S L S S>>>\n```"
