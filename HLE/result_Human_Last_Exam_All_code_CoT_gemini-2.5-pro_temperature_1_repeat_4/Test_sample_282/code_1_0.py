# Let's consider a compact set X within the subgroup N of SL_2(R).
# N consists of matrices of the form [[1, x], [0, 1]].
# Group multiplication in N corresponds to addition of the x-parameters.
# We choose X to correspond to an interval [c, d] for the parameter x.
c = 10.0
d = 20.0

# The "measure" of this set is proportional to the length of the interval.
measure_X = d - c

# The set X^3 = {m1*m2*m3 | m1, m2, m3 in X} corresponds to the sums
# x1+x2+x3, where x1, x2, x3 are in [c, d].
# The resulting interval for these sums is [3*c, 3*d].
c_cubed = 3 * c
d_cubed = 3 * d

# The measure of X^3 is proportional to the length of this new interval.
measure_X_cubed = d_cubed - c_cubed

# The ratio K is measure(X^3) / measure(X).
K = measure_X_cubed / measure_X

# We print the calculation step-by-step.
