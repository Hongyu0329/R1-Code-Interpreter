    # The problem is about the decay rate of the spherical average of the squared Fourier
    # transform of a Frostman measure.
    # Let A(r) = integral_{S^1} |hat(mu)(r*sigma)|^2 d(sigma).
    # The problem states that for every s-Frostman measure mu, A(r) = O_eps(r^{c+eps}).
    # We need to find the smallest possible c for this to hold.

    # Step 4 & 5: Use known results to bound c.
    # A result by T. Wolff on the annulus integral of |hat(mu)|^2 implies that c must be less than or equal to -s.
    # Conversely, sharpness examples (constructions based on Salem sets) show that there exist
    # measures for which the decay is not faster than r^{-s}.
    # For the statement to hold for all measures, c must be greater than or equal to -s.
    
    # Step 6: Conclude the value of c.
    # The two conditions, c <= -s and c >= -s, together imply that c must be equal to -s.
    c = -s
