# The source text is the problem description.
source_text = "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills. In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute. Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant. Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code. Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation! Start the python block with ```python"

# Split the text into words based on spaces.
words = source_text.split()

# The sequence has 33 numbers, so we find the 34th word (index 33).
next_word = words[33]

# The transformation rule is to add the ASCII values of the first and last characters.
first_char = next_word[0]
last_char = next_word[-1]

ord_first = ord(first_char)
ord_last = ord(last_char)

result = ord_first + ord_last

# As requested, output the numbers in the final equation.
print(f"The next word in the sequence is '{next_word}'.")
print(f"The ASCII value of the first character '{first_char}' is {ord_first}.")
print(f"The ASCII value of the last character '{last_char}' is {ord_last}.")
print(f"The equation is: {ord_first} + {ord_last} = {result}")
print(f"The next number in the sequence is: {result}")
