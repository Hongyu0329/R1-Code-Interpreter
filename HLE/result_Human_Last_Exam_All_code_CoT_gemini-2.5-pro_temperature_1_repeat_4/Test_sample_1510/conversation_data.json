    "My plan is to solve this problem by first encoding the known information about the 17 wallpaper groups into a Python data structure. Specifically, I will create a dictionary where the keys are the names of the wallpaper groups (e.g., 'p1', 'p2', etc.) and the values are the orders of their corresponding point groups.\n\nThen, the script will perform the following steps:\n1.  Iterate through this dictionary.\n2.  For each wallpaper group, it will check if the order of its point group is exactly 2.\n3.  It will collect the names of all groups that meet this criterion.\n4.  Finally, it will print the list of these groups and display the total count as a sum, fulfilling the request to show the numbers in the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef find_wallpaper_groups_by_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the wallpaper groups with a point group of a specific order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping each of the 17 wallpaper groups to the order of its point group.\n    wallpaper_group_data = {\n        'p1': 1,\n        'p2': 2,\n        'pm': 2,\n        'pg': 2,\n        'cm': 2,\n        'p2mm': 4,\n        'p2mg': 4,\n        'p2gg': 4,\n        'c2mm': 4,\n        'p4': 4,\n        'p4mm': 8,\n        'p4gm': 8,\n        'p3': 3,\n        'p3m1': 6,\n        'p31m': 6,\n        'p6': 6,\n        'p6mm': 12\n    }\n\n    target_order = 2\n    \n    # Find the groups with a point group of the target order.\n    found_groups = [name for name, order in wallpaper_group_data.items() if order == target_order]\n    \n    print(f\"The wallpaper groups with a point group of order {target_order} are:\")\n    for group_name in found_groups:\n        print(f\"- {group_name}\")\n    \n    # Build and print the final equation.\n    count = len(found_groups)\n    if count > 0:\n        equation_parts = ['1'] * count\n        equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n        print(f\"\\nThe total number is: {equation_str} = {count}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"\\nThere are 0 groups with a point group of order {target_order}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to find the answer.\nfind_wallpaper_groups_by_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
