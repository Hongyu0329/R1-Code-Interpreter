# --- Main logic to construct and print the molecule's properties and SMILES ---

# 1. Deconstruct the problem parameters
valence_electrons = 80
formal_charge = 0
molecular_weight = 198.159
heavy_atoms = 14
heteroatoms = 6
nh_oh_groups = 6 # Interpreted as 6 N-H bonds
h_bond_acceptors = 4
h_bond_donors = 4
tertiary_amines = 2
secondary_amines = 2
primary_amines = 2
amidine_groups = 2
azo_groups = 1
rings = 0
rotatable_bonds = 4

# 2. Determine Molecular Formula
# Heavy atoms = 14; Heteroatoms = 6 (N/O). Problem implies all are Nitrogen.
# So, 6 Nitrogen atoms and 14 - 6 = 8 Carbon atoms.
# MW of C8N6 = 8*12.011 + 6*14.007 = 96.088 + 84.042 = 180.13
# MW of H = 198.159 - 180.13 = 18.029
# Number of H = 18.029 / 1.008 approx 18.
# Formula: C8H18N6
# Valence e- check: 8*4 (C) + 18*1 (H) + 6*5 (N) = 32 + 18 + 30 = 80. Correct.

# 3. Resolve contradictions and build the structure
# The primary conflict is that 2 primary, 2 secondary, and 2 tertiary amines
# would typically yield 6 H-bond donors and 6 acceptors, but the prompt demands 4 of each.
# My hypothesis is that a specific structure deactivates two acceptor sites via resonance.
# A structure of R-C(=NH)-NH-N=N-NH-C(=NH)-R' (a tetrazene-bis-amidine) fits this.
# - It has 4 donors (the four N-H groups).
# - It has 4 acceptors (the two =NH groups and the two N=N nitrogens, with the -NH- nitrogens'
#   lone pairs being delocalized and thus non-accepting).
# - The core itself has C2H4N6. We need to add C6H14 as R and R' groups.
# - The rotatable bond count of 4 must come from these R and R' groups.
# - A combination of n-propyl (3 rotatable bonds) and isopropyl (1 rotatable bond) adds up to 4.
#   R = -CH2CH2CH3 (n-propyl)
#   R' = -CH(CH3)2 (isopropyl)
# This results in the final structure.

# 4. Define the final SMILES representation
final_smiles = "CCC(=N)NN=NNC(=N)C(C)C"

# 5. Output the results
