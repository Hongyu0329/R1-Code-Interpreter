    This function solves the definite integral derived from the problem statement.
    
    The problem asks for the value of the integral of u(x,y,-y,1) with respect to x from 0 to 1.
    By analyzing the PDE and the initial condition u(x,y,z,0), we find that on the line z = -y,
    the system is stationary. This means u(x,y,-y,t) = u(x,y,-y,0) for all t.

    First, we find the expression for u(x,y,-y,0):
    u(x,y,-y,0) = -3 * (2*e^x + 1) * e^(x+y-y) / ((e^x + 1) * e^(x+y-y) + 1)
                 = -3 * (2*e^x + 1) * e^x / ((e^x + 1) * e^x + 1)
                 = -3 * (2*e^(2x) + e^x) / (e^(2x) + e^x + 1)

    So, we need to compute the definite integral of this function from x=0 to x=1.
    The integral is: âˆ«[0,1] -3 * (2*e^(2x) + e^x) / (e^(2x) + e^x + 1) dx

    This integral can be solved analytically. Let f(x) = e^(2x) + e^x + 1.
    Then f'(x) = 2*e^(2x) + e^x.
    The integrand is -3 * f'(x) / f(x).
    The antiderivative is -3 * ln(f(x)) = -3 * ln(e^(2x) + e^x + 1).

    Evaluating from 0 to 1:
    -3 * [ln(e^2 + e + 1) - ln(e^0 + e^0 + 1)]
    = -3 * [ln(e^2 + e + 1) - ln(3)]
    = 3 * ln(3 / (e^2 + e + 1))
    
    We will use numerical integration in Python to verify this result.
