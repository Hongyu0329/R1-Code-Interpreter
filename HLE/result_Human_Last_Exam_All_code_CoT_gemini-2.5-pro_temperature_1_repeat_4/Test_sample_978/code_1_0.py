    # Step 1: Analyze the incident involving Mark and the pool.
    print("Incident 1: Mark and the Pool Damage")
    print("  - Mark's Action: Mark was operating the mower as part of his job. His distraction and subsequent actions were negligent.")
    print("  - Mark's Liability: As the person who acted negligently, Mark is personally liable for the damage.")
    print("  - Evergreen's Liability: Under the doctrine of 'vicarious liability', an employer is liable for the negligent acts of its employees committed within the scope of employment. Mark was working, so Evergreen is also liable.")
    print("  - Neighbour's Liability: The neighbour's dog and short fence are likely considered too remote to be a direct or proximate cause of the damage. Mark's negligence was an intervening act. Thus, the neighbours are not liable.")
    print("  - Conclusion for Incident 1: Mark and Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. are jointly and severally liable for the pool-related damages.\n")

    # Step 2: Analyze the incident involving Lincoln and the car.
    print("Incident 2: Lincoln and the Car Damage")
    print("  - Lincoln's Action: Lincoln knowingly used a blower on rocks near a car, which constitutes negligence (or potentially an intentional tort).")
    print("  - Lincoln's Liability: As the person who caused the damage, Lincoln is personally liable.")
    print("  - Effect of 'Minimal' Damage: The law does not ignore damage just because it is small, especially to high-value property like a Ferrari. Liability is not excused.")
    print("  - Evergreen's Liability: Just like with Mark, Lincoln was acting within the scope of his employment. Therefore, Evergreen is vicariously liable for the damage Lincoln caused.")
    print("  - Conclusion for Incident 2: Lincoln and Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. are jointly and severally liable for the car-related damages.\n")

    # Step 3: Evaluate the options based on the analysis.
    print("Evaluating the final answer choices...")
    print("  - We need the option that states Mark and Evergreen are liable for the first event, AND Lincoln and Evergreen are liable for the second event.")
    print("  - Choice E correctly separates the two incidents and applies vicarious liability to the employer in both cases.")
    print("-" * 50)

    # Step 4: Final Answer
    final_answer = "E"
