    "This is a knowledge-based question. My plan is to identify the correct philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School based on my knowledge of the history of philosophy and semiotics. The distinction between natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (signals) is a key concept in semiotics, and a specific member of this school is known for this work. I will then provide a simple Python script to print the name of this philosopher.\n\n```python\ndef find_philosopher():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the Lviv-Warsaw School\n    philosopher known for distinguishing between symptoms and signals.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The philosopher in question is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n    # In his work on semiotics and the philosophy of language, he analyzed\n    # signs ('znaki' in Polish) and their meanings. He distinguished between\n    # natural signs, which he called symptoms ('oznaki'), and conventional\n    # signs, which function as signals ('sygna≈Çy'). This analysis is\n    # part of his decomposition of how one thing can be a hallmark of another.\n    philosopher = \"Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\"\n    print(f\"The Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who decomposes the notion of hallmark into symptoms and signals is: {philosopher}\")\n\nfind_philosopher()\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
