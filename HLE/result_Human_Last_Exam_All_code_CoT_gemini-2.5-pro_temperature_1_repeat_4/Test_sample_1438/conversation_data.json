    "In the path integral formalism for quantum mechanics, particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle (fermions) are described by fields that are not ordinary numbers but are instead Grassmann variables.\n\nThe key property of Grassmann variables (e.g., `ψ₁`, `ψ₂`) is that they anticommute:\n`ψ₁ψ₂ = -ψ₂ψ₁`\n\nA direct and crucial consequence of this is that the square of any Grassmann variable is zero:\n`ψψ = -ψψ`  => `2ψ² = 0` => `ψ² = 0`.\n\nThis `ψ² = 0` property is the mathematical embodiment of the Pauli exclusion principle within the path integral. It means that it's impossible for two fermions to occupy the same state, as the term representing that configuration would be mathematically zero.\n\nTo perform integrals over these variables, a specific set of rules, known as the Berezin integral, is defined. The \"value\" or definition of the integral measure `dψ` is given by two fundamental rules that are consistent with the anticommuting algebra.\n\nThe following Python code simulates a single Grassmann variable and demonstrates the application of these integration rules. We represent a function of a Grassmann variable, `f(ψ) = A + Bψ`, as an object and then define an integral function that applies the correct rules.\n\n```python\nclass GrassmannFunction:\n    \"\"\"\n    A simple class to represent a function of a single Grassmann variable psi.\n    Since psi*psi = 0, any function can be written as f(psi) = A + B*psi.\n    We represent this as an object with attributes self.const = A and self.linear = B.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, const_part, linear_part):\n        self.const = const_part  # The constant part (A)\n        self.linear = linear_part # The part proportional to psi (B)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        # Creates a string representation like \"A + B*psi\"\n        const_str = str(self.const)\n        linear_str = str(self.linear)\n\n        if self.const == 0 and self.linear == 0:\n            return \"0\"\n        if self.linear == 0:\n            return const_str\n        if self.const == 0:\n            if self.linear == 1:\n                return \"psi\"\n            elif self.linear == -1:\n                return \"-psi\"\n            else:\n                return f\"{linear_str}*psi\"\n        \n        op = \"+\" if self.linear > 0 else \"-\"\n        if abs(self.linear) == 1:\n             return f\"{const_str} {op} psi\"\n        else:\n             return f\"{const_str} {op} {abs(self.linear)}*psi\"\n             \n    def __mul__(self, other):\n        # Implements (A + B*psi) * (C + D*psi) = A*C + (A*D + B*C)*psi\n        # The B*D*psi*psi term is zero.\n        new_const = self.const * other.const\n        new_linear = self.const * other.linear + self.linear * other.const\n        return GrassmannFunction(new_const, new_linear)\n\ndef berezin_integral(func):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the Berezin integration rules:\n    ∫ d(psi) (A + B*psi) = B\n    The integral of a Grassmann function is defined to be the coefficient\n    of the linear term.\n    \"\"\"\n    return func.linear\n\n# --- Main Demonstration ---\n\n# Define the base Grassmann variable, psi = 0 + 1*psi\npsi = GrassmannFunction(0, 1)\n\n# Define a constant function, one = 1 + 0*psi\none = GrassmannFunction(1, 0)\n\nprint(\"In the Grassmann algebra, the Pauli exclusion principle is encoded by the property psi^2 = 0.\")\nprint(f\"Let's represent our variable as: psi = {psi}\")\npsi_squared = psi * psi\nprint(f\"Calculating psi * psi results in: {psi_squared}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\nprint(\"The integral measure 'd(psi)' is defined by the following rules:\")\nprint(\"Rule 1: The integral of a constant is zero.\")\nprint(\"Rule 2: The integral of the variable itself is one.\")\nprint(\"\\nLet's demonstrate these rules.\")\n\n# 1.

This leads to the two fundamental identities: `∫ dψ = 0` and `∫ dψ ψ = 1`.>>>"
