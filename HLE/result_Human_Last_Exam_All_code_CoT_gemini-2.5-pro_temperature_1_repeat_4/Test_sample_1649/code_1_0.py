# This script determines the smallest possible size of the limit of a functor
# with specific properties, and illustrates the reasoning with a concrete example.

# The problem asks for the smallest possible size of the limit lim_{J^{op}}F, given:
# 1. J is a directed poset.
# 2. F is a functor from J^{op} to Set.
# 3. Each set F(j) is non-empty.
# 4. Each associated map f_ij: F(j) -> F(i) (for i <= j) is surjective.

# A key result in mathematics (related to the Mittag-Leffler condition for sets,
# provable with the Axiom of Choice) states that for any such system, the
# inverse limit is guaranteed to be non-empty.
# This means the size of the limit set must be at least 1.

# To find the smallest *possible* size, we need to show that a size of 1
# is achievable. We can do this by constructing a valid example.

# Let's define such an example:
# Let J be the set of natural numbers N = {0, 1, 2, ...} with the usual order,
# which is a directed poset.

# For each n in N, let F(n) be a singleton set. We'll use the set {0}.
# This satisfies the non-empty condition.
def get_set_F(n):
  """Represents the set F(n) for our example."""
  return {0}

# For m <= n, the map f_mn from F(n) to F(m) must be defined.
# Since F(n) = {0} and F(m) = {0}, there is only one possible function.
def get_map_f(m, n, element_from_F_n):
  """Represents the map f_mn for our example."""
  if m > n:
    raise ValueError("Map f_mn is only defined for m <= n.")
  # The map sends the single element of F(n) to the single element of F(m).
  return 0

# The limit of F is the set of all compatible sequences (x_0, x_1, x_2, ...).
# A sequence is compatible if for all m <= n, f_mn(x_n) = x_m.

# Let's find the elements of the limit in our example.
# An element in the limit is a sequence x = (x_0, x_1, ...) where x_n is in F(n).
# Since F(n) = {0} for all n, the only possible sequence is (0, 0, 0, ...).

# Let's call this sequence `the_limit_element`.
# the_limit_element = (0, 0, 0, ...)

# We must verify if it's compatible. For any m <= n:
# x_n = 0
# x_m = 0
# We check if get_map_f(m, n, x_n) equals x_m.
# get_map_f(m, n, 0) returns 0, which is indeed equal to x_m.
# The compatibility condition holds.

# Therefore, the sequence (0, 0, 0, ...) is the *only* element in the limit set.
# The size of the limit set for this example is 1.

# Conclusion:
# The size must be >= 1.
# We found an example where the size is exactly 1.
# So, the smallest possible size is 1.
