Step-by-step analysis of the options:

1.  **Analyze Option A (Through direct vasodilation):** Magnesium is known to act as a natural calcium channel blocker. Calcium ions are essential for the contraction of smooth muscle cells found in the walls of blood vessels. When magnesium is present, it competes with calcium and blocks its entry into these cells. This inhibition leads to the relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle, causing the blood vessels to widen (a process called vasodilation). Vasodilation reduces the resistance to blood flow, thereby lowering blood pressure. This is a well-established and primary mechanism.

2.  **Analyze Option B (By protecting elastic fibers from calcium deposition):** While it's true that arterial calcification contributes to long-term hypertension and magnesium plays a role in calcium regulation, this is a more indirect and chronic effect. The primary, more immediate mechanism by which magnesium supplementation lowers blood pressure is through its vasodilatory effects.

3.  **Analyze Option C (By increasing white matter and gray matter in the brain):** This relates to brain structure and neurological health. While the central nervous system regulates blood pressure, this is not the direct peripheral mechanism of action for magnesium supplementation.

4.  **Analyze Option D (By stimulating an inflammatory response):** Inflammation is generally associated with endothelial dysfunction and can contribute to *increasing* blood pressure, not lowering it. This statement is incorrect.

5.  **Analyze Option E (It raises systemic blood calcium levels):** This is physiologically incorrect. Magnesium and calcium often have an antagonistic relationship. Magnesium does not raise blood calcium levels; in fact, it can interfere with calcium's effects.

Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the most accurate and direct mechanism is vasodilation.
