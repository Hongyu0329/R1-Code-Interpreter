    # According to a theorem by Montesinos, M is homeomorphic to M_n(K) x S^1,
    # where M_n(K) is the n-fold cyclic branched cover of S^3 over the knot K.
    # In our case, M is homeomorphic to M_5(trefoil) x S^1.
    # The fundamental group is pi_1(M) = pi_1(M_5(trefoil)) x pi_1(S^1).

    # The trefoil knot group is <x, y | x^2 = y^3>.
    # G = pi_1(M_5(trefoil)) is obtained by adding the relation m^5 = 1, where m is a meridian.
    # A meridian for the trefoil is m = xy^{-1}.
    # So, G has the presentation <x, y | x^2 = y^3, (xy^{-1})^5 = 1>.

    # The group G is generated by two elements, x and y, so d(G) <= 2.
    # To find if it can be generated by one element, we check if it is cyclic.
    # A cyclic group is abelian. The abelianization of G, G_ab, is Z_5.
    # If G were abelian, it would be Z_5. However, substituting the abelian condition
    # into the relations shows the group would be trivial, a contradiction.
    # Therefore, G is not abelian, not cyclic, and d(G) > 1.
    # Since 1 < d(G) <= 2, the minimal number of generators for G is 2.

    # It can be generated by a single element (1 or -1).
    d_Z = 1
    print(f"The group of integers Z has a minimal set of {d_Z} generator.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Step 4: Calculating the minimal number of generators for G x Z
    # For a direct product of a finite group G and the integers Z,
    # the minimal number of generators is d(G x Z) = d(G) + d(Z).
    # G is finite because it is the fundamental group of a closed 3-manifold, M_5(trefoil),
