    # Part (a): On the decomposition of V(p).
    # The level k = -2 + 1/p indicates a logarithmic theory where the module category
    # is not semisimple. This means a decomposition into a direct sum of simple modules
    # is not generally possible. The structure is typically one of extensions and indecomposable modules,
    # not a tensor product.

    # Part (b): Top-level dimension of L(p)_n.

    # As a VOA, V(p) must contain the vacuum vector of weight 0, and all conformal weights
    # must be non-negative. So the minimum is 0.
    # We can verify this by calculating the highest weights h_n of the modules L(p)_n
    # using the Sugawara construction.
    # The formula is h_n = (p * n * (n + 2)) / 8.
    # We need to find the minimum for n >= 0 when p = 2.
