    "To find the largest number `c` such that there exists a set `A\\subseteq \\{1,…,N\\}` with size `|A|= (c+o(1))N` where the sumset `A+A` contains no square numbers, we can follow this plan:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understanding the Problem:** The condition `|A|= (c+o(1))N` means we are looking for the highest possible asymptotic density `c` for such a set `A`.\n2.  **The \"Modular Obstruction\" Method:** A powerful way to construct such a set `A` is to use modular arithmetic. If we can find a modulus `m` and a set of residues `R \\subseteq \\{0, 1, ..., m-1\\}` such that the sumset `R+R = \\{r_1+r_2 \\pmod m \\mid r_1, r_2 \\in R\\}` contains no quadratic residues modulo `m`, then we can construct our set `A` as `A = \\{n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} \\mid n \\pmod m \\in R\\}`. For such an `A`, any sum `a_1+a_2` will be congruent to a number in `R+R \\pmod m`. Since `R+R` avoids all quadratic residues modulo `m`, `a_1+a_2` can never be a square. The density of this set `A` would be `c = |R|/m`.\n3.  **Finding the Best Modulus:** Our goal is to maximize this density `c = |R|/m`. We can write a program to search for the best `(m, R)` pair that gives the maximum density. The program will:\n    a. Iterate through a range of moduli `m`.\n    b. For each `m`, determine the set of quadratic residues `Q_m`.\n    c. Find the largest subset `R` of residues modulo `m` such that `R+R` has no elements in common with `Q_m`.\n    d. Calculate the density `|R|/m` and keep track of the maximum density found.\n4.  **Implementing the Search:** The number of possible sets `R` for a modulus `m` is `2^m`, which grows very fast. The search will be feasible for small `m` (up to about 24). This is sufficient, as the best densities are typically found for very small moduli where the properties of quadratic residues are more constrained.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The script will output the best density found within its search range. This provides strong evidence for the value of `c`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the search:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script searches for the largest density c = |R|/m of a set A\n    such that A+A contains no square numbers, by examining modular constructions.\n    \"\"\"\n    max_c = 0.0\n    best_construction = {}\n\n    # We limit the search to a reasonable range of moduli, as the search space grows as 2^m.\n    # The optimal density is expected to be found for a small modulus.\n    max_m_to_check = 16 \n\n    print(f\"Searching for the best density c = |R|/m for m from 2 to {max_m_to_check}...\\n\")\n\n    for m in range(2, max_m_to_check + 1):\n        # Step 1: Find all quadratic residues modulo m\n        q_m = set(i*i % m for i in range(m))\n\n        # Step 2: Find the largest subset R of {0,...,m-1} such that R+R has no quadratic residues\n        best_R_for_m = set()\n        max_len_R = 0\n\n        # Iterate through all possible subsets R of {0, ..., m-1}\n        # We iterate from largest possible R to smallest to find the max size faster\n        for k in range(m, 0, -1):\n            found_k = False\n            for R_tuple in itertools.combinations(range(m), k):\n                R = set(R_tuple)\n                is_valid = True\n                \n                # Check the condition for R+R\n                # itertools.product generates all pairs (r1, r2) from R, including (r,r)\n                for r1, r2 in itertools.product(R, repeat=2):\n                    if (r1 + r2) % m in q_m:\n                        is_valid = False\n                        break\n                if not is_valid:\n                    continue\n\n                # Found a valid R of size k\n                max_len_R = k\n                best_R_for_m = R\n                found_k = True\n                break\n            if found_k:\n                break\n        \n        # Step 3: Calculate the density and update the maximum\n        c_m = max_len_R / m if m > 0 else 0\n        \n        # Prepare the output string for the best set R\n        r_str = str(sorted(list(best_R_for_m))) if best_R_for_m else \"{}\"\n\n        print(f\"m = {m:2d}: Q_{m} = {sorted(list(q_m))}\")\n        print(f\"     Best R = {r_str}, |R| = {max_len_R}, Density |R|/m = {max_len_R}/{m} = {c_m:.4f}\")\n        print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n        if c_m > max_c:\n            max_c = c_m\n            best_construction = {'m': m, 'R': best_R_for_m, 'c': c_m, 'fraction': f\"{max_len_R}/{m}\"}\n\n    print(\"\\nSearch complete.\")\n    print(f\"The largest density found is c = {best_construction.get('c', 0):.4f}\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to the fraction {best_construction.get('fraction', 'N/A')}.\")\n    m = best_construction.get('m')\n    R = best_construction.get('R')\n    if m is not None:\n      print(f\"A valid construction is the set of numbers n such that (n mod {m}) is in {R}.\")\n\n\nsolve()\n<<<1/3>>>\n```"
