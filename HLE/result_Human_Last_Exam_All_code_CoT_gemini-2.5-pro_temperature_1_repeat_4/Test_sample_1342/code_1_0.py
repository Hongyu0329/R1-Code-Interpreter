    # Choice A
    # Part 1: "The proteins coded by genes targeted by sgRNA7 and sgRNA3 do not play a role in activating qNCS."
    # sgRNA3: Ki67+ is 1% (control level) despite successful knockdown. So, the protein is not an inhibitor. Correct.
    # sgRNA7: Ki67+ is 1% (control level). Although knockdown failed, the result shows the protein at normal levels is not the limiting factor. Plausible interpretation: it does not play a key inhibitory role.
    # Part 2: "A low-calorie diet may increase qNCS activation in aged mice"
    # Glucose starvation increased Ki67+ in old mice from 3% to 6%. Correct.
    analysis_A = "Evaluates to TRUE. Both parts are supported by the data under a reasonable interpretation. It is a comprehensive summary of key findings from both experiments."
    print(f"A. The proteins coded by genes targeted by sgRNA7 and sgRNA3 do not play a role in activating qNCS. A low-calorie diet may increase qNCS activation in aged mice.\n   - Analysis: {analysis_A}\n")

    # Choice F
    # Part 1: "The activation of the qNCS in old mice can be increased by down-regulation of the gene GLUT-4."
    # Old mice control Ki67+ is 3%, with sgRNA8 it's 6%. This part is TRUE.
    # Part 2: "The activation of the qNCS in old mice can not be increased by glucose starvation."
    # Old mice control Ki67+ is 3%, with glucose starvation it's 6%. Activation was increased. This part is FALSE.
    analysis_F = "Evaluates to FALSE. The second statement directly contradicts the data."
    print(f"F. The activation of the qNCS in old mice can be increased by down-regulation of the geneGLUT-4. The activation of the qNCS in old mice can not be increased by glucose starvation.\n   - Analysis: {analysis_F}\n")
