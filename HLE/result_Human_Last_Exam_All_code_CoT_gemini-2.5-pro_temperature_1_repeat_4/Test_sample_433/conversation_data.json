    "The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for sterile preparations is determined by guidelines from the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), specifically chapter <797>. The BUD for a single-dose container depends critically on the environment in which it is opened.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will:\n1.  Define the BUD for a single-dose container opened in a sterile environment (ISO Class 5 or better), which is the scenario specified in your question.\n2.  Define the BUD for the same container if it were opened in a less clean environment for context and safety.\n3.  Print a clear statement that answers your question based on these established guidelines.\n\n```python\ndef get_bud_for_single_dose_container():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose\n    container based on the environment in which it is punctured,\n    according to USP <797> guidelines.\n    \"\"\"\n    # BUD in hours for a single-dose container punctured in a sterile environment\n    # (ISO Class 5 or cleaner).\n    bud_in_sterile_env_hours = 12\n\n    # For context, the BUD in hours for a container opened outside a sterile environment.\n    bud_outside_sterile_env_hours = 1\n\n    # The user's question specifies a sterile environment.\n    print(f\"The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose container ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment (e.g., an ISO Class 5 PEC) is up to {bud_in_sterile_env_hours} hours.\")\n    print(\"\\nIt is important to note that if the same ampule were opened in an environment worse than ISO Class 5, the contents must be used within 1 hour or discarded.\")\n\nget_bud_for_single_dose_container()\n```\n<<<12>>>"
