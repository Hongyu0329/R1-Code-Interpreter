    "To solve this problem, we need to find the common eigenvalues for the total angular momentum squared operator, $J^2$, and the z-component of the total angular momentum operator, $J_z$. The total angular momentum $\\vec{J}$ is the sum of the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ and the spin angular momentum $\\vec{S}$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the quantum numbers**: For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 1`. For an electron, the spin quantum number is `s = 1/2`.\n2.  **Find the possible total angular momentum quantum numbers (j)**: The possible values for `j` are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan series, ranging from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n3.  **Calculate the eigenvalues of J²**: For each value of `j`, the eigenvalue of the $J^2$ operator is given by the formula `ħ² * j * (j + 1)`.\n4.  **Calculate the eigenvalues of Jz**: For each value of `j`, the magnetic quantum number `m_j` can take values from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps. The corresponding eigenvalue of the $J_z$ operator is `ħ * m_j`.\n5.  **List the common eigenvalues**: For each common eigenstate, identified by the pair of quantum numbers `(j, m_j)`, we will list the corresponding pair of eigenvalues `(ħ²*j*(j+1), ħ*m_j)`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan and prints out all the possible common eigenvalues.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \n    A p-electron has orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1 and\n    spin quantum number s=1/2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the quantum numbers\n    l = 1.0  # Orbital angular momentum for a p-electron\n    s = 0.5  # Spin angular momentum for an electron\n    \n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with l = {l} and s = {s}.\")\n    print(\"The eigenvalues of J^2 are of the form j*(j+1)ħ².\")\n    print(\"The eigenvalues of J_z are of the form m_j*ħ.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    # Step 2: Find the possible total angular momentum quantum numbers (j)\n    j_values = np.arange(abs(l - s), l + s + 1, 1)\n    \n    # Step 3 & 4: Loop through j and m_j to find all eigenvalue pairs\n    for j in j_values:\n        # Calculate the eigenvalue for J^2\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        # m_j ranges from -j to +j in steps of 1\n        mj_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n        \n        for mj in mj_values:\n            # The eigenvalue for J_z is simply mj\n            jz_eigenvalue = mj\n            \n            # Step 5: Print the results for each common eigenstate |j, m_j>\n            print(f\"For the state with quantum numbers j = {j} and m_j = {mj}:\")\n            # The request is to output each number in the final equation.\n            print(f\"  Eigenvalue of J^2 = {j} * ({j} + 1) ħ² = {j2_eigenvalue} ħ²\")\n            print(f\"  Eigenvalue of J_z = {jz_eigenvalue} ħ\")\n            print(\"\") # Add a blank line for readability\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n```\n<<<For a p-electron (l=1, s=1/2), the possible total angular momentum states are j=3/2 and j=1/2.
