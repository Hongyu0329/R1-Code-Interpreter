    Analyzes the provided medical case and determines the best next diagnostic step.
    
    The case describes a 43-year-old man with a rash in the axillae.
    Key points:
    - History: Started a new workout program with new clothing 3 weeks ago.
    - Physical Exam: Rash on the posterior border of axillary folds, sparing the axillary vaults.
    - Suspected Diagnosis: Allergic contact dermatitis from textiles.
    
    The question asks for the best next step in diagnosis.
    
    Let's evaluate the options:
    A. Skin biopsy: This is an invasive procedure. While it can show inflammation, it's not specific for identifying the allergen and is not the first-line diagnostic tool for suspected allergic contact dermatitis (ACD).
    B. KOH preparation: This test is used to identify fungal infections. While a fungal infection is in the differential, the history and distribution of the rash make ACD much more likely.
    C. Topical steroid: This is a form of treatment, not a diagnostic procedure. While a response to treatment can support a diagnosis, it does not identify the cause.
    D. Patch test: This is the gold standard for diagnosing type IV hypersensitivity reactions, such as allergic contact dermatitis. It involves applying suspected allergens to the skin to identify the specific trigger (e.g., dyes or resins in clothing). This is the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis.
    E. None of the above: Since the patch test is the correct answer, this option is incorrect.
    
    The best next step to confirm the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis and identify the causative allergen is the patch test.
