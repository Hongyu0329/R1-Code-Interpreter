    print("Let's analyze this using a proof by contradiction.\n")

    print("Step 1: Assume such a program exists.")
    print("Let's call this hypothetical program 'P'.")
    print("Program P takes 10000 as input and computes the result.")
    print("Let's call the result 'S'. So, S = def_superfast(10000).\n")

    print("Step 2: Understand what 'S' represents.")
    print("By the definition in the pseudo-code:")
    print("S = (The largest integer output by any Python program < 10000 symbols) + 1\n")

    print("Step 3: Construct a new program, 'Q'.")
    print("We can easily write a new program, 'Q', that simply contains the code for 'P' and then prints its result.")

    print("--------------------")

    print("Step 4: Analyze our new program 'Q'.")
    print("a) What is the length of Q's source code?")
    print("   The code for P is complex, but finite. Let's say it's 8000 symbols long.")
    print("   The extra 'print(...)' adds very few symbols.")
    print("   So, we can definitely make the total length of Q's source code less than 10000 symbols.\n")
    print("b) What is the output of Q?")
    print("   Q runs P and prints the result. So, Q's output is the integer S.\n")

    print("Step 5: The Contradiction.")
    print("We have arrived at a logical contradiction. Consider these two facts:")
    print("1. By definition, S is GREATER THAN the output of ANY program with source code < 10000 symbols.")
    print("2. Our program Q has source code < 10000 symbols, and its output IS S.")
    print("\nThis implies that S must be greater than S (S > S), which is impossible.\n")

    print("Step 6: Conclusion.")
    print("Because our initial assumption (that program P exists) leads to a logical paradox, the assumption must be false.")
    print("Therefore, no program P can compute def_superfast(10000). The function is uncomputable.")
