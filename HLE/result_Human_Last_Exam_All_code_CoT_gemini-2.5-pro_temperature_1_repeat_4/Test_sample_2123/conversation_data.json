    "This is a classic word-play riddle that relies on translation between English and Russian. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Identify the key geographical feature:** The \"wide boulevards of Vienna\" most famously refers to the Ringstrasse, which translates to \"Ring Boulevard\".\n2.  **Translate the key term:** The crucial word here is \"Ring\". In Russian, the word for \"ring\" is \"кольцо\" (pronounced \"kol'tso\").\n3.  **Find the phonetic link:** The riddle implies that a translator made a connection or a pun. We need to find the surname of a famous English poet that sounds phonetically similar to the Russian word \"кольцо\" (kol'tso).\n4.  **Identify the poet:** The surname of the English Romantic poet Samuel Taylor **Coleridge** is a very close match. In Russian, his name is written as \"Кольридж\" (pronounced \"Kol'ridzh\"), which is phonetically very similar to \"кольцо\".\n\nThe code below will print out this surname.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle based on a phonetic pun between Russian and English.\n    1. The \"Ring\" boulevard in Vienna is \"кольцо\" (kol'tso) in Russian.\n    2. This sounds like the surname of the English poet, Coleridge.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The surname of the English poet.\n    poet_surname = \"Coleridge\"\n    \n    print(\"The riddle describes the Vienna Ringstrasse ('Ring Boulevard').\")\n    print(\"The Russian word for 'ring' is 'кольцо' (kol'tso).\")\n    print(\"This sounds very similar to the surname of the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the surname is:\")\n    \n    # The final 'equation' is simply the resulting name.\n    # We will print each character of the name as if it were a component of an equation.\n    final_answer_components = \" + \".join(list(poet_surname))\n    print(f\"{final_answer_components} = {poet_surname}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Coleridge>>>"
