    "To find the number of positive definite even lattices of a given dimension and determinant, we turn to the mathematical theory of integral quadratic forms.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Lattice Type:** The problem asks for the number of positive definite even lattices with dimension `n = 17` and determinant `d = 2`. In the classification literature, these are often referred to as Type II lattices.\n2.  **Check Existence Conditions:** For a Type II lattice of odd dimension `n` to exist, its determinant `d` must satisfy the condition `d ≡ ±2 (mod 8)`. My script will first verify this necessary condition for the given parameters.\n3.  **State the Known Result:** The precise number of non-isomorphic lattices for a given dimension and determinant is a deep result in number theory. These numbers, called class numbers, have been computed and tabulated by mathematicians. The definitive source for this information is the book \"Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups\" by J.H. Conway and N.J.A. Sloane. Specifically, Table 16.7 lists the class numbers for Type II lattices.\n4.  **Implement the Script:** The Python script will first check the existence condition. If it passes, the script will then retrieve and print the known, tabulated number of lattices for dimension 17 and determinant 2. This approach uses code to validate the problem's premises and provides the precise, known answer.\n\n```python\ndef count_lattices(dimension, determinant):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the number of positive definite even lattices for a given\n    dimension and determinant, based on known mathematical results.\n\n    This specific function handles the case for dimension 17, determinant 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = dimension\n    d = determinant\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension {n} and determinant {d}.\")\n\n    # For a positive definite even lattice (Type II) of odd dimension n,\n    # a necessary condition is that the determinant d must be congruent\n    # to +/- 2 modulo 8.\n    is_odd_dim = (n % 2 != 0)\n    \n    if is_odd_dim:\n        print(f\"Dimension n={n} is odd.
