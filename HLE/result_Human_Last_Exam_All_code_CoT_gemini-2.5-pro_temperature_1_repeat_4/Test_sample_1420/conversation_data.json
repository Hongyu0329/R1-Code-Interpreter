    "To determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a system with spatial dimension d=3, we will use the epsilon (ϵ) expansion, a cornerstone of renormalization group theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$):** For the class of models including the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models, the upper critical dimension is $d_c=4$. Above this dimension, mean-field theory provides the correct scaling exponents.\n2.  **Define Epsilon ($\\epsilon$):** The expansion is performed in the small parameter $\\epsilon = d_c - d$. Given $d=3$, we have $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n3.  **State the Formula for $\\alpha$:** The formula for the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ to the first order in $\\epsilon$ for the n-component vector model is:\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)} \\epsilon$\n4.  **Assume the Model:** The problem does not specify the model. We will use the most common case, the Ising model, which has a scalar order parameter, so the number of components is $n=1$.\n5.  **Calculate $\\alpha$:** Substitute $n=1$ and $\\epsilon=1$ into the formula and compute the result.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** Write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the equation with all the numerical values, showing the step-by-step substitution.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha using the epsilon expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define parameters as rational numbers for precise symbolic calculation\n    d = sympy.Rational(3)   # Spatial dimension\n    d_c = sympy.Rational(4) # Upper critical dimension for the Ising model class\n    n = sympy.Rational(1)   # Number of components of the order parameter (Ising model)\n\n    # Calculate epsilon\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n\n    # Define the formula for alpha to first order in epsilon\n    # alpha = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * epsilon\n    numerator = 4 - n\n    denominator = 2 * (n + 8)\n    alpha = (numerator / denominator) * epsilon\n\n    # Print the explanation and the step-by-step calculation\n    print(\"This script calculates the specific heat scaling exponent α for the Ising model\")\n    print(\"in d=3 dimensions using the first-order epsilon expansion.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"The spatial dimension is d = {int(d)}.\")\n    print(f\"The upper critical dimension is d_c = {int(d_c)}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of order parameter components (Ising model) is n = {int(n)}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe expansion parameter is calculated as ε = d_c - d = {int(d_c)} - {int(d)} = {int(epsilon)}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe first-order formula for the exponent α is: (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ε\")\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\")\n    # Using sympy objects to show the fractional form\n    final_equation = f\"α = ({int(4)} - {int(n)}) / (2 * ({int(n)} + {int(8)})) * {int(epsilon)}\"\n    print(final_equation)\n    \n    step2_equation = f\"α = {int(numerator)} / (2 * {int(n+8)}) * {int(epsilon)}\"\n    print(step2_equation)\n\n    step3_equation = f\"α = {int(numerator)} / {int(denominator)} * {int(epsilon)}\"\n    print(step3_equation)\n    \n    final_result_fraction = f\"α = {alpha}\"\n    print(final_result_fraction)\n\n    final_result_decimal = f\"α ≈ {float(alpha):.4f}\"\n    print(final_result_decimal)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_alpha_exponent()\n```\n<<<0.16666666666666666>>>"
