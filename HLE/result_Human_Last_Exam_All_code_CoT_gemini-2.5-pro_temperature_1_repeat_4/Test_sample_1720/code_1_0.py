    # --- Step 2: Evaluate the Core Problem ---
    # The patient has necrotic tissue which is likely the source of a systemic infection (sepsis),
    # leading to septic shock. Failed PO/topical antibiotics suggest the need for systemic
    # treatment and that the source of infection must be physically removed.
    # Impaired venous return is causing tissue death and preventing medication from being effective.
    print("\nClinical Picture:")
    print("The combination of shock, necrotic tissue, and failed initial therapies points to septic shock requiring definitive source control.")

    # --- Step 3: Assess Treatment Options ---
    # A. Intravenous fluid: Critical for resuscitating the patient from shock.
    # B. Intravenous medication: Critical for treating systemic infection (sepsis).
    # C. Surgical debridement: Critical for source control - removing the engine of the sepsis.
    # D. Chemical debridement: Too slow and less effective for this severe, acute condition.
    # E. High-flow O2: Important supportive care for respiratory distress, but not a definitive treatment.

    # --- Step 4: Synthesize and Conclude ---
    # The patient requires immediate resuscitation (A, B) and definitive source control (C).
    # Option F (A & B) addresses resuscitation but not the source. Without source control, the patient will not improve.
    # Option G (B & C) addresses the treatment of sepsis and provides definitive source control.
    # This combination represents the most crucial therapeutic strategy to resolve the underlying disease process.
    # While fluids (A) would be given simultaneously, the combination of (B) and (C) is the cornerstone of definitive therapy.
