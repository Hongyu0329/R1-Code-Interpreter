    Calculates the smallest number of operations to transform a Fibonacci heap
    with a single chain of k items to a single chain of k+1 items.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. Insert the new node (k+1) into the heap. This adds it to the root list.
    2. Cut the last node of the original chain (k) from its parent (k-1).
       This is done with Decrease-key, making k a root.
    3. Insert a temporary dummy node with the smallest key.
    4. Call Delete-min to remove the dummy node. This triggers consolidation
       of all the roots, aiming to form the new k+1 chain.

    This sequence consists of 4 operations.
