# --- Plan ---
# The analysis hinges on understanding the statistical test being performed and the nature of the simulated data.
# 1. The R function `anova(fit_1, fit_2)` on lavaan objects performs a chi-square difference test to compare nested models.
# 2. Model 2 is nested within Model 1. The difference is that Model 2 constrains the path from `insect_richness` to `herbivory` to zero.
# 3. The data was explicitly simulated with a very strong `insect_richness -> herbivory` relationship (coefficient = 3.14).
# 4. Therefore, the null hypothesis of the test (that the path coefficient is zero) is known to be false.
# 5. The test will produce a large chi-square statistic, indicating a significant drop in model fit when the path is removed.
# 6. A very large chi-square statistic on 1 degree of freedom (the difference between the models is one path) results in a p-value that is practically zero.

# --- Code Demonstration ---

# The degrees of freedom for the chi-square difference test is the difference
# in the number of free parameters between the two models.
# Model 1 has one more parameter than Model 2.
df_difference = 1

# The strong effect (3.14) built into the data guarantees that the chi-square
# statistic from comparing the models will be very large. We can't know the exact
# value without running the R code, but for demonstration, let's use a large value like 100.
# A value above ~10.8 already gives a p-value < 0.001.
large_chi_square_statistic = 100.0

# The p-value is calculated from the survival function (1 - CDF) of the chi-square distribution.
# It represents the probability of observing our test statistic, or a more extreme one,
# if the null hypothesis were true.
p_value = scipy.stats.chi2.sf(large_chi_square_statistic, df=df_difference)

print("1. The test compares a full model (Model 1) with a restricted model (Model 2).")
print("2. The restriction in Model 2 is forcing the path 'insect_richness -> herbivory' to have a coefficient of 0.")
