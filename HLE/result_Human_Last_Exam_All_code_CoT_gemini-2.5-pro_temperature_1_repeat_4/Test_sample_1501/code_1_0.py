    # Part (a): True or False
    # Reasoning: We interpret an "ND-pair" as a pair of points on the same level,
    # e.g., {(x, 0), (y, 0)}. For any given point (z, i), the ND-pairs containing it
    # are of the form {(z, i), (y, i)} for all y in Q where y is not z.
    # There are v-1 such points y, so the statement is True.
    answer_a = "True"

    # Part (b): Expression for multiplicity
    # The multiplicity of any pair in an SQS(u) is lambda = (u-2)/2.
    # The given multiplicity in the SQS(v) is mu = (v-2)/2.
    # The multiplicity in the resulting SQS(2v) is lambda_2v = (2v-2)/2 = v-1.
    # We express v-1 in terms of mu.
    # From mu = (v-2)/2, we derive v = 2*mu + 2.
    # Substituting this into v-1:
    # Multiplicity = (2*mu + 2) - 1 = 2*mu + 1.
    # The numbers in this final equation are 2 and 1.
    answer_b_expression = "2*mu + 1"

    # Part (c): Yes/No
    # The multiplicity of any ND-pair is v-1, as derived for part (b).
    # Since v-1 is never equal to v, no ND-pair can have a multiplicity of v.
    answer_c = "No"

    # Print the final answer in the specified format.
