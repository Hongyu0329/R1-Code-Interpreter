The described repair process is a '{repair_description}'. This method is additive, meaning it is used to replace material that has been lost from a component.

We will now evaluate the answer choices based on this understanding:
- A. Stress Corrosion Cracking & E. Fatigue Cracking: These are crack-related failures. Repairing cracks is different from building up lost volume.
- B. Foreign Object Damage: This can cause localized material loss (nicks, gouges) that can be filled by welding, but it is not as routine as wear.
- D. Creep Deformation: This is the stretching of the entire blade and cannot be fixed by a local material build-up.
- F. High-Temperature Oxidation and Corrosion: This is surface degradation, typically repaired by recoating, not welding build-up.
- C. Blade Tip Rub and Wear: This is the gradual loss of material from the blade tip due to contact with the engine casing. The repair for this is precisely to 'build-up' the tip with new material to restore its original dimensions. This is a perfect match for the described repair method.

The main source of damage addressed by building up layers of material is therefore Blade Tip Rub and Wear.
