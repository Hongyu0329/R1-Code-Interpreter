    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** We are given an upper semilattice `J` and a tame functor `f` from `J` to the category of vector spaces, `Vect_K`. We need to find the integer `n` for which `f` is `n`-resolvable.\n\n2.  **Define Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Upper Semilattice (J):** A partially ordered set where every pair of elements has a least upper bound (a join).\n    *   **n-resolvable functor (f):** A functor `f` is `n`-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length `n`. This means there is an exact sequence `0 -> P_n -> ... -> P_1 -> P_0 -> f -> 0` where all `P_i` are projective functors. This is equivalent to saying the projective dimension of `f` is at most `n`.\n    *   **Projective Dimension:** The projective dimension of a functor `f`, denoted `proj.dim(f)`, is the smallest `n` such that the extension group `Ext^(n+1)(f, G)` is zero for all functors `G`. If `proj.dim(f) <= n`, then `f` is `n`-resolvable.\n\n3.  **Connect Poset Structure to Homological Algebra:** There is a fundamental theorem in the representation theory of posets that connects the structure of the poset `J` to the homological properties of the category of functors on it, `Func(J, Vect_K)`.\n\n4.  **State the Core Theorem:** The category `Func(J, Vect_K)` is a **hereditary category** if and only if the poset `J` is an **upper semilattice**.\n\n5.  **Interpret the Theorem:**\n    *   A category being \"hereditary\" means its global dimension is at most 1.\n    *   The global dimension of a category is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all its objects (functors in this case).\n    *   So, if `J` is an upper semilattice, the global dimension of `Func(J, Vect_K)` is at most 1.\n\n6.  **Draw the Conclusion:**\n    *   Since the global dimension of the entire category is at most 1, the projective dimension of *every* functor `f` in this category must be at most 1. That is, `proj.dim(f) <= 1`.\n    *   This applies to all functors, whether they are simple, indecomposable, or tame. The \"tame\" property is a specific classification, but the \"upper semilattice\" property of `J` is so strong that it constrains all functors.\n    *   If `proj.dim(f) <= 1`, it means that `f` is **1-resolvable**.\n    *   Therefore, the value of `n` is 1.\n\nThe following Python script formalizes this reasoning and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_resolvability():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the value of n for which a tame functor on an upper semilattice is n-resolvable.\n    The solution is based on a fundamental theorem in the representation theory of posets.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: State the core mathematical theorem.\n    # A key theorem states that the category of functors from a poset J to Vect_K,\n    # denoted Func(J, Vect_K), is a hereditary category if and only if J is an upper semilattice.\n    \n    # Step 2: Define what a hereditary category implies.\n    # A category is \"hereditary\" if its global dimension is at most 1.\n    # This means the projective dimension of any object (functor) in the category is at most 1.\n    \n    # Step 3: Relate projective dimension to n-resolvability.\n    # A functor f is n-resolvable if its projective dimension is less than or equal to n.\n    # proj.dim(f) <= n  <=>  f is n-resolvable.\n    \n    # Step 4: Synthesize the information.\n    # Since J is an upper semilattice, the category Func(J, Vect_K) is hereditary.\n    # Therefore, the projective dimension of any functor f in this category is at most 1.\n    # This applies to all functors, including the ones specified as \"tame\".\n    \n    # Step 5: Determine the value of n.\n    # From proj.dim(f) <= 1, we conclude that f is 1-resolvable.\n    # Thus, n must be 1.\n    n = 1\n    \n    # Step 6: Print the final answer and the reasoning.\n    print(\"Based on the properties of functors on an upper semilattice:\")\n    print(\"1. An upper semilattice 'J' implies the functor category Func(J, Vect_K) is hereditary.\")\n    print(\"2. A hereditary category has a global dimension of at most 1.\")\n    print(\"3.
