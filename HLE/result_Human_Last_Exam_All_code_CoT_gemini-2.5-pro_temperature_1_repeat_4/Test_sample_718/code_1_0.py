    # Step 1: State the core mathematical theorem.
    # A key theorem states that the category of functors from a poset J to Vect_K,
    # denoted Func(J, Vect_K), is a hereditary category if and only if J is an upper semilattice.
    
    # Step 2: Define what a hereditary category implies.
    # A category is "hereditary" if its global dimension is at most 1.
    # This means the projective dimension of any object (functor) in the category is at most 1.
    
    # Step 3: Relate projective dimension to n-resolvability.
    # A functor f is n-resolvable if its projective dimension is less than or equal to n.
    # proj.dim(f) <= n  <=>  f is n-resolvable.
    
    # Step 4: Synthesize the information.
    # Since J is an upper semilattice, the category Func(J, Vect_K) is hereditary.
    # Therefore, the projective dimension of any functor f in this category is at most 1.
    # This applies to all functors, including the ones specified as "tame".
    
    # Step 5: Determine the value of n.
    # From proj.dim(f) <= 1, we conclude that f is 1-resolvable.
    # Thus, n must be 1.
    n = 1
    
    # Step 6: Print the final answer and the reasoning.
