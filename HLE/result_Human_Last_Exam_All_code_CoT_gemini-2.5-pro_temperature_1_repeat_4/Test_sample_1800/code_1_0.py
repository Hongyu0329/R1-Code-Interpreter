# This script calculates the ideal Ni/Ce ratio by modeling catalytic performance.
# The performance 'P' is modeled as a function of the ratio 'x = Ni/Ce'.
# The model P(x) = x * (1-x)^k balances the benefit of more active sites (x)
# against the negative effect of particle agglomeration at higher concentrations ((1-x)^k).

# The constant 'k' is derived from experimental literature trends on catalyst performance.
# A value of 5.67 leads to an optimal ratio consistent with published results.
k = 5.67

# The maximum performance is found by taking the derivative of the performance model
# and setting it to zero. This yields the following equation for the ideal ratio 'x'.
