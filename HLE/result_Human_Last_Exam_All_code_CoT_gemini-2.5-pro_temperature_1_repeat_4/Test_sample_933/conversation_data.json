    "To determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4), we need to examine the established chemical reaction conditions.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the primary synthesis method for XeF4. The standard method is the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F2) gases.\n2.  The chemical equation is: `Xe + 2F₂ → XeF₄`.\n3.  This reaction requires an input of energy, typically heat, to overcome the activation energy and proceed at a practical rate.\n4.  I will analyze the provided temperature options based on well-documented reaction conditions.\n    *   Temperatures that are too low will result in a reaction rate that is too slow to be considered \"efficient.\"\n    *   Temperatures that are too high may lead to the formation of other xenon fluorides (like XeF₆) or decomposition of the product.\n5.  The Python script will print out the analysis for each temperature and identify the most suitable option.\n\n```python\ndef find_synthesis_temperature():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the optimal synthesis temperature for Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4)\n    from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) is achieved by the direct reaction of its constituent elements:\")\n    print(\"Xe + 2F2 -> XeF4\")\n    print(\"\\nThis reaction requires heat to overcome the activation energy and proceed efficiently.\")\n    print(\"Let's analyze the given temperature choices:\")\n\n    temperatures = {\n        'A': 600,\n        'B': 400,\n        'C': 200,\n        'D': 78,\n        'E': 0,\n        'F': -78\n    }\n\n    print(f\"\\n- At {temperatures['A']} C: This temperature is generally too high and favors the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6) over XeF4.\")\n    print(f\"- At {temperatures['B']} C: This is the most commonly cited temperature in chemical literature for the efficient, large-scale synthesis of XeF4. It provides an optimal balance between reaction rate and product purity.\")\n    print(f\"- At {temperatures['C']} C: The reaction rate is significantly slower at this temperature, making the synthesis process inefficient for practical purposes.\")\n    print(f\"- At {temperatures['D']} C, {temperatures['E']} C, and {temperatures['F']} C: At these low temperatures, the reactants lack sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the activation barrier, and the reaction rate is negligible.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: Based on established chemical synthesis methods, 400 C is the standard and coldest temperature from the choices at which XeF4 is produced efficiently.\")\n\nfind_synthesis_temperature()\n<<<B>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
