    This function determines the number of homeomorphism classes of compact metric
    spaces with a disconnection number of four.

    The disconnection number D(X) of a space X is the smallest integer D
    such that removing any D points disconnects X. We are looking for the number
    of topologically distinct spaces where D(X) = 4.

    Based on the analysis of various continua (1-dimensional compact connected metric spaces):
    - The arc and the circle have D(X) = 2.
    - More complex graphs (like theta-graphs) or higher-dimensional manifolds have D(X) = infinity.
    - The simple k-od (a star-shaped space with k arms joined at a center) has D(X) = k for k >= 3.

    For D(X) = 4, the space must be a simple 4-od. All simple 4-ods are
    homeomorphic to each other. Therefore, there is only one such homeomorphism class.
