    "This is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The equation has the form `u(x) = f(x) + λ K[u](x)`, where `f(x)=1` and `K` is the integral operator with kernel `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the kernel `K(x, y)`. It can be expanded as a sum:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = Σ_{k=1...n} xⁿ⁻ᵏ yᵏ⁻¹`\nThis shows that the kernel is degenerate (or separable), which means the infinite-dimensional integral equation can be reduced to a finite-dimensional linear algebra problem.\n\nA solution `u(x)` must be of the form `u(x) = 1 + p(x)`, where `p(x)` is a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. Substituting this into the equation leads to a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` coefficients of the polynomial `p(x)`. This system can be written in matrix form as:\n`(I - λA)c = b`\nwhere `c` is a vector related to the coefficients of the solution, `I` is the `n x n` identity matrix, and `A` and `b` are a matrix and a vector determined by the kernel and the function `f(x)`. For this problem, the matrix `A` has entries `Aᵢⱼ = 1 / (n + i - j)` (for `i, j` from 1 to `n`), and the vector `b` has entries `bᵢ = 1/i`.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative, this system has:\n1.  A unique solution for `c` if the matrix `(I - λA)` is invertible, i.e., `det(I - λA) ≠ 0`.\n2.  No solution or infinitely many solutions if `det(I - λA) = 0`.\n\nThe values of `λ` for which `det(I - λA) = 0` are called the characteristic values of the operator. For these values, the equation has no solution if the vector `b` is not in the column space of the matrix `(I - λA)`. It can be shown that this condition holds for all characteristic values of this specific problem.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the values of `λ` that are roots of the polynomial equation `det(I - λA) = 0`. These roots depend on the value of `n`. The following Python code will compute these values for a given `n`. We will demonstrate the solution for `n=3`.\n\nThe code will perform the following steps:\n1.  Set the value of `n`.\n2.  Construct the `n x n` matrix `A`.\n3.  Compute the characteristic polynomial of `A`, which is `q(μ) = det(A - μI)`.\n4.  Transform `q(μ)` into the polynomial `p(λ) = det(I - λA)`. The relationship is `p(λ) = (-λ)ⁿ q(1/λ)`.\n5.  Find the roots of `p(λ) = 0`. These roots are the values of `λ` for which the original equation has no solution.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_for_lambda(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the values of lambda for which the given integral equation has no solution,\n    for a specified integer n >= 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        print(\"For n=1, the equation is 0 * c = 1, which has no solution for lambda = 1.0\")\n        print(\"The equation for lambda is: -1.0 * lambda + 1.0 = 0\")\n        print(\"Values of lambda for which there is no solution:\")\n        print([1.0])\n        return\n\n    # Using 1-based indexing for the matrix definition as in the explanation\n    # but implementing with 0-based numpy arrays.\n    # A_ij = 1 / (n + i - j) where i,j in {1, ..., n}\n    A = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            A[i, j] = 1.0 / (n + (i + 1) - (j + 1))\n\n    # 1.
