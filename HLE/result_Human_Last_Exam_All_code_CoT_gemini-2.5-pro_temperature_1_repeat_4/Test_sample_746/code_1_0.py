# The problem asks for the maximum cardinality of the set of dispersion points
# in a compact connected metric space.
# Based on the topological proof outlined, this maximum number is 1.

# Let M be the maximum cardinality. The final conclusion is the equation M = 1.
# This script will print this equation.

maximum_cardinality = 1

# We are asked to output the final equation.
print("The final equation for the maximum cardinality (M) is:")
