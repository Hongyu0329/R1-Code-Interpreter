print("Let S be the set of continuous functions f: R -> R such that f(f(x)) = exp(x).")
print("We want to find the cardinality of S, denoted as |S|.")
print("-" * 70)

print("Step 1: Analyze the properties of any such function f.")
print("1. f must be injective. If f(x1) = f(x2), then f(f(x1)) = f(f(x2)), so exp(x1) = exp(x2), which means x1 = x2.")
print("2. A continuous and injective function on R must be strictly monotonic (either increasing or decreasing).")
print("3. We can establish a useful identity: f(exp(x)) = exp(f(x)). This is because f(f(f(x))) equals both f(exp(x)) and exp(f(x)).")
print("-" * 70)

print("Step 2: Consider the case where f is strictly decreasing.")
print("A rigorous analysis of the function's limits and range leads to a contradiction.")
print("Let L = lim_{x->inf} f(x) and M = lim_{x->-inf} f(x). For f to be decreasing and continuous on R, we must have M = +infinity and L be a finite value or -infinity.")
print("The range of f(f(x)) must be (0, +infinity). However, analyzing the range based on L and M shows this is impossible.")
print("For instance, by taking the limit of f(exp(x)) = exp(f(x)) as x -> +infinity, we find that L must satisfy L = exp(L), which has no real solution. A more detailed limit analysis shows a contradiction in all subcases.")
print("Therefore, there are no strictly decreasing solutions.")
print("-" * 70)

print("Step 3: Consider the case where f is strictly increasing.")
print("Analysis shows that any such function f must have the following properties for some real number L < 0:")
print("  a) lim_{x->-inf} f(x) = L")
print("  b) lim_{x->inf} f(x) = +infinity")
print("  c) f(L) = 0, f(0) = exp(L), and f(exp(L)) = 1.")
print("These properties are consistent with f being strictly increasing for L < 0.")
print("-" * 70)

print("Step 4: Constructing and counting the solutions.")
print("A solution f can be constructed by making two independent choices:")
print("1. Choose a value for L from the interval (-infinity, 0). The set of possible choices for L has the cardinality of the continuum, c.")
print("2. Choose a continuous, strictly increasing 'seed' function g on the interval [L, 0] such that g(L) = 0 and g(0) = exp(L). The set of such functions g also has the cardinality of the continuum, c.")
print("Any such pair of choices (L, g) uniquely determines a valid solution f over all of R.")
print("The total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices: c * c = c.")
print("-" * 70)

print("Conclusion: The cardinality of the set of solutions is the cardinality of the continuum.")
print("The equation for this cardinality, c, is often written in terms of the cardinal number Aleph-null (the cardinality of integers).")
number_2 = 2
number_0 = 0
print("The final equation for the cardinality is:")
print(f"c = {number_2} ^ aleph_{number_0}")
