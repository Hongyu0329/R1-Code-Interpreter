    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the properties of any function `f` that satisfies the given equation. I'll show that `f` must be injective and therefore strictly monotonic.\n2.  I will then consider the two possible cases for a monotonic function: strictly decreasing and strictly increasing.\n3.  For the strictly decreasing case, I will demonstrate that it leads to a logical contradiction, meaning no such solutions exist.\n4.  For the strictly increasing case, I will show that solutions not only exist but are plentiful. I will outline a method for constructing these solutions. This construction will depend on two independent choices, each from a set with the cardinality of the continuum.\n5.  Finally, by counting the number of possible ways to construct such a function, I will determine the cardinality of the set of solutions. The result will be presented using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# This script explains the reasoning to find the cardinality of the set of continuous functions\n# f: R -> R such that f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n\nprint(\"Let S be the set of continuous functions f: R -> R such that f(f(x)) = exp(x).\")\nprint(\"We want to find the cardinality of S, denoted as |S|.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Analyze the properties of any such function f.\")\nprint(\"1. f must be injective. If f(x1) = f(x2), then f(f(x1)) = f(f(x2)), so exp(x1) = exp(x2), which means x1 = x2.\")\nprint(\"2. A continuous and injective function on R must be strictly monotonic (either increasing or decreasing).\")\nprint(\"3. We can establish a useful identity: f(exp(x)) = exp(f(x)). This is because f(f(f(x))) equals both f(exp(x)) and exp(f(x)).\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n\nprint(\"Step 2: Consider the case where f is strictly decreasing.\")\nprint(\"A rigorous analysis of the function's limits and range leads to a contradiction.\")\nprint(\"Let L = lim_{x->inf} f(x) and M = lim_{x->-inf} f(x). For f to be decreasing and continuous on R, we must have M = +infinity and L be a finite value or -infinity.\")\nprint(\"The range of f(f(x)) must be (0, +infinity). However, analyzing the range based on L and M shows this is impossible.\")\nprint(\"For instance, by taking the limit of f(exp(x)) = exp(f(x)) as x -> +infinity, we find that L must satisfy L = exp(L), which has no real solution. A more detailed limit analysis shows a contradiction in all subcases.\")\nprint(\"Therefore, there are no strictly decreasing solutions.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n\nprint(\"Step 3: Consider the case where f is strictly increasing.\")\nprint(\"Analysis shows that any such function f must have the following properties for some real number L < 0:\")\nprint(\"  a) lim_{x->-inf} f(x) = L\")\nprint(\"  b) lim_{x->inf} f(x) = +infinity\")\nprint(\"  c) f(L) = 0, f(0) = exp(L), and f(exp(L)) = 1.\")\nprint(\"These properties are consistent with f being strictly increasing for L < 0.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n\nprint(\"Step 4: Constructing and counting the solutions.\")\nprint(\"A solution f can be constructed by making two independent choices:\")\nprint(\"1. Choose a value for L from the interval (-infinity, 0). The set of possible choices for L has the cardinality of the continuum, c.\")\nprint(\"2. Choose a continuous, strictly increasing 'seed' function g on the interval [L, 0] such that g(L) = 0 and g(0) = exp(L). The set of such functions g also has the cardinality of the continuum, c.\")\nprint(\"Any such pair of choices (L, g) uniquely determines a valid solution f over all of R.\")\nprint(\"The total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices: c * c = c.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n\nprint(\"Conclusion: The cardinality of the set of solutions is the cardinality of the continuum.\")\nprint(\"The equation for this cardinality, c, is often written in terms of the cardinal number Aleph-null (the cardinality of integers).\")\nnumber_2 = 2\nnumber_0 = 0\nprint(\"The final equation for the cardinality is:\")\nprint(f\"c = {number_2} ^ aleph_{number_0}\")\n```\n<<<2^{\\aleph_0}>>>"
