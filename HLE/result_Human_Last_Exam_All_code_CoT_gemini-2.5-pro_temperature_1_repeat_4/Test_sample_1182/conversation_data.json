    "To find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the prime $p=2$, we can use the method of root clustering. This involves analyzing the 2-adic properties of the roots of the polynomial on the right-hand side.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Determine the Genus (g):** The curve is a hyperelliptic curve of the form $y^2 = f(x)$. The genus `g` is determined by the degree of the polynomial $f(x)$.\n2.  **Find a Good Model:** The initial equation may not be the most convenient for analysis. We can perform a change of variables to find a birationally equivalent curve where the roots of the new polynomial are 2-adically integral (i.e., have non-negative valuation). This makes analyzing the root clusters easier.\n3.  **Count Root Clusters (c):** In the new model, we analyze the roots modulo 2. The roots of the polynomial that reduce to the same value modulo 2 belong to the same cluster. The number of distinct roots modulo 2 gives the number of clusters, `c`.\n4.  **Calculate Double Points (δ):** The number of double points (nodes) in the stable reduction is given by the formula $\\delta = g + c - 1$.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan to calculate the number of double points.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom sympy import Symbol\n\ndef count_double_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve\n    y^2 = 8*x + 1*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5 above the prime 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the curve and find its genus, g.\n    # The curve is C: y^2 = f(x) where f(x) = 8*x^5 + 4*x^4 + 4*x^3 + x^2 + 8*x.\n    # The degree of the polynomial f(x) is n = 5.\n    n = 5\n    # The genus of a hyperelliptic curve y^2 = f(x) is g = floor((n-1)/2).\n    g = math.floor((n - 1) / 2)\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Calculating the genus of the curve.\")\n    print(f\"The curve is defined by a polynomial of degree n = {n}.\")\n    print(f\"The genus is g = floor(({n}-1)/2) = {g}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Step 2: Find a better model for the curve.\n    # The initial model can be transformed to one where the roots are easier to analyze.\n    # A suitable change of variables (x=X/2, y=Y/2) leads to the new model:\n    # Y^2 = f2(X) = X^5 + X^4 + 2*X^3 + X^2 + 16*X\n    X = Symbol('X')\n    f2_poly_str = \"X**5 + X**4 + 2*X**3 + X**2 + 16*X\"\n    print(\"Step 2: Finding a suitable model for analysis.\")\n    print(f\"A better model for the curve is Y^2 = {f2_poly_str}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the number of root clusters, c.\n    # This is the number of distinct roots of the new polynomial when reduced modulo 2.\n    # f2(X) mod 2 = X^5 + X^4 + X^2 = X^2 * (X^3 + X^2 + 1)\n    f2_mod2_poly_str = \"X^2 * (X^3 + X^2 + 1)\"\n    print(\"Step 3: Counting the number of root clusters (c).\")\n    print(f\"Reducing the polynomial modulo 2 gives: {f2_mod2_poly_str}.\")\n    \n    # The distinct roots come from the square-free factors: X and (X^3 + X^2 + 1).\n    # The factor X gives the root 0.\n    num_roots_factor1 = 1\n    # The factor X^3 + X^2 + 1 is irreducible over F_2 and has 3 distinct roots in F_8.\n    num_roots_factor2 = 3\n    \n    # Total number of distinct roots is the sum.\n    c = num_roots_factor1 + num_roots_factor2\n    \n    print(f\"The factor X contributes {num_roots_factor1} distinct root.\")\n    print(f\"The factor X^3 + X^2 + 1 contributes {num_roots_factor2} distinct roots.\")\n    print(f\"The total number of distinct roots modulo 2, which is the number of clusters, is c = {c}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the number of double points, delta.\n    # The formula is delta = g + c - 1.\n    delta = g + c - 1\n    \n    print(\"Step 4: Calculating the number of double points (δ).\")\n    print(\"The number of double points is given by the formula: δ = g + c - 1.\")\n    # We print the final equation with the computed values.\n    print(f\"Plugging in the values, we get: δ = {g} + {c} - 1 = {delta}\")\n    \n    return delta\n\n# Run the calculation.\ncount_double_points()\n```\n<<<5>>>"
