    "To answer this question, we need to identify the crystal classes that satisfy three conditions:\n1.  **Achiral**: The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This means the point group must contain a mirror plane (m) or a rotoinversion axis (e.g., -1, -3, -4, -6). Classes that only have rotation or screw axes are chiral.\n2.  **Non-polar**: The crystal does not have a unique direction, meaning it lacks a spontaneous electric polarization. The polar classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm. Our target classes must not be in this list.\n3.  **Optically Active**: The material can rotate the plane of polarized light. This property is allowed in all 21 non-centrosymmetric point groups (those that lack a center of inversion, -1).\n\nI will write a Python script to perform this filtering process:\n1.  Start with all 32 crystal classes.\n2.  Remove the chiral classes to get the achiral ones.\n3.  From the remaining achiral classes, remove the polar classes.\n4.  From that result, remove the centrosymmetric classes (as they are not optically active).\n5.  The resulting set contains the classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n6.  Finally, I will compare this derived set with the given answer choices to find the correct option and print its contents.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystal_class_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies achiral, non-polar, and optically active crystal classes\n    from a set of options.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define sets of crystal classes based on their properties.\n    all_classes = {\n        '1', '-1', '2', 'm', '2/m', '222', 'mm2', 'mmm', '4', '-4', '4/m',\n        '422', '4mm', '-42m', '4/mmm', '3', '-3', '32', '3m', '-3m', '6',\n        '-6', '6/m', '622', '6mm', '-62m', '6/mmm', '23', 'm-3', '432',\n        '-43m', 'm-3m'\n    }\n\n    # Optically inactive classes (centrosymmetric)\n    centrosymmetric = {\n        '-1', '2/m', 'mmm', '4/m', '4/mmm', '-3', '-3m', '6/m', '6/mmm',\n        'm-3', 'm-3m'\n    }\n\n    # Polar classes\n    polar = {'1', '2', 'm', 'mm2', '3', '3m', '4', '4mm', '6', '6mm'}\n\n    # Chiral classes (lack mirror planes and inversion centers)\n    chiral = {'1', '2', '3', '4', '6', '222', '32', '422', '622', '23', '432'}\n\n    # 1.
