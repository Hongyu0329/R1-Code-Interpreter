    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of nodes in two Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) trees of a given depth, as HSS matrix multiplication involves operations on the corresponding nodes of the two input matrices.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Define the HSS Tree Structure:** An HSS tree is a binary tree that represents the recursive partitioning of a matrix. A tree of depth `D` has `D+1` levels, starting from level 0 (the root) to level `D` (the leaves).\n2.  **Count Nodes per Level:** At any level `l` of the tree, there are `2^l` nodes.\n3.  **Calculate Total Nodes per Tree:** We will sum the number of nodes from level 0 to the specified depth (4) to find the total number of submatrices represented in a single HSS tree.\n4.  **Calculate Total for Multiplication:** Since matrix multiplication `A * B` involves two matrices, the total number of submatrices accessed is twice the number of nodes in a single tree.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** The Python code will implement this logic, showing the calculation step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hss_multiplication():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrices accessed during a matrix multiplication\n    for a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree of a given depth.\n    \"\"\"\n    depth = 4\n\n    # An HSS tree of depth D has D+1 levels, from 0 to D.\n    levels = list(range(depth + 1))\n\n    # The number of nodes (submatrices) at level l is 2^l.\n    nodes_per_level = [2**l for l in levels]\n\n    # The total number of submatrices in one HSS tree is the sum of nodes at all levels.\n    nodes_per_tree = sum(nodes_per_level)\n\n    # Matrix multiplication involves two matrices (A and B).\n    total_submatrices_accessed = nodes_per_tree * 2\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation.\n    print(f\"A Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree of depth {depth} has levels from 0 to {depth}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of submatrices at each level is: {nodes_per_level}\")\n\n    # Create the string for the sum equation for one tree\n    sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, nodes_per_level))\n    print(f\"The total number of submatrices in a single HSS tree is the sum of nodes at all levels:\")\n    print(f\"{sum_str} = {nodes_per_tree}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nMatrix multiplication involves two such trees (one for each matrix).\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the total number of submatrices accessed is:\")\n    print(f\"{nodes_per_tree} (from matrix A) + {nodes_per_tree} (from matrix B) = {total_submatrices_accessed}\")\n\nsolve_hss_multiplication()\n\n```\n<<<62>>>"
