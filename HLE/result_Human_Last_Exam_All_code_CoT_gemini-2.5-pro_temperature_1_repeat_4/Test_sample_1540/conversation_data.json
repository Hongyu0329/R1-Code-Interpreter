    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\nFirst, I will determine the most memory-efficient C implementation to solve the lexicographical string comparison problem. The core of this approach is to minimize the amount of data stored in variables. Since the two strings are provided on separate lines, we must read and store the first string before we can read the second. Therefore, the most memory-efficient method is:\n1.  Allocate a character array to store the first string. Given the maximum length of 100, we need a buffer of 101 bytes (for the 100 characters plus the null terminator).\n2.  Instead of storing the second string, read it one character at a time.\n3.  In a loop, compare the character from the stored first string with the character just read from the second string, ignoring case.\n4.  Based on the comparison, print the result (-1, 1, or 0) and terminate.\n\nThis method requires a minimal set of variables: the buffer for the first string, a loop index, and a single character variable for the second string's characters.\n\nNext, I will write a Python script to calculate the total memory required for these variables in bytes, assuming standard data type sizes used in competitive programming environments (e.g., `char` is 1 byte, `int` is 4 bytes). The script will show the breakdown of the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the memory usage for the most memory-efficient\n    C program to solve the given problem.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In C, the size of a 'char' is guaranteed to be 1 byte.\n    sizeof_char = 1\n\n    # The size of an 'int' is typically 4 bytes on most competitive programming platforms.\n    sizeof_int = 4\n\n    # 1. Memory for the first string:\n    # The maximum length is 100 characters. We need an additional byte for the\n    # null terminator ('\\0') in a C-style string.\n    # Variable declaration in C: char str1[101];\n    string_buffer_size = 101 * sizeof_char\n\n    # 2. Memory for the loop index:\n    # We need an integer to iterate through the first string.\n    # Variable declaration in C: int i;\n    index_variable_size = sizeof_int\n\n    # 3. Memory for the second string's character:\n    # We read the second string one character at a time, so we only need\n    # space for a single character.\n    # Variable declaration in C: char c2;\n    char_variable_size = sizeof_char\n\n    # The total memory is the sum of the memory used by these variables.\n    total_memory = string_buffer_size + index_variable_size + char_variable_size\n\n    print(\"The most memory-efficient C program requires the following variables:\")\n    print(f\"- A character buffer for the first string: {string_buffer_size} bytes\")\n    print(f\"- An integer variable for the loop index: {index_variable_size} bytes\")\n    print(f\"- A character variable for the second string's character: {char_variable_size} bytes\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the total memory 'm' is:\")\n    print(f\"m = {string_buffer_size} (string) + {index_variable_size} (index) + {char_variable_size} (char)\")\n    print(f\"m = {total_memory} bytes\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<106>>>"
