    "This problem asks for the number of \"higher dimensional rooted forests\" that fail to simplicially collapse. The terminology is not standard, but it strongly suggests a connection to advanced concepts in combinatorial topology, possibly related to enumeration formulas for spanning trees in simplicial complexes.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Interpret the question**: The question is likely a creatively phrased way of asking for a specific topological invariant of the Möbius band. A common pattern in this area of mathematics (higher-dimensional graph theory, originated by G. Kalai) is that the number of \"spanning trees\" of a simplicial complex is related to the torsion subgroup of its homology. A failure to collapse often points towards non-trivial topology, which is captured by homology groups. The most plausible interpretation is that the question is asking for the order of the torsion subgroup of the first homology group of the standard triangulation of the Möbius band, i.e., $|\\text{Tor}(H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z}))|$.\n\n2.  **Find the Standard Triangulation**: A standard, minimal, combinatorial triangulation of the Möbius band is a specific simplicial complex. I will use a known 7-vertex, 10-triangle, 17-edge complex often used in computational topology databases, denoted as `mb_7_10`.\n\n3.  **Compute Homology**: I will compute the first homology group $H_1(K) = \\ker(\\partial_1) / \\text{im}(\\partial_2)$ for this complex $K$. The group is a finitely generated abelian group, so it can be decomposed into a free part and a torsion part: $H_1(K) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{\\beta_1} \\oplus T$. The Betti number $\\beta_1$ for the Möbius band is 1. The key is to determine the torsion subgroup $T$.\n\n4.  **Algorithm for Torsion**: I will implement a standard algorithm from computational topology to find the torsion coefficients of $H_1(K)$. This involves constructing the boundary matrices $\\partial_1$ (from edges to vertices) and $\\partial_2$ (from faces to edges) and using the Smith Normal Form (SNF) of these matrices. The algorithm is as follows:\n    a.  Compute the SNF of $\\partial_1$: $D_1 = U_1 \\cdot \\partial_1 \\cdot V_1$.\n    b.  Transform the boundary matrix $\\partial_2$ using the same basis change for the 1-chains: $\\hat{\\partial}_2 = U_1 \\cdot \\partial_2$.\n    c.  The torsion coefficients are the diagonal entries $d_i$ of $D_1$ that are greater than 1 and for which the corresponding row in $\\hat{\\partial}_2$ is entirely zero.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: The number we seek is the product of these torsion coefficients (the order of the torsion group). If there are no such coefficients, the group is trivial, and its order is 1. The final output will present this calculation.\n\nThis approach will verify the known topological properties of the Möbius band ($H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, which has a trivial torsion subgroup) on a concrete combinatorial representation. The result is expected to be 1.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sympy import Matrix\n\ndef compute_homology_torsion():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the torsion subgroup of the first homology group\n    of a standard triangulation of the Möbius band.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Standard combinatorial triangulation of the Mobius band (mb_7_10)\n    # 7 vertices, 17 edges, 10 faces\n    vertices = list(range(1, 8))\n    \n    # Edges are defined as sorted tuples of vertices\n    edges = sorted(list(set(\n        tuple(sorted((f[i], f[j])))\n        for f in [\n            (1,2,4), (1,2,5), (1,3,6), (1,3,7), (1,4,5), (1,6,7), \n            (2,3,4), (2,3,7), (2,5,6), (2,6,7)\n        ]\n        for i in range(3) for j in range(i + 1, 3)\n    )))\n    \n    # Faces are defined as sorted tuples of vertices\n    faces = [\n        (1,2,4), (1,2,5), (1,3,6), (1,3,7), (1,4,5), (1,6,7), \n        (2,3,4), (2,3,7), (2,5,6), (2,6,7)\n    ]\n\n    num_vertices = len(vertices)\n    num_edges = len(edges)\n    num_faces = len(faces)\n\n    vert_map = {v: i for i, v in enumerate(vertices)}\n    edge_map = {e: i for i, e in enumerate(edges)}\n\n    # Build boundary matrix d1: C1 -> C0 (edges to vertices)\n    d1 = np.zeros((num_vertices, num_edges), dtype=int)\n    for j, edge in enumerate(edges):\n        v1, v2 = edge\n        d1[vert_map[v2], j] = 1\n        d1[vert_map[v1], j] = -1\n\n    # Build boundary matrix d2: C2 -> C1 (faces to edges)\n    d2 = np.zeros((num_edges, num_faces), dtype=int)\n    for j, face in enumerate(faces):\n        v1, v2, v3 = sorted(face)\n        # Orient face boundary as (v1,v2) + (v2,v3) - (v1,v3)\n        d2[edge_map[tuple(sorted((v1, v2)))], j] = 1 if v1 < v2 else -1\n        d2[edge_map[tuple(sorted((v2, v3)))], j] = 1 if v2 < v3 else -1\n        d2[edge_map[tuple(sorted((v1, v3)))], j] = -1 if v1 < v3 else 1\n    \n    # Use sympy for Smith Normal Form calculation\n    d1_matrix = Matrix(d1)\n    d2_matrix = Matrix(d2)\n\n    # Algorithm to find torsion of H1\n    # 1.
