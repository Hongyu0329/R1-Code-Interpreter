    explanation = """
The incorrect statement is B. Here is the reasoning:

A. This is a common interpretation. Augustine's later writings on grace and predestination are seen by many as a precursor to Calvinist thought. This is correct.

B. This statement misrepresents the work of the historian R. A. Markus. While Markus did argue that Augustine's view of freedom was 'asymmetrical' (i.e., the will is free to sin, but not free to choose the good without grace), he did not do so while 'ignoring his thoughts on predestination and grace.' On the contrary, Markus's entire analysis is built upon the interaction between these concepts. A serious scholar like Markus would not ignore such central tenets of Augustine's theology. This statement is incorrect.

C. Augustine's concept of 'voluntas' (will) as a faculty of the human psyche is central to his thought, and he was indeed influenced by classical philosophers like Seneca. This is correct.

D. The inseparability of philosophy and theology is a hallmark of Augustine's intellectual project ("faith seeking understanding"). Discussing free will without grace would be impossible in his framework. This is correct.

E. This accurately describes a well-known scholarly interpretation by Ã‰tienne Gilson, who distinguished Augustine's idea of 'efficacious' or 'victorious' grace from the more deterministic 'irresistible' grace of the Jansenists. This is correct.

F. This accurately summarizes a key argument from Augustine's dialogue 'On Free Will' with Evodius, establishing human responsibility for sin through the act of willing. This is correct.
