    # Step 1: Define the 12 initial notes.

    # Step 3: Derive the constant term of the formula.
    # This is the sum of sharps for n=0, based on the underlying formula *before*
    # any conversion of flat keys to sharp keys is applied.
    # The formula for a key 'Base + s sharps' is `base_key_sharps[Base] + 7*s`.

        constant_term += base_key_sharps[base_note] + 7 * s

    # Step 4: Derive the multiplier for 'n'.
    # When we sharp all 12 notes 'n' times, 'n' is added to the 's' value of each note.
    # For each note, the number of sharps in its key signature increases by 7*n.
    # Since there are 12 notes, the total sum increases by 12 * 7 * n.
    n_multiplier = 12 * 7

    # Step 5: Explain the derivation and print the final formula.
    # The prompt requires that the final formula be derived for n > 0.
    # For any n > 0, the calculated number of sharps for any key is never negative.
    # The lowest possible value is for the F note (F+n#): -1 + 7*n. For n>=1, this is >=6.
    # Therefore, the flat-to-sharp conversion rule does not apply for n > 0.
    # The formula is a simple linear equation.
