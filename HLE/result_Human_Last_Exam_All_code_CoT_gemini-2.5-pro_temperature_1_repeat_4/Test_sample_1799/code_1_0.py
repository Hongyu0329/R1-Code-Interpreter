    Explains why the second postulate of special relativity is not

    print("The statement that the 2nd postulate is superfluous and can be deduced from the 1st is generally considered to be NO.")
    print("Here is a step-by-step explanation:\n")

    print("Step 1: The First Postulate (Principle of Relativity)")
    print("This states that 'The laws of physics take the same form in all inertial frames of reference.'")
    print("This principle is powerful, but on its own, it does not uniquely define how coordinates (like space and time) transform between different frames. It allows for more than one possibility.\n")

    print("Step 2: Two Possible Transformation Frameworks")
    print("The first postulate allows for at least two self-consistent frameworks. The choice between them depends on an assumption about the nature of space and time, specifically about a universal speed limit.\n")

    print("--- Possibility A: Galilean Relativity ---")
    print("This framework assumes there is NO universal speed limit (i.e., signals can travel infinitely fast) and that time is absolute for all observers.")
    print("The transformation equations from a stationary frame (x, t) to a frame moving at velocity v (x', t') are:")
    print("\nx' = x - v * t")
    print("t' = t\n")
    print("This matches our everyday intuition but is inconsistent with the observed behavior of light as described by Maxwell's equations.\n")

    print("--- Possibility B: Special Relativity (Lorentz Transformations) ---")
    print("This framework assumes there IS a finite, universal speed 'c' that is the same for all observers.")
    print("The transformation equations are:")
    print("\n  γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))")
    print("x' = γ * (x - v * t)")
    print("t' = γ * (t - (v * x / c^2))\n")
    print("This framework is consistent with the behavior of light.\n")

    print("Step 3: The Role of the Second Postulate")
    print("The First Postulate alone cannot decide between Possibility A and Possibility B. It is the Second Postulate ('The speed of light in empty space has the same value c in all inertial frames') that provides the crucial, independent physical axiom.")
    print("This postulate, based on experimental evidence, forces us to discard Galilean Relativity and accept the Lorentz transformations as the correct description of spacetime.")
    print("\nConclusion: The 2nd postulate is not deduced from the 1st; it is the key that selects the correct physical theory from the options permitted by the 1st.")
