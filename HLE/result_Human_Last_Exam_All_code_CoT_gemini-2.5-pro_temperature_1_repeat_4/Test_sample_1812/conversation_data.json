    "My plan is to compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix. The context about the \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" is additional information; the main task is the matrix calculation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the code:\n1.  Define the matrix `A` using Python's list of lists or a NumPy array.\n2.  Recall the formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\n    `det([[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`\n3.  Assign the values from the given matrix `A` to the variables `a` through `i`.\n4.  Calculate the determinant using these values.\n5.  Construct and print a formatted string that displays the entire calculation, showing how each number from the matrix fits into the formula, and what the final result is, as requested.\n\nThis approach will provide a clear, step-by-step calculation within the code's output.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_determinant_and_show_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix and prints the full calculation equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The adjacency matrix is given as:\n    # A = [[ 2, -1, -1],\n    #      [-1,  2, -1],\n    #      [-1, -1,  2]]\n    A = np.array([\n        [2, -1, -1],\n        [-1, 2, -1],\n        [-1, -1, 2]\n    ])\n\n    # Extract elements for the formula: det([[a,b,c],[d,e,f],[g,h,i]]) = a(ei-fh) - b(di-fg) + c(dh-eg)\n    a, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\n    d, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\n    g, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n    # Calculate the determinant value\n    determinant = a * (e * i - f * h) - b * (d * i - f * g) + c * (d * h - e * g)\n\n    # Construct the equation string to show the step-by-step calculation with original numbers\n    # Note: We use parentheses to make the substitution of negative numbers clear.\n    equation_str = (\n        f\"det(A) = {a} * ({e} * {i} - ({f}) * ({h})) \"\n        f\"- ({b}) * (({d}) * {i} - ({f}) * ({g})) \"\n        f\"+ ({c}) * (({d}) * ({h}) - {e} * ({g}))\"\n    )\n\n    # Print the full equation with the final result\n    print(f\"The equation for the determinant is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {int(determinant)}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncompute_determinant_and_show_equation()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
