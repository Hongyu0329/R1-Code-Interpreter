    "To solve this problem, I will calculate the Hopf charge by determining the linking number of the preimages of two distinct points in the vector field. This is a standard method for this type of problem, as the Hopf charge is a topological integer invariant that quantifies how these preimages are linked in 3D space.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, I will identify the preimages in the `(x,y,z)` space for two convenient points on the target sphere `S^2`. I'll choose the \"South Pole\" `n=(0,0,-1)` and an equatorial point `n=(1,0,0)`.\n2.  The preimage of the South Pole turns out to be a circle (`C_S`) in the `xy`-plane.\n3.  The preimage of the equatorial point is a closed loop (`C_E`) in the `xz`-plane.\n4.  Next, I will use the Gauss linking integral to calculate the linking number between these two curves, `C_S` and `C_E`.\n5.  Since the integral is complex to solve analytically, I will provide a Python script that computes it numerically using the `scipy` library.\n6.  The result of this calculation, which should be an integer, is the Hopf charge of the field.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import dblquad\n\ndef calculate_hopf_charge():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hopf charge of the given vector field by computing\n    the linking number of the preimages of two points.\n    \n    The vector field n(x,y,z) is a map from R^3 to S^2.\n    The Hopf charge H is the linking number Lk(n^{-1}(p1), n^{-1}(p2))\n    for two regular values p1, p2 on S^2.\n\n    1. Preimage of the South Pole n=(0,0,-1):\n       cos(G) = -1 => G = PI => exp(-10*r2) = 1 => r2 = 0.\n       This gives z=0 and x^2+y^2 = 0.5.\n       This is a circle C_S with radius R_c = sqrt(0.5) in the xy-plane.\n\n    2. Preimage of the equatorial point n=(1,0,0):\n       G = PI/2 and f = 0.\n       G = PI/2 => exp(-10*r2) = 0.5 => r2 = ln(2)/10.\n       f = 0 => y=0, x>0.\n       This gives (x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2.\n       This is a closed loop C_E in the xz-plane.\n\n    3. The linking number is computed using the Gauss linking integral:\n       Lk = (1 / (4*pi)) * integral_CS integral_CE [ (r1 - r2) .
