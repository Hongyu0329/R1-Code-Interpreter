    This function demonstrates that the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings
    of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B is 0.

    It does this by showing a specific example where no such embedding exists.

    Let X be a 3-point space {x1, x2, x3} with ultrametric d(xi, xj) = 1 for i != j.
    Let B be the Banach space of real numbers R with the usual norm |.|.

    An isometric embedding f: X -> R must satisfy |f(xi) - f(xj)| = 1 for i != j.
    Let y1 = f(x1), y2 = f(x2), y3 = f(x3).

    We can fix one point's image due to translational invariance. Let y1 = 0.
