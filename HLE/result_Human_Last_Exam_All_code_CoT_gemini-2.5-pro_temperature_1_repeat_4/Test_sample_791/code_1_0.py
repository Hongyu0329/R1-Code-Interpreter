    print("   - Longest sentence: The rule 'REC = REC ADJ' allows for an infinite sequence of adjectives. Thus, the language is infinite and has no longest sentence.")
    print("   - Parser behavior: While the statement about the language is true, an RD/PR parser would fail. To parse 'red' as an 'ADJ', the parser might have to consider the 'REC' alternative for 'ADJ', which triggers the infinite loop. So, the parser would not successfully accept this sentence. The statement is misleading in the context of the parsers.")

    print("   - This is the most accurate statement. The term 'cannot be implemented' means 'cannot be implemented to function correctly for this grammar'.")
    print("   - The presence of the 'REC = REC ADJ' rule makes any standard RD or PR implementation non-terminating when it tries to parse that rule.")
