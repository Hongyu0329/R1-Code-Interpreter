# The problem asks for the critical exponent nu (ν) in what is described
# as a "G₄-theoretical framework". This is interpreted as a system at its
# upper critical dimension, d=4.
#
# In this regime, the critical exponent ν takes its mean-field theory value.
# The mean-field value for ν is derived from theory and is equal to 1/2.
#
# This script calculates and displays this value.

# Define the numerator and denominator for the value of nu
numerator = 1
denominator = 2

# Calculate the precise value of the critical exponent nu
nu_value = numerator / denominator

# As requested, we print the final equation showing each number.
