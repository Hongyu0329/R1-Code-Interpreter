    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the most likely mechanism for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes:\n\n1.  **Define the Core Problem:** The question asks for a mechanism that explains two outcomes for a duplicated gene pair: (1) **Retention**, meaning both copies are kept in the genome over evolutionary time, and (2) **Divergence**, meaning the two copies evolve to become different from each other.\n2.  **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:** I will systematically analyze each option against these two requirements.\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This process makes homologous sequences more similar or identical. It actively works *against* divergence.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is when one copy becomes non-functional. This fails the \"retention\" criterion, as only one functional copy is retained.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one copy keeps the original function while the other evolves a brand-new function. This explains both retention (as both are useful) and divergence (as they have different functions and sequences). This is a strong candidate.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** In this model, the ancestral gene had multiple functions (or expression patterns), and the duplicate copies specialize, each taking on a subset of the original roles. This also explains retention (both are now required to fulfill the complete original role) and divergence (especially in regulatory regions). This is also a strong candidate.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern of species diversification, not a molecular mechanism for retaining a specific gene pair within a genome.\n3.  **Compare Strong Candidates (C and D):** Both Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization are the two major, accepted models. The question asks for the \"most likely\" mechanism. Subfunctionalization is often considered a more probable *initial* path to retention because it can happen through common, neutral mutations that degrade complementary parts of each gene's function. This provides a stable state where both genes are required, preventing one from being lost. Neofunctionalization, by contrast, requires a rare beneficial mutation to occur before the redundant gene copy is lost to pseudogenization. Therefore, subfunctionalization can be seen as a more common and passive route to preserving duplicate genes, making it arguably \"most likely\".\n\n```python\ndef analyze_gene_duplication_fates():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes different mechanisms for the fate of duplicated genes\n    to find the one most likely responsible for retention and divergence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The criteria for the correct mechanism, based on the question\n    required_outcomes = [\"retention\", \"divergence\"]\n\n    # Dictionary of the mechanisms and their descriptions\n    mechanisms = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Gene conversion',\n            'description': 'A process that homogenizes gene copies, making them identical.
