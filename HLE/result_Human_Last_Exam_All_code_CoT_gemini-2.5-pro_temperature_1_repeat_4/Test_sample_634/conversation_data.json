    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the matrix Euclidean algorithm. This method involves stacking the two matrices and then applying elementary row operations to reduce the stacked matrix to a form where the GCRD appears as the non-zero block.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Construct a stacked matrix M by placing P1 on top of P2.\n    M = [P1; P2]\n2.  Apply elementary row operations to M. These operations include swapping rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero constant, and adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another. The goal is to transform M into a row-echelon-like form where the bottom rows become zero.\n3.  The remaining non-zero rows at the top will form a GCRD of the original matrices.\n4.  The resulting GCRD can be simplified by left-multiplying with a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant) to get a cleaner, canonical form.\n\nThe following Python code implements this procedure to find the GCRD.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef poly_to_str(p):\n    \"\"\"\n    Custom function to convert a numpy.poly1d object to a clean string representation\n    for display.
