--- Part 1: Hotspots for Interaction with Alpha-1 Subunit ---
The following residues in the human beta-1 subunit are critical for binding to the alpha-1 subunit:

Residue: W391 (Tryptophan at position 391. Forms a key part of the hydrophobic binding pocket for the AID.)
Residue: Y423 (Tyrosine at position 423. Contributes to the hydrophobic pocket and makes critical contacts.)
Residue: L428 (Leucine at position 428. Lines the binding groove and stabilizes the interaction.)
Residue: M431 (Methionine at position 431. Another key hydrophobic residue in the binding pocket.)
Residue: V477 (Valine at position 477. Contributes to the overall shape and hydrophobicity of the binding site.)
Residue: I479 (Isoleucine at position 479. Essential for the structural integrity of the AID-binding pocket.)


--- Part 2: Hotspots for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties of Alpha-1 Subunit ---
The following residues and regions in the human beta-1 subunit are critical for modulating the channel's gating properties:

Region: N-terminus (Region 1-66) (This entire region influences voltage-dependent activation and inactivation kinetics.)
Residue: T169 (Threonine at position 169. A known phosphorylation site for Protein Kinase A (PKA), which modulates channel activity.)
Region: HOOK Domain (Region ~219-357) (This variable linker region between the SH3 and GK domains is a major determinant of the specific gating effects of the beta-1 subunit.)
Residue: S559 (Serine at position 559. A potential phosphorylation site in the C-terminus that can fine-tune channel function.)
