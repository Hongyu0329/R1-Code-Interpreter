# Part A: The allusion is to "The Adventure of the Priory School".
# In the story, the misleading tracks were made by a horse wearing
# special horseshoes to imitate cow tracks. This corresponds to option 7.
answer_A = 7

# Part B: The theme underscored is the impossibility of reliable inference.
# The novel's commentator, Kinbote, is a master of unreliable inference,
# and the allusion to Sherlock Holmes (the master of reliable inference)
# creates a deep irony that highlights this central theme. This is option 6.
answer_B = 6

# Part C: Nabokov's prior novel, "The Real Life of Sebastian Knight", is
# fundamentally about the narrator's attempt to piece together an author's life
# through intricate back-referencing of his works and other sources, making it
# a direct precursor to Pale Fire's structure. This is option 3.
answer_C = 3

# The sum of the answers is 7 + 6 + 3 = 16, which satisfies the condition
# that the sum must be a multiple of 8.
# The final answer is printed as three numbers separated by spaces.
