    Explains the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.
    """
    explanation = """The primary difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hip.

In the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and stable pelvis. The dancer must keep their hips aligned over their supporting leg(s) and initiate the backbend from the upper spine, lifting the chest up and back. This creates a pure classical line and builds immense core strength.

In the Balanchine method, which prioritizes dynamic lines and speed, the dancer is often encouraged to push the hip of the supporting leg forward. This allows for a visually deeper and more sweeping backbend, creating the characteristic off-balance, neoclassical aesthetic that George Balanchine favored.

While other elements like arm placement, speed, and head position also differ between the styles, the foundational difference in the execution of this specific step is the hip placement."""
