    "My plan is to analyze the technical differences between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods of ballet, specifically focusing on the execution of a *cambré derrière* (a bend backwards). I will evaluate each multiple-choice option based on well-established principles of these two distinct ballet training systems.\n\n1.  **Vaganova Method:** This method, developed in Russia, emphasizes precise, strong, and clean classical lines. For a *cambré derrière*, the core principle is to maintain a stable and square pelvis. The hips must not push forward. The bend initiates from the upper back, with the dancer lifting their chest towards the ceiling and then arching back. This maintains a pure, unbroken line from the hips through the torso.\n2.  **Balanchine Method:** Developed for the New York City Ballet, this style prioritizes speed, musicality, and dynamic, neoclassical lines. In a Balanchine *cambré derrière*, the dancer often pushes the hip of the supporting leg forward. This action allows for a deeper, quicker, and more dramatic backbend. It creates a different aesthetic line and is a key stylistic choice that distinguishes the Balanchine look.\n3.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A, C, D, E: While there are differences in arm placement, speed, and head placement between the methods, these are often general stylistic traits. The degree of the backbend is a result of the technique used and the dancer's individual flexibility.\n    *   B: The placement of the hip is a fundamental, biomechanical difference in how the entire movement is structured and supported. The Vaganova method insists on square hips, while the Balanchine method allows the hip to move to create its signature aesthetic. This is the most defining difference.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most accurate answer is B. I will now generate a Python script to print this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_ballet_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = \"\"\"The primary difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hip.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and stable pelvis. The dancer must keep their hips aligned over their supporting leg(s) and initiate the backbend from the upper spine, lifting the chest up and back. This creates a pure classical line and builds immense core strength.\n\nIn the Balanchine method, which prioritizes dynamic lines and speed, the dancer is often encouraged to push the hip of the supporting leg forward. This allows for a visually deeper and more sweeping backbend, creating the characteristic off-balance, neoclassical aesthetic that George Balanchine favored.\n\nWhile other elements like arm placement, speed, and head position also differ between the styles, the foundational difference in the execution of this specific step is the hip placement.\"\"\"\n\n    final_answer = \"B.
