    This script determines the total number of smooth coverings mentioned in the problem.

    The problem asks for the total number of smooth coverings of D(PSL(2, p), b, w),
    which are exemplified by the covering from D(SL(2, p), b, w). This is interpreted as
    finding the number of non-isomorphic quasi-simple covering groups for the simple
    group S = PSL(2, p), where p > 5 is a prime.

    A key result in group theory states that the number of such covering groups is equal
    to the number of subgroups of the Schur multiplier of S, M(S).
