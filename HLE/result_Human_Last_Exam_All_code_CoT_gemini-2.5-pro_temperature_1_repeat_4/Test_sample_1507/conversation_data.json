    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the geometry involved.\n\n1.  **The Great Icosahedron:** This is a non-convex polyhedron. It has 20 intersecting triangular faces.\n2.  **The \"Outer-Hull\":** The outer-hull of a non-convex shape is its convex hull. For the great icosahedron, its convex hull is a **regular icosahedron**.\n3.  **Triangulating the Outer-Hull:** The task is to find the number of triangles on the surface of this outer-hull (the regular icosahedron). A regular icosahedron's surface is already made up entirely of triangles. Therefore, the number of triangles needed for the triangulation is simply the number of faces of a regular icosahedron.\n4.  **Calculating the Number of Faces:** We can find the number of faces of a regular icosahedron using Euler's formula for polyhedra: `V - E + F = 2`, where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n    *   A regular icosahedron has **12 vertices (V)**.\n    *   It has **30 edges (E)**.\n    *   We can solve for F: `F = 2 - V + E`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the number of faces (F) based on this formula.\n\n```python\n# A regular icosahedron is the convex hull of a great icosahedron.\n# We need to find the number of triangular faces on this icosahedron.\n\n# Properties of a regular icosahedron\nvertices = 12\nedges = 30\n\n# Euler's formula for convex polyhedra is: V - E + F = 2\n# We can rearrange it to solve for the number of faces (F): F = 2 - V + E\nfaces = 2 - vertices + edges\n\nprint(f\"The convex hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\nprint(f\"A regular icosahedron has {vertices} vertices (V) and {edges} edges (E).\")\nprint(\"We use Euler's formula (V - E + F = 2) to find the number of faces (F).\")\nprint(\"The formula to find F is: F = 2 - V + E\")\nprint(f\"So, the number of faces is 2 - {vertices} + {edges} = {faces}\")\nprint(f\"\\nSince each face of an icosahedron is a triangle, the minimal number of triangles needed is {faces}.\")\n```\n<<<20>>>"
