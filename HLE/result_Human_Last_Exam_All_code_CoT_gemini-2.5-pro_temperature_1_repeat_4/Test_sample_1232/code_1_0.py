    This function checks the submodularity condition required for the Potts
    model's Gibbs measure to satisfy the positive correlations property (FKG inequality)
    with respect to the standard coordinatewise partial order.

    The condition is checked for different numbers of states, q.
    It is: I(max(a,c)==max(b,d)) + I(min(a,c)==min(b,d)) >= I(a==b) + I(c==d)
    for all spin values a, b, c, d in {1, ..., q}.
