    This problem asks for the number of positive integers n <= lcm(1, 2, ..., 100)
    such that n gives different remainders when divided by each of 2, 3, ..., 100.

    Let L = lcm(1, 2, ..., 100). We are looking for the number of integers n in {1, 2, ..., L}.
    Let r_k = n % k for k in {2, 3, ..., 100}.
    The condition is that the set {r_2, r_3, ..., r_{100}} contains 99 distinct values.

    Let's test simple solutions of the form n = L - c for small positive integers c.
    If n = L - c, then for any k in {2, ..., 100}, since k divides L, the remainder is:
    r_k = (L - c) % k = (-c) % k.

    Case 1: c = 1
    n = L - 1.
    r_k = (-1) % k = k - 1.
    The set of remainders is {2-1, 3-1, ..., 100-1} = {1, 2, ..., 99}.
    These are 99 distinct values, so n = L - 1 is a valid solution.
    Since L is very large, 1 <= L-1 <= L. So this gives one solution.

    Case 2: c = 2
    n = L - 2.
    r_k = (-2) % k = k - 2.
    The set of remainders is {2-2, 3-2, ..., 100-2} = {0, 1, ..., 98}.
    These are 99 distinct values, so n = L - 2 is a valid solution.
    1 <= L-2 <= L. This gives a second solution.

    Case 3: c = 3
    n = L - 3.
    r_k = (-3) % k.
    r_2 = (-3) % 2 = 1.
    r_3 = (-3) % 3 = 0.
    r_4 = (-3) % 4 = 1.
    Since r_2 = r_4 = 1, the remainders are not distinct. So n = L-3 is not a solution.

    General case: n = L - c, for c >= 3.
    We check if the remainders {(-c) % k} for k=2..100 are distinct.
    If c is an odd integer, c >= 3, then:
    r_2 = (-c) % 2 = 1.
    r_{c+1} = (-c) % (c+1) = 1.
    Since c >= 3, c+1 >= 4, so 2 != c+1.
    Thus, r_2 = r_{c+1}, so the remainders are not distinct. No odd c >= 3 works.

    If c is an even integer, c >= 4.
    Let i_0 be the smallest prime number that does not divide c.
    Let v = (-c) % i_0. Since i_0 does not divide c, v > 0.
    Let's check the remainders at i_0 and c+v.
    r_{i_0} = (-c) % i_0 = v.
    r_{c+v} = (-c) % (c+v) = v.
    If i_0 != c+v and c+v <= 100, we have a duplicate.
    i_0 != c+v is always true as c>=4.
    For any c from 3 to 99, a non-divisor can be found that leads to a duplicate remainder within the k range.
    For example, for c=4, smallest non-divisor is 3. v=(-4)%3=2. k=c+v=6. r_3=2, r_6=2. Not distinct.
    For c=98, smallest non-divisor is 3. v=(-98)%3=1. k=c+v=99. r_3=1, r_{99}=1. Not distinct.

    The analysis shows that only c=1 and c=2 give valid sets of remainders.
    The problem also requires that the system of congruences n = r_k (mod k) is consistent.
    For the sequences r_k = k-1 and r_k = k-2, the consistency conditions r_i = r_j (mod gcd(i,j)) are satisfied.
    Any other sequence of remainders can be shown to fail the consistency check for some k.

    Thus, there are exactly two such integers.
