    "For a multi-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, it is crucial to prepare a comprehensive set of controls to ensure accurate data acquisition and analysis. This involves setting the correct voltages, calculating spectral compensation, and defining precise gates for sorting.\n\nHere is the plan to determine the number of essential controls:\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is the absolute baseline. It consists of only the streptavidin beads to measure their natural autofluorescence in each channel. You always need one unstained control.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** To correct for spectral overlap (where the signal from one fluorochrome \"spills over\" into another's detector), you need to run a sample stained with only one fluorochrome for each color in your panel. Since you have five channels with five different fluorochromes, you will need five single-stain controls.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** These controls are critical for setting accurate gates, especially in a sorting experiment where the purity of the sorted population is paramount. An FMO control contains all the stains in your panel *except for one*. This helps you see the spread of all other colors into the channel of the missing one, allowing you to draw a confident gate. You should prepare an FMO control for each fluorochrome in your panel, so you will need five FMO controls.\n\nThe total number of essential controls is the sum of these three types.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the essential controls for a multi-color flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the detection channels/fluorochromes used in the experiment\n    fluorochromes = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n    num_fluorochromes = len(fluorochromes)\n\n    # 1.
