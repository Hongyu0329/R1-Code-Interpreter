# Based on the derivation, the constant b in the asymptotic formula C(n) ~ b * n^(3/2)
# is given by the exact expression sqrt(pi / 2).
# This script calculates the numerical value of b.

# Define the numbers in the final equation for b
pi_value = math.pi
denominator = 2

# Calculate b using the formula
b_value = math.sqrt(pi_value / denominator)

# As requested, we print the components of the equation and the final result.
