# The problem asks for the number of points on a given planar set whose removal
# does not decrease the number of components in the complement.
# Based on topological analysis, the complement of the set has 3 components.
# Removing a point decreases the number of components if and only if it lies on a
# boundary shared by two or more components.
# We need to count the points that lie on the boundary of exactly one component.
# These points are the endpoints of the line segments that are not part of any cycle.

# Count of such points on the boundary of the inner region (R_in):
# These are the segment tips inside the unit circle.
# 1. (0, 1/2) from segment {0} x [1/2, 3/2]
# 2. (1/2, 0) from segment [1/2, 3/2] x {0}
# 3. (-1/2, 0) from segment [-3/2, -1/2] x {0}
# 4. (0, -1/2) from segment {0} x [-3/2, -1/2]
num_points_in = 4

# Count of such points on the boundary of the outer region (R_out):
# These are the segment tips outside the main cycles.
# 1. (0, 3/2) from segment {0} x [1/2, 3/2]
# 2. (-3/2, 0) from segment [-3/2, -1/2] x {0}
# 3. (-1/2, 1) from segment [-1/2, 1/2] x {1}
# 4. (1/2, 1) from segment [-1/2, 1/2] x {1}
num_points_out = 4

# The total number of points is the sum of these counts.
total_points = num_points_in + num_points_out
