    The response of Microcystis aeruginosa CAAT 2005-3 to high temperature exposure (29ÂºC) was evaluated.
    Oxidative stress markers and antioxidant systems were monitored over 48 hours.
    The earliest and most significant response, observed within the first 6 hours, was a sharp increase
    in the activity of enzymatic antioxidants, namely superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT).
    This indicates a rapid mobilization to neutralize reactive oxygen species.
    In contrast, significant changes in liposoluble antioxidants (tocopherols) and hydrosoluble antioxidants
    were only detected after 24 hours of continuous exposure. Levels of photosynthetic pigments
    decreased, while UV-protective compounds did not show a significant response to the thermal stress.
