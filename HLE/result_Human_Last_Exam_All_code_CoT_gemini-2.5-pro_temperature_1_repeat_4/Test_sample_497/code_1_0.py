    # Step 1: Establish the equation for the characteristic capacitance C_eq.
    # The condition that the capacitance is independent of the number of cells means
    # that adding a cell to a ladder with capacitance C_eq results in the same C_eq.
    # The new load is the shunt 'c' in parallel with C_eq, so C_load = c + C_eq.
    # The recurrence relation is C_eq = (c * C_load) / (2 * C_load + c).
