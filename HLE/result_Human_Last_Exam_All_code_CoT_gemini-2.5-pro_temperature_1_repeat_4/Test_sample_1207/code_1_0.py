The patient presents with a classic triad of symptoms:
1. Transient monocular vision loss (suggesting branch retinal artery occlusions).
2. Pulsatile headaches (a sign of encephalopathy).
3. Hearing loss.

This clinical triad is highly characteristic of Susac's Syndrome, a rare autoimmune microangiopathy.
The pathognomonic (uniquely identifying) finding for Susac's Syndrome on a brain MRI is the presence of central corpus callosum hyperintense lesions, often described as 'snowballs', and potential leptomeningeal enhancement.
Therefore, the most expected imaging modality and finding is described in choice B.
