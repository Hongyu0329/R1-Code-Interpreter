    # The position is a well-known stalemate puzzle.
    # White's goal is to force a draw because Black's d-pawn is too dangerous.
    # The key move for White creates a stalemate trap.
    #
    # 1. White's move: Qe3
    #    - This move attacks the black queen on c5.
    #
    # 2. Black's possible responses:
    #    a) Black captures the queen: ...Qxe3
    #       - This results in a stalemate. The black king on b6 has no legal moves.
    #         The squares a6 and b5 are attacked by the white a4-pawn.
    #         The squares c7 and a7 are blocked by black's own pawns.
    #         The black pawns themselves cannot move.
    #       - Therefore, ...Qxe3 leads to a draw.
    #
    #    b) Black moves the queen away to avoid the trade, e.g., ...Qd5
    #       - White can respond with Qd3. This again offers a queen trade that
    #         would lead to the exact same stalemate.
    #       - If Black keeps avoiding the trade, White can force a draw by
    #         repetition of moves (e.g., 1. Qe3 Qc5 2. Qd3 Qd5 3. Qe3).
    #
    # Conclusion: The move Qe3 guarantees a draw for White, which is the best
    # possible outcome in this position.
