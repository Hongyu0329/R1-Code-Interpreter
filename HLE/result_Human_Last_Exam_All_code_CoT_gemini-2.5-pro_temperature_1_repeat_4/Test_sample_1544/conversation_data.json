    "This is a classic chess puzzle that demonstrates the power of the stalemate defense. Let's break down the position and find the best move for White.\n\n**Position Analysis:**\n\n*   **White:** Has a King, a Queen, and two pawns. The d6-pawn is a strength, controlling key squares, but it cannot advance.\n*   **Black:** Has a King, a Queen, and three pawns. The passed pawn on d7 is a major threat, as it is only one square away from promoting to a new Queen.\n\n**White's Goal:**\n\nWhite cannot win this position. The primary objective is to avoid losing, which means forcing a draw. A careless move by White would allow Black to promote the d7-pawn and win easily.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking to find the optimal move:**\n\n1.  **Identify the threat:** The most significant threat is Black's d7-pawn. If Black can move their Queen away safely, the next move will be `...d6`, leading to promotion. White must prevent this.\n2.  **Evaluate forcing moves:** White should look for checks, captures, or direct threats. Trading queens with `Qxc5+` seems tempting, but after `...bxc5`, Black's king and passed pawns would quickly overwhelm White's lone king. This leads to a loss for White.\n3.  **Look for defensive resources:** White's king is somewhat exposed, but the key to the position is the placement of Black's king. The Black king is trapped in a small area by its own pawns and White's pawns. This suggests a stalemate possibility.\n4.  **The Solution - Creating a Stalemate Trap:** The best move for White is `Qe3`. Let's see why:\n    *   This move attacks the Black queen on c5.\n    *   If Black accepts the trade by playing `...Qxe3`, the game is an immediate draw by stalemate. The Black king on b6 has no legal squares to move to (a6 and b5 are controlled by the a4-pawn; c7 and a7 are blocked by Black's own pawns). Since Black has no legal moves, the game is a draw.\n    *   If Black refuses the trade and moves the queen (e.g., to `d5`), White can simply follow it with `Qd3`, once again offering a trade that would lead to the same stalemate. Black cannot escape this perpetual offer without allowing a different kind of draw by repetition.\n\nTherefore, `Qe3` is the optimal move as it forces a draw against any response.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# This is a simulation of the chess logic explained above.\n# The code will not run a full chess engine, but will print the\n# best move based on the strategic analysis.\n\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chess position from FEN 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\n    and determines the best move for White.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The position is a well-known stalemate puzzle.\n    # White's goal is to force a draw because Black's d-pawn is too dangerous.\n    # The key move for White creates a stalemate trap.\n    #\n    # 1. White's move: Qe3\n    #    - This move attacks the black queen on c5.\n    #\n    # 2. Black's possible responses:\n    #    a) Black captures the queen: ...Qxe3\n    #       - This results in a stalemate. The black king on b6 has no legal moves.\n    #         The squares a6 and b5 are attacked by the white a4-pawn.\n    #         The squares c7 and a7 are blocked by black's own pawns.\n    #         The black pawns themselves cannot move.\n    #       - Therefore, ...Qxe3 leads to a draw.\n    #\n    #    b) Black moves the queen away to avoid the trade, e.g., ...Qd5\n    #       - White can respond with Qd3. This again offers a queen trade that\n    #         would lead to the exact same stalemate.\n    #       - If Black keeps avoiding the trade, White can force a draw by\n    #         repetition of moves (e.g., 1. Qe3 Qc5 2. Qd3 Qd5 3. Qe3).\n    #\n    # Conclusion: The move Qe3 guarantees a draw for White, which is the best\n    # possible outcome in this position.\n\n    best_move = \"Qe3\"\n    print(best_move)\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\n<<<Qe3>>>\n```"
