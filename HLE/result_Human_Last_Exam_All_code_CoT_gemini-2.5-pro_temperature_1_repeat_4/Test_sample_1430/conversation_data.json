    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve this problem, followed by a Python script that performs the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Relate the Neron-Severi rank of X to the curve C:**\n    Let `C` be a smooth projective curve of genus `g`, and let `X = Sym^d(C)` be its `d`-th symmetric power. The variety `X` parameterizes effective divisors of degree `d` on `C`.\n    When the degree `d` is large enough, specifically `d >= 2g - 1`, the variety `X` has a very nice structure: it is a projective bundle over the Jacobian of the curve, `J = Jac(C)`. The Jacobian `J` is an abelian variety of dimension `g`.\n    For such a projective bundle, the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the total space `X` is related to the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the base `J` by a simple formula:\n    `rank(NS(X)) = rank(NS(J)) + 1`.\n    In our case, `C` has genus `g = 3` and we are considering the `d = 15`-th symmetric power. The condition `d >= 2g - 1` becomes `15 >= 2*3 - 1`, which is `15 >= 5`. The condition holds.\n    So, our problem reduces to finding the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian, `rank(NS(J))`.\n\n2.  **Find the smallest possible rank for `NS(J)`:**\n    The rank of the Neron-Severi group of an abelian variety `J` depends on its endomorphism algebra. For a \"generic\" curve `C` of genus 3, its Jacobian `J` is a simple abelian variety with the smallest possible endomorphism ring, `End(J) = Z`. In this case, the Neron-Severi group `NS(J)` is generated by the principal polarization (the theta divisor), and its rank is 1. This is the minimum possible rank.\n\n3.  **Find the largest possible rank for `NS(J)`:**\n    The rank of `NS(J)` is maximized when the curve `C` is very special, leading to a Jacobian with a large ring of endomorphisms (Complex Multiplication). The maximum possible rank for a `g`-dimensional abelian variety occurs when it is isogenous to the `g`-th power of a single elliptic curve with complex multiplication, i.e., `J ~ E^g`.\n    For such an abelian variety, the rank of the Neron-Severi group is `g^2`.\n    In our case, `g = 3`, so the maximum possible rank is `3^2 = 9`. This maximum is indeed achieved for certain curves, for instance, the Fermat curve of degree 4 (`x^4 + y^4 = z^4`), which has genus 3.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final answer for X:**\n    Using the formula from step 1, we can now find the smallest and largest ranks for `NS(X)`.\n    *   **Smallest rank:** `rank(NS(J))_{min} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    *   **Largest rank:** `rank(NS(J))_{max} + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10`.\n\nThe following Python script formalizes this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group\n    of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the given parameters.\n    g = 3  # Genus of the Riemann surface C\n    d = 15 # Degree of the symmetric power X = Sym^d(C)\n\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the smallest and largest Neron-Severi rank for X = Sym^d(C),\")\n    print(f\"where g = {g} and d = {d}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Relate the rank of NS(X) to the rank of NS(Jac(C)).\n    # This relation holds because d >= 2g - 1.\n    # 15 >= 2*3 - 1  => 15 >= 5, which is true.\n    # The relation is: rank(NS(X)) = rank(NS(Jac(C))) + 1.\n    print(\"For d >= 2g - 1, the rank of the Neron-Severi group of X is given by:\")\n    print(\"rank(NS(X)) = rank(NS(Jac(C))) + 1\")\n    print(\"\\nOur task is now to find the minimum and maximum rank of NS(Jac(C)) for a genus 3 curve.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the minimum possible rank for NS(Jac(C)).\n    # This occurs for a generic curve C, where rank(NS(Jac(C))) is 1.\n    rho_J_min = 1\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate the smallest rank for NS(X).\n    rho_X_min = rho_J_min + 1\n\n    print(\"Finding the smallest possible rank:\")\n    print(f\"The minimum possible rank for NS(Jac(C)) of a genus {g} curve is {rho_J_min}.\")\n    print(\"This occurs for a generic curve.\")\n    print(f\"The smallest rank of NS(X) is therefore: {rho_J_min} + 1 = {rho_X_min}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 5: Determine the maximum possible rank for NS(Jac(C)).\n    # This occurs for a special curve C whose Jacobian has maximal complex multiplication.\n    # In this case, rank(NS(Jac(C))) = g^2.\n    rho_J_max = g**2\n    \n    # Step 6: Calculate the largest rank for NS(X).\n    rho_X_max = rho_J_max + 1\n\n    print(\"Finding the largest possible rank:\")\n    print(f\"The maximum possible rank for NS(Jac(C)) of a genus {g} curve is g^2 = {g}^2 = {rho_J_max}.\")\n    print(\"This occurs for special curves, like the Fermat curve of degree 4.\")\n    print(f\"The largest rank of NS(X) is therefore: {rho_J_max} + 1 = {rho_X_max}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\nsolve_neron_severi_rank()\n```\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
