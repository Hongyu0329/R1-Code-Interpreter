# This script solves the group theory problem by first analyzing the group G,
# then determining the set of extensions E, and finally computing the sum
# of the orders of their outer automorphism groups.
#

# Step 1: Analyze the group G.
# The presentation of G is <a, b, c, d | aba^{-1} = a^2, bcb^{-1} = c^2, cdc^{-1} = d^2, dad^{-1} = a^2>.
# We will show that G is the trivial group.

# Proof Sketch:
# 1. From the relation `aba^{-1} = a^2`, we can right-multiply by `a` to get `ab = a^3`.
#    Since `a` is an element of a group, it is invertible. Left-multiplying by `a^{-1}` yields `b = a^2`.

# 2. Substitute `b = a^2` into the relations. The non-trivial relations become:
#    - `(a^2)c(a^2)^{-1} = c^2`  (from `bcb^{-1} = c^2`)
#    - `cdc^{-1} = d^2`
#    - `dad^{-1} = a^2`

# 3. Let `X = a^2`. The relations for G can be used to find relations between `X` and `c`.
#    - The first new relation is `XcX^{-1} = c^2`.
#    - We can derive another relation. Conjugate `dad^{-1} = X` by `c`:
#      `c(dad^{-1})c^{-1} = cXc^{-1}`
#      The left side can be transformed using the other relations:
#      `c(dad^{-1})c^{-1} = (cdc^{-1})a(cdc^{-1})^{-1} = d^2 a (d^2)^{-1} = d(dad^{-1})d^{-1} = dXd^{-1}`.
#      And `dXd^{-1} = d(a^2)d^{-1} = (dad^{-1})^2 = X^2`.
#      So, we get the second relation: `cXc^{-1} = X^2`.

# 4. The elements `X` and `c` must satisfy the relations for the group `F(2,2)`:
#    (i) `XcX^{-1} = c^2` and (ii) `cXc^{-1} = X^2`.
#    This group is known to be trivial. Let's show this:
#    From (i), `Xc = c^2X`. From (ii), `cX = X^2c`.
#    From `Xc = c^2X`, we can write `X = c^2Xc^{-1}`.
#    From `cX = X^2c`, we can write `c = X^2cX^{-1}`.
#    Substituting `c` in the first equation: `X = c(cX)c^{-1} = c(X^2c)c^{-1} = cX^2`.
#    So we have `X = cX^2`. Right-multiplying by `X^{-1}` gives `1 = cX`, so `c = X^{-1}`.
#    Now substitute `c = X^{-1}` back into relation (i):
#    `X(X^{-1})X^{-1} = (X^{-1})^2`
#    `X^{-1} = X^{-2}`
#    `X = 1`.
#    Since `X=1`, `c = X^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1`.

# 5. With `c=1` and `X=a^2=1`, the other generators must also be 1.
#    - `d = d^2` (from `cdc^{-1}=d^2`), so `d=1`.
#    - `a = a^2` (from `dad^{-1}=a^2`), so `a=1`.
#    - `b = a^2`, so `b=1`.
#    Therefore, the group G is the trivial group {1}.

# Step 2: Characterize the set of central extensions E.
# The isomorphism classes of central extensions of G by C are classified by H^2(G, C).
# Since G = {1}, H^2({1}, C) = {0}. This means there is only one such extension,
# which is the direct product E = C x G.
# Given C is the cyclic group of order 31, E is isomorphic to Z_31.

num_extensions = 1

# Step 3: Compute the order of Out(E).
# E is the cyclic group Z_31. Out(E) = Aut(E) / Inn(E).
# Since E is abelian, Inn(E) is trivial, so Out(E) is isomorphic to Aut(E).
# The order of Aut(Z_n) is given by Euler's totient function phi(n).
order_C = 31
# For a prime p, phi(p) = p - 1.
order_of_out_E = order_C - 1

# Step 4: Compute the final sum.
# The collection E contains only one group, E = Z_31.
# The sum is just the single term o(E).
total_sum = order_of_out_E

# Step 5: Output the result.
# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
# The sum is over a single element, so the equation is 1 * o(E) = sum.
print("The group G is the trivial group {1}.")
print(f"The set E of central extensions has {num_extensions} element.")
print(f"The single extension E is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order {order_C}.")
print(f"The order of the outer automorphism group o(E) is phi({order_C}) = {order_of_out_E}.")
print("\nThe final sum is computed as follows:")
print(f"Sum = {num_extensions} * {order_of_out_E}")
print(f"Sum = {total_sum}")
