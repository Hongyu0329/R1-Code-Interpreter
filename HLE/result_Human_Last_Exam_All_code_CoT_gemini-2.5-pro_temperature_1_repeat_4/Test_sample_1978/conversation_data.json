    "To find the index of the boundary-value problem, we'll follow a clear plan:\n\n1.  **Determine `n`**, the dimension of the system of differential equations. This is the number of components in the vector `x(t)`.\n2.  **Determine `k`**, the number of linearly independent boundary conditions. This requires analyzing the given equations to eliminate any redundancies.\n3.  **Calculate the index** using the standard formula for linear boundary-value problems: `index = k - n`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n*   **Step 1: Find `n`**\n    The problem defines the state vector as `x(t) = (x_{1}(t), x_{2}(t), x_{3}(t), ..., x_{2024}(t))`. This means the system is composed of 2024 separate differential equations. Therefore, the dimension of the system is `n = 2024`. The inconsistent dimensions mentioned for `A` and `I` are disregarded as they contradict the explicit definition of `x(t)` and the indices used in the boundary conditions.\n\n*   **Step 2: Find `k`**\n    We are given six boundary conditions. Let's check for linear independence:\n    1.  `x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0`\n    2.  `x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0`\n    3.  `5x_{2}(T) - 5x_{2}(0) = 0`  (This is just `5 * (x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0)) = 0`, which is equivalent to condition 2)\n    4.  `100x_{2}(T) - 100x_{2}(0) = 0` (Equivalent to condition 2)\n    5.  `1000 x_{2}(0) - 1000 x_{2}(T) = 0` (Equivalent to condition 2)\n    6.  `100x_{2024}(T) - 100x_{2024}(0) = 0` (This simplifies to `x_{2024}(T) - x_{2024}(0) = 0`)\n\n    As you can see, conditions 3, 4, and 5 are just scalar multiples of condition 2. Therefore, there are only three unique, linearly independent constraints: one for `x_1`, one for `x_2`, and one for `x_2024`. So, `k = 3`.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the Index**\n    Now we apply the formula `index = k - n`.\n\nThe following Python script formalizes this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_problem_index():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the index of the given boundary-value problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the dimension of the system, n.\n    # The state vector is x(t) = (x_1(t), ..., x_2024(t)), which means there are\n    # 2024 differential equations in the system.\n    n = 2024\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions, k.\n    # The given boundary conditions are:\n    # 1. On x_1:  x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0\n    # 2. On x_2:  x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0\n    # 3. On x_2:  5 * (x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0  (redundant)\n    # 4. On x_2:  100 * (x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0 (redundant)\n    # 5. On x_2: -1000 * (x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0 (redundant)\n    # 6. On x_2024: 100 * (x_2024(T) - x_2024(0)) = 0\n    #\n    # Counting the unique, independent conditions, we have one for x_1, one for x_2,\n    # and one for x_2024.\n    k = 3\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the index using the formula: index = k - n.\n    index = k - n\n\n    print(\"Calculating the index of the boundary-value problem:\")\n    print(f\"Dimension of the system (n): {n}\")\n    print(f\"Number of linearly independent boundary conditions (k): {k}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe index is calculated using the formula: index = k - n\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: index = {k} - {n}\")\n    print(f\"Result: index = {index}\")\n\n\nsolve_problem_index()\n```\n<<<-2021>>>"
