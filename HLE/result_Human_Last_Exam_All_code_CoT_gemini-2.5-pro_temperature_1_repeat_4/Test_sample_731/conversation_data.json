    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we can follow these steps.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$ or $SD_{2^n}$ where $2^n = 512$, which means $n=9$. The group is defined by the presentation $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$. For $n=9$, this is $\\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Understand \"Power Subgroup\":** A power subgroup is another name for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element of the group, i.e., a subgroup of the form $\\langle g \\rangle = \\{ g^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$.\n\n3.  **Categorize Cyclic Subgroups:** The elements of $SD_{512}$ are of two forms: those in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ (i.e., $r^i$) and those not in it (i.e., $sr^i$). We can find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups by counting the number of unique subgroups generated by elements of each type.\n\n    *   **Type 1: Subgroups of $\\langle r \\rangle$:** The subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ is cyclic of order $2^{n-1} = 2^8 = 256$. A fundamental theorem of cyclic groups states that a cyclic group of order $m$ has exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $m$. The number of divisors of $256$ ($2^8$) is $8+1=9$. This corresponds to $n=9$ subgroups.\n\n    *   **Type 2: Subgroups generated by $sr^i$ with $i$ even:** These elements can be shown to have order 2. There are $2^{n-2} = 2^7 = 128$ such elements. Each generates a distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2.\n\n    *   **Type 3: Subgroups generated by $sr^i$ with $i$ odd:** These elements can be shown to have order 4. There are $2^{n-2} = 2^7 = 128$ such elements. Each cyclic subgroup of order 4 has $\\phi(4)=2$ generators. Therefore, these elements form $128 / 2 = 64$ distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n\n4.  **Sum the results:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from these three disjoint categories.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_power_subgroups_in_semidihedral_512():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups)\n    in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n    # For a semidihedral group SD_2^n, the size is 2^n.\n    # 2^n = 512 => n = log2(512)\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    # 1. Cyclic subgroups contained within the main cyclic subgroup <r> of order 2^(n-1).\n    # A cyclic group of order m has one subgroup for each divisor of m.\n    # The order of <r> is 2^(n-1) = 2^8 = 256. The number of divisors of 2^k is k+1.\n    # So, the number of subgroups of <r> is (n-1)+1 = n.\n    num_subgroups_in_r = n\n\n    # 2. Cyclic subgroups of order 2 generated by elements of the form s*r^i where i is even.\n    # The number of such elements is 2^(n-2). Each generates a distinct subgroup.\n    num_subgroups_order2_outside_r = 2**(n - 2)\n\n    # 3. Cyclic subgroups of order 4 generated by elements of the form s*r^i where i is odd.\n    # The number of such elements is 2^(n-2). Each subgroup of order 4 has phi(4)=2 generators.\n    # So, the number of distinct subgroups is (2^(n-2)) / 2 = 2^(n-3).\n    num_subgroups_order4_outside_r = 2**(n - 3)\n\n    # The total number of power subgroups is the sum of these three types.\n    total_subgroups = num_subgroups_in_r + num_subgroups_order2_outside_r + num_subgroups_order4_outside_r\n\n    print(\"The semidihedral group of size 512 corresponds to n=9 in the SD_2^n family.\")\n    print(\"The total number of power (cyclic) subgroups is calculated by summing three distinct types of subgroups:\")\n    print(f\"1.
