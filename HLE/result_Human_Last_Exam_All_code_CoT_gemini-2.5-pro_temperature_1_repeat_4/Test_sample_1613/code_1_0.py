# There are 4 trees (A, B, C, D) that are visible and can act as blockers.
num_visible_trees = 4

# A child's location is determined by a pair of blocking trees, one for E and one for F.
# Let's find the number of choices for the tree blocking E.
choices_for_blocker_E = num_visible_trees

# The tree blocking F must be different from the tree blocking E.
# This is because the problem states no three trees are collinear.
# If the same tree blocked both E and F, then E, F, and that tree would be on a single line.
choices_for_blocker_F = num_visible_trees - 1

# The total number of unique locations is the number of ways to choose an ordered pair
# of two distinct trees from the four available. This is a permutation P(4, 2).
