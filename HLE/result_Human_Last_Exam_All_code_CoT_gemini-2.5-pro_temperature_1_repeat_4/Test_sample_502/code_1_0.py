    # 3. Relate the dimension of the quotient ring R/I to the group order.
    # The group G acts on V = C^10 via a homomorphism rho: G -> GL_10(C).
    # The set of G-invariant polynomials is identical to the set of rho(G)-invariant polynomials.
    # Let G_effective = rho(G) be the group effectively acting on V.
    # A theorem in invariant theory states that dim(R/I) = |G_effective|.
    #
    # By the first isomorphism theorem, |G_effective| = |rho(G)| = |G| / |ker(rho)|.
    # So, dim(R/I) = |G| / |ker(rho)|.
    
    # 4. Maximize the dimension.
    # To find the largest possible dimension, we need to choose a group G (of order 10000)
    # and a representation rho: G -> GL_10(C) that maximizes this value.
    # Maximizing |G| / |ker(rho)| is equivalent to minimizing |ker(rho)|.
    
    # The minimum possible order for a group is 1 (the trivial group).

    # This minimum is achieved if the representation rho is faithful (ker(rho) = {e}).
    # If a faithful representation exists, the maximum dimension is:
    max_dimension = group_order / min_kernel_order
    
    # 5. Check for the existence of such a group and representation.
    # Does a group G of order 10000 exist that has a faithful representation in GL_10(C)?
    # Yes. For example, the group G = (Z/100Z) x (Z/100Z) has order 100*100 = 10000.
    # It has a faithful 2-dimensional representation, which can be embedded in GL_10(C).
    # Therefore, a dimension of 10000 is achievable.
    
    # 6. Output the reasoning and the final answer.
