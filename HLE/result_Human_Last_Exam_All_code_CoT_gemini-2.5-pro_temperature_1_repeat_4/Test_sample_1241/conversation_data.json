    "To solve this problem, we need to find the steady-state probabilities of the system. The steady state is reached as time $t$ approaches infinity ($t \\to +\\infty$), at which point the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant. This means their time derivatives, $P_i'(t)$, become zero.\n\nLet $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$ be the steady-state probabilities. By setting all derivatives in the given system of equations to zero, we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations:\n\n1.  $0 = -0.019 P_0 + 0.65 P_1$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 P_0 - (0.65 + 0.4) P_1 + 0.392 P_2 + 0.008 P_3$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 P_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) P_2$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 P_2 - 0.008 P_3$\n5.  $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n\nOur plan is to solve this system for the probabilities $P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3$ and then compute the required sum $P_0 + P_1$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  From equations (1), (3), and (4), we will express $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in terms of $P_1$.\n2.  Substitute these expressions into the normalization equation (5) to solve for the numerical value of $P_1$.\n3.  Calculate the numerical value of $P_0$ using the relationship found in step 1.\n4.  Finally, compute the sum $P_0 + P_1$.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this plan, calculate the values, and print the final equation with the numbers plugged in, as well as the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Set a higher precision for floating-point output\n# This is optional but can be useful for verification\n# sys.float_info.dig = 15\n\n# Step 1: Define the given transition rates (lambda values)\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# Step 2: Express P0, P2, and P3 in terms of P1\n# From P0'(t) = 0: -lambda_01*P0 + lambda_10*P1 = 0  => P0 = (lambda_10 / lambda_01) * P1\n# Let's call the coefficient c0\nc0 = lambda_10 / lambda_01\n\n# From P2'(t) = 0: lambda_12*P1 - (lambda_21 + lambda_23)*P2 = 0 => P2 = (lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)) * P1\n# Let's call the coefficient c2\nc2 = lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)\n\n# From P3'(t) = 0: lambda_23*P2 - lambda_31*P3 = 0 => P3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * P2\n# Substitute P2: P3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * c2 * P1\n# Let's call the coefficient c3\nc3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * c2\n\n# Step 3: Use the normalization condition P0 + P1 + P2 + P3 = 1\n# c0*P1 + P1 + c2*P1 + c3*P1 = 1\n# P1 * (c0 + 1 + c2 + c3) = 1\n# P1 = 1 / (c0 + 1 + c2 + c3)\n\n# We need to find P0 + P1\n# P0 + P1 = c0*P1 + P1 = (c0 + 1) * P1\n# P0 + P1 = (c0 + 1) / (c0 + 1 + c2 + c3)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final result\nnumerator = c0 + 1\ndenominator = c0 + 1 + c2 + c3\nresult = numerator / denominator\n\n# Step 5: Print the final equation with the numbers and the result\nprint(\"The relationship between the steady-state probabilities can be expressed in terms of P1:\")\nprint(f\"P0 = ({lambda_10}/{lambda_01}) * P1 = {c0:.4f} * P1\")\nprint(f\"P2 = ({lambda_12}/({lambda_21}+{lambda_23})) * P1 = {c2:.4f} * P1\")\nprint(f\"P3 = ({lambda_23}/{lambda_31}) * P2 = {c3:.4f} * P1\\n\")\n\nprint(\"The quantity P0(inf) + P1(inf) is calculated as (c0 + 1) / (c0 + 1 + c2 + c3).\")\nprint(\"Plugging in the numbers for the coefficients:\")\nprint(f\"P0(inf) + P1(inf) = ({c0:.15f} + 1) / ({c0:.15f} + 1 + {c2:.1f} + {c3:.1f})\")\nprint(f\"P0(inf) + P1(inf) = {numerator:.15f} / {denominator:.15f}\")\nprint(f\"P0(inf) + P1(inf) = {result:.15f}\")\n```\n<<<0.946252914199583>>>"
