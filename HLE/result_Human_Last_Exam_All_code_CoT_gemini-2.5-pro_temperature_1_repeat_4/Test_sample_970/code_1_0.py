def solve_bayesian_assumptions():
    """
    This function determines the necessary assumption for the expected information gain
    of a Bayesian agent to approach zero and formats the answer in Conjunctive Normal Form.

    The key insight is that the total expected information gain over all time is
    bounded by the entropy of the agent's initial prior distribution.

    1. Total_Expected_Information_Gain = Sum_{t=0 to inf} E[KL(p_{t+1} || p_t)]
    2. This sum is equal to H(p_0) - E[H(p_inf)], where H is entropy, p_0 is the prior,
       and p_inf is the final posterior.
    3. Since entropy is non-negative, H(p_inf) >= 0.
    4. Therefore, Total_Expected_Information_Gain <= H(p_0).
    5. For the sum of a series of non-negative terms (the expected info gain at each step)
       to be finite, the terms must approach zero.
    6. This requires the upper bound, H(p_0), to be finite.

    Therefore, the necessary assumption is that the prior has finite entropy (a).

    The answer in Conjunctive Normal Form for a single literal 'a' is [(a)].
