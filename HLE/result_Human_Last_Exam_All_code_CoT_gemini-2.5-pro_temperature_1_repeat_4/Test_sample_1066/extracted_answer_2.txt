The relationship between the expected score E[S], the average entropy alpha, and pi is complex and does not yield a simple, universally tight lower bound of the form n*alpha + C*pi^2. The code provided in the thought process demonstrates how to compute the exact score and two different lower bounds, one involving entropy and another involving pi, allowing for numerical exploration. A provable but complex bound is E[S] >= sum_{t=1 to n} max(H_t + sum_i(p_{t,i}*ln(p_{t,i}+1)), (pi^2/6)*sum_i(p_{t,i}/(p_{t,i}+1))). A simpler, though not always tighter, bound using both is the maximum of the simplified bounds: max(n*alpha, n*pi^2/12).
