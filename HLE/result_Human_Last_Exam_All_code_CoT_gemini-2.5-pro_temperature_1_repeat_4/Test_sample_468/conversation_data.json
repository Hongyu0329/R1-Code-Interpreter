    "I will find the current common name for the genus *Perdita* and the year it was established or widely popularized.\n\n1.  **Find the Common Name:** I will search entomological databases, conservation websites (like the Xerces Society), and popular field guides to find the most accepted common name for bees in the genus *Perdita*. These bees are known for their very small size and often iridescent colors. My research indicates the most widely used common name is \"fairy bees\".\n\n2.  **Find the Year:** Common names often don't have a single, official \"coining\" date like scientific names. They come into use gradually. However, we can often point to a specific publication that cemented the name in popular and scientific discourse. The name \"fairy bees\" was significantly popularized by the publication of the book \"California Bees and Blooms: A Guide for Gardeners and Naturalists\" by Gordon W. Frankie, Robbin W. Thorp, et al. in 2014. While the term may have been used informally before, this publication represents a key, citable moment for its establishment.\n\n3.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a simple Python script to format and print the final answer as requested.\n\n```python\ndef get_bee_common_name_info():\n  \"\"\"\n  Provides the common name and year of popularization for the bee genus Perdita.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The common name \"fairy bees\" is widely used for the genus Perdita due to their small size.\n  common_name = \"fairy bees\"\n\n  # The name was significantly popularized and established in the influential 2014 book\n  # \"California Bees and Blooms: A Guide for Gardeners and Naturalists\".\n  year = 2014\n\n  # Print the final answer in the format \"<name>, <year>\"\n  print(f\"{common_name}, {year}\")\n\nget_bee_common_name_info()\n```\n<<<fairy bees, 2014>>>"
