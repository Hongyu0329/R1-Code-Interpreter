    "Of course. Here is the plan to answer your question. I will write a Python script that identifies the specific verses (bayt) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' where the names of the 25 prophets are listed. The script will first define the starting and ending verse numbers. It will then display the content of these verses for context and clarity. Finally, it will print a conclusive statement specifying the range of verses, from the starting number to the ending number.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophet_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the verses in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n    that list the names of the Prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The 25 prophets are mentioned by name starting from bayt 30 and ending at bayt 33.\n    start_bayt = 30\n    end_bayt = 33\n\n    # A dictionary to hold the verses for context.\n    # Keys are verse numbers, values are the Arabic text.\n    verses = {\n        30: \"هُمُ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسٌ نُوْحٌ هُودٌ مَعَ صَالِحٍ * وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَــعُ\",\n        31: \"وَلُوطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيْلُ إِسْحَاقُ كَذَا يَعْقُوبٌ * وَيُوسُفُ وَأَيُّوبٌ احْتَذَى\",\n        32: \"شُعَيْبٌ هَارُونٌ وَمُوسَى وَالْيَسَعْ ذُو الْكِفْلِ * دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَـــعْ\",\n        33: \"إِلْيَاسٌ يُونُسٌ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى عِيْسَى وَطَهَ * خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيًّا وَاهْتَدِ\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"The verses (bayt) in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the Prophets are:\\n\")\n\n    for i in range(start_bayt, end_bayt + 1):\n        print(f\"Bayt {i}: {verses[i]}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"Conclusion: The names of the Prophets are mentioned from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_prophet_verses()\n```\n<<<from bayt 30 to bayt 33>>>"
