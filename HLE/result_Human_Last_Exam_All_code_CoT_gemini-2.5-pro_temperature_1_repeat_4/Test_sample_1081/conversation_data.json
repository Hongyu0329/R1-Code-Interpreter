    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\nFirst, I will explain the mathematical theory that connects the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of the group $G$ to a property of its associated Weyl group. This involves concepts from the theory of algebraic groups over finite fields.\n\nSpecifically:\n1.  The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of $F$-conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W$, where $F$ is the Frobenius endomorphism.\n2.  For a group of type $E_8$, it is always \"split\" over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This means the Frobenius map acts trivially on the Weyl group.\n3.  Consequently, the problem simplifies to finding the number of ordinary conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe number of conjugacy classes for exceptional Weyl groups like $W(E_8)$ is a well-established mathematical result that is non-trivial to compute from first principles. Therefore, the Python code will not derive this number but will use the known value and present the solution by printing the logical steps leading to the final answer. The code will explicitly state the final equation with all the numbers involved.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out this plan:\n\n```python\ndef solve_tori_count_E8():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of Fq-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type E8.\n    \n    The solution is based on established theorems in the theory of algebraic groups\n    and the known structure of the Weyl group of type E8.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The reductive group G is of type E8.\n    group_type = \"E8\"\n\n    # The number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group W(E8) is a known mathematical result.\n    # It was first computed by R. W. Carter in 1972.\n    num_classes_W_E8 = 112\n\n    # The following print statements explain the reasoning step-by-step.\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Relate the number of tori to the Weyl group.\")\n    print(\"The number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group G over the finite field F_q is equal to the number of F-conjugacy classes in its Weyl group W. (F is the Frobenius map)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the specific case for a group of type E8.\")\n    print(f\"For a group G of type {group_type}, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms.\")\n    print(\"This implies that any such group over F_q is 'split', which means the Frobenius map F acts trivially on the Weyl group W(E8).\")\n    print(\"As a result, an F-conjugacy class is the same as an ordinary conjugacy class.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Use the known number of conjugacy classes for W(E8).\")\n    print(f\"The problem is now to find the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group W({group_type}).\")\n    print(f\"This is a known result from the mathematical literature, and the value is {num_classes_W_E8}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    \n    print(\"Final Result:\")\n    print(\"The exact number is determined by the following equation:\")\n    print(f\"Number of F_q-rational maximal tori in G = Number of conjugacy classes in W({group_type}) = {num_classes_W_E8}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_tori_count_E8()\n```\n<<<112>>>"
