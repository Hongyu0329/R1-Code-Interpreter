    """
    This function deduces the identity of a starting material (Compound A)
    based on a two-step reaction and the NMR spectra of the final product.
    """

    # Step 1: Analyze the reaction and NMR data to determine the final product's structure.

    # Reaction Summary:
    # Compound A is first reacted with tert-butyl hydrazine, then with benzylamine.
    # This suggests Compound A has two reactive sites for nucleophilic substitution.

    # NMR Fragment Analysis:
    # - 1H NMR δ 1.70 (s, 9H) and 13C NMR δ 59.79, 29.25 indicate a tert-butyl group from tert-butyl hydrazine.
    # - 1H NMR δ 7.37–7.22 (m, 5H), δ 4.73 (d, 2H), and δ 8.69 (t, 1H) indicate a benzylamino group (-NH-CH2-Ph) from benzylamine.

    # Core Structure Analysis:
    # After accounting for the substituents, five 13C NMR signals remain for the core skeleton:
    # δ 156.89, 154.96, 152.80, 130.16, 102.23.
    # A core with 5 carbons is characteristic of a purine ring system, not a pyrimidine (which has 4 carbons).
    
    # The chemical shifts match a purine skeleton:
    # - δ 156.89, 154.96, 152.80: C2, C4, C6 (carbons bonded to nitrogen).
    # - δ 130.16: C8 (CH carbon in the 5-membered ring).
    # - δ 102.23: C5 (quaternary carbon at the ring fusion).
    #
    # The 1H NMR singlets at δ 8.24 and δ 8.11 correspond to the purine's C8-H and N9-H protons.

    # Step 2: Work backward to identify Compound A.
    
    # The final product is a purine with a tert-butylhydrazinyl group and a benzylamino group attached.
    # These groups were added via nucleophilic substitution. Therefore, Compound A must be a purine
    # with two leaving groups at the positions of substitution.
    # The most common precursor for such a synthesis is a dichloropurine.
    
    # The standard numbering for purine places these reactive sites at positions 2 and 6.
    
    # Conclusion: Compound A is 2,6-dichloropurine.
