    "This is a classic geography riddle. The answer is Hanga Roa, the main town and harbor on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).\n\nHere is my plan to arrive at the solution and provide the requested code:\n1.  **Identify the key clues:**\n    *   Island town.\n    *   Extremely remote: \"more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island\".\n    *   Geographical feature: \"sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera\".\n    *   Name: The town, bay, and caldera share a name.\n\n2.  **Evaluate candidates:**\n    *   **Santorini, Greece:** Sits on a famous caldera bay, but is not remote.\n    *   **Tristan da Cunha:** Extremely remote, but its settlement (Edinburgh of the Seven Seas) doesn't sit in a bay of the same name.\n    *   **Hanga Roa, Easter Island:** \"Hanga Roa\" means \"Wide Bay\" in the Rapa Nui language, so the town is named after the bay it sits on. The entire island is a massive volcano, and the bay is a direct feature of its volcanic coastline. Easter Island is famously remote, with its nearest inhabited neighbor (Pitcairn Island) being over 2,000 km away. This fits all the clues.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Python script:** To fulfill the request for a coding solution, I will write a Python script that verifies the remoteness claim. It will calculate the great-circle distance between Hanga Roa, Easter Island, and its nearest inhabited neighbor, Adamstown, Pitcairn Island, using the Haversine formula. The script will then print the answer and the calculated distance, comparing it to the 500 km mentioned in the prompt.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_island_town():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the island town from the riddle and verifies its remoteness.\n    The town is Hanga Roa on Easter Island. We will calculate its distance to the\n    nearest inhabited neighbor, Pitcairn Island, to confirm it's over 500 km away.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The town name is the solution to the riddle.\n    town_name = \"Hanga Roa\"\n\n    # The distance from the riddle's condition.\n    riddle_distance_km = 500\n\n    # Coordinates in decimal degrees (Latitude, Longitude)\n    # Hanga Roa, Easter Island\n    lat1, lon1 = -27.1436, -109.4267\n    # Adamstown, Pitcairn Island\n    lat2, lon2 = -25.0667, -130.1000\n\n    # Earth's radius in kilometers\n    R = 6371\n\n    # Convert coordinates from degrees to radians\n    lat1_rad, lon1_rad = math.radians(lat1), math.radians(lon1)\n    lat2_rad, lon2_rad = math.radians(lat2), math.radians(lon2)\n\n    # Difference in coordinates\n    dlon = lon2_rad - lon1_rad\n    dlat = lat2_rad - lat1_rad\n\n    # Haversine formula to calculate the distance\n    a = math.sin(dlat / 2)**2 + math.cos(lat1_rad) * math.cos(lat2_rad) * math.sin(dlon / 2)**2\n    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1 - a))\n    calculated_distance_km = R * c\n\n    print(f\"The island town described is: {town_name}\")\n    print(f\"To verify its remoteness, we calculate the distance to its nearest inhabited neighbor (Pitcairn Island).\")\n    print(f\"The calculated distance is approximately {int(calculated_distance_km)} kilometers.\")\n    print(f\"This is significantly greater than the {riddle_distance_km} kilometers mentioned in the riddle.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the results\nfind_island_town()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
