    # Let kappa be an infinite cardinal.
    # Let kappa_plus be its cardinal successor.
    # Let lambda_card and mu_card be the cardinals defined in the problem.
    # The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of
    # max({lambda_card, mu_card}) \ min({lambda_card, mu_card}).

    # Step 1: Establish the relationship between mu_card and lambda_card.
    # A family of functions F that witnesses lambda_card (where functions in F agree
    # with any given function on a set of size kappa_plus) also witnesses mu_card
    # (where functions in F are greater than or equal to any given function on a
    # set of size kappa_plus), because equality implies inequality.
    # Therefore, the minimal size mu_card must be less than or equal to the size of F,
    # which is lambda_card.
    # So, we prove in ZFC that mu_card <= lambda_card.
    
    # Step 2: Simplify the expression.
    # Given mu_card <= lambda_card, the set becomes lambda_card \ mu_card.
    # The cardinality of this set is lambda_card if mu_card < lambda_card, and 0 otherwise.
    # We want to maximize this cardinality, so we look for the maximum possible value of lambda_card.

    # Step 3: Determine the maximum possible value of lambda_card.
    # The value of lambda_card is bounded by the total number of functions, which is 2^(kappa_plus).
    # Consistency results in set theory show that it is possible to have a model of ZFC where:
    #   - mu_card < 2^(kappa_plus)
    #   - lambda_card = 2^(kappa_plus)
    # In such a model, mu_card < lambda_card, and the cardinality of the difference set is lambda_card.

    # Step 4: Final Conclusion.
    # The maximum possible value for the cardinality of the set is the largest possible value
    # that lambda_card can take, which is 2^(kappa_plus).

    # The final equation representing the answer:
    # max_cardinality = 2^(kappa^+)
    
    base = 2
    exponent = "kappa^+"
    
    print(f"The maximum possible cardinality of max({{lambda,mu}}) \\ min({{lambda,mu}}) is {base}^({exponent}).")
    print("\n--- Final Equation ---")
    print(f"max_cardinality = {base}^({exponent})")
