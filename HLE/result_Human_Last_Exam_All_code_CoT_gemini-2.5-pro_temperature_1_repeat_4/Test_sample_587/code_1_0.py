### Analysis of the Complexity of #Sub_G(H) ###

The problem is to count subgraphs isomorphic to H in a given graph G, parameterized by k = |H|.
The class of host graphs, G, is 'somewhere dense' and closed under subgraphs.

Let's evaluate each statement:

[A] #Sub_G(H) is fixed-parameter tractable for every class H.
Analysis: FALSE. If H is the class of all cliques, the problem is #k-CLIQUE. This is the canonical #W[1]-complete problem and is considered fixed-parameter intractable.

[B] If H is the class of all cliques, then #Sub_G(H) is #W[1]-complete.
Analysis: TRUE. Counting k-cliques is known to be #W[1]-hard on any 'somewhere dense' class of graphs. Since the problem on a subclass of general graphs is trivially in #W[1], it is #W[1]-complete. This is a standard result in parameterized complexity.

[C] There exists a class H of graphs of degree at most 2 such that #Sub_G(H) is #W[1]-complete.
Analysis: FALSE. Graphs with maximum degree 2 have a treewidth of at most 2. Counting subgraphs of bounded treewidth is known to be fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), and therefore not #W[1]-complete.

[D] #Sub_G(H) is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if H has bounded treewidth.
Analysis: FALSE. The 'only if' part of this statement is too strong. It claims that for any H with unbounded treewidth, the problem is hard on G. However, the standard hardness proofs for some unbounded treewidth patterns (like grids) require host graphs that are 'nowhere dense'. Such graphs may not exist in the 'somewhere dense' class G, causing the reduction to fail.

[E] #Sub_G(H) is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if H has bounded vertex-cover number.
Analysis: FALSE. The 'only if' part is incorrect. Counting k-paths is FPT (as paths have treewidth 1), but the vertex cover number of a path is unbounded with its length. This is a counterexample.

### Conclusion ###
Based on the analysis, statement B is the only one that is definitively true under the given conditions.
