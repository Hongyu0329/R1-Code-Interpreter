    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph:** The graph \\( G \\) is defined as the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\), which we can write as \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\). The \"sum\" of graphs (also known as the graph join) means we take three separate \\( C_n \\) graphs and add every possible edge between the vertices of different cycles.\n\n2.  **Use the Chromatic Number of a Graph Sum:** A fundamental property of the graph sum operation is that the chromatic number of the resulting graph is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs.\n    Therefore, \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2 + \\dots + G_k) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) + \\dots + \\chi(G_k) \\).\n    For our graph \\( G \\), this translates to: \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) \\).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\( \\chi(C_n) \\)):** The chromatic number of a single cycle graph \\( C_n \\) depends on its length \\( n \\) (assuming \\( n \\ge 3 \\)):\n    *   If \\( n \\) is an even number, the cycle is bipartite and can be colored with 2 colors. So, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is an odd number, we need a third color for the last vertex. So, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n\n4.  **Find the Maximum Value:** The question asks for the *maximal* chromatic number of \\( G \\). To maximize \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) \\), we must choose \\( n \\) such that \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is at its maximum. The maximum value for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 3, which occurs when \\( n \\) is any odd integer.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** By substituting the maximal value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) into our equation, we get the maximal chromatic number for \\( G \\):\n    Maximal \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\).\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this logic and prints the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_maximal_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the maximal chromatic number of a graph G,\n    where G is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The problem is to find the maximal chromatic number of a graph G, where G is the sum of three cycles of length n.\")\n    print(\"Let the three cycles be C_n¹, C_n², and C_n³.\")\n    print(\"The graph G is their sum: G = C_n¹ + C_n² + C_n³.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Use the property of the chromatic number for a sum of graphs.\")\n    print(\"The chromatic number of a sum of graphs is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers.\")\n    print(\"So, χ(G) = χ(C_n¹) + χ(C_n²) + χ(C_n³) = 3 * χ(C_n).\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Determine the possible values for the chromatic number of a cycle, χ(C_n).\")\n    print(\"- If n is even (n >= 4), χ(C_n) = 2.\")\n    print(\"- If n is odd (n >= 3), χ(C_n) = 3.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Find the maximal value of χ(C_n).\")\n    print(\"The maximum value for χ(C_n) is 3, which occurs when n is an odd integer.\")\n    max_chi_cn = 3\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Calculate the maximal chromatic number of G.\")\n    print(\"To get the maximal χ(G), we use the maximal value of χ(C_n) in our formula.\")\n    \n    num_cycles = 3\n    maximal_chromatic_number = num_cycles * max_chi_cn\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{num_cycles} * {max_chi_cn} = {maximal_chromatic_number}\")\n\nsolve_maximal_chromatic_number()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
