    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will identify the physical characteristics of the sound produced by human muscle twitches. This type of sound, known as sonomyography, is extremely low-frequency, typically falling into the infrasound range (below 20 Hz).\n2.  Next, I will research the hearing frequency ranges for each of the animals listed in the answer choices (Dog, Bat, Herring, Whale, Human).\n3.  I will create a Python script to represent this data. The script will store the approximate lower limit of hearing for each animal in a dictionary.\n4.  The script will then iterate through this data, print out the hearing capabilities of each animal, and compare them to the frequency of muscle twitches.\n5.  By identifying which animal's hearing range extends lowest into the infrasound spectrum, I can determine the most likely candidate to hear such a faint, low-frequency sound. The final printout will show the comparison that leads to the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_animal_hearing_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the hearing ranges of different animals to determine which\n    is most likely to hear human muscle twitches.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Human muscle twitches produce very low-frequency sounds, typically in the\n    # infrasound range (below 20 Hz).\n    muscle_twitch_frequency_upper_limit = 20\n\n    # Approximate lower hearing thresholds for each animal in Hz.\n    # A lower number means better low-frequency hearing.\n    hearing_thresholds = {\n        'A.
