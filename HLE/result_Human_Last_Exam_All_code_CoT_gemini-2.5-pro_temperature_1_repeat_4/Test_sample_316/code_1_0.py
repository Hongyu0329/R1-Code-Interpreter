# The problem asks for a critical exponent from the theory of Fourier restriction
# for the cone in three-dimensional space. These exponents correspond to values of 'p'
# where the qualitative behavior of the inequality changes.

# One critical exponent is given as p = 4. This is the Tomas-Stein exponent,
# which represents the limit of what can be proven using linear arguments based on
# the decay of the Fourier transform of the surface measure.

# To obtain estimates for p < 4, more powerful techniques are required.
# The theory of bilinear and multilinear restriction estimates (developed by
# Tao, Vargas, Vega, Bennett, Carbery, and others) provides the necessary tools.
# In R^3, these methods are applicable for p > 3.

# Thus, p = 3 constitutes the second critical point. It is the boundary
# where the techniques based on bilinear and trilinear interactions of wave packets
# reach their limit, and the nature of the geometric extremizers for the inequality changes.

# The other critical exponent is 3.
other_critical_exponent = 3
