    This function analyzes the historical statements about the Duke of Wellington and identifies the correct ones.

    Statement Analysis:
    1. CORRECT - Wellington's experience with logistics and supply in India, particularly developing a mobile commissariat, was crucial to his success in the Peninsular War. Historians widely acknowledge that the lessons learned in India were adapted and refined in Spain and Portugal, leading to a vastly more efficient supply system than previous European campaigns.
    2. INCORRECT - While Wellington did develop a sophisticated intelligence network in India, the claim that it was "never successfully implemented in European theaters" is false. His intelligence network in the Peninsular War was legendary and a key factor in his victories against the French.
    3. INCORRECT - This is an overstatement. While Wellington's divisional structure was highly influential, there was no wholesale standardization of a specific "Deccan region" structure across the army in 1815. Army reforms were more gradual and complex.
    4. INCORRECT - The Royal Military College, Sandhurst, was founded in 1801 and moved to its current site in 1812, long before 1829. Wellington did not establish it in that year.
    5. INCORRECT - This is a strong negative claim that is historically inaccurate. The principles of logistics learned in India were highly relevant and influential.
    6. CORRECT - The British Empire consistently relied on integrating local forces into its military structure. Wellington's successful use of sepoys and other Indian troops provided a powerful and effective model that was replicated in other colonial contexts, such as with the King's African Rifles and Burma Rifles.
    7. INCORRECT - This statement is the opposite of the historical consensus. Wellington's Indian experience was formative in his understanding of logistics, which was a marked departure from conventional European military theory of the time.
    8. CORRECT - The use of fast-moving, self-sufficient "flying columns" was a tactic Wellington honed in India against mobile Maratha forces. He adapted this tactic for the Peninsular War and it became a standard tool in later colonial conflicts, including the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824-1826), where such units were essential for operating in difficult terrain.
    9. INCORRECT - The East India Company Charter Act of 1813 was primarily a political and economic reform focused on ending the Company's trade monopoly. It was not a military reform based on Wellington's principles.
    10. INCORRECT - Wellington's approach to protecting civilian populations and paying for supplies, first developed in India, was a core part of his successful strategy in the Peninsula. It won him local support and secured his supply lines, directly contradicting the claim that it had "no bearing".

    The correct options are 1, 6, and 8.
