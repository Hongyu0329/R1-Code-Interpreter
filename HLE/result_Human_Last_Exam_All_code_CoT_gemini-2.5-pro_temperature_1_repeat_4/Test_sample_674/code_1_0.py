# The final deduced rule is R(s[n]) = s[s[n-2]] + s[n - s[n-1]]
# Note: The sequence generated by this rule differs from the one in the prompt
# starting from the 5th term, which suggests a typo in the prompt's sequence.
# The sequence generated by this rule is actually OEIS A005228.
# For example, s[5] is calculated as s[s[3]] + s[5-s[4]] = s[2] + s[5-2] = s[2] + s[3] = 1 + 2 = 3.
# The prompt's sequence has s[5]=2.
