    # Problem summary: An experiment uses 500 mM GalNAc to inhibit an antibody from binding to glycosylated MUC1.
    # We need to determine the purpose and application step for an anti-FLAG antibody, which binds a tag on the MUC1 protein.

    # Step 1: Identify the purpose of the control.
    # High concentrations of solutes can cause cellular stress and lead to changes in protein expression on the cell surface.
    # The anti-FLAG antibody binds to the MUC1 protein regardless of its glycosylation.
    # Therefore, it can measure the total amount of MUC1 on the cell surface.
    # Its purpose is to confirm that the amount of MUC1 on the surface is not changed by the 500 mM GalNAc treatment.
    # This ensures that any observed decrease in the primary antibody's signal is due to specific, competitive inhibition, not an artifact.
    purpose = "verify GalNAc has not altered surface expression of MUC1"

    # Step 2: Determine the timing of the control antibody addition.
    # Antibodies that bind directly to the antigen of interest (in this case, the FLAG tag on MUC1) are called primary antibodies.
    # They are added in the first incubation step.
    # Secondary antibodies bind to primary antibodies and usually carry a fluorescent label for detection.
    # Since the anti-FLAG antibody binds directly to the MUC1 construct, it is a primary antibody.
    timing = "with the primary antibodies"

    # Step 3: Evaluate the provided choices.
    choices = {
        "A": "No need, controls are good",
        "B": "Anti-flag should be added with the secondary antibodies. Its included to control for potential off-target effects of the 500 mM GalNAc.",
        "C": "Anti-flag should be added with the primary antibodies. Its included to verify GalNAc has not altered surface expression of MUC1",
        "D": "Anti-flag should be added with the primary antibodies. Its included to control for potential off-target effects of the 500 mM GalNAc.",
        "E": "Anti-flag should be added with the secondary antibodies. Its included to verify GalNAc has not altered surface expression of MUC1"
    }

    # Find the choice that matches both the correct purpose and timing.

    print("The anti-FLAG antibody is essential. It's a primary antibody used to confirm that the high concentration of GalNAc (the inhibitor) doesn't cause a non-specific loss of the MUC1 protein from the cell surface. This validates that any observed inhibition is due to competition for the antibody's binding site.")
