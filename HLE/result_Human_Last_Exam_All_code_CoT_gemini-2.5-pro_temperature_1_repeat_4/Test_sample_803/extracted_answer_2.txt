The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` (for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m`) are the semidirect products `G = Q \rtimes_\alpha Z_2`, where `Q` is a group of order `q^m`, `\alpha` is an automorphism of `Q` of order 2, and the automorphism `\bar{\alpha}` induced by `\alpha` on the abelianization `Q_{ab} = Q/Q'` is the inversion map (i.e., `\bar{\alpha}(x) = x^{-1}` for all `x \in Q_{ab}`).
