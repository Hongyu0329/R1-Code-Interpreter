    "This is a problem in algebraic topology, specifically homotopy theory. I will solve it by identifying the given map as part of a known fiber sequence and then analyzing the connectivity of the fiber.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the map and spaces**: The map is $\\phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. Let $m=4$ and $n=6$. The map is a specific instance of $\\phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^m \\wedge \\Omega S^n) \\to \\Omega(S^m \\wedge S^n)$.\n2.  **Use a standard fiber sequence**: This map is known to fit into a fiber sequence:\n    $\\Omega S^{m+n-1} \\to \\Sigma(\\Omega S^m \\wedge \\Omega S^n) \\xrightarrow{\\phi} \\Omega(S^m \\wedge S^n)$.\n    The fiber of the map $\\phi$ is $F = \\Omega S^{m+n-1}$.\n3.  **Determine the connectivity of the fiber**: The connectivity of a space $X$ is the largest integer $k$ such that all homotopy groups $\\pi_i(X)$ are trivial for $i \\le k$.\n    *   For our specific map, the fiber is $F = \\Omega S^{4+6-1} = \\Omega S^9$.\n    *   The homotopy groups of a loop space are given by $\\pi_i(\\Omega X) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(X)$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\pi_i(\\Omega S^9) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(S^9)$.\n    *   The sphere $S^9$ is $(9-1)=8$-connected, meaning $\\pi_j(S^9) = 0$ for $j \\le 8$.\n    *   Thus, $\\pi_i(\\Omega S^9) = 0$ for $i+1 \\le 8$, which means $i \\le 7$.\n    *   The fiber $\\Omega S^9$ is 7-connected.\n4.  **Relate fiber connectivity to the map's connectivity**: A fundamental result states that a map is $k$-connected if its homotopy fiber is $(k-1)$-connected. The connectivity of a map $f: A \\to B$ is the largest integer $k$ for which the induced map $f_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$ is an isomorphism for $i < k$ and a surjection for $i = k$.\n    *   Since the fiber is 7-connected, the map $\\phi$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\n5.  **Confirm the result**: We can verify that the connectivity is exactly 8 and not higher by examining the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the fibration at the next level ($i=9$). This confirms that the map on $\\pi_9$ is not surjective, so the connectivity is not 9.\n\nThe following Python script will print out these steps and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    \"\"\"\n    m = 4\n    n = 6\n\n    print(\"Problem: Determine the connectivity of the map phi: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 1: Identify the relevant fiber sequence\n    print(f\"Step 1: The map is an instance of a general map for spheres S^m and S^n, with m={m} and n={n}.\")\n    print(\"This map fits into a well-known fiber sequence in homotopy theory:\")\n    print(\"F -> Sigma(Omega S^m wedge Omega S^n) -> Omega(S^m wedge S^n)\")\n    print(\"where the fiber F is Omega S^(m+n-1).\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the dimension of the sphere in the fiber\n    fiber_sphere_dim = m + n - 1\n    print(f\"Step 2: For m={m} and n={n}, the fiber F is Omega S^({m}+{n}-1) = Omega S^{fiber_sphere_dim}.\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the connectivity of the fiber\n    print(f\"Step 3: Determine the connectivity of the fiber F = Omega S^{fiber_sphere_dim}.\")\n    print(f\"A sphere S^k is (k-1)-connected.
