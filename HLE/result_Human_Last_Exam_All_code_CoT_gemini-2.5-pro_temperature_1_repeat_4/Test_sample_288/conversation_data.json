    "To find the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans, I will programmatically analyze the publicly available connectome dataset.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Fetch the Data**: I will retrieve the C. elegans hermaphrodite connectome data from WormWiring.org. This data is in a CSV format and contains a list of all synaptic connections.\n2.  **Process the Data**: I'll use the Python `pandas` library to read and handle the data. The raw file contains some introductory text, which needs to be skipped to read the data table correctly.\n3.  **Filter Connections**: I will filter this data to isolate only the chemical synapses (`type` 'S') that originate from the presynaptic neuron 'ASJ'.\n4.  **Aggregate Synapses**: After filtering, I will group the connections by the postsynaptic (target) neuron and sum the number of synapses for each target.\n5.  **Identify the Main Target**: Finally, I will identify the target neuron that receives the highest number of synapses from ASJ and print this result. I will also display the synapse counts for all targets to provide full context, satisfying the requirement to show all relevant numbers.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport io\nimport requests\n\ndef find_asj_main_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the main synaptic target of the ASJ neuron in C. elegans.\n\n    This function fetches the C. elegans connectome data, filters for presynaptic\n    connections from ASJ, and identifies the postsynaptic neuron with the\n    highest number of synapses.\n    \"\"\"\n    # URL for the adult C. elegans hermaphrodite connectome data\n    url = \"http://www.wormwiring.org/db/DATA/herm_full_edgelist.csv\"\n\n    print(f\"Fetching connectome data from {url}...\")\n\n    try:\n        # Get the data from the URL\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Check for HTTP errors\n\n        # The CSV data is preceded by comments.
