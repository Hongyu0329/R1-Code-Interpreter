    This function identifies the correct statements regarding the safety of Subutex vs. Suboxone.
    - Statement I is poorly framed. The naloxone component is a safety feature to deter misuse, not something that makes the drug "less safe" in a general sense.
    - Statement II is correct. Subutex (buprenorphine alone) is preferred in specific populations like pregnant women.
    - Statement III is correct. When taken as prescribed, their safety profiles are similar because the naloxone in Suboxone has poor sublingual bioavailability.
    - Statement IV is incorrect. The relative safety and pharmacology are well-understood.
    - Statement V is correct. It accurately describes that safety is context-dependent on the route of administration.

    Therefore, the correct statements are II, III, and V.
