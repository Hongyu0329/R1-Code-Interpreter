# This script calculates the count of correct statements based on the analysis.
# A value of 1 is assigned to a correct statement and 0 to an incorrect one.

# Correctness value for statement A
is_A_correct = 1

# Correctness value for statement B
is_B_correct = 0

# Correctness value for statement C
is_C_correct = 1

# Correctness value for statement D
is_D_correct = 0

# Correctness value for statement E
is_E_correct = 1

# The total count is the sum of the correctness values.
# The final equation is the sum of these values.
total_count = is_A_correct + is_B_correct + is_C_correct + is_D_correct + is_E_correct

# As requested, here are the numbers in the final equation that leads to the result.
print(f"{is_A_correct} + {is_B_correct} + {is_C_correct} + {is_D_correct} + {is_E_correct} = {total_count}")

# The final answer is the total count of correct statements.
print(f"The total count of correct statements is: {total_count}")
