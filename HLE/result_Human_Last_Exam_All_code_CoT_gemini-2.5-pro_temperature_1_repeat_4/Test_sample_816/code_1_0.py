    # A. Marangoni Force
    print("\n[A] Marangoni Force:")
    print("  - This force arises from a gradient in surface tension. The flow goes from regions of low surface tension to high surface tension.")
    print(f"  - For {material}, surface-active elements (like sulfur) cause the surface tension to be highest at the hot center of the pool.")
    print("  - This high central surface tension pulls the liquid from the cooler outer edges INWARDS.")
    print("  - Verdict: This matches the observation.")

    # B. Arc drag Force
    print("\n[B] Arc drag Force:")
    print("  - This is a shear force from the plasma jet that pushes liquid radially OUTWARDS from the center.")
    print("  - Verdict: This contradicts the observation.")

    # C. Arc Pressure Force
    print("\n[C] Arc Pressure Force:")
    print("  - This is a downward pressure that depresses the pool's center. It is not the primary driver of radial surface flow.")
    print("  - Verdict: Does not explain the inward flow pattern.")

    # D. Lorentz (electromagnetic) Force
    print("\n[D] Lorentz Force:")
    print("  - This force 'pinches' the weld pool inwards and downwards. While it contributes to inward flow within the pool's volume, the Marangoni force is the dominant mechanism for reversing the *surface* flow.")
    print("  - Verdict: A contributing factor, but not the primary cause of the observed surface phenomenon.")

    # E. Buoyancy Force
    print("\n[E] Buoyancy Force:")
    print("  - This force is caused by density variations and is generally much weaker than the Marangoni force in driving surface flow in welding.")
    print("  - Verdict: Not the dominant mechanism.")

    print("-" * 30)
    print("Conclusion: The inward flow is a classic example of the Marangoni effect in steels with surface-active elements.")
