    "My plan is to analyze each classical ballet step provided in the answer choices to determine if its standard execution ends with the legs in the same position they started in. I will create a Python script to formalize this analysis. The script will store the definitions of each step's positional change, iterate through them to find the one that meets the condition (ending position is the same as the starting position), and then print the name of that step as the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one ends in the same\n    leg position as it started.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary to store information about each ballet step.\n    # The 'position_changed' key indicates whether the feet have switched places\n    # (e.g., from right-foot-front to left-foot-front).\n    steps = {\n        'A.
