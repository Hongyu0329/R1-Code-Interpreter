    "Here is my plan to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler:\n\n1.  I will compile a list of some of Lady Butler's most famous war paintings.\n2.  For each painting, I will identify the specific battle or military event it portrays.\n3.  I will find the historical year in which each of these events occurred.\n4.  Finally, I will compare all the years to find the one that is the most recent.\n\nI will use a Python script to manage this data and perform the comparison. The script will store the paintings and their corresponding event years in a dictionary. It will then iterate through this data to find the maximum year and print the associated battle.\n\n```python\ndef find_latest_battle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the latest historical battle depicted in a selection\n    of Lady Butler's paintings.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping painting titles to the year of the event they depict.\n    # The key is the painting, and the value is the year.\n    battles_by_painting = {\n        \"The Roll Call\": 1854,\n        \"Quatre Bras\": 1815,\n        \"The Defence of Rorke's Drift\": 1879,\n        \"Scotland for Ever!\": 1815,\n        \"The Remnants of an Army\": 1842,\n        \"Floreat Etona!\": 1881,\n        \"The Camel Corps\": 1885\n    }\n\n    # A helper dictionary to map painting titles to the specific battle name.\n    battle_names = {\n        \"The Roll Call\": \"Battle of Inkerman\",\n        \"Quatre Bras\": \"Battle of Quatre Bras\",\n        \"The Defence of Rorke's Drift\": \"Battle of Rorke's Drift\",\n        \"Scotland for Ever!\": \"Battle of Waterloo\",\n        \"The Remnants of an Army\": \"Retreat from Kabul\",\n        \"Floreat Etona!\": \"Battle of Laing's Nek\",\n        \"The Camel Corps\": \"Nile Expedition\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Comparing the years of events depicted in Lady Butler's paintings:\")\n    all_years = []\n    for painting, year in battles_by_painting.items():\n        print(f\"- '{painting}' depicts an event from {year}\")\n        all_years.append(year)\n\n    # Find the latest year from the dictionary values\n    latest_year = max(battles_by_painting.values())\n\n    # Find the painting(s) associated with that year\n    latest_painting = \"\"\n    for painting, year in battles_by_painting.items():\n        if year == latest_year:\n            latest_painting = painting\n            break  # Stop after finding the first match\n\n    latest_battle = battle_names[latest_painting]\n\n    # Display the final calculation as requested\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    # The 'equation' is finding the maximum value among the years.\n    equation_str = f\"max({', '.join(map(str, sorted(list(set(all_years)))))}) = {latest_year}\"\n    print(equation_str)\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe latest battle depicted is the {latest_battle}, which took place in {latest_year}.\")\n\nfind_latest_battle()\n```\n<<<Nile Expedition>>>"
