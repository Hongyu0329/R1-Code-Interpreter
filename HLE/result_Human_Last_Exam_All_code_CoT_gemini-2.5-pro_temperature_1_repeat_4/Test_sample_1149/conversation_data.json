    "Based on anatomical descriptions from paleontological studies, the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri* is subdivided by a ridge into two portions: an anterodorsal portion and a posteroventral portion. Each of these portions contains a single large pneumatic foramen, which is a type of depression.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that reflects this anatomical fact. I will assign a variable for the number of depressions in each portion and then add them together to find the total. The script will then print out the equation and the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Based on paleontological descriptions, the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri\n# is divided into two main portions.\nanterodorsal_portion_depressions = 1\nposteroventral_portion_depressions = 1\n\n# The total number of depressions is the sum of the depressions in each portion.\ntotal_depressions = anterodorsal_portion_depressions + posteroventral_portion_depressions\n\nprint(\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains a depression in its anterodorsal portion and another in its posteroventral portion.\")\nprint(\"To find the total number of depressions, we add the number from each portion:\")\nprint(f\"{anterodorsal_portion_depressions} + {posteroventral_portion_depressions} = {total_depressions}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThus, the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {total_depressions} depressions.\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
