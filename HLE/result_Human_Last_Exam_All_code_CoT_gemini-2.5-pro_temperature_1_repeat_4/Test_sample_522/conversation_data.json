    "The user wants me to find the `MISSING` value in a pattern-based puzzle.\n\n### Step-by-step derivation of the rule:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structure**: The inputs and outputs are comma-separated strings. It's helpful to visualize them as 2D grids of characters (digits).\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Change**: In both `Case A` and `Case B`, the central action is the \"movement\" of the digit '2'.\n    *   A cell that initially contains '2' becomes '0'.\n    *   A cell that initially contains '0' becomes '2'.\n    *   All other cells remain unchanged.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Movement in Case A**:\n    *   Input Grid:\n        ```\n        0 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 2 1 1 1 1\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   The '2' is at position `(row=1, col=1)`.\n    *   Output Grid:\n        ```\n        2 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   The '2' moves from `(1, 1)` to `(0, 0)`. The original location `(1, 1)` becomes '0'. The destination `(0, 0)` was originally '0'. The move is diagonal.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Movement in Case B**:\n    *   Input Grid (relevant part):\n        ```\n        ...000...  (row 2)\n        ...021...  (row 3)\n        ...111...  (row 4)\n        ```\n    *   The '2' is at `(3, 6)`.\n    *   Output Grid (relevant part):\n        ```\n        ...021...  (row 2, after change)\n        ...001...  (row 3, after change)\n        ...111...  (row 4)\n        ```\n    *   The '2' moves from `(3, 6)` to `(2, 7)`. The original location `(3, 6)` becomes '0'. The destination `(2, 7)` was originally '0'. This move is also diagonal.\n\n5.  **Formulate a Hypothesis**: The '2' moves to an adjacent diagonal cell that contains a '0'.\n\n6.  **Address Ambiguity (Tie-breaking)**: In `Case B`, the '2' at `(3, 6)` has two diagonal neighbors that are '0': `(2, 5)` and `(2, 7)`. The puzzle output shows the move is to `(2, 7)`. This implies a specific priority order for choosing the destination. Let's test a fixed search order for the diagonal directions:\n    *   Order 1 (e.g., Top-Left, Top-Right, ...): `(2, 5)` would be found before `(2, 7)`. This is incorrect.\n    *   Let's try a different order. How about starting from the bottom-right and going counter-clockwise?\n        1.  Bottom-Right `(r+1, c+1)`\n        2.  Bottom-Left `(r+1, c-1)`\n        3.  Top-Right `(r-1, c+1)`\n        4.  Top-Left `(r-1, c-1)`\n\n7.  **Test the Tie-breaking Rule**:\n    *   **Case A**: '2' at `(1, 1)`.\n        1.  `BR (2, 2)` -> is '1'.\n        2.  `BL (2, 0)` -> is '1'.\n        3.  `TR (0, 2)` -> is '1'.\n        4.  `TL (0, 0)` -> is '0'. **Match!** The move is to `(0, 0)`. This is correct.\n    *   **Case B**: '2' at `(3, 6)`.\n        1.  `BR (4, 7)` -> is '1'.\n        2.  `BL (4, 5)` -> is '1'.\n        3.  `TR (2, 7)` -> is '0'. **Match!** The move is to `(2, 7)`. This is correct.\n\n8.  **Final Rule**: The '2' moves to the first available '0' found by checking its diagonal neighbors in the order: Bottom-Right, Bottom-Left, Top-Right, Top-Left. The original position of the '2' becomes '0'.\n\n9.  **Apply the Rule to Input_C**:\n    *   Input_C Grid:\n        ```\n        0 0 0 0 0 0\n        0 1 1 1 2 0\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   The '2' is at `(1, 4)`.\n    *   Check diagonals in order:\n        1.  `BR (2, 5)` is '1'.\n        2.  `BL (2, 3)` is '1'.\n        3.  `TR (0, 5)` is '0'. **Match!**\n    *   The move is to `(0, 5)`.\n    *   The grid is transformed: `grid[1][4]` becomes '0', and `grid[0][5]` becomes '2'.\n    *   New Grid:\n        ```\n        0 0 0 0 0 2\n        0 1 1 1 0 0\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   The resulting string is `000002,011100,111111`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle by moving a '2' to a diagonal '0' based on a specific search order.\n    The rule is: The '2' moves to the first available '0' found by checking its\n    diagonal neighbors in the order: Bottom-Right, Bottom-Left, Top-Right, Top-Left.\n    The original position of the '2' becomes '0'.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_str = '000000,011120,111111'\n\n    # Parse the input string into a 2D list (grid) of characters.\n    grid_rows = input_str.split(',')\n    grid = [list(row) for row in grid_rows]\n    \n    rows = len(grid)\n    if rows == 0:\n        print(input_str)\n        return\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n\n    # Find the coordinates (r, c) of the '2'.\n    r2, c2 = -1, -1\n    found_2 = False\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == '2':\n                r2, c2 = r, c\n                found_2 = True\n                break\n        if found_2:\n            break\n\n    # If no '2' is found, the grid remains unchanged.\n    if not found_2:\n        print(input_str)\n        return\n\n    # Define the diagonal move search order: (dr, dc)\n    # 1.
