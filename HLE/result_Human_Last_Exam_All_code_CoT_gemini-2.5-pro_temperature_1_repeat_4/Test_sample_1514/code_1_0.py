    This function explains the reasoning and prints the final answer.

    Step 1: Understand the definition of the compactification. The problem states that the ray R = [0,1) must be a DENSE open subset of the compactification Y. The remainder is X = Y \ R.

    Step 2: Analyze the 'dense' property. If R is dense in Y, its closure cl(R) is Y. This means the remainder X is precisely the set of limit points of the ray, i.e., X = cl(R) \ R.

    Step 3: Apply a theorem from topology. The limit set of a path (like the ray R) in a metric space must be a connected set. Therefore, the remainder X must be connected.

    Step 4: Consider the properties of X. The problem states X is a nondegenerate, locally-connected, compact metric space. Combined with our finding that X must be connected, X is a Peano continuum.

    Step 5: Determine the number of compactifications. For a given Peano continuum X, a compactification where the ray is dense (i.e., its limit set is all of X) is unique up to homeomorphism. This is known as the maximal or universal compactification. This means for any valid choice of X, there is only one way to construct such a space Y.

    Step 6: Conclude the minimum number. Since the number of distinct compactifications for any valid X is 1, the smallest possible number is 1.
