    # The problem is set in the context of ZFC set theory.
    # We are given a cardinal kappa.

    # The problem asks for the order type of a set X.
    # X is the set of infinite cardinals mu for which a "free set" of size mu exists.
    # The cardinals in question are those less than or equal to kappa.
    # These are: omega_0, omega_1, ..., omega_7.

    # Step 1: Analyze the setup.
    # kappa = omega_7 is a successor cardinal: kappa = (omega_6)^+.
    # The given property about head tail weak Delta-systems is a strong "freeness"
    # or "non-saturation" property for the collection of sets D.

    # Step 2: Recall relevant theorems from combinatorial set theory.
    # For a successor cardinal kappa = lambda^+, strong freeness properties often
    # guarantee the existence of certain combinatorial objects (like our free sets)
    # for all cardinalities up to lambda, but the property may fail at kappa itself.
    # This is a common theme in the work of Shelah and others.

    # Step 3: Apply the principle to the specific problem.
    # Here, kappa = omega_7 and lambda = omega_6.
    # We can therefore expect that a free set exists for any infinite cardinal mu < omega_7.
    # The infinite cardinals mu < omega_7 are:
    # omega_0, omega_1, omega_2, omega_3, omega_4, omega_5, omega_6.

    # The existence of a free set of size omega_7 is not guaranteed.
    # Assuming the standard result for such problems, we conclude that
    # X = {omega_0, omega_1, omega_2, omega_3, omega_4, omega_5, omega_6}.

    # Step 4: Determine the order type of X.
    # The order type of a well-ordered set is its length.
    # We count the number of elements in the set X.
