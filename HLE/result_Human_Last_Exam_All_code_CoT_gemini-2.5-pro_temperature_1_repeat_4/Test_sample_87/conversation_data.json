    "An elegant explanation of your method and code should be provided.\n\nHere is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, we will use the given information and the chain rule for mutual information to find the value of $I(X;Z)$. The chain rule states that $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$ and also $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$. By equating these two expressions, we can solve for the unknown quantity $I(X;Z)$.\n2.  Next, we will find an expression for the target quantity $I(X;Y|W)$. Using the chain rule on the variables $(X, Y, W)$, we can derive the identity: $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n3.  The crucial part of the problem is that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This implies that the variables form a Markov chain $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$. The Data Processing Inequality (DPI) for such a chain provides bounds on the terms involving $W$.\n    *   $I(X;W) \\ge 0$, as mutual information is always non-negative.\n    *   $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$, which is a conditional version of the DPI.\n4.  Finally, to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we will substitute the extremal values for $I(X;W|Y)$ and $I(X;W)$ (as allowed by the DPI) into the expression derived in step 2. This involves maximizing $I(X;W|Y)$ and minimizing $I(X;W)$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Backup the standard output\nstdout_backup = sys.stdout\n# Redirect the standard output to a string\nsys.stdout = io.StringIO()\n\n# --- Start of the logic ---\n\n# Given values from the problem statement\nI_X_Y = 3\nI_X_Y_cond_Z = 2\nI_X_Z_cond_Y = 5\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Calculate I(X;Z) using the chain rule for mutual information.\")\n# The chain rule gives two expressions for I(X;Y,Z):\n# I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)\n# I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)\n# We can calculate I(X;Y,Z) from the first equation.\nI_X_YZ = I_X_Y + I_X_Z_cond_Y\nprint(f\"From I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y), we have:\")\nprint(f\"I(X;Y,Z) = {I_X_Y} + {I_X_Z_cond_Y} = {I_X_YZ}\")\n\n# Now, we use the second equation to solve for I(X;Z).\n# I_X_Z = I_X_YZ - I_X_Y_cond_Z\nI_X_Z = I_X_YZ - I_X_Y_cond_Z\nprint(f\"From I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z), we can find I(X;Z):\")\nprint(f\"I(X;Z) = I(X;Y,Z) - I(X;Y|Z) = {I_X_YZ} - {I_X_Y_cond_Z} = {I_X_Z}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nStep 2: Express I(X;Y|W) in terms of knowns and terms involving W.\")\n# By applying the chain rule to I(X;Y,W) in two ways, we get:\n# I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)\n# Rearranging this identity gives the expression for I(X;Y|W):\nprint(f\"The identity I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W) relates our target quantity to others.\")\nprint(f\"Substituting the known value I(X;Y) = {I_X_Y}, we get:\")\nprint(f\"I(X;Y|W) = {I_X_Y} + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)\")\n\nprint(\"\\nStep 3: Apply the Data Processing Inequality (DPI) to find bounds for terms with W.\")\n# Since W is a function of Z, we have a Markov chain (X,Y) -> Z -> W.\n# The DPI imposes constraints on the information W can have.\nmin_I_X_W = 0\nmax_I_X_W_cond_Y = I_X_Z_cond_Y\nprint(f\"Because W is a function of Z, we can apply the DPI:\")\nprint(f\"1.
