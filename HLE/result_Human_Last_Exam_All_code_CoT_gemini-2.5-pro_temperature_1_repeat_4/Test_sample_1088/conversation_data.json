    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a basis set is not a single value; it depends on the specific atoms in the molecule. The notation \"6-311G**\" tells us how to calculate this number for each type of atom.\n\nHere is the plan to answer your question:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name (6-311G**):**\n    *   **6-311G**: This describes the core and valence orbitals.\n        *   **Core orbitals** (like 1s in Carbon): Represented by 1 function contracted from **6** primitive Gaussians.\n        *   **Valence orbitals**: Are \"triple-split\". They are represented by three functions, contracted from **3**, **1**, and **1** primitive Gaussians, respectively.\n    *   **\\*\\***: This indicates the addition of polarization functions.\n        *   The first `*` adds one set of **d-type** polarization functions to \"heavy\" atoms (any atom other than Hydrogen). A standard set consists of 6 d-functions.\n        *   The second `*` adds one set of **p-type** polarization functions to Hydrogen atoms. A standard set consists of 3 p-functions.\n\n2.  **Calculate for Specific Atoms:**\n    *   We will calculate the number of primitives for a **Hydrogen** atom.\n    *   We will calculate the number of primitives for a **Carbon** atom (as a representative heavy atom).\n    *   Finally, to provide a single, concrete answer, we will calculate the total number of primitives for a simple, common molecule: **methane (CHâ‚„)**.\n\n3.  **Python Script:**\n    *   The script will perform the calculations as described above and print out each step of the summation clearly.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_primitives_for_6_311G_star_star():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G**\n    basis set for Hydrogen, Carbon, and a Methane molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Calculation for a Hydrogen (H) atom ---\")\n    # For H, the 1s orbital is valence.\n    # Valence 's' primitives from '311': 3 + 1 + 1 = 5\n    h_s_primitives = 3 + 1 + 1\n    # Polarization from the second '*' adds one set of p-functions (px, py, pz).\n    # Each is a single uncontracted primitive.
