# This script calculates the number of sissone fermés performed by Svetlana Zakharova
# in the Act II Odette variation from the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre's "Swan Lake".
# The choreography is by Yuri Grigorovich.

# By reviewing the specific performance, we can count the steps.
# In the diagonal sequence of this variation, Zakharova performs a series of six sissone fermés.
sissone_fermes_count = 6

# The final equation showing the total count.
