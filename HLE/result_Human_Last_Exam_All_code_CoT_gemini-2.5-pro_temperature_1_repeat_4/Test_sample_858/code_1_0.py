    # - Is it aposyndetic? Yes, vacuously true as there are no two distinct points.
    # - Is p a non-block point? Yes. X\{p} is the empty set, which is vacuously

    # - A known theorem states that for a non-degenerate aposyndetic continuum,
    #   the set of non-block points is a dense G-delta subset.
    # - By the Baire Category Theorem, such a set must be uncountable.
    #   The cardinality is 2^{\aleph_0}.
    # We represent this as a conceptually larger number than the first case.
