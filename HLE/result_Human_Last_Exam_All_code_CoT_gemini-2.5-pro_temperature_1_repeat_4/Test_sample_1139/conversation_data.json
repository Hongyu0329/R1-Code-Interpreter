    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimension of the bosonic part of the target manifold for the supersymmetric sigma-model in question. Here is a step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Manifold**: For disordered systems of symmetry class D, the target space of the `n`-replica supersymmetric sigma-model is the symmetric superspace `M = G/H`, where the supergroup `G = O(2n|2n)` and the subgroup is `H = O(n|n) x O(n|n)`. The variables of the model are coordinates on this space.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Calculation for Bosonic Variables**: The non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables correspond to the even (bosonic) part of this supermanifold, `M_B`. The number of these variables is its dimension, `dim(M_B)`. This dimension can be calculated by subtracting the dimension of the bosonic part of the subgroup from that of the group:\n    `dim(M_B) = dim_B(G) - dim_B(H)`.\n\n3.  **Use Dimension Formulas**: The bosonic part of an orthogonal supergroup `O(p|q)` is the direct product of two ordinary orthogonal groups, `O(p) x O(q)`. Its dimension is the sum of the dimensions of its factors:\n    `dim_B(O(p|q)) = dim(O(p)) + dim(O(q))`.\n    The dimension of an orthogonal group `O(m)` is given by the formula:\n    `dim(O(m)) = m * (m - 1) / 2`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation**: We are given `n = 2` replicas.\n    *   First, we calculate `dim_B(G)` for `G = O(2n|2n) = O(4|4)`.\n    *   Next, we calculate `dim_B(H)` for `H = O(n|n) x O(n|n) = O(2|2) x O(2|2)`. Note that `dim_B(H)` is twice the dimension of the bosonic part of a single `O(2|2)` factor.\n    *   Finally, we compute the difference to get our answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this step-by-step calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_variables():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassman variables for the supersymmetric sigma-model\n    with two replicas for disordered systems of symmetry class D.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of replicas\n    n = 2\n    print(f\"The number of replicas is n = {n}.\\n\")\n\n    # The target manifold is M = G/H where G = O(2n|2n) and H = O(n|n) x O(n|n).\n    # The number of bosonic variables is dim_B(M) = dim_B(G) - dim_B(H).\n\n    # Define a helper function for the dimension of an orthogonal group O(m)\n    def dim_O(m):\n        return m * (m - 1) // 2\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate the dimension of the bosonic part of G = O(2n|2n) ---\n    p_G = 2 * n\n    q_G = 2 * n\n    print(f\"The supergroup is G = O({p_G}|{q_G}).\")\n    \n    # dim_B(G) = dim(O(2n)) + dim(O(2n))\n    dim_O_pG = dim_O(p_G)\n    dim_O_qG = dim_O(q_G)\n    dim_b_G = dim_O_pG + dim_O_qG\n    \n    print(f\"The dimension of its bosonic part is dim_B(G) = dim(O({p_G})) + dim(O({q_G})) = {dim_O_pG} + {dim_O_qG} = {dim_b_G}.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate the dimension of the bosonic part of H = O(n|n) x O(n|n) ---\n    p_H_factor = n\n    q_H_factor = n\n    print(f\"The subgroup is H = O({p_H_factor}|{q_H_factor}) x O({p_H_factor}|{q_H_factor}).\")\n\n    # First, find the dimension for a single O(n|n) factor\n    # dim_B(O(n|n)) = dim(O(n)) + dim(O(n))\n    dim_O_pH_factor = dim_O(p_H_factor)\n    dim_O_qH_factor = dim_O(q_H_factor)\n    dim_b_H_factor = dim_O_pH_factor + dim_O_qH_factor\n    \n    # The total dimension for H is twice the dimension of one factor\n    dim_b_H = 2 * dim_b_H_factor\n    \n    print(f\"The dimension of the bosonic part of one O({p_H_factor}|{q_H_factor}) factor is dim(O({p_H_factor})) + dim(O({q_H_factor})) = {dim_O_pH_factor} + {dim_O_qH_factor} = {dim_b_H_factor}.\")\n    print(f\"The total dimension of the bosonic part of H is 2 * {dim_b_H_factor} = {dim_b_H}.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate the final result ---\n    num_variables = dim_b_G - dim_b_H\n    \n    print(\"The number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables is the difference:\")\n    print(f\"Result = dim_B(G) - dim_B(H) = {dim_b_G} - {dim_b_H} = {num_variables}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_variables()\n```\n<<<8>>>"
