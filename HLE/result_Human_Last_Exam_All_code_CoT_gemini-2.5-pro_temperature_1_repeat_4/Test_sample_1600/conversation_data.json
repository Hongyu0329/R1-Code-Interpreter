    "To find the value of a(3), we first need to understand what this term represents. In quantum electrodynamics (QED), `a(n)` refers to the total number of distinct, non-vanishing, one-particle-irreducible (1PI) Feynman diagrams at `n` loops (which corresponds to order `2n` in the fine-structure constant) for the self-energies of the fundamental particles.\n\nThe problem asks for `a(3)`, which is the number of diagrams at 3 loops (order `2*3 = 6`). The phrase \"electron or the photon propagators\" indicates that we need to consider the self-energy diagrams for both the electron and the photon.\n\nThe total number `a(3)` is the sum of:\n1.  The number of 3-loop diagrams for the electron self-energy.\n2.  The number of 3-loop diagrams for the photon self-energy (also known as vacuum polarization).\n\nFrom the literature on QED calculations, these numbers are known:\n-   Number of 3-loop diagrams for the electron self-energy = 7\n-   Number of 3-loop diagrams for the photon self-energy = 3\n\nTherefore, `a(3)` is the sum of these two values.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and displays this result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_feynman_diagrams_a3():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(3), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 6\n    for electron or photon propagators in QED.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # At 3 loops (order 6), the number of 1-particle-irreducible (1PI) diagrams\n    # for the electron self-energy is 7.\n    num_electron_diagrams = 7\n    \n    # At 3 loops (order 6), the number of 1PI diagrams\n    # for the photon self-energy (vacuum polarization) is 3.\n    num_photon_diagrams = 3\n    \n    # a(3) is the sum of the diagrams for both propagators.\n    a3 = num_electron_diagrams + num_photon_diagrams\n    \n    print(f\"The value a(n) represents the total number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron and photon propagators.\")\n    print(f\"We need to find a(3), which corresponds to the diagrams of order 2*3 = 6 (3 loops).\")\n    print(f\"This is the sum of the diagrams for the electron propagator and the photon propagator.\")\n    print(f\"\\nNumber of diagrams for electron propagator at 3 loops = {num_electron_diagrams}\")\n    print(f\"Number of diagrams for photon propagator at 3 loops = {num_photon_diagrams}\")\n    \n    # Print the final equation showing all numbers\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, a(3) = {num_electron_diagrams} + {num_photon_diagrams} = {a3}\")\n\ncalculate_feynman_diagrams_a3()\n```\n<<<10>>>"
