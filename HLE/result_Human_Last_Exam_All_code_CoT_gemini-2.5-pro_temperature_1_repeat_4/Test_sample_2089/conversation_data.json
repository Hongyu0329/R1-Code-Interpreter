    "My plan is to identify the film based on the specific scene described. The scene in question is from the critically acclaimed and Oscar-nominated film *The Shawshank Redemption*. The character is Brooks Hatlen, the elderly prison librarian who is paroled after 50 years. He finds the outside world terrifying and alienating. The bus scene, where he politely says \"Thank you\" to the driver, is a poignant moment that underscores his institutionalization and inability to cope, which ultimately leads to his tragic decision.\n\nI will provide a Python script to print the name of the film.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the name of the film that matches the user's description.\nfilm_title = \"The Shawshank Redemption\"\nprint(f\"The film is: {film_title}\")\n```\n<<<The Shawshank Redemption>>>"

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
