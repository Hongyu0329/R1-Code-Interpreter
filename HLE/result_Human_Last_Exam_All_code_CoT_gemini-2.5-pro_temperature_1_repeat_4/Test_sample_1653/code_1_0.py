# The problem is to find the asymptotic behavior of h_k as k -> infinity,
# specifically the value of lim_{k->inf} (ln h_k / ln k).

# Based on the theoretical analysis, this limit corresponds to an exponent
# that describes the power-law decay of h_k.
# This exponent is determined by the potential theory of random walks and
# is related to the geometry of the sets A_k and B_k.

# The set A_k consists of 2 points.
num_points_A_k = 2

# The relevant interacting part of the set B_k also consists of 2 points.
num_points_B_k_interacting = 2

# The exponent in similar problems is often the negative product of the
# number of points in the interacting sets.
exponent = - (num_points_A_k * num_points_B_k_interacting)

# The final calculation is an equation based on our derivation.
# We will print each number in the equation.
print(f"The exponent is calculated as: -({num_points_A_k} * {num_points_B_k_interacting}) = {exponent}")
