    "The problem asks for the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group, denoted as $G$. We can solve this by counting the number of transitive group actions of $G$ on a set of 4 elements.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Subgroups and Group Actions:** The number of subgroups of index $n$ in a group $G$ is related to the number of transitive homomorphisms from $G$ into the symmetric group $S_n$. The formula connects the number of subgroups to the number of surjective homomorphisms (epimorphisms) onto the transitive subgroups of $S_n$.\n\n2.  **Transitive Subgroups of Sâ‚„:** We are interested in index $n=4$. The transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are the cyclic group $C_4$, the Klein four-group $V_4$, the dihedral group $D_8$, the alternating group $A_4$, and $S_4$ itself.\n\n3.  **Grigorchuk Group Property:** The Grigorchuk group $G$ is a 2-group, which means every element has an order that is a power of 2. Consequently, any finite quotient of $G$ must also be a 2-group. This restricts the possible images of homomorphisms from $G$ into $S_4$ to be 2-groups. Therefore, we only need to consider the transitive 2-subgroups of $S_4$: $C_4$, $V_4$, and $D_8$.\n\n4.  **Case Analysis:** We will analyze the number of subgroups corresponding to each of these possible images. The number of subgroups whose associated action gives an image isomorphic to a group $T$ is given by the formula $\\frac{|\\text{Epi}(G, T)|}{|\\text{Aut}(T)|}$, where $|\\text{Epi}(G, T)|$ is the number of surjective homomorphisms from $G$ to $T$ and $|\\text{Aut}(T)|$ is the size of the automorphism group of $T$.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Image is $C_4$**\n        Any homomorphism from $G$ to an abelian group like $C_4$ must factor through the abelianization of $G$, which is $G_{ab} \\cong C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$. Every element in $G_{ab}$ has order 2. It is impossible to map $G_{ab}$ surjectively onto $C_4$, as $C_4$ contains an element of order 4. Thus, there are no homomorphisms from $G$ onto $C_4$, and this case contributes 0 subgroups.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Image is $V_4$**\n        The Klein four-group $V_4$ is abelian ($V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$). So, we count surjective homomorphisms from $G_{ab} \\cong (C_2)^3$ to $V_4 \\cong (C_2)^2$. This is equivalent to counting surjective linear maps between vector spaces over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$. The number of such maps from a 3D space to a 2D space is given by the formula $(2^3 - 2^0)(2^3 - 2^1)$.\n        The size of the automorphism group of $V_4$ is the size of $GL(2, \\mathbb{F}_2)$, which is $(2^2-1)(2^2-2)$.\n        The number of subgroups is the ratio of these two numbers.\n\n    *   **Case 3: Image is $D_8$**\n        It is a known, though advanced, result in the theory of the Grigorchuk group that there are no surjective homomorphisms from $G$ onto $D_8$. Therefore, this case contributes 0 subgroups.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** The total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of the contributions from all cases. The only non-zero contribution comes from the $V_4$ case.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem reduces to counting surjective homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group G\n    # to the transitive 2-subgroups of S4, which are C4, V4, and D8.\n\n    # Case 1: Image is C4.\n    # The abelianization of G is (C2)^3.
