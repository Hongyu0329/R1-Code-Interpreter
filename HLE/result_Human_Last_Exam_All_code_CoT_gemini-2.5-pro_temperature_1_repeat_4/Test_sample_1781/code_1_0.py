# The historical monarch in question is Philip II of France.
# His reign marked a shift from the title "King of the Franks" to "King of France,"
# reflecting a move from a personal to a territorial concept of kingship.

# The year of the first documented use of the new title was 1190.
# The year Philip II's reign ended was 1223.

# The biographer who gave Philip the epithet "Augustus" and explained its origin
# (from the Latin 'augere', to increase) was the monk Rigord.

# Examining the choices, option C pairs the correct biographer (Rigord)
# with a significant year from Philip II's life (the year of his death, 1223).
# This is the most accurate pairing available in the options.

year = 1223
biographer = "Rigord"
