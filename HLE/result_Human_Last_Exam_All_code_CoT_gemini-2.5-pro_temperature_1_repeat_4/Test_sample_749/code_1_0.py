    # Step 1: Analyze the population growth.
    # The number of offspring for any particle is 1 with probability (1-h) and 2 with probability h.
    # The expected number of offspring is 1*(1-h) + 2*h = 1+h.
    # Since h > 0, the process is supercritical. The number of particles almost surely goes to infinity.
    # So, the question is whether this infinite population visits site 0 infinitely often.

    # Step 2: Analyze the population's movement.
    # The event E (infinitely many particles visit site 0) can only occur if the particle cloud
    # does not systematically drift away from 0.
    # For a BRWRE, if the underlying random walk in a random environment (RWRE) is transient,
    # the entire particle cloud will drift in the direction of transience.
    # If the minimum position of the particles m_n -> +infinity, then site 0 is visited only finitely many times.

    # Step 3: Determine the condition for transience for the RWRE.
    # Transience is determined by the sign of E[log(rho)], where rho = p_right / p_left.
    # The expectation is taken over the random environment (the color of the sites).

    # Define jump probabilities and the ratio rho for each color.
