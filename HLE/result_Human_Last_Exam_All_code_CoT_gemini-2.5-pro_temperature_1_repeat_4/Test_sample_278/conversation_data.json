    "To find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure, we first need to determine the figure's bounding box. This involves finding the minimum and maximum values for `x` and `y`.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the parametric equations:** The curve is defined in two parts.\n    *   For `t` in `[0, π]`: `x = cos(t)` and `y = sin(t)`. This traces the upper half of a unit circle. Here, `x` ranges from -1 to 1, and `y` ranges from 0 to 1.\n    *   For `t` in `(π, 2π)`: `x = cos(t)` and `y = 5sin(t)`. This traces the lower half of an ellipse. Here, `x` ranges from -1 to 1, and `y` ranges from -5 to 0.\n\n2.  **Find the overall range for x and y:**\n    *   Combining both parts, the `x` values range from `min(-1, -1) = -1` to `max(1, 1) = 1`.\n    *   Combining both parts, the `y` values range from `min(0, -5) = -5` to `max(1, 0) = 1`.\n\n3.  **Determine the dimensions of the bounding box:**\n    *   The width of the figure is `x_max - x_min = 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n    *   The height of the figure is `y_max - y_min = 1 - (-5) = 6`.\n\n4.  **Find the side length of the smallest enclosing square:** For a square to enclose this rectangular bounding box, its side length must be at least as large as the longest side of the rectangle.\n    *   Side of square = `max(width, height) = max(2, 6) = 6`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the area of the square:**\n    *   Area = `side * side = 6 * 6 = 36`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the boundaries for x and y\n# For t in [0, pi], x=cos(t) and y=sin(t).\n# x ranges from cos(pi)=-1 to cos(0)=1.\n# y ranges from sin(0)=0 to sin(pi/2)=1.\nx_max_1 = 1\nx_min_1 = -1\ny_max_1 = 1\ny_min_1 = 0\n\n# For t in (pi, 2pi), x=cos(t) and y=5*sin(t).\n# x ranges from cos(pi)=-1 to cos(2pi)=1.\n# y ranges from 5*sin(3pi/2)=-5 to a value approaching 5*sin(2pi)=0.\nx_max_2 = 1\nx_min_2 = -1\ny_max_2 = 0\ny_min_2 = -5\n\n# Find the overall min and max values for the entire figure\nx_max = max(x_max_1, x_max_2)\nx_min = min(x_min_1, x_min_2)\ny_max = max(y_max_1, y_max_2)\ny_min = min(y_min_1, y_min_2)\n\n# Calculate the width and height of the bounding box\nwidth = x_max - x_min\nheight = y_max - y_min\n\n# The side of the smallest enclosing square is the max of width and height\nside_length = max(width, height)\n\n# Calculate the area of the square\narea = side_length ** 2\n\nprint(f\"The bounding box of the figure has:\")\nprint(f\"Width = {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}\")\nprint(f\"Height = {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe side of the smallest enclosing square must be the larger of these two dimensions, which is {side_length}.\")\nprint(f\"The area of this square is {int(side_length)} * {int(side_length)} = {int(area)}.\")\n\n```\n<<<36>>>"
