    "To solve this, I will simulate a one-dimensional cellular automaton following Rule 110.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Define Rule 110**: Rule 110 determines the next state of a cell based on its current state and the states of its left and right neighbors. The rule can be represented as a mapping from the 8 possible 3-cell neighborhood patterns to an output state (0 or 1). The number 110 in binary is `01101110`, which defines these outputs.\n2.  **Initialize the Grid**: I'll create a one-dimensional grid (a list of 0s and 1s) that is wide enough to contain the pattern's growth over 20 steps. The simulation will start with a single cell in state 1 at the center of this grid, with all other cells in state 0.\n3.  **Simulate Generations**: I will loop 20 times, representing the 20 applications of the rule. In each iteration, I'll calculate the next state of every cell simultaneously by applying Rule 110 to its neighborhood and store the results in a new grid. This new grid then becomes the current grid for the next iteration.\n4.  **Format the Output**: After 20 iterations, the simulation is complete. I will take the final grid, trim any leading or trailing zeros to show only the active part of the pattern, and print the resulting binary sequence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rule_110():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates Rule 110 for 20 steps starting from a single '1' cell\n    and prints the final binary pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of steps (generations) to simulate\n    steps = 20\n\n    # The width of the grid must be large enough to prevent edge effects.\n    # The pattern can grow by one cell on each side per step.\n    # A safe width is 1 (initial cell) + 2 * steps + some padding.\n    width = 2 * steps + 41  # Total width of 81\n\n    # Rule 110 mapping.
