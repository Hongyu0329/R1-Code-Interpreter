    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Combine Integrals:** The two integrals in the expression share the same denominator. We can combine them into a single integral.\n2.  **Substitution:** Apply a variable substitution, $u = 1-x$, to simplify the resulting integral.\n3.  **Find Antiderivative:** The simplified integral has a form that is the derivative of a simpler function. By finding this antiderivative, we can easily evaluate the definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n4.  **Evaluate:** Calculate the value of the definite integral over the bounds from 0 to 1.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the value of the integral back into the main expression and compute the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan and shows the calculation steps.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the value of the mathematical expression\n    (12)^4 * (Integral_1 - Integral_2)^4\n    step-by-step and prints the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The problem is to compute: (12)^4 * (I_1 - I_2)^4\")\n    print(\"where I_1 = integral from 0 to 1 of ((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) / (3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^(3/4) dx\")\n    print(\"and   I_2 = integral from 0 to 1 of x / (3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^(3/4) dx\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Combine the two integrals\n    print(\"Step 1: Combine the two integrals.\")\n    print(\"Let I = I_1 - I_2.
