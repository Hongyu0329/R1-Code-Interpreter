    # Option A
    print("A. Lay down the person and elevate legs along with CPR")
    print("   - Analysis: Incorrect. CPR is for cardiac arrest (no pulse). This patient has a very fast pulse and performing CPR would be harmful.")

    # Option B
    print("\nB. Administer anticlotting medicine such as aspirin or heparin")
    print("   - Analysis: Incorrect. The patient is bleeding uncontrollably. Anticoagulants would prevent clotting and accelerate death.")

    # Option C
    print("\nC. Intravenous resuscitation of normal saline or Ringer's lactate")
    print("   - Analysis: Correct. This is the immediate first-line treatment for hemorrhagic shock. The goal is to rapidly restore blood volume with isotonic crystalloid fluids to improve blood pressure and organ perfusion. This option is comprehensive and standard of care.")

    # Option D
    print("\nD. Intravenous resuscitation of normal saline")
    print("   - Analysis: Partially correct, but less optimal than C. Normal saline is an acceptable fluid, but option C is a more complete answer as it also includes Ringer's lactate, which is another primary choice.")

    # Option E
    print("\nE. Intravenous resuscitation of normal saline with fructose")
    print("   - Analysis: Incorrect. Sugar-containing solutions are not used for initial volume resuscitation as they are less effective at expanding plasma volume and can cause harmful hyperglycemia.\n")

    print("The most critical initial action is aggressive fluid resuscitation to counteract the shock. Therefore, option C is the best and most complete answer.")
