    # Step 1: Identify the chord played during the final word "you".
    # The problem states a consistent pattern: an m7 chord on the word, and a 7(9) chord on the pause.
    # The final chord pair for "...to you" is Bm7 and E7(9).
    final_word_chord_name = "Bm7"
    print(f"The final word 'you' is sung over the {final_word_chord_name} chord.")

    # Step 2: Determine the musical key implied by the chord progression at that moment.
    # The progression Bm7 -> E7(9) is a ii-V progression.
    # This progression strongly implies the key of A Major.
    implied_key = "A Major"
    print(f"The chords {final_word_chord_name} and E7(9) form a ii-V progression, implying a temporary key of {implied_key}.")

    # Step 3: Identify the typical melody note for the end of the song.

    # The tonic of A Major is the note A.
    melody_note = "A"
    print(f"The melody of 'Happy Birthday' typically ends on the tonic of the key, which is '{melody_note}'.")

    # Step 4: Verify that the melody note fits within the chord.

    # Final Conclusion
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print(f"The note sung on the final word 'you' is the tonic of the implied key ({implied_key}), which is '{melody_note}'.")
    print(f"This note is also the minor 7th of the {final_word_chord_name} chord, making it a perfect harmonic fit.")
