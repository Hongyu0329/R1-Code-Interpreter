# Step 1: Define the given parameters from the problem description.
# The height H is given as 350g meters.
# Let's represent H as a product of 350 and a variable 'g'.
H_coeff = 350

# Step 2: State the derived constant acceleration.
# Through the physical analysis described in the plan, the acceleration 'a' of the
# raindrop is found to be constant and equal to g/7.
# a = g / 7
a_fraction_numerator = 1
a_fraction_denominator = 7

# Step 3: Set up the kinematic equation for an object falling from rest.
# The equation is H = (1/2) * a * t^2.
# We substitute the expressions for H and a:
# 350 * g = (1/2) * (g / 7) * t^2

# We can see that 'g' cancels from both sides of the equation:
# 350 = (1/2) * (1 / 7) * t^2
# 350 = 1/14 * t^2

# Step 4: Solve for t^2.
# t^2 = 350 * 14
t_squared = H_coeff * 2 * a_fraction_denominator

# Step 5: Solve for t by taking the square root.
t = math.sqrt(t_squared)

# Step 6: Print the final calculation step-by-step.
print("The final equation to solve for the time 't' is derived from H = (1/2) * a * t^2.")
print(f"Substituting H = {H_coeff}*g and a = g/{a_fraction_denominator}:")
print(f"{H_coeff} * g = (1/2) * (g / {a_fraction_denominator}) * t^2")
print("The variable 'g' cancels from both sides, simplifying the equation to:")
print(f"{H_coeff} = (1 / {2 * a_fraction_denominator}) * t^2")
print(f"Solving for t^2:")
print(f"t^2 = {H_coeff} * {2 * a_fraction_denominator}")
print(f"t^2 = {int(t_squared)}")
print(f"Solving for t:")
print(f"t = sqrt({int(t_squared)})")
print(f"t = {int(t)} seconds")

# The final answer is the numerical value of t.
# The expression of the answer in terms of g, rho, and Rho is that
# the final time is independent of these quantities due to cancellations
# during the derivation. The time is given by the formula t = sqrt(14*H/g),
# and since H is given as 350g, the 'g' cancels out.
