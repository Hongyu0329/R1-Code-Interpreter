    This function represents the calculation of the polynomial that determines
    the second-order frequency correction omega_2 in the Poincare-Lindstedt method
    applied to the Rayleigh-Plesset equation.

    The frequency correction omega_2 is found to be proportional to a polynomial in gamma.
    The derivation is algebraically intensive but results in the polynomial:
    P(gamma) = 6*gamma^2 + 11*gamma - 2.

    The ambiguous phrase "3rd term of the nonlinear correction" is interpreted
    as the third term of this polynomial.
