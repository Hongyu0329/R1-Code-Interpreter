    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe scene you are describing is from the 1985 horror film *A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge*. In the movie, the character Lisa Webber is riding her pink bicycle down the middle of the street when a car approaches. She continues to pedal directly toward the car, forcing the driver to swerve at the last moment to avoid a collision.\n\nHere is a Python script that will print the name of the film.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the name of the movie that features the described scene.\nmovie_title = \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\"\nprint(movie_title)\n```\n<<<A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio does a teenager ride a pink bike and pedal directly toward an oncoming car?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
