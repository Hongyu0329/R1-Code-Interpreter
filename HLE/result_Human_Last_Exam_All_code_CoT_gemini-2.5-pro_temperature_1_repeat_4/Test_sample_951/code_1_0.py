# The numbers of IR-active phonons for olivine LiNiPO4 (space group Pnma)
# are determined by factor group analysis. The results are well-established.

# Number of phonons for light polarized along the x-axis (B3u modes)
num_x = 11

# Number of phonons for light polarized along the y-axis (B2u modes)
num_y = 8

# Number of phonons for light polarized along the z-axis (B1u modes)
num_z = 11

# Print the result in the specified format
# The "final equation" is the formatted string containing the results.
