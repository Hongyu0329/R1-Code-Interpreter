    print("2. Let's analyze the key assumptions:")
    print("   - Homogeneity: Assumes studies for a given comparison (e.g., A vs B) are similar enough to be pooled. This is necessary for any meta-analysis, but it doesn't guarantee that the A vs B studies are comparable to the B vs C studies.")
    print("   - Transitivity: Assumes that an indirect comparison is valid. For example, if we have studies of A vs B and B vs C, we can infer about A vs C. This is the core conceptual basis of NMA. However, this assumption is invalid if the studies themselves cannot be pooled due to heterogeneity.")
    print("   - Consistency: Assumes that direct evidence (from A vs C studies) and indirect evidence (from A vs B + B vs C studies) agree. This is a consequence of the other assumptions holding true, not a root assumption itself. If there is no direct evidence for a comparison, consistency cannot even be checked.")
    print("\n3. Conclusion: The validity of an NMA depends on a chain of assumptions working together.")
    print("   - You need HOMOGENEITY to combine individual studies.")
    print("   - You need TRANSITIVITY to combine different comparisons.")
    print("   - You hope to find CONSISTENCY as a result, which confirms the validity of the other assumptions.")
    print("\n4. Therefore, no single assumption is sufficient on its own. A valid NMA requires that multiple assumptions are met. This means option E is the correct choice.")
