    "This is a classic question in the mathematical field of point-set topology. The answer is a known result from a theorem by R. H. Bing, which states that any homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to one of a small, finite number of spaces.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that states this known mathematical result. The script will:\n1.  Define a list containing the names of the homeomorphism classes.\n2.  Calculate the total number of classes by finding the length of the list.\n3.  Print the total number and the names of each class.\n4.  Display the result as a simple summation to satisfy the \"output each number in the final equation\" requirement.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homogeneous_planar_continua():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents the solution to the mathematical problem regarding\n    the number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n    This is a known result from topology, not a dynamic computation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # According to a theorem by R. H. Bing, there are exactly four such classes.\n    classes = [\n        \"The point\",\n        \"The simple closed curve (circle)\",\n        \"The pseudo-arc\",\n        \"The circle of pseudo-arcs\"\n    ]\n\n    # The total number of classes is the length of this list.\n    total_classes = len(classes)\n\n    print(f\"There are {total_classes} homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\")\n    print(\"\\nThey are:\")\n    for i, desc in enumerate(classes, 1):\n        print(f\"{i}. {desc}\")\n\n    # To fulfill the requirement of showing an equation, we can represent\n    # the total as a sum of the individual classes.\n    print(\"\\nThe final count can be represented by the equation:\")\n    sum_representation = \" + \".join([\"1\"] * total_classes)\n    print(f\"{sum_representation} = {total_classes}\")\n\nsolve_homogeneous_planar_continua()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
