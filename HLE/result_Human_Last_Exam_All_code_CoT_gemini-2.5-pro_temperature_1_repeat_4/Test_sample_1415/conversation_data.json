    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Integrand:** The expression to be integrated is `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`. This is a classic form `f'(x)/f(x)`.\n2.  **Find the Antiderivative:** The integral of `f'(x)/f(x)` with respect to `x` is `ln|f(x)|`. In our case, `f(x) = F₃(x)`. So, the antiderivative is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** To evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1, we calculate `[ln|F₃(x)|]` from 0 to 1, which equals `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n4.  **Calculate F₃(x) at the limits:**\n    *   At x = 0:\n        *   F₀(0) = 0\n        *   F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0\n        *   F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1\n        *   F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n    *   At x = 1:\n        *   F₀(1) = 1\n        *   F₁(1) = sin(1)\n        *   F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))\n        *   F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n5.  **Calculate the value of the integral (V):** Substitute the values of F₃(1) and F₃(0) into the expression `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`. Note that F₃(1) and F₃(0) are both positive, so we can drop the absolute value bars.\n6.  **Calculate the Final Result:** Compute `10000 * V` and round it to the nearest integer.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the functions to calculate F3(x) at x=1 and x=0\ndef calculate_f3(x):\n    \"\"\"Calculates F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\"\"\"\n    f0 = x\n    f1 = math.sin(f0)\n    f2 = math.exp(f1)\n    f3 = math.log(1 + f2)\n    return f3\n\n# Step 2: Calculate F3(1) and F3(0)\nf3_at_1 = calculate_f3(1)\nf3_at_0 = calculate_f3(0) # This will be ln(2)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the value of the integral V\n# V = ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0))\nV = math.log(f3_at_1) - math.log(f3_at_0)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate 10000 * V and round to the nearest integer\nfinal_result = 10000 * V\nrounded_result = round(final_result)\n\n# Step 5: Print the results as requested\nprint(\"The integral is of the form ∫(f'(x)/f(x)) dx, which evaluates to ln(f(x)).\")\nprint(\"Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral is ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\")\nprint(\"\\nFirst, we calculate the numbers for the final equation:\")\nprint(f\"F₃(1) = {f3_at_1}\")\nprint(f\"F₃(0) = {f3_at_0}\")\nprint(\"\\nNow, we substitute these numbers into the equation for the integral V:\")\nprint(f\"V = ln({f3_at_1}) - ln({f3_at_0})\")\nprint(f\"V ≈ {V}\")\nprint(f\"\\nFinally, we calculate the required value:\")\nprint(f\"10000 * V ≈ {final_result}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer to 10000*V is {rounded_result}\")\n\n```\n<<<5488>>>"
