    """
    This function determines the largest upper bound for the learning rate in gradient descent
    for the given logistic regression problem.

    The convergence of gradient descent for a function f is determined by its smoothness.
    A function is L-smooth if its gradient is L-Lipschitz continuous. For a twice-differentiable
    function in one dimension, this is equivalent to its second derivative being bounded by L, i.e., |f''(w)| <= L.

    The function in question is R(w), a standard logistic loss.
    1. First, we note that the second derivative of R(w) is always non-negative,
       which means the function is convex.
       R''(w) = (1/N) * sum(x_i^2 * sigma(z_i) * (1 - sigma(z_i))), where z_i = -y_i * w * x_i.
       Since sigma * (1 - sigma) >= 0, R''(w) >= 0.

    2. The problem defines L as the uniform smoothness of R(w). This means L is the
       supremum of R''(w) over all w.
       L = sup_w R''(w).

    3. For a convex and L-smooth function, the gradient descent algorithm is guaranteed to converge
       to a global minimum from any starting point if the learning rate gamma satisfies:
       0 < gamma < 2 / L.

    4. The value lambda is the smoothness (curvature) at the optimal point w_*, i.e., lambda = R''(w_*).
       This is a local property. If we start far from w_*, the curvature can be much larger than lambda
       (up to L). A learning rate safe for the region around w_* (e.g., based on 2/lambda) might be
       too large for other regions, causing the algorithm to diverge. Therefore, the guarantee for
       convergence from *any* initialization must depend on the global constant L.

    5. From the condition 0 < gamma < 2 / L, the largest value that the upper bound M can take is 2 / L.
       Any gamma less than this M will guarantee convergence.
