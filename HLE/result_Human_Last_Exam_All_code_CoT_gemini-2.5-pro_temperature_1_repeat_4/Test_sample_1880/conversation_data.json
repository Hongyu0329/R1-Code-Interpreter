    "To find the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility:** We first determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. The prime 2 divides all coefficients except the leading one (8 and 14), and $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term 14. Thus, the polynomial is irreducible.\n2.  **Compute the Discriminant:** For an irreducible quartic, the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. We compute the discriminant ($\\Delta$) to determine if the group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The discriminant of $x^4 + px + q$ is $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$. The Galois group is a subgroup of $A_4$ if and only if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square.\n3.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic:** We then construct the resolvent cubic polynomial, given by $g(y) = y^3 - 4qy + p^2$. If this cubic is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is $S_4$. If it is reducible (i.e., has a rational root), the group is a smaller subgroup ($D_4$ or $C_4$).\n4.  **Determine the Group and its Order:** Based on the results from the previous steps (whether the discriminant is a square and whether the resolvent is reducible), we can identify the Galois group and its order.\n\nThe following Python script will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    # This is a depressed quartic of the form x^4 + px + q.\n    p = 8\n    q = 14\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the polynomial f(x) = x^4 + {p}x + {q}\")\n    print(\"Step 1: By Eisenstein's criterion with prime 2, f(x) is irreducible over Q.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Compute the discriminant of the polynomial.\n    # The formula is Delta = -27*p^4 + 256*q^3.\n    p_to_4 = p**4\n    q_to_3 = q**3\n    discriminant = -27 * p_to_4 + 256 * q_to_3\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Compute the discriminant Delta = -27*p^4 + 256*q^3\")\n    print(f\"p = {p}, q = {q}\")\n    print(f\"The equation for the discriminant is: Delta = -27 * ({p}^4) + 256 * ({q}^3)\")\n    print(f\"Delta = -27 * {p_to_4} + 256 * {q_to_3}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {-27 * p_to_4} + {256 * q_to_3}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {discriminant}\")\n\n    # Check if the discriminant is a perfect square.\n    sqrt_discriminant = math.isqrt(discriminant)\n    is_perfect_square = (sqrt_discriminant**2 == discriminant)\n    \n    if is_perfect_square:\n        print(\"The discriminant is a perfect square.
