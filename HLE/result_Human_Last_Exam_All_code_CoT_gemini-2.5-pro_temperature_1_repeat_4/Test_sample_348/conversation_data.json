    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Find the Market Equilibrium:** The market is in equilibrium when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (Q_S = Q_D = Q_E) and the price is the same. I will find the equilibrium quantity (Q_E) by numerically solving the equation where the supply price equals the demand price: `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`.\n\n2.  **Understand Total Welfare:** Total welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. It can be calculated as the area between the demand curve and the supply curve, up to the equilibrium quantity.\n    *   Consumer Surplus is the integral of the demand function from 0 to Q_E, minus the total expenditure (P_E * Q_E).\n    *   Producer Surplus is the total revenue (P_E * Q_E) minus the integral of the supply function from its starting quantity to Q_E.\n    *   Total Welfare = (Integral of Demand) - (Integral of Supply).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Integrals:**\n    *   The total benefit to consumers is the integral of the demand function `∫ D(Q) dQ` from `0` to `Q_E`.\n    *   The total cost to producers is the integral of the supply function `∫ S(Q) dQ` from its minimum quantity (`Q > 2^(1/3)`) to `Q_E`.\n    *   Both integrals are complex and will be calculated numerically.\n\n4.  **Compute the Final Value:** I will subtract the value of the supply integral from the value of the demand integral to get the final total welfare. The Python script below will perform these calculations and print out each step of the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\n\ndef solve_and_print_welfare():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the total welfare based on the given\n    supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the demand function P(Q)\n    def demand(q):\n        return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(q))\n\n    # Define the supply function P(Q)\n    # The function is defined for Q^3 - 2 > 0.\n    def supply(q):\n        # The solver might test values where the log is undefined.\n        # We return a large number to push the solver away from this region.\n        with np.errstate(invalid='ignore'): # Suppress log(negative) warnings\n            val = np.log(q**3 - 2)\n        if np.isnan(val):\n            return 1e9 # Return a large number for invalid inputs\n        return val\n\n    # Define the equation to find the equilibrium quantity: Demand(Q) - Supply(Q) = 0\n    def equilibrium_equation(q):\n        return demand(q) - supply(q)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Find the Market Equilibrium Quantity (Q_E) ---\n    # An initial guess is needed for the numerical solver.\n    # A quick plot or trial-and-error suggests the intersection is between 4 and 5.\n    initial_guess = 4.5\n    # Use fsolve to find the root of the equilibrium equation.\n    Q_E = fsolve(equilibrium_equation, initial_guess)[0]\n\n    # --- Step 2: Define Integration Bounds ---\n    # The supply curve is defined for Q^3 - 2 > 0, so Q > 2^(1/3)\n    supply_q_min = 2**(1/3)\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate the Integrals for Total Welfare ---\n    # Total Welfare = ∫[0 to Q_E] D(Q)dQ - ∫[Q_min to Q_E] S(Q)dQ\n    \n    # Integral of the demand curve from 0 to Q_E\n    integral_demand, _ = quad(demand, 0, Q_E)\n\n    # Integral of the supply curve from its starting point to Q_E\n    integral_supply, _ = quad(supply, supply_q_min, Q_E)\n\n    # --- Step 4: Calculate Total Welfare and Print Results ---\n    total_welfare = integral_demand - integral_supply\n    \n    print(\"To find the total welfare, we use the formula:\")\n    print(\"Total Welfare = ∫[0 to Q_E] D(Q)dQ - ∫[Q_min to Q_E] S(Q)dQ\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"1.
