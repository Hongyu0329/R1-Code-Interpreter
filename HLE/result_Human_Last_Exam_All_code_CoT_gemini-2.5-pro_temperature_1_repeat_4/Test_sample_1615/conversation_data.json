    "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible chromatic number ($\\chi(G)$) for a graph $G$ that has $n=12345$ vertices and is not a complete graph. The chromatic number is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Establish an upper bound:** We will show that any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices that is not a complete graph can be colored with at most $n-1$ colors. This gives us an upper limit on the required number of colors.\n2.  **Establish a lower bound:** We will demonstrate that this upper bound is achievable by constructing a specific graph that has $n=12345$ vertices, is not complete, and requires exactly $n-1$ colors to be properly colored.\n3.  **Conclude:** By showing that the maximum possible number of colors is at most $n-1$ and that there exists a graph that requires exactly $n-1$ colors, we can conclude that the maximum number of colors needed is $n-1$.\n4.  **Calculate the final value:** We will substitute $n=12345$ into our formula to get the final answer.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this plan, explaining each step and printing the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_graph_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph\n    with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 12345\n\n    print(\"Let G be a graph with n vertices, where n = 12345.\")\n    print(\"We are given that G is not a complete graph (G != K_n).\")\n    print(\"The question asks for the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of G.\")\n    print(\"This is equivalent to finding the maximum possible value of the chromatic number, chi(G), for such a graph G.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 1: Finding the upper bound ---\")\n    print(\"Since G is not a complete graph, there must be at least one pair of vertices, let's call them 'u' and 'v', that are not connected by an edge.\")\n    print(\"Because u and v are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same color in a proper coloring.\")\n    print(\"Let's use Color 1 for both u and v.\")\n    print(f\"The remaining n - 2 = {n - 2} vertices can be colored using new, distinct colors.\")\n    print(f\"This coloring strategy uses a total of 1 (for u and v) + {n - 2} (for the rest) = {n - 1} colors.\")\n    print(f\"This shows that any non-complete graph with {n} vertices can be colored with at most {n - 1} colors.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the maximum chromatic number is at most {n - 1}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 2: Showing the upper bound is achievable ---\")\n    print(\"To show that this bound can be reached, we need to find an example of a non-complete graph on n vertices that requires exactly n-1 colors.\")\n    print(f\"Consider the graph G* created by taking a complete graph on {n} vertices (K_{n}) and removing a single edge.\")\n    print(\"This graph G* is not complete, so it meets the problem's conditions.\")\n    print(f\"Let the removed edge be between vertices 'u' and 'v'.\")\n    print(f\"Now, consider the subgraph of G* induced by the set of all vertices except 'v'.
