    "To determine the Chern number of the junction formed by two Chern insulators, we can follow this plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Principle:** The Chern number is a topological invariant. For systems that are combined without closing the bulk energy gap, the Chern number of the combined system is simply the sum of the individual Chern numbers. This is a fundamental property of topological insulators.\n2.  **Identify the Given Values:** We are given two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1.\n3.  **Calculate the Total Chern Number:** We will add the Chern numbers of the two individual insulators to find the Chern number of the junction.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** A simple Python script will be created to define the individual Chern numbers, calculate their sum, and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\n# The Chern number is a topological invariant. When two topological systems,\n# such as Chern insulators, are brought together without closing the bulk gap,\n# the Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\n# Define the Chern number for the first insulator.\nc1 = 1\n\n# Define the Chern number for the second insulator.\nc2 = 1\n\n# Calculate the Chern number of the junction.\nc_total = c1 + c2\n\n# Print the explanation and the final calculation.\nprint(\"The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(f\"C_junction = C1 + C2\")\nprint(f\"C_junction = {c1} + {c2} = {c_total}\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
