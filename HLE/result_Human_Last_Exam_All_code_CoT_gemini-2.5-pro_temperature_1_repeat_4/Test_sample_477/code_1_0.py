    # Step 1: Define the context
    print("1. Myotonic Dystrophy (DM1) is characterized by the expansion of a CTG repeat sequence.")
    print("   This repeat is somatically unstable, meaning it tends to expand further in various tissues over time.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 2: Explain the expansion mechanism
    print("2. The expansion process is linked to DNA repair. During replication, the CTG repeats can form hairpin structures.")
    print("   The cell's repair machinery tries to remove these hairpins, but this process can paradoxically result in the addition of more repeats.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 3: Define the role of LIG1
    print("3. DNA Ligase 1 (LIG1) is a key enzyme in DNA replication and repair.")
    print("   Its primary function is to perform the final step: sealing nicks in the DNA backbone to complete the repair process.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 4: Describe the impact of LIG1 knockout
    print("4. When LIG1 is knocked out or its function is inhibited, this final sealing step cannot occur.")
    print("   The pathway that leads to the expansion of the CTG repeat is interrupted and cannot be completed.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 5: State the conclusion
    print("5. Conclusion: By blocking the finalization of the expansion event, the absence of LIG1 leads to a stabilization of the repeat tract.")
    print("   Therefore, knocking out LIG1 results in reduced somatic instability.")
    print("-" * 70)

    # Final Answer
    print("The correct answer choice is C: Reduced instability.")
