    print("Analyzing the choices to find a common motif in the films of Fritz Lang and William Friedkin:\n")

    # Choice A: Aboriginal masks
    print("--- Choice A: Aboriginal masks ---")
    print("This is not a prominent motif for either director. William Friedkin's 'The Exorcist' features a Mesopotamian (not Aboriginal) demon artifact, and it is not a known theme in Lang's work.")
    print("Result: Not a common motif.\n")

    # Choice B: Magic wands
    print("--- Choice B: Magic wands ---")
    print("This fantasy element does not fit the gritty, realistic, or expressionistic styles of either director.")
    print("Result: Not a common motif.\n")

    # Choice C: The first ever cyborgs on screen
    print("--- Choice C: The first ever cyborgs on screen ---")
    print("Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' (1927) famously features the Maschinenmensch, considered one of the first on-screen robots or cyborgs. However, cyborgs are not a feature in William Friedkin's films.")
    print("Result: Not a common motif.\n")

    # Choice D: Bugs
    print("--- Choice D: Bugs ---")
    print("This is the strongest connection. Let's break it down:")
    print(" - William Friedkin: Directed the film 'Bug' (2006), which is entirely about paranoia involving insects. 'The Exorcist' (1973) also features the iconic and unsettling 'spider-walk' scene.")
    print(" - Fritz Lang: Used arachnid imagery for his master criminals. His early silent serial was 'The Spiders' (1919), and the villain Dr. Mabuse is often described as a spider at the center of a criminal web.")
    print("Result: Bugs and bug-like (arachnid) imagery are present in the oeuvres of both directors.\n")

    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Based on the analysis, 'Bugs' is the correct answer as imagery of bugs and/or arachnids appears in the works of both directors.")
