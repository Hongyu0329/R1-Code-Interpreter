# Step 1: Define the variables based on historical facts about Minsk.

# X is the building number of the former exhibition hall on Yanki Kupaly street.
X = 27

# Y is the number of the tram route that no longer passes through Kastryƒçnickaja street.
Y = 6

# Step 2: Calculate X to the power of Y.
result = X ** Y

# Step 3: Print the final equation and the result.
# The output shows each number in the equation as requested.
print(f"{X} ^ {Y} = {result}")
