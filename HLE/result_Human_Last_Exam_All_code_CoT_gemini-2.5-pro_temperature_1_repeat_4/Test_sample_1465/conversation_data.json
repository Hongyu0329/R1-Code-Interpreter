    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil protein sequences, we can analyze the amino acid composition at key positions within the heptad repeat (`abcdefg`). The stability and oligomerization state are primarily determined by the packing of hydrophobic residues at the core `a` and `d` positions. Other positions, like `g` and `e` (electrostatic interactions) or `c` (packing), can also modulate the state.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Establish the Heptad Register:** I will analyze the sequences to find the most likely `abcdefg` pattern. A consistent pattern across these designed peptides is crucial. A register of `fgabcde` (meaning the first residue of the sequence is in the `f` position) appears to be the most consistent. In this register, the key positions are:\n    *   `a`: residues at 3, 10, 17, 24\n    *   `d`: residues at 6, 13, 20, 27\n    *   `g`: residue at 2, 9, 16, 23\n    *   `c`: residue at 5, 12, 19, 26\n\n2.  **Apply Known Rules:** I will apply established rules from structural biology studies (like those by Harbury et al.) to predict the oligomeric state based on the residues found at these key positions.\n    *   **Core `a` and `d` positions:** The combination of amino acids at `a` and `d` is the primary determinant. For example, `AaLd` (Alanine at `a`, Leucine at `d`) favors dimers, while `AaId` (Alanine at `a`, Isoleucine at `d`) favors tetramers.\n    *   **Modifier positions:** Residues at other positions can influence the outcome. A bulky hydrophobic residue like Isoleucine (I) at the `g` position or a polar residue like Threonine (T) at the `c` position can favor trimer formation, sometimes overriding the `a`/`d` preference.\n\n3.  **Code the Logic:** I will write a Python script that systematically extracts the residues from the key positions for each sequence and applies these rules to predict the final oligomeric state.\n\n4.  **Output the Result:** The script will print the predicted state for each sequence and the final sequence of numbers corresponding to the answer choices.\n\n```python\ndef predict_oligomeric_state(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of a coiled-coil sequence based on residues\n    at key positions 'a', 'd', 'g', and 'c' of the heptad repeat.\n    The analysis assumes a consistent 'fgabcde' register.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Using 0-based indexing for the sequence string.\n    # Heptad register 'fgabcde' corresponds to indices:\n    # a: 2, 9, 16, 23\n    # d: 5, 12, 19, 26\n    # g: 1, 8, 15, 22\n    # c: 4, 11, 18, 25\n    a_pos = [2, 9, 16, 23]\n    d_pos = [5, 12, 19, 26]\n    g_pos = [1, 8, 15, 22]\n    c_pos = [4, 11, 18, 25]\n\n    try:\n        a_residues = \"\".join([sequence[i] for i in a_pos])\n        d_residues = \"\".join([sequence[i] for i in d_pos])\n        g_residues = \"\".join([sequence[i] for i in g_pos])\n        c_residues = \"\".join([sequence[i] for i in c_pos])\n    except IndexError:\n        return \"Invalid Sequence Length\"\n\n    # --- Prediction Rules ---\n\n    # Rule 1: An 'AaId' core (Alanine at 'a', Isoleucine at 'd') strongly promotes\n    # tetramer formation.
