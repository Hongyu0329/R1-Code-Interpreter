    "Of course, I can help you with this computational chemistry problem. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the Reaction and Governing Principles**: The reaction is the thermal electrocyclization of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. This is an 8 \\(\\pi\\)-electron system. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, which are based on Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, an 8 \\(\\pi\\)-electron system undergoes a **conrotatory** ring closure under thermal conditions. This is the symmetry-allowed pathway.\n\n2.  **Determine the Stereochemical Outcome of the Allowed Path**:\n    *   We need to determine the stereochemistry of the reactant's termini. The reacting system is the C2-to-C9 octatetraene backbone. The substituents at the termini (C2 and C9) are methyl groups.\n    *   For the given \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\) stereochemistry, both terminal methyl groups are positioned \"outward\" relative to the U-shape the molecule must adopt to cyclize.\n    *   A **conrotatory** motion of an \"out, out\" substituted polyene results in a **\\(\\textit{trans}\\)** relationship between the substituents in the product. Therefore, the allowed product is the \\(\\textit{trans}\\)-isomer, B.\n\n3.  **Account for the Formation of the \"Forbidden\" Product**:\n    *   The problem states that the \\(\\textit{cis}\\)-isomer, A, is also formed. This product would arise from a symmetry-forbidden **disrotatory** pathway.\n    *   Since the problem asks for a quantitative ratio of A to B without providing any thermal data (like temperature), we must use a model derived directly from FMO theory.\n\n4.  **Develop a Quantitative FMO Model**:\n    *   Let's propose a model where the ratio of the forbidden product (A) to the allowed product (B) is related to the properties of the Frontier Molecular Orbitals—the HOMO and LUMO. A simple hypothesis is that the ratio of the reaction rates is proportional to the square of the ratio of the orbital coefficients at the reacting termini:\n        > Ratio(A/B) = k<sub>forbidden</sub> / k<sub>allowed</sub> \\(\\approx\\) (c<sub>LUMO, term</sub> / c<sub>HOMO, term</sub>)<sup>2</sup>\n    *   We will use the Hückel Molecular Orbital (HMO) method to find the terminal coefficients for the HOMO and LUMO of octatetraene (an 8-atom \\(\\pi\\)-system).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio**:\n    *   For an 8-atom linear polyene, the HOMO is \\(\\psi_4\\) and the LUMO is \\(\\psi_5\\).\n    *   A key principle for this type of molecule (an alternant hydrocarbon) is the **Pairing Theorem**, which states that the coefficients of the HOMO (\\(\\psi_k\\)) and LUMO (\\(\\psi_{N+1-k}\\)) are equal in magnitude for the terminal atoms. Here, k=4 and N=8, so the LUMO is \\(\\psi_{8+1-4} = \\psi_5\\).\n    *   This theorem implies |c<sub>HOMO, term</sub>| = |c<sub>LUMO, term</sub>|, making their ratio 1.\n    *   Therefore, the predicted ratio of A to B is 1<sup>2</sup> = 1, meaning A:B = 1:1.\n    *   The Python code below will perform this calculation and present the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# This script calculates the theoretical product ratio for the electrocyclization\n# of (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene based on Frontier Molecular Orbital theory.\n\n# 1. Define the parameters for the reacting pi-system (octatetraene)\nN = 8  # Number of pi electrons / atoms in the conjugated system\nj = 1  # Index of the terminal atom (can be 1 or N)\n\n# 2. Identify the HOMO and LUMO quantum numbers (k) for the polyene\n# For a linear polyene with N atoms, there are N molecular orbitals.\n# The N electrons fill the first N/2 orbitals.\n# HOMO is the highest occupied molecular orbital, k = N/2.\n# LUMO is the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, k = N/2 + 1.\nk_homo = N // 2\nk_lumo = N // 2 + 1\n\n# 3. Use the analytical formula for Huckel coefficients of a linear polyene:\n# c_k,j = sqrt(2 / (N + 1)) * sin(k * j * pi / (N + 1))\ndef calculate_coefficient(k, j, N):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Huckel MO coefficient for atom j in orbital k.\"\"\"\n    return np.sqrt(2 / (N + 1)) * np.sin(k * j * np.pi / (N + 1))\n\n# 4. Calculate the coefficients at the terminus for the HOMO and LUMO\nc_homo_terminus = calculate_coefficient(k_homo, j, N)\nc_lumo_terminus = calculate_coefficient(k_lumo, j, N)\n\n# 5. Model the product ratio.\n# The allowed conrotatory path yields trans-isomer B. The ratio depends on the HOMO.\n# The forbidden disrotatory path yields cis-isomer A. We model its rate relative\n# to the allowed path using the ratio of LUMO to HOMO terminal coefficients.\n# Ratio A:B is modeled as (c_LUMO_terminus / c_HOMO_terminus)^2\n# Due to the pairing theorem, |c_homo_terminus| is equal to |c_lumo_terminus|.\nratio_val = (c_lumo_terminus / c_homo_terminus)**2\n\n# The numbers for the final ratio equation are derived from the calculation.\n# Since ratio_val is 1.0, the ratio is 1:1.\nratio_A = 1\nratio_B = 1\n\n# 6.
