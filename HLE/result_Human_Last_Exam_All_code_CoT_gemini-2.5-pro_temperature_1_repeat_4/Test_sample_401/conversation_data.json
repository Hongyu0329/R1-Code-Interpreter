    "This problem comes from a specific area of mathematics called topology. To answer it, we need to understand the definitions of the terms involved.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the key concepts**: I will first explain what a \"continuum,\" an \"indecomposable continuum,\" and a \"composant\" are in topology.\n2.  **State the relevant theorem**: There is a fundamental theorem that describes the number of composants in an indecomposable continuum. I will state this theorem.\n3.  **Determine the minimum number**: Based on the theorem, I will determine the smallest possible number of composants.\n4.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script that prints this explanation and the final answer. The code itself won't perform a calculation, as this is a theoretical question, but it will present the reasoning and the result as requested.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n*   A **continuum** is a compact and connected topological space. Think of it as a single, bounded piece without any gaps.\n*   An **indecomposable continuum** is a continuum that cannot be split into two smaller, proper subcontinua that cover it. It's \"un-splittable\" in a specific way. A simple line segment is decomposable, but more complex shapes like the \"pseudo-arc\" or \"bucket handle\" are indecomposable.\n*   A **composant** of a point `p` in a continuum is the set of all points that can be contained with `p` in some proper subcontinuum. For an indecomposable continuum, the composants form a partition of the space (every point belongs to exactly one composant).\n*   A classic and powerful theorem in topology states that every separable indecomposable continuum has exactly **c** composants, where **c** is the cardinality of the continuum (the \"number\" of real numbers, which is an uncountable infinity, $2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n*   Since all standard examples (and indeed all separable ones) have exactly **c** composants, there is no smaller number of composants they can have. Therefore, the smallest number is **c**. The note \"(not necessarily metric)\" usually implies that the property is topological, but in the context of continua, separability is a standard assumption.\n\nNow, I will write the Python code to present this result.\n\n```python\ndef explain_composants():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the topological concept of composants in an\n    indecomposable continuum and provides the answer to the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nThis question is about a concept in the mathematical field of topology.\n\n1.  **Continuum**: A compact, connected space. Intuitively, a single, bounded object with no breaks.\n2.  **Indecomposable Continuum**: A continuum that cannot be written as the union of two of its own proper, smaller subcontinua. It is fundamentally \"un-splittable\".\n3.  **Composant**: The composants are specific dense subsets that partition an indecomposable continuum. Every point in the continuum belongs to exactly one composant.\n\nA key theorem in topology addresses the number of these composants.\nFor any non-degenerate (i.e., not a single point) indecomposable separable continuum, the set of its composants has a cardinality of 'c'.\n\nCardinality 'c' is the cardinality of the continuum, which is the size of the set of all real numbers. This is a type of uncountable infinity, equal to 2 to the power of aleph-null (2^ℵ₀).\n\nSince any such continuum has exactly 'c' composants, the smallest number of composants it can have is also 'c'.\n\"\"\"\n\n    final_equation = \"The smallest number of composants = c\"\n\n    print(explanation)\n    print(final_equation)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    explain_composants()\n```\n<<<c>>>"
