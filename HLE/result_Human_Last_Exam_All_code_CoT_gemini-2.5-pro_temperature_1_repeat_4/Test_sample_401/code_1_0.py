This question is about a concept in the mathematical field of topology.

1.  **Continuum**: A compact, connected space. Intuitively, a single, bounded object with no breaks.
2.  **Indecomposable Continuum**: A continuum that cannot be written as the union of two of its own proper, smaller subcontinua. It is fundamentally "un-splittable".
3.  **Composant**: The composants are specific dense subsets that partition an indecomposable continuum. Every point in the continuum belongs to exactly one composant.

A key theorem in topology addresses the number of these composants.
For any non-degenerate (i.e., not a single point) indecomposable separable continuum, the set of its composants has a cardinality of 'c'.

Cardinality 'c' is the cardinality of the continuum, which is the size of the set of all real numbers. This is a type of uncountable infinity, equal to 2 to the power of aleph-null (2^ℵ₀).

Since any such continuum has exactly 'c' composants, the smallest number of composants it can have is also 'c'.
