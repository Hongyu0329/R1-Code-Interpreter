    "To determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link, we'll follow a systematic approach.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Invariant:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant for a weighted homogeneous polynomial `f` is defined by the formula: `inv(f) = d - sum(w_i)`, where `d` is the weighted degree of the polynomial and `w_i` are the weights of the variables.\n\n2.  **Determine the Weighted Degree (d):** The polynomial is defined in a weighted projective space with weights `w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)` corresponding to the variables `(z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)`. For the polynomial to be well-defined (weighted homogeneous), every monomial term must have the same total weighted degree. Let's calculate the degree for a few terms from the polynomial `0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3`:\n    *   Degree of `z_1^8z_3` = `8 * w_1 + 1 * w_3` = `8 * 22 + 49` = `176 + 49 = 225`.\n    *   Degree of `z_1z_2^7` = `1 * w_1 + 7 * w_2` = `1 * 22 + 7 * 29` = `22 + 203 = 225`.\n    *   Degree of `z_5^3` = `3 * w_5` = `3 * 75 = 225`.\n    Most terms have a degree of 225 (note: the term `z_1^4z_2^3z_3` has a degree of 224 and is likely a typo in the problem statement). Based on the other terms, we can confidently set the polynomial's weighted degree `d = 225`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Sum of Weights (sum(w_i)):** We simply add the given weights together:\n    *   `sum(w_i) = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225`.\n\n4.  **Compute the Invariant:** We substitute `d` and `sum(w_i)` into the formula. This is inherently zero because the Calabi-Yau condition for a hypersurface is `d = sum(w_i)`.\n\nThe following Python code will execute these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The weights for the variables (z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n\n    # The polynomial is 0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3\n    # For a polynomial to define a hypersurface in weighted projective space,\n    # it must be weighted-homogeneous, meaning all monomials have the same weighted degree.\n    # Let's calculate the degree 'd' from a representative monomial, e.g., z_5^3.\n    # The degree of z_5^3 is 3 * weight_of_z5 = 3 * 75 = 225.\n    # Let's verify with another monomial, e.g., z_1^8z_3.\n    # The degree is 8 * weight_of_z1 + 1 * weight_of_z3 = 8 * 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225.\n    # We conclude that the degree of the polynomial is 225.\n    d = 225\n\n    # The sum of the weights\n    sum_of_weights = sum(weights)\n\n    # The Crawley-Nordström invariant is defined as d - sum(w_i).\n    # For a manifold to be Calabi-Yau, the condition d = sum(w_i) must hold.\n    invariant = d - sum_of_weights\n\n    # Format the sum of weights for printing\n    weights_sum_str = ' + '.join(map(str, weights))\n\n    print(f\"The weighted degree of the polynomial is d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"The sum of the weights is sum(w_i) = {weights_sum_str} = {sum_of_weights}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant is d - sum(w_i).\")\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{d} - ({weights_sum_str}) = {invariant}\")\n\ncalculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
