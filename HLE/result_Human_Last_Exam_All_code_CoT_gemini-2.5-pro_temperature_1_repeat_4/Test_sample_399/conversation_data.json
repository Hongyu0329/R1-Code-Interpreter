    "To solve this initial value problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the type of ODE**: The equation $x'(t)=(t-1)x^2(t)$ is a separable differential equation.\n2.  **Separate Variables**: I will rearrange the equation to have all terms involving $x$ on one side and all terms involving $t$ on the other side. This gives $\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt$.\n3.  **Integrate Both Sides**: I will integrate both sides to find the general solution. The integral of $\\frac{1}{x^2}$ is $-\\frac{1}{x}$, and the integral of $(t-1)$ is $\\frac{t^2}{2} - t$. This yields the general solution: $-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C$.\n4.  **Apply the Initial Condition**: I will use the initial condition $x(0)=-8$ to find the constant $C$. Substituting $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution gives $-\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C$, which simplifies to $C = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n5.  **Find the Particular Solution**: With $C=\\frac{1}{8}$, the particular solution is $-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}$. Solving for $x(t)$ gives $x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}}$.\n6.  **Calculate x(1)**: Finally, I will substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution to find $x(1)$. The calculation is $x(1) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1^2}{2} + 1 - \\frac{1}{8}}$.\n7.  **Code the Final Calculation**: The Python code below will perform this final calculation, displaying the equation with its numerical components and printing the exact fractional result.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# After solving the differential equation with the initial condition,\n# we get the particular solution:\n# x(t) = 1 / (-t^2/2 + t - 1/8)\n# We need to find the value of x(1).\n\n# Define the numbers that appear in the final calculation for x(1):\n# x(1) = num_1 / (-(num_2**num_3 / num_4) + num_5 - (num_6 / num_7))\nnum_1 = 1  # Numerator\nnum_2 = 1  # Value of t\nnum_3 = 2  # Power of t\nnum_4 = 2  # Denominator for the t term\nnum_5 = 1  # The additive t term\nnum_6 = 1  # Numerator of the constant C\nnum_7 = 8  # Denominator of the constant C\n\n# Calculate the result using the Fraction module for an exact answer.\ndenominator = -(Fraction(num_2**num_3, num_4)) + Fraction(num_5) - Fraction(num_6, num_7)\nresult = Fraction(num_1, denominator)\n\n# Print the final equation with all its components, and the final answer.\nprint(\"The equation to calculate x(1) is derived from the particular solution evaluated at t=1.\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {num_1} / (-({num_2}^{num_3}/{num_4}) + {num_5} - ({num_6}/{num_7}))\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = 1 / (-1/2 + 1 - 1/8)\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = 1 / (1/2 - 1/8)\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = 1 / (3/8)\")\nprint(f\"The final value of x(1) is: {result}\")\n```\n<<<8/3>>>"
