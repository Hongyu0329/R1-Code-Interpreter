    "My approach to solving this problem is to determine which of the given curves has \"good reduction\" for all prime numbers `p > 2`.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand \"Good Reduction\"**: A hyperelliptic curve `z^2 = f(x)` defined over the rational numbers has *good reduction* at a prime `p` if the curve remains non-singular when its defining equation is considered over the finite field `F_p`. For `p > 2`, this is equivalent to the condition that `p` does not divide the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)`.\n2.  **The Task**: The phrase \"good ordinary reduction above 2\" implies two conditions. The primary one is \"good reduction above 2\", which means the curve must have good reduction for all primes `p > 2`. Consequently, the discriminant of `f(x)` must not have any prime factors other than 2. The \"ordinary\" part is a further condition on the nature of the reduction, which we would only check for a curve that already has good reduction everywhere for `p > 2`.\n3.  **Execution**: I will write a Python script to compute the discriminant for each polynomial `f(x)` given in the options. The script will then find all prime factors of the discriminant's absolute value.\n4.  **Conclusion**: I will check which of the curves has a discriminant whose prime factors are all equal to 2. The curve that satisfies this condition is the answer.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to perform this analysis.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef analyze_curve_reduction(label, poly_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the reduction properties of a curve y^2 = f(x)\n    by computing the prime factors of the discriminant of f(x).\n    \"\"\"\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    f = sympy.sympify(poly_str)\n\n    # Calculate the discriminant of the polynomial f(x)\n    disc = sympy.discriminant(f, x)\n\n    print(f\"Curve {label}: z^2 = {poly_str}\")\n    print(f\"The discriminant of the polynomial is: {disc}\")\n\n    # A curve has bad reduction at prime p if p divides the discriminant.\n    # We are looking for a curve with good reduction for all primes p > 2.\n    # This means the discriminant should not have any prime factors greater than 2.\n    if disc == 0:\n        print(\"The polynomial has repeated roots, so the curve is singular over Q.\")\n        print(\"It has bad reduction at all primes.\")\n        return\n\n    # Find the prime factors of the absolute value of the discriminant\n    prime_factors = sympy.factorint(abs(disc))\n    \n    bad_reduction_primes = [p for p in prime_factors.keys() if p > 2]\n\n    if not bad_reduction_primes:\n        print(\"This curve has good reduction for all primes p > 2.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"This curve has bad reduction at the following primes greater than 2: {sorted(bad_reduction_primes)}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    curves = {\n        'A': 'x**5 + 3',\n        'B': 'x**5 - 1',\n        'C': 'x**6 - 1',\n        'D': '2*x**5 + 2*x**3 + 1',\n        'E': '4*x + x**2 + 4*x**3 + 4*x**5'\n    }\n\n    for label, poly_str in curves.items():\n        analyze_curve_reduction(label, poly_str)\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
