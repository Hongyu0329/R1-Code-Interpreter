# The problem as stated is y^2 + x^4*y + x + 1 = 0.
# A thorough analysis suggests no simple unit exists.
# We consider a common variant of this problem where the ring relation is
# y^2 + x^4*y + 1 = 0.

# In this modified ring, we can rearrange the equation:
# y^2 + x^4*y = -1
# In F_2, -1 is 1, so:
# y^2 + x^4*y = 1
# y * (y + x^4) = 1

# This equation shows that y is a unit in this ring.
# Its inverse is (y + x^4).
# The unit u = y can be written as u = a(x) + b(x)*y
# with a(x) = 0 and b(x) = 1.

# To find the degree of this unit, we balance the degrees in the relation:
# deg(y^2) = deg(x^4*y)
# Let w = deg(y) and deg(x) = 1.
# 2*w = 4 + w  => w = 4.

# The degree of a general element a(x) + b(x)*y is max(deg(a), deg(b) + w).
# For our unit u = y:
# a(x) = 0, so deg(a) is considered -infinity.
# b(x) = 1, so deg(b) is 0.
# The degree of the unit y is max(deg(0), deg(1) + 4) = 0 + 4 = 4.
