# The problem asks for the smallest possible number of complements a topology T can have on a set X
# of cardinality c, where T is neither the trivial nor the discrete topology.

# Plan:
# 1. Define what a complement topology S is for a given topology T.
#    - T union S generates the discrete topology.
#    - T intersect S is the trivial topology.
# 2. Find a specific topology T that minimizes the number of its complements.
# 3. I will use the "included point topology". Let p be a fixed point in X.
#    Let T_p = {U subset of X | p is in U} U {the empty set}.
#    This topology is valid for the problem's constraints.
# 4. I will count the number of complements for T_p.
#
# Analysis:
# Let S be a complement to T_p.
# - For any point q different from p, its only T_p-neighborhood is X. To make {q} open in the combined
#   topology, we need S_q in S such that X intersect S_q = {q}, which means S_q = {q}.
#   So, for any q != p, {q} must be open in S. This means P(X\{p}) must be a subset of S.
# - For p, we can choose U_p = {p} from T_p. We need S_p in S such that p is in S_p.
# - The intersection T_p intersect S must be trivial. This means any proper non-empty open set in T_p
#   cannot be in S. A proper non-empty open set U in T_p is any set that contains p but is not X.
#   So, any set U with p in U and U != X cannot be in S.
#
# What can S be?
# Let O be an open set in S.
# - If p is not in O, O is a subset of X\{p}. Since P(X\{p}) is a subset of S, this is fine.
# - If p is in O, then O is an open neighborhood of p. From the intersection condition, O cannot
#   be a proper subset of X. Therefore, O must be equal to X.
#
# This fully determines S. The open sets of S are the subsets of X\{p} and the set X itself.
# S = P(X\{p}) U {X}.
# This is a single, unique topology. So, T_p has exactly 1 complement.
#
# Since a complement is known to exist, the minimum number cannot be 0.
# We have found a topology with exactly one complement.
# Thus, the smallest possible number is 1.

# The final answer is an integer, so the code will output this number.
# The instruction "output each number in the final equation" is satisfied by printing the final result.
