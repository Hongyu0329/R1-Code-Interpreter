# This is a thought block, not the final code output.
# The user wants an integer as the answer, not a script.
# My reasoning leads to the conclusion that the code is correct.
# Therefore, the answer should be 0.
# The final output should just be the answer, as per the instructions.
# No code block is needed. The final response format is just "<<<answer content>>>".
# The user provided a python solution and asked for an evaluation.
# If the solution is correct, I should answer 0.
# If it is incorrect, I should answer with the smallest N for which it fails.
# Based on my analysis, the solution is correct.
# Hence, the answer is 0.
