    The value of a Residential Mortgage-Backed Security (RMBS) is derived from the cash flows of the underlying mortgage pool. The most significant factor that disrupts these cash flows and thus determines the security's value is the rate at which borrowers fail to make their payments.

    Let's model the core value driver:
    RMBS Value = Present Value of (Expected Mortgage Payments - Expected Losses)
    where:
    Expected Losses = Probability_of_Default * Loss_Given_Default

    The 'Probability_of_Default' is directly represented by 'Default rates' (Option E). 'Loss_Given_Default' is determined by 'Recovery rates' (Option G).

    During the 2004-2008 financial crisis, the entire market had systematically underestimated the 'Default rates' of the subprime and Alt-A mortgages backing these securities. When housing prices stalled and fell, these default rates began to skyrocket.

    This surge in actual and expected defaults was the most direct and powerful cause of the collapse in RMBS values. While poor originator quality (F) was the fundamental reason *why* defaults occurred, the default rate itself is the variable that most directly *determines the value* of the RMBS.
