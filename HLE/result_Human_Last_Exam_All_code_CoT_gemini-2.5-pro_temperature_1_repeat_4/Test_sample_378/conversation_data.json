    "Based on my research, the premise of your question is incorrect. The former President of Nigeria's full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. He has never publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\". That name belongs to Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president.\n\nTherefore, there is no year to provide. I will generate a Python script to print this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef get_name_information():\n  \"\"\"\n  Prints information regarding the name of former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan.\n  \"\"\"\n  name = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n  other_figure = \"Nnamdi Azikiwe\"\n  \n  print(f\"The former president's full name is {name}.\")\n  print(f\"He has not publicly identified himself as 'Azikiwe'. The name 'Azikiwe' is associated with {other_figure}, Nigeria's first president.\")\n  print(\"Therefore, there is no year in which Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself as Azikiwe.\")\n\nget_name_information()\n```\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe.>>>"
