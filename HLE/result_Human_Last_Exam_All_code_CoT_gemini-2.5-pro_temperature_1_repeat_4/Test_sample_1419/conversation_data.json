    "To find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling `u*` in the `ϕ^4` theory near four dimensions, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Introduce the Beta Function:** The behavior of the coupling constant `u` under changes in the energy scale is governed by the renormalization group (RG) and described by the beta function, `β(u)`. For `ϕ^4` theory in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, the one-loop beta function is:\n    `β(u) = -ϵu + B u² + O(u³)`\n    In this expression, `ϵ` is a small parameter representing the deviation from four dimensions. The constant `B` depends on the specific conventions of the theory. For a standard single-component scalar field theory, `B = 3 / (8π²)`.\n\n2.  **Locate the Fixed Point:** A fixed point, `u*`, represents a scale-invariant point where the coupling constant no longer changes with the energy scale. This occurs when the beta function is zero:\n    `β(u*) = 0`\n\n3.  **Solve for u*:** We solve the equation for `u*`, ignoring higher-order terms (`O(u³)`):\n    `-ϵu* + B (u*)² = 0`\n    This equation yields two solutions. The first is `u* = 0`, known as the Gaussian fixed point (a free theory). The second, non-trivial solution is the Wilson-Fisher fixed point:\n    `u* = ϵ / B`\n\n4.  **Derive the Expression:** By substituting the value of `B = 3 / (8π²)`, we obtain the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling:\n    `u* = ϵ / (3 / (8π²)) = (8π² / 3) ϵ`\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to symbolically perform this calculation and print the resulting expression along with its constituent numbers.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_fixed_point_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the leading order expression for the\n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling (u*) in phi^4 theory in d=4-epsilon\n    dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variables needed for the calculation.\n    # u: the dimensionless coupling constant\n    # epsilon: the small parameter, epsilon = 4 - d\n    # pi: the mathematical constant\n    u, epsilon, pi = sympy.symbols('u epsilon pi')\n\n    # The one-loop beta function for phi^4 theory is of the form:\n    # beta(u) = -epsilon*u + B*u**2\n    # For a single-component scalar field, the constant B = 3 / (8 * pi**2).\n    # We define the numerical parts of B to print them later as requested.\n    b_numerator = 3\n    b_denominator_coeff = 8\n    pi_power = 2\n    \n    B = b_numerator / (b_denominator_coeff * pi**pi_power)\n\n    # Define the beta function expression.\n    beta_function = -epsilon * u + B * u**2\n\n    # A fixed point u* is a solution to beta(u*) = 0.\n    # We use sympy.solve to find the roots of the beta function.\n    fixed_points = sympy.solve(beta_function, u)\n\n    # The solver returns two fixed points:\n    # 1. u = 0 (the trivial Gaussian fixed point)\n    # 2. u = epsilon / B (the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point)\n    # We are interested in the non-trivial solution.\n    u_star = None\n    for fp in fixed_points:\n        if fp != 0:\n            u_star = fp\n            break\n            \n    # Now, we print the final result.\n    print(\"The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* in terms of epsilon is:\")\n    \n    # We manually format the string to show the expression clearly.\n    # u_star is epsilon/B = epsilon / (3/(8*pi**2)) = (8*pi**2/3)*epsilon\n    final_expression_str = f\"u* = ({b_denominator_coeff} * pi**{pi_power} / {b_numerator}) * epsilon\"\n    print(final_expression_str)\n    print()\n\n    # As requested, we print each number present in the final equation.\n    print(\"The numbers in the final equation are:\")\n    print(b_denominator_coeff)\n    print(pi_power)\n    print(b_numerator)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_fixed_point_expression()\n```\n<<<(8*pi**2/3)*epsilon>>>"
