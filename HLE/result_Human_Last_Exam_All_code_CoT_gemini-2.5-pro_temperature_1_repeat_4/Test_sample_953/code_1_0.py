# Step 1: Analyze the running time for a cycle of length n.
# The algorithm on a cycle takes Theta(log n) steps.
# According to the provided categories, f(n) = Theta(log n) implies f(n) = Omega(log n).
# This falls into category 9.
d1 = 9

# Step 2: Analyze the running time for any tree on n vertices of degree at most 100.
# This class of graphs includes the path graph, for which the algorithm takes Omega(log n) steps.
# The algorithm on any graph of bounded degree takes O(log n) steps.
# Thus, the complexity is Theta(log n), which falls into category 9.
d2 = 9

# Step 3: Analyze the running time for any graph on n vertices of degree at most 100.
# Similar to the case of trees, the complexity is Theta(log n).
# This falls into category 9.
d3 = 9

# Step 4: Combine the digits to form the final answer.
# The final answer is the concatenation of the three digits d1, d2, and d3.
