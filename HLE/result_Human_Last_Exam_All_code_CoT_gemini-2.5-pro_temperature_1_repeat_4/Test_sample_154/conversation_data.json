    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this graph theory problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The request is to find the number of simple, non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Simple Graph:** An unweighted, undirected graph containing no loops (edges connected at both ends to the same vertex) or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.\n    *   **Non-isomorphic:** Graphs that have a different structure. If we can't relabel the vertices of one graph to make it identical to another, they are non-isomorphic.\n    *   **2-Vertex-Connected (or Biconnected):** A graph with at least 3 vertices that remains connected even after you remove any single vertex. An equivalent definition for a connected graph is that it has no \"articulation points\" or \"cut vertices\".\n\n3.  **Methodology:** The most reliable way to solve this is to perform an exhaustive search. The plan is to:\n    a. Generate all possible simple graphs with 5 vertices.\n    b. Filter out any isomorphic duplicates to get a unique set of 34 non-isomorphic graphs.\n    c. For each unique graph, check if it meets the criteria for being 2-vertex-connected.\n    d. Count the number of graphs that satisfy the criteria.\n\n4.  **Tool Selection:** The `networkx` library in Python is perfect for this kind of graph analysis. It provides all the necessary functions to generate, inspect, and test graphs for properties like isomorphism and connectivity.\n\n5.  **Implementation:**\n    *   First, we'll create a list of all possible edges for a 5-vertex graph.\n    *   Then, we'll loop through all `2^10 = 1024` combinations of these edges to represent all possible labeled graphs.\n    *   For each graph, we'll check if it's a new structure (non-isomorphic) and add it to our list of unique graphs.\n    *   Finally, we'll iterate through our list of unique graphs and count how many are connected and have no articulation points.\n\nThis systematic approach ensures we find the correct and complete answer according to standard mathematical definitions.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_2_connected_graphs():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of 2-vertex-connected simple \n    nonisomorphic graphs with a specified number of vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 5\n    vertices = range(n)\n    \n    # There are n*(n-1)/2 possible edges in a simple graph.
