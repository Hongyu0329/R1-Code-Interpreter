def solve_ordinal_ordering():
    """
    Solves the ordinal ordering problem based on a corrected premise.

    The problem asks for the order type of the set X, based on definitions for
    ordinals γ and δ.
    - γ is the minimal ordinal such that ω^γ = γ. This is ε₀.
    - δ is the minimal ordinal such that δ^ω = δ. As explained in the reasoning,
      no such ordinal > 1 exists in standard set theory. We assume this is a
      typo for ω^δ = δ, which would also make δ = ε₀.

    Under the assumption that γ = δ = ε₀, we determine the distinct elements of X
    and their order.
