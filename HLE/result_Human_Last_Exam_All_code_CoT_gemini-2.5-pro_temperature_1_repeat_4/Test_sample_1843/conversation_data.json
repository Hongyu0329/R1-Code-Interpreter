    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Prime Factorization:** First, find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$.\n    $N = 36036$\n2.  **Character Decomposition:** A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely decomposed into a product of primitive characters $\\chi_{p^a}$ for each prime power factor $p^a$ in the factorization of $N$.\n    $\\chi = \\prod_{p^a || N} \\chi_{p^a}$\n3.  **Order of the Character:** The order of the composite character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters.\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_1^{a_1}}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_2^{a_2}}), \\dots)$\n    We need this order to be $6$.\n4.  **Counting Component Characters:** For each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$, we need to count the number of available primitive characters $\\chi_{p^a}$ whose orders divide $6$.\n5.  **Combining the Counts:** After finding the number of choices for each component, we will multiply them together. We must also ensure that the lcm of the orders of the chosen components is exactly 6. This means:\n    *   All component orders must be divisors of 6.\n    *   At least one component's order must be a multiple of 2.\n    *   At least one component's order must be a multiple of 3.\n\nBy analyzing the available character orders for each prime power factor, we can determine the total number of valid combinations.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan to calculate the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function.\n    Not strictly required as we only need phi(2), phi(3), phi(6),\n    but included for completeness.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N=36036 and order 6.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    # Step 1: Prime factorization of N\n    # N = 36036 = 36 * 1001 = 4 * 9 * 7 * 11 * 13 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 * 13\n    print(f\"The conductor is N = 36036.\")\n    print(\"Its prime factorization is N = 2^2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 * 13.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"A primitive character chi mod N can be decomposed into primitive characters for each prime power factor:\")\n    print(\"chi = chi_4 * chi_9 * chi_7 * chi_11 * chi_13\")\n    print(\"The order of chi must be lcm(ord(chi_4), ord(chi_9), ...) = 6.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"We count the number of choices for each component character whose order divides 6.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Count choices for each prime power factor.\n\n    # Modulus 4 (2^2)\n    # The character group mod 4, (Z/4Z)*, is cyclic of order phi(4) = 2.\n    # It has one primitive character of order 2.
