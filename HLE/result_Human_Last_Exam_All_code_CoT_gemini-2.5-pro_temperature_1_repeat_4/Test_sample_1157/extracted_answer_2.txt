The appropriate management involves immediate wound care and systemic diabetes control, followed by a diagnostic phase including radiographs. Given the patient's health, the most suitable initial replacement is a Removable Partial Denture (RPD), likely made of a flexible material or a cast metal framework. The abutment teeth would be the left central incisor and the left second premolar. Key cells involved in healing include osteoblasts, fibroblasts, and immune cells like neutrophils and macrophages, which are affected by diabetes.
