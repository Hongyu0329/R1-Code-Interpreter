    This function identifies the correct statements about language model inference.

    A) Correct. When top-k and nucleus sampling are combined, the final token pool is the intersection of the two, which is determined by the more restrictive filter at any given step.
    C) Correct. Temperature > 1 flattens the distribution. To reach the same cumulative probability `p`, more tokens (potentially tokens outside the original set) must be included.
    E) Correct. When resampling from a truncated set, the probabilities are renormalized by dividing by the sum of probabilities of the tokens in the set. This common denominator preserves the relative ratios between any two tokens in the set.
    G) Correct. Standard implementations filter the logits by taking the intersection of the token sets allowed by top-k and nucleus sampling. The intersection operation is commutative (A ∩ B = B ∩ A), so the order does not matter.
    O) Correct. Different GPU architectures (A100 vs. V100) have different internal parallelism and scheduling. Due to the non-associative nature of floating-point arithmetic, this results in tiny numerical differences that can accumulate and alter outcomes in sequential processes like beam search.
    P) Correct. If expert pruning is active, the set of active experts can change, effectively changing the model itself. A different model will produce different logits, leading to a different set of tokens for nucleus sampling.
    R) Correct. Batching sequences of different lengths can cause different underlying CUDA kernels to be used or different parallel reduction orders, leading to small floating-point differences that break determinism even with fixed seeds.
    X) Correct. Similar to (O), attention involves large sums. The order of floating-point additions can change due to hardware scheduling, creating micro-differences in scores that can change beam search paths.
    Y) Correct. Activation checkpointing saves memory by recomputing activations. This recomputation is subject to the same floating-point non-determinism as the original computation, potentially yielding slightly different values and affecting the final sampling distribution.
