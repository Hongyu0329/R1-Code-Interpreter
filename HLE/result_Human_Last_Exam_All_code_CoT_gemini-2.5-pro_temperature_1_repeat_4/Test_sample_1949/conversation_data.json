    "To identify the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Compile a list of rivers** mentioned in the Aeneid. This includes major rivers like the Nile, Danube, and Tiber, as well as others that play a role in the epic's geography.\n2.  **Find the approximate modern length** of each of these rivers in kilometers.\n3.  **Store this data** in a Python data structure. A list of dictionaries is suitable, where each dictionary holds a river's name and its length.\n4.  **Sort the data** in descending order based on river length.\n5.  **Select the top three** rivers from the sorted list.\n6.  **Print the final result**, showing the three longest rivers and their lengths.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_rivers_in_aeneid():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid,\n    sorts them by length, and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A list of major rivers mentioned in the Aeneid with their approximate lengths in kilometers.\n    # The Aeneid mentions rivers like the Nile, Danube (Ister), Euphrates, Ganges,\n    # Tigris, Rhine (Rhenus), and Tiber (Tiberis), among others.\n    rivers_data = [\n        {'name': 'Nile', 'length_km': 6650},\n        {'name': 'Danube (Ister)', 'length_km': 2850},\n        {'name': 'Euphrates', 'length_km': 2800},\n        {'name': 'Ganges', 'length_km': 2704},\n        {'name': 'Tigris', 'length_km': 1850},\n        {'name': 'Rhine (Rhenus)', 'length_km': 1233},\n        {'name': 'Po (Eridanus)', 'length_km': 652},\n        {'name': 'Tiber (Tiberis)', 'length_km': 406},\n    ]\n\n    # Sort the list of rivers by length in descending order\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers_data, key=lambda x: x['length_km'], reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three longest rivers\n    top_three_rivers = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    for river in top_three_rivers:\n        print(f\"- {river['name']}: {river['length_km']} km\")\n\nfind_longest_rivers_in_aeneid()\n```\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Nile (6650 km), the Danube (2850 km), and the Euphrates (2800 km).>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
