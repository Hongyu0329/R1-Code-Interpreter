# Step 1: Decode Y1 from Clue 1
# The clue "Y1-Hall" points to Charles Martin Hall, who discovered the Hall-Héroult
# process for aluminum production in 1886.
# Y1 = X1X2X3X4
Y1 = 1886
X1, X2, X3, X4 = 1, 8, 8, 6

# Step 2: Decode Clue 2 to find numbers for Y2, Y3, Y4.
# The clue is a complex pun. "remove 'гэ' (ge)" refers to removing the element Germanium (Ge).
# "Frenchman's aphorism" is a misdirection for the mineral Argyrodite (Ag8GeS6),
# from which Germanium was first isolated.
# Removing Ge leaves Ag8S6. This gives us the numbers:
# Ag (Silver) atomic number = 47
# S (Sulfur) atomic number = 16
# The counts 8 and 6.
# Our set of numbers for construction is {47, 16, 8, 6}.

# Step 3: Construct Y2, Y3, and Y4
# Y3 = X3X4X8X6. With X3=8 and X4=6, this is 86X8X6.
# Using the counts 8 and 6 from Ag8S6, we can set X8=8 and X6=6.
X8 = 8
X6 = 6
Y3 = int(f"{X3}{X4}{X8}{X6}") # 8686

# Y2 = X5X6X2X7X6. With X2=8 and X6=6, this is X568X76.
# Using the digits from Ag's atomic number (47), we set X5=4 and X7=7.
X5 = 4
X7 = 7
Y2 = int(f"{X5}{X6}{X2}{X7}{X6}") # 46876

# Y4 = X9X10X11. Using the remaining numbers S=16 and count=8, a logical
# construction is their product.
X9, X10, X11 = 1, 2, 8
Y4 = 16 * 8 # 128

print(f"Deciphered values:")
print(f"Y1 = {Y1}")
print(f"Y2 = {Y2}")
print(f"Y3 = {Y3}")
print(f"Y4 = {Y4}")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 4: Perform the final calculation.
# "calculate the Y4 to the Y1-Hall topological state indices for the reactants"
# implies calculating two indices from Y1 and Y4. We will use addition and subtraction.
index1 = Y1 + Y4
index2 = Y1 - Y4

print("Calculating the two topological state indices:")
print(f"Index 1: {Y1} + {Y4} = {index1}")
print(f"Index 2: {Y1} - {Y4} = {index2}")
