    This function determines how many of the seven properties must always be true for the set S.

    The properties are:
    1. Open: True. Let x be in S. Then f is an isometry on a ball B(x, e).
       Any point y in B(x, e) has a neighborhood B(y, d) which is also in B(x, e).
       So f is an isometry on B(y, d), which means y is in S. So S is open.

    2. Closed: False. Consider f(x) = |x| in R. S = R - {0}, which is not closed.

    3. Connected: False. For f(x) = |x|, S = R - {0}, which is not connected.

    4. Compact: False. For f(x) = x, S = R^n, which is not compact.

    5. Dense: True. The complement S^c cannot contain an open ball. If it did, say U is in S^c,
       then f would not be a local isometry anywhere in U. But the initial property of f holding
       everywhere in U forces f to be an isometry on U, which is a contradiction.
       So S^c has an empty interior, meaning S is dense.

    6. Connected complement: False. Consider a function f(x) which is piecewise linear with slope
       switching between +1 and -1 at every integer. For this function, S = R - Z.
       The complement S^c = Z is not connected.

    7. Trivial first singular homology group: True. The singular set S^c can be shown to be a union
       of manifolds of codimension 1. A set whose complement has codimension >= 2 would contradict
       the properties of f. A set with a "nice" boundary of codimension 1 does not create
       non-trivial 1-cycles in its complement. Any loop in S can be contracted.
