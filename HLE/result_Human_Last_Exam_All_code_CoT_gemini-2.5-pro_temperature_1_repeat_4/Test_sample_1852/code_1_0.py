    This function encapsulates the results of the set theory problem.
    The problem involves finding delta_1 + delta_2 based on the properties of towers on omega_1,
    under the assumption that 2^omega_1 = omega_2.

    The derivation is as follows:
    1. delta_2 is the infimum of X, where X is the set of regular cardinals lambda
       for which a tower of length lambda exists. This is the tower number t(omega_1).
    2. It can be shown that t(omega_1) > omega_1. Since t(omega_1) is a regular cardinal,
       t(omega_1) >= omega_2.
    3. A tower of length 2^omega_1 always exists. Given 2^omega_1 = omega_2, a tower of
       length omega_2 exists. So, omega_2 is in X.
    4. This implies delta_2 = inf(X) <= omega_2. Combining with the above, delta_2 = omega_2.
    5. delta_1 is the supremum of X. Any lambda in X must be <= 2^omega_1.
       Given 2^omega_1 = omega_2, any lambda in X is <= omega_2.
    6. So, delta_1 = sup(X) <= omega_2. Since omega_2 is in X, delta_1 >= omega_2.
       Therefore, delta_1 = omega_2.
    7. The sum delta_1 + delta_2 is omega_2 + omega_2, which is omega_2 in cardinal arithmetic.
