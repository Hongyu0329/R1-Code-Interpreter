    # (a) True or false: If P(u, v) = 0, then (u, v) is necessarily a critical point of the energy functional J.
    # Analysis: The Pohozaev identity is a necessary condition that all critical points of J must satisfy.
    # However, it is not a sufficient condition. A function can satisfy the identity by coincidence
    # without being a solution to the Euler-Lagrange equations (i.e., a critical point of J).
    # Therefore, the statement is false.
    answer_a = "False"

    # (b) Is it true that for any (u, v) in H^{1,s}(R^2), there exists a unique t > 0 such that (u_t, v_t) is in P?
    # Analysis: Assuming P is the Pohozaev manifold where P(u,v)=0 and a standard scaling like (u_t, v_t) = (t*u, t*v),
    # the equation P(u_t, v_t) = 0 becomes an algebraic equation for t. For example, s*t^2*K(u,v) - t^p*N(u,v) = 0.
    # A unique positive solution for t exists only if the terms (like K and N) have appropriate signs.
    # Since the statement must hold for *any* (u,v), we can choose a function for which no such positive t exists
    # (e.g., if K > 0 and the nonlinear term N <= 0). Therefore, the answer is no.
    answer_b = "No"

    # (c) Must the minimiser of J on P(a,b) satisfy the condition phi''(u,v)(1) < 0?
    # Analysis: The condition phi''(1) < 0 (where phi(t) = J(t*u, t*v)) typically characterizes unstable critical points
    # on the Nehari manifold. Minimizers of an energy functional on a constraint set (like the Pohozaev manifold)
    # are generally expected to be stable. In many standard (e.g., subcritical) problems, the minimizer corresponds to
    # a stable solution where phi''(1) > 0. Since the statement claims it *must* be negative, and there are
    # well-known cases where it is positive, the statement is not universally true. Therefore, the answer is no.
    answer_c = "No"
