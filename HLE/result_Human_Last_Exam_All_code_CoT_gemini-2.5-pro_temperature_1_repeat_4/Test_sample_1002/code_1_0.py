    This function explains the steps and computes the symbolic expression for the limit.

    The problem is to compute lim_{m -> infinity} ln(f(m)) / ln(m).
    The function f(m) describes the size of the largest k-free submatrix that can be
    retained from any matrix containing m ones.

    Step 1: Asymptotic bounds for f(m)
    - Upper Bound: Consider a sqrt(m) x sqrt(m) matrix of all ones. The largest
      k-free submatrix has a size bounded by the Zarankiewicz number, ex(sqrt(m), K_k,k),
      which is O((m^(1/2))^(2 - 1/k)) = O(m^(1 - 1/(2k))). This implies
      f(m) <= C * m^(1 - 1/(2k)).

    - Lower Bound: A key result in extremal combinatorics states that for any matrix
      with m ones, a k-free submatrix can be found with at least c * m^(1 - 1/(2k)) ones.
      This implies f(m) >= c * m^(1 - 1/(2k)).

    Step 2: Asymptotic behavior of f(m)
    From the bounds, we conclude that f(m) has an asymptotic growth of Theta(m^(1 - 1/(2k))).

    Step 3: Calculating the limit
    Given f(m) = Theta(m^(1 - 1/(2k))), we can write:
    c * m^(1 - 1/(2k)) <= f(m) <= C * m^(1 - 1/(2k))
    Taking ln() and dividing by ln(m):
    ln(c)/ln(m) + (1 - 1/(2k)) <= ln(f(m))/ln(m) <= ln(C)/ln(m) + (1 - 1/(2k))
    As m -> infinity, the ln(const)/ln(m) terms go to 0. By the Squeeze Theorem,
    the limit is 1 - 1/(2k).
