# The relevant part of the Javascript code is:
# !![]+!![]+!![]+!![]+!![]+!![]+!![]+!![]+!![]
# In Javascript, !![] evaluates to `true`, which is treated as the number 1
# in arithmetic operations. The Python equivalent is adding the boolean True
# nine times.

# Create a list of nine 'True' values.
# In Python, True is also treated as 1 in arithmetic.
numbers = [True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True]

# Convert booleans to integers for the equation string
int_values = [int(n)  for n in numbers]

# Build the equation string showing each number
equation_str = " + ".join(str(val) for val in int_values)

# Calculate the final sum
result = sum(int_values)

# Print the equation and the final answer
print(f"The core calculation is: {equation_str} = {result}")
