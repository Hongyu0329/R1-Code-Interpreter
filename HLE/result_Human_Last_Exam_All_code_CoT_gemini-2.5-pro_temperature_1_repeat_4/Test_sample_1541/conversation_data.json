    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by a Python script and the analysis for the C program's memory usage.\n\n### Plan\n\nFirst, I will provide a Python script to solve the problem as it's a high-level language well-suited for this kind of string and list manipulation.\n\n**Python Script Plan:**\n1.  Read the entire input line, which is a string representing the sum (e.g., \"3+2+1+4\").\n2.  The numbers in the sum are separated by '+'. I will split the input string by the '+' character to get a list of the numbers as strings (e.g., `['3', '2', '1', '4']`).\n3.  I will then sort this list. For single-digit numbers, a standard lexicographical sort works perfectly and will place the numbers in non-decreasing order (e.g., `['1', '2', '3', '4']`).\n4.  Finally, I will join the elements of the sorted list back into a single string, using '+' as the separator, to form the new sum (e.g., \"1+2+3+4\").\n5.  The script will then print this final string.\n\n**C Program Memory Analysis Plan:**\nFor the second part of the task, I will analyze the memory requirements for the *most memory-efficient* C program to solve this.\n1.  To be memory-efficient, the program should not store the entire input string. Instead, it can read the input character by character.\n2.  The best algorithm for this scenario is a \"counting sort\". Since the numbers are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can use a small array to store the frequency of each number.\n3.  I will calculate the total memory required for the variables in this C program, assuming standard data type sizes (e.g., `short` is 2 bytes, `int` is 4 bytes, `char` is 1 byte). The variables will include the frequency counters, loop variables, and a character variable for input.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Read the entire line from standard input\ns = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n# Split the string by the '+' sign to get a list of numbers\nnumbers = s.split('+')\n\n# Sort the list of numbers. For single digits, this works correctly.\nnumbers.sort()\n\n# Join the sorted list back into a string with '+'\n# This outputs the final equation with all numbers sorted.\nnew_sum = '+'.join(numbers)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(new_sum)\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Analysis for a C Program\n\nNow, for the analysis of the most memory-efficient C program. The program would use a counting sort approach and read input character by character to avoid storing the full string.\n\nThe variables needed and their sizes would be:\n1.  **`counts` array**: To store the frequency of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. The maximum length of the input string is 1000, so the maximum number of terms is 501 (e.g., \"1+1+...+1\"). This count fits within a `short` data type.\n    *   `short counts[4];` -> `4 * sizeof(short)` = `4 * 2` = 8 bytes.\n2.  **Input character variable**: `getchar()` returns an `int` to handle the `EOF` value correctly.\n    *   `int c;` -> `1 * sizeof(int)` = `1 * 4` = 4 bytes.\n3.  **Loop counters**: For printing the result, we need a nested loop. The outer loop runs 4 times (for numbers 1-4), which fits in a `char`. The inner loop can run up to ~500 times, which requires a `short`.\n    *   `char i;` -> `1 * sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n    *   `short j;` -> `1 * sizeof(short)` = 2 bytes.\n4.  **Printing flag**: To correctly place the '+' signs (not before the first number), a simple flag is needed. This can be a `char`.\n    *   `char first_term_flag;` -> `1 * sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n\nThe total memory `m` used for these variables is the sum of their sizes:\nm = 8 (counts) + 4 (c) + 1 (i) + 2 (j) + 1 (flag) = 16 bytes.\n\n<<<16>>>"
