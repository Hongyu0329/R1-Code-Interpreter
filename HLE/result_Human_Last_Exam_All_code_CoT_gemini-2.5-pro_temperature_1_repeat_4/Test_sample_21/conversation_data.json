    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Problem**: The user wants to find the natural density of prime numbers `p` for which the polynomial `f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22` remains irreducible when considered modulo `p`.\n2.  **Connect to Algebraic Number Theory**: This type of problem is solved using the Chebotarev Density Theorem. This theorem connects the factorization of a polynomial modulo a prime `p` to the structure of its Galois group.\n3.  **Determine the Galois Group**: The crucial step is to identify the Galois group `G` of the polynomial `f(x)` over the field of rational numbers `Q`. For this specific polynomial, the Galois group is known in mathematical literature to be the Dihedral group `D_7`. The order of `D_7` is 14.\n4.  **Apply Chebotarev's Theorem**: The theorem states that the density of primes `p` for which `f(x)` has a certain factorization pattern is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group `G` that have a corresponding cycle structure. For `f(x)` to be irreducible modulo `p`, the corresponding element in `G` (the Frobenius element) must act as a single cycle on the 7 roots of the polynomial. This means it must be a 7-cycle.\n5.  **Count the Relevant Elements**: I need to count how many elements in the Dihedral group `D_7` are 7-cycles. The group `D_7` is generated by a rotation `r` of order 7 and a reflection `s` of order 2. The elements of order 7 are `r, r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5, r^6`. There are 6 such elements, and each corresponds to a 7-cycle in the permutation representation of the group.\n6.  **Calculate the Density**: The density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the total number of elements in the group. This gives `6 / 14`, which simplifies to `3 / 7`.\n7.  **Create a Python Script**: I will write a Python script that programmatically presents this argument and prints the final calculation, as requested by the user.\n\nHere is the Python code to present the solution:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_polynomial_density():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the theoretical density of primes p\n    for which the polynomial f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22\n    remains irreducible modulo p.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: State the problem and the relevant theorem.\n    print(\"The problem is to find the natural density of primes p for which\")\n    print(\"the polynomial f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 is irreducible mod p.\")\n    print(\"This density is determined by the Chebotarev Density Theorem.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the Galois group of the polynomial.\n    # The polynomial is a known example from Galois theory.\n    print(\"The Galois group G of this polynomial over the rational numbers is the\")\n    print(\"Dihedral group D_7.\")\n    order_of_group = 14\n    print(f\"The order of D_7 is {order_of_group}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # Step 3: Relate irreducibility to the group structure.\n    print(\"For f(x) to be irreducible mod p, the corresponding Frobenius element\")\n    print(\"in the Galois group must act as a 7-cycle on the polynomial's roots.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # Step 4: Count the number of such elements in the group.\n    # In D_7 = <r, s | r^7 = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^-1>, the elements that act as\n    # 7-cycles are the elements of order 7.
