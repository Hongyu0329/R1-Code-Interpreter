    "To solve this, we will first determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for each atom (Carbon and Hydrogen) in the 6-31G basis set. Then, we'll multiply those numbers by the count of each atom in toluene (C7H8) and sum the results.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the 6-31G basis set for each atom:**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** It has one valence orbital (1s). The `31G` part means this valence orbital is represented by two contracted functions: one function is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, and the other is a single primitive Gaussian. So, each Hydrogen atom has **2** contracted functions.\n    *   **Carbon (C):** It has core (1s) and valence (2s, 2p) orbitals.\n        *   The `6-` part describes the core 1s orbital, which is represented by **1** contracted function.\n        *   The `-31G` part describes the valence 2s and 2p orbitals. They are split into two sets of functions.\n            *   Inner valence (from the `3`): 1 s-function and 1 set of p-functions (px, py, pz). This is 1 + 3 = **4** functions.\n            *   Outer valence (from the `1`): 1 s-function and 1 set of p-functions. This is 1 + 3 = **4** functions.\n        *   Total for a Carbon atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9** contracted functions.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total for Toluene (C7H8):**\n    *   Toluene has 7 Carbon atoms and 8 Hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total functions = (7 C atoms × 9 functions/C) + (8 H atoms × 2 functions/H)\n    *   Total functions = 63 + 16 = 79\n\nThe Python code below will execute this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1 (1s) + 1 (2s_inner) + 3 (2p_inner) + 1 (2s_outer) + 3 (2p_outer) = 9\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen (H): 1 (1s_inner) + 1 (1s_outer) = 2\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the contribution from Carbon atoms\ntotal_functions_carbon = num_carbon_atoms * functions_per_carbon\n\n# Calculate the contribution from Hydrogen atoms\ntotal_functions_hydrogen = num_hydrogen_atoms * functions_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions\ntotal_functions = total_functions_carbon + total_functions_hydrogen\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(f\"({num_carbon_atoms} C atoms * {functions_per_carbon} functions/C) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} H atoms * {functions_per_hydrogen} functions/H) = {total_functions_carbon} + {total_functions_hydrogen} = {total_functions}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
