    print("Step 3: Evaluating the Possibilities")
    print("------------------------------------")
    print("  - Metastatic Cancer: Fits the smoking history and pulmonary nodules, and a paraneoplastic syndrome could explain the joint pain and neurological symptoms. However, it doesn't fully explain the acute septic picture and refractory nature to specific antibiotics as well as a primary vasculitis would.")
    print("  - Sarcoidosis: Can cause pulmonary nodules, arthritis, and skin lesions. However, the rapid deterioration, severe symptoms like bruising and confusion, and death from septic shock are less characteristic.")
    print("  - Primary Infection: While the final event was infectious, a single infectious agent is unlikely to explain the chronic initial phase of joint pain and slow deterioration over time.")

    print("\nReasoning:")
    print("  - Multi-system Involvement: GPA classically affects the respiratory tract and kidneys, but also commonly involves joints, skin, and the nervous system, matching the patient's symptoms perfectly (pulmonary nodules, arthritis, confusion, skin lesions).")
    print("  - Pulmonary Nodules: A hallmark feature of GPA in the lungs.")
    print("  - Constitutional Symptoms: Fatigue, appetite loss are common.")
    print("  - Immunosuppression: The disease itself, plus treatments like steroids, cause immunosuppression. This makes patients highly vulnerable to severe, opportunistic infections, which explains the final acute episode after traveling.")
    print("  - Treatment Failure: The final infection was likely bacterial (given green sputum) but occurred in a severely compromised host with underlying vasculitic lung damage. The ineffectiveness of aminoglycosides suggests either an atypical organism or that the primary driver of the septic shock was a massive inflammatory flare of the vasculitis itself, mimicking infection.")
