    This function solves the music theory problem by transposing the relevant note.
    
    1.  Define the notes in a chromatic scale.
    2.  Identify the original melodic note in "All The Things You Are" that is enharmonically respelled.
        This note is A-flat (Ab).
    3.  Determine the transposition interval. The original key center is Ab major. The new key center,
        based on the song starting in "A minor" (the vi chord), is C major.
        The interval from Ab to C is a major third, which is 4 semitones.
    4.  Transpose the original note up by the calculated interval to find the new note.
