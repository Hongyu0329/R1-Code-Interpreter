    "To find the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 method, we need to analyze the boundary of its absolute stability region.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the BDF4 method:** The BDF4 method is a linear multistep method. Its stability properties are determined by its characteristic polynomials, $\\rho(\\xi)$ and $\\sigma(\\xi)$.\n2.  **Stability Region Boundary:** The boundary of the absolute stability region is the set of complex numbers $z = h\\lambda$ given by the function $z(\\theta) = \\frac{\\rho(e^{i\\theta})}{\\sigma(e^{i\\theta})}$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n3.  **A($\\alpha$)-stability:** A method is A($\\alpha$)-stable if its stability region contains the infinite sector $S_{\\alpha} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha \\}$. The angle $\\alpha$ is the largest such angle.\n4.  **Finding $\\alpha$:** Usually, $\\alpha$ is found by finding a point on the stability boundary where a ray from the origin, forming an angle $\\pi-\\alpha$ with the positive real axis, is tangent to the boundary. However, for BDF4, it can be shown that no such tangency points exist.\n5.  **Alternative approach:** When no tangency points exist, the constraint on $\\alpha$ is often determined by other critical points on the boundary. A geometrically significant point is the one that extends furthest into the left half-plane, i.e., the point with the minimum real part. We will calculate the angle corresponding to this point.\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Find the expression for $\\Re(z(\\theta))$.\n    *   Find the value of $\\theta$ that minimizes this real part.\n    *   Calculate the complex value of $z$ at this specific $\\theta$.\n    *   Determine the angle $\\alpha = |\\arg(-z)|$.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform these calculations symbolically and find the exact value of $\\alpha$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_bdf4_stability_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the exact value of the stability angle alpha for BDF4.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable for the location on the unit circle\n    xi = sp.Symbol('xi')\n\n    # 1.
