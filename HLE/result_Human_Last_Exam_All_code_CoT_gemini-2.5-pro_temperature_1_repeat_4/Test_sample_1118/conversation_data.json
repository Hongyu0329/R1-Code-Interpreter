    "Of course, I can help with that. First, I need to identify the object Curt Querner holds in his 1933 self-portrait. After finding the answer, I will write a Python script that prints this information in a full sentence, as per your request. The script will also include the year from your question to satisfy the instruction of outputting numbers.\n\nThe plan is:\n1.  Establish the historical fact about the painting. The painting in question is likely \"Self-Portrait with Poppy\" (Selbstbildnis mit Mohnblume).\n2.  Create a Python script that stores the artist's name, the year, and the symbolic object in variables.\n3.  Use an f-string to combine these variables into a clear, readable sentence that answers the question.\n4.  Print the final sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol_in_painting():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The year the self-portrait was painted, as mentioned in the query.\n    year = 1933\n    \n    # The object held by the artist as a symbol of resistance.\n    symbol = \"a red poppy\"\n    \n    # Construct the final sentence, including the number as requested.\n    # The print statement will output the full answer.\n    print(f\"In his self-portrait from the year {year}, Curt Querner holds {symbol} as a symbol of resistance.\")\n\nfind_symbol_in_painting()\n```\n<<<a red poppy>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
