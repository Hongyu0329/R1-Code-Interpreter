def solve_quaternion_rope_statements():
    """
    This function analyzes a series of statements about a proposed Quaternion RoPE
    positional embedding scheme and prints a string containing the letters of the
    true statements, sorted alphabetically.
    
    The analysis for each statement is as follows:
    - A (False): The inner product depends on m-n, not |m-n|, due to an odd sine term.
    - B (False): This equality does not hold due to the non-commutative nature of quaternion multiplication.
    - C (True): A fixed rotation axis is required to ensure the relative position property (i.e., that the transformation depends on m-n).
    - D (False): The rotation is parameterized by a single scalar 'm' and cannot encode 3D positions.
    - E (True): The rotation quaternion R_m is a unit quaternion, so the rotation is an isometry and preserves the vector's magnitude.
    - F (True): Real scalars commute with all quaternions, so the operation is linear.
    - G (True): The rotation is an isometry that preserves the inner product, which in turn preserves orthogonality.
    - H (True): Rotations about the same axis compose by adding their angles, so R_m * R_n = R_{m+n}.
    - J (True): Since R_m and R_n share the same axis, they commute. Their commutator is zero, which is a purely imaginary quaternion.
    - K (False): The left-multiplication mixes the real and vector parts; the real component of the original vector is not preserved.
    - L (True): The trace of the 4x4 matrix for left-multiplication by a quaternion q is 4 times the real part of q. For R_m, this is 4*cos(mÎ¸).
    - M (False): The commutator is zero for any fixed axis, not just one parallel to (1,1,1).
    - N (False): The magnitude is always preserved and equals |v|. For a unit vector, the limit is 1.
