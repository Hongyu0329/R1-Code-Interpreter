# This code will print the 32-character string that solves the puzzle.
# The string is derived by creating a working one-liner and then extracting the
# part that corresponds to the '@' placeholder in the problem's template.
# The logic uses a set comprehension for finding unique integers,
# sorted() for ordering, the `or` keyword for the "NO" case, and the `*`
# operator for space-separated printing.
