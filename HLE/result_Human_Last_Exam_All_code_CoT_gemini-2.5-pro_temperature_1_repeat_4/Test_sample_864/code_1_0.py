# that is not a valid autocorrelation sequence (it's not non-negative on the unit circle),
# so a real-valued spectral factor F(D) does not exist.
# However, if we must provide a filter, let's assume a typo in the problem and provide a
# filter for a similar, well-posed problem. A common choice might be
# F(D) = 1 + D + D^2. This gives q0=3, q1=2, q2=1.

# F(D) = 1 + D - (1/3)D^2
