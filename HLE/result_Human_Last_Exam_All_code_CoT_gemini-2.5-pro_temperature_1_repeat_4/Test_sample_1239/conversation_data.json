    "The problem is to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions. This is a well-established result in the field of mathematical physics and the study of differential equations.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  I will identify the distinct types of transformations that leave the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations unchanged. These transformations are the generators of the Lie symmetry group.\n2.  For each type of transformation (e.g., translation, rotation), I will state the number of independent parameters it requires. This number is the dimension of the corresponding subgroup.\n3.  The dimension of the full Lie group is the sum of the dimensions of all these independent symmetry transformations.\n4.  I will write a Python script that enumerates these symmetries and their dimensions, and then calculates and prints the total dimension as a sum, as requested.\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ are given by:\n$\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n$\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nThe symmetries are:\n*   **Time translation:** Shifting the time coordinate ($t \\to t + a$). This has 1 parameter.\n*   **Space translations:** Shifting the spatial coordinates ($\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}$). This has 3 parameters (one for each spatial dimension).\n*   **Spatial rotations:** Rotating the spatial coordinates ($\\mathbf{x} \\to R\\mathbf{x}$, where R is a rotation matrix). This has 3 parameters (e.g., Euler angles).\n*   **Galilean boosts:** Shifting to a uniformly moving reference frame ($\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$). This has 3 parameters (one for each component of the velocity $\\mathbf{v}$).\n*   **Scaling (Dilation):** A specific scaling of time, space, velocity, and pressure variables. This has 1 parameter.\n*   **Pressure shift:** The pressure $p$ only appears as a gradient ($\\nabla p$), so shifting it by a constant ($p \\to p + c$) is a symmetry. This has 1 parameter.\n\nThe Python code below will sum these up.\n\n```python\ndef solve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries\n    of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping each symmetry transformation to its dimension (number of parameters)\n    symmetries = {\n        \"Time translation\": 1,\n        \"Space translations\": 3,\n        \"Spatial rotations\": 3,\n        \"Galilean boosts\": 3,\n        \"Scaling (Dilation)\": 1,\n        \"Pressure shift\": 1\n    }\n\n    print(\"The total dimension of the Lie group is the sum of the dimensions of its constituent symmetry subgroups.\")\n    print(\"The symmetries and their respective dimensions are:\")\n    for name, dim in symmetries.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {dim}\")\n\n    # Calculate the total dimension and create the equation string\n    dimensions = list(symmetries.values())\n    total_dimension = sum(dimensions)\n    \n    # Format the numbers into a sum equation as requested\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, dimensions))\n    final_equation = f\"{equation_str} = {total_dimension}\"\n\n    print(\"\\nThe dimension of the Lie group is the sum of these individual dimensions:\")\n    print(final_equation)\n\nsolve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension()\n```\n<<<12>>>"
