    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the structure of the Red-Blue Hackenbush game that has the value $\\frac{13}{16}$. The number of pieces in this game is the answer.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand Hackenbush Values**: In Red-Blue Hackenbush, the value of a game position is a surreal number. For a simple stalk of pieces, its value is determined by the values of the shorter stalks that can be reached by cutting a single piece. The value `G` of a stalk is given by the surreal number formula `G = { L | R }`, where `L` is the set of values reachable by Left (cutting a red piece) and `R` is the set of values reachable by Right (cutting a blue piece).\n\n2.  **Canonical Representation**: Any dyadic rational number (a fraction of the form $\\frac{m}{2^n}$) has a unique canonical representation as a Hackenbush stalk. The value of the number, say `x`, is determined by its \"parents\": the largest number `x_L` smaller than `x` and the smallest number `x_R` larger than `x` that can be represented with fewer pieces (i.e., have a simpler denominator). The value is then given by `x = {x_L | x_R}`.\n\n3.  **Recursive Calculation**: We can find the number of pieces for $\\frac{13}{16}$ by finding the number of pieces for its parents, `x_L` and `x_R`. The number of pieces for `x` will be `max(pieces for x_L, pieces for x_R) + 1`. This gives us a recursive method.\n\n4.  **Finding Parents**: To find the parents of $\\frac{13}{16}$:\n    *   We list all dyadic fractions with denominators smaller than 16 (i.e., 2, 4, 8) and relevant integers (like 0 and 1).\n    *   The left parent, `x_L`, is the largest number in this list that is less than $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n    *   The right parent, `x_R`, is the smallest number in this list that is greater than $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n    *   $\\frac{13}{16} = 0.8125$. The closest simpler fractions are $\\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$ and $\\frac{7}{8} = 0.875$.\n    *   So, $\\frac{13}{16} = \\{ \\frac{3}{4} | \\frac{7}{8} \\}$.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation**: We will write a Python script to perform this recursive calculation, starting from $\\frac{13}{16}$ and working down to base cases like 0 and 1. The code will print out each step of the calculation to show how the final number is derived.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Memoization table to store results for already computed fractions\nmemo = {}\n\ndef find_parents(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the left and right parents of a dyadic rational number x.\n    Parents are the closest dyadic rationals with smaller denominators.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Denominator must be a power of 2. n is the power.\n    n = x.denominator.bit_length() - 1\n\n    # Generate all simpler dyadic rationals and relevant integers\n    candidates = set()\n    candidates.add(Fraction(math.floor(x)))\n    candidates.add(Fraction(math.ceil(x)))\n\n    for d in range(1, n):\n        power_of_2 = 2**d\n        for k in range(1, power_of_2):\n            candidates.add(Fraction(k, power_of_2))\n    \n    # Find the largest candidate smaller than x\n    x_L = -1 \n    for c in candidates:\n        if c < x and c > x_L:\n            x_L = c\n    \n    # Find the smallest candidate larger than x\n    x_R = float('inf')\n    for c in candidates:\n        if c > x and c < x_R:\n            x_R = c\n            \n    return (x_L, x_R)\n\ndef get_hackenbush_pieces(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively calculates the number of pieces for a given dyadic rational number x.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Return stored result if already computed\n    if x in memo:\n        return memo[x]\n\n    # Base case: Integers\n    if x.denominator == 1:\n        length = int(abs(x))\n        if x == 0:\n            print(f\"The number of pieces for 0 is 0 (the ground).\")\n        elif x > 0:\n            print(f\"The number of pieces for {x} is {length} (a stalk of {length} red piece{'s' if length > 1 else ''}).\")\n        else: # Should not be hit for this problem\n            print(f\"The number of pieces for {x} is {length} (a stalk of {length} blue piece{'s' if length > 1 else ''}).\")\n        memo[x] = length\n        return length\n\n    # Recursive step:\n    # 1.
