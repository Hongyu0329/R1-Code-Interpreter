    "This is a literary knowledge question. My plan is to first determine the correct character from the book and then embed that answer within a simple Python script. The script will use variables to hold the information and then print a formatted string containing the answer, as requested.\n\nThe character in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* who describes the Roman origin myth is Thiodolf's foster-father. He was a Roman by birth who left the Empire to live with the Goths. In Chapter V, he tells Thiodolf about the Romans' belief that they are descended from a she-wolf and a god, a clear reference to the legend of Romulus and Remus.\n\nThe Python code below will print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the character from\n    \"The House of the Wolfings\" who describes the Roman origin myth.\n    \"\"\"\n    character_name = \"Thiodolf's foster-father\"\n    context = \"a Roman by birth who had joined the Goths\"\n    myth_reference = \"Romulus and Remus\"\n\n    print(f\"The character in William Morris's 'The House of the Wolfings' who alludes to the story of {myth_reference} is {character_name}.\")\n    print(f\"This character was {context}, and he describes the Roman belief that they were 'the sons of a wolf'.\")\n\nfind_character()\n```\n<<<Thiodolf's foster-father>>>"
