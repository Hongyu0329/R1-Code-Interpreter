    "My plan is to answer the user's question by identifying the primary scientific figure whose work, specifically in the form of published lectures, heavily influenced Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\nIt is a well-known fact among historians of science that Einstein's paper, \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen,\" famously contained no formal citations or references to other scientific literature. However, his theoretical development was not created in a vacuum; it was deeply rooted in the principles of statistical mechanics established by his predecessors.\n\nThe most significant influence in this area was the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, whose \"Lectures on Gas Theory\" (*Vorlesungen über Gastheorie*) was a foundational text for statistical mechanics. Einstein studied Boltzmann's work thoroughly, and it provided the essential theoretical tools for his analysis of Brownian motion. Therefore, while not a formal \"citation\" in the modern sense, Boltzmann's lectures are the work the question is referring to.\n\nI will now provide the name of this physicist.\n\n```python\ndef get_cited_lecturer():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the lecturer whose work was foundational to Einstein's 1905 Brownian motion paper.\n    \"\"\"\n    # While Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion famously had no formal citations,\n    # his work was heavily based on the statistical mechanics developed by Ludwig Boltzmann,\n    # particularly the ideas presented in his \"Lectures on Gas Theory.\"\n    lecturer_name = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n    print(lecturer_name)\n\nget_cited_lecturer()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
