    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the User's Question:** The user is asking for the largest possible order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve defined over the specific number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n2.  **Recall Relevant Mathematical Theory:** This question belongs to the arithmetic of elliptic curves. The set of torsion points on an elliptic curve $E$ over a number field $K$, denoted $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$, forms a finite abelian group. The structure of this group is $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ where $m$ divides $n$. The group is non-cyclic if and only if $m > 1$. The order of the group is $mn$.\n\n3.  **Find the List of Possible Torsion Groups:** The possible torsion subgroup structures for elliptic curves over quadratic fields have been completely classified by the work of Kamienny, Kenku, Momose, and Parent. However, not all these structures can be realized over every quadratic field. We need the specific list for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This field is special because it is the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$, which allows for richer 3-torsion structures.\n\n4.  **Consult Authoritative Sources:** The most reliable sources for this information are recent research papers and curated databases like the LMFDB (L-functions and Modular Forms Database). I will rely on the \"Census of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields\" by Daniels, González-Jiménez, Lozano-Robledo, and Najman (2018), and cross-reference with the LMFDB. These sources provide a complete list of torsion subgroups that are known to occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n5.  **List the Non-Cyclic Torsion Groups for $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** Based on these sources, the non-cyclic torsion groups that can appear over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n    *   The groups that can appear over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (by Mazur's Torsion Theorem), which are $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n    *   Groups whose existence depends on the specific properties of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. These are $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Orders:** I will calculate the order for each of these possible non-cyclic groups. The order of $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ is $m \\times n$.\n\n7.  **Find the Maximum Order:** By comparing the orders calculated in the previous step, I can determine the largest one.\n\n8.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will write a Python script that encodes this list of groups, calculates their orders, prints out each calculation as requested, and identifies the maximum order.\n\nThis plan will lead directly to the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup\n    of an elliptic curve over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n\n    The solution is based on the complete classification of possible torsion subgroups\n    for elliptic curves over quadratic number fields, with a specific focus on\n    the field K = Q(sqrt(-3)).
