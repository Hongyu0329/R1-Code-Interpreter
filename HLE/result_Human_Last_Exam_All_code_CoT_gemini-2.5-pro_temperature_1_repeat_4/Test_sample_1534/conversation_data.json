    "This question requires specific neuroanatomical knowledge about the dwarf cuttlefish. A direct computational query to a live biological database is not feasible. Therefore, I will provide a Python script that contains this information from a knowledge base and prints the answer to your question.\n\nThe plan is to:\n1.  Store the names of the relevant brain regions in a list within the Python script.\n2.  Print a clear, descriptive sentence that answers the user's question, incorporating the names from the list.\n\n```python\ndef get_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the names of brain regions adjacent posteriorly\n    to the palliovisceral lobe in a cuttlefish.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The palliovisceral lobe is a very posterior part of the subesophageal mass.\n    # The regions located adjacent and posterior to it are primarily the fin lobes\n    # and the posterior chromatophore lobes, which control the fins and skin patterning, respectively.\n    adjacent_posterior_regions = [\"posterior chromatophore lobes\", \"fin lobes\"]\n\n    print(\"The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the:\")\n    for region in adjacent_posterior_regions:\n        print(f\"- {region}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
