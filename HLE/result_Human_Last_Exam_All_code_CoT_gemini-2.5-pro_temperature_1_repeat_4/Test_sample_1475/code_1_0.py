    print("  - X is a compact, connected metric space with more than one point (e.g., the interval [0, 1]).")

    print("  - The subspace Cnv(X) of 2^X consisting of all sets formed by a convergent sequence and its limit is a closed subset of 2^X, and thus is also a complete metric space.")
    print("  - P(X) is the subset of Cnv(X) for *non-trivially* convergent sequences. The sets in Cnv(X) but not in P(X) are the single-point sets {x}, which arise from trivial sequences (x_n = x).")
