# The riddle describes the order of five specific natural numbers.
# My task is to determine the numbers and arrange them in the correct sequence.

# 1. Identify the numbers from the clues.
# The riddle explicitly mentions "Number 1", "Number 2", "Number three", and "Number 4".
# A "fifth" number is described as one who "never had a thing", which points to the number 0.
# The set of numbers to be ordered is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

# 2. Place the numbers in a sequence based on positional clues.
# Let's define the sequence of five numbers.
sequence = [None, None, None, None, None]

# "Number 1 is the first..."
sequence[0] = 1

# "...the fifth, who never had a thing and lastly follows."
sequence[4] = 0

# "Number three is the strongest and it protects the last;"
# "Protects the last" means it is in the position right before the last number.
sequence[3] = 3

# "Number 4 likes two the most and it always goes behind."
# This implies a block of (2, 4). The only two remaining adjacent slots
# are the second and third positions.
sequence[1] = 2
sequence[2] = 4

# 3. Verify the sequence against all clues.
# The assembled sequence is [1, 2, 4, 3, 0].
# Let's check the descriptive clues:
# - "Number 1 is ... the weakest": In the set {1, 2, 3, 4} (the "bloodline"), 1 is the smallest. This fits.
# - "Number three is the strongest": This is the main puzzle, as 4 > 3.
# The riddle spells "three" differently. This hints that strength is based on the number of letters in the English word for the number.
# one (3), two (3), three (5), four (4).
# With 5 letters, "three" is the strongest, resolving the contradiction.

# 4. Print the final result.
# The code below will print each number of the final derived sequence.

print("Based on the riddle, the final ordered sequence of numbers is:")
print(f"{sequence[0]}, {sequence[1]}, {sequence[2]}, {sequence[3]}, {sequence[4]}")
