The primary conditions are that (X,d_X), (Y,d_Y), and (Z,d_Z) must be complete metric spaces, and the functions F, G, and H must satisfy Lipschitz-type conditions with non-negative constants (a_i, b_i, c_i) such that the following three inequalities hold: 1) a1 + b2 + c3 < 1, 2) a2 + b1 + c2 < 1, and 3) a3 + c1 < 1.
