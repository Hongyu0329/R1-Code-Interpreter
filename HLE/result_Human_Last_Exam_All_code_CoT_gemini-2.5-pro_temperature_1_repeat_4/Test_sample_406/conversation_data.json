    "Of course, I can help with that. The problem of finding a tripled fixed point requires concepts from the analysis of metric spaces, specifically a generalization of the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Clarify Notation**: The prompt asks for conditions for an `FGH-tripled fixed point` but defines the functions as `F`, `G`, and a second `G`. I will assume the second `G: Z*Y*X -> Z` was intended to be `H: Z*Y*X -> Z`, which is standard for this type of problem.\n2.  **Define Tripled Fixed Point**: A point `(x, y, z)` is an FGH-tripled fixed point if it simultaneously satisfies `F(x,y,z) = x`, `G(y,x,y) = y`, and `H(z,y,x) = z`.\n3.  **Apply Fixed-Point Theory**: The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are found by defining an operator on the product space `W = X × Y × Z` and finding the conditions under which this operator is a contraction mapping.\n4.  **Present Conditions via Python Script**: I will write a Python script that uses `print` statements to clearly outline the necessary assumptions (like complete metric spaces) and the final inequalities that the functions' Lipschitz constants must satisfy.\n\nHere is the Python script that outlines the conditions.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef explain_fgh_tripled_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n    It does not compute anything but prints the mathematical formulation and final conditions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"This script outlines the conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\")\n    print(\"---\")\n\n    # Step 1: Define the problem setup\n    print(\"\\n[1] Problem Definition\")\n    print(\"Let X, Y, and Z be sets.
