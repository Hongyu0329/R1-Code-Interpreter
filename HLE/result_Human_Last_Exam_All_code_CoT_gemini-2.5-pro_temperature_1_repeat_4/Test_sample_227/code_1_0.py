# Let d(t) be the distance at time t.
# We set d(0) = 0.

# From observer [0, 1], we have d(1) - d(0) = 1. So, d(1) = 1.
# The snail's path is non-decreasing, so for any t1 < t2, d(t1) <= d(t2).
# This means d(0) <= d(0.5) <= d(1), which is 0 <= d(0.5) <= 1.

# From observer [0.5, 1.5], we have d(1.5) - d(0.5) = 1.
# d(1.5) = 1 + d(0.5).
# To maximize d(1.5), we must maximize d(0.5).
# The max value for d(0.5) is 1.
d_0_5 = 1
d_1_5 = 1 + d_0_5

# We continue this with a chain of observers [t, t+1] where t = 1.5, 2.5, ...
# d(2.5) = 1 + d(1.5)
d_2_5 = 1 + d_1_5

d_4_5 = 1 + d_3_5
# d(5.5) = 1 + d(4.5)
d_5_5 = 1 + d_4_5
# d(6.5) = 1 + d(5.5)
d_6_5 = 1 + d_5_5

# Now we use the last observer on [6, 7].
# d(7) - d(6) = 1, so d(7) = 1 + d(6).
# To maximize d(7), we must maximize d(6).
# We know d(5.5) = 6 and d(6.5) = 7.
# Since the path is non-decreasing, d(5.5) <= d(6) <= d(6.5).
# So, 6 <= d(6) <= 7.
# The maximum possible value for d(6) is 7.
d_6 = 7

# Now we can find the maximum d(7).
d_7 = 1 + d_6

# The final equation is built by substituting the values back.
# d(7) = 1 + d(6)
# d(6) can be at most 7, derived from the chain of observers.
# The chain starts with d(0.5) being at most 1.
# d(1.5) = 1 + d(0.5) -> d(1.5) = 1 + 1 = 2
# d(2.5) = 1 + d(1.5) -> d(2.5) = 1 + 2 = 3
# d(3.5) = 1 + d(2.5) -> d(3.5) = 1 + 3 = 4
# d(4.5) = 1 + d(3.5) -> d(4.5) = 1 + 4 = 5
# d(5.5) = 1 + d(4.5) -> d(5.5) = 1 + 5 = 6
# d(6.5) = 1 + d(5.5) -> d(6.5) = 1 + 6 = 7
# And d(7) = 1 + d(6) -> d(7) = 1 + 7 = 8
