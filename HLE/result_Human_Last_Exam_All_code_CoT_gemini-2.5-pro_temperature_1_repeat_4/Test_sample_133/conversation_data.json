    "To solve this Connect 4 puzzle, I will find all the moves for player 'O' that guarantee a win in the shortest possible number of turns.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board**: I'll represent the given board state and identify all legal moves for 'O'. A move is legal if the column is not full.\n2.  **Check for Immediate Wins**: I will check if any legal move results in an immediate win (a line of 4 'O's). This would be a win in 1 turn.\n3.  **Check for Forced Wins**: If no immediate win exists, I'll look for moves that set up a \"forced win\". This typically means creating two threats at once, where the opponent can only block one, allowing 'O' to win on the next turn. This would be a win in 2 turns for 'O'.\n4.  **Evaluate Threats**: I need to consider both 'O's potential winning lines and 'X's threats. The optimal move for 'O' must create a winning opportunity while not allowing 'X' to win first.\n    *   **'O's Threat**: There is a key diagonal of three 'O's at `c6`, `d5`, and `e4`. This line can be completed to four by placing a piece at `f3`. However, the `f3` spot is not available yet; `f4` must be played first.\n    *   **'X's Threat**: There is a diagonal of two 'X's at `d6` and `e5`. If 'X' plays at `f4`, it creates a line of three 'X's, threatening a win at `g3`.\n5.  **Identify Optimal Moves**: I will analyze each legal move for 'O' to see if it leads to a forced win. A move is optimal if it leads to a win in the minimum number of turns. After analyzing all possibilities, it turns out there are two moves that force a win on O's second turn.\n6.  **Code and Output**: I will write a Python script that encapsulates this logic to determine and print the optimal moves in the format `c4, f4, ...`.\n\n```python\ndef find_optimal_moves():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the specific Connect 4 board state to find the optimal moves for 'O'.\n\n    An optimal move is one that leads to a win as fast as possible.\n\n    The analysis is based on the following key board features:\n    - O-Threat: A diagonal of three 'O's (c6, d5, e4) threatens a win at f3.\n               This requires the f4 spot to be filled first.\n    - X-Threat: A diagonal of two 'X's (d6, e5) threatens to become a line of three\n               if X plays at f4, which would then threaten a win for X at g3.\n\n    We will analyze O's legal moves (c4, f4, etc.) to see which ones secure a win.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Analysis of move 'c4':\n    # 1. O plays c4. This creates a horizontal line of three O's (c4, d4, e4).\n    # 2. X MUST block this threat by playing at f4. If X plays anywhere else, O wins by playing f4.\n    # 3. After X plays f4, the spot f3 becomes available.\n    # 4. O can now play f3 to complete the diagonal (c6, d5, e4, f3) and win.\n    # This is a forced win for O on their next turn.\n    move1 = \"c4\"\n\n    # Analysis of move 'f4':\n    # 1. O plays f4. This move simultaneously:\n    #    a) Blocks X's potential threat on the d6-e5 diagonal.\n    #    b) Creates a horizontal line of three O's (d4, e4, f4).\n    # 2. X MUST block this horizontal threat by playing at either c4 or g4.\n    # 3. Whichever move X makes, the spot f3 is now available for O.\n    # 4. O can play f3 to complete the diagonal (c6, d5, e4, f3) and win.\n    # This is also a forced win for O on their next turn.\n    move2 = \"f4\"\n    \n    # Other moves are suboptimal because they either lead to a slower win or allow X\n    # to play f4, creating a winning threat for X that leads to O losing.\n    # Since both 'c4' and 'f4' lead to a win in the same number of turns (2),\n    # they are both optimal.\n\n    optimal_moves = sorted([move1, move2])\n    \n    print(\", \".join(optimal_moves))\n\nfind_optimal_moves()\n```\n<<<c4, f4>>>"
