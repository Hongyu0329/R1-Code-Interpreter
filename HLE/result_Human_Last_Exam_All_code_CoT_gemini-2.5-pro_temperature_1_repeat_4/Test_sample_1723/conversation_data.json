    "This is a classic mycology trivia question that plays on a common misconception. The color of a mushroom's cap or flesh is often different from the color of its spore print. While there are several mushrooms with a striking blue color, such as *Entoloma hochstetteri*, their spore prints are not blue (the *Entoloma* genus has a pink spore print).\n\nThe genus most likely being referred to in this question is *Lactarius*. This is because of the species *Lactarius indigo*, commonly known as the indigo milk cap. It is a vibrant blue mushroom that \"bleeds\" a blue latex-like milk when cut. However, even this mushroom does not have a blue spore print; its spore print is actually a yellowish-cream color.\n\nGiven the nature of the riddle, *Lactarius* is the intended answer because it is the most famous genus containing a distinctly blue mushroom, even if the spore print detail is technically incorrect.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print the name of this genus.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mushroom_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the riddle about the mushroom\n    genus known for a blue color.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The question is a bit of a trick. The genus known for a famous blue\n    # mushroom is Lactarius (specifically Lactarius indigo).\n    # However, its spore print is actually cream/yellow, not blue.\n    # No known mushroom genus produces a true blue spore print.\n    # Lactarius is the most common answer to this riddle.\n    genus_name = \"Lactarius\"\n    print(f\"The genus of mushroom that is likely the answer to this riddle is: {genus_name}\")\n\nsolve_mushroom_riddle()\n```\n<<<Lactarius>>>"
