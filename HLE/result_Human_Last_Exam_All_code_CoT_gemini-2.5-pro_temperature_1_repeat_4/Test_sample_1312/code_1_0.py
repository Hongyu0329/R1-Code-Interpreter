        'A': 'Tandem repeats',
        'B': 'Chromosomal inversions',

    # Step 1: Understand the problem.
    # The question asks for a feature that helps a genome resist decay when recombination is low.
    # Low recombination means deleterious mutations can't be easily shuffled away and accumulate (Muller's ratchet).
    explanation = "Reasoning:\n"
    explanation += "1. Limited recombination leads to the accumulation of harmful mutations, a process known as genetic deterioration or Muller's ratchet.\n"
    explanation += "2. A compensatory mechanism must counteract this accumulation.\n"
    explanation += "3. We evaluate the options:\n"
    explanation += "   - A (Tandem repeats) and C (Transposable elements) introduce variation, but not in a way that systematically repairs or masks deleterious mutations.\n"
    explanation += "   - B (Chromosomal inversions) actually suppresses recombination, exacerbating the problem.\n"
    explanation += "   - E (Polyploidy) provides redundancy by adding whole sets of chromosomes, which can compensate. However, it's a large-scale change.\n"
    explanation += "   - D (Multigene families) are sets of duplicated genes. This feature provides a direct and elegant solution:\n"
    explanation += "     a) Redundancy: If one gene copy is inactivated by a mutation, other functional copies can compensate.\n"
    explanation += "     b) Gene Conversion: The cell can use a functional gene copy as a template to 'repair' a mutated copy, effectively reversing the mutation. This process acts as a substitute for recombination.\n"
    explanation += "Therefore, multigene families are the best-described intrinsic feature for this purpose.\n"
