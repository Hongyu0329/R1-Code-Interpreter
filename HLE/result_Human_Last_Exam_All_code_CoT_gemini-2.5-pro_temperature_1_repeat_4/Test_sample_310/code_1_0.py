    # Step 1: Define the properties of an OAM laser beam.
    # An OAM beam has a helical wavefront and a donut-shaped intensity profile.

    # Step 2: Determine the effect of this profile on the proton beam's shape.
    # A standard Gaussian beam creates a central hot spot, leading to a relatively collimated proton beam.
    # The annular profile of an OAM beam creates a ring-shaped electron sheath.
    # This non-uniform sheath field accelerates protons into a hollow or diverging structure.
    # This effect is best described as dispersion, not collimation.
    effect_on_beam_shape = "Dispersion"

    # Step 3: Determine the effect on proton energy.
    # Proton energy is proportional to the hot electron temperature, which scales with laser intensity.
    # For a fixed total laser energy, spreading it over a ring (OAM beam)
    # results in lower peak intensity compared to focusing it on a single spot (Gaussian beam).
    # Lower intensity -> Lower electron temperature -> Lower proton acceleration.
    effect_on_proton_energy = "Proton Energy Decreases"
