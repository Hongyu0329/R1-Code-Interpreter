    # Principle: Covalency is directly related to orbital overlap.
    principle = "The strength of covalency in a chemical bond is directly proportional to the extent of orbital overlap. Greater overlap allows for more effective sharing of electron density, resulting in a stronger covalent character."

    # Given information from the problem.
    observation = "It is given that the orbital overlap between the cerium Ce(IV) 4f orbitals and the fluorine F 2p orbitals in CeF6²⁻ is greater than the overlap between the Ce(IV) 4f orbitals and the chlorine Cl 3p orbitals in CeCl6²⁻."

    # Conclusion based on the principle and observation.
    conclusion = "Because CeF6²⁻ has greater orbital overlap, it will therefore display stronger covalency compared to CeCl6²⁻."
