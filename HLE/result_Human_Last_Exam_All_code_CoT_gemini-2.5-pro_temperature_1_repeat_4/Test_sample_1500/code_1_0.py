    # Explanation for part (a)
    explanation_a = """(a) True or false: Every coadjoint orbit \\( \\mathcal{O}_{\\lambda} \\) of \\( G \\) admits a compatible complex structure, making it a Kähler manifold.

Explanation: This statement is **True**.
A coadjoint orbit \\( \\mathcal{O}_{\\lambda} \\) is a homogeneous space \\( G/G_{\\lambda} \\), where \\( G_{\\lambda} \\) is the stabilizer of \\( \\lambda \\). A key result states that a homogeneous space \\( G/K \\) of a compact Lie group \\( G \\) admits a \\( G \\)-invariant complex structure if and only if the stabilizer subgroup \\( K \\) contains a maximal torus of \\( G \\).
For any \\( \\lambda \\) in the dual of the Lie algebra of a maximal torus \\( T \\), \\( \\mathfrak{t}^* \\), the stabilizer \\( G_{\\lambda} \\) will always contain \\( T \\) because \\( T \\) is abelian. Since every coadjoint orbit can be represented this way, every orbit \\( \\mathcal{O}_{\\lambda} \\) admits a \\( G \\)-invariant complex structure.
Given that \\( \\mathcal{O}_{\\lambda} \\) is already a symplectic manifold with the Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau form, the existence of a compatible, invariant complex structure ensures it can be endowed with a Kähler metric.

    # Explanation for part (b)
    explanation_b = """(b) For \\( G = \\operatorname{SU}(n) \\), with \\( \\lambda \\) in the Weyl alcove, is the second Betti number \\( b_2(\\mathcal{O}_{\\lambda}) \\) always given by \\( n - 1 \\)?

Explanation: This statement is **No**.
The formula \\( b_2 = n - 1 \\) holds if \\( \\lambda \\) is a regular element (in the interior of the Weyl alcove), where the orbit is the full flag manifold \\( \\operatorname{SU}(n)/T \\) and \\( \\operatorname{rank}(\\operatorname{SU}(n)) = n-1 \\).
However, the Weyl alcove includes the boundary, which corresponds to singular elements. Let's consider a counterexample for \\( n=3 \\).
The proposed formula gives \\( b_2 = 3 - 1 = 2 \\).
Now, consider a singular element \\( \\lambda \\) whose stabilizer is \\( G_{\\lambda} = \\operatorname{S(U(2)} \\times \\operatorname{U(1))} \\). The orbit \\( \\mathcal{O}_{\\lambda} \\) is the Grassmannian \\( \\operatorname{Gr}(2, 3) \\), which is isomorphic to the complex projective plane \\( \\mathbb{CP}^2 \\).
The second Betti number of \\( \\mathbb{CP}^2 \\) is \\( b_2(\\mathbb{CP}^2) = 1 \\).
Since we found a case where the Betti number is 1, and the formula predicted 2, the statement is not always true.
Final Equation Check: For n=3, the predicted value is 2. The calculated value for a singular orbit is 1. Since 1 != 2, the answer is No.
"""

    # Explanation for part (c)
    explanation_c = """(c) If \\( \\mathcal{O}_{\lambda} \\) is endowed with a natural equivariant Kähler metric, must the corresponding equivariant cohomology ring \\( H_G^*(\mathcal{O}_{\lambda}; \\mathbb{R}) \\) be isomorphic to the cohomology ring of a GKM graph (Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson graph)?

Explanation: This statement is **Yes**.
The GKM theory provides a combinatorial description of the \\( T \\)-equivariant cohomology \\( H_T^*(M; \\mathbb{R}) \\) for certain manifolds \\( M \\) where a torus \\( T \\) acts. For any coadjoint orbit \\( \\mathcal{O}_{\\lambda} \\), it is known that its \\( T \\)-equivariant cohomology ring \\( H_T^*(\mathcal{O}_{\\lambda}; \\mathbb{R}) \\) has a GKM description. This means it is isomorphic to a specific ring of functions defined on the GKM graph (whose vertices are the \\( T \\)-fixed points).
The \\( G \\)-equivariant cohomology \\( H_G^*(\mathcal{O}_{\lambda}; \\mathbb{R}) \\) is the subring of \\( H_T^*(\mathcal{O}_{\lambda}; \\mathbb{R}) \\) consisting of elements invariant under the action of the Weyl group \\( W \\). As \\( H_T^* \\) is determined by the GKM graph, so is its \\( W \\)-invariant subring \\( H_G^* \\). Therefore, the structure of \\( H_G^*(\mathcal{O}_{\lambda}; \\mathbb{R}) \\) is fundamentally described by the GKM graph.
