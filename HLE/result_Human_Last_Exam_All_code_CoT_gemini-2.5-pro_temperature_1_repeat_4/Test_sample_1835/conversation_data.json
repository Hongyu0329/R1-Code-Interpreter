    "My plan is to first address the philosophical question about Gareth Evans's Generality Constraint. I will break down what the constraint entails and how it applies to the relationship between understanding a specific proposition (`Fa`) and a universally quantified one (`∀x Fx`), given the user's assumptions.\n\nNext, as per the instructions, I will create a Python script that demonstrates a simple calculation. The prompt requires the script to output an equation showing all the numbers involved. I will define two numbers, perform a calculation, and then print the full equation using an f-string. This fulfills the coding requirement of the prompt.\n\n**Answer to the philosophical question:**\n\nYes. According to the spirit of Evans's Generality Constraint (GC), if you understand the proposition `Fa` and you also understand the logic of universal quantification (`∀`), you should be able to understand `∀x Fx`. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1.  **The Role of the Generality Constraint:** The GC posits that thought is structured and compositional. If you understand `Fa` (e.g., \"Socrates is mortal\"), you don't just grasp it as an indivisible chunk of information. Instead, you grasp the components: the concept of the object `a` (Socrates) and the concept of the predicate `F` (being mortal). The constraint states that you should then be able to recombine this predicate `F` with any other object concept you possess (e.g., to form \"Plato is mortal\"). The crucial takeaway is that understanding `Fa` gives you an independent, reusable grasp of the predicate `F`.\n\n2.  **Combining with Universal Quantification:** You have stipulated that you already understand universal quantification (`∀`), which is the logical concept of \"for all things\" or \"everything\".\n\n3.  **Synthesis:** Since understanding `Fa` provides you with the concept of the predicate `F`, and you already possess the conceptual machinery of the universal quantifier `∀`, you have all the necessary components to form the new thought `∀x Fx` (\"Everything is F\"). You can take the predicate \"being mortal\" and apply the \"for all things\" operator to it.\n\nTherefore, while the GC's primary focus is on recombining predicates with different singular terms, its underlying principle of compositionality supports the idea that once a concept (like `F`) is grasped, it can be used in any other appropriate conceptual structure you understand, including quantification.\n\n```python\n# This script demonstrates a simple calculation and prints the\n# full equation as requested.\n\n# Define the numbers for the equation\nnum1 = 25\nnum2 = 4\n\n# Perform a multiplication\nresult = num1 * num2\n\n# Print the final equation, showing each number involved.\nprint(f\"Here is a sample equation: {num1} * {num2} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<Yes>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Assuming Gareth Evan's Generality Constraint, if I understand a proposition Fa, should I be able to understand Fx (\\forall x)?
