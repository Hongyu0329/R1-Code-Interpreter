    "Based on historical context, the quote refers to Pavel Milyukov's criticism of an early 20th-century Russian avant-garde art group. This group, heavily influenced by Western European modern art, was known as the \"Jack of Diamonds\" (in Russian, Бубновый валет). Milyukov, being a classical liberal and historian, held conservative views on art and was critical of such radical movements.\n\nMy plan is to create a Python script that explicitly defines X and Y as \"Jack\" and \"Diamonds\" respectively, and then prints the full term to answer the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the term \"X-Y\" based on historical context\n    related to Pavel Milyukov's cultural criticisms.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Pavel Milyukov, a Russian politician and historian, was critical of\n    # the avant-garde art movements of his time.
