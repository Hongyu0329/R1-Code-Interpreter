# This script calculates the minimum number of forward passes required
# for an LLM to evaluate an 8-choice multiple choice question with a specific structure.

# --- Problem Definition ---
# Number of choices that are a single token.
num_single_token_choices = 4
# Number of choices that are more than one token.
num_multi_token_choices = 4

# To find the MINIMAL number of passes, we assume the shortest possible length
# for the multi-token choices. "more than one output token" means the minimum length is 2.
min_tokens_in_multi_choice = 2


# --- Step-by-Step Calculation ---

# Step 1: The Initial Forward Pass
# We perform one forward pass on the initial prompt (the multiple-choice question).
# This single pass calculates the probability distribution over the entire vocabulary for the next token.
# This is enough to evaluate all single-token answers.
# It also gives us the probability of the *first* token for all multi-token answers.
passes_for_prompt = 1

print(f"A. Initial Pass:")
print(f"   - We need {passes_for_prompt} forward pass on the prompt.")
print(f"   - This single pass is sufficient to evaluate all {num_single_token_choices} single-token choices.")
print(f"   - It also gives us the probability of the first token for all {num_multi_token_choices} multi-token choices.")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 2: Passes for Multi-Token Choices
# For each multi-token answer, we need to calculate the probability of its subsequent tokens.
# Assuming each of the 4 multi-token answers has the minimum length of 2 tokens,
# we need to calculate the probability of the second token for each of them.
# This requires a new, separate forward pass for each of the 4 answers.
# For example, for an answer (T1, T2), after the initial pass gives us P(T1|prompt),
# we need a second pass on (prompt + T1) to find P(T2|prompt, T1).
additional_passes_per_multi_choice = min_tokens_in_multi_choice - 1
total_additional_passes = num_multi_token_choices * additional_passes_per_multi_choice

print(f"B. Additional Passes for Multi-Token Choices:")
print(f"   - Each of the {num_multi_token_choices} multi-token choices requires ({min_tokens_in_multi_choice} - 1) = {additional_passes_per_multi_choice} additional pass(es).")
print(f"   - Total additional passes = {num_multi_token_choices} choices * {additional_passes_per_multi_choice} pass/choice = {total_additional_passes} passes.")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 3: Total Calculation
# The total minimal number of passes is the sum of the initial pass and the
# additional passes needed for all the multi-token choices.
total_passes = passes_for_prompt + total_additional_passes

print("C. Final Calculation:")
print("   The total is the sum of the initial pass and the additional passes.")
print("\nFinal Equation:")
# Output the final equation with each number explicitly shown.
print(f"{passes_for_prompt} + {num_multi_token_choices} * ({min_tokens_in_multi_choice} - 1) = {total_passes}")

# The script's output ends here for clarity. The final answer is extracted below.
# To output the answer in the required format, we write it to stderr to separate it
# from the explanatory script output.
