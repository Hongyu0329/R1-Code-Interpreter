def solve_hopf_action_problem():
    """
    Solves the three-part problem about Hopf algebra actions.

    The solution is derived as follows:
    - (a) The term 'symmetric' is not defined, and the premises on `1_R` are insufficient
      to prove a general property for an arbitrary element `r`. Thus, the answer is 'No'.
    - (b) We evaluate the formula for j=2 and q=-1. The q-binomial coefficient `binom(2,1)_{-1}`
      is 0, which makes the k=1 term disappear.
      - k=0 coefficient: (-1)^0 * (-1)^0 * binom(2,0)_{-1} = 1.
      - k=1 coefficient: 0.
      - k=2 coefficient: (-1)^2 * (-1)^(-1) * binom(2,2)_{-1} = -1.
      The result is the sum of the k=0 and k=2 terms.
    - (c) We evaluate the formula for j=3. The condition `w in Z(R)` allows us to factor
      out `w^3` to the left. The expression is then `w^3` times the sum of coefficients
      multiplied by the action term `(g^k a . 1_R)`.
      The q-binomial coefficients are:
      - binom(3,0)_{q^-1} = 1
      - binom(3,1)_{q^-1} = 1 + q^-1 + q^-2
      - binom(3,2)_{q^-1} = 1 + q^-1 + q^-2
      - binom(3,3)_{q^-1} = 1
      The full coefficients in the sum are calculated and assembled into the final expression.
