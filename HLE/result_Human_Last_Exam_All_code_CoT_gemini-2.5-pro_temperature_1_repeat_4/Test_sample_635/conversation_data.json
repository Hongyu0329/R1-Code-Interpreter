    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given transfer function `H(s)`:** I will first identify the poles of the system by looking at the denominators of the elements in the matrix `H(s)`. The stability of the system is determined by the location of these poles in the complex plane. A pole `p` is unstable if its real part is non-negative (Re(p) â‰¥ 0).\n\n2.  **Determine the structure of `D(s)`:** A left coprime factorization is of the form `H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s)`, which is equivalent to `D(s)H(s) = N(s)`. The goal is to find a matrix `D(s)` such that both `D(s)` and `N(s) = D(s)H(s)` consist of stable and proper rational functions. I will construct `D(s)` to specifically cancel the unstable poles present in `H(s)`. I'll look for the simplest form for `D(s)`, starting with a diagonal matrix.\n\n3.  **Construct `D(s)`:** I will examine each row of `H(s)`. If a row is already stable, the corresponding row in `D(s)` can be made simple (e.g., `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`). If a row of `H(s)` contains an unstable pole, I will design the corresponding row in `D(s)` to introduce a zero at the location of the unstable pole, thus canceling it out in the product `N(s)`. The elements of `D(s)` must also be stable and proper.\n\n4.  **Calculate `N(s)`:** Once `D(s)` is determined, I will compute `N(s) = D(s)H(s)`.\n\n5.  **Verification:** I will implicitly verify that the resulting `D(s)` and `N(s)` matrices meet the conditions for a left coprime factorization (stability and properness).\n\n6.  **Python Implementation:** I will use the `sympy` library in Python to perform the symbolic matrix calculations and present the final `D(s)` and `N(s)` matrices as the solution. The code will print out each element of the final matrices as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_left_coprime_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a left coprime factorization of the transfer function H(s).\n    The factorization is of the form H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the transfer function matrix H(s)\n    H = sympy.Matrix([\n        [(s - 1) / (s + 1), 1],\n        [2 / (s**2 - 1), 0]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"Given the transfer function H(s):\")\n    sympy.pprint(H, use_unicode=False)\n    print(\"\\nWe want to find a left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze H(s) for unstable poles.\n    # The denominators are (s+1) and (s^2 - 1) = (s-1)(s+1).\n    # The poles are at s = -1 (stable) and s = 1 (unstable).\n    # The unstable pole at s=1 appears in the H[1,0] element.\n\n    # Step 2: Construct D(s) to cancel the instability.\n    # The first row of H(s) is composed of stable and proper functions, so we can\n    # choose the first row of D(s) to be [1, 0] which leaves the first row of N(s) stable.\n    # The second row of H(s) contains the unstable pole.
