    """
    This function solves a topology problem by reasoning about the properties of the space X.
    The goal is to find the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for X.
    """

    # The problem describes a compact topological space X with two properties:
    # 1. X contains a dense copy of the long ray R = [0, omega_1).
    #    This means X is a "compactification" of R.
    # 2. Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to a unique continuous function on X.
    #    This is a crucial universal property.

    # The two properties given are the defining properties of the Stone-Čech compactification
    # of the space R, denoted as beta-R.
    # The Stone-Čech compactification beta-Y of a Tychonoff space Y is a compact Hausdorff space that is characterized
    # by the universal property that any continuous map from Y to any compact Hausdorff space K
    # extends uniquely to a continuous map from beta-Y to K. The property given in the problem
    # is a well-known equivalent formulation of this universal property.

    # A fundamental theorem in topology states that the Stone-Čech compactification of a
    # Tychonoff space is unique up to a unique homeomorphism that fixes the original space pointwise.
    # This means that if we have two spaces, X1 and X2, that both satisfy the given properties,
    # then there must exist a homeomorphism between X1 and X2.

    # Therefore, all spaces X satisfying the conditions of the problem belong to the
    # same homeomorphism class.

    # The question asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes.
    # Since all such spaces are homeomorphic, there is only one class.
    num_homeomorphism_classes = 1

    # Final answer is the number of classes.
    # The final equation is simply that the number of classes is 1.
    print("The number of distinct homeomorphism classes is:")
    print(f"{num_homeomorphism_classes}")
