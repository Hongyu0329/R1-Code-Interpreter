    "Of course. Here is a plan to find the answer and present it using a Python script.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  The user's question is a literary trivia question about a specific quote from Jorge Luis Borges. This requires looking up information rather than performing a calculation.\n2.  I will create a Python script that simulates a database lookup.\n3.  The script will store the relevant information—the author (Juan Carlos Onetti), the novel (*El astillero* / *The Shipyard*), and Borges's description—in a dictionary.\n4.  The script will then retrieve and print this information in a clear, readable format to answer the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef find_borges_reference():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function contains the information about the novel and author\n    Jorge Luis Borges described with the specific quote.\n    It simulates a lookup and prints the answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A small knowledge base storing the answer\n    reference_data = {\n        \"author\": \"Juan Carlos Onetti\",\n        \"novel\": \"El astillero (The Shipyard)\",\n        \"description\": \"A continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\",\n        \"quote\": \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Jorge Luis Borges was referring to the following novel and author:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"Author: {reference_data['author']}\")\n    print(f\"Novel: {reference_data['novel']}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"Borges described the author as: '{reference_data['description']}'.\")\n    print(f\"He described the novel's plot as having: '{reference_data['quote']}'.\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the information\nfind_borges_reference()\n```\n<<<El astillero (The Shipyard)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
