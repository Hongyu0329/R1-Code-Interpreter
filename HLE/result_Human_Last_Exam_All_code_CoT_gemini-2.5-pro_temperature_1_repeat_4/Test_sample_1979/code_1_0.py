    # Step 1: Analyze the definition of the set Σ and the condition A+A ⊆ A × A.
    # The set A is a finite subset of positive integers (ℤ_{>0}).
    # A+A is the sumset, defined as {a + b | a ∈ A, b ∈ A}. Its elements are integers.
    # A × A is the Cartesian product, defined as {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ A}. Its elements are ordered pairs.
    print("Step 1: Analyze the condition A+A ⊆ A × A")
    print("  - The set A is a finite subset of positive integers.")
    print("  - The set A+A contains sums of elements from A, which are integers.")
    print("  - The set A × A contains ordered pairs of elements from A.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 2: Evaluate the subset condition.
    # Under standard mathematical definitions, the set of integers and the set of ordered pairs of integers are disjoint.
    # An object cannot be both an integer and an ordered pair.
    # For the condition A+A ⊆ A × A to hold, the set A+A must not contain any elements that are not in A × A.
    # Since the sets are disjoint, this implies that A+A must be the empty set.
    print("Step 2: Evaluate the condition")
    print("  - Integers and ordered pairs are fundamentally different types of mathematical objects.")
    print("  - The set of integers and the set of ordered pairs are disjoint.")
    print("  - For the subset condition to be true, the sumset A+A must be empty.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 3: Determine the nature of set A.
    # The sumset A+A is empty if and only if the set A itself is empty.
    # Therefore, the only set A satisfying the condition is the empty set, A = ∅.
    print("Step 3: Determine the nature of A")
    print("  - If A+A = ∅, then A must be ∅.")
    print("  - Let's verify: If A = ∅, then A+A = ∅ and A × A = ∅. The condition ∅ ⊆ ∅ is true.")
    print("  - So, the only set satisfying the condition is the empty set.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 4: Construct the set Σ.
    # The problem defines Σ as the set of all valid A's, with ∅ and {2} removed.
    # Since the only valid A is ∅, the initial set is {∅}.
    # Σ = {∅} \ {∅, {2}}
    # Removing ∅ from {∅} results in an empty set.
    print("Step 4: Construct the set Σ")
    print("  - The set of all A satisfying the criteria is {∅}.")
    print("  - Σ is defined as {A} \\ {∅, {2}}.")
    print("  - Therefore, Σ = {∅} \\ {∅, {2}} = ∅.")
    print("  - The set Σ is empty.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 5: Compute the final result.
    # The problem asks to compute a value if Σ is not empty, but to return 0 if Σ is empty.
    # Since Σ is empty, the result is 0.
    result = 0
    print("Step 5: Compute the final result")
    print("  - The problem asks to return 0 if Σ is empty.")
    print(f"  - Since Σ is empty, the final result is {result}.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # There is no equation with numbers to calculate, the result is derived from logical deduction.
    # We present the final numerical answer.
