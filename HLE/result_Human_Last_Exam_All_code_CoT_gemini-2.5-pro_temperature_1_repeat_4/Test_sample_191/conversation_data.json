    "The user is asking a biological question about a specific protein involved in the immune response to amyloid plaques. I will identify the protein based on current scientific understanding of macrophage and microglia activity.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the key biological process: Macrophage engulfment (phagocytosis) of amyloid, which is a hallmark of diseases like Alzheimer's.\n2.  Recall the primary inhibitory signal that prevents macrophages from engulfing cells or other targets. This is known as the \"don't eat me\" signal.\n3.  The protein responsible for this signal is CD47. When CD47 on a target binds to the SIRPα receptor on a macrophage, it prevents engulfment.\n4.  Research has shown that blocking the CD47 signal enhances the ability of microglia (the brain's resident macrophages) to clear amyloid plaques. Therefore, the breakdown or inhibition of CD47 allows for this process.\n5.  I will create a simple Python script to state this information clearly. The script will store the protein's name in a variable and then print an explanatory sentence.\n\n```python\ndef identify_protein():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the role of the protein that, when inhibited,\n    allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The protein that functions as a \"don't eat me\" signal.\n    protein_name = \"CD47\"\n\n    # Print the explanation.\n    print(f\"The protein that, when broken down or blocked, allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid is {protein_name}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nExplanation: {protein_name} acts as a 'don't eat me' signal. When it is present and active on a target (like an amyloid plaque or a cell), it binds to a receptor on macrophages called SIRPα, which prevents the macrophage from engulfing the target. Blocking this {protein_name} signal removes the inhibition, thereby promoting the clearance of amyloid by macrophages (and microglia in the brain).\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer.\nidentify_protein()\n```\n<<<CD47>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
