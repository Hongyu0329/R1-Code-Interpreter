When it is present and active on a target (like an amyloid plaque or a cell), it binds to a receptor on macrophages called SIRPÎ±, which prevents the macrophage from engulfing the target. Blocking this {protein_name} signal removes the inhibition, thereby promoting the clearance of amyloid by macrophages (and microglia in the brain).")
