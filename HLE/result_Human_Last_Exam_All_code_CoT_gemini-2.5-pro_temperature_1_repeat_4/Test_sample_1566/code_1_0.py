    This function encapsulates the result of the topological deduction.

    The problem asks for the number of topologically distinct continua X satisfying two properties:
    1. X has n > 1 finite end points.
    2. X has exactly two orbits under the action of its auto-homeomorphism group.

    Our step-by-step analysis concluded:
    - The two orbits must be the set of end points (E) and the set of non-end points (I).
    - The homogeneity of the interior I implies it is homeomorphic to the real line R.
    - X is therefore a compactification of R with n end points.
    - The requirement that E is a single orbit restricts n to be 2.
    - The two-point compactification of R is topologically unique and is the closed interval [0,1].

    Therefore, there is only one such continuum.
