    "To determine the total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we need to count the unique players who have achieved this feat for both batting and pitching.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define the MLB Triple Crown for both batters (leading the league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs) and pitchers (leading the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA).\n2.  Create a list of all unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown.\n3.  Create a list of all unique players who have won the pitching Triple Crown.\n4.  Count the number of players in each list.\n5.  Sum these two counts to find the total number of unique Triple Crown winners.\n6.  The Python code will store these lists, calculate their lengths, and print the final equation and answer.\n\n```python\ndef count_mlb_triple_crown_winners():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the total number of unique MLB Triple Crown winners.\n    A Triple Crown is won by a batter leading their league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs,\n    or a pitcher leading their league in wins, ERA, and strikeouts.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # List of unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown\n    # Note: Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams each won it twice.\n    batting_winners = [\n        \"Paul Hines\", \"Tip O'Neill\", \"Hugh Duffy\", \"Nap Lajoie\", \"Ty Cobb\",\n        \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"Chuck Klein\", \"Jimmie Foxx\", \"Lou Gehrig\", \"Joe Medwick\",\n        \"Ted Williams\", \"Mickey Mantle\", \"Frank Robinson\", \"Carl Yastrzemski\", \"Miguel Cabrera\"\n    ]\n\n    # List of unique players who have won the pitching Triple Crown\n    # Note: Several pitchers won it multiple times (e.g., Koufax, Johnson, Alexander).\n    pitching_winners = [\n        \"Tommy Bond\", \"Old Hoss Radbourn\", \"Tim Keefe\", \"John Clarkson\", \"Amos Rusie\",\n        \"Cy Young\", \"Rube Waddell\", \"Christy Mathewson\", \"Walter Johnson\", \"Pete Alexander\",\n        \"Dazzy Vance\", \"Lefty Grove\", \"Lefty Gomez\", \"Bucky Walters\", \"Bob Feller\",\n        \"Hal Newhouser\", \"Sandy Koufax\", \"Steve Carlton\", \"Pedro Mart√≠nez\", \"Randy Johnson\",\n        \"Johan Santana\", \"Clayton Kershaw\", \"Justin Verlander\", \"Shane Bieber\"\n    ]\n\n    num_batting_winners = len(batting_winners)\n    num_pitching_winners = len(pitching_winners)\n    total_winners = num_batting_winners + num_pitching_winners\n\n    print(f\"There have been {num_batting_winners} unique batting Triple Crown winners.\")\n    print(f\"There have been {num_pitching_winners} unique pitching Triple Crown winners.\")\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total number of unique winners, we add these two numbers together:\")\n    print(f\"{num_batting_winners} + {num_pitching_winners} = {total_winners}\")\n\ncount_mlb_triple_crown_winners()\n```\n<<<39>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
