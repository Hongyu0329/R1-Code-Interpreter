    This function determines the truth value of six statements about parenthesis strings.
    
    My step-by-step reasoning:
    1.  I analyzed the relationship between L(x) and D(x), noting that L(x) >= 2D(x).
    2.  I interpreted the clarification about logs to mean that log(z) should be treated as max(1, log(z)) everywhere to ensure expressions are well-defined. This is crucial for statements 1-3.
    3.  For each statement, I tested it against two primary families of counterexamples:
        a) Flat strings: S = (()...()), which maximize L/D for the outer pair but have many simple inner pairs.
        b) Deep strings: S = ((...())), where L is proportional to D for all pairs.
    4.  Statement 1 (log L vs log D): The 'log*' interpretation makes the sums for the flat string family asymptotically equal. True.
    5.  Statement 2 (loglog L vs loglog D): Similar to statement 1, the 'log*' interpretation makes the sums for the flat string family asymptotically equal. True.
    6.  Statement 3 (log^5 L vs log^5 D): Similar to statement 1, the 'log*' interpretation makes the sums for the flat string family asymptotically equal. True.
    7.  Statement 4 (2^sqrt(log L) vs 2^O(sqrt(log D))): The function grows very slowly (sub-polynomially), which dampens the differences between L and D. No counterexample was found. True.
    8.  Statement 5 (L^0.1 vs D^0.11): I constructed a more complex counterexample by nesting a very wide but shallow string inside a deep but narrow one. By carefully choosing the width (k) as a function of depth (m) (k=m^a where 1.1 < a < 10/9), I showed the ratio of the sums can grow infinitely. False.
    9.  Statement 6 (L^0.25 vs D^0.5): The exponent on D is significantly larger than on L. My counterexample generator for statement 5 failed here, showing the ratio goes to zero. True.
    
    The final conclusion for each statement is encoded in the string 'TTTFTT'.
