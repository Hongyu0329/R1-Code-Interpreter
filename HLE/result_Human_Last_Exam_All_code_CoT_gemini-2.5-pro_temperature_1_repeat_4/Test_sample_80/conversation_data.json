    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Calculate the total number of edge squares** on a standard 8x8 chessboard. The edge is the perimeter of the board. An N x N board has `4 * (N - 1)` edge squares.\n2.  **Determine the maximum number of bishops** that can be placed on these edge squares without any of them attacking each other.\n    *   A key property of bishops is that they only move on squares of the same color. This means a bishop on a light square can never attack a bishop on a dark square.\n    *   We can, therefore, solve the problem for light squares and dark squares independently and add the results.\n    *   A standard 8x8 board has 28 edge squares, which are perfectly divided into 14 light and 14 dark squares.\n    *   By analyzing the diagonals, we find that the 14 light edge squares form 7 pairs of squares that lie on the same diagonals (e.g., squares a8 and h1). To place non-attacking bishops, we can only place one bishop per pair. Thus, a maximum of 7 bishops can be placed on the light-colored edge squares.\n    *   By symmetry, the same logic applies to the 14 dark-colored edge squares, allowing for a maximum of 7 non-attacking bishops.\n    *   The total maximum number of bishops is the sum of the maximums for each color: 7 (on light) + 7 (on dark) = 14.\n3.  **Calculate the number of empty edge squares** by subtracting the number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares.\n4.  **Present the solution** in a Python script that shows the step-by-step calculation and prints the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishops_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares on a chessboard after placing\n    the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    # An N x N board has 4 sides, but the 4 corners are shared.\n    # The formula is 4 * N - 4, or 4 * (N - 1).\n    total_edge_squares = 4 * (board_size - 1)\n    print(f\"A standard {board_size}x{board_size} chessboard has {total_edge_squares} edge squares.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge.\n    # The 28 edge squares are divided into 14 light and 14 dark squares.\n    # Bishops on light squares don't attack bishops on dark squares.\n    # Max bishops on 14 light edge squares = 7\n    # Max bishops on 14 dark edge squares = 7\n    # Total max bishops = 7 + 7 = 14.\n    max_bishops = 2 * (board_size - 1)\n    print(f\"The maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge is {max_bishops}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the number of edge squares without bishops.\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - max_bishops\n    print(\"The number of edge squares that would lack bishops is the total number of edge squares minus the maximum number of bishops.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Display the final equation and result.\n    print(f\"Final calculation: {total_edge_squares} - {max_bishops} = {empty_edge_squares}\")\n\n# Run the solver\nsolve_bishops_puzzle()\n<<<14>>>\n```"
