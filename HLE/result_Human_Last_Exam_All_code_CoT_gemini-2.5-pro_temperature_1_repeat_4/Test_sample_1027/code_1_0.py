# The group G is a finitely generated subgroup of PL_+(R),
# the group of orientation-preserving piecewise-linear homeomorphisms of the real line.
# A theorem by Tsuboi states that for any such group, the homology with real
# coefficients vanishes for degrees k >= 2.
# We are asked for the dimension of the homology in degree 31.
# Since 31 >= 2, the dimension is 0.

degree = 31
dimension = 0

# The question asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation is dim H_31(G) = 0.
# So we print the numbers 31 and 0.
print(f"The degree of the homology group is k = {degree}.")
print(f"The dimension of H_k(G; R) for k >= 2 is 0.")
print(f"Therefore, the dimension of H_{degree}(G; R) is {dimension}.")
