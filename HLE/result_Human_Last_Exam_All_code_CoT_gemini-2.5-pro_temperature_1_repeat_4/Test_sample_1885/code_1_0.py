    infinite subset of these functions that is pointwise bounded by some function g.

    print("The question is: Does there necessarily exist an uncountable subset X and a function g such that for every function f_beta in X, f_beta(gamma) < g(gamma) for all gamma?")

    print("The answer is NO.")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    print("\nHere is an explanation of why the answer is NO:\n")

    print("Step 1: The Nature of the Proof")
    print("To show that something is not a necessary consequence of ZFC, we need to show that a counterexample can be constructed within ZFC. The goal is to construct an omega_2-length, <*-increasing sequence of functions, <f_alpha>, for which no uncountable subset is pointwise bounded.")
    
    print("\nStep 2: The Core Idea - Diagonalization over Bounding Functions")
    print("The construction relies on a powerful technique called transfinite induction and diagonalization. The sequence <f_alpha> is built step-by-step for each alpha < omega_2. The key is to ensure that the sequence of functions grows 'fast enough' and in a sufficiently 'diverse' manner, so that no single function g can bound an uncountable number of them.")

    print("\nStep 3: Leveraging Cardinal Arithmetic")
    print("A crucial fact from ZFC is that the cofinality of omega_2 is omega_2. This means any sequence of fewer than omega_2 ordinals from omega_2 has a strict upper bound in omega_2. Since omega_1 < omega_2, the supremum of any omega_1-sequence of ordinals from omega_2 is an ordinal less than omega_2.")

    print("\nStep 4: Sketch of the Proof Argument")
    print("Let's assume we have successfully constructed our counterexample sequence <f_alpha>.")
    print("1. For any potential bounding function g: omega_1 -> omega_1, we can show that the set of functions in our sequence that are bounded by g is 'small'.")
    print("2. For any coordinate gamma < omega_1, the sequence of values <f_alpha(gamma) : alpha < omega_2> can be constructed to be unbounded in omega_1. This means for any value y < omega_1, there is some alpha_0 such that for all alpha > alpha_0, f_alpha(gamma) > y.")
    print("3. Let g be any function. For each gamma < omega_1, let alpha_gamma be the first ordinal such that f_alpha_gamma(gamma) >= g(gamma). Such an alpha_gamma must exist due to the unboundedness property.")
    print("4. Let beta = sup{alpha_gamma : gamma < omega_1}. Because omega_1 < cf(omega_2), we have beta < omega_2.")
    print("5. The construction of the sequence <f_alpha> can be done in such a way that for any alpha > beta, the function f_alpha is guaranteed NOT to be bounded by g. This is because f_alpha will be larger than f_alpha_gamma on coordinate gamma for 'most' alpha > alpha_gamma, and therefore f_alpha(gamma) will be larger than g(gamma).")
    print("6. This means the set of all f_alpha that are bounded by g must be contained within the initial segment of the sequence up to the ordinal beta. This is a bounded subset of omega_2.")
    print("7. More advanced constructions (e.g., by S. Todorcevic) show something even stronger: for any uncountable subset X of omega_2, the family {f_beta : beta in X} is not even bounded in the weaker sense (f_beta <* g). This directly implies it cannot be pointwise bounded.")
    
    print("\nStep 5: Conclusion")
    print("Since a counterexample can be constructed in ZFC, it is not necessarily true that such an uncountable bounded set X and function g exist. The properties of transfinite cardinals, particularly omega_2, allow for the construction of sequences that are too complex and grow too quickly to be tamed in the way the question suggests.")
