    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Recall the formula for the simplicial volume of a surface.** For an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 2$, its simplicial volume is given by $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g - 4$. These surfaces are hyperbolic.\n2.  **Calculate the simplicial volume for each surface.**\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g_1 = 31$. So, $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4 \\times 31 - 4 = 120$.\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $g_2 = 17$. So, $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4 \\times 17 - 4 = 64$.\n3.  **Use the product formula for simplicial volume.** For a product of two closed hyperbolic manifolds $M$ (dimension $n$) and $N$ (dimension $m$), the simplicial volume of their product is given by Gromov's theorem:\n    $\\|M \\times N\\| = \\frac{1}{\\binom{n+m}{n}} \\|M\\| \\|N\\|$.\n4.  **Apply the formula to our problem.**\n    *   Both $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$ are 2-dimensional manifolds, so $n=2$ and $m=2$.\n    *   The binomial coefficient is $\\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$.\n    *   The simplicial volume of the product is $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\times \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$.\n5.  **Compute the final value.**\n    *   $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 120 \\times 64 = 20 \\times 64 = 1280$.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the steps.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_simplicial_volume_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the genera of the surfaces\n    g1 = 31\n    g2 = 17\n    \n    # The dimensions of the surfaces are n=2 and m=2\n    n = 2\n    m = 2\n\n    print(f\"We want to compute the simplicial volume of Σ_{g1} × Σ_{g2}.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the simplicial volume of each surface\n    # The formula for the simplicial volume of a surface Σ_g with g >= 2 is ||Σ_g|| = 4g - 4.\n    sv1 = 4 * g1 - 4\n    sv2 = 4 * g2 - 4\n    \n    print(f\"First, we compute the simplicial volume of each surface individually.\")\n    print(f\"For Σ_{g1}, the simplicial volume is ||Σ_{g1}|| = 4 * {g1} - 4 = {sv1}.\")\n    print(f\"For Σ_{g2}, the simplicial volume is ||Σ_{g2}|| = 4 * {g2} - 4 = {sv2}.\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Use the product formula for simplicial volumes\n    # The formula is ||M x N|| = (1 / C(n+m, n)) * ||M|| * ||N||\n    # where C is the binomial coefficient.\n    binom_coeff_val = math.comb(n + m, n)\n    \n    print(\"\\nNext, we use Gromov's product formula for simplicial volumes:\")\n    print(f\"||Σ_{g1} × Σ_{g2}|| = (1 / C({n+m}, {n})) * ||Σ_{g1}|| * ||Σ_{g2}||\")\n    print(f\"The binomial coefficient C({n+m}, {n}) is {binom_coeff_val}.\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Compute the final value\n    total_sv = (sv1 * sv2) / binom_coeff_val\n    \n    print(\"\\nPutting it all together, the final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"||Σ_{g1} × Σ_{g2}|| = (1 / {binom_coeff_val}) * {sv1} * {sv2} = {int(total_sv)}\")\n\ncompute_simplicial_volume_product()\n```\n<<<1280>>>"
