# The problem is to find the number of distinct homeomorphism classes of a space X
# satisfying a certain topological property.
# Based on topological theorems, we deduce that if we assume X is a manifold,
# there are only two possibilities.

# The first class is the set of spaces homeomorphic to a closed interval, like [0, 1].
# This class satisfies the condition.
num_class_1 = 1
print("Found class 1: The Arc (e.g., [0, 1])")

# The second class is the set of spaces homeomorphic to a circle, S^1.
# This class also satisfies the condition.
num_class_2 = 1
print("Found class 2: The Simple Closed Curve (e.g., a circle)")

# The total number of homeomorphism classes under the manifold assumption is the sum.
total_classes = num_class_1 + num_class_2

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
print(f"The calculation is: {num_class_1} + {num_class_2} = {total_classes}")

print(f"Thus, there are {total_classes} distinct homeomorphism classes.")
