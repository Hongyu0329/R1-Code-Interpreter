def solve_continuum_problem():
    """
    This function explains and presents the solution to the topology problem.

    The problem asks for the largest possible cardinality of the set of points
    where a hereditarily decomposable continuum X fails to be coastal.

    Step 1: A key theorem states that for a hereditarily decomposable continuum,
    the set of non-coastal points is exactly the set of its "end points".

    Step 2: The problem is thus equivalent to finding the maximum possible number
    of end points in such a continuum.

    Step 3: An example of a hereditarily decomposable continuum is the "Cantor fan",
    formed by joining all points of the Cantor set to a single point. The end
    points of this space are precisely the points of the Cantor set.

    Step 4: The cardinality of the Cantor set is known to be 2^{\aleph_0}
    (the cardinality of the continuum).

    Step 5: A continuum, as a separable space, can have a cardinality of at most 2^{\aleph_0}.
    Therefore, this is the maximum possible cardinality.

    The code below will print the final answer symbolically.
