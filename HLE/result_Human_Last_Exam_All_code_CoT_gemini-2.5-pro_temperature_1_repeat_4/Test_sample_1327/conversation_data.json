    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to find the pattern:\n1.  **Analyze the sequence:** The given sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119. Let's denote the terms as `a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5`.\n\n2.  **Look for a simple relationship:** Let's try to find a relationship between consecutive terms, such as `a_{n+1} = k * a_n Â± C`.\n    *   `11 = 3 * 2 + 5`\n    *   `23 = 3 * 11 - 10`\n    *   `51 = 3 * 23 - 18`\n    *   `119 = 3 * 51 - 34`\n\n3.  **Identify the pattern:** Except for the first term, the pattern seems to be `a_{n+1} = 3 * a_n - C_n`. The numbers being subtracted (`C_n`) are 10, 18, 34.\n\n4.  **Analyze the subtraction sequence:** Let's look at the sequence of subtracted numbers: 10, 18, 34.\n    *   The difference between 18 and 10 is `8`.\n    *   The difference between 34 and 18 is `16`.\n\n5.  **Find the next term in the subtraction sequence:** The differences are 8, 16. This is a geometric progression where each difference is multiplied by 2. The next difference should be `16 * 2 = 32`.\n    *   Therefore, the next number in the subtraction sequence is `34 + 32 = 66`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the next term in the main sequence:** Now we can find the next term in the original sequence (`a_6`) using the pattern.\n    *   `a_6 = 3 * a_5 - 66`\n    *   `a_6 = 3 * 119 - 66`\n    *   `a_6 = 357 - 66`\n    *   `a_6 = 291`\n\nThe number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the number sequence problem by identifying the pattern\n    and calculating the next term.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    sequence = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n    \n    # The pattern is a(n+1) = 3 * a(n) - C, starting from the second term.\n    # Let's find the sequence of C.\n    c1 = 3 * sequence[1] - sequence[2]  # 3*11 - 23 = 10\n    c2 = 3 * sequence[2] - sequence[3]  # 3*23 - 51 = 18\n    c3 = 3 * sequence[3] - sequence[4]  # 3*51 - 119 = 34\n    \n    # The sequence of subtractions is [10, 18, 34].\n    # Let's find the pattern in this new sequence.\n    diff1 = c2 - c1  # 18 - 10 = 8\n    diff2 = c3 - c2  # 34 - 18 = 16\n    \n    # The differences are doubling (8, 16, ...).
