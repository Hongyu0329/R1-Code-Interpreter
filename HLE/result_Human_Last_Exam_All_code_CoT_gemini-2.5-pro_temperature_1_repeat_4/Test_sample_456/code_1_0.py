    """
    This function determines the most important image augmentation for the given scenario.

    The problem describes deploying an image classifier on a camera trap with fixed settings (infrared light, fixed position)
    but training it on a diverse public dataset (GBIF). The key to success is bridging the "domain gap" between the
    training and deployment data.

    Analysis:
    1.  Deployment Data Characteristics: Monochrome (infrared), static background, side-on views of animals.
        Key variations will be animals moving left vs. right, and motion blur caused by fast-moving animals.
    2.  Training Data Characteristics: Diverse, color photos, likely biased towards sharp, high-quality images.
    3.  Bridging the Gap: The most important augmentation will introduce realistic variations from the deployment
        world that are missing from the training world.

    -   Color-based augmentations are irrelevant for monochrome infrared images.
    -   Vertical flips are unrealistic.
    -   Horizontal flips are highly realistic and important.
    -   Motion blur is also highly realistic for fast animals and is a severe form of image degradation.
        It is very likely that the curated training data lacks sufficient examples of motion-blurred animals.

    Conclusion: While a horizontal flip is crucial, failing to train on motion blur would cause the model
    to fail on all images of fast-moving animals. Addressing this severe and likely underrepresented
    image artifact is the most critical augmentation for deployment success.

    # The most important augmentation is the one that simulates a realistic, challenging
    # condition of the deployment environment that is likely missing from the training data.
    # That condition is the motion blur from fast-moving animals.
