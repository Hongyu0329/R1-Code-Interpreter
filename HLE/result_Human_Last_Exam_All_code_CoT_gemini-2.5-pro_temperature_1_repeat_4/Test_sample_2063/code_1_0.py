def calculate_limiting_probability():
    """
    Calculates the limiting probability P(n) as n approaches infinity.

    The problem describes a quantum process on an 8-base DNA sequence. The process
    halts if for any base x (from 0 to 7), its count C_x in the sequence
    satisfies C_x mod 8 = x. The process succeeds if this condition is never met.

    As n -> infinity, the vector of counts modulo 8, (C_0 mod 8, ..., C_7 mod 8),
    becomes uniformly distributed over a state space where each component is
    independent and uniformly distributed over {0, 1, ..., 7}.

    The probability that the condition for a specific base x is NOT met (C_x mod 8 != x)
    is 7/8. Since there are 8 bases and their count conditions are asymptotically
    independent, the total probability of success is (7/8)^8.
