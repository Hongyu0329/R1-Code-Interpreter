    "The value you are asking about is the time duration between consecutive heartbeats. This is the fundamental measurement used to calculate Heart Rate Variability (HRV). My plan is to provide a simple Python script that defines this term and prints it out for you.\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The user wants to know the name of the value measured between heartbeats to compute HRV.\n2.  **Recall the terminology:** This value is most commonly known as the **R-R interval**, named after the 'R' wave peak in an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Even when using PPG, this term is often used. Another correct term is **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**.\n3.  **Formulate the code:** I will create a Python script that stores this term in a variable and then prints it in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\ndef get_hrv_value_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the name of the value used to compute HRV.\n    \"\"\"\n    # HRV is the variation in the time between consecutive heartbeats.\n    # This time measurement is the fundamental value used for HRV analysis.\n    value_name = \"R-R interval\"\n    alternative_name = \"Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)\"\n\n    print(f\"The value computed between heartbeats to calculate Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is called the '{value_name}'.\")\n    print(f\"It is also commonly referred to as the '{alternative_name}'.\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer.\nget_hrv_value_name()\n```\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
