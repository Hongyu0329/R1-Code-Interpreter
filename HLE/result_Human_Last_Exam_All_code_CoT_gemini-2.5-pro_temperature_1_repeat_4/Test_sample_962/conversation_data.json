    "Of course. I will provide a Python implementation of a secure 2-round t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Choose a Scheme:** I will implement **FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures)**. It's a modern, well-regarded scheme known for its security and its two-round signing protocol. It's based on the widely used Schnorr signature algorithm adapted for a threshold setting.\n\n2.  **Simulate Key Generation:** A full Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol is complex. To focus on the signing protocol, I will simulate a \"trusted dealer\" who generates the master key and distributes secret shares to all `n` participants. This is a standard simplification for demonstrating the core signing logic.\n\n3.  **Implement the Two-Round Signing Protocol:**\n    *   **Round 1 (Commitment):** Each of the `t` participating signers will generate secret nonces and broadcast public commitments derived from them.\n    *   **Round 2 (Signature Share Generation):** After receiving commitments from all other signers, each participant will compute a group commitment and a challenge. They will then use their secret share, nonces, and a special value called a Lagrange coefficient to compute their individual signature share.\n\n4.  **Aggregate and Verify:** A designated aggregator (who can be one of the signers) will collect the `t` signature shares and combine them into a single, final signature. This final signature can then be publicly verified by anyone using the group's public key.\n\n5.  **Code Structure:** The Python code will use the `py_ecc` library for elliptic curve operations. It will define classes for the `TrustedDealer` and `Participant` to clearly structure the logic. The final part of the script will orchestrate the signing and verification process for a sample scenario (e.g., 3-out-of-5 participants signing a message). Throughout the execution, key values and the final verification equation will be printed.\n\nHere is the Python code implementing the FROST scheme.\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\nimport random\nimport operator\nfrom functools import reduce\n\n# py_ecc is required.
