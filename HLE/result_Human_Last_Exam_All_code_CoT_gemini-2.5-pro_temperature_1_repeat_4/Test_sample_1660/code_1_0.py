# --- Start of the Logic ---
# Plan:
# 1. Define the toxicity data (LD50 values) for TMT-Cl and TBT-Cl.
#    LD50 (Lethal Dose, 50%) is the standard measure of acute toxicity.
#    A lower LD50 value indicates a higher level of toxicity.
# 2. Store the values for easy comparison.
# 3. Print the data and a clear explanation. The "final equation" will be a
#    symbolic representation of the toxicity comparison based on the LD50 values.

# Step 1 & 2: Define and store LD50 data (oral, rat, in mg/kg)

print("\nConclusion:")
print("The most important factor is that TMT-Cl has a significantly lower LD50 value.")
print("This is the direct, quantitative evidence that it is more acutely toxic and therefore more dangerous to humans than TBT-Cl.")
print("Other factors, like cell permeability or reactivity, are the underlying reasons *for* this difference in LD50, but the LD50 value itself is the definitive measure.")
