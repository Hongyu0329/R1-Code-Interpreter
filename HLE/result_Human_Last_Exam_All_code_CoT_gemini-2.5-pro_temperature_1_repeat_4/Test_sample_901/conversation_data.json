    "This is an E2 elimination reaction. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, a secondary alkyl halide. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, bulky base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **Stereochemical Requirement for E2**: The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (Bromine) and the beta-hydrogen (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the one with the leaving group) must be in an *anti-periplanar* arrangement. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means the leaving group and the beta-hydrogen must both be in axial positions and on opposite sides of the ring (one pointing up, one pointing down). This is called a *trans-diaxial* arrangement.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Conformations of the Reactant**:\n    *   The reactant, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, has the bromo and methyl groups in a *trans* relationship.\n    *   It exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations:\n        *   **Conformer A**: Bromine is axial, and the methyl group is equatorial.\n        *   **Conformer B**: Bromine is equatorial, and the methyl group is axial.\n    *   The E2 reaction can *only* proceed from **Conformer A**, where the leaving group (Br) is in the required axial position.\n\n4.  **Identify Available Beta-Hydrogens in the Reactive Conformer**:\n    *   In Conformer A (Br is axial), we must look for beta-hydrogens that are also axial. The beta-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2**: This carbon has the methyl group in an equatorial position. Therefore, the hydrogen on C2 is in an *axial* position. However, because the Br and CH3 groups are trans, if Br is axial-up, the H on C2 is also axial-up. They are *syn* (on the same side), not *anti*. Thus, elimination cannot occur towards C2.\n    *   **At C6**: This carbon has two hydrogens. One is axial, and one is equatorial. The axial hydrogen on C6 is *anti* to the axial bromine on C1 (one is up, one is down). This hydrogen meets the trans-diaxial requirement.\n\n5.  **Determine the Product**:\n    *   Since only the axial hydrogen on C6 can be removed, the base (t-BuOK) will abstract this specific hydrogen.\n    *   A double bond will form between C1 and C6.\n    *   The resulting product is 3-methylcyclohexene. The more substituted alkene (1-methylcyclohexene, the Zaitsev product) cannot be formed due to the strict stereochemical constraints of the E2 reaction.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the E2 reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n    and identifies the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    explanation = \"\"\"\nStep-by-step analysis of the reaction: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide.\n\n1. Reaction Type: The reaction involves a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide), which indicates an E2 elimination mechanism.\n\n2. Stereochemical Requirement: The E2 reaction requires a specific geometry where the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen are anti-periplanar. In a cyclohexane ring, this means they must be in a trans-diaxial orientation (both axial, one up, one down).\n\n3. Reactant Conformation:\n   - The reaction must proceed from the chair conformation where the bromine leaving group is in an axial position.\n   - For (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane (a trans isomer), the reactive conformer has an axial Bromine and an equatorial methyl group.\n\n4. Elimination Pathways:\n   - Beta-Hydrogen at C2: In the reactive conformer, the hydrogen on C2 is axial, but it is on the same side (syn) as the axial bromine. It does not meet the anti-periplanar requirement. Therefore, no double bond can form between C1 and C2.\n   - Beta-Hydrogen at C6: There is an axial hydrogen on C6 that is on the opposite side (anti) to the axial bromine. This hydrogen meets the trans-diaxial requirement.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - The base can only abstract the axial hydrogen from C6.\n   - The double bond is formed between carbon 1 and carbon 6.\n   - The methyl group is at position 3 relative to the new double bond.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    product_name = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n    \n    print(explanation)\n    print(\"Final Product Name:\")\n    print(product_name)\n\nsolve_reaction()\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
