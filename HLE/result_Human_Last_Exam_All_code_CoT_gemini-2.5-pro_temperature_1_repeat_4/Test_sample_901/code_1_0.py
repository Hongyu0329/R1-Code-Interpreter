Step-by-step analysis of the reaction: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide.

1. Reaction Type: The reaction involves a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide), which indicates an E2 elimination mechanism.

2. Stereochemical Requirement: The E2 reaction requires a specific geometry where the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen are anti-periplanar. In a cyclohexane ring, this means they must be in a trans-diaxial orientation (both axial, one up, one down).

3. Reactant Conformation:
   - The reaction must proceed from the chair conformation where the bromine leaving group is in an axial position.
   - For (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane (a trans isomer), the reactive conformer has an axial Bromine and an equatorial methyl group.

4. Elimination Pathways:
   - Beta-Hydrogen at C2: In the reactive conformer, the hydrogen on C2 is axial, but it is on the same side (syn) as the axial bromine. It does not meet the anti-periplanar requirement. Therefore, no double bond can form between C1 and C2.
   - Beta-Hydrogen at C6: There is an axial hydrogen on C6 that is on the opposite side (anti) to the axial bromine. This hydrogen meets the trans-diaxial requirement.

5. Conclusion:
   - The base can only abstract the axial hydrogen from C6.
   - The double bond is formed between carbon 1 and carbon 6.
   - The methyl group is at position 3 relative to the new double bond.
