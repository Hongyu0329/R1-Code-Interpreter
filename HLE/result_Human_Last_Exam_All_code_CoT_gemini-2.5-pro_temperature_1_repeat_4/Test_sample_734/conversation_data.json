    "The theologian you are asking about is Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD). He was one of the first Christian thinkers to systematically address the relationship between God's miraculous acts and the order of nature He created.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of his contribution:\n1.  **Defining Miracles and Nature:** Augustine argued that what we call a \"miracle\" is not something that is *contrary* to nature in an absolute sense, but rather something that is contrary to *our knowledge* of nature. He reasoned that the \"laws of nature\" are simply the usual and regular way God makes things happen. A miracle is just God choosing to act in an unusual or extraordinary way, using potentialities that He embedded in creation from the beginning (his concept of *rationes seminales* or \"seminal reasons\").\n2.  **Application to the Virgin Birth:** He saw the virgin birth not as a violation of nature, but as an act of God that was beyond the *ordinary* course of nature. It was something new and unique, but possible for the same God who established the ordinary rules of procreation.\n3.  **Application to the Fall:** Augustine taught that the state of the natural world was altered by the Fall of Adam and Eve. He believed that before the Fall, humans were not subject to death or corruption. The introduction of death, disease, and the \"groaning\" of creation (as described by St. Paul in Romans 8) represented a change in how the laws of nature operated, at least in relation to humanity.\n\nThis framework provided a specialized way to talk about God altering or acting outside the usual patterns of nature, a concept he applied to both specific miracles and the overarching change in the natural order due to the Fall.\n\n```python\ndef find_theologian():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the name of the Christian theologian\n  who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature,\n  applicable to both the virgin birth and the consequences of the Fall.\n  \"\"\"\n  theologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n  print(theologian_name)\n\nfind_theologian()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
