    print("Analyzing the five explanations for the trend in Japanese university entrants:\n")

    # --- Evaluation of Each Option ---

    print("Option A Analysis: The decrease in the 18-year-old population was smaller than predicted.")
    print("Fact: Japan's 18-year-old population has declined sharply and consistently since the early 1990s, largely as predicted. The population fell from over 2 million to around 1.1 million. The surprise was not the demographic trend, but the educational system's response.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement A is factually incorrect.\n")

    print("Option B Analysis: Increase in university enrollment rate.")
    print("Fact: The university advancement rate (大学進学率) has increased dramatically, from roughly 25-30% in the early 1990s to over 55-60% by the 2020s. This is a major factor offsetting the population decline.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement B is a correct explanation.\n")

    print("Option C Analysis: Increased demand for re-learning by working adults.")
    print("Fact: Lifelong learning and reskilling are growing trends, and universities are increasingly enrolling adult learners. This is a valid contributing factor to the overall student numbers.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement C is a correct explanation.\n")

    print("Option D Analysis: Diversification of higher education ... work as a kind of prep schools.")
    print("Fact: While other forms of higher education exist, enrollment in two-year colleges (短期大学) has significantly decreased as students opt for four-year universities. Characterizing these institutions as increasingly acting as 'prep schools' that push up four-year university entrant numbers is a misrepresentation. They are more accurately described as alternatives, and the trend is a direct shift towards four-year universities.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement D is an inappropriate or misleading explanation.\n")

    print("Option E Analysis: Government policies.")
    print("Fact: In the 1990s, the Japanese government relaxed the standards for establishing universities (大学設置基準の緩和) and has provided significant subsidies to private universities. This policy enabled the supply of university places to grow.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement E is a correct explanation.\n")
