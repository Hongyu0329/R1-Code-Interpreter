    # --- Question A: Is every boopable function Turing-computable? ---

    # A boopable function is defined as a function f(x) for which a program L exists
    # that computes f(x) for any choice of machine parameters (R, A, W) that are
    # large enough (>= N for some N).
    # This ability to use arbitrarily large R (registers), A (address space), and W (word size)
    # means the machine has access to unbounded memory resources.
    # The instruction set includes:
    # - Arithmetic (ADD)
    # - Universal logic (BITWISENAND is functionally complete)
    # - Memory access (LOAD, STORE)
    # - Conditional control flow (BRANCHIFZERO)
    # A computational model with these features is known to be Turing-complete. It is
    # equivalent to a Random Access Machine (RAM), which in turn is equivalent to a
    # Turing machine.
    # Since the machine is Turing-complete, any function it can compute (a "boopable"
    # function) is, by definition, a Turing-computable function.
    answer_A = "Yes"

    # --- Question B: Existence of a specific program L ---
    # The question asks if a program L exists for a machine with fixed parameters
    # (R,A,W) = (64, 64, 512) that can map any input x in [0, 2^32) to x boops
    # in at most x + 50 steps, with program length at most 2^32 + 50.

    # The answer is Yes. This can be achieved with a self-modifying program.
    # The key constraints are the execution time (<= x + 50) and program length.
    # The time constraint implies that the non-booping "overhead" instructions
    # must be a small constant (<= 50). A simple loop would take ~c*x steps (c>1),
    # which is too slow.
    # The solution is to have a long, contiguous block of BOOP instructions in the
    # program and dynamically calculate the correct address to jump into this block.

    # **Plan:**
    # 1. The program L will contain a setup section, followed by a very long
    #    sequence of BOOP instructions, and a HALT at the end.
    # 2. The setup code calculates a target address T based on the input x.
    # 3. It then constructs a `BRANCHIFZERO T, z_reg` instruction word, where z_reg is a
    #    register known to be zero, making the branch unconditional.
    # 4. It uses `STORE` to write this new instruction into a specific memory location,
    #    the `JUMP_SLOT`, which the program is about to execute.
    # 5. The program flow reaches the `JUMP_SLOT`, executes the newly written branch,
    #    and jumps to the target address T.
    # 6. From address T, the machine executes a sequence of BOOPs until it hits HALT.
    #    The number of BOOPs is engineered to be exactly x.

    # **Feasibility Analysis:**

    # Program Layout & Length:
    # The program L can have a length up to 2**32 + 50.
    PROG_LEN = 2**32 + 50
    HALT_ADDR = PROG_LEN - 1

    # To boop x times, we must jump to an address T such that executing from T to
    # HALT_ADDR-1 results in x BOOPs. So, the target address is T = HALT_ADDR - x.
    # We place the setup code and a jump slot at the beginning of the program.
    SETUP_CODE_OPS = 8
    JUMP_SLOT_ADDR = SETUP_CODE_OPS # The slot is executed right after setup.

    # Execution Time Analysis:
    # The total time is the sum of setup, the jump, the boops, and the halt.
    # By placing the jump slot immediately after the setup code, we minimize overhead.
    
    # Steps for setup code to compute and write the branch instruction:
    # This relies on a favorable instruction encoding for `BRANCHIFZERO adr, reg` where
    # the address `adr` occupies the least significant bits of the argument field,
    # avoiding a costly bit-shift operation.
    # 1. LOAD H_ADDR           (1 step)
    # 2. LOAD -1               (1 step)
    # 3. ADD to get x-1        (1 step)
    # 4. NAND to get -x        (1 step)
    # 5. ADD to get H_ADDR-x   (1 step)
    # 6. LOAD opcode/reg part  (1 step)
    # 7. ADD to form instruction (1 step)
    # 8. STORE to JUMP_SLOT    (1 step)
    steps_setup_code = SETUP_CODE_OPS
    
    # Step for the jump: After the 8 setup instructions, the PC is at 8 and executes the jump.
    steps_jump = 1
    
    # Steps for booping: The jump goes to T. It executes x BOOP instructions.
    steps_boops_str = 'x'
    
    # Step for halting: After the boops, the program halts.
    steps_halt = 1

    overhead_steps = steps_setup_code + steps_jump + steps_halt
