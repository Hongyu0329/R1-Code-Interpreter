    "My plan is to answer your question by first explaining the underlying physics and then presenting the detailed reasoning in a Python script, as per your request format.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physics:** The question is about Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC). The first step is to identify the key material property required for this phenomenon.\n2.  **Identify the Requirement:** SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process. A fundamental requirement for such processes is that the material must lack a center of inversion symmetry. Materials that have an inversion center (i.e., are centrosymmetric) have a second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) of zero and cannot exhibit SPDC.\n3.  **Investigate Boron Nanosheets:** The next step is to examine the crystal structure of free-standing boron nanosheets (also known as borophene). We need to know if their common structures are centrosymmetric or not.\n4.  **Check Symmetry:** Research shows that the most stable and commonly studied phases of borophene, such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases, are indeed centrosymmetric.\n5.  **Formulate the Conclusion:** Since the common forms of boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, they are not expected to exhibit SPDC. The Python script below will print out this step-by-step reasoning and provide the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef explain_spdc_in_borophene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains whether free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene)\n    are expected to exhibit Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define SPDC and its material requirement.\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Understanding the Physics of SPDC ---\")\n    print(\"Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process.\")\n    print(\"A critical requirement for a material to exhibit second-order effects is that its crystal structure must lack a center of inversion (it must be non-centrosymmetric).\")\n    print(\"Materials with inversion symmetry (centrosymmetric) have a second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) of zero, which prohibits SPDC.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the symmetry of boron nanosheets.\n    print(\"--- Step 2: Analyzing the Structure of Boron Nanosheets ---\")\n    print(\"Boron nanosheets, or 'borophene', can exist in several different structural forms (phases).\")\n    print(\"The question therefore is: are the common, stable phases of free-standing borophene centrosymmetric?\")\n    print(\"Scientific studies have shown that the most stable and commonly synthesized phases, such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases, are indeed centrosymmetric.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 3: Draw the final conclusion.\n    print(\"--- Step 3: Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"Because the common and most stable forms of free-standing boron nanosheets possess a center of inversion symmetry, their intrinsic second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, they are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\")\n    print(\"\\n(Note: SPDC could theoretically occur if a specific, less common non-centrosymmetric phase were stabilized, or if the symmetry were broken by external factors like strain or defects, but it is not an expected intrinsic property.)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    explain_spdc_in_borophene()\n```\n<<<No, because the most common and stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets possess inversion symmetry, which forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes like SPDC.>>>"
