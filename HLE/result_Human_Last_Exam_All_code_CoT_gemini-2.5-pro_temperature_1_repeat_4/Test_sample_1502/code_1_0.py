    This function analyzes the three questions posed about the functional J_t
    and its associated properties. It uses symbolic math to verify the
    condition in question (a).
    """

    # Step 1: Define all symbolic variables from the problem statement.
    # t is the scaling parameter. s is the anisotropy parameter.
    # p is the exponent in the L^p norm term.
    t, s = sp.symbols('t s', real=True, positive=True)
    p = sp.Symbol('p', real=True, positive=True)

    # Step 2: Formulate the analysis for question (a).
    # The question is whether J_t becomes unbounded below as t -> +oo
    # if p > 2*(1 + 3*s) / (1 + s).
    # J_t(u,v) is the functional J evaluated at the scaled functions u_t, v_t.
    # The scaling is u_t(x, y) = t**((1+s)/2) * u(t**s * x, t * y).

    # We analyze the scaling behavior of each term in J.
    # The kinetic energy term involving the x-derivative scales with t**(2*s).
    # The kinetic energy term involving the y-derivative scales with t**2.
    # The L^p norm term scales as: ||u_t||_p^p = t**((s+1)*(p/2 - 1)) * ||u||_p^p.

    # To check for unboundedness, we can choose a path that makes the energy decrease.
    # We consider a path with v=0 and u being a function of x only, i.e., u=u(x).
    # For such a function, the integral of (d/dy u)^2 is zero.
    # The functional J(u_t, 0) for u=u(x) simplifies. Its behavior for large t
    # is determined by the highest powers of t.
    # The dominant positive term (from kinetic energy) scales as ~ t**(2*s).
    # The negative term (from L^p norm) scales as ~ t**((s+1)*(p/2 - 1)).

    # For J_t to go to -infinity, the exponent of t in the negative term must be
    # larger than the exponent of t in the positive term.
    exponent_positive = 2*s
    exponent_negative = (s+1)*(sp.Rational(p, 2) - 1)

    # The condition for unboundedness is: exponent_negative > exponent_positive
    # Let's solve this inequality for p.
    # (s+1)*(p/2 - 1) > 2*s
    # p/2 - 1 > 2*s / (s+1)
    # p/2 > 1 + 2*s / (s+1)
    # p/2 > (s+1 + 2*s) / (s+1)
    # p/2 > (3*s + 1) / (s+1)
    # p > 2*(3*s + 1) / (s+1)

    # The derived condition is identical to the one in the question.
    # Since we found a path where the energy becomes unbounded under this condition,
    # the statement in (a) is true.

    # Step 3: Present the analysis and answers.
    # The reasoning for (b) and (c) is based on established mathematical theory,
    # as they are not amenable to simple symbolic computation.
