    "To answer your question, I will identify a polycyclic hydrocarbon whose name is derived from a creature that became extinct during the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event, which occurred approximately 66 million years ago. This points towards dinosaurs or their contemporaries. I will then provide a simple Python script to print the name of this molecule.\n\n```python\ndef find_molecule():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of a polycyclic hydrocarbon\n    named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years.\n    The molecule's shape is said to resemble a pterodactyl.\n    \"\"\"\n    molecule_name = \"Pterodactyladiene\"\n    print(f\"The polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature extinct for over 65 million years is: {molecule_name}\")\n\nfind_molecule()\n```\n<<<Pterodactyladiene>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant.

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What polycyclic hydrocarbon is named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
