    print("- Molecular Core: A single benzene ring.")
    print("- Desired Phases: Nematic or smectic.")
    print("- Target Transition Temperatures: Around room temperature (approximately 20-25Â°C).")

    # 2. General Molecular Design
    print("\n2. Suggested Molecular Design:")
    print("- Core Unit: A single benzene ring provides the necessary rigidity.")
    print("- Substitution Pattern: Attach terminal groups at the para positions (positions 1 and 4) to create a linear, rod-like molecule.")

    # 3. Recommended Molecular Features for Functionality
    print("\n3. Recommended Molecular Features:")
    print("- Flexible Tail: On one end, add a flexible alkyl chain with the general formula C(n)H(2n+1). This chain helps to lower the melting point.")
    print("- Polar Head: On the other end, add a strong polar group, such as a cyano (-CN), fluoro (-F), or methoxy (-OCH3) group, to induce dipole moments and promote liquid crystal phase stability.")

    # 4. A Specific Example Structure
    print("\n4. Specific Example Structure:")
    print("- Inspiration: We can adapt the structure of the well-known liquid crystal 4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB).")

    # 6. Strategy to Achieve Room Temperature Transitions
    print("\n6. Strategy for Tuning Transition Temperatures:")
    print("- Starting Point: A pentyl chain (where n=5) is a good starting point, as seen in many common liquid crystals.")
    print("- Adjustment Logic:")
    print("  - If the observed transition temperature is too high, increase the alkyl chain length (try n=6, 7, etc.).")
    print("  - If the observed transition temperature is too low, decrease the alkyl chain length (try n=4, 3, etc.).")
    print("- Fine-Tuning: For more precise control, lateral substituents like a small fluoro (-F) or methyl (-CH3) group can be added to the benzene ring.")
