    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can use a known result from the theory of compact complex surfaces.\n\n### My thinking steps\n1.  **Identify the space X**: We are given $X$, a smooth hypersurface of degree $d=5$ in the complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ where $n=3$. $X$ is a compact complex manifold of complex dimension $n-1 = 2$. In other words, $X$ is a compact complex surface.\n\n2.  **Topological Properties of X**: Using the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, we can determine some of the basic topological invariants of $X$. For a smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ ($n \\ge 2$), the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homology and homotopy groups in low degrees.\n    *   $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$. So, $X$ is simply connected.\n    *   $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ and, by Poincar√© duality for the 4-dimensional real manifold $X$, $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. So the Betti number $b_3(X)=0$.\n\n3.  **Key Theorem**: For a simply connected compact complex surface $S$, there is a powerful theorem by Catanese which states that the rank of the third homotopy group, $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(S))$, is equal to the Hodge number $h^{2,0}(S)$. The Hodge number $h^{2,0}(S)$ is the dimension of the space of holomorphic 2-forms on $S$.\n\n4.  **Calculate $h^{2,0}(X)$**: By definition, $h^{2,0}(X) = \\dim H^0(X, \\Omega_X^2)$, where $\\Omega_X^2$ is the canonical bundle of $X$, denoted $K_X$.\n    *   We use the **adjunction formula** to find the canonical bundle of the hypersurface $X$. For a hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the formula is $K_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(d - n - 1)$.\n    *   In our case, $d=5$ and $n=3$, so $K_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(5 - 3 - 1) = \\mathcal{O}_X(1)$.\n    *   Therefore, we need to calculate $h^{2,0}(X) = \\dim H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(1))$.\n\n5.  **Compute the Dimension**: To find the dimension of the space of sections of $\\mathcal{O}_X(1)$, we use the long exact sequence in cohomology associated with the short exact sequence of sheaves on $\\mathbb{CP}^3$:\n    $0 \\to \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}(-4) \\to \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}(1) \\to \\mathcal{O}_X(1) \\to 0$.\n    The long exact sequence starts as:\n    $0 \\to H^0(\\mathbb{CP}^3, \\mathcal{O}(-4)) \\to H^0(\\mathbb{CP}^3, \\mathcal{O}(1)) \\to H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(1)) \\to H^1(\\mathbb{CP}^3, \\mathcal{O}(-4)) \\to \\dots$\n    *   For any $k<0$, $H^0(\\mathbb{CP}^n, \\mathcal{O}(k)) = 0$. So $H^0(\\mathbb{CP}^3, \\mathcal{O}(-4)) = 0$.\n    *   For $0 < p < n$, $H^p(\\mathbb{CP}^n, \\mathcal{O}(k)) = 0$. Here $p=1, n=3$, so $H^1(\\mathbb{CP}^3, \\mathcal{O}(-4)) = 0$.\n    *   This implies that the map $H^0(\\mathbb{CP}^3, \\mathcal{O}(1)) \\to H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(1))$ is an isomorphism.\n    *   So, $\\dim H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(1)) = \\dim H^0(\\mathbb{CP}^3, \\mathcal{O}(1))$.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**: The dimension of the space of global sections of $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{CP}^n}(k)$ is given by the formula $\\binom{n+k}{k}$.\n    *   For our case, $n=3$ and we are interested in $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ with $k=1$.\n    *   $\\dim H^0(\\mathbb{CP}^3, \\mathcal{O}(1)) = \\binom{3+1}{1} = \\binom{4}{1} = 4$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: The rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is $h^{2,0}(X) = 4$.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations(n, k):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, k).\"\"\"\n    if k < 0 or k > n:\n        return 0\n    return math.factorial(n) // (math.factorial(k) * math.factorial(n - k))\n\ndef solve_pi3_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface in CP^3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # n: dimension of the complex projective space\n    n = 3\n    # d: degree of the hypersurface\n    d = 5\n\n    print(f\"The rank of pi_3(X) for a simply connected complex surface X is given by the Hodge number h^(2,0)(X).\")\n    print(f\"For a hypersurface X of degree d in CP^n, h^(2,0)(X) = dim H^0(X, K_X), where K_X is the canonical bundle.\")\n    print(f\"By the adjunction formula, K_X = O_X(d - n - 1).\")\n    \n    # k: the degree of the canonical bundle\n    k = d - n - 1\n    \n    print(f\"\\nGiven values:\")\n    print(f\"Dimension of projective space, n = {n}\")\n    print(f\"Degree of hypersurface, d = {d}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nStep 1: Calculate the degree of the canonical bundle O_X(k).\")\n    print(f\"k = d - n - 1 = {d} - {n} - 1 = {k}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nStep 2: Calculate h^(2,0)(X) = dim H^0(CP^n, O(k)).\")\n    print(f\"The dimension is given by the binomial coefficient C(n + k, k).\")\n    \n    # Calculate the rank\n    rank = combinations(n + k, k)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nFinal calculation:\")\n    print(f\"rank = C({n} + {k}, {k}) = C({n+k}, {k}) = {rank}\")\n\nsolve_pi3_rank()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
