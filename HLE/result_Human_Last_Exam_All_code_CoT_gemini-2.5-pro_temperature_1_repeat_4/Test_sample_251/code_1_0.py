    Calculates the number of Maslov 2 holomorphic disks for a specified Lagrangian.

    The problem involves a Lagrangian in CP^4 constructed by iteratively lifting
    a Chekanov torus from CP^2. The solution relies on two key facts from
    symplectic geometry:
    1. The number of Maslov 2 disks for the monotone Chekanov torus in CP^2.
    2. The invariance of this number under the Biran lift construction.
