    # --- Part 1: Chromatic Number Change (delta_soviet) ---

    # Determine the chromatic number of the Asian graph AFTER the Soviet dissolution.
    # After 1991, with the formation of Kazakhstan, a group of four countries emerged
    # that are all mutually adjacent: China, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia.
    # This forms a K4 clique (a complete graph of 4 vertices).
    # The presence of a K4 clique necessitates a minimum of 4 colors.
    # According to the Four-Color Theorem, a planar graph's chromatic number is at most 4.
    # Therefore, the chromatic number after the dissolution is exactly 4.
    chromatic_number_after = 4
    print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian subgraph after the Soviet dissolution (X_after) is {chromatic_number_after}.")

    # Determine the chromatic number of the Asian graph BEFORE the Soviet dissolution.
    # Before 1991, Russia and Kazakhstan were part of the USSR. The aforementioned clique
    # did not exist. The equivalent nodes were {USSR, China, Mongolia}, which is a K3 clique.
    # In the absence of a K4 clique, a planar graph is often 3-colorable.
    # We establish the chromatic number before the change was 3.
    chromatic_number_before = 3
    print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian subgraph before the Soviet dissolution (X_before) was {chromatic_number_before}.")

    # Calculate the incremental change.
    delta_soviet = chromatic_number_after - chromatic_number_before
    print(f"The change in chromatic number, delta_soviet, is {chromatic_number_after} - {chromatic_number_before} = {delta_soviet}.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # --- Part 2: Planarity Change (beta) ---

    # A political map is by definition a planar graph, as it exists on a 2D surface
    # without borders crossing each other (except at intersection points).
    # The dissolution of the USSR was a subdivision of one graph node into multiple nodes.
    # This operation preserves the planarity of the graph.
    # Since the planarity did not change, beta is 1.
    beta = 1
    print(f"The planarity of the graph did not change, therefore beta = {beta}.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # --- Part 3: Final Calculation ---

    # Calculate the final result as per the user's request.
    final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
    print(f"The final result is beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}.")
    
    # The problem asks to return the final integer answer in a specific format for parsing.
    # This part is commented out to not affect the standard output for a user running the script,
    # but it indicates the final answer.
    # For the submission system, we will print it.
    # print(f"<<<{final_answer}>>>")
