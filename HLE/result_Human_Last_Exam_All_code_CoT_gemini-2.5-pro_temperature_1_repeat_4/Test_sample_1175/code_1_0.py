# This script calculates the final value based on the derived expression.

# The derived expression for the final value is (3/2) * 10**(10/3) + 37/4.
# Let's define the numbers that make up this expression.
a = 3
b = 2
c = 10
d = 10
e = 3
f = 37
g = 4

# The final equation form is (a/b) * c**(d/e) + f/g
result = (a / b) * (c**(d / e)) + (f / g)

# As requested, here are the numbers in the final equation:
print(f"The final equation is ({a}/{b}) * {c}**({d}/{e}) + {f}/{g}")

# Print the final numerical result
print(f"The result is: {result}")
