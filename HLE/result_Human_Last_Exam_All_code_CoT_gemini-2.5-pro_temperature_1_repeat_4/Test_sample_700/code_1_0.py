    Determines the complexity class for G and G'.

    Based on the analysis:
    1.  The problem for G is `exists w forall q in R: delta*(q, w) = q_a`.
        Assuming a polynomial-length witness `w`, the verifier `forall q in R...` is in P.
        This places G in NP.

    2.  The problem for G' is `exists w forall s where |s|=k: ...`.
        The logical structure is exists-forall, which suggests Sigma_2^P.
        While our analysis suggests this also simplifies to NP (under the same assumptions),
        the explicit bound `k` and the quantifier structure might be intended to point towards a higher class in the hierarchy.
        The question format suggests the classes are different. A plausible, albeit debatable, distinction
        is to classify G as NP and G' as Sigma_2 based on the most direct interpretation of their definitions.

    This leads to the answer: NP, Sigma_2.
