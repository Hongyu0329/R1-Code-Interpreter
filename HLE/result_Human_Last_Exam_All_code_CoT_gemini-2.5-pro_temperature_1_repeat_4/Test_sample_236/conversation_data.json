    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan\n\nMy plan is to solve this problem by first understanding the group in question and then checking which of its elements can be constructed using the given constraints.\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and its Invariant:** The homology cobordism group, Θ³_H, is known to be isomorphic to ℤ₂, the group of two elements. These two elements are distinguished by an integer modulo 2 called the Rohlin invariant, μ. So, we need to check if we can construct homology spheres with μ=0 (representing the trivial element) and μ=1 (representing the non-trivial element).\n2.  **Identify the Knots:** I will list all prime knots with four or fewer crossings. These are the unknot (0₁), the trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁).\n3.  **Use a Surgery Formula:** For an integral surgery on a knot K, the Rohlin invariant of the resulting manifold can be determined from the Arf invariant of the knot. The Arf invariant is a property of the knot that is either 0 or 1.\n    *   For +1 surgery, the Rohlin invariant is `μ = Arf(K) mod 2`.\n    *   For -1 surgery, the Rohlin invariant is `μ = (Arf(K) + 1) mod 2`.\n    *   The unknot (0₁) is a special case where any integral surgery produces the 3-sphere S³, which has a Rohlin invariant of 0.\n4.  **Calculate and Count:** I will find the Arf invariants for the required knots, apply the surgery formulas to determine all possible Rohlin invariants we can generate, and then count the number of unique invariants found. This count will be the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Redirect print to a string buffer to control the final output format if needed,\n# but for this task, direct printing is fine.\n\ndef solve_homology_cobordism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates how many elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented\n    by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This program determines how many elements of the homology cobordism group (Θ³_H)\")\n    print(\"can be represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\")\n    print(\"\\n---\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define knots with at most 4 crossings and their Arf invariants.\")\n    # The Arf invariant of a knot K is 0 if its Alexander polynomial at -1, Δ_K(-1),\n    # is congruent to ±1 mod 8, and 1 otherwise.\n    # 0₁: Δ(t)=1, Δ(-1)=1.
