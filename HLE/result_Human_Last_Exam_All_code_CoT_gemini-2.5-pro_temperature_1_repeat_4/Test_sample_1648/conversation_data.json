    "To find the largest natural number `n` such that the `(2n)`-th K-group of `Z/27` is non-zero, we need to analyze the structure of the algebraic K-groups `K_{2n}(Z/27)`.\n\n### Step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the ring and K-groups:** The ring is `R = Z/27 = Z/3^3`. We are interested in the even-indexed K-groups `K_{2n}(R)`.\n\n2.  **Determine the torsion of these groups:** For a ring `Z/m`, the K-groups `K_i(Z/m)` are finite. For `m = p^k` with `p` a prime, the group `K_i(Z/p^k)` for `i > 0` splits into its `l`-primary components.\n    *   For any prime `l != p`, the `l`-primary part of `K_i(Z/p^k)` is isomorphic to the `l`-primary part of `K_i(Z/p)`.\n    *   The K-groups of a finite field `F_p = Z/p` are known from Quillen's work: `K_{2n}(F_p) = 0` for `n > 0`.\n    *   In our case, `p=3`. For any prime `l != 3`, the `l`-primary part of `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is isomorphic to the `l`-primary part of `K_{2n}(Z/3)`, which is zero.\n    *   This implies that for `n > 0`, `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is a `3`-group (i.e., its order is a power of 3). Thus, `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is non-zero if and only if its `3`-primary component is non-zero.\n\n3.  **Find a condition for `K_{2n}(Z/27)` to be non-zero:**\n    A deep theorem in algebraic K-theory, the Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjecture (now a theorem), leads to stability results for K-groups. A result by C. Soulé states that for `m=p^k`, the natural map from the K-groups of integers `K_i(Z)` to `K_i(Z/m)` becomes an isomorphism on `p`-primary parts for `i` large enough.\n    Specifically, the map `K_i(Z)_p \\to K_i(Z/p^k)_p` is surjective for `i \\ge p^k-1`.\n    *   For our case, `p=3` and `k=3`, so `m=27`. The map `K_{2n}(Z)_3 \\to K_{2n}(Z/27)_3` is surjective for `2n \\ge 27-1 = 26`.\n    *   The `3`-primary part of the even K-groups of `Z`, `K_{2n}(Z)_3`, is known to be zero for `n > 0`.\n    *   Therefore, for `2n \\ge 26`, the group `K_{2n}(Z/27)_3` must be the image of a zero group, so it must be zero.\n    *   This gives us an upper bound for `n`: `2n < 26`, which means `n < 13`. The largest natural number `n` satisfying this is `n=12`.\n\n4.  **Verify if `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is non-zero for `n=12`:**\n    We need to check if `K_{24}(Z/27)` is non-zero. According to a landmark paper by Geisser and Hesselholt (Annals of Mathematics, 2006) on the K-theory of `Z/p^k`, the `p`-primary part of the even K-groups is given by:\n    `K_{2n}(Z/p^k)_p \\cong Z/p^k` if `n` is a multiple of `p-1`.\n    `K_{2n}(Z/p^k)_p = 0` if `n` is not a multiple of `p-1`.\n    *   For our case, `p=3`, `k=3`. The condition is that `n` must be a multiple of `p-1=2`, i.e., `n` must be even.\n    *   For `n=12`, `n` is even. The formula gives `K_{24}(Z/27)_3 \\cong Z/27`.\n    *   Since `K_{24}(Z/27)_3` is non-zero, `K_{24}(Z/27)` is non-zero.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The K-group `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is zero for `n \\ge 13`. The largest `n` for which it could be non-zero is `n=12`. Step 4 confirms that for `n=12`, the group is indeed non-zero. Therefore, the largest such `n` is 12.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_k_group_info(n, p, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines if K_{2n}(Z/p^k) is non-zero based on known results.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The index 'n' for the K-group K_{2n}.\n        p (int): The prime number.\n        k (int): The power of the prime.\n        \n    Returns:\n        str: A string indicating if the group is non-zero and why.\n    \"\"\"\n    m = p**k\n    \n    # Stability result: K_{2n}(Z/m)_p is zero for 2n >= m-1\n    stability_bound = m - 1\n    if 2 * n >= stability_bound:\n        return f\"For n = {n}, 2n = {2*n}.
