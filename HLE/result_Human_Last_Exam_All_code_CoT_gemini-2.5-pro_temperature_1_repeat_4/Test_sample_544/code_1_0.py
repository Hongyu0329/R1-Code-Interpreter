    This script determines the IUPAC name of the product from the described reaction.
    The reaction is a Pummerer-type reaction.

    Reaction:
    1 Methyl phenyl sulfoxide + 1 Triflic anhydride + 1 Trimethylsilyl cyanide -> Product

    Steps:
    1.  Activation of the sulfoxide with triflic anhydride to form [Ph-S(OTf)-Me]+.
    2.  Deprotonation of the methyl group to form an ylide-like intermediate.
    3.  Elimination of the triflate group to form an electrophilic thionium ion [Ph-S=CH2]+.
    4.  Nucleophilic attack by cyanide (from Me3SiCN) on the CH2 carbon.

    Product Structure: Ph-S-CH2-CN
