    "This problem requires identifying the product of a multi-step organic reaction and then determining its correct IUPAC name.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction**: This is a modified Pummerer reaction. I will break it down into steps:\n    *   **Activation**: The sulfoxide oxygen atom attacks the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride.\n    *   **Deprotonation**: A base removes a proton from the carbon adjacent to the newly formed positively charged sulfur atom. The protons on the methyl group are the most acidic.\n    *   **Intermediate Formation**: The activated group leaves, forming a key electrophilic intermediate called a thionium ion.\n    *   **Nucleophilic Attack**: The cyanide nucleophile (from trimethylsilyl cyanide) attacks the electrophilic thionium ion to form the final product.\n\n2.  **Identify the Product**: Based on the mechanism, the final product will have the structure C₆H₅-S-CH₂-CN.\n\n3.  **Determine IUPAC Name**: I will apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to name the product structure C₆H₅-S-CH₂-CN. The nitrile group has higher priority, making \"ethanenitrile\" the parent chain. The C₆H₅-S- group becomes a substituent named \"phenylthio\".\n\n4.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script that programmatically constructs the IUPAC name from its components and prints the balanced reaction equation, including the stoichiometric coefficients as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the IUPAC name of the product from the described reaction.\n    The reaction is a Pummerer-type reaction.\n\n    Reaction:\n    1 Methyl phenyl sulfoxide + 1 Triflic anhydride + 1 Trimethylsilyl cyanide -> Product\n\n    Steps:\n    1.  Activation of the sulfoxide with triflic anhydride to form [Ph-S(OTf)-Me]+.\n    2.  Deprotonation of the methyl group to form an ylide-like intermediate.\n    3.  Elimination of the triflate group to form an electrophilic thionium ion [Ph-S=CH2]+.\n    4.
