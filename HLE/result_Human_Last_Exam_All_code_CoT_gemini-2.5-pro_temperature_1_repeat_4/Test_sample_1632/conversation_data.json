    "To find a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan (2D square) lattice, we can use a recursive counting algorithm. A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that never visits the same point twice.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will model the walk on a 2D grid starting from the origin (0, 0).\n2.  The algorithm will explore all possible paths of length 10 by recursively taking one step at a time in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).\n3.  To ensure the \"self-avoiding\" property, the algorithm will keep track of all points visited in the current path. A move is considered valid only if it leads to a point that has not been visited before.\n4.  The core of the solution is a recursive function. This function's state includes the current position, the number of steps remaining, and the set of visited points.\n5.  The recursion's base case is when there are no steps left (10 steps have been taken). When this occurs, a valid walk has been found, and we count it as 1.\n6.  The total number of walks, a(10), is the sum of all valid walks found by this exhaustive exploration. To make the computation efficient, the recursive function will modify the set of visited points in place, backtracking after each recursive call.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef solve_saw_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D square lattice.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n\n    def count_walks_recursive(x, y, steps_left, visited):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts the number of self-avoiding walks.\n\n        Args:\n            x (int): The current x-coordinate.\n            y (int): The current y-coordinate.\n            steps_left (int): The number of steps remaining in the walk.\n            visited (set): A set of (x, y) tuples representing visited points.\n\n        Returns:\n            int: The number of valid self-avoiding walks from the current state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If no steps are left, we have successfully found one valid walk.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        count = 0\n        # Explore the four neighboring points.\n        # Moves are represented as (dx, dy).\n        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n\n            # Check if the neighbor has been visited.\n            if (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                # If not visited, add it to the path and recurse.\n                visited.add((nx, ny))\n                count += count_walks_recursive(nx, ny, steps_left - 1, visited)\n                # Backtrack: remove the point to explore other paths.\n                visited.remove((nx, ny))\n        \n        return count\n\n    # The walk starts at the origin (0, 0).\n    start_pos = (0, 0)\n    # The initial path contains only the starting point.\n    initial_visited = {start_pos}\n\n    # Start the recursive counting process.\n    total_walks = count_walks_recursive(start_pos[0], start_pos[1], n, initial_visited)\n\n    # Print the final result in the format a(n) = result.\n    print(f\"a({n}) = {total_walks}\")\n\nsolve_saw_count()\n```\n<<<47436>>>"
