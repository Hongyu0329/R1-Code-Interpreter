    "Yes, it does follow that $f=0$. Here is the step-by-step reasoning.\n\nThe problem states that $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a Schwartz function, which means it is infinitely differentiable and, along with all its derivatives, decays faster than any polynomial at infinity. We are given that all its moments are zero:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx = 0 \\quad \\text{for all non-negative integers } k $$\nWe want to determine if this implies that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$. We can solve this by analyzing the Fourier transform of $f$.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define the Fourier transform of $f(x)$, which we'll call $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$.\n2.  Calculate the derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ with respect to $\\xi$ and evaluate them at $\\xi=0$.\n3.  Show that these derivatives are directly related to the moments of $f(x)$.\n4.  Use the given condition (all moments are zero) to show that all derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at $\\xi=0$ are zero.\n5.  A key property of Schwartz functions is that their Fourier transforms are also Schwartz functions, which are analytic (i.e., equal to their Taylor series). If all derivatives at a point are zero, the function must be identically zero.\n6.  Finally, since the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is zero, and the Fourier transform is an invertible map on the space of Schwartz functions, the original function $f(x)$ must also be zero.\n\nThe following Python code will print this argument step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_schwartz_moment_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains why a Schwartz function with all zero moments must be the zero function.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The Fourier Transform and its derivatives\")\n    print(\"Let f(x) be a Schwartz function.
