    "To find the equilibrium point for the Prisoner's Dilemma in a quantum setting, we will use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. This framework introduces quantum mechanics to the classical game, potentially leading to new strategies and equilibrium outcomes that can resolve the dilemma.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Establish the Quantum Game Framework:** The game begins with the two players' choices (qubits) initialized in a maximally entangled state. This is achieved by applying an entangling operator `J` to the initial state `|Cooperate, Cooperate⟩` (`|CC⟩`). The operator `J` is defined as `J = cos(γ/2) * I⊗I + i * sin(γ/2) * σ_x⊗σ_x`. For maximal entanglement, we set `γ = π/2`.\n2.  **Define Player Strategies:** Each player's strategy is a unitary operator applied to their qubit. The classical strategies 'Cooperate' (C) and 'Defect' (D) correspond to the quantum gates Identity (`I`) and Pauli-X (`σ_x`), respectively.\n3.  **Find the Nash Equilibrium:** We will analyze the game with the given payoff matrix under maximal entanglement to find the Nash Equilibrium. A Nash Equilibrium is a pair of strategies where neither player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. For this specific payoff matrix, the quantum game transforms into an anti-coordination game, yielding two pure-strategy Nash Equilibria: `(Defect, Cooperate)` and `(Cooperate, Defect)`.\n4.  **Calculate the Equilibrium Payoff:** We will select one of these symmetric equilibria, for example, Player 1 choosing 'Defect' and Player 2 choosing 'Cooperate'. We'll calculate the final quantum state after both players apply their strategy.\n5.  **Determine Outcome Probabilities:** From the final state, we will calculate the probabilities of the four classical outcomes: `(C, C)`, `(C, D)`, `(D, C)`, and `(D, D)`.\n6.  **Compute Final Payoffs:** Using these probabilities and the given payoff matrix, we will compute the expected payoff for each player at this equilibrium point. The Python code below will implement this calculation and display the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef run_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the equilibrium payoff for a quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Payoff Matrix values\n    # (C,C): (R,R) = (5,5)\n    # (C,D): (S,T) = (0,7)\n    # (D,C): (T,S) = (7,0)\n    # (D,D): (P,P) = (1,1)\n    R, S, T, P = 5, 0, 7, 1\n\n    # Define basis states |C> = |0> and |D> = |1>\n    C = np.array([1, 0])\n    D = np.array([0, 1])\n\n    # Basis states for the 2-qubit system\n    CC = np.kron(C, C)\n    CD = np.kron(C, D)\n    DC = np.kron(D, C)\n    DD = np.kron(D, D)\n\n    # Define classical strategies as unitary operators\n    U_C = np.identity(2)  # Cooperate = Identity\n    U_D = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])  # Defect = Pauli-X (sigma_x)\n\n    # EWL framework: Create the entangling operator J for maximal entanglement (gamma = pi/2)\n    I = np.identity(2)\n    sigma_x = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])\n    J = (1 / np.sqrt(2)) * (np.kron(I, I) + 1j * np.kron(sigma_x, sigma_x))\n\n    # Initial state is J|CC>\n    psi_initial = J @ CC\n\n    # A Nash Equilibrium for this payoff matrix is (Player 1: Defect, Player 2: Cooperate)\n    # We create the corresponding operator U_D ⊗ U_C\n    strategy_operator = np.kron(U_D, U_C)\n\n    # Calculate the final state by applying the strategy operator\n    psi_final = strategy_operator @ psi_initial\n\n    # Calculate the probabilities of the four classical outcomes\n    p_cc = np.abs(np.vdot(CC, psi_final))**2\n    p_cd = np.abs(np.vdot(CD, psi_final))**2\n    p_dc = np.abs(np.vdot(DC, psi_final))**2\n    p_dd = np.abs(np.vdot(DD, psi_final))**2\n\n    # Calculate the expected payoff for each player\n    payoff_A = p_cc * R + p_cd * S + p_dc * T + p_dd * P\n    payoff_B = p_cc * R + p_cd * T + p_dc * S + p_dd * P\n\n    print(\"Chosen Equilibrium: (Player 1: Defect, Player 2: Cooperate)\\n\")\n    print(\"Probabilities of classical outcomes:\")\n    print(f\"P(C,C) = {p_cc:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"P(C,D) = {p_cd:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"P(D,C) = {p_dc:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"P(D,D) = {p_dd:.2f}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Payoff Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Player 1 Payoff = P(C,C)*{R} + P(C,D)*{S} + P(D,C)*{T} + P(D,D)*{P}\")\n    print(f\"                = {p_cc:.2f}*{R} + {p_cd:.2f}*{S} + {p_dc:.2f}*{T} + {p_dd:.2f}*{P} = {payoff_A:.2f}\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Player 2 Payoff = P(C,C)*{R} + P(C,D)*{T} + P(D,C)*{S} + P(D,D)*{P}\")\n    print(f\"                = {p_cc:.2f}*{R} + {p_cd:.2f}*{T} + {p_dc:.2f}*{S} + {p_dd:.2f}*{P} = {payoff_B:.2f}\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"The equilibrium point results in the payoff ({payoff_A:.2f}, {payoff_B:.2f}).\")\n\nrun_quantum_prisoners_dilemma()\n<<<3.5>>>\n```"
