# The problem asks for the value of 'a' at which the volume constraint
# ceases to be the only obstruction for the symplectic embedding of the
# ellipsoid E(1,a) into a ball.
# This transition point is known to be a = tau^4, where tau is the golden ratio.

# We derive the exact form of a = tau^4 = ((1+sqrt(5))/2)^4
# a = (7 + 3*sqrt(5)) / 2

# Here are the numbers in the final equation:
numerator_constant_part = 7
numerator_sqrt_coefficient = 3
sqrt_radicand = 5
denominator = 2

# We will now print the final equation and compute its value.
print("The value of 'a' is given by the equation:")
print(f"a = ({numerator_constant_part} + {numerator_sqrt_coefficient} * sqrt({sqrt_radicand})) / {denominator}")

# Calculate the numerical value
value_of_a = (numerator_constant_part + numerator_sqrt_coefficient * math.sqrt(sqrt_radicand)) / denominator

print("\nThe numerical value is:")
print(value_of_a)
