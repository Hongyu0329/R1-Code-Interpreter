Your understanding that components perpendicular to the local magnetic field should be used is correct. The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial due to the Parker Spiral. Therefore, a coordinate transformation into a field-aligned system is a necessary step in the data analysis to correctly calculate magnetic helicity.
