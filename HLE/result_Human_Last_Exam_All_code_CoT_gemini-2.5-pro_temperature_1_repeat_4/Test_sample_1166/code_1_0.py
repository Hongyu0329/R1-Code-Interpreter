    Analyzes which functions are necessarily Lebesgue integrable.

    A function f is Lebesgue integrable if:
    1. f is measurable.
    2. The integral of its absolute value is finite (∫|f|dμ < ∞).

    Let's check each option:
    A. A bounded function: Not necessarily measurable. (e.g., indicator of a Vitali set).
    B. A bounded measurable function: Not necessarily integrable if the domain's measure is infinite (e.g., f(x)=1 on R).
    C. A measurable function: Can have an infinite integral (e.g., f(x)=x on R).
    D. A continuous function: Same as C.
    E. A measurable function on [a,b]: Can have an infinite integral (e.g., f(x)=1/x on [0,1]).
    F. A continuous function on [a,b]: Yes. On a compact set, it's bounded. A bounded measurable function on a finite measure set is integrable.
    G. A bounded function on [a,b]: Not necessarily measurable.
    H. A function whose absolute value is integrable: f itself might not be measurable.
    I. A function whose absolute value is integrable on [a,b]: Same as H.
    J. A continuous function on (a,b): Can be unbounded (e.g., f(x)=1/(x-a) on (a,b)).
    H. (re-listed) A bounded function on (a,b): Not necessarily measurable.
    K. A measurable function on (a,b): Can be unbounded (e.g., f(x)=1/(x-a) on (a,b)).
    L. A measurable function whose absolute value is integrable: Yes. This is the definition of Lebesgue integrability.
    M. A bounded continuous function on (a,b): Yes. Continuous implies measurable. Bounded on a finite measure set implies integrable.

    The correct options are F, L, and M.
