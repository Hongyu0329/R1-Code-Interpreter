    "To determine whether `1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)` overestimates, underestimates, or correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy (`VE_p`) for an all-or-nothing vaccine, I will follow a logical, step-by-step calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Model:** I'll start by defining the characteristics of an all-or-nothing vaccine. In this model, a certain fraction of vaccinated individuals, let's call it `v`, are perfectly protected from infection, while the remaining fraction, `1-v`, have no protection at all. The true per-exposure vaccine efficacy, `VE_p`, is therefore equal to `v`.\n2.  **Model Incidence Rates:** I will represent the incidence rates for the unvaccinated (`IR_u`) and vaccinated (`IR_v`) groups mathematically. I'll use `λ` (lambda) to denote the background hazard of infection for any susceptible person.\n    *   For the unvaccinated group, everyone is susceptible, so `IR_u = λ`.\n    *   For the vaccinated group, the rate is an average: the protected fraction `v` has an infection rate of 0, and the unprotected fraction `1-v` has a rate of `λ`. Thus, `IR_v = (1-v) * λ`.\n3.  **Calculate Estimated Efficacy:** I will then calculate the vaccine efficacy as it would be measured using the incidence rate ratio: `VE_estimated = 1 - IRR = 1 - (IR_v / IR_u)`.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** By substituting the expressions for `IR_v` and `IR_u` into the formula, I will simplify the result for `VE_estimated` and compare it directly to the true efficacy, `VE_p`. A Python script will be used to demonstrate these calculations numerically and print the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_vaccine_efficacy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes if 1-IRR correctly estimates per-exposure efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define parameters for the \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine model.\n    # Let's assume a vaccine that gives 80% of recipients perfect immunity.\n    # The true per-exposure efficacy (VE_p) is the proportion of the vaccinated\n    # population that is fully protected.\n    v_true_efficacy = 0.8\n\n    # Let's assume an underlying infection hazard rate for any susceptible individual.\n    # The exact value doesn't matter as it will cancel out, but we use one for a clear demonstration.\n    lambda_hazard = 0.05 # e.g., 5 cases per 100 person-years at risk\n\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Model Setup ---\")\n    print(f\"The true per-exposure vaccine efficacy (v) is the proportion of vaccinated people who are fully protected.\")\n    print(f\"True VE (v) = {v_true_efficacy}\")\n    print(f\"The underlying hazard of infection (λ) for a susceptible person is {lambda_hazard}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the Incidence Rate in the Unvaccinated Group (IR_u).\n    # Since everyone in this group is susceptible, their incidence rate is simply lambda.\n    IR_u = lambda_hazard\n    print(\"--- Step 2: Calculate Incidence Rate in Unvaccinated Group ---\")\n    print(\"The incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (IR_u) equals the base hazard λ.\")\n    print(f\"IR_u = λ = {IR_u}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the Incidence Rate in the Vaccinated Group (IR_v).\n    # This is a weighted average.
