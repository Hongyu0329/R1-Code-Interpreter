def solve_scattering_statements():
    """
    This function identifies and prints the correct statements about two-channel quantum scattering.

    The analysis relies on the principle from scattering theory that the coupling structure
    is preserved in the mappings between the potential V(r), the Jost matrix F(E), and
    the S-matrix S(E).

    Specifically, V is nontrivially coupled if and only if S is nontrivially coupled,
    if and only if F is nontrivially coupled.

    - Statement 1: Correct (V <=> S equivalence).
    - Statement 2: Correct (special diagonal case of V <=> S equivalence).
    - Statement 3: Correct (V <=> F equivalence).
    - Statement 4: Correct (F <=> S equivalence).
    - Statement 5: Incorrect (contradicts the V <=> F equivalence).
