    # Step 3: Explain the biological cause of lupus nephritis.
    print("\n3. Lupus nephritis is caused by immune complexes (antibody-antigen clusters) depositing in the kidneys. This deposition triggers a strong inflammatory reaction.")
    
    # Step 4: Link the biological cause to a measurable lab value.

    # Step 5: Conclude with the most specific lab parameter.
