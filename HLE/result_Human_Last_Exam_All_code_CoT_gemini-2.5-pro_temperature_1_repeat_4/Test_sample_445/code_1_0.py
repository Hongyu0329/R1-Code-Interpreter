    This function calculates the maximal probability p for Alice's success.

    Alice's optimal strategy is as follows:
    1. Choose a number of boxes to open, k, where 1 <= k <= 19.
    2. To guarantee the probability against any set of numbers, her strategy must be random.
       She chooses k boxes to open uniformly at random.
    3. After observing the k numbers, she finds their minimum (o_min) and maximum (o_max).
    4. She then picks one of the (20-k) closed boxes at random and guesses its value
       lies in the interval [o_min, o_max].

    The probability of success for this strategy with k opened boxes is P(k) = (k-1)/(k+1).
    To find the maximal probability, Alice should choose k to maximize this value.
    The function f(k) = (k-1)/(k+1) increases as k increases.
    Therefore, Alice should choose the largest possible k, which is 19.
