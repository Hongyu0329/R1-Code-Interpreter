    Solves the stable commutator length problem.

    The problem asks for the stable commutator length (scl) of the element g1*h2
    in the free product G1*G2.

    There are two main issues with the problem as stated:
    1. The group G is defined as homeomorphisms preserving the set of dyadic rationals (Z[1/2]).
       However, the given elements g (translation by 2/27) and h (translation by 16/27)
       do not preserve this set. For example, g(0) = 2/27, which is not a dyadic rational.
       Therefore, g and h are not in G.
    2. The stable commutator length is standardly defined for elements in the commutator
       subgroup [G,G]. The element g1*h2 is not in the commutator subgroup of G1*G2,
       because its image in the abelianization is non-trivial. The scl for such an
       element is typically considered to be infinite or undefined.

    The most reasonable interpretation is that the problem has typos and intends to ask for the
    scl of the commutator [g1, h2] = g1*h2*g1^(-1)*h2^(-1). We assume that g1 and h2
    are non-trivial elements of the respective groups G1 and G2. The specific values
    for the translations serve to identify these elements.

    The stable commutator length of a commutator of non-torsion elements from different factors
    in a free product is a standard result in geometric group theory. For any groups A and B,
    and any non-torsion elements a in A and b in B, the stable commutator length of
    [a, b] in A * B is 1/2.

    The proof involves constructing a quasimorphism on the free product A * B from its action on its
    Bass-Serre tree, which shows scl([a,b]) <= 1/2. A lower bound of 1/2 is obtained by mapping
    A * B to a free group F_2.

    The specific rotation numbers of g (2/27) and h (16/27) confirm that the elements are
    non-trivial and not torsion elements, but the values themselves do not enter the
    final calculation.
