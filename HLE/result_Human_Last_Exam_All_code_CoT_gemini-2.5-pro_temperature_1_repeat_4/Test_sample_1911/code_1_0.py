    Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the false statement:

    1.  **Analyze the set L**: The set L is the graph of y = |x|, which is a V-shape with a corner at the origin. Topologically, L is homeomorphic to the real line R.

    2.  **Analyze Statement A**: L can be represented as the image of an immersion of a 1-manifold with boundary (the disjoint union of two copies of [0, infinity)) into R^2. So, statement A is TRUE.

    3.  **Analyze Statement B**: It is possible to construct a smooth (C-infinity) curve whose image is L. This requires using a non-analytic smooth function to parameterize the x-coordinate, which allows the y-coordinate y = |x| to also be smooth despite the absolute value. So, statement B is TRUE.

    4.  **Analyze Statement C**: L is homeomorphic to R. Any smooth structure on L must make it diffeomorphic to R. The sphere S^n is not homeomorphic to R for any n (for n>=1, S^n is compact while R is not; for n=0, S^0 is disconnected while R is connected). Since a diffeomorphism is a homeomorphism, L cannot be diffeomorphic to S^n for any n. So, statement C is FALSE.

    5.  **Analyze Statement D**: Since L is homeomorphic to R, it can be given the structure of the Lie group (R, +) via this homeomorphism. So, statement D is TRUE.

    6.  **Analyze Statement E**: Considering "smooth manifold" to mean a smooth submanifold of R^2 (which is standard in this context), the set L is not smooth only at the origin (0,0). Removing any other point leaves the origin, and thus the corner, in the set. Removing the origin z = (0,0) leaves two disjoint smooth rays. Thus, there is a unique point z=(0,0) whose removal makes L a smooth submanifold. So, statement E is TRUE.

    Based on the analysis, the only false statement is C.
