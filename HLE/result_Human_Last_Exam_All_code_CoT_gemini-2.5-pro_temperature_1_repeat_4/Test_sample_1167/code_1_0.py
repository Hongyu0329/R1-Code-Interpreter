    This function determines the exponent alpha for the upper bound of |X|.
    
    Let X = {x in [0, 1]: exists t such that |sum_{n=1 to N} a_n e^{2*pi*i*(n*x + n^2*t)}| > N^{3/8}}.
    The sequence {a_n} has l^2 norm of 1.
    We need to find alpha such that the best upper bound of |X| is close to N^alpha.

    1. Lower Bound Construction:
    Let's choose a sequence a_n to make the set X as large as possible.
    Let L be an integer, L <= N.
    Let a_n = 1/sqrt(L) for n in {1, ..., L} and a_n = 0 for n > L.
    This sequence satisfies sum(|a_n|^2) = L * (1/L) = 1.
    Let S(x, t) be the sum. Let's analyze it for t=0:
    S(x, 0) = (1/sqrt(L)) * sum_{n=1 to L} e^{2*pi*i*n*x}.
    For x close to 0, say |x| < 1/(2L), the magnitude |S(x, 0)| is approximately sqrt(L).
    For x to be in X, we need max_t |S(x,t)| > N^{3/8}.
    Our choice gives max_t |S(x,t)| >= |S(x,0)| approx sqrt(L).
    So we need sqrt(L) > N^{3/8}, which means L > N^{3/4}.
    Let's choose L = ceil(N^{3/4}) + 1. For large N, L <= N is satisfied.
    The set of x values for which |S(x,0)| is large includes an interval around x=0 of width proportional to 1/L.
    The measure of this set is at least of the order 1/L.
    |X| >= c * (1/L) = c * (1/N^{3/4}) = c * N^{-3/4}.
    This implies that alpha must be at least -3/4.

    2. Upper Bound Argument Sketch:
    Using Chebyshev's inequality with the 4th power:
    |X| <= (N^{3/8})^{-4} * integral_{0 to 1} (max_t |S(x,t)|)^4 dx
    |X| <= N^{-3/2} * integral_{0 to 1} (max_t |S(x,t)|)^4 dx.
    The integral term is the subject of deep results in harmonic analysis (maximal function estimates for the Schrodinger equation).
    The worst-case behavior for this integral appears to be generated by a construction similar to the one we used for the lower bound.
    The calculation for our specific sequence a_n gives:
    integral_{0 to 1} (max_t |S(x,t)|)^4 dx >= integral_{0 to 1} |S(x,0)|^4 dx
      = (1/L^2) * integral_{0 to 1} |sum_{n=1 to L} e^{2*pi*i*n*x}|^4 dx
      ~ (1/L^2) * (L^3) = L = N^{3/4}.
    Assuming this is indeed the sharp bound for the integral, i.e.,
    integral_{0 to 1} (max_t |S(x,t)|)^4 dx <= C * N^{3/4},
    we get:
    |X| <= N^{-3/2} * C * N^{3/4} = C * N^{-3/4}.
    This gives an upper bound with alpha <= -3/4.

    3. Conclusion:
    Since the lower bound and upper bound for alpha meet at -3/4, this is the best possible exponent.
    alpha = -3/4.
