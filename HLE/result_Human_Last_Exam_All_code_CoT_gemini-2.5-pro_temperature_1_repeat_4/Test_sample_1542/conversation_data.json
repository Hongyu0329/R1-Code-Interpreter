    "To find the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R=\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, we can perform a computational search. A quadratic form in two variables is given by $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where the coefficients $a, b, c$ are in $R$. There are $8^3 = 512$ such forms in total.\n\nTwo forms, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, are equivalent if there exists an invertible linear transformation $T$ such that $Q_2(v) = Q_1(T(v))$ for all vectors $v=(x,y)$. Such a transformation $T$ can be represented by a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $P$ with entries in $R$. The matrix $P$ must be invertible, which means its determinant, $\\det(P)$, must be a unit in $R$. The units in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\n\nThe problem is thus equivalent to finding the number of orbits of the set of all 512 quadratic forms under the action of the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$ of invertible $2 \\times 2$ matrices.\n\nHere is the plan for the Python code to solve this problem:\n1.  **Generate all quadratic forms:** Create a list of all 512 possible tuples `(a, b, c)` representing the coefficients of the quadratic forms.\n2.  **Generate the transformation group:** Create a list of all invertible $2 \\times 2$ matrices over $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. A matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\\\ r & s \\end{pmatrix}$ is invertible if its determinant $ps - qr \\pmod 8$ is one of $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\n3.  **Define the group action:** Implement a function that takes a quadratic form `(a, b, c)` and a matrix `P` and returns the new transformed form `(a', b', c')`. The formulas for the new coefficients are:\n    *   $a' = ap^2 + bpr + cr^2 \\pmod 8$\n    *   $b' = 2apq + b(ps+qr) + 2crs \\pmod 8$\n    *   $c' = aq^2 + bqs + cs^2 \\pmod 8$\n4.  **Count the orbits:**\n    *   Initialize a set `visited_forms` to keep track of forms that belong to an orbit we have already counted.\n    *   Initialize a counter for the number of classes to zero.\n    *   Iterate through each of the 512 forms. For each form `f`:\n        *   If `f` is already in `visited_forms`, skip it.\n        *   If not, we have found a new equivalence class. Increment the class counter.\n        *   Compute the entire orbit of `f` by applying all invertible matrices to it.\n        *   Add all forms in this newly found orbit to the `visited_forms` set.\n5.  **Print the result:** The final value of the counter is the number of equivalence classes.\n\nThis algorithm systematically explores the set of all forms, ensuring that each equivalence class is counted exactly once.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables\n    over the ring Z/8Z.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 8\n\n    # 1.
