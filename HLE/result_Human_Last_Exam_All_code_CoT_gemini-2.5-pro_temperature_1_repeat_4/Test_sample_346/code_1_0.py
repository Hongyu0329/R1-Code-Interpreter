# The problem asks for log_2(n), where n is the Church integer represented by:
# S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))

# Step 1: Deconstruct the expression's structure.
# The expression has the form E = S(I)(Y)(Z).
# The combinator S(I) reduces as follows: S(I)(Y)(Z) -> Z(Y(Z)).
# Our expression is E = S(I) (S(I)(S(I)(A))) (B), where A and B are the inner terms.
# Applying the reduction rule repeatedly gives:
# E = B ( S(I)(S(I)(A)) (B) )
# E = B ( B ( S(I)(A) (B) ) )
# E = B ( B ( B ( A(B) ) ) )
# This shows that n is the result of applying the function represented by B three times, starting with the value from A(B).

# Step 2: Analyze the components A and B, assuming a common typo.
# A = K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))
# B = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))
# The sub-expression P = S(S(K(S))(K)) is likely a typo for the standard multiplication combinator,
# MULT = S(S(K S)K). The difference is a single space, and MULT is a fundamental operator.
# Let's proceed with P = MULT.

# Step 3: Evaluate A and B under this assumption.
# A = K(MULT(I))
# B = MULT(S(I)(I))

# 'I' is the Church numeral for 1. The operator MULT(I) means "multiply by 1", which is the identity function, I.
# Therefore, A = K(I).

# 'S(I)(I)' is the self-application combinator, U. We need to find what B = MULT(U) does.
# The operator (MULT U n) corresponds to composing U with a church numeral n, written as (U o n).
# Let's see what (U o n) does when applied to a function `f`:
# (U o n) f -> U(n f).
# Let g = (n f), which is the function that applies `f`, `n` times.
# U(g) means g(g). So, U(n f) -> (n f)(n f).
# When applied to a value x, this becomes (n f)((n f) x).
# This is equivalent to applying f^n (f applied n times) to the result of f^n(x).
# This results in f^(n+n)(x), or f^(2n)(x).
# So, B = MULT(U) is the DOUBLING operator for Church numerals.

# Step 4: Evaluate the full expression n = B(B(B(A(B)))).
# First, find the starting value x = A(B).
# A = K(I) and B = DOUBLE.
# A(B) = K(I)(DOUBLE) -> I.
# The identity combinator 'I' is the Church numeral for 1.
# So our starting value is 1.

# Now we evaluate n = DOUBLE(DOUBLE(DOUBLE(1))).
n = 1
n = 2 * n  # DOUBLE(1) = 2
n = 2 * n  # DOUBLE(2) = 4
n = 2 * n  # DOUBLE(4) = 8

# Step 5: Calculate the final result.
# We have found that the integer n is 8. The problem asks for log_2(n).
final_result = math.log2(n)

print("Based on symbolic reduction, the expression simplifies as follows:")
print("n = Double(Double(Double(1)))")
print(f"n = {n}")
print("\nThe final equation is:")
# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
# The number for the log is n=8. The result is 3.0.
print(f"log_2({n}) = {final_result}")
