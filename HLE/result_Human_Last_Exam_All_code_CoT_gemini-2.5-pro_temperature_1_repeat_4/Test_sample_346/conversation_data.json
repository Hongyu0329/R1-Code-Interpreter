    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Expression:** First, I will break down the complex SKI expression into a more understandable structure. The expression follows a pattern of repeated application.\n2.  **Identify Key Combinators:** I will analyze the components of the expression. This involves recognizing standard combinators or deriving the function they represent. I will show that a part of the expression, `S(S(K(S))(K))`, is very likely a typo for the standard multiplication combinator, `S(S(K S)K)`.\n3.  **Symbolic Reduction:** Based on the likely meaning of the combinators, I will evaluate the different parts of the expression symbolically.\n    *   I will show that one part, `A`, provides the initial value for our calculation.\n    *   I will show that another part, `B`, represents a well-known arithmetic operation on Church integers (numbers represented in this system).\n4.  **Calculate n:** By applying the operation from `B` repeatedly to the initial value from `A`, as dictated by the expression's structure, I will calculate the final integer value, `n`.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Once `n` is found, I will calculate `log_2(n)` to get the final answer.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through this symbolic evaluation step-by-step and print the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem asks for log_2(n), where n is the Church integer represented by:\n# S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))\n\n# Step 1: Deconstruct the expression's structure.\n# The expression has the form E = S(I)(Y)(Z).\n# The combinator S(I) reduces as follows: S(I)(Y)(Z) -> Z(Y(Z)).\n# Our expression is E = S(I) (S(I)(S(I)(A))) (B), where A and B are the inner terms.\n# Applying the reduction rule repeatedly gives:\n# E = B ( S(I)(S(I)(A)) (B) )\n# E = B ( B ( S(I)(A) (B) ) )\n# E = B ( B ( B ( A(B) ) ) )\n# This shows that n is the result of applying the function represented by B three times, starting with the value from A(B).\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the components A and B, assuming a common typo.\n# A = K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))\n# B = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))\n# The sub-expression P = S(S(K(S))(K)) is likely a typo for the standard multiplication combinator,\n# MULT = S(S(K S)K). The difference is a single space, and MULT is a fundamental operator.\n# Let's proceed with P = MULT.\n\n# Step 3: Evaluate A and B under this assumption.\n# A = K(MULT(I))\n# B = MULT(S(I)(I))\n\n# 'I' is the Church numeral for 1. The operator MULT(I) means \"multiply by 1\", which is the identity function, I.\n# Therefore, A = K(I).\n\n# 'S(I)(I)' is the self-application combinator, U. We need to find what B = MULT(U) does.\n# The operator (MULT U n) corresponds to composing U with a church numeral n, written as (U o n).\n# Let's see what (U o n) does when applied to a function `f`:\n# (U o n) f -> U(n f).\n# Let g = (n f), which is the function that applies `f`, `n` times.\n# U(g) means g(g). So, U(n f) -> (n f)(n f).\n# When applied to a value x, this becomes (n f)((n f) x).\n# This is equivalent to applying f^n (f applied n times) to the result of f^n(x).\n# This results in f^(n+n)(x), or f^(2n)(x).\n# So, B = MULT(U) is the DOUBLING operator for Church numerals.\n\n# Step 4: Evaluate the full expression n = B(B(B(A(B)))).\n# First, find the starting value x = A(B).\n# A = K(I) and B = DOUBLE.\n# A(B) = K(I)(DOUBLE) -> I.\n# The identity combinator 'I' is the Church numeral for 1.\n# So our starting value is 1.\n\n# Now we evaluate n = DOUBLE(DOUBLE(DOUBLE(1))).\nn = 1\nn = 2 * n  # DOUBLE(1) = 2\nn = 2 * n  # DOUBLE(2) = 4\nn = 2 * n  # DOUBLE(4) = 8\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the final result.\n# We have found that the integer n is 8. The problem asks for log_2(n).\nfinal_result = math.log2(n)\n\nprint(\"Based on symbolic reduction, the expression simplifies as follows:\")\nprint(\"n = Double(Double(Double(1)))\")\nprint(f\"n = {n}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.\n# The number for the log is n=8. The result is 3.0.\nprint(f\"log_2({n}) = {final_result}\")\n\n<<<3.0>>>\n```"
