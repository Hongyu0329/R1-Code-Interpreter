# Step 1: Define the historical figures based on research.
# By 1823, the population of the Talbot Settlement had grown significantly.
settlers_by_1823 = 20000

# Colonel Talbot's original personal land grant was 5,000 acres.
original_grant_acres = 5000

# He eventually came to administer a vast tract of land totaling around 650,000 acres.
total_claimed_acres = 650000

# Step 2: Calculate the difference in acreage.
acreage_difference = total_claimed_acres - original_grant_acres

# Step 3: Print the answers clearly.
print(f"Number of migrants settled between 1803 and 1823: {settlers_by_1823}")
print("\nCalculating the difference in acreage:")
print(f"Total acreage claimed: {total_claimed_acres}")
print(f"Original land grant: {original_grant_acres}")
print(f"The difference is calculated as: {total_claimed_acres} - {original_grant_acres} = {acreage_difference}")
print(f"The acreage claimed by Colonel Talbot was {acreage_difference} acres larger than his original grant.")
