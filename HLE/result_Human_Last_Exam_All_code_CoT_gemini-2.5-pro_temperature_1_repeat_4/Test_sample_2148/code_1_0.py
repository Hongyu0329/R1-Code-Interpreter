    # Step 1: Determine the value of X2.
    # We are given two expressions for the decay rate Γ(Z -> ν ν-bar):
    # 1) Γ = X2 * G_F * m_Z^3
    # 2) Γ = (G_F * m_Z^3) / (12 * sqrt(2) * π) * (c_V^2 + c_A^2)
    # By equating these, we can find X2:
    # X2 = (c_V^2 + c_A^2) / (12 * math.sqrt(2) * math.pi)
    
    cv2_plus_ca2 = c_V**2 + c_A**2  # This equals 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5
    
    # Substituting the value of c_V^2 + c_A^2:
    # X2 = 0.5 / (12 * sqrt(2) * π) = 1 / (24 * sqrt(2) * π)
    
    # Step 2: Find the relationship between X1 and X2.
    # The general formula for a two-body decay rate is Γ = (1 / (16 * π * m_Z)) * <|M|^2>.
    # The problem provides definitions that we can substitute into this formula:
    # <|M|^2> = X1 * G_F * m_Z^4
    # Γ = X2 * G_F * m_Z^3
    # So, X2 * G_F * m_Z^3 = (1 / (16 * π * m_Z)) * (X1 * G_F * m_Z^4)
    # Simplifying this equation gives a direct relationship: X2 = X1 / (16 * π).
    # This means X1 = 16 * π * X2.

    # Step 3: Calculate the final expression (X1 * X2)^(-1).
    # Substitute X1 = 16 * π * X2 into the expression:
    # (X1 * X2)^-1 = ((16 * π * X2) * X2)^-1 = (16 * π * X2^2)^-1 = 1 / (16 * π * X2^2)
    # Now, substitute the expression for X2 = 1 / (24 * sqrt(2) * π):
    # Result = 1 / (16 * π * (1 / (24 * sqrt(2) * π))^2)
    # Result = 1 / (16 * π / (24^2 * 2 * π^2))
    # Result = (576 * 2 * π^2) / (16 * π)
    # Result = (1152 * π) / 16
    # Result = 72 * π

    # Step 4: Output the final equation and its numerical value.
