  # (a) Is VEST #W[2]-hard if S is identity and T_i matrices commute?
  #
  # If the T_i matrices commute, the sum over all k-subsets becomes a quadratic
  # form of the k-th elementary symmetric polynomial of the matrices, e_k(T_1,...,T_m).
  # This polynomial can be computed using Newton's sums with a number of matrix
  # operations that is FPT in k (fixed-parameter tractable).
  # Since the problem is in FPT, it cannot be #W[2]-hard unless FPT = #W[2],
  # which is considered highly unlikely.
  answer_a = "No"

  # (b) Is VEST #W[1]-hard if T_i are diagonal Z_2-matrices with at most one
  # non-zero entry on the diagonal?
  #
  # These matrices are a specific type of diagonal matrix. All diagonal matrices
  # commute, so this is a special case of (a) and is therefore in FPT.
  # More specifically, the product of k such matrices is non-zero only if all k
  # matrices have their single non-zero entry at the same position. The problem
  # reduces to a sum of binomial coefficients which is solvable in polynomial time.
  # A problem in P cannot be #W[1]-hard unless P = W[1].
  answer_b = "No"

  # (c) If T_i have one non-zero entry in each row, what is the complexity
  # of the decision version of VEST?
  #
  # Matrices with one non-zero entry per row correspond to transformations where
  # each basis vector is mapped to a multiple of another basis vector.
  # Multiplication of such matrices corresponds to function composition. These
  # matrices do not generally commute, breaking the FPT algorithm from part (a).
  # This computational model is powerful enough to simulate a k-step computation
  # of a non-deterministic Turing machine, the canonical W[1]-hard problem.
  # Therefore, the problem is W[1]-hard. It is also in XP, as one can
  # iterate through all O(m^k) choices.
  answer_c = "W[1]-hard"

  # The final answer string is formatted as requested.
