    "My plan is to solve this riddle by first understanding the relationship between colors and music as described by Isaac Newton, and then using that knowledge to find the specific note requested.\n\n1.  **Establish the Mapping:** I will first define the mapping between the seven colors of the spectrum in Newton's color circle and the seven notes of a Western musical scale.\n2.  **Identify the Colors:** The question describes a range between two colors.\n    *   The first color is \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue.\" In additive color mixing (which applies to light), yellow and blue combine to make green.\n    *   The second color is simply \"blue.\"\n3.  **Determine the Musical Range:** Using the mapping from step 1, I will find the musical notes that correspond to green and blue.\n4.  **Find the Final Note:** The question asks for a single note that \"corresponds to the range.\" Since the range starts with green and ends with blue (which are adjacent on the scale), I will interpret this as the note corresponding to the start of the range, which is green.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script to represent this logic, defining the color-note mapping in a dictionary and printing out each step of the reasoning to arrive at the final answer, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_newton_note_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle by mapping Newton's colors to musical notes\n    and identifying the note for the specified color range.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the mapping from Newton's color circle to the musical scale.\n    newton_color_notes = {\n        'red': 'C',\n        'orange': 'D',\n        'yellow': 'E',\n        'green': 'F',\n        'blue': 'G',\n        'indigo': 'A',\n        'violet': 'B'\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the start and end colors of the range.\n    # The combination of yellow and blue light produces green.\n    start_color = 'green'\n    end_color = 'blue'\n\n    # Step 3: Find the corresponding notes for the start and end of the range.\n    start_note = newton_color_notes[start_color]\n    end_note = newton_color_notes[end_color]\n\n    # Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final equation.\n    print(\"The riddle describes a range on Newton's color circle.\")\n    print(\"The start of the range is the color produced by mixing yellow and blue, which is green.\")\n    print(\"The end of the range is the color blue.\")\n    print(\"\\nAccording to Newton's mapping of colors to music:\")\n    print(f\"- The color green corresponds to the note: {start_note}\")\n    print(f\"- The color blue corresponds to the note: {end_note}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe question asks for the single note corresponding to the range between green and blue.\")\n    print(\"This range begins with the color green.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"(Color from 'yellow' + 'blue') -> '{start_color}' -> Note '{start_note}'\")\n\nsolve_newton_note_riddle()\n<<<F>>>\n```"
