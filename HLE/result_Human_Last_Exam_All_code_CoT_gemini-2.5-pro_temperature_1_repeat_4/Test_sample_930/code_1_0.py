    Identifies the mutualists of Asclepias fascicularis from a predefined list.

    In this context, mutualism primarily refers to pollination.
    - Adult butterflies, bees, and wasps are pollinators.
    - Ants are generally considered nectar robbers, not effective pollinators of milkweed.
    - Larvae of butterflies are herbivores (antagonistic).
    - Larvae of bees, wasps, and ants do not interact directly with the plant.
