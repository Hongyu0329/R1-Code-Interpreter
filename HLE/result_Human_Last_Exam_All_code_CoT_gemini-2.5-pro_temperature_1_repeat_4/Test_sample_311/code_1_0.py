    # Question 1: How many carbons from compound 11 are present in compound 1?
    # Compound 11 (cis-2-butene-1,4-diol) is a 4-carbon molecule.
    # Ozonolysis cleaves it into two 2-carbon fragments. The synthesis uses one fragment.
    # This 2-carbon fragment is maintained throughout the entire synthesis until the final product, compound 1.
    # The carbons are not lost in any of the subsequent reaction steps.
    carbons_from_11_in_1 = 2
    
    # Question 2: How many oxygens from compound 11 are present in compound 14?
    # Compound 11 has 2 oxygen atoms. After cleavage, one fragment containing one oxygen is used.
    # This oxygen is protected by a TES group.
    # The text states the TES group is removed to form compound 15.
    # Compound 14 is a precursor to 15, so it still contains the TES-protected oxygen.

    # Question 3: How many nitrogens from compound 7 are present in compound 10?
    # The synthesis proceeds from 10 to 7 (10 + 6 -> 7).
    # A single nitrogen atom is introduced from MeNO2 to make compound 10.
    # This same nitrogen atom is present in compound 7 after the addition reaction.
    # The question asks for the number of nitrogens in common, which is 1.

    # The prompt requests that each number in the final answer be outputted.
