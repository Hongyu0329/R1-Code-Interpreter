    "This is a classic Chinese character riddle. Let's break it down step by step to find the answer.\n\nMy plan is to analyze each part of the riddle and map it to a corresponding Chinese character component (radical):\n1.  **\"A wooden stick\"**: This directly translates to the character/radical for \"wood\" or \"tree\", which is 木 (mù).\n2.  **\"a square box\"**: This describes an enclosure, which is the radical 囗 (wéi).\n3.  **\"a ladder placed in the center\"**: This is a metaphorical description of the \"wooden stick\" (木) itself. The character 木 has a horizontal stroke and other lines that can be visually interpreted as a simple ladder. This \"ladder\" is placed inside the \"box\".\n\nBy combining these components, with the \"wooden stick\" (木) inside the \"square box\" (囗), we get the final character. The following Python code will print out this decomposition.\n\n```python\n# 1. Define the components from the riddle\nwooden_stick = \"木\"\nsquare_box = \"囗\"\n\n# 2. Combine the components to form the final character\n# The character is formed by placing the \"wood\" radical inside the \"enclosure\" radical.\nfinal_character = \"困\"\n\n# 3. Print the breakdown of the riddle\nprint(\"Let's solve the riddle by building the character:\")\nprint(f\"The 'square box' is the radical: {square_box}\")\nprint(f\"The 'wooden stick' (which looks like a ladder) is the radical: {wooden_stick}\")\n\n# 4. Print the final equation showing how the parts combine\nprint(\"\\nCombining these parts gives the final character:\")\nprint(f\"{square_box} + {wooden_stick} = {final_character}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe character is {final_character} (kùn), which means 'trapped' or 'difficult'.\")\n```\n<<<困>>>"
