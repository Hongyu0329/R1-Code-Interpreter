# 1. Define the components from the riddle
wooden_stick = "木"
square_box = "囗"

# 2. Combine the components to form the final character
# The character is formed by placing the "wood" radical inside the "enclosure" radical.
final_character = "困"

# 3. Print the breakdown of the riddle
print("Let's solve the riddle by building the character:")
print(f"The 'square box' is the radical: {square_box}")
print(f"The 'wooden stick' (which looks like a ladder) is the radical: {wooden_stick}")

# 4. Print the final equation showing how the parts combine
print("\nCombining these parts gives the final character:")
print(f"{square_box} + {wooden_stick} = {final_character}")

print(f"\nThe character is {final_character} (kùn), which means 'trapped' or 'difficult'.")
