# Step 6: Evaluate the final answer choices.
print("\nEvaluation of Answer Choices:")
print("Most choices contain factual errors (e.g., claiming B is phosphorylated, or that phosphorylation increases A's affinity).")
print("Choice G states: 'Protein B never has a higher affinity for protein C or D than nonphosphorylated protein A, protein B always exists as a dimer in opposition to proteins A, C, and D.'")
print("This is the most accurate conclusion because:")
print("1. Experiment 2 shows non-phosphorylated A outcompetes B, supporting the first clause.")
print("2. All experiments show B as a stable dimer, while A, C, and D exist as monomers or change their oligomeric state, supporting the second clause.")
