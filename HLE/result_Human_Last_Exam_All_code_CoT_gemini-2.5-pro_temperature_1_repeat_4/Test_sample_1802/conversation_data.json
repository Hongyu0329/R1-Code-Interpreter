    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the maximal rank, presented in a Python script as requested.\n\n### Plan to Solve the Task\n\n1.  **Define the Pauli Channel**: I will start by defining a general Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ for a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit). This involves specifying its Kraus operators.\n2.  **Construct the Complementary Channel**: Using the Stinespring dilation theorem, I will determine the Kraus operators for the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$.\n3.  **Relate Channel Rank to Kraus Operators**: The rank of a quantum channel is equal to the rank of its Choi matrix. This, in turn, is determined by the number of linearly independent (vectorized) Kraus operators.\n4.  **Maximize the Rank**: I will analyze the conditions for the linear independence of the complementary channel's Kraus operators. The maximal rank is achieved when these operators are made to be linearly independent, which can be controlled by the probabilities defining the original Pauli channel.\n5.  **State the Final Result**: The derivation will lead to a simple expression for the maximal rank in terms of the system dimension $d$.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan and prints the detailed explanation and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_and_explain():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step derivation for the maximal rank of the\n    complementary channel of a d-dimensional Pauli channel and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"### Task: Find the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel ###\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n### Step-by-Step Derivation ###\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"--- Step 1: The Pauli Channel ---\")\n    print(\"A Pauli channel \\u039B acting on a d-dimensional density matrix \\u03C1 is given by:\")\n    print(\"  \\u039B(\\u03C1) = sum_{k,l=0}^{d-1} p_{k,l} * U_{k,l} * \\u03C1 * (U_{k,l})\\u207A\")\n    print(\"where {U_{k,l} = X\\u1d4f Z\\u02e1} are the d\\u00b2 generalized Pauli operators, and {p_{k,l}} is a probability distribution.\")\n    print(\"The Kraus operators for this channel are A_{k,l} = sqrt(p_{k,l}) * U_{k,l}.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"--- Step 2: The Complementary Channel ---\")\n    print(\"Any channel \\u039B can be represented using a Stinespring isometry V: C\\u1d48 -> C\\u1d48 \\u2297 C^(d\\u00b2) as:\")\n    print(\"  V|\\u03C8> = sum_{k,l} (A_{k,l} |\\u03C8>) \\u2297 |k,l>_E\")\n    print(\"where {|k,l>_E} is an orthonormal basis for the d\\u00b2-dimensional environment space.\")\n    print(\"The complementary channel, \\u039B_tilde, is obtained by tracing out the system space instead of the environment:\")\n    print(\"  \\u039B_tilde(\\u03C1) = Tr_system[V * \\u03C1 * V\\u207A]\")\n    print(\"The Kraus operators for \\u039B_tilde, {B_j}, are formed by taking inner products with a system basis {|j>_S}:\")\n    print(\"  B_j = <j|_S | V, for j = 0, ..., d-1.\")\n    print(\"This gives d operators, each mapping from the input space C\\u1d48 to the environment space C^(d\\u00b2).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Step 3: Rank of the Complementary Channel ---\")\n    print(\"The rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix.
