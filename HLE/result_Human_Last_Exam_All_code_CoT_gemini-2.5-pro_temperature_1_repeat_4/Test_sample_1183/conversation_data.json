    "To determine the symmetry group of the molecule, I will use a computational approach, as visual inspection of a complex SMILES string can be misleading.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will write a Python script that uses the `rdkit` library. RDKit is a cheminformatics toolkit that can interpret the SMILES string and convert it into a molecular structure.\n2.  From the SMILES string, the script will generate a 3D conformation of the molecule. This initial 3D structure is usually not perfect.\n3.  To get a more realistic geometry, the script will perform a quick geometry optimization using the MMFF94 (Merck Molecular Force Field). This adjusts the positions of the atoms to find a low-energy, stable conformation.\n4.  Once I have the optimized 3D coordinates of all atoms, I will use the `pyscf` library. PySCF (Python-based Simulations of Chemistry Framework) is a quantum chemistry package that includes a robust algorithm for symmetry detection.\n5.  I will feed the atomic symbols and their 3D coordinates into PySCF's molecule builder and instruct it to find the symmetry. I will use a slightly relaxed tolerance for the symmetry detection to account for the imperfections of a force-field-optimized geometry.\n6.  Finally, the script will print the determined symmetry point group.\n\nThis method provides a reliable and automated way to find the point group for any given molecule from its SMILES representation, assuming the required libraries (`rdkit`, `pyscf`) are installed.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport subprocess\n\ndef install_and_import(package):\n    \"\"\"\n    Tries to import a package, and if it fails, attempts to install it via pip.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        __import__(package)\n    except ImportError:\n        print(f\"Installing {package}, as it was not found...\")\n        try:\n            subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, \"-m\", \"pip\", \"install\", package])\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Failed to install {package}.
