    "Here is the plan to solve the task:\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Interpret the Goal:** The user wants to find the equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas (Bose case of light quanta). Since a thermal system's equilibrium state depends on a parameter like temperature, the \"values\" will be functions of temperature, `T`.\n\n2.  **Connect to Large Deviation Theory:** The prompt mentions Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. In statistical mechanics, these principles provide the theoretical foundation for why macroscopic systems are found in a state of maximum entropy. The probability of observing a macroscopic state (e.g., a particular distribution of energy among particles) that deviates significantly from the maximum-entropy state is exponentially small for a large number of particles. Therefore, finding the equilibrium state is equivalent to finding the state that maximizes entropy subject to physical constraints.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Maximization Problem:** For a gas of bosons (like photons), the entropy `S` is given by a specific combinatorial formula. We need to maximize this entropy `S` under the constraint of a fixed total energy `E`. For photons, the number of particles is not conserved, so there is no constraint on the total number `N` (which means the chemical potential is zero).\n\n4.  **Solve for the Equilibrium Distribution:** Solving this constrained maximization problem (e.g., using Lagrange multipliers) yields the equilibrium distribution of particles over energy levels. This is the well-known **Bose-Einstein distribution** for the average number of photons `<n(ε)>` in a state with energy `ε`:\n    `<n(ε)> = 1 / (exp(ε / (k_B * T)) - 1)`\n    Here, `T` is the temperature, and `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n\n5.  **Calculate Macroscopic Quantities:** To find the total mean energy `E` and total entropy `S`, we must sum (or integrate, for a continuous spectrum) the contributions from all possible energy states. This requires the **density of states** `g(ε)` for photons in a 3D volume `V`, which is `g(ε) = (8 * π * V / (h^3 * c^3)) * ε^2`.\n\n6.  **Derive the Mean Energy Equation:** The total energy `E` is found by integrating the energy per state `ε` times the number of photons per state `<n(ε)>` over the density of states `g(ε)`:\n    `E = ∫ ε * <n(ε)> * g(ε) dε`\n    Solving this integral leads to the Stefan-Boltzmann law for energy density `u = E/V`:\n    `u(T) = C_E * T^4`\n\n7.  **Derive the Entropy Equation:** The total entropy `S` can be found by integrating the entropy contribution from each state over the density of states. A simpler method is to use the thermodynamic relation `S = (E - F) / T`, where `F` is the Helmholtz free energy. For a photon gas, it can be shown that `F = -E/3`. This leads to `S = (E - (-E/3)) / T = 4E / (3T)`. Substituting the result for `E`, we get the entropy density `s = S/V`:\n    `s(T) = C_S * T^3`\n\n8.  **Final Code Plan:** The Python code will define the physical constants, calculate the numerical values of the coefficients `C_E` and `C_S` from their fundamental expressions, and print the final, explicit equations for `u(T)` and `s(T)`. This provides the \"equilibrium values\" as functions of temperature, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_equilibrium_values():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the equilibrium equations for mean energy and entropy\n    of a photon gas based on statistical mechanics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define physical constants in SI units\n    h = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant (J*s)\n    c = 299792458       # Speed of light (m/s)\n    k_B = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant (J/K)\n    PI = math.pi\n\n    # --- Mean Energy Calculation ---\n    # The mean energy density u = E/V is given by:\n    # u = (8 * pi^5 * k_B^4 / (15 * h^3 * c^3)) * T^4\n    energy_coefficient = (8 * PI**5 * k_B**4) / (15 * h**3 * c**3)\n\n    # --- Entropy Calculation ---\n    # The entropy density s = S/V is given by:\n    # s = (32 * pi^5 * k_B^4 / (45 * h^3 * c^3)) * T^3\n    # This can also be expressed as s = (4/3) * u / T\n    entropy_coefficient = (32 * PI**5 * k_B**4) / (45 * h**3 * c**3)\n\n    # --- Print the Results ---\n    print(\"The equilibrium values for a gas of light quanta (photons) are functions of temperature T.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*40)\n    print(\"EQUILIBRIUM MEAN ENERGY\")\n    print(\"=\"*40)\n    print(\"The mean energy density, u = E/V (Energy per unit volume), is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black-body radiation.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe general formula is:\")\n    print(\"  u(T) = C_E * T^4\")\n    print(\"\\nwhere the constant C_E is built from fundamental constants:\")\n    print(\"  C_E = (8 * π^5 * k_B^4) / (15 * h^3 * c^3)\")\n    print(f\"\\nCalculating the value of this constant:\")\n    print(f\"  π (pi)       = {PI}\")\n    print(f\"  k_B (J/K)    = {k_B}\")\n    print(f\"  h (J*s)      = {h}\")\n    print(f\"  c (m/s)      = {c}\")\n    print(f\"\\n  C_E ≈ {energy_coefficient:.6e} J/(m^3 * K^4)\")\n\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the final equation for equilibrium mean energy density is:\")\n    print(f\"  u(T) = {energy_coefficient:.6e} * T^4\")\n\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*40)\n    print(\"EQUILIBRIUM ENTROPY\")\n    print(\"=\"*40)\n    print(\"The entropy density, s = S/V (Entropy per unit volume), is derived from the energy.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe general formula is:\")\n    print(\"  s(T) = C_S * T^3\")\n    print(\"\\nwhere the constant C_S is also built from fundamental constants:\")\n    print(\"  C_S = (32 * π^5 * k_B^4) / (45 * h^3 * c^3)\")\n    print(f\"\\nCalculating the value of this constant:\")\n    print(f\"  C_S ≈ {entropy_coefficient:.6e} J/(m^3 * K^4)\")\n\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the final equation for equilibrium entropy density is:\")\n    print(f\"  s(T) = {entropy_coefficient:.6e} * T^3\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*40)\n    print(\"RELATIONSHIP\")\n    print(\"=\"*40)\n    print(\"Note that energy density and entropy density are related by: s = (4/3) * u / T\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_equilibrium_values()\n```\n<<<u(T) = 7.565733e-16 * T^4, s(T) = 1.008764e-15 * T^3>>>"
