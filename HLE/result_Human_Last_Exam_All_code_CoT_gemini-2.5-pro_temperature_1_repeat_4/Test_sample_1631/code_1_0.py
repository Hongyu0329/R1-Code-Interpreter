# The scientific basis for adding bypass notches in sheet metal stamping dies
# is to manage the movement of material during the forming process.

# The primary function of these features is to control the rate and amount of
# sheet metal flowing from the blank holder area into the die cavity.
# This control is crucial for forming parts with complex shapes, such as those
# with sharp corners or deep sections, without causing defects.

# - Too much material flow results in wrinkles.
# - Too little material flow results in excessive thinning and tearing.

# "Bypass notches" (either positive cutouts or negative restrictors) are
# engineered features that help guide and meter the material inflow.
# Therefore, the most accurate answer is the one that describes this function.
