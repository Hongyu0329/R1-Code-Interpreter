    "This chess puzzle requires finding the shortest forced checkmate for White, assuming Black plays optimally to defend and prolong the game as much as possible.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the initial position** from the FEN string: `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20`. I'll identify the key threats and tactical possibilities for both sides.\n2.  **Identify White's winning move**: I will look for forcing moves like checks and captures that lead to a decisive advantage. The move `Qxf7+` seems most promising.\n3.  **Explore Black's defenses**: After White's initial move, I'll analyze all of Black's possible responses.\n4.  **Trace the mating sequence**: I will follow the line of play after White's best move. A critical juncture appears on White's second move, where Black has a choice between two responses. One leads to a mate in 5, and the other to a mate in 6.\n5.  **Determine the optimal line**: Since Black is assumed to play optimally, they will choose the defensive line that leads to the longest game. Therefore, the mate in 6 is the correct line to consider.\n6.  **Formulate the Python code**: I will write a Python script that explains the analysis, details the main mating line, and prints the final count of moves. To satisfy the prompt's requirement for an \"equation\", I'll represent the sum of White's moves in the final line of the output.\n\nThe key finding is that White can force mate, but Black's best defense extends the game to 6 moves for White.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a chess position to find the number of moves for White to win.\n\n    The FEN for the position is:\n    4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20\n\n    The solution involves finding the forced checkmate sequence for White, assuming\n    Black plays optimally to defend.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: White's best move is Qxf7+.
