# Parameters given in the problem
m = 4  # number of items
t = 20 # threshold for condition 1

# According to the analysis, the smallest integer u such that for all choices of agents 
# and their preferences, there exists some O that is suitable is given by the formula u = (m-1)*t.
# This is derived from a constructive proof that finds a suitable set O.
# The proof involves an iterative removal process:
# 1. Start with S = {1, ..., m}.
# 2. While there is an item j in S where count(j, S) <= t, remove j from S.
# 3. The final set O satisfies condition (1) by construction.
# 4. It can be shown that for any item k not in O, the number of agents who prefer k
#    over all items in O is at most (m-1)*t.
# 5. Therefore, setting u = (m-1)*t ensures condition (2) is also met.
# A corresponding "worst-case" preference profile can be constructed to show that any
# u smaller than (m-1)*t is not sufficient.

# Calculate the value of u
u = (m - 1) * t

# Print the final equation with all the numbers
print(f"The smallest value for u is calculated as:")
print(f"u = (m - 1) * t")
print(f"u = ({m} - 1) * {t}")
print(f"u = {m-1} * {t}")
print(f"u = {u}")
