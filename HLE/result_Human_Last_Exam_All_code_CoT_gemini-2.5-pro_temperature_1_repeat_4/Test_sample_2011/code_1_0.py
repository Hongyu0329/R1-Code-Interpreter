    # Step 1: Let G be any graph with n vertices. Let S be the set of integers k
    # such that G has an induced subgraph isomorphic to a clique of size k (K_k).
    # We want to find the maximum possible value of |S|.

    # Step 2: Let k_max be the size of the largest induced clique in G.
    # By definition, there is a set of k_max vertices in G that are all
    # mutually connected. Let's call this set of vertices V_max.

    # Step 3: Any subset of V_max will also have all its vertices mutually
    # connected. Therefore, for any integer j between 1 and k_max, we can
    # select a subset of j vertices from V_max, and it will form an
    # induced clique of size j.

    # Step 4: This means that if k_max is in S, then {1, 2, ..., k_max} is a
    # subset of S. Since k_max is the maximum size, the set of all possible
    # induced clique sizes is exactly S = {1, 2, ..., k_max}.
    # The number of different clique sizes is |S| = k_max.

    # Step 5: The problem is now to maximize k_max. The size of any clique in a
    # graph with n vertices cannot exceed n. So, the governing equation is:
    # k_max <= n
    k_max_upper_bound = n

    # Step 6: This maximum value is achievable. The complete graph on n vertices,
    # K_n, contains an induced clique of size n (the graph itself).
    # For this graph, k_max = n.
    achievable_max_k_max = n

    # Conclusion: The maximum possible number of different clique sizes is n.
