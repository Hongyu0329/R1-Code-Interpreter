    "Answering this question requires understanding the definitions of a graph, an induced subgraph, and a clique. The solution is derived through logical deduction rather than complex computation.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Goal:** The objective is to find the maximum number of distinct clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs in any graph with `n = 128` vertices.\n2.  **Analyze the Set of Clique Sizes:** Let `S` be the set of possible induced clique sizes for a given graph `G`. We will show that if a graph `G` contains an induced clique of size `k`, it must also contain an induced clique of every size `j` where `1 <= j < k`. This means the set `S` must be a continuous sequence of integers starting from 1, i.e., `S = {1, 2, ..., k_max}`, where `k_max` is the size of the largest induced clique in `G`.\n3.  **Relate to the Problem:** Based on the above, the number of different clique sizes is `|S| = k_max`. Therefore, maximizing the number of clique sizes is equivalent to maximizing the size of the largest induced clique (`k_max`).\n4.  **Find the Maximum `k_max`:** For a graph with `n` vertices, the largest possible clique size is `n`. This is achieved with the complete graph `K_n`.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** Write a Python script that formalizes this logic, sets `n = 128`, and prints the final result based on the deduction. The code will include comments that explain the reasoning, as per the plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_clique_sizes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can\n    simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on n vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph.\n    n = 128\n\n    # Step 1: Let G be any graph with n vertices. Let S be the set of integers k\n    # such that G has an induced subgraph isomorphic to a clique of size k (K_k).\n    # We want to find the maximum possible value of |S|.\n\n    # Step 2: Let k_max be the size of the largest induced clique in G.\n    # By definition, there is a set of k_max vertices in G that are all\n    # mutually connected. Let's call this set of vertices V_max.\n\n    # Step 3: Any subset of V_max will also have all its vertices mutually\n    # connected. Therefore, for any integer j between 1 and k_max, we can\n    # select a subset of j vertices from V_max, and it will form an\n    # induced clique of size j.\n\n    # Step 4: This means that if k_max is in S, then {1, 2, ..., k_max} is a\n    # subset of S. Since k_max is the maximum size, the set of all possible\n    # induced clique sizes is exactly S = {1, 2, ..., k_max}.\n    # The number of different clique sizes is |S| = k_max.\n\n    # Step 5: The problem is now to maximize k_max. The size of any clique in a\n    # graph with n vertices cannot exceed n. So, the governing equation is:\n    # k_max <= n\n    k_max_upper_bound = n\n\n    # Step 6: This maximum value is achievable. The complete graph on n vertices,\n    # K_n, contains an induced clique of size n (the graph itself).\n    # For this graph, k_max = n.\n    achievable_max_k_max = n\n\n    # Conclusion: The maximum possible number of different clique sizes is n.\n    max_sizes = achievable_max_k_max\n\n    print(f\"The number of vertices is n = {n}.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum size of an induced clique (k_max) in a graph with n vertices must satisfy the equation: k_max <= {n}.\")\n    print(f\"A complete graph K_{n} achieves this maximum, with k_max = {n}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of different induced clique sizes is equal to this k_max.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is {max_sizes}.\")\n\nsolve_clique_sizes()\n<<<128>>>\n```"
