    "My plan is to determine the standard Japanese pitch accent for the word 「弟」 (otouto) and classify it according to the given choices.\n\n1.  **Identify the word and its pronunciation:** The word is 「弟」, pronounced 「おとうと」 (o-to-u-to).\n2.  **Break it down into morae:** The pronunciation consists of four morae: お (o), と (to), う (u), と (to).\n3.  **Determine the standard pitch accent:** The standard Tokyo accent for 「おとうと」 is Low-High-High-Low.\n    *   お (Low)\n    *   と (High)\n    *   う (High)\n    *   と (Low)\n    The pitch rises after the first mora and falls after the third mora.\n4.  **Classify the pattern:**\n    *   **Heiban (平板):** The pitch starts low, rises, and then stays high without a drop. This doesn't match.\n    *   **Atamadaka (頭高):** The pitch is high only on the first mora and then drops. This doesn't match.\n    *   **Nakadaka (中高):** The pitch rises after the first mora and drops somewhere *in the middle* of the word (i.e., not after the last mora). The pattern for 「おとうと」 (L-H-H-L) has a drop within the word, so it fits this classification.\n    *   **Odaka (尾高):** The pitch rises and stays high until the very end of the word, only dropping on a following particle. This doesn't match, as the drop occurs on the last mora of the word itself.\n\nBased on this analysis, the pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 is Nakadaka. I will write a Python script to demonstrate this.\n\n```python\ndef get_pitch_accent_info(word, hiragana, morae, accent_pattern_numerical):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and prints the pitch accent pattern and its classification.\n    accent_pattern_numerical: 0 for Heiban, 1 for Atamadaka, >1 for Nakadaka/Odaka\n                              based on where the drop occurs.
