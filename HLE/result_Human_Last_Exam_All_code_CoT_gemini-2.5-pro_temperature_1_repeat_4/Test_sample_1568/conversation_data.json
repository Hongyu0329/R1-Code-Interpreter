    "This problem asks for the closed-form expression of the infinite product $\\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$. I will solve this by relating the product to the Weierstrass product representation of the Gamma function.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Relate the Product:** Express the product starting from $n=3$ in terms of the more standard product starting from $n=1$. This is done by dividing the product from $n=1$ by the first two terms (for $n=1$ and $n=2$):\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n\n2.  **Factor the General Term:** The term inside the product can be factored using the cube roots of unity: $1, \\omega, \\omega^2$, where $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$.\n    $$ 1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Use the Gamma Function Product Formula:** The infinite product $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1-\\frac{x}{n}\\right)$ on its own diverges. However, the regularized product, known as the Weierstrass product for the Gamma function, converges:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-x)} = e^{\\gamma x} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1-\\frac{x}{n}\\right)e^{x/n} $$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Product from n=1:** By splitting our product into three parts based on the factorization and introducing the necessary convergence factors, we get:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\left[\\prod (1-\\frac{z}{n})e^{z/n}\\right] \\left[\\prod (1-\\frac{\\omega z}{n})e^{\\omega z/n}\\right] \\left[\\prod (1-\\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n})e^{\\omega^2 z/n}\\right] $$\n    The exponential terms cancel out because $1+\\omega+\\omega^2=0$. Using the Gamma function product formula for each part, this simplifies to:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\n\n5.  **Assemble the Final Expression:** Substitute the result from step 4 back into the expression from step 1. The terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$ are $(1-z^3)$ and $(1-z^3/8)$, respectively.\n\n6.  **Python Code:** Create a Python script that prints this final mathematical expression in a clear, human-readable format, ensuring all numerical constants are explicitly shown in the final output.\n\n```python\ndef display_infinite_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function generates and displays the closed-form expression for the infinite product:\n    Π_{n=3 to ∞} (1 - z³/n³)\n    \"\"\"\n    # The derivation relies on the Weierstrass product for the Gamma function, which gives:\n    # Π_{n=1 to ∞} (1 - z³/n³) = 1 / [Γ(1-z)Γ(1-ωz)Γ(1-ω²z)]\n    # where ω = exp(2πi/3) is a primitive cube root of unity.\n\n    # The product starting from n=3 is obtained by dividing the product from n=1\n    # by the terms for n=1 and n=2.\n    # Term n=1: (1 - z³/1³) = 1 - z³\n    # Term n=2: (1 - z³/2³) = 1 - z³/8\n\n    # Combining these gives the final expression.\n\n    # Using unicode for mathematical symbols for better readability\n    # Π = \\u03a0, ∞ = \\u221e, Γ = \\u0393, ω = \\u03c9, ² = \\u00b2, ³ = \\u00b3\n    \n    product_str = \"\\u03a0_{n=3}^\\u221e (1 - z\\u00b3/n\\u00b3)\"\n    \n    numerator = \"1\"\n    \n    # The denominator shows all the numbers from the formula, including 3 (power),\n    # 8 (from 2^3), and implies the starting n=3 by the context.\n    denominator = \"(1 - z\\u00b3) * (1 - z\\u00b3/8) * \\u0393(1-z)\\u0393(1-\\u03c9z)\\u0393(1-\\u03c9\\u00b2z)\"\n    \n    print(f\"The closed-form expression for {product_str} is:\")\n    print()\n    \n    # Pretty print the fraction\n    max_len = len(denominator)\n    print(f\" {numerator.center(max_len)} \")\n    print(f\" {'-' * (max_len + 2)} \")\n    print(f\" {denominator} \")\n    print()\n    print(\"where:\")\n    print(\"  \\u0393(x) is the Gamma function.\")\n    print(\"  \\u03c9 = exp(2\\u03c0i/3) is a primitive cube root of unity.\")\n\ndisplay_infinite_product_formula()\n```\n<<<$ \\frac{1}{(1-z^3)(1 - \\frac{z^3}{8}) \\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-e^{2\\pi i/3} z)\\Gamma(1-e^{4\\pi i/3} z)} $>>>"
