    "To solve this problem, I will perform a brute-force search through all 256 possible rules of an elementary cellular automaton. The goal is to find the single rule that transforms the initial state to the final state in exactly two steps.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Define States:** Represent the initial state `01101001` and the final state `10000111` as lists of integers.\n2.  **Iterate Through Rules:** I will loop through every rule number from 0 to 255.\n3.  **Simulate automaton step:** For each rule, I will create a function that takes a state (a list of 0s and 1s) and the rule, and returns the next state. This function will assume periodic boundary conditions, meaning the grid wraps around (the left neighbor of the first cell is the last cell, and the right neighbor of the last cell is the first cell).\n4.  **Two-Step Simulation:**\n    a. Apply the current rule to the initial state to generate a potential intermediate state.\n    b. Apply the same rule to this intermediate state to generate a calculated final state.\n5.  **Validation:** I will compare the calculated final state with the given final state `10000111`.\n6.  **Find the Unique Solution:** If the states match, the corresponding intermediate state is a valid solution. Since the problem states there is only one valid solution, I will store this intermediate state and stop the search.\n7.  **Output:** Finally, I will print the unique intermediate state that was found.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cellular_automaton():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intermediate step in a 2-step elementary cellular automaton evolution.\n    \"\"\"\n    initial_state_str = \"01101001\"\n    final_state_str = \"10000111\"\n\n    initial_state = [int(c) for c in initial_state_str]\n    final_state = [int(c) for c in final_state_str]\n    n = len(initial_state)\n\n    def apply_rule(state, rule_map):\n        \"\"\"\n        Applies a given rule to a state to get the next state, assuming periodic boundaries.\n        \"\"\"\n        next_state = [0] * n\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Get neighbors with periodic (wrapping) boundary conditions\n            left = state[(i - 1 + n) % n]\n            center = state[i]\n            right = state[(i + 1) % n]\n            \n            # The 8 neighborhoods from '111' to '000' correspond to indices 0 to 7 in the rule map.\n            # Convert the binary neighborhood triplet to an integer value.\n            neighborhood_val = left * 4 + center * 2 + right * 1\n            \n            # The index in the rule map is 7 minus this value.\n            rule_index = 7 - neighborhood_val\n            \n            next_state[i] = rule_map[rule_index]\n        return next_state\n\n    # Iterate through all 256 possible elementary rules\n    for rule_number in range(256):\n        # The rule map is the 8-bit binary representation of the rule number\n        rule_map = [int(bit) for bit in format(rule_number, '08b')]\n        \n        # First step: from initial to intermediate\n        intermediate_state = apply_rule(initial_state, rule_map)\n        \n        # Second step: from intermediate to a calculated final\n        calculated_final_state = apply_rule(intermediate_state, rule_map)\n        \n        # Check if the calculated final state matches the given final state\n        if calculated_final_state == final_state:\n            # Found the solution.
