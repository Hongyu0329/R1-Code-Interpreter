    "To determine the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes, we need to find the number of logical qubits `k` the code can store. The GSD is then given by `2^k`.\n\n### Step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **GSD Formula:** The ground state degeneracy of a topological code is determined by the number of independent logical operators that commute with the Hamiltonian. For Abelian topological phases like the toric code, this is `D^k`, where `D` is the total quantum dimension of the anyon types and `k` is the number of logical qubits. For the toric code, the anyons are `{1, e, m, Îµ}` and the total quantum dimension is `D=2`. Thus, `GSD = 2^k`.\n\n2.  **Logical Qubits and Topology:** The number of logical qubits `k` is determined by the topology of the surface on which the code is defined. The standard formula for a surface with genus `g` and `b` boundaries (holes) is:\n    *   `k = 2g` if `b = 0` (a closed surface like a sphere or torus).\n    *   `k = 2g + b - 1` if `b > 0` (a surface with boundaries).\n\n3.  **Interpreting the Problem:** The problem statement does not specify the underlying surface (e.g., a sphere or a torus). However, a very common and practical implementation of the toric code is on a 2D plane, which is often called the \"planar code\".\n    *   Topologically, an infinite 2D plane is equivalent to a sphere with one puncture (the point at infinity).\n    *   The problem states there are `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes *on this surface*. These correspond to an additional `n+m` punctures or boundaries.\n\n4.  **Calculating `k`:**\n    *   Let's assume the model is on a 2D plane.\n    *   The base surface is a sphere (`g=0`) with one initial puncture (the boundary \"at infinity\").\n    *   We then introduce `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes.\n    *   The total number of boundaries/holes is `b = n + m + 1`.\n    *   Since `b > 0`, we use the formula `k = 2g + b - 1`.\n    *   Substituting `g=0` and `b = n+m+1`:\n        `k = 2(0) + (n + m + 1) - 1`\n        `k = n + m`\n\n5.  **Final GSD Calculation:** With `k = n + m` logical qubits, the ground space degeneracy is:\n    `GSD = 2^k = 2^(n+m)`\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\nTo illustrate this, the following Python code calculates the GSD for example values of `n` and `m` based on this derived formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_toric_code_gsd(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code on a \n    2D plane with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of smooth holes.\n        m (int): The number of rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Explain the physical model.\n    # The problem describes a toric code with n smooth and m rough holes.\n    # A common and practical model for this is the \"planar code\", which resides on a 2D plane.\n    # Topologically, a 2D plane is a sphere (genus g=0) with one hole (the boundary at infinity).\n    # The n smooth and m rough holes are additional boundaries on this surface.\n    print(f\"Model: Toric code on a 2D plane with {n} smooth and {m} rough holes.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to a topological surface with genus g=0.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the total number of boundaries (b).\n    # Total boundaries = n (smooth) + m (rough) + 1 (at infinity).\n    b = n + m + 1\n    print(f\"The total number of boundaries is b = n + m + 1 = {n} + {m} + 1 = {b}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the number of logical qubits (k).\n    # The formula for the number of logical qubits is k = 2*g + b - 1 (for b > 0).\n    g = 0\n    k = 2 * g + b - 1\n    print(f\"The number of logical qubits is k = 2*g + b - 1 = 2*({g}) + {b} - 1 = {k}.\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate the Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD).\n    # GSD = 2^k\n    gsd = int(math.pow(2, k))\n    \n    # Step 5: Output the final equation and result, showing each number.\n    # The derived formula is GSD = 2^(n+m).\n    print(\"\\nThe final formula for the Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD) is 2^(n+m).\")\n    print(\"For the given values:\")\n    print(f\"GSD = 2^({n} + {m}) = 2^{k} = {gsd}\")\n\n# Example values for the number of holes\nn_example = 3  # Example number of smooth holes\nm_example = 2  # Example number of rough holes\n\ncalculate_toric_code_gsd(n_example, m_example)\n```\n<<<A>>>"
