    "To determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed to identify any PLL case, we need to find the most \"similar\" pair of cases and see how much information is required to distinguish them. The goal is to find the smallest number of stickers, `N`, such that no two different PLL cases have the same colors on a specific set of `N` sticker positions.\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Pieces:** The last layer consists of 4 corner pieces and 4 edge pieces. Excluding the top face, this leaves 4 edges * 1 sticker/edge + 4 corners * 2 stickers/corner = 12 side-facing stickers.\n2.  **Identify Similar Cases:** The most difficult cases to distinguish are often those that are mirrors or simple variations of each other. The G-perms are a classic example. Let's compare the **Gb** and **Gd** permutations.\n3.  **Orient for Comparison:** Both Gb and Gd perms can be oriented so that they display \"headlights\" on one face. Headlights are when the two corner pieces on a face show the same color. Let's orient the cube so the headlights are on the back face.\n4.  **Analyze with 3 Stickers:** Now, let's observe the three non-top-facing stickers on the *front* face (the one opposite the headlights).\n    *   For the **Gb** perm (with headlights on the back), the front face stickers will show a specific pattern (e.g., Green-Blue-Green on a standard cube).\n    *   For the **Gd** perm (with headlights on the back), the front face stickers will show the *exact same* pattern (e.g., Green-Blue-Green).\n5.  **Conclusion for 3 Stickers:** Since there exists a situation where looking at 3 stickers results in an ambiguous case, 3 is not a sufficient number of stickers to guarantee identification of every PLL.\n6.  **Analyze with 4 Stickers:** We must look at a fourth sticker to resolve the ambiguity. Let's inspect the edge sticker on the right face.\n    *   In the **Gb** case, this sticker will have one color (e.g., Red).\n    *   In the **Gd** case, this sticker will have a different color (e.g., Green).\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** This fourth sticker breaks the tie. Since 3 stickers are proven to be insufficient, and 4 stickers are sufficient to distinguish even these very similar cases, the minimum number required is 4.\n\nThe following Python code will print this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pll_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the logic for determining the minimum number of stickers\n    to see to identify a PLL case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = \"\"\"To solve this, we need to find the minimum number of side-stickers on the last layer that must be seen to uniquely distinguish between all 21 PLL cases.\n\nThe key is to find the most similar-looking cases and determine how many stickers it takes to tell them apart. A well-known difficult pair is the Gb and Gd permutations.\n\n1. Both Gb and Gd perms can be oriented to show 'headlights' (two corner stickers of the same color) on one face. Let's place these headlights on the back face.\n\n2. If you then look at the three stickers on the front face (the two corners and one edge), you will find that the pattern of colors is IDENTICAL for both Gb and Gd perms.\n\n3. This proves that seeing only 3 stickers is not enough, because it can lead to an ambiguous situation.\n\n4. To resolve the ambiguity, you must look at a 4th sticker. For example, looking at the edge sticker on the right face will reveal a different color for Gb than for Gd. This 4th piece of information is enough to distinguish them.\n\nSince 3 stickers are insufficient but 4 are sufficient for even the most difficult cases, the minimum number required is 4.\"\"\"\n\n    print(explanation)\n    print(\"\\nThus, the number of stickers that must be seen is:\")\n    print(4)\n\nsolve_pll_puzzle()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
