    Explains the logic for determining the minimum number of stickers

    explanation = """To solve this, we need to find the minimum number of side-stickers on the last layer that must be seen to uniquely distinguish between all 21 PLL cases.

The key is to find the most similar-looking cases and determine how many stickers it takes to tell them apart. A well-known difficult pair is the Gb and Gd permutations.

1. Both Gb and Gd perms can be oriented to show 'headlights' (two corner stickers of the same color) on one face. Let's place these headlights on the back face.

2. If you then look at the three stickers on the front face (the two corners and one edge), you will find that the pattern of colors is IDENTICAL for both Gb and Gd perms.

3. This proves that seeing only 3 stickers is not enough, because it can lead to an ambiguous situation.

4. To resolve the ambiguity, you must look at a 4th sticker. For example, looking at the edge sticker on the right face will reveal a different color for Gb than for Gd. This 4th piece of information is enough to distinguish them.

Since 3 stickers are insufficient but 4 are sufficient for even the most difficult cases, the minimum number required is 4."""
