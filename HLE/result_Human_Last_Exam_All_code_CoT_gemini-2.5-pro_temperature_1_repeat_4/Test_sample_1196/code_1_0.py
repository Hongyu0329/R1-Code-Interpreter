# The user wants to identify the most likely scenario for a misleading GWAS association due to Linkage Disequilibrium (LD).
# This is a conceptual question about genetics, not a coding problem.
# The code will simply print the rationale and the final correct answer.

# Step 1: Analyze the core of the question.
# The question is about identifying a situation where an apparent association between a SNP and a trait is not causal,
# but rather due to the SNP being inherited together with the true causal variant (i.e., they are in LD).
# The trait is complex and polygenic, with causal loci scattered across the genome.

# Step 2: Evaluate each answer choice based on principles of population genetics.
# A. Three SNPs tightly linked within a single LD block on one chromosome.
# Rationale: This is a classic GWAS scenario. If one true causal SNP exists in this block, all other SNPs in high LD with it
# will also show a strong statistical association. This creates a strong signal for the region, but the individual
# association for any single one of those three SNPs is likely to be misleading because it's just a proxy for the real signal.
# This is a very strong candidate.

# B. Two SNPs located at the extreme ends of an LD block.
# Rationale: LD is weaker at the ends of a block. While still possible, it's a less potent example of confounding by LD compared to A.

# C. Two SNPs located on different chromosomes but within regions of high recombination.
# Rationale: SNPs on different chromosomes are unlinked and assort independently. They are not in LD.
# Therefore, this scenario cannot produce a misleading association *due to LD*. It would represent two independent signals. This is the least likely option.

# D. A single SNP located centrally within an LD block but next to a recombination hotspot.
# Rationale: A recombination hotspot defines the edge of an LD block. A central SNP is still in high LD with its neighbors.
# This is a plausible scenario for a misleading association, but option A (with three SNPs) illustrates the confounding problem more strongly.

# E. Three Tag SNPs predicting all alleles in an inherited haplotype.
# Rationale: This describes the technical method used in GWAS. Using tag SNPs is *how* we find associated regions. If the haplotype they "tag"
# contains a causal variant, the tag SNPs will light up. This is the mechanism that leads to the situation in A.
# Option A describes the resulting observation that is most likely to be misleading.

# Step 3: Conclude which option is the best fit.
# Option A best illustrates the problem. A cluster of significant SNPs in a high-LD region creates a powerful but ambiguous signal peak.
# It is very difficult to fine-map the causal variant, and the association for any one of the observed SNPs is likely just a reflection
# of the true cause elsewhere in the block, making it misleading.

print("Rationale: In a GWAS, a misleading association due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) occurs when a genotyped SNP shows a statistical signal because it is inherited along with a nearby, true causal variant, not because it is functional itself. The strongest and most classic example of this is when an entire LD block is associated with the trait.")
print("Choice A describes finding three tightly linked SNPs within one LD block that are all associated with the trait. This creates a strong, but highly ambiguous, signal. The tight linkage makes it extremely difficult to determine which of the SNPs (if any) is the true causal one. The association for any single SNP in this cluster is therefore very likely to be a misleading proxy for the true causal variant located somewhere within that same block.")
print("Choices B, D, and E also relate to LD but are less representative of the peak problem. Choice C is incorrect because SNPs on different chromosomes are not in LD.")
