    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Model the Graph:** I will first model the specified barbell graph. A barbell graph with 10 nodes is typically constructed by taking two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each (K5) and connecting them with a single edge, known as the \"bottleneck\" or \"bridge\".\n2.  **Define the Gossiping Process:** I will analyze the randomized uniform gossiping process. In this process, at each step, a node is selected uniformly at random from all `n` nodes (with probability `1/n`). This selected node then chooses one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random, to communicate with.\n3.  **Calculate Node Degrees:** The probability of communication depends on the degrees of the nodes. I will calculate the degrees of the two specific nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n    *   A node within a K5 clique is connected to 4 other nodes.\n    *   The two nodes that form the bridge are connected to the 4 nodes in their own clique plus the 1 node in the other clique via the bridge.\n4.  **Derive the Probability Formula:** The probability of sampling a specific edge `(u, v)` is the sum of the probabilities of two mutually exclusive events:\n    *   Node `u` is chosen and it contacts `v`.\n    *   Node `v` is chosen and it contacts `u`.\n    The formula is: `P(sample edge u,v) = (1/n) * (1/degree(u)) + (1/n) * (1/degree(v))`.\n5.  **Compute the Final Value:** I will plug the values for the total nodes (`n=10`) and the degrees of the bottleneck nodes into the formula to calculate the final probability.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that performs this calculation and prints the full equation and the final result as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters of the barbell graph\ntotal_nodes = 10\n# A standard 10-node barbell graph consists of two cliques of 5 nodes each.\nclique_size = 5\n\n# Calculate the degree of the nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n# Each of these two nodes is connected to (clique_size - 1) nodes in its own clique,\n# plus 1 node in the other clique via the bridge.\ndeg_bottleneck_node = (clique_size - 1) + 1\n\n# The bottleneck edge connects two such nodes. Let's call them u and v.\ndeg_u = deg_bottleneck_node\ndeg_v = deg_bottleneck_node\n\n# The probability of sampling an edge (u, v) in a single step of uniform gossiping is:\n# P = P(u is chosen) * P(u contacts v) + P(v is chosen) * P(v contacts u)\n# P = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / deg(u)) + (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / deg(v))\nprob = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / deg_u) + (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / deg_v)\n\n# Print the result showing the full equation\nprint(f\"A 10-node barbell graph has two K{clique_size} cliques.\")\nprint(f\"The degree of each node on the bottleneck edge is {deg_bottleneck_node}.\")\nprint(\"The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"P = (1/{total_nodes}) * (1/{deg_u} + 1/{deg_v})\")\nprint(f\"P = {prob}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.04>>>"
