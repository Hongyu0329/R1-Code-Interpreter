    print("\nD. Small Claims Court: This court's monetary jurisdiction is limited to $35,000. The value of this dispute is in the millions, so this option is incorrect.")

    print("\nE. Federal Court of Canada: This court's jurisdiction is limited to specific federal matters (e.g., intellectual property, maritime law). This dispute falls under provincial law (contracts, property), so this option is incorrect.")
