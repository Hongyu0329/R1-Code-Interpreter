    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\nAugustine developed a sophisticated philosophical and theological framework to explain how events that appear to be contrary to nature, such as miracles, could occur without God violating the natural order that He himself created. The specialized terminology he used for this concept is ***rationes seminales***, which translates to \"seminal reasons\" or \"seedlike principles\".\n\nHere is how his terminology applies to both scenarios mentioned in the question:\n\n*   **Miracles and the Virgin Birth:** Augustine argued that God embedded these *rationes seminales* into creation from the very beginning. These \"reasons\" or \"principles\" contain the latent potentialities for everything that would ever come into being. The normal, observable course of nature is the slow and regular unfolding of these potentialities, like a seed growing into a tree. A miracle, therefore, is not an event that is *contra naturam* (against nature), but rather *supra naturam* (above nature) or, more precisely, *contra quam est nota natura* (contrary to nature *as we know it*). In the case of a miracle like the virgin birth, God directly and instantaneously activates a pre-ordained potentiality that was hidden within the \"seminal reasons\" of creation, bypassing the usual processes of biological generation.\n\n*   **The Fall:** Augustine's framework is also applicable to understanding changes in the natural world as a result of the Fall. His theory suggested that God, in His providence, could have embedded potentialities within the *rationes seminales* that would only become active after the Fall and the subsequent curse on creation. Thus, the appearance of thorns and thistles or other changes to the natural order would not be a chaotic disruption but the unfolding of a different set of potentials that God had planned for in response to human sin.\n\nBy developing the doctrine of *rationes seminales*, Augustine created a unique theological vocabulary that allowed for a dynamic understanding of natural law, capable of accounting for both the regularity of nature and the exceptional, supernatural acts of God like the virgin birth, as well as the lasting consequences of the Fall on the created order.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
