    "In the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, which expresses the solution Z for an equation of the form  $e^X e^Y = e^Z$ in terms of a series of nested commutators of X and Y, the number of non-zero coefficients at each order is a topic of mathematical interest.\n\nFor order 10, there are 55 non-zero coefficients. This value is found in a known sequence that counts the number of Lyndon words with non-zero coefficients in the BCH series.\n\nThe number of terms in the BCH expansion is notoriously difficult to calculate and grows rapidly with the order. For lower orders, the number of non-trivial commutators and non-vanishing coefficients has been determined, and the sequence of these numbers provides insight into the structure of the formula. The coefficients are rational numbers and can be expressed in various bases, such as the Lyndon basis, which is commonly used for these calculations.\n\nA sequence tracking the number of these non-zero coefficients for each order has been recorded in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). For order 10, the value is consistently reported as 55.\n\n<<<55>>>"
