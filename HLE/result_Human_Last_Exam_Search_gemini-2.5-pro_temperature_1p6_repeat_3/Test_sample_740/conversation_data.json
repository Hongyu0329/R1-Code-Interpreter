    "To determine the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions, we first analyze the equation:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.\n\nThe kernel of the integral, K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y), can be expressed as a finite geometric series:\nK(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + xⁿ⁻³y² + ... + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k\n\nThis shows that the kernel is separable. The integral equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. We can write it as:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy\n\nLet's define the constants `c_k` as:\nc_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy, for k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for u(x), we find that the solution must be a polynomial in x of degree at most n-1:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k x^(n-1-k)\n\nNow, we can establish a system of linear equations for the unknown constants `c_j`. We substitute the expression for u(y) back into the definition of `c_j`:\nc_j = ∫₀¹ y^j [1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k y^(n-1-k)] dy\nc_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k ∫₀¹ y^(j+n-1-k) dy\nc_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k / (j+n-k)\n\nThis can be written as a system of n linear equations for c₀, ..., c_(n-1):\nc_j - λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) [1 / (n+j-k)] c_k = 1/(j+1)\n\nIn matrix form, this system is (I - λA)C = B, where:\n*   C is the column vector of the unknowns [c₀, c₁, ..., c_(n-1)]ᵀ.\n*   B is the column vector of constants [1, 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/n]ᵀ.\n*   A is an n x n matrix with entries A_jk = 1 / (n+j-k), for j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n*   I is the n x n identity matrix.\n\nThis system of linear equations has a unique solution for C if the determinant of the coefficient matrix, det(I - λA), is non-zero. If det(I - λA) = 0, the system will have either no solutions or infinitely many solutions.\n\nThe condition det(I - λA) = 0 means that 1/λ is an eigenvalue of the matrix A. Let μ be an eigenvalue of A. Then the critical values of λ are λ = 1/μ.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm Alternative Theorem, if λ is a characteristic value (i.e., λ=1/μ), the non-homogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the forcing term (in this case, f(x)=1) is orthogonal to all the eigenfunctions of the adjoint homogeneous equation. If this orthogonality condition is not met, there is no solution.\n\nFor this problem, it can be shown that the orthogonality condition is not satisfied for any characteristic value of λ. This means that for any λ that is the reciprocal of an eigenvalue of matrix A, the equation will have no solution.\n\nTherefore, the values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A, where the elements are given by A_jk = 1/(n+j-k).\n\nLet's illustrate for small n:\n*   **For n=1:** A is a 1x1 matrix: A = [1/1] =. The only eigenvalue is μ=1. Thus, λ = 1/μ = 1. For λ=1, the equation becomes 0=1, which has no solution.\n*   **For n=2:** The matrix A is A = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]. The characteristic equation for the eigenvalues μ of A is det(A - μI) = 0, which is (1/2-μ)² - 1/3 = 0, leading to μ² - μ - 1/12 = 0. The eigenvalues are μ = (3 ± 2√3)/6. The corresponding values for λ are λ = 1/μ = 6 / (3 ± 2√3) = -6 ± 4√3.\n\nFor a general n, the values of λ are the roots of the polynomial equation det(I - λA) = 0, which are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix A.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A whose elements are defined by A_jk = 1/(n+j-k) for j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.>>>"
