    "Trisyllabic laxing, also known as trisyllabic shortening, is a phonological rule in English where a tense vowel (a long vowel or a diphthong) becomes lax (a short vowel) when it is in the third-to-last syllable of a word or earlier. This typically occurs when a suffix is added to a root word. To determine which of the provided words has not undergone this process, each word's etymology and phonological development must be examined.\n\nThe following words from the list demonstrate clear examples of trisyllabic laxing:\n*   **derivative**: The tense diphthong /aɪ/ in the verb *derive* becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ in the four-syllable word *derivative*. This is a classic example of the rule.\n*   **serenity**: The tense vowel /iː/ in the adjective *serene* is laxed to /ɛ/ in the four-syllable word *serenity*.\n*   **gratitude**: The tense diphthong /eɪ/ in *grateful* becomes the lax vowel /æ/ in the three-syllable word *gratitude*.\n*   **southern**: This word underwent trisyllabic laxing in an earlier form of the language. The Old English word *sūþerne* was three syllables (/suːðernə/). The long vowel /uː/ in the root word *sūþ* (south) was shortened because it was followed by two syllables. This shortened vowel eventually became the modern /ʌ/ sound in *southern*.\n\nThe remaining two words, *pleasant* and *shadow*, have not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing because they are both two-syllable words. The phonological rule of trisyllabic laxing requires the affected vowel to be followed by at least two syllables.\n\n*   **shadow**: This word shows a different kind of vowel shortening. It is a textbook example of **disyllabic laxing**. The tense vowel /eɪ/ in the one-syllable word *shade* is laxed to /æ/ in the two-syllable word *shadow*. Both words originate from the same Old English root, *sceadu*.\n*   **pleasant**: The vowel in *pleasant* is also lax (/ɛ/), contrasting with the tense vowel /iː/ in the related word *please*. This vowel shortening is an instance of **pre-cluster shortening**, where a vowel becomes short when it comes before a consonant cluster (in this case, '-sant'). As *pleasant* is a bisyllabic word, trisyllabic laxing does not apply.\n\nBoth *pleasant* and *shadow* are correct answers as neither underwent *trisyllabic* laxing. However, the question asks for a single selection. Of the two, *shadow* is most frequently cited in linguistic texts as an example of a distinct laxing process (disyllabic laxing), which directly contrasts with trisyllabic laxing.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
