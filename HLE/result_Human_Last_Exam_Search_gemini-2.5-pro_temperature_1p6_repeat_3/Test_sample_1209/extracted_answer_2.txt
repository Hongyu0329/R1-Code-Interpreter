The horizontal distance $D$ is given by the expression:
$D = \frac{\gamma_0 v_0 c}{g} \text{arsinh}\left( \frac{1}{\gamma_0} \sqrt{\frac{2gh\gamma_0}{c^2} + \left(\frac{gh}{c^2}\right)^2} \right)$
where $\gamma_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_0^2/c^2}}$, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $c$ is the speed of light. The distance $D$ does not depend on the mass $m$.
