As the operator is applied iteratively ($t \rightarrow \infty$), the edges in the image will evolve to become smoother, driven by a process analogous to motion by mean curvature. Sharp corners will be rounded, and complex boundaries will simplify. The final, stable state is an image where all remaining edges are either straight lines or circular arcs.
