    "Answering this question requires delving into the concepts of connectivity in algebraic topology, particularly concerning loop spaces, smash products, and suspension.\n\n### 1. Defining Connectivity\n\nFirst, let's define the key terms:\n*   **Connectivity of a space:** A space `X` is *n-connected* if all its homotopy groups `π_i(X)` are trivial for `i ≤ n`. For instance, the n-sphere, S<sup>n</sup>, is (n-1)-connected.\n*   **Connectivity of a map:** A map `f: X → Y` is *n-connected* if it induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups `π_i` for `i < n` and a surjection on `π_n`. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of the map, `Ff`, being `(n-1)`-connected.\n\n### 2. The Spaces Involved\n\nThe map in question is `f: Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`. Let's analyze the connectivity of the source and target spaces:\n\n*   **Source Space: `Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)`**\n    *   `S⁴` is 3-connected, so its loop space `ΩS⁴` is 2-connected.\n    *   `S⁶` is 5-connected, so its loop space `ΩS⁶` is 4-connected.\n    *   The connectivity of a smash product `A ∧ B` is at least `conn(A) + conn(B) + 1`. Therefore, `ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶` is `2 + 4 + 1 = 7`-connected.\n    *   The suspension of a `k`-connected space is `(k+1)`-connected. Thus, the source space `Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)` is `7 + 1 = 8`-connected.\n\n*   **Target Space: `Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`**\n    *   The smash product `S⁴ ∧ S⁶` is homotopy equivalent to `S¹⁰`.\n    *   `S¹⁰` is 9-connected.\n    *   The loop space of a `k`-connected space is `(k-1)`-connected. Therefore, the target space `ΩS¹⁰` is `9 - 1 = 8`-connected.\n\nBoth the source and target spaces are 8-connected. This means that for any `i ≤ 8`, the homotopy groups `π_i` of both spaces are trivial. Consequently, the map `f` induces an isomorphism `0 → 0` for `i ≤ 8`. According to the definition of map connectivity, this implies the map is at least 9-connected. To determine the exact connectivity, we must analyze the map on `π₉`.\n\n### 3. The Adjoint Map and Its Connectivity\n\nThe analysis is simplified by considering the adjoint map. The suspension functor `Σ` is left adjoint to the loop space functor `Ω`. This gives a natural isomorphism:\n`Maps_*(ΣA, B) ≅ Maps_*(A, ΩB)`.\n\nThe map `f: Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)` has an adjoint map:\n`f̃: ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶ → Ω(Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)) = Ω²S¹⁰`\n\nA crucial fact is that a map and its adjoint have the same homotopy fiber, and therefore the same connectivity. So, the connectivity of `f` is the same as the connectivity of `f̃`.\n\n*   **Source of `f̃`**: `ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶` is 7-connected.\n*   **Target of `f̃`**: `Ω²S¹⁰` is `(conn(S¹⁰) - 2) = 9 - 2 = 7`-connected.\n\nSince both the source and target of `f̃` are 7-connected, `π_i(f̃)` is an isomorphism for `i ≤ 7`. We need to examine `π₈(f̃)`.\n\n`π₈(f̃): π₈(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → π₈(Ω²S¹⁰)`\n\nBy the Hurewicz theorem and the Künneth formula for homology, we can determine these homotopy groups:\n*   `π₈(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) ≅ H₈(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) ≅ H₃(ΩS⁴) ⊗ H₅(ΩS⁶) ≅ ℤ ⊗ ℤ ≅ ℤ`.\n*   `π₈(Ω²S¹⁰) ≅ π₁₀(S¹⁰) ≅ ℤ`.\n\nThe map `f̃` is related to the Whitehead product. A standard result in homotopy theory asserts that this induced map on `π₈`, which corresponds to a double suspension of the Whitehead product, is an isomorphism `ℤ → ℤ`.\n\nSince `π₈(f̃)` is an isomorphism, the connectivity of `f̃` is at least 9. We then examine `π₉(f̃)`:\n\n`π₉(f̃): π₉(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → π₉(Ω²S¹⁰)`\n\n*   `π₉(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) ≅ H₉(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)`. The Künneth formula shows this group to be trivial.\n*   `π₉(Ω²S¹⁰) ≅ π₁₁(S¹⁰) ≅ π₁ˢ(S⁰) ≅ ℤ/2ℤ` (the first stable homotopy group of spheres).\n\nThe map `π₉(f̃)` is `0 → ℤ/2ℤ`. This map is not surjective. Therefore, the connectivity of `f̃`, and thus of `f`, is exactly 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
