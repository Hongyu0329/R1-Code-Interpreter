    "Let $G$ be a graph with $n=12345$ vertices. The number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color is called the chromatic number, denoted by $\\chi(G)$. A complete graph $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex, requires $n$ colors, so $\\chi(K_n) = n$.\n\nThe problem states that the graph $G$ is not the complete graph $K_{12345}$. For any simple graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n$, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$. This is because, in the worst case, one could assign a unique color to each vertex. Equality holds if and only if the graph is a complete graph.\n\nSince $G$ is not a complete graph, there must exist at least one pair of vertices, say $u$ and $v$, that are not connected by an edge. Because they are not adjacent, $u$ and $v$ can be assigned the same color. We can construct a coloring of $G$ using at most $n-1$ colors. To do this, we can identify the non-adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$ into a single new vertex, creating a graph with $n-1 = 12344$ vertices. This new graph can be colored with at most $12344$ colors. This coloring can then be applied back to the original graph $G$ by assigning the color of the merged vertex to both $u$ and $v$, and all other vertices retain their colors. This provides a proper coloring for $G$, demonstrating that $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$. In our case, this means $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n\nTo determine the maximum number of colors needed, we must check if this upper bound of $12344$ can be achieved. Consider a graph $G^*$ constructed as the disjoint union of a complete graph on 12344 vertices, $K_{12344}$, and a single isolated vertex, $K_1$.\n*   The total number of vertices in $G^*$ is $12344 + 1 = 12345$.\n*   $G^*$ is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertices.\n*   The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components. Therefore, $\\chi(G^*) = \\max(\\chi(K_{12344}), \\chi(K_1))$.\n*   The chromatic number of a complete graph $K_k$ is $k$, and the chromatic number of a single vertex is 1. Thus, $\\chi(G^*) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\nSince we have shown that any non-complete graph with 12345 vertices can be colored with at most 12344 colors, and we have found a specific graph that requires exactly 12344 colors, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344.\n\nAnother relevant theorem is Brooks's Theorem, which states that for a connected graph $G$ that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is at most its maximum degree, $\\Delta(G)$. For a graph with $n$ vertices, $\\Delta(G) \\le n-1$. This theorem also leads to the conclusion that the chromatic number will be at most $n-1=12344$ for most cases.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
