    "The symmetry point group of the molecule bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on the oxidation state of the central copper atom, which results in different molecular geometries. The two common forms are the copper(I) and copper(II) complexes.\n\n### Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)\n\nThe bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) complex, [Cu(C₄H₁₀S₂)₂]⁺, features a copper atom in a +1 oxidation state. In this complex, the copper ion is coordinated by the two sulfur atoms from each of the two 2,5-dithiahexane ligands, resulting in a distorted tetrahedral geometry. The point group for this molecule is **S₄**.\n\n### Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)\n\nIn the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) complex, such as [Cu(C₄H₁₀S₂)₂(BF₄)₂] or [Cu(C₄H₁₀S₂)₂(ClO₄)₂], the copper atom is in a +2 oxidation state. The geometry of this complex is a distorted octahedron. The four sulfur atoms from the two bidentate 2,5-dithiahexane ligands are arranged in a square-planar fashion around the copper ion, and two counter-anions (like tetrafluoroborate or perchlorate) occupy the axial positions.\n\nThe crystal structure of the copper(II) perchlorate complex is reported to belong to the centrosymmetric space group P1/n with the copper atom at a center of inversion. This molecular symmetry is denoted as **Cᵢ** (which is equivalent to an inversion center, sometimes also denoted as *i*).\n\nTherefore, the point group of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on its oxidation state:\n\n*   **bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)** has a point group of **S₄**.\n*   **bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)** has a point group of **Cᵢ**.\n\n<<<S₄ for the copper(I) complex and Cᵢ for the copper(II) complex>>>"
