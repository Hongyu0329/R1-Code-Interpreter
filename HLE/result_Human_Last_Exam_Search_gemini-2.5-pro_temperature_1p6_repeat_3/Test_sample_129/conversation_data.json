    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how to find the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols T, F, !, &, |, (, ).\n\n### Analysis of Possible Structures\n\nWe must find all possible valid boolean expression structures that consist of exactly 5 symbols. The symbols can be repeated. We will categorize them by the number of terminals (T or F) they contain.\n\n#### 1. Structures with 3 Terminals\nThe only way to have 3 terminals (e.g., T, F, T) and 2 other symbols is to use two binary operators (`&` or `|`). This gives the structure `A op1 B op2 C`.\nThe terminals A, B, and C can each be T or F, leading to 2Â³ = 8 combinations. The operators `op1` and `op2` can each be `&` or `|`. Given the precedence `! > & > |`, we analyze the operator combinations:\n\n*   **`A | B | C`**: This expression is true if at least one terminal is T. It is only false for the case `F | F | F`. This gives 7 true expressions.\n*   **`A & B & C`**: This expression is true only if all terminals are T (`T & T & T`). This gives 1 true expression.\n*   **`A | B & C`** (parsed as `A | (B & C)`): This is true if A is T (4 combinations), or if A is F and (B & C) is T (which only happens for `F | (T & T)`). This gives a total of 5 true expressions.\n*   **`A & B | C`** (parsed as `(A & B) | C`): This is true if C is T (4 combinations), or if C is F and (A & B) is T (which only happens for `(T & T) | F`). This gives a total of 5 true expressions.\n\nTotal for 3-terminal structures: 7 + 1 + 5 + 5 = **18**.\n\n#### 2. Structures with 2 Terminals\nTo reach 5 symbols with two terminals (A, B), we need 3 symbols from the set `!, &, |, (, )`.\n\n*   **`!A op !B`**: (5 symbols: `!`, A, `op`, `!`, B). This is parsed as `(!A) op (!B)`.\n    *   `!A | !B`: True unless both `!A` and `!B` are false (i.e., A=T and B=T). This gives 3 true expressions.\n    *   `!A & !B`: True only if both `!A` and `!B` are true (i.e., A=F and B=F). This gives 1 true expression.\n    *   Total: 3 + 1 = 4.\n*   **`!!A op B`**: (5 symbols: `!`, `!`, A, `op`, B). This is parsed as `(!!A) op B`. Since `!!A` is equivalent to A, there are 3 true expressions for `|` and 1 for `&`. Total: 4.\n*   **`A op !!B`**: (5 symbols: A, `op`, `!`, `!`, B). Similar to the above, this gives 4 true expressions.\n*   **`(A) op B`**: (5 symbols: `(`, A, `)`, `op`, B). Parsed as `A op B`. Since `A` and `B` can be T or F, there are 3 true expressions for `|` and 1 for `&`. Total: 4.\n*   **`A op (B)`**: (5 symbols: A, `op`, `(`, B, `)`). Similar to the above, this gives 4 true expressions.\n\nTotal for 2-terminal structures: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = **20**.\n\n#### 3. Structures with 1 Terminal\nTo reach 5 symbols with one terminal (A), we need 4 symbols from `!, (, )`.\n\n*   **`!!!!A`**: (5 symbols: `!`, `!`, `!`, `!`, A).\n    *   `!!!!T` evaluates to `T`. This is 1 true expression.\n    *   `!!!!F` evaluates to `F`.\n*   **`!!(A)`**: (5 symbols: `!`, `!`, `(`, A, `)`).\n    *   `!!(T)` evaluates to `T`. This is 1 true expression.\n    *   `!!(F)` evaluates to `F`.\n*   **(!!A)**: (5 symbols: `(`, `!`, `!`, A, `)`).\n    *   `(!!T)` evaluates to `T`. This is 1 true expression.\n    *   `(!!F)` evaluates to `F`.\n\nTotal for 1-terminal structures: 1 + 1 + 1 = **3**.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nThe total number of true boolean expressions is the sum of the counts from all distinct structures.\n\n*   3-Terminal Structures: 18\n*   2-Terminal Structures: 20\n*   1-Terminal Structures: 3\n\nTotal = 18 + 20 + 3 = 41.\n\n<<<41>>>"
