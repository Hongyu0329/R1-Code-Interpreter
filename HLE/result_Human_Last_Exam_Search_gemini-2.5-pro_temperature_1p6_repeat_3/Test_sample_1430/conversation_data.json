    "The rank of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power, X, of a genus 3 Riemann surface, C, depends on the nature of the curve C. The rank can be determined by the formula `ρ(X) = 1 + ρ(J(C))`, where `ρ` denotes the rank of the Néron-Severi group and `J(C)` is the Jacobian variety of the curve C. The degree of the symmetric power, in this case 15, does not affect the rank. The variation in the rank arises from the different possibilities for the endomorphism ring of the Jacobian `J(C)`.\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe smallest possible rank occurs when the curve C is a \"general\" curve of genus 3. In this case, C is a non-hyperelliptic curve, and its Jacobian `J(C)` has the smallest possible rank for its Néron-Severi group, which is 1. This corresponds to the case where the only endomorphisms of `J(C)` are the trivial integer multiplications.\n\nFor a general curve, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of its symmetric power is 2. Therefore, the minimum rank is:\n`ρ(X)_min = 1 + ρ(J(C))_min = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe largest possible rank is achieved when the curve C is a special type of hyperelliptic curve whose Jacobian `J(C)` has the maximum possible number of endomorphisms, a condition known as complex multiplication (CM).\n\nFor a genus `g` curve, the maximum rank of the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian occurs when the Jacobian is isogenous to the `g`-fold product of a single elliptic curve with complex multiplication, `E^g`. In this case, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian `J(C)` is given by `g(g+1)/2`.\n\nFor a genus `g=3` curve, the maximum rank of the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian is:\n`ρ(J(C))_max = (3 * (3+1)) / 2 = 6`.\n\nSuch curves exist, for example, the hyperelliptic curve defined by `y^2 = x^7 - x`. Its Jacobian has complex multiplication and achieves this maximum rank.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of X is:\n`ρ(X)_max = 1 + ρ(J(C))_max = 1 + 6 = 7`.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X is 2, and the largest possible rank is 7.>>>"
