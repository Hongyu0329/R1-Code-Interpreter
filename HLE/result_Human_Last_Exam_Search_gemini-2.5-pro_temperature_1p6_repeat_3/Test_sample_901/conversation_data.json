    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The regioselectivity of this reaction is determined by both the stereochemistry of the starting material and the nature of the base.\n\nFirst, it is crucial to identify the stereoisomer. (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is the *cis* isomer. In its most stable chair conformation, the larger methyl group occupies the equatorial position to minimize steric strain, which forces the smaller bromine atom into the axial position.\n\nThe E2 elimination mechanism requires an anti-periplanar arrangement between the leaving group (bromine) and a proton on an adjacent carbon. Since the bromine is already in the required axial position in the most stable conformer, the reaction can proceed without needing to flip to a less stable conformation.\n\nThere are two types of beta-hydrogens that are anti-periplanar to the axial bromine:\n1.  The axial hydrogen on carbon 2 (C2), which is also attached to the methyl group.\n2.  The axial hydrogen on carbon 6 (C6).\n\nAbstraction of the proton from C2 would lead to the formation of 1-methylcyclohexene. This is the more substituted alkene and is referred to as the Zaitsev product.\n\nAbstraction of the proton from C6 would result in 3-methylcyclohexene. This is the less substituted alkene, known as the Hofmann product.\n\nThe base used in this reaction is potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu), which is a strong, but sterically bulky base. Due to its large size, it preferentially abstracts the more sterically accessible proton. The axial proton on C6 is less sterically hindered than the axial proton on C2. Consequently, the reaction favors the formation of the less substituted alkene. This is an example where the Hofmann rule prevails over the Zaitsev rule due to the steric hindrance of the base.\n\nTherefore, the major product of the reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
