    "Identifying the single earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas in an aboriginal writing system is a complex question with an answer that has evolved with archaeological discoveries. While several sites present strong evidence, the distinction often comes down to the type of writing system and the certainty of the dating. The earliest forms of writing in Mesoamerica are found among the Olmec and Zapotec peoples.\n\nThe earliest currently known calendrical inscription is found on **Monument 3 at San José Mogote**, in the Oaxaca Valley of Mexico. This monument, attributed to the Zapotec civilization, is dated to around **600 BCE**. The stone carving depicts a slain captive and includes a glyph between his legs representing the day-name \"1 Earthquake\" from the 260-day ritual calendar. This is widely considered one of the oldest examples of writing in Mesoamerica.\n\nFor dates recorded within the more complex Long Count calendar system, which allows for linear dating over long periods, the earliest known example comes from **Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo**, in Chiapas, Mexico. This stela bears a date corresponding to **36 BCE**. For many years, the record was held by Stela C from Tres Zapotes, an Epi-Olmec site in Veracruz, Mexico, with a Long Count date equivalent to **32 BCE**. These early Long Count dates were inscribed using the Epi-Olmec or Isthmian script, a precursor to the famous Maya writing system.\n\nIn summary, while glyphic writing representing a calendar day appeared as early as 600 BCE among the Zapotecs at San José Mogote, the earliest known specific date recorded in the sophisticated Long Count system is from 36 BCE at Chiapa de Corzo.\n\n<<<The earliest known recorded date is a glyph for the day \"1 Earthquake\" on Monument 3 at San José Mogote, Mexico, dated to approximately 600 BCE. The earliest known date recorded in the Long Count calendar system is found on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico, and corresponds to 36 BCE.>>>"
