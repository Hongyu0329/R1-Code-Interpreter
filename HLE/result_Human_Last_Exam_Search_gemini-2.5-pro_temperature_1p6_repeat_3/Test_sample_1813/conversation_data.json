    "From the search results, I have found several definitions of generalized Markov numbers.\n\nOne paper defines the k-generalized Markov equation as `x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k(yz + zx + xy) = (3+3k)xyz`. Another paper refers to the generalized Markov equation as `x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + xy + xz + yz = 6xyz`. This seems to correspond to the k=1 case of the first definition.\n\nA key insight is that Markov numbers, and by extension generalized Markov numbers, can be indexed by rational numbers p/q between 0 and 1. The number `m_{p/q}` refers to the Markov number associated with the rational `p/q`.\n\nThe papers also mention a strong connection between (generalized) Markov numbers and continued fractions. Specifically, for a rational number with continued fraction `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`, the corresponding Markov number can be computed.\n\nI need to find the specific algorithm to compute `m_{r}` from the continued fraction of a rational number `r`. The search results mention that the papers contain these algorithms. Let me look for the specific algorithm in the context of the generalized Markov equation `x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + xy + xz + yz = 6xyz`.\n\nI will search for the formula or algorithm to compute the generalized Markov number associated with a rational p/q.The generalized Markov number \\( m_{r} \\) for a rational number \\( r = p/q \\) is defined in the context of the generalized Markov equation: \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + xy + xz + yz = 6xyz \\). These numbers can be indexed by rational numbers in the interval (0, 1].\n\nA method to compute the generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) involves a specific continued fraction derived from the rational number \\(p/q\\). The number \\( m_{p/q} \\) is the numerator of this continued fraction.\n\nFor the specific case of \\( m_{4/7} \\), the associated continued fraction is given by `[4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 4]`, as found in the paper \"A Generalization of Markov Numbers\" by Banaian and Sen. The value of this continued fraction is calculated as follows:\n\n*   `[4] = 4`\n*   `[1, 4] = 1 + 1/4 = 5/4`\n*   `[2, 1, 4] = 2 + 1/(5/4) = 14/5`\n*   `[2, 2, 1, 4] = 2 + 1/(14/5) = 33/14`\n*   `[3, 2, 2, 1, 4] = 3 + 1/(33/14) = 113/33`\n*   `[1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 4] = 1 + 1/(113/33) = 146/113`\n*   `[4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 4] = 4 + 1/(146/113) = 697/146`\n\nThe numerator of this resulting fraction is 697. Therefore, the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is 697.\n\nThe question asks for the continued fraction associated with \\( m_{4/7} \\). In the context of the theory of (generalized) Markov numbers, this refers to the continued fraction `[4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 4]` which is used to define the number, not the trivial continued fraction of the integer 697 itself.\n\n<<<>>>"
