    "In a surface code architecture, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded is determined by the topology of the surface, specifically by the number of holes or boundaries created within it. Each hole allows for the encoding of one logical qubit.\n\nThe problem specifies two independent patches of surface code. The total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits encoded in each patch.\n\n1.  **Patch 1**: This patch has two holes. Since each hole can encode one logical qubit, this patch can encode 2 logical qubits.\n2.  **Patch 2**: Similarly, this patch also has two holes and can therefore encode 2 logical qubits.\n\nBy adding the logical qubits from each patch, the total number is 2 + 2 = 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
