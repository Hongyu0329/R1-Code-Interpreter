    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $p(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow a standard procedure involving analyzing the polynomial's irreducibility, its discriminant, and its resolvent cubic.\n\n### 1. Irreducibility\nFirst, we check if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime number $p=2$.\n*   The prime 2 divides the coefficients 8 and 14.\n*   The prime 2 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\n*   The square of the prime, $2^2=4$, does not divide the constant term 14.\nSince all conditions are met, the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. An irreducible quartic polynomial must have a Galois group of order divisible by 4. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), or $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4).\n\n### 2. The Discriminant\nThe discriminant of a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256r^3 - 27q^4$. For our polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n\n$\\Delta = 256(14)^3 - 27(8)^4$\n$\\Delta = 256(2744) - 27(4096)$\n$\\Delta = 702464 - 110592$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nNext, we determine if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. A number ending in 2 cannot be a perfect square, so $\\sqrt{591872}$ is not an integer. Since the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities, leaving $S_4$, $D_4$, or $C_4$.\n\n### 3. The Resolvent Cubic\nFor a depressed quartic $x^4 + qx + r$, the resolvent cubic is $y^3 - 4ry - q^2$. For our polynomial, this is:\n\n$y^3 - 4(14)y - (8)^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nWe check if this cubic polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by searching for rational roots. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be a divisor of 64. Testing integer divisors:\n*   For $y=8$: $8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n\nSince $y=8$ is a root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe criteria for determining the Galois group of an irreducible quartic are as follows:\n*   If the resolvent cubic is irreducible, the group is $S_4$ (if $\\Delta$ is not a square) or $A_4$ (if $\\Delta$ is a square).\n*   If the resolvent cubic is reducible, the group is $D_4$ or $C_4$ (if $\\Delta$ is not a square) or $V_4$ (if $\\Delta$ is a square).\n\nIn our case:\n1.  The polynomial is irreducible.\n2.  The discriminant $\\Delta = 591872$ is not a perfect square.\n3.  The resolvent cubic $y^3 - 56y - 64$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThese conditions together imply that the Galois group is either the dihedral group $D_4$ or the cyclic group $C_4$. For an irreducible quartic with a non-square discriminant, a reducible resolvent cubic indicates that the Galois group is a subgroup of $D_4$, and since the order must be divisible by 4, the group is $D_4$ or $C_4$. Standard classification further specifies that if the original polynomial remains irreducible over the field extended by the square root of the discriminant, the group is $D_4$. In this situation (non-square discriminant, reducible resolvent), the group is in fact $D_4$.\n\nThe order of the dihedral group $D_4$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
