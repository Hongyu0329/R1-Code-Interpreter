    "From my initial search, I have gathered the following definitions:\n\n*   **Finite Group:** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for all `a, b` in `S`, the product `ab` is not in `S`. Note that `a` and `b` need not be distinct. This is equivalent to `S` and `SS` being disjoint sets.\n*   **Locally Maximal Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `S` is locally maximal if it is not properly contained in any other product-free set. A product-free set `S` is locally maximal if and only if `G = S ∪ SS ∪ S⁻¹S ∪ SS⁻¹ ∪ S⁻¹ ∪ (SS)⁻¹`. A more precise condition is that `S` is locally maximal if and only if `G = T(S) ∪ √S`, where `T(S) = S ∪ SS ∪ SS⁻¹ ∪ S⁻¹S` and `√S = {x ∈ G | x² ∈ S}`.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group `G` is called \"filled\" if every locally maximal product-free set in `G` is complete. A product-free set `S` is \"complete\" (or \"fills\" `G`) if every non-identity element of `G` is in `S ∪ SS`.\n\nI also found some results on filled groups:\n*   A finite abelian group is filled if and only if it is C3, C5, or an elementary abelian 2-group.\n*   If `G` is a filled group and `N` is a normal subgroup, then `G/N` is filled.\n*   The only filled group with a normal subgroup of index 3 is C3.\n*   If `G` is a filled group with a normal subgroup `N` of index 5 such that not every element of order 5 is contained in `N`, then `G` is isomorphic to C5.\n*   Filled dihedral groups and filled nilpotent groups have been classified.\n\nThe question asks for the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m`.\n\nMy next step is to find classifications of nonabelian groups of order `2q^m` and then to check which of them are filled, using the information I have and potentially searching for more specific classifications of filled groups. I need to look for papers that specifically deal with the classification of filled groups of this particular order.From the previous searches, I've gathered significant information. A key paper states that any finite filled group of order `p^n q^m` for primes `p` and `q` is either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of D6, D8, or D10. The order of the groups in question is `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime. This fits the `p^n q^m` format with `p=2` and `n=1`.\n\nThe dihedral group `D_2n` has order `2n`.\n*   `D6` has order 12, which is `2 * 6 = 2 * (2 * 3)`. This does not fit the form `2q^m` where q is an odd prime.\n*   `D8` has order 16, which is `2 * 8 = 2 * 2^3`. This is a 2-group, not of the form `2q^m` with `q` being an odd prime.\n*   `D10` has order 20, which is `2 * 10 = 2 * (2 * 5)`. Again, this does not fit the required form.\n*   The search results also mention `D_2n` is nonabelian for `n > 2`.\n\nLet's re-examine the cited theorem in: \"Any finite filled group of order p^n q^m for primes p and q, and m, n ∈ N is either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of D6, D8, D10\".\nThe question asks for *nonabelian* filled groups. Elementary abelian 2-groups are abelian. So, we are left with D6, D8, and D10 from this theorem.\n\nLet's check the orders again: `|G| = 2q^m`.\n*   For `D6`, the order is 12 = `2^2 * 3`. This fits the `p^n q^m` form, but not `2q^m`.\n*   For `D8`, the order is 16 = `2^4`. This is a p-group.\n*   For `D10`, the order is 20 = `2^2 * 5`. This also does not fit the form `2q^m`.\n\nHowever, the search results also contain another paper (from the same authors as the one that states the p^n q^m theorem) that says: \"In this paper we classify filled dihedral groups, filled nilpotent groups and filled groups of order 2^n p where p is an odd prime\". This is very close to the question, with m=1. Let's look for the classification of filled dihedral groups. A different paper classifies filled dihedral groups `D_2n` and finds they are filled only for `n=2, 3, 4, 5`. `D_2n` is nonabelian for `n > 2`. So we have `D6` (order 12), `D8` (order 16), `D10` (order 20).\n- `D6` has order 12 = `2 * 6`, not `2q^m`.\n- `D8` has order 16 = `2 * 8`, not `2q^m` for odd q.\n- `D10` has order 20 = `2 * 10`, not `2q^m`.\n\nLet me look for the explicit classification of nonabelian groups of order `2q^m`. A group G of order `2n` with `n` odd has a normal subgroup of order `n`. G is a semidirect product of a group of order `n` and `C2`.\n\nI seem to be going in circles with the provided results. The key seems to be in the paper that classifies filled groups of order `2^n p`. Let me try to find the actual content of that classification.I have found several key pieces of information from the performed searches.\n\nA crucial result is from a paper by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart, which states that any finite filled group of order p^n q^m is either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, D8 × C2, D22, D8 ∗ Q8 or (D8 ∗ Q8) × C2. The groups we are interested in have order 2q^m, which is a specific case of p^n q^m (with p=2, n=1).\n\nThe question asks for *nonabelian* filled groups. Elementary abelian 2-groups are abelian, so we can exclude them. We need to check which of the listed nonabelian groups have an order of the form 2q^m, where q is an odd prime.\n\n*   D6 (order 12 = 2^2 * 3): This is not of the form 2q^m.\n*   D8 (order 16 = 2^4): This is a 2-group, so it's not of the form 2q^m for an odd prime q.\n*   D10 (order 20 = 2^2 * 5): This is not of the form 2q^m.\n*   D12 (order 24 = 2^3 * 3): Not of the form 2q^m.\n*   D14 (order 28 = 2^2 * 7): Not of the form 2q^m.\n*   D22 (order 44 = 2^2 * 11): Not of the form 2q^m.\n*   D8 × C2 (order 16): A 2-group.\n*   D8 ∗ Q8 (order 32): A 2-group.\n*   (D8 ∗ Q8) × C2 (order 64): A 2-group.\n\nAnother relevant result is that no finite group of order 2pq (for primes p, q with 2 < p < q) is filled. The question concerns groups of order 2q^m. When m=1, the order is 2q, which for q>2 is a specific instance of 2pq (with p=1, which isn't a prime, so this theorem doesn't directly apply, however, a group of order 2q is either cyclic or dihedral). Let's analyze the dihedral group D_2n of order 2n. For D_2n to have order 2q^m, n must be q^m. The dihedral groups D_2n are non-abelian for n > 2.\n\nA paper by Anabanti and Hart classifies filled dihedral groups D_2n. They are filled if and only if n ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5}.\nSo the nonabelian filled dihedral groups are D_6 (n=3), D_8 (n=4), D_10 (n=5).\n- `D_6`: order 12 = 2 * 6. Not of the form 2q^m for q odd.\n- `D_8`: order 16. Not of the form 2q^m for q odd.\n- `D_10`: order 10 = 2 * 5. Here q=5, m=1. This fits the form.\n\nWhat about nilpotent groups? A paper by Anabanti and Hart also classifies filled nilpotent groups. A filled nilpotent group is either C3, C5, or a 2-group. The nonabelian filled nilpotent groups must be 2-groups. A group of order 2q^m cannot be a p-group if q is an odd prime. Thus, any nonabelian filled group of order 2q^m from this classification must be a 2-group, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no nonabelian filled nilpotent groups of order 2q^m.\n\nLet's re-examine the `p^n q^m` result. A full quote is: \"Any finite filled group of order p^n q^m for primes p and q, and m, n ∈ N is either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, D8 × C2, D22, D8 ∗ Q8 or (D8 ∗ Q8) × C2\". Of these, only D10 has the order of the form 2q^m, which is 2 * 5^1. This would imply that D10 is the only such group.\n\nI'm confident I have a consistent set of results pointing to D10. The classification of filled groups of order `p^n q^m` seems to be the most direct path to the answer. The dihedral group classification confirms this. I should structure my final answer based on these findings.\n\nFinal check:\n1.  Are there any other nonabelian groups of order `2q^m` that could be filled? All groups of order 2q^m are solvable. The provided classification seems to cover solvable groups of order `p^n q^m`.\n2.  Does any other group in the list `D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, D8 × C2, D22, D8 ∗ Q8 or (D8 ∗ Q8) × C2` have an order of the form `2q^m`? I have checked this and the only one is `D10`.\n3.  Are there any other classifications of filled groups that might be relevant? The ones I have found are for odd order, nilpotent, dihedral, and `p^n q^m` orders. The `p^n q^m` seems most general and fitting.\n\nIt seems I have enough information to answer the question.\n\nBased on existing classifications of finite filled groups, the nonabelian filled groups of order \\(2q^m\\), where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number, can be determined.\n\nA significant result in this area, provided by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart, classifies all finite filled groups with order of the form \\(p^n q^m\\), where `p` and `q` are prime numbers. According to their work, any such group is either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of the following: D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, D22, D8 × C2, D8 ∗ Q8, or (D8 ∗ Q8) × C2.\n\nThe question specifies nonabelian groups, which means we can disregard the elementary abelian 2-groups as they are abelian. We then examine the orders of the remaining listed groups to see which ones fit the \\(2q^m\\) structure for an odd prime `q`:\n\n*   **D6**: The dihedral group of order 12, which is \\(2^2 \\cdot 3\\). This is not of the form \\(2q^m\\).\n*   **D8**: The dihedral group of order 16, which is \\(2^4\\). This is a 2-group and not of the form \\(2q^m\\) for an odd prime `q`.\n*   **D10**: The dihedral group of order 20, which is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5\\). This is not of the form \\(2q^m\\). However, some literature uses the notation D_n for the group of order 2n. In that notation, `D_5` has order 10, which is `2 * 5^1`. This fits the required form with `q=5` and `m=1`. For `n>2`, dihedral groups are non-abelian.\n*   **D12**: The dihedral group of order 24, which is \\(2^3 \\cdot 3\\). This is not of the form \\(2q^m\\).\n*   **D14**: The dihedral group of order 28, which is \\(2^2 \\cdot 7\\). This is not of the form \\(2q^m\\).\n*   **D22**: The dihedral group of order 44, which is \\(2^2 \\cdot 11\\). This is not of the form \\(2q^m\\).\n*   **D8 × C2**: This group has order 16 and is a 2-group.\n*   **D8 ∗ Q8**: This group (a central product) has order 32 and is a 2-group.\n*   **(D8 ∗ Q8) × C2**: This group has order 64 and is a 2-group.\n\nThe classification of filled dihedral groups by Anabanti and Hart states that the dihedral group `D_2n` (of order 2n) is filled if and only if `n` is in the set {2, 3, 4, 5}. The nonabelian filled dihedral groups are therefore D6 (order 12), D8 (order 16), and D10 (order 10, here denoted `D_10` for a pentagon). Of these, only D10, with order \\(10 = 2 \\cdot 5^1\\), has the form \\(2q^m\\).\n\nFurthermore, the classification of filled nilpotent groups shows that a nonabelian filled nilpotent group must be a 2-group, which a group of order \\(2q^m\\) with `q` odd cannot be.\n\nAnother result by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart states that no finite group of order `2pq` (for distinct odd primes `p` and `q`) is filled.\n\nBased on the comprehensive classification of filled groups of order \\(p^n q^m\\), the only nonabelian group that satisfies the condition of being filled and having an order of the form \\(2q^m\\) for an odd prime `q` is the dihedral group of order 10, D10 (also denoted as D5).\n\n<<<The only nonabelian filled group of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m is the dihedral group of order 10, D10.>>>"
