    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (dptztz) is reacted with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear complex is formed, not a simple mononuclear one. The dptztz ligand acts as a bridge connecting two ruthenium centers.\n\nThe reaction with two equivalents of [*cis*-[Ru(bpy)₂Cl₂]] results in a dinuclear complex, [{Ru(bpy)₂}₂(dptztz)]⁴⁺. Each of the two ruthenium atoms in this complex is chiral, meaning it can exist in either a delta (Δ) or a lambda (Λ) configuration.\n\nThis leads to the formation of two diastereomers:\n*   A **meso** form, where the two ruthenium centers have opposite chirality (Δ/Λ).\n*   A **racemic** form (a mixture of two enantiomers), where the ruthenium centers have the same chirality (Δ/Δ and Λ/Λ).\n\nThese two diastereomers, the *meso* and the *rac* form, are the isomers produced in the reaction and can be separated by methods like cation exchange chromatography. Therefore, two isomers (as separable diastereomeric products) are formed.\n\n<<<2>>>"
