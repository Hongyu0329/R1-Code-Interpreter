  "response_list": [
    "I have been unable to find any information about a Belgian refugee named Andre Vernault who was falsely believed to be a German spy by British counterintelligence during World War II. Searches for this individual, and variations of the name, have not yielded any relevant results in the context of WWII espionage or false accusations against refugees.\n\nWhile there are documented cases of German spies posing as refugees, and of British counterintelligence (MI5) investigating and sometimes wrongly suspecting individuals, the specific case of Andre Vernault and his true profession does not appear in the available historical records. It is possible that the name is misspelled, the details of the case are not publicly documented, or the information may be inaccurate.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide an answer to what his true profession was."
