Here are the equations for the absorption cross-section.

**a) The interaction between molecules can be neglected:**

σ(ω) ≈ N * (2π²αħω / c) * |**μ**_eg|² * G(ħω - (E_e - E_g))

where:
*   σ(ω) is the absorption cross-section as a function of angular frequency ω.
*   N is the number of molecules in the chain.
*   α is the fine-structure constant.
*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant.
*   c is the speed of light.
*   **μ**_eg is the transition dipole moment of a single molecule between the ground state |g⟩ and the excited state |e⟩.
*   E_e and E_g are the energies of the excited and ground states, respectively.
*   G(E) is a Gaussian lineshape function, representing the spectral profile of the ultrashort pulse, centered around E=0. Its width is inversely proportional to the pulse duration.

**b) The interaction between near-neighbors should be considered:**

σ(ω) ≈ N * (2π²αħω / c) * |**μ**_eg|² * G(ħω - (E_e + 2J - E_g))

where all variables are the same as in (a), with the addition of:
*   J is the near-neighbor interaction energy.

This equation specifically describes the absorption to the optically allowed k=0 Frenkel exciton state, which is shifted in energy by 2J compared to the monomer transition.
