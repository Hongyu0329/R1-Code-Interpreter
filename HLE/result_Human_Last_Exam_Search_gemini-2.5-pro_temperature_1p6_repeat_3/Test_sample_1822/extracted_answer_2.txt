Because the problem as stated is conceptual and involves a hypothetical, non-standard metric ("E_r"), a numerical answer cannot be calculated. The scenario highlights the insufficiency of purely quantitative measures in the face of conflicting evidence and confounding structural properties like an hourglass bottleneck. The confirmation of a true violation would depend on further qualitative and causal analysis rather than a predefined evidence ratio.
