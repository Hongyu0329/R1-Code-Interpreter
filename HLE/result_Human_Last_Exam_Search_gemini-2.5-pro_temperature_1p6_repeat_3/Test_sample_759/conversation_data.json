    "To determine the smallest number of edges `e` for a simple, connected graph `γ` with an automorphism group of order 3, `|Aut(γ)|=3`, we must consider both the number of vertices and the number of edges.\n\n1.  **Minimum Number of Vertices:** A graph with an automorphism of order 3 must have a vertex orbit of size 3. Thus, the graph must have at least 3 vertices.\n    *   Simple connected graphs on 3 or 4 vertices with a 3-fold symmetry, such as the triangle `K3` or the complete graph `K4`, have automorphism groups of order 6 (`S3`) and 24 (`S4`) respectively, which is larger than 3.\n    *   According to the literature, the smallest number of vertices a graph can have for its automorphism group to be the cyclic group of order 3 (`C3`) is 9. Graphs with automorphism groups `C3`, `C4`, and `C5` are known exceptions to the rule that the minimum number of vertices is at most twice the order of the group.\n\n2.  **Minimum Number of Edges on 9 Vertices:**\n    *   A connected graph with `n` vertices must have at least `n-1` edges. If it has exactly `n-1` edges, it is a tree.\n    *   For a graph with 9 vertices to be connected, it must have at least `9-1 = 8` edges.\n    *   However, it has been proven that for any prime `p ≥ 3`, no tree `T` exists such that `|Aut(T)| = p`. Therefore, a graph with an automorphism group of order 3 cannot be a tree.\n    *   This implies the graph must contain at least one cycle, so the number of edges `e` must be greater than or equal to the number of vertices `n`.\n    *   Since the minimum number of vertices is 9, the minimum number of edges must be at least 9.\n\n3.  **Constructing a Candidate Graph:**\n    We need to find a graph with 9 vertices and 9 edges that is connected and has an automorphism group of order 3. A known construction for such a graph exists. Consider a graph with three sets of three vertices, which we can label `v1, v2, v3`, `u1, u2, u3`, and `w1, w2, w3`. The edges are defined as follows:\n    *   Three edges connecting `v_i` to `u_i`: `(v1,u1)`, `(v2,u2)`, `(v3,u3)`.\n    *   Three edges connecting `u_i` to `w_i`: `(u1,w1)`, `(u2,w2)`, `(u3,w3)`.\n    *   Three \"twisted\" edges connecting `u_i` to `v_{i+1}` (indices are modulo 3): `(u1,v2)`, `(u2,v3)`, `(u3,v1)`.\n\n    This graph has `n=9` vertices and `e=9` edges. It is connected, and its automorphism group is precisely the cyclic group of order 3, generated by the permutation `(v1,v2,v3)(u1,u2,u3)(w1,w2,w3)`. The \"twisted\" edges break the reflectional symmetries that would otherwise increase the order of the automorphism group.\n\nSince a graph with `|Aut(γ)|=3` must have at least 9 vertices, and cannot be a tree, it must have at least 9 edges. The existence of the graph described above shows that `e=9` is achievable.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of edges is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
