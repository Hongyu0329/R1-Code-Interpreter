    "The minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory is one.\n\nThis is possible in a scalar field theory with a φ⁴ interaction term. In such a theory, the fundamental interaction vertex connects four lines. A two-loop vacuum diagram can be constructed with a single one of these vertices.\n\nThis diagram, often called a \"figure-eight\" diagram, consists of a single 4-point vertex where the lines are connected in pairs. Two lines emerge from the vertex and loop back to connect to the same vertex, forming two independent loops.\n\nThe number of loops (L) in a connected Feynman diagram is given by the formula:\nL = I - V + 1\nwhere I is the number of internal lines and V is the number of vertices.\n\nFor the figure-eight diagram in φ⁴ theory:\n*   V = 1 (a single four-point vertex)\n*   I = 2 (two internal lines, or propagators)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula gives:\nL = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2\n\nThus, a two-loop diagram with only one vertex is a valid configuration in φ⁴ theory. For a theory with only φ³ interactions, the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop diagram is two, as the number of vertices must be even. Therefore, the absolute minimum across all interacting scalar field theories is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
