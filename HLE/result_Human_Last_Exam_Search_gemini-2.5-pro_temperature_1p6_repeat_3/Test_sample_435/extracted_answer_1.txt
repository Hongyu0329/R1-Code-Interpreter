Based on the body of evidence about the role of interleukin-15 in supporting T cell function, I would predict that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 will exhibit an enhanced cytokine release upon antigen stimulation compared to T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This is due to IL-15's role in promoting T cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation into more potent effector cells, which are primed for a robust cytokine response. This prediction is supported by findings of increased effector cytokine secretion (e.g., IFN-Î³, IL-2) and a higher incidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in studies involving IL-15-enhanced CAR T cells.
