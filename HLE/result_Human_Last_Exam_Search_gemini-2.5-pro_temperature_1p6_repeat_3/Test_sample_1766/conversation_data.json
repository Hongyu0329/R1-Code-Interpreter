    "In the problem of spin-orbit coupling for a p-electron, we seek the common eigenvalues of the total angular momentum squared operator, $J^2$, and the z-component of the total angular momentum operator, $J_z$. The total angular momentum, **J**, is the sum of the orbital angular momentum, **L**, and the spin angular momentum, **S**.\n\n**1. Determining the Quantum Numbers**\n\nFor a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number, *l*, is 1. Electrons are spin-1/2 particles, so the spin quantum number, *s*, is 1/2.\n\n**2. Possible Values for Total Angular Momentum**\n\nThe total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, can take values ranging from |*l* - *s*| to *l* + *s* in integer steps.\n\n*   *j* can range from |1 - 1/2| to 1 + 1/2.\n*   This gives two possible values for *j*: 1/2 and 3/2.\n\nThese two values of *j* correspond to two different energy levels due to spin-orbit coupling, often denoted as P₁/₂ and P₃/₂.\n\n**3. Eigenvalues of J²**\n\nThe eigenvalues of the $J^2$ operator are given by the formula ħ²*j*(*j* + 1), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n*   For **j = 3/2**, the eigenvalue of $J^2$ is:\n    ħ² * (3/2) * (3/2 + 1) = ħ² * (3/2) * (5/2) = **(15/4)ħ²**\n\n*   For **j = 1/2**, the eigenvalue of $J^2$ is:\n    ħ² * (1/2) * (1/2 + 1) = ħ² * (1/2) * (3/2) = **(3/4)ħ²**\n\n**4. Eigenvalues of Jz**\n\nThe eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are given by ħ*m_j*, where *m_j* can take values from -*j* to +*j* in integer steps.\n\n*   For the state with **j = 3/2**, the possible values for *m_j* are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, and 3/2. The corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are:\n    *   **-3/2 ħ**\n    *   **-1/2 ħ**\n    *   **1/2 ħ**\n    *   **3/2 ħ**\n\n*   For the state with **j = 1/2**, the possible values for *m_j* are -1/2 and 1/2. The corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are:\n    *   **-1/2 ħ**\n    *   **1/2 ħ**\n\n**Summary of Common Eigenvalues**\n\nThe common eigenvalues are the pairs of eigenvalues for the simultaneous eigenstates of $J^2$ and $J_z$:\n\n*   For the j = 3/2 multiplet:\n    *   $J^2$ eigenvalue: (15/4)ħ²\n    *   $J_z$ eigenvalues: -3/2 ħ, -1/2 ħ, 1/2 ħ, 3/2 ħ\n\n*   For the j = 1/2 multiplet:\n    *   $J^2$ eigenvalue: (3/4)ħ²\n    *   $J_z$ eigenvalues: -1/2 ħ, 1/2 ħ\n\nEach specific state of the p-electron in the presence of spin-orbit coupling is characterized by a pair of these eigenvalues, one for $J^2$ and one for $J_z$.\n\n<<<For a p-electron, the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number *j* are 3/2 and 1/2.\n\nFor j = 3/2, the eigenvalue of J² is (15/4)ħ² and the eigenvalues of Jz are (3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, and (-3/2)ħ.\n\nFor j = 1/2, the eigenvalue of J² is (3/4)ħ² and the eigenvalues of Jz are (1/2)ħ and (-1/2)ħ.>>>"
