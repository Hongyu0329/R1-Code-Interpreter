An FGH-tripled fixed point for functions F:X×Y×Z→X, G:Y×Z×X→Y, and H:Z×X×Y→Z exists if the following conditions are met: (1) X, Y, and Z are complete metric spaces, often with a partial ordering. (2) The functions F, G, and H satisfy a mixed monotone property with respect to the partial order. (3) The functions satisfy a contractive condition, ensuring that applying the functions reduces the "distance" between triplets of points. (4) There exists an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) that has a specific ordered relationship with the output of the functions at that point. (5) The functions are continuous, or the metric spaces satisfy a certain regularity condition related to the convergence of monotone sequences.
