    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a generalization of the concept of a fixed point for three functions F, G, and H. Given a potential typo in the problem's formulation, the standard definition in mathematical literature will be assumed. Let X, Y, and Z be non-empty sets. The functions are typically defined as:\n*   F: X × Y × Z → X\n*   G: Y × Z × X → Y\n*   H: Z × X × Y → Z\n\nAn **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triplet (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, z, x) = y\n*   H(z, x, y) = z\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are guaranteed under certain conditions, which are established in what are known as tripled fixed point theorems. These conditions typically relate to the properties of the spaces the functions are defined on and the nature of the functions themselves. The primary conditions are as follows:\n\n### **1. Properties of the Underlying Space**\n\nThe functions are generally defined on metric spaces. The most common requirement is that (X, dₓ), (Y, dᵧ), and (Z, d₂) are **complete metric spaces**. In many theoretical results, these are specialized to **partially ordered complete metric spaces**. The theory has also been extended to more abstract spaces like cone metric spaces and rectangular b-metric spaces.\n\nFor partially ordered spaces, the product space X × Y × Z is endowed with a partial order. For example, (x, y, z) ≤ (u, v, w) if and only if x ≤ u, y ≥ v, and z ≤ w.\n\n### **2. Mixed Monotone Property**\n\nWhen dealing with partially ordered metric spaces, the functions F, G, and H must typically satisfy a **mixed monotone property**. This property describes the directional behavior of the functions with respect to the ordering. For instance, the mapping F has the mixed monotone property if it is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument. Specifically, for any x₁, x₂, y₁, y₂, z₁, z₂ in their respective sets:\n\n*   If x₁ ≤ x₂, then F(x₁, y, z) ≤ F(x₂, y, z)\n*   If y₁ ≤ y₂, then F(x, y₁, z) ≥ F(x, y₂, z)\n*   If z₁ ≤ z₂, then F(x, y, z₁) ≤ F(x, y, z₂)\n\nSimilar monotonicity conditions would apply to G and H with respect to their arguments in a cyclic manner.\n\n### **3. Contractive Conditions**\n\nThe core of most fixed point theorems is a **contractive condition**. This ensures that iterative application of the functions brings points closer together, eventually leading to a fixed point. For FGH-tripled fixed points, this condition is defined on the product space. A common form of this condition is a generalization of the Banach contraction principle.\n\nLet (X, dₓ), (Y, dᵧ), and (Z, d₂) be metric spaces. A typical contractive condition would be:\ndₓ(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + dᵧ(G(y, z, x), G(v, w, u)) + d₂(H(z, x, y), H(w, u, v)) ≤ k * (dₓ(x, u) + dᵧ(y, v) + d₂(z, w))\n\nfor all x, u ∈ X; y, v ∈ Y; z, w ∈ Z, where k is a constant in the interval [0, 1).\n\nMore general contractive conditions may involve:\n*   Different constants for each term: j * dₓ(x, u) + k * dᵧ(y, v) + l * d₂(z, w) where j+k+l < 1.\n*   Non-linear contractive conditions using comparison functions (φ-maps).\n*   Dependence on the distance to the fixed point itself in more complex contractive definitions.\n\n### **4. Existence of an Initial Point**\n\nMany theorems require the existence of a starting point (x₀, y₀, z₀) ∈ X × Y × Z that satisfies a specific ordering relationship with the functions. For example:\n*   x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n*   y₀ ≥ G(y₀, z₀, x₀)\n*   z₀ ≤ H(z₀, x₀, y₀)\n\nThis condition provides the basis for constructing a sequence that is guaranteed to converge to the tripled fixed point.\n\n### **5. Continuity of Functions or Regularity of the Space**\n\nTo ensure the limit of the convergent sequence is indeed a fixed point, an additional condition is often required. This can be either:\n*   The continuity of the functions F, G, and H.\n*   A regularity condition on the partially ordered metric space. For instance, it might be required that if a non-decreasing sequence {xₙ} converges to x, then xₙ ≤ x for all n, and similarly for non-increasing sequences.\n\nIn summary, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is typically guaranteed if the functions operate on complete metric spaces (often with a partial order), satisfy a mixed monotone property and a contractive condition, and there exists a suitable starting point. The continuity of the functions or a regularity property of the space is also a common requirement.\n\n**<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for functions F:X×Y×Z→X, G:Y×Z×X→Y, and H:Z×X×Y→Z exists if the following conditions are met: (1) X, Y, and Z are complete metric spaces, often with a partial ordering. (2) The functions F, G, and H satisfy a mixed monotone property with respect to the partial order. (3) The functions satisfy a contractive condition, ensuring that applying the functions reduces the \"distance\" between triplets of points. (4) There exists an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) that has a specific ordered relationship with the output of the functions at that point. (5) The functions are continuous, or the metric spaces satisfy a certain regularity condition related to the convergence of monotone sequences.>>>**An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a generalization of the concept of a fixed point for three functions F, G, and H.
