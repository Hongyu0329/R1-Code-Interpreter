    "The user is asking for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n\nFrom the search results, I have the following key information:\n1.  Any finite ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded into a Banach space. Specifically, they can be embedded into $\\ell_p$ spaces for $p \\ge 1$ and into Hilbert spaces ($\\ell_2$).\n2.  The existence of at least one isometric embedding is guaranteed for any infinite-dimensional Banach space.\n3.  The question is about the *smallest possible number* of such embeddings. This suggests that there might be more than one.\n\nThe initial search did not directly address the *number* of distinct isometric embeddings. I need to investigate this further. The cardinality of the Banach space, K, is also a parameter, which might influence the answer.\n\nI will refine my search strategy to focus on the uniqueness and multiplicity of such embeddings.\n\nUpdated plan:\n1. Perform a Google search for \"uniqueness of isometric embedding of finite ultrametric space\".\n2. Search for \"number of isometries of a Banach space\". The number of embeddings is related to the isometries of the target space. If $f: X \\to B$ is an isometric embedding, and $T: B \\to B$ is an isometry, then $T \\circ f$ is another isometric embedding if the image of $X$ under $f$ is not mapped to itself in the same orientation.\n3. Investigate the structure of the set of isometric embeddings from a finite ultrametric space into a Banach space.\n4. Synthesize the findings to determine the smallest possible number of embeddings. It's possible the answer is 0, 1, or something else depending on the properties of X and B. The question asks for the \"smallest possible\" number, which suggests we should consider the most favorable conditions for minimizing this number.I have already performed a search and have some initial results. My understanding is that at least one such embedding exists. Now I need to determine the *smallest possible number* of these embeddings. The initial search results do not directly answer this question. I need to delve deeper into the uniqueness and multiplicity of these embeddings.\n\nMy next step will be to investigate the uniqueness of such isometric embeddings. If an embedding is unique up to an isometry of the Banach space, then the number of embeddings will depend on the isometry group of the Banach space.\n\nI will start by searching for the uniqueness of these embeddings.An isometric embedding of a metric space $(X, d_X)$ into a Banach space $(B, ||\\cdot||)$ is a function $f: X \\to B$ such that for all $x, y \\in X$, we have $||f(x) - f(y)|| = d_X(x, y)$. The question asks for the smallest possible number of such embeddings for a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$.\n\nLet's analyze the problem by considering the possible sizes of the finite ultrametric space $X$.\n\n1.  **The trivial case: a single-point space.**\n    Let $X$ be a finite ultrametric space with only one point, say $X = \\{x_0\\}$. The only distance in this space is $d_X(x_0, x_0) = 0$. This is a valid finite ultrametric space as the ultrametric inequality, $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$, holds trivially.\n    Let's consider the simplest possible Banach space, the zero-dimensional space $B = \\{0\\}$. This is a complete normed vector space and thus a Banach space. Its cardinality is $K=1$.\n    There is only one possible function $f: X \\to B$, which is $f(x_0) = 0$. To check if this is an isometric embedding, we must verify if the distances are preserved:\n    $||f(x_0) - f(x_0)|| = ||0 - 0|| = 0$.\n    Since $d_X(x_0, x_0) = 0$, the condition is satisfied.\n    Therefore, for the pair $(X=\\{x_0\\}, B=\\{0\\})$, there is exactly one isometric embedding.\n\n2.  **Existence of at least one embedding.**\n    It is a known result in mathematics that for any finite ultrametric space $X$, there exists at least one isometric embedding into some Banach space. For example, the Kuratowski embedding provides a general method for isometrically embedding any finite metric space into a Banach space. Therefore, the smallest possible number of embeddings cannot be zero.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on the smallest possible number.**\n    From the above points, we have established:\n    *   The number of isometric embeddings can be 1 (as demonstrated by the single-point space and the zero Banach space).\n    *   The number of isometric embeddings cannot be 0.\n\n    Combining these, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 1.\n\nIt is worth noting that if the finite ultrametric space $X$ has more than one point, any Banach space $B$ that can host an isometric embedding of $X$ must be non-trivial (i.e., $B \\neq \\{0\\}$). In any such non-trivial Banach space over the real or complex numbers, if $f: X \\to B$ is one isometric embedding, then for any vector $v \\in B$, the translated function $g(x) = f(x) + v$ is also an isometric embedding. Since a non-trivial Banach space contains infinitely many vectors $v$, this would lead to an infinite number of distinct isometric embeddings. For the question about the \"smallest possible number\" to have a finite answer, the trivial case of a single-point space must be considered.\n\n<<<1>>>"
