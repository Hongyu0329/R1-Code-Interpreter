    "A Pauli channel for a d-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is a quantum channel $\\Lambda$ that can be expressed in the form:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger $$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the density matrix of the qudit, $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ is the set of $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators which form a complete orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, and $\\{p_k\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_k \\ge 0$ for all $k$ and $\\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k = 1$. The operators $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$ are the Kraus operators of the channel.\n\nThe complementary channel, denoted $\\Lambda^c$, describes the evolution of the state of the environment that interacts with the qudit during the action of the channel $\\Lambda$. To define the complementary channel, we use the Stinespring dilation theorem. The action of any quantum channel $\\Lambda$ can be represented as a unitary evolution on a larger system, followed by tracing out an ancillary environment system. Specifically, there exists an environment Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_E$ and an isometry $V: \\mathcal{H} \\to \\mathcal{H} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ such that:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E[V \\rho V^\\dagger] $$\nThe complementary channel is then defined by tracing out the system's Hilbert space instead of the environment's:\n$$ \\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_{\\mathcal{H}}[V \\rho V^\\dagger] $$\nThe output of the complementary channel is a density matrix on the environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$. In a minimal Stinespring dilation, the dimension of the environment, $\\dim(\\mathcal{H}_E)$, is equal to the rank of the Choi matrix of the channel $\\Lambda$, also known as the Choi rank.\n\nFor a Pauli channel with Kraus operators $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$, the Stinespring isometry can be written as:\n$$ V |\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} (A_k |\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes |k\\rangle_E = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} (\\sqrt{p_k} U_k |\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes |k\\rangle_E $$\nwhere $\\{|k\\rangle_E\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for the environment $\\mathcal{H}_E$. Since the $d^2$ Pauli operators are linearly independent, if we choose a Pauli channel where all probabilities $p_k$ are strictly positive (for example, the depolarizing channel), there will be $d^2$ linearly independent Kraus operators. This means the minimal dimension of the environment $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is $d^2$.\n\nThe \"rank of a channel\" is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. The rank of the Choi matrix of a channel is equal to the dimension of the subspace spanned by its possible output states. For the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$, its domain is the space of $d \\times d$ density matrices, which has dimension $d^2$. Therefore, the dimension of the image of $\\Lambda^c$, and consequently the rank of its Choi matrix, cannot exceed $d^2$.\n\nTo find the maximal rank, we need to show that this upper bound can be achieved. Let's compute the output of the complementary channel for a specific input state. The output state in the environment basis is:\n$$ \\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d^2-1} \\text{Tr}[A_j \\rho A_k^\\dagger] |j\\rangle_E\\langle k|_E = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_j p_k} \\text{Tr}[\\rho U_k^\\dagger U_j] |j\\rangle_E\\langle k|_E $$\nLet's choose the input state to be the maximally mixed state, $\\rho = I/d$. Using the orthonormality property of the Pauli basis, $\\text{Tr}[U_k^\\dagger U_j] = d \\cdot \\delta_{jk}$, we get:\n$$ \\Lambda^c(I/d) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_j p_k} \\frac{1}{d} \\text{Tr}[U_k^\\dagger U_j] |j\\rangle_E\\langle k|_E = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_j p_k} \\delta_{jk} |j\\rangle_E\\langle k|_E = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k |k\\rangle_E\\langle k|_E $$\nThis output state is a diagonal matrix with the probabilities $p_k$ on the diagonal. If we consider a Pauli channel where all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero (i.e., $p_k > 0$ for all $k$), then this output state is a diagonal matrix of size $d^2 \\times d^2$ with $d^2$ non-zero entries on the diagonal. The rank of this output state is therefore $d^2$.\n\nSince the rank of an output state cannot exceed the rank of the channel, the existence of an output state with rank $d^2$ implies that the rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ must be at least $d^2$. As we established earlier that the rank cannot exceed $d^2$, the maximal rank must be exactly $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
