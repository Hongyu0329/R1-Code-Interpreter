    "To determine the number of integer values for the side length AC for which there are two possible values for side length AB, we must analyze the conditions of the ambiguous case in trigonometry.\n\nLet the sides of triangle ABC be denoted by `a`, `b`, and `c` opposite to angles A, B, and C respectively.\nWe are given:\n*   `a = BC = S = SNYWR`\n*   `m∠B = 30°`\n*   `b = AC` is the side whose integer values we are counting.\n*   `c = AB` is the side for which there are two possible values.\n\nUsing the Law of Sines:\n`a / sin(A) = b / sin(B)`\n`sin(A) = (a * sin(B)) / b`\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n`sin(A) = (S * sin(30°)) / b = (S * 0.5) / b = S / (2b)`\n\nFor there to be two possible triangles, and thus two possible lengths for side AB, two conditions must be met for the angle A:\n\n1.  **`0 < sin(A) < 1`**: This ensures that there are two possible angles, `A₁` (an acute angle) and `A₂ = 180° - A₁` (an obtuse angle).\n    *   `sin(A) < 1` implies `S / (2b) < 1`, which rearranges to `S < 2b`, or `AC > S/2`.\n\n2.  **The second angle `A₂` must be a valid angle for the triangle**: This means the sum of angles `A₂` and `B` must be less than 180°.\n    *   `A₂ + B < 180°`\n    *   `(180° - A₁) + 30° < 180°`\n    *   `210° - A₁ < 180°`\n    *   `A₁ > 30°`\n\n    Since `A₁` and `B` are acute angles, the condition `A₁ > 30°` is equivalent to `sin(A₁) > sin(30°)`.\n    *   `S / (2b) > 1/2`\n    *   `S > b`, which means `AC < S`.\n\nCombining these two conditions, the length of side AC must be in the range `S/2 < AC < S`.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of integer values of AC in this interval. The number of integers `k` such that `x < k < y` is `floor(y-1) - floor(x)`. In our case, the number of integer values is `(S-1) - floor(S/2)`.\nThis can also be expressed as `floor((S-1)/2)`.\n\nHowever, the problem provides `S = SNYWR`, which is not a defined numerical value. Without a numerical value for `S`, it is impossible to compute the final number of integer values for AC. The problem is unsolvable as stated."
