    "Using the frameworks of the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems, the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (a photon gas) align with the established results of Bose-Einstein statistics and Planck's law for black-body radiation. Large deviation theory provides a rigorous probabilistic foundation for these well-known thermodynamic properties.\n\nA photon gas in equilibrium is a collection of photons, which are bosons, inside a cavity at a specific temperature. A key characteristic of this system is that the number of photons is not conserved; they can be emitted and absorbed by the walls of the container. This leads to a chemical potential of zero at thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\n### The Role of Large Deviation Theorems\n\nLarge deviation theory deals with the probabilities of rare events. In statistical mechanics, it provides a framework to understand why a system is overwhelmingly likely to be found in its equilibrium macrostate.\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem relates the probability of an empirical distribution deviating from the true distribution to the Kullback-Leibler divergence or relative entropy. In the context of statistical mechanics, the equilibrium state is the most probable macrostate, corresponding to the one with the maximum entropy. Boltzmann's original work in 1877 is considered a precursor to this theorem.\n\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem provides an exponential bound on the probability that the empirical mean of a set of independent and identically distributed random variables deviates from its expected value. When applied to the energy of photons, it helps in determining the properties related to the mean energy of the system.\n\n### Equilibrium Values\n\nBy applying these large deviation theorems to a Bose gas of photons, one can analyze the energy distributions and derive the thermodynamic properties. The research shows that this approach successfully reproduces the results of Bose and Planck. The equilibrium state is the one that minimizes the large deviation rate function, which is equivalent to maximizing the entropy.\n\n#### Mean Energy\n\nFor a photon gas in thermal equilibrium at a temperature T, the mean number of photons in a state with energy *hν* (where *h* is Planck's constant and *ν* is the frequency) is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution with zero chemical potential:\n\n<center>⟨n<sub>ν</sub>⟩ = 1 / (e<sup>(hν/k<sub>B</sub>T)</sup> - 1)</center>\n\nwhere *k<sub>B</sub>* is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe mean energy density *u(ν)* as a function of frequency is given by Planck's law of black-body radiation:\n\n<center>u(ν)dν = (8πhν<sup>3</sup> / c<sup>3</sup>) * (1 / (e<sup>(hν/k<sub>B</sub>T)</sup> - 1)) dν</center>\n\nThe **total mean energy (U)** of the photon gas in a volume V is obtained by integrating the energy density over all frequencies, which leads to the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\n<center>U = (8π<sup>5</sup>k<sub>B</sub><sup>4</sup> / 15(hc)<sup>3</sup>) V T<sup>4</sup> ∝ T<sup>4</sup></center>\n\nThe application of the Cramer-Chernoff theorem provides a probabilistic justification for this mean energy value as the overwhelmingly most likely outcome for a system with a large number of photons.\n\n#### Entropy\n\nThe **entropy (S)** of the photon gas at equilibrium can be derived from thermodynamic relations or, more fundamentally, from the statistical mechanics counting of states as done by Bose and justified by the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem. The probability of observing a particular macroscopic state is exponentially related to its entropy. The equilibrium state, being the most probable, is the one with the highest entropy.\n\nThe resulting entropy for a photon gas is:\n\n<center>S = (32π<sup>5</sup>k<sub>B</sub><sup>4</sup> / 45(hc)<sup>3</sup>) V T<sup>3</sup> ∝ T<sup>3</sup></center>\n\nIn the limit of absolute zero temperature (T → 0), all photons would occupy the lowest energy state. In this state, there is only one possible arrangement of the system, leading to an entropy of zero, which is consistent with the third law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn summary, the application of the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems to a photon gas affirms the equilibrium values of mean energy and entropy derived from standard Bose-Einstein statistics. These theorems provide a rigorous mathematical framework demonstrating why the equilibrium state, as described by Planck's law and characterized by the Stefan-Boltzmann law for energy and the T<sup>3</sup> dependence for entropy, is the most probable state for the system.\n\n<<<\n**Mean Energy (U):** The equilibrium mean energy is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, U ∝ V T<sup>4</sup>, where V is the volume and T is the temperature. Specifically, U = (8π<sup>5</sup>k<sub>B</sub><sup>4</sup> / 15(hc)<sup>3</sup>) V T<sup>4</sup>.\n\n**Entropy (S):** The equilibrium entropy is S ∝ V T<sup>3</sup>. Specifically, S = (32π<sup>5</sup>k<sub>B</sub><sup>4</sup> / 45(hc)<sup>3</sup>) V T<sup>3</sup>.\n>>>"
