    "To determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, we can use the established framework of algebraic groups over finite fields.\n\n### Theoretical Foundation\n\nLet $G$ be a reductive group defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ are classified up to conjugacy by the Galois cohomology set $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, N(T_0))$, where $N(T_0)$ is the normalizer of an $\\mathbb{F}_q$-split maximal torus $T_0$. For a finite field, this simplifies nicely.\n\nA key result states that the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is given by the ratio of the order of the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $G$ to the order of the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of the normalizer of a split maximal torus.\n\nThe Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms, which implies that any group of type $E_8$ over a finite field is the split form. Therefore, we are dealing with the split group $G = E_8(q)$.\n\nThe formula for the number of tori is:\nNumber of tori = $\\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N(T_0)(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}$\n\nHere:\n*   $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the finite group of Lie type $E_8(q)$.\n*   $T_0$ is a split maximal torus.\n*   $N(T_0)(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-points of the normalizer of $T_0$.\n\n### Calculating the Components\n\n1.  **The Denominator: Order of the Normalizer**\n\n    The normalizer $N(T_0)$ fits into a short exact sequence of algebraic groups:\n    $1 \\to T_0 \\to N(T_0) \\to W \\to 1$\n    where $W = N(T_0)/T_0$ is the Weyl group of $E_8$. Taking $\\mathbb{F}_q$-points and applying Galois cohomology, we get the exact sequence:\n    $1 \\to T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q) \\to N(T_0)(\\mathbb{F}_q) \\to W(\\mathbb{F}_q) \\to H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, T_0)$\n\n    For a split torus $T_0$, by Lang's theorem, the cohomology group $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, T_0)$ is trivial. As the group $G$ is split, the Frobenius action on the Weyl group $W$ is trivial, meaning $W(\\mathbb{F}_q) = W$. The sequence is therefore short exact and splits, which gives:\n    $|N(T_0)(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = |T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |W|$\n\n    *   **Order of the Split Torus, $|T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$**: The rank of $E_8$ is 8. A split torus of rank 8 over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{F}_q^\\times)^8$. Thus, its order is $|T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = (q-1)^8$.\n    *   **Order of the Weyl Group, $|W|$**: The Weyl group of $E_8$ is a specific finite group, and its order is a well-known constant: $|W(E_8)| = 696,729,600$.\n\n    Combining these, the order of the normalizer is:\n    $|N(T_0)(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = 696,729,600 \\cdot (q-1)^8$\n\n2.  **The Numerator: Order of the Group $E_8(q)$**\n\n    The order of the finite simple group of Lie type $E_8(q)$ is given by a standard formula involving a polynomial in $q$. The degrees of the fundamental invariants for $E_8$ are 2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, and 30. The order of the group is:\n    $|E_8(q)| = q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)$.\n    The exponent 120 is the number of positive roots in the $E_8$ root system.\n\n### The Exact Number of Tori\n\nBy dividing the order of the group by the order of the normalizer, we find the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori.\n\n<<<The exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\frac{q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{696,729,600 \\cdot (q-1)^8} $$\nThis expression can be expanded by factoring each $(q^d-1)$ term, but this is the most compact exact form. It is worth noting that while the total number of tori is given by this large rational expression in $q$, the number of *conjugacy classes* of such tori is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$, which is 112."
