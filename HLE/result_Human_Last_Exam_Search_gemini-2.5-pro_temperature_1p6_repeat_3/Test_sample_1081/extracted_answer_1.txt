The exact number of $\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula:
$$ \frac{q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{696,729,600 \cdot (q-1)^8} $$
This expression can be expanded by factoring each $(q^d-1)$ term, but this is the most compact exact form. It is worth noting that while the total number of tori is given by this large rational expression in $q$, the number of *conjugacy classes* of such tori is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$, which is 112.
