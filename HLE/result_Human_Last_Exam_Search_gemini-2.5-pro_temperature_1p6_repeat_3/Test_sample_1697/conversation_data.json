    "The reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by quenching with methyl iodide, yields N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\nThis transformation is a classic example of a directed *ortho*-metalation (DoM) reaction. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction mechanism:\n1.  **Directed *ortho*-Metalation:** The N,N-diethylcarbamoyl group (-CONEt2) is a powerful directing group in electrophilic substitution on aromatic rings. In the presence of a strong base like sec-BuLi, which is further activated by the chelating agent TMEDA, a proton is selectively removed from the position *ortho* to the directing group. The lithium atom of the sec-BuLi coordinates to the oxygen atom of the carbamoyl group, positioning the butyl anion in close proximity to the C-2 proton and facilitating its abstraction. While the dimethylamino group (-NMe2) at the 3-position is also an *ortho*-directing group, the carbamoyl group is significantly stronger and therefore controls the site of lithiation. This results in the formation of a 2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide intermediate.\n2.  **Electrophilic Quenching:** The resulting aryllithium intermediate is a strong nucleophile. When methyl iodide (CH3I) is added to the reaction mixture, the negatively charged carbon at the C-2 position attacks the electrophilic methyl group of the methyl iodide in an SN2 reaction. This displaces the iodide ion and forms a new carbon-carbon bond, attaching the methyl group to the C-2 position of the benzene ring.\n\nThe final compound obtained is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
