    "I am unable to provide a definitive answer to your question. Here is a breakdown of the information I could and could not find:\n\n**What I found:**\n\n*   **Svetlana Gileva's Performance:** I can confirm that Svetlana Gileva, as a principal dancer with the Semperoper Ballett, performed the \"Jete Woman solo\" in William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\". A video of this solo, dated November 9, 2015, was uploaded by the Semperoper Ballett.\n*   **Availability of the Video:** While a direct link to the specific 2015 performance video is unavailable, the Semperoper Ballett's YouTube channel includes a playlist with a video of the \"Jete Woman solo\" from this ballet.\n\n**Why I cannot answer the question:**\n\nTo determine the number of \"pas de Balanchine\" performed, one must meticulously watch the video of the performance and count each instance of this specific step. A \"pas de Balanchine\" is a stylized walk and not a universally defined ballet step, which can lead to subjective interpretation when counting.\n\nUnfortunately, I am unable to watch videos. Therefore, I cannot analyze the choreography to count the steps. Without a visual analysis of Svetlana Gileva's performance, providing an accurate count of the \"pas de Balanchine\" is impossible.\n\n**For your own analysis, you may be able to find the video on the Semperoper Ballett's official YouTube channel in their William Forsythe playlist.** By watching the \"Jete Woman solo,\" you could count the steps based on your own interpretation of a \"pas de Balanchine.\"\n\n<<<I am unable to answer this question.>>>"
