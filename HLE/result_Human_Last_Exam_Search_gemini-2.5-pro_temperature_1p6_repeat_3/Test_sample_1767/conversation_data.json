    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the resulting combined system is 2.\n\nThe Chern number is a topological invariant that is additive. When two systems are brought together to form a composite system, their individual Chern numbers sum up to give the total Chern number of the combined entity. In this specific scenario, with each Chern insulator having a Chern number (C) of 1, the total Chern number of the junction is calculated as follows:\n\nC_total = C_insulator1 + C_insulator2 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nThis principle of additivity is a fundamental aspect of the mathematics of Chern classes, which are the underlying framework for Chern numbers.\n\nIt's important to note that the behavior at the interface, or junction, between the two insulators is also of interest. The number of protected chiral edge states at the boundary between two topological regions is determined by the difference in their Chern numbers. In this case, since both insulators have the same Chern number (C=1), the difference is |1 - 1| = 0. This implies that there will be no net flow of topologically protected chiral edge states along the junction itself. However, the overall, or bulk, Chern number of the entire system considered as a whole is indeed the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\n<<<2>>>"
