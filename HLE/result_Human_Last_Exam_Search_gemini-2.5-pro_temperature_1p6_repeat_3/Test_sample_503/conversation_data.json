    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, when viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, corresponds to a Galois connection between the underlying posets. The objects $$ and $$ in $\\Delta$ are the finite totally ordered sets $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$ and $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, respectively. An internal adjunction between them consists of a pair of order-preserving maps, $f: \\to$ and $g: \\to$, satisfying the conditions $id_{} \\le g \\circ f$ and $f \\circ g \\le id_{}$.\n\nThis pair of conditions is equivalent to the definition of a (monotone) Galois connection between the posets $(, \\le)$ and $(, \\le)$. For such a connection, the map $f$ is called the left adjoint and $g$ is the right adjoint. An adjunction is uniquely determined by either its left or right adjoint. Therefore, the number of adjunctions is equal to the number of possible left adjoint maps from $$ to $$, which is also equal to the number of possible right adjoint maps from $$ to $$.\n\nA map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ between finite total orders is a left adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and preserves all suprema (joins). For a map between total orders, being order-preserving is sufficient to preserve suprema of most subsets. However, for a map to be a left adjoint, the upper adjoint $g(j) = \\max\\{i \\in [m] \\mid f(i) \\le j\\}$ must be well-defined for all $j \\in [n]$. This requires that the set $\\{i \\in [m] \\mid f(i) \\le j\\}$ is non-empty for all $j \\in [n]$. This condition simplifies to $f(0)=0$.\n\nSymmetrically, a map $g: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and preserves all infima (meets). This holds if and only if its left adjoint $f(i) = \\min\\{j \\in [n] \\mid i \\le g(j)\\}$ is well-defined for all $i \\in [m]$. This requires that the set $\\{j \\in [n] \\mid i \\le g(j)\\}$ is non-empty for all $i \\in [m]$. This condition simplifies to $g(n)=m$.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ such that $f(0)=0$.\nAn order-preserving map from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is a non-decreasing sequence of $m+1$ elements chosen from $[n]$. The number of such maps is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{n+m+1}{m+1}$.\nIn our case, we are counting order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ with the constraint $f(0)=0$. This means we need to determine the non-decreasing sequence $f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(23)$ such that $0 \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$. This is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps from the 23-element set $\\{1, \\dots, 23\\}$ to the 38-element set $\\{0, \\dots, 37\\}$. Using the stars and bars formula for multiset coefficients, the number of such maps is $\\binom{(37-0+1) + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can count the number of right adjoints $g: \\to$. These are the order-preserving maps satisfying $g(37)=23$. This requires choosing a non-decreasing sequence $g(0), \\dots, g(36)$ from the set $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$. This is equivalent to counting order-preserving maps from a 37-element set to a 24-element set. The number of such maps is $\\binom{(23-0+1) + 37 - 1}{37} = \\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\nSince $\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{37}$, both methods yield the same result. The number is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!(60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!} = 42,393,334,755,528,736$\n\n<<<42393334755528736>>>"
