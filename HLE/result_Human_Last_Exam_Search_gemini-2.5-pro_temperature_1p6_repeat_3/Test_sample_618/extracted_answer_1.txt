The Lie group of infinitesimal transformations is generated by, at minimum, the vector fields `∂_t`, `∂_x`, and `2t∂_t + x∂_x`. The general representation of the transformation on the coordinate `x` is the affine transformation `x' = ax + b`, where `a` and `b` are group parameters. Specifically, the transformation can be written as `x'(λ) = x(0) * exp(c_A λ) + (c_B/c_A)(exp(c_A λ) - 1)` where `c_A` and `c_B` are constants defining the specific generator and `λ` is the group parameter.
