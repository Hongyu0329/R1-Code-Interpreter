    "In a 100BB rake-free cash game, the worst suited jack to open from the button with a 2.5x raise is generally considered to be J2s, as it is the weakest hand in that category that might still be included in a game-theory optimal (GTO) opening range.\n\nOpening ranges from the button are the widest of any position in poker due to the positional advantage of acting last on all subsequent streets. In a rake-free environment, this advantage is even more pronounced, encouraging a wider range of opening hands.\n\nA standard button opening range in a 100bb cash game can be as wide as 50-60% of all hands. This often includes all suited jacks. However, as you get to the bottom of this range, the profitability of opening becomes marginal. Hands like the low suited Jacks are included because of their ability to make flushes and occasional straight draws, providing them with playability post-flop.\n\nWhile there can be subtle differences between GTO solvers and specific table dynamics, J2s represents the absolute bottom of the suited Jack holdings. It has the least potential to make straights compared to other suited jacks and its high card value is minimal. Some sources suggest that hands down to J6s are standard opens, implying anything lower is increasingly marginal. Another source discusses playing low suited Jacks from the button, including the entire range from J8s down to J2s, but notes their weakness. Given that suited hands are ranked by their highest card and then their lowest, J2s is definitionally the weakest of the suited Jacks. Therefore, it is the least profitable, or \"worst,\" suited Jack to open.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
