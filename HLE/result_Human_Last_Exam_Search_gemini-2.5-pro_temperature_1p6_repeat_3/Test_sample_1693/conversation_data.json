    "## French Tanker \"Monique\" Was Largest Ship Sunk by U-Boat Before 1940 Armistice\n\nThe largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a German U-boat before the Franco-German Armistice of June 22, 1940, was the steam tanker **Monique**. The 7,011 gross register ton (GRT) vessel was torpedoed and sunk by the U-65 in the Bay of Biscay on the very day the armistice was signed.\n\nThe attack on the *Monique* occurred at 18:04 German time on June 22, 1940. The armistice agreement was signed later that evening at 18:36 in Compiègne, France, and came into effect at midnight on June 25, 1940. This places the sinking squarely within the final hours of hostilities at sea between France and Germany in that period.\n\nThe *Monique*, owned by the Compagnie Auxiliaire de Navigation, was en route from Haifa to Le Havre carrying a cargo of 10,000 tons of crude oil. The U-65, commanded by Kapitänleutnant Hans-Gerrit von Stockhausen, reported sinking an unescorted tanker which is believed to be the *Monique*.\n\nOther French naval losses in the weeks leading up to the armistice were either smaller in size or caused by other means. For instance, the submarine *Doris*, sunk by U-9 in May 1940, had a submerged displacement of only 765 tons. The destroyer *Jaguar*, with a standard displacement of 2,126 tons, was sunk on May 23, 1940, but by German E-boats (motor torpedo boats), not a U-boat. On the same day, the destroyer *Orage*, with a full load displacement of 1,825 tons, was sunk by German aircraft.\n\n<<<Monique>>>"
