    "To determine the probability that a particle in a one-dimensional box is located in a specific interval, we must integrate the probability density function over that interval.\n\nThe normalized wave function for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' is given by:\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)\n\nFor the n=2 state, the wave function is:\nψ2(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)\n\nThe probability density, |ψn(x)|², for n=2 is:\nP(x) = |ψ2(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a is found by the integral:\nProb = ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.⁵⁰⁵ₐ (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we use the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ)) / 2. Here, θ = 2πx / a, which makes 2θ = 4πx / a.\n\nSubstituting this into the integral gives:\nProb = (2/a) ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.⁵⁰⁵ₐ (1/2) * [1 - cos(4πx / a)] dx\nProb = (1/a) * [x - (a / 4π) * sin(4πx / a)] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a.\n\nBecause the interval Δx = 0.01a is very small and centered around a node at x = a/2 (where the probability is zero for n=2), a more precise calculation is necessary.\n\nWe can approximate the integral by considering the behavior of the sine function near the node. Let x = a/2 + δ, where δ is small. The argument of the squared sine function is 2π(a/2 + δ)/a = π + 2πδ/a. Since sin(π + y) = -sin(y), sin²(π + y) = sin²(y). For small y, sin(y) ≈ y.\n\nThe integral can be approximated as:\nProb ≈ ∫₋₀.₀₀₅ₐ⁺₀.₀₀₅ₐ (2/a) * sin²(2πδ/a) dδ\nProb ≈ ∫₋₀.₀₀₅ₐ⁺₀.₀₀₅ₐ (2/a) * (2πδ/a)² dδ\nProb ≈ (8π²/a³) ∫₋₀.₀₀₅ₐ⁺₀.₀₀₅ₐ δ² dδ\nProb ≈ (8π²/a³) * [δ³/3] from -0.005a to 0.005a\nProb ≈ (8π²/3a³) * [(0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³]\nProb ≈ (16π²/3a³) * (0.005a)³\nProb ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\nProb ≈ (16 * (3.14159)²) / 3 * (0.000000125)\nProb ≈ (16 * 9.8696) / 3 * 0.000000125\nProb ≈ 52.6379 * 0.000000125\nProb ≈ 0.00000658\n\nThe probability is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\n<<<0.00000658>>>"
