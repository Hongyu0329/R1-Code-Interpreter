    "While historical records confirm that the town of Bártfa (now Bardejov) had a system of annually elected judges in the 15th century, the specific name of the individual who held this office in the year 1461 is not readily available in the surveyed digital archives and historical summaries.\n\nBártfa was granted the status of a free royal town in 1376, which included the privilege of electing its own magistrate and town council. The town's administration is extensively documented in well-preserved archives. Notably, Mária Fedorčáková's comprehensive work, \"Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata. Správa mesta Bardejov v stredoveku (1320–1526)\" (Our City Called Bardejov. The Administration of the Town of Bardejov in the Middle Ages (1320–1526)), and Béla Iványi's archival collection, \"Bártfa szabad királyi város levéltára, 1319–1526\" (The Archives of the Free Royal Town of Bártfa, 1319–1526), are key resources on this topic.\n\nDespite the existence of these detailed historical records, a direct search of available online materials did not yield the name of the judge for the specific year of 1461. A document from that year does mention an invitation sent to the \"lay judges in Bártfa,\" confirming the presence of this judicial body, but it does not name the head judge. Access to the complete lists of magistrates within the aforementioned scholarly publications would likely be necessary to identify the judge of Bártfa for that particular year.\n\n**<<<I am unable to provide the name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461 based on the available information.>>>**"
