    "The initial search provides information about the n-queens problem on a toroidal board. A key finding is Pólya's theorem, which states that a solution for placing *n* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board exists if and only if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3. This applies to placing 5 queens on a 5x5 board, as 5 is not divisible by 2 or 3. However, the user's question is about placing *4* non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board.\n\nThe search results do not directly answer how many ways there are to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board. Most of the results focus on the *n* queens on an *n*x*n* board problem. There is a related problem mentioned called the \"queens domination problem\" which is about the minimum number of queens to attack every square, but this is different from the non-attacking queens problem.\n\nSince the initial search did not provide a direct answer, I need to find information specifically about placing *k* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board, where *k* is not necessarily equal to *n*. It is likely that a computational approach or a specific study of this variation of the problem is needed to find the answer.I have already performed a search and the results discuss the general n-queens problem on a toroidal board, particularly for the case where the number of queens equals the board size (n). The key takeaway is Pólya's theorem, which is not directly applicable here. The search did not provide a direct answer or a general formula for placing *k* queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board where *k* is not equal to *n*. Therefore, further searching with more specific queries is necessary.\nI will proceed with the original plan of performing another search.The second step of searching yielded more relevant information, but still no direct answer to the question of how many ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board.\n\nThe results confirm that placing *n* queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board is only possible if n is not divisible by 2 or 3, which is why 5 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board is a known problem with solutions. One source mentions that for a prime *p*, the number of toroidal solutions for *p* queens is *p*( *p* - 3). For a 5x5 board, this would be 5 * (5-3) = 10 solutions, which is also stated in another source.\n\nThe problem of placing *k* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* board is mentioned as a simpler question than the *n*-queens problem, and closed forms exist for k=2 and k=3, but not for the general case. One result provides a link to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) for the number of ways to place 5 non-attacking knights on an *n*x*n* toroidal board, suggesting that such sequences might exist for queens as well.\n\nA key difficulty is that the toroidal nature of the board changes the nature of diagonal attacks.\n\nSince a direct answer is still not found, and a general formula for *k* queens on an *n*x*n* torus seems unlikely to be readily available, the next logical step is to search for specific enumerations or computational results for small values of *k* and *n*. This might involve looking for research papers or databases that have pre-computed these values. It would be beneficial to search OEIS directly.\n\nI will update the plan to reflect this.The OEIS search was a good step. I found sequence A000170 which is the number of ways to place n non-attacking queens on a standard n x n board, and A002562 for the fundamental solutions. The search also brought up several related sequences and discussions, including the ménage problem (A000179) which is related to placing non-attacking rooks on a modified board. However, a direct OEIS sequence for the number of ways to place *k* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* **toroidal** board was not immediately found in the initial description of the search results.\n\nOne of the search results mentioned \"A corollary of this result is an upper bound on the number of placements of n non-attacking queens on an n × n toroidal chess board,\" which suggests that direct formulas or enumerations are not trivial.\n\nAnother search result pointed to a resource with \"New recurrence for bishops on an toroidal chessboard n x n if n is even...\". This indicates that specific enumerations for different pieces on toroidal boards are a subject of research and might not be readily available in a simple lookup.\n\nThe key information missing is a specific count or a method to calculate the count for 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board. Given the complexity of the problem, a direct search for the exact phrase is the most likely way to find a pre-computed answer if it exists.\n\nI will refine the next step to focus on a very specific search for the exact number, and if that fails, look for papers that might contain this specific result as part of a larger study.The previous search attempts did not yield a direct numerical answer to the question. However, the search results provided significant context. It's clear that the problem of placing *k* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board is a complex combinatorial problem. While the case of *n* queens on an *n*x*n* board is well-studied (with solutions existing only if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3), the general case for *k* queens is not as straightforward.\n\nI found OEIS sequence A342372 which gives the number of ways of arranging *k* nonattacking *semi-queens* on an *n*x*n* toroidal board. A semi-queen's movement is restricted to rows, columns, and one set of diagonals. This is very close to the problem at hand, but not identical. The search also revealed OEIS sequence A054502, which is a \"counting sequence for classification of nonattacking queens on n X n toroidal board,\" but it's not immediately clear how to use this to find the specific number for 4 queens on a 5x5 board.\n\nOne search result referenced a book by Vaclav Kotesovec, \"Non-attacking chess pieces,\" which appears to be a comprehensive resource on such problems and includes a chapter on \"k Knights on an n x n toroidal chessboard\". This suggests that the answer for queens might also be in this or a similar publication.\n\nGiven that a simple lookup is not providing the answer, and the complexity of the problem, it is highly likely the solution requires either a dedicated computational search or is located within a specialized text on combinatorial chess problems. Since I cannot perform a computational search, the most promising route is to look for a direct mention of the result in a more specific search or a comprehensive resource.I have already performed a detailed search and established that a simple numerical answer is not readily available through general queries or standard OEIS searches. The problem is complex, and the solution is likely to be found in specialized literature or requires a dedicated computational search, which I cannot perform. I have gathered enough information to conclude that a direct answer cannot be found with the available tools. Therefore, I will now formulate the final answer based on the information I have.\n\nThere is no readily available direct answer in the initial search results for the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. The search results primarily focus on the n-queens problem, where the number of queens is equal to the board size. While there is a theorem by Pólya stating that *n* non-attacking queens can be placed on an *n*x*n* toroidal board if and only if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3, this does not directly apply to the case of 4 queens on a 5x5 board.\n\nThe problem of placing *k* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* board is a more general and complex combinatorial problem. The wrapping-around nature of the toroidal board significantly alters the diagonal attack patterns, making the calculation non-trivial. Resources like the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) contain sequences for many chess-related combinatorial problems, but a specific sequence for this exact problem was not immediately found in the initial searches. Problems of this nature often require either a brute-force computational search or are detailed in specialized mathematical literature on combinatorial game theory or chess mathematics.\n\nGiven the lack of a simple formula or a direct mention in the searched resources, a definitive number of ways cannot be provided without further in-depth computational analysis or consultation of specialized publications.\n\n"
