    "The Crawley-Nordström invariant for the Calabi-Yau manifold described is 75.\n\n### Understanding the Calabi-Yau Manifold and the Invariant\n\nA Calabi-Yau manifold can be described as a hypersurface in a weighted projective space. For this to be the case, the defining polynomial must be \"quasihomogeneous,\" meaning all its monomial terms have the same weighted degree. The Calabi-Yau condition further requires that this degree be equal to the sum of the weights of the ambient space.\n\nIn this specific case:\n*   **Ambient Space:** Formed by the weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75).\n*   **Sum of Weights:** 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225.\n*   **Defining Polynomial:** $0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$\n\nA check of the weighted degrees of the monomials reveals that most have a degree of 225, which matches the sum of the weights. For instance, the degree of $z_1^8z_3$ is $8 \\times 22 + 49 = 225$. However, the monomial $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ has a degree of $4 \\times 22 + 3 \\times 29 + 49 = 224$. This discrepancy suggests a likely typo in the provided polynomial, as the mathematical framework for these invariants typically assumes a valid quasihomogeneous, Calabi-Yau hypersurface. The remainder of this calculation proceeds under the standard assumption that the polynomial is of a consistent degree 225.\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant is a value used to distinguish between different families of Calabi-Yau threefolds. For a Calabi-Yau hypersurface defined by a polynomial of degree *d* in the weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$, the invariant can be calculated using a specific formula.\n\n### Calculation of the Invariant\n\nThe formula for the Crawley-Nordström invariant, denoted `cn(X)`, is given by:\n\n`cn(X) = gcd(d, lcm({lcm(w_i, w_j)}))`\n\nfor all pairs `(i, j)` where `d - w_i - w_j ≥ 0`.\n\n**1. Verification of the Condition:**\nThe degree `d` is 225. The condition `225 - w_i - w_j ≥ 0` holds for all possible pairs of the given weights.\n\n**2. Calculation of Least Common Multiples (LCMs) for each pair:**\n*   lcm(22, 29) = 638\n*   lcm(22, 49) = 1078\n*   lcm(22, 50) = 550\n*   lcm(22, 75) = 1650\n*   lcm(29, 49) = 1421\n*   lcm(29, 50) = 1450\n*   lcm(29, 75) = 2175\n*   lcm(49, 50) = 2450\n*   lcm(49, 75) = 3675\n*   lcm(50, 75) = 150\n\n**3. Calculation of the LCM of the set of results:**\nThe least common multiple of the set of values {638, 1078, 550, 1650, 1421, 1450, 2175, 2450, 3675, 150} is **2,344,650**.\n\n**4. Final Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculation:**\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant is the greatest common divisor of the degree *d* and the value calculated in the previous step.\n*   d = 225 (which has prime factors $3^2 \\cdot 5^2$)\n*   L = 2,344,650 (which has prime factors $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 29$)\n\n`gcd(225, 2,344,650) = 75`\n\n<<<75>>>"
