    "There is no evidence that Albert Einstein cited any specific lectures in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\nAn examination of Einstein's four groundbreaking papers from his \"miracle year\" reveals a notable lack of citations, which was not uncommon for theoretical physics papers at the time. His paper on special relativity, for example, contained no references at all.\n\nEinstein's work on Brownian motion was founded on the molecular-kinetic theory of heat. However, historical accounts suggest that he developed his own framework of statistical mechanics, and was reportedly unaware of some contemporary research in the field, such as the work of Ludwig Boltzmann. A direct review of the 1905 Brownian motion paper published in *Annalen der Physik* shows no footnotes or bibliography citing any lectures or other scientists' work.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures in his 1905 publication on Brownian motion.\n\n<<<There is no evidence that Albert Einstein cited lectures in his 1905 Brownian motion paper."
