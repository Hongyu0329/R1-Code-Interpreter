    "### Without Norse Influence, \"Sister\" Would Likely Be \"Suster\"\n\nIf the Norse had never interacted with the Anglo-Saxons, the Modern English word for a female sibling would most likely be *suster*, pronounced to rhyme with \"duster.\" This is based on the linguistic evolution of the original Old English word, which was superseded by a Scandinavian-influenced alternative.\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" owes its current form to the influence of Old Norse. The original Old English word for a female sibling was *sweostor* or, in some forms, *swuster*. Both the Old English word and the Old Norse word, *systir*, descended from the same Proto-Germanic root, *swestēr*.\n\nDuring the Middle English period, the native Anglo-Saxon word *sweostor* naturally evolved into *suster*. However, due to the significant presence of Old Norse speakers in parts of England (the Danelaw), their word *systir* began to influence the English vocabulary. This resulted in a \"contamination\" where the Old Norse vowel sound, represented by the \"i\", replaced the native vowel sound represented by \"u\". The form with \"i\" eventually became the standard in English.\n\nHad this Norse influence never occurred, the word *suster* would have continued its natural development into Modern English. The short \"u\" sound in Middle English *suster* (pronounced like the \"u\" in \"put\") would have likely evolved into the /ʌ/ vowel sound, which is heard in words like \"cup\" and \"run\". This would result in a word spelled *suster* with a pronunciation similar to \"duster\" or \"buster\".\n\n<<<suster>>>"
