    "Here is the step-by-step solution to find the next number in the sequence.\n\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between consecutive terms to find the pattern.\n\n1.  **Look for a simple difference:**\n    *   11 - 2 = 9\n    *   23 - 11 = 12\n    *   51 - 23 = 28\n    *   119 - 51 = 68\n    The differences (9, 12, 28, 68) do not show a simple arithmetic pattern.\n\n2.  **Look for a multiplication or combination pattern:**\n    Let's test the relationship `Next Term = (Previous Term × 2) + a constant`.\n    *   For the term 23: 11 × 2 = 22. To get 23, we add 1. So, `23 = 11 × 2 + 1`.\n    *   For the term 51: 23 × 2 = 46. To get 51, we add 5. So, `51 = 23 × 2 + 5`.\n    *   For the term 119: 51 × 2 = 102. To get 119, we add 17. So, `119 = 51 × 2 + 17`.\n\n3.  **Identify the pattern in the added numbers:**\n    The pattern for generating a term (starting from the third term) is: `Term(n) = Term(n-1) × 2 + C`.\n    The numbers added (`C`) are 1, 5, and 17. Let's find the pattern within this new sequence.\n    *   The added numbers are: 1, 5, 17.\n\n4.  **Find the pattern in the sequence of added numbers (1, 5, 17):**\n    *   Let's find the difference between these numbers:\n        *   5 - 1 = 4\n        *   17 - 5 = 12\n    *   The differences are 4 and 12. We can see a clear pattern here: each difference is three times the previous one (4 × 3 = 12).\n    *   Following this pattern, the next difference should be 12 × 3 = 36.\n\n5.  **Calculate the next number to be added:**\n    *   The last number added was 17. The next number to add will be 17 + 36 = 53.\n\n6.  **Calculate the next term in the original sequence:**\n    *   The last term in the sequence is 119. Following the main pattern, the next term will be `(119 × 2) + 53`.\n    *   119 × 2 = 238.\n    *   238 + 53 = 291.\n\nTherefore, the number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
