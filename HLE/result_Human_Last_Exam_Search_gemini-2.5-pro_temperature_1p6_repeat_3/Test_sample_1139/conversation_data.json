    "For disordered systems of symmetry class D, the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model with N replicas is described by the Riemannian symmetric space SO(2N)/U(N). The number of non-Grassman variables needed to parametrize this space is equal to its dimension.\n\nFor the case of two replicas (N=2), the specific symmetric space is SO(4)/U(2). To find the number of parameters, we calculate the dimension of this manifold, which is the difference between the dimensions of the respective Lie groups:\n\nDimension(SO(4)/U(2)) = Dimension(SO(4)) - Dimension(U(2))\n\nThe dimension of the special orthogonal group SO(n) is given by the formula n(n-1)/2.\nFor SO(4), the dimension is:\nDimension(SO(4)) = 4 * (4 - 1) / 2 = 6.\n\nThe dimension of the unitary group U(n) is n².\nFor U(2), the dimension is:\nDimension(U(2)) = 2² = 4.\n\nTherefore, the number of non-Grassman variables is:\nNumber of variables = 6 - 4 = 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
