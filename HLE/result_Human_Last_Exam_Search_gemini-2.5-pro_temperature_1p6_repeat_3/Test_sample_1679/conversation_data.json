    "**\"An American in Paris,\" the 1951 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, is the first film to hold that honor while also featuring a depiction of a Luxor Obelisk.** The iconic Parisian landmark is showcased during the film's celebrated and lengthy ballet sequence.\n\nThe film, known for its vibrant and artistic presentation of the French capital, includes an elaborate 17-minute ballet finale. Within this sequence, the set design pays homage to various French painters. Specifically, the scenery for a dance number is modeled after the Place de la Concorde in the style of artist Raoul Dufy.\n\nMultiple sources confirm that the fountains of the Place de la Concorde are a central feature of this part of the ballet. In fact, a model of the Place de la Concorde fountain used in the production is now part of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History collection. Furthermore, early script details for the film indicated a visual tour of Parisian landmarks, explicitly mentioning the Place de la Concorde alongside the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Élysées.\n\nWhile other Best Picture winners were filmed in or featured international locations, \"An American in Paris\" is the earliest winner for which there is clear evidence of the Luxor Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde being depicted on-screen.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
