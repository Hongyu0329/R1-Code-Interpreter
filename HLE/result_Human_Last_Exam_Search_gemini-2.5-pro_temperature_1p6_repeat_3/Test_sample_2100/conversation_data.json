    "The man Andrei Voznesensky called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" was Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. The question, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" was answered in the latter part of the 20th century, culminating in a symbolic reunification of his story with that of his beloved.\n\nNikolai Rezanov was a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and one of the founders of the Russian-American Company, which played a significant role in the history of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest. His story is one of romance and tragedy, which became the inspiration for the popular Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" with poetry by Andrei Voznesensky. The opera, which premiered in 1981, tells the story of Rezanov's love for Concepci처n Arg체ello, the daughter of the commandant of San Francisco.\n\nVoznesensky also wrote a book-length poem about their romance titled \"Story Under Full Sail.\". In this work, he poetically reflects on Rezanov's life and his ultimate fate.\n\nRezanov died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, on March 8, 1807, while on his way back to St. Petersburg. His original grave was destroyed by the Bolsheviks. The great interest generated by the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" in the 1980s led to a renewed focus on Rezanov's life and the question of his final resting place. This culminated in the establishment of a new memorial on his presumed burial site in the Trinity Cemetery in Krasnoyarsk in October 2000. In a symbolic gesture, soil from Concepci처n Arg체ello's grave in Benicia, California, was scattered on Rezanov's tomb, and a rose from her burial site was also placed there.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
