The analysis of your three sialylated glycan isomers—A2G(4)2S(3)2, A2G(4)S(3)S(6), and A2G(4)2S(6)2—by LC-MS after the specified chemical treatment and permethylation will result in three distinct masses.

While the glycans are isomers, the derivatization procedure you used is linkage-specific, meaning it reacts differently depending on how the sialic acids are attached. This difference in reaction creates a mass difference between the final products. Here is the breakdown of the expected chemistry:

*   **α-2,3-linked sialic acids:** Under the conditions described (DMT-MM at 60°C for an extended period), these preferentially undergo an intramolecular reaction to form a stable lactone. During the subsequent permethylation step, this lactone is converted to a methyl ester.
