The quantum correction to the conductivity (Δσ) for an electron in a bulk semiconductor is given by the expression:

**Δσ ≈ - (e^2 / (π * h)) * (1/L_φ)**

where:
*   `e` is the elementary charge.
*   `h` is the reduced Planck constant.
*   `L_φ` is the phase coherence length.

The phase coherence length `L_φ` is a function of temperature and is determined by the dominant inelastic scattering mechanism in the semiconductor.
