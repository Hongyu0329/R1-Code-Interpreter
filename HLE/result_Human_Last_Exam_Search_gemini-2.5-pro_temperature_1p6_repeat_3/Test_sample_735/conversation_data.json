    "There are 12 finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called product-free if for all *a, b* in *S*, the product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion (or locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in *G*.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 3 was completed by Chimere Stanley Anabanti and Sarah Hart. They proved that if a finite group *G* contains a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3, then the order of *G* is at most 24. Their work provides a complete list of these groups.\n\nThe 12 finite groups are:\n*   **C_6** (Cyclic group of order 6)\n*   **D_6** (Dihedral group of order 6, isomorphic to S_3, the symmetric group on 3 elements)\n*   **C_7** (Cyclic group of order 7)\n*   **C_8** (Cyclic group of order 8)\n*   **D_8** (Dihedral group of order 8)\n*   **Q_8** (Quaternion group of order 8)\n*   **C_9** (Cyclic group of order 9)\n*   **C_10** (Cyclic group of order 10)\n*   **D_10** (Dihedral group of order 10)\n*   **C_12** (Cyclic group of order 12)\n*   **A_4** (Alternating group on 4 elements)\n*   **The dicyclic group of order 12** (also known as the generalized quaternion group Q_12)\n\nThese groups are identified in the comprehensive classification provided in the paper \"Locally Maximal Product-free Sets of Size 3\" by Anabanti and Hart.\n\n<<<12>>>"
