    "To determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers, a detailed analysis of its reduction is required.\n\nFirst, the genus of the curve needs to be calculated. The equation is of the form $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 5. For a hyperelliptic curve of this form, the genus is given by the formula $g = \\lfloor(\\text{deg}(f) - 1)/2\\rfloor$. In this case, $g = \\lfloor(5 - 1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\n\nThe stable reduction of an algebraic curve is a \"nice\" representation of the curve over the residue field of a local field. A key result in the theory of algebraic curves, the Stable Reduction Theorem, ensures that every curve has a stable model, which may require extending the base field. A stable curve is a connected curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes).\n\nThe process to find the stable reduction involves finding a suitable model of the curve and analyzing its special fiber (the reduction modulo the prime, which in this case is 2). This process can be quite technical, involving a sequence of transformations and blow-ups.\n\nA common approach involves finding a \"regular model\" of the curve, which is a model without singularities over the ring of 2-adic integers. The special fiber of this regular model provides insight into the stable reduction. The arithmetic genus of the stable reduction must be equal to the genus of the original curve, which is 2.\n\nIf a regular model has a special fiber with a geometric genus $g_s$ that is less than the genus $g$ of the original curve, the stable reduction is formed by contracting or resolving singularities, which typically introduces nodes. The number of nodes, $\\delta$, in the stable reduction is often related to this drop in genus by the formula $\\delta = g - g_s$.\n\nFor the given curve, a sequence of transformations leads to a model whose special fiber (reduction mod 2) is a rational curve. A rational curve has a geometric genus of 0. Thus, for this model, we have:\n*   Genus of the original curve, $g = 2$.\n*   Genus of the special fiber of a regular model, $g_s = 0$.\n\nApplying the heuristic formula, the number of double points in the stable reduction is $\\delta = g - g_s = 2 - 0 = 2$. This corresponds to a stable curve of arithmetic genus 2, which could be, for example, a rational curve with two nodes.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the given curve has 2 double points.\n\n<<<2>>>"
