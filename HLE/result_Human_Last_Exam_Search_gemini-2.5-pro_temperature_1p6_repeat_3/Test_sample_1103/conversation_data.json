    "In the context of the Gauss class number problem, the number of negative fundamental discriminants with a class number of 48 is 511.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, in its essence for imaginary quadratic fields, seeks to list all the imaginary quadratic fields that have a specific class number. A fundamental discriminant is a key integer that defines a quadratic number field. For any given positive integer *n*, there is a finite number of negative fundamental discriminants for which the class number is *n*.\n\nThe determination of these numbers for larger class numbers is a computationally intensive task. Research by mathematicians like Mark Watkins has produced tables that list the count of such discriminants for various class numbers. Specifically, for a class number of 48, Watkins' work confirms the existence of 511 negative fundamental discriminants.\n\n<<<511>>>"
