    "The minimal grid number for a knot, also known as its arc index, is the smallest integer `n` for which the knot can be represented on an `n x n` grid. For an alternating knot, the minimal grid number is its crossing number plus two. The trefoil knot is the simplest non-trivial knot; it is an alternating knot with a minimal crossing number of 3. Therefore, its minimal grid number is 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nResearch has shown that nontrivial knots first appear on a 5x5 grid. For this grid size (GN=5), there are a total of 10 diagrams that form a trefoil knot (this includes both left-handed and right-handed versions).\n\nThe trefoil knot exists in two chiral forms: a right-handed and a left-handed version, which are mirror images of each other and are not equivalent. While the grid number is the same for a knot and its mirror image, the specific diagrams can be different. A study cataloging the minimal grid diagrams for the *right-handed* trefoil knot found that there are 6 such distinct diagrams, up to rotation and translation.\n\nGiven that there are 10 total minimal grid diagrams for the trefoil knot and 6 of them correspond to the right-handed version, the remaining diagrams must represent the left-handed trefoil knot.\n\nNumber of left-handed trefoil diagrams = Total diagrams - Right-handed diagrams\nNumber of left-handed trefoil diagrams = 10 - 6 = 4\n\nTherefore, there are 4 minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot, up to translation and rotation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
