    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor** in the nuclear criticality community and related fields like condensed matter physics and neutron scattering. It is often denoted as S(q, ω), where q is the wavevector (the Fourier variable corresponding to space) and ω is the frequency (the Fourier variable corresponding to time).\n\nThe relationship between the generalized pair correlation function, G(r, t), and the dynamic structure factor, S(q, ω), is given by the following double Fourier transform equation:\n\nS(q, ω) = (1 / 2π) ∫∫ G(r, t) *e*<sup>-i(q·r - ωt)</sup> dr dt\n\nIn essence, the dynamic structure factor provides information about the collective motions and correlations of particles in a system as a function of both momentum transfer (related to q) and energy transfer (related to ω). This is a crucial quantity in the analysis of inelastic scattering experiments, such as those involving neutrons, which are used to study the microscopic dynamics of materials relevant to nuclear systems. While sometimes referred to more generally as the scattering function, the most specific and widely recognized term is the dynamic structure factor.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
