    "The two Nobel laureates featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron with the tagline \"Ask Why\" were physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Amartya Sen.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign, launched in 2000, was a significant marketing effort by Enron to portray itself as an innovative and forward-thinking company. The commercials featured several notable figures, including Nobel laureates, to enhance the company's image of intellectual and business prowess.\n\nOne of the confirmed participants in these commercials was Murray Gell-Mann, a distinguished physicist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles. His appearance in the ad lent a veneer of scientific credibility to Enron's complex and, as later revealed, fraudulent business practices.\n\nThe other Nobel laureate featured in the campaign was Amartya Sen, an eminent Indian economist and philosopher. Sen was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998 for his contributions to welfare economics. His involvement, like Gell-Mann's, was part of Enron's broader strategy to align itself with respected intellectuals, thereby masking the unethical financial schemes that led to its eventual collapse. While discussions around Sen's involvement have been noted, his appearance was part of the same campaign aimed at boosting Enron's public perception.\n\nThe use of these respected figures in its advertising is now seen as a cynical and infamous chapter in the Enron scandal, highlighting the disconnect between the company's public image and its internal corruption.\n\n<<<**Murray Gell-Mann** and **Amartya Sen**>>>"
