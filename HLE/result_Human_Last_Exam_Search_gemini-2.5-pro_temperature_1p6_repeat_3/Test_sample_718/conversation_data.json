    "A tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ from an upper semilattice $J$ to the category of $K$-vector spaces is **1-resolvable**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **Functors and Modules:** The category of functors from a poset $J$ to the category of vector spaces, $\\text{Vect}_K$, is equivalent to the category of modules over the *incidence algebra* (or *path algebra*) $KJ$. This equivalence allows translating questions about functors into the language of module theory and homological algebra.\n\n*   **Resolvability and Projective Dimension:** In this context, a functor being \"$n$-resolvable\" means that it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. The minimum such $n$ for all functors in the category is determined by the global dimension of the associated incidence algebra $KJ$.\n\n*   **The Role of the Upper Semilattice:** A key result in the representation theory of posets is that if $J$ is a finite upper semilattice, its incidence algebra $KJ$ is a *hereditary algebra*. An algebra is hereditary if its global dimension is at most 1. This implies that every module over $KJ$ (and therefore every functor from $J$ to $\\text{Vect}_K$) has a projective resolution of length at most 1.\n\n*   **The \"Tame\" Condition:** A functor is called tame if it is determined by its values on a finite sub-poset. When the indexing category $J$ is an upper semilattice, a tame functor can be discretised by a finite sub-poset that is also an upper semilattice. This means the homological properties of the tame functor are governed by a finite upper semilattice structure.\n\nTherefore, because the functor's behavior is dictated by a finite upper semilattice, the corresponding module is over a hereditary algebra of global dimension 1. This means the functor admits a projective resolution of length at most 1, making it 1-resolvable.\n\n<<<1>>>"
