The final expression for the magnetic field `H = H_x x̂ + H_z ẑ` is given by its components:

**x-component:**
`H_x(x, z) = - (mπ / (4D²)) * [sinh(2πx/D)sin(2πz/D)] / [sinh²(πx/D) + sin²(πz/D)]²`

**z-component:**
`H_z(x, z) = H_a + (mπ / (2D²)) * [sinh²(πx/D) - sin²(πz/D)] / [sinh²(πx/D) + sin²(πz/D)]²`

where the magnetic moment `m` per unit length is:
`m = -πμ₀w²(J_c d/π) [tanh(πH_a/(J_c d)) - (πH_a/(J_c d))sech²(πH_a/(J_c d))]`

Here, `2w` is the strip width, `d` is the thickness, `D` is the stacking interval, `J_c` is the critical current density, and `H_a` is the applied field. These expressions are valid for `|x| > w`.
