    "The most widely recognized and efficient method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) is through the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F2) gas. This synthesis is typically carried out by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine in a 1:5 molar ratio within a sealed nickel vessel. Nickel is used for the container because it forms a protective layer of nickel fluoride, which prevents corrosion from the highly reactive fluorine gas.\n\nThe reaction is exothermic and the conditions must be carefully controlled to obtain a pure product. According to multiple sources, the optimal temperature for this reaction is approximately 400°C. A temperature range of 350°C to 450°C is also cited as effective.\n\nWhile other synthesis methods exist, they are generally less efficient or produce significant impurities. For instance, using an electric discharge at low temperatures can produce XeF4, but it is often contaminated with xenon difluoride (XeF2). The chemical equilibrium between the different xenon fluorides (XeF2, XeF4, and XeF6) is sensitive to temperature and fluorine concentration. Lower temperatures tend to favor the formation of XeF2, while higher temperatures and an excess of fluorine favor XeF6. Therefore, 400°C represents a balance that allows for the efficient production of XeF4.\n\nComparing this information to the provided answer choices, 400°C is the coldest temperature listed at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently by the standard synthesis method.\n\n<<<B>>>"
