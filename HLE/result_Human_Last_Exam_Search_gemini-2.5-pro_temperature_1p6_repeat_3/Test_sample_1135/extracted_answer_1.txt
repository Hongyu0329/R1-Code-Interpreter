Therefore, in addition to the singly and doubly excited Slater determinants whose matrix elements are zeroed as part of the CCSD procedure, the matrix elements $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are also identically zero for all quintuply, sextuply, and higher-excited Slater determinants ($|\Phi_I\rangle = |\Phi_{ijklm}^{abcde}\rangle$, etc.). This is a direct consequence of the electronic Hamiltonian containing at most two-body interactions, which results in the CCSD similarity-transformed Hamiltonian being at most a four-body operator.
