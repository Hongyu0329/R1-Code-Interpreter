    "Following the rules of the cellular automaton Rule 110, starting from a single cell in state 1, and applying the rule 20 times results in the following binary pattern:\n\nRule 110 dictates the state of a cell in the next generation based on its current state and the state of its two immediate neighbors. The rule is named after the binary representation of 110, which is `01101110`. This binary string encodes the outcome for each of the eight possible three-cell neighborhoods. Specifically, the new state for the center cell is determined as follows: `111` becomes `0`, `110` becomes `1`, `101` becomes `1`, `100` becomes `0`, `011` becomes `1`, `010` becomes `1`, `001` becomes `1`, and `000` becomes `0`.\n\nApplying these rules for 20 successive generations starting with a single '1' surrounded by '0's produces a complex, asymmetric pattern, which is a characteristic of Rule 110's \"Class 4\" behavior, on the edge between order and chaos.\n\nHere is the evolution of the pattern for the first few steps:\n*   **Generation 0:** `1`\n*   **Generation 1:** `110`\n*   **Generation 2:** `11100`\n*   **Generation 3:** `1101000`\n*   **Generation 4:** `111110000`\n\nContinuing this process for 20 generations yields the final pattern.\n\n<<<11011101101111110100>>>"
