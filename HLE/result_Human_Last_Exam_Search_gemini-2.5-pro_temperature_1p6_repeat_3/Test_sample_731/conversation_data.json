    "A power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H that can be expressed as H = G<sup>k</sup> = {g<sup>k</sup> | g ∈ G} for some integer k. To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, SD<sub>512</sub>, we must identify all distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n\nThe semidihedral group SD<sub>2<sup>n</sup></sub> is defined by the presentation:\nSD<sub>2<sup>n</sup></sub> = <r, s | r<sup>2<sup>n-1</sup></sup> = s<sup>2</sup> = 1, srs = r<sup>2<sup>n-2</sup>-1</sup>>\n\nFor SD<sub>512</sub>, we have n=9, and the group is given by:\nSD<sub>512</sub> = <r, s | r<sup>256</sup> = s<sup>2</sup> = 1, srs = r<sup>127</sup>>\n\nThe analysis of the power subgroups G<sup>k</sup> depends on whether the integer k is odd or even.\n\n### Case 1: k is an odd integer\nWhen k is any odd integer, the set G<sup>k</sup> = {g<sup>k</sup> | g ∈ G} is equal to the group G itself. Every element of the group SD<sub>512</sub> can be expressed as the k-th power of some other element in the group. Thus, for any odd k (e.g., k=1, 3, 5, ...), the resulting power subgroup is always SD<sub>512</sub>. This gives one distinct power subgroup.\n\n### Case 2: k is an even integer\nWhen k is an even integer, the set G<sup>k</sup> consists only of powers of the generator r. Specifically, the power subgroup is given by the formula:\nG<sup>k</sup> = <r<sup>gcd(k, 256)</sup>>\n\nThis means the subgroup is cyclic and is generated by an element r<sup>d</sup>, where d is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of k and 256. To find the number of distinct subgroups in this case, we need to determine the possible values for d.\n\nSince k is even and 256 is a power of 2, their gcd must also be an even number. The divisors of 256 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256. The even divisors are:\n*   2\n*   4\n*   8\n*   16\n*   32\n*   64\n*   128\n*   256\n\nEach of these eight even divisors can be realized as the gcd for some even k. For example, gcd(2, 256) = 2, gcd(4, 256) = 4, and so on. This gives rise to eight distinct cyclic subgroups of <r>: <r<sup>2</sup>>, <r<sup>4</sup>>, <r<sup>8</sup>>, <r<sup>16</sup>>, <r<sup>32</sup>>, <r<sup>64</sup>>, <r<sup>128</sup>>, and <r<sup>256</sup>> (which is the trivial subgroup {1}). Note that the case k=0 also yields the trivial subgroup.\n\n### Conclusion\nCombining both cases, we have:\n*   1 power subgroup from all odd exponents (the group SD<sub>512</sub> itself).\n*   8 distinct power subgroups from all even exponents.\n\nIn total, the semidihedral group of size 512 has 1 + 8 = 9 power subgroups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
