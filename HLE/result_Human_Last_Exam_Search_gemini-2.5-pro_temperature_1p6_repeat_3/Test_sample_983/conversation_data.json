    "An analysis of the provided sequence reveals that all numbers are divisible by 6. The differences between consecutive terms are also all divisible by 6. However, there is no simple arithmetic or geometric progression in the sequence or in the differences between its terms.\n\nThe sequence is: 1014, 1020, 1032, 1050, 1104, 1224, 1230, 1290, 1410, 1440, 1452, 1482, 1500, 1512, 1560, 1584, 1602, 1734, 1812, 1890, 1902, 1932, 1974, 2004, 2040, 2064, 2070, 2130, 2142, 2274, 2340, 2352.\n\nThe differences between these numbers are: 6, 12, 18, 54, 120, 6, 60, 120, 30, 12, 30, 18, 12, 48, 24, 18, 132, 78, 78, 12, 30, 42, 30, 36, 24, 6, 60, 12, 132, 66, 12.\n\nWithout a discernible pattern or additional context, predicting the next number with certainty is not possible. The sequence does not correspond to any known simple mathematical series found in the search results.\n\nHowever, if a simple continuation is assumed, the most basic step would be to find the next multiple of 6 after the last term, which is 2352. The next multiple of 6 is 2358.\n\n<<<2358>>>"
