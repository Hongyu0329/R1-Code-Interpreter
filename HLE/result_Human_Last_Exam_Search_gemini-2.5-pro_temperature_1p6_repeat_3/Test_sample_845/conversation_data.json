    "The value computed as the time between heartbeats, which is used to determine Heart Rate Variability (HRV), is called the **Interbeat Interval (IBI)**.\n\nWhen heart rate is measured using an electrocardiogram (ECG), this interval between the R-peaks of the QRS complex is specifically referred to as the **RR interval**. However, when using photoplethysmography (PPG) to capture beat-to-beat intervals, the more general term **Interbeat Interval (IBI)** is used. This variation in the duration of successive IBIs is what constitutes heart rate variability.\n\nThe terms \"beat-to-beat interval\" and \"heart period\" are also used to describe this same value. These intervals are typically measured in milliseconds.\n\n<<<Interbeat Interval (IBI)"
