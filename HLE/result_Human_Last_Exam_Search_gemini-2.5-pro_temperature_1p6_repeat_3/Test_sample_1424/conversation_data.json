    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, often denoted as G₀, describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is fundamental to understanding the behavior of the system before interactions are taken into account.\n\nThe bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space, G₀(k, ω), for a fermionic or bosonic system is typically expressed as:\n\n***G*₀(*k*, *ω*) = 1 / (*ω* - *ϵ*ₖ + *iη* sgn(*ϵ*ₖ - *μ*))**\n\nWhere:\n*   ***k*** represents the momentum or wave vector of the single-particle state.\n*   ***ω*** is the frequency or energy of the particle.\n*   ***ϵ*ₖ** are the single-particle energy eigenvalues, which describe the energy of a particle with momentum **k** in the absence of interactions.\n*   ***η*** is an infinitesimal positive number that ensures proper causality, determining how the poles of the Green's function are handled in complex integration.\n*   **sgn** is the signum function.\n*   ***μ*** is the chemical potential, which sets the energy level of the Fermi surface at zero temperature.\n\n**Functional Dependence:**\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function G₀ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵₖ is that of an **inverse linear relationship** in the energy-frequency domain. Specifically, the denominator of G₀(k, ω) contains the term (*ω* - *ϵ*ₖ), indicating that G₀ has poles at the single-particle energies. These poles are a crucial feature, as they represent the energies at which the non-interacting particles can exist.\n\nIn essence, the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵₖ directly determine the locations of the singularities of the bare Green's function in the complex energy plane. This relationship forms the basis for perturbative treatments of interacting systems, where the bare Green's function serves as the starting point, and interactions modify this fundamental structure."
