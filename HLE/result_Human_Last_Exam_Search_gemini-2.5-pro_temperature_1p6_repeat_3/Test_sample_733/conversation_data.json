    "There are infinitely many finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why this is the case, based on the classification of such groups:\n\nA subset S of a group G is called product-free if there are no elements a, b, c in S (not necessarily distinct) such that ab = c. This condition is equivalent to the statement that the set S and the set of its products, SS = {xy | x, y ∈ S}, are disjoint. A product-free set is \"maximal by inclusion\" (also referred to as \"locally maximal\") if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set within the same group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing a maximal product-free set of size 2 was completed by M. Giudici and S. Hart. Their research provides the following characterization:\n\nLet G be a finite group and S be a maximal product-free set in G of size 2. Let ⟨S⟩ be the subgroup generated by the elements of S. According to their findings, ⟨S⟩ must be one of the following groups:\n*   The cyclic groups C₅, C₆, C₈, or C₁₀.\n*   The Klein group C₂ × C₂.\n*   The dihedral group of order 6, D₆.\n\nFurthermore, the subgroup ⟨S⟩ is a normal subgroup of G, and the quotient group G/⟨S⟩ must be an elementary abelian 2-group. An elementary abelian 2-group is a group isomorphic to (C₂)ⁿ for some integer n ≥ 0, which is the direct product of n copies of the cyclic group of order 2.\n\nThis classification implies that for any of the six possible subgroups ⟨S⟩ listed above, we can construct an infinite number of distinct finite groups G that contain a maximal product-free set of size 2. For instance, if we let K be any of the six groups that can be generated by a maximal product-free set of size 2 (e.g., K = C₅), then for any integer n ≥ 0, the direct product G = K × (C₂)ⁿ will contain K as a normal subgroup. In this case, G/K is isomorphic to (C₂)ⁿ, which is an elementary abelian 2-group. It can be shown that the original maximal product-free set of size 2 within K remains a maximal product-free set in the larger group G for many such constructions.\n\nSince n can be any non-negative integer, we can create an infinite sequence of such groups G, each with a different order. Therefore, the number of finite groups containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 is infinite.\n\n"
