The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction is in the range of 10-12.5 wt% Ni on ceria or an approximate atomic ratio of 1:3.5 (Ni:Ce). For water splitting, a higher nickel content is favored, with a computationally predicted optimal atomic ratio of 3:1 (Ni:Ce) and experimentally effective molar ratios of 1:1 (Ni:Ce) in multicomponent catalysts.
