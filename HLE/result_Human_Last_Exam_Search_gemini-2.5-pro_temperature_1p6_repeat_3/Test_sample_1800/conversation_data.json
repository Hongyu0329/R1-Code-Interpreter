    "Determining the ideal nickel-to-ceria (Ni/Ce) ratio for maximizing catalytic performance is crucial for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS). However, research indicates that the optimal ratio is not the same for both applications and often depends on the specific catalyst preparation and reaction conditions.\n\n### Ideal Ni/Ce Ratio for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, which converts carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and hydrogen, an excess of ceria relative to nickel generally enhances performance. Studies show that a nickel loading in the range of **10 to 12.5 wt% on a ceria support** provides excellent catalytic activity.\n\nOne study investigated various Ni loadings and found that while all samples between 5 and 12.5 wt% were active, the highest CO conversion of 97.8% at 400 °C was achieved with the 12.5 wt% Ni/CeO₂ catalyst. Another investigation into mixed-metal oxide catalysts found that a composition of Ni₀.₂W₀.₁Ce₀.₇O₂, which corresponds to a Ni/Ce atomic ratio of approximately 1:3.5, exhibited the highest catalytic activity. For the reverse WGS reaction, an optimal nickel proportion of about 7% molar has been reported.\n\n### Ideal Ni/Ce Ratio for Water Splitting (WS)\n\nIn the case of water splitting, which produces hydrogen and oxygen from water, a higher relative amount of nickel appears to be advantageous. The ideal ratio can be influenced by the presence of other co-dopants, which are common in these types of electrocatalysts.\n\nA computational study focused on the fundamentals of the reaction predicted that a **3Ni/1Ce atomic ratio** provides the most favorable electronic properties and adsorption energy for the water-splitting reaction.\n\nExperimental work supports the efficacy of catalysts with a significant nickel content. For instance, in a complex electrocatalyst also containing iron (NiFe₂O₄ decorated with CeO₂), a **1:1:1 molar ratio of Ni:Fe:Ce** was found to yield the best performance for overall water splitting. Another study on Ni and Fe co-doped ceria noted excellent activity with a high doping level of 20 mol% where Ni and Fe were in a 1:1 ratio. The synergistic effects between nickel and ceria, particularly the formation of oxygen vacancies, are crucial for the enhanced catalytic activity in water splitting.\n\nIn summary, there is no single Ni/Ce ratio that is optimal for both reactions. For the WGS reaction, a lower nickel content relative to ceria is generally preferred, whereas for water splitting, a higher nickel content, potentially in a 1:1 or even 3:1 ratio to ceria, appears to be more effective.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction is in the range of 10-12.5 wt% Ni on ceria or an approximate atomic ratio of 1:3.5 (Ni:Ce). For water splitting, a higher nickel content is favored, with a computationally predicted optimal atomic ratio of 3:1 (Ni:Ce) and experimentally effective molar ratios of 1:1 (Ni:Ce) in multicomponent catalysts.>>>"
