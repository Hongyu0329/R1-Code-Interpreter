    "The reaction involves 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene and an excess of phenyl magnesium bromide, a Grignard reagent. In polyhalogenated aromatic compounds, the reactivity of the halogens towards Grignard reagents (or in the formation of Grignard reagents themselves) follows the order I > Br > Cl > F. The carbon-iodine bond is the weakest and therefore the most reactive site for substitution.\n\nThe phenyl group from the phenyl magnesium bromide will preferentially replace the iodine atom at the C-2 position. The reaction is:\n\n1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene + C₆H₅MgBr → 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene + MgBrI\n\nWhile an excess of the Grignard reagent and reflux conditions are used, the carbon-bromine bonds are significantly less reactive than the carbon-iodine bond. Cross-coupling reactions involving aryl bromides and Grignard reagents, known as Kumada coupling, typically require a nickel or palladium catalyst to proceed at a reasonable rate. Without a catalyst, the reaction is very slow, and it is most likely that only the highly reactive iodine is substituted. The aqueous work-up serves to quench any unreacted Grignard reagent and does not alter the main organic product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene.\n\nTo determine the IUPAC name, the benzene ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the substituents are listed alphabetically (bromo, then phenyl). The numbering that provides the lowest locant set is 1,3 for the bromo groups and 2 for the phenyl group ({1,2,3}).\n\n<<<1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene>>>"
