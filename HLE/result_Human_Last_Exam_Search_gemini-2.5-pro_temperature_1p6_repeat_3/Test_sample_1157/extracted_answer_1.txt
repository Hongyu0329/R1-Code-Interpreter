The appropriate management involves a phased approach starting with emergency care focused on wound cleaning, alveolar fracture stabilization, and systemic management of her diabetes. Due to the 28-hour delay, replantation is not an option. The SNB angle of 88‚Å∞ indicates a prognathic mandible (Skeletal Class III), which is critical for planning the bite of the final prosthesis. The cells of primary interest in socket healing are platelets, neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts. For tooth replacement, a cast metal (Cobalt-Chromium) removable partial denture with acrylic saddles and teeth is the recommended treatment. The abutment teeth would be the left second premolar and left central incisor, along with the right second premolar and right first molar, to ensure optimal support, stability, and retention for the denture.
