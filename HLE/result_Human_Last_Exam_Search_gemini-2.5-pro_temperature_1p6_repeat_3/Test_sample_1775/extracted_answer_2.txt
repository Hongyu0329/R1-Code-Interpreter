The displacement field through the transistor is not uniform. In the top dielectric, it is $\vec{D}_{tg} = -C_{tg}V_{tg}\hat{z}$, and in the bottom dielectric, it is $\vec{D}_{bg} = C_{bg}V_{bg}\hat{z}$, where $\hat{z}$ is the direction from the bottom gate to the top gate. The combination of these two fields governs the device's behavior.
