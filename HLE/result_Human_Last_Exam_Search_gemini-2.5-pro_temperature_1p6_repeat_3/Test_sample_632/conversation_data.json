    "A unique architectural feature of the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome, which was present for centuries, was a set of twin bell towers on the Pantheon itself. However, these were not removed in 1950 but rather in the late 19th century. Historical records and research do not indicate the removal of a specific architectural feature from the square in the year 1950.\n\nThe aforementioned bell towers, often derisively called the \"ass's ears,\" were added to the Pantheon in the 17th century. Attributed by some to the famous architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini, they were part of a series of modifications the ancient temple underwent after its conversion to a Christian church. These towers were a prominent feature of the piazza's skyline for over two centuries.\n\nThe decision to remove the bell towers was made in the late 19th century, following the unification of Italy. The demolition was part of an effort to restore the Pantheon to its original, classical appearance and remove later additions that were considered to have disfigured the ancient monument.\n\nWhile the Piazza della Rotonda has seen numerous transformations throughout its long history—from being a bustling market filled with shops and stalls to the open square it is today—the most significant architectural *removal* was that of the Pantheon's bell towers in the 1880s, not in 1950. The area has been subject to various clearances and alterations over the centuries, including the demolition of buildings to enlarge the piazza. The central fountain and obelisk, key features of the square today, were also later additions.\n\nThere is no evidence from available historical sources of a notable architectural feature being removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950.\n\n<<<The twin bell towers on the Pantheon>>>"
