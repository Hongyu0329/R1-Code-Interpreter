    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct crystal classes:\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Activity:** A material is considered optically active if it can rotate the plane of polarized light. In general, this property requires the material's structure to be chiral. A chiral structure is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. In crystallography, this means the crystal class must not contain any improper rotation axes, which include centers of inversion and mirror planes.\n\n2.  **The Question's Premise:** The question asks for crystal classes that are both *achiral* and *optically active*. This appears to be a contradiction, as achiral structures are, by the common definition, not optically active. However, there is a broader definition of optical activity (also called gyrotropy) that is not forbidden by all achiral symmetries. This effect is allowed in any crystal class that is non-centrosymmetric (lacks a center of inversion). Therefore, the question is seeking crystal classes that are simultaneously:\n    *   **Achiral:** Possessing an improper rotation axis (e.g., a mirror plane or rotoinversion axis).\n    *   **Non-polar:** Lacking a unique polar axis.\n    *   **Non-centrosymmetric:** Lacking a center of inversion.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Relevant Crystal Classes:**\n    *   There are 32 crystal classes in total. Eleven of these are centrosymmetric and thus cannot be optically active. This leaves 21 non-centrosymmetric classes.\n    *   Of these 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, we must identify those that are **achiral**. The chiral classes (those lacking any improper rotations) are 1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, and 432. Removing these leaves 10 achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes: m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -6, -6m2, and -43m.\n    *   Finally, we must select the **non-polar** classes from this list of 10. A crystal class is polar if it has a spontaneous electric dipole. The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm.\n    *   Comparing our list of 10 achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes with the list of 10 polar classes, we remove the ones that are polar (m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm).\n    *   This leaves five crystal classes that fit all the criteria: **-4, -42m, -6, -6m2 (also written as -62m), and -43m**.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Answer Choices:**\n    *   A. `m` and `mm2`: These are polar.\n    *   B. `-6`, `-62m`, and `-43m`: All three of these classes are in our derived list of five. They are achiral, non-polar, and non-centrosymmetric.\n    *   C. `3m, 4m, and 6mm`: These are polar. (\"4m\" is likely a typo for 4mm).\n    *   D. `-4` and `-42m`: Both of these classes are also in our derived list of five. They are achiral, non-polar, and non-centrosymmetric.\n    *   E. `1, 2, 3, 4, and 6`: These classes are all chiral and polar.\n\nBoth choices B and D contain lists of crystal classes that correctly fit the description. Since both are factually correct subsets of the possible answers, the question may be flawed. However, if a single best choice must be made, both are valid examples of the phenomenon. Without further clarification, both present correct examples. However, choice B represents a broader range of crystal systems (hexagonal and cubic) that exhibit this property.\n\n<<<B>>>"
