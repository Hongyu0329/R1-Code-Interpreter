    "The currently used common name for the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" in their native range is fairy bee. These bees are found in North America and are so-named for their diminutive size.\n\nPinpointing the exact year the term \"fairy bee\" was coined is challenging, as common names often develop organically. The genus itself was first described in 1853. While the term \"fairy\" has been used to describe small, delicate things since at least the 17th century, the first located publication containing the specific phrase \"fairy bee\" is a Ugandan folk tale published in a collection in 1922. While not directly related to the North American *Perdita* bees, it establishes the use of the term in the English language at that time.\n\n<<<Fairy bee, 1922>>>"
