    "After a gene duplication event in a eukaryotic genome, there are several possible fates for the new gene copy. The mechanisms responsible for the retention and subsequent divergence of these duplicated genes are a central topic in evolutionary biology. Analyzing the given options:\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange that tends to homogenize the sequences of duplicated genes. It counteracts divergence and, therefore, is not the primary mechanism for retaining two distinct, functional gene copies.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate for a duplicated gene, where one copy accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes non-functional. This leads to the *loss* of the duplicate, not its retention as a functional, divergent gene.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this scenario, one of the gene copies acquires a new, beneficial function through mutation, while the other copy retains the original ancestral function. This is an important adaptive mechanism for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This mechanism proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions (or expression patterns), which are partitioned between the two duplicate copies after duplication. Both copies become essential to carry out the full scope of the original gene's functions, leading to their mutual preservation. This is considered a common, neutral process for duplicate gene retention.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This refers to the rapid diversification of a single lineage into a multitude of new species that fill different ecological niches. Gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that fuels adaptive radiation, but it is not the direct molecular mechanism of gene retention and divergence itself. The mechanisms driving the retention of those duplicated genes would be neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization.\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are the primary models explaining the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. There is evidence supporting the prevalence of both mechanisms, and their relative importance may differ across various lineages and gene families. However, subfunctionalization is often considered a highly likely outcome because it can occur through the accumulation of more common, nearly neutral degenerative mutations in different parts of the two gene copies, making both necessary for the organism. This provides a plausible pathway for preserving duplicates before a rarer, beneficial new function has the chance to evolve (neofunctionalization). Some studies explicitly suggest that subfunctionalization is the most common fate leading to the long-term preservation of functional paralogs. Other models propose subfunctionalization acts as an intermediate step that increases the likelihood of a duplicate being retained long enough to potentially neofunctionalize later. Given that it provides a more common, neutral pathway for preservation, subfunctionalization is often cited as a highly probable mechanism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
