    "The number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997) is the number of elements of order 2 in this group. An involution in `PSU(4, q) = SU(4, q) / Z(SU(4, q))` arises from an element `g` in the special unitary group `SU(4, q)` such that `g^2` is in the center, `Z(SU(4, q))`.\n\nFor the group `SU(4, q)` over the finite field with `q^2` elements, the center `Z` has order `gcd(4, q+1)`. With `q=997`, the order of the center is `gcd(4, 998) = 2`. The center thus consists of the identity matrix `I` and `-I`.\n\nAn involution in `PSU(4, 997)` corresponds to the image of an element `g` in `SU(4, 997)` such that `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`.\n\n**Case 1: `g^2 = -I`**\n\nThe existence of such a matrix `g` depends on the properties of the underlying field. The eigenvalues `λ` of a unitary matrix must satisfy the condition `λ * λ^q = 1`. The eigenvalues of an element `g` for which `g^2 = -I` must be `i` or `-i`. For `q=997`, which is a prime of the form `4k+1`, the element `i` (a root of `x^2+1=0`) is in the base field `F_997`, so `i^997 = i`. The condition for `i` to be an eigenvalue of a unitary matrix becomes `i * i^997 = i * i = i^2 = -1`. Since this is not equal to 1, `i` cannot be an eigenvalue. A similar argument holds for `-i`. Consequently, no elements `g` with `g^2 = -I` exist in `SU(4, 997)`.\n\n**Case 2: `g^2 = I`**\n\nIn this case, `g` is an involution in `SU(4, 997)`. Since `det(g) = 1`, the number of eigenvalues equal to -1 must be even. Let this number be `2k`.\n*   If `2k=0`, `g=I`, which becomes the identity in `PSU` and is not an involution.\n*   If `2k=4`, `g=-I`, which is in the center of `SU(4, 997)` and also becomes the identity in `PSU`.\n*   If `2k=2`, `g` has two eigenvalues equal to -1 and two equal to 1. These are the elements whose images in `PSU(4, 997)` are involutions.\n\nAll such involutions with two -1 eigenvalues are conjugate in `SU(4, 997)`. The number of these involutions is given by the size of their conjugacy class, which is calculated as the order of the group `SU(4, q)` divided by the order of the centralizer of one such involution.\n\nThe centralizer in `SU(4,q)` of such an involution is a subgroup of `U(2,q) x U(2,q)` with a determinant condition, leading to the order `|U(2,q)|^2 / (q+1)`. The order of `SU(4,q)` is `q^6 (q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`.\n\nThe number of these involutions is given by the formula: `q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)`.\n\nFor `q = 997`, the number of involutions is:\n\n`997^4 * (997^2 + 1) * (997^2 - 997 + 1)`\n`= 997^4 * (994009 + 1) * (994009 - 997 + 1)`\n`= 997^4 * 994010 * 993013`\n`= 988053848081 * 994010 * 993013`\n`= 975283516580585641551030`\n\nThus, the total number of involutions in PSU(4,997) is the size of this single conjugacy class of involutions.\n\n<<<975283516580585641551030>>>"
