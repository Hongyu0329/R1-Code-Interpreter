    "An island town fitting the unique description of being more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island and sitting on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera that shares the town's name does not appear to exist.\n\nExtensive research considered several remote volcanic islands. Tristan da Cunha, the most remote inhabited archipelago in the world, is a strong candidate in terms of isolation. Its only settlement, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, is situated on the main island, which is a volcano. The nearest inhabited landmass is Saint Helena, over 2,000 kilometers away, well beyond the 500-kilometer requirement. The island's volcano is named Queen Mary's Peak, and while the settlement is on the coast, there is no bay or caldera officially named Edinburgh of the Seven Seas.\n\nAnother island investigated was Deception Island in Antarctica, which is the caldera of an active volcano and features a bay known as Whalers Bay, the site of a former whaling station. However, Deception Island is not permanently inhabited, hosting only seasonal research stations, and therefore does not meet a key criterion of the question.\n\nThe Greek island of Santorini is a well-known inhabited volcanic caldera. The main island, Thira, has its capital at Fira, and the entire island group, which forms the caldera, is known as Santorini. This aligns with the name-sharing aspect of the query. However, Santorini is not sufficiently isolated, with the nearest inhabited island, Anafi, being only 22 kilometers away.\n\nAfter thorough investigation, no location has been found to satisfy all the conditions of the query.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to your question as no such island town appears to exist.>>>"
