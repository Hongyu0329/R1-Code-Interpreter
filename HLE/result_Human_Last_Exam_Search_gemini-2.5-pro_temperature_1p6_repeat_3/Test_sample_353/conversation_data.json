    "The exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the $A(\\alpha)$-stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme is determined by finding the maximum angle for which the stability region of the method contains the angular sector $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha, z \\neq 0\\}$. For linear multistep methods, this angle is dictated by the boundary of the stability region.\n\nThe boundary of the stability region for BDF methods can be analyzed to find the extremal points that define the angle $\\alpha$. Seminal work by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis, and subsequently simplified by Gander and Wanner, provides the exact analytical expressions for these angles.\n\nFor the BDF4 method, the tangent of the stability angle $\\alpha$ is given as $2\\sqrt{6}$. This value is derived by finding the maximum of the ratio of the imaginary part to the negative of the real part of the stability function along the imaginary axis.\n\nTherefore, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ in radians is given by:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan(2\\sqrt{6})$\n\nThis corresponds to an approximate angle of $73.35^\\circ$.\n\n<<<arctan(2*sqrt(6))>>>"
