    "The provided nucleotide sequence is from the middle of an open reading frame (ORF). To find the correct protein sequence, it must be translated in all three possible reading frames. The correct frame is the one that does not contain a stop codon. The standard genetic code uses three-nucleotide codons to specify each amino acid.\n\nThe sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nThe three reading frames are:\n\n*   **Frame 1 (starting from the 1st nucleotide):** `gga-cat-tgt-tgt-tag...`\n    *   Translation: `G C C S * ...`\n    *   This frame contains a stop codon (`tag`, marked by `*`) and is therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **Frame 2 (starting from the 2nd nucleotide):** `gac-att-gtt-gtt-agc-gaa-gac-ttg-aat-gga-acg-gtg-aag-ttt-tca-agc-tct-tta-ccc-tac-ccc-aat-aat-ctt-aac-agt-gtc-ctg-gct-gag-cga-ctg-gag-aag-tgg-c`\n    *   Translation: `D I V V S E D L N G T V K F S S L L P Y P N N L N S V L A E R L E K W`\n    *   This frame is \"open\" (contains no stop codons) and is the correct reading frame.\n\n*   **Frame 3 (starting from the 3rd nucleotide):** `aca-ttg-ttg-tta-gcg-aag-act-tga...`\n    *   Translation: `T L L L A K T * ...`\n    *   This frame contains a stop codon (`tga`, marked by `*`) and is therefore incorrect.\n\nThe correct frame is Frame 2.\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSLLPYPNNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
