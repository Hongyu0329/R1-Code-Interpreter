The minimal resources to simulate the correlations of POVM measurements on a singlet state are, on average: 2 bits of classical communication, or a single non-signaling PR-box for the specific case of projective measurements. A trade-off exists between these two resources, but a precise, general quantitative exchange rate is an area of active research.
