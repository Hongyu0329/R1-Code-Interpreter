    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, specifically in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions, the leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, is determined by the beta function of the theory.\n\nThe renormalization group (RG) flow of the dimensionless coupling constant, here denoted as u, is described by the beta function, β(u). To the leading order in both the coupling u and the parameter ϵ, the beta function is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + B * u²\n\nwhere B is a constant that arises from the one-loop calculation in the theory. A fixed point, u*, is a value of the coupling where the beta function is zero, meaning the theory is scale-invariant. Setting β(u*) = 0 gives:\n\n-ϵu* + B * (u*)² = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions:\n1.  u* = 0, which corresponds to the trivial (Gaussian) fixed point.\n2.  u* = ϵ / B, which is the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\nThe value of the constant B depends on the specific conventions used for the coupling constant. A common convention in many textbooks leads to the following beta function for the O(N)-symmetric ϕ⁴ theory:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + (N+8)/2 * u²\n\nFor the simple single-component ϕ⁴ theory (N=1), this becomes:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + (9/2) * u²\n\nHowever, other conventions define the beta function differently. One of the most frequently cited results, particularly in statistical mechanics contexts, arises from a beta function of the form:\n\nβ(v) = ϵv - (3/2) * v²\n\nUnder this convention, the non-trivial fixed point is found at:\n\nv* = (2/3)ϵ\n\nAnother common formulation in quantum field theory gives the beta function for the coupling g as:\n\nβ(g) = -ϵg + (3 / (16π²)) * g²\n\nThis results in a fixed point coupling of:\n\ng* = (16π²/3) * ϵ\n\nThe different expressions for the constant factor multiplying ϵ are due to different normalizations of the coupling constant. The essential physical result is that the fixed point coupling is directly proportional to ϵ at the leading order.\n\nTherefore, the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* is of the form:\n\nu* = C * ϵ\n\nWhere C is a positive constant whose value depends on the normalization conventions of the coupling constant. For example, C can be 2/3, 16π²/3, or other values depending on the chosen scheme.\n\n<<<u* = Cϵ, where C is a convention-dependent constant. A common value is C = 2/3.>>>"
