    "There is no finite maximum for the generalised hypertreewidth (GHW) of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, given that the rank of the hypergraph is not bounded by a constant. The maximum value is unbounded.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Definition of Generalized Hypertreewidth (GHW):** The GHW of a hypergraph H is the minimum integer `k` for which there exists a tree decomposition of H such that for every hyperedge `e` of H, there is a bag in the decomposition that contains all the vertices of `e`. The width `k` is defined as the size of the largest bag minus one.\n\n2.  **Definition of Rank:** The rank of a hypergraph `H`, denoted `rank(H)`, is the maximum cardinality (size) of any of its hyperedges.\n\n3.  **Relationship between GHW and Rank:** From the definitions, a direct consequence is that the generalised hypertreewidth of a hypergraph `H` must be at least its rank minus one. This is because for the hyperedge `e` with the maximum size (which defines the rank), any valid decomposition must have at least one bag containing all of `e`. The size of this bag is at least `|e| = rank(H)`. Therefore, the width of the decomposition is at least `rank(H) - 1`.\n    `ghw(H) ≥ rank(H) - 1`\n\n4.  **Implication of Unbounded Rank:** The problem states that there is no constant bound on the rank of the hypergraph. This means the rank can be arbitrarily large. For any integer `K`, we can construct a hypergraph with a rank greater than `K`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since `ghw(H) ≥ rank(H) - 1` and `rank(H)` can be arbitrarily large, the generalised hypertreewidth is also not bounded by any constant.\n\nFor example, for any integer `N > 1`, we can construct a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges that has a GHW of at least `N-1`:\n*   Let the first hyperedge be `e1 = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_N}`.\n*   Let the other two hyperedges be `e2 = {v_1}` and `e3 = {v_2}`.\n*   This hypergraph has 3 hyperedges.\n*   Its rank is `N` because of the hyperedge `e1`.\n*   Any valid tree decomposition must have a bag that contains all of `e1`. The size of this bag will be at least `N`, making the width of the decomposition at least `N-1`. Therefore, `ghw(H) ≥ N-1`.\n\nAs `N` can be any arbitrarily large number, there is no upper limit to the GHW. The number of hyperedges being 3 does not impose a finite maximum on the GHW when the rank is unbounded.\n\n<<<unbounded>>>"
