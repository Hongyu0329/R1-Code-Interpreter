    "In a 6-31G basis set calculation for toluene (C7H8), a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used. This is determined by the number of functions assigned to each atom and the total number of atoms of each element in the molecule.\n\nToluene is composed of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms. The 6-31G basis set defines how many functions are used for each type of atom:\n\n*   **For each Carbon atom:** The 6-31G basis set uses 9 contracted Gaussian functions. This includes one function for the core 1s orbital and a split-valence representation for the 2s and 2p orbitals, resulting in two functions for the 2s orbital and two for each of the three 2p orbitals.\n*   **For each Hydrogen atom:** The 6-31G basis set uses 2 contracted Gaussian functions. The 1s orbital is treated as a split-valence orbital, composed of an inner and an outer function.\n\nTherefore, the total number of contracted functions is calculated as follows:\n\n*   **Carbon:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **Hydrogen:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total:** 63 + 16 = 79 contracted Gaussian functions\n\n<<<79>>>"
