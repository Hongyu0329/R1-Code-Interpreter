    "The problem asks for the value of `log_2(n)`, where `n` is a Church integer represented by a complex SKI combinator expression. The solution involves parsing the SKI expression, identifying the Church numerals and the operations performed on them.\n\nThe given expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nFirst, let's break down the components of this expression. In SKI combinator calculus, expressions are typically left-associative. The structure of this expression is `X(Y)(Z)`, where `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are themselves combinator expressions.\n\n1.  **Identifying the operator:** The outermost part of the expression is `S(I)`. The `S` combinator is defined as `S x y z = x z (y z)`. When applied to `I`, we get a new function, let's call it `op`:\n    `op y z = S(I) y z = I z (y z) = z (y z)`.\n    In the context of Church numerals, applying one numeral `m` to another numeral `n` (i.e., `m(n)`) represents exponentiation, `n^m`. Therefore, the operation `op y z` corresponds to `z` raised to the power of `(y z)`.\n\n2.  **Identifying the operands:** The main expression can be seen as `op(Y)(Z)`, where:\n    *   `Y = S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))`\n    *   `Z = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`\n    *   `A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n\n3.  **Evaluating the operand Z:**\n    *   The sub-expression `S(S(K(S))(K))` is a standard representation of the successor function (`succ`) for Church numerals. It takes a numeral `m` and returns `m+1`.\n    *   The sub-expression `S(I)(I)` is the `U` combinator, which represents self-application (`U f = f o f`).\n    *   `Z` is `succ(U)`. Let's evaluate what this means for a Church numeral. `succ(m) f x = f (m f x)`. Therefore, `succ(U) f x = f (U f x)`. The term `U f x` expands to `(f o f) x`, which is `f(f(x))`, the definition of Church numeral `2`.\n    *   So, `succ(U) f x = f(f(f(x)))`, which is the definition of the Church numeral **3**. Thus, `Z = 3`.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the operand Y and the inner argument A:**\n    *   `A` is `succ(I)`. Since `I` is the identity combinator and represents the Church numeral **1**, `A = succ(1) = 2`.\n    *   So, `Y = S(I)(S(I)(K(2)))`.\n\n5.  **Putting it all together (calculating `n`):**\n    The original expression `n` is `op(Y)(Z)`, which translates to `Z(Y(Z))`.\n    *   First, we need to calculate `Y(Z)`.\n    *   `Y(Z) = op(S(I)(K(2)))(Z) = Z( (S(I)(K(2))) Z )`.\n    *   Let's evaluate the innermost part: `(S(I)(K(2))) Z = op(K(2))(Z) = Z(K(2) Z)`.\n    *   The `K` combinator, `K x y = x`, means `K(2) Z` evaluates to `2`.\n    *   So, `Z(K(2) Z)` becomes `Z(2)`, which means `2^Z`. Since `Z=3`, this is `2^3 = 8`.\n    *   Now we substitute this back into the expression for `Y(Z)`: `Y(Z) = Z(8)`. This means `8^Z`, which is `8^3`.\n    *   `8^3 = (2^3)^3 = 2^9 = 512`.\n    *   Finally, we calculate the full expression for `n = Z(Y(Z)) = Z(512)`.\n    *   This is `512^Z`, which is `512^3`.\n    *   `512^3 = (2^9)^3 = 2^(9 * 3) = 2^27`.\n\nSo, the Church integer `n` is `2^27`.\n\n6.  **Calculating `log_2(n)`:**\n    The final step is to calculate the base-2 logarithm of `n`.\n    `log_2(n) = log_2(2^27) = 27`.\n\n<<<27>>>"
