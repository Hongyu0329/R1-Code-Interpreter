    "The thickness of the double point of the stable reduction is determined by analyzing the minimal regular model of the curve and the structure of its special fiber. This involves a multi-step process.\n\nFirst, we calculate the discriminant of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$. The discriminant, $\\Delta$, is a key invariant. For the given polynomial, the discriminant is $\\Delta = 56912$. The 2-adic valuation of the discriminant, with the normalization $v(2)=1$, is $v_2(\\Delta) = v_2(16 \\cdot 3557) = v_2(2^4 \\cdot 3557) = 4$.\n\nAccording to T. Saito's formula for semistable curves, the valuation of the minimal discriminant is equal to the sum of the thicknesses of the nodes in the special fiber of the stable model. Assuming our model is close to minimal, we use $v_2(\\Delta_{min}) = 4$.\n\nNext, we identify the singular points on an appropriate model of the curve which will become the nodes of the stable reduction. We perform a change of variables to simplify the equation. Let $t = (z-1)/2$. The equation of the curve, $z^2 = 2x^5+2x^3+1$, transforms into:\n$2t(t+1) = x^5+x^3$.\n\nWe examine the special fiber of this model by reducing the equation modulo 2:\n$x^5+x^3 = x^3(x^2+1) \\equiv x^3(x+1)^2 \\pmod{2}$.\nThe singular points are located where the equation of the special fiber and its derivative are both zero. The singular locus corresponds to $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n\nWe are interested in the singular points that are rational over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n*   For the singular line $x=1$: The equation $2t(t+1) = x^5+x^3$ at $x=1$ gives $2t(t+1)=2$, which simplifies to $t^2+t-1=0$. Modulo 2, this becomes $t^2+t+1=0$. This quadratic equation has no solutions in $\\mathbb{F}_2$, so there are no singular points rational over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ on this component.\n*   For the singular line $x=0$: The equation gives $2t(t+1)=0$, which implies $t(t+1)=0$. This has two solutions in $\\mathbb{F}_2$: $t=0$ and $t=1$.\n\nThus, we have two singular points, $P_1=(0,0)$ and $P_2=(0,1)$, that will be resolved into the nodes of the stable reduction.\n\nThe equation of the model is symmetric under the transformation $t \\mapsto -1-t$, which swaps the two singular points $P_1$ and $P_2$. This implies that the resolution of these singularities will be identical, and consequently, the two nodes on the stable model will have the same thickness, let's call it $n$.\n\nThe sum of the thicknesses must equal the valuation of the discriminant:\n$n_{P_1} + n_{P_2} = v_2(\\Delta) = 4$.\nSince $n_{P_1} = n_{P_2} = n$, we have:\n$2n = 4$, which gives $n=2$.\n\nTherefore, the thickness of each of the two double points is 2. The question asks for \"the\" thickness, which is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
