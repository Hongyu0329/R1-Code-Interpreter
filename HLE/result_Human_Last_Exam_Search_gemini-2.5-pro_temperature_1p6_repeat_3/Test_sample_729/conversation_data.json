    "I have gathered information about the definition and structure of generalized quaternion groups. Here's a summary of what I've found and how it relates to the user's question:\n\n*   **Definition of Generalized Quaternion Group (Q_4n):** A generalized quaternion group Q_4n of order 4n can be defined by the presentation  `<x, y | x^(2n) = y^4 = 1, x^n = y^2, yxy^(-1) = x^(-1)>`. For the group of size 128, we have 4n = 128, so n = 32. Thus, we are interested in Q_128, which has the presentation `<x, y | x^64 = y^4 = 1, x^32 = y^2, yxy^(-1) = x^(-1)>`. Some sources use a slightly different but equivalent presentation.\n*   **Structure of Q_128:**\n    *   It is a non-abelian group of order 128.\n    *   It contains a cyclic subgroup of order 64, generated by `x`.\n    *   Elements outside of the cyclic subgroup `<x>` have order 4.\n    *   Every abelian subgroup of a generalized quaternion group is cyclic.\n    *   Every subgroup of a generalized quaternion group is either cyclic or a generalized quaternion group itself.\n*   **Definition of Power Subgroup:** The search results did not explicitly define a \"power subgroup\". However, they do mention subgroups generated by powers of an element, which are cyclic subgroups. Another interpretation could be a subgroup H of G such that H = G^k = {g^k | g in G} for some integer k. I will proceed with the more standard and well-defined concept of cyclic subgroups, which are generated by taking powers of a single element. If this interpretation proves insufficient, I will need to refine my understanding. The term \"power subgroup\" is not standard in group theory literature based on the initial search. It's likely the user is asking for the set of all cyclic subgroups. I will proceed with this assumption.\n\nTo answer the question, I need to find all the cyclic subgroups of Q_128.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  List the orders of all elements in Q_128.\n2.  For each order, determine how many elements have that order.\n3.  For each order `d`, the number of cyclic subgroups of order `d` is the number of elements of order `d` divided by `phi(d)`, where `phi` is Euler's totient function.\n4.  Sum the number of cyclic subgroups of each possible order to get the total number of cyclic subgroups (which I am interpreting as \"power subgroups\").\n\nI will now execute this plan. I do not need further searches at this moment.\n\nHere's the breakdown of elements and subgroups for Q_128, where `|Q_128| = 128 = 2^7` and the group is given by `<x, y | x^64 = 1, x^32 = y^2, yxy^(-1) = x^(-1)>`.\n\n*   **The cyclic subgroup `<x>`:** This is a cyclic group of order 64. The number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order `n` is given by the number of divisors of `n`, `tau(n)`. For `<x>` of order 64, the divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. So there are `tau(64) = tau(2^6) = 6 + 1 = 7` subgroups. These are generated by `x^d` where `d` divides 64.\n\n*   **Elements outside `<x>`:** These are of the form `x^i * y` for `i` from 0 to 63. There are 64 such elements. All these elements have order 4.\n\nNow I need to find the number of cyclic subgroups generated by these 64 elements of order 4. A cyclic group of order 4 has `phi(4) = 2` generators. Each cyclic subgroup of order 4 generated by an element of the form `x^i * y` will also contain `(x^i * y)^3` as a generator. The other two elements are `(x^i * y)^2 = y^2 = x^32` and the identity.\n\nLet's see how many distinct subgroups of order 4 are formed by these 64 elements.\nEach such subgroup contains the identity, `x^32` (which is of order 2), and two elements of order 4.\nThe elements of these subgroups are `{1, x^32, x^i*y, (x^i*y)^-1}`. `(x^i*y)^-1 = y^-1 * x^-i = y^3 * x^-i = y * y^2 * x^-i = y * x^32 * x^-i`. Also, `yxy^-1 = x^-1`, so `yx = x^-1y`. Therefore `yx^i = x^-i y`.\nSo, `(x^i*y)^3 = (x^i*y)(x^i*y)(x^i*y) = x^i(yx^i)y(x^i y) = x^i(x^-i y)y(x^i y) = y^2(x^i y) = x^32 x^i y`.\nSo the generators are `x^i*y` and `x^(i+32)*y`.\nThis means the subgroup generated by `x^i*y` is the same as the one generated by `x^(i+32)*y`.\nSo the 64 elements of order 4 form `64 / 2 = 32` distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n\nSo, the total number of cyclic subgroups (\"power subgroups\") is:\n- The 7 cyclic subgroups contained within `<x>`.\n- The 32 cyclic subgroups of order 4 generated by elements outside of `<x>`.\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = 7 + 32 = 39.\n\nLet's double check the reasoning.\n\nSubgroups of `<x>`: Orders 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. One subgroup for each divisor of 64. Total = 7.\n- `<x^64>` = `<1>` (order 1)\n- `<x^32>` (order 2)\n- `<x^16>` (order 4)\n- `<x^8>` (order 8)\n- `<x^4>` (order 16)\n- `<x^2>` (order 32)\n- `<x>` (order 64)\n\nSubgroups generated by elements `x^i*y`:\nAll `x^i*y` for `i=0..63` are of order 4.\nEach cyclic group of order 4 has 2 generators.\nThe subgroup `<x^i*y>` consists of `{1, x^i*y, (x^i*y)^2, (x^i*y)^3}`.\n`(x^i*y)^2 = x^i*y*x^i*y = x^i * (yx^i) * y = x^i * (x^-i y) * y = y^2 = x^32`. This has order 2.\nSo every such subgroup contains `<x^32>`.\nLet's see if any of these subgroups are duplicates of the cyclic subgroups of `<x>`. The only one of order 4 from `<x>` is `<x^16>`.\nThe elements of `<x^16>` are `{1, x^16, x^32, x^48}`.\nThe elements of `<x^i*y>` are `{1, x^32, x^i*y, (x^i*y)^3}`. Since one set contains elements outside `<x>` and the other doesn't, these cannot be the same subgroup. So the 32 new subgroups are distinct from the cyclic subgroups of `<x>`.\n\nNow we just need to confirm we have counted these 32 correctly.\nLet H_i = `<x^i*y>`. We need to find for which j, H_i = H_j.\nH_i = H_j iff `x^j*y` is a generator of H_i. The generators are `x^i*y` and `(x^i*y)^3`.\n`(x^i*y)^3 = x^i y x^i y x^i y = x^i y x^i x^{-i} y y = x^i y y^2 = x^i x^{32} y = x^{i+32} y`.\nSo `<x^i*y> = <x^{i+32}y>`.\nThe pairs are (0, 32), (1, 33), ..., (31, 63).\nThere are 32 such pairs. Thus, 32 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n\nSo, the total is 7 (from `<x>`) + 32 (from elements outside `<x>`).\nTotal = 39.\n\nI need to make sure my interpretation of \"power subgroup\" is correct.\nA \"power subgroup\" of G is a subgroup of the form H = {g^n | g in G} for some fixed integer n. Let's call this P_n(G). This is a fully invariant subgroup and is also called a verbal subgroup. If this is the intended definition, the calculation is very different. Let's check this possibility.\n\n- n=1: P_1(G) = G. This is 1 subgroup.\n- n=2: P_2(G) is the subgroup generated by all squares. In Q_128, the squares are `x^(2i)` and `(x^i y)^2 = x^32`. The set of squares is `{x^0, x^2, ..., x^62}` union `{x^32}`. This is just the cyclic subgroup `<x^2>`, which has order 32. This gives another subgroup.\n- n=3: P_3(G) is generated by cubes. `(x^i)^3 = x^(3i)`. Since 3 is coprime to 64, this generates all of `<x>`. `(x^i y)^3 = x^(i+32) y`. The set `{x^j, x^k y}` generates the whole group G. So P_3(G) = G.\n- n=4: P_4(G) is generated by 4th powers. `(x^i)^4 = x^(4i)`. This generates `<x^4>`. `(x^i y)^4 = ((x^i y)^2)^2 = (x^32)^2 = x^64 = 1`. So P_4(G) = `<x^4>`, which has order 16. Another subgroup.\n- In general, P_k(G) is generated by `{g^k | g in G}`.\n- If k is odd, P_k(G) = G.\n- If k = 2m where m is odd, g^k = (g^m)^2. The set of all elements g^m is G. So P_k(G) = P_2(G) = `<x^2>`.\n- If k = 4m where m is odd, P_k(G) = P_4(G) = `<x^4>`.\n- If k = 2^j * m where m is odd, P_k(G) = P_{2^j}(G).\nWe need to calculate P_{2^j}(G) for j = 1, 2, 3, ...\nP_1(G) = G.\nP_2(G) = `<(x^i)^2, (x^iy)^2> = <x^2, x^{32}> = <x^2>`. (Order 32)\nP_4(G) = `<(x^i)^4, (x^iy)^4> = <x^4, 1> = <x^4>`. (Order 16)\nP_8(G) = `<x^8, 1> = <x^8>`. (Order 8)\nP_16(G) = `<x^16, 1> = <x^16>`. (Order 4)\nP_32(G) = `<x^32, 1> = <x^32>`. (Order 2)\nP_64(G) = `<x^64, 1> = <1>`. (Order 1, trivial subgroup)\nP_128(G) = `<1, 1> = <1>`.\n\nThe set of distinct power subgroups under this definition would be {G, `<x^2>`, `<x^4>`, `<x^8>`, `<x^16>`, `<x^32>`, <1>}.\nThis is a total of 7 subgroups.\n\nThis interpretation seems plausible as well. The term \"power subgroup\" is ambiguous. However, searching for \"power subgroups of generalized quaternion groups\" did not yield a specific definition that differs from the general one. Often in group theory questions, non-standard terminology implies a simpler concept. \"Subgroups generated by powers of elements\" (cyclic subgroups) seems more likely to be what is intended in a general context like this.\n\nLet's re-read the query carefully. \"How many power subgroups are there in the generalized quaternion group of size 128?\"\nThe term \"power subgroup\" is not standard.\nPossibility 1: A cyclic subgroup. This is the most common interpretation for such a phrasing in a problem.\nPossibility 2: A subgroup of the form G^k = <g^k | g in G>. This is less common but a valid interpretation of the words.\n\nLet's check the context from the search results. Result mentions \"the subgroup Pn,k generated by kth powers of elements of Fn\". This refers to the second interpretation. Results and refer to cyclic subgroups as \"the set of all powers of an element\". This points to the first interpretation.\n\nWithout further clarification from the user, the question is ambiguous. However, the number of all subgroups of Q128 is much larger. The number of cyclic subgroups is a well-defined and common calculation. The number of verbal subgroups of the form P_k(G) is also well-defined.\n\nLet's consider the subgroup lattice.\nEvery subgroup is either cyclic or a generalized quaternion group.\nThe cyclic subgroups are what I calculated first: 39 of them.\n- 7 inside `<x>` (orders 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64)\n- 32 outside `<x>` (order 4)\n\nWhat about the non-cyclic subgroups? These would be generalized quaternion groups of smaller order. Q_128 = Q_{2*64}. The subgroups can be Q_8, Q_16, Q_32, Q_64.\n- A subgroup isomorphic to Q_64 is `<x^2, y>`. The relation `(x^2)^16 = x^32 = y^2` holds. And `y(x^2)y^-1 = (yxy^-1)^2 = (x^-1)^2 = x^-2`. This is a subgroup of index 2.\n- Another one is `<x^2, xy>`. Let z = xy. Then `z^2 = xyxy = x(yxy^-1)y^2 = x(x^-1)y^2 = y^2 = x^32`. `zxz^-1 = (xy)x(y^-1x^-1) = xyxy^-1x^-1 = x(x^-1)x^-1 = x^-1`. This doesn't look right. Let's recompute: `y(x^k)y^-1 = x^-k`. `z = x^i y`. We need to check the relations. Let H be a subgroup. If H is not cyclic, it is a generalized quaternion group. A subgroup of Q_2^n is either cyclic or a dicyclic group of order 2^k for k < n. Dicyclic of order 2^k is the generalized quaternion group Q_{2^k}.\n\nLet's look at the maximal subgroups of Q_128. They are of index 2, so order 64.\n1. `<x>` (cyclic, order 64)\n2. H_1 = `<x^2, y>`. Presentation: `<a,b | a^32=1, b^2=a^16, bab^-1=a^-1>`. This is Q_64.\n3. H_2 = `<x^2, xy>`. `(xy)^2 = x^32 = (x^2)^16`. `(xy)x^2(xy)^-1 = xyx^2y^-1x^-1 = x(yx^2y^-1)x^-1 = x(x^-2)x^-1 = x^-3`. This is not Q_64. There must be an error in my reasoning or the sources.\n\nLet's re-read Conrad's paper. For n>=4, the proper normal subgroups of Q_{2^n} are the subgroups of `<x>` and the two subgroups `<x^2, y>` and `<x^2, xy>`, which are both of index 2 and are isomorphic to Q_{2^(n-1)}.\nSo for Q_128 (n=7), `<x^2, y>` and `<x^2, xy>` are subgroups isomorphic to Q_64.\nAre there other subgroups isomorphic to Q_64? I don't know. Are there subgroups isomorphic to Q_32, Q_16, Q_8?\n\nGiven the ambiguity of \"power subgroup\", the simplest interpretations are the most likely.\n1.  **Cyclic subgroups:** This is a standard concept. I found there are 39.\n2.  **Verbal subgroups G^k:** This is also a standard concept. I found there are 7.\n\nLet's consider the phrase \"power subgroups\". Plural. A group only has one set of powers for each exponent `k`. The question asks \"how many\". This suggests counting distinct subgroups that fit a certain description. So \"all subgroups H such that H=P_k(G) for some k\" would be the question under interpretation 2. My answer is 7. For interpretation 1, it's \"all subgroups H such that H is cyclic\". My answer is 39.\n\nWhich one is more likely? Let's search again, perhaps for the subgroup lattice of Q_128.The term \"power subgroup\" is not a standard term in group theory. However, it is most likely interpreted as a **cyclic subgroup**, which is a subgroup generated by taking all integer powers of a single element. We will proceed by calculating the number of distinct cyclic subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128.\n\n### Structure of the Generalized Quaternion Group Q_128\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order 128 can be defined by the following presentation:\nQ_128 = < x, y | x⁶⁴ = 1, x³² = y², yxy⁻¹ = x⁻¹ >\n\nThis group has 128 elements. We can partition the elements into two sets:\n1.  The elements in the cyclic subgroup generated by `x`, which is `<x>`. This subgroup is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 64, C₆₄.\n2.  The elements not in `<x>`, which can be written in the form `xⁱy` for i = 0, 1, ..., 63. There are 64 such elements.\n\n### Calculating the Number of Cyclic Subgroups\n\nWe will count the cyclic subgroups in each of these partitions.\n\n**1. Cyclic Subgroups within `<x>`**\n\nThe subgroup `<x>` is a cyclic group of order 64. The number of subgroups in a finite cyclic group of order *n* is equal to the number of divisors of *n* (τ(n)).\nFor `<x>` of order 64, we need to find the number of divisors of 64. Since 64 = 2⁶, the divisors are 2⁰, 2¹, 2², 2³, 2⁴, 2⁵, and 2⁶.\nThe number of divisors is τ(64) = 6 + 1 = 7.\nThese 7 subgroups are:\n*   <x⁶⁴> = <1> (order 1)\n*   <x³²> (order 2)\n*   <x¹⁶> (order 4)\n*   <x⁸> (order 8)\n*   <x⁴> (order 16)\n*   <x²> (order 32)\n*   <x> (order 64)\n\nThere is exactly one cyclic subgroup for each power of 2 from 2⁰ to 2⁶.\n\n**2. Cyclic Subgroups outside of `<x>`**\n\nThe elements outside of `<x>` are of the form `g = xⁱy`. Let's determine the order of these 64 elements.\ng² = (xⁱy)(xⁱy) = xⁱ(yxⁱy⁻¹)y² = xⁱ(x⁻¹)ⁱy² = xⁱx⁻ⁱy² = y² = x³²\nSince g² = x³² ≠ 1, the order of g is not 2.\ng⁴ = (g²)² = (x³²)² = x⁶⁴ = 1.\nTherefore, all 64 elements of the form `xⁱy` have an order of 4.\n\nNow we need to find how many distinct cyclic subgroups these 64 elements generate. A cyclic group of order 4 has φ(4) = 2 generators (where φ is Euler's totient function). This means that each cyclic subgroup of order 4 is generated by two distinct elements of order 4.\nThe generators of the subgroup `<g>` = `<xⁱy>` are `g` and `g³`.\nWe have `g³ = g⁻¹ = (xⁱy)⁻¹ = y⁻¹x⁻ⁱ = (y³)(x⁻ⁱ) = (yx³²)x⁻ⁱ = yx³²⁻ⁱ`. Using the relation `yx = x⁻¹y`, we can show `g³ = xⁱ⁺³²y`.\nSo, the subgroup `<xⁱy>` is the same as the subgroup `<xⁱ⁺³²y>`.\n\nSince the 64 elements of order 4 form pairs of generators for the same subgroup, the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4 generated by these elements is:\n64 / 2 = 32.\n\nThese 32 subgroups are distinct from the cyclic subgroups of `<x>`, as their elements include `y`, while the subgroups of `<x>` do not. Specifically, the only cyclic subgroup of order 4 within `<x>` is `<x¹⁶>`, which does not contain any element with `y`.\n\n### Total Number of Power Subgroups\n\nTo find the total number of power (cyclic) subgroups, we sum the number of subgroups from both parts:\n*   Number of cyclic subgroups from `<x>`: 7\n*   Number of cyclic subgroups from elements outside `<x>`: 32\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = 7 + 32 = 39.\n\n<<<39>>>"
