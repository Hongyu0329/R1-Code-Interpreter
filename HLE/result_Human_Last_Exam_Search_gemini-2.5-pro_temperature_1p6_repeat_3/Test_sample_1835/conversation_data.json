    "<<<Yes.\n\nAssuming Gareth Evans's Generality Constraint, if you understand the proposition *Fa* and you understand universal quantification, then you should be able to understand *Fx (∀x)*. This conclusion follows directly from the core principles of the Generality Constraint.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **The Nature of the Generality Constraint:** The Generality Constraint is a principle about the structure of thought. It posits that thoughts are complex entities built from the exercise of distinct, recombinable conceptual abilities. Evans states, \"...if a subject can be credited with the thought that a is F, then he must have the conceptual resources for entertaining the thought that a is G, for every property of being G of which he has a conception\". This principle also works for the subject term; if one can think *a is F* and has a concept of *b*, one can think *b is F*.\n\n2.  **Understanding 'Fa':** According to this framework, to understand the proposition \"Fa\" (e.g., \"Socrates is mortal\") is to possess and exercise two separate conceptual abilities:\n    *   An \"Idea\" of *a* (the ability to think about the specific object, Socrates).\n    *   A concept of *F* (the ability to think about the property of being mortal).\n\n    Crucially, possessing the concept *F* means you have a general ability that is not tied only to the object *a*. You can, in principle, combine it with other concepts.\n\n3.  **The Role of Universal Quantification:** Your premise states that you also understand universal quantification. Within Evans's framework, this would be considered another fundamental conceptual ability—the ability to apply a concept universally.\n\n4.  **Combining Conceptual Abilities:** The essence of the Generality Constraint is that these distinct conceptual abilities can be freely recombined. Therefore, if you possess the conceptual ability to think \"...is F\" (isolated from your understanding of *Fa*) and you possess the conceptual ability to think in a universally quantified way, you have the necessary resources to combine them. This combination results in the thought that \"For all x, x is F\" or *Fx (∀x)*.\n\n5.  **From Singular to Quantified:** Evans's work on quantifiers supports this conclusion directly. He argued that the semantics for quantified sentences can be built upon the semantics of their singular instances. He writes that if we provide a semantic account of singular sentences, the meaning of their corresponding quantified sentences \"simply takes care of itself\". This indicates a deep, systematic link between understanding a predicate's application to an individual and understanding its application to a whole domain of individuals. To deny that someone could form the universal thought would be to suggest that their concept of *F* is somehow restricted to singular propositions, which violates the very essence of the Generality Constraint.\n\nWhile Evans noted a proviso about the \"categorial appropriateness\" of predicates to subjects (e.g., it might not be a coherent thought that \"The number seven is asleep\"), this restriction does not apply here, as the predicate *F* is simply being generalized over a domain, not applied to a categorically inappropriate subject."
