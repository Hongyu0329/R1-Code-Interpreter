    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s],\n      [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nand\nP2 = [[s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nWe can use the Euclidean algorithm, which involves performing elementary row operations on a composite matrix formed by stacking P1 and P2. Let's form the matrix M:\n\nM = [P1; P2] = [[s^2 + s, -s],    (Row 1)\n                [-s^2 - 1, s^2],   (Row 2)\n                [s, 0],           (Row 3)\n                [-s - 1, 1]]      (Row 4)\n\nThe goal is to reduce this matrix to a form where the GCRD consists of the non-zero rows, typically in a simplified (e.g., row-echelon) form.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Eliminate the s^2 term in Row 1.**\n    We can use Row 3 for this. Replace Row 1 with `Row 1 - (s+1) * Row 3`:\n    `[s^2 + s, -s] - (s+1)[s, 0] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s] = [0, -s]`\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [[0, -s],\n     [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n     [s, 0],\n     [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n2.  **Step 2: Make the first element of Row 1 non-zero to help with further eliminations.**\n    Replace Row 1 with `Row 1 + s * Row 4`:\n    `[0, -s] + s[-s - 1, 1] = [-s(s+1), -s + s] = [-s^2 - s, 0]`\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [[-s^2 - s, 0],\n     [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n     [s, 0],\n     [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n3.  **Step 3: Eliminate the new Row 1.**\n    Replace Row 1 with `Row 1 + (s+1) * Row 3`:\n    `[-s^2 - s, 0] + (s+1)[s, 0] = [-s^2 - s + s^2 + s, 0] = [0, 0]`\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [,\n     [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n     [s, 0],\n     [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n4.  **Step 4: Eliminate the s^2 term in the second column of Row 2.**\n    Replace Row 2 with `Row 2 - s^2 * Row 4`:\n    `[-s^2 - 1, s^2] - s^2[-s - 1, 1] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, s^2 - s^2] = [s^3 - 1, 0]`\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [,\n     [s^3 - 1, 0],\n     [s, 0],\n     [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n5.  **Step 5: Simplify Row 2 using Row 3.**\n    This is analogous to the Euclidean algorithm for the polynomials `s^3 - 1` and `s`. Replace Row 2 with `Row 2 - s^2 * Row 3`:\n    `[s^3 - 1, 0] - s^2[s, 0] = [s^3 - 1 - s^3, 0] = [-1, 0]`\n    The matrix is now:\n    [,\n     [-1, 0],\n     [s, 0],\n     [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n6.  **Step 6: Normalize Row 2.**\n    Multiply Row 2 by -1:\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [,\n    ,\n     [s, 0],\n     [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n7.  **Step 7: Use the new Row 2 to eliminate other rows.**\n    - Replace Row 3 with `Row 3 - s * Row 2`: `[s, 0] - s[1, 0] = [0, 0]`\n    - Replace Row 4 with `Row 4 + (s+1) * Row 2`: `[-s - 1, 1] + (s+1)[1, 0] = [-s - 1 + s + 1, 1] = [0, 1]`\n\n    The final matrix is:\n    [,\n    ,\n    ,\n    ]\n\nThe non-zero rows form the GCRD. By arranging them, we get:\nG(s) = [,\n       ]\n\nThis is the identity matrix, which is a unimodular matrix (its determinant is a non-zero constant, 1). When the GCRD of two polynomial matrices is a unimodular matrix, the matrices are said to be right coprime.\n\n"
