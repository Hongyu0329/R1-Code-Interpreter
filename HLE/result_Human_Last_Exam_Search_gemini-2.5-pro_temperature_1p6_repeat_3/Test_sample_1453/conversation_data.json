    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at positions 'a' and 'd' are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the coiled-coil through \"knobs-into-holes\" packing. The specific amino acids at these positions are the primary determinants of the oligomeric state.\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrophobic Residues and Heptad Repeat:**\n    The provided sequence is `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`. The hydrophobic residues, which are candidates for the 'a' and 'd' positions, are Isoleucine (I), Alanine (A), Leucine (L), and Tryptophan (W). A heptad repeat has hydrophobic residues at positions 'a' and 'd', which are separated by two amino acids (`a`-b-c-`d`). We must find the correct \"reading frame\" for the heptad repeat.\n\n2.  **Determine the Correct Heptad Register:**\n    Let's test possible registers by assigning hydrophobic residues to the 'a' and 'd' positions. A key rule is that 'd' follows 'a' by three residues in the sequence.\n\n    *   **Hypothesis 1:** If we start the heptad with `I` (residue 3) at the 'a' position, the 'd' position would be `S` (residue 6). Serine is polar, so this register is incorrect.\n    *   **Hypothesis 2:** If we start with `A` (residue 4) at the 'a' position, the 'd' position would be `L` (residue 7). This is a valid hydrophobic core. This register yields `(Aa, Ld)` pairs. However, this register places an Isoleucine (I) at the 'g' position (`A(a) Q(b) S(c) L(d) K(e) E(f) I(g)`), which is highly unfavorable as the 'g' position is typically solvent-exposed and occupied by polar residues.\n    *   **Hypothesis 3:** If we start with `L` (residue 7) at the 'a' position, the 'd' position would be `I` (residue 10). This is a valid hydrophobic core. Let's analyze this register further.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Most Plausible Register:**\n    Let's align the full sequence based on Hypothesis 3, where `L(7)` is the first 'a' position.\n\n    *   **Sequence:** `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n    *   **Heptad pos:** `... f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e ...`\n\n    This gives us the following heptads:\n    *   **Heptad 1:** `L(a) K(b) E(c) I(d) A(e) K(f) S(g)`\n    *   **Heptad 2:** `L(a) K(b) E(c) I(d) A(e) W(f) S(g)`\n    *   **Heptad 3:** `L(a) K(b) E(c) I(d) A(e) Q(f) S(g)`\n\n    The hydrophobic core positions are:\n    *   **'a' positions:** Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Leucine (L)\n    *   **'d' positions:** Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I)\n\n4.  **Apply Principles of Knobs-into-Holes Packing:**\n    Pioneering work by Harbury et al. established rules that correlate the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions with the oligomeric state, based on packing efficiency.\n\n    *   **Dimer (2 helices):** Favored by Isoleucine at 'a' and Leucine at 'd' (`Ia-Ld`).\n    *   **Trimer (3 helices):** Favored when 'a' and 'd' are both Isoleucine (`Ia-Id`) or both Leucine (`La-Ld`).\n    *   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Favored by Leucine at 'a' and Isoleucine at 'd' (`La-Id`).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` clearly exhibits a repeating pattern of Leucine at the 'a' positions and Isoleucine at the 'd' positions (`La-Id`). This specific arrangement allows for the most efficient knobs-into-holes packing in a four-helix bundle. Therefore, the protein is predicted to form a tetramer.\n\nThe predicted oligomeric state is 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
