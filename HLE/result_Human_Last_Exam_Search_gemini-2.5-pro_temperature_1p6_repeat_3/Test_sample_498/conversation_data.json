    "The sequence of letters appears to follow the layout of a standard QWERTY keyboard. The letters Z, X, C, V, B, and N are the first six letters on the bottom row of the keyboard, read from left to right.\n\nThe standard bottom row of letters on a QWERTY keyboard is:\n**Z, X, C, V, B, N, M**\n\nAlthough the provided sequence includes an extra \"X\" and a \"Y\", the underlying and most logical pattern points to the letters on the bottom row of the keyboard. Following this pattern, the next letter after \"N\" would be \"M\".\n\n<<<M>>>"
