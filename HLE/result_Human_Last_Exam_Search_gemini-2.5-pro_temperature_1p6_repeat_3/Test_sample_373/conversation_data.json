    "### Defining a Barbell Graph with 10 Nodes\n\nA barbell graph is constructed by connecting two identical complete graphs with a single edge, known as a bridge or bottleneck. For a 10-node barbell graph, this means we have two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each. Let's denote these cliques as K₅(a) and K₅(b). The total number of nodes is 5 in K₅(a) + 5 in K₅(b) = 10 nodes.\n\nThe \"bottleneck edge\" is the single edge that connects one node from K₅(a) to one node from K₅(b).\n\n### Understanding Randomized Uniform Gossiping\n\nIn a randomized uniform gossiping algorithm, the process for exchanging information (a \"gossip\") typically follows two steps:\n1.  A node is selected uniformly at random from all the nodes in the graph.\n2.  This selected node then chooses one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random, to interact with.\n\nThis two-step process defines the probability of any given edge being \"sampled\" for the gossip interaction. The search results confirm that different gossip protocols exist, but the \"randomized uniform gossiping\" implies a uniform probability of a node being activated.\n\n### Calculating the Probability\n\nTo find the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge, we first need to determine the degrees of the nodes in the graph.\n\n1.  **Structure and Node Degrees:**\n    *   In each 5-node clique (K₅), every node is connected to the other 4 nodes within that clique.\n    *   Let's say node `u` in K₅(a) is connected to node `v` in K₅(b) by the bottleneck edge.\n    *   The other 4 nodes in K₅(a) are only connected to nodes within K₅(a). Their degree is 4.\n    *   Similarly, the other 4 nodes in K₅(b) have a degree of 4.\n    *   Node `u` has 4 connections within its own clique and 1 connection to node `v`. Therefore, its degree is 4 + 1 = 5.\n    *   Symmetrically, node `v` also has a degree of 5.\n\n    So, in our 10-node barbell graph, we have:\n    *   8 nodes with a degree of 4.\n    *   2 nodes (the ones connected by the bridge) with a degree of 5.\n\n2.  **Probability Calculation:**\n    The sampling of the bottleneck edge `(u, v)` occurs if one of two mutually exclusive events happens:\n    *   Node `u` is selected and it chooses to gossip with node `v`.\n    *   Node `v` is selected and it chooses to gossip with node `u`.\n\n    We can calculate the probabilities for these events:\n    *   The probability of selecting any specific node from the 10 total nodes is 1/10.\n    *   The probability of node `u` being selected is P(u) = 1/10.\n    *   If `u` is selected, the probability of it choosing neighbor `v` is P(v|u) = 1 / degree(u) = 1/5.\n    *   The probability of node `v` being selected is P(v) = 1/10.\n    *   If `v` is selected, the probability of it choosing neighbor `u` is P(u|v) = 1 / degree(v) = 1/5.\n\n    The total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n\n    P(edge is sampled) = [P(u) * P(v|u)] + [P(v) * P(u|v)]\n    P(edge is sampled) = (1/10 * 1/5) + (1/10 * 1/5)\n    P(edge is sampled) = 1/50 + 1/50\n    P(edge is sampled) = 2/50 = 1/25\n\nThus, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is 1/25.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
