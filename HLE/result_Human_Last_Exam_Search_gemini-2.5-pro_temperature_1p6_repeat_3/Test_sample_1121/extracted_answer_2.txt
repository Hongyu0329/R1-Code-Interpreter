To implement a universal quantum computer on a 2D surface code with a faulty gate error rate of 1%, the approximate number of non-Clifford gates required to produce a single high-fidelity logical non-Clifford gate is:
*   **Distance-3 Code:** Not feasible. The error correction capability is too weak to support the required magic state distillation protocols.
*   **Distance-5 Code:** Approximately **225** initial non-Clifford gates are needed to be consumed in a two-round distillation protocol to produce one high-fidelity logical non-Clifford gate.
