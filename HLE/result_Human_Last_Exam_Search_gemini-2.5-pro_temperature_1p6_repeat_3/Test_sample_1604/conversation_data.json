While many of her famous works depict 19th-century conflicts like the Napoleonic Wars and the Crimean War, she also created several pieces based on World War I. The Charge at Huj was a cavalry charge by units of the British Empire's Egyptian Expeditionary Force against Ottoman and Central Powers forces in Palestine.

Lady Butler's painting immortalized this event.\n\n<<<The Charge at Huj, depicted in the painting \"The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj\".>>>"
