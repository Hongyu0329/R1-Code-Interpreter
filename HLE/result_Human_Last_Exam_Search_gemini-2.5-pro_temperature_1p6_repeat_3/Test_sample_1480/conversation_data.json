    "In a fuzzy logic system, the **rule activation level**, also known as the firing strength or trigger force, is a value that quantifies the degree to which the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of a fuzzy rule is satisfied by a given input. This value is calculated exclusively from the antecedent part of the rule. For rules with multiple antecedent conditions joined by \"AND\", a t-norm operation (such as minimum or product) is used to combine the membership degrees of the inputs for each condition.\n\nIn the context of this question:\n*   `Phi_k(x′)` represents the firing strength of the k-th rule for a given input `x'`. The literature confirms that `Φ_k(x′)` is the result of applying a t-norm operation to all the membership values of the antecedents. The value is explicitly provided as **0.7**.\n*   `μG_k_j(y_j)` represents the membership degree of a value `y_j` in the consequent (the \"THEN\" part) fuzzy set of the rule. This value is used in the subsequent step of the fuzzy inference process, known as implication, to determine the output fuzzy set of the rule. It is not used to calculate the initial rule activation level.\n\nThe question asks for the rule activation level and provides the value of `Phi_k(x′)`, which is, by definition, the rule activation level. The mention of a t-norm operation refers to the process by which `Phi_k(x′)` was calculated from the rule's antecedents. Since the final value is already given, no further calculation is necessary. The value `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9` is extraneous information for this specific calculation.\n\nTherefore, the rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
