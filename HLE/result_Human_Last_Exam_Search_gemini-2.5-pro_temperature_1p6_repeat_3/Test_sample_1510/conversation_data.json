    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups are classified based on their symmetry operations. Each wallpaper group is associated with a point group, which describes the macroscopic symmetry of the pattern, such as rotations and reflections, while ignoring translational symmetry. The order of a point group is the total number of its symmetry operations.\n\nThe four wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2 are:\n*   **p2**: This group has two-fold rotational symmetry and its point group is C₂, which has an order of 2.\n*   **pm**: This group has reflection symmetry and its point group is D₁, which has an order of 2.\n*   **pg**: This group's symmetry is based on glide reflections, and its point group is D₁, with an order of 2.\n*   **cm**: This group contains reflections and its point group is also D₁, which has an order of 2.\n\nOther wallpaper groups have point groups with orders different from 2, ranging from 1 (for p1) to 12 (for p6m).\n\n<<<4>>>"
