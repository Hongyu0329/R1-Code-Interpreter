    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in five different colors: white, red, violet, black, and blue.\n\nThe most common allotropes are white and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is a waxy, transparent solid that appears colorless or white, but can turn light yellow over time due to aging or impurities, which is why it is sometimes referred to as yellow phosphorus. Red phosphorus has a dark red color and can have an iron-grey luster.\n\nOther well-established allotropes include violet and black phosphorus. Violet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, is a stable crystalline form that is red/purple in color. Black phosphorus is the most stable form and has a black, flaky appearance similar to graphite.\n\nMore recently, blue phosphorus has been identified as a distinct allotrope. It is a two-dimensional material that was theoretically predicted in 2014 and later successfully created in a lab.\n\nTherefore, the observable colors in pure phosphorus allotropes are white, red, violet, black, and blue.\n\n<<<5>>>"
