    "The human GABAAρ1 receptor, also known as Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit rho-1, is a protein encoded by the GABRR1 gene. Its structure, like other GABAA receptor subunits, consists of a large extracellular N-terminal domain, four transmembrane domains (TM1, TM2, TM3, and TM4), and a large intracellular loop connecting the third and fourth transmembrane domains.\n\nThe full amino acid sequence of the human GABAAρ1 receptor (UniProt accession number P24046) is composed of 479 residues. The transmembrane domains are located at approximately the following positions:\n*   **TM1:** 251-272\n*   **TM2:** 283-306\n*   **TM3:** 323-345\n*   **TM4:** 451-473\n\nThe TM3-TM4 linker is the intracellular domain that spans the region between the end of TM3 and the beginning of TM4. Therefore, this linker corresponds to residues 346 to 450 of the protein sequence.\n\nAnalysis of the amino acid sequence of this specific TM3-TM4 linker region reveals the presence of one Cysteine residue at position 395.\n\n<<<1>>>"
