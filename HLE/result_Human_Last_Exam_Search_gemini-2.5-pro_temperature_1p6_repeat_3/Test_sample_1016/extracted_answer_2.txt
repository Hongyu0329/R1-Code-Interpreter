The number of iterations `N` required for the Schwarz Relaxation Method to converge up to the time instant `T` is given by the formula:

`N = ceil(T * c / M)`

where:
*   `T` is the final time instant.
*   `c` is the propagation speed of the wave.
*   `M` is the size of the overlap (`M = b - a`).
*   `ceil()` is the ceiling function, which rounds a number up to the next greatest integer.

This result stems from the fact that information (and thus, correctness of the solution) propagates across the overlap region of size `M` with speed `c`. Each iteration correctly resolves the solution for an additional time interval of `M/c`. Therefore, to cover the entire time interval `[0, T]`, `T / (M/c)` iterations are required, and since the number of iterations must be an integer, the ceiling function is used.
