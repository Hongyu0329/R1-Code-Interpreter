    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that transforms aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. The reaction involves a triphenyl phosphonium ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent, reacting with a carbonyl compound. The driving force behind this reaction is the formation of the highly stable triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\nThe reactants in this specific case are:\n*   **Pivalaldehyde:** An aldehyde with the systematic name 2,2-dimethylpropanal. It has the chemical structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane:** This is the phosphorus ylide. Its structure consists of a triphenylphosphine group attached to an ethylidene chain, which is substituted with a 2-chlorophenyl group. The structure is (C₆H₅)₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-Cl).\n\nIn the Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the aldehyde is replaced by the carbon group of the ylide. This forms a new carbon-carbon double bond at the location of the original carbonyl group.\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n(CH₃)₃C-CHO + (C₆H₅)₃P=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄) → (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄) + (C₆H₅)₃P=O\n\nThe resulting alkene product needs to be named according to IUPAC nomenclature. The longest carbon chain containing the double bond has five carbons, making it a pentene. Numbering the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number, we start from the end that gives the double bond position 2. This leads to the following name: **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nThe stereochemistry of the alkene (E/Z configuration) depends on the nature of the ylide. Ylides are classified as stabilized or unstabilized.\n*   **Stabilized ylides** (with electron-withdrawing groups) typically yield (E)-alkenes.\n*   **Unstabilized ylides** (with alkyl or hydrogen groups) typically yield (Z)-alkenes.\n\nThe ylide in this reaction, PPh₃=CH-CH₂-Ar, is considered unstabilized because the group attached to the double-bonded carbon is an alkyl-type group (-CH₂-Ar), not a significant electron-withdrawing group. Therefore, the major product is expected to be the Z-isomer.\n\nAssigning priorities based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules around the double bond:\n*   At C2: -CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄) > H\n*   At C3: -C(CH₃)₃ > H\n\nFor the Z-isomer, the two higher-priority groups are on the same side of the double bond.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<<**(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**>>>"
