    "A self-avoiding walk is a sequence of moves on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The term \"Manhattan lattice\" is commonly used to refer to a square grid, representing the layout of streets in Manhattan. For a self-avoiding walk, the number of possible paths of a given length `n` is denoted by a(n).\n\nThe number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice is a well-studied sequence in combinatorics and physics. This sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411.\n\nFor a 10-step self-avoiding walk on a Manhattan (square) lattice, the value of a(10) is 44,100. The sequence of values for a(n) for small `n` is:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   a(10) = 44,100\n\nThis value is found through direct enumeration, which becomes computationally intensive for larger values of `n`.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
