The homotopy-theoretic obstructions for $\phi_t$ and $\psi_t$ to be homotopic are determined by the algebraic structure of the group $\pi_1(\text{Aut}(E))$. This group is built from the following list of groups:

*   $H_{n-1}(X)$
*   $\pi_1(SO(2k))$
*   $\pi_2(SO(2k))$
*   $\pi_n(SO(2k))$
*   $\pi_{n+1}(SO(2k))$
