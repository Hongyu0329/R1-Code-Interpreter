    "To find the separatrix of the system of differential equations, we first need to identify the equilibrium points and their stability. The separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors, and it is typically associated with the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\n**1. Find the equilibrium points**\n\nWe set $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we find the possible values for $u$ are $u=0$ and $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0(1-0)(0)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$\n    This gives the equilibrium point $(0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n    $2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    This gives the equilibrium points $(0, 1)$ and $(-1, 1)$.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the upper half-plane ($u \\ge 0$) are $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(-1, 1)$.\n\n**2. Analyze the stability of the equilibrium points**\n\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(d, u)$:\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3+10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we evaluate the Jacobian at each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **At (0, 0):** $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2 = 0$. This is a degenerate case where linearization is inconclusive.\n*   **At (0, 1):** $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & (-3+10(1))(0) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both eigenvalues are real and positive, $(0, 1)$ is an **unstable node**.\n*   **At (-1, 1):** $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & (-3+10(1))(-1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs, $(-1, 1)$ is a **saddle point**.\n\n**3. Find the separatrix**\n\nThe separatrix is formed by the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point $(-1, 1)$. Let's look for an invariant manifold, which is a curve that is a union of trajectories. We can test if a simple relation between $d$ and $u$ satisfies the system.\n\nLet's test the curve $d = -u^2$. To see if this is a trajectory of the system, we differentiate it with respect to $t$:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}(d) = \\frac{d}{dt}(-u^2)$\n$d' = -2u \\cdot u'$\nSince $u' = (u-1)u^2$, we have:\n$d' = -2u((u-1)u^2) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$\n\nNow, we substitute $d = -u^2$ into the original equation for $d'(t)$:\n$d' = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u(1-u)u^2$\n$d' = 2u^4 + (3u^3-5u^4) - (u^3-u^4)$\n$d' = 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$\n$d' = (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$\n\nThe two expressions for $d'$ are identical. This confirms that the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold of the system.\n\nLet's check if this curve passes through the saddle point $(-1, 1)$.\nFor $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. So, the curve $d=-u^2$ passes through the saddle point $(-1, 1)$.\n\nAn invariant curve passing through a saddle point must be one of its manifolds (stable or unstable). The unstable manifold of a saddle point is a classic example of a separatrix. Let's verify the direction of the flow on this curve.\nThe dynamics on the curve are governed by $u' = u^2(u-1)$.\n*   For $u \\in (0, 1)$, $u' < 0$, so $u$ decreases with time. The trajectory moves from $u=1$ (the saddle point) towards $u=0$.\n*   For $u > 1$, $u' > 0$, so $u$ increases with time. The trajectory moves away from $u=1$ towards infinity.\n\nSince trajectories on this curve move away from the saddle point $(-1, 1)$ for both $u>1$ and $u<1$, the curve $d = -u^2$ represents the unstable manifold of the saddle point. Unstable manifolds of saddle points are separatrices as they separate the phase plane into regions of different dynamical behavior.\n\nThus, the separatrix of the system is the parabola given by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n"
