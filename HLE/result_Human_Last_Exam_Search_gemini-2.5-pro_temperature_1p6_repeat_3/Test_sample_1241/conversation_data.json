    "To find the steady-state probabilities $P_i(+\\infty)$, which we will denote as $P_i$, we need to solve the given system of differential equations with the derivatives set to zero. This results in a system of linear algebraic equations. The name \"Kolmogorov-Chepmen\" appears to be a slight misspelling of the \"Chapman-Kolmogorov\" equations, which are fundamental in the study of Markov processes.\n\nThe given system of equations is:\n1. $P_{0}'(t) = -0.019 P_{0}(t) + 0.65 P_{1}(t)$\n2. $P_{1}'(t) = -0.019 P_{0}(t) - (0.65 + 0.4) P_{1}(t) + 0.392 P_{2}(t) + 0.008 P_{3}(t)$\n3. $P_{2}'(t) = 0.4 P_{1}(t) - (0.392 + 0.008) P_{2}(t)$\n4. $P_{3}'(t) = 0.008 P_{2}(t) - 0.008 P_{3}(t)$\n5. $P_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1$\n\nFor the stationary (or steady-state) solution, we set the derivatives to zero: $P_i'(t) = 0$.\nHowever, a direct analysis of the system as written reveals an inconsistency. Summing the first four equations yields the derivative of the total probability:\n$(P_0+P_1+P_2+P_3)' = -0.038 P_0$.\nThe fifth equation states that the total probability is always 1, which implies its derivative must be zero. This forces $P_0(t) = 0$ for all $t$. This, in turn, leads to a cascade of consequences starting with $P_1(t)=0$ (from the first equation), and ultimately leads to a contradiction with the condition that the probabilities must sum to 1.\n\nThis inconsistency strongly suggests a typographical error in the second equation. In the standard Kolmogorov forward equations for a continuous-time Markov chain, the term representing flow from state 0 to state 1 would be positive. The correct form of the second equation should be:\n$P_{1}'(t) = +0.019 P_{0}(t) - (0.65 + 0.4) P_{1}(t) + 0.392 P_{2}(t) + 0.008 P_{3}(t)$\n\nAssuming this correction, we solve the following system of linear equations for the steady-state probabilities $P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3$:\n1. $0 = -0.019 P_0 + 0.65 P_1$\n2. $0 = 0.019 P_0 - 1.05 P_1 + 0.392 P_2 + 0.008 P_3$\n3. $0 = 0.4 P_1 - 0.4 P_2$\n4. $0 = 0.008 P_2 - 0.008 P_3$\n5. $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n\nFrom equation (3), we get $P_1 = P_2$.\nFrom equation (4), we get $P_2 = P_3$.\nTherefore, we have $P_1 = P_2 = P_3$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 P_0 = 0.65 P_1 \\implies P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 = \\frac{650}{19} P_1$.\n\nNow, we use the normalization condition (equation 5):\n$P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of $P_1$:\n$\\frac{650}{19} P_1 + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19} + 3) P_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}) P_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19} P_1 = 1 \\implies P_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$.\n\nNow we can find $P_0$:\n$P_0 = \\frac{650}{19} P_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = P_0 + P_1$:\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$.\n\nThis fraction can be approximated as a decimal:\n$669 \\div 707 \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{669}{707}}$."
