    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$, we first analyze the conductor $d$.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nThe conductor is $d = 53599$. Its prime factorization is determined as follows:\n$d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThe conductor is a product of four distinct odd primes.\n\n### Step 2: Properties of Primitive Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo a square-free integer $d = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_k$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of non-principal characters $\\chi_i$ modulo each prime factor $p_i$.\n$\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$\nFor $\\chi$ to be primitive with conductor $d$, each component character $\\chi_p$ must be a primitive character for its respective modulus $p$. For a prime modulus, a character is primitive if and only if it is not the principal character (the character that is 1 for all integers coprime to p). This means the order of each $\\chi_p$ must be greater than 1.\n\n### Step 3: The Order of the Character\nThe order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the individual characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31}))$.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\n\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The order of any character $\\chi_p$ must divide $p-1$. Let $k_p = \\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$. The condition $\\text{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31}) = 6$ implies that each $k_p$ must be a divisor of 6. Let's check if this is consistent with the condition that $k_p$ divides $p-1$:\n*   For $p=7$, $p-1 = 6$. The divisors of 6 are divisors of 6.\n*   For $p=13$, $p-1 = 12$. The divisors of 6 are divisors of 12.\n*   For $p=19$, $p-1 = 18$. The divisors of 6 are divisors of 18.\n*   For $p=31$, $p-1 = 30$. The divisors of 6 are divisors of 30.\n\nSince each $\\chi_p$ must be non-principal, its order $k_p$ must be greater than 1. Thus, for each prime $p$, the order $k_p$ must be chosen from the set of divisors of 6 that are greater than 1, i.e., $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Characters\nFor a prime $p$, the number of characters of a specific order $k$ (where $k$ divides $p-1$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n\nFor each of the four primes ($7, 13, 19, 31$), the number of available characters of orders 2, 3, or 6 is $1+2+2 = 5$. If we form a character $\\chi$ by picking one such character for each prime factor of $d$, there is a total of $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$ possible combinations.\n\nThese combinations result in a character $\\chi$ whose order is $\\text{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31})$, which can be 2, 3, or 6. We need to exclude the cases where the order is 2 or 3.\n\n*   **Case 1: The order of $\\chi$ is 2.**\n    This occurs if the lcm of the orders of the component characters is 2. This implies that the order of each component character $\\chi_p$ must be a divisor of 2. Since the order must be greater than 1, each $k_p$ must be 2. There is only $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2 for each prime. Thus, there is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$ character of order 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: The order of $\\chi$ is 3.**\n    This occurs if the lcm of the orders of the component characters is 3. This requires the order of each component character to be a divisor of 3. As the order must be greater than 1, each $k_p$ must be 3. There are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3 for each prime. Thus, there are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$ characters of order 3.\n\nThe remaining characters among the 625 combinations must have an order of 6. This is because the order of each component is a divisor of 6, ensuring the lcm is also a divisor of 6. For the lcm to be 6, there must be at least one component character whose order is a multiple of 2 and at least one whose order is a multiple of 3. The calculation subtracts the cases where all orders are only divisible by 2 or only by 3.\n\nNumber of characters of order 6 = (Total combinations) - (Number of characters of order 2) - (Number of characters of order 3)\nNumber of characters of order 6 = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
