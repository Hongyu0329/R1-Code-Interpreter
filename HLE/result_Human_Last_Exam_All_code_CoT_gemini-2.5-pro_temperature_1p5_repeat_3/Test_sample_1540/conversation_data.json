    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Core Task:** The main goal is to find the memory usage, `m`, for the most memory-efficient C program that solves the string comparison problem.\n2.  **Determine C Memory Requirements:**\n    *   To solve the problem, we must read both strings from the input. The maximum length is 100, so we need buffers of size 101 to include the null terminator. This gives us `char str1[101];` and `char str2[101];`.\n    *   These two arrays will consume `101 + 101 = 202` bytes.\n    *   Next, we need to compare them. The most memory-efficient way is to use a standard library function like `strcasecmp` which performs a case-insensitive comparison and returns an integer. Storing this integer result requires one `int` variable.\n    *   On a typical 32-bit or 64-bit system, an `int` takes 4 bytes.\n    *   Therefore, the total memory `m` is the sum of the memory for the two strings and the integer result.\n3.  **Formulate Python Code:** I will provide a Python script as requested. This script will perform two functions as per the instructions:\n    *   It will correctly solve the string comparison problem.\n    *   It will print out the step-by-step calculation for the memory usage `m` of the C program, including each number in the final equation.\n4.  **Final Answer:** I will provide the final calculated value of `m` in the required `<<<...>>>` format.\n\nHere is the Python script to solve the problem and explain the memory calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_and_explain_memory():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Petya and Strings problem and explains the memory\n    calculation for an equivalent, memory-efficient C program.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Read the two strings from standard input\n        str1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        str2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n        # Convert to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\n        s1_lower = str1.lower()\n        s2_lower = str2.lower()\n\n        # Perform the comparison and print the result\n        if s1_lower < s2_lower:\n            print(\"-1\")\n        elif s1_lower > s2_lower:\n            print(\"1\")\n        else:\n            print(\"0\")\n\n    except IndexError:\n        # Handle cases where input is not provided, for explanation purposes.\n        print(\"0\")\n        print(\"\\n--- Note: Running without input.
