    "Of course. I can help with that. Here is my plan to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants to find the upper bound for the maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$) in relation to the covolume ($V$) for lattices associated with squarefree natural numbers ($N$).\n2.  **Identify the Mathematical Context:** The problem deals with the geometry of numbers. Lattices derived from the ring of integers of a real quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$ (where $N$ is a squarefree integer) are 2-dimensional ($n=2$).\n3.  **Apply Minkowski's Theorem:** I will use Minkowski's first theorem on convex bodies. This theorem provides a fundamental link between the volume of a convex, centrally symmetric set and its ability to contain a non-zero point from a given lattice.\n4.  **Derive the Inequality:** I will apply the theorem to a specific convex body related to the maximum norm (infinity norm): a square centered at the origin. The volume of this square will be compared to the lattice's covolume $V$, leading to a direct inequality. This inequality will give the upper bound for the maximum norm of the shortest non-zero vector in the lattice.\n5.  **Construct the Python Script:** I will write a Python script that programmatically shows the derivation steps and prints out the final equation for the upper bound, displaying each component of the formula as requested.\n\nHere is the Python script to execute.\n\n```python\ndef find_upper_bound_relation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script derives and prints the upper bound for the maximum norm (k_{k,inf})\n    in relation to the covolume (V) for a 2-dimensional lattice.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The problem concerns lattices from real quadratic fields, so the dimension n is 2.\n    n = 2\n    V_symbol = \"V\"\n    k_symbol = \"k_{k,inf}\"\n\n    print(\"The upper bound is derived from Minkowski's theorem on convex bodies.\")\n    print(f\"For a lattice of dimension 'n' and covolume '{V_symbol}', the maximum norm of the shortest non-zero vector (denoted '{k_symbol}') satisfies the inequality:\")\n    print(f\"{k_symbol}^n <= {V_symbol}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    print(f\"In the context of squarefree natural numbers (N), the associated lattices are 2-dimensional, so we set n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"Substituting n into the general inequality, we get:\")\n    print(f\"{k_symbol}^{n} <= {V_symbol}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    print(\"To find the upper bound for the norm, we solve for it by taking the n-th root of both sides.\")\n    print(f\"This results in: {k_symbol} <= {V_symbol}^(1/{n})\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    print(\"So, the final equation expressing the upper bound is:\")\n    # Print each part of the final equation as requested\n    print(k_symbol, end=' ')\n    print(\"<=\", end=' ')\n    print(f\"sqrt({V_symbol})\")\n\nfind_upper_bound_relation()\n```\n<<<\\sqrt{V}>>>"
