    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given a smooth projective curve `C` of genus `g=3`.\n    *   We have `X = C^{(15)}`, the 15th symmetric power of `C`. This is the space of effective divisors of degree 15 on `C`.\n    *   We need to find the smallest and largest possible integer values for the rank of the Neron-Severi group of `X`, denoted `ρ(X)`.\n\n2.  **Find a Formula for `ρ(X)`:**\n    The rank of the Neron-Severi group of a symmetric power of a curve, `ρ(C^{(d)})`, is related to the invariants of the curve `C` itself and its Jacobian variety `J(C)`. The key result, derived from the behavior of the cohomology groups, states that for `d ≥ 1`:\n\n    `ρ(C^{(d)}) = ρ(C) + ρ(J(C))`\n\n    This formula holds because the second cohomology group of `C^{(d)}` (which contains the Neron-Severi group) splits into parts corresponding to `C` and `J(C)`: `H^2(C^{(d)}, ℚ) ≅ H^2(C, ℚ) ⊕ H^2(J(C), ℚ)`. This decomposition respects the algebraic cycles that constitute the Neron-Severi group.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Term in the Formula:**\n    *   `d = 15` and `g = 3`.\n    *   **`ρ(C)`:** For any smooth projective curve `C`, its Neron-Severi group is generated by the class of a point. Thus, its rank is always 1. So, `ρ(C) = 1`.\n    *   **`ρ(J(C))`:** `J(C)` is the Jacobian of `C`, which is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension `g=3`. The rank of its Neron-Severi group, `ρ(J(C))`, is not fixed; it depends on the specific geometry of the curve `C`, particularly on the structure of the endomorphism ring of its Jacobian, `End(J(C))`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Range of `ρ(J(C))`:**\n    For an abelian variety `A` of dimension `g`, the rank `ρ(A)` is bounded by `1 ≤ ρ(A) ≤ g^2`. In our case, `g=3`, so `1 ≤ ρ(J(C)) ≤ 3^2 = 9`.\n\n    *   **Smallest `ρ(J(C))`:** The minimum value `ρ(J(C)) = 1` is achieved. This occurs when `J(C)` has the smallest possible endomorphism ring, `End(J(C)) = ℤ`. Such Jacobians are called \"simple\" or \"without complex multiplication\". This is the case for a \"very general\" curve `C` in the moduli space of genus 3 curves.\n    *   **Largest `ρ(J(C))`:** The maximum value `ρ(J(C)) = g^2 = 9` is achieved if `J(C)` is an abelian variety with Complex Multiplication (CM). For this to happen, `J(C)` must be isogenous to a product of `g` CM elliptic curves. For `g=3`, such curves exist. A famous example is the Fermat quartic curve, `x^4 + y^4 = z^4`, which is a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian has `ρ(J(C)) = 9`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    Now we can substitute the minimum and maximum values of `ρ(J(C))` back into our formula for `ρ(X)`.\n\n    *   **Smallest Rank of `NS(X)`:**\n        `ρ(X)_min = ρ(C) + ρ(J(C))_min = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    *   **Largest Rank of `NS(X)`:**\n        `ρ(X)_max = ρ(C) + ρ(J(C))_max = 1 + 9 = 10`\n\nThis step-by-step process allows us to find the two extremal values for the rank of the Neron-Severi group of `X`.\n\n```python\n# The genus of the Riemann surface C.\ng = 3\n# The degree of the symmetric power X = C^(d).\nd = 15\n\n# We want to find the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi\n# group of X, denoted ρ(X).\n\n# The key formula relates the rank of the Neron-Severi group of a symmetric power\n# of a curve, ρ(C^(d)), to the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the curve C\n# itself, ρ(C), and that of its Jacobian variety, ρ(J(C)).\n# The formula is: ρ(C^(d)) = ρ(C) + ρ(J(C)).\n\n# For any smooth projective curve C, the Neron-Severi group is generated by the\n# class of a point, so its rank is always 1.\nrho_C = 1\n\n# The Jacobian J(C) is a g-dimensional abelian variety.
