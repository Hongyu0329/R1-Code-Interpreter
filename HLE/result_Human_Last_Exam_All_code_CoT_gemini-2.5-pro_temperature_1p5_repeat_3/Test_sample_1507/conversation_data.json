    "To find the number of visible triangles on the great icosahedron, we need to consider its convex hull.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify the geometric shape:** The problem is about the \"great icosahedron\". This is a non-convex regular polyhedron, also known as a Kepler-Poinsot polyhedron.\n2.  **Understand the \"outer-hull\":** The \"outer-hull\" refers to the convex hull of the shape. The convex hull is the smallest convex shape that contains the original object. For the great icosahedron, its convex hull is a **regular icosahedron**.\n3.  **Analyze the \"visible triangles\":** The triangles visible from the outside are the faces of this convex hull (the regular icosahedron).\n4.  **Properties of a regular icosahedron:** A regular icosahedron is one of the five Platonic solids. It is composed of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces.\n5.  **Triangulation:** The problem asks for the \"minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull\". Since the faces of the regular icosahedron are already triangles, no further triangulation is necessary. The minimal number of triangles is simply the number of faces it has.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The number of visible triangles is the number of faces of a regular icosahedron, which is 20.\n\nThe following Python code will state this fact and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_great_icosahedron_triangles():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of visible triangles on the outer-hull of a great icosahedron.\n\n    The outer-hull (or convex hull) of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n    A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid that has 20 faces.\n    Each face of a regular icosahedron is an equilateral triangle.\n\n    Therefore, the number of visible triangles from the outside is equal to the\n    number of faces of a regular icosahedron.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Number of faces of a regular icosahedron\n    num_faces = 20\n    \n    print(\"The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\n    print(\"The number of faces (which are triangles) on a regular icosahedron is:\")\n    print(num_faces)\n\nsolve_great_icosahedron_triangles()\n```\n<<<20>>>"
