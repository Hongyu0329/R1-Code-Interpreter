        "3. Hypothesis: The process of DNA replication and repair is thought to be central to this somatic instability.",
        "4. Key Protein: DNA Ligase I (LIG1) is the primary enzyme responsible for joining Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand during DNA replication and is also involved in some DNA repair pathways.",
        "5. Experimental Evidence: Studies using mouse models of DM1 have shown that reducing the activity of LIG1 (creating a hypomorphic, or partially functional, state) has a direct effect on the stability of the CTG repeats.",
        "6. Core Finding: In mouse models with reduced LIG1 function, there was a significant decrease in the age-dependent somatic expansion of the CTG repeats. The repeats were more stable.",
        "7. Mechanism: This suggests that the ligation step carried out by LIG1 is a crucial part of the molecular pathway that leads to repeat expansions. An alternative, more stable repair/ligation pathway is likely used when LIG1 is deficient.",
