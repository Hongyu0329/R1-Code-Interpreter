    This function determines the most realistic upper bound for connected,
    epsilon-envy-free cake cutting among four agents based on recent research.

    The problem of finding a finite, bounded algorithm for envy-free cake cutting
    with connected pieces for more than 3 agents was a major open problem for decades.

    An algorithm that solves the exact envy-free problem (envy = 0) also solves the
    epsilon-envy-free problem (envy < epsilon) for any epsilon > 0. Therefore, the
    bound for the exact case is a valid upper bound.

    Recent breakthroughs have established finite bounds on the number of queries
    (cuts or evaluations) required. While a 2020 paper established a bound of 203,
    a subsequent 2022 paper provided a significant improvement.

    According to the work by McGlaughlin and Su (2022), a new protocol reduces
    the number of required queries substantially. Their result is considered the
    current state-of-the-art.

    The equation for this upper bound, O, is simply a constant derived from their proof.
