    "To find the A($\\alpha$) stability angle for the BDF4 method, we need to analyze its stability region. The boundary of the stability region is given by the curve $z(\\theta) = \\rho(e^{i\\theta}) / \\sigma(e^{i\\theta})$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$, where $\\rho(\\xi)$ and $\\sigma(\\xi)$ are the characteristic polynomials of the method.\n\nThe A($\\alpha$)-stability angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the ray from the origin that is tangent to this boundary. The angle of this tangent ray is $\\pi - \\alpha$. This occurs at a point $z(\\theta_0)$ on the boundary where the argument of $z(\\theta)$ has an extremum, which translates to the condition that the vector to the point $z(\\theta_0)$ is parallel to the tangent vector $z'(\\theta_0)$.\n\nThis geometric condition can be expressed analytically. For a BDF-k method, it leads to a polynomial equation for $c = \\cos(\\theta_0)$.\n\nHere are the steps to find the exact value of $\\alpha$:\n1.  **Define the BDF4 method's polynomials:** The BDF4 method has the characteristic polynomial $\\rho(\\xi) = \\frac{25}{12}\\xi^4 - 4\\xi^3 + 3\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi + \\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\sigma(\\xi) = \\xi^4$.\n2.  **Formulate the tangency condition:** The condition for the tangent to the stability boundary passing through the origin is equivalent to finding $\\theta_0$ that satisfies $\\text{Re}[\\rho(e^{-i\\theta_0})(\\xi\\rho'(\\xi)-4\\rho(\\xi))|_{\\xi=e^{i\\theta_0}}] = 0$.\n3.  **Solve for $\\cos(\\theta_0)$:** This condition simplifies to a remarkably simple polynomial equation for $c = \\cos(\\theta_0)$:\n    $2c^2 - 8c + 5 = 0$.\n    Solving this quadratic equation gives two roots, but only one is a valid cosine value (i.e., $|c| \\le 1$). This gives the value of $c_0 = \\cos(\\theta_0)$.\n4.  **Calculate the stability angle $\\alpha$:** The stability angle $\\alpha$ is related to the point $z(\\theta_0) = x_0 + iy_0$ on the boundary by the relation $\\alpha = \\pi - \\arg(z(\\theta_0))$. This implies that $\\tan(\\alpha) = -\\tan(\\arg(z(\\theta_0))) = -y_0/x_0$.\n5.  **Express $\\tan(\\alpha)$:** We express $x_0 = \\text{Re}(z(\\theta_0))$ and $y_0 = \\text{Im}(z(\\theta_0))$ in terms of $c_0 = \\cos(\\theta_0)$ and $s_0 = \\sin(\\theta_0)$ and compute the exact value of the ratio $-y_0/x_0$.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform these symbolic calculations and find the exact value for $\\tan(\\alpha)$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_bdf4_stability_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the exact value for tan(alpha) for the A(alpha)-stability of BDF4.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbol for c = cos(theta)\n    c = sp.Symbol('c')\n\n    # 1.
