    Analyzes the necessary assumptions for the expected information gain of a Bayesian agent to approach zero.

    The problem asks for the necessary assumptions to prove that the expected information gain,
    E[KL(posterior_{t+1} || posterior_t)], converges to zero as time t -> infinity.

    1.  The total expected information gain is the sum of the per-step expected information gains.
    2.  This sum is equivalent to the mutual information between the model parameters and the entire history of observations, I(Model; Data).
    3.  Mutual information is bounded by the entropy of the prior distribution over models, H(Model).
    4.  Therefore, the sum of all expected information gains is bounded:  Σ EIG_t ≤ H(Model).
    5.  For a sum of non-negative terms (EIG_t ≥ 0) to be bounded (converge), the terms themselves must approach zero.
    6.  This entire argument relies on the bound H(Model) being a finite number.

    Therefore, the crucial assumption is that the prior has finite entropy (a).
    The other options are either not necessary or are consequences rather than assumptions.

    The final answer is 'a'. We need to express this in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).
    - A single literal like 'a' becomes a clause '(a)'.
    - A single clause becomes a conjunction by wrapping it in square brackets.
    - Result: [(a)]
