    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Theoretical Framework**: The problem will be solved using the principles of statistical mechanics for a photon gas, which follows Bose-Einstein statistics with zero chemical potential. The connection to the requested large deviation theorems is as follows:\n    *   **Boltzmann's Principle and Sanov's Theorem**: Boltzmann's principle, `S = k_B log(W)`, states that entropy (`S`) is proportional to the logarithm of the number of microstates (`W`) for a given macrostate. Sanov's theorem relates the probability of an empirical measure to the Kullback-Leibler divergence, an entropy-like quantity. In essence, both theories establish that the most probable macroscopic state—the equilibrium state—is the one that maximizes entropy, subject to physical constraints (like a fixed average energy).\n    *   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem**: This theorem describes the probability of large deviations for a sum of i.i.d. random variables. Its mathematical structure is formally identical to the relationship between the partition function (`Z`), free energy (`F`), and other thermodynamic variables in statistical mechanics. The probability of a system being in a state with energy `E` at a temperature `T` is proportional to `exp(-F/k_B T)`, where `F=E-TS`. Finding the equilibrium state by minimizing the free energy (`F`) is equivalent to finding the state that minimizes the Cramer-Chernoff rate function.\n\n2.  **Calculation Steps**:\n    *   We will start with the grand canonical partition function (`Ξ`) for a photon gas, which is the cornerstone for deriving thermodynamic properties in this framework. This involves integrating over all energy states, using the density of states `g(ε)` for photons in a 3D box.\n    *   The equilibrium mean energy `<E>` is then derived by taking the negative derivative of the logarithm of the partition function with respect to `β = 1/(k_B T)`. This calculation leads to the famous Stefan-Boltzmann law for total energy.\n    *   Finally, the equilibrium entropy `S` is calculated using the standard thermodynamic relation involving energy and the partition function: `S = (<E> + k_B T * log(Ξ))/T`.\n\n3.  **Code Implementation**: The Python script below will not perform symbolic calculus but will present the final, derived equations for the mean energy `<E>` and entropy `S`. It will construct these equations as formatted strings to clearly show their dependence on temperature (`T`), volume (`V`), and fundamental physical constants.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bose_light_quanta():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the equilibrium values (formulas) for mean energy and entropy\n    of a photon gas (Bose case for light quanta).\n\n    The derivation uses the grand canonical partition function for a gas of bosons with\n    zero chemical potential, which is consistent with the principles of large deviation theory.\n\n    - Mean Energy <E> is derived from -d(log(Ξ))/dβ.\n    - Entropy S is derived from S = (<E> - Ω)/T, where Ω = -k_B*T*log(Ξ).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define symbolic representations of the physical constants and variables.\n    k_B = \"k_B\"  # Boltzmann constant\n    h = \"h\"      # Planck's constant\n    c = \"c\"      # Speed of light\n    V = \"V\"      # Volume\n    T = \"T\"      # Temperature\n    pi = \"pi\"    # Mathematical constant pi\n\n    # The integral ∫[0, inf] x^3 / (e^x - 1) dx evaluates to pi^4 / 15.\n    # The density of states g(ε) for photons is proportional to ε^2.\n    # These facts are used in the derivation.\n\n    # Assemble the expression for the radiation constant 'a'\n    # a = (8 * pi^5 * k_B^4) / (15 * h^3 * c^3)\n    energy_coefficient_numerator = f\"8 * {pi}^5 * {k_B}^4\"\n    energy_coefficient_denominator = f\"15 * {h}^3 * {c}^3\"\n    \n    # Final formula for Mean Energy <E> (Stefan-Boltzmann Law for energy)\n    # The numbers in the equation are 8, 5, 4, 15, 3, 3.\n    mean_energy_eq = f\"<E> = ({energy_coefficient_numerator} / ({energy_coefficient_denominator})) * {V} * {T}^4\"\n    \n    # The entropy S is related to energy by S = (4/3) * <E> / T\n    # So, the coefficient for entropy is (4/3) times the coefficient for <E>/T.\n    # (4/3) * (8 * pi^5 * k_B^4 / (15 * h^3 * c^3)) = (32 * pi^5 * k_B^4 / (45 * h^3 * c^3))\n    entropy_coefficient_numerator = f\"32 * {pi}^5 * {k_B}^4\"\n    entropy_coefficient_denominator = f\"45 * {h}^3 * {c}^3\"\n    \n    # Final formula for Entropy S\n    # The numbers in the equation are 32, 5, 4, 45, 3, 3.\n    entropy_eq = f\"S = ({entropy_coefficient_numerator} / ({entropy_coefficient_denominator})) * {V} * {T}^3\"\n\n    print(\"The equilibrium values are functions of temperature (T) and volume (V).\")\n    print(\"They are derived from the partition function, a method whose validity is supported by large deviation theorems.\\n\")\n    print(\"--- Equilibrium Mean Energy <E> ---\")\n    print(mean_energy_eq)\n    print(\"\\n--- Equilibrium Entropy S ---\")\n    print(entropy_eq)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_bose_light_quanta()\n```\n<<<Mean Energy <E> = (8 * pi^5 * k_B^4 / (15 * h^3 * c^3)) * V * T^4, Entropy S = (32 * pi^5 * k_B^4 / (45 * h^3 * c^3)) * V * T^3>>>"
