    A. Use minimum-length transistors with a small gate capacitor (~1 pF).
    - Analysis: This prioritizes fast reset (Challenge 3) due to the low capacitance and high drive strength (large W). However, minimum-length devices are prone to high subthreshold leakage and short-channel effects, which directly oppose the goal of a stable, high resistance. Furthermore, any charge injection from reset switching will cause a large voltage disturbance on the small capacitor, harming stability (Challenge 1 & 4).
    - Verdict: Poor balance. Sacrifices core high-resistance performance for speed.
    """

    analysis_b = """
    B. Split the gate capacitor into multiple refreshed segments.
    - Analysis: This is an attempt to mitigate leakage (Challenge 4) by reducing the hold time for any single capacitor. However, this introduces significant complexity with clocks and switches. The switches themselves add noise, clock feedthrough, and charge injection, which creates instability and potential offset steps, working against stable biasing.
    - Verdict: Overly complex and introduces new noise and stability problems.
    """

    analysis_c = """
    C. Use an on-chip body-bias generator to raise the threshold voltage.
    - Analysis: The stated goal is to raise Vt. While this reduces subthreshold current for a given Vgs, it exacerbates the main problem: limited headroom at 1.2V (Challenge 1). Raising Vt from 0.45V leaves even less room for the gate voltage to operate between the threshold and the supply rail, making it much harder to accommodate the +/-100mV sensor offset (Challenge 2).
    - Verdict: Detrimental to the critical headroom and offset tolerance requirements.
    """

    analysis_d = """
    D. Replace bootstrapping with high-impedance current mirrors.
    - Analysis: This completely solves capacitor leakage (Challenge 4) by removing the capacitor. However, it abandons the bootstrapping principle. With a fixed gate voltage, a +/-100mV change in the input signal/offset at the source results in a -/+100mV change in Vgs. In the subthreshold region, current is exponential with Vgs, meaning the resistance would change by orders of magnitude, failing to provide a stable high resistance against offsets (Challenge 2).
    - Verdict: Invalidates the fundamental operation required for this application.

    analysis_e = """
    E. Use a "split-gate" transistor for each pseudo-resistor side.
    - Analysis: This strategy provides the best balance. The bootstrapped gate section provides the core high-impedance behavior. For a fast reset (Challenge 3), both gate sections can be driven hard to create a low-resistance path. Crucially, the second, statically-driven gate provides an independent tuning knob. This can be used to trim for transistor mismatch and, most importantly, to adjust the operating point to compensate for the +/-100mV sensor offset (Challenge 2), ensuring the device stays in the proper subthreshold region despite the limited 1.2V supply (Challenge 1). This allows for a larger, lower-leakage capacitor to be used (Challenge 4) without sacrificing reset speed.
    - Verdict: The most effective strategy that balances all conflicting needs by introducing an additional degree of freedom for tuning.
