    Calculates the probability that a 2D random walk conditioned to avoid the origin,
    starting from (0,1), hits the neighbors of (3600,0).

    The problem is reduced to finding the probability that a standard 2D Simple Random Walk (SRW)
    starting at x0 = (0,1) hits z = (3600,0) before returning to the origin o = (0,0).
    This probability P is given by the ratio of potential kernels: P = a(x0) / a(z).

    The potential kernel a(x) is a function describing the potential at point x relative to the origin.
    - a(x0) = a(0,1) is exactly 1.
    - a(z) = a(3600,0) is approximated using the asymptotic formula:
      a(x) ~= (2/pi) * ln(||x||) + C0
    - The constant C0 is calibrated using the known value a(1,1) = 4/pi.
      C0 = a(1,1) - (2/pi) * ln(||(1,1)||) = (4 - ln(2))/pi.
