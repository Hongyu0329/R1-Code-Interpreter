    "To solve this problem, I will write a Python script that decodes the provided SKI combinator expression. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Expression**: I'll break down the complex SKI expression into smaller, more manageable parts.\n2.  **Identify Known Patterns**: I'll identify the standard SKI representations for the Successor function (`SUCC`) and the Church numerals for `1` and `2`.\n3.  **Evaluate Sub-Expressions**: Using the identified patterns, I will determine the Church numeral values of the main components of the expression.\n4.  **Simplify and Evaluate the Main Expression**: I'll show how the main expression simplifies into a series of applications of one Church numeral to another. I will explain that this application corresponds to exponentiation.\n5.  **Calculate the Value of n**: I will perform the exponentiation calculations step-by-step to find the value of `n`.\n6.  **Compute the Final Answer**: Once `n` is expressed as a power of 2, I will calculate `log_2(n)`.\n\nThe Python script below will print out this entire process and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_church_numeral_log():\n    \"\"\"\n    Decodes a complex SKI combinator expression representing a Church integer n\n    and calculates log_2(n).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The given SKI expression is: S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))\")\n    print(\"This expression represents a Church integer n.
