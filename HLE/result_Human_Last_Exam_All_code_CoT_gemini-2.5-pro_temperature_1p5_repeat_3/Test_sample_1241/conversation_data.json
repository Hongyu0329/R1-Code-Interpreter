    "To find the steady-state probabilities $P_i(+\\infty)$, we need to find the solution to the system of Kolmogorov-Chapman equations when the system reaches equilibrium. At equilibrium, the probabilities are no longer changing with time, which means their derivatives are zero: $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  **Set derivatives to zero:** We will replace the left-hand side of each differential equation with 0. This transforms the system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations for the steady-state probabilities $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n2.  **Formulate the linear system:** The resulting system of equations is:\n    *   $0 = -0.019 P_{0} + 0.65 P_{1}$\n    *   $0 = 0.019 P_{0} - (0.65 + 0.4)P_{1} + 0.392 P_{2} + 0.008 P_{3}$\n    *   $0 = 0.4 P_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008)P_{2}$\n    *   $0 = 0.008 P_{2} - 0.008 P_{3}$\n    This system is linearly dependent. We will replace one of the equations (e.g., the second one) with the normalization condition that the sum of all probabilities must be 1:\n    *   $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n3.  **Solve the system:** We will write a Python script using the `numpy` library to solve this system of four linear equations for the four unknown probabilities ($P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3$).\n4.  **Calculate the final sum:** Once we have the values for $P_0$ and $P_1$, we will compute their sum, $P_0 + P_1$, and print the result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the given transition rates (lambda values)\nl01 = 0.019\nl10 = 0.65\nl12 = 0.4\nl21 = 0.392\nl23 = 0.008\nl31 = 0.008\n\n# Set up the coefficient matrix A and the constant vector b for the system A*P = b.\n# The system of linear equations for the steady-state probabilities (P') is:\n# -l01*P0 + l10*P1 + 0*P2 + 0*P3 = 0\n# l12*P1 - (l21 + l23)*P2 + 0*P3 = 0\n# 0*P0 + 0*P1 + l23*P2 - l31*P3 = 0\n# P0 + P1 + P2 + P3 = 1\n\nA = np.array([\n    [-l01, l10, 0, 0],\n    [0, l12, -(l21 + l23), 0],\n    [0, 0, l23, -l31],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n])\n\nb = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])\n\n# Solve the system of linear equations for P = [P0, P1, P2, P3]\ntry:\n    P = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\n    P0 = P[0]\n    P1 = P[1]\n    \n    # Calculate the required sum\n    result = P0 + P1\n\n    # Print the values and the final equation\n    print(f\"The steady-state probabilities are:\")\n    print(f\"P0 = {P0:.6f}\")\n    print(f\"P1 = {P1:.6f}\")\n    print(f\"P2 = {P[2]:.6f}\")\n    print(f\"P3 = {P[3]:.6f}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final sum is P0(+\\u221e) + P1(+\\u221e):\")\n    print(f\"{P0:.6f} + {P1:.6f} = {result:.6f}\")\n\nexcept np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n    print(\"The system of equations does not have a unique solution.\")\n\n```\n<<<0.9462517680339463>>>"
