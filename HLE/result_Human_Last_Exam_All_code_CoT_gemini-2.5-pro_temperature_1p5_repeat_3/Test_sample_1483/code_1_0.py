    Solves the topological problem about continua by explaining the reasoning.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of the collection of
    regular proper subcontinua of a nondegenerate decomposable continuum.

    Step 1: Establish a lower bound.
    A decomposable continuum X can be written as X = A U B, where A and B are
    proper subcontinua. A key theorem states that such a continuum must contain
    at least two distinct proper subcontinua, H and K, with non-empty interiors.
    The closures of their interiors, cl(int(H)) and cl(int(K)), are then
    guaranteed to be regular proper subcontinua. This implies there are at least
    two such subcontinua.

    Step 2: Show the lower bound is achievable with an example.
    Construct a space X by taking two *indecomposable* continua (e.g., pseudo-arcs),
    let's call them C1 and C2, and joining them at a single point.
    - X is decomposable, as X = C1 U C2.
    - C1 is a regular proper subcontinuum of X because int(C1) (in X) is C1
      minus the joining point, and its closure is C1.
    - Similarly, C2 is a regular proper subcontinuum of X.
    - There can be no others. Any regular proper subcontinuum must have a
      non-empty connected interior. This interior would have to lie entirely
      within C1 or C2 (excluding the joining point). Since C1 and C2 are
      indecomposable, they have no proper subcontinua with interior. Thus,
      any such regular subcontinuum must be C1 or C2 itself.

    Step 3: Conclusion.
    The lower bound is 2, and we have an example where the cardinality is exactly 2.
    Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality is 2.

    # The smallest possible cardinality is determined by mathematical proof.
    # The final answer is the integer 2.
    
    final_answer = 2
    
    # We will now print the result as an equation as requested.
    # The question is: What is the smallest possible cardinality?
    # The final equation is: Smallest Cardinality = 2
