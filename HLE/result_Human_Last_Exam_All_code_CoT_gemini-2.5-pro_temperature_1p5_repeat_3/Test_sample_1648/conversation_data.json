    "To find the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$-th K-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, denoted $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$, is nonzero, we will use results from algebraic K-theory, specifically those related to the computation of K-groups of finite rings.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Relate K-theory to Topological Cyclic Homology (TC):** For rings like $R = \\mathbb{Z}/p^k$, the $p$-primary part of the algebraic K-groups $K_i(R)$ can be computed using topological cyclic homology. For an odd prime $p$ and $i \\ge 1$, the $p$-completed K-groups are isomorphic to the $p$-completed TC-groups:\n    $K_i(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k; \\mathbb{Z}_p) \\cong TC_i(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k; \\mathbb{Z}_p)$.\n    Since $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is known to be a 3-group, it is equal to its 3-completion.\n\n2.  **Use the Hesselholt-Madsen formula:** Lars Hesselholt and Ib Madsen provided computations for these TC-groups. In their paper \"On the K-theory of finite algebras over Witt vectors\", they give a formula for the order of these groups within a certain \"stable\" range. For $p$ an odd prime, $k \\ge 1$, and $n \\ge 1$, the formula is:\n    $|K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)| = p^{\\nu_p(n)}$\n    where $\\nu_p(n)$ is the $p$-adic valuation of $n$.\n\n3.  **Identify the condition for the formula's validity:** This formula is not valid for all $n$. It holds under the condition:\n    $k \\ge \\nu_p(n) + \\lfloor \\log_p(2n) \\rfloor$\n    Outside this range, the K-groups can be different (often trivial). We will assume that for the K-group to be non-zero as described by this formula, both the formula must be valid and the result must be a non-trivial group.\n\n4.  **Apply the conditions to our problem:**\n    *   The ring is $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, so $p=3$ and $k=3$.\n    *   For $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ to be nonzero, its order $3^{\\nu_3(n)}$ must be greater than 1. This means we need $\\nu_3(n) \\ge 1$, so $n$ must be a multiple of 3.\n    *   The validity condition becomes: $3 \\ge \\nu_3(n) + \\lfloor \\log_3(2n) \\rfloor$.\n\n5.  **Find the largest `n`:** We need to find the largest natural number $n$ that satisfies both conditions:\n    *   $n$ is a multiple of 3.\n    *   $\\nu_3(n) + \\lfloor \\log_3(2n) \\rfloor \\le 3$.\n\nWe can write a Python script to search for the largest integer $n$ that satisfies these two inequalities. The script will iterate downwards from a sufficiently large number and stop at the first value of $n$ that meets the criteria.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef p_adic_valuation(n, p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the p-adic valuation of n.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    count = 0\n    while n % p == 0:\n        count += 1\n        n //= p\n    return count\n\ndef check_conditions(n, p, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if n satisfies the conditions for the K-group to be non-zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Condition 1: n must be a multiple of p for the group to be non-zero.\n    if n % p != 0:\n        return False\n        \n    # Condition 2: The formula validity condition.\n    val_p_n = p_adic_valuation(n, p)\n    log_val = math.floor(math.log(2 * n) / math.log(p))\n    \n    if k >= val_p_n + log_val:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef solve_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest natural number n such that the (2n)th K-group\n    of Z/27 is nonzero.\n    \"\"\"\n    p = 3\n    k = 3\n    \n    # We will search for the largest n satisfying the conditions.\n    # The function f(n) = nu_p(n) + floor(log_p(2n)) is increasing with n,\n    # so we can find the point where it exceeds k and the largest n\n    # will be just below that.
