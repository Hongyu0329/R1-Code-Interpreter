    # --- Step 2: Determine if a disqualifying conflict exists ---

    # A disqualifying conflict exists if the firm has relevant confidential info
    # and is acting for an adverse party, AND the former client does not consent.
    # The requirement for consent is the crucial step.

    # We can model the permission to act with a logical AND (multiplication).

    # Since a conflict clearly exists, the equation hinges on consent.
