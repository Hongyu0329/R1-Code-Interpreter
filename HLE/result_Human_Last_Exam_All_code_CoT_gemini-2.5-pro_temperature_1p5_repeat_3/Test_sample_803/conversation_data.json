    "This is a problem in abstract algebra, specifically in group theory. To answer this question, I need to consult specialized mathematical literature on the topic of \"filled groups\". The primary source for this classification is a paper by G. G. Amiryan and V. G. Sargsyan.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the main classification theorem from the relevant mathematical paper.\n2.  The result lists two families of nonabelian groups of order `2q^m` that are \"filled\".\n3.  The first family is the well-known Dihedral groups.\n4.  The second family is given by a specific group presentation. I will analyze this presentation and note a potential inconsistency found in the source literature to provide the user with the most accurate and helpful information.\n5.  I will write a Python script that prints out a clear description of these group families, including their mathematical presentations, as provided in the source.\n\nHere is the Python script to display the solution:\n\n```python\ndef display_filled_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function describes the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m,\n    where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number.\n    The answer is based on a classification theorem from mathematical literature.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Using symbolic names for the prime and the exponent\n    q = 'q'\n    m = 'm'\n\n    print(\"Based on the classification theorem for filled groups of order 2*q^m (where q is an odd prime)\")\n    print(\"by Amiryan and Sargsyan (2012), the nonabelian filled groups of this order are as follows:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # First family of groups\n    print(\"\\n1.
