The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m (for odd prime q, m >= 1) are identified as the dihedral groups D_{2q^m}, and for m >= 2, a second family of groups given by the presentation <a, b | a^(q^m) = 1, b^2 = 1, bab^(-1) = a^(1 + q^(m-1))>, although this second presentation appears to contain a mathematical inconsistency in the source literature.
