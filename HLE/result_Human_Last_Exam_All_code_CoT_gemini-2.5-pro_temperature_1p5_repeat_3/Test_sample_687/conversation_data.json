    "To find a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles for the $9_{23}$ knot, we will use its HOMFLY polynomial, denoted as $P(a, z)$. There is a powerful result in knot theory known as the Morton-Franks-Williams inequality, which connects the number of Seifert circles of a knot diagram to the span of its HOMFLY polynomial.\n\nThe inequality is:\n$s(K) \\ge \\frac{\\text{span}_z(P_K(a, z))}{2} + 1$\n\nHere, $s(K)$ is the minimum number of Seifert circles for any diagram of knot $K$, and $\\text{span}_z(P_K(a, z))$ is the difference between the highest and lowest powers of the variable $z$ in the polynomial.\n\nMy plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  Obtain the HOMFLY polynomial for the $9_{23}$ knot.\n2.  Identify the minimum and maximum powers of the variable $z$ in this polynomial.\n3.  Calculate the span by subtracting the minimum power from the maximum power.\n4.  Substitute the calculated span into the inequality to find the lower bound for $s(9_{23})$.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that performs these calculations. The script uses the `spherogram` library to find the knot's polynomial and then processes it to find the bound. It also includes a fallback with a known polynomial for robustness. The script will clearly print each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Plan:\n# 1. State the relationship between the HOMFLY polynomial and the number of Seifert circles.\n#    The Morton-Franks-Williams inequality gives a lower bound for the number of Seifert circles, s(K),\n#    of a knot K in terms of the z-span of its HOMFLY polynomial P(a, z):\n#    s(K) >= span_z(P(a, z)) / 2 + 1\n# 2. Use the 'spherogram' library to compute the HOMFLY polynomial for the 9_23 knot, or use a known value.\n# 3. From the polynomial, find the maximum and minimum degrees of the variable z.\n# 4. Calculate the z-span, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum degrees.\n# 5. Apply the inequality to compute the lower bound for s(9_23).\n# 6.
