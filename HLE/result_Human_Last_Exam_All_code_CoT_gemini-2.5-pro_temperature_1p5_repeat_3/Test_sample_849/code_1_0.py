def solve_safe_goal():
    """
    This function determines the safe goal for the AI model M.

    The model M cannot guarantee predictive success because the set of successful
    predictors is uncomputable. A "safe" goal must be intrinsic to the model and
    not rely on unprovable outcomes.

    The model's primary asset is its collection of learned "hypothesis classes,"
    which it uses to generate predictors. The safest, most logical goal is to
    improve its ability to manage and deploy these predictors.

    This process of learning a higher-level strategy for applying learned models
    is called meta-learning. The resource it learns from is its own internal
    repertoire of capabilities.
