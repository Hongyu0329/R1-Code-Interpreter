    "This is a historical riddle. The clues point to a specific Russian figure. Let's break them down:\n1.  **The Poet:** Andrei Voznesensky was a famous Russian poet. This suggests the subject is likely Russian or significant in Russian history.\n2.  **The Quote:** \"a joy-discovering sailor\" points to an explorer or someone involved in maritime expeditions.\n3.  **The Mystery:** \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" indicates that the person's burial site was lost or unknown for a long time.\n4.  **The Discovery:** \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s\" gives a specific timeframe for the rediscovery or identification of the grave.\n\nThese clues point directly to **Nikolai Rezanov**. He was a Russian nobleman and statesman who was a key figure in the Russian-American Company. His story, including his journey to California and his tragic romance, was immortalized by Voznesensky in the poem that later became the famous rock opera \"Juno and Avos\". Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807 on his journey back to St. Petersburg. His original grave was destroyed, and its location was a matter of historical investigation, with a new memorial being established in the late 20th century.\n\nThe following Python code will print his last name.\n\n```python\n# The person described is Nikolai Rezanov (1764-1807), a Russian diplomat and one of the founders of the Russian-American Company.\n# The poet Andrei Voznesensky dedicated the poem \"Saga\" to him, which formed the basis for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\".\n# The poem contains the line about the \"joy-discovering sailor\" (мореплаватель-радосооткрыватель).\n# Rezanov's grave in Krasnoyarsk was destroyed, and its approximate location was re-established in the late 20th century, fitting all the clues.\n# This script will print his last name.\n\nlast_name = \"Rezanov\"\nprint(last_name)\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
