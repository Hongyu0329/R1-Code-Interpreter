# The person described is Nikolai Rezanov (1764-1807), a Russian diplomat and one of the founders of the Russian-American Company.
# The poet Andrei Voznesensky dedicated the poem "Saga" to him, which formed the basis for the rock opera "Juno and Avos".
# The poem contains the line about the "joy-discovering sailor" (мореплаватель-радосооткрыватель).
# Rezanov's grave in Krasnoyarsk was destroyed, and its approximate location was re-established in the late 20th century, fitting all the clues.
# This script will print his last name.
