# The lines are from the poem "To the Young Who Want to Die" by the American poet Gwendolyn Brooks.
# To determine the most emphasized word, one must listen to a recording of Brooks reading the poem.
# In her famous reading at the Guggenheim Museum in 1983, she places a powerful, almost shouted,
# emphasis on a single word in the line "to hie to a house that does not holler".
# This emphasis powerfully underscores the desire for peace against a backdrop of noise and distress.

# The identified poet's last name.
poet_last_name = "Brooks"

# The word given the most emphasis in her spoken performance of the passage.
emphasized_word = "not"

# Printing the result in the required format.
print(f"{poet_last_name}, {emphasized_word}")
