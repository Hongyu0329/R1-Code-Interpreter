    "This is a classic poker tournament problem that involves understanding push/fold ranges, stack sizes, position, and tournament dynamics (the money bubble).\n\nMy plan is to solve this by using a standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) push/fold chart for the given situation. Here are the steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Scenario**: We are UTG+1 (an early position) with a 16 big blind stack, near the money bubble of a tournament. The bubble pressure means other players will likely play tighter and avoid calling shoves without very strong hands. This increases our \"fold equity\".\n2.  **Identify a GTO Jamming Range**: I will use a widely accepted GTO-based jamming range for this specific spot. A typical range for 16bb from UTG+1 in a 9-handed game is approximately `77+, A9s+, ATo+, KTs+, QTs+, JTs`.\n3.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices**: I will write a Python script to check which of the given hands (QJs, 99, AJo, AKo) fall within this standard jamming range.\n4.  **Handle Multiple Correct Options**: The analysis will likely show that multiple hands are correct to jam. Since the question asks for a single answer, a tie-breaking logic is needed. While all are profitable shoves, pocket pairs like 99 often have simple raw equity advantages in heads-up all-in situations against non-pair hands like AKo or AJo. Although a deeper analysis involving blockers and equity against a *calling range* is more advanced, comparing raw equities is a straightforward way to differentiate them.\n5.  **Final Equation**: As requested, the code will also calculate the initial pot size you are trying to win by jamming, assuming a standard tournament structure (e.g., 9 players with a 12.5% ante).\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef get_hand_details(hand_str):\n    \"\"\"Parses a hand string like 'AJo' or '99' into its components.\"\"\"\n    rank1 = hand_str[0]\n    rank2 = hand_str[1]\n    suited = len(hand_str) == 3 and hand_str[2] == 's'\n    offsuit = len(hand_str) == 3 and hand_str[2] == 'o'\n    is_pair = rank1 == rank2\n    \n    # Assign numerical value for comparison\n    ranks = '23456789TJQKA'\n    val1 = ranks.find(rank1)\n    val2 = ranks.find(rank2)\n    \n    return collections.namedtuple('Hand', ['r1', 'r2', 'v1', 'v2', 'is_pair', 'is_suited'])(\n        rank1, rank2, val1, val2, is_pair, suited or not offsuit\n    )\n\ndef is_in_range(hand_str, push_range):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a hand is in a GTO push range list.\"\"\"\n    hand = get_hand_details(hand_str)\n    ranks = '23456789TJQKA'\n    \n    for r_str in push_range:\n        # Pair range like '77+'\n        if r_str.endswith('+') and r_str[0] == r_str[1]:\n            if hand.is_pair:\n                min_rank_val = ranks.find(r_str[0])\n                if hand.v1 >= min_rank_val:\n                    return True\n        # Suited connector range like 'KTs+'\n        elif r_str.endswith('s+'):\n            if hand.is_suited:\n                r1, r2 = r_str[0], r_str[1]\n                if hand.r1 == r1 and hand.v2 >= ranks.find(r2):\n                    return True\n        # Offsuit connector range like 'ATo+'\n        elif r_str.endswith('o+'):\n            if not hand.is_suited and not hand.is_pair:\n                r1, r2 = r_str[0], r_str[1]\n                if hand.r1 == r1 and hand.v2 >= ranks.find(r2):\n                    return True\n        # Specific hand like 'JTs'\n        elif r_str == hand_str.lower():\n             return True\n\n    return False\n\ndef solve_poker_problem():\n    \"\"\"Analyzes the poker problem and provides a solution.\"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
