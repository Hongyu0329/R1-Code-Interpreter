    "In the quantum version of the Prisoner's Dilemma, the game's structure is expanded. Players' strategies are no longer limited to \"Cooperate\" (C) and \"Defect\" (D), but can be any quantum operation (a unitary transformation). The game starts with the players sharing an entangled quantum state. By choosing a specific quantum strategy, players can achieve outcomes that are not possible in the classical version of the game.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Game Elements**: We will set up the quantum game using the established Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. This includes:\n    *   The payoff values: R=5 (Reward), S=0 (Sucker), T=7 (Temptation), P=1 (Punishment).\n    *   The players' classical strategies, Cooperate (C) and Defect (D), and a new, purely quantum strategy 'Q'. These strategies are represented by specific matrices.\n    *   An initial state which is a maximally entangled pair of qubits, prepared using an entangling operator `J`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Equilibrium**: A Nash Equilibrium is a pair of strategies where neither player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy. In the classical Prisoner's Dilemma, this is (Defect, Defect). We will show that in the quantum version, a new Nash Equilibrium `(Q, Q)` emerges.\n\n3.  **Determine the Payoff**: We will calculate the final state of the system when both players choose the `Q` strategy. From this final state, we'll find the probabilities of the classical outcomes (CC, CD, DC, DD).\n\n4.  **Final Equation**: Using these probabilities and the payoff values, we will compute the final payoff for each player at the `(Q, Q)` equilibrium. The Python code below will perform these calculations step-by-step.\n\nThe key insight is that the introduction of entanglement and a larger strategy space allows players to escape the classical dilemma. The strategy `Q` is defined as the quantum gate `iÏƒ_z` (the Pauli-Z gate multiplied by `i`). When both players choose this strategy, it leads to a stable equilibrium where both players receive a higher payoff than in the classical punishment outcome.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the equilibrium point of the Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma\n    using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
