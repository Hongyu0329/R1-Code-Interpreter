def solve():
    """
    This function solves the mathematical problem by printing the comma-separated list
    of numbers corresponding to the identities that necessarily follow from the given condition.
    
    The detailed derivation is provided in the text explanation. The main steps are:
    1. Derive fundamental identities from the condition `Ψ(k; l; m) = 0`.
       The key results are `k.Φ(m) = l.Φ(m)` and its permutations.
    2. From these, prove `(klm).Φ(x) = 0` for `x` in `{k,l,m}`.
    3. Use these identities to verify each of the 12 statements.
    
    The necessarily true statements are found to be 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12.
