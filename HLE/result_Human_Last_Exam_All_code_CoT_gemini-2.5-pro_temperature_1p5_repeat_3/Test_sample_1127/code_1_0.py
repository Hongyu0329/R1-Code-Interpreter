# The minimal polynomial for the connective constant of the graph G is P(x) = x^2 - 5x + 3.
# The task requires printing out the numbers in the final equation.

# Coefficients of the polynomial P(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c
a = 1
b = -5
c = 3

# The minimal polynomial P(x) is defined such that P(mu) = 0, where mu is the connective constant.
print(f"Let x be the connective constant. Its minimal polynomial P(x) satisfies the equation P(x) = 0.")
print(f"The equation is: ({a})*x^2 + ({b})*x + ({c}) = 0")
