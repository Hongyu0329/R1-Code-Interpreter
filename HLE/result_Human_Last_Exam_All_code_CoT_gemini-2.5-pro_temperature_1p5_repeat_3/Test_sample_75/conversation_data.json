    "Of course. Here is the plan to calculate the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n1.  **Establish the Timeline:**\n    *   The Second Great War starts in the year 2504, following the events of the Brood War.\n    *   The main conflicts, including the campaigns of *Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*, conclude with the defeat of Amon in 2506.\n    *   However, the final chapter of the war, the epilogue *Into the Void*, takes place in the year 2508, marking the true end of the conflict.\n2.  **Calculate the Duration:**\n    *   To find the total duration, I will subtract the start year from the end year (2508 - 2504).\n3.  **Round Up:**\n    *   The result will be an integer. The problem requires rounding up, so I will apply the ceiling function to ensure the requirement is met, even if the value doesn't change.\n4.  **Display the Result:**\n    *   The final output will present the calculation and the resulting duration in years.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The Second Great War in StarCraft lore begins in 2504.\nstart_year = 2504\n\n# The war's final epilogue, \"Into the Void,\" concludes in 2508.\nend_year = 2508\n\n# Calculate the duration of the war.\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# The result must be rounded up as per the request.\n# math.ceil rounds a number up to the nearest integer.\nfinal_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\nprint(\"The Second Great War began in {} and ended in {}.\".format(start_year, end_year))\nprint(\"Calculating the duration (in years, rounded up):\")\n# We use int() to display the final number without the .0 from ceiling.\nprint(\"{} - {} = {}\".format(end_year, start_year, int(final_duration)))\n<<<4>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
