# 1. The problem of finding Quantum Temporal Fixed Points (QTFPs) reduces
#    to solving an algebraic equation. Let 'p' be the probability of a
#    proposition being true.
#    The QTFP condition is: p^2 + (1-p)^2 = 2*p*(1-p)

# 2. Simplifying this condition leads to a quadratic equation:
#    2*p^2 - 2*p + 1 = 2*p - 2*p^2
#    4*p^2 - 4*p + 1 = 0

# 3. We can represent this polynomial equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
poly_coeffs = {'a': 4, 'b': -4, 'c': 1}

print("The logical condition for a Quantum Temporal Fixed Point (QTFP) can be translated into a polynomial equation for the probability 'p' of the proposition being true.")
print("The equation is:")

# Print each number in the final equation
print(f"{poly_coeffs['a']}*p^2 + ({poly_coeffs['b']})*p + {poly_coeffs['c']} = 0")

# 4. This equation (2p - 1)^2 = 0 has a single unique solution for p.
p_solution = 0.5
print(f"\nThe unique solution to this equation is p = {p_solution}.")
print("This means a proposition is a QTFP if and only if it has a 50% chance of being true.")

# 5. We now count how many distinct propositions satisfy this criterion based on the
#    problem's constraint: "simple superpositions of two classical propositions".
#    This implies a quantum state with real coefficients: a|T> + b|F>.
#    The condition p = 0.5 means a^2 = 0.5, so a = +/- 1/sqrt(2).
#    The normalization a^2 + b^2 = 1 means b = +/- 1/sqrt(2).

# 6. We find the number of unique states, remembering that states differing by a
#    global phase of -1 are physically identical.
#    The two distinct states are:
#    State 1: a = 1/sqrt(2), b = 1/sqrt(2)
#    State 2: a = 1/sqrt(2), b = -1/sqrt(2)
#    The other two possibilities are just multiples of these by -1.
