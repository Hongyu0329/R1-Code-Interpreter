    "To determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded, we need to understand how patches and holes contribute to the encoding capacity of a surface code.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Logical Qubits from Patches:** A single, standard patch of surface code (a planar code without any holes) encodes exactly one logical qubit. Since we have two separate patches, they will contribute independently to the total number of logical qubits.\n2.  **Logical Qubits from Holes:** Creating a hole within a patch of surface code introduces new non-trivial paths for operators, which allows for the encoding of one additional logical qubit per hole.\n3.  **Total Calculation:** The total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from the base patches and the additional qubits provided by the holes.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is as follows:\n*   Qubits from 2 patches = 2 * 1 = 2 logical qubits.\n*   Qubits from 2 holes = 2 * 1 = 2 logical qubits.\n*   Total logical qubits = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_logical_qubits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits for a given number of\n    surface code patches and holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of separate patches of surface code\n    num_patches = 2\n\n    # Total number of holes across all patches\n    num_holes = 2\n\n    # Each patch contributes 1 logical qubit\n    qubits_from_patches = num_patches * 1\n\n    # Each hole adds the capacity for 1 additional logical qubit\n    qubits_from_holes = num_holes * 1\n\n    # The total is the sum of contributions from patches and holes\n    total_logical_qubits = qubits_from_patches + qubits_from_holes\n\n    # The final equation shows the contribution from patches and holes\n    print(\n        f\"The maximum number of logical qubits is derived from {num_patches} patches and {num_holes} holes.\"\n    )\n    print(\n        f\"Total logical qubits = (Qubits from patches) + (Qubits from holes)\"\n    )\n    print(\n        f\"Total logical qubits = {qubits_from_patches} + {qubits_from_holes} = {total_logical_qubits}\"\n    )\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_logical_qubits()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
