    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving a directed ortho-metalation (DoM) reaction. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the transformation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Substrate and Reagents:**\n    *   **Substrate:** N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This is an aromatic compound (a derivative of benzamide) with two key functional groups that can direct a reaction: the `N,N-diethylamide` group at position 1 and the `dimethylamino` group at position 3.\n    *   **Reagents (Step 1):** `sec-BuLi` (sec-butyllithium) and `TMEDA` (tetramethylethylenediamine) in `THF` (tetrahydrofuran). sec-BuLi is a very strong base, and TMEDA is a ligand that complexes with the lithium ion, increasing the basicity of the system. This combination is highly effective for deprotonating specific C-H bonds on an aromatic ring, a process known as lithiation or metalation.\n    *   **Reagent (Step 2):** `CH3I` (methyl iodide). This is an electrophile that will be attacked by the intermediate formed in the first step.\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Reaction (Directed ortho-Metalation):**\n    *   The sec-BuLi/TMEDA system performs a \"directed ortho-metalation\". This means it removes a proton from the position *ortho* (adjacent) to a \"Directing Metalation Group\" (DMG).\n    *   Our substrate has two DMGs. We must determine which one is stronger. The directing ability generally follows the order: `-CONR2` (amide) > `-OR` (alkoxy) > `-NR2` (amine).\n    *   Therefore, the `N,N-diethylamide` group at position 1 is the primary, stronger directing group.\n    *   The reaction will preferentially occur at a position ortho to the amide group, which are positions 2 and 6.\n    *   However, the proton at position 2 is also *ortho* to the weaker directing `dimethylamino` group at position 3. This cooperative effect makes the proton at position 2 the most acidic on the ring and the definitive site for deprotonation by sec-BuLi.\n    *   So, the first step forms an aryllithium intermediate where the hydrogen at position 2 is replaced by a lithium atom.\n\n3.  **Electrophilic Quench:**\n    *   The aryllithium intermediate is a potent nucleophile (a carbon with a negative charge).\n    *   In the second step, this nucleophile attacks the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide (`CH3I`), displacing the iodide ion.\n    *   This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond, attaching a methyl group (`-CH3`) to position 2 of the benzene ring.\n\n4.  **Final Product:**\n    *   The final product is the starting molecule with an added methyl group at position 2. Its name is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nThe following Python code prints the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the product of a chemical reaction sequence.\n    \n    The reaction is the directed ortho-metalation of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n    using sec-BuLi/TMEDA, followed by quenching with methyl iodide.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The starting material has two directing groups for the metalation reaction:\n    # 1. N,N-diethylamide (-CONEt2) at position 1 (strong director)\n    # 2.
