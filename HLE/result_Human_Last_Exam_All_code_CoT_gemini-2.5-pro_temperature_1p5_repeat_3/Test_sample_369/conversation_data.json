    "This is a challenging line of hexameter, likely designed for instruction as it contains several complexities, including multiple potential elisions and words with ambiguous quantities. My analysis will proceed by breaking the line down foot by foot, making the most probable choices based on standard Latin scansion rules.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the line from right to left:** The last two feet of a hexameter line are the most predictable (usually Dactyl-Spondee). This can provide a strong anchor for the rest of the scansion.\n2.  **Syllabify the words:** Break each word into its constituent syllables.\n3.  **Determine syllable quantity (long/short):**\n    *   A syllable is **long by position** if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants or by a double consonant (x, z).\n    *   A syllable is **long by nature** if it contains a long vowel or a diphthong.\n    *   Otherwise, a syllable is **short**.\n4.  **Identify and apply elisions:** When a word ending in a vowel or \"-m\" is followed by a word beginning with a vowel or \"h\", the first word's final syllable is typically dropped (elided). This line has several potential elisions.\n5.  **Address ambiguities:** This line has ambiguities (e.g., `ubi` can be `ubĭ` or `ubī`; `verum` can be `vĕrum` or `vērum`). I will choose the quantities that create a valid metrical pattern.\n6.  **Assemble the feet:** Group the long (-) and short (u) syllables into feet. Dactyls are long-short-short (- u u) and Spondees are long-long (- -). The pattern will be composed of six feet.\n7.  **Final Code:** The Python code will print each of the six feet that make up the line, followed by its type (D for Dactyl, S for Spondee), and the final D/S pattern.\n\nBased on my step-by-step analysis, the most coherent (though not flawless) scansion is Dactyl-Spondee-Spondee-Dactyl-Dactyl-Spondee. This requires assuming a long 'i' in `ubi` (`ubī`) and an elision between `atque` and `hominis`.\n\n```python\ndef scan_hexameter_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans the Latin hexameter line:\n    \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n    This function breaks the line into its six metrical feet and identifies\n    each as a dactyl (D) or spondee (S).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Hexameter feet breakdown based on analysis.\n    # This particular line is complex and requires some assumptions:\n    # 1. Hiatus after \"verum\" (the '-um' is not elided, but used for position).\n    # 2. The 'i' in 'ubi' is scanned as long by nature ('ubī').\n    # 3. There is an elision between 'atque' and 'hominis' -> 'atqu(e) hominis'.\n    # 4.
