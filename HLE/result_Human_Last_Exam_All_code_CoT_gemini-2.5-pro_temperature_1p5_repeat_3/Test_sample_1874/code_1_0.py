Condition (2) states that if alpha < beta, then R(x_beta, x_alpha). This means the sequence is a descending chain. Condition (3) says this chain has no lower bound of size omega_2.")
    print_wrapped("The minimum length 'delta' of such a tower is a cardinal characteristic known as the tower number, usually denoted by the German letter t.

    print_wrapped("From the constraints above, the smallest possible candidate for delta is omega_3. Set theory shows that this value is indeed possible. For instance, in models of ZFC that satisfy the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH), we have 2^omega_2 = omega_3. Since we know omega_3 <= t(omega_2) <= 2^omega_2, it follows that t(omega_2) must be omega_3 in these models. So, the smallest possible value for delta is omega_3.")

    print_wrapped("The smallest possible value is omega_3. The next regular cardinal in the sequence is omega_4. The question now is whether delta can be equal to omega_4. It is a major result in modern set theory, obtained through the method of forcing, that for any regular cardinal lambda >= kappa^+, it is consistent with ZFC that t(kappa) = lambda. Applying this for kappa = omega_2, it is consistent that t(omega_2) = omega_4.")
