    "In the context of the renormalization group, the epsilon expansion is a powerful technique for calculating critical exponents. We consider a system in `d` dimensions, where `d` is close to the upper critical dimension `d_c`, and we expand in the small parameter `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n\nFor problems involving specific heat, we typically use the O(n)-symmetric n-vector model. The upper critical dimension for this model is `d_c = 4`. The specific heat exponent, `α`, can be calculated to the first order in `ϵ` using the following formula:\n\n`α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n\nHere's the plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify the parameters:**\n    *   The spatial dimension `d` is given as 3.\n    *   The upper critical dimension `d_c` for this universality class is 4.\n    *   The problem does not specify `n`, the number of components of the order parameter. We will assume the most common case, the Ising model, where `n=1`.\n2.  **Calculate ϵ:** `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n3.  **Substitute the values:** Plug the values of `n` and `ϵ` into the formula for `α`.\n4.  **Execute the calculation:** A Python script will perform these steps and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Parameters for the calculation\n# The spatial dimension of the system\nd = 3\n# The upper critical dimension for the n-vector model\nd_c = 4\n# The number of components of the order parameter.
