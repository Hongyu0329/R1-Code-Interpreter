    "To determine the binding affinity of the specified compound to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), I will perform a search in the ChEMBL database. ChEMBL is a large, public database containing binding, functional, and ADMET information for a vast number of drug-like bioactive compounds. I will use a Python script to programmatically access this data.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will use the `chembl_webresource_client` Python library to connect to the ChEMBL database.\n2.  I will identify the unique ChEMBL database identifiers for both the molecule and the protein target. The molecule is \"7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile\" (also known as the clinical candidate SY-1365). The target is human \"Cyclin-dependent kinase 7\" (CDK7).\n3.  Using these identifiers, I will query the database for recorded bioactivity data, specifically looking for an IC50 value, which is a common measure of a compound's potency and reflects its binding affinity.\n4.  The script will then extract the IC50 value and its units. To meet the requirement of showing the numbers involved, the script will print this value clearly.\n5.  Finally, I will compare the retrieved value to the ranges given in the multiple-choice options to determine the correct answer.\n\nHere is the Python script to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport platform\n\n# Check for Python version and library installation\ntry:\n    if sys.version_info < (3, 6):\n        print(\"This script requires Python 3.6 or newer.\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n        \n    from chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Required library 'chembl_webresource_client' not found.\")\n    print(\"Please install it by running the following command in your shell:\")\n    print(\"pip install chembl_webresource_client\")\n    sys.exit(1)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred during import: {e}\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\ndef find_binding_affinity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Queries the ChEMBL database to find the binding affinity of a specific\n    compound to CDK7 and determines which of the given ranges it falls into.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Querying ChEMBL database...\")\n\n    # Using pre-identified ChEMBL IDs for robustness and speed.\n    # Compound: 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~S)-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~H-indole-6-carbonitrile\n    # This compound is also known as SY-1365.\n    # Target: Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (Homo sapiens)\n    compound_chembl_id = 'CHEMBL3989895'\n    target_chembl_id = 'CHEMBL277'\n    \n    try:\n        # Initialize the activity client\n        activity = new_client.activity\n\n        # Filter for IC50 activity data for the specific compound-target pair\n        res = activity.filter(\n            molecule_chembl_id=compound_chembl_id,\n            target_chembl_id=target_chembl_id,\n            type='IC50',\n            assay_type='B' # 'B' for Binding assays\n        ).only(['standard_type', 'standard_relation', 'standard_value', 'standard_units'])\n\n        if not res:\n            print(f\"No binding assay (IC50) data found for compound {compound_chembl_id} against target {target_chembl_id}.\")\n            return\n\n        # Take the first and most relevant result\n        activity_data = res[0]\n        affinity_type = activity_data.get('standard_type')\n        relation = activity_data.get('standard_relation')\n        value_str = activity_data.get('standard_value')\n        units = activity_data.get('standard_units')\n\n        if not all([affinity_type, relation, value_str, units]):\n            print(\"Retrieved data is incomplete.
