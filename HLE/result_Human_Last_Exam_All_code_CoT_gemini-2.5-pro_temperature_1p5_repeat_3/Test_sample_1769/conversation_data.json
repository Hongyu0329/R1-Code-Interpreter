    "This is a fascinating question of alternate linguistic history. Here is a step-by-step explanation of how we can determine the likely word.\n\nFirst, let's understand the origin of the current word, \"sister\". It comes directly from the Old Norse word *systir*, which was brought to England by Viking invaders and settlers. The Old Norse term replaced the native Old English word in most of the country.\n\nTo figure out what the word would be without this invasion, we need to find the original Old English word and trace its natural evolution.\n\n1.  **The Old English Word:** The native Old English word for \"sister\" was **sweostor**.\n2.  **Evolution to Middle English:** As Old English evolved into Middle English, the \"eo\" vowel sound in *sweostor* typically simplified. The word became **suster** (pronounced roughly as 'soos-ter'). This form was common in areas of England with less Norse influence.\n3.  **Evolution to Modern English:** If the form *suster* had continued to evolve naturally into Modern English, its pronunciation would have changed along with other similar words (like *sunne* -> \"sun\"). The \"u\" sound (as in \"put\") would have shifted to the sound we hear in \"cup\" or \"duster\".\n\nTherefore, the native, un-invaded Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be **suster**.\n\nThe following Python code prints out this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef find_alternate_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the linguistic path from the original Old English word\n    for \"sister\" to its likely Modern English form without Norse influence.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The current Modern English word 'sister' is an import from Old Norse ('systir').\")\n    print(\"It replaced the native Old English word due to the Viking invasions.\")\n    print(\"\\nTo find the alternate-history word, we must trace the original word's evolution:\")\n    \n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    print(f\"1. The original Old English word was: {old_english_word}\")\n    \n    middle_english_word = \"suster\"\n    print(f\"2. In Middle English, this naturally evolved into: {middle_english_word}\")\n    \n    modern_english_word = \"suster\"\n    print(f\"3. Following standard sound changes into Modern English, the word would most likely be: {modern_english_word}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nIt would be pronounced to rhyme with words like 'duster' or 'muster'.\")\n\nfind_alternate_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
