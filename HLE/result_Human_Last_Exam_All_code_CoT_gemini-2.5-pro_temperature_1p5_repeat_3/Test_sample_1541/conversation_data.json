    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is the plan and the Python code to solve the problem, followed by the memory analysis for a C program.\n\n### Plan for the Python Solution\n\n1.  **Read Input**: I will read the entire line of input, which is a string representing the sum (e.g., \"3+2+1\").\n2.  **Extract Numbers**: The numbers are separated by '+' signs. I will split the string by the '+' character to get a list of the numbers, which will still be in string format (e.g., `['3', '2', '1']`).\n3.  **Sort Numbers**: To sort the numbers correctly, I'll first convert the list of strings to a list of integers. Then, I will sort this list in non-decreasing (ascending) order.\n4.  **Reconstruct the Sum**: After sorting, I'll convert the integers back into strings.\n5.  **Print Output**: Finally, I will join the list of sorted number strings with a '+' character in between to form the final, correctly ordered sum, and print it to the console.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a sum of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4), rearranges them in non-decreasing order,\n    and prints the new sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the input string\n    s = input()\n\n    # Extract the numbers by splitting the string at the '+' character\n    numbers_str = s.split('+')\n\n    # Sort the list of numbers. Python's sort on strings of single digits works\n    # correctly, so we don't strictly need to convert to integers, but doing\n    # so is more robust if numbers could have more than one digit.\n    numbers_str.sort()\n\n    # Join the sorted numbers back into a single string with '+'\n    result = '+'.join(numbers_str)\n\n    # Print the final rearranged sum\n    print(result)\n\nsolve()\n```\n\n### Memory-Efficient C Program Analysis\n\nFor the second part of your question, let's analyze the memory usage of the most memory-efficient C program to solve this task.\n\nA highly memory-efficient approach would be to not store the input string at all. Instead, the program can read the input character by character and use a \"counting sort\" strategy, since we know the only numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nThe C program would:\n1.  Declare an integer array of size 4 to store the counts of each number ('1', '2', '3', '4').\n2.  Read the input character by character in a loop until the end of the input.\n3.  If the character is a digit, increment the corresponding counter in the array.\n4.  After counting, loop through the counts array and print the numbers in sorted order ('1's, then '2's, etc.), adding a '+' sign between them.\n\nThe variables needed for this C program on a typical system (where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes) would be:\n*   `int counts[4];` An array to store the frequency of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Memory: `4 * sizeof(int) = 4 * 4 = 16` bytes.\n*   `int c;` A variable to store the character read by `getchar()`, which returns an `int`. Memory: `1 * sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n*   `int is_first;` A flag to correctly handle printing the '+' signs (to avoid a leading or trailing '+'). Memory: `1 * sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n*   `int i, j;` Loop counter variables. Memory: `2 * sizeof(int) = 2 * 4 = 8` bytes.\n\nThe total memory (m) used for these variables is the sum:\nm = 16 + 4 + 4 + 8 = 32 bytes.\n\n<<<32>>>"
