    "This problem is a classic question in basic category theory. Finding the number of categories with one object and three morphisms up to isomorphism is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n1.  A category with a single object is defined by its set of morphisms and their composition rule. Let the single object be `X`. All morphisms are endomorphisms, mapping `X` to `X`.\n2.  The set of morphisms must be closed under composition, and this composition must be associative.\n3.  There must be an identity morphism `id_X` which acts as a two-sided identity for composition.\n4.  A set with an associative binary operation and an identity element is, by definition, a **monoid**.\n\nSo, the task is to find the number of distinct (non-isomorphic) monoid structures on a set of 3 elements. Let the elements be `{e, f, g}`, where `e` is the identity element. The composition of any two of these morphisms must result in one of these three morphisms. We can represent this composition as a 3x3 multiplication table.\n\nMy plan is to use a Python script to:\n1.  Systematically generate all possible composition tables for the 3 morphisms. Since one morphism must be the identity, its composition rules are fixed. This leaves the compositions of the other two morphisms to be determined. For morphisms `f` and `g`, there are 4 compositions to define (`f∘f`, `f∘g`, `g∘f`, `g∘g`), and each can result in `e`, `f`, or `g`. This gives `3^4 = 81` possible structures.\n2.  For each of the 81 generated tables, check if the composition rule is associative.\n3.  For each valid (associative) monoid, we must account for isomorphisms. Two monoids are isomorphic if one's multiplication table can be transformed into the other's by simply relabeling the non-identity elements (i.e., swapping the labels of `f` and `g`).\n4.  The script will find a canonical representation for each isomorphism class and count the number of unique classes.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan and prints the final count, along with the composition tables for each unique category.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef get_swapped_table(table):\n    \"\"\"\n    Swaps the non-identity elements (1 and 2) in a 3x3 multiplication table.\n    Returns the new table corresponding to the isomorphic monoid where the\n    morphisms 'f' and 'g' are swapped.\n    \"\"\"\n    p = {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 1} # 0->e, 1->f, 2->g. p swaps f and g.\n    swapped = [[0] * 3 for _ in range(3)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            # The isomorphism condition: phi(a*b) = phi(a) . phi(b)\n            # Here, phi is p, * is the old op, . is the new op in the swapped table.\n            swapped[p[i]][p[j]] = p[table[i][j]]\n    return swapped\n\ndef table_to_tuple(table):\n    \"\"\"Converts a list of lists to a tuple of tuples to make it hashable.\"\"\"\n    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in table)\n\ndef solve_and_print():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    This is equivalent to the number of categories with one object and three\n    morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n    \"\"\"\n    elements = [0, 1, 2]  # 0: identity 'e', 1: 'f', 2: 'g'\n    unique_monoids = set()\n\n    # Iterate through all 3^4 = 81 possibilities for the sub-table for f and g\n    for ff, fg, gf, gg in itertools.product(elements, repeat=4):\n        # 1.
