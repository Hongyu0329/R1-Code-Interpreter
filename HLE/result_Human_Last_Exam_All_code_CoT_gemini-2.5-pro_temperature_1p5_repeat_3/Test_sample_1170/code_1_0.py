    Solves the problem by identifying which of the 20 objects generate a prime tt-ideal
    in the tensor-triangulated category K = D_b(E(C_p)).

    The solution is based on the known classification of prime tt-ideals for this category.
    There are four such ideals: P_0 (zero), P_loc, P_reg, and P_max (maximal). An object
    generates a prime ideal P if P is the smallest prime ideal containing it.
    
    After analyzing each of the 20 objects based on established results in the field:
    - Object 2 (kC_p(0)) does not generate a prime ideal as it generates the entire category.
    - All other 19 objects generate one of the four prime ideals.
    - Specifically, object 16 generates the zero ideal P_0. Objects 10, 15, 17-20 generate P_loc.
      Objects 7-9, 11-14 generate P_reg. Objects 1, 3-6 generate P_max.
