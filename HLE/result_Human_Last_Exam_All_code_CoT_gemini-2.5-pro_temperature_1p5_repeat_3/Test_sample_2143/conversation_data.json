    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  I will first analyze the key phrases in the prompt: \"another's material possessions,\" \"prohibition against representation,\" and the scholar \"Veronika Campan.\"\n2.  The phrase \"another's material possessions\" strongly suggests the Tenth Commandment: \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house... or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\" This commandment is typically the last in the list.\n3.  The \"prohibition against representation\" points directly to the Second Commandment, which forbids the making of graven images or idols.\n4.  I will search for the work of Veronika Campan to see how she connects these two commandments. Her scholarship often interprets biblical texts through a psychoanalytic lens. She argues that the final commandment shifts the focus from external actions (like making an idol) to internal desire (coveting), which requires a mental *representation* of the thing desired. Thus, in addressing desire, the text must implicitly \"ignore\" the simple prohibition on external representations to tackle the more complex world of internal ones.\n5.  \"HE\" refers to the lawgiver who is traditionally credited with writing down the Ten Commandments as received from God. This historical and religious figure is Moses.\n\nBased on this plan, the code below will print HIS name.\n\n```python\n# The riddle's clues point to the author of the Ten Commandments.\n# \"another's material possessions\" refers to the 10th commandment against coveting.\n# \"prohibition against representation\" refers to the 2nd commandment against idolatry.\n# Veronika Campan's interpretation connects these commandments.\n# The person who wrote down these laws at the end of his dialogue with God on Mount Sinai is Moses.\n\n# Define the parts of the name. As there is no equation, we will represent the name as a single string.\nhis_name = \"Moses\"\n\n# Print the full name.\nprint(his_name)\n```\n<<<Moses>>>"
