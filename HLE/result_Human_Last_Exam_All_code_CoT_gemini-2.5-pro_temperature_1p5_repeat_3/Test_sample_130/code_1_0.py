    print("This happens because the boundary evolves to minimize its total length, a process known as 'mean curvature flow'.\n")

    print("   - Any closed shape (e.g., a white circle on a black background) is made of convex boundaries.")

    print("   - As t -> infinity, any such closed, convex shape will shrink until it vanishes completely.\n")
