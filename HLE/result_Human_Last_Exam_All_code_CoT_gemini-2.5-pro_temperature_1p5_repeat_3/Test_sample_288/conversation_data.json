    "To identify the main synaptic target of the ASJ neuron pair in the adult *C. elegans*, I will analyze the publicly available connectome dataset.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Access the adult hermaphrodite connectome data, which contains a list of all synaptic connections.\n2.  Filter these connections to isolate only those originating from the ASJ neuron pair (ASJL and ASJR).\n3.  Group the resulting synapses by their target (postsynaptic) cell.\n4.  Sum the number of synapses for each target cell to find the total input it receives from ASJ.\n5.  Identify the target cell with the highest total synapse count.\n6.  Print the name of this target cell and the corresponding number of synapses.\n\nThis will be accomplished using a Python script that leverages the `c-elegans-connectome` library.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom celegans_connectome import connectome\n\ndef find_main_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the main synaptic target of the ASJ neurons\n    in the adult C. elegans connectome.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Load the connectome data for the adult hermaphrodite.\n        # This dataset contains synapse information, including pre- and post-synaptic cells\n        # and the number of synapses ('N') for each connection.\n        synapse_df = connectome.get_data()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Could not load the connectome data. Please ensure you have an internet connection\")\n        print(f\"and the 'c-elegans-connectome' library is installed ('pip install c-elegans-connectome').\")\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # Define the source neurons. ASJ is a left-right pair.\n    source_neurons = ['ASJL', 'ASJR']\n\n    # Filter the data to get all synaptic outputs from the ASJ neurons.\n    asj_outputs = synapse_df[synapse_df['pre_cell'].isin(source_neurons)]\n\n    # Group the filtered connections by the target cell ('post_cell') and\n    # sum the number of synapses ('N') from both ASJL and ASJR.\n    target_synapse_counts = asj_outputs.groupby('post_cell')['N'].sum()\n\n    # Find the target cell that receives the most synapses from ASJ.\n    # idxmax() gives the name of the cell, and max() gives the synapse count.\n    main_target_cell = target_synapse_counts.idxmax()\n    max_synapses = target_synapse_counts.max()\n\n    # Print the result.\n    print(f\"The source neuron pair is ASJ (ASJL & ASJR).\")\n    print(f\"The main projection target of ASJ in terms of synapse number is the neuron: {main_target_cell}\")\n    print(f\"ASJ makes a total of {max_synapses} synapses onto {main_target_cell}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_main_target()\n<<<AIA>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
