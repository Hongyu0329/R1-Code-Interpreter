    print("### Step 1: The Fundamental CARS Frequency Relationship ###")
    print("In any CARS process, three beams interact with the sample:")
    print(" - Pump beam (frequency: omega_p)")
    print(" - Stokes beam (frequency: omega_s)")
    print(" - Probe beam (frequency: omega_pr)")
    print("\nFirst, the pump and Stokes beams excite a molecular vibration (frequency: Omega).")
    print("The vibrational frequency excited is given by the difference in their frequencies:")
    print("Equation 1: Omega = omega_p - omega_s")
    print("\nNext, the probe beam scatters off this excited vibration to generate the signal.")
    print("The resulting signal is the anti-Stokes beam (frequency: omega_as):")
    print("Equation 2: omega_as = omega_pr + Omega")
    print("Substituting Equation 1 into 2, we get the full relationship:")
    print("Final Equation: omega_as = omega_pr + omega_p - omega_s")

    print("\n### Step 2: Applying the Specific 'Broadband Pump' Condition ###")
    print("The question specifies a broadband pump beam. This means:")
    print(" - omega_p is a wide range of frequencies (Broadband)")
    print(" - omega_s is a single, well-defined frequency (Narrowband)")
    print(" - omega_pr is also a single, well-defined frequency (Narrowband)")

    print("\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Resulting Signal ###")
    print("Let's look at our 'Final Equation' again: omega_as = omega_pr + omega_p - omega_s")
    print(" - Since omega_p is a broadband continuum of frequencies, and the other two are fixed,")
    print("   the resulting anti-Stokes signal (omega_as) must also be a broadband continuum.")
    print("   Therefore, an anti-Stokes beam IS generated, and it is broadband.")
    print("   This immediately rules out answers A and E.")

    print("\n### Step 4: Can We Get Distinguishable Information? ###")
    print("This is the key question. We detect the broadband anti-Stokes signal (omega_as) with a spectrometer.")
    print("The spectrometer measures the intensity for each frequency within the omega_as signal.")
    print("Can we map each detected frequency back to a specific molecular vibration (Omega)?")
    print("\nLet's rearrange Equation 2: Omega = omega_as - omega_pr")
    print(" - We measure a full spectrum for omega_as.")
    print(" - We know the exact, single frequency of our probe, omega_pr.")
    print(" - Therefore, for every frequency in the anti-Stokes signal we detect, we can calculate a unique")
    print("   corresponding vibrational frequency, Omega.")
    print("\nConclusion: The broadband anti-Stokes beam contains a full spectrum of the sample's")
    print("vibrational modes. The information is distinguishable.")
    print("This means statement B is false, and statement C is true.")
