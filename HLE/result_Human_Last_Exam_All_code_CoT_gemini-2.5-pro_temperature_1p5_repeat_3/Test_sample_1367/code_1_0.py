    # Part (a): Is V(p) simple for all p in Z_>=1?
    # No. For p=1, the vertex algebra V(1) is the c=-2 triplet algebra, which is known to be not simple.
    answer_a = "No"

    # Part (b): If a non-trivial ideal exists, what condition must it meet?
    # A non-trivial ideal I in V(p) must be a V(p)-submodule. Since L_k(sl_2) is a subalgebra of V(p),
    # I is necessarily an L_k(sl_2)-module. Furthermore, the existence of a non-trivial ideal is
    # equivalent to the existence of a singular vector that generates it. Thus, both conditions must be met.
    answer_b = "both"

    # Part (c): Does the simplicity of V(p) imply it is also irreducible as an L_k(sl_2)-module?
    # No. Simplicity as a VOA is a stronger condition than irreducibility as a module for a subalgebra.
    # For p >= 2, V(p) is simple as a VOA. However, as an L_k(sl_2)-module, it decomposes into a
    # direct sum of irreducible modules, making it reducible.
    answer_c = "No"
