    # The Core Theorem
    print("Step 1: The key insight comes from the Excluded Grid Theorem for Bounded-Degree Graphs.")
    print("\nThis theorem states that a class of graphs with a bounded maximum degree has unbounded treewidth")

    # Option A
    print("A. For each k, there is a graph in C containing an induced cycle of length k.")
    print("--> This is FALSE.")
    print("    A counterexample is the class of all grid graphs. This class has a bounded degree (at most 4) and unbounded treewidth. However, grid graphs are bipartite, which means they do not contain any cycles of odd length. Therefore, they cannot contain an induced cycle of length k for any odd k.")
    print("")

    # Option B
    print("B. For each k, there is a graph in C containing the k-by-k-grid as a subgraph.")
    print("--> This is TRUE.")
    print("    This statement is a direct consequence of the Excluded Grid Theorem for Bounded-Degree Graphs, as explained in Step 1. Since the class C has unbounded treewidth, it must contain a k-by-k grid as a subgraph for any integer k.")
    print("")

    # Option C
    print("C. C is a family of expander graphs.")
    print("--> This is FALSE.")
    print("    Again, consider the class of grid graphs. An n-by-n grid can be partitioned into two large sets of vertices by cutting a small number of edges (e.g., n edges). This means its Cheeger constant, a measure of expansion, approaches 0 as n grows. A family of expander graphs must have a Cheeger constant bounded below by a positive constant.")
    print("")

    # Option D
    print("D. For each k, there is a graph in C containing an induced matching of size k.")
    print("--> This is also TRUE, but it is a weaker statement than B.")
    print("    Reasoning: A graph class with unbounded treewidth must contain graphs with an unbounded number of vertices (n). It is a known result that any graph with n vertices and maximum degree d has an induced matching of size at least Omega(n / d^2). Since n can be arbitrarily large and d is constant, the induced matching size can also be arbitrarily large.")
    print("    However, this property is not unique to classes with unbounded treewidth. For instance, the class of simple paths has bounded treewidth (treewidth = 1) but also contains arbitrarily large induced matchings. Since this property is not a characterization of unbounded treewidth, it's not the best answer.")
    print("")

    # Option E
    print("E. The graphs in C contain clique-minors of unbounded size.")
    print("--> This is FALSE.")
    print("    Grid graphs are a counterexample. As they are planar graphs, they cannot contain a K_5 (a clique of size 5) as a minor. Thus, the size of the largest clique minor in any grid graph is bounded by 4, even as its treewidth grows infinitely large.")
    print("-" * 70)

    # Conclusion
    print("Step 3: Conclusion.")
    print("\nBoth B and D are necessary properties for the class C. However, the property in B (containing large grid subgraphs) is a structural characterization that is equivalent to having unbounded treewidth for a bounded-degree class.")
    print("The property in D is a consequence of a simpler condition (having many vertices) which is implied by, but not equivalent to, unbounded treewidth.")
    print("Therefore, B is the strongest, most fundamental, and most direct consequence of the conditions given in the problem.")
