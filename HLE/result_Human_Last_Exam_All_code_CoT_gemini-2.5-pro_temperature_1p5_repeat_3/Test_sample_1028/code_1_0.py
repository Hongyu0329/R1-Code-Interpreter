    explanation = """
The Problem: When using a phylogeny of only extant (living) species, the speciation rate λ(t) and extinction rate μ(t) in a birth-death model are not uniquely identifiable. An infinite number of different λ(t) and μ(t) pairs can produce the same data likelihood.

Strategies that HELP mitigate this issue work in one of two ways:
1. Adding New Information:
   - (B) Bayesian Priors: Adds external information to constrain parameters.
   - (D, F) Fossils: Add direct evidence of past extinction events, breaking the ambiguity.

2. Reframing the Question (Reparameterization):
   - (E, G) Pulled Rates: Focus on estimating parameter combinations that ARE mathematically identifiable from the data, bypassing the problem.

Strategies that DO NOT HELP:
Simply changing the functional form of λ(t) and μ(t) without adding new information does not solve the core problem.
- (A) Piecewise-Constant: A simplification, but the identifiability issue remains within each piece.
- (C) Piecewise-Polynomial: This strategy drastically increases model complexity and flexibility. For a model that is already non-identifiable, adding more parameters without adding more data makes the problem much WORSE, not better.

Therefore, fitting a highly complex polynomial model is the strategy that does not help.
