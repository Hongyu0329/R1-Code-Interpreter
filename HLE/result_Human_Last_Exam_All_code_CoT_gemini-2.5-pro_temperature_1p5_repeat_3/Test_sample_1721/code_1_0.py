# We are looking for the largest c = |A|/N such that A+A contains no squares.
# We use a modular arithmetic construction.
# Let A = {n | n % m in I} for some modulus m and set of residues I.
# The condition is that for any i1, i2 in I, (i1+i2) % m is not a square modulo m.
# The density c is then |I|/m.

# Let's choose the modulus m = 3.
m = 3

# The set of squares modulo 3 is {0^2 % 3, 1^2 % 3, 2^2 % 3} = {0, 1}.
squares_mod_m = {pow(k, 2, m) for k in range(m)}

# We need to find a set of residues I such that I+I is disjoint from squares_mod_m.
# This means for any i1, i2 in I, (i1 + i2) % m must not be in {0, 1}.
# The only remaining residue is 2. So we need (i1 + i2) % m = 2.
# If we test the possible residues {0, 1, 2} for membership in I:
# - If 0 is in I, 0 + 0 = 0, which is a square mod 3. So 0 cannot be in I.
# - If 2 is in I, 2 + 2 = 4 % 3 = 1, which is a square mod 3. So 2 cannot be in I.
# - If 1 is in I, 1 + 1 = 2, which is not a square mod 3. This works.
# So, the only possible choice is I = {1}.
I = {1}

# The size of the set I.
I_size = len(I)

# The density c is the ratio of the size of I to the modulus m.
c = I_size / m

# A set A = {n | n % 3 == 1} has density 1/3.
# For any a1, a2 in A, a1 = 3*k1 + 1 and a2 = 3*k2 + 1.
# Their sum is a1 + a2 = 3*(k1+k2) + 2.
# So, (a1 + a2) % 3 == 2.
# Since no square number gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 3,
# the sum a1 + a2 can never be a square.

# Let's print the result based on our derivation.
