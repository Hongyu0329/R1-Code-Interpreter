    "Answering this question requires referencing the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797> guidelines for sterile compounding.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the Beyond-Use Date (BUD):\n1.  **Identify the container type:** The container is a single-dose ampule. Ampules are made of glass and are broken open; they cannot be resealed. This makes them fundamentally different from vials, which have a rubber septum.\n2.  **Identify the environment:** The ampule is opened in a \"sterile environment,\" which corresponds to an ISO Class 5 Primary Engineering Control (PEC), such as a laminar airflow workbench.\n3.  **Consult USP <797>:** According to USP <797>, once an ampule is opened, it becomes an open system that is highly susceptible to contamination. It lacks preservatives to inhibit microbial growth.\n4.  **Determine the BUD:** Because it cannot be resealed, the contents of an opened ampule must be used immediately. Any unused portion from the ampule must be discarded and cannot be stored for any period. Therefore, the BUD is effectively zero hours. This is different from a single-dose *vial*, which, if punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment, can be used for up to 12 hours. The ampule's open-system nature necessitates immediate use.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this rule.\n\n```python\n# The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for sterile preparations is determined by USP <797> guidelines.\n# These guidelines have specific rules for different container types and environments.\n\n# Define the parameters based on the user's question.\ncontainer_type = \"single dose ampule\"\nenvironment = \"sterile (ISO Class 5)\"\n\n# According to USP <797>, an ampule is a sealed container that cannot be resealed after opening.\n# This makes it an open system, and its contents must be used immediately.\n# Any unused medication must be discarded.\n# Therefore, the allowable time for use after opening is effectively zero.\nbud_in_hours = 0\n\nprint(f\"Calculating the BUD for a '{container_type}' opened in a '{environment}':\")\nprint(\"Rule: An opened ampule is an open system and must be used immediately.\")\nprint(\"Any unused portion must be discarded.\")\nprint(f\"Resulting BUD from time of opening = {bud_in_hours} hours (Immediate Use)\")\n```\n<<<0>>>"
