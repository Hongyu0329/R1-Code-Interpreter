    This function identifies and prints the letters of San Francisco propositions
    from the November 2024 election (A-O) that could be nullified by a
    competing measure on the same ballot.

    The competing pairs are:
    - B and C
    - D and E
    - I and J
    - K and L

    In each pair, if both propositions pass, the one with fewer 'yes' votes
    is nullified. Therefore, every proposition in these pairs could potentially
    be nullified.
