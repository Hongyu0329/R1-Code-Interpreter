def solve_fixed_point_problem():
    """
    This function solves the problem by providing the logical steps and the final answer.
    
    The problem asks for the smallest possible number of fixed points for a continuous function f: R -> R
    that satisfies the condition: |f(x) - f(y)| < a|x - y| for some constant a <= 1 and all distinct x, y.

    Step 1: Analyze the condition.
    The condition implies that the supremum of the absolute slopes of secant lines, K, must be strictly less than 1.
    Let K = sup_{x!=y} |f(x) - f(y)| / |x - y|.
    The condition is |f(x) - f(y)| / |x - y| < a for a <= 1.
    This implies K < a <= 1, which means K < 1.

    Step 2: Apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem.
    A function where |f(x) - f(y)| <= K|x - y| for some K < 1 is a "contraction mapping".
    The Banach Fixed-Point Theorem states that a contraction mapping on a complete metric space
    (like the real numbers R) has exactly one fixed point.

    Step 3: Conclusion.
    Since any function f satisfying the condition must be a contraction mapping on R, it must have
    exactly one fixed point. Therefore, the number of fixed points for any such function is 1.

    The smallest possible number of fixed points is thus 1.
