# The user wants me to determine the most relevant document for two questions and provide the answer.

# Step 1: Analyze Question 1: "What animal's coat color changed as a baby?"
# Document 1 states the change happens "at a few months old". This is a strong match for "as a baby".
# Document 2 states the change happens "As they reached puberty". This is a weaker match for "as a baby".
# Conclusion for Q1: Document 1 is more relevant. Rank = 1.

# Step 2: Analyze Question 2: "What animal's coat color did not change as a baby?"
# Both documents state that "Cows retained the reddish-brown colour".
# However, the question specifies the timeframe "as a baby".
# Document 1 provides a context of change happening "at a few months old" (as a baby) for the bulls.
# This makes the statement about the cows not changing a more direct and relevant answer to what happened "as a baby".
# Document 2's context is puberty, which is less relevant to the specific timeframe in the question.
# Conclusion for Q2: Document 1 is more relevant. Rank = 1.

# Step 3: Combine the rankings.
# The ranking for Question 1 is 1.
# The ranking for Question 2 is 1.
# The final combined answer is "1-1".

# Step 4: Find the corresponding letter choice.
# "1-1" corresponds to choice A.
final_answer_choice = "A"

# Print the final answer in the specified format.
# The instruction "output each number in the final equation" is interpreted as providing the final choice 'A', which represents the '1-1' ranking.
rank_q1 = 1
rank_q2 = 1
print(f"The rank for Question 1 is {rank_q1}. The rank for Question 2 is {rank_q2}.")
print(f"This corresponds to the combination {rank_q1}-{rank_q2}.")
print(f"Final Answer is choice {final_answer_choice}.")
print(f"<<<{final_answer_choice}>>>")
