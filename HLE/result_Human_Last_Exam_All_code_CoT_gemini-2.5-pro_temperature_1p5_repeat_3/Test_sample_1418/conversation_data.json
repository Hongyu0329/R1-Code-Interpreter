    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$:\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the structure of the field extension.**\n    Let $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$. We can view this as a tower of extensions.\n    Let the base field be $K_0 = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    Let $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a degree 2 extension.\n    Let $K_2 = K_1(\\sqrt{3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. Since $\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, this is a degree 2 extension over $K_1$. The total degree $[K_2 : \\mathbb{Q}]$ is 4. This is the well-known biquadratic extension, and its Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\n2.  **Determine the degree of the final extension.**\n    Let $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. Then $L = K_2(\\alpha)$.\n    The element $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is in $K_2$.\n    The extension $L/K_2$ is quadratic, i.e., $[L:K_2]=2$, if and only if $\\alpha^2$ is not a square in $K_2$.\n    To check this, we can compute the norm of $\\alpha^2$ with respect to one of the quadratic subfields of $K_2$, for instance $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois automorphism for $K_2/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $\\sigma: \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\n    $N_{K_2/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\alpha^2) = \\alpha^2 \\cdot \\sigma(\\alpha^2)$\n    $= ((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})) \\cdot ((2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}))$\n    $= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2)$\n    $= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$\n    For this norm to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the number 6 must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 6$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. This would mean $a^2+2b^2=6$ and $2ab=0$. This has no rational solutions for $a$ and $b$.\n    Since the norm is not a square in the subfield, $\\alpha^2$ cannot be a square in $K_2$.\n    Therefore, $[L:K_2]=2$, and the total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K_2] \\cdot [K_2:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Galois Group.**\n    Since $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the extension is Galois, and its Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8.\n    The group structure can be found by examining the action of automorphisms on the generators $\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3}$, and $\\alpha$. We can find three commuting automorphisms of order 2, which implies the group is abelian and every element (except identity) has order 2. The only group of order 8 with this property is $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\n4.  **Use Python to verify.**\n    We can construct the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and then use a symbolic mathematics library like `sympy` to compute its Galois group. The minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ is found to be $P(x) = x^8 - 24x^6 + 144x^4 - 288x^2 + 144$. The splitting field of this polynomial is precisely $L$. We will use Python to compute the Galois group of this polynomial.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy.polys.galoistools import galois_group\nfrom sympy import Poly, QQ, Symbol\nfrom sympy.abc import x\n\ndef solve_galois_group():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function computes the Galois group for the given field extension.\n    It does so by finding the minimal polynomial of a generator of the extension\n    and then using sympy's galois_group function.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The minimal polynomial for alpha = sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))) over Q is\n    # p(x) = x^8 - 24*x^6 + 144*x^4 - 288*x^2 + 144.\n    # The derivation is shown in the text above.\n    \n    coeffs = [1, 0, -24, 0, 144, 0, -288, 0, 144]\n    p = Poly(coeffs, x, domain=QQ)\n    \n    print(\"The minimal polynomial of a generator of the field extension is:\")\n    # We want to print the polynomial and also output the numbers in the equation\n    # as requested by the prompt.\n    poly_str = str(p.as_expr())\n    print(f\"P(x) = {poly_str} = 0\")\n    print(\"\\nThe coefficients of the polynomial equation x^8 - 24*x^6 + 144*x^4 - 288*x^2 + 144 = 0 are:\")\n    print(\"coefficient of x^8: 1\")\n    print(\"coefficient of x^6: -24\")\n    print(\"coefficient of x^4: 144\")\n    print(\"coefficient of x^2: -288\")\n    print(\"constant term: 144\")\n    \n    # Compute the Galois group\n    G = galois_group(p)\n    \n    # The group is returned as a PermutationGroup object.\n    # We can check its properties to identify it.\n    group_order = G.order()\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe order of the Galois group is: {group_order}\")\n    \n    # Let's identify the group structure.
