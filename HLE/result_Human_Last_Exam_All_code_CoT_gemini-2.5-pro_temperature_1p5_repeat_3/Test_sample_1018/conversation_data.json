    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Compute the simplicial volume of each surface.** The simplicial volume of a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\geq 2$ is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g - 4$. For genus $g=0$ or $g=1$, the simplicial volume is 0.\n2.  **Use the product formula.** For two closed, oriented manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$ of dimensions $n_1$ and $n_2$ respectively, the simplicial volume of their product is given by Gromov's product formula:\n    $\\|M_1 \\times M_2\\| = \\binom{n_1+n_2}{n_1} \\|M_1\\| \\|M_2\\|$.\n3.  **Apply the formulas to our specific case.**\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{31}$: $g_1 = 31$, dimension $n_1 = 2$.\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{17}$: $g_2 = 17$, dimension $n_2 = 2$.\n\nThe Python code below will carry out these calculations step-by-step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef simplicial_volume_surface(g):\n  \"\"\"\n  Calculates the simplicial volume of a closed orientable surface of genus g.\n  The formula is ||Σ_g|| = 4g - 4 for g >= 2, and 0 otherwise.\n  \"\"\"\n  if g >= 2:\n    return 4 * g - 4\n  else:\n    return 0\n\ndef combinations(n, k):\n  \"\"\"\n  Calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!).\n  \"\"\"\n  if k < 0 or k > n:\n    return 0\n  return math.factorial(n) // (math.factorial(k) * math.factorial(n - k))\n\n# Given genera and dimensions\ng1 = 31\ng2 = 17\nn1 = 2\nn2 = 2\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate simplicial volume of the first surface ---\nsv1 = simplicial_volume_surface(g1)\nprint(f\"The first surface is Σ_{g1} of genus g₁ = {g1}.\")\nprint(f\"Its simplicial volume is ||Σ_{g1}|| = 4 * {g1} - 4 = {sv1}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate simplicial volume of the second surface ---\nsv2 = simplicial_volume_surface(g2)\nprint(f\"The second surface is Σ_{g2} of genus g₂ = {g2}.\")\nprint(f\"Its simplicial volume is ||Σ_{g2}|| = 4 * {g2} - 4 = {sv2}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the coefficient for the product formula ---\n# The dimensions are n₁ = 2 and n₂ = 2.\nn_total = n1 + n2\ncoeff = combinations(n_total, n1)\nprint(f\"The product manifold is Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2} of dimension {n1} + {n2} = {n_total}.\")\nprint(f\"The coefficient for the product formula is C({n1}+{n2}, {n1}) = C({n_total}, {n1}) = {coeff}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate the final simplicial volume of the product ---\ntotal_sv = coeff * sv1 * sv2\nprint(\"The simplicial volume of the product is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"||Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2}|| = C({n_total}, {n1}) * ||Σ_{g1}|| * ||Σ_{g2}||\")\nprint(f\"||Σ_{31} x Σ_{17}|| = {coeff} * {sv1} * {sv2} = {total_sv}\")\n\n```\n<<<46080>>>"
