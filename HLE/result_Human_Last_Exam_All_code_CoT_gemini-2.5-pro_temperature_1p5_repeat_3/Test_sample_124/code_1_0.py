    This function identifies the true statements about probabilistic graphical models and prints them.
    
    A: False. Approximate inference is often more efficient.
    B: False. The algorithm is not resilient to high treewidth.
    C: True. The nodes are cliques and hold their joint distributions (potentials).
    D: False. The premise is false.
    E: True. High treewidth leads to exponential complexity, making it impractical.
    F: False. Duplicate of D.
    G: True. The need for large joint distribution tables is the reason for its non-resilience to high treewidth.
    H: False. The relationship is exponential, not linear.
    I: True. This correctly states the exponential relationship.
    J: False. Efficiency changes dramatically.
    L: True. This is a correct consequence and alternative formulation of the Running Intersection Property.
