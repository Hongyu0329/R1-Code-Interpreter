    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the terms:** I will first break down the meaning of a \"finite ultrametric space,\" a \"Banach space,\" \"cardinality K,\" and an \"isometric embedding.\" I will pay special attention to the cardinality $K$ of a Banach space.\n2.  **Establish a Lower Bound:** I will demonstrate that if at least one isometric embedding from a space $X$ to a Banach space $B$ exists, then there must be at least $K$ such embeddings. This is due to the vector space structure of $B$, which allows for translations.\n3.  **Show the Lower Bound is Achievable:** I will construct a specific, simple example of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is exactly $K$. This will show that the lower bound found in the previous step is the \"smallest possible\" number.\n4.  **Consider Edge Cases:** I will briefly touch upon the case where zero embeddings are possible, but argue why this is likely not the intended answer to the question \"what is the smallest possible number.\"\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** I will combine these points to arrive at a final answer.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that walks through these logical steps using `print` statements and then outputs the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_embedding_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to find the smallest possible number\n    of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B of cardinality K.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"This program determines the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B of cardinality K.\")\n    print(\"The reasoning is as follows:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the cardinality K of the Banach space B\n    print(\"Step 1: On the cardinality K of a Banach space B.\")\n    print(\"A Banach space B is a vector space over the real or complex numbers.
