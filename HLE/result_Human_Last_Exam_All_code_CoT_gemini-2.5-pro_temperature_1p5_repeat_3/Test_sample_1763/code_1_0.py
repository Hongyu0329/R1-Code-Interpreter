def solve():
  """
  This function calculates the smallest cardinality of a family F of topological spaces
  with the property that every infinite topological space has a subspace
  homeomorphic to some element of F.

  The reasoning is as follows:
  1. A lower bound is established by considering three specific topological spaces:
     - The indiscrete space (F_I)
     - The discrete space (F_D)
     - The cofinite space (F_C)
     These spaces are not homeomorphic, and any universal family F must contain a representative
     for each, because any infinite subspace of F_I is indiscrete, of F_D is discrete, and of F_C is cofinite.
     This shows the cardinality of F must be at least 3.

  2. An upper bound is established by a known theorem in general topology which states that
     any infinite topological space contains an infinite subspace that is either indiscrete,
     discrete, or cofinite. This means the family {F_I, F_D, F_C} is sufficient.
     This shows a family of cardinality 3 exists.

  3. Combining the lower and upper bounds, the smallest cardinality is 3.
