        A genomic mutation rate is a biological trait that is subject to natural selection.
        - A rate that is too high is detrimental because it creates a high 'mutational load' of harmful mutations, lowering population fitness.
        - A rate that is too low can be disadvantageous as it limits the potential for adaptation to changing environments.
        Therefore, natural selection acts to find an optimal balance, exerting a stabilizing pressure that maintains a relatively constant, non-zero mutation rate. The other options describe random forces (B, E) or are consequences/patterns of mutation (C, D), not the primary stabilizing force.
