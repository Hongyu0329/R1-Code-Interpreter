    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, I will use the Euclidean division algorithm for polynomial matrices. This method involves creating a stacked matrix and reducing it to its row-echelon form using elementary row operations.\n\n### My Plan:\n1.  **Construct a stacked matrix:** I will form a single 4x2 matrix `M` by stacking `P1` on top of `P2`.\n2.  **Perform Elementary Row Operations:** I will apply a sequence of row operations to `M` to simplify it. The allowed operations are:\n    *   Swapping any two rows.\n    *   Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    *   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n3.  **Find the GCRD:** The goal of the row reduction is to get the matrix into a form where the lower rows are all zeros. The remaining non-zero rows will form a matrix `G` that is a GCRD of the original matrices `P1` and `P2`.\n4.  **Simplify to Canonical Form:** The GCRD is unique up to left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant). I will simplify the resulting matrix `G` to its simplest canonical form, the row-echelon form, which in this case turns out to be the identity matrix.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will use Python with the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic matrix operations. The final code will print the elements of the resulting GCRD matrix.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps:\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two\n    polynomial matrices P1 and P2 using the row reduction method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbol for the polynomial variable\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([[s**2 + s, -s],\n                       [-s**2 - 1, s**2]])\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([[s, 0],\n                       [-s - 1, 1]])\n\n    # To find the GCRD, we stack the matrices and perform elementary row operations\n    # to find a basis for the row space.\n    # Form the stacked matrix M = [P1; P2]\n    M = P1.col_join(P2)\n\n    # Create a copy of the matrix to perform row reductions\n    M_reduced = M.copy()\n\n    # Perform a series of row operations to bring the matrix to a row-echelon form.\n    # This is analogous to Gaussian elimination for polynomial matrices.\n    # The exact sequence of operations can vary, but the result for the GCRD basis is the same.\n    # Step 1: Use row 2 (index 2 of M) to simplify other rows.\n    M_reduced.row_op(0, lambda val, j: sympy.expand(val - (s + 1) * M_reduced[2, j]))\n    M_reduced.row_op(1, lambda val, j: sympy.expand(val + s * M_reduced[2, j]))\n    M_reduced.row_op(3, lambda val, j: sympy.expand(val + M_reduced[2, j]))\n    \n    # Step 2: Use the new row 3 (which is now [-1, 1]) as a pivot.\n    M_reduced.row_swap(0, 3) # Swap row 0 and 3\n    M_reduced.row_op(0, lambda val, j: -val) # Multiply the new row 0 by -1 to get a leading 1\n    \n    # Step 3: Eliminate other elements in the first column using the new pivot row 0.\n    M_reduced.row_op(1, lambda val, j: sympy.expand(val + M_reduced[0, j]))\n    M_reduced.row_op(2, lambda val, j: sympy.expand(val - s * M_reduced[0, j]))\n    \n    # Step 4: Reduce the remaining sub-matrix in the second column.\n    M_reduced.row_op(3, lambda val, j: sympy.expand(val + M_reduced[2, j]))\n    M_reduced.row_op(1, lambda val, j: sympy.expand(val - s * M_reduced[2, j]))\n    M_reduced.row_op(2, lambda val, j: sympy.expand(val + s * M_reduced[1, j]))\n\n    # After reduction, the matrix has two non-zero rows which form a GCRD.\n    # These rows are [1, -1] and [0, -1]. We extract them.\n    GCRD = M_reduced.minor_submatrix(0, 0, 2, 2)\n\n    # To get the simplest, canonical form (row-echelon form), we do final reductions.\n    GCRD.row_op(1, lambda val, j: -val)  # R1 -> -R1, GCRD becomes [[1, -1], [0, 1]]\n    GCRD.row_op(0, lambda val, j: sympy.expand(val + GCRD[1, j])) # R0 -> R0 + R1\n\n    # The resulting GCRD is the identity matrix.\n    final_gcrd = GCRD\n\n    print(\"The greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of P1 and P2 is:\")\n\n    # Print each element of the final matrix as requested.\n    row1 = [final_gcrd[0, 0], final_gcrd[0, 1]]\n    row2 = [final_gcrd[1, 0], final_gcrd[1, 1]]\n    print(f\"[{row1[0]}, {row1[1]}]\")\n    print(f\"[{row2[0]}, {row2[1]}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
