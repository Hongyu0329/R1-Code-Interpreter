    "An analysis of the provided Java program and the problem statement reveals that the program is not a correct solution. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and the corrected implementation in C.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem:** The goal is to calculate the final value of a variable `x`, initially 0, after applying a series of increment (`++`) or decrement (`--`) operations. The statements can appear in four formats: `++X`, `X++`, `--X`, and `X--`.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Provided Java Code:**\n    *   The Java code reads each statement string.\n    *   It uses `test.contains(\"++X\")` to check for increments and `test.contains(\"--X\")` for decrements.\n    *   This logic correctly handles the cases `++X` and `--X`.\n    *   However, it fails for `X++` because the string \"X++\" does not contain the substring \"++X\". Similarly, it fails for `X--`.\n    *   Therefore, the Java program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible valid inputs as described in the problem.\n\n3.  **Design an Efficient C Solution:**\n    *   The most efficient way to determine the operation is to observe a key difference between the increment and decrement statements. In all four valid forms (`++X`, `X++`, `--X`, `X--`), the character at the middle position (index 1) is always `+` for an increment and `-` for a decrement.\n    *   This means we can read the 3-character string and check only the middle character. This avoids complex string comparisons and is very fast, requiring only a single character comparison per statement.\n    *   The C program will:\n        1.  Initialize `x = 0`.\n        2.  Read `n`, the number of statements.\n        3.  Loop `n` times. In each iteration, it reads the statement into a character array.\n        4.  It checks the middle character of the array. If it's `+`, it increments `x`. Otherwise, it decrements `x`.\n        5.  To satisfy the user prompt's special requirement of printing the full equation, the code will first print the initial value `0`, then for each operation, it will print ` + 1` or ` - 1`. Finally, it will print the resulting value of `x`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Efficiency Metrics (for n=100):**\n    *   **x (Character Comparisons):** The core logic relies on one comparison per statement: `statement[1] == '+'`. For 100 statements, this results in **100** character comparisons. This is the minimum required to logically distinguish the operations.\n    *   **y (Memory Size):** The C program requires variables to store `n`, `x`, the loop counter `i`, and a buffer for the statement. Using standard 4-byte integers and a 4-byte character array (for 3 chars + null terminator), the total memory is `4 + 4 + 4 + 4 =` **16 bytes**. This is a practical and efficient memory footprint for this task.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Java program is incorrect. The final answer should be in the format `Nx+y`.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    // Read the total number of statements\n    if (scanf(\"%d\", &n) != 1) {\n        return 1; // Basic error handling\n    }\n\n    int x = 0;\n    char statement[4]; // Buffer for statements like \"X++\" and null terminator\n\n    // As requested, print the start of the equation.\n    printf(\"0\");\n\n    // Process each statement\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%s\", statement);\n\n        // The middle character determines the operation\n        if (statement[1] == '+') {\n            printf(\" + 1\");\n            x++;\n        } else {\n            printf(\" - 1\");\n            x--;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the final result to complete the equation\n    printf(\" = %d\\n\", x);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n<<<N100+16>>>"
