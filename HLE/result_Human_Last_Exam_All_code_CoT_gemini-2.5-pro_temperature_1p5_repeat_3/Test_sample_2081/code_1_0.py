# Step 1: Define T from the problem statement
# T = ln(10^34) is equivalent to T = 34 * ln(10)
T_val = 34 * math.log(10)

# Step 2: Calculate e^T. This is a key component of the formula.
exp_T = math.exp(T_val)

# Step 3: Calculate R^2 using the derived formula R^2 = 0.5 * e^T * (e^T + 1)
# This formula comes from the solvability condition of the first-order perturbation problem.
# The numbers in the equation are 0.5 and 1.
factor1 = 0.5
factor2 = 1.0
# Due to standard floating-point precision, (exp_T + 1.0) will be evaluated as exp_T
# because exp_T is extremely large compared to 1.
R_squared = factor1 * exp_T * (exp_T + factor2)

# Step 4: Calculate R by taking the square root.
R = math.sqrt(R_squared)

# Step 5: Print the results as requested, showing the numbers in the final equation.
