# My thinking process to solve the riddle and determine the sequence.

# 1. Initialize a placeholder for our sequence of five numbers.
sequence = [None] * 5

# 2. Decipher the clue for the fifth number:
# "the fifth, who never had a thing and lastly follows."
# "Never had a thing" implies the number 0.
# "Lastly follows" means it is at the end of the sequence (position 5, index 4).
fifth_number = 0
sequence[4] = fifth_number

# 3. Decipher the clue for number three:
# "Number three is the strongest and it protects the last;"
# "Protects the last" means it comes directly before the last number.
# This places the number 3 in position 4 (index 3).
number_three = 3
sequence[3] = number_three

# 4. Decipher the clue for number 1:
# "Number 1 is the first to have something..."
# "Is the first" is a strong positional clue, placing the number 1 in position 1 (index 0).
number_one = 1
sequence[0] = number_one

# 5. Decipher the clue for numbers 2 and 4:
# "Number 4 likes two the most and it always goes behind."
# This establishes the ordered pair (2, 4). The only remaining open slots
# are positions 2 and 3 (indices 1 and 2).
# Therefore, 2 goes in position 2, and 4 goes in position 3.
number_two = 2
sequence[1] = number_two
number_four = 4
sequence[2] = number_four

# 6. Final verification and output.
# The resulting sequence is [1, 2, 4, 3, 0].
# This sequence satisfies all clues, including the riddle's premise that "Number three is the strongest",
# which we must accept as a rule for this specific puzzle.
# The instruction is to output each number in the final sequence.
num1, num2, num3, num4, num5 = sequence
print(f"The final sequence is: {num1}, {num2}, {num3}, {num4}, {num5}")
