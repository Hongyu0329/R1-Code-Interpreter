    This function calculates the largest possible dimension for the quotient ring R/I.

    The problem describes a setup from invariant theory. Let G be a finite group
    acting on a polynomial ring R. Let I be the ideal generated by positive-degree
    homogeneous G-invariant polynomials. The dimension of the quotient ring R/I,
    known as the coinvariant algebra, is given by a fundamental theorem.

    # The action of G on the polynomial ring C[x_1, ..., x_10] is defined by
    # a group homomorphism rho: G -> GL_10(C).

    # According to a key theorem in invariant theory, the dimension of the
    # coinvariant algebra R/I is equal to the order of the effective group
    # acting on the space, which is the image of rho, G_eff = rho(G).

    # and therefore also in GL_10(C).
