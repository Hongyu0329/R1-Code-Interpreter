    "My plan to identify the African flags with the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Flag of Denmark**: First, I will determine the rank of the Danish flag. I'll represent its geometric pattern as a simplified matrix. The prompt specifies to assume values are chosen for maximal rank. This means different colors are represented by distinct, linearly independent numerical values. I'll assign numbers to the colors (e.g., Red=1, White=2) and calculate the rank of the resulting matrix. I will show the equation and numbers used in the calculation.\n\n2.  **Establish the Target Rank**: The rank calculated for the Danish flag (which is 2) becomes the target rank we need to find in other flags.\n\n3.  **Analyze African Flags**: I will then analyze the geometric structure of all African national flags to determine their rank based on the same principle.\n    *   **Rank 1 Flags**: Flags with simple structures, like only horizontal stripes or only vertical stripes, will have a rank of 1 because all their matrix rows (or columns) are linearly dependent (scalar multiples of each other).\n    *   **Rank 2 Flags**: Flags with more complex, \"two-dimensional\" patterns will have a rank of 2. These are flags where the pattern is not just simple stripes. This typically includes flags with crosses, hoist-side triangles, or cantons superimposed on stripes. These features create at least two linearly independent row or column patterns in the matrix representation.\n\n4.  **List the Matching Flags**: I will compile a list of all African flags whose structure results in a rank of 2.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: Finally, I will write a Python script that presents this entire analysis, including the matrix calculations and the final list of countries. The script will explicitly print out the numbers used in the rank calculation to fulfill the user's request.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies African flags with the same matrix rank as the Danish flag.\n    It explains the methodology, calculates the rank of the Danish flag, and then\n    lists the African flags that share this rank based on their geometric structure.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Task: Find African flags with the same matrix rank as Denmark's flag ---\\n\")\n\n    # --- Introduction ---\n    print(\"--- Analytical Method ---\")\n    print(\"1.
