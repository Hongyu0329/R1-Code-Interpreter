    # --- Position Analysis ---
    print("--- Step 1: Analyzing the Position ---")
    print("FEN: 8/P7/1np1p3/5k2/6p1/1P1NK3/8/8 w - - 0 1\n")
    print("White's Strengths: The a7-pawn is a winning threat.")
    print("Black's Defense: The Knight on b6 is the only piece preventing the pawn's promotion.")
    print("White's Goal: Force the promotion of the a-pawn by deflecting or overpowering the b6-Knight.\n")

    # --- Candidate Move Evaluation ---
    print("--- Step 2: Evaluating Candidate Moves ---\n")

    # Move A
    print("Move A: a8=Q")
    print("Analysis: This is a direct attempt to promote, but it's a mistake.")
    print("Result: Black will play 1...Nxa8. After the trade, White's main threat is gone.")
    print("Evaluation: Black's active King and extra pawns give Black a winning position. This is a blunder.\n")

    # Move B
    print("Move B: Nc5")
    print("Analysis: This is a powerful and forcing move. It attacks the e6-pawn and prepares to dislodge the b6-Knight.")
    print("Result: Black's responses are difficult. For example, if 1...Na8 (to guard the pawn), White improves with 2.Kd4. If Black's king moves with 1...Ke5, White can play 2.Na6, forcing the knight away and then attacking other weaknesses.")
    print("Evaluation: Excellent. It creates immediate and decisive threats.\n")

    # Move C
    print("Move C: Kd4")
    print("Analysis: This is a strong move that follows the endgame principle of activating the King.")
    print("Result: The King moves closer to the action, ready to support its pieces and challenge Black's King.")
    print("Evaluation: Very good. It is a solid, positional way to improve White's position and is also winning.\n")

    # Move D
    print("Move D: Kf2")
    print("Analysis: This is a passive King move.")
    print("Result: It moves the King away from the center, allowing the Black King to become more powerful (e.g., via 1...Ke4).")
    print("Evaluation: Poor. It weakens White's position.\n")

    # Move E
    print("Move E: Nf4")
    print("Analysis: This move creates threats against Black's pawns.")
    print("Result: It allows Black to create counterplay. For instance, after 1...Kg5, White's Knight must retreat.")
    print("Evaluation: Suboptimal. Not as effective as activating the King or Knight differently.\n")
    
    # Move F
    print("Move F: b4")
    print("Analysis: This move challenges Black's pawn structure.")
    print("Result: It can be a useful idea, but it is too slow compared to other options. It allows Black's King to become very active with 1...Ke4.")
    print("Evaluation: Suboptimal.\n")

    # --- Conclusion ---
    print("--- Step 3: Conclusion ---\n")
    print("Comparing the strong moves, Kd4 is excellent, but Nc5 is even more precise.")
    print("Nc5 forces Black into a difficult defensive task immediately and is the most efficient path to victory.")
    print("The best move for White is Nc5.")
