    print("1. Definitions:")
    print("   - A space is 'connected' if it cannot be split into two disjoint non-empty open sets.")
    print("   - A space is 'totally disconnected' if its only connected subsets are single points.")
    print("   - A point 'x' is a 'dispersion point' of a connected space X if X \\ {x} is totally disconnected.")
    print("\n2. The Proof by Contradiction:")
    print("   Let D be the set of dispersion points. Assume for contradiction that |D| >= 2.")
    print("   Let x1 and x2 be two distinct dispersion points in X.\n")
    
    print("3. Step A: Analyze X \\ {x2}")
    print("   - By definition, Y2 = X \\ {x2} is totally disconnected.")
    print("   - Since Y2 is a totally disconnected metric space with more than one point, it can be separated.")
    print("   - So, Y2 = U U V, where U and V are disjoint, non-empty, and open in Y2.")
    print("   - Let's place x1 in U. So, x1 is in U.\n")

    print("4. Step B: Relate back to X")
    print("   - Since U and V are open in Y2 (which is open in X), U and V are also open sets in X.")
    print("   - We can write X = U U V U {x2}.")
    print("   - Since X is connected, x2 must be a limit point of both U and V to 'connect' them.")
    print("   - This means the closure of V in X is cl(V) = V U {x2}.\n")

    print("5. Step C: Use the other dispersion point, x1")
    print("   - Now consider Y1 = X \\ {x1}, which is totally disconnected by definition.")
    print("   - The set C = cl(V) = V U {x2} is a subset of Y1 (because x1 is in U).")
    print("   - C is a closed subset of X, and therefore it is a compact set.\n")

    print("6. Step D: The Contradiction")
    print("   - C is a compact subset of the totally disconnected space Y1.")
    print("   - This implies C must be totally disconnected. Since C is not a single point (V is open), C is disconnected.")
    print("   - Since the compact set C is disconnected, we can write C = A U B, where A and B are disjoint, non-empty, and closed in C (and thus in X).")
    print("   - Let x2 be in A. Then B is a non-empty closed subset of V.")
    print("   - It can be shown that B is also open in X. A non-empty set that is both closed and open in X contradicts the fact that X is connected.\n")
    
    print("7. Conclusion of Proof:")
    print("   - The assumption that there are two or more dispersion points leads to a contradiction.")
    print("   - Therefore, a compact connected metric space can have at most one dispersion point. |D| <= 1.\n")
    
    print("8. Final Answer:")
    print("   - Examples of spaces with one dispersion point exist (e.g., the Knaster-Kuratowski fan).")
    print("   - Therefore, the maximum number is exactly 1.")
    
    max_cardinality = 1
    print("\nFinal Equation:")
    print(f"Maximum cardinality of the set of dispersion points = {max_cardinality}")
