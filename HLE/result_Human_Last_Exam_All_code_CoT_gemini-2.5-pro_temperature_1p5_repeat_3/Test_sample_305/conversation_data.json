    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Mathematical Object**: We are looking for the number of binary operations on a set with 3 elements. Let's name the set $S = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. A binary operation is a function $f: S \\times S \\to S$. This operation must satisfy two conditions:\n    *   **Commutativity**: For any two elements $x, y \\in S$, $f(x, y) = f(y, x)$.\n    *   **Associativity**: For any three elements $x, y, z \\in S$, $f(f(x, y), z) = f(x, f(y, z))$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Problem with Commutativity**:\n    *   A binary operation on a set of 3 elements can be represented by a $3 \\times 3$ multiplication table (or Cayley table).\n    *   The commutativity condition implies that this table must be symmetric about its main diagonal. This means we only need to define the values for pairs $(x, y)$ where $x \\le y$.\n    *   For a set of 3 elements, these pairs are $(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)$. There are $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \\frac{3(4)}{2} = 6$ such pairs.\n    *   The result for each of these 6 pairs can be any of the 3 elements in $S$. Therefore, there are $3^6 = 729$ possible commutative binary operations.\n\n3.  **Check for Associativity with a Brute-Force Algorithm**:\n    *   Now, we must filter these 729 commutative operations to find out how many are also associative.\n    *   We can do this programmatically by generating each of the 729 operations and testing it for associativity.\n    *   The plan for the script is as follows:\n        1.  Initialize a counter to zero.\n        2.  Iterate through all $3^6 = 729$ possible ways to define the 6 independent values in the commutative multiplication table.\n        3.  For each definition, construct the full $3 \\times 3$ table.\n        4.  Check if the associative property $f(f(x, y), z) = f(x, f(y, z))$ holds for all $3^3=27$ possible combinations of $(x, y, z)$ from the set $S$.\n        5.  If the operation is associative, increment the counter.\n        6.  After checking all 729 operations, print the final value of the counter.\n\nThis approach will systematically count every possible operation that meets both criteria.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_associative_commutative_operations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements.\n    A brute-force approach is used, checking every possible commutative operation for associativity.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Let the set be S = {0, 1, 2}.\n    S = (0, 1, 2)\n    num_elements = len(S)\n\n    # For a commutative operation on n elements, we only need to define the operation\n    # for n*(n+1)/2 pairs.
