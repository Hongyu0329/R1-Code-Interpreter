    "To find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function $H(s)$, we follow these steps:\n\n**1. Initial Factorization:**\nFirst, we express the transfer function matrix $H(s)$ as a left fraction $H(s) = D_0^{-1}(s)N_0(s)$, where $D_0(s)$ and $N_0(s)$ are polynomial matrices, but not necessarily coprime. A straightforward way to do this is to choose $D_0(s)$ as a diagonal matrix where each diagonal element is the least common multiple of the denominators in the corresponding row of $H(s)$.\n\nFor the given $H(s)$:\n$H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n- For the first row, the denominators are $(s+1)$ and $1$. The least common multiple is $(s+1)$.\n- For the second row, the denominators are $(s^2-1)$ and $1$. The least common multiple is $(s^2-1)$.\n\nThis gives us an initial diagonal matrix $D_0(s)$:\n$D_0(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nWe then find $N_0(s)$ by computing $N_0(s) = D_0(s)H(s)$:\n$N_0(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n**2. Test for Coprimeness:**\nThe matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime if the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex values of $s$. A rank drop can occur at the roots of $\\det(D_0(s))$.\n$\\det(D_0(s)) = (s+1)(s^2-1) = (s+1)^2(s-1)$. The roots are $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n\nLet's check the rank of $[D_0(s) \\quad N_0(s)]$ at these roots:\n$[D_0(s) \\quad N_0(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 & s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n- At $s=1$: $\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. The rows are linearly independent, so the rank is 2.\n- At $s=-1$: $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & -2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. The second row is a multiple of the first, so the rank is 1.\n\nSince the rank drops at $s=-1$, the factorization is not coprime. This indicates a common left divisor related to the factor $(s+1)$.\n\n**3. Extract the Common Factor:**\nThe rank drop at $s=-1$ means there's a linear combination of the rows of $[D_0(-1) \\quad N_0(-1)]$ that equals zero. We see that `row 1 + row 2 = 0`. This implies that the polynomial vector `row 1(s) + row 2(s)` must have a factor of $(s+1)$.\n\nLet's perform a row operation. Let the new second row be $R_2'(s) = R_1(s) + R_2(s)$:\n$R_2'(s) = [s+1, s^2-1, s-1+2, s+1] = [s+1, (s+1)(s-1), s+1, s+1]$\nWe can see the common factor $(s+1)$. Dividing by it gives the new row for our coprime factorization:\n$R_2''(s) = [1, s-1, 1, 1]$\n\nOur new coprime matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are formed from the first row of the original matrix and this new second row:\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n$N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n**4. Final Result:**\nThe pair $(D(s), N(s))$ gives a left coprime factorization. We can verify that $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full rank for all $s$, and $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$. The following python code automates these steps and prints the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_left_coprime_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates a left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s)\n    for the given transfer function matrix H(s).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable s\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the transfer function matrix H(s)\n    H = sympy.Matrix([\n        [(s-1)/(s+1), 1],\n        [2/(s**2-1), 0]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Find an initial, non-coprime factorization D0(s) and N0(s).\")\n    # Choose D0(s) as a diagonal matrix of row-wise LCMs of denominators\n    d1 = sympy.lcm(sympy.denom((s-1)/(s+1)), sympy.denom(1))\n    d2 = sympy.lcm(sympy.denom(2/(s**2-1)), sympy.denom(0))\n    D0 = sympy.diag(d1, d2)\n    \n    # Calculate N0(s) = D0(s) * H(s)\n    N0 = sympy.simplify(D0 * H)\n\n    print(\"Initial D0(s):\")\n    sympy.pprint(D0)\n    print(\"\\nInitial N0(s):\")\n    sympy.pprint(N0)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Check for coprimeness by testing the rank of [D0(s) | N0(s)].\")\n    M0 = D0.row_join(N0)\n    det_D0 = D0.det()\n    problematic_s_roots = sympy.roots(det_D0, s)\n    \n    print(f\"The rank can drop at the roots of det(D0(s)): {list(problematic_s_roots.keys())}\")\n    \n    # Check the rank at the problematic root s = -1\n    s_val = -1\n    M0_at_s_val = M0.subs(s, s_val)\n    rank_at_s_val = M0_at_s_val.rank()\n    \n    print(f\"At s = {s_val}, the rank of [D0(s) | N0(s)] is {rank_at_s_val}.\")\n    if rank_at_s_val < M0.rows:\n        print(\"The rank is less than the number of rows, so the factorization is not coprime.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Extract the common left divisor to find the coprime factorization.\")\n    # At s = -1, we see that R1 + R2 = 0.
