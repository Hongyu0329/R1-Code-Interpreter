def compute_scl():
    """
    This function computes the stable commutator length (scl) of the specified element.

    Step 1: Identify the group G.
    The group G is the set of homeomorphisms of the real line that preserve the set of dyadic rationals Z[1/2],
    are piecewise affine with slopes in 2^Z, have breakpoints in Z[1/2], and commute with translation by 1.
    This group is the lift of the group PL_2(S^1) to R.

    Step 2: Relate scl in a free product to scl in the factors.
    The stable commutator length of an element g1*h2 in a free product G1 * G2 is given by
    scl(g1*h2) = max(scl_G1(g1), scl_G2(h2)).

    Step 3: Evaluate scl for the group G.
    A key result in the theory of piecewise-linear groups is that for the group G = PL_2(S^1), the
    stable commutator length is identically zero for all elements. scl_G(f) = 0 for all f in G.
    This is because the bounded Euler class, which determines scl, vanishes for this group.

    Step 4: Address the given translation numbers.
    The problem states that g1 corresponds to translation by 2/27 and h2 to translation by 16/27.
    The translation numbers for any element in G must be dyadic rationals (m/2^n), but 2/27 and 16/27 are not.
    This contradiction implies that the numbers are a distraction. Regardless of which elements g1 and h2
    are chosen from G, their scl must be 0.

    Step 5: Compute the final result.
    Based on the above, scl_G1(g1) = 0 and scl_G2(h2) = 0.
