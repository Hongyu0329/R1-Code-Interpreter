    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the connectivity of the map.\n\nLet the map be $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. We want to find the connectivity of $f$. The connectivity of a map $f: A \\to B$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups, $\\pi_i(f): \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$, is an isomorphism for $i < k$ and an epimorphism for $i=k$. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of $f$ being $(k-1)$-connected.\n\nWe will calculate the connectivity by examining the induced maps on homotopy groups step by step, starting from the lowest dimension.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map\n    f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    \"\"\"\n    m = 4\n    n = 6\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the connectivity of the source and target spaces.\")\n    # Connectivity of Omega S^k is k-2.\n    conn_omega_sm = m - 2\n    conn_omega_sn = n - 2\n    print(f\"The space Omega S^{m} is {m-2}-connected.\")\n    print(f\"The space Omega S^{n} is {n-2}-connected.\")\n\n    # Connectivity of a smash product X wedge Y is conn(X) + conn(Y) + 1.\n    conn_wedge = conn_omega_sm + conn_omega_sn + 1\n    print(f\"The space Omega S^{m} wedge Omega S^{n} is {conn_omega_sm} + {conn_omega_sn} + 1 = {conn_wedge}-connected.\")\n\n    # Connectivity of a suspension Sigma X is conn(X) + 1.\n    source_conn = conn_wedge + 1\n    print(f\"The source space Sigma(Omega S^{m} wedge Omega S^{n}) is {conn_wedge} + 1 = {source_conn}-connected.\")\n\n    # Target space\n    # S^m wedge S^n is homeomorphic to S^(m+n).\n    target_base_conn = m + n - 1\n    # Connectivity of Omega X is conn(X) - 1.\n    target_conn = target_base_conn - 1\n    print(f\"The target space Omega(S^{m} wedge S^{n}) = Omega S^{m+n} is {m+n-1} - 1 = {target_conn}-connected.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nBoth source and target spaces are 8-connected.
