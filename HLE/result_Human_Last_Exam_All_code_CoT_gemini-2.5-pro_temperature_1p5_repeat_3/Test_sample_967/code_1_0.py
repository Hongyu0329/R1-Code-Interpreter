# Step 1: Define the properties of the Petersen graph (P).
# It is a well-known graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges.
# It is also a 3-regular graph, meaning every vertex has a degree of 3.
num_vertices_P = 10
num_edges_P = 15
degree_P = 3

# Step 2: Determine the properties of the line graph of the Petersen graph, L(P).
# The vertices of L(P) correspond to the edges of P.
num_vertices_LP = num_edges_P

# The edges of L(P) correspond to pairs of adjacent edges in P.
# For a k-regular graph with V vertices, the number of edges in its line graph is V * kC2.
# We use math.comb(n, k) for "n choose k".
num_edges_LP = num_vertices_P * math.comb(degree_P, 2)

# Step 3: Calculate the first Betti number of L(P).
# The first Betti number (or cyclomatic number) for a connected graph is given by b1 = |E| - |V| + 1.
# The Petersen graph is connected, so its line graph is also connected.
# As established in the plan, the first l2-betti number of the group G is equal to the first Betti number of L(P).
betti_1_LP = num_edges_LP - num_vertices_LP + 1

# Step 4: Print the final calculation and the result.
# The explanation established that the desired l2-Betti number is b1(L(P)).
print(f"The first l2-Betti number of G simplifies to the first Betti number of the underlying graph, which is the line graph of the Petersen graph, L(P).")
print(f"The number of vertices in L(P) is the number of edges in the Petersen graph: {num_vertices_LP}")
print(f"The number of edges in L(P) is calculated based on the 10 3-regular vertices of the Petersen graph: {num_vertices_P} * (3 choose 2) = {num_edges_LP}")
print(f"The first Betti number is |E| - |V| + 1.")
print(f"The final result is: {num_edges_LP} - {num_vertices_LP} + 1 = {betti_1_LP}")
