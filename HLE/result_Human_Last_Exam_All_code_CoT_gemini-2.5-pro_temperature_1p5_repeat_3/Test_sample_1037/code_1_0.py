# The solution to this problem is derived from the definitions in category theory and group theory.
# The code below prints the result of this mathematical derivation.
#
# Step 1: Identify the objects A, B, and S.
# - The initial object A is the scale defined by the identity map on the integers, (Z, id).
#   Its associated group is G_A = Z.
# - The terminal object B must allow a unique map from any other scale. This is only possible
#   if the group is the trivial group {0}. Thus, B corresponds to the scale ({0}, 0).
#   Its associated group is G_B = {0}.
# - The scale S is given as the inclusion of Z into the hyperreals, *R.
#   Its associated group is G_S = *R.
#
# Step 2: Determine the quotients.
# - The canonical map from A to S, h_AS: Z -> *R, is the inclusion map.
#   The quotient S/A is therefore *R / Z.
# - The canonical map from S to B, h_SB: *R -> {0}, is the zero map.
#   The quotient B/S is {0} / im(h_SB) = {0} / {0}, which is the trivial group {0}.
# - The canonical map from A to B, h_AB: Z -> {0}, is the zero map.
#   The space B/A is {0} / im(h_AB) = {0} / {0}, which is the trivial space (a single point).
#
# Step 3: Compute the required cardinalities.
# - Cardinality of S/A:
#   The cardinality of the hyperreals *R is 2^aleph_0, which is the continuum c.
#   In Beth notation, this is Beth_1.
#   The cardinality of the quotient group |*R / Z| is the same as |*R|, since Z is countable.
#   So, |S/A| = Beth_1.
# - Cardinality of B/S:
#   The quotient B/S is the trivial group {0}. Its cardinality is 1.
# - Cardinality of H_1(B/A, Q):
#   The space B/A is a single point. The first homology group of a point is the trivial group, 0.
#   H_1({point}, Q) = 0.
#   The cardinality of this group is 1.

# Final answers in Beth notation
card_S_A = "Beth_1"
card_B_S = "1"
card_H1_B_A = "1"

# The final answer is the sequence of these three cardinalities.
