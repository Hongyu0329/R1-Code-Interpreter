# Step 1: Define the variables X and Y based on the information about Minsk.
# X is the building number of the former "BelExpo" exhibition hall on Yanki Kupaly st.
x = 27

# Y is the number of the iconic tram route that no longer passes through Kastryƒçnickaja st.
# Tram route No. 1 is one of the oldest and most significant routes in Minsk.
y = 1

# Step 2: Calculate X to the power of Y.
result = x ** y

# Step 3: Print the final equation, including the values of X, Y, and the result.
print(f"{x}^{y} = {result}")
