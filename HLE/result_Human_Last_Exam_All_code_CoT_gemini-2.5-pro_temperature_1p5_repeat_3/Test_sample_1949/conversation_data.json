    "Of course. Here is a Python script that identifies the longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid, sorts them by length, and prints the top three.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will compile a list of rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid. This includes major world rivers depicted on Aeneas's shield (Nile, Euphrates, Ganges, Indus), important European rivers (Danube, Rhine, Po, Tiber), and Trojan rivers (Xanthus).\n2.  Next, I will find the approximate modern-day length of each of these rivers in kilometers.\n3.  I will store this data in a Python list of tuples, where each tuple contains the river's name and its length.\n4.  The script will then sort this list in descending order based on river length.\n5.  Finally, it will print the names and lengths of the top three longest rivers.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_aeneid_rivers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid,\n    sorts them by length, and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A list of tuples containing rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their approx. lengths (km).\n    # Sources include descriptions of Aeneas's shield and other geographical references.\n    rivers = [\n        (\"Tiber\", 406),\n        (\"Po\", 652),\n        (\"Nile\", 6650),\n        (\"Euphrates\", 2800),\n        (\"Rhine\", 1233),\n        (\"Danube\", 2850),\n        (\"Xanthus\", 100),\n        (\"Ganges\", 2525),\n        (\"Indus\", 3180),\n        (\"Araxes\", 1072)\n    ]\n\n    # Sort the list of rivers by length in descending order.\n    # The lambda function specifies that the sorting key is the second element (index 1) of each tuple.\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers, key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Select the top three longest rivers from the sorted list.\n    top_three = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    \n    # Print each of the top three rivers with its rank, name, and length.\n    # This loop outputs each number in the final result.\n    for i, river in enumerate(top_three):\n        name = river[0]\n        length = river[1]\n        # The rank is the loop index (i) + 1.\n        # The name is the first element of the tuple.\n        # The length is the second element of the tuple.\n        print(f\"Rank {i + 1}: The {name} river is {length} km long.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_longest_aeneid_rivers()\n```\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Nile (6650 km), the Indus (3180 km), and the Danube (2850 km).>>>"
