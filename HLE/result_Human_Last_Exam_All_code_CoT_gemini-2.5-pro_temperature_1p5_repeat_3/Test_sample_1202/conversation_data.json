    "Of course. Here is my analysis of the question and a Python script to explain the reasoning behind the answer.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Analyze the User's Goal:** The user wants to find the correct answer to a multiple-choice question about gene duplication and wants the answer presented via a Python script that explains the logic.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Biological Question:** The core of the question is to identify the primary mechanism that allows duplicated genes to be kept by the organism (\"retention\") and to evolve different sequences or functions (\"divergence\").\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This process makes gene copies more similar, which is the opposite of divergence. This is incorrect.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where a gene copy becomes non-functional. While it's a form of divergence, it's a loss, not a retention of a functional duplicated gene pair. This is a common fate, but not the mechanism for *retention* of function.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macro-evolutionary concept describing the diversification of species, not a molecular mechanism at the gene level. This is the wrong scale.\n    *   This leaves two main candidates: **C. Neofunctionalization** and **D. Subfunctionalization**.\n\n4.  **Compare the Strong Candidates (C and D):**\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** One gene copy keeps the original function, while the second copy evolves an entirely new function. This perfectly explains retention (both are now useful in different ways) and divergence (the new function requires a different sequence).\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** The ancestral gene had multiple functions (e.g., expressed in different tissues or at different times). After duplication, each copy loses some functions and specializes in a subset of the original tasks. Now, both copies are required to perform the original, complete set of functions. This also explains retention (both are needed) and divergence (they specialize and their sequences change accordingly).\n\n5.  **Select the \"Most Likely\" Mechanism:** The key phrase is \"most likely\". After a gene duplication, one copy is initially redundant and can be lost through mutation (pseudogenization) without any negative effect.\n    *   For neofunctionalization to occur, a new, beneficial function must evolve in the redundant copy *before* it's lost. This can be a rare event.\n    *   Subfunctionalization provides a more passive and potentially faster route to retention. If both copies quickly accumulate minor degenerative mutations that knock out *different* subfunctions, they both become indispensable. This protects the pair from being lost.\n    *   Because subfunctionalization provides a powerful mechanism to preserve the duplicate genes from loss in the first place, it is considered by many to be a very common, and thus \"most likely,\" mechanism for the initial retention that allows for subsequent divergence.\n\n6.  **Construct the Python Script:** Based on this reasoning, I will write a Python script that defines each term, filters out the incorrect options, compares the two strong candidates, and explains why Subfunctionalization is arguably the \"most likely\" answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes mechanisms of duplicate gene retention and divergence to find the best answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    mechanisms = {\n        'A': {\n            \"name\": \"Gene conversion\",\n            \"description\": \"A process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, leading to sequence homogenization.
