    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to consider all possible ways to construct such a group. Any finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, and the rank of the product is the sum of the ranks of its components.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  First, we identify the number of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for each rank from 1 to 4. We must account for known isomorphisms between families, such as W(Bₙ) ≈ W(Cₙ).\n    *   **Rank 1:** A₁ (1 type)\n    *   **Rank 2:** A₂, B₂, G₂ (3 types)\n    *   **Rank 3:** A₃, B₃ (2 types)\n    *   **Rank 4:** A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄ (4 types)\n2.  Next, we find all integer partitions of the number 4. These partitions represent the ranks of the irreducible components that form a rank 4 group. The partitions are:\n    *   4\n    *   3 + 1\n    *   2 + 2\n    *   2 + 1 + 1\n    *   1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n3.  For each partition, we calculate how many distinct groups can be formed. This involves combinatorial calculations based on the number of available types for each rank.\n4.  Finally, we sum the counts from all partitions to get the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan and prints the detailed calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_weyl_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n    The method is to find all partitions of the integer 4, and for each partition,\n    calculate the number of ways to form a product of irreducible Weyl groups\n    corresponding to that partition.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the number of irreducible Weyl group types for each rank (1 to 4).\")\n    print(\"A Weyl group is 'irreducible' if its corresponding root system is not a direct sum of smaller ones.\")\n    print(\"Known isomorphisms like W(B_n) ~ W(C_n) and W(D_3) ~ W(A_3) are accounted for.\")\n    \n    # Number of distinct non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for a given rank\n    num_irreducible_types = {\n        1: 1,  # A1\n        2: 3,  # A2, B2, G2\n        3: 2,  # A3, B3\n        4: 4   # A4, B4, D4, F4\n    }\n\n    print(\"Number of irreducible types for rank 1: 1 (A1)\")\n    print(\"Number of irreducible types for rank 2: 3 (A2, B2, G2)\")\n    print(\"Number of irreducible types for rank 3: 2 (A3, B3)\")\n    print(\"Number of irreducible types for rank 4: 4 (A4, B4, D4, F4)\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Enumerate all integer partitions of 4.
