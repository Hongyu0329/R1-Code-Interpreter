    explanation = """
The provided text is a metaphorical representation of a computer program, styled after the "Chef" programming language. The core of the problem lies in the concept of recursion.

1. The "Caramel Sauce" recipe is described as being used recursively. A recursive function is one that calls itself to solve a smaller part of the problem.

2. In the "Method" for the "Caramel Sauce" recipe, the line "Serve with caramel sauce." acts as a command for the recipe to call itself.

3. The critical error is that the "Caramel Sauce" recipe has no "base case" â€” a condition to stop calling itself. It simply calls itself unconditionally. This creates an infinite loop, or "infinite recursion," which would crash a real program.

4. To fix this logical flaw, the line that causes the recipe to call itself must be removed from its own definition.

5. Therefore, removing "Serve with caramel sauce." from the "Caramel Sauce" recipe is the correct solution to prevent the infinite loop. This corresponds to choice F.
