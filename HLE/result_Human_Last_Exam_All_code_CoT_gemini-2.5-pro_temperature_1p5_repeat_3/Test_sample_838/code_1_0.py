    # Step 1: E2 Elimination
    print("Reaction 1: Starting material to Product A")
    print("Starting Material: [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene, which corresponds to the structure (S)-3-bromo-1-phenylbutane.")
    print("Reaction: The starting material is reacted with potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically bulky base.")
    print("Mechanism: This is an E2 elimination reaction. Due to the bulkiness of the t-BuOK base, it preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered terminal carbon (Hofmann elimination), rather than the more substituted internal carbon (Zaitsev elimination).")
    print("Product A: The resulting product is the less substituted alkene, 4-phenylbut-1-ene. The original stereocenter is lost in this step.")
    print("Conclusion for Step 1: Product A is 4-phenylbut-1-ene (achiral).\n")

    # Step 2: Hydroboration-Oxidation
    print("Reaction 2: Product A to Product B")
    print("Reaction: Product A (4-phenylbut-1-ene) is treated with borane (BH3) followed by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).")
    print("Mechanism: This is a hydroboration-oxidation reaction, which adds a hydroxyl group (-OH) to the alkene with anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity. This means the -OH group adds to the less substituted carbon of the double bond.")
    print("Product B: The hydroxyl group adds to the terminal carbon of the double bond.")
    print("Conclusion for Step 2: Product B is 4-phenylbutan-1-ol (achiral).\n")

    # Step 3: Bromination of Alcohol
    print("Reaction 3: Product B to Product C")
    print("Reaction: Product B (4-phenylbutan-1-ol) is treated with phosphorous tribromide (PBr3).")
    print("Mechanism: PBr3 is a reagent that effectively converts a primary alcohol into a primary alkyl bromide via a substitution reaction (SN2-like).")
    print("Product C: The hydroxyl group of 4-phenylbutan-1-ol is replaced by a bromine atom.\n")

    # Final Product Analysis

    print("Final Product C: Identity and Chirality")
    print("IUPAC Name of C: 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane")
    print("\nChirality Explanation:")
    print("The final product, 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, is an achiral molecule. A molecule is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image. This is the case because it does not contain any stereocenters (chiral centers). A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.")
    print("In 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, no carbon atom meets this requirement, as each carbon in the alkane chain is bonded to at least two identical hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.")
