    "To solve this problem, we need to use the topological relations that govern Feynman diagrams. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the key components and relationships:**\n    *   **V:** The number of vertices.\n    *   **I:** The number of internal propagators (lines).\n    *   **L:** The number of loops.\n    *   **n:** The number of lines meeting at each vertex. For an interacting scalar field theory, a $\\phi^n$ interaction means each vertex has `n` lines. The most common case is $\\phi^4$ (`n=4`), but $\\phi^3$ (`n=3`) is also possible.\n    *   We are looking for a vacuum diagram (no external lines).\n\n2.  **Formulate the equations:**\n    *   The number of loops is given by the graph theory formula: `L = I - V + 1`.\n    *   For a vacuum diagram, every line is internal and connects two vertices. By counting the line \"ends\", we get the relation `2 * I = n * V`.\n\n3.  **Solve for V:**\n    *   We can express `I` in terms of `V` and `n`: `I = (n * V) / 2`.\n    *   Substitute this into the loop formula: `L = ((n * V) / 2) - V + 1`.\n    *   Now, we can solve this equation for `V` in terms of `L` and `n`.\n    *   `L - 1 = V * (n/2 - 1)`\n    *   `V = (L - 1) / (n/2 - 1) = 2 * (L - 1) / (n - 2)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the minimum V:**\n    *   We are given `L = 2`. The formula becomes `V = 2 * (2 - 1) / (n - 2) = 2 / (n - 2)`.\n    *   We need to find the integer `n >= 3` that gives the smallest possible integer `V`.\n    *   Let's test common interaction types:\n        *   For a $\\phi^4$ theory, `n=4`. `V = 2 / (4 - 2) = 2 / 2 = 1`. This is a valid integer.\n        *   For a $\\phi^3$ theory, `n=3`. `V = 2 / (3 - 2) = 2 / 1 = 2`. This is also a valid integer.\n    *   Comparing the results, the minimum number of vertices is 1, which is achieved in a $\\phi^4$ theory.\n\nThe Python code below will perform this calculation and print out the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef find_min_vertices_feynman():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    for a standard interacting scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    loops = 2\n\n    print(\"To find the minimum number of vertices (V) for a two-loop (L=2) Feynman diagram,\")\n    print(\"we use two fundamental topological formulas for vacuum diagrams:\")\n    print(\"1.
