    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$, we'll follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Find the Continued Fraction of the Rational Number:**\n    First, we determine the continued fraction of the rational number $r = 4/7$. Since $0 < 4/7 < 1$, its continued fraction will be of the form $[0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Associated Lagrange Number:**\n    For a rational number $r = [0; a_1, \\dots, a_n]$, there's an associated Lagrange number, denoted here as $k_r$, which is crucial for finding the Markov number. It is calculated using the formula:\n    $k_r = [a_n; a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_1] + [0; a_1, \\dots, a_n]$\n\n3.  **Compute the Generalized Markov Number:**\n    The generalized Markov number $m_r$ is derived from $k_r$ using the following relation from the theory of the Markov spectrum:\n    $m_r = \\sqrt{9 - \\frac{4}{k_r^2}}$\n    The result, $m_r$, will be a quadratic irrational number (a number of the form $\\frac{A + \\sqrt{B}}{C}$).\n\n4.  **Compute the Continued Fraction of the Markov Number:**\n    Finally, we will compute the continued fraction of the resulting quadratic irrational number $m_r$. This requires a standard algorithm for expanding quadratic irrationals, which works with arbitrary precision to avoid floating-point errors. The continued fraction for a quadratic irrational is always periodic.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to execute these steps and print the final continued fraction.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom decimal import Decimal, getcontext\n\n# Set precision for decimal calculations to ensure accuracy\ngetcontext().prec = 50\n\ndef compute_generalized_markov_cf(p_r, q_r, num_terms=11):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number m_{p/q}.\n\n    This function follows these steps:\n    1.  Computes the continued fraction of the rational number r = p/q, which will be of the form [0; a_1, ..., a_n].\n    2.  Calculates the associated Lagrange number k_r using the formula:\n        k_r = [a_n; a_{n-1}, ..., a_1] + r\n    3.  Computes the generalized Markov number m_r using the formula:\n        m_r = sqrt(9 - 4/k_r^2)\n    4.  The value m_r is a quadratic irrational. The function then computes the\n        first `num_terms` of its continued fraction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Compute continued fraction of r = p/q\n    def get_cf_coeffs(p, q):\n        coeffs = []\n        if q == 0: return []\n        while q != 0:\n            coeffs.append(p // q)\n            p, q = q, p % q\n        return coeffs\n\n    # For a rational p/q where 0 < p/q < 1, the first coefficient is 0.\n    # The formula for k_r uses the coefficients after the semicolon.\n    cf_r_coeffs = get_cf_coeffs(p_r, q_r)[1:]\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate k_r\n    beta_p, beta_q = p_r, q_r  # beta is r itself\n\n    # alpha is the value of the reversed continued fraction [a_n; a_{n-1}, ..., a_1]\n    rev_cf_coeffs = list(reversed(cf_r_coeffs))\n    \n    # Calculate the value of alpha\n    c0 = rev_cf_coeffs[0]\n    tail_coeffs = rev_cf_coeffs[1:]\n    \n    # Calculate value of continued fraction from the tail\n    p_num, p_den = 1, 0 \n    if tail_coeffs:\n        p_num = tail_coeffs[-1]\n        p_den = 1\n        for i in range(len(tail_coeffs) - 2, -1, -1):\n            p_num, p_den = tail_coeffs[i] * p_num + p_den, p_num\n\n    if not tail_coeffs: # if alpha is an integer\n        alpha_p, alpha_q = c0, 1\n    else: # c0 + 1/value = c0 + p_den/p_num\n        alpha_p = c0 * p_num + p_den\n        alpha_q = p_num\n\n    # k = alpha + beta\n    k_p = alpha_p * beta_q + beta_p * alpha_q\n    k_q = alpha_q * beta_q\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate m_r = sqrt(9 - 4/k_r^2)\n    # m_r^2 = (9 * k_p^2 - 4 * k_q^2) / k_p^2\n    D_num = 9 * k_p**2 - 4 * k_q**2\n    m_den = k_p\n    \n    # Simplify the radical part sqrt(D_num) by factoring out perfect squares\n    D = D_num\n    m_num_factor = 1\n    i = 2\n    while i * i <= D:\n        if D % (i * i) == 0:\n            D //= (i * i)\n            m_num_factor *= i\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    \n    # m_r is now represented as (A*sqrt(D)+B)/C\n    A = m_num_factor\n    B = 0\n    C = m_den\n    \n    # Simplify the fraction by dividing A, B, C by their GCD\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(A, C)\n    A //= common_divisor\n    C //= common_divisor\n    \n    # Step 4: Compute the continued fraction of m_r\n    cf_m_coeffs = []\n    dec_D = Decimal(D).sqrt()\n    \n    for _ in range(num_terms):\n        dec_val = (Decimal(A) * dec_D + Decimal(B)) / Decimal(C)\n        c_i = int(dec_val.to_integral_value(rounding='ROUND_FLOOR'))\n        cf_m_coeffs.append(c_i)\n        \n        # Prepare for the next iteration using integer arithmetic\n        # x_i - c_i\n        B = B - c_i * C\n        # 1 / (x_i - c_i)\n        A_next = C * A\n        B_next = -C * B\n        C_next = A**2 * D - B**2\n        \n        if C_next == 0: break\n            \n        common = math.gcd(math.gcd(A_next, B_next), C_next)\n        A = A_next // common\n        B = B_next // common\n        C = C_next // common\n\n    # Format the final output string\n    result_str = f\"m_{p_r}/{q_r} = [{cf_m_coeffs[0]};\"\n    for i in range(1, len(cf_m_coeffs)):\n        result_str += f\" {cf_m_coeffs[i]},\"\n    result_str = result_str.rstrip(',') + \" ...]\"\n    \n    print(result_str)\n\n# Run the computation for m_{4/7}\ncompute_generalized_markov_cf(4, 7, num_terms=11)\n>>>m_4/7 = [2; 1, 23, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 23, ...]"
