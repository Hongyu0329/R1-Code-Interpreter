    Calculates and explains the number of power subgroups in the
    generalized quaternion group of size 128 (Q_128).

    This function follows these steps:
    1. Identifies the group parameter 'n' for Q_128 from its size.
    2. Determines the number of distinct power subgroups for each class of exponent 'm':
        - m is odd
        - m is congruent to 2 (mod 4)
        - m is a multiple of 4
    3. Sums these counts to get the total number of power subgroups and prints the final equation.
