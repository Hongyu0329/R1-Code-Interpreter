# Plan:
# 1. Identify the composer, work, and specific musical joke from the description.
#    The work is Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1, Op. 15, third movement (Rondo).
# 2. Determine the exact measures for the event.
#    - The cellos and basses start the theme in m. 369.
#    - They get humorously "stuck" and go off-beat.
#    - They "recover" by becoming silent in m. 375.
# 3. Assign the identified information to variables.
# 4. Print the final formatted string as requested.

composer_surname = "Beethoven"
opus_number = 15
start_measure = 369
end_measure = 375

# Combine the elements into the final string format.
# The 'equation' here is the construction of the final answer string from its components.
final_answer = f"{composer_surname}, {opus_number}, {start_measure}-{end_measure}"

print(final_answer)
