    print("Result of Part 1 Analysis: The statement 'The proteins coded by genes targeted by sgRNA7 and sgRNA3 do not play a role in activating qNCS' is well-supported by the data.\n")

    print(f"  - Conclusion: Since {old_control_glucose_starvation}% is greater than {old_control_normal_glucose}%, this shows that a low-calorie condition (glucose starvation) increases qNCS activation in aged mice.\n")
