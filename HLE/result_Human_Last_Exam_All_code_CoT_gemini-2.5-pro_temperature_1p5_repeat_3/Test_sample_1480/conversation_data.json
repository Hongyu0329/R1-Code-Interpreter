    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, we need to combine the firing level of the rule's antecedent part (Phi_k(x′)) and the firing level of the consequent part (μG_k_j(y_j)) using a t-norm operation. A t-norm is a function that models the logical 'AND' operation in fuzzy logic.\n\nSince the specific t-norm is not mentioned, I will use the most common one, the **minimum t-norm**.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Define the given values: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  The rule activation level is the t-norm of these two values.\n3.  Using the minimum t-norm, the calculation is: `Rule Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)`.\n4.  The python code will perform this calculation and print the resulting equation and the final value.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values for the firing levels\nphi_k_x_prime = 0.7\nmu_G_k_j_y_j = 0.9\n\n# A t-norm operation is used to calculate the rule activation level.\n# The most common t-norm is the minimum operator.\n# Rule Activation Level = t_norm(phi_k_x_prime, mu_G_k_j_y_j)\nrule_activation_level = np.minimum(phi_k_x_prime, mu_G_k_j_y_j)\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(f\"The rule activation level is calculated as the minimum (t-norm) of Phi_k(x') and μG_k_j(y_j).\")\nprint(f\"Rule Activation Level = min({phi_k_x_prime}, {mu_G_k_j_y_j})\")\nprint(f\"Rule Activation Level = {rule_activation_level}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
