    "To find the number of MLB Triple Crown winners, I will perform the following steps:\n1.  I will create a list of all the players who have won the Triple Crown in the American League (AL).\n2.  I will create a second list of all the players who have won the Triple Crown in the National League (NL), including in early major leagues whose records are officially recognized by MLB.\n3.  I will then calculate the number of winners in each league by getting the length of each list.\n4.  Finally, I will add these two numbers together to get the total number of Triple Crown winning seasons in MLB history and print the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef count_triple_crown_winners():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the number of MLB Triple Crown winners.\n    The Triple Crown is awarded to a batter who leads their league in\n    batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI) in the same season.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data for Triple Crown winners in the American League\n    al_winners = [\n        {\"player\": \"Nap Lajoie\", \"year\": 1901},\n        {\"player\": \"Ty Cobb\", \"year\": 1909},\n        {\"player\": \"Jimmie Foxx\", \"year\": 1933},\n        {\"player\": \"Lou Gehrig\", \"year\": 1934},\n        {\"player\": \"Ted Williams\", \"year\": 1942},\n        {\"player\": \"Ted Williams\", \"year\": 1947},\n        {\"player\": \"Mickey Mantle\", \"year\": 1956},\n        {\"player\": \"Frank Robinson\", \"year\": 1966},\n        {\"player\": \"Carl Yastrzemski\", \"year\": 1967},\n        {\"player\": \"Miguel Cabrera\", \"year\": 2012},\n    ]\n\n    # Data for Triple Crown winners in the National League (and predecessor leagues)\n    nl_winners = [\n        {\"player\": \"Paul Hines\", \"year\": 1878},\n        {\"player\": \"Tip O'Neill\", \"year\": 1887},\n        {\"player\": \"Hugh Duffy\", \"year\": 1894},\n        {\"player\": \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"year\": 1922},\n        {\"player\": \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"year\": 1925},\n        {\"player\": \"Chuck Klein\", \"year\": 1933},\n        {\"player\": \"Joe Medwick\", \"year\": 1937},\n    ]\n\n    num_al_winners = len(al_winners)\n    num_nl_winners = len(nl_winners)\n    total_winners = num_al_winners + num_nl_winners\n\n    print(f\"There have been {num_al_winners} Triple Crown winning seasons in the American League.\")\n    print(f\"There have been {num_nl_winners} Triple Crown winning seasons in the National League.\")\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total number of Triple Crown winners, we add the winners from both leagues:\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {num_al_winners} + {num_nl_winners} = {total_winners}\")\n\ncount_triple_crown_winners()\n```\n<<<17>>>"
