# This script explains the reasoning to determine the climatic conditions
# that lead to low levels of the 18O isotope in lake sulfate deposits.

# The core principle is that the 18O/16O ratio in sulfates reflects the ratio in the lake water they formed in.
# The primary process controlling this ratio in lake water is evaporation.

print("Step 1: Understand the effect of evaporation on oxygen isotopes (18O vs 16O).")
print("--> Evaporation removes the lighter 16O isotope more easily than the heavier 18O isotope.")
print("--> This leaves the remaining lake water 'enriched' with high levels of 18O.")
print("--> Therefore, to find conditions for LOW 18O, we must find conditions that MINIMIZE evaporation and its effects.")
