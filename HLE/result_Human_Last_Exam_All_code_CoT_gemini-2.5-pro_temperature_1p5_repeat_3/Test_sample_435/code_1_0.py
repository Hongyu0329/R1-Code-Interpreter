    prediction_explanation = """
Based on the evidence about its role in supporting T cell function, one would predict that manufacturing CAR T cells with interleukin-15 (IL-15) would lead to an enhanced and more sustained release of key effector cytokines (like IFN-γ and TNF-α) upon stimulation with their target antigen, compared to T cells manufactured without IL-15.

The reasoning for this prediction is as follows:

1.  Promotion of a Memory Phenotype: IL-15 is critical for the survival and proliferation of memory T cells. When used in the manufacturing process, it encourages the CAR T cells to develop into a less-differentiated, memory-like state (e.g., stem cell memory or central memory T cells).

2.  Increased In Vivo Persistence and Proliferation: These memory-like CAR T cells are more persistent after being infused into the patient. When they encounter cancer cells, they can undergo more robust expansion, creating a larger and longer-lasting population of effector CAR T cells.

3.  Potent and Sustained Effector Function: A larger and more persistent army of CAR T cells can mount a more powerful attack on the tumor. A crucial part of this attack is the release of cytokines. Therefore, the overall cumulative cytokine release from the IL-15-supported CAR T cell population would be greater and more sustained over time, contributing to a more effective anti-tumor response.
