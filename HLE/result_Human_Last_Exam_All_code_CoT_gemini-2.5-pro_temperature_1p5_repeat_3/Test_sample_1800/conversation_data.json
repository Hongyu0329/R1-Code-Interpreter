    "The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria catalysts is not a single, universally fixed value. It is highly dependent on the catalyst synthesis method, the specific reaction (e.g., Water Gas Shift vs. water splitting), and the reaction conditions (temperature, pressure). The primary goal is to achieve high dispersion of Ni atoms on the ceria support and maximize the strong metal-support interaction, which creates active sites at the Ni-Ceria interface.\n\nGenerally, scientific literature suggests that a relatively low to moderate Ni loading is optimal. High nickel concentrations can lead to the formation of large nickel oxide (NiO) clusters, which reduces the number of active sites and lowers catalytic efficiency. An optimal composition balances having enough Ni active sites with maintaining this high dispersion.\n\nMany studies report excellent performance with a nickel atomic percentage (at%) in the range of 10-20%. A representative value from this optimal range is 15 at% Ni. This means that for every 100 total metal atoms (Ni + Ce), 15 are Nickel and 85 are Cerium.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the simple Ni/Ce atomic ratio based on this representative optimal composition of 15 at% Ni.\n\n```python\n# Define the composition based on a representative optimal value of 15 atomic percent (at%) Nickel.\n# This means for every 100 total metal atoms, 15 are Ni and 85 are Ce.\nni_atoms = 15\nce_atoms = 85\ntotal_atoms = ni_atoms + ce_atoms\n\n# Calculate the simple atomic ratio of Ni to Ce\nni_ce_ratio = ni_atoms / ce_atoms\n\n# Calculate the atomic ratio of Ni to the total metal content (Ni+Ce)\n# This is another common way to express the ratio and corresponds to the atomic percent.\nni_total_ratio = ni_atoms / total_atoms\n\nprint(\"This script calculates the Ni/Ce ratio based on a representative optimal composition.\")\nprint(\"A common optimal composition is around 15 atomic percent (at%) Ni.\\n\")\nprint(\"For this composition, out of 100 total metal atoms:\")\n# The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"Number of Ni atoms = {ni_atoms}\")\nprint(f\"Number of Ce atoms = {ce_atoms}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"The corresponding simple atomic ratio (Ni/Ce) is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"{ni_atoms} / {ce_atoms} = {ni_ce_ratio:.4f}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"The atomic ratio of Ni to total metal content (Ni/(Ni+Ce)) is:\")\nprint(f\"{ni_atoms} / ({ni_atoms} + {ce_atoms}) = {ni_total_ratio:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nThis Ni/(Ni+Ce) ratio of 0.15 is often cited as being near the ideal value for maximizing catalytic performance.\")\n\n```\n<<<0.15>>>"
