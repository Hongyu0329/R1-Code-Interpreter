# Step 1: Define the problem parameters
# The foldamer is an alternating copolymer of Alanine and a cyclically-strained epsilon-amino acid.
# Ala backbone atom count (from N to C'): 3 (N, C-alpha, C')
# Epsilon-amino acid backbone atom count (from N to C'): 7 (N, C-epsilon, C-delta, C-gamma, C-beta, C-alpha, C')

# Step 2: Determine the most likely hydrogen bonding pattern and calculate 'm'
# The cyclically-strained epsilon-amino acid is designed to promote a specific turn.
# This strongly suggests an 'i -> i+2' hydrogen bond enclosing the strained monomer.
# Let's say residue 'i' is Ala, 'i+1' is the epsilon-amino acid (eAA), and 'i+2' is Ala.
# The H-bond is C=O(i) ... H-N(i+2).

# To calculate 'm' (the number of atoms in the H-bonded ring), we list and count them.
# The ring consists of the H-bond donor (N-H), the acceptor (C=O), and the covalent backbone path connecting them.
# The path runs through the entire backbone of the intervening epsilon-amino acid at position i+1.
ring_atoms = [
    "H (from N-H group of Ala at residue i+2)",  # Atom 1
    "N (from N-H group of Ala at residue i+2)",  # Atom 2
    "C' (carbonyl carbon of eAA at residue i+1)",  # Atom 3
    "C-alpha (of eAA at residue i+1)",            # Atom 4
    "C-beta (of eAA at residue i+1)",             # Atom 5
    "C-gamma (of eAA at residue i+1)",            # Atom 6
    "C-delta (of eAA at residue i+1)",            # Atom 7
    "C-epsilon (of eAA at residue i+1)",          # Atom 8
    "N (amide nitrogen of eAA at residue i+1)",   # Atom 9
    "C' (carbonyl carbon of Ala at residue i)",   # Atom 10
    "O (carbonyl oxygen of Ala at residue i)"     # Atom 11
]

m = len(ring_atoms)

# Step 3: Determine 'n' based on the choices and literature precedence.
# The calculated value for m is 11. This narrows the options to A (11/9) and C (11/13).
# A related alpha/beta-peptide system with an m=11 H-bond ring is known to form an "11/9-helix".
# This provides a strong precedent for choosing n=9.
n = 9

# Step 4: Print the final result, showing the calculation for m.
