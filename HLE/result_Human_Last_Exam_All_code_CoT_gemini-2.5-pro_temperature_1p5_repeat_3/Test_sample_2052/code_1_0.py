def solve_matrix_model_theory_questions():
  """
  This function provides the answers to the theoretical questions about the
  two-matrix model, superintegrability, and W-algebra operators.

  The reasoning is as follows:
  (a) Superintegrability: The property of superintegrability for matrix models holds
      for any polynomial potential. The term Tr(Φ₂ⁿ)/n in the exponential defines a
      polynomial potential for any integer n. Thus, for n=3, the model is
      superintegrable.

  (b) Necessity of W-hat_{-4}: The operator W-hat_{-n} corresponds to adding a
      Tr(Φⁿ) term to the potential. The terms Tr(Φ²), Tr(Φ³), Tr(Φ⁴), etc.,
      represent algebraically independent deformations of the model. Therefore,
      the operator W-hat_{-4} is a new, fundamental generator that cannot be
      constructed from lower-order operators (like W-hat_{-2} or W-hat_{-3}).
      It is necessary to generate the Z_{-4} state.
