    Solves the problem based on a known theorem in continuum theory.

    The problem asks for the number of homeomorphism classes of a compact,
    connected metric space X for which the configuration space of n distinct
    points is disconnected for some n >= 2.

    A theorem in topology states that this condition holds if and only if
    X is homeomorphic to the closed interval [0, 1].

    Therefore, all such spaces X belong to a single homeomorphism class.
