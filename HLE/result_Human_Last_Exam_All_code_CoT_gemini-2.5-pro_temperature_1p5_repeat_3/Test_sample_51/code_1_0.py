The combination is fatal: With the impredicative universe `Prop` (from axiom C) and the ability to perform case analysis on its elements, one can construct a paradoxical proposition similar to the one in Girard's paradox. The non-standard subterm rule ensures this paradoxical construction breaks the well-foundedness needed for structural recursion, leading to logical inconsistency.\n\n"
