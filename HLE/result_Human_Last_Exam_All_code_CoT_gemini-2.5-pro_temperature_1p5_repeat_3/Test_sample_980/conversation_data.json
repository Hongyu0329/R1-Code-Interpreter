    "This is a tricky puzzle! At first glance, it looks like a standard numerical sequence where we need to find the mathematical pattern. However, if we assume the rule is that the next number is a function of the previous one, `f(n_i) = n_{i+1}`, we run into contradictions. For example, the sequence starts with `111, 142`, implying `f(111) = 142`. But later, we have `111, 41`, which would imply `f(111) = 41`. Since a function can't give two different outputs for the same input, this simple approach is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests the sequence itself might be a red herring, designed to distract from the real puzzle. The key to solving this lies in the instructions given in the prompt itself, particularly: \"Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\".\n\nThis is a strong hint that the operation to find the \"next number\" involves an equation built from the number's digits. A very common operation in such puzzles is the \"sum of the squares of the digits\". Let's see if this fits the hint. For a number like 124, the equation would be `1^2 + 2^2 + 4^2 = 21`. This expression is an equation and clearly shows each of the input numbers (the digits 1, 2, and 4).\n\nSo, the plan is to ignore the baffling sequence and instead apply this \"sum of the squares of the digits\" rule to the very last number of the sequence provided, which is 124.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs this calculation and follows the instructions:\n\n```python\ndef find_next_number(n):\n  \"\"\"\n  Calculates the next number in the sequence by summing the squares of the digits.\n  This function also prints the equation used for the calculation as requested.\n  \"\"\"\n  s_num = str(n)\n  digits = [int(d) for d in s_num]\n  \n  # Build the equation string to display it\n  equation_parts = []\n  for d in digits:\n    equation_parts.append(f\"{d}^2\")\n  \n  equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n  \n  # Calculate the result\n  result = sum(d**2 for d in digits)\n  \n  # Print the equation, showing how each digit is used\n  print(f\"The calculation for the next number is based on the last number, {n}.\")\n  print(f\"The equation is: {equation_str} = {result}\")\n\n# The last number in the given sequence\nlast_number = 124\n\nfind_next_number(last_number)\n```\n<<<21>>>"
