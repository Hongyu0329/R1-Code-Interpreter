    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The integral has the form `∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx`. This is a standard integral form whose result is `ln(|f(x)|)`. In our case, `f(x) = F₃(x)`.\n2.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral:** The definite integral from 0 to 1 is `[ln(|F₃(x)|)]` from 0 to 1. This evaluates to `ln(|F₃(1)|) - ln(|F₃(0)|)`.\n3.  **Calculate F₃(1) and F₃(0):**\n    *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n4.  **Check for Absolute Values:** Since `sin(1)` is positive, `e^(sin(1))` is positive, and thus `F₃(1)` is positive. `F₃(0) = ln(2)` is also positive. So we can drop the absolute value signs.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:** The value of the integral `V` is `ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`. The final result will be the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the function F3(x)\n# F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n# Step 2: The integral ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 evaluates to ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\n# Let's calculate the components of this equation.\n\n# Calculate F₃(1)\nf3_at_1 = math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(1)))\n\n# Calculate F₃(0)\nf3_at_0 = math.log(2)\n\nprint(f\"The equation to solve is: V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\")\nprint(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) = {f3_at_1}\")\nprint(f\"F₃(0) = ln(2) = {f3_at_0}\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the value of the integral, V.\nV = math.log(f3_at_1) - math.log(f3_at_0)\n\nprint(f\"V = ln({f3_at_1}) - ln({f3_at_0}) = {V}\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate 10000 * V and find the closest integer.\nfinal_value = 10000 * V\nclosest_integer = round(final_value)\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe final reported value is the closest integer to 10000 * V.\")\nprint(f\"10000 * {V} = {final_value}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer is: {closest_integer}\")\n\n# The format <<<answer>>> is a special instruction for the system.\n# The final answer is the integer value calculated.\n# <<<5483>>>\n```\n<<<5483>>>"
