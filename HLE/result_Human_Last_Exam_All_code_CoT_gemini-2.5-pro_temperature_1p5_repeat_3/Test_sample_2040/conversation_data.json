    "Here is a plan to answer your question.\nFirst, I will analyze the requirements for a material to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). Second, I will examine the known physical properties of free-standing boron nanosheets, specifically their crystal structure and symmetry. Finally, by comparing the material requirements for SPDC with the properties of boron nanosheets, I will draw a conclusion and present it using a Python script as requested.\n\nThe Python script below will print out a step-by-step explanation of the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_spdc_in_boron_nanosheets():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and explains whether free-standing boron nanosheets would\n    exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the primary requirement for SPDC.\")\n    print(\"Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process.\")\n    print(\"A fundamental requirement for any material to exhibit a second-order nonlinear effect is that its crystal structure must lack inversion symmetry (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 75)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Examine the crystal symmetry of boron nanosheets.\")\n    print(\"Free-standing boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, can have multiple possible structures (polymorphs).\")\n    print(\"However, the most commonly synthesized and theoretically stable phases (such as β12 and χ3) possess a center of inversion, meaning they are centrosymmetric.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 75)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Combine the requirement and the material property to reach a conclusion.\")\n    print(\"In materials with a centrosymmetric crystal structure, the second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero by definition.\")\n    print(\"Since SPDC is a process that depends directly on a non-zero χ⁽²⁾, ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets in their common phases are not expected to exhibit SPDC.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 75)\n    \n    print(\"Important Caveat:\")\n    print(\"While an ideal, infinite sheet would not exhibit SPDC, symmetry can be broken at the edges of a nanosheet, or by defects, strain, or interaction with a substrate. These effects could potentially lead to a very weak second-order nonlinear response, but SPDC would not be considered a characteristic feature of the material itself.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    analyze_spdc_in_boron_nanosheets()\n```\n<<<No. The most common and stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) are centrosymmetric. Spontaneous parametric downconversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process that can only occur in materials lacking inversion symmetry (non-centrosymmetric materials). Therefore, ideal boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit this effect.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    When excited by incident light, would free-standing boron nanosheets be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
