No. The most common and stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) are centrosymmetric. Spontaneous parametric downconversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process that can only occur in materials lacking inversion symmetry (non-centrosymmetric materials). Therefore, ideal boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit this effect.
