    "My plan is to first identify the protein in question. The user is asking about a protein whose breakdown or inhibition allows macrophages to engulf amyloid, a key feature in Alzheimer's disease research. This points to a \"don't eat me\" signal that normally protects cells or structures from being cleared by the immune system. In this context, the primary protein that fits this description is CD47. CD47 on a target surface interacts with the SIRPα receptor on macrophages, sending a powerful inhibitory signal that prevents phagocytosis (engulfment). Research has shown that CD47 is present around amyloid plaques, and blocking the CD47-SIRPα pathway enhances the ability of microglia (the brain's macrophages) to clear these plaques.\n\nTherefore, the protein is CD47. I will now create a Python script to print this answer as requested.\n\n```python\ndef identify_protein():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the name of the protein that functions as an inhibitory signal\n    for macrophage engulfment of amyloid. When this protein is broken down or blocked,\n    it allows for amyloid clearance.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The protein is known as CD47. It is a \"don't eat me\" signal that inhibits\n    # phagocytosis by macrophages when it binds to the SIRPα receptor.\n    protein_name = \"CD47\"\n    \n    # Print the explanation and the name of the protein.\n    print(f\"The protein that, when broken down or blocked, allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid is: {protein_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_protein()\n```\n<<<CD47>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
