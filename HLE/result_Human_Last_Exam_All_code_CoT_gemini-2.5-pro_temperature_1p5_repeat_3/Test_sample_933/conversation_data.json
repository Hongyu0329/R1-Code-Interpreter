    "To solve this, I will research the common industrial and laboratory methods for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄). The key is to find the conditions, specifically the temperature, that allow for an \"efficient\" reaction, meaning a good yield and reaction rate. I will then identify the lowest such temperature and compare it against the given multiple-choice options.\n\nMy plan is to embed this chemical knowledge into a Python script. The script will:\n1.  Store a list of known synthesis methods for various xenon fluorides, including their reaction conditions.\n2.  Programmatically search this data to find the method for producing XeF₄.\n3.  Identify the lowest temperature among the methods described as efficient.\n4.  Print the details of this synthesis method and select the corresponding answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef find_synthesis_temperature():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes known synthesis methods for Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4)\n    to find the coldest temperature for efficient production.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A database of known synthesis methods for Xenon fluorides.\n    # The 'notes' field indicates if the method is considered efficient for general purposes.\n    synthesis_data = [\n        {\n            \"product\": \"XeF4\",\n            \"reactants\": \"Xenon + Fluorine (1:5 ratio)\",\n            \"temperature_C\": 400,\n            \"notes\": \"The first reported method by Claassen, Selig, and Malm in 1962.
