    # The problem asks for the smallest number of topologically distinct compactifications
    # of the ray [0,1) with remainder X, where X is a nondegenerate,
    # locally-connected, compact metric space.

    # This number is equivalent to the number of orbits of nonempty continua
    # (nonempty, compact, connected subsets) of X under the action of the group
    # of homeomorphisms of X.

    # Step 1: Establish a lower bound for the number of orbits.
    # For any valid space X, we can identify at least three types of continua
    # that must belong to different orbits, because a homeomorphism preserves
    # properties like the number of points and being a proper subset.

    # Category 1: The entire space X.
    # A homeomorphism of X maps X to itself. So, {X} always forms a single orbit.
    num_orbits_for_X_itself = 1

    # Category 2: Single-point subsets {p}.
    # A homeomorphism maps a point to a point. A single point cannot be mapped to
    # the whole space X (as X is nondegenerate), so this category is distinct.

    # Category 3: Proper, non-degenerate continua.
    # A space X matching the criteria (a Peano continuum) must contain a subcontinuum C
    # that is not a single point and not the whole space. Such a C cannot be mapped
    # to a point (different cardinality) or to X (it's a proper subset).
    # This means this category is distinct from the other two.

    # Since these three categories of continua are fundamentally different and cannot be
    # mapped into one another, there must be at least three orbits.
    lower_bound = 3

    # Step 2: Find a space X that achieves this lower bound.
    # Consider the circle, X = S^1. It is nondegenerate, locally-connected, compact, and metric.
    # Let's count its orbits of continua.

    # The continua in S^1 are:
    # 1. Single points.
    # 2. Proper closed arcs (homeomorphic to [0,1]).
    # 3. The entire circle S^1.

    # The homeomorphisms of S^1 (including rotations, reflections, etc.) act on these continua.
    # - Orbit 1 (Points): The circle is 'homogeneous', meaning any point can be mapped to any other
    #   point by a homeomorphism. So, all single-point continua form one orbit.
    # - Orbit 2 (Arcs): Any proper closed arc can be mapped to any other proper closed arc.
    #   So, all such arcs form a second orbit.
    # - Orbit 3 (Whole Space): The entire circle S^1 can only be mapped to itself, forming a third orbit.

    # The number of orbits for X = S^1 is exactly 3.
    num_orbits_for_s1 = 3

    # Step 3: Conclude the final answer.
    # The minimum possible number of orbits is at least 3, and we have found a space
    # that results in exactly 3 orbits. Therefore, the smallest number is 3.
    final_answer = 3
