  """
  Solves the theoretical questions about dessin d'enfants.
  
  (a) If G/N is cyclic, must D_N be unicellular?
  Reasoning: Yes. The quasiprimitivity of G on the face set F implies that its socle N is transitive on F.
  A transitive action has exactly one orbit, meaning the quotient D_N has one face, i.e., it is unicellular.
  The condition on G/N is irrelevant.

  (b) Specify the types (HA, TW, AS) for which G can be the automorphism group of D if D is a smooth covering of a unicellular dessin.
  Reasoning: A smooth covering corresponds to the group-theoretic factorization G = G_f * N.
  This factorization is known to be possible for quasiprimitive groups of type HA (affine) and AS (almost simple).
  It is known to be impossible for groups of type TW (twisted wreath).
  Thus, the possible types are HA and AS.

  (c) True or False: If G is of type TW with l <= 5, D cannot be a smooth covering of D_N.
  Reasoning: True. As established in (b), groups of type TW can never be the automorphism group of a smooth covering of D_N.
  This holds regardless of the parameter l.
