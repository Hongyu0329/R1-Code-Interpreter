    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will represent the permutation group $G$ using the `sympy` library in Python. The set $\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z \\}$ will be mapped to the set of integers $\\{0, 1, ..., 11\\}$ for this purpose.\n2.  Next, I will use `sympy`'s functions to identify the group $G$. I'll compute its order and check if it is isomorphic to a known group, specifically the alternating group $A_6$. This is a crucial step as calculating the Schur multiplier from scratch is extremely difficult.\n3.  Once $G$ is identified as $A_6$, I will use the known mathematical result that the Schur multiplier of $A_6$, denoted as $A$, is the cyclic group of order 6, $C_6$.\n4.  The problem then reduces to finding the number of proper subgroups of $C_6$, up to isomorphism.\n5.  The subgroups of a cyclic group $C_n$ are themselves cyclic, and there is one for each divisor of $n$. The non-isomorphic subgroups therefore correspond to the divisors of $n$.\n6.  I will calculate the divisors of 6. The proper subgroups correspond to the proper divisors (divisors other than 6 itself).\n7.  Finally, I will count these proper divisors to get the number of proper subgroups up to isomorphism and print out the result along with the reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.perm_groups import PermutationGroup\nfrom sympy.ntheory import divisors\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.named_groups import AlternatingGroup\n\ndef solve_group_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the problem by identifying the group, its Schur multiplier,\n    and then counting the proper subgroups of the multiplier up to isomorphism.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem defines a group G on the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z}.\n    # For computational purposes, we map these 12 elements to integers 0-11:\n    # 1->0, 2->1, 3->2, 4->3, 5->4, 6->5, 7->6, 8->7, 9->8, x->9, y->10, z->11\n\n    # The generators are given in cycle notation.
