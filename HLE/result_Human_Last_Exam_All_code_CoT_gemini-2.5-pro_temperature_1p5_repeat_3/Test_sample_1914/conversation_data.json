    "To solve this problem, we need to systematically enumerate all possible category structures on 2 objects with 4 morphisms, and then count how many of these are distinct up to isomorphism.\n\n### My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the basic components.** A category with 2 objects, say A and B, and 4 morphisms. Two of these morphisms must be the identity morphisms, $id_A$ and $id_B$. This leaves 2 non-identity morphisms to be placed.\n2.  **Partition by morphism distribution.** The two non-identity morphisms, let's call them $f$ and $g$, can be distributed among the four possible Hom-sets: $\\text{Hom}(A, A)$, $\\text{Hom}(A, B)$, $\\text{Hom}(B, A)$, and $\\text{Hom}(B, B)$.\n3.  **Account for isomorphism.** A categorical isomorphism can relabel the objects. This means a distribution of morphisms $(n_{AA}, n_{AB}, n_{BA}, n_{BB})$ is equivalent to $(n_{BB}, n_{BA}, n_{AB}, n_{AA})$. We can use this symmetry to reduce the number of cases we need to analyze.\n4.  **Analyze each case.** For each distinct distribution of morphisms, we determine the possible composition rules that satisfy the category axioms (especially associativity).\n5.  **Count non-isomorphic categories within each case.** Within each case, different composition rules might lead to different categories. We count how many of these are non-isomorphic.\n6.  **Sum the results.** The total number of categories is the sum of the counts from all the distinct cases, as the distribution of morphisms into Hom-sets is an invariant (up to object relabeling).\n\nThis step-by-step process allows us to break down a complex combinatorial problem into smaller, manageable parts. The Python code below will implement this plan by explaining each case and summing the results.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_category_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, we follow a systematic approach.\")\n    print(\"Let the objects be A and B.
