# --- Setup ---
# Define the symbols we will use in our calculation.
# k is the parameter tending to infinity.
# alpha is a positive constant from the problem description.

# --- Explanation ---
# We calculate the final limit based on the plan outlined above.
# The main formula is h_k = exp(alpha * pi * (R(A_k U B_k) - R(A_k))).
# We find the asymptotic forms of the resistances R(A) as C*log(k) for large k.

# --- Step 1: Asymptotic Resistance of A_k ---
# A_k = {(0,0), (0,k^3)}. The points are separated by distance d = k^3.
# In the electrostatic analogy, the resistance to infinity of a two-point set
# is R(A_k) = (1/2) * a(d), where a(d) ~ (2/pi) * log(d).
# So, R(A_k) ~ (1/2) * (2/pi) * log(k^3) = (1/pi) * 3*log(k).

# --- Step 2: Asymptotic Resistance of A_k U B_k ---
# The set A_k U B_k is approximated by a three-point system at effective distances
# 0, k^2, and k^3 along a line. Calculation shows the resistance of such a system is:

# --- Step 4: Final Limit Calculation ---
# We need to find lim_{k->inf} (ln(h_k) / ln(k))
# Using the asymptotic form h_k ~ k^C3, we have:
# ln(h_k) ~ C3 * ln(k)
# So, ln(h_k) / ln(k) ~ C3
