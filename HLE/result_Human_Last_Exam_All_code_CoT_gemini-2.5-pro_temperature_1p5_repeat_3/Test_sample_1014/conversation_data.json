    "Of course. To find the largest prime divisor of 8139881, I will perform prime factorization on the number.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Initialize**: Start with the number `n = 8139881` and an empty list to store its prime factors.\n2.  **Trial Division**: I will use the trial division method to find the factors.\n    *   First, I'll check for the smallest prime, 2. I'll repeatedly divide `n` by 2 until it's no longer even, adding a '2' to my list of factors for each successful division.\n    *   Next, I'll move on to odd numbers, starting from `d = 3`.\n    *   For each `d`, I will repeatedly divide `n` by `d` as long as it's divisible, adding `d` to the factors list each time.\n    *   I only need to check for divisors `d` up to the square root of the current `n`. This is a key optimization that makes the process much faster.\n3.  **Final Factor**: After the loop finishes, if the remaining value of `n` is greater than 1, this remaining value is itself a prime factor (and will be the largest one).\n4.  **Output**: Once the list of all prime factors is complete, I will print the full factorization equation. Then, I will identify and print the largest number from that list.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest prime divisor for the number 8139881.\n    It prints the prime factorization equation and then the largest prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number we want to factor\n    number = 8139881\n    \n    n = number\n    factors = []\n    \n    # First, handle the factor of 2\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n //= 2\n        \n    # Next, handle odd factors starting from 3.\n    # We only need to check up to the square root of the number.\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        # If i is a factor, keep dividing n by it\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n //= i\n        i += 2\n        \n    # If n is still greater than 1 after the divisions,\n    # the remaining n is a prime factor itself.\n    if n > 1:\n        factors.append(int(n))\n        \n    # Print the prime factorization equation\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of {number} is:\")\n    equation = f\"{number} = {' * '.join(map(str, factors))}\"\n    print(equation)\n    \n    # Find the largest prime factor from our list\n    largest_prime = max(factors)\n    \n    # Print the final result\n    print(f\"\\nThe largest prime divisor of {number} is {largest_prime}.\")\n\nfind_largest_prime_divisor()\n```\n<<<80593>>>"
