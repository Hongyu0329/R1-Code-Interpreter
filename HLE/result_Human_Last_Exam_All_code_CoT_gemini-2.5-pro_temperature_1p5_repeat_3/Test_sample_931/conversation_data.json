    "To determine what adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) feed on, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Gather Information:** Access entomological knowledge about the diet of adult Raphidioptera. It's known that they are predators, but I will also check for any supplementary food sources like nectar or pollen.\n2.  **Analyze the Options:** Evaluate each answer choice based on the gathered information.\n    *   **A (Nectar) & E (Aphids):** Adult snakeflies are primarily predators of small, soft-bodied insects like aphids. Some sources also confirm they supplement their diet with nectar and pollen. Therefore, both A and E are plausible.\n    *   **B (Māhoe pollen) & D (Karamū leaf tissue):** Māhoe and Karamū are plants native to New Zealand. Raphidioptera are not found in New Zealand, so they would not have evolved to feed on these specific species. This makes B and D incorrect.\n    *   **C (Fungus):** This is not a known food source for snakeflies.\n3.  **Synthesize the Result:** Since both A (Nectar) and E (Aphids) are correct food sources, the most accurate answer is the one that combines them. Option F does exactly this.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that programmatically represents this logical deduction. The script will define the known diet, evaluate the options, and print the reasoning, including a symbolic equation that combines the correct choices to fulfill the user's request.\n\n```python\ndef solve_snakefly_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the diet of adult Raphidiopterans to find the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the known general diet of adult Raphidioptera.\n    # They are predators but also visit flowers.\n    known_food_sources = {\n        \"Nectar\": True,\n        \"Aphids\": True,\n        \"Fungus\": False,\n        \"Leaf tissue\": False\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Define the answer choices provided in the question.\n    # Note: \"Totara\", \"Māhoe\", and \"Karamū\" are specific to New Zealand,\n    # where Raphidioptera are not native. However, \"Totara Aphids\" are a type of aphid.\n    choices = {\n        'A': \"Nectar\",\n        'B': \"Māhoe pollen\",\n        'C': \"Fungus\",\n        'D': \"Karamū leaf tissue\",\n        'E': \"Totara Aphids\",\n        'F': \"A and E\",\n        'G': \"D and E\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Evaluate the primary components of the choices.\n    is_nectar_eaten = known_food_sources[\"Nectar\"]\n    is_aphids_eaten = known_food_sources[\"Aphids\"]\n\n    print(\"Evaluating individual food sources for adult Raphidiopterans:\")\n    print(f\"- Do they eat Nectar? {'Yes' if is_nectar_eaten else 'No'}.

This validates choice E.\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Determine the most comprehensive correct answer.\n    # Since both A and E are correct, we look for an option that combines them.\n    correct_combination = \"F\"\n    \n    print(\"\\nSince choices A and E are both correct, the best answer combines them.\")\n    print(\"The symbolic equation to find the answer is:\")\n    print(\"Choice 'A' + Choice 'E' => Choice 'F'\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer Details:\")\n    print(f\"The correct option is {correct_combination}: {choices[correct_combination]}\")\n\nsolve_snakefly_diet()\n```\n<<<F>>>"
