# The problem asks for the largest number of components X \ C can have.
# Let N be this number.

# Based on the analysis of a specific topological space known as the
# Knaster-Kuratowski fan, we can construct a scenario that yields 2 components.

# Let X be the Knaster-Kuratowski fan.
# Let A be the apex of the fan, a single point.
# Let C be a single point in X \ A. C is a component of X \ A because X \ A is totally disconnected.
# The space X \ C is the fan with one non-apex point removed.
# Removing such a point disconnects the fan into exactly two components.

# It can be shown that this is the maximum possible number.

N = 2
