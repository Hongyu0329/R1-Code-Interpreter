    "To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Formula**: The Crawley-Nordström invariant ($c$) for a Calabi-Yau hypersurface defined by a polynomial of degree $d$ in a weighted projective space with weights $(w_1, ..., w_5)$ is given by the formula:\n    $c = (d^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i^2) / d$\n\n2.  **Determine the Degree (d)**: The polynomial must be weighted-homogeneous, meaning every monomial must have the same weighted degree. The weighted degree of a monomial $z_1^{a_1}z_2^{a_2}...z_5^{a_5}$ is calculated as $a_1w_1 + a_2w_2 + ... + a_5w_5$. The weights are given as $(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n    Let's check the degrees of the terms in the polynomial $f = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$:\n    *   $z_1^8z_3$: $8 \\times 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$\n    *   $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$: $4 \\times 22 + 3 \\times 29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$\n    *   $z_1z_2^7$: $1 \\times 22 + 7 \\times 29 = 22 + 203 = 225$\n    *   $z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5$: $22+29+49+50+75 = 225$\n    *   $z_2z_3^4$: $29 + 4 \\times 49 = 29 + 196 = 225$\n    *   $z_4^3z_5$: $3 \\times 50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$\n    *   $z_5^3$: $3 \\times 75 = 225$\n    The polynomial is not weighted-homogeneous. This is likely a typo in the problem statement. Since all terms except one have a degree of 225, we will assume the intended degree of the Calabi-Yau manifold is $d=225$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Sum of Squared Weights ($\\sum w_i^2$)**:\n    $\\sum w_i^2 = 22^2 + 29^2 + 49^2 + 50^2 + 75^2$\n\n4.  **Compute the Invariant**: Substitute the values into the formula and solve.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the detailed steps and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_crawley_nordstrom():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a given Calabi-Yau Link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define weights and degree.\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n    \n    # As explained in the text, we assume the degree d=225.\n    d = 225\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the components of the formula.\n    d_squared = d**2\n    weights_squared = [w**2 for w in weights]\n    sum_weights_squared = sum(weights_squared)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the invariant.\n    numerator = d_squared - sum_weights_squared\n    denominator = d\n    c_invariant = numerator / denominator\n\n    # Step 4: Print the detailed equation and the result, as requested.\n    print(f\"The Crawley-Nordström invariant 'c' is calculated using the formula:\")\n    print(f\"c = (d^2 - Σ(wi^2)) / d\")\n    print(f\"\\nGiven weights: {weights}\")\n    print(f\"Assumed degree d: {d}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nCalculation steps:\")\n    print(f\"d^2 = {d}^2 = {d_squared}\")\n\n    w_sq_str = ' + '.join([str(w) + '^2' for w in weights])\n    w_sq_val_str = ' + '.join(map(str, weights_squared))\n    print(f\"Σ(wi^2) = {w_sq_str}\")\n    print(f\"         = {w_sq_val_str}\")\n    print(f\"         = {sum_weights_squared}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\")\n    print(f\"c = ({d_squared} - {sum_weights_squared}) / {d}\")\n    print(f\"c = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\n    \n    # Check for common factors to present a simplified fraction\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)\n    if common_divisor > 1:\n        simplified_num = numerator // common_divisor\n        simplified_den = denominator // common_divisor\n        print(f\"c = {simplified_num} / {simplified_den} (in simplest form)\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Result:\")\n    print(f\"The Crawley-Nordström invariant is {c_invariant}\")\n\n\nsolve_crawley_nordstrom()\n```\n<<<38774/225>>>"
