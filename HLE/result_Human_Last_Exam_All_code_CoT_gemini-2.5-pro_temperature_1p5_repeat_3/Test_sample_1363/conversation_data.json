    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem.\n1. I will create a data structure in Python to represent each of the five dances listed in the answer choices.\n2. For each dance, I will store a brief technical analysis focusing on how turns, specifically reverse turns, are executed and whether overturning them is a variation of the existing technique or a violation of it.\n3. The key distinction will be between swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep), which use CBM, sway, and momentum for turns, and non-swing dances (Tango), which use a different mechanical action.\n4. The code will iterate through this data, print the analysis for each dance, and programmatically determine which dance's core technique is disregarded by overturning a reverse turn.\n5. Finally, the program will print the name of the correct dance and its corresponding letter choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes dance techniques to determine in which dance overturning a reverse turn\n    is impossible without disregarding the core technique.\n    \"\"\"\n    dance_techniques = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Viennese Waltz',\n            'analysis': 'A swing dance defined by continuous rotation.
