    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Understand the Turing Machine Rules:** The problem provides rules for three 5-state Turing machines. The rules are given in a condensed format. I'll interpret them using a standard convention for Busy Beaver problems:\n    *   The states are A, B, C, D, E in that order. 'H' is the halt state.\n    *   The rules are provided in pairs for each state: the first for reading a '0', the second for reading a '1'.\n    *   Each rule `XYZ` means: Transition to state `X`, write symbol `Y`, and move the head in direction `Z` ('L' for Left, 'R' for Right).\n\n2.  **Create a Turing Machine Simulator:** I will write a Python script to simulate a Turing machine. This simulator will need to keep track of:\n    *   The machine's current state (starts at 'A').\n    *   The tape contents (an infinite tape, initially all '0's). A dictionary is suitable for this, mapping positions to values (0 or 1).\n    *   The current position of the read/write head (starts at 0).\n    *   The number of steps taken.\n\n3.  **Parse the Rules:** The script will first parse the compact rule string for each machine into a more usable data structure, like a nested dictionary: `rules[current_state][value_read] = (next_state, value_to_write, direction_to_move)`.\n\n4.  **Simulate Each Machine:** The script will run the simulation for each of the three machines on an empty tape. The simulation will continue step-by-step, applying the appropriate rule, until the machine enters the 'H' (halt) state.\n\n5.  **Count Steps and Compare:** For each machine, the simulator will count the total number of steps until it halts. After running all three simulations, I will compare the step counts to find the maximum.\n\n6.  **Output the Result:** The final code will print the number of steps each machine took to halt, and then identify which machine ran for the most steps and what that step count was.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef simulate_turing_machine(name, rule_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Parses a rule string and simulates the corresponding Turing Machine.\n\n    Args:\n        name (str): The identifier for the machine (e.g., \"Machine 1\").\n        rule_string (str): The string containing the machine's rules.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of steps the machine takes to halt.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
