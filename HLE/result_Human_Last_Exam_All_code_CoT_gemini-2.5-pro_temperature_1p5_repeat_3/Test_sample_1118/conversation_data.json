    "This is a factual question about art history. To adhere to the requested format, I will write a simple Python script that stores the answer in a variable and then prints it.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Research the 1933 self-portrait by Curt Querner painted after his escape/release from the Gestapo.\n2.  Identify the object he holds in his hand that is interpreted as a symbol of resistance. The most famous self-portrait from this period is \"Selbstbildnis mit rotem Tuch\" (Self-Portrait with Red Cloth).\n3.  Create a Python script that assigns this object's name to a variable.\n4.  The script will then print a sentence containing the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the object Curt Querner held in his 1933 self-portrait\n    as a symbol of resistance after his arrest by the Gestapo.\n    \"\"\"\n    # In his 1933 \"Self-Portrait with Red Cloth\", Querner holds a red cloth.\n    # The color red was a powerful symbol of his communist and socialist beliefs,\n    # making this a clear act of political defiance.\n    artist = \"Curt Querner\"\n    year = 1933\n    symbol = \"a red cloth\"\n\n    print(f\"In a self-portrait from {year}, painted after his trouble with the Gestapo, {artist} holds {symbol} as a symbol of resistance.\")\n\nfind_symbol()\n```\n<<<a red cloth>>>"
