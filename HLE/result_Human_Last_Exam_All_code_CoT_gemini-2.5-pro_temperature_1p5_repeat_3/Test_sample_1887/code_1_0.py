    This function solves the set theory problem and prints the resulting order type.

    The problem asks for the order type of the set X of possible cofinalities
    of the cardinality of the power set of the natural numbers (2^omega),
    given the following conditions:
    1. The continuum hypothesis fails (2^omega > aleph_1).
    2. 2^omega < aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}.
    3. 2^omega is not a regular cardinal (i.e., it is singular).

    Step 1: Determine the set X of possible cofinalities.
    Let kappa = 2^omega and lambda = cf(kappa).
    - From Konig's Theorem, cf(2^omega) > omega, so lambda >= aleph_1.
    - By definition, the cofinality of a cardinal, lambda, must be a regular cardinal.
    - Since kappa is singular, lambda < kappa.
    - Since kappa < aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}, we have lambda < aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}.
    - Easton's Theorem implies that any regular cardinal lambda satisfying these conditions is a possible
      cofinality for 2^omega.
    Thus, X = {lambda | lambda is a regular cardinal and aleph_1 <= lambda < aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}}.

    Step 2: Find the order type of X.
    The order type of this set of cardinals is the order type of their indices.
    Let R be the set of ordinals alpha such that aleph_alpha is in X.
    R = {alpha | 1 <= alpha < omega_{omega+5} and aleph_alpha is a regular cardinal}.

    Step 3: Calculate the order type of R.
    A cardinal aleph_alpha (for alpha > 0) is regular if alpha is a successor ordinal,
    or if alpha is a regular limit ordinal (an index of a weakly inaccessible cardinal).
    Let S be the set of successor ordinals less than omega_{omega+5}.
    S = {beta + 1 | beta < omega_{omega+5}}.
    The set S is a subset of R.
    The order type of S is omega_{omega+5}, as the map f(beta) = beta + 1 is an
    order-isomorphism from the set of ordinals less than omega_{omega+5} to S.
    Since S is a subset of R, and R is a subset of the ordinals less than omega_{omega+5},
    the order type of R is sandwiched between the order type of S and omega_{omega+5}.
    type(S) <= type(R) <= type(omega_{omega+5}).
    Since type(S) = omega_{omega+5}, it follows that type(R) = omega_{omega+5}.

    The final answer is the ordinal omega_(omega+5).
