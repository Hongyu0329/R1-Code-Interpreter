    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar\", we first need to define the structure of the parent \"nanocar\" molecule.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Molecule:** \"Nanocar\" is a nickname for a class of molecules synthesized to resemble a car on a molecular scale. We will use a well-documented nanocar chassis structure from the literature, which has the molecular formula **C₄₂H₃₀**. This means it is a hydrocarbon made of 42 carbon atoms and 30 hydrogen atoms.\n2.  **Understand the \"Perfluoro-\" Prefix:** In chemistry, the prefix \"perfluoro-\" indicates that all hydrogen atoms on the parent hydrocarbon backbone have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Fluorine Atoms:** Based on the prefix, the number of fluorine atoms in the \"perfluoronanocar\" will be equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar.\n4.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will assign the number of hydrogen atoms (30) to a variable and then use it to state the number of fluorine atoms in the final perfluorinated molecule, printing the final count.\n\n```python\n# 1. Define the number of hydrogen atoms in a known nanocar chassis.\n# The chemical formula for this specific parent hydrocarbon is C42H30.\nnum_hydrogens = 30\n\n# 2. The prefix \"perfluoro-\" means every hydrogen atom is replaced by a fluorine atom.\n# Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms.\nnum_fluorines = num_hydrogens\n\n# 3. The chemical formula for the resulting perfluoronanocar would be C42F30.\nparent_formula = f\"C42H{num_hydrogens}\"\nperfluoro_formula = f\"C42F{num_fluorines}\"\n\n# 4. Print the explanation and the final answer.\nprint(f\"The chemical formula of the parent nanocar chassis is {parent_formula}.\")\nprint(f\"The number of hydrogen atoms in the parent nanocar is {num_hydrogens}.\")\nprint(f\"In a 'perfluoronanocar', all {num_hydrogens} hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the final count of fluorine atoms is equal to the original count of hydrogen atoms.\")\nprint(f\"Number of Fluorine atoms = {num_fluorines}\")\n```\n<<<30>>>"
