# 1. Define the number of hydrogen atoms in a known nanocar chassis.
# The chemical formula for this specific parent hydrocarbon is C42H30.
num_hydrogens = 30

# 2. The prefix "perfluoro-" means every hydrogen atom is replaced by a fluorine atom.
# Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms.
num_fluorines = num_hydrogens

# 3. The chemical formula for the resulting perfluoronanocar would be C42F30.
parent_formula = f"C42H{num_hydrogens}"
perfluoro_formula = f"C42F{num_fluorines}"

# 4. Print the explanation and the final answer.
print(f"The chemical formula of the parent nanocar chassis is {parent_formula}.")
print(f"The number of hydrogen atoms in the parent nanocar is {num_hydrogens}.")
print(f"In a 'perfluoronanocar', all {num_hydrogens} hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.")
print(f"Therefore, the final count of fluorine atoms is equal to the original count of hydrogen atoms.")
print(f"Number of Fluorine atoms = {num_fluorines}")
