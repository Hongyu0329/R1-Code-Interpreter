    "To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$, we will follow a clear plan.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **K端nneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology**: We will use the K端nneth-like isomorphism for the bounded cohomology of a direct product of groups, established by Nicolas Monod. For two groups $G_1$ and $G_2$, the formula for dimensions is:\n    $$ \\dim H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=n} \\dim H_b^p(G_1, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(G_2, \\mathbb{R}) $$\n\n2.  **Applying the Formula**: In our case, $G_1 = G_2 = T$ (Thompson's group T) and the degree is $n=4$. The formula becomes:\n    $$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=4} \\dim H_b^p(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(T, \\mathbb{R}) $$\n\n3.  **Dimensions of Bounded Cohomology of T**: We need the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of Thompson's group T, denoted $h_b^k(T) = \\dim H_b^k(T, \\mathbb{R})$, for $k$ from 0 to 4. Based on established results in geometric group theory:\n    *   $h_b^0(T) = 1$: The dimension of the 0-th cohomology group is always 1 for any non-empty group.\n    *   $h_b^1(T) = 0$: The first bounded cohomology group with real coefficients is always zero for any group.\n    *   $h_b^2(T) = 1$: This is a famous result, with the cohomology group being generated by the bounded Euler class.\n    *   $h_b^n(T) = \\infty$ for $n \\ge 3$: It's a key result by Burger and Monod that for non-elementary groups acting on the circle, including Thompson's group T, the bounded cohomology groups $H_b^n(G, \\mathbb{R})$ are infinite-dimensional (specifically, non-separable Banach spaces) for all $n \\ge 3$.\n\n4.  **Calculation**: We will substitute these dimension values into the K端nneth formula and sum up the terms. The sum will involve terms with infinity. In the context of vector space dimensions, the product $d_1 \\cdot d_2$ is 0 if either $d_1$ or $d_2$ is 0; otherwise, if one is infinite, the product is infinite. The sum of dimensions will be infinite if any term is infinite.\n\n5.  **Python Code**: We will write a Python script to perform this calculation, printing out each term of the sum to demonstrate how the final result is obtained.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_bounded_cohomology_dim():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group\n    of T x T with trivial real coefficients.\n    \"\"\"\n    degree = 4\n    \n    # Known dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of Thompson's group T, H_b^k(T, R).\n    # h_b^n(T) is infinite-dimensional for n >= 3, a result by Burger and Monod.\n    h_b_T = {\n        0: 1,\n        1: 0,\n        2: 1,\n        3: math.inf,\n        4: math.inf\n    }\n\n    total_dim = 0\n    \n    # We use the K端nneth formula for dimensions:\n    # dim H_b^n(T x T) = sum_{p+q=n} dim H_b^p(T) * dim H_b^q(T)\n    \n    print(f\"The dimension of H_b^{degree}(T x T, R) is the sum of the following terms:\")\n    \n    equation_parts = []\n    \n    for p in range(degree + 1):\n        q = degree - p\n        \n        dim_p = h_b_T.get(p, 0)\n        dim_q = h_b_T.get(q, 0)\n        \n        # In the context of tensor product of vector spaces, dim(V tensor W) = dim(V) * dim(W).\n        # If one space has dimension 0, the tensor product is the zero space, so its dimension is 0.\n        if dim_p == 0 or dim_q == 0:\n            term_dim = 0\n        else:\n            term_dim = dim_p * dim_q\n            \n        total_dim += term_dim\n\n        # For printing, represent infinity as 'inf'\n        dim_p_str = 'inf' if math.isinf(dim_p) else str(dim_p)\n        dim_q_str = 'inf' if math.isinf(dim_q) else str(dim_q)\n        term_dim_str = 'inf' if math.isinf(term_dim) else str(term_dim)\n        \n        print(f\"p={p}, q={q}: dim(H_b^{p}(T)) * dim(H_b^{q}(T)) = {dim_p_str} * {dim_q_str} = {term_dim_str}\")\n        equation_parts.append(f\"{dim_p_str}*{dim_q_str}\")\n\n    total_dim_str = 'infinity' if math.isinf(total_dim) else str(total_dim)\n    \n    print(\"\\nFull equation:\")\n    print(f\"dim H_b^4(T x T) = \" + \" + \".join(equation_parts))\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Result:\")\n    print(f\"The total dimension is {total_dim_str}.\")\n\ncompute_bounded_cohomology_dim()\n\n```\n<<<infinity>>>"
