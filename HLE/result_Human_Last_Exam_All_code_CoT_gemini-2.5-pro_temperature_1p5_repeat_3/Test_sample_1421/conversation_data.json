    "Of course. Here is the formula for the fermionic partition function in the imaginary time path integral formalism.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Partition Function (Z):** The starting point is the quantum statistical definition of the partition function, `Z = Tr(e^(-βH))`.\n2.  **Introduce the Path Integral:** I will translate this trace operation into a Feynman path integral. For fermions, this involves integrating over anti-commuting Grassmann fields.\n3.  **Define the Euclidean Action (S_E):** The term in the exponential, `e^(-βH)`, becomes `e^(-S_E)`, where `S_E` is the action in imaginary time (Euclidean spacetime). I will provide the standard form of this action for a general single-particle Hamiltonian `H₀`.\n4.  **Specify Boundary Conditions:** A key feature of fermions in the imaginary time formalism is that the fields must obey anti-periodic boundary conditions in the time direction. I will state this condition explicitly.\n5.  **Present the Formula:** I will write a Python script that uses `print` statements to display all the components of the final formula in a clear and organized manner.\n\n```python\ndef display_fermionic_partition_function_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the formula for the fermionic partition function Z\n    in the imaginary time path integral formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The formula for the fermionic partition function Z is given by a path integral over Grassmann fields:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Main formula for Z\n    print(\"\\nZ = ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ exp(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Where:\")\n    # Integral measure\n    print(\"  - ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ: Represents the functional (or path) integral over all possible configurations\")\n    print(\"    of the independent Grassmann fields ψ̄(τ, x) and ψ(τ, x).\")\n\n    # Action S_E\n    print(\"\\n  - S_E[ψ̄, ψ]: Is the Euclidean action for the fermionic system, defined as:\")\n    print(\"    S_E = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x  L_E(ψ̄, ψ)\")\n\n    # Lagrangian L_E\n    print(\"\\n    Where L_E is the Euclidean Lagrangian density.
