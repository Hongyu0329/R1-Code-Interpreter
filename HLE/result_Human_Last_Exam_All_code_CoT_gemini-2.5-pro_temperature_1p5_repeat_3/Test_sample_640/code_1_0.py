    Analyzes the statements about two-channel quantum scattering and identifies the correct ones.

    Based on the analysis:
    - The property of being "nontrivially coupled" (not diagonalizable by a constant basis change) is shared between the potential V(r), the S-matrix S(E), and the Jost matrix F(E).
    - The property of being "diagonal" is also shared between V(r) and S(E).

    Let's evaluate each statement:
    1. NDC S(E) <==> NDC V(r). Correct.
    2. Diagonal S(E) <==> Diagonal V(r). Correct.
    3. NDC V(r) <==> NDC F(E). Correct.
    4. NDC F(E) <==> NDC S(E). Correct.
    5. Exists NDC V(r) with diagonal F(E). This is a contradiction, as a diagonal F(E) implies a diagonalizable V(r). False.
