# Define the side length of the large square
square_side_length = 20.0

# 1. Calculate the radius (r) of the circles.
# The side length of the square is equal to 4 times the radius.
radius = square_side_length / 4.0

# 2. Calculate the side length of the inner square formed by the circle centers.
# This is equal to twice the radius (or one diameter).
inner_square_side = 2 * radius

# 3. Calculate the area of the inner square.
area_inner_square = inner_square_side ** 2

# 4. Calculate the area of the four quarter-circle sectors inside the inner square.
# This is equivalent to the area of one full circle.
area_of_circle_parts = math.pi * radius ** 2

# 5. Calculate the area of the region between the circles by subtracting
# the circle parts area from the inner square area.
area_between_circles = area_inner_square - area_of_circle_parts

# 6. Print the explanation and the step-by-step calculation.
