    This function explains the solution to the problem.

    The problem asks for the smallest constant z such that for any correlation matrix A,
    there exists a 'nice' matrix B (a matrix in the cut polytope) and a
    positive semidefinite (PSD) matrix C such that A = z*B - C.

    The condition A = z*B - C for a PSD matrix C is equivalent to the matrix
    inequality z*B >= A in the Loewner order.

    This problem is a well-known problem in matrix analysis and semidefinite
    programming. The value of this constant z is proven to be the Grothendieck's
    constant, K_G.

    The Grothendieck's constant K_G is a fundamental constant in mathematics,
    appearing in various fields like functional analysis and computer science.
    Its exact value is unknown, but it has famous bounds.
