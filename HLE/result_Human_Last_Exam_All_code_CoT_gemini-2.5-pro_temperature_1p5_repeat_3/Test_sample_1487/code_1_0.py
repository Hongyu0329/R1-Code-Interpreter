# Step 1: Formulate the squared norm of alpha, ||alpha||^2
# From the problem description and the Riesz Representation Theorem, we have:
# z(y) = (y, alpha)
# Given z(y_i) = 1/(i+1) and ||y_i||^2 = 2.
# This leads to (y_i, alpha) = 1/(i+1).
# We use the orthonormal basis e_i = y_i / sqrt(2). The Fourier coefficients of alpha are:
# c_i = (alpha, e_i) = (alpha, y_i/sqrt(2)) = (1/sqrt(2)) * (alpha, y_i)
# In a real Hilbert space, (alpha, y_i) = (y_i, alpha), so:
# c_i = (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/(i+1))
#
# By Parseval's identity, ||alpha||^2 is the sum of the squares of the Fourier coefficients.
# ||alpha||^2 = sum_{i=1 to inf} [ (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/(i+1)) ]^2
# ||alpha||^2 = sum_{i=1 to inf} (1/2) * 1/((i+1)^2)
# ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * sum_{j=2 to inf} 1/(j^2)  (where j = i+1)

# Step 2: Evaluate the infinite sum using the Basel problem result
# The Basel problem states: sum_{n=1 to inf} 1/n^2 = pi^2 / 6.
# Our sum is sum_{j=2 to inf} 1/(j^2) = (sum_{n=1 to inf} 1/n^2) - 1/1^2 = (pi^2 / 6) - 1.
# Therefore, ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * (pi^2 / 6 - 1).

# Let's represent this value symbolically in the code's logic.
# Define the value of pi^2/6 - 1 for demonstration.
pi_squared_over_6_minus_1 = (math.pi**2 / 6) - 1
norm_alpha_squared = 0.5 * pi_squared_over_6_minus_1

print(f"Based on the problem, the squared norm of alpha, ||\u03B1||^2, is derived to be (1/2) * (\u03C0^2/6 - 1).")
print(f"Numerically, (\u03C0^2/6 - 1) is approx. {pi_squared_over_6_minus_1}")
print(f"So, ||\u03B1||^2 is approx. {norm_alpha_squared}")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 3: Calculate the final expression
# The expression to calculate is: (2 * ||alpha||^2) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
# Substituting the expression for ||alpha||^2:
# (2 * (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1)) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
# The (pi^2/6 - 1) terms cancel out.
# = 1 + 10^15

print("The expression to evaluate is: 2 * ||\u03B1||^2 / (\u03C0^2/6 - 1) + 10^15")
print("Substituting ||\u03B1||^2 = (1/2) * (\u03C0^2/6 - 1), the expression becomes:")
print("= (2 * (1/2) * (\u03C0^2/6 - 1)) / (\u03C0^2/6 - 1) + 10^15")
print("= 1 + 10^15")
print("-" * 30)

# Final calculation
term1 = 1
term2 = int(10**15)
result = term1 + term2

# As requested, printing the final equation with all its numbers
print("The final equation is:")
print(f"{term1} + {term2} = {result}")
