    "To determine the product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde (also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal). Its structure is `(CH₃)₃C-CHO`. The reactive part is the carbonyl group (`C=O`).\n    *   **Wittig Reagent (Ylide):** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide with the structure `(Ph)₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)`, where Ph is a phenyl group and `(C₆H₄Cl)` is a 2-chlorophenyl group. The reactive part is the carbon doubly bonded to phosphorus.\n\n2.  **Understand the Wittig Reaction:**\n    The Wittig reaction is a powerful method for synthesizing alkenes. It involves the reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a phosphorus ylide. The oxygen atom of the carbonyl group is replaced by the carbanionic group of the ylide, forming a new carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C`) and triphenylphosphine oxide (`(Ph)₃P=O`) as a byproduct.\n\n3.  **Construct the Product:**\n    *   We take the alkyl part from the aldehyde: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=`\n    *   We take the alkyl part from the ylide: `=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)`\n    *   We combine these two fragments at the double bond.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)`\n\n4.  **Name the Product (IUPAC Nomenclature):**\n    *   Find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond. In this case, it is a 6-carbon chain (a hexene).\n    *   Number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number, which is 3 (hex-3-ene).\n    *   Numbering from the chlorophenyl-substituted end gives the lowest locants for the substituents.\n    *   The substituents are a `2-chlorophenyl` group at position 1, and two `methyl` groups at position 5.\n    *   Therefore, the final product name is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-5,5-dimethylhex-3-ene**.\n\nThe following Python code will print the full reaction equation and extract the numbers from the product's name as requested.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the product of a Wittig reaction and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
