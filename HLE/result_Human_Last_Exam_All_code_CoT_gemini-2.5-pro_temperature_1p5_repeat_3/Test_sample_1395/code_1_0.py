# Step 1: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian graph before 1991.
# A large political map, such as the map of Asia, is a planar graph.
# By the Four-Color Theorem, the chromatic number is at most 4.
# Due to its complexity, the Asian map required 4 colors.
chi_before = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian country graph before the Soviet dissolution was chi_before = {chi_before}.")

# Step 2: Determine the chromatic number after 1991.
# After the dissolution, new countries were formed. A new structure emerged where
# Uzbekistan is bordered by Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan.
# These neighbors form a 5-country cycle (an odd cycle).
# A country (hub) surrounded by an odd cycle of neighbors forms a wheel graph (W6)
# which is known to require 4 colors. Thus, the new map also requires 4 colors.
chi_after = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian country graph after the Soviet dissolution is chi_after = {chi_after}.")

# Step 3: Calculate the incremental change in the chromatic number.
delta_soviet = chi_after - chi_before
print(f"The incremental change is delta_soviet = {chi_after} - {chi_before} = {delta_soviet}.")

# Step 4: Determine the planarity change factor, beta.
# A map of countries is a planar graph. Subdividing a country (the USSR) into smaller
# countries does not change the planarity of the overall map graph.
# As the planarity did not change, beta is 1.
beta = 1
print(f"The dissolution event did not change the graph's planarity, so beta = {beta}.")

# Step 5: Calculate the final result.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final result is beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}.")
