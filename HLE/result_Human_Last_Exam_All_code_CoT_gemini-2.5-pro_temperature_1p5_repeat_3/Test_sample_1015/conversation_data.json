    "This is a knowledge-based question about ballet technique. I will provide a Python script that defines the question, the possible answers, and then explains the correct choice. The core difference lies in the anatomical approach to the movement, specifically regarding the alignment of the hips.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the question and the multiple-choice options within the script.\n2.  Identify the correct answer, which is 'B'.\n3.  Provide a detailed explanation for why 'B' is the correct answer. The Vaganova method insists on keeping the hips square to the front during a cambré derrière to maintain stability and a pure upper-body bend. In contrast, the Balanchine method allows the hip of the working leg to lift and open, creating a more dynamic and expansive line.\n4.  The script will print this explanation and then output the final answer in the required format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the differences between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods\n    for a cambré derrière and provides the correct answer from the given choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"What is the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods?\"\n    \n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Arm placement during allongé',\n        'B': 'Placement of hip',\n        'C': 'Speed',\n        'D': 'Degree of backbend',\n        'E': 'Placement of head'\n    }\n\n    correct_answer_key = 'B'\n    \n    explanation = (\n        \"The primary and most fundamental difference between a cambré derrière (a backward bend) \"\n        \"in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hips.\\n\\n\"\n        \"1.  **Vaganova Method:** This Russian method places a strong emphasis on maintaining a stable and square torso. \"\n        \"During a cambré derrière, the rule is to keep both hips perfectly aligned and facing forward.
