        "The primary and most fundamental difference between a cambré derrière (a backward bend) "
        "in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hips.\n\n"
        "1.  **Vaganova Method:** This Russian method places a strong emphasis on maintaining a stable and square torso. "
        "During a cambré derrière, the rule is to keep both hips perfectly aligned and facing forward. The bend originates from the upper and middle back, isolating the spine's movement while the hips provide a solid foundation.\n\n"
        "2.  **Balanchine Method:** This American neoclassical style prioritizes speed, length, and dynamic lines. "
        "In a Balanchine cambré derrière, the hip of the working/gesturing leg is allowed to lift and open slightly. "
        "This adjustment facilitates a deeper, more sweeping backbend and is a key stylistic element that creates the characteristic off-balance and expansive look of the Balanchine aesthetic.\n\n"
        "While other elements like speed (C), degree of backbend (D), and arm placement (A) can also differ, they are often consequences of the foundational difference in hip placement (B)."
