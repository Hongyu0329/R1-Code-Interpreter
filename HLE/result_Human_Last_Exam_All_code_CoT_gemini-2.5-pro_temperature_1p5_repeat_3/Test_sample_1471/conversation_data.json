    "Of course. Here is a plan to solve the equation, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\nFirst, I will decipher the Roman numerals in the equation and convert them to modern numbers:\n1.  `XXIV` corresponds to 24 (XX = 20, IV = 4).\n2.  `VIII` corresponds to 8 (V = 5, III = 3).\n3.  `MMCMXCIX` corresponds to 2999 (MM = 2000, CM = 900, XC = 90, IX = 9).\n\nThis translates the equation to `24 / 8 - 2999`.\n\nNext, I will solve this equation according to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), performing division before subtraction:\n1.  Divide 24 by 8, which equals 3.\n2.  Subtract 2999 from 3, which results in -2996.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs these calculations and prints the result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Assign the modern numerical values to variables.\nnum1 = 24\nnum2 = 8\nnum3 = 2999\n\n# Step 2: Perform the calculation following the order of operations.\n# Division is performed first, then subtraction.\nresult = (num1 / num2) - num3\n\n# Step 3: Print the equation with modern numbers and the final answer.\nprint(f\"The equation is: {num1} / {num2} - {num3}\")\nprint(f\"The solution is: {int(result)}\")\n```\n<<<-2996>>>"
