# Step 1: Assign the modern numerical values to variables.
num1 = 24
num2 = 8
num3 = 2999

# Step 2: Perform the calculation following the order of operations.
# Division is performed first, then subtraction.
result = (num1 / num2) - num3

# Step 3: Print the equation with modern numbers and the final answer.
print(f"The equation is: {num1} / {num2} - {num3}")
print(f"The solution is: {int(result)}")
