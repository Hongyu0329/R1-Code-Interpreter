    "To answer your question, I will use a Python script. The question asks for a specific anatomical fact about the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*. This information is found in paleontological literature describing its skull. The number of depressions in the lacrimal recess is a known value.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the number of depressions from established paleontological descriptions of *Irritator challengeri*. The holotype skull description indicates there are two.\n2.  Create a simple Python script that uses a basic addition equation to arrive at this number.\n3.  The script will then print out the full equation, showing how the result is reached, as requested.\n\n```python\n# The number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri is a known anatomical detail.\n# According to paleontological studies of the skull, this recess contains two large depressions.\n# This script will display this fact using a simple equation.\n\n# Define two numbers that will add up to the correct total.\nfirst_number = 1\nsecond_number = 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of depressions.\ntotal_depressions = first_number + second_number\n\n# Print the information and the resulting equation.\nprint(\"The number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri can be represented by the following equation:\")\nprint(f\"{first_number} + {second_number} = {total_depressions}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
