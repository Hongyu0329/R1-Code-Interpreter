    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Define Cellular Automaton Parameters:** I'll set up the simulation for 20 generations. The cells exist on a 1D grid, which I'll represent as a Python list. The grid needs to be wide enough to allow the pattern to expand without hitting the boundaries. A width of `(2 * generations) + a_bit_of_padding` is a safe choice.\n\n2.  **Implement Rule 110:** The state of a cell in the next generation is determined by its current state and the state of its left and right neighbors. The rule number 110 in binary is `01101110`. I'll create a mapping (like a dictionary) that translates each of the 8 possible 3-cell binary patterns (from `111` down to `000`) to its corresponding output from the rule's binary string.\n\n3.  **Initialize the Grid:** I will create a list of cells, initially all in state `0`, and then set the single center cell to state `1` as per the problem description.\n\n4.  **Run the Simulation Loop:** I will iterate 20 times. In each iteration, I will compute the next state for every cell based on its neighborhood and Rule 110, storing the results in a new list. Once all new states are computed, this new list becomes the current grid for the next iteration.\n\n5.  **Format the Output:** After 20 generations, I will convert the final list of cell states into a single binary string. To present the result cleanly, I will trim the unnecessary leading and trailing zeros from the string. Finally, I will print this pattern as the answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef simulate_rule_110():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates the cellular automaton Rule 110 for 20 generations,\n    starting from a single active cell, and prints the final binary pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
