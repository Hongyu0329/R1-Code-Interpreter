# Step 1: Define the number of geometric isomers for a [M(AA)2(BC)] complex.
# For an octahedral complex with two identical symmetric bidentate ligands (AA)
# and one asymmetric bidentate ligand (BC), there are 3 possible geometric isomers.
num_geometric_isomers = 3

# Step 2: Define the number of stereoisomers for each chiral geometric isomer.
# Each of the 3 geometric isomers is chiral (lacks a plane of symmetry),
# so each exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).
enantiomers_per_geometric_isomer = 2

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of isomers.
total_isomers = num_geometric_isomers * enantiomers_per_geometric_isomer

# Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final calculation.
