    # Q6, Q7, Q9: These inequalities appear to stem from a common constructive proof,
    # where Q6 and Q7 are instances of the general formula in Q9 for d=3 and d=4.
    # Q8: This statement contradicts the formula in Q9 for d=5 and the likely infinite nature of a(n).

    # the only available sums for the next number are 1 and 2. It is impossible to place a '3'.

# The instruction "output each number in the final equation" seems not applicable as there are no equations to solve for a variable, but inequalities and function evaluations.
# The numbers in the inequalities are implicitly handled by the Yes/No answers. For example, answering "Yes" to "a(n) >= 9n-8" confirms the validity of the relationship involving 9 and 8.
