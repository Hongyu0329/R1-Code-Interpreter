    "To find the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a series of steps to identify the group structure.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility:** First, we'll determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is a prerequisite for the Galois group to be a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. We will use Eisenstein's criterion.\n2.  **Compute the Discriminant ($\\Delta$):** The discriminant helps narrow down the possible Galois groups. If $\\Delta$ is a perfect square of a rational number, the group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n3.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic:** The properties of a related cubic polynomial, the resolvent cubic, will further restrict the possibilities. Specifically, we'll check if it's reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n4.  **Distinguish Remaining Possibilities:** Based on the results from the discriminant and the resolvent cubic, we'll be left with a few possible groups. A final criterion, checking for the reducibility of the original polynomial over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, will allow us to pinpoint the exact Galois group.\n5.  **Determine the Order:** Once the group is identified, its order is known.\n\nThe following Python script will carry out these calculations step-by-step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to get all integer divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    n = abs(n)\n    divs = {1, -1, n, -n}\n    for i in range(2, math.isqrt(n) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(-i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n            divs.add(-(n // i))\n    return list(divs)\n\ndef find_integer_root(coeffs):\n    \"\"\"Finds an integer root of a polynomial with integer coefficients.\"\"\"\n    # From the Rational Root Theorem, any integer root must divide the constant term.\n    constant_term = coeffs[-1]\n    if constant_term == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    for root in sorted(get_divisors(constant_term)):\n        # Test if root is a solution\n        val = sum(c * (root**i) for i, c in enumerate(reversed(coeffs)))\n        if val == 0:\n            return root\n    return None\n\ndef compute_galois_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the polynomial x^4 + px + q\n    p = 8\n    q = 14\n    print(f\"Analyzing the Galois group for f(x) = x^4 + {p}x + {q}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Check for irreducibility\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Irreducibility over Q ---\")\n    print(\"Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p=2:\")\n    print(\"  - p=2 divides the non-leading coefficients 0, 0, 8, 14.\")\n    print(\"  - p=2 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\")\n    print(\"  - p^2=4 does not divide the constant term 14.\")\n    print(\"The polynomial is irreducible over Q.
