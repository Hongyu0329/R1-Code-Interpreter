            "explanation": "Magnesium functions as a natural calcium channel blocker. Calcium is necessary for muscle contraction. By blocking calcium's entry into the smooth muscle cells of blood vessel walls, magnesium promotes muscle relaxation. This relaxation widens the blood vessels (vasodilation), which in turn reduces peripheral resistance and lowers blood pressure."

            "text": "By protecting elastic fibers from calcium deposition",
            "is_correct": False,
            "explanation": "While magnesium helps regulate the body's use of calcium and may prevent ectopic calcification (like in arteries), this is considered a secondary or long-term benefit, not the primary, direct mechanism for acute blood pressure reduction."
        },

            "text": "It raises systemic blood calcium levels",
            "is_correct": False,
            "explanation": "This is the opposite of magnesium's effect at the cellular level. Magnesium is a calcium antagonist, meaning it competes with calcium. It does not raise systemic blood calcium levels; it modulates calcium's effects."
