    "Of the 17 wallpaper groups, we need to identify those whose corresponding point group has an order of 2. The order of a group is the number of its elements (i.e., the number of symmetry operations). A point group of order 2 has two symmetry operations: the identity and either a single 180-degree rotation (a 2-fold rotation) or a single reflection.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Create a data structure (a Python dictionary) that maps each of the 17 wallpaper group names to the order of its point group.\n2.  Iterate through this data.\n3.  Identify and collect the names of the wallpaper groups where the point group order is exactly 2.\n4.  Print the names of the groups found.\n5.  Construct and print an equation that sums up the count of these groups to find the total.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and counts the wallpaper groups that have a point group of a specific order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The 17 wallpaper groups and the order of their corresponding point groups.\n    # Data is represented as a dictionary where the key is the group's IUC notation\n    # and the value is the order of its point group.\n    wallpaper_group_data = {\n        'p1': 1,   # Point group 1 (C1)\n        'p2': 2,   # Point group 2 (C2)\n        'pm': 2,   # Point group m (Cs)\n        'pg': 2,   # Point group m (Cs)\n        'cm': 2,   # Point group m (Cs)\n        'pmm': 4,  # Point group 2mm (D2)\n        'pmg': 4,  # Point group 2mm (D2)\n        'pgg': 4,  # Point group 2mm (D2)\n        'cmm': 4,  # Point group 2mm (D2)\n        'p4': 4,   # Point group 4 (C4)\n        'p4m': 8,  # Point group 4mm (D4)\n        'p4g': 8,  # Point group 4mm (D4)\n        'p3': 3,   # Point group 3 (C3)\n        'p3m1': 6, # Point group 3m (D3)\n        'p31m': 6, # Point group 3m (D3)\n        'p6': 6,   # Point group 6 (C6)\n        'p6m': 12  # Point group 6mm (D6)\n    }\n\n    target_order = 2\n    found_groups = []\n\n    # Find all groups with a point group of the target order\n    for group_name, order in wallpaper_group_data.items():\n        if order == target_order:\n            found_groups.append(group_name)\n    \n    # Sort the list alphabetically for consistent output\n    found_groups.sort()\n\n    print(f\"The wallpaper groups with a point group of order {target_order} are:\")\n    for group in found_groups:\n        print(f\"- {group}\")\n\n    total_count = len(found_groups)\n    \n    if total_count > 0:\n        # Create the equation string, e.g., \"1 + 1 + 1 + 1\"\n        equation = \" + \".join([\"1\"] * total_count)\n        print(f\"\\nThe total number is calculated as: {equation} = {total_count}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nNo such groups found.\")\n\ncount_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
