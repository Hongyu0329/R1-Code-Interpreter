    "My plan is to determine the symmetry point group of the molecule from its SMILES string by following these steps:\n\n1.  **Parse the SMILES String**: First, I'll use the RDKit library to interpret the provided SMILES string (`C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67`) and create a molecular object. This molecule is a large, propeller-shaped aromatic system with three symmetrically placed ethynyl substituents.\n\n2.  **Generate a 3D Structure**: To analyze symmetry, a 3D representation is essential. I will generate a 3D conformation of the molecule and then use the Universal Force Field (UFF) to optimize its geometry. This process will yield a realistic low-energy structure. Given the molecule's extensive pi-conjugated system, the optimized structure is expected to be planar.\n\n3.  **Analyze Symmetry**: With the 3D coordinates, I will use the PySCF library, a powerful tool for computational chemistry, to analyze the molecular structure. Its symmetry detection function can identify all the symmetry elements and determine the corresponding point group.\n\n4.  **Present the Result**: The final script will print the name of the determined point group. I expect the result to be D3h, reflecting the molecule's high symmetry with a principal C3 rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport warnings\n\ndef find_molecule_point_group(smiles_string: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a SMILES string, generates a 3D structure,\n    and determines its symmetry point group.\n    \n    The process involves:\n    1.
