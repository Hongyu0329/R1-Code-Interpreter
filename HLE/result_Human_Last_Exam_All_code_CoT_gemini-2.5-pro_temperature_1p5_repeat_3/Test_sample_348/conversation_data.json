    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Find Market Equilibrium**: First, I need to find the point where the supply and demand curves intersect. This is the market equilibrium point ($Q_E$, $P_E$), which occurs when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded ($Q_S = Q_D = Q_E$) and the price is the same. I will find the equilibrium quantity $Q_E$ by numerically solving the equation $\\ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18e^{-\\arctan(Q)}$. I will use Python's `scipy.optimize.fsolve` for this. Once $Q_E$ is found, I will calculate the equilibrium price $P_E$ by substituting $Q_E$ into either the supply or demand function.\n\n2.  **Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS)**: Consumer surplus is the economic benefit to consumers. It is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price, from $Q=0$ to $Q=Q_E$. The formula is:\n    $CS = \\int_{0}^{Q_E} P_{Demand}(Q) dQ - (P_E \\times Q_E)$\n\n3.  **Calculate Producer Surplus (PS)**: Producer surplus is the economic benefit to producers. It is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price. The supply function $P = \\ln(Q^3 - 2)$ yields a non-negative price only when $Q^3-2 \\ge 1$, which means $Q \\ge \\sqrt[3]{3}$. Therefore, the integration for producer surplus starts from $Q = \\sqrt[3]{3}$. The formula is:\n    $PS = (P_E \\times Q_E) - \\int_{\\sqrt[3]{3}}^{Q_E} P_{Supply}(Q) dQ$\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Welfare**: The total welfare is simply the sum of the consumer surplus and the producer surplus.\n    $Total\\ Welfare = CS + PS$\n\nSince the integrals are complex to solve analytically, I will use numerical integration with Python's `scipy.integrate.quad` function to find the values for CS and PS. The final script will print out all the calculated values for each step.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the total welfare at market equilibrium given\n    supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the demand function P = 18 * exp(-arctan(Q))\n    def demand_p(q):\n        return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(q))\n\n    # Define the supply function P = ln(Q^3 - 2)\n    def supply_p(q):\n        # The function is defined for Q > cbrt(2).
