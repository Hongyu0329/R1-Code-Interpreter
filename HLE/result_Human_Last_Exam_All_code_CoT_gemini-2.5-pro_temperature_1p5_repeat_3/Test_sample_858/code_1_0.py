# The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of the set of non-block points
# in an aposyndetic continuum.

# Let's break down the reasoning.
# 1. We consider the simplest possible continuum: a single-point space, let's call it X = {p}.
#    - A single-point space is compact, connected, and Hausdorff, so it is a continuum.
#    - A space is aposyndetic if for any two distinct points x and y, a certain property holds.
#      Since X = {p} does not have two distinct points, this condition is vacuously true. So, X is aposyndetic.

# 2. Now, let's find the set of non-block points of X = {p}.
#    - A point q is a non-block point if X \ {q} contains a dense, continuum-connected subset.
#    - The only point to check is p. Is p a non-block point?
#    - We look at the set X \ {p}, which is the empty set (âˆ…).
#    - Does the empty set contain a dense, continuum-connected subset?
#    - The only subset of the empty set is the empty set itself.
#    - Is the empty set dense in the empty set? Yes, the closure of the empty set is itself.
#    - Is the empty set continuum-connected? The condition is "for any x, y in the set...", which is
#      vacuously true for the empty set. So yes, it is continuum-connected.

# 3. So, the point p is a non-block point.
#    - The set of non-block points of X is {p}.
#    - The cardinality of this set is 1.

# 4. Can the cardinality be smaller?
#    - The cardinality cannot be 0. Known theorems state that the set of non-block points
#      in an aposyndetic continuum is non-empty.

# 5. Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality is 1.
