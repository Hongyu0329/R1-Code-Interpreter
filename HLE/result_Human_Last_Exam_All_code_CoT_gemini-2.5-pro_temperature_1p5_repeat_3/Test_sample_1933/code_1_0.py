    # The problem asks for the VC dimension of the set of classifiers defined by
    # formulas in the first-order logic fragment FO_{exists, land, T, bot}[S].

    # Step 1: Characterize the class of classifiers (the hypothesis space).
    # The allowed logical operators are existential quantification (exists), conjunction (land),
    # true (T), and false (bot).
    # The schema S has 4 unary predicates: P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x).
    # A classifier is a formula phi(x) with one free variable x.
    # Any subformula that does not contain the free variable x, such as `exists y (P_i(y))`,
    # is a sentence whose truth value is constant over the entire domain.
    # We can replace such subformulas with T or bot.
    # Therefore, any formula in this fragment is equivalent to either bot (the always-false classifier)
    # or a formula of the form:
    # C_I(x) = P_{i_1}(x) AND P_{i_2}(x) AND ... AND P_{i_k}(x)
    # where {i_1, ..., i_k} is a subset I of {1, 2, 3, 4}.
    # These formulas are known as "monotone conjunctions".
    # The case I = {} is an empty conjunction, which is equivalent to T (the always-true classifier).

    # Step 2: Find the VC dimension of this hypothesis space.
    # We need to find the VC dimension of the class of monotone conjunctions over d variables.
    # A known theorem in computational learning theory states that the VC dimension of the class
    # of monotone conjunctions over d variables is exactly d.

    # Step 3: Apply the theorem to our specific case.
    # In this problem, the number of unary predicates corresponds to the number of variables, d.
    vc_dimension = d

    # Final equation: VC dimension = d
    print("The number of unary predicates is d = {}".format(d))
    print("The VC dimension of the class of monotone conjunctions over d variables is d.")
    print("Therefore, the VC dimension of FO_{exists, land, T, bot}[S] is {}.".format(vc_dimension))
    print("Final equation: VC dimension = {}".format(d))
