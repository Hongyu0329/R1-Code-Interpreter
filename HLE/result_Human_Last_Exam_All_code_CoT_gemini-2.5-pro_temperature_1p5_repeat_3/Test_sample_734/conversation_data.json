    "This is a knowledge-based question rather than a coding task. The most suitable theologian who fits this description is Augustine of Hippo. He developed the concept of *rationes seminales* (seminal reasons) to explain how God could bring about events like the virgin birth, or changes in nature after the Fall, not by violating the created order, but by activating latent potentialities that He had already embedded within creation from the beginning.\n\nI will provide the answer in a Python script as requested by the prompt format.
