    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\nThe problem asks for the value of `a(3)`, where `a(n)` represents the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n` for certain processes in quantum electrodynamics. This number corresponds to the number of connected chord diagrams with `2n` points.\n\nThese numbers can be calculated using the following recurrence relation, which connects `a(n)` with the total number of chord diagrams, given by the double factorial `(2n-1)!!`:\n\n`a(n) = (2n-1)!! - Î£_{k=1}^{n-1} a(k) * (2(n-k)-1)!!`\n\nI will use this formula to find `a(3)` by first calculating `a(1)` and `a(2)`:\n\n1.  **Calculate a(1):**\n    `a(1) = (2*1 - 1)!! = 1!! = 1`\n\n2.  **Calculate a(2):**\n    `a(2) = (2*2 - 1)!! - a(1) * (2*(2-1) - 1)!! = 3!! - a(1) * 1!!`\n    `a(2) = 3 - 1 * 1 = 2`\n\n3.  **Calculate a(3):**\n    `a(3) = (2*3 - 1)!! - [a(1) * (2*(3-1) - 1)!! + a(2) * (2*(3-2) - 1)!!]`\n    `a(3) = 5!! - [a(1) * 3!! + a(2) * 1!!]`\n    `a(3) = 15 - [1 * 3 + 2 * 1] = 10`\n\nThe Python code below will perform these calculations and print the final equation with all the numerical values, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef double_factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the double factorial (n!!).\n    Example: 5!! = 5 * 3 * 1 = 15\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return 0\n    if n == 0 or n == -1:\n        return 1\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(n, 0, -2):\n        result *= i\n    return result\n\n# The task is to find a(3). We need a(1) and a(2) first.\n# The recurrence relation is: a(n) = (2n-1)!! - sum_{k=1}^{n-1} a(k) * (2(n-k)-1)!!\n\n# 1. Calculate a(1)\n# a(1) = (2*1-1)!! = 1!!\na1 = double_factorial(1)\n\n# 2. Calculate a(2)\n# a(2) = (2*2-1)!! - a(1)*(2*(2-1)-1)!! = 3!! - a(1)*1!!\ndf_3 = double_factorial(3)\ndf_1 = double_factorial(1)\na2 = df_3 - (a1 * df_1)\n\n# 3. Calculate a(3)\n# a(3) = (2*3-1)!! - (a(1)*(2*(3-1)-1)!! + a(2)*(2*(3-2)-1)!!)\n# a(3) = 5!! - (a(1)*3!! + a(2)*1!!)\ndf_5 = double_factorial(5)\nsum_term = (a1 * df_3) + (a2 * df_1)\na3 = df_5 - sum_term\n\n# Print the final equation with all numbers substituted, as requested.\nprint(\"To find a(3), we calculate the following equation:\")\nprint(f\"a(3) = {df_5} - ({a1} * {df_3} + {a2} * {df_1})\")\nprint(f\"The result is: {a3}\")\n```\n<<<10>>>"
