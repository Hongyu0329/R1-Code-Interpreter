# Ontology O1 has a branching factor b=3 and depth d=4.
# The core of the problem is the "mergeable sibling classes" constraint in O1,
# which causes a loss of structural information when mapping to the strict
# hierarchy of O2.

# Statement D provides a formula based on information theory to model this limitation.
# The completeness is bounded by the average information content that can be
# preserved across the hierarchy.

# Parameters from the problem description
b = 3  # Branching factor
d = 4  # Depth

# Statement D suggests the theoretical completeness is bounded by the formula: ln(b) / d.
# We will calculate this bound.

# Perform the calculation
# ln(b) is the information content (in nats) at a single branching point.
# Dividing by d averages this over the depth of the ontology.
log_b = math.log(b)
completeness_bound = log_b / d
