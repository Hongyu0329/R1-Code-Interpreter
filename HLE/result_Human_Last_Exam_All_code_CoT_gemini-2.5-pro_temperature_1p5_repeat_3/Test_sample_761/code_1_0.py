    print("   - Monomer (Building Block): Monosaccharide (a simple sugar like glucose).")

    print("   - A Nucleotide itself has 3 components: a Phosphate group, a Pentose (5-carbon) Sugar, and a Nitrogenous Base.")
    print("   - Backbone: A chain of alternating Sugar and Phosphate groups.")

    print("  - Different Elemental Composition: The presence of phosphorus and nitrogen in polynucleotides is a critical distinction.")
