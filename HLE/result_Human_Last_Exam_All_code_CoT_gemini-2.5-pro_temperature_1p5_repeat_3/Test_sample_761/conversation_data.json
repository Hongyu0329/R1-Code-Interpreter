    "This is a conceptual question from biology/chemistry. I will provide a Python script that explains the fundamental structural differences between polysaccharides and polynucleotides to arrive at the answer. The script will print out the definitions, key components, and a direct comparison of both molecule types.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Define the structural components of a polysaccharide, focusing on its monomer (monosaccharide), backbone bond (glycosidic bond), and elemental composition.\n2.  Define the structural components of a polynucleotide, highlighting its more complex monomer (nucleotide), its backbone structure (sugar-phosphate), the linking bond (phosphodiester bond), and its unique elemental composition (including phosphorus and nitrogen).\n3.  Directly compare these features to show they are fundamentally different.\n4.  Conclude with a clear answer to the user's question based on this comparison.\n\n```python\ndef explain_structures():\n    \"\"\"\n    Compares the structures of polysaccharides and polynucleotides to answer\n    if one is a type of the other.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Analyzing the structures of Polysaccharides and Polynucleotides ---\\n\")\n\n    # Part 1: Polysaccharides\n    print(\"1.
