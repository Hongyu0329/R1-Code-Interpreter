    This class is designed to find the number of valid crossword puzzle grids for a given size.
    It uses a recursive backtracking search to explore all possible grid patterns that satisfy
    180-degree rotational symmetry. Each complete grid is then validated against a set of
    standard crossword construction rules.

    The rules are:
    1. 180-degree rotational symmetry.
    2. Minimum word length of 3 (no runs of 1 or 2 white squares).
    3. Full interconnectivity of all white squares.
    4. No "cheater" squares (interpreted as no 2x2 blocks of black squares).
