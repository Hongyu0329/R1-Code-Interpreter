    "To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** Toluene consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Understand the 6-31G basis set:** This is a split-valence basis set. We need to determine how many functions it assigns to each type of atom.\n    *   **For each Hydrogen atom (H):** It has one valence 's' orbital. The 6-31G basis set \"splits\" this valence orbital into two functions (an inner and an outer part). So, each H atom has 2 basis functions.\n    *   **For each Carbon atom (C):** It has core (1s) and valence (2s, 2p) orbitals.\n        *   The core '1s' orbital is represented by a single contracted function.\n        *   The valence '2s' orbital is split into two functions (inner and outer).\n        *   The three valence '2p' orbitals (px, py, pz) are also each split into two functions, for a total of 3 * 2 = 6 functions.\n        *   Total for each C atom = 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 6 (for 2p) = 9 basis functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** We multiply the number of each type of atom by the number of basis functions it has and sum the results.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon = 7\nnum_hydrogen = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions for each atom in a 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1s(core) + 2s(valence-inner) + 2s(valence-outer) + 2p(valence-inner)x3 + 2p(valence-outer)x3 = 1+1+1+3+3 = 9\n# A simpler way: 1 core function + 4 valence functions (s, px, py, pz) * 2 (for the split) = 1 + 8 = 9\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n\n# For Hydrogen (H): 1s(valence-inner) + 1s(valence-outer) = 1 + 1 = 2\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of basis functions\ntotal_functions = (num_carbon * functions_per_carbon) + (num_hydrogen * functions_per_hydrogen)\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result\nprint(\"Calculation for Toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"Number of Carbon atoms: {num_carbon}\")\nprint(f\"Number of Hydrogen atoms: {num_hydrogen}\")\nprint(f\"Basis functions per Carbon atom: {functions_per_carbon}\")\nprint(f\"Basis functions per Hydrogen atom: {functions_per_hydrogen}\")\nprint(\"\\nTotal contracted Gaussian functions = (C atoms * functions/C) + (H atoms * functions/H)\")\nprint(f\"Total = ({num_carbon} * {functions_per_carbon}) + ({num_hydrogen} * {functions_per_hydrogen}) = {total_functions}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
