    # The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of the set of non-coastal points
    # in a hereditarily decomposable continuum. Let this set be NC(X).

    # According to a theorem by J. J. Charatonik, for a hereditarily decomposable continuum X,
    # the set of coastal points is precisely the set of points where X is 'connected im kleinen' (c.i.k.).
    # This means the set of non-coastal points, NC(X), is the set of points where X is *not* c.i.k.

    # The question is thus equivalent to finding the maximum possible cardinality of the set of non-c.i.k. points.

    # In 1970, Howard Cook constructed an example of a hereditarily decomposable continuum X
    # where the space is not c.i.k. at *any* of its points. For this continuum, the set of
    # non-c.i.k. points is the entire space X.

    # Any non-degenerate metric continuum (like Cook's example) has the cardinality of the
    # continuum, which is denoted by 'c'.

    # The value of 'c' is given by the equation c = 2^{\aleph_0} (2 to the power of aleph-null).
    # We will now print the numbers involved in this equation.
    base = 2
    aleph_index = 0

    print("The largest possible cardinality is 'c', the power of the continuum.")
    print("This value is described by the equation: c = 2^aleph_0.")
    print("The numbers in this final equation are:")
    print(f"The base of the power: {base}")
    print(f"The index of the aleph number in the exponent: {aleph_index}")
