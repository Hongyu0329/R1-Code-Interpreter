# Step 1: Identify the donor atoms from the ligand.
# The ligand, 1,3-Di[3-(2â€™-pyridyl)pyrazol-1-ylmethyl]-2,4,6-triethylbenzene,
# has two arms, each containing one pyridine ring and one pyrazole ring.
# Each pyridine ring provides one coordinating nitrogen atom.
# Each pyrazole ring provides one coordinating nitrogen atom (the other is blocked).
# Total nitrogen donors from the ligand = 2 * (1 from pyridine + 1 from pyrazole) = 4.
ligand_donors = ['N', 'N', 'N', 'N']

# Step 2: Identify the potential ligands from the metal salt.
# The salt is ZnBr2. It provides the Zn(II) metal center and two bromide ions.
# Bromide ions can coordinate to the metal.
salt_donors = ['Br', 'Br']

# Step 3: Determine the final coordination sphere.
# Zinc(II) commonly forms 6-coordinate complexes when enough ligands are available.
# The tetradentate (N4) ligand and the two bromide ligands combine to form a stable,
# neutral, 6-coordinate complex.
# The coordination sphere is the sum of all coordinated atoms.
final_coordination = ligand_donors + salt_donors

# Step 4: Print the result.
# We present the atoms in the final coordination sphere.
print("The atoms coordinated to the Zn center are:")
print(', '.join(final_coordination))
