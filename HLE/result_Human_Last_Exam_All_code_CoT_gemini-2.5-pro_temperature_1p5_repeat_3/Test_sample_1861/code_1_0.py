    Analyzes the properties of a 1-form on different 2-manifolds.

    Let M be a 2-dimensional orientable manifold (2-torus, cylinder, or plane).
    Let eta be a 1-form on M.
    The key property is that the group of symmetries of eta acts transitively on M.
    This means for any two points x, y in M, there is a diffeomorphism F such that F(x) = y and F*(eta) = eta.
    The question is about when this implies d(eta) = 0.

    1. The condition F*(eta) = eta implies F*(d(eta)) = d(eta). The 2-form d(eta) is also invariant.
    2. In terms of infinitesimal symmetries (vector fields X in a Lie algebra g), this means the Lie derivative L_X(eta) = 0.
    3. Cartan's formula is L_X(eta) = d(i_X(eta)) + i_X(d(eta)).
    4. Since L_X(eta) = 0, we have i_X(d(eta)) = -d(i_X(eta)). This means the 1-form i_X(d(eta)) must be exact for any X in the symmetry algebra g.
    5. An exact form has a vanishing de Rham cohomology class: [i_X(d(eta))] = 0 in H^1_dR(M).

    6. We now analyze the cohomology of the given manifolds:
       - Torus (T^2): H^1_dR(T^2) is R^2. It's non-trivial.
       - Cylinder (S^1 x R): H^1_dR(S^1 x R) is R. It's non-trivial.
       - Plane (R^2): H^1_dR(R^2) is {0}. It's trivial.

    7. A known theorem in geometry states that for a manifold M with non-trivial H^1_dR(M), if a 1-form eta has a transitive symmetry group, then it must be closed (d(eta) = 0).
       The proof relies on showing that the transitivity of the symmetry algebra g would contradict the existence of non-exact closed 1-forms if d(eta) were not zero.

    8. Applying this theorem:
       - For the Torus, H^1 is non-trivial, so it is necessary that d(eta) = 0.
       - For the Cylinder, H^1 is non-trivial, so it is necessary that d(eta) = 0.
       - For the Plane, H^1 is trivial. The theorem does not apply and does not force d(eta) = 0. It is possible to construct counter-examples where d(eta) is not 0.

    9. Let's evaluate the answer choices:
       A. "Only if M is the 2-torus, is it necessarily the case that d(eta) = 0". False, it's also necessary for the cylinder.
       B. "It is necessary in any case that d(eta) = 0". False, not for the plane.
       C. "If M is the cylinder R x S^1, then d(eta) = 0". True.
       D. "If M is R^2, then necessarily d(eta) = 0". False.
       E. "It is impossible that M = R^2". False.

    Therefore, the only correct statement is C.
