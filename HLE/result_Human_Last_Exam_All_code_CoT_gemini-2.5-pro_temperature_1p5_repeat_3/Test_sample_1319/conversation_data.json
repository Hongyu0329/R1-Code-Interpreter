    "To determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* besides Mount Olympus, we first need to identify the relevant mountains. The most prominent ones are Mount Ida (near Troy), Mount Samothrace, Mount Athos, and Mount Pelion.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Create a Python dictionary containing the names of these mountains as keys and their respective elevations in meters as values.\n2.  Iterate through this dictionary to find the mountain with the highest elevation.\n3.  Print the comparison of all mountains and announce the tallest one.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform this task.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, excluding Mount Olympus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dictionary of mountains from the Iliad (excluding Olympus) and their elevations in meters.\n    # These are the actual historical mountains.\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Ida\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Samothrace\": 1611,\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Pelion\": 1624\n    }\n\n    # Find the mountain with the maximum elevation\n    tallest_mountain_name = max(mountains, key=mountains.get)\n    tallest_mountain_height = mountains[tallest_mountain_name]\n\n    print(\"Comparing the elevations of historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad (besides Olympus):\")\n    \n    # \"Equation\" part: Printing each mountain and its height\n    for name, height in mountains.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {height} meters\")\n\n    print(\"\\nBased on the data, the tallest mountain is:\")\n    print(f\"{tallest_mountain_name} at {tallest_mountain_height} meters.\")\n\nfind_tallest_mountain()\n```\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
