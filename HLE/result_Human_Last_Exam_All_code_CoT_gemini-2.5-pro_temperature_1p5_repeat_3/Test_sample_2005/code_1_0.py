print(f"1. A direct change of +{change_needed}. Since a move consists of ±1 changes, this requires two '+1' elementary operations.")
print(f"2. A change of -1. Since {start_coord_val} - 1 = -1, which is equivalent to {end_coord_val} (mod {side_length_n}). This requires one '-1' elementary operation.")

print("For M to be an integer, (14 - k) must be an even number. This implies that 'k' must be even.")
