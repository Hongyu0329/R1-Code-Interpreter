    This script addresses question B, analyzing the feasibility of a specific program
    on the described toy computer architecture.

    Question B: Suppose (R,A,W)=(64,64,512). Does there exist a program L of length
    <= 2^32+50 such that, for all x in [0, 2^32), L on (R,A,W) maps x to x and halts
    in <= x+50 many steps?

    Our plan is to construct such a program L conceptually and verify its properties.
    The program will consist of three parts:
    1. A short setup code block.
    2. A very long chain of 2^32 'BOOP' instructions.
    3. A final 'HALT' instruction.

    The setup code's purpose is to perform a computed jump. It will:
    a. Calculate a target address to jump to based on the input x. The target will be
       the (2^32 - x)-th BOOP in the chain.
    b. Create a 'BRANCHIFZERO' instruction with this target address.
    c. Store this new instruction into memory right ahead of the program counter.
    d. Execute the newly created jump.

    This will cause the machine to execute exactly x 'BOOP's and then the final 'HALT'.
    We will now calculate the program length and execution time to verify they meet
    the given constraints.

    # Input x is in range [0, 2^32)
    max_x = 2**32

    # --- Program L Layout ---
    # We design the program L to have a setup block, a jump slot,
    # the BOOP chain, and a HALT.
    # The setup block will contain logic and data constants.
    # Let's estimate the size of the setup block.
    #
    # The setup code needs to:
    # 1. Jump over its own data constants. (1 instruction)
    # 2. Store 3 constants (for C, 1, and the branch opcode mask). (3 words)
    # 3. Load the 3 constants into registers. (3 instructions)
    # 4. Compute -x. (2 instructions: BITWISENAND, ADD)
    # 5. Compute target address. (1 instruction: ADD)
    # 6. Assemble the final branch instruction. (1 instruction: ADD)
    # 7. Store the new branch instruction into a jump slot. (1 instruction)
    # 8. A placeholder for the jump slot itself. (1 word)

    # This is the 9 instructions of logic, plus the jump over data.
    # [Jump over data (1), LOADs (3), ALU ops (4), STORE (1)]
