    # Part 1: Mark's Liability (Lawnmower in the Pool)
    print("\n1. Analyzing the incident with Mark and the lawnmower:")
    print("  - Mark was an employee acting within the scope of his employment when the incident occurred.")
    print("  - His actions (getting distracted, playing with a dog while operating machinery) were negligent.")
    print("  - This negligence directly caused the damage to the pool cover and the costs associated with the lawnmower in the pool.")
    print("  - Under the principle of vicarious liability, an employer (Evergreen) is liable for the negligent acts of its employees committed during their employment.")
    print("  - Therefore, both Mark (for his own negligence) and Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. (vicariously) are jointly and severally liable for the pool-related damages.")
    print("  - The neighbours' short fence is likely too remote a factor to be a proximate cause, making their liability highly unlikely.")
    
    print("-" * 60)

    # Part 2: Lincoln's Liability (Scratched Ferrari)
    print("\n2. Analyzing the incident with Lincoln and the Ferrari:")
    print("  - Lincoln was also an employee acting within the scope of his employment.")
    print("  - He used a blower near rocks and a car, an action that a reasonable person would know could cause damage. This constitutes negligence.")
    print("  - The fact that the scratches were 'small' or 'barely noticeable' affects the amount of damages owed, but it does not eliminate liability itself. Damage occurred, so liability exists.")
    print("  - Just as with Mark, Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. is vicariously liable for the damages caused by its employee, Lincoln.")
    print("  - Therefore, both Lincoln and Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. are jointly and severally liable for the damage to the car.")

    print("-" * 60)

    # Part 3: Conclusion
    print("\n3. Evaluating the answer choices:")
    print("  - Based on the analysis, the liability for each event is separate.")
    print("  - For the pool damage: Mark and Evergreen are jointly and severally liable.")
    print("  - For the car damage: Lincoln and Evergreen are jointly and severally liable.")
    print("  - This conclusion directly matches the description in answer choice E.")
