    "Of course. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a measure of the variation in time between consecutive heartbeats. This value is crucial for understanding the state of the autonomic nervous system.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the specific physiological term for the time duration between individual heartbeats.\n2.  Create a simple Python script that defines and prints this term to directly answer your question.\n\n```python\ndef find_hrv_value_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the term for the value computed\n    between heartbeats for HRV analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The term for the interval between successive R-peaks (heartbeats)\n    # is the \"R-R interval\". It's the fundamental unit for calculating HRV.\n    term = \"R-R interval\"\n    \n    # Another common name for this value is the \"inter-beat interval\" or IBI.\n    alternative_term = \"inter-beat interval (IBI)\"\n    \n    print(f\"The value representing the time between consecutive heartbeats, used to compute HRV, is called the '{term}'.\")\n    print(f\"It is also commonly referred to as the '{alternative_term}'.\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer\nfind_hrv_value_name()\n```\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
