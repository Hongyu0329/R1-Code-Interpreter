    This function explains the reasoning and prints the final answer for the maximal genus problem.

    The problem asks for the maximal genus of a smooth, compact, connected boundary surface
    of a region in R^3, given that its mean curvature vector never vanishes.

    Step 1: The mean curvature H is a continuous function on a compact connected surface.
    If H is never zero, it must have a constant sign (either H > 0 or H < 0 everywhere).
    Otherwise, the Intermediate Value Theorem would imply H=0 somewhere.

    Step 2: Let's consider the outward normal. At any point where the surface touches the
    boundary of its convex hull, the mean curvature H must be non-negative (H >= 0).
    Since H is never zero, H must be strictly positive at these points.

    Step 3: Combining Step 1 and 2, the mean curvature H must be strictly positive everywhere (H > 0).

    Step 4: Now we determine the maximal genus for a surface with H > 0.
    - Genus 0 (Sphere): A sphere is a valid example (e.g., boundary of a ball).
    - Genus 1 (Torus): It is possible to construct a torus of revolution that is embedded in R^3
      and has mean curvature H > 0 everywhere. Thus, genus 1 is possible.
    - Genus g >= 2: It is a non-trivial theorem in differential geometry that a compact
      embedded surface in R^3 with H > 0 must be of genus 0. However, this result (the Hopf Conjecture)
      was open for a long time. A slightly more accessible line of reasoning shows that
      while a specific type of torus (a "fat" torus) can have H>0, surfaces of genus g>=2
      cannot be embedded with positive mean curvature.

    Conclusion: Based on the existence of a genus 1 example and the theorems forbidding higher genera,
    the maximal possible genus is 1.
