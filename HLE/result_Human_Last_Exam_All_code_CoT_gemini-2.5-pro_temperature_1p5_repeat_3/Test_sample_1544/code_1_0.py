        Analyzes the position to find the best move.
        In the position 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1:
        - White's passed d6 pawn is a major asset.
        - Black's queen on c5 is the main defender.
        - A direct queen trade 1. Qxc5+ bxc5 leads to a King and Pawn endgame. Analysis shows
          that Black can force a draw in this endgame with the move ...c4+.
        - A better move for White is a preparatory check to reposition the queen.
        - The move 1. Qd4+ forces the Black king to move, e.g., to b7.
        - White does not trade queens but plays the killer move 2. Qd8!.
        - This move attacks d7 and threatens to push the pawn to d7.
        - Black's best defense is 2...Qc8, blocking the pawn.
        - White now trades queens with 3. Qxc8+ Kxc8.
        - The resulting endgame is easily winning for White because the Black king on c8 is cut off from the action.
        - Therefore, the first move of this winning sequence is the solution.
