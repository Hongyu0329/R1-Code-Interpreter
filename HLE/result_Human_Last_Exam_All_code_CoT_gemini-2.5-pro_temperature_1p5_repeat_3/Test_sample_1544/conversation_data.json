    "My plan is to analyze the chess position to determine the optimal move for White.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial Position:** I'll start by looking at the FEN string `8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1`. White's key advantage is the powerful passed pawn on the d6-square. Black's primary resource is their active queen on c5, which prevents the pawn from advancing and can create threats against the White king.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Obvious Move:** The most direct move is a queen trade with `1. Qxc5+`. I will analyze the resulting King and Pawn endgame. After `1...bxc5`, White's king will advance towards the pawn (`2. Kf2`), but Black's king (`2...Kc6`) can get in front of it (`3. Ke3 Kd5`). I've determined that in this specific position, Black has a saving resource (`4...c4+!`) which leads to a drawn endgame. Therefore, `1. Qxc5+` is not the winning move.\n\n3.  **Find a More Forcing Line:** Since an immediate trade leads to a draw, a better move must exist. White needs to use the queen to create threats that Black cannot easily parry. I will look for checks that improve the position of White's queen.\n\n4.  **Identify the Winning Sequence:** The move `1. Qd4+` is a check that forces Black's king to move. After the most likely response, `1...Kb7`, White should not trade queens. Instead, White has the brilliant follow-up `2. Qd8!`. This move is decisive because it attacks the d7-pawn and threatens to push the passed pawn to d7, after which it would be unstoppable.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Win:** Black's only real defense against the `d7` push is `2...Qc8`, blocking the pawn. However, this allows White to play `3. Qxc8+ Kxc8`, forcing a queen trade on highly favorable terms. The resulting endgame is an easy win for White, as the Black king on c8 is completely cut off from stopping the White king and pawn.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The move `1. Qd4+` initiates a forced sequence that leads to a winning position for White.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# This class is for demonstration purposes to encapsulate the logic.\n# The core logic is based on chess principles and analysis of the specific position.\nclass ChessPuzzleSolver:\n    def __init__(self, fen):\n        self.fen = fen\n        self.best_move = \"\"\n\n    def analyze_position(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Analyzes the position to find the best move.\n        In the position 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1:\n        - White's passed d6 pawn is a major asset.\n        - Black's queen on c5 is the main defender.\n        - A direct queen trade 1.

Qd4+ forces the Black king to move, e.g., to b7.\n        - White does not trade queens but plays the killer move 2. Qd8!.\n        - This move attacks d7 and threatens to push the pawn to d7.\n        - Black's best defense is 2...Qc8, blocking the pawn.\n        - White now trades queens with 3. Qxc8+ Kxc8.\n        - The resulting endgame is easily winning for White because the Black king on c8 is cut off from the action.\n        - Therefore, the first move of this winning sequence is the solution.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.best_move = \"Qd4+\"\n\n    def print_solution(self):\n        self.analyze_position()\n        print(\"Analyzing the position: 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\")\n        print(\"Both sides are assumed to play optimally.\")\n        print(\"White's best move is the one that initiates a forced winning sequence.\")\n        print(\"The optimal move for White is:\")\n        print(self.best_move)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # The FEN of the chess position.\n    fen_string = \"8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\"\n    solver = ChessPuzzleSolver(fen_string)\n    solver.print_solution()\n```\n<<<Qd4+>>>"
