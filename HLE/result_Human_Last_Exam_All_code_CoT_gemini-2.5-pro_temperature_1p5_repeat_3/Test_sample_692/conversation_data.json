    "Here is my plan to find the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization:\n1.  I will research the earliest known examples of writing and calendrical systems in Mesoamerica, focusing on civilizations like the Olmec, Zapotec, and Maya.\n2.  I will identify the specific artifacts that contain these early date records, such as stelae, murals, or other inscribed objects.\n3.  I will compare the dates of these artifacts, which are often determined through a combination of epigraphic analysis (deciphering the glyphs) and archaeological methods like radiocarbon dating of associated materials.\n4.  The main candidates are often cited as the Long Count dates on Stela C from Tres Zapotes and Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, a calendrical glyph from the San Bartolo murals, and a glyph from Monument 3 at San José Mogote.\n5.  After comparing these, I will identify the one that is currently accepted as the oldest recorded date.\n6.  Finally, I will write a Python script to print out the details of this earliest date, including the date itself, the civilization, the location, and the approximate year.\n\n```python\ndef find_earliest_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the earliest known date\n    recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas.\n    \"\"\"\n    civilization = \"Zapotec\"\n    location = \"San José Mogote, Oaxaca, Mexico\"\n    artifact = \"Monument 3\"\n    date_glyph = \"1 Earthquake\"\n    approximate_year_bce = 600\n    \n    print(\"The earliest known date recorded in a pre-Columbian aboriginal writing system is:\")\n    print(f\"Date Glyph: '{date_glyph}'\")\n    print(f\"Civilization: {civilization}\")\n    print(f\"Location: {location}\")\n    print(f\"Artifact: {artifact}\")\n    print(f\"Approximate Year: c. {approximate_year_bce} BCE\")\n    print(\"\\nThis date, representing a day in the 260-day ritual calendar, was carved on a stone slab and is considered one of the first examples of writing in Mesoamerica.\")\n\nfind_earliest_date()\n```\n<<<The earliest known date is '1 Earthquake' from a Zapotec monument at San José Mogote, Oaxaca, dated to approximately 600 BCE.>>>"
