    "To solve this problem, we need to find the thickness of the node in the stable reduction of the curve $C: z^2 = 2x^5+2x^3+1$ over a 2-adic field. The valuation $v$ is normalized such that $v(2)=1$.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n1.  **Identify Branch Points:** A hyperelliptic curve $z^2=f(x)$ is ramified over the roots of $f(x)$ and possibly at infinity. The stable reduction is determined by how these branch points cluster together in the 2-adic metric.\n2.  **Transform the Curve:** The degree of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$ is odd (5), which means the point at infinity is a branch point. To handle all branch points uniformly, we'll make a change of coordinates to move the point at infinity to a finite point. The transformation $x=1/y$ is suitable for this.\n3.  **Partition the Branch Points:** The branch points are partitioned into clusters based on their 2-adic valuations and Galois action. The Galois group Gal$(\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}_2/\\mathbb{Q}_2)$ acts on the set of branch points, and the partition must be stable under this action.\n4.  **Calculate the Thickness:** The thickness of a node connecting two components in the stable fiber can be calculated using the resultant of the polynomials defining the corresponding partitions of branch points. For a factorization of the branch point polynomial $h(y) = h_1(y)h_2(y)$, the thickness of the node separating these two sets of roots is given by $t = v(\\text{Res}(h_1, h_2))$.\n\n### Execution:\n\n1.  **Identify Branch Points:**\n    The branch points of $C$ are the 5 roots of $f(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1=0$ and the point at infinity, $x=\\infty$.\n\n2.  **Transform the Curve:**\n    Let's apply the transformation $x=1/y$ and $z=w/y^3$. The choice of exponent 3 for $y$ in the substitution for $z$ is to get a standard form ($g=2$, so $g+1=3$).\n    $ (w/y^3)^2 = 2(1/y)^5 + 2(1/y)^3 + 1 $\n    $ w^2/y^6 = (2 + 2y^2 + y^5) / y^5 $\n    $ w^2 = y(y^5 + 2y^2 + 2) $\n    Let $h(y) = y(y^5+2y^2+2)$. The branch points of the new model $w^2=h(y)$ are the roots of $h(y)=0$. These are $y=0$ (which corresponds to $x=\\infty$) and the 5 roots of $y^5+2y^2+2=0$ (which correspond to the 5 finite roots of the original $f(x)$).\n\n3.  **Partition the Branch Points:**\n    The polynomial $h(y)$ is factored over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ as $h_1(y) \\cdot h_2(y)$, where:\n    *   $h_1(y) = y$\n    *   $h_2(y) = y^5+2y^2+2$\n    The polynomial $2x^5+2x^3+1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and its roots form a single orbit under the action of the Galois group. Thus, the 5 roots corresponding to $h_2(y)$ cannot be separated from each other in any partition over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The point $y=0$ corresponds to the branch point at infinity of the original curve, which is fixed by the Galois group acting on the affine line. Therefore, the only non-trivial, Galois-stable partition of the branch points is $\\{0\\}$ and the five roots of $h_2(y)$. This partition corresponds to the factorization $h(y) = h_1(y)h_2(y)$. The stable reduction will have two components, one for each part of the partition, meeting at a double point (a node).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Thickness:**\n    The thickness $t$ of the node connecting the two components is given by the valuation of the resultant of the polynomials $h_1(y)$ and $h_2(y)$.\n    $ t = v(\\text{Res}(h_1, h_2)) = v(\\text{Res}(y, y^5+2y^2+2)) $\n    The resultant of a monic polynomial $p(y)$ and $y-a$ is $p(a)$. More generally, $\\text{Res}(y, P(y)) = P(0)$.\n    So, we evaluate $h_2(y)$ at $y=0$:\n    $ \\text{Res}(y, y^5+2y^2+2) = h_2(0) = 0^5+2(0)^2+2 = 2 $\n    The thickness is the valuation of this resultant:\n    $ t = v(2) $\n    The problem states that the valuation $v$ is normalized to $v(2)=1$.\n    Therefore, the thickness is 1.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This problem asks for the thickness of a double point in the stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve.\n    \n    The curve is C: z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.\n    The valuation v is normalized by v(2) = 1.\n    \n    1. Transform the curve to handle the branch point at infinity.\n    Let x = 1/y. The new equation for the branch points becomes h(y) = y*(y^5 + 2*y^2 + 2) = 0.\n    The branch points are now the roots of h(y).\n    \n    2. Partition the branch points.\n    h(y) is factored over the integers (and thus over the 2-adic integers) into h1(y) = y and h2(y) = y^5 + 2*y^2 + 2.\n    This factorization corresponds to a partition of the branch points into {infinity} and the set of 5 finite branch points.\n    This partition gives rise to a stable model with two components connected by a node.\n    \n    3.
