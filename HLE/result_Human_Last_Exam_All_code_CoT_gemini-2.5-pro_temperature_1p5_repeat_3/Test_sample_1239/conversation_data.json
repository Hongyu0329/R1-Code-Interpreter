    "Of course. Here is the explanation and the Python script to solve the problem.\n\nThe full Lie group of symmetries for the unforced, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is, in fact, infinite-dimensional. This arises from a \"gauge\" symmetry related to the pressure term: one can add an arbitrary function of time, $g(t)$, to the pressure field $P$ without altering the velocity field $\\mathbf{v}$, as the equations only involve the gradient of the pressure, $\\nabla P$.\n\nHowever, the standard and most physically relevant question concerns the **maximal finite-dimensional Lie subgroup** of symmetries. This group corresponds to the geometric transformations of space, time, and the physical fields (velocity and pressure). The dimension of this group is found by identifying all such independent continuous transformations and counting them. These are:\n\n1.  **Time Translations:** The laws of physics don't change over time.\n2.  **Space Translations:** The laws of physics are the same everywhere in space.\n3.  **Spatial Rotations:** The laws of physics are isotropic (the same in all directions).\n4.  **Galilean Boosts:** The equations are invariant under a change to a uniformly moving reference frame.\n5.  **Scaling:** A specific scaling of time, space, velocity, and pressure leaves the equations invariant. This reflects the lack of a characteristic length or time scale in the equations themselves.\n6.  **Pressure Shift:** The pressure can be shifted by a constant value without consequence.\n\nThe Python code below enumerates these symmetry types, lists their individual dimensions (number of independent parameters), and sums them to find the total dimension of the group.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional Lie group\n    of symmetries for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Dictionary mapping each type of symmetry to its dimension\n    symmetries = {\n        \"Time translation\": 1,\n        \"Space translations\": 3,\n        \"Spatial rotations (in 3D)\": 3,\n        \"Galilean boosts\": 3,\n        \"Scaling (Dilation)\": 1,\n        \"Constant pressure shift\": 1\n    }\n\n    print(\"The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries is determined by summing the number of independent generators for each type of transformation:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    total_dimension = 0\n    equation_parts = []\n\n    for name, dim in symmetries.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {dim} parameter(s)\")\n        total_dimension += dim\n        equation_parts.append(str(dim))\n\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    # The prompt requires printing the equation with each number explicitly.\n    final_equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(f\"The total dimension is the sum: {final_equation_str}\")\n    print(f\"Total Dimension = {total_dimension}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension()\n\n```\n<<<12>>>"
