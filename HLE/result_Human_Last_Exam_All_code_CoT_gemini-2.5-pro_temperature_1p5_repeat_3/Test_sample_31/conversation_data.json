    "To determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed to identify any PLL case, we need to find the smallest amount of information that can uniquely distinguish between all 21 possible permutations of the last layer pieces.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem:** The top face is already oriented, so all top stickers are the same color and provide no information. All information must come from the side stickers of the 4 top-layer corners and 4 top-layer edges. There are 12 such stickers in total.\n2.  **Test Lower Bounds:** We will test if a small number of stickers (e.g., 3) is sufficient. We do this by trying to find two different PLL cases that look identical from the perspective of those 3 stickers. If we find such a \"collision,\" then 3 stickers are not enough.\n3.  **Test the Next Higher Bound:** We will then test if 4 stickers are sufficient. It is a known principle in cubing theory that the permutation of a few key pieces can uniquely determine the overall permutation. We will select a set of 4 stickers corresponding to 3 pieces and argue why this is sufficient.\n4.  **Conclusion:** By showing that 3 stickers are insufficient and 4 are sufficient, we can conclude that 4 is the minimum number required.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that demonstrates this logic.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers\n    needed to identify any PLL case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Introduction ---\n    print(\"Problem: On a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, how many non-top-facing stickers must be seen to fully identify the PLL case?\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(\"Analysis:\")\n    print(\"PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer) involves distinguishing between 21 unique permutations of the top layer's edges and corners.\")\n    print(\"The information comes from the 12 side stickers of the 8 pieces in the top layer.\")\n\n    # --- Step 1: Test if 3 stickers are sufficient ---\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Are 3 stickers enough?\")\n    print(\"Let's test by observing 3 specific stickers: the side stickers of the Front-Top, Right-Top, and Back-Top edges.\")\n    print(\"We assume standard cube colors: Front=Green, Right=Red, Back=Blue, Left=Orange.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"We will check two different PLL cases: the V-perm and the Y-perm.\")\n\n    # V-Permutation analysis\n    print(\"  - Case 1: V-Perm\")\n    print(\"    This permutation swaps the Front-Top and Left-Top edges, among other changes.\")\n    print(\"    - Sticker on Front-Top edge: Comes from the Left piece, so its color is 'Orange'.\")\n    print(\"    - Sticker on Right-Top edge: Unaffected, so its color is 'Red'.\")\n    print(\"    - Sticker on Back-Top edge: Unaffected, so its color is 'Blue'.\")\n    print(\"    Resulting sticker signature for V-Perm: (Orange, Red, Blue)\\n\")\n\n    # Y-Permutation analysis\n    print(\"  - Case 2: Y-Perm\")\n    print(\"    This permutation ALSO swaps the Front-Top and Left-Top edges, but swaps a different pair of corners than the V-Perm.\")\n    print(\"    - Sticker on Front-Top edge: Comes from the Left piece, so its color is 'Orange'.\")\n    print(\"    - Sticker on Right-Top edge: Unaffected, so its color is 'Red'.\")\n    print(\"    - Sticker on Back-Top edge: Unaffected, so its color is 'Blue'.\")\n    print(\"    Resulting sticker signature for Y-Perm: (Orange, Red, Blue)\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Conclusion for Step 1: Since both the V-Perm and Y-Perm produce the exact same colors on these 3 stickers, 3 stickers are NOT sufficient.\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Test if 4 stickers are sufficient ---\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Are 4 stickers enough?\")\n    print(\"Let's test a set of 4 stickers.
