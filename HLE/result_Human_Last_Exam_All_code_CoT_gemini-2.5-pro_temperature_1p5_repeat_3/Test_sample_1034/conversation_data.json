    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the conditions under which a triangle with a given side and an adjacent angle can have two possible solutions for the other sides. This is known as the ambiguous case in trigonometry.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Determine the value of S**: The length of side `BC` is given by `S`, which corresponds to the number of characters in the string `SNYWR`.\n2.  **Identify the geometric setup**: We have a triangle `ABC` with side `BC` (let's call its length `a`), angle `B`, and we are considering different integer lengths for side `AC` (let's call its length `b`). We want to find when there are two possible lengths for side `AB`.\n3.  **Apply the Ambiguous Case (SSA) condition**: For a given `a`, `b`, and `B` (where `B` is acute), there are two possible triangles if and only if the side opposite angle `B` (`b = AC`) is greater than the triangle's altitude `h` from vertex `C` but less than the other given side `a = BC`.\n4.  **Calculate the altitude `h`**: The altitude `h` can be calculated using the formula `h = a * sin(B)`.\n5.  **Establish the inequality**: The condition for two possible values for side `AB` becomes `h < b < a`.\n6.  **Count the integers**: Finally, we will count how many integers `b` satisfy this inequality.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_triangle_ambiguity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the ambiguous triangle case problem.\n    In triangle ABC, given side BC, angle B, find the number of integer\n    values for side AC for which there are two possible lengths for side AB.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Determine the value of S from the string 'SNYWR'\n    s_str = 'SNYWR'\n    # Side BC = S = length of the string\n    bc_length = len(s_str)\n    \n    # Given angle B in degrees\n    angle_b_deg = 30\n    \n    # Let a = BC, b = AC, c = AB\n    a = bc_length\n    \n    print(\"Problem Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"In triangle ABC, side BC (a) = length of '{s_str}' = {a}.\")\n    print(f\"The measure of angle B is {angle_b_deg} degrees.\")\n    print(\"We are looking for the number of integer values of side AC (b) for which there are two possible values for side AB.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis corresponds to the ambiguous case (SSA) in trigonometry.\")\n    print(\"For an acute angle B, two distinct triangles exist if the following condition is met: h < b < a,\")\n    print(\"where h is the altitude from vertex C to the line containing side AB.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the altitude h = a * sin(B)\n    # Convert angle B from degrees to radians for Python's math functions\n    angle_b_rad = math.radians(angle_b_deg)\n    h = a * math.sin(angle_b_rad)\n    \n    print(\"Step-by-step Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"1.
