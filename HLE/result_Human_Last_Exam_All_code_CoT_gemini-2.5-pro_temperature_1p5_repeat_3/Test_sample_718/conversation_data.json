    "The user is asking for the value of $n$ for which a tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is $n$-resolvable, given that $J$ is an upper semilattice.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct the terms**:\n    *   An **upper semilattice** $J$ is a partially ordered set where every pair of elements has a least upper bound (a join).\n    *   A functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is a **representation** of the poset $J$. We interpret \"tame functor\" to mean that the representation category `Rep(J)` is of **tame representation type**. This is a standard classification in representation theory, sitting between finite and wild types.\n    *   A functor $f$ is **$n$-resolvable** if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. This is equivalent to saying that the projective dimension of $f$, denoted `pd(f)`, is less than or equal to $n$.\n\n2.  **Identify the core mathematical result**: The question asks for a bound on the projective dimension of $f$. This bound is determined by the homological properties of the category of all functors `Rep(J)`. The crucial property comes from $J$ being an upper semilattice.\n\n3.  **State the key theorem**: A well-known theorem in the representation theory of posets (due to Ovsienko and Roiter, also found in Ringel's work) states that if $J$ is an upper (or lower) semilattice, the global dimension of its representation category `Rep(J)` is at most 2.\n\n4.  **Connect the theorem to the question**:\n    *   The global dimension of a category is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all its objects.\n    *   The theorem `gl.dim(Rep(J)) <= 2` thus implies that for *any* functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, its projective dimension `pd(f)` is at most 2.\n    *   This means any such functor is **2-resolvable**.\n\n5.  **Consider the \"tame\" condition**: The condition that the functor is \"tame\" is consistent with the result. There exist upper semilattices that are of tame representation type and have a global dimension of exactly 2. For such a poset, there will be at least one functor $f$ with `pd(f) = 2$. Therefore, the bound $n=2$ is the best possible (i.e., it is sharp), and $n=1$ would not be sufficient for all cases. The \"tame\" condition ensures we are in a context where the representation theory is complex but not \"wild,\" but the upper bound on the projective dimension comes directly from the \"upper semilattice\" structure.\n\n6.  **Formulate the final answer**: The value of $n$ is 2. The python code will print this reasoning and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_functor_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the mathematical problem about n-resolvable functors.\n    The solution is based on a theorem from representation theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the problem's terms.\")\n    print(\" - J is an upper semilattice: A partially ordered set where every pair of elements {a, b} has a least upper bound (join), denoted a v b.\")\n    print(\" - f is a tame functor: We interpret this to mean f is a representation of J, and the category of such representations, Rep(J), is of tame type.\")\n    print(\" - f is n-resolvable: This means the projective dimension of f is at most n (pd(f) <= n).\")\n    print(\"The question is: what is the maximal projective dimension for such a functor f?\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Identifying the key theorem.\")\n    print(\"A central result in the representation theory of posets, attributed to Ovsienko and Roiter, concerns the global dimension of the category of representations of a semilattice.\")\n    print(\"Theorem: If J is an upper semilattice, the global dimension of the category of its representations, Rep(J), is at most 2.\")\n    print(\"In mathematical notation: gl.dim(Rep(J)) <= 2.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Applying the theorem.\")\n    print(\"The global dimension of a category is the maximum projective dimension of any object in it.\")\n    print(\"Since gl.dim(Rep(J)) <= 2, this means for ANY functor f in this category, its projective dimension must satisfy pd(f) <= 2.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, any such functor f is 2-resolvable.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"Step 4: Considering the 'tame' condition and final conclusion.\")\n    print(\"The condition that f is 'tame' is important because there exist tame upper semilattices whose representation categories have a global dimension of exactly 2.\")\n    print(\"This means the bound n=2 is sharp; n=1 would not be sufficient for all cases.\")\n    print(\"The final answer is therefore n = 2.\")\n    \n    # Per the instructions, we must output the number in the final result.\n    # The final equation is n = 2.
