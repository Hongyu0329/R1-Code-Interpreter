    "I will solve this Connect 4 problem by analyzing the game state to find the moves for player 'O' that lead to the quickest possible win.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Represent the Board**: I will represent the game board as a 2D list (or array) in Python. 'X' and 'O' will represent the players' pieces, and '.' will represent empty cells.\n2.  **Check for Immediate Win**: First, I will check if 'O' has any moves that result in an immediate victory (a \"win in 1\"). I will iterate through all possible moves for 'O', place a piece hypothetically, and check if this creates a line of four 'O's.\n3.  **Search for Forced Win**: If no immediate win is found, the next fastest way to win is to make a move that guarantees a win on the subsequent turn (a \"win in 2\"). This typically involves creating two threats simultaneously (a \"fork\"), which the opponent ('X') cannot block at the same time.\n    *   For each of 'O's possible moves, I will analyze the resulting board state.\n    *   I will then consider all possible responses from 'X'.\n    *   If, for every possible response from 'X', 'O' has a move that wins the game, then 'O's initial move is a \"forced win\".\n4.  **Identify Optimal Moves**: The set of optimal moves will be the one(s) that lead to the fastest win. If there are moves that win in 1 turn, those are the answer. If not, the moves that guarantee a win in 2 turns are the answer.\n5.  **Format Output**: I will format the identified optimal moves as requested (e.g., `c4, f4`).\n\nBased on my analysis, 'O' has no immediate winning moves. However, there are moves that create an unstoppable fork, guaranteeing a win on the next turn. The following Python code will perform this analysis and print the optimal moves.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef create_board():\n    \"\"\"Initializes the game board based on the provided image.\"\"\"\n    return [\n        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],\n        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],\n        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],\n        ['.', '.', '.', 'O', 'O', '.', '.'],\n        ['O', '.', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'X'],\n        ['X', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'X']\n    ]\n\ndef get_valid_moves(board):\n    \"\"\"Finds all possible moves on the current board.\"\"\"\n    moves = []\n    for c in range(7):\n        for r in range(5, -1, -1):\n            if board[r][c] == '.':\n                moves.append((r, c))\n                break\n    return moves\n\ndef check_win(board, player):\n    \"\"\"Checks if the given player has won the game.\"\"\"\n    # Check horizontal locations for win\n    for c in range(4):\n        for r in range(6):\n            if all(board[r][c+i] == player for i in range(4)):\n                return True\n\n    # Check vertical locations for win\n    for c in range(7):\n        for r in range(3):\n            if all(board[r+i][c] == player for i in range(4)):\n                return True\n\n    # Check positively sloped diagonals\n    for c in range(4):\n        for r in range(3, 6):\n            if all(board[r-i][c+i] == player for i in range(4)):\n                return True\n\n    # Check negatively sloped diagonals\n    for c in range(4):\n        for r in range(3):\n            if all(board[r+i][c+i] == player for i in range(4)):\n                return True\n    return False\n\ndef make_move(board, move, player):\n    \"\"\"Creates a new board state after a move.\"\"\"\n    r, c = move\n    new_board = [row[:] for row in board]\n    new_board[r][c] = player\n    return new_board\n\ndef solve_connect4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the optimal moves for the current player to win as fast as possible.\n    \"\"\"\n    initial_board = create_board()\n    player = 'O'\n    opponent = 'X'\n\n    # --- Level 1: Check for a win in 1 move ---\n    winning_moves_1_turn = []\n    for move in get_valid_moves(initial_board):\n        board_after_move = make_move(initial_board, move, player)\n        if check_win(board_after_move, player):\n            winning_moves_1_turn.append(move)\n\n    if winning_moves_1_turn:\n        # If we can win in 1, these are the optimal moves.\n        print_moves(winning_moves_1_turn)\n        return\n\n    # --- Level 2: Check for a forced win in 2 moves (O-X-O sequence) ---\n    winning_moves_2_turns = []\n    for p1_move in get_valid_moves(initial_board):\n        board_after_p1 = make_move(initial_board, p1_move, player)\n        \n        # A move is a forced win if for ALL opponent responses, we have a winning move.\n        is_forced_win = True\n        \n        # If opponent has no moves, it can't be a forced win for us.\n        opponent_moves = get_valid_moves(board_after_p1)\n        if not opponent_moves:\n            is_forced_win = False\n\n        for opp_move in opponent_moves:\n            board_after_opp = make_move(board_after_p1, opp_move, opponent)\n            \n            # If the opponent can win, it's not a forced win for us.\n            if check_win(board_after_opp, opponent):\n                is_forced_win = False\n                break\n                \n            # Check if we have at least one winning reply\n            player_has_winning_reply = False\n            for p2_move in get_valid_moves(board_after_opp):\n                board_after_p2 = make_move(board_after_opp, p2_move, player)\n                if check_win(board_after_p2, player):\n                    player_has_winning_reply = True\n                    break # Found a winning reply\n            \n            if not player_has_winning_reply:\n                # If there's any opponent move that we can't counter with a win,\n                # then our initial move was not a forced win.\n                is_forced_win = False\n                break\n        \n        if is_forced_win:\n            winning_moves_2_turns.append(p1_move)\n\n    if winning_moves_2_turns:\n        print_moves(winning_moves_2_turns)\n        return\n        \n    print(\"No optimal winning moves found in the next 2 turns.\")\n\ndef print_moves(moves):\n    \"\"\"Converts move coordinates to algebraic notation and prints them.\"\"\"\n    # Sort for consistent output\n    sorted_moves = sorted(moves, key=lambda m: (m[1], m[0]))\n    \n    move_names = []\n    for r, c in sorted_moves:\n        col_name = chr(ord('a') + c)\n        # Board rows are 1-6, indices are 0-5. row_name = index + 1\n        row_name = r + 1 \n        # But board display is 1 at top, 6 at bottom.
