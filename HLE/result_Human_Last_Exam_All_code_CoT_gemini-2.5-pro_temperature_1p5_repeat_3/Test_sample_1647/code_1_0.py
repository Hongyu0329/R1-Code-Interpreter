# Plan:
# 1. Calculate the time dilation factor 'f' based on the physics described.
# 2. Determine the most memory-efficient set of variables for a Bagua C program.
# 3. Calculate the total memory usage 'z' in trits for those variables.
# 4. Print the final answer in the format f:z.

# --- Step 1: Calculate the factor 'f' ---

# From the problem, we deduce the Schwarzschild radius (Rs) and the distance (d).
Rs = 10  # km (inferred from "minimum safe distance ... 10 km")
d = 13   # km (given distance from the event horizon)

# The distance 'r' from the center of the black hole is Rs + d.
r = Rs + d

# The formula for the time dilation factor is f = sqrt(1 - Rs / r).
# The term inside the square root is the fraction we need to compute.
numerator = r - Rs
denominator = r
f_value = math.sqrt(numerator / denominator)

# Round f to 3 decimal places as required (0.001).
f_rounded = round(f_value, 3)

# --- Step 2 & 3: Calculate memory usage 'z' ---

# Based on the Bagua Architecture Specification:
# - unsigned char: 2 trits (6 bits)
# - frac struct: signed char (2 trits) + unsigned wchar (4 trits) + signed char (2 trits) = 8 trits

# To write the most memory-efficient program, we use the smallest possible types.
size_Rs_var = 2  # trits, for an 'unsigned char' to store 10
size_d_var = 2   # trits, for an 'unsigned char' to store 13

# For the calculation (1 - Rs/r) and the final result, we need a fractional type.
# A single 'frac' variable can be used and reused for all fractional calculations.
size_f_var = 8   # trits, for a 'frac' variable

# Total memory usage 'z' is the sum of the variable sizes.
z_usage = size_Rs_var + size_d_var + size_f_var

# --- Step 4: Output the results ---
