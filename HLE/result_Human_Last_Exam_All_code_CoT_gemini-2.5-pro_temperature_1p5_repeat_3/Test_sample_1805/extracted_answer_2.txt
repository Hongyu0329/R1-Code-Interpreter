For integer n, the q-difference quotient is given by $\nabla_q(T^n) = [n]_q T^{n-1}$, where $[n]_q = \frac{q^n - 1}{q - 1}$ is the q-analogue of n. For any positive integer $n$, this can be written as the polynomial expansion $\nabla_q(T^n) = (\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} q^k) T^{n-1}$. For $n=0$, the result is 0.
