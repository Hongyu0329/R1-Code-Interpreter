# The Rust code will not compile due to borrow checker errors.
# The primary issue is found in both `MultiHeadAttention::backward` and `FeedForward::backward` methods.
# Let's take the `FeedForward::backward` method as a specific example.

# The problematic line is:
# self.w2.set(j, k, self.w2.get(j, k) - learning_rate * gradients.get(i, k) * hidden_gradients.get(i, j));

# Here's a breakdown of the error:
# 1. The `set` method on a `Matrix` has the signature `fn set(&mut self, ...)`. When called as `self.w2.set(...)`, it takes a mutable borrow of `self.w2`.
# 2. The third argument to `set` is an expression that includes a call to `self.w2.get(j, k)`. The `get` method has the signature `fn get(&self, ...)`, so this call takes an immutable borrow of `self.w2`.
# 3. Rust's fundamental borrowing rule is that you cannot have a mutable borrow of a value at the same time as any other borrow (mutable or immutable) of the same value.
# 4. Because the immutable borrow for `get` occurs within the argument list of the `set` call, the lifetimes of the mutable and immutable borrows overlap, which the compiler forbids.
# 5. This will result in a compile-time error, something like: `error[E0502]: cannot borrow `self.w2` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable`.

# Additionally, the code has several unused items:
# - The functions `exp` and `ln` are defined but never used.
# - The function `initialize_weights` is defined but never used.
# - The `Tokenizer::decode` method is defined but never used.
# - The `backward` methods for `MultiHeadAttention` and `FeedForward` are defined but never used.
# - The entire `LayerNorm` struct and its implementation are defined but never used.
# These unused items will generate compiler warnings.

# Therefore, the code will not compile due to an error, and it will also produce warnings.
