    "To compute the determinant of the given matrix, I will use Python and the `numpy` library, which is ideal for matrix operations.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the 3x3 matrix `A` using `numpy.array`.\n2.  Retrieve each element of the matrix.\n3.  Construct and print a string that shows the general formula for a 3x3 determinant calculation, with the specific values from matrix `A` substituted into it. This will satisfy the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n4.  Calculate the intermediate steps of the formula and print them to make the process clear.\n5.  Use the `numpy.linalg.det()` function to compute the final determinant and print the result. The result will be rounded to handle any potential floating-point inaccuracies.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_determinant_and_show_steps():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix and shows the calculation steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given matrix from the problem\n    # The context about the Markov quiver is not needed for the calculation itself.\n    A = np.array([\n        [2, -1, -1],\n        [-1, 2, -1],\n        [-1, -1, 2]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"Given the matrix A:\")\n    print(A)\n    print(\"\\nWe will compute the determinant using the formula for a 3x3 matrix:\")\n    print(\"det = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\n    \n    # Extracting elements for clarity in the formula\n    a, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\n    d, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\n    g, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n    # Printing the formula with the numbers substituted\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values from matrix A into the formula:\")\n    final_equation = (\n        f\"det(A) = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - \"\n        f\"({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + \"\n        f\"({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\"\n    )\n    print(final_equation)\n\n    # Calculating the intermediate parts of the equation\n    part1_val = e * i - f * h\n    part2_val = d * i - f * g\n    part3_val = d * h - e * g\n    \n    step2_equation = (\n        f\"       = ({a}) * ({part1_val}) - ({b}) * ({part2_val}) + ({c}) * ({part3_val})\"\n    )\n    print(step2_equation)\n    \n    # Calculating the final terms\n    term1 = a * part1_val\n    term2 = -b * part2_val\n    term3 = c * part3_val\n\n    step3_equation = f\"       = {term1} + {term2} + {term3}\"\n    print(step3_equation)\n    \n    # The final result of the manual calculation\n    final_result_manual = term1 + term2 + term3\n    print(f\"       = {final_result_manual}\")\n    \n    # For verification, we compute using numpy's built-in function\n    determinant = np.linalg.det(A)\n    \n    # Printing the final answer\n    print(\"\\n-------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The determinant of the matrix is: {round(determinant)}\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncompute_determinant_and_show_steps()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
