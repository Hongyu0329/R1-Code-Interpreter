    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ that has $n=12345$ vertices and is not a complete graph. The chromatic number is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring.\n\n2.  **Establish an Upper Bound:**\n    *   For any graph with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is at most $n$.\n    *   The only graph that requires $n$ colors is the complete graph, $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n    *   The problem states that our graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatic number of $G$ must be strictly less than $n$. This gives us an upper bound: $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n\n3.  **Check if the Upper Bound is Achievable:** To determine if $n-1$ is the maximum possible number of colors, we need to see if there exists a graph $G$ (which is not complete) that actually requires $n-1$ colors.\n\n4.  **Construct an Example Graph:**\n    *   Consider the graph constructed by taking a complete graph $K_n$ and removing a single edge, let's call it $e = (u, v)$. Let this new graph be $G = K_n - e$.\n    *   This graph $G$ is not a complete graph because the edge $(u, v)$ is missing.\n    *   Let's determine the chromatic number of this graph $G$.\n        *   Since vertices $u$ and $v$ are not connected, we can assign them the same color (say, color 1).\n        *   Any other vertex $w$ in the graph is connected to all other vertices except the one it is identical to (it was part of a $K_n$). In particular, every other vertex $w$ is connected to both $u$ and $v$. So, none of them can be colored with color 1.\n        *   The remaining $n-2$ vertices (all vertices except $u$ and $v$) form a complete subgraph $K_{n-2}$. This means they are all mutually connected and each requires a unique color, different from color 1.\n        *   So, we need $n-2$ distinct colors for these vertices.\n        *   The total number of colors needed is $1$ (for $u$ and $v$) + $(n-2)$ (for the other vertices) = $n-1$.\n    *   Thus, we have found a non-complete graph on $n$ vertices with a chromatic number of $n-1$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have shown that any non-complete graph on $n$ vertices needs at most $n-1$ colors.\n    *   We have also shown that there exists a non-complete graph that needs exactly $n-1$ colors.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of colors required is $n-1$.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** With $n=12345$, the maximum number of colors is $12345 - 1 = 12344$. This will be implemented in the Python code below.\n\n```python\n# The number of vertices in the graph G\nn = 12345\n\n# A graph on n vertices has a chromatic number of n if and only if it is the complete graph Kn.\n# The problem states that G is not the complete graph.\n# Therefore, the chromatic number of G must be less than n.\n# The maximum integer value less than n is n - 1. So, an upper bound for the chromatic number is n - 1.\n\n# To verify this is the maximum possible value, we need to show that there exists a non-complete graph\n# on n vertices that requires n - 1 colors.\n# Consider the graph formed by taking the complete graph Kn and removing a single edge.\n# This graph is not complete, and it can be shown that its chromatic number is exactly n - 1.\n# (As explained in the steps above, you can color the two non-adjacent vertices with the same color,\n# and all other n-2 vertices will need their own unique colors).\n\n# So, the maximum number of colours is n - 1.\nmax_colors = n - 1\n\n# Print the equation and the final answer.\nprint(f\"The maximum number of colors is found by the equation:\")\nprint(f\"{n} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
