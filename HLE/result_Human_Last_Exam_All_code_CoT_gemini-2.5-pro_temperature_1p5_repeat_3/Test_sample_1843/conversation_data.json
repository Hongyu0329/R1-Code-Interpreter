    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor and order, we can follow these steps. This process involves number theory, specifically the structure of the group of Dirichlet characters.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Prime Factorization**: Decompose the conductor $N$ into its prime power factors, $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$.\n2.  **Character Decomposition**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive Dirichlet character with conductor $p_i^{a_i}$.\n3.  **Order Decomposition**: The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$.\n4.  **Counting Component Characters**: For each prime power factor $p_i^{a_i}$, we will count the number of primitive characters whose order is a divisor of 6.\n5.  **Combining the Counts**: We will combine the counts for each factor to find the number of tuples $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_r)$ such that $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r)) = 6$.\n\nThis plan is implemented in the following Python script, which calculates the number of choices for each component character and combines them to find the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    This function counts the number of positive integers up to a given integer n\n    that are relatively prime to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return result\n\ndef count_characters(conductor, required_order_lcm):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters for a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = conductor\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order {required_order_lcm}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Prime Factorization\n    factors = {4: 2, 9: 2, 7: 1, 11: 1, 13: 1} # N = 36036 = 4 * 9 * 7 * 11 * 13\n    print(f\"Step 1: The prime factorization of N is 2^2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 * 13.\")\n    print(\"This means we need to consider primitive characters modulo q = 4, 9, 7, 11, and 13.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Character and Order Decomposition\n    print(\"Step 2: A character chi is primitive modulo N if and only if it is a product of primitive characters\")\n    print(\"chi = chi_4 * chi_9 * chi_7 * chi_11 * chi_13, where each chi_q is primitive modulo q.\")\n    print(f\"The order of chi must be {required_order_lcm}, which means lcm(ord(chi_4), ..., ord(chi_13)) = {required_order_lcm}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Count the number of choices for each component character whose order divides 6.\\n\")\n\n    # For q = 4 = 2^2\n    # There is 1 primitive character modulo 4, and its order is 2.\n    # Since 2 divides 6, this character is a valid choice.\n    count_4 = 1\n    print(f\"For conductor q = 4: There is {count_4} primitive character.
