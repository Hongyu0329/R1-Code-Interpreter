    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box within a specific interval. The probability is found by integrating the probability density function, |Ψ(x)|², over this interval.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **State the Formula:** The probability density for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' in the state 'n' is P(x) = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a).\n2.  **Set up the Integral:** We need to calculate the probability P = ∫ P(x) dx from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a for n = 2.\n3.  **Analytical Solution:** This integral can be solved analytically. After normalizing the coordinates by the box length 'a' (letting u = x/a), the formula for the probability becomes:\n    P = (u₂ - u₁) - [sin(2nπu₂) - sin(2nπu₁)] / (2nπ)\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** The Python code below will use this formula to compute the exact probability. It will first print the full equation with all the given numbers plugged in, and then it will print the final calculated result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box in a given\n    interval for a specific quantum number n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the quantum state and the interval boundaries (normalized by box length 'a')\n    n = 2\n    u1 = 0.495  # Start of the interval (x1/a)\n    u2 = 0.505  # End of the interval (x2/a)\n\n    # The probability is calculated from the analytical solution of the integral of |Ψ(x)|².\n    # The formula is: P = (u2 - u1) - [sin(2*n*pi*u2) - sin(2*n*pi*u1)] / (2*n*pi)\n\n    # Calculate the terms of the formula\n    interval_width = u2 - u1\n    \n    arg1 = 2 * n * np.pi * u1\n    arg2 = 2 * n * np.pi * u2\n    \n    sin_term = np.sin(arg2) - np.sin(arg1)\n    \n    denominator = 2 * n * np.pi\n\n    # Calculate the final probability\n    probability = interval_width - (sin_term / denominator)\n\n    # As requested, print the final equation with each number explicitly shown.\n    # The 'pi' symbol is used for clarity instead of its numerical value.\n    print(\"The final equation with all numbers plugged in is:\")\n    print(f\"P = ({u2} - {u1}) - [sin(2 * {n} * pi * {u2}) - sin(2 * {n} * pi * {u1})] / (2 * {n} * pi)\")\n\n    # Print the final numerical result\n    print(\"\\nThe calculated probability is:\")\n    print(probability)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_probability()\n<<<6.579785860475345e-06>>>\n```"
