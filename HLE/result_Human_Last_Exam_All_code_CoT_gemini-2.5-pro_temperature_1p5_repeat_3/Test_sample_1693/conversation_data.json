    "To answer this question, I will research the naval and merchant ship losses of the French fleet during the early stages of World War II, specifically focusing on sinkings caused by German U-boats before the Armistice of 22 June 1940. I will compare the displacement (measured in Gross Register Tonnage or GRT for merchant vessels) of the sunk ships to identify the largest one.\n\nThe script below will display the details of the identified ship.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_sunk_ship():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the details of the largest French ship\n    sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of June 1940.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ship details based on historical records\n    ship_name = \"Champlain\"\n    ship_type = \"Ocean Liner\"\n    displacement_grt = 28124\n    date_sunk = \"17 June 1940\"\n    u_boat_responsible = \"U-65\"\n    cause_of_sinking = \"struck a mine laid by the U-boat\"\n\n    # Print the findings\n    print(f\"The largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the {ship_type} '{ship_name}'.\")\n    print(f\"It had a displacement of {displacement_grt} GRT.\")\n    print(f\"The ship was sunk on {date_sunk} after it {cause_of_sinking} {u_boat_responsible}.\")\n\nfind_largest_sunk_ship()\n```\n<<<Champlain>>>"
