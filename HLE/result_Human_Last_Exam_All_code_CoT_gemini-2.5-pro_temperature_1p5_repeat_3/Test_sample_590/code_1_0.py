    This function solves for the number of positive eigenvalues of the stability operator L.
    
    The stability operator is given by:
    L = (1/(<ρ>**(n-1)|F_ρ|)) * d/dρ(<ρ>**(n-1)|F_ρ|**(-1) * d/dρ) 
        + (1/<ρ>**2) * Delta_S + (n(n-1)/<ρ>**(2n))
    
    Based on mathematical analysis, the operator can be shown to be negative semi-definite.
    The argument proceeds by comparing the operator L with the well-known stability operator of the catenoid.
    For n=2, the operator is L = Delta_cat + 2/<ρ>**4.
    The operator L' = Delta_cat + 2/<ρ>**2 is known to be negative semi-definite.
    Since L = L' - 2*ρ**2/<ρ>**4, which is a negative perturbation of L',
    the eigenvalues of L must also be non-positive.
    
    This reasoning suggests that for any n>=2, the operator L does not have any positive eigenvalues.
