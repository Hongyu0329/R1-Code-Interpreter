    "To determine the oligomeric state of the provided coiled-coil protein sequences, we need to use a specialized bioinformatics prediction tool. A simple inspection of the sequences is often insufficient, as the oligomeric state is determined by complex energetic contributions from the amino acids in the helical interface.\n\nHere is the plan to solve this problem using a Python script:\n1.  We will use the `LOGICOIL` web server, a tool specifically designed to predict coiled-coil oligomerization states (dimer, trimer, tetramer).\n2.  The Python script will programmatically send each protein sequence to the `LOGICOIL` server using an HTTP POST request.\n3.  It will then parse the HTML result page returned by the server to find the prediction.\n4.  The prediction, given as text (e.g., \"DIMER\"), will be converted into its corresponding number (e.g., 2).\n5.  This process will be repeated for all five sequences.\n6.  Finally, the script will print the predicted oligomeric state for each sequence.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan. You may need to install the `requests` library first by running `pip install requests` in your terminal.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport time\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_state(sequence, seq_num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Submits a sequence to the LOGICOIL web server and parses the result.\n    \n    Args:\n        sequence (str): The protein sequence to analyze.\n        seq_num (int): The number of the sequence for printing purposes.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or str: The predicted oligomeric state as a number (2, 3, 4) or an error message.\n    \"\"\"\n    # URL and data payload for the LOGICOIL web server\n    url = \"http://coiledcoils.chm.bris.ac.uk/logicoil/cgi-bin/logicoil.cgi\"\n    payload = {\n        'seq': sequence,\n        'win': '28',\n        'out': 'normal',\n        'prot': 'parallel',\n        'mat': 'new'\n    }\n    \n    state_map = {\"DIMER\": 2, \"TRIMER\": 3, \"TETRAMER\": 4}\n\n    try:\n        # We add a small delay to be respectful to the server\n        time.sleep(1)\n        \n        print(f\"Analyzing Sequence {seq_num}: {sequence}\")\n        response = requests.post(url, data=payload, timeout=60)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # This will raise an error for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)\n\n        # The server returns the prediction in the format: \"...predicted to be a <strong>STATE</strong>\"\n        # We use a regular expression to find and extract the state.\n        match = re.search(r\"predicted to be a <strong>(\\w+)<\\/strong>\", response.text)\n\n        if match:\n            state_text = match.group(1).upper()\n            if state_text in state_map:\n                state_number = state_map[state_text]\n                print(f\"Result for Sequence {seq_num}: The predicted state is {state_text}, which corresponds to the number {state_number}.\\n\")\n                return state_number\n            else:\n                return f\"Unknown state '{state_text}' found.\"\n        else:\n            return \"Could not find prediction in the server response.\"\n            \n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        return f\"An error occurred: {e}\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to process all sequences and print the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # List of protein sequences from the user\n    sequences = [\n        \"EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK\",\n        \"EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ\",\n        \"EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ\",\n        \"EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK\",\n        \"EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK\",\n    ]\n    \n    # Predict the state for each sequence\n    predicted_states = []\n    for i, seq in enumerate(sequences):\n        state = predict_oligomeric_state(seq, i + 1)\n        if isinstance(state, int):\n            predicted_states.append(state)\n        else:\n            print(f\"Could not determine state for sequence {i+1}: {state}\")\n            predicted_states.append(\"Error\")\n\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The final predicted oligomeric states are:\")\n    \n    # Final output as requested\n    final_output = ','.join(map(str, predicted_states))\n    print(final_output)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
