    This function determines the smallest possible size of the limit
    by constructing a specific example and calculating its limit.

    The problem states:
    J is a directed poset.
    F is a functor from J^op to Set.
    F(j) is non-empty for all j in J.
    The maps f: F(j) -> F(i) for i <= j are surjective.

    A mathematical theorem guarantees the limit is non-empty, so its size is >= 1.
