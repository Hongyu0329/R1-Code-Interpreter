    Analyzes six classes of partially ordered sets and determines if they

    # --- Case A ---
    # Class: X = {G graph: H not a subgraph of G} for a connected graph H.
    # Order: G1 <= G2 if G1 is a subgraph of G2.
    # Reasoning: A maximal element is a graph G in X such that no other graph G' in X
    # properly contains G as a subgraph. However, for any graph G in X, we can construct
    # a new graph G' by adding an isolated vertex to G. Since H is given as connected,
    # adding an isolated vertex cannot create H as a subgraph. Thus, G' is also in X.
    # Since G is a proper subgraph of G', we have G < G'. This means no graph G
    # can be maximal, as we can always find a larger one in X.
    answer_A = 'N'

    # --- Case B ---
    # Class: X = S, where S is a finite, discrete subset of R.
    # Order: The standard order <= on R.
    # Reasoning: Any finite, non-empty set of real numbers has a maximum element.
    # A maximum element 'm' is one such that for all 's' in S, s <= m. This
    # element 'm' is also a maximal element, as there is no other element
    # in S strictly greater than 'm'.
    answer_B = 'Y'

    # --- Case C ---
    # Class: X = S, where S is a countable, discrete subset of R.
    # Order: The standard order <= on R.
    # Reasoning: This depends on the specific set S chosen.
    # - Example with a maximal element: S = {-n | n is a positive integer} = {-1, -2, -3, ...}.
    #   The maximal element is -1.
    # - Example without a maximal element: S = {n | n is a natural number} = {0, 1, 2, ...}.
    #   This set is unbounded above and has no maximal element.
    # Since some sets have a maximal element and some do not, the answer depends on the set.
    answer_C = 'D'

    # --- Case D ---
    # Class: X = S, where S is an uncountable, discrete subset of R.
    # Order: The standard order <= on R.
    # Reasoning: An uncountable, discrete subset of R cannot exist. A discrete set means
    # for each point s in S, there is an open interval (s-e, s+e) containing no other
    # points from S. These intervals are disjoint. Each interval must contain a rational
    # number. This creates an injective map from S to the set of rational numbers Q.
    # Since Q is countable, S must also be countable, a contradiction.
    # The class of such sets is empty. A universal statement ("all sets have...")
    # about members of an empty class is vacuously true.
    answer_D = 'Y'

    # --- Case E ---
    # Class: X = {sequences of natural numbers}.
    # Order: (a_n) <= (b_n) if (b_n) is a subsequence of (a_n).
    # Reasoning: A maximal element 'm' is a sequence such that if another sequence 'x'
    # is a subsequence of 'm', then 'x' must be equal to 'm'. Consider a constant
    # sequence, m = (c, c, c, ...). Any subsequence of 'm' must also be (c, c, c, ...),
    # which is equal to 'm'. Therefore, constant sequences are maximal elements. Since
    # the set X has maximal elements, the answer is Yes.
    answer_E = 'Y'

    # --- Case F ---
    # Class: X = {sequences of natural numbers}.
    # Order: (a_n) <= (b_n) if (a_n) is a subsequence of (b_n).
    # Reasoning: A maximal element 'm' would be a sequence that cannot be a proper
    # subsequence of any other sequence. For any sequence m = (m_1, m_2, ...), we can
    # construct a new sequence x = (k, m_1, m_2, ...), where k is any natural number.
    # Then m is a proper subsequence of x, meaning m < x. As this holds for any sequence
    # 'm', no sequence can be maximal.
    answer_F = 'N'
