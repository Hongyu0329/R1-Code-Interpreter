# The question is about a specific choreographic sequence in the Act I variation of Don Quixote.
# This sequence of single turns is typically performed across two musical phrases.

# Number of pirouettes performed in the first musical phrase.
turns_in_first_phrase = 4

# Number of pirouettes performed in the second musical phrase.
turns_in_second_phrase = 4

# Calculate the total number of pirouettes.
total_turns = turns_in_first_phrase + turns_in_second_phrase

# Print the breakdown and the final result.
