    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor $d$ and order $k$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the conductor $d$**: First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d=53599$. A character $\\chi$ is primitive with conductor $d$ if it cannot be induced from a character of a smaller conductor. For a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$, a character $\\chi \\pmod d$ is a product of characters $\\chi_i \\pmod{p_i}$, i.e., $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$. The character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is non-principal (i.e., not the trivial character).\n\n2.  **Analyze the order $k$**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters, i.e., $\\text{order}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{order}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{order}(\\chi_r))$. We are given that the order is $k=6$.\n\n3.  **Count the relevant characters**: For each prime factor $p_i$ of $d$, we need to count the number of non-principal characters modulo $p_i$ whose order divides $k=6$. The group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $p-1$. The number of characters of order $j$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(j)$, provided that $j$ divides $p-1$.\n\n4.  **Use Inclusion-Exclusion**: We need to count the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_r)$ such that all $\\chi_i$ are non-principal and $\\text{lcm}(\\text{order}(\\chi_i)) = 6$. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for this. The total number of combinations where the lcm of the orders is exactly 6 is given by:\n    (Total tuples where lcm divides 6)\n    - (Total tuples where lcm divides 3)\n    - (Total tuples where lcm divides 2)\n    + (Total tuples where lcm divides 1)\n\nLet's apply this plan to the given problem.\n\n*   **Step 1**: Factorize $d=53599$. We find that $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. This is a product of $r=4$ distinct primes, so it's a square-free conductor.\n*   **Step 2**: The order is $k=6$. We need to find tuples of non-principal characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ for primes $(7, 13, 19, 31)$ such that their lcm of orders is 6.\n*   **Step 3**: For each prime factor $p_i$, we check that $6 | (p_i-1)$, which is true for all four primes ($6|6$, $6|12$, $6|18$, $6|30$).\n    The number of non-principal characters mod $p_i$ whose order divides a number $m$ (where $m|6$) is the sum of $\\phi(j)$ for all $j|m$ and $j>1$.\n    *   Orders dividing 6: {2, 3, 6}. Number of choices per prime: $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2 = 5$.\n    *   Orders dividing 3: {3}. Number of choices per prime: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Orders dividing 2: {2}. Number of choices per prime: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Orders dividing 1: None, as we only consider non-principal characters.\n*   **Step 4**: Apply inclusion-exclusion for $r=4$ primes.\n    *   Tuples where lcm divides 6: $5^4 = 625$.\n    *   Tuples where lcm divides 3: $2^4 = 16$.\n    *   Tuples where lcm divides 2: $1^4 = 1$.\n    *   Tuples where lcm divides 1: $0^4 = 0$.\n    The total count is $625 - 16 - 1 + 0 = 608$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic and prints the detailed calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive integer.\")\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of unique prime factors of a number.\"\"\"\n    factors = set()\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        if temp % d == 0:\n            factors.add(d)\n            while temp % d == 0:\n                temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors.add(temp)\n    return sorted(list(factors))\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters for a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    order_k = 6\n\n    # Step 1: Factor the conductor d\n    primes_d = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    num_prime_factors = len(primes_d)\n\n    print(f\"The conductor is d = {d} and the required order is k = {order_k}.\")\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of d is: {primes_d}.
