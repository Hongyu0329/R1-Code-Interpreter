    # --- Print the prioritized options and their justification ---

    print("Chosen Option: I. Counsel patient on stopping cannabis.")
    print("Rationale: The patient's heavy daily cannabis use is a major contributing factor to his insomnia and anxiety, despite his belief to the contrary. Chronic use disrupts sleep architecture and can cause rebound anxiety. Addressing this is the most critical first step to stabilize the patient.\n")

    print("Chosen Option: III. Order a urine drug test.")
    print("Rationale: A urine drug screen is essential for any patient with a substance use disorder history. It provides objective data, confirms the use of cannabis, and screens for other potential substances (like a relapse on cocaine) that could be complicating his presentation and interacting dangerously with his medications.\n")

    print("Chosen Option: IV. Prescribe melatonin for insomnia.")
    print("Rationale: The patient's insomnia is a severe and distressing symptom. Offering a safe, low-risk, and non-addictive intervention like melatonin directly addresses a chief complaint. This can help build therapeutic rapport and provide some relief while the more complex issue of cannabis use is addressed.\n")

    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    print("--------------------------------------------------")
    print("Final Conclusion: The combination of counseling on cannabis cessation (I), obtaining a urine drug test (III), and providing a safe intervention for insomnia (IV) represents the most sound and immediate clinical strategy.")
    print("This combination corresponds to answer choice L.")
