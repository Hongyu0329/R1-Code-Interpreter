    Analyzes a modified 3D Navier-Stokes equation to determine if its solution can blow up.

    The method involves checking a sufficient condition for global regularity based on the
    time-dependent viscosity function ν(t) = 1+t. According to a theorem by
    Liu, Liu, and Pego (2019), a solution is guaranteed to be globally regular (no blow-up)
    in 3D if the integral of ν(t)⁻² from t=0 to infinity is finite.

    This script uses the sympy library to compute this integral and check the condition.
