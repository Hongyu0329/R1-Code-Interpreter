    # The problem asks for the number of homeomorphism classes for a metric space X with certain properties.
    # Let's list the properties of X:
    # 1. X is a metric space, which implies it is a Hausdorff space.
    # 2. X is locally compact.
    # 3. X is a one-to-one continuous image of the real line, R. This means there is a continuous
    #    bijective function f: R -> X.
    # 4. For each pair of distinct points x, y in X, there exists a closed connected set K
    #    such that x is in the interior of K (Int(K)) and K is a subset of X \ {y}.

    # Step 1: Analyze the consequence of the continuous bijection f: R -> X.
    # The domain, the real line R (with its standard topology), is a locally compact, sigma-compact,
    # and Hausdorff space. (It's sigma-compact because it's a countable union of compact sets,
    # e.g., R = union of all [-n, n] for n in natural numbers).
    # The codomain, X, is given as locally compact and is metric, hence it is also Hausdorff.

    # Step 2: Apply a key theorem from general topology.
    # A theorem states that any continuous bijection from a locally compact, sigma-compact Hausdorff space
    # to a locally compact Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism.
    # Our function f: R -> X perfectly fits the conditions of this theorem.
    # Therefore, f must be a homeomorphism.

    # Step 3: Determine the homeomorphism class of X.
    # Since X is homeomorphic to R, it must belong to the same homeomorphism class as R.
    # This leads to the conclusion that there is only one possible homeomorphism class for X.

    # Step 4: Verify that the real line R satisfies the remaining property.
    # Let's check if R satisfies property (4).
    # Let x and y be any two distinct points in R. Let's assume x < y for simplicity.
    # We need to find a closed connected set K in R such that x is in Int(K) and y is not in K.
    #
    # In R, closed connected sets are closed intervals [a, b].
    # Let's choose epsilon = (y - x) / 2. This value is positive.
    # Define the set K as the closed interval [x - epsilon, x + epsilon].
    #
    # Let's check the conditions for this K:
    # - Is K closed and connected? Yes, it's a closed interval in R.
    # - Is x in Int(K)? The interior of K is the open interval (x - epsilon, x + epsilon).
    #   Clearly, x lies within this open interval.
    # - Is y outside of K? The right endpoint of K is x + epsilon = x + (y - x) / 2 = (x + y) / 2.
    #   Since x < y, we have (x + y) / 2 < y. So, y is not in the interval K.
    #
    # The property holds for R.

    # Step 5: Final conclusion.
    # The given conditions uniquely determine that X must be homeomorphic to the real line R.
    # Therefore, there is only one such homeomorphism class.
