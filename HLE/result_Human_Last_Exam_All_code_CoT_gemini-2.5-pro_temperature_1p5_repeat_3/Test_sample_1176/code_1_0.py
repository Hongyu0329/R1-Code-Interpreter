# Plan:
# 1. Evaluate statement 1: Morrison formation as a foredeep deposit. This is a consensus view. (C)
# 2. Evaluate statement 2: Metamorphic core complexes from a slab window. The cause is highly debated; this is one of several major hypotheses. (D)
# 3. Evaluate statement 3: "Nevadaplano" orogenic plateau. This is now a widely accepted concept based on strong paleoaltimetry evidence. (C)
# 4. Evaluate statement 4: "Arizonaplano" via magmatic thickening. This is a more recent and more controversial extension of the plateau concept. (D)
# 5. Evaluate statement 5: Laramide structures are inboard of Sevier structures. This is a fundamental geographic and structural observation. (C)
# 6. Evaluate statement 6: Sierra Nevada and Idaho Batholiths from the Cordilleran arc. This is a foundational concept of plate tectonics in North America. (C)
# 7. Evaluate statement 7: Eocene ignimbrite flare-up in ID/MT propagating southwest. This accurately describes the well-documented Yellowstone hotspot track. (C)
# 8. Evaluate statement 8: Colorado Plateau high by the late Cretaceous. The timing of Colorado Plateau uplift is a classic, unresolved debate. (D)
# 9. Evaluate statement 9: Cascades at modern elevation by Oligocene. The modern high volcanoes are much younger (Pliocene-Holocene); this is not the consensus view. (D)
# 10. Evaluate statement 10: Laramide caused by Shatsky conjugate subduction. This is a leading, but not universally accepted, hypothesis for the cause of Laramide flat-slab subduction. (D)
