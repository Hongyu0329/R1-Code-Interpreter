Plan: To answer the question about the factors controlling friction in superlubric systems, I will analyze the core physical mechanism of structural superlubricity.

1.  **Core Principle of Superlubricity:** The phenomenon of superlubricity is most fundamentally explained by the concept of structural incommensurability. This occurs when two crystalline surfaces sliding against each other have mismatched atomic lattices (either due to different rotational alignment or different lattice constants).

2.  **Role of Atomic Alignment (Coherence):**
    *   When two surfaces are **coherent** (i.e., aligned and commensurate), their atoms can easily fall into the potential energy wells of the opposing surface. This creates a "locked-in" state with a highly corrugated energy landscape, which results in high friction.
    *   When the surfaces are **incoherent** (incommensurate), the atomic interactions are averaged out over the contact area, resulting in an extremely smooth potential energy landscape. This drastically reduces the force required for sliding, leading to superlubricity.
    *   Therefore, the frictional force **increases** significantly with the degree of coherence (alignment).

3.  **Role of Normal Load:**
    *   Similar to macroscopic friction, increasing the normal load (the force pressing the surfaces together) pushes the atoms closer and enhances their interaction. This generally leads to an increase in the frictional force, both in high-friction and superlubric states.

4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   Choice A is incorrect because "smoothness" is a macroscopic term; atomic registry is the key.
    *   Choice B correctly states that friction increases with both **normal load** and **coherence (alignment)**. This aligns perfectly with the fundamental principles.
    *   Choices C, D, and E are less accurate. While temperature and velocity (C) do influence the residual friction in a superlubric state, the structural factors in B are more primary. The claims in D and E are not generally correct.

Conclusion: The combination of normal load and the alignment of atomic structures are the primary factors that determine the frictional response.
