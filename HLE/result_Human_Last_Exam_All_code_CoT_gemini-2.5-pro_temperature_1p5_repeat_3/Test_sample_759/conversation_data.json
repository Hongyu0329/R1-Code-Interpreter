    "Here is my thinking process for solving this problem:\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations\n1.  **Analyze the contraints:** The problem asks for the smallest number of edges, `e`, in a simple, connected graph `γ` for which the size of its automorphism group, `|Aut(γ)|`, is exactly 3.\n\n2.  **Group Theory Insight:** The only group of order 3 is the cyclic group `Z_3`. This means the automorphism group must be `Z_3 = {id, φ, φ²}`, where `φ` is an automorphism of order 3 (i.e., applying it three times gets you back to the original graph, `φ³ = id`).\n\n3.  **Action on Vertices and Edges:** The automorphism `φ` permutes the vertices and edges of the graph. Since `φ` has order 3, the vertices and edges must be partitioned into orbits of size 1 (fixed points/edges) or 3.\n    *   A simple connected graph cannot consist solely of fixed vertices, as that would imply `|Aut(γ)| = 1`. Thus, there must be at least one vertex orbit of size 3.\n    *   An edge `(u, v)` can only be a fixed edge (orbit of size 1) if both its endpoints `u` and `v` are fixed vertices. If a graph has no fixed vertices, all its edges must be in orbits of size 3, and therefore `e` must be a multiple of 3.\n\n4.  **Explore Small Values of `e`:** Let's search for the smallest `e`.\n    *   **Can e = 3?** If `e=3`, the edges must form a single orbit. To make the graph connected, the simplest structure is a star graph `K₁,₃`. This graph has a central vertex connected to three leaf vertices. The central vertex is a fixed point, and the leaves form an orbit of size 3. However, any permutation of the three leaf vertices is a valid automorphism, so `|Aut(K₁,₃)| = 3! = 6`. This doesn't work.\n    *   **Can e = 6?** This would mean two edge orbits of size 3. A common attempt is to use two vertex orbits, `O₁ = {v₁, v₂, v₃}` and `O₂ = {w₁, w₂, w₃}`.\n        *   **Construction A:** Create a 3-cycle on `O₁` (3 edges), and connect each `vᵢ` to a `wᵢ` (3 more edges). This graph has a `C₃` with three pendant edges. This structure is symmetric; for example, one can swap `v₂` and `v₃` (and correspondingly `w₂` and `w₃`) while fixing `v₁` and `w₁`. This reflection is an automorphism, which means the group is the dihedral group `D₃` of order 6.\n        *   **Construction B:** Create a 3-cycle on `O₁` and use a \"twisted\" connection, e.g., `(v₁,w₂), (v₂,w₃), (v₃,w₁)`. This also results in a graph with reflectional symmetry and `|Aut(γ)| = 6`.\n    *   It seems that with a small number of vertices and edges, it is difficult to break the inherent reflectional symmetry that arises alongside 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n5.  **Construct a candidate graph for e = 9:** Let's try `e=9`, which would be three edge orbits. To systematically break the reflectional symmetry, we can build a \"chain\" of orbits where the connections introduce asymmetry.\n    *   **Vertices:** Let's use three vertex orbits, `O₁={v₁,v₂,v₃}`, `O₂={w₁,w₂,w₃}`, and `O₃={z₁,z₂,z₃}`. This gives `n=9` vertices.\n    *   **Edges:** We'll define 3 edge orbits, each with 3 edges.\n        1.  **Edge Orbit 1:** A 3-cycle on `O₁`: `{(v₁,v₂), (v₂,v₃), (v₃,v₁)}`.\n        2.  **Edge Orbit 2:** A parallel connection from `O₁` to `O₂`: `{(v₁,w₁), (v₂,w₂), (v₃,w₃)}`.\n        3.  **Edge Orbit 3:** A *twisted* connection from `O₂` to `O₃`: `{(w₁,z₂), (w₂,z₃), (w₃,z₁)}`.\n    *   **Analysis of this graph:**\n        *   Total edges `e = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9`.\n        *   The graph is connected.\n        *   The vertex orbits are distinguishable by their degrees: `deg(vᵢ)=3`, `deg(wᵢ)=2`, `deg(zᵢ)=1`. Therefore, any automorphism must map each orbit to itself.\n        *   Let `f` be an automorphism. Its action on the vertices `O₁` must be a permutation `p₁`. The parallel connection to `O₂` forces the action on `O₂` to be the same permutation `p₂=p₁`. The twisted connection to `O₃` imposes a constraint `p₂(i)+1 = p₃(i+1)` (modulo 3). This constraint is only satisfied if the permutation is a rotation (`i → i+c`), not a reflection (`i → c-i`).\n        *   Since reflections are ruled out, the only possible automorphisms are the 3-fold rotations (`id, φ, φ²`). This gives `|Aut(γ)|=3`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** We have ruled out `e=3` and `e=6`. We have found a valid graph with `e=9`. Since the number of edges for graphs with no fixed vertices must be a multiple of 3, `e=9` is the smallest possible value for this class. More complex constructions involving fixed points tend to require more edges to break the extra symmetries. Therefore, `e=9` is the smallest possible number of edges.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the solution and prints the smallest number of edges 'e'\n    for a simple, connected graph with an automorphism group of size 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find the smallest simple, connected graph γ with |Aut(γ)|=3, we search for the minimum number of edges 'e'.\")\n    print(\"The automorphism group must be the cyclic group Z_3.\")\n    print(\"After ruling out smaller edge counts (e=3, e=6) which lead to larger symmetry groups (like D_3 of order 6), we find a solution with e=9.\")\n    print(\"\\nA minimal graph with 9 edges can be constructed on 9 vertices, partitioned into three orbits: V={v1,v2,v3}, W={w1,w2,w3}, Z={z1,z2,z3}.\")\n    print(\"The edges are formed from three orbits of size 3:\")\n    \n    # Define the edges of the minimal graph\n    edge_orbit_1 = [('v1', 'v2'), ('v2', 'v3'), ('v3', 'v1')]\n    edge_orbit_2 = [('v1', 'w1'), ('v2', 'w2'), ('v3', 'w3')]\n    edge_orbit_3 = [('w1', 'z2'), ('w2', 'z3'), ('w3', 'z1')]\n    \n    all_edges = edge_orbit_1 + edge_orbit_2 + edge_orbit_3\n    \n    print(\"\\n1.
