# The problem reduces to computing the total rank of the polynomial ring Z[u,v]
# with deg(u)=deg(v)=2, for degrees up to 100.
# The rank in degree k is non-zero only if k is even, say k=2d.
# The rank in degree 2d is the number of monomials u^i * v^j such that
# 2i + 2j = 2d, which simplifies to i + j = d.
# The number of non-negative integer solutions (i, j) to i+j=d is d+1.
# We need to sum these ranks for all degrees k <= 100, which means 2d <= 100, so d <= 50.
# Thus, we need to compute the sum of (d+1) for d from 0 to 50.
