    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve for the common eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Numbers:** For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=1`, and since it's an electron, its intrinsic spin quantum number is `s=1/2`.\n2.  **Find Total Angular Momentum (j):** The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, is found by combining `l` and `s`. According to the rules of angular momentum addition, `j` can take values from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n3.  **Determine Magnetic Quantum Numbers (m_j):** For each value of `j`, the associated magnetic quantum number, `m_j`, can take values from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps. These `(j, m_j)` pairs define the possible quantum states.\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues:** The operators $J^2$ and $J_z$ are diagonal in the `|j, m_j>` basis. Their eigenvalues are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $J_z$ is $\\hbar m_j$.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that systematically calculates all possible values for `j` and `m_j`. It will then compute the corresponding eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$ for each state. The script will print the complete eigenvalue equation for each possible state `|j, m_j>`, making the relationship between the quantum numbers and the eigenvalues explicit. I will use Python's `fractions` module to display the quantum numbers and eigenvalues as neat fractions (e.g., 3/2) for better readability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is l=1.\n    l = 1\n    # For an electron, the spin quantum number is s=1/2.\n    s = 0.5\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with l={l} and s={Fraction(s)}.\\n\")\n\n    # The rules of angular momentum addition state that the total angular\n    # momentum quantum number j can take values from |l-s| to l+s.\n    j_values = np.arange(abs(l - s), l + s + 1, 1)\n\n    print(\"The eigenvalue equations are of the form:\")\n    print(\"J^2 |j, m_j> = j(j+1) * h_bar^2 |j, m_j>\")\n    print(\"J_z |j, m_j> = m_j * h_bar |j, m_j>\\n\")\n\n    # Iterate through each possible value of j\n    for j in j_values:\n        j_frac = Fraction(j).limit_denominator()\n        \n        # Calculate the eigenvalue for J^2, which depends only on j.\n        j2_eigenvalue = Fraction(j * (j + 1)).limit_denominator()\n        \n        print(f\"--- For states with total angular momentum j = {j_frac} ---\")\n        \n        # For a given j, the magnetic quantum number m_j runs from -j to +j.\n        mj_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n        \n        # Iterate through each possible value of m_j for the given j\n        for mj in mj_values:\n            mj_frac = Fraction(mj).limit_denominator()\n            \n            # Print the state and its corresponding eigenvalues\n            print(f\"For the state |j={j_frac}, m_j={mj_frac}>:\")\n            print(f\"  J^2 |{j_frac}, {mj_frac}> = {j2_eigenvalue} * h_bar^2 |{j_frac}, {mj_frac}>\")\n            print(f\"  J_z |{j_frac}, {mj_frac}> = {mj_frac} * h_bar |{j_frac}, {mj_frac}>\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n```\n<<<For a p-electron, there are two possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j: 3/2 and 1/2.
