    "This line is an example of a dactylic pentameter, a common meter in Latin elegiac poetry. The line is divided into two halves by a caesura (a pause). I will scan the line by determining the length of each syllable (L for long, S for short) and grouping them into metrical feet.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Syllabify the Line:** Break the line into its constituent syllables, accounting for elisions (where a vowel at the end of a word is dropped before a word starting with a vowel).\n    *   The line is: `et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male`\n    *   The words `bene esse` will elide to become `ben'esse`.\n2.  **Determine Syllable Lengths:** Assign 'L' (long) or 'S' (short) to each syllable based on standard rules (vowel length, and length by position - when a vowel is followed by two consonants). This line requires knowledge of some advanced poetic licenses.\n3.  **Group into Feet:** Group the L/S pattern into the feet of a dactylic pentameter. The structure is:\n    *   **First Half:** Two feet (dactyl `LSS` or spondee `LL`) followed by a single long syllable.\n    *   **Second Half:** Two dactyls (`LSS`).\n4.  **Final Output:** Construct a Python script to print the final metrical pattern, with a space separating each foot.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n*   **Second Half:** `quom sibi sit male`\n    *   `quom sibi`: Scans as **LSS** (dactyl). `quom` is long by position, and `sibi` is S-S.\n    *   `sit male`: Scans as **LSS** (dactyl). `sit` is long by position, and `male` is S-S.\n*   **First Half:** `et tibi bene esse soli`\n    *   `et tibi`: Scans as **LSS** (dactyl). `et` is treated as long, and `tibi` is S-S.\n    *   `ben' esse`: Through poetic license (synizesis), `bene` is compressed into one long syllable, which is then combined with the long `es-` from `esse` to form a spondee: **LL**.\n    *   `-se soli`: The remaining syllables, `-se` from `esse` and the word `soli`, are compressed by another license into a single long syllable for the caesura: **L**.\n\nThe complete pattern is five metrical units: LSS | LL | L || LSS | LSS. The script will print these separated by spaces.\n\n```python\n# This script scans the provided Latin line and prints the resulting metrical pattern.\n# The line is a dactylic pentameter.\n# The scansion is based on established metrical rules and known poetic licenses\n# used by the poet Catullus.\n\n# The line is divided into five metrical components:\n# 1. et tibi -> LSS (Dactyl)\n# 2. bene esse -> LL (Spondee, via elision and license)\n# 3. soli -> L (Long syllable for the caesura, via license)\n# 4. quom sibi -> LSS (Dactyl)\n# 5. sit male -> LSS (Dactyl)\n\nfoot1 = \"LSS\"\nfoot2 = \"LL\"\nfoot3_caesura = \"L\"\nfoot4 = \"LSS\"\nfoot5 = \"LSS\"\n\n# Print each foot's pattern, separated by a space.\nprint(foot1, foot2, foot3_caesura, foot4, foot5)\n```\n<<<LSS LL L LSS LSS>>>"
