    "An internal adjunction from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ in the simplex category $\\Delta$ (when viewed as a locally posetal 2-category) is a pair of order-preserving maps, $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and $g: [n] \\to [m]$, that form a Galois connection. This means they must satisfy the following two inequalities:\n1.  $id_{[m]} \\le g \\circ f$, which translates to $i \\le g(f(i))$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n2.  $f \\circ g \\le id_{[n]}$, which translates to $f(g(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [n]$.\n\nSuch an adjunction is uniquely determined by the map $f$, which is called the left adjoint. The number of adjunctions is therefore equal to the number of possible left adjoint maps from $[m]$ to $[n]$.\n\nA crucial property for an order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ to be a left adjoint is that for any element $j$ in the codomain $[n]$, the set $\\{i \\in [m] \\mid f(i) \\le j\\}$ must have a maximum element. Since $[m]$ is a finite and totally ordered set, any non-empty subset has a maximum. Thus, the condition simplifies to this set being non-empty for all $j \\in [n]$.\n\nFor the set to be non-empty for all $j \\in [n]$, it must hold for $j=0$. This means there must be some $i \\in [m]$ such that $f(i) \\le 0$. As the values are non-negative, this requires $f(i)=0$. Since $f$ is order-preserving, this implies $f(0)=0$.\n\nConversely, if $f(0)=0$, then for any $j \\ge 0$, the element $0$ is in the set $\\{i \\in [m] \\mid f(i) \\le j\\}$, so the set is never empty.\nTherefore, an order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if $f(0)=0$.\n\nOur task is to count the number of order-preserving maps $f: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $f(0)=0$.\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of non-decreasing sequences $f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(23)$ where each $f(i)$ is an integer from $0$ to $37$.\n\nLet $m=23$ and $n=37$. We need to count the number of sequences $y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_m$ such that $0 \\le y_1 \\le y_2 \\le \\dots \\le y_m \\le n$. This is a classic combinatorics problem that can be solved using stars and bars. The number of such sequences is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n+m}{m}$.\n\nFor this problem, we have $m=23$ and $n=37$. The number of adjunctions is $\\binom{37+23}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$. The following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_adjunction_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of internal adjunctions from [m] to [n]\n    in the simplex category.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The objects in the simplex category are [m] and [n]\n    m = 23\n    n = 37\n\n    # The number of adjunctions is given by the binomial coefficient C(n+m, m).\n    # This counts the number of order-preserving maps f: [m] -> [n]\n    # with the property f(0) = 0.\n    \n    k_upper = n + m\n    k_lower = m\n\n    # Calculate the binomial coefficient C(k_upper, k_lower)\n    result = math.comb(k_upper, k_lower)\n\n    print(f\"The number of internal adjunctions from [{m}] to [{n}] is calculated by the formula C(n+m, m).\")\n    print(f\"With m = {m} and n = {n}, the expression is C({n} + {m}, {m}).\")\n    print(f\"This simplifies to C({k_upper}, {k_lower}).\")\n    print(f\"The final calculated value is: {result}\")\n\nsolve_adjunction_count()\n```\n<<<46376915184344440>>>"
