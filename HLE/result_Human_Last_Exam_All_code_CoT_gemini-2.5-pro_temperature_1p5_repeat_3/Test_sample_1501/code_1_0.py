    # --- Part (a) ---
    # Question: Is it true that each element is contained in exactly v-1 ND-pairs?

    # Number of ND-pairs containing a point (x,0):
    # 1. From Type 1 nestings: (x,0) is paired with (y,0) for v-1 choices of y.
    #    Each such pair has multiplicity μ. Total contribution: (v-1) * μ
    # 2. From Type 2 nestings: (x,0) is paired with (x,1). This ND-pair is
    #    generated for each choice of y != x, so there are v-1 occurrences.
    #    Total contribution: v-1

    # Check if simplified_expr == v - 1.
    # (v - 1)*(v + 4)/6 == v - 1  implies (v + 4)/6 = 1, so v + 4 = 6, which means v = 2.
    # The problem specifies v >= 4, so the statement is false.
    answer_a = "False"

    # --- Part (b) ---
    # Question: What is the multiplicity of an ND-pair {(x, 0), (y, 0)}?

    # The ND-pair {(x, 0), (y, 0)} is generated by Type 1 blocks only.
    # These blocks `{(x,0),(y,0),(z,1),(w,1)}` are nested as `{{(x,0),(y,0)},{(z,1),(w,1)}}`.
    # Such a block is created for each block `{x,y,z,w}` in the original SQS(v)
    # where the nesting contained the pair `{x,y}`.
    # The problem states the multiplicity of `{x,y}` was μ.
    # Thus, the multiplicity of `{(x, 0), (y, 0)}` is also μ.
    answer_b = "μ"

    # --- Part (c) ---
    # Question: Must there exist ND-pairs with multiplicity exactly v?

    # We check the multiplicities of all ND-pair types generated by the construction:
    # 1. Pairs like {(x,0), (y,0)} have multiplicity μ = (v-2)/6.
    #    (v-2)/6 = v  => v-2 = 6v => 5v = -2, impossible for positive v.
    # 2. Pairs like {(x,0), (x,1)} have multiplicity v-1.
    #    v-1 = v => -1 = 0, impossible.
    # 3. Pairs like {(x,0), (y,1)} for x != y are never ND-pairs, so their multiplicity is 0.
    #    0 = v, impossible for v >= 4.
    # No type of ND-pair has multiplicity v.
    answer_c = "No"
