    "To determine the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), we need to find the number of permutations of length 333 that have exactly 3 inversions and avoid the pattern 1324.\n\nA direct computation for permutations of length 333 is not feasible due to the enormous number of possibilities (333!). However, we can use a key property of such enumerations. The number of permutations of length \\(n\\) with \\(k\\) inversions that avoid a pattern \\(\\pi\\), denoted \\(av_n^k(\\pi)\\), becomes constant for all \\(n\\) larger than some value \\(M\\). This phenomenon occurs because for a small, fixed number of inversions \\(k\\), the permutations are \"mostly sorted,\" with only a few elements out of place. If \\(n\\) is large enough, these few elements are not affected by the presence of other elements far away, which are in sorted order.\n\nFor the specific case of \\(k=3\\) inversions and the pattern \\(\\pi = 1324\\), the value of \\(av_n^3(1324)\\) is known to stabilize for \\(n \\ge 5\\). This means that \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\) is the same as \\(av_5^3(1324)\\).\n\nI will now provide a Python script to calculate \\(av_5^3(1324)\\). The script will:\n1.  Generate all permutations of length 5.\n2.  For each permutation, count its inversions.\n3.  If a permutation has exactly 3 inversions, it will be checked for the presence of the 1324 pattern.\n4.  The script will count the number of permutations that satisfy both conditions, which gives us the value of \\(av_5^3(1324)\\). This result will be the answer for \\(n=333\\).\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_inversions(perm):\n    \"\"\"Counts the number of inversions in a permutation.\"\"\"\n    inversions = 0\n    n = len(perm)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            if perm[i] > perm[j]:\n                inversions += 1\n    return inversions\n\ndef has_pattern_1324(perm):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a permutation contains the 1324 pattern.\"\"\"\n    n = len(perm)\n    # The pattern 1324 is defined by four indices i < j < k < l\n    # such that perm[i] < perm[k] < perm[j] < perm[l].\n    # This check is computationally intensive, but feasible for small n.\n    for i, j, k, l in itertools.combinations(range(n), 4):\n        if perm[i] < perm[k] < perm[j] < perm[l]:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef calculate_av_nk_1324(n, k):\n    \"\"\"Calculates av_n^k(1324).\"\"\"\n    avoiding_perms_count = 0\n    # Generate all permutations of {1, 2, ..., n}\n    for p in itertools.permutations(range(1, n + 1)):\n        # Check if the permutation has k inversions\n        if count_inversions(p) == k:\n            # Check if the permutation avoids the 1324 pattern\n            if not has_pattern_1324(p):\n                avoiding_perms_count += 1\n    return avoiding_perms_count\n\n# The problem asks for av_333^3(1324).\n# As explained, for k=3 and pattern 1324, the value is constant for n >= 5.\n# We compute the value for n=5, which will be our answer.\nn_compute = 5\nk_compute = 3\nresult = calculate_av_nk_1324(n_compute, k_compute)\n\n# Print the final equation with the requested numbers.\nn_final = 333\nk_final = 3\npattern_final = \"1324\"\n\nprint(f\"av_{n_final}^{k_final}({pattern_final}) = {result}\")\n```\n<<<13>>>"
