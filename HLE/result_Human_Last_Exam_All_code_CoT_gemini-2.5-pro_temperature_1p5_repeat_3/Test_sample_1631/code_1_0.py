# The user wants to identify the scientific basis for using bypass notches in sheet metal die design.
# I have analyzed the options and determined that the most accurate and comprehensive reason
# relates to the control of material flow during the forming process.

# A. Focuses only on wrinkles.
# B. Residual stress is more of a secondary effect.
# C. Friction is managed by other means.
# D. This describes the fundamental principle. Controlling material inflow is key to preventing both wrinkles and tears.
# E. Anisotropy is managed differently.
# F. Burrs relate to cutting, not forming.
# G. Trapped lubricant is managed by vents.
# H. Rollover relates to cutting, not forming.
# I. Thinning is an effect of poor material inflow, so D is the root cause.
# J. Bend cracks are a specific case; D is more general.
# K. Biaxial stretching is a state of strain, not a defect to be counteracted directly.

# Therefore, option D is the best answer as it describes the core mechanism that notches are designed to influence.

final_answer = "D"
