    "To find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$, we will determine its representation in scientific notation, which is of the form $d \\times 10^k$, where $1 \\le d < 10$. The first two digits of the number are the first two digits of the mantissa $d$.\n\nOur number is $N = e^{-7^{13}}$.\nTo find $d$ and $k$, we can analyze the base-10 logarithm of $N$:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}})$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\log(a^b) = b \\log(a)$, we get:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = -7^{13} \\times \\log_{10}(e)$\n\nLet $L = \\log_{10}(N)$. We can express $N$ as $10^L$. By writing $L$ as the sum of its integer part $k = \\lfloor L \\rfloor$ and its fractional part $f = L - \\lfloor L \\rfloor$, we have:\n$N = 10^{k+f} = 10^f \\times 10^k$\n\nThis is the scientific notation for $N$. The exponent is $k = \\lfloor L \\rfloor$, and the mantissa is $d = 10^f$. Since $0 \\le f < 1$, we have $1 \\le d < 10$.\nOur plan is to calculate $L$ with high precision, find its fractional part $f$, and then calculate $d = 10^f$ to find its first two digits.\n\nThe steps are:\n1.  Calculate the exact integer value of $7^{13}$.\n2.  Compute $\\log_{10}(e)$ to a high degree of precision.\n3.  Calculate their product $L = -7^{13} \\log_{10}(e)$.\n4.  Isolate the fractional part $f = L - \\lfloor L \\rfloor$.\n5.  Compute $d = 10^f$.\n6.  Extract the first two digits of $d$.\n\nWe will use Python's `decimal` library for high-precision floating-point arithmetic to ensure the accuracy of the result.\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\n# Set the precision for decimal calculations. A precision of 50 digits is sufficient.\ndecimal.getcontext().prec = 50\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate 7^13 ---\npower_val = 7**13\nprint(f\"The equation we want to solve involves finding the first two digits of e^(-7^13).\")\nprint(f\"First, we calculate the exponent value:\")\nprint(f\"7^13 = {power_val}\\n\")\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate log10(e) ---\n# log10(e) = 1 / ln(10)\nln_10 = decimal.Decimal(10).ln()\nlog10_e = decimal.Decimal(1) / ln_10\nprint(f\"Next, we need the value of log10(e):\")\nprint(f\"log10(e) = {log10_e}\\n\")\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate log10(N) ---\n# L = log10(N) = -7^13 * log10(e)\nL = -decimal.Decimal(power_val) * log10_e\nprint(f\"Now, we compute the base-10 logarithm of our number N = e^(-7^13):\")\nprint(f\"log10(N) = -7^13 * log10(e)\")\nprint(f\"log10(N) = {L}\\n\")\n\n# --- Step 4: Isolate the fractional part ---\n# k is the integer part (exponent in scientific notation)\n# f is the fractional part, used to find the mantissa\nk = L.to_integral_value(rounding=decimal.ROUND_FLOOR)\nf = L - k\nprint(f\"The number N can be written as 10^(k+f) = (10^f) * (10^k), where k is an integer and 0 <= f < 1.\")\nprint(f\"The integer part (exponent) is k = floor(log10(N)) = {k}\")\nprint(f\"The fractional part is f = log10(N) - k = {f}\\n\")\n\n# --- Step 5: Compute the mantissa d = 10^f ---\nd = decimal.Decimal(10)**f\nprint(f\"The mantissa (significant digits) is d = 10^f:\")\nprint(f\"d = {d}\\n\")\n\n# --- Step 6: Extract the first two digits ---\n# The string representation of d will be \"d.ddddd...\".\n# The first two non-zero digits are the digit before the decimal point and the first digit after.\nd_str = str(d)\nfirst_two_digits = d_str[0] + d_str[2]\nprint(f\"The first two non-zero digits of e^(-7^13) are the first two digits of d.\")\nprint(f\"The first two digits are: {first_two_digits}\")\n```\n<<<25>>>"
