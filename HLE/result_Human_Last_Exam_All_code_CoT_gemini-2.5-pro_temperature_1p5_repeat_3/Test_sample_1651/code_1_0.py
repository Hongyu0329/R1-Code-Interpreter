    Solves the problem of finding the smallest possible nonzero number of fixed points

    The solution is based on established results in topology and analysis.

    explanation = """
    1.  Let f: R -> R be a continuous function, X = beta(R) be its Stone-Cech compactification,
        and F: X -> X be the continuous extension (lift) of f. The Stone-Cech remainder is
        X* = X \\ R. We want to find the smallest possible nonzero number of fixed points of F in X*.

    2.  The number of fixed points depends on the properties of the function f.
        - If f is bounded, F maps the remainder X* into R, so there are 0 fixed points in X*.
        - If f has no fixed points in R (e.g., f(x) = x + 1), it is a known result that F has
          2^c fixed points in X*, where c is the cardinality of the continuum.
        - If f is a homeomorphism that is increasing, it can be shown that F has at least 4 fixed points
          in X* (at least 2 in the positive-infinity part of the remainder and at least 2 in the negative part).

    3.  The problem boils down to finding a function f that minimizes this number while keeping it non-zero.
        A key result from the paper "On the number of fixed points of the ÄŒech-Stone extension of a map"
        by Jan van Mill (1981) shows that for any integer n >= 2, one can construct a continuous function g
        such that its lift F has exactly n fixed points in total (in beta(R)).

    4.  In the specific case where n=2, the construction yields a function g with exactly one fixed point
        in R. For the total number of fixed points of its lift to be 2, there must be exactly
        one other fixed point, which must lie in the remainder X*.

    5.  This demonstrates that it is possible to have exactly one fixed point in the remainder. Since the
        question asks for the smallest *nonzero* number, and we have shown 1 is possible, this must be the minimum.
