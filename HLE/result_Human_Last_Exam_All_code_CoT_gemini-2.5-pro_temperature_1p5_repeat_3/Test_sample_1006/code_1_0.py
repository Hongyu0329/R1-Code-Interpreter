    Solves the problem by applying the theory of Stone-Čech compactification.

    The problem statement describes a compact topological space X such that:
    1. X contains a dense copy of the long ray R = [0, ω₁).
    2. Every bounded continuous function f: R -> ℝ extends to a unique continuous function on X.

    This second property is the universal mapping property that defines the
    Stone-Čech compactification of R, denoted βR.

    A key theorem in topology states that the Stone-Čech compactification of a
    Tychonoff space (which R is) is unique up to a homeomorphism that is the identity
    on the original space.

    This means that any two spaces, say X_1 and X_2, that both satisfy the
    given conditions must both be homeomorphic to βR. Consequently, X_1 and X_2
    are homeomorphic to each other.

    Therefore, all such spaces X belong to a single homeomorphism class.
