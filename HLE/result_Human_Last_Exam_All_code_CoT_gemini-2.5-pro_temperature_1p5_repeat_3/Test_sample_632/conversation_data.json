    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  First, I need to access historical information about Rome's Piazza della Rotonda and the architectural changes that occurred there.\n2.  I will search for modifications made to the square, specifically focusing on removals that happened around the year 1950.\n3.  Historical sources indicate that in the late 19th century, large iron railings (an *inferriata*) were installed around the central fountain, the Fontana del Pantheon, to protect it from the crowds and the market that filled the square.\n4.  These railings were later seen as an eyesore that obstructed the view of the beautiful fountain and the Pantheon behind it. They were removed in the post-war period to restore the square's open space.\n5.  I will create a simple Python script that stores this information in a variable and prints it as the answer, satisfying your request for a coded solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_piazza_rotonda_mystery():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the historical question about\n    the Piazza della Rotonda in Rome.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The feature was a protective fence installed in the late 19th century.\n    feature_description = \"The iron railings (or fence) that surrounded the central fountain\"\n    \n    # The year mentioned in the prompt is a reference to the post-war period when they were removed.\n    # While the exact year can be debated, it was around the mid-20th century.\n    year = 1950\n\n    print(f\"The unique architectural feature removed from the Piazza della Rotonda around the year {year} was:\")\n    print(feature_description)\n\nsolve_piazza_rotonda_mystery()\n```\n<<<The iron railings (or fence) that surrounded the central fountain>>>"
