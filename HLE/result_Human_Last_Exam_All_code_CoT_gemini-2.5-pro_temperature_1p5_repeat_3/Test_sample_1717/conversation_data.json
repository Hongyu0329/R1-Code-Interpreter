    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n\n1.  **Find the Base Health:** First, we need the Eye of Cthulhu's base health as defined in the game's source code. This value is 2,800.\n2.  **Apply the Expert Mode Multiplier:** In Expert Mode, most boss health values are multiplied by a factor of 2.0. So, the base health for a single player in Expert Mode is `2800 * 2.0 = 5600`.\n3.  **Analyze Multiplayer Scaling:** The game increases boss health in multiplayer. According to the 1.4+ source code, the total health is multiplied by a factor based on the number of players (`P`). The formula is `TotalMultiplier = 1 + (P * 0.35)`.\n4.  **Formulate the Unbounded Health Equation:** Combining these, the total health for `P` players is `Health(P) = (BaseHealth * ExpertMultiplier) * (1 + P * 0.35)`, which simplifies to `Health(P) = 5600 * (1 + 0.35 * P)`.\n5.  **Consider the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:** As the number of players `P` approaches infinity, the value of `Health(P)` also approaches infinity.\n6.  **Identify the Game Engine Limit:** This is the crucial step. While the formula is unbounded, Terraria's game engine is not. The source code reveals that NPC health is stored as a 32-bit signed integer. The code contains a check that explicitly caps any calculated health value at the maximum for this data type, which is `2^31 - 1`, or `2,147,483,647`.\n\nTherefore, even with an infinite number of players, the Eye of Cthulhu's health cannot exceed this hard-coded cap.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_terraria_health_cap():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu\n    in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players, based on Terraria's source code.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the base health from the game's code.\n    base_health = 2800\n\n    # Step 2: Define the Expert Mode health multiplier.\n    expert_mode_multiplier = 2.0\n\n    # Step 3: Define the health scaling formula for 'P' players.\n    # The formula is: Health(P) = (base_health * expert_mode_multiplier) * (1 + 0.35 * P)\n    # As the number of players 'P' approaches infinity, the result of this formula also approaches infinity.\n\n    # Step 4: Identify the hard-coded engine limit from the source code.\n    # NPC health is capped at the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer.\n    health_cap = int(math.pow(2, 31) - 1)\n\n    # Step 5: The final answer is this cap, as the unbounded calculation will always exceed it.\n    # We will print the numbers that lead to this conclusion.\n    print(\"The unbounded health formula is: (Base Health * Expert Multiplier) * (1 + 0.35 * Player_Count)\")\n    print(f\"This would be: ({base_health} * {expert_mode_multiplier}) * (1 + 0.35 * infinity), which tends to infinity.\")\n    print(\"\\nHowever, the game's source code caps all NPC health at the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is the value of this engine cap:\")\n    \n    # Final Output\n    print(f\"Theoretical Maximum Health = {health_cap}\")\n\nsolve_terraria_health_cap()\n```\n<<<2147483647>>>"
