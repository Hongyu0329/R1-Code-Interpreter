    "Based on my research, the user's question is based on a misunderstanding. Goodluck Jonathan's full name from birth is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan. \"Azikiwe\" is his last name, not a name he adopted later. Therefore, there is no specific year in which he began to \"publicly identify himself as azikiwe\" because it has always been his name.\n\nI will provide a Python script that clarifies this information. The script will print out a detailed explanation addressing the premise of your question.\n\n```python\ndef get_name_information():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides information about Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan's name.\n    \"\"\"\n    name_fact = \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan is the full birth name of the former President of Nigeria.\"\n    explanation = \"Contrary to the premise of the question, 'Azikiwe' is not a name he adopted or started using at a specific point in his public life. It is his given last name.\"\n    conclusion = \"Therefore, there is no specific year when he 'publicly identified' himself as Azikiwe; it has been part of his name since his birth on November 20, 1957.\"\n\n    print(name_fact)\n    print(explanation)\n    print(conclusion)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_name_information()\n```\n<<<There is no record of a specific year for this event, as \"Azikiwe\" is part of Goodluck Jonathan's birth name, not a name he adopted later in life.>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
