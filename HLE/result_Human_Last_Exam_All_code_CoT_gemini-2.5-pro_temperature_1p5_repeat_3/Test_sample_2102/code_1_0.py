# Part 1: Find the value of n
# Let g(x) = (2/pi) * K(x) * exp(x), where K(x) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.
# Let the Taylor series of g(x) around x=0 be sum(c_k * x^k).
# The Schur matrix S_n is an n x n upper triangular matrix where S_ij = c_{j-i}.
# The eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are its diagonal entries.
# The diagonal entries of S_n are all S_ii = c_{i-i} = c_0.
# c_0 is the value of g(x) at x=0.
# The complete elliptic integral of the first kind at 0 is K(0) = pi/2.
# So, c_0 = (2/pi) * K(0) * exp(0) = (2/pi) * (pi/2) * 1 = 1.
# W_n is the Weyr form of S_n and has the same eigenvalues.
# So, the n eigenvalues of W_n are all 1.
# f(n) is the sum of the absolute cubes of the eigenvalues of W_n.
# Therefore, f(n) = sum(|1|^3 for _ in 1..n) = n.
# We are looking for the smallest integer n such that f(n) > 10.
# This means we need the smallest integer n > 10.
n = 11

print(f"Step 1: The smallest integer n where f(n) > 10 is found.")
print(f"The analysis of f(n) shows f(n) = n. The condition is n > 10, so n = {n}.")

# Part 2: Determine the structure of W_n and its infinity norm
# The Jordan form structure of S_n depends on the nullities of (S_n - lambda*I)^k.
# Here, the only eigenvalue is lambda = 1.
# The number of Jordan blocks is the dimension of the null space of (S_n - I).
# The matrix S_n - I is an upper triangular Toeplitz matrix with 0 on the main diagonal
# and the Taylor coefficients c_1, c_2, ... on the superdiagonals.
# The first superdiagonal consists of c_1. We need to calculate c_1 = g'(0).
# g'(x) = d/dx [(2/pi) * K(x) * exp(x)] = (2/pi) * [K'(x)exp(x) + K(x)exp(x)].
# The Taylor series of K(x) has only even powers, so K(x) is an even function.
# Its derivative K'(x) is an odd function, which means K'(0) = 0.
# So, c_1 = g'(0) = (2/pi) * [0 + K(0)] = (2/pi) * (pi/2) = 1.
# Since c_1 is non-zero, the matrix S_n - I has rank n-1.
# The dimension of the null space is n - rank = n - (n-1) = 1.
# This implies there is only one Jordan block for the eigenvalue 1.
# A matrix with one Jordan block per eigenvalue is nonderogatory. For such a matrix,
# the Weyr canonical form W_n is the transpose of its Jordan canonical form J_n(1).
# So, for n=11, W_11 is an 11x11 lower bidiagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal and the first subdiagonal.

W_n = np.diag(np.ones(n)) + np.diag(np.ones(n - 1), k=-1)

# The infinity norm is the maximum of the absolute row sums.
# For W_n, the first row sum is 1, and all other row sums are 1+1=2.
inf_norm = np.linalg.norm(W_n, ord=np.inf)

print(f"The infinity norm ||W_{n}||_inf is {inf_norm}.")
