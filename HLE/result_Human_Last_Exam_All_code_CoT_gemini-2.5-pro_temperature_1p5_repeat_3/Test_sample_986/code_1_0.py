    """
    This function demonstrates the theoretical proof for the clique number
    by running a search on a finite sample of a graph with the given properties.

    The overall problem can be broken down as follows:
    1. D is the set of real numbers with the usual order <=.
    2. G is a directed graph with vertices as the real numbers and a directed edge (u, v) if u < v.
    3. X is the line graph of G. Its vertices are the edges of G. So a vertex in X is a pair (u, v) with u < v.
    4. Two vertices in X, m1 = (u1, v1) and m2 = (u2, v2), are adjacent if they meet head-to-tail,
       meaning the head of one is the tail of the other. This translates to the condition: (v1 == u2) or (v2 == u1).
    
    The theoretical proof shows that any attempt to form a 3-clique {m1, m2, m3} leads to a contradiction.
    For example, if m1=(a,b), m2=(b,c), m3=(c,a), it implies a < b < c < a, which is impossible.
    This code verifies this by failing to find any 3-cliques in a sample space.
