    "The reaction involves 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene and an excess of phenyl magnesium bromide, which is a Grignard reagent. To determine the product and its IUPAC name, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reactants and Conditions**: The substrate is an aromatic ring with three halogen atoms (one iodine, two bromines). The reagent is phenyl magnesium bromide, a strong nucleophile. The reaction is run with an \"excess\" of the reagent and heated to reflux, which are forcing conditions that promote reaction at all possible sites.\n\n2.  **Predict the Reaction**: Grignard reagents react with aryl halides to replace the halogen atom with the Grignard's organic group (in this case, a phenyl group). The reactivity of the halogens as leaving groups is I > Br > Cl.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product**: Given the excess reagent and heat, all halogen atoms will be substituted. The iodo group at position 2 and the bromo groups at positions 1 and 3 will all be replaced by phenyl groups. This results in a product with a central benzene ring attached to three phenyl groups at the 1, 2, and 3 positions.\n\n4.  **Name the Product**: The parent molecule is benzene. It has three phenyl substituents. The prefix for three is \"tri-\". The locants (positions) are 1, 2, and 3. Combining these elements gives the IUPAC name.\n\nThe following Python code uses this logic to construct the final IUPAC name.\n\n```python\ndef find_product_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the IUPAC name for the product of the described reaction\n    by applying chemical principles of Grignard reactions.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
