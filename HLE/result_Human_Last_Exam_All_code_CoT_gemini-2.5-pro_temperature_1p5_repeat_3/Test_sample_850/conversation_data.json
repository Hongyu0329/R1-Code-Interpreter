    "This is an interesting question that touches on the fundamental principles of crystal symmetry. The properties of being achiral, non-polar, and optically active are defined by the presence or absence of specific symmetry elements within a crystal's point group. Let's break down the conditions:\n\n1.  **Optical Activity**: This property requires a crystal structure to be **chiral**. Chiral structures lack a center of inversion (i) and any mirror planes (m). Light interacts with them differently than with their mirror image, causing the rotation of polarized light.\n2.  **Achiral**: This is the opposite of chiral. An achiral crystal structure **must** possess an improper rotation axis, which includes either a center of inversion or a mirror plane.\n3.  **Non-polar**: A crystal class is non-polar if it is centrosymmetric, meaning it **must** possess a center of inversion.\n\nAs you can see, there is a fundamental contradiction. For a crystal class to be optically active, it must lack a center of inversion. For it to be non-polar, it must possess a center of inversion. A crystal class cannot simultaneously possess and lack a center of inversion. Therefore, no such crystal class exists.\n\nThe following Python script will demonstrate this by defining the sets of crystal classes for each property and showing that their intersection is empty.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef find_contradictory_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies crystal classes based on symmetry properties to find\n    any that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active simultaneously.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # According to crystallography, a crystal class is optically active if and only if it is chiral.\n    # These classes lack a center of inversion and mirror planes.\n    optically_active_classes = {\n        '1', '2', '3', '4', '6', '222', '32', '422', '622', '23', '432'\n    }\n\n    # A class is non-polar if it is centrosymmetric (possesses a center of inversion).\n    non_polar_classes = {\n        '-1', '2/m', 'mmm', '-3', '-3m', '4/m', '4/mmm', '6/m', '6/mmm', 'm-3', 'm-3m'\n    }\n\n    # A class is achiral if it is NOT chiral (i.e., it possesses a center of inversion or a mirror plane).\n    # We can define all 32 classes and subtract the chiral (optically active) ones.\n    all_32_crystal_classes = {\n        '1', '-1', '2', 'm', '2/m', '222', 'mm2', 'mmm',\n        '4', '-4', '4/m', '422', '4mm', '-42m', '4/mmm',\n        '3', '-3', '32', '3m', '-3m',\n        '6', '-6', '6/m', '622', '6mm', '-6m2', '6/mmm',\n        '23', 'm-3', '432', '-43m', 'm-3m'\n    }\n    achiral_classes = all_32_crystal_classes - optically_active_classes\n\n    # --- Analysis ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the required sets of crystal classes based on symmetry.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    print(\"Set A: Achiral Classes (must have mirror or inversion center)\")\n    print(textwrap.fill(str(sorted(list(achiral_classes))), width=70))\n    print(\"\\nSet B: Non-polar Classes (must have inversion center)\")\n    print(textwrap.fill(str(sorted(list(non_polar_classes))), width=70))\n    print(\"\\nSet C: Optically Active Classes (must NOT have mirror or inversion center)\")\n    print(textwrap.fill(str(sorted(list(optically_active_classes))), width=70))\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Find the intersection of all three sets.\n    # The equation is: Result = A \\u2229 B \\u2229 C\n    result = achiral_classes.intersection(non_polar_classes).intersection(optically_active_classes)\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Find the intersection of all three sets.\")\n    print(\"Equation: Result = (Achiral \\u2229 Non-polar \\u2229 Optically Active)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(f\"Number of classes in Achiral set: {len(achiral_classes)}\")\n    print(f\"Number of classes in Non-polar set: {len(non_polar_classes)}\")\n    print(f\"Number of classes in Optically Active set: {len(optically_active_classes)}\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Result of Intersection:\")\n    if not result:\n        print(\"The resulting set is empty: {}\")\n    else:\n        print(result)\n\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    conclusion_text = (\n        \"There are no crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, \"\n        \"and optically active.
