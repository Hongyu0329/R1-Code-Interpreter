    "My plan is to solve the problem by first correctly interpreting the question. The phrase \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\" is unusual. It is highly likely that \"vertices\" is a typo for \"graphs\". Under this interpretation, the problem becomes a classic one in graph theory: finding the minimum number of bipartite subgraphs whose edges cover a complete graph \\( K_n \\). This is also known as the biclique cover number of \\(K_n\\).\n\nHere are the steps to solve this problem:\n1.  The problem is equivalent to finding the smallest integer \\(k\\) such that we can assign a unique binary vector of length \\(k\\) to each of the \\(n\\) vertices.\n2.  Let the \\(n\\) vertices of \\(K_n\\) be \\(v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\\). Let the \\(k\\) bipartite graphs be \\(G_1, G_2, ..., G_k\\).\n3.  For each graph \\(G_i\\), the vertices of \\(K_n\\) can be split into two sets for its bipartition. Let's call them \\(A_i\\) and \\(B_i\\).\n4.  We can associate a \\(k\\)-bit binary vector with each vertex. For a vertex \\(v\\), its vector \\((c_1, c_2, ..., c_k)\\) is defined by having \\(c_i=0\\) if \\(v \\in A_i\\) and \\(c_i=1\\) if \\(v \\in B_i\\).\n5.  For any edge \\((u,v)\\) in \\(K_n\\) to be covered, there must be some graph \\(G_i\\) where \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are in different partition sets. This means their binary vectors must differ in the \\(i\\)-th position.\n6.  Therefore, to cover all edges, every pair of vertices must have distinct binary vectors.\n7.  Since there are \\(n\\) vertices, we need \\(n\\) distinct binary vectors of length \\(k\\). The total number of distinct \\(k\\)-bit vectors is \\(2^k\\).\n8.  This leads to the inequality \\(2^k \\ge n\\), which simplifies to \\(k \\ge \\log_2(n)\\).\n9.  Since \\(k\\) must be an integer, the minimum value is \\(k = \\lceil \\log_2(n) \\rceil\\).\n10. I will now provide a Python script to calculate this value for \\(n=35\\). The script will print out the reasoning and the result of each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_graph_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover\n    the edges of a complete graph K_n.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 35\n\n    # The problem, interpreted as finding the minimum number of bipartite graphs\n    # to cover K_n, has a solution given by the formula ceil(log2(n)).\n    # We will now calculate this for n=35.\n\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the minimum number of bipartite graphs to cover the complete graph K_n for n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"The formula for this minimum number is ceil(log2(n)).\")\n    print(f\"\\nLet's calculate for n = {n}:\")\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate log base 2 of n\n    log2_n = math.log2(n)\n    print(f\"1.
