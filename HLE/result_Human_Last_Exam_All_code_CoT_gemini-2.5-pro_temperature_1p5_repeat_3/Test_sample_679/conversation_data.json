    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure and IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula\nThe molecular formula is C7H14. For a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon, the formula would be CnH(2n+2), which for n=7 is C7H16. The given formula has two fewer hydrogens, indicating one degree of unsaturation. This could be one double bond or one ring.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹³C NMR Data\nThe spectrum provides the following signals with their chemical shifts (in ppm) and multiplicities (s=singlet, d=doublet, t=triplet, q=quartet):\n*   **145(s):** A singlet in the alkene region (>100 ppm) indicates a quaternary sp² carbon (a carbon in a double bond with no attached hydrogens, `>C=`).\n*   **112(t):** A triplet in the alkene region indicates a methylene sp² carbon (a carbon in a double bond with two attached hydrogens, `=CH₂`).\n*   The presence of these two signals strongly suggests the molecule is an alkene containing a `>C=CH₂` group. This accounts for the degree of unsaturation.\n*   **48(t):** A triplet for an sp³ methylene carbon (`-CH₂-`).\n*   **27(d):** A doublet for an sp³ methine carbon (`-CH-`).\n*   **22(q):** A quartet for an sp³ methyl carbon (`-CH₃`).\n*   **21(q):** Another quartet for a different sp³ methyl carbon (`-CH₃`).\n\n### Step 3: Propose a Structure and Verify\nThe molecule has 7 carbons, but only 6 NMR signals are observed. The hint \"there may be signal overlapping\" suggests that two carbons have the same chemical shift.\n\nLet's propose a structure that fits the fragments we've identified and see if it matches the signal count. The most plausible structure that connects all fragments is **2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene**.\n\nLet's examine its structure:\n```\n      CH₃ (b)\n      |\n H₂C = C -- CH -- CH₃ (a)\n (e)  |    (c)\n      |\n      CH₂ -- CH₃ (g)\n      (f)\n```\nLet's predict the number of signals for this structure:\n1.  **C(d):** The quaternary carbon in the double bond. It is unique. -> 1 singlet (s).\n2.  **C(e):** The terminal `=CH₂` carbon. It is unique. -> 1 triplet (t).\n3.  **C(f):** The `-CH₂-` of the ethyl group. It is unique. -> 1 triplet (t).\n4.  **C(c):** The `-CH-` carbon. It is a chiral center, and it is unique. -> 1 doublet (d).\n5.  **C(a) & C(b):** These are the two methyl groups attached to the chiral center C(c). They are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. -> 2 quartets (q).\n6.  **C(g):** The methyl group of the ethyl substituent. It is in a different environment from C(a) and C(b). -> 1 quartet (q).\n\nIn total, this structure is predicted to have 7 distinct signals: 1s, 2t, 1d, 3q.\n\n### Step 4: Reconcile Prediction with Data using the Hint\nOur predicted spectrum (1s, 2t, 1d, 3q) is very close to the observed spectrum (1s, 2t, 1d, 2q). The discrepancy is one quartet signal.\nThe hint \"there may be signal overlapping\" explains this difference. It is very common for carbons in very similar chemical environments, such as the two diastereotopic methyl groups C(a) and C(b), to have nearly identical chemical shifts, causing their signals to overlap into a single observable peak.\n\nTherefore, the two observed quartet signals at 22 and 21 ppm correspond to the three methyl groups in the molecule.\n\n### Step 5: Final Assignment and Naming\n*   **145(s):** C(d), quaternary carbon of the alkene `(>C=)`.\n*   **112(t):** C(e), methylene carbon of the alkene `(=CH₂)`.\n*   **48(t):** C(f), methylene carbon of the ethyl group `(-CH₂-)`.\n*   **27(d):** C(c), methine carbon `(-CH-)`.\n*   **22(q) & 21(q):** These two signals account for the three methyl groups (C(a), C(b), and C(g)), with two of them overlapping.\n\nThe IUPAC name for the structure is **2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the step-by-step reasoning to identify the compound\n    with molecular formula C7H14 from its 13C NMR data.\n    \"\"\"\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_data = {\n        145: \"s\",\n        112: \"t\",\n        48: \"t\",\n        27: \"d\",\n        22: \"q\",\n        21: \"q\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Step-by-Step Analysis ---\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze molecular formula\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Analyze Molecular Formula\")\n    print(f\"The molecular formula is {molecular_formula}.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to a general formula of CnH2n, indicating one degree of unsaturation (a double bond or a ring).\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze 13C NMR Data\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Analyze 13C NMR Data\")\n    print(\"The 13C NMR data shows 6 signals:\")\n    print(\"145 ppm (s): A quaternary sp2 carbon (>C=).\")\n    print(\"112 ppm (t): A methylene sp2 carbon (=CH2).\")\n    print(\"The signals at 145(s) and 112(t) confirm the presence of a C=C double bond, specifically a >C=CH2 group.\")\n    print(\"The remaining signals are from sp3 carbons:\")\n    print(\"48 ppm (t): A methylene carbon (-CH2-).\")\n    print(\"27 ppm (d): A methine carbon (-CH-).\")\n    print(\"22 ppm (q): A methyl carbon (-CH3).\")\n    print(\"21 ppm (q): Another methyl carbon (-CH3).\")\n\n    # Step 3: Propose and verify structure\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Propose and Verify Structure\")\n    print(\"The molecule has 7 carbons but only 6 signals, which means two carbons are represented by a single peak.\")\n    print(\"The structure that fits all these fragments is 2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene.\")\n    print(\"This structure should theoretically have 7 unique carbon signals (1s, 2t, 1d, 3q).\")\n    print(\"The observed spectrum has 6 signals (1s, 2t, 1d, 2q).\")\n\n    # Step 4: Reconcile with data\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Reconcile Prediction with Data\")\n    print(\"The discrepancy is resolved by the hint about signal overlapping.\")\n    print(\"The three methyl groups in the structure are chemically distinct, but two of them (the ones on the chiral center) are in very similar environments.\")\n    print(\"It is highly likely that two of the three methyl signals overlap, resulting in only two observable quartet peaks.\")\n\n    # Step 5: Final assignments and name\n    print(\"\\nStep 5: Final Assignment and Naming\")\n    print(\"The assignments for the proposed structure are:\")\n    print(f\"{'145 ppm (s):':<15} Quaternary C of alkene (>C=)\")\n    print(f\"{'112 ppm (t):':<15} Methylene C of alkene (=CH2)\")\n    print(f\"{'48 ppm (t):':<15} Methylene C of the ethyl group (-CH2-)\")\n    print(f\"{'27 ppm (d):':<15} Methine C (-CH-)\")\n    print(f\"{'22 & 21 ppm (q):':<15} Three methyl C's (-CH3), with two overlapping\")\n    \n    final_iupac_name = \"2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene\"\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the IUPAC name of the compound is:\")\n    print(final_iupac_name)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_nmr_puzzle()\n```\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene>>>"
