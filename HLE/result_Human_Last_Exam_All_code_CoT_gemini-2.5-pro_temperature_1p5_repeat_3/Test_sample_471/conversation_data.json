    "This problem asks for the minimal number of critical points of a smooth function on a 2-torus, $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$. This is a classic problem in topology and differential geometry, and the answer can be found using Morse theory.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  **Introduce Morse Theory:** The theory relates the number of critical points of a smooth function on a manifold to the manifold's topological properties.\n2.  **Identify Topological Invariants:** The key topological invariants are the Betti numbers ($b_k$), which count the number of \"holes\" of different dimensions in the manifold. I will determine the Betti numbers for the 2-torus ($T^2$).\n3.  **Apply Morse Inequalities:** A fundamental result of Morse theory is that the number of critical points of index $k$, denoted $c_k$, is at least the $k$-th Betti number ($c_k \\geq b_k$). This gives a lower bound for the total number of critical points.\n4.  **Calculate the Minimum:** I will sum the Betti numbers to find the theoretical minimum number of critical points.\n5.  **Confirm Achievability:** I will argue that this minimum is achievable by providing an example of a function on the torus that has exactly this number of critical points.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** The final Python code will print this step-by-step reasoning and compute the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_critical_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"To find the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function f: T^2 -> R on a 2-torus, we use Morse theory.\")\n    print(\"Morse theory provides a powerful connection between the number of critical points of a function and the topology of its domain.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Determine the Betti numbers of the 2-torus (T^2).\")\n    print(\"The Betti numbers (b_k) describe the topology of a space by counting its k-dimensional holes.\")\n    \n    # Betti numbers for the 2-torus\n    b_0 = 1  # Number of connected components\n    b_1 = 2  # Number of independent loops (1-dimensional holes)\n    b_2 = 1  # Number of enclosed voids (2-dimensional holes)\n    \n    print(f\" - b_0(T^2) = {b_0} (the torus is a single connected piece)\")\n    print(f\" - b_1(T^2) = {b_1} (the 'longitudinal' and 'latitudinal' circles)\")\n    print(f\" - b_2(T^2) = {b_2} (the interior void of the torus)\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Apply the Morse inequalities.\")\n    print(\"A key result from Morse theory is that for any smooth function on a compact manifold, the number of critical points of index k (c_k) must be at least the k-th Betti number (b_k).\")\n    print(\"c_k >= b_k\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the total number of critical points (C) has a lower bound given by the sum of the Betti numbers.\")\n    print(\"C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2 >= b_0 + b_1 + b_2\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the minimal number of critical points.\")\n    min_critical_points = b_0 + b_1 + b_2\n    print(\"This gives us a theoretical minimum:\")\n    print(f\"Minimal number >= {b_0} + {b_1} + {b_2} = {min_critical_points}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Confirm that this minimum is achievable.\")\n    print(\"This lower bound is indeed the minimum because there exist functions on the torus with exactly this many critical points.\")\n    print(\"A classic example is the height function on a torus lying 'on its side' in 3D space.
