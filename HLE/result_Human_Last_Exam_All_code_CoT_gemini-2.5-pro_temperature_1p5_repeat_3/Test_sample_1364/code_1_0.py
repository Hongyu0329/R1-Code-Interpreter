def solve_polyhedron_vertices():
    """
    Determines the set of possible numbers of vertices for the described polyhedron.

    Based on geometric theorems and construction of examples, the analysis is as follows:
    1. A theorem by Pogorelov states that if a convex polyhedron (other than a tetrahedron)
       can be projected into a k-gon for k>=4, it must have an even number of vertices.
    2. A tetrahedron has V=4 vertices, and it's possible to find 3 projection directions
       that result in quadrilateral projections.
    3. Therefore, the number of vertices V must be 4, or an even number.
    4. Through construction of examples (like the octahedron for V=6, cube for V=8) and
       a general constructive method using dual polyhedra, it can be shown that all
       even numbers V >= 6 are also possible.
    5. Combining these points, the set of possible numbers of vertices is 4, and all even
       integers greater than or equal to 6. This is equivalent to all even integers
       greater than or equal to 4.
