# The Act III solo of Frederick Ashton's "Sylvia", known as the Pizzicato variation,
# contains a set number of gargouillade steps. The choreography for this famous
# solo includes two sets of this specific jump.

# Number of gargouillades in the first sequence of the solo
first_sequence = 2

# Number of gargouillades in the second sequence of the solo
second_sequence = 2

# The total is the sum of the two sequences.
total_gargouillades = first_sequence + second_sequence
