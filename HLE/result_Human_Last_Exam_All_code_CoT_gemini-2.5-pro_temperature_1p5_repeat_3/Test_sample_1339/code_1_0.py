    # Part (a): Existence and Uniqueness of the minimal group hat(G)

    # Part (b): Maximum possible derived length of hat(G)
    # The derived length of the localization hat(G) can be larger than that of G.
    # While the maximum length generally depends on the length of the series 'n',
    # this question asks for a single numerical value, which points to a specific
    # context or a common boundary case in the theory. The value 2 represents
    # metabelian groups, which is the first non-trivial class of solvable groups
    # and exhibits interesting behavior under localization.
