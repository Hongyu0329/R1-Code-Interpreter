    # Part 1: Analyze f and find h.
    # The probability of traversing f, P(f), follows the equation: P(f) = x + (1-x) * P(f)^2.
    # Rearranging gives a quadratic equation with two roots for P(f): 1 and x/(1-x).
    # The actual probability converges to the smaller root, min(1, x/(1-x)).
    # For the traversal to be "guaranteed", P(f) must be 1. This occurs when x/(1-x) >= 1,
    # which simplifies to x >= 0.5.
    # h is the smallest value of x that guarantees this, so h = 0.5.

    # For g, p1 (direct path) = h = 0.5. The remaining probability is 0.5.
