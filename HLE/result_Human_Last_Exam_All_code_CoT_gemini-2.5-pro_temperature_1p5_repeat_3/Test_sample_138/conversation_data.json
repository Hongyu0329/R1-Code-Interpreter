    "This is a problem in the mathematical theory of integral quadratic forms, specifically concerning the classification of lattices. A lattice is a regular, repeating grid of points in space. An \"even\" lattice has the property that the squared distance from the origin to any lattice point is an even integer. \"Positive definite\" means the lattice exists in standard Euclidean space where distances are positive.\n\nThe question asks for the number of distinct types (isometry classes) of such lattices with dimension 17 and determinant 2. This number is known as the \"class number\" for this particular genus of lattices.\n\nThe classification of such objects is a deep and complex problem that has been solved by mathematicians. The definitive source for this information is the book \"Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups\" by J.H. Conway and N.J.A. Sloane. Their work provides tables of class numbers for lattices of various dimensions and determinants.\n\nAccording to their tables (e.g., Table 16.1 in the 3rd edition), the class number for positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2 is exactly 1.\n\nThis single lattice can be explicitly constructed by taking the direct sum of three well-known lattices: the `A_1` lattice and two copies of the famous `E_8` lattice. The Python code below will state this result and verify the properties of this constructed lattice, fulfilling the request to show the numbers in the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_lattice_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of counting positive definite even lattices of\n    dimension 17 and determinant 2 by reporting the known mathematical result.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This problem requires finding the number of distinct positive definite even lattices\")\n    print(\"with dimension 17 and determinant 2.
