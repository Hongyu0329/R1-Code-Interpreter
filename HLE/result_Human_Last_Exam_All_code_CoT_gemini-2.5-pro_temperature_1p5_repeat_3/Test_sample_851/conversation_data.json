    "To identify the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active, we need to understand the crystallographic symmetry requirements for each property.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the criteria:**\n    *   **Optical Activity:** A crystal is optically active if it can rotate the plane of polarized light. This property is forbidden in any crystal class that possesses a center of inversion (`-1`). Additionally, two non-centrosymmetric classes, `-6` and `-62m`, are also known to be non-optically active. All other non-centrosymmetric classes can exhibit optical activity.\n    *   **Achiral:** An object is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image. In crystallography, a crystal class is achiral if it contains a mirror plane (`m`) or any improper rotation axis (`-n`), including a center of inversion (`-1`). Chiral classes are those that lack all these elements.\n    *   **Non-polar:** A crystal is polar if it has a unique directional axis where one end is not equivalent to the other by any symmetry operation in the class. We will use the standard list of 10 polar crystal classes to identify the non-polar ones.\n\n2.  **Filter the 32 crystal classes:**\n    *   Start with the set of all 32 crystallographic point groups.\n    *   First, we will find all classes that are capable of optical activity by removing all centrosymmetric classes and the two exceptions (`-6`, `-62m`).\n    *   Next, we will apply the \"achiral\" condition by removing all chiral classes from the remaining set.\n    *   Finally, we will apply the \"non-polar\" condition by removing all polar classes from the result.\n\n3.  **Implement in Python:**\n    *   The Python script will define sets for each category of crystal classes (e.g., centrosymmetric, chiral, polar).\n    *   It will perform set operations to apply the filters described above.\n    *   The script will print the resulting set of crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions.\n    *   Finally, it will evaluate the given multiple-choice options against this derived set to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar,\n    and optically active by filtering the 32 point groups based on symmetry rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The 32 crystallographic point groups\n    all_classes = {\n        '1', '-1', '2', 'm', '2/m', '222', 'mm2', 'mmm',\n        '3', '-3', '32', '3m', '-3m', '4', '-4', '4/m',\n        '422', '4mm', '-42m', '4/mmm', '6', '-6', '6/m',\n        '622', '6mm', '-62m', '6/mmm', '23', 'm-3', '432',\n        '-43m', 'm-3m'\n    }\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define properties based on symmetry ---\n\n    # Centrosymmetric classes have a center of inversion and are never optically active.\n    centrosymmetric = {\n        '-1', '2/m', 'mmm', '4/m', '4/mmm', '-3', '-3m',\n        '6/m', '6/mmm', 'm-3', 'm-3m'\n    }\n\n    # Two non-centrosymmetric classes are also not optically active.\n    non_optically_active_exceptions = {'-6', '-62m'}\n\n    # Chiral classes lack mirror planes and improper rotation axes.
