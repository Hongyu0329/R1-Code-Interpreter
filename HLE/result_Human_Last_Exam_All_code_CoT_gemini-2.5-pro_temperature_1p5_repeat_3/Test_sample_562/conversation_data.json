    "My plan to identify the radical of the character 謄 is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the character 謄.\n2.  I will break down the character into its constituent parts to determine which one is the radical (bushu). The character 謄 is composed of the left part 言 and the right part 朕.\n3.  In characters like this, the left part is typically the radical used for dictionary lookups. The radical is 言.\n4.  The name for the 言 radical when it appears on the left side of a character is \"gonben\" (ごんべん).\n5.  Finally, I will provide the Hepburn romanization of \"gonben\", which is \"Gonben\". I will write a Python script to print this name.\n\n```python\n# The Japanese character is 謄.\n# This character can be broken down into two main components: 言 (gon) on the left and 朕 (chin) on the right.\n# The radical, used for dictionary classification, is the left part: 言.\n# The name for the 言 radical when it's on the left side of a character is \"gonben\" (ごんべん).\n# The Hepburn transcription for \"gonben\" is \"Gonben\".\nprint(\"Gonben\")\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
