# This script solves for the value of 'n' based on the properties of a 'tame' functor
# as described in the problem statement.

# The solution is derived from the standard classification of representation types in algebra.
# A 'tame' representation problem is one where the indecomposable representations
# can be classified by at most one continuous parameter.
# The term 'n-resolvable' is interpreted as referring to this number of parameters.
# Since the functor F is tame, n must be 1.

# The equation is therefore n = 1.
n = 1

# The problem asks that we output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation is n = 1. The number in this equation is 1.
