    "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that can be packed into a 15x15x15 cube. A simple volume calculation (Volume of cube / Volume of block = 3375 / 9 = 375) gives an upper bound, but it doesn't account for the geometric constraints of packing.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this packing problem:\n1.  I will use a greedy strategy. This involves filling the space with blocks in one orientation, then filling the remaining space with blocks in another orientation, and so on.\n2.  **Step 1:** I'll start by packing as many blocks as possible with their 9-unit length aligned with the cube's x-axis. I will calculate the number of blocks that fit and the dimensions of the leftover space.\n3.  **Step 2:** I will take the leftover space from the first step and pack as many blocks as possible with their 9-unit length aligned with the y-axis. Again, I will calculate the number of blocks and the new leftover space.\n4.  **Step 3:** I will take the remaining space from the second step and pack blocks with their 9-unit length aligned with the z-axis.\n5.  **Step 4:** Finally, I'll sum the number of blocks from all steps to get the total. The remaining space will be checked to ensure no more blocks can be fitted.\n\nThis step-by-step approach of partitioning the space and filling each partition optimally is an effective way to solve this kind of problem.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_packing_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that fit in a 15x15x15 cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define dimensions\n    cube_dim = (15, 15, 15)\n    block_dim = (9, 1, 1)\n\n    print(\"Calculating the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks in a 15x15x15 cube.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 1: Pack along the X-axis ---\n    # Pack blocks oriented as (9, 1, 1) into the 15x15x15 space.\n    space1 = cube_dim\n    orientation1 = block_dim\n    \n    num_fit1 = (math.floor(space1[0] / orientation1[0]) *\n                math.floor(space1[1] / orientation1[1]) *\n                math.floor(space1[2] / orientation1[2]))\n    \n    print(f\"Step 1: Packing blocks with orientation {orientation1} into a {space1[0]}x{space1[1]}x{space1[2]} space.\")\n    print(f\"Number of blocks = floor({space1[0]}/{orientation1[0]}) * floor({space1[1]}/{orientation1[1]}) * floor({space1[2]}/{orientation1[2]}) = {num_fit1}\")\n    \n    # Calculate the remaining space\n    space2_x = space1[0] - math.floor(space1[0] / orientation1[0]) * orientation1[0]\n    space2_y = space1[1]\n    space2_z = space1[2]\n    space2 = (space2_x, space2_y, space2_z)\n    print(f\"This leaves a remaining space of {space2[0]}x{space2[1]}x{space2[2]}.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Pack along the Y-axis in the remaining space ---\n    # Pack blocks oriented as (1, 9, 1) into the 6x15x15 space.\n    orientation2 = (block_dim[1], block_dim[0], block_dim[2])\n\n    num_fit2 = (math.floor(space2[0] / orientation2[0]) *\n                math.floor(space2[1] / orientation2[1]) *\n                math.floor(space2[2] / orientation2[2]))\n    \n    print(f\"Step 2: Packing blocks with orientation {orientation2} into the {space2[0]}x{space2[1]}x{space2[2]} space.\")\n    print(f\"Number of blocks = floor({space2[0]}/{orientation2[0]}) * floor({space2[1]}/{orientation2[1]}) * floor({space2[2]}/{orientation2[2]}) = {num_fit2}\")\n\n    # Calculate the new remaining space\n    space3_x = space2[0]\n    space3_y = space2[1] - math.floor(space2[1] / orientation2[1]) * orientation2[1]\n    space3_z = space2[2]\n    space3 = (space3_x, space3_y, space3_z)\n    print(f\"This leaves a remaining space of {space3[0]}x{space3[1]}x{space3[2]}.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Pack along the Z-axis in the new remaining space ---\n    # Pack blocks oriented as (1, 1, 9) into the 6x6x15 space.\n    orientation3 = (block_dim[1], block_dim[2], block_dim[0])\n    \n    num_fit3 = (math.floor(space3[0] / orientation3[0]) *\n                math.floor(space3[1] / orientation3[1]) *\n                math.floor(space3[2] / orientation3[2]))\n    \n    print(f\"Step 3: Packing blocks with orientation {orientation3} into the {space3[0]}x{space3[1]}x{space3[2]} space.\")\n    print(f\"Number of blocks = floor({space3[0]}/{orientation3[0]}) * floor({space3[1]}/{orientation3[1]}) * floor({space3[2]}/{orientation3[2]}) = {num_fit3}\")\n\n    # Calculate the final remaining space\n    space4_x = space3[0]\n    space4_y = space3[1]\n    space4_z = space3[2] - math.floor(space3[2] / orientation3[2]) * orientation3[2]\n    print(f\"This leaves a final remaining space of {space4_x}x{space4_y}x{space4_z}, where no more blocks can fit.\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Final Calculation ---\n    total_blocks = num_fit1 + num_fit2 + num_fit3\n    print(\"Total number of blocks:\")\n    print(f\"{num_fit1} + {num_fit2} + {num_fit3} = {total_blocks}\")\n\nsolve_packing_problem()\n<<<351>>>"
