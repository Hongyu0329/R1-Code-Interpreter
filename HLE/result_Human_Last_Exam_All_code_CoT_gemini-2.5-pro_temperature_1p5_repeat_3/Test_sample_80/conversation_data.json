    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that calculates the answer step-by-step.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, I'll determine the total number of squares on the edge of a standard 8x8 chessboard.\n2.  Next, I'll figure out how the edge squares are divided between the two colors (light and dark).\n3.  Then, I'll explain the strategy for placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops. A key property of bishops is that they always stay on squares of the same color. This means we can place bishops on all edge squares of one color without any of them being able to attack each other.\n4.  Finally, I will calculate how many edge squares are left empty by subtracting the number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares after placing the maximum\n    number of non-attacking bishops on the edge of a chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    total_squares = board_size * board_size\n    inner_squares = (board_size - 2) * (board_size - 2)\n    edge_squares = total_squares - inner_squares\n\n    print(f\"An {board_size}x{board_size} chessboard has {edge_squares} edge squares.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the number of squares per color on the edge.\n    # On an empty board, the edge is composed of an equal number of light and dark squares.\n    edge_squares_per_color = edge_squares // 2\n\n    print(f\"These {edge_squares} edge squares are made up of {edge_squares_per_color} light squares and {edge_squares_per_color} dark squares.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops.\n    # Bishops only move on diagonals of their starting color.\n    # To place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, we can occupy all edge squares of a single color.\n    max_bishops_on_edge = edge_squares_per_color\n\n    print(f\"The maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge is {max_bishops_on_edge}.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the number of empty edge squares.\n    empty_edge_squares = edge_squares - max_bishops_on_edge\n\n    print(\"\\nTo find the number of edge squares that lack bishops, we subtract the number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares.\")\n    print(f\"The final calculation is: {edge_squares} - {max_bishops_on_edge} = {empty_edge_squares}\")\n\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\n<<<14>>>\n```"
