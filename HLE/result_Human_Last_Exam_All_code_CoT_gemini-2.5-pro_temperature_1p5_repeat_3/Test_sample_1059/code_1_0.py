def solve_closepact_problem():
    """
    Analyzes a list of topological sets to determine which are necessarily "closepact".

    The problem defines a "closepact" set using a property equivalent to H-closedness.
    For the spaces in question (subsets of real, complex, or rational numbers), they are
    all regular Hausdorff spaces. In such spaces, being H-closed is equivalent to being compact.
    
    Therefore, the task is to identify which sets are necessarily compact. For subsets of R and C,
    this means being closed and bounded (Heine-Borel theorem).
