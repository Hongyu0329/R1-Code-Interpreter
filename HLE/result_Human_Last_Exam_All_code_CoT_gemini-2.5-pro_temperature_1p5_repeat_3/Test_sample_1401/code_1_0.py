    """
    Calculates an example lower bound for the number of SQ queries.

    The problem is to learn a poly(d)-sized two-hidden-layer ReLU network.
    The theoretical lower bound for the number of queries is d^Ω(poly(d)).
    This means the number of queries grows faster than any polynomial of d.

    To illustrate this, we model the 'poly(d)' part with a simple polynomial.
    Let's assume the number of neurons k in the first hidden layer is a polynomial in d.
    For this example, we'll model k as k(d) = d^a.
    A known SQ lower bound for learning functions of k neurons is d^Ω(k).
    
    We will use a simplified version of this bound, Q(d) = d^k = d^(d^a),
    to demonstrate the magnitude.

        d (int): The dimension of the input space.
