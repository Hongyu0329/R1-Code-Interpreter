    "The user wants to know the number of colors for the pure allotropes of phosphorus. This is a knowledge-based question. I will write a Python script to list the common allotropes and their corresponding colors, and then count them.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will create a dictionary where keys are the names of the phosphorus allotropes and values are their colors.\n2.  I will then iterate through this dictionary to display each allotrope and its color.\n3.  To satisfy the requirement of showing the numbers in an equation, I will represent the count of each color as '1' and sum them up.\n4.  Finally, I will print the total number of distinct colors.\n\n```python\n# A python script to count the colors of phosphorus allotropes.\n\n# The main, well-characterized allotropes of phosphorus and their colors.\n# Note: White phosphorus is often called yellow phosphorus.\nphosphorus_colors = {\n    \"White (or Yellow) Phosphorus\": \"white/yellow\",\n    \"Red Phosphorus\": \"red\",\n    \"Violet Phosphorus\": \"violet\",\n    \"Black Phosphorus\": \"black\"\n}\n\n# Get the list of unique colors.\ncolors = list(phosphorus_colors.values())\ncount = len(colors)\n\nprint(\"The main pure allotropes of phosphorus exhibit several distinct colors:\")\nfor allotrope, color in phosphorus_colors.items():\n    print(f\"- {allotrope} is {color}.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nTo find the total, we can count each distinct color:\")\n\n# Create a simple sum equation (e.g., 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) to show the count.\n# This represents counting each of the colors listed.\nequation_numbers = ['1'] * count\nequation_string = \" + \".join(equation_numbers)\n\nprint(f\"Equation: {equation_string} = {count}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nTherefore, {count} distinct colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus.\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
