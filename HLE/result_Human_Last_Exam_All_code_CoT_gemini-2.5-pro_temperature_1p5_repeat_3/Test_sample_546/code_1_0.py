# The problem simplifies to calculating 2^81 based on number theory principles.
# The large prime p and complex expressions are designed to obscure this fact.
# The following code calculates this value.

base = 2
exponent = 81

# Calculate the result of base raised to the power of exponent
result = base ** exponent

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final simplified equation f(p) = 2^81
print(f"The simplified expression is {base}^{exponent}.")
print(f"The calculated value is: {result}")
