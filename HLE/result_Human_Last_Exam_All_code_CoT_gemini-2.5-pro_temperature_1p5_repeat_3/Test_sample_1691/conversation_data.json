    "For the given integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$, we want to find an analytical approximation for small positive $\\epsilon$.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the Dominant Contribution**: As $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the denominator $\\epsilon + P(x)$ (where $P(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$) becomes very small only when $P(x)$ is very small. On the interval $[0, 15.00]$, $P(x)$ is only zero at $x=0$. This means the integrand becomes a sharp peak at $x=0$, and the area under this peak gives the dominant contribution to the integral.\n\n2.  **Approximate the Integrand**: Near $x=0$, the polynomial $P(x)$ is dominated by its term with the lowest power of $x$. Therefore, we can approximate $P(x) \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$. This simplifies the integral to:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n\n3.  **Extend the Integration Limit**: The value of this approximate integral is mainly accumulated where $9.0x^{5.0}$ is of the same order as $\\epsilon$, i.e., in a very small region around $x=0$. The contribution from the rest of the interval up to $15.00$ is negligible for the leading-order term. We can, therefore, extend the upper limit of integration to infinity, as this simplifies the calculation without affecting the dominant asymptotic term.\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Integral**: The resulting integral is a standard form that can be solved analytically. Such integrals generally result in a formula of the type $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\cdot \\epsilon^{k}$.\n    Let's evaluate it with a substitution. Let $t^5 = \\frac{9.0 x^{5.0}}{\\epsilon}$.\n    This gives $x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{1/5} t$, and $dx = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{1/5} dt$.\n    Substituting these into the integral:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{1/5}}{\\epsilon + 9.0 \\left(\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{1/5} t\\right)^{5.0}} dt = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\epsilon/9.0)^{1/5}}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon t^5} dt$\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9.0^{1/5} \\cdot \\epsilon} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+t^5} dt = \\frac{\\epsilon^{-4/5}}{9.0^{1/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+t^5} dt$.\n    The exponent is $k = -4/5 = -0.8$.\n\n5.  **Use a Standard Integral Formula**: The definite integral $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+t^n} dt$ has a known value: $\\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$. For $n=5$, the value is $\\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\n6.  **Determine the Final Formula**: Combining these results, we get the coefficient $C$:\n    $C = \\frac{1}{9.0^{1/5}} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)} = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9.0^{1/5} \\cdot \\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n    The final analytical approximation is $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\cdot \\epsilon^{-4/5}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the numerical values for the coefficient $C$ and the exponent $k$ and prints the final formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_approximation_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the parameters for the analytical approximation of the integral\n    for the small epsilon regime. The formula is of the form I(epsilon) = C * epsilon^k.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The approximation is based on the lowest power term in the denominator's polynomial,\n    # which is 9.0 * x^5.0. Thus, n=5.0 and the coefficient is c_n=9.0.\n    n = 5.0\n    c_n = 9.0\n\n    # The exponent k in the approximation I(epsilon) ~ C * epsilon^k is given by k = (1 - n) / n.\n    k = (1.0 - n) / n\n\n    # The coefficient C is given by the formula C = pi / (n * c_n^(1/n) * sin(pi/n)).\n    C = math.pi / (n * math.pow(c_n, 1.0 / n) * math.sin(math.pi / n))\n\n    print(\"The analytical formula for the integral I(epsilon) for small epsilon is of the form:\")\n    print(\"I(epsilon) = C * epsilon^k\")\n    print(\"\\nThe values for the numbers in this equation are:\")\n    print(f\"C = {C}\")\n    print(f\"k = {k}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the final approximate formula is:\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) = {C:.5f} * epsilon^({k:.2f})\")\n\nget_approximation_formula()\n```\n<<<0.68887>>>"
