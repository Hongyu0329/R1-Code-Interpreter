    This function evaluates the truthfulness of statements about quantum mechanics symmetries.

    The analysis of each statement is as follows:
    A: False. The generator can be the momentum operator, which has a continuous spectrum.
    B1: True. Scale invariance, generated by τ̂, for a Hamiltonian H=T+V requires the potential V to be homogeneous of degree -2, i.e., V ∝ 1/r².
    B2: False. A direct calculation shows the scaling transformation is different from what is stated.
    C: False. [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0 is both necessary and sufficient for [Ŝ(θ), Ĥ] = 0 to hold for a continuous symmetry.
    D: True. As [Ŝ, Ĥ]=0 implies [τ̂, Ĥ]=0, τ̂ maps an energy eigenstate to another eigenstate of the same energy.
    E: True. This is a standard definition in physics, assuming units where ħ=1, which is implied by inconsistencies in the problem's notation otherwise.
    F: True. This is a direct consequence of the time-evolution equation for expectation values (Ehrenfest's theorem).
    G: True. The unitarity of the symmetry operator Ŝ implies the Hermiticity of its generator τ̂ (Stone's Theorem).
    H: False. Lz is an unbounded operator with a discrete spectrum, providing a counterexample.
    I: True. The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula shows that the simple exponential sum only holds if the generators commute, which is not the case here.
    J: True. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the symmetry operator Ŝ commutes with the Hamiltonian Ĥ.

    The true statements are B1, D, E, F, G, I, J.
