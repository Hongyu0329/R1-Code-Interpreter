    "This is a classic Chinese character riddle. The description builds the character component by component. Let's break it down:\n\n1.  **\"A wooden stick\"**: This refers to the single horizontal stroke '一' (yī). In this context, it represents a roof or a covering.\n2.  **\"hanging a square box\"**: Below the \"stick\" (一), there is a '口' (kǒu), which means mouth or opening. It represents a person with a mouth to feed.\n3.  **\"a ladder placed in the center\"**: The character '田' (tián), which means field, looks like a window pane, a grid, or a ladder. It represents the land to farm for food.\n\nThese three components (一, 口, 田) combine from top to bottom to form the character '畐' (fù). This character is the right-hand side of the final answer. When combined with the radical '礻' (shì) on the left, which is related to spirits or blessings, we get the complete character.\n\nThe Python code below will print out the components and construct the final character for you.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Ensure UTF-8 output for Chinese characters\nsys.stdout = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdout.buffer, encoding='utf-8')\n\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the Chinese character riddle by identifying\n    its components as described.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The riddle describes the right-hand side of the character.\n    part1_stick = \"一\"\n    part2_box = \"口\"\n    part3_ladder = \"田\"\n\n    # The left-hand side is a radical related to blessings.\n    radical = \"礻\"\n\n    # The final character is formed by combining the radical and the other components.\n    final_character = \"福\" # fú\n\n    print(\"The riddle describes the components of the character for 'good fortune':\")\n    print(f\"\\n1. 'A wooden stick' refers to the top part: {part1_stick}\")\n    print(f\"2. 'hanging a square box' refers to the middle part: {part2_box}\")\n    print(f\"3. 'a ladder placed in the center' refers to the bottom part: {part3_ladder}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThese three parts form the character '畐'.\")\n    print(\"When combined with the 'blessing' radical (礻), they form the final answer.\")\n\n    # Fulfilling the requirement to show each part in the final 'equation'.\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Character 'Equation': {radical} + {part1_stick} + {part2_box} + {part3_ladder}  =>  {final_character}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<福>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
