    "The problem asks for the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997). An involution is an element of order 2.\n\n### Step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the group properties:** The group is `G = PSU(n, q)` with `n=4` and `q=997`. `PSU(n, q)` is the quotient group `SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))`, where `SU(n, q)` is the special unitary group and `Z` is its center.\n2.  **Determine the center `Z`:** The center `Z(SU(n, q))` is cyclic of order `d = gcd(n, q+1)`. For our case, `n=4` and `q=997`, so `d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`. Thus, `Z = {I, -I}`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n3.  **Relate involutions in `PSU` to elements in `SU`:** An element `[g] = Zg` in `PSU(4, q)` is an involution if it's not the identity and `[g]^2 = [I]`. This means `g^2` must be in the center `Z`, and `g` must not be in `Z`.\n    *   `g^2 \\in {I, -I}`\n    *   `g \\notin {I, -I}`\n4.  **Count the pre-images in `SU(4, 997)`:** We need to count the number of elements `g` in `SU(4, 997)` that satisfy the conditions above.\n    *   **Case 1: `g^2 = I` and `g \\notin Z`**. Elements `g` with `g^2 = I` are the identity `I` and the involutions of `SU(4, q)`. The condition `g \\notin Z` means `g` is not `I` or `-I`. This corresponds to the set of non-central involutions in `SU(4, q)`. All such involutions in `SU(4,q)` belong to a single conjugacy class, and its size is `N_1 = q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1)`.\n    *   **Case 2: `g^2 = -I`**. Such elements are called quasi-involutions. If `g^2 = -I`, `g` cannot be `I` or `-I`, so `g \\notin Z` is automatically satisfied. These elements also form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4, q)`, and its size is `N_2 = q^4(q + 1)^2(q^2 - q + 1)`.\n5.  **Count the involutions in `PSU(4, 997)`:** The total number of pre-images `g` is `N_1 + N_2`. The projection map from `SU` to `PSU` maps the pair of distinct elements `{g, -g}` to a single element `[g]`. Both `g` and `-g` satisfy the conditions: if `g^2 \\in Z`, then `(-g)^2 = g^2 \\in Z`. Therefore, the number of involutions in `PSU(4, q)` is `(N_1 + N_2) / 2`.\n6.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    *   Number of involutions = `(q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1) + q^4(q + 1)^2(q^2 - q + 1)) / 2`\n    *   `= (q^4(q^2 - q + 1) / 2) * [(q^2 + 1) + (q + 1)^2]`\n    *   `= (q^4(q^2 - q + 1) / 2) * [q^2 + 1 + q^2 + 2q + 1]`\n    *   `= (q^4(q^2 - q + 1) / 2) * [2q^2 + 2q + 2]`\n    *   `= q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + q + 1)`\n    *   Using the difference of squares formula `(a-b)(a+b) = a^2-b^2` with `a = q^2+1` and `b=q`, this simplifies to:\n    *   `= q^4((q^2 + 1)^2 - q^2) = q^4(q^4 + 2q^2 + 1 - q^2) = q^4(q^4 + q^2 + 1)`\n7.  **Calculate the final number:** I will write a Python script to compute this value for `q=997` and print the result in the requested equation format.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The user wants to find the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n# The plan is to use the formula derived: N = q^4 * (q^4 + q^2 + 1).\n\nq = 997\n\n# Calculate the powers of q\nq2 = q**2\nq4 = q**4\n\n# Calculate the final result using the formula\n# N = q^4 * (q^4 + q^2 + 1)\nresult = q4 * (q4 + q2 + 1)\n\n# Print the result in the format of an equation\nprint(f\"The number of involutions is given by the formula q^4 * (q^4 + q^2 + 1) for q = 997.\")\nprint(f\"So we calculate: {q}^4 * ({q}^4 + {q}^2 + 1)\")\nprint(f\"Which is: {q4} * ({q4} + {q2} + 1)\")\nprint(f\"Result: {result}\")\n```\n<<<976239455648432313885671>>>"
