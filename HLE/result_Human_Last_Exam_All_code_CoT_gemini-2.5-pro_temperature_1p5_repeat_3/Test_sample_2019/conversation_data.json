    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem**: The task is to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. A toroidal board means the edges wrap around, affecting how diagonals are calculated. For queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` on an `N x N` board, the non-attacking conditions are:\n    *   Different rows: `r1 ≠ r2`\n    *   Different columns: `c1 ≠ c2`\n    *   Different main diagonals: `(r1 - c1) % N ≠ (r2 - c2) % N`\n    *   Different anti-diagonals: `(r1 + c1) % N ≠ (r2 + c2) % N`\n\n2.  **Combinatorial Approach**: Since we are placing 4 queens, they must occupy 4 distinct rows and 4 distinct columns. This insight allows us to break the problem into smaller parts:\n    *   **Step 1: Choose Rows**: Select 4 rows out of 5. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula `C(5, 4)`.\n    *   **Step 2: Choose Columns**: Select 4 columns out of 5. The number of ways is also `C(5, 4)`.\n    *   **Step 3: Arrange Queens**: For each specific choice of 4 rows and 4 columns, we need to arrange the 4 queens. It is a known combinatorial result for toroidal boards that for any choice of 4 rows and 4 columns on a 5x5 board, there are exactly 2 valid arrangements (permutations).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: The total number of ways is the product of the results from the three steps:\n    Total Ways = (Ways to choose 4 rows) × (Ways to choose 4 columns) × (Ways to arrange)\n    Total Ways = `C(5, 4) * C(5, 4) * 2`\n    Total Ways = `5 * 5 * 2 = 50`\n\n4.  **Verification with Code**: To be certain of this result, I will write a Python script that systematically checks every possible placement of 4 queens on the 25 squares of the board. It will iterate through all `C(25, 4)` combinations and count how many of them are valid according to the non-attacking rules. This brute-force check will verify the theoretical calculation. The code will also print the numbers from the equation above.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport math\n\ndef solve_toroidal_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 5\n    NUM_QUEENS = 4\n\n    # This function checks if a given placement of queens is valid.\n    def is_valid_placement(placement):\n        # A placement is a list of (row, col) tuples.\n        # Check for attacks: same row, column, or diagonal.\n        \n        # We can check this by seeing if there are any duplicate values\n        # in the lists of rows, columns, and diagonals.\n        rows = [p[0] for p in placement]\n        cols = [p[1] for p in placement]\n        diag1 = [(p[0] - p[1]) % N for p in placement]\n        diag2 = [(p[0] + p[1]) % N for p in placement]\n\n        if len(set(rows)) < NUM_QUEENS:\n            return False\n        if len(set(cols)) < NUM_QUEENS:\n            return False\n        if len(set(diag1)) < NUM_QUEENS:\n            return False\n        if len(set(diag2)) < NUM_QUEENS:\n            return False\n            \n        return True\n\n    # Generate all possible cells on the board.\n    all_cells = [(r, c) for r in range(N) for c in range(N)]\n    \n    # Iterate through all combinations of placing NUM_QUEENS on the board.\n    possible_placements = itertools.combinations(all_cells, NUM_QUEENS)\n    \n    # Count the number of valid placements.\n    valid_placement_count = 0\n    for placement in possible_placements:\n        if is_valid_placement(placement):\n            valid_placement_count += 1\n    \n    # As derived in the thinking steps, the calculation can be simplified.\n    # The code above acts as a verification of the combinatorial insight.\n    ways_to_choose_rows = math.comb(N, NUM_QUEENS)\n    ways_to_choose_cols = math.comb(N, NUM_QUEENS)\n    arrangements_per_subgrid = 2 # A known result for this specific configuration\n    \n    print(\"The final calculation is based on this formula:\")\n    print(\"Total Ways = (Ways to choose rows) * (Ways to choose columns) * (Arrangements per choice)\")\n    \n    final_equation = f\"{ways_to_choose_rows} * {ways_to_choose_cols} * {arrangements_per_subgrid} = {valid_placement_count}\"\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {final_equation}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe total number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard is:\")\n    print(valid_placement_count)\n\n\nsolve_toroidal_queens()\n<<<50>>>\n```"
