    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this geographical riddle.\n\nFirst, I will break down the user's request into key characteristics:\n1.  It is an island town.\n2.  It is very isolated, specifically \"more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island\".\n3.  It is situated on a bay.\n4.  This bay was formed by a volcanic caldera.\n5.  The town, the bay, and the caldera share the same name.\n\nNext, I will consider some of the most remote inhabited islands on Earth and check if they fit these criteria. My main candidates are islands known for their isolation and volcanic origins, such as Easter Island (Rapa Nui), Tristan da Cunha, and Rapa Iti.\n\n-   **Tristan da Cunha**: The main settlement is Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. This doesn't match a bay or caldera name.\n-   **Rapa Iti**: The main town, Ahurei, sits on Ahurei Bay, which is a flooded volcanic caldera. It is about 550 km from the nearest inhabited island. This is a perfect literal fit, but the location is quite obscure.\n-   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui)**: The main town is Hanga Roa, which sits on Hanga Roa Bay. This matches the \"shared name\" clue. The island is extremely isolated (over 2,000 km from the nearest inhabited land) and famously volcanic, with the notable Rano Kau caldera. Although Hanga Roa Bay itself isn't the caldera, it's very plausible that a riddle would use this slight imprecision to point to such a world-famous location.\n\nGiven that riddles often point towards more famous locations, Hanga Roa on Easter Island is the most likely intended answer. I will create a Python script to represent this logic and identify the correct town.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle by programmatically evaluating candidate island towns\n    based on the provided clues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a candidate island town\n    # and its geographical properties based on the riddle's clues.\n    candidates = [\n        {\n            \"town\": \"Hanga Roa\",\n            \"island\": \"Easter Island\",\n            \"distance_to_nearest_inhabited_land_km\": 2075,\n            \"sits_on_bay_with_shared_name\": True,\n            \"on_volcanic_island_with_caldera\": True,\n            \"is_famous\": True\n        },\n        {\n            \"town\": \"Edinburgh of the Seven Seas\",\n            \"island\": \"Tristan da Cunha\",\n            \"distance_to_nearest_inhabited_land_km\": 2430,\n            \"sits_on_bay_with_shared_name\": False,\n            \"on_volcanic_island_with_caldera\": True,\n            \"is_famous\": True\n        },\n        {\n            \"town\": \"Ahurei\",\n            \"island\": \"Rapa Iti\",\n            \"distance_to_nearest_inhabited_land_km\": 550,\n            \"sits_on_bay_with_shared_name\": True,\n            # This is the only candidate where the bay itself is the caldera.\n            \"on_volcanic_island_with_caldera\": True, \n            \"is_famous\": False\n        }\n    ]\n\n    # The riddle's clues:\n    required_distance = 500\n\n    # Find the best fit.
