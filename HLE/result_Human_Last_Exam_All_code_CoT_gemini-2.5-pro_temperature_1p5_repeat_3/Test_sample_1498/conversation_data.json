    "Of course. I will provide a Python script to answer your question.\n\nMy plan is to first identify the specific verses (*bayt*) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the prophets. Based on the standard text of the poem, I have determined the starting verse number and the ending verse number where the 25 prophets are enumerated.\n\nThe Python script will be constructed to:\n1.  Store the starting and ending verse numbers in variables.\n2.  Store the Arabic text of these specific verses in a dictionary for clarity and reference.\n3.  Print an introduction explaining the range.\n4.  Loop through the range and print each verse number and its corresponding text.\n5.  Conclude with a summary sentence that explicitly states the starting and ending numbers, as requested.\n\nThis will clearly present the solution and the evidence from the poem's text.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophet_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the verses from 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n    that list the names of the prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The list of prophets starts at bayt 38 and ends at bayt 45.\n    start_bayt = 38\n    end_bayt = 45\n\n    # A dictionary containing the verses (bayt) with the prophets' names.\n    # Transliteration is provided in comments for non-Arabic readers.\n    verses = {\n        38: \"هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودٌ مَعْ صَالِحْ\",   # Hum Adamun, Idreesu, Noohun, Hoodun ma' Salih\n        39: \"وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\",                  # wa Ibraheemu kullun muttaba'\n        40: \"لُوطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيلُ إِسْحَاقٌ كَذَا يَعْقُوبُ\", # Lootun wa Isma'eelu, Ishaaqu kadha Ya'qoobu\n        41: \"يُوسُفُ وَأَيُّوبُ احْتَذَى\",                    # Yoosufu wa Ayyoobu-htadha\n        42: \"شُعَيْبُ هَارُونُ وَمُوسَى وَالْيَسَعْ\",        # Shu'aybu, Haroonu wa Moosa wal-Yasa'\n        43: \"ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\",   # Dhul-Kifli, Dawoodu, Sulaymanu-ttaba'\n        44: \"إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى\",          # 'Ilyasu, Yoonusu, Zakariyya, Yahya\n        45: \"عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\"             # 'Eesaa wa Taha (Muhammad) khaatimun, da' ghayya\n    }\n\n    print(\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the names of the Prophets are mentioned in the following verses:\\n\")\n\n    for i in range(start_bayt, end_bayt + 1):\n        print(f\"Bayt {i}: {verses[i]}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n-------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Final Answer:\")\n    # Printing each number in the final equation as requested\n    print(f\"The section begins at bayt number {start_bayt} and concludes at bayt number {end_bayt}.\")\n\nfind_prophet_verses()\n```\n<<<The names are mentioned from bayt 38 to bayt 45.>>>"
