    # The analysis begins by defining H(s,s') as the Euclidean distance |q(s') - q(s)|.
    # We perform a Taylor expansion for the position vector q(s') around s for s' -> s.
    # The key insight is relating the derivatives of q(s) to the geometry:
    # q'(s) = t(s) (tangent vector)
    # q''(s) = κ(s)n(s) (curvature times normal vector)

    # This leads to an expansion for the squared distance:
    # H(s,s')² ≈ (s' - s)² - (1/12)κ(s)²(s' - s)⁴ + O((s' - s)⁶)
    #
    # Taking the square root and using the approximation √(1-x) ≈ 1 - x/2 gives:
    # H(s,s') ≈ |s' - s| * (1 - (1/24)κ(s)²(s' - s)²)
