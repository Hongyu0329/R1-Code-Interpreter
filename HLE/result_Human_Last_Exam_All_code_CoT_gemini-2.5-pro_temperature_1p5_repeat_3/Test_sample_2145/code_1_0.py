# The plan is to identify the answer for each of the four trivia questions
# and then use the first letter of each answer to construct the hidden word.
# The code will display the letter derived from each question's answer.

# Answer to question 1
# Clue: Oscar-winning film, a character's "path to success", and a sequence "A, A, D, A C, A, D, D, A".
# The answer is "Slumdog Millionaire", where the protagonist wins a quiz show.
answer1 = "Slumdog Millionaire"
letter1 = answer1[0]

# Answer to question 2
# Clue: According to Stalin, they should be on the left in films; in ancient diagrams, they are at the bottom.
# This refers to the "Inferno" (Hell).
answer2 = "Inferno"
letter2 = answer2[0]

# Answer to question 3
# Clue: A TV series with cat-themed dishes ("Cheshire Salad", "Siamese Hotpot") and a missing letter.
# The puns point to "House, M.D." (house cat), and the missing letter is 'M' (for Mouse, as in cat-and-mouse).
answer3 = "House, M.D."
letter3 = answer3[0]

# Answer to question 4
# Clue: 'X' was banned from showing on 'X' due to resemblance to a coup leader.
# This refers to the story of the "Omo" brand commercial being banned on the "Comoro" Islands.
answer4 = "Omo"
letter4 = answer4[0]

# Fulfilling the request to "output each number in the final equation"
# by showing how each numbered question contributes a letter.
print(f"The 1st letter of the answer to question (1) is: {letter1}")
print(f"The 1st letter of the answer to question (2) is: {letter2}")
print(f"The 1st letter of the answer to question (3) is: {letter3}")
print(f"The 1st letter of the answer to question (4) is: {letter4}")

# Concatenating the letters to form the final hidden word
hidden_word = letter1 + letter2 + letter3 + letter4
print(f"\nThe final hidden word is: {hidden_word}")
