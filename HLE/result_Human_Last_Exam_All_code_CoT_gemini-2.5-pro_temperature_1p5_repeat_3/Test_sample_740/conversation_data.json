    "My plan to solve this problem involves these steps:\n1.  First, I will reformulate the given integral equation as a system of linear algebraic equations. The integral kernel `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)` is a separable (or degenerate) kernel, as it can be expanded into a finite sum of products of functions of `x` and `y`: `K(x,y) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`.\n2.  By substituting this expansion into the integral equation, we can see that the solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. I'll express `u(x)` in terms of `n` unknown coefficients, which are defined as moments of `u(y)`, i.e., `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`.\n3.  This substitution leads to a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` coefficients `c_k`. The system can be written in matrix form as `(I - λA)c = b`, where `A` is an `n x n` matrix, `c` is the vector of unknown coefficients, and `b` is a known vector.\n4.  The original integral equation has no solution if this linear system is inconsistent. This occurs when `λ` is chosen such that `I - λA` is a singular matrix (i.e., its determinant is zero) and `b` is not in the column space of `(I - λA)`.\n5.  The condition `det(I - λA) = 0` implies that `1/λ` must be an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. Let's call such an eigenvalue `μ`.\n6.  For such a `λ = 1/μ`, the system has no solution if `b` is not orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint matrix `(I - λA)ᵀ`. This null space is spanned by the eigenvectors of `Aᵀ` associated with the eigenvalue `μ`.\n7.  The problem is now reduced to finding the eigenvalues of matrix `A` and checking a condition on the corresponding eigenvectors of `Aᵀ`. Since finding an analytical formula for these eigenvalues for a general `n` is very complex, I will write a Python script that numerically solves the problem for a given integer `n`. The script will construct the matrix `A` and vector `b`, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, check the condition for no solution, and print the resulting values of `λ`.\n8.  I will set `n=2` in the script as a representative example. For `n=1`, the answer is `λ=1`. For `n=2`, the problem is non-trivial and yields two distinct real values for `λ`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_lambda_no_solution(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the numerical values of lambda for a given integer n > 0 for which the\n    integral equation has no solutions.\n    u(x) = 1 + lambda * integral_0^1 (x^n - y^n)/(x - y) u(y) dy\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        print(\"Error: n must be a positive integer.\")\n        return []\n\n    # This problem can be converted to a system of linear equations (I - lambda*A)c = b.\n    # The matrix A has elements A_jk = 1 / (j - k + n), where j,k are 0-indexed.\n    # The vector b has elements b_j = 1 / (j + 1).\n    A = np.zeros((n, n))\n    b = np.zeros(n)\n    for j in range(n):\n        b[j] = 1.0 / (j + 1)\n        for k in range(n):\n            A[j, k] = 1.0 / (j - k + n)\n\n    # The equation has no solution if lambda = 1/mu, where mu is an eigenvalue of A,\n    # and the vector b is not in the range of (I - lambda*A).
