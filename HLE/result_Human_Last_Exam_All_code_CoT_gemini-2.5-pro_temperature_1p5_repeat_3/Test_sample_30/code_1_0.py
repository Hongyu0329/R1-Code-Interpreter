# The correct option is D. This option accurately describes the computational
# requirements for the prover and verifier in an interactive proof system.

# The prover is computationally powerful (often assumed to have exponential
# or unbounded resources) in order to find the proof for a given statement.
# For a problem in a class like PSPACE, the prover must be able to solve
# PSPACE problems.

# The verifier, on the other hand, must be efficient, which is formalized
# as being a probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machine. This asymmetry
# is a core concept of interactive proofs, making them powerful yet practical
# from the verifier's perspective.

# The following is a symbolic representation and not executable code.
