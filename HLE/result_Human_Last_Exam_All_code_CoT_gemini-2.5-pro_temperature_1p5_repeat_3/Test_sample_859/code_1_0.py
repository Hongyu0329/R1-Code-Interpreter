    Calculates the minimal number of new edges to make G' 2-edge-connected.

    The process is as follows:
    1.  The number of edges required to make G' 2-edge-connected depends on its structure, which is constrained by the properties of the original graph G. We must find the worst-case structure for G' that requires the maximum number of new edges.
    2.  This worst-case number of edges can be expressed as a formula in terms of the variable 'd'.
        - Let k be the number of "leaf components" in G' (either disconnected components or pendant blocks).
        - The total number of edges from {v1, v2, v3} to G' is d + (d+1) + (d+1) = 3d + 2.
        - Analysis shows that in the worst case, one needs to add 3d/2 + 1 edges.
    3.  The problem asks for a single numerical answer. This implies we should find the minimum value of the expression `3d/2 + 1` over the allowed values of `d`.
    4.  The value of d is constrained by the edge connectivity of G being 2. The degree of any vertex must be at least 2. Since deg(v1) = d, we have d >= 2.
    5.  Given that d is an even integer, the smallest possible value for d is 2.
    6.  Substituting d=2 into the formula gives the final answer.
    """
    # Smallest possible even integer for d such that d >= 2
    d = 2

    # The formula derived for the number of edges is (3*d)/2 + 1
    # We use integer division // as d is guaranteed to be even.
    num_edges = (3 * d) // 2 + 1

    print("The derived formula for the number of new edges is (3 * d) / 2 + 1.")
    print(f"The minimum possible value for d is {d}.")
    print("Plugging this value into the formula:")
    print(f"Number of edges = (3 * {d}) / 2 + 1 = {num_edges}")
