    "To solve this, we first need to identify the product of the reaction and then calculate its Böttcher Molecular Complexity.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Determine the Reactant and Reaction:** The reaction is the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone.\n2.  **Identify the Product:** In the presence of a base (like NaOH), 2-chlorocyclohexanone undergoes a rearrangement. The process involves the formation of a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate, which then opens up. This ring-contraction reaction yields cyclopentanecarboxylic acid as the final product.\n3.  **Define Böttcher Molecular Complexity (BMC):** The formula for BMC is:\n    `BMC = (N_atoms * N_bonds * N_cycles) / N_parts`\n    where:\n    *   `N_atoms`: The number of non-hydrogen atoms.\n    *   `N_bonds`: The number of bonds between non-hydrogen atoms.\n    *   `N_cycles`: The number of rings in the molecule.\n    *   `N_parts`: The number of disconnected components (for a single molecule, this is 1).\n4.  **Calculate BMC for the Product (Cyclopentanecarboxylic Acid):**\n    *   **Chemical Structure:** A cyclopentane ring attached to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   `N_atoms`: There are 6 carbon atoms and 2 oxygen atoms. Total = **8**.\n    *   `N_bonds`: There are 5 C-C bonds in the cyclopentane ring, 1 C-C bond connecting the ring to the carboxyl group, and 2 bonds within the carboxyl group (one C-O and one C=O). Total = 5 + 1 + 2 = **8**.\n    *   `N_cycles`: There is one cyclopentane ring. Total = **1**.\n    *   `N_parts`: The molecule is a single connected entity. Total = **1**.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute these values into the BMC formula.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the final calculation and display the result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify the parameters for the product, cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n# N_atoms: Number of non-hydrogen atoms (6 Carbons + 2 Oxygens)\nn_atoms = 8\n\n# N_bonds: Number of bonds between non-hydrogen atoms\n# 5 bonds in the cyclopentane ring, 1 bond connecting the carboxyl group,\n# and 2 bonds within the carboxyl group (C-O and C=O).\nn_bonds = 8\n\n# N_cycles: Number of rings\nn_cycles = 1\n\n# N_parts: Number of disconnected molecular parts (it's one molecule)\nn_parts = 1\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Böttcher Molecular Complexity (BMC)\n# Formula: BMC = (N_atoms * N_bonds * N_cycles) / N_parts\nbmc_result = (n_atoms * n_bonds * n_cycles) / n_parts\n\n# Step 3: Print the final result showing the equation\nprint(\"The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\")\nprint(\"\\nBöttcher Molecular Complexity is calculated using the formula: (N_atoms * N_bonds * N_cycles) / N_parts\")\nprint(f\"\\nFor cyclopentanecarboxylic acid:\")\nprint(f\"Number of non-hydrogen atoms (N_atoms) = {n_atoms}\")\nprint(f\"Number of non-hydrogen bonds (N_bonds) = {n_bonds}\")\nprint(f\"Number of cycles (N_cycles) = {n_cycles}\")\nprint(f\"Number of parts (N_parts) = {n_parts}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n# The final equation as requested, showing each number.\nprint(f\"({n_atoms} * {n_bonds} * {n_cycles}) / {n_parts} = {int(bmc_result)}\")\n```\n<<<64>>>"
