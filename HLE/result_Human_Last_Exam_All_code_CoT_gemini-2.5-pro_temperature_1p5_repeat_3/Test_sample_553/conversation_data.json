    "My thinking process to answer your question goes like this:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user is asking to identify a song by The Beatles that begins with a specific and somewhat unusual chord progression: a jump from the tonic chord (I) to the minor fifth chord (v). This requires knowledge of music theory and The Beatles' catalog.\n2.  **Analyze the Music Theory:**\n    *   **Tonic (I):** This is the \"home\" chord of a key. For example, in the key of C major, the tonic chord is C major.\n    *   **Minor Fifth (v):** In a major key, the chord built on the fifth degree of the scale is naturally a major chord (V). For instance, in C major, the V chord is G major. A minor fifth chord (v) would be G minor. Using a 'v' chord in a major key is a technique called \"modal interchange\" or \"borrowing,\" as it's borrowed from the parallel minor key (C minor in this case). This creates a distinct, often poignant or melancholy sound.\n3.  **Search the Beatles' Catalog:** I need to find a song that starts with this I -> v progression.\n    *   The song most famously associated with this kind of sophisticated harmony is \"Michelle\" from the album *Rubber Soul*.\n4.  **Verify the Progression in \"Michelle\":**\n    *   The song's home key is F. It cleverly shifts between F major and F minor.\n    *   If we consider the key as F major, the tonic (I) chord is F major. The minor fifth (v) chord would be C minor.\n    *   The song's famous instrumental introduction can be interpreted in a few ways, but one common analysis of the harmony shows a movement from an F major tonic to a C minor chord. This I -> v move right at the beginning gives the song its unique, continental-sounding charm.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** The request requires the answer to be delivered as a Python script. The script doesn't need to perform a complex calculation but should programmatically provide the answer.\n    *   I will create a variable to hold the song's title.\n    *   I will then use a `print()` function to output a clear sentence stating the answer and briefly explaining the chords involved.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the Beatles song that starts with a jump from the tonic\n    to the minor fifth chord.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    key = \"F Major\"\n    tonic_chord = \"F Major (I)\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"C minor (v)\"\n\n    print(f\"The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(f\"In the key of {key}, the progression is a jump from the tonic {tonic_chord} to the minor fifth {minor_fifth_chord}.\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
