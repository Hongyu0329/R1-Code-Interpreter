    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a fascinating problem that connects combinatorics and algebraic topology. The solution involves identifying the correct mathematical framework and applying a powerful theorem.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will identify the specific mathematical object in question, \"the standard triangulation of the Möbius band\". It's a specific 2-dimensional simplicial complex, which I'll call `K`.\n2.  Next, I'll interpret the phrase \"higher dimensional rooted forests `(F,R)` that fail to simplicially collapse\". The failure to collapse is a key topological indicator. I will argue that the forests `F` in question are precisely the \"2-trees\" of the complex `K`. A 2-tree `F` has intrinsic topological properties (specifically, a non-trivial first homology group) that guarantee it will not collapse onto any root set `R` of vertices. Therefore, the question simplifies to counting the number of 2-trees in `K`.\n3.  I will then invoke a significant result from algebraic combinatorics, the \"simplicial matrix-tree theorem\" by Duval, Klivans, and Martin. This theorem states that the number of 2-trees in a suitable 2-complex `K` is equal to the order of the torsion subgroup of its first homology group, `|Tor(H_1(K, Z))|`.\n4.  For the specific complex `K`, the first homology group `H_1(K, Z)` is a known result from the literature. I will state this result.\n5.  Finally, I'll use this information to calculate the order of the torsion subgroup, which gives the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan and prints the result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_mobius_forest_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of counting non-collapsing rooted forests\n    on the standard triangulation of the Möbius band.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the problem and define the simplicial complex K.\n    # The \"standard triangulation of the Möbius band\" in this context refers to a specific\n    # 2-dimensional simplicial complex, K, known in algebraic combinatorics literature.\n    # It is defined on 6 vertices and has 10 triangular faces.\n    print(\"Problem: How many higher dimensional rooted forests (F,R) of the standard\")\n    print(\"triangulation of the Möbius band (K) fail to have the forest F simplicially collapse onto the root R?\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 2: Interpret the question in terms of \"2-trees\".\n    print(\"Interpretation:\")\n    print(\"A forest F failing to collapse onto a vertex set R points to a non-trivial topology within F.\")\n    print(\"This property is captured by the concept of a '2-tree'.
