    "The user wants to find the next number in the sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( ).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the sequence**: I will examine the relationship between consecutive numbers to find a pattern.\n2.  **Hypothesize a pattern**: I'll test common types of patterns, such as arithmetic progression, geometric progression, or a combination like `x_{n+1} = a * x_n + b`.\n3.  **Test the hypothesis**: A likely pattern seems to be `x_{n+1} = 2 * x_n + c_n`, where `c_n` is another sequence.\n4.  **Analyze the sub-pattern**: I will find the rule governing the `c_n` sequence. This might involve looking at the differences between its terms.\n5.  **Predict the next term**: Once the pattern for `c_n` is established, I will calculate its next term.\n6.  **Calculate the final answer**: Using the predicted next term of `c_n`, I will calculate the missing number in the original sequence.\n7.  **Generate the code**: I will write a Python script that explains and performs these calculations, printing out each step of the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the sequence to find the pattern and calculates the next term.\n    \"\"\"\n    seq = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the primary pattern found\n    print(f\"The given sequence is: {', '.join(map(str, seq))}\")\n    print(\"Let's analyze the relationship between consecutive terms.
