    Calculates the universal dimensionless value of the Lindhard function at q=0, w=0.
    
    The Lindhard polarization function Pi_0(q, w) in the static (w=0) and
    long-wavelength (q->0) limit is given by:
    Pi_0(0, 0) = -N(e_F)
    where N(e_F) is the electronic density of states at the Fermi level.
    
    The density of states for a 3D free electron gas is:
    N(e_F) = (m * k_F) / (pi^2 * hbar^2)
    
    This value depends on the material's electron density (via k_F).
    However, the question asks for a single numerical value, implying a universal answer.
    The most logical interpretation is to find the dimensionless ratio:
    Ratio = Pi_0(0, 0) / N(e_F)
    
    This script calculates and prints this universal ratio.
    """

    # The final equation is the ratio R = Pi_0(0,0) / N(e_F).
    # We know the relationship is Pi_0(0,0) = -1 * N(e_F).
    # Therefore, the ratio R can be written as:
    # R = (-1 * N(e_F)) / (1 * N(e_F))
    
    numerator_factor = -1
    denominator_factor = 1
    
    # The terms N(e_F) cancel out, leaving the ratio of the factors.
