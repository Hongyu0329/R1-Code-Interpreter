    "To determine which ballet step has the same ending leg position as the starting position, I will analyze the definition of each movement provided in the answer choices. My plan is to describe each step's execution, focusing specifically on whether the feet change places (e.g., from right-foot-front to left-foot-front) by the end of the step. The correct answer will be the step that is not `changé` (changed) and concludes with the feet in the identical fifth position from which it began.\n\nI will write a Python script to present this analysis. The script will define the properties of each ballet step and then programmatically identify the one that does not involve a change of feet from start to finish.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_step_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one ends in the same\n    leg position as it started.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary to store information about each ballet step.\n    # The 'changes_feet' key indicates if the step ends with the feet\n    # swapped compared to the starting position.\n    steps_data = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Entrechat six',\n            'changes_feet': False,\n            'description': 'A jump starting from fifth position.
