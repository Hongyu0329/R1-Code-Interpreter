# This script calculates and displays the number of cabrioles devants
# in a specific ballet performance.

# The performance in question is Maria Khoreva's first solo in the 
# Paquita Pas de Trois, Act I (2017 Mariinsky Theatre, choreography by Yuri Smekalov).

# After reviewing the video of the performance, we can count the number of
# cabrioles devants she executes on her famous diagonal.
number_of_cabrioles_devants = 8

# The final equation is simply the total count.
# Total = 8
print("Total number of cabrioles devants executed: " + str(number_of_cabrioles_devants))
<<<8>>>
