    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the product of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, a secondary alkyl halide. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide, which is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze Substrate Conformation**: For an E2 reaction on a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (Bromine) and the beta-proton (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) must be in an anti-periplanar arrangement. This means they both must be in axial positions. We need to determine the most stable chair conformation of the substrate.\n    *   The methyl group is bulkier than the bromine atom, so it will preferentially occupy the equatorial position to minimize steric strain.\n    *   The (1S,2R) stereochemistry indicates that the bromo and methyl groups are *trans* to each other.\n    *   If the methyl group at C2 is equatorial, the *trans* bromo group at C1 must be **axial**. This is the dominant, most stable conformation.\n\n3.  **Identify Possible Elimination Pathways**: Since the bromine leaving group is axial, we need to find adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) that have an axial proton.\n    *   **At C2**: The methyl group is equatorial, which means the hydrogen on C2 is **axial**. Removing this proton would form a double bond between C1 and C2, yielding **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the more substituted alkene (Zaitsev product).\n    *   **At C6**: This carbon has two protons, one axial and one equatorial. The **axial** proton can be removed. This would form a double bond between C1 and C6, yielding **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted alkene (Hofmann product).\n\n4.  **Apply Regioselectivity Rule (Hofmann vs. Zaitsev)**: The choice between the two pathways depends on the base.\n    *   Potassium tert-butoxide is a very **bulky** base.\n    *   Due to steric hindrance, it is easier for the bulky base to access the less sterically hindered proton. The proton at C6 is more accessible than the proton at C2, which is shielded by the adjacent methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction will favor the removal of the proton from C6, leading to the formation of the Hofmann product.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The major product of the reaction is 3-methylcyclohexene. The following Python code automates this reasoning process.\n\n```python\ndef identify_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the major product of the E2 elimination reaction of\n    (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define reactants and reaction conditions\n    substrate = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    base = \"potassium tert-butoxide (a bulky base)\"\n    reaction_type = \"E2 elimination\"\n\n    print(f\"Starting Material: {substrate}\")\n    print(f\"Reagent: {base}\")\n    print(f\"Reaction Type: {reaction_type}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the stereochemistry required for the reaction\n    print(\"Analysis:\")\n    print(\"1.
