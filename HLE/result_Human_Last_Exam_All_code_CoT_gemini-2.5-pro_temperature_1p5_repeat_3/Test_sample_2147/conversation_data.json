    "Pavel Milyukov was a Russian historian and liberal politician who was a prominent figure in the early 20th century. He held traditional views on art and was a staunch critic of the modernist and avant-garde movements that flourished in Russia during the Silver Age. He saw these new artistic trends as decadent and purposeless. The term \"X-Ys\" is a placeholder for the specific groups he targeted with his criticism.\n\nMy plan is to identify the two related art movements that Milyukov famously criticized. I will then write a Python script that:\n1.  Assigns the name of the first movement to a variable `X`.\n2.  Assigns the name of the second movement to a variable `Y`.\n3.  Prints an explanation of the context.\n4.  Prints the values of `X` and `Y` individually.\n5.  Prints the full hyphenated term `X-Y` in the context of the original quote.\n\n```python\ndef solve_milyukov_quote():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the term 'X-Y' in Pavel Milyukov's criticism of culture.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Pavel Milyukov criticized the modernist art movements of his time.\n    # The term he used, often translated this way, refers to two interconnected\n    # movements he saw as decadent.\n    X = \"Symbolists\"\n    Y = \"Decadents\"\n\n    full_term = f\"{X}-{Y}\"\n\n    print(\"Pavel Milyukov frequently accused the Western culture of his time and even denounced 'X-Ys' as a 'stagnant swamp'.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis quote refers to his criticism of modernist art movements.\")\n    print(f\"The 'X' in the term stands for: {X}\")\n    print(f\"The 'Y' in the term stands for: {Y}\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the full quote would read:\")\n    print(f\"Pavel Milyukov frequently accused the Western culture of his time and even denounced {full_term} as a 'stagnant swamp'.\")\n\nsolve_milyukov_quote()\n```\n<<<Symbolists-Decadents>>>"
