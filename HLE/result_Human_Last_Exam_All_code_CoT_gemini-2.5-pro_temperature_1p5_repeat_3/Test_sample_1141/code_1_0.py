    Solves the billet cutting problem based on the user's formulation.

    The analysis shows that T1 pieces are impractical due to extremely
    restrictive constraints. The optimal strategy is to maximize the number of
    high-value B2 pieces and then fill the remaining space with B1 pieces.

    This code implements a greedy approach based on that strategy.
