    "My plan to solve this problem is to use a computational brute-force approach. Since the length of the expression is fixed at 5 and the number of symbols is small, we can check every single possibility.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  **Generate All Possibilities**: I will systematically generate every possible string of length 5 using the 7 allowed symbols (`T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`). This results in a total of 7^5 = 16,807 unique strings to check.\n2.  **Convert to a Runnable Format**: For each generated string, I will convert it into a valid Python boolean expression. This involves replacing the symbols with their Python equivalents: `T` becomes `True`, `F` becomes `False`, `&` becomes ` and `, `|` becomes ` or `, and `!` becomes ` not `. The operator precedence in Python (`not` > `and` > `or`) correctly matches the problem's requirements.\n3.  **Evaluate and Handle Errors**: I will use Python's built-in `eval()` function to calculate the boolean value of the converted string. Many of these strings will be syntactically invalid (e.g., `T(&F)` or `()!T&`). These will cause `eval()` to raise an error. I will use a `try...except` block to catch these errors and simply ignore the invalid strings.\n4.  **Count True Expressions**: If a string is successfully evaluated and its result is strictly `True`, I will increment a counter.\n5.  **Final Output**: After checking all 16,807 strings, the final value of the counter is the answer. The code will print this total count.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_true_expressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of true boolean expressions of length 5.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The set of allowed symbols for building the expression.\n    symbols = 'TF!&|()'\n    true_expression_count = 0\n\n    # Generate all possible strings of length 5 using the given symbols.\n    all_possible_strings = itertools.product(symbols, repeat=5)\n\n    for p in all_possible_strings:\n        expression_string = \"\".join(p)\n\n        # Convert the custom expression syntax to Python's boolean syntax.\n        # We add spaces around 'and'/'or' and after 'not' to ensure proper parsing\n        # of concatenated expressions like 'T&F' or '!T'.\n        python_expression = expression_string.replace('!', ' not ')\n        python_expression = python_expression.replace('&', ' and ')\n        python_expression = python_expression.replace('|', ' or ')\n        python_expression = python_expression.replace('T', 'True')\n        python_expression = python_expression.replace('F', 'False')\n\n        try:\n            # Evaluate the string as a Python expression.\n            # A `try-except` block handles the many syntactically invalid strings.\n            result = eval(python_expression)\n\n            # Check if the expression evaluates to True. We use 'is True' for a strict check.\n            if result is True:\n                true_expression_count += 1\n        except Exception:\n            # Catch any exceptions from eval() (e.g., SyntaxError, TypeError)\n            # and simply continue to the next string.\n            continue\n\n    # Print the final result.\n    print(f\"The total number of true boolean expressions of length 5 is: {true_expression_count}\")\n\ncount_true_expressions()\n```\n<<<78>>>"
