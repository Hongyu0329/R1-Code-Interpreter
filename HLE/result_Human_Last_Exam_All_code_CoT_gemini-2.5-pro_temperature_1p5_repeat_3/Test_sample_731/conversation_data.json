    "This problem asks for the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve this problem.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The group in question is the semidihedral group of size 512. Since $512 = 2^9$, this group is denoted as $SD_{512}$ or $SD_{2^9}$. It is defined by the presentation $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Define Power Subgroups:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if it is the set of the $k$-th powers of all elements in $G$ for some integer $k$. That is, $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$. For $H$ to be a power subgroup, the set $G^k$ must itself be a subgroup of $G$.\n\n3.  **Apply a Key Theorem:** A known theorem by group theorist Y. Berkovich provides a criterion for when $G^k$ is a subgroup for groups like this one. For the semidihedral group $G = SD_{2^n}$ (with $n \\ge 4$), the set $G^k$ forms a subgroup if and only if $k=1$ or $k$ is an even number.\n\n4.  **Count the Subgroups:** We can find the total number of power subgroups by counting the distinct subgroups that arise from the allowed values of $k$.\n    *   **Case 1 (k=1):** The value $k=1$ gives the power subgroup $G^1 = G$. This accounts for one power subgroup.\n    *   **Case 2 (k is even):** For any even $k$, we can write $k = d \\cdot 2^j$, where $d$ is odd and $j \\ge 1$. For semidihedral groups, it can be shown that $G^k = G^{2^j}$. This means we only need to count the distinct subgroups of the form $G^{2^j}$ for $j \\ge 1$. For $SD_{2^9}$, the exponent (the least common multiple of the orders of all elements) is $2^{9-1}=256$. Thus, the distinct power subgroups for even $k$ are $G^2, G^4, \\dots, G^{256}$. This corresponds to $j$ taking values from 1 to 8, which gives 8 distinct subgroups.\n\n5.  **Sum the results:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from the two cases.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to provide the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_order = 512\n\n    # The semidihedral group SD_2^n has order 2^n.\n    # For a group of size 512, 2^n = 512, so n = log2(512) = 9.\n    # We are considering the group G = SD_{2^9}.\n    n = int(math.log2(group_order))\n\n    print(\"The group is the semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as SD_{2^9}.\")\n    print(\"A power subgroup is a subgroup H of G such that H = G^k = {g^k | g in G} for some integer k.\")\n    print(\"For SD_{2^n} (n >= 4), the set G^k is a subgroup if and only if k=1 or k is even.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Case 1: k is odd\n    # The only odd k for which G^k is a subgroup is k=1. This gives one subgroup, G itself.\n    num_odd_k_subgroups = 1\n    print(f\"Counting subgroups from odd k:\")\n    print(f\"For odd k, only k=1 yields a power subgroup.
