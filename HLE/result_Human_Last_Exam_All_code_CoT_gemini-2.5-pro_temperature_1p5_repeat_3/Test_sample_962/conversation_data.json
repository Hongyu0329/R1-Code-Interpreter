    "To design a tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol, we will use the well-established Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signature scheme combined with Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for our design and implementation:\n\n1.  **Scheme Choice**: We will model the BLS signature scheme. This scheme relies on cryptographic pairings on elliptic curves and is known for its short signatures and straightforward aggregation properties. Its security is \"tightly\" related to the hardness of standard cryptographic assumptions (like the Computational Diffie-Hellman problem) in the underlying group.\n2.  **Key Generation (Setup Phase)**: To distribute the signing key, we will use Shamir's Secret Sharing. A master secret key is encoded into a polynomial of degree `t-1`. Each of the `n` parties is given a point on that polynomial as their secret share. In a real-world scenario, a Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol would be used to create this polynomial collaboratively without a trusted party. For simplicity, our code will simulate this process with a trusted \"dealer\".\n3.  **Signing Protocol (Two Rounds)**:\n    *   **Round 1**: An initiator (or coordinator) broadcasts a request for a signature on a specific message to the `n` parties.\n    *   **Round 2**: Any party willing to sign computes a *partial signature* on the message hash using its secret share and sends it back to the coordinator.\n4.  **Signature Aggregation**: The coordinator waits until it has received at least `t` partial signatures. Using Lagrange interpolation, the coordinator can combine these `t` partials into a single, complete, and valid signature. This aggregation step does not require any further interaction with the signers.\n\nThe following Python code provides a simplified simulation of this design. It uses modular arithmetic over a finite field to stand in for the more complex mathematics of elliptic curves, which makes the core concepts of secret sharing and signature aggregation easier to understand.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport hashlib\n\ndef mod_inverse(a, m):\n    \"\"\"Computes the modular multiplicative inverse of a modulo m using the extended Euclidean algorithm.\"\"\"\n    m0, x0, x1 = m, 0, 1\n    if m == 1:\n        return 0\n    while a > 1:\n        q = a // m\n        m, a = a % m, m\n        x0, x1 = x1 - q * x0, x0\n    if x1 < 0:\n        x1 += m0\n    return x1\n\ndef main():\n    # 1.
