    "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number `m` such that we can place `m` white queens and `m` black queens on a 16x16 chessboard so that no white queen attacks a black queen.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Strategy**: The problem is to partition the board's squares into three sets: those for white queens (`W`), those for black queens (`B`), and empty squares (`E`). The sizes of `W` and `B` must both be `m`, and no queen in `W` can attack any square in `B`.\n2.  **Placement**: To maximize `m`, we should place the white queens in a configuration that minimizes the total area they attack. A compact rectangular block is an excellent strategy for this. Let's place `m` white queens in a `k x l` rectangle in the top-left corner of the board. This means `m = k * l`.\n3.  **Identifying Safe Zones**:\n    *   Queens in a `k x l` block at the top-left attack all squares in the first `k` rows and the first `l` columns.\n    *   The squares not attacked by rows or columns form a large `(16-k) x (16-l)` rectangle in the bottom-right of the board. This will be our candidate zone for placing the black queens.\n    *   We must also ensure these candidate squares are not attacked diagonally by any white queen.\n4.  **Diagonal Check**:\n    *   A square `(r, c)` has a main diagonal index `d = r - c` and an anti-diagonal index `s = r + c`.\n    *   For the chosen placement, the white queens and the candidate black queen squares have non-overlapping anti-diagonal indices, so we only need to check for main diagonal attacks.\n    *   We will calculate all main diagonal indices occupied by the white queens. Then, we will count how many squares in the candidate zone for black queens are \"safe\" (i.e., their diagonal index is not one of the white queen's diagonal indices).\n5.  **Finding `m`**: The number of black queens we can place is equal to the number of these safe squares. For a valid solution, the number of safe squares must be at least `m`. We will test different values for `k` and `l` to find the largest `m` where `number_of_safe_squares >= m`.\n    *   Testing `m = 5 * 6 = 30` shows there are exactly 30 safe squares, satisfying the condition (`30 >= 30`).\n    *   Testing `m = 6 * 6 = 36` shows there are only 20 safe squares, which is less than 36. This fails.\n    *   This suggests that the maximum `m` is 30.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan for `m=30` to demonstrate that it is a valid solution and likely the maximum.\n\n```python\ndef solve_queen_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of safe squares for black queens given a placement of\n    white queens on a 16x16 board.\n\n    The strategy is to place m white queens in a k x l block in the top-left\n    corner and find how many black queens can be placed in the remaining space\n    without being attacked.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 16\n    \n    # We test the case for m = 30, which we hypothesize is the maximum.\n    # This corresponds to a 5x6 block of white queens.\n    k = 5\n    l = 6\n    m = k * l\n\n    # Step 1: Determine the diagonal indices covered by the white queens.\n    # White queens are placed in the top-left k x l block.\n    # For this arrangement, only main diagonals can conflict.
