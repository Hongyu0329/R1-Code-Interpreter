    "In statistical field theory, the behavior of a system near a critical point can be analyzed using the Renormalization Group (RG). For the `ϕ⁴` theory in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, the RG flow of the coupling constant `u` is described by the beta function `β(u)`. A fixed point `u*` of this flow occurs when the beta function is zero, i.e., `β(u*) = 0`. At this point, the theory becomes scale-invariant.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  State the one-loop beta function for the `ϕ⁴` theory's dimensionless coupling `u` in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions.\n2.  Set the beta function to zero to find the fixed point condition.\n3.  Solve the resulting equation for the non-trivial fixed point `u*`. This gives the leading order expression for `u*` in terms of `ϵ`.\n4.  Use Python to calculate the numerical coefficient in this expression and print the final equation clearly.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and displays the leading order expression for the \n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: The Beta Function\")\n    print(\"In phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions (where d = 4 - ε), the one-loop beta function for the dimensionless coupling 'u' is:\")\n    print(\"β(u) = -εu + (3 / (16 * π²)) * u² + O(u³)\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: The Fixed Point Condition\")\n    print(\"A fixed point u* is a value of the coupling where the theory is scale-invariant, meaning β(u*) = 0.\")\n    print(\"Setting the leading terms of the beta function to zero gives:\")\n    print(\"-εu* + (3 / (16 * π²)) * (u*)² = 0\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Solving for the Fixed Point u*\")\n    print(\"This equation has two solutions.
