    "To determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Apply a key theorem:** A theorem by R. Steinberg states that for a semisimple, simply-connected group $G$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the order of its Weyl group, $|W(G)|$.\n2.  **Verify the conditions:** A group of type $E_8$ is simple (and thus semisimple). Furthermore, its root lattice is equal to its weight lattice, which implies the group is both simply-connected and of adjoint type. Therefore, Steinberg's theorem is applicable.\n3.  **Calculate the order of the Weyl group:** The problem reduces to finding the order of the Weyl group of type $E_8$. The order of a Weyl group can be calculated by taking the product of the degrees of the fundamental invariants of its corresponding polynomial algebra.\n4.  **Use the known degrees for $E_8$:** For type $E_8$, the rank is 8, and the degrees of the fundamental invariants are well-known to be 2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, and 30.\n5.  **Compute the product:** The final step is to multiply these degrees together to get the order of the Weyl group, which equals the number of maximal tori.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to perform this calculation and display the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_e8_tori_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori for a group of type E8.\n\n    This number is equal to the order of the Weyl group of type E_8, |W(E_8)|.\n    The order is calculated as the product of the degrees of the fundamental\n    invariants of the Weyl group.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The degrees of the fundamental invariants for the Weyl group of type E_8.\n    degrees = [2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30]\n\n    # Calculate the order of the Weyl group by taking the product of the degrees.\n    weyl_group_order = math.prod(degrees)\n\n    # Explanation for the user\n    print(\"The number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group G of type E_8 is given by the order of its Weyl group, |W(E_8)|.\")\n    print(\"A group of type E_8 is simple and simply-connected, so this theorem applies regardless of the field q.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe order of the Weyl group is the product of the degrees of its fundamental invariants.\")\n    print(\"For E_8, the degrees are: 2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30.\")\n    \n    # Create a string representation of the multiplication\n    equation_str = \" * \".join(map(str, degrees))\n    \n    # Print the final calculation and result\n    print(\"\\nThe total number of F_q-rational maximal tori is:\")\n    print(f\"|W(E_8)| = {equation_str} = {weyl_group_order:,}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_e8_tori_number()\n```\n<<<696729600>>>"
