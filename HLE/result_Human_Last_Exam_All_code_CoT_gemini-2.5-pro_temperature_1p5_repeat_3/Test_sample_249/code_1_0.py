    Calculates the minimum possible diameter of an undirected tree

    1.  Calculate the number of internal vertices: I = n + 2 - m.
    2.  Check if the number of leaves 'm' is large or small compared to 'n'.
        The threshold is m >= (n+1)/2.
    3.  If m < (n+1)/2 ("few leaves"), the internal vertices form a path.

    4.  If m >= (n+1)/2 ("many leaves"), the internal vertices form a compact star.
