    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **State the principles:** We will use two key principles from quantum mechanics:\n    *   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (`Δx`) and momentum (`Δp`) must be at least `ħ / 2`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant. We'll use the minimum uncertainty for this calculation: `Δx * Δp = ħ / 2`. From this, we can express the uncertainty in momentum as `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`.\n    *   **Bohr Model of the Atom:** For an electron in the first Bohr orbit (n=1), the angular momentum is quantized as `L = p * r = n * ħ`. For n=1, the radius `r` is the Bohr radius `a₀`. Therefore, the momentum `p` of the electron is `p = ħ / a₀`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum to the momentum itself, which is `Δp / p`.\n    *   Substitute the expressions from step 1: `(ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a₀)`.\n    *   Simplify the expression. The reduced Planck constant `ħ` cancels out, leaving us with: `Ratio = a₀ / (2 * Δx)`.\n\n3.  **Plug in the values and calculate:**\n    *   The Bohr radius, `a₀ ≈ 5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹ m`.\n    *   The given uncertainty in position, `Δx = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m = 1 x 10⁻¹¹ m`.\n    *   Calculate the ratio using the simplified formula.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the physical constants and given values\n# Bohr radius (a_0) in meters\na_0 = 5.29177e-11  # meters\n\n# Given uncertainty in position (delta_x) in picometers and convert to meters\ndelta_x_pm = 10\ndelta_x_m = delta_x_pm * 1e-12 # meters\n\n# The ratio of the uncertainty in momentum (delta_p) to the momentum (p) is derived as:\n# delta_p / p = (ħ / (2 * delta_x)) / (ħ / a_0) = a_0 / (2 * delta_x)\n# where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n# Calculate the ratio\nratio = a_0 / (2 * delta_x_m)\n\n# Print the final equation with the numbers plugged in\nprint(\"The ratio is calculated using the formula: Ratio = a_0 / (2 * Δx)\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {a_0} / (2 * {delta_x_m})\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal calculated ratio:\")\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<<<2.645885>>>"
