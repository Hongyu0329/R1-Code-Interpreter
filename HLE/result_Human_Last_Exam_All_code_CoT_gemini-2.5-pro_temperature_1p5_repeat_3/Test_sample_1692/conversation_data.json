    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  An elementary cellular automaton evolves from one generation to the next based on a specific rule. There are 256 possible rules, numbered 0 to 255.\n2.  The state of a cell in the next generation is determined by the state of itself and its left and right neighbors in the current generation. This means we look at a 3-cell pattern (e.g., '101', '001'). There are 8 such patterns.\n3.  The problem is to find the intermediate state (`????????`). Since we don't know the rule, we must find the single rule that transforms the initial state to an intermediate state, and then transforms that intermediate state to the final state.\n4.  My approach will be to iterate through all 256 possible rules.\n5.  For each rule, I will:\n    a. Apply the rule to the initial state (`01101001`) to generate a candidate for the intermediate state.\n    b. Apply the same rule to this new intermediate state to generate a candidate for the final state.\n    c. Compare this generated final state with the known final state (`10000111`).\n    d. If they match, I have found the correct rule and the unique intermediate state. I will then print this state as the solution. I will assume periodic boundary conditions, which is standard for these automata (the neighbor of the rightmost cell is the leftmost cell, and vice-versa).\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cellular_automaton():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intermediate step in a 1D elementary cellular automaton sequence\n    by testing all 256 possible rules.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    gen1 = \"01101001\"\n    gen3 = \"10000111\"\n    width = len(gen1)\n    \n    # Helper function to apply a rule to a state\n    def apply_rule(state, rule_num):\n        # Convert the rule number to its 8-bit binary representation.\n        # This binary string defines the output for the 8 possible neighborhoods.\n        # e.g., Rule 30 is 00011110 in binary.
