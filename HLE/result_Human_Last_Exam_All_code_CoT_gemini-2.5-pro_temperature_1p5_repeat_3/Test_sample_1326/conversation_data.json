    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of the piecewise function `p(x)` over the interval from `x = 0` to `x = 4`.\n\nThe function `p(x)` has two different definitions over the integration range:\n1.  From `x = 0` to `x = 3`, the function is $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8}$.\n2.  From `x = 3` to `x = 4`, the function is $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{(1+\\cos x)}$.\n\nTherefore, we must split the total integral into two parts:\n1.  Calculate the integral of the first expression from `x = 0` to `x = 3`.\n2.  Calculate the integral of the second expression from `x = 3` to `x = 4`.\n3.  The final result will be the sum of these two integrals.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this plan using the `scipy.integrate.quad` function, which is a standard method for numerical integration.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define the first part of the function for the interval [0, 3]\ndef part1(x):\n    return (2 * x**3) / 8\n\n# Define the second part of the function for the interval [3, 5]\ndef part2(x):\n    # Using np.exp, np.sin, np.cos for robust numerical computation\n    return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n# Define the integration limits\nlower_bound = 0\nmid_point = 3\nupper_bound = 4\n\n# Calculate the integral for the first part [0, 3]\n# The result is a tuple (value, estimated_error)\nintegral1, error1 = quad(part1, lower_bound, mid_point)\n\n# Calculate the integral for the second part [3, 4]\nintegral2, error2 = quad(part2, mid_point, upper_bound)\n\n# The total integral is the sum of the two parts\ntotal_integral = integral1 + integral2\n\n# Print the value of each integral and the final equation\nprint(f\"The integral from {lower_bound} to {mid_point} is: {integral1}\")\nprint(f\"The integral from {mid_point} to {upper_bound} is: {integral2}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe total integral is the sum:\")\nprint(f\"{integral1} + ({integral2}) = {total_integral}\")\n```\n<<<-397.4601193309539>>>"
