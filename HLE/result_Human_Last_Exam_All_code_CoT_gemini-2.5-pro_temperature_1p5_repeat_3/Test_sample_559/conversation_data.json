    "Here is my plan to find the separatrix of the system:\n1.  First, I will identify the equilibrium points (also known as critical points) of the system of differential equations. These are the points $(d, u)$ where both $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$ are equal to zero.\n2.  Next, I will analyze the stability of these equilibrium points. This is done by linearizing the system at each point, which involves computing the Jacobian matrix and its eigenvalues. The type of equilibrium point (e.g., node, source, saddle) is determined by the nature of these eigenvalues.\n3.  A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are classic examples of separatrices. Therefore, after identifying a saddle point, I will focus on finding its manifolds.\n4.  To find the equation for a manifold, which is itself a trajectory, I will search for an \"invariant curve\" of the system. This is a curve $f(d, u) = c$ such that if a trajectory starts on the curve, it stays on the curve for all time. I will test a simple algebraic form, such as $d = k u^n$, and check if it satisfies the system's phase plane equation $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)}$.\n5.  Once I find an invariant curve, I will verify that it passes through the saddle point.\n6.  To confirm it's the correct manifold (stable or unstable), I will compute the eigenvectors at the saddle point. The tangent to the invariant curve at the saddle point must align with one of these eigenvectors.\n7.  The equation of this invariant curve is the equation of the separatrix.\n8.  Finally, I will write a Python script that prints the equation of the separatrix, clearly stating the coefficients as requested.\n\nHere is the step-by-step execution of the plan:\n\n**Step 1: Find equilibrium points**\nThe system is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nSet $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$. This gives $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n-   If $u=0$, the first equation becomes $d' = 2d^2 = 0$, which gives $d=0$. So, $(0, 0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n-   If $u=1$, the first equation becomes $d' = 2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 2d^2+2d = 2d(d+1)=0$, which gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. So, $(0, 1)$ and $(-1, 1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\nThe equilibrium points are $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(-1, 1)$.\n\n**Step 2 & 3: Classify equilibrium points (find the saddle)**\nThe Jacobian matrix of the system is:\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3+10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n-   At $(0, 1)$: $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=2, \\lambda_2=1$. Both are positive, so $(0, 1)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n-   At $(-1, 1)$: $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=-2, \\lambda_2=1$. Since they have opposite signs, $(-1, 1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n**Step 4, 5, 6, & 7: Find the separatrix**\nThe separatrix is related to the manifolds of the saddle point $(-1, 1)$. Let's test for a simple invariant curve of the form $d=-u^2$.\n\nTo check if $d(t) = -u(t)^2$ is a solution curve, we differentiate it with respect to $t$:\n$d'(t) = -2u(t)u'(t) = -2u(t) \\cdot (u^2(t)(u(t)-1)) = -2u^4(t) + 2u^3(t)$.\n\nNow, we substitute $d=-u^2$ into the first differential equation:\n$d'(t) = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n$d'(t) = 2u^4 - ( -3u^3 + 5u^4 ) - u^3 + u^4$\n$d'(t) = 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$\n$d'(t) = (2 - 5 + 1)u^4 + (3 - 1)u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nThe two expressions for $d'(t)$ are identical. This confirms that $d = -u^2$ is an invariant curve. This curve passes through the saddle point $(-1, 1)$ because when $u=1$, $d=-(1)^2=-1$.\n\nTo confirm it corresponds to a manifold, we check the tangent at $(-1,1)$. The curve $d+u^2=0$ has a normal vector $(1, 2u)$, which is $(1,2)$ at $(-1,1)$. The tangent vector is orthogonal to the normal, so it is in the direction $(-2,1)$.\nThe unstable eigenvector for the Jacobian at $(-1,1)$ is for $\\lambda=1$:\n$(J - 1 \\cdot I)v = \\begin{pmatrix} -3 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_d \\\\ v_u \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\implies -3v_d - 6v_u = 0 \\implies v_d = -2v_u$.\nThe unstable eigenvector is proportional to $(-2, 1)$.\nSince the tangent to the curve $d=-u^2$ at the saddle point matches the unstable eigenvector, this curve is the unstable manifold of the saddle. Unstable manifolds of saddle points are separatrices.\n\nThe equation for the separatrix is $d = -u^2$, which can be rewritten as $d + u^2 = 0$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the variables\nd, u = sympy.symbols('d u')\n\n# Define the equation of the separatrix\n# The equation is d = -u^2, which can be written as 1*d + 1*u**2 = 0\ncoeff_d = 1\ncoeff_u2 = 1\nconstant = 0\n\n# Create the equation object for printing\nequation = sympy.Eq(coeff_d * d + coeff_u2 * u**2, constant)\n\nprint(\"The equation of the separatrix is:\")\nprint(equation)\nprint(\"\\nIn the format A*d + B*u**2 = C, the coefficients are:\")\nprint(f\"A = {coeff_d}\")\nprint(f\"B = {coeff_u2}\")\nprint(f\"C = {constant}\")\n\n# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n# Here we print them again, clearly labeled.\nprint(\"\\nThe numbers in the final equation d + u**2 = 0 are:\")\nprint(f\"The coefficient of d is: {coeff_d}\")\nprint(f\"The coefficient of u**2 is: {coeff_u2}\")\nprint(f\"The constant on the right side is: {constant}\")\n```\n<<<d + u**2 = 0>>>"
