# visits Woland's apartment. After being told he will die of liver cancer, as he is leaving, a house
# sparrow flies into the room, knocks over a golden platter, and causes a commotion.
moscow_character = "Sokov"

# under the golden ceiling, momentarily distracting Pontius Pilate from the trial.
jerusalem_bird = "barn swallow"
jerusalem_character = "Pontius Pilate"

# Step 3: Format and print the final answer as requested.
final_answer = f"{moscow_character}; {jerusalem_bird}; {jerusalem_character}"
print(final_answer)
