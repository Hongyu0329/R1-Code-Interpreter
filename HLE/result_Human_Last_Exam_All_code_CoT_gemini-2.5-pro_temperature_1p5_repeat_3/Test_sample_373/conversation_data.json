    "My plan is to solve this problem by first clearly defining the graph structure and the sampling process, and then calculating the desired probability.\n\n1.  **Define the Graph Structure**: The term \"barbell graph with 10 nodes\" most commonly refers to a graph constructed by taking two separate, equal-sized complete graphs (cliques) and connecting them with a single edge. In this case, with 10 nodes total, we have two 5-node complete graphs (K₅). The single edge connecting them is the \"bottleneck edge.\"\n2.  **Understand the Sampling Process**: \"Randomized uniform gossiping\" implies that at each step, an edge is chosen uniformly at random from the entire set of edges in the graph. The task is to find the probability of choosing the specific bottleneck edge.\n3.  **Calculate the Total Number of Edges**: The total number of edges in the graph is the sum of the edges in the first clique, the edges in the second clique, and the single bottleneck edge.\n    *   The number of edges in a complete graph with *n* nodes is given by the formula: `n * (n - 1) / 2`. For our 5-node cliques (K₅), this is `5 * (5 - 1) / 2 = 10` edges per clique.\n    *   Total edges = (edges in clique 1) + (edges in clique 2) + (bottleneck edge) = 10 + 10 + 1 = 21.\n4.  **Calculate the Probability**: The probability of sampling a specific edge is the number of favorable outcomes (1, since there's one bottleneck edge) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (the total number of edges).\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to formalize these calculations and print the final probability as an equation showing its components, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_barbell_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph.\n\n    A barbell graph with 10 nodes is defined as two complete 5-node graphs (K5)\n    connected by a single bridge edge (the bottleneck).\n\n    Randomized uniform gossiping involves selecting one edge uniformly at random\n    from all edges in the graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters based on the problem description\n    total_nodes = 10\n    num_cliques = 2\n    num_bottleneck_edges = 1\n\n    # 1.
