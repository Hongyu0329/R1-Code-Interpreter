    # Step 1: Patient's initial symptoms (agitation, insomnia, hypersexuality, careless spending) strongly suggest a manic episode, characteristic of Bipolar Disorder.
    # Step 2: The family history of mood disorders supports the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder.
    # Step 3: The standard medication for Bipolar Disorder is Lithium.
    # Step 4: A new symptom, decreased libido, appears after medication is started.
    # Step 5: A well-known side effect of Lithium is hypothyroidism.
    # Step 6: A common symptom of hypothyroidism is sexual dysfunction, including decreased libido.
    # Step 7: This creates a direct causal link: Bipolar Disorder -> Lithium -> Hypothyroidism -> Sexual Dysfunction. The heavy metal exposure history is a distractor.
