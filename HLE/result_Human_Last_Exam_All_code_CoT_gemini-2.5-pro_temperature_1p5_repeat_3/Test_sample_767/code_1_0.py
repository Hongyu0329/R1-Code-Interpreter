def solve_limit_calculation():
    """
    This function calculates the exact value of the limit lim_{N->inf} p(N)/N based on analytical insights.

    The limit is determined by the cases where the number of solutions (m,n) grows linearly with N.
    This occurs for two sets of coefficient values:
    1. a=b=c=d=e=f=0: The equation becomes F_n + g = 0.
    2. a=b=c=d=e=0, f=-1, g=0: The equation becomes F_n - F_m = 0.

    Other coefficient choices yield a finite number of (m,n) solutions, contributing a constant to p(N),
    which does not affect the limit.
