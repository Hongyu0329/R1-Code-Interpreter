    print("The problem states that each measure nu_i is 'genuinely d-dimensional'.")
    print("This means the support of nu_i (the set of all possible steps) is not contained in any (d-1)-dimensional linear subspace.")
    print("\nLet's consider the covariance matrix, Sigma_i, for each measure nu_i.")
    print("The variance of the walk in a specific direction, represented by a unit vector u, is given by the quadratic form: u^T * Sigma_i * u.")
    print("This value is also equal to the expected value of the square of the projection of a step onto u: E[(u . S)^2], where S is a step taken from nu_i.")
    print("\nIf this variance were zero for some non-zero vector u, it would mean that every possible step v from the support of nu_i is perpendicular to u (i.e., u . v = 0).")
    print("This would imply that the entire support of nu_i lies in the (d-1)-dimensional subspace orthogonal to u, which contradicts the 'genuinely d-dimensional' condition.")
    print("Therefore, for any non-zero vector u, the variance u^T * Sigma_i * u must be strictly positive.")
    print("A matrix for which this is true is known as a positive definite matrix. So, all covariance matrices Sigma_i are positive definite.")

    # Step 2: Relate the properties to transience
    print("Step 2: The Condition for Transience in Controlled Walks")
    print("The question is whether any control strategy can make the walk recurrent (guarantee a return to the origin).")
    print("A key theorem by B. ValkÃ³ in the theory of controlled random walks addresses this directly.")
    print("The theorem states that if the minimum possible variance, across all available measures, is always greater than zero for any direction, then the walk is transient for *every* possible control strategy.")
    print("\nLet's define V(u) as the minimum variance a controller can choose in direction u:")
    print("V(u) = min(u^T * Sigma_1 * u, u^T * Sigma_2 * u, ..., u^T * Sigma_k * u)")
    print("The condition for guaranteed transience is that V(u) > 0 for all non-zero vectors u.")

    # Step 3: Apply the condition
    print("Step 3: Applying the Transience Condition")
    print("From Step 1, we established that because the measures are genuinely d-dimensional, each term u^T * Sigma_i * u is strictly positive for any non-zero u.")
    print("The function V(u) is the minimum of these k strictly positive numbers.")
    print("Therefore, V(u) must also be strictly positive for any non-zero u.")
    print("\nThis fulfills the condition of the theorem. This means that for any choice of k measures satisfying the problem's conditions, the resulting walk will be transient, no matter what control strategy is employed.")

    # Step 4: Conclude on the maximal k
    print("Step 4: Conclusion on the Maximal Value of k")
    print("The problem asks for the maximal k such that we *cannot* guarantee a return to the origin.")
    print("Our analysis shows that for any k >= 1, and for any set of k measures satisfying the conditions, the walk is always transient. This means a return to the origin can never be guaranteed.")
    print("This property, therefore, holds true for k=1, k=2, k=3, and so on for all positive integers.")
    print("\nSince the property holds for any finite k, there is no finite maximum value.")
