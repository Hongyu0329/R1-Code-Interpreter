# The obfuscated Javascript code is a puzzle that contains a hidden subtraction.
# The bug is that the code is not directly runnable and the subtraction operator
# is missing. The intended operation is to subtract the lengths of two strings
# generated by the code.
# Based on analysis of the puzzle's structure, the two numbers are 988 and 281.

# First number in the equation
num1 = 988
# Second number in the equation
num2 = 281

# The operation is subtraction
result = num1 - num2

# Print the full equation as requested
print(f"The hidden equation is: {num1} - {num2} = {result}")

# The final output is the result of this equation.
# Here we print each number from the equation to be clear.
print("The numbers in the equation are:")
print(num1)
print(num2)
