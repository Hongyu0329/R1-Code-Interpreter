    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case when solving a 3x3 Rubik's Cube with the CFOP method, a minimum of **five** non-top-facing stickers must be seen.\n\nThis is based on the principle of 2-side PLL recognition, a common advanced technique used by speedcubers. When viewing two adjacent faces of the last layer, a total of six stickers are visible (three on each face, excluding the top-colored stickers). However, not all of this information is necessary to uniquely determine which of the 21 PLL cases is present.\n\nThe sufficiency of five stickers is explained by the concept of \"Straughan Recognition,\" which focuses on identifying a case by the minimum number of required stickers. The logic behind this is as follows:\n\n*   **Corner Permutation:** By observing one sticker on each of the three visible corner pieces, the position and orientation of these corners can be determined. Due to the mechanical constraints of the cube, the state of these three corners is enough to deduce the permutation of the fourth, unseen corner.\n*   **Edge Permutation:** The positions of the two visible edge pieces can be identified by their stickers. Because of parity rules in a 3x3 cube, once the corner permutation is known, the permutation of two edges determines the only possible valid permutation for the remaining two edges.\n\nTherefore, the information from one sticker on each of the three visible corners (three stickers) and the two visible edge stickers (two stickers) is enough to distinguish between all 21 PLL cases. While many cubers learn to recognize PLLs using the full six stickers from two sides, it is not strictly necessary, and with advanced techniques, the recognition can be made with just five.\n\n<<<5>>>"
