    "The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose container ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment is a critical factor in ensuring patient safety and preventing microbial contamination. According to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797>, which sets the standards for compounding sterile preparations, there is a distinct difference in the handling of single-dose vials versus single-dose ampules once they have been opened.\n\nWhile a single-dose *vial* that is punctured in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner air environment may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial entry, the guidance for ampules is much stricter. Once an ampule is opened, it cannot be resealed, leaving the contents exposed to the environment. For this reason, **opened single-dose ampules must not be stored for any period of time** and any unused portion must be discarded immediately after use.\n\nIf a single-dose container is used for an immediate-use compounded sterile preparation (CSP), the administration must begin within four hours of the preparation. However, for an ampule, the contents should be used for a single patient and any remainder discarded at the end of the procedure.\n\nIn an environment with air quality less than ISO Class 5, a single-dose vial must be discarded within one hour of being punctured.\n\n<<<Opened single-dose ampules must not be stored and should be discarded immediately after use.>>>"
