    "The best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is determined by the largest known construction of such a set. A cap set in dimension *n*, formally a subset of the affine space AG(n,3), is a collection of points where no three points lie on a single line.\n\nThe sizes of the largest cap sets are known for lower dimensions. For instance, the maximum size of a cap set in dimension 4 is 20, and in dimension 6 is 112. A straightforward method to establish a lower bound for the size of a cap set in a higher dimension is to take the Cartesian product of known caps. For dimension 8, one can take the product of two caps from dimension 4, which yields a cap of size 20 × 20 = 400. An even better lower bound can be obtained by taking the product of a cap from dimension 2 (with a size of 4) and a cap from dimension 6 (with a size of 112), resulting in a cap set of size 4 × 112 = 448.\n\nWhile this establishes a rigorous lower bound of 448, more intricate constructions can yield larger caps. Research in this area has produced better lower bounds for various dimensions. Based on the provided options and the landscape of known results, the best-known lower bound is a specific value obtained from such a construction.\n\nOf the choices provided, 496 is the correct, best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8.\n\n<<<F>>>"
