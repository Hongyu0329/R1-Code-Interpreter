    "The number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a surface code patch depends on its topology, specifically the number of holes and the nature of their boundaries. For two separate patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits encoded in each.\n\nA standard surface code patch on a planar surface with *b* simple holes (or boundaries) can encode *b* logical qubits. Under this common scheme, a patch with two holes would encode two logical qubits. Therefore, two such patches would encode a total of four logical qubits.\n\nHowever, more advanced encoding schemes, known as generalized surface codes, utilize different types of boundaries for the holes (e.g., \"mixed boundaries\"). These schemes can store information more densely. Research has established encoding methods where a planar patch with *b* holes can encode up to 2*b* - 1 logical qubits. For a patch with two holes, this would yield 2*2 - 1 = 3 logical qubits, leading to a total of six for two patches.\n\nFurthermore, specific optimized architectures have been proposed that can encode even more information. One such example is a \"mixed diamond-hole surface code,\" which has been shown to encode **five logical qubits** in a single patch with just two holes.\n\nGiven that the question asks for the maximum number of logical qubits, we consider this most efficient, demonstrated encoding scheme. If each of the two patches can encode five logical qubits, the total number is:\n\n*   Patch 1: 5 logical qubits\n*   Patch 2: 5 logical qubits\n*   **Total: 10 logical qubits**\n\n<<<10>>>"
