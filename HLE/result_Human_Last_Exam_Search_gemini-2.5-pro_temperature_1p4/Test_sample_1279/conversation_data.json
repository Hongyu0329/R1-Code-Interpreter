    "In φ⁴ scalar field theory, the vacuum bubble diagrams are diagrams with no external lines. The order of a diagram is given by the number of vertices. Second-order vacuum bubble diagrams, therefore, contain two vertices, each corresponding to a factor of the coupling constant λ. There are three such diagrams. We will calculate the symmetry factor for each and then sum them.\n\n### The Three Second-Order Vacuum Bubble Diagrams\n\n1.  **The \"Setting-Sun\" Diagram:** This diagram consists of two vertices connected to each other by four propagators.\n\n2.  **The \"Saturn\" Diagram:** This diagram features two vertices connected by two propagators. Additionally, each vertex has a single propagator starting and ending on itself, forming a loop.\n\n3.  **The Disconnected Diagram:** This diagram is composed of two separate first-order vacuum bubble diagrams. Each of these first-order bubbles consists of a single vertex with two propagators starting and ending on it, forming two loops.\n\n### Calculation of Symmetry Factors\n\nThe symmetry factor, S, of a Feynman diagram is the order of the group of automorphisms of the diagram, which are the permutations of internal lines and vertices that leave the diagram unchanged.\n\n1.  **The \"Setting-Sun\" Diagram:**\n    *   The four propagators connecting the two vertices are identical. They can be permuted in 4! = 24 ways.\n    *   The two vertices are also identical and can be swapped, which gives a factor of 2.\n    *   These two types of symmetries are independent. Therefore, the total symmetry factor is the product of these factors.\n    *   S₁ = 4! × 2 = 24 × 2 = 48.\n\n2.  **The \"Saturn\" Diagram:**\n    *   There are two identical propagators connecting the two vertices. These can be swapped, giving a factor of 2.\n    *   The two vertices are in a symmetric configuration. Swapping the two vertices (along with their respective loops) leaves the diagram unchanged. This provides another factor of 2.\n    *   The total symmetry factor is the product of these independent symmetries.\n    *   S₂ = 2 × 2 = 4.\n\n3.  **The Disconnected Diagram:**\n    *   This diagram consists of two identical, disconnected components. First, we need the symmetry factor of a single first-order vacuum bubble (one vertex with two loops). The symmetry factor for this sub-diagram is S₀ = 8. This comes from the ability to swap the two loops (factor of 2) and to swap the two ends of each of the two propagators (a factor of 2 for each propagator, resulting in 2 × 2 = 4). Thus, S₀ = 2 × 4 = 8.\n    *   For a diagram composed of *n* identical disconnected sub-diagrams, each with a symmetry factor of S₀, the total symmetry factor is given by S = n! × (S₀)ⁿ.\n    *   In this case, n=2 and S₀=8, so the symmetry factor is:\n    *   S₃ = 2! × (8)² = 2 × 64 = 128.\n\n### Sum of the Symmetry Factors\n\nThe final step is to sum the symmetry factors of these three diagrams:\n\nTotal Symmetry Factor = S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 48 + 4 + 128 = 180.\n\n<<<180>>>"
