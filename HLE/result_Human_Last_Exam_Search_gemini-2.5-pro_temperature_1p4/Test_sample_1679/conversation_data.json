    "**An American in Paris (1951)** was the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\nThe film features an extended ballet sequence at its climax, a significant portion of which is set in a stylized representation of Paris. This dream-like sequence was designed in the style of various famous painters. The opening of the ballet is a tribute to the artist Raoul Dufy and portrays the Place de la Concorde. In this artistic recreation of the famous Parisian square, a two-dimensional, stylized version of the Luxor Obelisk is visible. The set for this sequence included a replica of the famous fountain in the Place de la Concorde. A model of this fountain, designed by Preston Ames and Irene Sharaff in the style of Dufy, is preserved at the National Museum of American History.\n\nWhile the majority of *An American in Paris* was filmed on MGM studio lots in Hollywood, this elaborate and artistically rendered sequence serves as the film's depiction of the iconic landmark.\n\nAnother Best Picture winner, *Gigi* (1958), also features the Place de la Concorde. Unlike *An American in Paris*, *Gigi* was partially filmed on location in Paris, and includes scenes at the actual Place de la Concorde, where the Luxor Obelisk and its surrounding fountains are located. However, as *An American in Paris* was released and won the Best Picture Oscar seven years prior, it holds the distinction of being the first.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
