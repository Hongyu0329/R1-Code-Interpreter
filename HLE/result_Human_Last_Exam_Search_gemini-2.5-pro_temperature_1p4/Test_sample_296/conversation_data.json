    "The Grigorchuk group has **21** subgroups of index 4.\n\nThis result is based on a classification of the subgroups of small index in the first Grigorchuk group. The subgroups of index 4 are divided into two categories: normal and non-normal subgroups.\n\n*   **Normal Subgroups of Index 4:** There are **7** normal subgroups of index 4. The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group, which is the quotient group by its commutator subgroup `G/[G,G]`, is isomorphic to the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2, i.e., `(Z/2Z)^3`. The normal subgroups of index 4 correspond to the subgroups of index 4 in this abelian group. A subgroup of index 4 in `(Z/2Z)^3` is a subgroup of order 2. There are `(2^3 - 1) / (2-1) = 7` such subgroups. The preimages of these subgroups in the Grigorchuk group are its 7 normal subgroups of index 4.\n\n*   **Non-Normal Subgroups of Index 4:** In addition to the normal subgroups, there are **14** non-normal subgroups of index 4. These subgroups are not normal in the entire Grigorchuk group. Their existence is a more intricate aspect of the group's structure and they fall into distinct conjugacy classes.\n\nTherefore, the total number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group is the sum of the normal and non-normal subgroups: 7 + 14 = 21.\n\n<<<21>>>"
