    "The primary distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement and movement of the hips.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, a strong emphasis is placed on maintaining a stable and square placement of the hips. The backbend, or cambré, is initiated from the upper and middle back, with the waistline kept lifted and long. This technique isolates the movement to the spine, requiring significant control and flexibility in the back, while the hips act as a solid foundation.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method often features a more dynamic and less rigid use of the torso. This can include \"swaying hips,\" which is a notable characteristic of the style. This technique creates a different aesthetic line and quality of movement, integrating the hips into the backbend. The Balanchine style is also known for its speed and exaggerated lines, which this use of the hips facilitates. While there are also differences in arm and head placement, the approach to the hips represents a more fundamental technical divergence between the two methods.\n\n<<<B>>>"
