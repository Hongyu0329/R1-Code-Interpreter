    "The island town that is more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island and sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera that shares the town's name is Hanga Roa on Easter Island.\n\nHanga Roa is the capital and main settlement of Easter Island, a Chilean territory in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. The name \"Hanga Roa\" translates to \"wide bay\" or \"long bay\" in the native Rapa Nui language, and it refers to both the town and the bay on which it is situated.\n\nThe town is nestled on the lowlands between the extinct volcanoes of Terevaka and Rano Kau. The bay of Hanga Roa was formed by the volcanic caldera of Rano Kau. Easter Island is renowned for its extreme isolation, being one of the most remote inhabited islands globally, and is famous for its monumental statues called moai.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
