It is possible for a fully functional MRI receive coil to show no resonance when tested with a magnetic loop antenna and a vector network analyzer (VNA) due to several factors related to modern coil design. These include RF shielding that blocks external magnetic fields, complex coil geometries like phased arrays with decoupling networks that isolate coil elements, the requirement for the coil to be "loaded" with a patient or phantom to resonate correctly, and active detuning circuits that may be preventing resonance if not properly controlled during the test.
