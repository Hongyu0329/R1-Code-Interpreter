The final state of the system is a probabilistic ensemble of five possible states. When ququint A is measured, it will collapse to one of the basis states $|i\rangle_A$ (for i=0 to 4), and the state of the entire system will become one of the following, with the specified probability:
1.  With 20% probability, the final state is $|0\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B)$.
2.  With 20% probability, the final state is $|1\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B)$.
3.  With 30% probability, the final state is $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
4.  With 20% probability, the final state is $|3\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
5.  With 10% probability, the final state is $|4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$.
