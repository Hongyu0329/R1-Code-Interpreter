    "Based on a thorough review of available philosophical and historical sources, there is no evidence to indicate that any philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School of thought decomposed the notion of a \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals.\"\n\nThe Lviv-Warsaw School, founded by Kazimierz Twardowski, was a prominent philosophical movement in Poland that made significant contributions to logic, semantics, and the philosophy of language. Key figures associated with this school include Alfred Tarski, Jan Łukasiewicz, and Tadeusz Kotarbiński. Their work primarily focused on formal logic, theory of truth, and analytical philosophy. While semiotics, the study of signs, was an area of interest within the school, there is no record of a specific theory that employs the terms \"hallmark,\" \"symptoms,\" and \"signals\" in the manner described.\n\nThe distinction between \"symptoms\" and \"signals\" is more closely associated with the German linguist and psychologist Karl Bühler. In his organon model of communication, Bühler differentiated between the functions of language, where a linguistic sign can function as a *symptom* (related to the sender's inner state), a *signal* (appealing to the receiver), and a *symbol* (representing objects and states of affairs). However, research does not show any significant intellectual connection or collaboration between Bühler and the Lviv-Warsaw School that would have led to the adoption of this specific terminology by one of its members.\n\nTherefore, it is highly likely that the premise of the question is based on a misunderstanding of either the specific terminology or the philosophical affiliation of the originator of such a theory.\n\n<<<No Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher is known to have decomposed the notion of a hallmark into symptoms and signals.>>>"
