    "The small molecule represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 is known to interact with several proteins. Based on its bioactivity data in the ChEMBL database, the following protein targets have been identified. For each target, a selection of other small molecules that also form protein-ligand interactions are listed below.\n\n### Cytochrome P450 3A4 (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL340)\n\nCytochrome P450 3A4 is a crucial enzyme primarily found in the liver and intestine, responsible for the metabolism of a large number of drugs and other foreign compounds. The interaction of small molecules with this enzyme can lead to significant drug-drug interactions. The binding site of CYP3A4 is large and can accommodate a wide variety of molecules.\n\nA variety of small molecules are known to inhibit or act as substrates for Cytochrome P450 3A4, including:\n*   **Ketoconazole (CHEMBL768):** An antifungal drug that acts as a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4.\n*   **Ritonavir (CHEMBL774):** An antiretroviral drug used in the treatment of HIV, which also strongly inhibits CYP3A4.\n*   **Erythromycin (CHEMBL66):** A macrolide antibiotic that is both a substrate and an inhibitor of CYP3A4.\n*   **Midazolam (CHEMBL584):** A short-acting benzodiazepine that is a well-known substrate for CYP3A4.\n*   **Tabimorelin (CHEMBL281764):** A small molecule noted as a Cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor.\n\n### Growth arrest-specific protein 6 (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4804247)\n\nGrowth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6) is a vitamin K-dependent protein that functions as a ligand for the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases (Tyro3, Axl, and Mer). The Gas6-TAM signaling pathway is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, survival, and migration, and has been identified as a target in cancer and other diseases.\n\nSmall molecules have been developed to target the interaction between Gas6 and its receptors. These include:\n*   **Bemcentinib (BGB324):** A selective AXL kinase inhibitor that is currently in clinical development for various cancers.\n*   **Amuvatinib (MP-470):** A multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against AXL.\n*   **Dubermatinib (TP-0903):** An AXL inhibitor that has been investigated in clinical trials.\n\n### Anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid kinase (AnmK)\n\nAnhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid kinase is an enzyme found in bacteria that plays a role in the recycling of the bacterial cell wall component peptidoglycan. It catalyzes the phosphorylation of 1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid (anhMurNAc). Due to its importance in bacterial cell wall metabolism and its absence in humans, it is considered a potential target for new antibiotics.\n\nSmall molecules that have been investigated for their interaction with AnmK include:\n*   **Ergotamine (ZINC52955754):** An FDA-approved drug that has been identified as a potential repurposed inhibitor of AnmK through in silico screening.\n*   **Axitinib (ZINC3816287):** Another FDA-approved drug that showed potential interaction with AnmK in computational studies.\n*   **Digoxin (ZINC242548690):** A cardiac glycoside that was also identified as a potential interactor with AnmK through virtual screening.\n*   **Nelfinavir (ZINC3833846):** An antiretroviral drug that has been computationally screened for its potential to inhibit AnmK.\n*   **Nebivolol (ZINC607986):** A beta-blocker that showed potential binding to AnmK in in silico models."
