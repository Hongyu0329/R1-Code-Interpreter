The biochemical reaction that initiated the process of skin blister development was the drug-induced activation of the body's immune system, specifically cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CD8+ T cells) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. This activation triggers a cascade of events leading to widespread apoptosis (programmed cell death) of keratinocytes. The death of these skin cells causes the epidermis to separate from the dermis, resulting in the formation of blisters and peeling skin.

This process is primarily mediated by several key pathways:
*   **The Fas-Fas Ligand (FasL) Pathway**: Activated immune cells release a molecule called Fas ligand. This molecule binds to the Fas receptor on the surface of keratinocytes, initiating an internal signaling cascade that leads to apoptosis.
*   **The Perforin/Granzyme Pathway**: Cytotoxic T-cells release proteins called perforin and granzyme B. Perforin creates pores in the keratinocyte's membrane, allowing granzyme B to enter and trigger cell death.
*   **Granulysin**: This is a key inflammatory molecule released by cytotoxic T-cells that is directly responsible for killing keratinocytes on a large scale.
*   **Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-Î±)**: This cytokine is also released during the immune response and contributes to keratinocyte apoptosis.
