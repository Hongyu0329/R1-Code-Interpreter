    "To determine whether the 1-incidence rate ratio (1-IRR) overestimates, underestimates, or correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine, it is crucial to understand the definitions of these terms and how they relate.\n\n### Defining the Vaccine Models\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine**: This type of vaccine confers complete protection to a certain percentage of vaccinated individuals, while the remainder receive no protection at all and are as susceptible as unvaccinated individuals. For instance, a vaccine with 90% efficacy in an all-or-nothing model means 90% of recipients are fully immune, and 10% are completely susceptible.\n*   **Leaky (or partial efficacy) Vaccine**: This model assumes that the vaccine provides partial protection to all recipients. It reduces the per-exposure risk of infection for every vaccinated person by a certain percentage. A 90% efficacy in a leaky model means every vaccinated person has a 90% lower risk of getting infected each time they are exposed compared to an unvaccinated person.\n\n### Vaccine Efficacy (VE) and the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)\n\nVaccine efficacy (VE) in clinical trials is typically calculated using the formula:\n**VE = 1 - IRR**\n\nWhere the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) is the incidence rate in the vaccinated group divided by the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group.\n\n### Analysis of the All-or-Nothing Model\n\nLet's consider an all-or-nothing vaccine that provides complete protection to a proportion, *p*, of the vaccinated population.\n*   The remaining proportion, *1-p*, of the vaccinated population is not protected and has the same susceptibility as the unvaccinated group.\n*   The incidence rate in the unprotected fraction of the vaccinated group is the same as the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (let's call it *λu*).\n*   The incidence rate in the protected fraction is 0.\n*   Therefore, the overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group (*λv*) is the weighted average: *λv* = (*p* × 0) + ((1-*p*) × *λu*) = (1-*p*) × *λu*.\n*   The Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) is then: IRR = *λv* / *λu* = ((1-*p*) × *λu*) / *λu* = 1-*p*.\n*   Finally, the calculated vaccine efficacy is: VE = 1 - IRR = 1 - (1-*p*) = *p*.\n\nThis shows that for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the standard `1 - IRR` calculation correctly measures *p*, the proportion of the vaccinated population that is fully protected.\n\n### Relating to \"Per-Exposure\" Efficacy\n\nThe term \"per-exposure vaccine efficacy\" is the definitional term for the efficacy in a \"leaky\" vaccine model. It represents the reduction in infection probability for each exposure.\n\nIn an all-or-nothing model, the per-exposure efficacy for any given individual is either 100% (if they are in the protected group) or 0% (if they are in the unprotected group). The measure of VE calculated from the trial (VE = 1 - IRR = *p*) represents the *average* efficacy across the entire vaccinated population.\n\nFrom a clinical trial's data on incidence rates, it is often impossible to distinguish between an all-or-nothing and a leaky vaccine. A measured VE of 90% could mean that 90% of people are fully protected (all-or-nothing), or that all vaccinated people experience a 90% reduction in per-exposure risk (leaky). The time-invariant vaccine efficacy estimator for an all-or-nothing model correctly estimates the proportion of individuals who are completely protected.\n\nTherefore, the `1-incidence rate ratio` correctly estimates the proportion of fully protected individuals in an all-or-nothing model, which can be interpreted as the average per-exposure efficacy across the vaccinated population.\n\n<<<C>>>"
