    "The human GABAAρ1 receptor, encoded by the GABRR1 gene, is a subunit of the GABA-A receptor family of ligand-gated ion channels. Its structure, like other GABAA receptor subunits, consists of a large extracellular N-terminal domain, four transmembrane domains (TM1, TM2, TM3, and TM4), and an intracellular loop connecting TM3 and TM4.\n\nTo determine the number of cysteine residues in the TM3-TM4 linker, the precise locations of these transmembrane domains are required. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor (PDB ID: 8OQ6) provides this detailed information. According to the annotation of this structure, the transmembrane domains are located at the following amino acid positions in the canonical sequence (UniProt ID: P24046):\n\n*   **TM3:** residues 323-344\n*   **TM4:** residues 455-475\n\nThe TM3-TM4 linker, therefore, encompasses the amino acid sequence from position 345 to 454. The sequence for this linker region is:\nIAYCFLIKRSRHDPKDHHHSHQHHHKQPHHHSHTRKRRRAAATAMDTSTIAARTPASSPPARVAAASPGSPLRSPRSQSREAYISEIDRLSRQYDIQYKRGPGEPPAGPR\n\nUpon analysis of this sequence, there is one Cysteine (C) residue present.\n\n<<<1>>>"
