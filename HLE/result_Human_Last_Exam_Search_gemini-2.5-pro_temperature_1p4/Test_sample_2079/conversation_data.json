    "I have been unable to identify the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461 from the available online resources.\n\nWhile extensive research into the history of Bardejov during the 15th century confirms this was a period of significant prosperity for the town, a definitive list of judges (richtári) for that specific year has not been located.\n\nKey findings from the investigation include:\n*   A publication by historian Stanisław Andrzej Sroka, \"Bardejov v XV. storočí. Štúdie z dejín mesta\" (\"Bardejov in the 15th Century: Studies from the History of the Town\"), contains a chapter titled \"Bardejovskí richtári v XV. storočí\" (\"The Judges of Bardejov in the 15th Century\"). This book is the most probable source for the answer, but its contents are not available online.\n*   Historical records confirm that between the years 1461 and 1470, a limited number of individuals, specifically 35 burghers, served on the town council, and only ten men held the position of judge throughout the latter half of the 15th century. This suggests the name of the judge for 1461 is likely recorded in the town's historical archives.\n*   A reference to a judge named Leonard Haida was found, associated with a burgher's sign, but the specific year of his service is not mentioned.\n*   A document from 1461 mentions a dispute that occurred during a market in Bardejov, which led to the town council of Nowy Sącz writing to the Bardejov town council. However, the name of the Bardejov judge is not stated in the available summary of this document.\n\nDespite these leads, a conclusive identification of the judge of Bártfa in 1461 cannot be made without accessing more detailed archival records or the specific chapter in the aforementioned book by Stanisław Andrzej Sroka.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to who the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) was in 1461.>>>"
