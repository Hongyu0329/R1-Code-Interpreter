    "Let $n = 12345$ be the number of vertices in the graph $G$. The question asks for the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of $G$, given that $G$ is not a complete graph. This is equivalent to finding the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices that is not the complete graph $K_n$.\n\n### Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number\n\nThe chromatic number of any graph with $n$ vertices is at most $n$, since one can always assign a unique color to each vertex.\n\nA key theorem in graph theory states that for a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number $\\chi(G) = n$ if and only if $G$ is a complete graph ($G=K_n$). This is because if $\\chi(G)=n$, it means that $n$ colors are necessary, and no two vertices can share a color. In a proper coloring, any two adjacent vertices must have different colors. If there were any pair of non-adjacent vertices, say $u$ and $v$, they could be assigned the same color. All other $n-2$ vertices could be assigned their own unique colors, leading to a valid coloring with at most $1 + (n-2) = n-1$ colors. This would contradict the fact that $\\chi(G)=n$. Therefore, there must be no non-adjacent vertices, which means the graph is complete. Conversely, in a complete graph $K_n$, all vertices are mutually adjacent, so all $n$ vertices require a distinct color.\n\nThe problem specifies that the graph $G$ is not the complete graph ($G \\neq K_n$). Based on the theorem above, this implies that its chromatic number cannot be $n$. Since the chromatic number must be an integer, the maximum possible value is one less than $n$:\n$\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n\nFor $n=12345$, this means the chromatic number is at most $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n### Achieving the Upper Bound\n\nTo show that $12344$ is the maximum possible number of colors, we need to demonstrate the existence of a graph with 12345 vertices that is not complete and has a chromatic number of 12344.\n\nConsider the following graph, $G^*$:\nLet $G^*$ be the graph formed by the disjoint union of a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices, $K_{n-1}$, and a single isolated vertex, $K_1$.\nThe total number of vertices in $G^*$ is $(n-1) + 1 = n = 12345$.\nThis graph is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertex in the graph.\n\nNow, let's determine the chromatic number of $G^*$:\n1.  The subgraph $K_{n-1}$ (which is $K_{12344}$) is a clique of size $n-1$. All vertices in a clique must be colored with a different color. Therefore, we need at least $n-1$ colors for this part of the graph.\n2.  The remaining vertex is isolated and not adjacent to any other vertex. It can be colored with any of the colors already used for the $K_{n-1}$ subgraph without violating the coloring rules.\n3.  Thus, the minimum number of colors required to properly color $G^*$ is $n-1$.\n\nSo, for $n=12345$, the chromatic number of this graph $G^*$ is $\\chi(G^*) = 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nSince we have shown that the chromatic number for any non-complete graph with $n$ vertices cannot exceed $n-1$, and we have constructed a specific non-complete graph that achieves this value, the maximum number of colors is $n-1$.\n\nThe mention of the maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ in the problem description does not alter the result, as no specific constraints were placed on it. For the example graph $G^*=K_{12344} \\cup K_1$, the maximum degree is $\\Delta(G^*) = 12343$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
