    "In Major League Baseball (MLB), there have been 17 different players who have won the batting Triple Crown. This prestigious achievement requires a player to lead their respective league—American League (AL) or National League (NL)—in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in the same season.\n\nThe most recent player to win the Triple Crown was Miguel Cabrera in 2012 while playing for the Detroit Tigers in the American League. Before Cabrera, there was a 45-year gap since Carl Yastrzemski of the Boston Red Sox accomplished the feat in 1967.\n\nTwo players have won the batting Triple Crown twice:\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (St. Louis Cardinals - NL): 1922 and 1925.\n*   **Ted Williams** (Boston Red Sox - AL): 1942 and 1947.\n\nThe first player to win the Triple Crown was Paul Hines of the Providence Grays in 1878.\n\nHere is a list of all the MLB Triple Crown winners:\n*   Miguel Cabrera (2012)\n*   Carl Yastrzemski (1967)\n*   Frank Robinson (1966)\n*   Mickey Mantle (1956)\n*   Ted Williams (1947)\n*   Ted Williams (1942)\n*   Joe Medwick (1937)\n*   Lou Gehrig (1934)\n*   Jimmie Foxx (1933)\n*   Chuck Klein (1933)\n*   Rogers Hornsby (1925)\n*   Rogers Hornsby (1922)\n*   Heinie Zimmerman (1912)\n*   Ty Cobb (1909)\n*   Nap Lajoie (1901)\n*   Hugh Duffy (1894)\n*   Tip O'Neill (1887)\n*   Paul Hines (1878)\n\nIt is also worth noting that with the official recognition of Negro Leagues statistics by MLB in 2024, several other players are now credited with winning the Triple Crown in their respective leagues. This adds players like Oscar Charleston, Josh Gibson, and others to the overall list of Triple Crown winners in professional baseball history. Including the Negro Leagues, there have been a total of 28 Triple Crown winners. There is also a pitching Triple Crown, which has been achieved 35 times in MLB history.\n\n<<<17>>>"
