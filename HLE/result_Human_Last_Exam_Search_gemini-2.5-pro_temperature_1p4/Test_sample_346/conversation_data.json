    "To determine the value of `log_2(n)`, we must first find the integer `n` represented by the given SKI combinator expression. The process involves analyzing the structure of the expression and understanding the function of its constituent combinators.\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Expression**\n\nThe given expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nLet's identify the key combinators and recurring structures:\n*   **`S`**: `Sxyz = xz(yz)`\n*   **`K`**: `Kxy = x`\n*   **`I`**: `Ix = x`\n*   **`B = S(S(K(S))(K))`**: This is the composition combinator, `Bfgx = f(g(x))`.\n*   **`M = S(I)(I)`**: This is the self-application combinator, also known as the mockingbird, `Mf = ff`.\n\nBy substituting these known combinators, we can simplify the expression's components:\n*   `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` becomes `B(I)`. Since `B(I)f x = I(f x) = f x`, `B(I)` is equivalent to `I`.\n*   `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))` becomes `B(M)`.\n\nNow, the expression can be rewritten as:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(I))))(B(M)))`\n\n**2. Identifying the Core Functions**\n\nThe expression has two main functional parts:\n*   **`double = B(M)`**: Let's analyze what this combinator does to a Church numeral `n`. A Church numeral `n` is a function that applies another function `f`, `n` times to an argument `x`. So, `n f x = f^n(x)`.\n    Applying `double` to `n`:\n    `(double n) f x = (B(M) n) f x = M(n f) x = (n f)(n f) x`\n    This means we apply the function `(n f)` to the argument `x`, which yields `f^n(x)`. Then we apply `(n f)` again to that result: `(n f)(f^n(x)) = f^n(f^n(x)) = f^(2n)(x)`.\n    Thus, `B(M)` is a combinator that doubles a Church numeral: `B(M) n = 2n`.\n\n*   **`T = S(I)`**: This is the Thrush combinator. Its behavior is `Tyz = S(I)yz = I z (y z) = z(y z)`. It applies its second argument to the result of its first argument applied to the second.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Expression**\n\nWith these definitions, the expression for `n` becomes:\n`n = T(T(T(K(I))))(double)`\n\nLet's evaluate this from the inside out:\n1.  The innermost part is `K(I)`. When `K(I)` is applied to any argument, like `double`, it returns `I`. `(K I) double = I`.\n2.  The next layer is `T(K(I))`. Applying this to `double` yields:\n    `T(K(I)) double = double ((K I) double) = double(I)`.\n3.  The next layer is `T(T(K(I)))`. Applying this to `double`:\n    `T(T(K(I))) double = double ((T(K(I))) double) = double(double(I))`.\n4.  The final expression is `n = T(T(T(K(I)))) double`:\n    `n = double ((T(T(T(K(I))))) double) = double(double(double(I)))`.\n\n**4. Calculating the Value of n**\n\nIn SKI combinator calculus, the Church numeral for one, `1`, is represented by the identity combinator `I`. Therefore, we can substitute `1` for `I` in our expression for `n`:\n\n*   `n = double(double(double(1)))`\n*   `double(1) = 2 * 1 = 2`\n*   `double(2) = 2 * 2 = 4`\n*   `double(4) = 2 * 4 = 8`\n\nSo, the Church integer `n` is 8.\n\n**5. Finding the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the value of `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(8) = 3`\n\n<<<3>>>"
