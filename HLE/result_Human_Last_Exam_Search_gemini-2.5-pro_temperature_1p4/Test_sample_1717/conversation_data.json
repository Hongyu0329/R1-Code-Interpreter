    "Based on the source code of *Terraria*, the health of bosses in Expert Mode scales with the number of players in the game. For the Eye of Cthulhu, the base health in Expert Mode with one player is 3,640.\n\nIn multiplayer, each additional player increases the boss's maximum health. The formula for this scaling is not a simple linear addition but a cumulative increase. According to analysis of the game's code by the community, for each player added, a successively larger amount of health is added to the total. While the rate of increase per player diminishes slightly as more players are added, it remains a positive value.\n\nSince every additional player contributes a positive value to the Eye of Cthulhu's total health, and there is no documented hard cap on the health scaling in the game's code, the health will continue to increase indefinitely as more players join.\n\nTherefore, with a theoretical infinite number of players, the Eye of Cthulhu's health would also approach infinity.\n\n<<<Infinity>>>"
