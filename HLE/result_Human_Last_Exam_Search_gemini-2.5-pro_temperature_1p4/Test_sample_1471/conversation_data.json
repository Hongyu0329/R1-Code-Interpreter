    "To solve the equation, we first need to convert the Roman numerals to modern Arabic numbers.\n\n*   **IV** is 4.\n*   **XXX** is 30.\n*   **MMMDCCCLXXXVIII** is 3888.\n\nThe notation \"IV/XXX\" is a modern representation of a fraction using Roman numerals; it is not a format the ancient Romans would have used. In this context, the slash represents division.\n\nTherefore, the equation in modern numbers is:\n4 / 30 - 3888\n\nNow, we can solve this:\n1.  **Divide 4 by 30:**\n    4 ÷ 30 = 0.1333... (a repeating decimal)\n\n2.  **Subtract 3888 from the result:**\n    0.1333... - 3888 = -3887.8666...\n\nThe repeating decimal can be expressed as the fraction 2/15. So, the final answer is -3887 and 13/15.\n\n<<<-3887.8666666667>>>"
