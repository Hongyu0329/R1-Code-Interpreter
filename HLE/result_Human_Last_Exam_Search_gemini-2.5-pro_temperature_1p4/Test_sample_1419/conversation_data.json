    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, the renormalization group (RG) flow of the coupling constant, denoted by u, is described by the beta function, β(u). The dimension is expressed as d = 4 - ϵ, where ϵ is a small positive parameter. The non-trivial fixed point, u*, also known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, is found by setting the beta function to zero, β(u*) = 0, for a non-zero coupling.\n\nTo the leading order in the coupling u, the one-loop beta function in the minimal subtraction (MS) scheme for a single-component scalar field (N=1) is given by:\nβ(u) = -ϵu + (3u²)/(16π²)\n\nBy setting β(u*) = 0 to find the fixed point, we have:\n-ϵu* + (3(u*)²)/(16π²) = 0\n\nFor the non-trivial solution (u* ≠ 0), we can divide by u*:\nϵ = 3u*/(16π²)\n\nSolving for u*, we obtain the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in terms of ϵ:\nu* = (16π²/3)ϵ\n\nThis result shows that the fixed point coupling is of order ϵ. The existence of this fixed point is crucial for understanding the critical behavior of systems described by ϕ⁴ theory, such as the liquid-gas phase transition and the Ising model of ferromagnetism near their critical points.\n\n<<<u* = (16π²/3)ϵ>>>"
