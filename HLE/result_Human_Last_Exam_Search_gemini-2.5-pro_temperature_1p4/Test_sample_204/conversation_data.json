    "### Hopf Charge of the Vector Field is 1\n\nThe Hopf charge, a topological invariant of a three-dimensional vector field, is determined to be 1 for the specified field configuration. This conclusion is based on the fundamental definition of the Hopf invariant as a linking number of preimages.\n\nThe given vector field, denoted by **n** = (nx, ny, nz), maps points in 3D space (x, y, z) to points on the surface of a unit sphere (S²). The Hopf charge quantifies the topological complexity of this mapping. It can be understood as the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct points on the sphere. A preimage is the set of all points in the 3D space that map to the same single point on the sphere.\n\nFor the given field:\n*   **n** = (sin(G)cos(f), sin(G)sin(f), cos(G))\n*   f = atan2(y, x)\n*   G = π * exp(-10 * r2)\n*   r2 = sqrt((x² + y² - 0.5)² + z²)\n\nTo determine the Hopf charge, we can identify the preimages of two convenient points on the sphere: the \"South Pole\" and a point on the \"equator.\"\n\n1.  **Preimage of the South Pole:** The South Pole of the sphere corresponds to **n** = (0, 0, -1). This occurs when the angle G is equal to π. According to the definition of G, this implies that `r2` must be 0. This condition is met for all points on a circle in the (x, y) plane defined by x² + y² = 0.5 and z = 0. This circle is the preimage of the South Pole.\n\n2.  **Preimage of an equatorial point:** A point on the sphere's equator, for instance **n** = (1, 0, 0), corresponds to G = π/2 and f = 0. The condition G = π/2 leads to `r2 = ln(2)/10`. The condition f = 0 (where f = atan2(y,x)) means y=0 and x>0. Combined, these conditions define a closed loop in the (x, z) plane that encircles the point on the x-axis where x = sqrt(0.5).\n\nThe Hopf charge is the linking number of these two preimages. The first preimage is a circle in the (x, y)-plane centered at the origin. The second is a loop in the (x, z)-plane. Crucially, the loop in the (x, z)-plane encircles a point that lies on the circle in the (x, y)-plane. This geometric arrangement, where one closed loop passes through the interior of another, is the definition of a single link.\n\nTherefore, the linking number of these two preimages is 1. Since the Hopf charge is equivalent to this linking number, the Hopf charge of the given vector field is 1. This method aligns with the fundamental interpretation of the Hopf invariant as described by the Whitehead formula. While the formula can also be expressed as a volume integral, its direct calculation can be complicated by singularities in the potential field, making the linking number approach more direct in this case.\n\n<<<1>>>"
