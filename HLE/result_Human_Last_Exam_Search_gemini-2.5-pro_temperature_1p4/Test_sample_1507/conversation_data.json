    "The user is asking for the number of visible triangles on the outer-hull of a great icosahedron.\n\nFrom the search results, I know the following:\n- The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron.\n- The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n- A regular icosahedron has 20 faces, and these faces are equilateral triangles.\n\nTherefore, the \"outer-hull\" of the great icosahedron is its convex hull, which is a regular icosahedron. The \"visible triangles from the outside\" are the faces of this convex hull.\n\nSince the convex hull is a regular icosahedron, it has 20 triangular faces. These faces are the \"visible triangles from the outside\".\n\nThe minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating this outer-hull is simply the number of faces of the hull itself, as the faces are already triangles. Therefore, no further triangulation is needed.\n\nThe answer is 20.I have determined that the outer hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. I have also found that a regular icosahedron has 20 triangular faces. This directly answers the user's question about the number of visible triangles from the outside. Therefore, I have sufficient information to answer the user's request.\n\nThe minimal number of triangles needed for the triangulation of the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20. The outer hull of the great icosahedron is its convex hull, which is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 faces, all of which are equilateral triangles.\n\nThe great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron, meaning its faces intersect each other. To determine the number of visible triangles from the outside, one must consider its convex hull. The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\nA regular icosahedron, one of the five Platonic solids, is defined as a polyhedron having 20 faces. Each of these faces is an equilateral triangle. Consequently, the \"outer-hull\" of the great icosahedron already consists of 20 triangles, and no further triangulation is required. The number of visible triangles from the outside is therefore 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
