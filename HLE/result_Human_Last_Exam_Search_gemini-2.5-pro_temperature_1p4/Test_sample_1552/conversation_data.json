    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a given differential operator is commonly denoted as $a_2$. For the operator that is the square of a massless gauged Dirac operator, $D^2$, on a 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold, this coefficient is a local geometric invariant. The spectral action is given by the trace of a function of the operator $D^2$, and its asymptotic expansion for large cutoff parameter $\\Lambda$ is given in terms of the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients.\n\nThe operator $D^2$ can be expressed using the generalized Lichnerowicz formula. For a Dirac operator $D = \\gamma^\\mu (\\partial_\\mu + \\omega_\\mu + A_\\mu)$ acting on spinors coupled to a gauge field with potential $A_\\mu$ and field strength $F_{\\mu\\nu}$, the squared operator is a generalized Laplacian. Here, $\\gamma^\\mu$ are the Dirac matrices and $\\omega_\\mu$ is the spin connection. The Lichnerowicz formula states:\n\n$D^2 = -g^{\\mu\\nu}\\nabla_\\mu\\nabla_\\nu - E$\n\nwhere $\\nabla_\\mu$ is the full covariant derivative (including spin and gauge connections), and $E$ is an endomorphism given by:\n\n$E = -\\frac{1}{4}R - \\frac{1}{2} F_{\\mu\\nu}\\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu$\n\nHere, $R$ is the scalar curvature of the manifold.\n\nThe second heat kernel coefficient, $a_2$, for a general second-order differential operator of the form $-\\nabla^2 - E$ on a 4-dimensional manifold without boundary is given by the integral of a local density. The density, traced over the fiber space (in this case, the spinor bundle), is:\n\n$\\text{tr}(\\hat{a}_2) = \\text{tr} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}E^2 + \\frac{1}{6}RE + \\frac{1}{12}\\Omega_{\\mu\\nu}\\Omega^{\\mu\\nu} + \\text{gravitational terms} \\right]$\n\nwhere $\\Omega_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the curvature of the full connection on the spinor bundle twisted by the gauge bundle. The gravitational terms depend only on the curvature of the manifold and are independent of the gauge field.\n\nFor a massless Dirac spinor field, we are interested in the part of the coefficient that depends on the gauge field strength $F_{\\mu\\nu}$. This arises from the terms involving $E$ and $\\Omega_{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\n1.  **Term from $\\frac{1}{2}E^2$:**\n    The square of the endomorphism $E$ contains a term with the gauge field: $\\frac{1}{4} F_{\\mu\\nu}F_{\\rho\\sigma}\\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu\\gamma^\\rho\\gamma^\\sigma$. Taking the trace over the 4-dimensional spinor space yields $-F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. Thus, the contribution to $\\text{tr}(\\hat{a}_2)$ is $-\\frac{1}{2} F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\n2.  **Term from $\\frac{1}{12}\\Omega_{\\mu\\nu}\\Omega^{\\mu\\nu}$:**\n    The total curvature is $\\Omega_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Omega^S_{\\mu\\nu} + F_{\\mu\\nu}$, where $\\Omega^S_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the spin curvature. The relevant term for the gauge field is the square of the field strength, $F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. Its trace over the spinor space is $\\text{tr}(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}) = 4 F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. The contribution to $\\text{tr}(\\hat{a}_2)$ is therefore $\\frac{1}{12} \\times 4 F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{3} F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\nCombining these two contributions gives the total coefficient for the gauge field part:\n$-\\frac{1}{2} F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu} + \\frac{1}{3} F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu} = -\\frac{1}{6} F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\nThe full second coefficient density, including the gravitational part, after taking the trace over the spinor indices is:\n$a_2(x) = -\\frac{1}{30} R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} + \\frac{1}{30} R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{12} R^2 - \\frac{1}{6} \\text{Tr}(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu})$.\n\nThe question asks for the coefficient itself, which is this entire expression. However, often in the context of the spectral action, the Yang-Mills part is the primary interest besides the Einstein-Hilbert term. The Yang-Mills action arises from the term proportional to the trace of the square of the field strength tensor.\n\nThe second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion for the spectral action of a massless gauged Dirac spinor field includes terms dependent on the curvature of spacetime and terms dependent on the gauge field strength. The part of the coefficient density that gives rise to the Yang-Mills action is $-\\frac{1}{6} \\text{Tr}(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu})$.\n\n"
