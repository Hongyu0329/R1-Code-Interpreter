    "To find the probability that a particle in a one-dimensional box is located in a specific interval, we need to integrate the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over that interval.\n\nThe normalized wave function for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' is given by:\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\nThe probability density function is:\nP(x) = |ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)\n\nThe problem asks for the probability in the interval from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a for the quantum state n = 2.\n\n**1. Set up the integral:**\nThe probability (P) is the integral of the probability density function over the given interval:\nP = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\n**2. Simplify the integral:**\nWe can use the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2.\nLet θ = 2πx/a. Then 2θ = 4πx/a.\nP = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * [ (1 - cos(4πx/a)) / 2 ] dx\nP = (1/a) ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx\n\n**3. Solve the integral:**\nP = (1/a) * [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a\nP = (1/a) * [ (0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)) - (0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a)) ]\nP = (1/a) * [ (0.505a - 0.495a) - (a/4π) * (sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)) ]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * (sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π))\n\n**4. Calculate the numerical value:**\nUsing the identity sin(A) - sin(B) = 2cos((A+B)/2)sin((A-B)/2):\nA = 2.02π and B = 1.98π\n(A+B)/2 = 2π\n(A-B)/2 = 0.02π\nSo, sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π) = 2 * cos(2π) * sin(0.02π) = 2 * 1 * sin(0.02π) = 2sin(0.02π).\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for P:\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * (2sin(0.02π))\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π) * sin(0.02π)\n\nNow, we calculate the value:\nsin(0.02π) ≈ sin(0.06283) ≈ 0.06279\nP ≈ 0.01 - (1 / (2 * 3.14159)) * 0.06279\nP ≈ 0.01 - (0.15915) * (0.06279)\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.009993\nP ≈ 0.0000066\n\nThe probability is very small because the interval [0.495a, 0.505a] is centered around x = 0.5a, which is a node for the n=2 state (i.e., the wavefunction is zero at this point).\n\n<<<0.0000066>>>"
