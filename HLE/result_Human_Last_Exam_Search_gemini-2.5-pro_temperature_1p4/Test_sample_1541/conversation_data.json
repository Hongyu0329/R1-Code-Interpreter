    "To solve this problem with the highest memory efficiency, we need to avoid storing the entire input string. The best approach is to read the input character by character, count the occurrences of each number (1, 2, 3, and 4), and then print the result based on these counts. This method is a form of Counting Sort.\n\nHere is a C program designed for minimal memory usage:\n*   It reads the input using `getchar()` in a loop, which avoids allocating a large buffer for the string.\n*   It uses the smallest possible standard data types for variables. The counters for numbers only need to go up to a maximum of 501 (for a 1000-character string like \"1+1+...+1\"), so an `unsigned short` (typically 2 bytes, max value 65,535) is sufficient. A flag can be stored in a `char` (1 byte).\n*   The variable used for reading input with `getchar()` must be an `int` to handle the special `EOF` (End-of-File) value correctly. This same integer variable is then reused as a loop counter for printing, saving memory by not declaring a separate loop variable.\n\n### Most Memory-Efficient C Program\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/**\n * This program solves the Xenia and Sum problem with maximum memory efficiency.\n *\n * Approach:\n * 1. Read the input character by character using getchar() to avoid storing the string.\n * 2. Use four counters for the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n * 3. Use the smallest appropriate data types: `unsigned short` for counters since the\n *    number of terms is at most 501, and `char` for a simple flag.\n * 4. The variable for getchar() must be `int` to handle EOF. This variable is\n *    reused later as a loop counter to save memory.\n * 5. Print the numbers from the counters in non-decreasing order, adding '+'\n *    between them using a flag.\n */\nint main(void) {\n    // Four counters for numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. `unsigned short` is used\n    // as it's smaller than `int` and large enough to hold the counts.\n    unsigned short count1 = 0, count2 = 0, count3 = 0, count4 = 0;\n\n    // A single variable used for both reading input and as a loop counter later.\n    // It must be an `int` to correctly handle the `EOF` value from `getchar()`.\n    int c_and_loop;\n\n    // Read input and count the numbers\n    while ((c_and_loop = getchar()) != '\\n' && c_and_loop != EOF) {\n        switch (c_and_loop) {\n            case '1': count1++; break;\n            case '2': count2++; break;\n            case '3': count3++; break;\n            case '4': count4++; break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // A flag to handle the '+' separator. A `char` is the smallest type for a flag.\n    char is_first_term = 1;\n\n    // Print the sorted sum, reusing `c_and_loop` as the loop counter.\n    for (c_and_loop = 0; c_and_loop < count1; c_and_loop++) {\n        if (!is_first_term) {\n            putchar('+');\n        }\n        putchar('1');\n        is_first_term = 0;\n    }\n\n    for (c_and_loop = 0; c_and_loop < count2; c_and_loop++) {\n        if (!is_first_term) {\n            putchar('+');\n        }\n        putchar('2');\n        is_first_term = 0;\n    }\n\n    for (c_and_loop = 0; c_and_loop < count3; c_and_loop++) {\n        if (!is_first_term) {\n            putchar('+');\n        }\n        putchar('3');\n        is_first_term = 0;\n    }\n\n    for (c_and_loop = 0; c_and_loop < count4; c_and_loop++) {\n        if (!is_first_term) {\n            putchar('+');\n        }\n        putchar('4');\n        is_first_term = 0;\n    }\n    \n    putchar('\\n');\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Calculation (m)\n\nThe total memory used for variables (`m`) is the sum of the sizes of all local variables declared in the `main` function. The calculation assumes a standard C environment, common in competitive programming platforms (e.g., GCC on a 64-bit system), where:\n*   `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte\n*   `sizeof(unsigned short)` = 2 bytes\n*   `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes\n\nThe variables used are:\n1.  `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, `count4`: Four variables of type `unsigned short`.\n    *   Memory = 4 * `sizeof(unsigned short)` = 4 * 2 = 8 bytes.\n2.  `c_and_loop`: One variable of type `int`.\n    *   Memory = 1 * `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n3.  `is_first_term`: One variable of type `char`.\n    *   Memory = 1 * `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n\nTotal memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by these variables:\nm = 8 bytes (counters) + 4 bytes (input/loop variable) + 1 byte (flag) = 13 bytes.\n\n<<<13>>>"
