    "In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix representation, the matrix is recursively partitioned according to a hierarchical tree structure. The matrix multiplication algorithm for two HSS matrices, say A and B, involves operating on the submatrices associated with each node in their respective HSS trees.\n\nAn HSS tree with a depth of 4 has 5 levels (from level 0, the root, to level 4, the leaves). For a full binary tree, the number of nodes at each level `k` is 2^k. Therefore, the total number of nodes is:\n\n1 (level 0) + 2 (level 1) + 4 (level 2) + 8 (level 3) + 16 (level 4) = 31 nodes.\n\nThese nodes correspond to the blocks in the hierarchical partitioning of the matrix. Each node in the HSS tree has associated generator matrices (submatrices) that define the structure of the corresponding matrix block. The HSS matrix multiplication algorithm proceeds by traversing the tree and computing the generators for the resulting matrix, C = A * B, at each node. This computation requires accessing the generator submatrices from the corresponding nodes of both matrix A and matrix B.\n\nConsequently, for each of the 31 nodes in the tree structure, the algorithm accesses the generator submatrices for both input matrices. Therefore, the total number of submatrix blocks accessed during the multiplication is the sum of the nodes in both trees.\n\nNumber of submatrices from A = 31\nNumber of submatrices from B = 31\n\nTotal submatrices accessed = 31 (from A) + 31 (from B) = 62.\n\n<<<62>>>"
