    "The reasoning laid out in the scratchpad is sound and supported by the search results. Here is a summary of the key points and their verification:\n\n1.  **The Question:** We are looking for the number of elements in the reflection group H3 that possess a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n2.  **Regular Eigenvector -> Regular Element:** An element of a reflection group is defined as \"regular\" if it has a regular eigenvector. A regular eigenvector is one that does not lie in any of the reflecting hyperplanes. Therefore, the question asks for the number of regular elements that have an eigenvalue of order 10.\n3.  **Regular Element <-> Conjugate to a Coxeter Element:** A crucial theorem by T.A. Springer states that an element of a finite reflection group is regular if and only if it is conjugate to a Coxeter element.\n4.  **H3 Group Properties:** The reflection group of type H3 has order 120. Its Coxeter number, *h*, is 10. The exponents of H3 are 1, 5, and 9.\n5.  **Eigenvalues of a Coxeter Element:** The eigenvalues of a Coxeter element are given by the formula e^(2πi * m_j / h), where *m_j* are the exponents and *h* is the Coxeter number. For H3, this gives:\n    *   e^(2πi * 1 / 10)\n    *   e^(2πi * 5 / 10) = e^(πi) = -1\n    *   e^(2πi * 9 / 10)\n    The orders of these eigenvalues are 10, 2, and 10, respectively. Thus, any Coxeter element (and any element conjugate to it) has two eigenvalues of order 10.\n6.  **Eigenvectors of Regular Elements:** Springer's theorem also states that for any regular element, the eigenspace corresponding to *any* of its eigenvalues contains a regular eigenvector.\n7.  **Equivalence:** Combining these points, an element *g* in H3 has a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10 if and only if *g* is a regular element. The problem is thus reduced to finding the total number of regular elements in H3.\n8.  **Number of Regular Elements:** The set of all regular elements is the union of the conjugacy classes of Coxeter elements. For an irreducible finite Coxeter group, all Coxeter elements are conjugate. H3 is irreducible. Therefore, the set of regular elements forms a single conjugacy class.\n9.  **Size of the Conjugacy Class:** The size of the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element *c* is given by |W| / |C(c)|, where |W| is the order of the group and C(c) is the centralizer of *c*. For an irreducible finite Coxeter group, the centralizer of a Coxeter element *c* is the cyclic group generated by *c*, which has order *h*.\n10. **Final Calculation:** For H3, |W| = 120 and h = 10. The number of regular elements is therefore 120 / 10 = 12.\n\nEach of these 12 elements is conjugate to a Coxeter element. As such, each has eigenvalues of order 10, and for each of those eigenvalues, the corresponding eigenspace contains a regular vector. Thus, all 12 of these elements satisfy the required conditions.\n\n<<<12>>>"
