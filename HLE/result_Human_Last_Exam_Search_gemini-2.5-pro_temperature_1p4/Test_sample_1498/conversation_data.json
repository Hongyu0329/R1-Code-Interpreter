    "In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, the names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned from the following bayt (verse):\n\n**تفصيل خمسة وعشرين لزم * كل مكلف فحقق واغتنم**\n\nThis verse translates to: \"The details of twenty-five (prophets) are necessary, for every accountable person, so verify and take advantage.\"\n\nThe enumeration of the prophets' names begins in the subsequent verses and concludes with the bayt:\n\n**الياس يونس زكريا يحيى * عيسى وطه خاتم دعه غيا**\n\nThis verse lists the final prophets mentioned in this section of the poem: Elias, Jonah, Zechariah, John, Jesus, and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad), the seal of the prophets. The following verse then sends peace and blessings upon all of them.\n\nTherefore, the mention of the names of the prophets starts from the verse that introduces the number of prophets whose names are obligatory to know and ends with the verse that completes the list of these twenty-five prophets.\n\n<<<From the bayt starting with 'تفصيل خمسة وعشرين لزم' to the bayt ending with 'عيسى وطه خاتم دعه غيا'.>>>"
