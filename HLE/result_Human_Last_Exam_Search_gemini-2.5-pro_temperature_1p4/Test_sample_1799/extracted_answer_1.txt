It is not true that the second postulate of special relativity is superfluous and can be deduced from the first without additional, significant assumptions. The first postulate, on its own, is also compatible with Galilean relativity where the speed of light is not constant for all observers. Derivations that claim to deduce the second postulate from the first often rely on implicit assumptions that are equivalent to the second postulate, such as the universal validity of Maxwell's equations in all inertial frames. Therefore, the second postulate is generally considered a necessary and independent component of the theory of special relativity.
