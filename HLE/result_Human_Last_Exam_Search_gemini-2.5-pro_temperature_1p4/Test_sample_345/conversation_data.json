    "The Staatliche Museen zu Berlin acquired the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" (Der Radionist) by Kurt Günther in 1967. The museum purchased the artwork from the artist's widow, Maria Günther, who was in Gera.\n\n\"The Radionist,\" also known as \"Kleinbürger am Radio\" (Petty Bourgeois at the Radio), was painted in 1927 and is a notable example of the New Objectivity movement. The painting depicts a man, identified as a certain Mr. Schreck who was a paraplegic and lived in the same building as Günther, listening to the radio. The radio, a relatively new medium at the time, became a significant motif in the art of the New Objectivity, representing a new form of leisure and information dissemination.\n\nThe artwork is part of the collection of the Nationalgalerie, which is one of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin. In the same year, the museum also acquired another painting by Günther from his widow, titled \"Knabenbildnis\" (Portrait of a Boy), from 1928.\n\n<<<Staatliche Museen zu Berlin>>>"
