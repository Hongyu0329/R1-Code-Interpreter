    "The first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" was the Contracts (General Part) Law. This law, enacted in 1973, marked a significant shift in Israeli jurisprudence, which had previously been more aligned with the English approach that prioritized freedom of contract.\n\nSection 12 of the Contracts (General Part) Law explicitly requires that parties to a negotiation for a contract must act in a customary manner and in good faith. Furthermore, Section 39 extends this duty to the fulfillment of obligations and the exercise of rights arising from a contract. The introduction of this principle is considered one of the most far-reaching innovations of the law. This duty of good faith applies not only to the performance of a contract but also to the pre-contractual negotiation stage. The concept was borrowed from continental legal systems, particularly German law, and was intended to apply broadly, even to legal acts other than contracts.\n\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
