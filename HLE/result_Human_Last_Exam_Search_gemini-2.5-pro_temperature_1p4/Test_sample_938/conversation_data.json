    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the asymptotic behavior of the sequence $s_n$ as $n \\to \\infty$. The limit $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n}$ depends on the exponential growth rate of $s_n$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the sequence $a_n$. It is defined by the linear recurrence relation $a_{n}=88a_{n-3}+57a_{n-4}$ for $n\\geq 4$. The behavior of $a_n$ for large $n$ is determined by the roots of its characteristic equation:\n$x^4 - 88x - 57 = 0$.\n\nLet the roots of this equation be $r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4$. The general solution for the recurrence is $a_n = c_1 r_1^n + c_2 r_2^n + c_3 r_3^n + c_4 r_4^n$ for some constants $c_i$ determined by the initial conditions. The asymptotic behavior of $a_n$ is dominated by the root(s) with the largest absolute value (modulus).\n\nWe can find the roots of the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 - 88x - 57$ numerically.\nThe roots are approximately $r_1 \\approx 4.65345$, $r_2 \\approx -0.64736$, and a complex conjugate pair $r_{3,4} \\approx -2.00304 \\pm 4.25882i$.\n\nLet's find the moduli of these roots:\n$|r_1| \\approx 4.65345$\n$|r_2| \\approx 0.64736$\n$|r_{3,4}| = \\sqrt{(-2.00304)^2 + (4.25882)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{4.01217 + 18.13754} = \\sqrt{22.14971} \\approx 4.70635$.\n\nThe dominant roots are the complex conjugate pair, as their modulus is the largest. Let's call this maximum modulus $R_{max} \\approx 4.70635$.\nFor large $n$, the behavior of $a_n$ is approximately $a_n \\approx c_3 r_3^n + c_4 r_4^n$.\nLet $r_3 = z = R_{max} e^{i\\theta}$ and $r_4 = \\bar{z} = R_{max} e^{-i\\theta}$.\nThen $a_n \\approx R_{max}^n (c_3 e^{in\\theta} + c_4 e^{-in\\theta})$. Since $a_n$ is real, the coefficients must be complex conjugates, $c_4 = \\bar{c_3}$.\nSo, $a_n \\approx 2 \\Re(c_3 e^{in\\theta}) = 2|c_3| R_{max}^n \\cos(n\\theta + \\phi)$ for some phase $\\phi$.\n\nNow, let's analyze $s_n$:\n$s_{n}=\\sum_{k=6}^{n}(a_{2k-3}+2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51})-\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1}(a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5})$\n\nWe need to find the dominant term in this expression for large $n$.\nThe growth rate of terms like $a_m$ is of order $R_{max}^m$.\n1.  The term $a_{2k-3}$ grows as $R_{max}^{2k-3}$. The sum $\\sum_{k=6}^n a_{2k-3}$ will grow as $R_{max}^{2n}$.\n2.  The terms $2a_{k+100}$ and $7a_{k+51}$ grow as $R_{max}^{k+100}$ and $R_{max}^{k+51}$. Their sums grow as $R_{max}^n$, which is much smaller than $R_{max}^{2n}$.\n3.  The terms in the second sum are products like $a_{i}a_{j}$, which grow as $R_{max}^{i+j}$. The largest sum of indices is for $a_{k+3}a_{k-4}$, where $(k+3)+(k-4)=2k-1$. The sum $\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1} a_{k+3}a_{k-4}$ grows as $R_{max}^{2(n-1)}=R_{max}^{2n-2}$.\n\nThe dominant part of $s_n$ is the sum $\\sum_{k=6}^n a_{2k-3}$. The other parts of the sum grow at a slower rate.\nSo, for large $n$, $s_n \\approx \\sum_{k=6}^n a_{2k-3}$.\n\nLet's examine the behavior of this sum:\n$s_n \\approx \\sum_{k=6}^n 2|c_3| R_{max}^{2k-3} \\cos((2k-3)\\theta + \\phi)$.\nThis sum can be written as:\n$s_n \\approx \\Re\\left( \\sum_{k=6}^n 2c_3 (r_3)^{2k-3} \\right) = \\Re\\left( 2c_3 r_3^{-3} \\sum_{k=6}^n (r_3^2)^k \\right)$.\nThis is a geometric series sum, which for large $n$ is dominated by the last term, so it's proportional to $(r_3^2)^n$.\n$s_n \\approx \\Re(K (r_3^2)^n)$ for some complex constant $K$.\nLet $r_3^2 = (R_{max}^2)e^{i2\\theta}$.\n$s_n \\approx \\Re(K (R_{max}^{2n}) e^{i2n\\theta}) = |K|R_{max}^{2n} \\cos(2n\\theta + \\psi)$ for some phase $\\psi$.\n\nThe term $\\cos(2n\\theta + \\psi)$ will oscillate between -1 and 1, as $2\\theta = 2 \\arg(r_3)$ is not a rational multiple of $2\\pi$. The argument of $r_3$ is $\\arctan(4.25882 / -2.00304) + \\pi \\approx 2.011$ radians, so $2\\theta \\approx 4.022$ radians. This is not a rational multiple of $\\pi$.\n\nBecause of the cosine factor, $s_n$ will take on positive and negative values for arbitrarily large values of $n$. The natural logarithm $\\ln(s_n)$ is only defined for $s_n > 0$. Since $s_n$ is not positive for all large $n$, the sequence $\\frac{\\ln(s_n)}{n}$ is not defined for all large $n$.\nTherefore, the limit does not exist.\n\nThe problem formulation, by allowing for the answer $(-1)$ if the limit does not exist, suggests that this is a plausible outcome. The presence of dominant complex roots leads to oscillatory behavior in $a_n$ and consequently in $s_n$, which prevents the logarithm from being well-defined for all large $n$.\n\nFinal Answer: The limit does not exist.\n\n<<< -1 >>>"
