    "To determine the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$, where $K$ is the splitting field of the polynomial $p(x) = x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6$, we must first find the Galois group of $p(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, denoted by $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nThe degrees of normal intermediate extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ correspond to the orders of the quotient groups of $G$, which are given by the formula $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|N|$, where $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ such that $\\{1\\} \\subsetneq N \\subsetneq G$.\n\nThe determination of the Galois group $G$ involves the following steps:\n1.  **Irreducibility of the polynomial**: The polynomial $p(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This can be established by methods such as testing for rational roots and attempting to find factors, which prove unsuccessful. A key indicator of its irreducibility is that for the integer value $x=1$, $p(1) = 5$, which is a prime number. While not a definitive proof, it suggests irreducibility. Assuming the polynomial is irreducible, its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$.\n\n2.  **Determining the Galois group using the discriminant and factorizations modulo primes**:\n    *   The discriminant of a polynomial determines whether its Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group. The discriminant of $p(x)$ is a very large number, $D = 33,020,610,931,533,621$. Since the discriminant is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_7$.\n    *   By Dedekind's theorem, the cycle structure of elements in the Galois group can be inferred from the factorization of the polynomial modulo primes that do not divide the discriminant.\n    *   Factoring $p(x)$ modulo 5 (a prime that does not divide the discriminant) yields a factorization into a linear factor and an irreducible factor of degree 6. This implies the existence of a permutation in $G$ with a cycle structure of (1, 6), which is a 6-cycle.\n    *   The factorization of $p(x)$ modulo 3 is $x^5(x^2+1)$. While one cannot directly apply Dedekind's theorem due to the repeated factors (as 3 divides the discriminant), a more general version of the theorem suggests there is an element in the Galois group with a cycle structure related to this factorization, such as a permutation consisting of a 5-cycle and a 2-cycle. The third power of such an element would be a transposition (a 2-cycle).\n    *   A transitive subgroup of $S_7$ that contains a 6-cycle and a transposition must be the full symmetric group $S_7$. Therefore, the Galois group of the polynomial is $G = S_7$.\n\n3.  **Finding the possible degrees of normal extensions**:\n    *   The normal subgroups of $S_n$ for $n \\ge 5$ are well-known to be the trivial group $\\{1\\}$, the alternating group $A_n$, and the entire group $S_n$.\n    *   For our case, $G = S_7$, the proper, non-trivial normal subgroups are limited to just $A_7$.\n    *   According to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, each normal subgroup of $G$ corresponds to a normal intermediate field extension. We are looking for extensions $L$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$, which correspond to normal subgroups $N$ where $G \\supsetneq N \\supsetneq \\{1\\}$.\n    *   The only such normal subgroup is $N = A_7$.\n    *   The degree of the corresponding normal extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the index of the subgroup $A_7$ in $S_7$, which is $[S_7 : A_7] = |S_7| / |A_7| = (7!) / (7!/2) = 2$.\n\nThus, there is only one possible degree for a normal field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ strictly between $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K$.\n\n<<<2>>>"
