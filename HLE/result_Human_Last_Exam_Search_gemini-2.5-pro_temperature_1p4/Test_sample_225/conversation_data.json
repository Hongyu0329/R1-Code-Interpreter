    "The provided curve is a Lissajous curve with parametric equations:\nx(t) = cos(9t)\ny(t) = sin(5t)\n\nThis can be rewritten using only sines by using the phase shift identity cos(θ) = sin(θ + π/2).\nx(t) = sin(9t + π/2)\ny(t) = sin(5t)\n\nHere, the frequencies are a = 9 and b = 5. A self-intersection point is a point on the curve that is visited for two or more different values of the parameter t. For Lissajous curves where the frequencies `a` and `b` are integers and coprime (which 9 and 5 are), there are established formulas for the number of self-intersection points.\n\nThe general form of a Lissajous curve is often given as:\nx(t) = A sin(at + δ)\ny(t) = B sin(bt)\n\nIn our case, A=1, B=1, a=9, b=5, and the phase shift δ = π/2.\n\nFor a generic Lissajous curve with coprime integer frequencies `a` and `b`, the number of self-intersection points is `((a-1)(b-1))/2`. This formula applies when there are no extra degeneracies, which is the case for a phase shift of π/2.\n\nPlugging in the values a = 9 and b = 5:\nNumber of self-intersections = ((9 - 1)(5 - 1)) / 2\n= (8 * 4) / 2\n= 32 / 2\n= 16\n\nThus, there are 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
