    "To represent the number 13/16 in Red-Blue Hackenbush, we first need to express it in binary form. The number 13/16 is equivalent to the decimal 0.8125.\n\nThe binary representation of 13/16 is 0.1101, which can be expanded as:\n(1 * 1/2) + (1 * 1/4) + (0 * 1/8) + (1 * 1/16)\n\nIn Red-Blue Hackenbush, dyadic rational numbers (fractions with a power of 2 in the denominator) are represented by a \"stalk\" of colored edges. For a number between 0 and 1, the construction follows its binary representation from the decimal point onwards:\n*   A \"1\" in the binary expansion corresponds to a **blue** piece.\n*   A \"0\" in the binary expansion corresponds to a **red** piece.\n\nApplying this to 13/16 (binary 0.1101):\n*   The first digit after the decimal point is **1**, representing the 1/2 place, which requires a **blue** piece.\n*   The second digit is **1**, for the 1/4 place, requiring another **blue** piece.\n*   The third digit is **0**, for the 1/8 place, requiring a **red** piece.\n*   The fourth digit is **1**, for the 1/16 place, requiring a **blue** piece.\n\nTherefore, the representation of 13/16 is a stalk of four pieces. Counting the pieces of each color:\n*   **3 blue pieces**\n*   **1 red piece**\n\nThe total number of pieces needed is the sum of the blue and red pieces, which is 3 + 1 = 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
