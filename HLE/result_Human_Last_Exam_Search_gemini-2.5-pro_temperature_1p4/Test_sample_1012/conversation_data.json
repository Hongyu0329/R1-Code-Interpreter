    "To ensure a symmetric key cannot be cracked by an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer, its length must be sufficient to withstand quantum algorithms, most notably Grover's algorithm. Grover's algorithm offers a quadratic speed-up on brute-force key searches, effectively halving the security of a symmetric key.\n\nA brute-force attack on a symmetric key of length 'n' would take a classical computer on the order of 2^n operations. A quantum computer utilizing Grover's algorithm can solve the same problem in roughly 2^(n/2) operations. Consequently, a 128-bit symmetric key, which provides 128 bits of security against classical computers, would only offer 64 bits of security against a quantum computer. This level of security is considered insufficient for long-term protection.\n\nTo achieve a security level of 128 bits against a quantum attacker, which is widely regarded as a strong and secure level for the foreseeable future, it is necessary to double the key length. Therefore, a symmetric key of 256 bits is the recommended minimum length to be considered quantum-resistant. An AES-256 key, for example, would have its effective security reduced to 128 bits by Grover's algorithm, a level that remains computationally infeasible to break even for quantum computers. This is the standard recommended by organizations like the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for post-quantum cryptography.\n\n<<<A>>>"
