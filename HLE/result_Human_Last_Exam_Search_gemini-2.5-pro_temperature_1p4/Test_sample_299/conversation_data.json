    "The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $|\\mathbb{R}|$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step argument to arrive at this conclusion:\n\n### 1. Properties of the function `f`\n\nFirst, we establish some fundamental properties that any such continuous function `f` must have.\n\n*   **Injectivity**: The function `f` must be one-to-one. If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then applying `f` to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since the exponential function is itself injective, it follows that $x_1 = x_2$.\n*   **Monotonicity**: A continuous and injective function defined on the real numbers must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n*   **Composition Monotonicity**: The composition $f(f(x))$ is $e^x$, which is a strictly increasing function.\n    *   If `f` were strictly increasing, its composition with itself, $f(f(x))$, would also be strictly increasing. This is consistent.\n    *   If `f` were strictly decreasing, its composition with itself, $f(f(x))$, would be strictly increasing. This is also consistent.\n\nSo, any solution `f` must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n### 2. Ruling out Decreasing Solutions\n\nLet's assume `f` is a strictly decreasing continuous function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. Such a function must have exactly one fixed point; that is, there exists a unique real number $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$.\n\nTo see why, consider the auxiliary function $h(x) = f(x) - x$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x)$ decreases, so $h(x) \\to -\\infty$. As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x)$ increases, so $h(x) \\to \\infty$. Since $h(x)$ is continuous and its range spans from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that there must be a point $x_0$ where $h(x_0) = 0$, which means $f(x_0) = x_0$.\n\nIf such a fixed point $x_0$ exists, we can apply `f` to the equation $f(x_0) = x_0$:\n$f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0)$\nGiven the original equation, this becomes:\n$e^{x_0} = x_0$\n\nHowever, the equation $e^x = x$ has no real solutions. The function $g(x) = e^x - x$ has a global minimum value of 1 at $x=0$, meaning $e^x > x$ for all real numbers $x$. This contradiction proves that no strictly decreasing continuous function can satisfy the given equation.\n\n### 3. Existence and Cardinality of Increasing Solutions\n\nSince decreasing solutions are ruled out, we only need to consider strictly increasing solutions. For such a function `f`, the inequality $e^x > x$ implies that $f(f(x)) > x$. This can only be true if $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, any solution must satisfy $x < f(x) < f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n\nThe existence of such functions is a known result in the study of functional equations, specifically concerning functional square roots. Solutions can be constructed, and the number of solutions is uncountably infinite.\n\nA standard method to show there are many solutions involves these steps:\n1.  **Restrict the domain**: Define the function `f` on a specific interval, for instance, `[0, a]`, where `a` is a chosen value.\n2.  **Freedom of choice**: The function on this starting interval can be chosen with considerable freedom. For example, let $a=f(0)$. Since $f(x)>x$, we have $a>0$. From $f(f(0)) = e^0=1$, we get $f(a)=1$. So we can choose `f` on `[0,a]` to be any continuous, strictly increasing function (a homeomorphism) that maps `[0, a]` to `[a, 1]`.\n3.  **Extend the function**: Once `f` is defined on this initial piece, its definition can be extended uniquely to the rest of the real numbers by repeatedly using the relations $f(f(x)) = e^x$ and the derived property $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$.\n\nThe number of ways to choose the initial function in step 2 determines the cardinality of the solution set. The set of homeomorphisms from `[0, a]` to `[a, 1]` has the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. For instance, for any real number $c > 0$, the function $h(x) = a + (1-a)(x/a)^c$ provides a distinct homeomorphism, demonstrating there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such choices.\n\nSo, the set of solutions has a cardinality of at least $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### 4. The Upper Bound\n\nThe set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has a cardinality of $\\mathfrak{c}$. This can be shown because a continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on a dense subset, like the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. The set of all functions from $\\mathbb{Q}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $|\\mathbb{R}|^{|\\mathbb{Q}|} = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$. The set of solutions is a subset of all continuous functions, so its cardinality cannot be greater than $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the cardinality of the set of solutions is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ and at most $\\mathfrak{c}$, it must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n<<<c>>>"
