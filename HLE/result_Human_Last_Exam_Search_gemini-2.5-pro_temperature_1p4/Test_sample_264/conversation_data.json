    "The search results confirm that when dealing with axis-aligned cubes, the volume of intersection is found by calculating the overlap in each dimension. The problem specifies a shift \"along the main diagonal\". In the context of an axis-aligned cube, the main diagonal is the vector connecting opposite corners, such as (0,0,0) and (1,1,1). A shift \"along\" this diagonal is most commonly interpreted as a vector shift with equal components along each axis.\n\nLet's proceed with this interpretation.\n\n1.  **Define the first cube (C1):** Let the first cube be defined by the region where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ z ≤ 1.\n\n2.  **Define the shift:** The main diagonal connects vertices (0,0,0) and (1,1,1). A shift of 1/2 \"along\" this diagonal implies a displacement vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n3.  **Define the second cube (C2):** The second cube is the first cube shifted by the vector (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). Its boundaries are therefore 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2, 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2, and 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2.\n\n4.  **Calculate the intersection:** The volume of the intersection is the product of the lengths of the overlapping intervals for each coordinate.\n    *   **x-axis:** The interval for C1 is and for C2 is [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection of these two intervals is [1/2, 1], which has a length of 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n    *   **y-axis:** Similarly, the intersection of and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1], with a length of 1/2.\n    *   **z-axis:** Again, the intersection of and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1], with a length of 1/2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the volume of the intersection:** The intersection forms a smaller cube with a side length of 1/2. The volume is the product of the side lengths:\n    Volume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\nThis method is confirmed by multiple sources that discuss the intersection of axis-aligned bounding boxes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\frac{1}{8}$\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
