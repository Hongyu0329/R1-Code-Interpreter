    "### The Partition Function Z in the Grand Canonical Ensemble via Path Integrals\n\nThe partition function, Z, for a quantum mechanical system in the grand canonical ensemble is given by the trace of the statistical operator e^(-β(H' - μN')), where H' is the Hamiltonian operator of the system, N' is the particle number operator, μ is the chemical potential, and β = 1/(k_B T) is the inverse temperature.\n\nGiven the system Hamiltonian H' = -μN', the grand canonical Hamiltonian, H'_{GC}, becomes:\n\nH'_{GC} = H' - μN' = -μN' - μN' = -2μN'\n\nThus, the partition function for this specific system is:\n\nZ = Tr[e^(-βH'_{GC})] = Tr[e^(-β(-2μN'))] = Tr[e^(2βμN')]\n\nTo express this partition function using path integrals, we transition from the operator formalism to a functional integral over classical fields that depend on imaginary time, τ. The imaginary time formalism is a standard technique for connecting quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. The trace operation necessitates that the fields obey periodic boundary conditions for bosons or anti-periodic boundary conditions for fermions over the imaginary time interval [0, β].\n\nThe partition function Z is expressed as a functional integral of the exponential of a negative Euclidean action, S_E:\n\nZ = ∫D(ψ*, ψ) e^(-S_E[ψ*, ψ])\n\nThe Euclidean action, S_E, is derived from the grand canonical Hamiltonian. The fields ψ*(x, τ) and ψ(x, τ) are classical functions corresponding to the quantum field operators, and they depend on the spatial coordinate x and the imaginary time τ. The number operator N' is represented by the integral of the number density, N' = ∫ d^d x ψ'†(x)ψ'(x), where ψ'† and ψ' are the field operators.\n\nThe Euclidean Lagrangian density, L_E, corresponding to a grand canonical Hamiltonian H'_{GC} is generally given by:\n\nL_E = ψ*(∂_τ ψ) + h_{GC}(ψ*, ψ)\n\nwhere h_{GC} is the classical Hamiltonian density corresponding to the operator H'_{GC}. For the given system, the Hamiltonian density h corresponding to H' = -μN' is h = -μψ*ψ. Therefore, the grand canonical Hamiltonian density is:\n\nh_{GC} = h - μn = -μψ*ψ - μψ*ψ = -2μψ*ψ\n\nwhere n = ψ*ψ is the number density.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the Euclidean Lagrangian density gives:\n\nL_E = ψ*(∂_τ ψ) - 2μψ*ψ = ψ*(∂_τ - 2μ)ψ\n\nThe Euclidean action is the integral of the Lagrangian density over imaginary time and space:\n\nS_E = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d^d x L_E = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d^d x ψ*(x, τ)(∂_τ - 2μ)ψ(x, τ)\n\nFinally, the partition function Z for a system with the Hamiltonian H' = -μN' in the grand canonical ensemble, expressed as a path integral, is:\n\n**Z = ∫D(ψ*, ψ) exp{-∫₀^β dτ ∫ d^d x ψ*(x, τ)(∂_τ - 2μ)ψ(x, τ)}**\n\nThe term D(ψ*, ψ) represents the functional integration measure over all possible field configurations. The fields ψ(x, τ) are subject to the appropriate boundary conditions in the imaginary time variable τ, being periodic for bosons (ψ(x, 0) = ψ(x, β)) and anti-periodic for fermions (ψ(x, 0) = -ψ(x, β)).\n\n<<<**Z = ∫D(ψ*, ψ) exp{-∫₀^β dτ ∫ d^d x ψ*(x, τ)(∂_τ - 2μ)ψ(x, τ)}**>>>"
