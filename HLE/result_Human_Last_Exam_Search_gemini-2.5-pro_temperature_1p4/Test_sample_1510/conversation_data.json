    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nA wallpaper group is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern based on its symmetries. There are 17 such groups. The point group of a wallpaper group consists of the rotational and reflectional symmetries that leave at least one point fixed. A point group of order 2 has exactly two symmetry operations: the identity operation and either a 180-degree rotation or a reflection.\n\nThe two-dimensional point groups of order 2 are:\n*   **C₂**: This group contains a rotation of 180 degrees (also known as a half-turn or a 2-fold rotation).\n*   **D₁**: This group contains a single reflection. It is also referred to as Cₛ.\n\nThe following four wallpaper groups have a point group of order 2:\n*   **p2**: This group has a point group of C₂. Its symmetries include 180-degree rotations but no reflections or glide reflections.\n*   **pm**: This group has a point group of D₁. It features parallel reflection axes.\n*   **pg**: This group also has a point group of D₁. It contains glide reflections, which are equivalent to reflections in the point group, but no simple reflections.\n*   **cm**: This group's point group is D₁. It has parallel reflection axes and glide reflections.\n\nOther wallpaper groups have point groups of different orders. For instance, the point group of **p1** has order 1, while the point groups of **pmm**, **pmg**, **pgg**, and **cmm** all have an order of 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
