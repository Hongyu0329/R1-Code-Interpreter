    "Under the assumption that the Jacobian of a genus 4 curve defined over a valuation field has good reduction, there are 11 types of stable reductions.\n\nThe condition that the Jacobian has good reduction imposes a strong topological constraint on the stable reduction of the curve. The reduction of the Jacobian of a stable curve is an extension of an abelian variety by a torus, where the dimension of the torus is the first Betti number of the dual graph of the stable curve. Good reduction implies this torus is trivial, meaning the dual graph of the stable reduction must be a tree.\n\nA stable curve is a connected curve with only ordinary double points as singularities, and a finite automorphism group. This stability condition implies that any irreducible component of genus 0 (a rational curve) must intersect the other components at a minimum of three points, translating to its corresponding vertex in the dual graph having a degree of at least three. Furthermore, for a stable curve whose dual graph is a tree, its arithmetic genus is the sum of the genera of its irreducible components.\n\nWe can classify the types of stable reductions by enumerating the possible tree structures for the dual graph and the possible assignments of genera to the components, such that the sum of the genera is 4 and the stability conditions are met.\n\nThe 11 types of stable reductions are classified by the number of irreducible components in the reduction:\n\n*   **One component (1 type):**\n    1.  A single smooth curve of genus 4.\n\n*   **Two components (2 types):** The dual graph is a single edge connecting two vertices. Both components must have genus greater than 0.\n    2.  A genus 3 curve and a genus 1 curve, intersecting at one point.\n    3.  Two genus 2 curves intersecting at one point.\n\n*   **Three components (2 types):** The dual graph is a path. No component can be of genus 0. The only partition of 4 into three positive integers is (2, 1, 1).\n    4.  A central genus 2 curve connected to two genus 1 curves.\n    5.  A central genus 1 curve connected to a genus 2 curve and another genus 1 curve.\n\n*   **Four components (3 types):** The dual graph is a tree with four vertices (either a path or a star-shape).\n    6.  A path of four genus 1 curves.\n    7.  A central genus 1 curve connected to three other genus 1 curves (star-shaped).\n    8.  A central rational (genus 0) curve connected to one genus 2 curve and two genus 1 curves.\n\n*   **Five components (2 types):** The dual graph is a tree with five vertices. For the sum of genera to be 4, at least one component must be rational.\n    9.  A central rational curve connected to four genus 1 curves.\n    10. A rational curve connected to three other components, one of which is a genus 1 curve that is, in turn, connected to another genus 1 curve. All non-rational components are genus 1.\n\n*   **Six components (1 type):** The dual graph is a tree with six vertices and must contain at least two rational components.\n    11. A configuration with two rational components joined together, each of which is also connected to two genus 1 curves.\n\nIt can be shown that no stable curve satisfying these conditions can have more than six components.\n\n<<<11>>>"
