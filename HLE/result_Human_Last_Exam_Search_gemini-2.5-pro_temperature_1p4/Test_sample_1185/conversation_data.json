    "The classification of stable reductions for curves of genus 2 results in **10 distinct types** when considering their dual graphs. This classification was notably carried out by Namikawa and Ueno.\n\nA stable curve of genus 2 can be either a single irreducible curve with nodes or a collection of lower-genus curves connected at points. The structure of these stable curves can be described by what is known as a dual graph, where vertices represent irreducible components and edges represent the nodes where they intersect. The different configurations of these dual graphs give rise to the various types of stable reduction.\n\nWhile a broader classification considers the two main components of the boundary of the moduli space of genus 2 curves, a more detailed analysis, such as the one provided by Namikawa and Ueno, breaks these down further. Their work provides a complete geometrical classification of the fibers in pencils of curves of genus two.\n\nIt is worth noting that more recent research, particularly concerning hyperelliptic curves and specific residue characteristics, has led to even more granular classifications. For instance, for hyperelliptic genus 2 curves with marked Weierstrass points in residue characteristic 2, there is a classification into 54 different reduction types. Another source mentions 104 families of reduction types for genus 2 curves, based on the Kodaira types of their components. However, the foundational and most commonly cited answer for the number of general stable reduction types for genus 2 curves is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
