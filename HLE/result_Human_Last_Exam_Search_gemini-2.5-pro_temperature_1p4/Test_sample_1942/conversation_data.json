    "Peter Sloterdijk considers that the State is a metaphor for the **macrosphere**.\n\nIn his extensive work, particularly in the *Spheres* trilogy, Sloterdijk develops the concept of \"anthropospheres\" or \"spheres\" as self-created and maintained interiors that human beings inhabit. These spheres function as immune systems, protecting individuals and groups from the outside world.\n\nSloterdijk categorizes these spheres by size, distinguishing between microspheres and macrospheres. While microspheres encompass intimate spaces like the family and home, macrospheres refer to larger, collective structures. Sloterdijk explicitly includes \"nation states\" in his analysis of macrospheres, alongside other examples such as cities and religious systems. Therefore, for Sloterdijk, the State is a form of a macrosphere, a large-scale structure that provides a protective and shaping environment for its inhabitants.\n\n<<<macrosphere>>>"
