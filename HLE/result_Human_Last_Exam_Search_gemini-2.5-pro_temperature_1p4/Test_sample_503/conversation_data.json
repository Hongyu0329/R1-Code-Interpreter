    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-category, corresponds to a Galois connection between the posets $[m]$ and $[n]$. The question asks for the number of such adjunctions from $$ to $$.\n\nAn adjunction from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ in this context is a pair of order-preserving maps, a left adjoint $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and a right adjoint $g: [n] \\to [m]$, satisfying the inequalities $id_{[m]} \\le g \\circ f$ and $f \\circ g \\le id_{[n]}$.\n\nA crucial property, confirmed by the search results, is that an order-preserving map $f: P \\to Q$ between posets is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). Similarly, a map $g: Q \\to P$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets). The objects of the simplex category, $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$, are finite totally ordered sets, which are complete lattices.\n\nFor a map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ to be a left adjoint, it must preserve all joins. A key join to consider is the join of the empty set, which is the bottom element of the poset. Thus, $f$ must map the bottom element of $[m]$ to the bottom element of $[n]$. This means $f(0)$ must be $0$. Conversely, if $f(0)=0$ and $f$ is order-preserving, it can be shown that $f$ preserves all joins, thus guaranteeing the existence of a unique right adjoint $g$. Therefore, counting the number of adjunctions is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ such that $f(0) = 0$.\n\nSuch a map is a sequence of integers $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ satisfying:\n$0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nSince $f(0)$ is fixed at 0, the problem reduces to counting the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23, namely $f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(23)$, with values chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars.\n\nThis is equivalent to choosing 23 numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ (which has $37+1=38$ elements) with replacement, where the order of selection does not matter (as they will be arranged into a non-decreasing sequence). The formula for combinations with repetition is $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$, where $k$ is the number of items to choose and $n$ is the number of categories to choose from.\nIn this case, $k=23$ (the number of values to choose for $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$) and $n=38$ (the number of possible values for each $f(i)$).\n\nThe number of such maps is:\n$\\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nTo confirm this, one can also count the number of right adjoints $g: \\to$. A map $g$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all meets. This requires that it maps the top element of $$ to the top element of $$, i.e., $g(37) = 23$. This leads to counting the number of non-decreasing sequences $0 \\le g(0) \\le \\dots \\le g(36) \\le 23$. The number of such sequences is $\\binom{23+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$, which is equal to $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is therefore $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nCalculating the value of this binomial coefficient:\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!(60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!}$\nThis number is $42,670,419,088,843,200$.\n\n<<<42670419088843200>>>"
