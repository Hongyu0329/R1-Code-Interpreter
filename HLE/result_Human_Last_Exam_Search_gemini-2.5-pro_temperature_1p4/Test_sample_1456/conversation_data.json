    "A \"continuum,\" as defined in the user's prompt, is a compact connected metric space. A \"nondegenerate\" continuum is one that consists of more than one point. The \"composant\" of a point *p* within a continuum *A* is the union of all proper subcontinua of *A* that include *p*.\n\nA key concept in this context is that of an \"indecomposable continuum,\" which is a continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. For an indecomposable continuum, the aformentioned composants are pairwise disjoint. A significant result in this area of topology is that any nondegenerate metrizable indecomposable continuum has *c* composants, where *c* is the cardinality of the real line.\n\nThe question asks for the largest possible number of composants of the *product* of two nondegenerate continua. Let's consider two indecomposable continua, X and Y. The number of aformentioned composants in each is *c*. The product of these two spaces, X x Y, is also a continuum.\n\nThe number of composants in the product of two indecomposable continua is c. The argument for this is as follows: any two points in the product space whose first coordinates lie in the same composant of the first space belong to the same composant of the product space. The same logic applies to the second coordinate. More formally, if (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are two points in the product space X x Y, and if x1 and x2 are in the same composant of X, then there exists a proper subcontinuum Kx of X containing both x1 and x2. Then, Kx x {y1} is a proper subcontinuum of X x Y containing (x1, y1) and (x2, y1). Similarly, {x2} x Y is a continuum containing (x2, y1) and (x2, y2). The union of these two subcontinua is a proper subcontinuum of X x Y connecting (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), therefore they belong to the same composant of the product. This implies that the number of composants in the product is at most the number of composants in the factor spaces. Since each factor space has c composants, the product has at most c composants. The number of composants is also at least c, which means the number is exactly c.\n\nIf we take X and Y to be nondegenerate indecomposable continua, the number of composants in X is c and in Y is c. The number of composants in the product X x Y is also c. There also exist indecomposable continua with a number of composants equal to 2^c, where c is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nIt has been shown that for any infinite cardinal number α, there exists an indecomposable continuum with 2^α composants. Let c be the cardinality of the continuum. Then there exists an indecomposable continuum X with 2^c composants. If we take the product of X with any nondegenerate continuum Y, the number of composants in X × Y will be at least the number of composants in X. Therefore, the product of two nondegenerate continua can have 2^c composants.\n\nThe largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is **c**, the cardinality of the continuum. However, other sources state that it is possible to construct an indecomposable continuum with 2^c composants. If one of the continua in the product has 2^c composants, the product will also have 2^c composants.\n\nLet X and Y be two nondegenerate continua.\nIf X and Y are both indecomposable, then each has *c* (the cardinality of the continuum) composants. The product X x Y also has *c* composants.\nIt is possible to construct an indecomposable continuum with 2^c composants.\nLet X be such a continuum with 2^c composants, and let Y be any nondegenerate continuum. The product space X × Y will have at least 2^c composants. Thus, the largest possible number of composants is 2^c.\n\nFinal Answer: The largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is 2^c, where c is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nI will search for the number of composants of a product of continua.\nI will specifically look for results on the product of indecomposable continua.\nI will synthesize the findings to determine the maximum possible number of composants.\nI will formulate the final answer based on the research.\nThe final answer is **c**, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nLet X and Y be two nondegenerate continua. Let C(S) denote the set of composants of a continuum S. We want to find the maximum possible cardinality of C(X × Y).\n\nConsider the case where X and Y are indecomposable continua. In a metrizable indecomposable continuum, the number of composants is *c*, the cardinality of the real line. Let's analyze the composants of the product space X × Y.\n\nLet (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) be two points in X × Y. If x₁ and x₂ belong to the same composant of X, there exists a proper subcontinuum Kₓ of X containing both x₁ and x₂. Then Kₓ × {y₁} is a proper subcontinuum of X × Y that contains (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₁). Similarly, {x₂} × Y is a continuum containing (x₂, y₁) and (x₂, y₂). The union (Kₓ × {y₁}) ∪ ({x₂} × Y) is a subcontinuum of X × Y containing (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂). This union is a proper subcontinuum of X × Y. Therefore, (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) lie in the same composant of X × Y.\n\nThis implies that if two points in the product have their first coordinates in the same composant of the first factor space, they themselves are in the same composant of the product space. A similar argument holds for the second coordinate.\n\nLet p₁ = (x₁, y₁) and p₂ = (x₂, y₂) be in the same composant of X × Y. Then there is a proper subcontinuum K of X × Y containing p₁ and p₂. Let π₁: X × Y → X and π₂: X × Y → Y be the projection maps. Then π₁(K) is a subcontinuum of X containing x₁ and x₂, and π₂(K) is a subcontinuum of Y containing y₁ and y₂. Since K is a proper subcontinuum, at least one of π₁(K) or π₂(K) must be a proper subcontinuum.\n\nLet C be a composant of X x Y. Let (x,y) be a point in C. For any other point (x', y') in C, there is a proper subcontinuum K of X x Y containing both (x,y) and (x',y'). The projections of K, π₁(K) and π₂(K), are subcontinua of X and Y, respectively. Since K is a proper subcontinuum, at least one of the projections must also be a proper subcontinuum. This means that all the first coordinates of points in C lie in a single composant of X, or all the second coordinates lie in a single composant of Y.\n\nThis indicates that the number of composants of the product is related to the number of composants of the factor spaces. If X and Y are indecomposable continua, they each have *c* composants. The product X × Y will also have *c* composants.\n\nThere also exist indecomposable continua with 2^c composants. If we take one of the continua, say X, to be such a continuum, and Y to be any nondegenerate continuum, the product X × Y will have at least 2^c composants.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is 2^c, the power of the continuum.The largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is **c**, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of this result:\n\n1.  **Definitions**:\n    *   A **continuum** is a compact, connected metric space.\n    *   A continuum is **nondegenerate** if it contains more than one point.\n    *   The **composant** of a point *p* in a continuum *X* is the set of all points *q* in *X* for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of *X* (a subcontinuum that is not equal to *X*) containing both *p* and *q*.\n    *   A continuum is **indecomposable** if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. Otherwise, it is **decomposable**.\n\n2.  **Number of Composants in a Metric Continuum**:\n    A fundamental result in continuum theory states that any given metric continuum can only have one of three possibilities for its number of composants:\n    *   A decomposable continuum has either 1 or 3 composants.\n    *   An indecomposable continuum has exactly **c** composants, where **c** is the cardinality of the continuum (the number of points on the real line).\n\n3.  **The Product of Two Continua**:\n    If *X* and *Y* are two nondegenerate continua, their Cartesian product, *X* × *Y*, equipped with the standard product topology, is also a nondegenerate continuum. As such, the number of composants of *X* × *Y* must be 1, 3, or **c**.\n\n4.  **Determining the Maximum Number**:\n    From the previous point, the largest possible number of composants for the product *X* × *Y* cannot exceed **c**. To confirm that **c** is the maximum possible value, we need to show that this number is achievable.\n\n5.  **Achievability of c**:\n    It has been proven that if *X* and *Y* are both indecomposable metric continua, then their product, *X* × *Y*, has **c** composants. Nondegenerate indecomposable continua exist; a well-known example is the Brouwer-Janiszewski-Knaster continuum (often called the bucket-handle).\n\nTherefore, by taking two such indecomposable continua, their product will be a continuum with **c** composants. This demonstrates that **c** is an attainable number of composants.\n\nCombining these points, the number of composants for the product of two nondegenerate continua is always 1, 3, or **c**, and the value **c** can be achieved. Thus, the largest possible number of composants is **c**.\n\n<<<c>>>"
