    "True.\n\nSNP heritability is defined as the proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by all considered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a population. It represents the theoretical upper limit of prediction for a linear model based on these SNPs.\n\nA polygenic score (PGS) is a tool used to predict a phenotype based on a weighted sum of risk alleles from a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The predictive ability of a PGS is measured by the variance it explains in the phenotype.\n\nIn an ideal, theoretical scenario where the effects of all SNPs are estimated without any error from an infinitely large GWAS, and the PGS is applied to a perfectly matched target sample, the variance explained by the PGS could, in principle, equal the SNP heritability. However, in practice, this is never the case. The estimation of SNP effects from GWAS data always involves some level of error, and there are typically differences between the GWAS sample (base data) and the sample in which the PGS is being used for prediction (target data).\n\nThese factors, including estimation errors and differences in population structure or linkage disequilibrium between samples, mean that the predictive power of a polygenic score is practically always lower than the SNP heritability. Therefore, while there's a theoretical possibility of equality under perfect conditions that are never met, the predictive ability of a polygenic score is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability in any real-world application.\n\n<<<True>>>"
