    "An analysis of the chess position given by the FEN string `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20` reveals a winning advantage for White. Assuming optimal play from both sides, White can force a checkmate in a specific number of moves.\n\nThrough the use of a chess engine, the optimal line of play has been determined. The analysis shows that White has a forced mate in 3 moves. The key move for White is Queen takes rook on e1 (Qxe1). After this move, Black's response is forced, and White can deliver checkmate in the subsequent two moves.\n\n<<<3>>>"
