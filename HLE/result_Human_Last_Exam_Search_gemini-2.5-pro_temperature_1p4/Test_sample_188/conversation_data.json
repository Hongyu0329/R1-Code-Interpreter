  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "To determine the maximum possible length of the secret message, we must first understand the encoding scheme. The problem is one of information theory, where we need to find out how many symbols from the *Ching* are required to represent one character from the *Shu*.\n\n### 1. Alphabet of the Secret Message\n\nThe secret message is written using the character set found in the *Shu*. The problem states that the *Shu* is written with 120 of the most common Chinese characters. Therefore, the alphabet for our secret message consists of 120 unique characters.\n\n### 2. Symbols Available for Encoding\n\nThe *Ching* is composed of \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbols. This can be broken down as:\n*   **Yinyang**: Two states (yin and yang).\n*   **Wuxing**: The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth), representing five states.\n\nThe total number of unique symbols in the *Ching*'s system is the product of the number of states for each component.\nTotal unique symbols = 2 (yin/yang) × 5 (wuxing) = 10 unique symbols.\n\n### 3. Encoding Characters with Symbols\n\nWe need to determine how many of these 10 unique symbols are required to represent one of the 120 characters of the message. Let `n` be the number of symbols from the *Ching* used to encode a single character.\n\n*   If we use 1 symbol, we can represent 10¹ = 10 unique characters. This is less than the required 120.\n*   If we use 2 symbols, we can represent 10² = 100 unique characters. This is still insufficient.\n*   If we use 3 symbols, we can represent 10³ = 1000 unique characters. This is more than enough to represent all 120 characters.\n\nTherefore, a minimum of 3 symbols from the *Ching* are needed to uniquely encode each character of the secret message.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Maximum Message Length\n\nThe *Ching* contains a total of 9999 symbols. Since each character of the message requires 3 of these symbols, the maximum length of the message is the total number of symbols divided by the number of symbols per character.\n\nMaximum Message Length = (Total Symbols in Ching) / (Symbols per Character)\nMaximum Message Length = 9999 / 3\nMaximum Message Length = 3333\n\nThe information regarding the time taken for computer vision recognition (12 ms) and CPU operations (10 ns and 30 ns) is not relevant to calculating the maximum possible length of the encrypted message.\n\n<<<3333>>>"
