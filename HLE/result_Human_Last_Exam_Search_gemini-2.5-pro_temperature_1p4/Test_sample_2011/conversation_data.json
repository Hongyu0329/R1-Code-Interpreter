    "The problem asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously exist as induced subgraphs in a single graph with n = 128 vertices.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the key terms:\n*   A **clique** is a subset of vertices in a graph where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. A clique of size *k* is denoted as K_k.\n*   An **induced subgraph** is formed by a subset of vertices and all the edges that connect pairs of vertices in that subset within the original graph.\n*   An **induced clique** of size *k* means there is a set of *k* vertices in the graph such that the subgraph induced by them is a complete graph, K_k. This is equivalent to simply having a clique of size *k* in the graph.\n\nLet G be a graph with n = 128 vertices. Let S be the set of all integers *k* such that there is an induced clique of size *k* in G. The question asks for the maximum possible value of |S|, the number of different clique sizes.\n\nIf a graph G contains a clique of a certain size, say *k*, then it must also contain cliques of all smaller sizes. Let's say there is a clique C with *k* vertices. Any subset of C containing *j* vertices (where 1 ≤ j ≤ k) will also form a clique, as all its vertices are pair-wise connected.\n\nThis implies that the set of possible clique sizes, S, for any given graph G, will always be a continuous set of integers starting from 1. Specifically, if the largest clique in the graph G (known as the clique number, ω(G)) has size *k_max*, then the set of all clique sizes present in G will be S = {1, 2, 3, ..., *k_max*}. Consequently, the number of different clique sizes is simply the size of the largest clique, *k_max*.\n\nTherefore, the problem is transformed into finding the maximum possible clique number, ω(G), for a graph with 128 vertices. The size of any clique in a graph cannot exceed the total number of vertices. For a graph with n = 128 vertices, the maximum possible size of a clique is 128.\n\nThis maximum is achieved by the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted K_128. In K_128, all 128 vertices are connected to each other, forming a single large clique of size 128. Since this graph contains a clique of size 128, it also contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128. Thus, for K_128, the number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\nSince it's impossible to have a clique larger than the number of vertices, it's not possible to have more than 128 different clique sizes.\n\n<<<128>>>"
