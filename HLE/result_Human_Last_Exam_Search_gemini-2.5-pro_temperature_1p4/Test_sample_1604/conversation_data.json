    "The latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the Action at Agagia, which occurred on February 26, 1916, during the First World War.\n\nElizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler, was a renowned British painter famous for her military scenes. While she painted numerous battles from the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, and various colonial conflicts, her later works depicted events from the First World War.\n\nThe specific paintings from this era include:\n*   ***The Retreat from Mons***: Depicting events of August and September 1914.\n*   ***Charge of the London Irish Rifles at Loos***: Showing the Battle of Loos, which began on September 25, 1915.\n*   ***The Dorset Yeomen at Agagia***: Illustrating the cavalry charge during the Action at Agagia in Egypt on February 26, 1916. This was part of the Senussi Campaign. The painting was commissioned in 1916 and depicts what is considered one of the last regimental cavalry charges by the British Army.\n\nAnother of her last paintings was titled *A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders*, completed in 1929. While this portrays a scene from the First World War in Flanders (1914-1918), it does not depict a specific, dated event that can be placed later than the Action at Agagia. Therefore, based on definitive historical events, the battle shown in *The Dorset Yeomen at Agagia* is the latest.\n\n<<<The Action at Agagia>>>"
