    "**The First Book of the Bible Mentioned by Name in a Shakespeare Play is Numbers, Found in *Love's Labour's Lost*.**\n\nThe fourth book of the canonical Bible, the Book of Numbers, is the first to be explicitly named in a Shakespearean play. The reference appears in Act 4, Scene 3 of *Love's Labour's Lost*.\n\nIn the play, the character of Holofernes, a pedantic schoolmaster, says, \"and here are the numbers ratified.\" While seemingly a simple statement, scholars of Shakespearean and biblical allusions point to this as a direct and intentional naming of the biblical book.\n\nShakespeare was a prolific referrer to the scriptures, with scholars identifying hundreds of allusions to various books of the Bible throughout his works. The book of Genesis, for example, is frequently alluded to in plays such as *Richard II*, *The Merchant of Venice*, and *3 Henry VI*. There are also notable references to Exodus in several plays and to Leviticus in *Macbeth* and *Measure for Measure*. However, these are typically allusions to stories or themes rather than explicit mentions of the books by name.\n\nThe line in *Love's Labour's Lost* stands out as a direct naming of a biblical book, and given its position as the fourth book in the Old Testament, it precedes any other named biblical book in canonical order found within Shakespeare's plays. The play itself is believed to have been written in the mid-1590s.\n\n<<<Numbers, in *Love's Labour's Lost*>>>"
