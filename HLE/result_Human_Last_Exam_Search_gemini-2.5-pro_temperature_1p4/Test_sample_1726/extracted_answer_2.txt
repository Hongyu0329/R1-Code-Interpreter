In a Euclidean spacetime, the relativistic effects of simultaneity, length, and time would still be true, though derived from 4D rotations. The invariance of the 3D speed of light would be replaced by an invariant 4D speed. The addition of speeds would be non-Newtonian but would differ from the standard relativistic formula. The formulas for length contraction and time dilation would be the same as in Special Relativity.
