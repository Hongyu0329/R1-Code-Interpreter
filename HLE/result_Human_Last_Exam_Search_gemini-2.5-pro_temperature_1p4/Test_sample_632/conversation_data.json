    "Until the early 1950s, the Piazza della Rotonda was characterized by a feature that, while not strictly architectural, was a unique and long-standing element of its identity: a tram line. The city administration of Rome removed this feature as part of a broader effort to reorganize urban traffic and preserve the historic center.\n\nThe tramway tracks and the associated overhead electrical lines ran through the piazza, significantly impacting its visual and functional character. The removal of the tram line was a significant change that altered the square's appearance and atmosphere, transitioning it from a bustling transport hub to the pedestrian-friendly space it is today. This change was in line with a growing awareness of the need to protect Rome's monumental areas from the increasing pressures of modern traffic.\n\nWhile many historical alterations have shaped the Piazza della Rotonda over the centuries—including the clearing of market stalls and additions or modifications to the central fountain—the removal of the tramway in the post-war era represents a key moment in the 20th-century history of the square and its adaptation to the needs of a modern capital.\n\n<<<A tram line>>>"
