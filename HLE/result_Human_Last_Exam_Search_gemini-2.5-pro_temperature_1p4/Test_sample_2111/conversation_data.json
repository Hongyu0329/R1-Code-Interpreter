    "Fernand Braudel, in his work *The Identity of France*, quotes Paul Morand's assertion that \"any history of France must be inscribed within the hexagon.\" The conceptual entity, exemplified by the symbol of a nation (in this case, the hexagon for France), is **France** itself.\n\nThe reference appears in the preface to Braudel's influential book. While the user's query mentioned a \"sphere,\" the actual geometric shape referred to by Braudel and Morand is the hexagon, a common nickname and visual representation for mainland France. Braudel uses this quote to introduce his own, more expansive approach to French history, one that goes beyond the simple geographical confines of the hexagon to consider broader influences and a more global perspective.\n\nThe specific allusion can be found in Braudel's discussions on the geographical and conceptual boundaries of the nation, where he credits Morand with this pointed observation about the national identity being tied to its territorial shape.\n\n<<<France>>>"
