For a magnetic cylinder with uniform susceptibility χ=0 and a length-to-diameter ratio `g`, the analytical expression for the fluxmetric demagnetizing factor \(N_f\) is given by:
`N_f = 1 - (2*sqrt(1+g²)/π) * [ ( (1+2g²)/(2(1+g²)) ) * K(k) - E(k) ]`
where `k` is the modulus of the complete elliptic integrals `K(k)` and `E(k)`, defined as:
`k = 1 / sqrt(1 + g²)`
