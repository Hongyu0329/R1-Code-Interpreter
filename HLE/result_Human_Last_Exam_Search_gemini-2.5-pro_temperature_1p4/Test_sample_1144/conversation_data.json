    "To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit, we will first calculate the uncertainty in momentum using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and then determine the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit.\n\n### 1. Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp)\n\nHeisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is at least a constant value. The principle is expressed as:\nΔx ⋅ Δp ≥ h / 4π\n\nwhere:\n*   Δx is the uncertainty in position.\n*   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   h is Planck's constant (approximately 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\nGiven the uncertainty in the electron's position is 10 pm:\nΔx = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m\n\nWe can calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\nΔp = h / (4π ⋅ Δx)\nΔp = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (4π ⋅ 10 x 10⁻¹² m)\nΔp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s.\n\n### 2. Momentum in the First Bohr Orbit (p)\n\nAccording to the Bohr model, the angular momentum (L) of an electron in an orbit is quantized:\nL = mvr = n ⋅ (h / 2π)\n\nwhere:\n*   m is the mass of the electron.\n*   v is the velocity of the electron.\n*   r is the radius of the orbit.\n*   n is the principal quantum number (for the first orbit, n=1).\n*   Momentum p = mv.\n\nFrom the quantization condition, the momentum (p) can be expressed as:\np = n ⋅ h / (2π ⋅ r)\n\nFor the first Bohr orbit (n=1) of a hydrogen atom, the radius (known as the Bohr radius, a₀) is approximately 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m.\n\np = (1 ⋅ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2π ⋅ 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m)\np ≈ 1.99 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n### 3. Ratio of Uncertainty in Momentum to Momentum\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum to the momentum:\nRatio = Δp / p\nRatio = (5.27 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s) / (1.99 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s)\nRatio ≈ 2.65\n\n<<<2.65>>>"
