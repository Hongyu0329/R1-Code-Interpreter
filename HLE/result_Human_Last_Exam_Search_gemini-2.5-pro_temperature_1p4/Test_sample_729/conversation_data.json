    "The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, is a non-abelian group with a specific structure. To determine the number of its power subgroups, we must first understand its definition and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n### Definition of Generalized Quaternion Group Q_128\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order 128, Q_128, can be defined by the following presentation:\nQ_128 = < a, x | a⁶⁴ = 1, x² = a³², xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹ >\n\nThe elements of this group are of two forms:\n1.  Powers of `a`: aⁱ, for i = 0, 1, ..., 63. These elements form a cyclic subgroup of order 64, which we denote as `<a>`.\n2.  Elements of the form `aⁱx`: aⁱx, for i = 0, 1, ..., 63.\n\nThe order of the elements `aⁱ` is `64 / gcd(i, 64)`. The elements `aⁱx` all have an order of 4, which can be shown as follows:\n(aⁱx)² = aⁱ(xaⁱ)x = aⁱ(a⁻ⁱx)x = (aⁱa⁻ⁱ)x² = x² = a³²\n(aⁱx)⁴ = ((aⁱx)²)² = (a³²)² = a⁶⁴ = 1.\n\n### Definition of a Power Subgroup\n\nFor a group G, a power subgroup Gᵏ is the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in G. That is, Gᵏ = < gᵏ | g ∈ G >. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups of Q_128 that can be formed in this way.\n\n### Calculating the Power Subgroups of Q_128\n\nWe analyze the subgroups generated by the k-th powers of the elements of Q_128, distinguishing between cases where k is odd or even.\n\n#### Case 1: k is odd\n\nLet k be an odd integer. The k-th powers of the elements of Q_128 are:\n*   (aⁱ)ᵏ = aⁱᵏ. Since k is odd, `gcd(k, 64) = 1`. The subgroup generated by all elements `aⁱᵏ` is `<a>` itself, the cyclic subgroup of order 64.\n*   (aⁱx)ᵏ. Since k is odd, we can write k = 2m + 1 for some integer m.\n    (aⁱx)ᵏ = (aⁱx)²ᵐ⁺¹ = ((aⁱx)²)ᵐ(aⁱx) = (a³²)ᵐ(aⁱx) = a³²ᵐaⁱx.\n\nThe power subgroup (Q_128)ᵏ is generated by the set `{aⁱᵏ}` and `{a³²ᵐaʲx}` for all i, j from 0 to 63.\n*   The set `{aⁱᵏ}` generates `<a>`.\n*   Since `<a>` is part of the generated subgroup, we have `a` as a generator. From an element of the form `a³²ᵐaʲx`, we can obtain `x` by multiplying by `a⁻⁽³²ᵐ⁺ʲ⁾`.\nTherefore, when k is odd, the power subgroup (Q_128)ᵏ contains both `a` and `x` and thus is the entire group Q_128. This gives us one power subgroup.\n\n#### Case 2: k is even\n\nLet k be an even integer, so k = 2m for some integer m.\n*   (aⁱ)ᵏ = (aⁱ)²ᵐ = a²ⁱᵐ. The subgroup generated by these elements is `<a^gcd(2m, 64)>`.\n*   (aⁱx)ᵏ = (aⁱx)²ᵐ = ((aⁱx)²)ᵐ = (a³²)ᵐ = a³²ᵐ. This is a single element in the subgroup `<a>`.\n\nThe power subgroup (Q_128)ᵏ is generated by `<a^gcd(2m, 64)>` and `a³²ᵐ`. Since `32m` is a multiple of `gcd(2m, 64)`, the element `a³²ᵐ` is already in the subgroup `<a^gcd(2m, 64)>`.\nThus, for an even k=2m, the power subgroup is (Q_128)ᵏ = `<a^gcd(2m, 64)>`.\n\nThe possible values for `d = gcd(2m, 64)` are the even divisors of 64. The divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. The even divisors are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64.\nThis gives us the following distinct cyclic subgroups:\n1.  `<a²>` of order 32 (e.g., for k=2)\n2.  `<a⁴>` of order 16 (e.g., for k=4)\n3.  `<a⁸>` of order 8 (e.g., for k=8)\n4.  `<a¹⁶>` of order 4 (e.g., for k=16)\n5.  `<a³²>` of order 2 (e.g., for k=32)\n6.  `<a⁶⁴>` = `{1}`, the trivial subgroup, of order 1 (e.g., for k=64)\n\nThese are 6 distinct power subgroups.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining both cases, the set of all power subgroups of the generalized quaternion group of size 128 is:\n*   Q_128 (for any odd k)\n*   The six cyclic subgroups `<a²>`, `<a⁴>`, `<a⁸>`, `<a¹⁶>`, `<a³²>`, and `{1}` (for even k).\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 6 = 7 distinct power subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
