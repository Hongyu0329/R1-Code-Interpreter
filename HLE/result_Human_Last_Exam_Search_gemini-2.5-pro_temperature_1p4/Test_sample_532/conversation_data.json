    "The initial search has provided a definition for \"product-free sets\" but not for \"filled group\". The query for \"finite filled nilpotent groups\" did not return any direct results. The other search results provide general information about nilpotent groups, product-free sets, and unrelated concepts like \"Dehn filling\". Therefore, the next steps need to focus on finding the definition of a \"filled group\" and then connecting it to finite nilpotent groups.The second step has been very successful. I found a paper by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart titled \"Groups whose locally maximal product-free sets are complete\" which directly addresses the concept of \"filled groups\". The paper defines a filled group as a finite group where every locally maximal by inclusion product-free set is \"complete\" (meaning the set and its product set cover all non-identity elements of the group). The paper also explicitly classifies filled abelian groups and filled nilpotent groups.\n\nSpecifically, for abelian groups, they are filled if and only if they are C3, C5, or an elementary abelian 2-group. For nilpotent groups, the paper provides a classification. Therefore, I have sufficient information to answer the user's request.\n\nA finite group *G* is termed a **filled group** if all of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets cover all non-identity elements of the group when combined with their products. To be more precise, a non-empty subset *S* of a group *G* is called product-free if the product of any two elements in *S* (including an element with itself) is not in *S*. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. A group *G* is then defined as \"filled\" if for every maximal by inclusion product-free set *S*, the union of *S* and the set of its products *SS* contains all non-identity elements of *G*.\n\nThe classification of finite filled nilpotent groups has been established in the paper \"Groups whose locally maximal product-free sets are complete\" by C. S. Anabanti, G. Erskine, and S. B. Hart. According to their findings, a finite nilpotent group is a filled group if and only if it is one of the following:\n\n*   An elementary abelian 2-group.\n*   The cyclic group of order 3, denoted as C_3.\n*   The cyclic group of order 5, denoted as C_5.\n*   The quaternion group of order 8, denoted as Q_8.\n\nTo elaborate, elementary abelian 2-groups are groups where every non-identity element has order 2. The cyclic groups C_3 and C_5 are the groups of integers modulo 3 and 5 under addition, respectively. The quaternion group Q_8 is a specific non-abelian group of order 8.\n\nThe study of filled groups was initiated by Street and Whitehead, who also classified the filled abelian groups, identifying them as C_3, C_5, or an elementary abelian 2-group. The work by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart extended this classification to other types of groups, including the nilpotent ones. It's noteworthy that if a group *G* is filled, then any of its quotient groups G/N (where N is a normal subgroup) must also be filled. This property is a key tool in the classification of filled groups.\n\n<<<A finite nilpotent group is a filled group if and only if it is an elementary abelian 2-group, the cyclic group of order 3, the cyclic group of order 5, or the quaternion group of order 8.>>>"
