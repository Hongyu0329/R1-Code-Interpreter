Based on the available evidence, it is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 will exhibit an enhanced and more polyfunctional cytokine release profile, characterized by increased secretion of key pro-inflammatory cytokines like IFN-γ and TNF-α upon antigen stimulation, compared to CAR T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This is attributed to IL-15's role in promoting a less differentiated and more functionally robust T cell phenotype.
