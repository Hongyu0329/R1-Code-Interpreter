    "The search results are about packing puzzles in general and do not specifically address the problem of packing 9x1x1 blocks into a 15x15x15 cube. The search results discuss related concepts like volume calculations and coloring proofs for impossibility, but none provide a direct answer or a better method for this specific problem.\n\nMy initial reasoning seems to be the most logical approach. I'll re-state it to be sure.\n\n1.  **Initial Packing**: Fill a 9x15x15 section of the cube. This is done by aligning the 9-unit length of the blocks with one of the 15-unit edges of the cube.\n    *   Number of blocks: `floor(15/9) * floor(15/1) * floor(15/1) = 1 * 15 * 15 = 225` blocks.\n    *   This leaves a remaining space of (15-9)x15x15, which is 6x15x15.\n\n2.  **Second Packing**: Fill the 6x15x15 void. The 9-unit length of the blocks can't fit in the 6-unit dimension. So, it must be aligned with one of the 15-unit dimensions.\n    *   Number of blocks: `floor(6/1) * floor(15/9) * floor(15/1) = 6 * 1 * 15 = 90` blocks.\n    *   This occupies a 6x9x15 section of the 6x15x15 void.\n    *   The remaining space is now 6x(15-9)x15, which is 6x6x15.\n\n3.  **Third Packing**: Fill the 6x6x15 void. Again, the 9-unit length must be aligned with the 15-unit dimension.\n    *   Number of blocks: `floor(6/1) * floor(6/1) * floor(15/9) = 6 * 6 * 1 = 36` blocks.\n    *   This occupies a 6x6x9 section of the 6x6x15 void.\n    *   The final remaining space is 6x6x(15-9), which is 6x6x6.\n\n4.  **Final Check**: A 9x1x1 block cannot fit into a 6x6x6 cube since its longest side (9) is greater than any dimension of the remaining space.\n\n5.  **Total**: The total number of blocks is the sum from the three packing stages: `225 + 90 + 36 = 351`.\n\nThe total volume of 351 blocks is `351 * 9 = 3159`.\nThe volume of the cube is `15 * 15 * 15 = 3375`.\nThe wasted space is `3375 - 3159 = 216`, which is exactly the volume of the 6x6x6 cube that is left over.\n\nThis method accounts for all the space and seems optimal because the leftover space is consolidated into a single volume where no more blocks can fit. Any other packing method would need to be more efficient and leave less than 216 cubic units of wasted space. This seems unlikely given the constraints.\n\nI am confident in my calculated answer.\n\n<<<351>>>"
