    "Hypothetically, a perfluoronanocar would contain 274 fluorine atoms.\n\nThis is based on the chemical formula of the original nanocar, which is C430H274O12. The process of perfluorination involves replacing all the hydrogen (H) atoms in a molecule with fluorine (F) atoms. Therefore, the 274 hydrogen atoms in a standard nanocar would be substituted with 274 fluorine atoms.\n\nIt is worth noting that various designs for nanocars exist. For instance, a nanocar designed for the Nanocar Race has the chemical formula C85H59N5Zn. A perfluorinated version of this particular nanocar would contain 59 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<274>>>"
