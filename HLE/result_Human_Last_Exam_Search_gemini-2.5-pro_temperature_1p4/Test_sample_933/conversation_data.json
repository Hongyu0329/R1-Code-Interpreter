    "The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is most commonly achieved through the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gas at elevated temperatures in a nickel vessel. The nickel container is used because it forms a protective layer of nickel(II) fluoride, preventing corrosion from the highly reactive fluorine gas.\n\nThe efficiency and outcome of the synthesis are highly dependent on the reaction temperature. While the reaction can begin at temperatures as low as 120°C, the most frequently cited and optimal temperature for an efficient production of XeF₄ is 400°C. A US patent for the process specifies a temperature range of 350°C to 450°C, with 400°C being the preferred temperature for a quantitative reaction. Using flow methods, a temperature range of 300-500°C has been utilized, though this can lead to contamination with Xenon difluoride (XeF₂).\n\nTemperatures significantly higher than 400°C tend to favor the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆). Conversely, lower temperatures may result in incomplete reactions or the formation of XeF₂. For instance, methods to produce XeF₂ sometimes involve trapping the product at very low temperatures, such as -78°C, to prevent further fluorination to XeF₄.\n\nConsidering the provided choices, 400°C is the coldest temperature listed that is consistently referenced for the *efficient* synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride.\n\n<<<B>>>"
