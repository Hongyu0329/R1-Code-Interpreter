    "The value for a(3), which represents the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 6 (three-loop) for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics, is not the same for both.\n\nFor the electron propagator (self-energy), the number of non-vanishing diagrams at three loops is 10. This is often the more cited number in literature concerning high-order corrections in QED.\n\nFor the photon propagator (vacuum polarization), the number of non-vanishing diagrams at three loops is 5.\n\nGiven that for the lower orders of 2 (n=1) and 4 (n=2), the number of diagrams is the same for both propagators (1 and 2, respectively), the question implies a single answer for order 6 as well. This ambiguity suggests a possible flaw in the question's premise. However, assuming the question refers to the more commonly studied electron propagator, the answer would be 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
