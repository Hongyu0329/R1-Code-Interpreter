    "The closest province to the Waskaganish gathering place outside of Quebec is **Ontario**. The closest territory is **Nunavut**.\n\nThe Waskaganish gathering place is located in the Cree community of Waskaganish in the Nord-du-Qu√©bec region of Quebec, on the southeastern shore of James Bay. The traditional Cree territory, known as \"Eeyou Istchee,\" extends from Northern Quebec into Ontario, highlighting the proximity of the two provinces.\n\nBy examining maps of the region, it is clear that the Ontario border lies directly to the west of Waskaganish, across James Bay. The territory of Nunavut is situated to the north of Quebec, with several islands in James Bay, such as Akimiski Island, being part of the Nunavut territory and in close proximity to Waskaganish.\n\n<<<Ontario and Nunavut>>>"
