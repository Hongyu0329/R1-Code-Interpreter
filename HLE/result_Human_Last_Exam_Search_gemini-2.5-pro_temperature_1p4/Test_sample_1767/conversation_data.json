    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the resulting junction is 2.\n\nA Chern insulator is a two-dimensional material characterized by a topological invariant known as the Chern number (C), which is an integer. This number determines the quantized Hall conductance of the material. For a composite system formed by two weakly coupled Chern insulators, the total Chern number is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual components. The condition of a \"negligible tunneling barrier\" implies that the two insulators are in close contact but their bulk electronic structures are largely independent, allowing their topological properties to be combined additively.\n\nIn this specific case, since each Chern insulator has a Chern number of 1 (C1 = 1 and C2 = 1), the total Chern number of the combined system, or the junction, is:\n\nC_total = C1 + C2 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nIt is important to note that while the Chern number of the entire system is the sum, the number of topologically protected conducting channels, or chiral edge states, at the interface between the two insulators is given by the *difference* of their Chern numbers: |C1 - C2|. In this scenario, there would be |1 - 1| = 0 chiral edge states at the interface. The two chiral edge states corresponding to the C_total = 2 of the combined system would exist at the outer edges of the entire junction.\n\n<<<2>>>"
