    "In the empty space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body of mass M, the geometry of spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. The Christoffel symbols, which represent the gravitational field in general relativity, are derived from this metric.\n\nFor the Schwarzschild metric in standard spherical coordinates (t, r, θ, φ), there are 9 distinct non-zero Christoffel symbols. These symbols are symmetric in their lower two indices (e.g., Γ<sup>ρ</sup><sub>μν</sub> = Γ<sup>ρ</sup><sub>νμ</sub>). The non-zero components are:\n\n*   Γ<sup>r</sup><sub>tt</sub>\n*   Γ<sup>r</sup><sub>rr</sub>\n*   Γ<sup>r</sup><sub>θθ</sub>\n*   Γ<sup>r</sup><sub>φφ</sub>\n*   Γ<sup>t</sup><sub>rt</sub> (which is equal to Γ<sup>t</sup><sub>tr</sub>)\n*   Γ<sup>θ</sup><sub>rθ</sub> (which is equal to Γ<sup>θ</sup><sub>θr</sub>)\n*   Γ<sup>θ</sup><sub>φφ</sub>\n*   Γ<sup>φ</sup><sub>rφ</sub> (which is equal to Γ<sup>φ</sup><sub>φr</sub>)\n*   Γ<sup>φ</sup><sub>θφ</sub> (which is equal to Γ<sup>φ</sup><sub>φθ</sub>)\n\nCounting each unique non-zero component once, we arrive at a total of 9. If we were to count every non-zero entry of the Γ<sup>ρ</sup><sub>μν</sub> array, considering the symmetries, the number would be 13 (five symbols with identical lower indices and four pairs of symbols with different lower indices). However, standardly, the number of non-zero components refers to the number of unique non-zero functions.\n\n<<<9>>>"
