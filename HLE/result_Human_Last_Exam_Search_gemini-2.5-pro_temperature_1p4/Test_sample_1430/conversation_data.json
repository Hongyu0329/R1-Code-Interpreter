    "### Smallest and Largest Rank of the Néron-Severi Group of X\n\nLet C be a genus 3 Riemann surface and X be its 15th symmetric power, denoted as Sym^15(C). The rank of the Néron-Severi group, also known as the Picard number ρ(X), can vary depending on the specific properties of the curve C.\n\nThe variety X = Sym^15(C) is a smooth projective variety of dimension 15. For a curve C of genus g=3, any symmetric power Sym^d(C) with d > 2g-2 = 4 is a projective bundle over the Jacobian variety of the curve, Jac(C). In this case, d=15, so X = Sym^15(C) is a P^12-bundle over the 3-dimensional abelian variety Jac(C).\n\nThis fibration structure allows for the determination of the Picard number of X in terms of the Picard number of the Jacobian of C. The relationship is given by:\n\nρ(X) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1\n\nThis reduces the problem to finding the minimum and maximum possible values for the Picard number of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n#### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nFor a generic curve C of genus g, its Jacobian variety Jac(C) is a simple abelian variety with the ring of endomorphisms being just the integers, Z. In this case, the Néron-Severi group of Jac(C) is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor), which means its rank is 1. Therefore, the smallest possible Picard number for the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve is:\n\nρ_min(Jac(C)) = 1\n\nThis leads to the smallest possible rank for NS(X):\n\nρ_min(X) = ρ_min(Jac(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n#### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe Picard number of a g-dimensional abelian variety A is bounded by the Hodge number h^1,1(A), which is equal to g^2. For the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, this upper bound is 3^2 = 9. This maximum is achieved for special curves that have complex multiplication (CM), meaning their Jacobian has a large ring of endomorphisms.\n\nAn example of such a curve is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation x⁴ + y⁴ = z⁴ in the projective plane. This is a smooth curve of genus 3. It is a well-known result that the Jacobian of the Fermat quartic is isogenous to the cube of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers Z[i]. For such an abelian variety, the Picard number reaches its maximum possible value.\n\nρ_max(Jac(C)) = 9\n\nThis gives the largest possible rank for NS(X):\n\nρ_max(X) = ρ_max(Jac(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10\n\nThus, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of X can range from 2 to 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
