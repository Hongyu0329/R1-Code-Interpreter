    "This problem describes the \"ambiguous case\" for the Law of Sines in trigonometry. In a triangle $A B C$ with given side lengths $AC$ and $BC$ and an angle $\\angle B$, there can be zero, one, or two possible triangles. For two possible triangles (and therefore two possible lengths for side $AB$) to exist, specific conditions must be met.\n\nLet the lengths of the sides be $a, b, c$ opposite to vertices $A, B, C$ respectively. We are given:\n*   $a = BC = S$\n*   $\\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$\n*   We are looking for the number of integer values of $b = AC$.\n\nFor there to be two possible values for side $c = AB$, the length of side $b$ must be greater than the triangle's altitude from vertex $C$ to side $AB$, but shorter than the length of side $a$.\n\nThe altitude $h$ from vertex $C$ can be calculated as $h = a \\sin(B)$.\nGiven $a = S$ and $\\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$, we have:\n$h = S \\cdot \\sin(30^{\\circ})$\nSince $\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 0.5$, the altitude is $h = 0.5S = \\frac{S}{2}$.\n\nThe condition for two possible triangles is $h < b < a$.\nSubstituting the known values, we get:\n$\\frac{S}{2} < AC < S$\n\nThe problem uses the placeholder $S = SNYWR$. Without a specific numerical value for S from the context of a competition or puzzle, a common interpretation is to assign numerical values to the letters (A=1, B=2, etc.) and sum them up.\nS = 19\nN = 14\nY = 25\nW = 23\nR = 18\n\nSumming these values:\n$S = 19 + 14 + 25 + 23 + 18 = 99$.\n\nNow, we substitute $S=99$ into our inequality:\n$\\frac{99}{2} < AC < 99$\n$49.5 < AC < 99$\n\nWe need to find the number of possible *integer* values for the length of side $AC$. The integers in this range are $50, 51, 52, \\dots, 98$.\n\nTo count the number of integers in this inclusive range, we can use the formula: Last - First + 1.\nNumber of values = $98 - 50 + 1 = 49$.\n\nThere are 49 possible integer values for the length of side $AC$.\n\n<<<49>>>"
