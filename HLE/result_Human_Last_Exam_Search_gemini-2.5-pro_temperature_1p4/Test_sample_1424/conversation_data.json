    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, describes the propagation of a single particle in a system without interactions. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is fundamental to understanding the behavior of non-interacting systems and serves as a starting point for perturbative treatments of interacting systems.\n\nThe bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space (often represented as G₀(k, ω)) is directly expressed in terms of the single-particle energy eigenvalues. For a system of non-interacting fermions, the bare Green's function takes the following form:\n\n<center>G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ sgn(ϵ_k - μ))</center>\n\nWhere:\n\n*   **G₀(k, ω)** is the bare Green's function for a particle with momentum **k** and frequency **ω**.\n*   **ϵ_k** represents the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a given momentum **k**.\n*   **μ** is the chemical potential, which sets the energy level of the Fermi surface.\n*   **δ** is an infinitesimal positive quantity that ensures proper causal behavior of the Green's function. It shifts the poles of the Green's function slightly off the real axis in the complex frequency plane.\n*   **sgn** is the signum function, which is +1 for positive arguments and -1 for negative arguments.\n\nThe denominator of this expression, `ω - ϵ_k`, clearly illustrates the direct functional dependence. The poles of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane occur at `ω = ϵ_k`. Physically, these poles correspond to the energies of the single-particle excitations of the non-interacting system. The term `iδ sgn(ϵ_k - μ)` dictates the location of the pole in the complex plane, determining whether it represents a particle (electron) or a hole excitation.\n\nIn a more general matrix form, especially when dealing with a basis that is not necessarily the momentum eigenbasis, the bare Green's function can be written as a matrix that is diagonal in the basis of the single-particle Hamiltonian, H₀. If the eigenvalues of H₀ are ϵᵢ, the matrix elements of the bare Green's function in frequency space are given by:\n\n<center>G₀,ij(ω) = δ_ij / (ω - ϵ_i)</center>\n\nHere, δ_ij is the Kronecker delta, which is 1 if i = j and 0 otherwise. This form explicitly shows that the bare Green's function is diagonal in the energy eigenbasis, with each diagonal element being inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency ω and the corresponding single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵᵢ.\n\nTherefore, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G₀ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k is characterized by an inverse relationship in the frequency domain, with the poles of G₀ corresponding directly to the energy eigenvalues of the non-interacting single-particle states.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function (G₀) in frequency (ω) and momentum (k) space depends on the single-particle energy eigenvalues (ϵ_k) as an inverse function. Specifically, it is given by the formula G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ sgn(ϵ_k - μ)), where μ is the chemical potential and δ is a positive infinitesimal. The poles of the bare Green's function directly correspond to the single-particle energy eigenvalues. In a matrix representation, the bare Green's function is diagonal in the energy eigenbasis, with the diagonal elements being (ω - ϵ_i)⁻¹, where ϵ_i are the energy eigenvalues.>>>"
