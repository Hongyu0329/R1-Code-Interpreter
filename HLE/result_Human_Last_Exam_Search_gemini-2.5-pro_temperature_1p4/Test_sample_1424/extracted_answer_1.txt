In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function (G₀) in frequency (ω) and momentum (k) space depends on the single-particle energy eigenvalues (ϵ_k) as an inverse function. Specifically, it is given by the formula G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ sgn(ϵ_k - μ)), where μ is the chemical potential and δ is a positive infinitesimal. The poles of the bare Green's function directly correspond to the single-particle energy eigenvalues. In a matrix representation, the bare Green's function is diagonal in the energy eigenbasis, with the diagonal elements being (ω - ϵ_i)⁻¹, where ϵ_i are the energy eigenvalues.
