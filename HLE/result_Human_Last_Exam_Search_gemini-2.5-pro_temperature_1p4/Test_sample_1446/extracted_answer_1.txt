The value of the critical exponent ν is not a single number but depends on the dimensionality of the system (d) and the symmetry of the order parameter (N). For the commonly studied φ⁴-theory, which is likely what is being referred to, the value of ν is 1/2 for d≥4. In d=3, ν ≈ 0.630 for the Ising universality class (N=1). In d=2, ν=1 for the Ising universality class.
