    "The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone is ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate.\n\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity is a metric that quantifies the complexity of a molecule based on information theory. It is calculated by summing the information content of the chemical microenvironment of every atom in the molecule, taking into account factors like stereochemistry, unsaturated bonds, branching, and symmetry. The final value is given in 'mcbit' (molecular bit).\n\nThe exact calculation of the Böttcher score is complex and typically requires specialized software, such as the BöttchScore calculator developed by the Forli lab, to ensure accuracy, especially concerning the correction for molecular symmetry. While the formula is publicly available, a manual calculation is prone to error and difficult without the specific parameters and algorithms used in the software.\n\nDue to the inability to use the required computational tools, a precise numerical value for the Böttcher Molecular Complexity of ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate cannot be provided at this time.\n\n<<<ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate>>>"
