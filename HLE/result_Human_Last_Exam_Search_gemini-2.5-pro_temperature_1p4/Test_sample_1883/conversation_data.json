    "Under thermal conditions, the electrocyclic reaction of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is governed by the principles of Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, which form the basis for the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\n### Analysis using Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory\n\n1.  **Electron System and Reaction Type**: The reactant, \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, is a conjugated polyene with four double bonds. This constitutes an 8π-electron system. The reaction is a thermally induced electrocyclic ring closure. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, for a system with 4n π-electrons (where n=2 in this case), the reaction proceeds through a **conrotatory** motion under thermal conditions. This is because the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) for an 8π system (ψ₄) possesses a C₂ symmetry axis, where the terminal p-orbitals must rotate in the same direction (conrotation) to achieve a bonding overlap.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry of the Reactant**: The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the geometry of the terminal double bonds of the conjugated system. In \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, the reacting termini are at C2 and C9.\n    *   The double bond at C2 is **Z** (`cis`).\n    *   The double bond at C8 is **E** (`trans`).\n\n3.  **Predicting the Allowed Product**: For a 4n π-electron system undergoing a thermal conrotatory ring closure, the stereochemical outcome can be predicted. A (Z,E)-configured reactant will stereospecifically yield the *cis*-disubstituted product. Therefore, the symmetry-allowed product is the **cis-isomer A**.\n\n4.  **Formation of the Forbidden Product**: The problem states that the *trans*-isomer B is also formed. For the (Z,E)-configured starting material, the formation of the *trans*-isomer would require a **disrotatory** ring closure. According to FMO theory, this pathway is \"symmetry-forbidden\" under thermal conditions. A disrotatory closure would involve an anti-bonding interaction in the transition state as the lobes of the HOMO of opposite phases are forced together, leading to a significantly higher activation energy barrier compared to the allowed conrotatory pathway.\n\n5.  **Predicting the Ratio of A and B**: The ratio of the products A and B is determined by the relative activation energies of the pathways leading to them.\n    *   **Isomer A (cis)** is formed via the low-energy, symmetry-allowed conrotatory pathway.\n    *   **Isomer B (trans)** is formed via the high-energy, symmetry-forbidden disrotatory pathway.\n\nBecause the activation energy for the allowed pathway is much lower than for the forbidden one, the rate of formation of isomer A will be vastly greater than the rate of formation of isomer B.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrontier Molecular Orbital theory predicts that the thermal electrocyclization of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene will overwhelmingly favor the formation of the *cis*-isomer A through a conrotatory mechanism. The formation of the *trans*-isomer B is a symmetry-forbidden process with a much higher activation barrier. Consequently, the ratio of A to B will be very large, with the *cis*-isomer A being the vastly predominant product.\n\n<<<The ratio of A to B will be significantly greater than 1, heavily favoring the formation of the *cis*-isomer A.>>>"
