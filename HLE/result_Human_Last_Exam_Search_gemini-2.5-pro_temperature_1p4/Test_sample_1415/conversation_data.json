    "To evaluate the integral `V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1, we can recognize that the integrand `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is the derivative of `ln(F₃(x))`.\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral is the difference in the antiderivative evaluated at the limits of integration.\nThe antiderivative of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\nFirst, let's define the function `F₃(x)`:\n*   `F₀(x) = x`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\nThe value of the integral `V` is given by:\n`V = [ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\nWe need to determine if `F₃(x)` is positive on the interval to remove the absolute value.\nFor `x` in `[0, 1]`, `sin(x)` is between `sin(0) = 0` and `sin(1) ≈ 0.841`.\n`e^(sin(x))` is therefore between `e^0 = 1` and `e^(sin(1)) ≈ 2.32`.\nSo, `1 + e^(sin(x))` is always greater than 2.\n`F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` is always greater than `ln(2)`.\nSince `ln(2)` is positive, `F₃(x)` is always positive on the interval `[0, 1]`. Thus, we can remove the absolute value.\n`V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\n\nNext, we calculate `F₃(0)` and `F₃(1)`:\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e^0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\nNow, substitute these into the expression for `V`:\n`V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n\nTo find the final answer, we compute the numerical value of `V` (using 1 radian for the argument of sine):\n*   `sin(1) ≈ 0.84147098`\n*   `e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.84147098 ≈ 2.31972243`\n*   `ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(1 + 2.31972243) = ln(3.31972243) ≈ 1.19989529`\n*   `ln(2) ≈ 0.69314718`\n*   `V ≈ ln(1.19989529) - ln(0.69314718)`\n*   `V ≈ 0.18223403 - (-0.36651292)`\n*   `V ≈ 0.54874695`\n\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`:\n`10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.54874695 = 5487.4695`\n\nThe closest integer to 5487.4695 is 5487.\n\n<<<5487>>>"
