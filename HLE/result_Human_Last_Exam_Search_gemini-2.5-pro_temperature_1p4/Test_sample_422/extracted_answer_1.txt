Assuming the JTB definition of Knowledge ("Knowledge is a Justified True Belief") and a world with only two epistemic states (Knowledge and Belief), and ignoring Gettier problems, the two primary issues are the ambiguity and potentially impossible standards of the "Justification" condition, and the conceptually incoherent relationship between "Belief" and "Knowledge" where belief is simultaneously a standalone state and a necessary component of the other.
