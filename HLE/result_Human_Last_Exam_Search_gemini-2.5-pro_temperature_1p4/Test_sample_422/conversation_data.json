    "If our only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief, and we are working with the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge, two significant problems arise, independent of Gettier-style counterexamples. These problems concern the nature of the \"justification\" and \"belief\" conditions themselves.\n\nThe two main problems are:\n\n1.  **The Problem of Defining \"Justification\":** The JTB account does not specify what counts as an adequate justification. There is significant philosophical disagreement on this point. For a justification to be strong enough to elevate a true belief to the status of knowledge, it might need to be infallible or guarantee the truth of the proposition. This sets a standard that is arguably impossible for human beings to meet in most situations, as our cognitive and perceptual faculties are fallible. Consequently, if justification must be this strong, knowledge becomes almost unattainable. If the standard is lower, it is not clear what level is sufficient. This vagueness and potentially impossibly high standard for justification poses a major problem for the JTB theory's practical application.\n\n2.  **The Problem of the Relationship Between Belief and Knowledge:** Given a system with only two epistemic states—Knowledge and Belief—the JTB definition creates a conceptual difficulty. According to the definition, knowledge is a type of belief (it is a *justified true* belief). This means that knowledge is a subset of belief. However, the premise states that Knowledge and Belief are the only two *available* epistemic states, suggesting they are distinct categories. This leads to a conflict: if you have knowledge, you necessarily have a belief. But if the states are mutually exclusive, one cannot have both. The framework becomes incoherent because it presents \"Belief\" as both a standalone category and a necessary component of the supposedly separate category of \"Knowledge.\"\n\n<<<Assuming the JTB definition of Knowledge (\"Knowledge is a Justified True Belief\") and a world with only two epistemic states (Knowledge and Belief), and ignoring Gettier problems, the two primary issues are the ambiguity and potentially impossible standards of the \"Justification\" condition, and the conceptually incoherent relationship between \"Belief\" and \"Knowledge\" where belief is simultaneously a standalone state and a necessary component of the other.>>>"
