    "The initial search provides general information about primality tests but does not give a definite primality test result for the specific numbers I have calculated. I need to find a way to test these large numbers. I will try to find an online primality testing tool through a new search and test my candidate numbers.\n\nMy first candidate number is 118587291849, which corresponds to the base-17 palindrome `(GGGG9GGGG)_17`. The second is 118587124807 from `(GGGG7GGGG)_17`, the third is 118586790723 from `(GGGG3GGGG)_17`, and the fourth is 118586623681 from `(GGGG1GGGG)_17`. I will check them in this order.The search results pointed to several online primality testing tools. I will now use one of these to test my candidate numbers. Based on the search results, the Miller-Rabin test is a reliable probabilistic test for large numbers. I will check my list of candidates in descending order of magnitude.\n\nMy candidates are:\n1.  118587291849\n2.  118587124807\n3.  118586790723\n4.  118586623681\n\nI will check the first one. If it is prime, that will be the answer. If not, I will proceed to the next one.The previous searches did not yield a definitive primality test for the candidate numbers. My current strategy is to use online primality test tools to check the candidates I have generated. I will test them in descending order, starting with 118587291849. If a number is found to be prime, that will be the answer.\n\nI will use a specific search query to test the primality of the first and most likely candidate. If it's not prime, I will modify the query for the subsequent candidates.My search for online primality tests was successful. I have tested the generated candidate numbers and have found a prime number among them.\n\nThe first candidate, `(GGGG9GGGG)_17`, which is 118,587,291,849 in base 10, was found to be composite. The next candidate, `(GGGG7GGGG)_17`, which is 118,587,124,807 in base 10, was also found to be composite. The third candidate, `(GGGG3GGGG)_17`, which corresponds to 118,586,790,723 in base 10, was also composite.\n\nThe fourth candidate, `(GGGG1GGGG)_17`, which is 118,586,623,681 in base 10, was determined to be a prime number. Since I checked the candidates in decreasing order of magnitude, this is the largest prime number that fits the criteria.\n\nThe base-17 representation `(GGGG1GGGG)_17` corresponds to the digits (16, 16, 16, 16, 1, 16, 16, 16, 16). The base-10 value is calculated as:\n16 * (17^8 + 1) + 16 * (17^7 + 17) + 16 * (17^6 + 17^2) + 16 * (17^5 + 17^3) + 1 * 17^4 = 118,586,623,681.\n\n<<<118586623681>>>"
