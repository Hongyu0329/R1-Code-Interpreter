    "In the path integral formalism for fermionic systems, the Pauli exclusion principle is encoded through the use of anti-commuting Grassmann variables, `η`. The defining feature of these variables is that they anti-commute, `η_i η_j = -η_j η_i`, which directly leads to the property `η² = 0` for any single Grassmann variable. This algebraic rule is the mathematical manifestation of the Pauli exclusion principle, as it prevents two identical fermions from occupying the same state.\n\nThe integration over these variables is known as the Berezin integral, and the integration measure, `dη`, is not defined by a numerical value in the standard sense but by a set of formal rules. These rules are chosen to be consistent with the anti-commuting algebra. For a single Grassmann variable `η`, the value and normalization of the measure are defined by the following two fundamental equations, known as the Berezin rules:\n\n1.  ∫ dη 1 = 0\n2.  ∫ dη η = 1\n\nThese two rules uniquely define the process of integration. For a general function of a single Grassmann variable, which can always be written as `f(η) = A + Bη` (since `η² = 0`), the integral becomes:\n\n∫ dη f(η) = ∫ dη (A + Bη) = A ∫ dη 1 + B ∫ dη η = B.\n\nTherefore, the integral acts to extract the coefficient of `η`. This framework ensures that the path integral correctly implements the anti-symmetrization and the exclusion principle required for fermionic systems.\n\n<<<The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is defined by the rules: the integral of a constant is 0, and the integral of the Grassmann variable itself is 1.>>>"
