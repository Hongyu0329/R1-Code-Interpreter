    "Here are the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of the light quanta, derived using the principles of large deviation theory.\n\n### Conceptual Framework: Large Deviation Theory and Statistical Mechanics\n\nThe equilibrium state of a statistical mechanical system, such as a photon gas, corresponds to the most probable macroscopic state. Large deviation theory provides a mathematical framework to understand the probability of fluctuations away from this typical behavior. The core idea is that such fluctuations are exponentially rare.\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem**: This theorem states that the probability of an empirical distribution of a sequence of random variables deviating from its true underlying distribution is exponentially small. The rate of this decay is given by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, or relative entropy. In statistical mechanics, maximizing the Boltzmann entropy (`S = k_B ln W`) is equivalent to minimizing this rate function. The equilibrium macrostate is the one with the overwhelmingly largest number of corresponding microstates (`W`), and therefore the highest entropy. This is the \"least unlikely\" rare event, which in the limit of a large number of particles becomes the typical observed state.\n\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem**: This theorem is a specific case of the large deviation principle that applies to the empirical mean of a set of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. It formalizes the idea that the probability of the sample mean being far from the true mean decays exponentially. Finding the equilibrium energy of a photon gas is equivalent to finding the most probable value for the mean energy, which minimizes the corresponding rate function.\n\nFor a photon gas (the Bose case of light quanta), these principles are applied to find the equilibrium distribution of photons over various energy levels. A crucial characteristic of a photon gas in equilibrium is that the number of photons is not conserved due to absorption and emission processes with the surrounding matter. This leads to a chemical potential of zero for the photons at equilibrium.\n\n### Derivation of Equilibrium Distribution\n\nThe equilibrium state is found by maximizing the entropy `S` subject to the constraint of a fixed total mean energy `E`. For bosons like photons, the entropy of a macrostate defined by `n_i` photons in `g_i` states at energy level `ε_i` is given by:\n\n`S = k_B * ln(W) = k_B * ln [ Π_i (n_i + g_i - 1)! / (n_i! * (g_i - 1)!) ]`\n\nUsing the Lagrange multiplier method to maximize `S` under the constraint `Σ n_i * ε_i = E` (with the multiplier `β = 1/(k_B*T)`) and dropping the particle number constraint (equivalent to zero chemical potential), one arrives at the most probable distribution for the average number of photons `<n_i>` at energy `ε_i`. This is the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons, also known as the Planck distribution.\n\n`<n(ε)> = 1 / (e^(βε) - 1) = 1 / (e^(ε/k_B*T) - 1)`\n\n### Equilibrium Mean Energy\n\nThe total mean energy (or internal energy), `E`, of the photon gas is found by integrating the energy of each photon state multiplied by the average number of photons in that state and the density of states `g(ε)`. For a photon gas in a volume `V`, the density of states (including two polarization states) is:\n\n`g(ε) dε = (8πV / (h^3 * c^3)) * ε^2 dε`\n\nwhere `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe total mean energy is then the integral:\n\n`E = ∫₀^∞ ε * <n(ε)> * g(ε) dε = ∫₀^∞ ε * [ 1 / (e^(ε/k_B*T) - 1) ] * [ (8πV / (h^3*c^3)) * ε^2 ] dε`\n\nSolving this integral yields:\n\n`E = (8π⁵k_B⁴ / (15h³c³)) * V * T⁴`\n\nThis shows that the mean energy of the photon gas is proportional to the volume and the fourth power of the absolute temperature, which is a statement of the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\n### Equilibrium Entropy\n\nThe entropy of the photon gas at equilibrium can be calculated using the fundamental thermodynamic relation `S = (E - F)/T`, where `F` is the Helmholtz Free Energy. For a photon gas, `F = -E/3`. Substituting this gives:\n\n`S = (E - (-E/3)) / T = (4E) / (3T)`\n\nBy substituting the expression for the equilibrium mean energy `E`, we obtain the equilibrium entropy:\n\n`S = (4 / 3T) * [ (8π⁵k_B⁴ / (15h³c³)) * V * T⁴ ]`\n\n`S = (32π⁵k_B⁴ / (45h³c³)) * V * T³`\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium entropy of the photon gas is proportional to the volume and the third power of the absolute temperature.\n\n<<<\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (E):**\n\n`E = (8π⁵k_B⁴ / (15h³c³)) * V * T⁴`\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\n\n`S = (32π⁵k_B⁴ / (45h³c³)) * V * T³`\n>>>"
