    "The Szeged/Wiener index ratio for the major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide, which is perylene-3-thiol (C20H12S), cannot be provided.\n\nThe calculation of the Wiener and Szeged topological indices, particularly with the inclusion of all hydrogen atoms as specified, is a complex computational task that requires specialized software. While the identity of the molecule is clear, and the definitions of the indices are well-established, the specific numerical values for perylene-3-thiol including hydrogens are not available in published literature or public databases found through extensive searching.\n\nThe calculation for a molecule with 33 atoms (20 carbon, 12 hydrogen, 1 sulfur) is not feasible to perform manually. It requires a computational approach using chemical informatics tools that can handle large, polycyclic graphs and have the specific functionality to include hydrogen atoms in the distance calculations for these indices. Without access to such computational tools to perform the novel calculation, a numerical answer cannot be determined.\n\n<<<An answer could not be determined based on the available information.>>>"
