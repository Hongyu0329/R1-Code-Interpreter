    "To find the central pixel of a line drawn between (1,1) and (11,5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, one must first determine all the pixels that constitute the line.\n\nBresenham's algorithm is a method for drawing lines on a raster display, determining which pixels should be illuminated to create a close approximation of a straight line. For the given line segment, the algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\nFirst, calculate the change in x and y:\n*   Δx = 11 - 1 = 10\n*   Δy = 5 - 1 = 4\n\nThe initial decision parameter is calculated as p = 2 * Δy - Δx, which is -2.\n\nStarting from the point (1,1), the algorithm iterates, incrementing the x-coordinate at each step and deciding whether to increment the y-coordinate based on the decision parameter.\n\nThe sequence of pixels generated by the algorithm is:\n(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 5), (10, 5), (11, 5)\n\nThere are 11 pixels in total that form the line. To find the central pixel, we locate the middle point in this sequence. With 11 pixels, the central one is the 6th pixel.\n\nCounting through the generated pixel coordinates, the 6th pixel is (6, 3).\n\n<<<**(6, 3)**>>>"
