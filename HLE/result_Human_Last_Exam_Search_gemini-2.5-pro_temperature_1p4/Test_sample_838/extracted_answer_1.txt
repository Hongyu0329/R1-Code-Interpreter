The final product, C, is **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**.

**IUPAC Name:** 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane

**Chirality:** To determine if the molecule is chiral, we must check for chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).

The structure is:
`Br-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-Ph`

*   **C1:** Bonded to Br, two H atoms, and a -CH₂- group. Not chiral.
*   **C2:** Bonded to two H atoms and two different alkyl groups. Not chiral.
*   **C3:** Bonded to two H atoms and two different alkyl groups. Not chiral.
*   **C4:** Bonded to two H atoms, a -CH₂- group, and a phenyl group. Not chiral.

Since there are no chiral centers in the molecule, the final product, **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, is achiral**. The initial chirality of the starting material was lost in the first elimination step.
