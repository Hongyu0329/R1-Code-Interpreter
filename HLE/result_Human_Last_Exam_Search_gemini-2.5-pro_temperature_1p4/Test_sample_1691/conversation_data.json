    "An analytical formula that approximates the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ for the small $\\epsilon$ regime is developed as follows.\n\nLet the integral be $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + h(x)} dx$, where $h(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$. For small positive $\\epsilon$, the value of the integrand is largest when the denominator is smallest. This occurs for values of $x$ close to 0, since $h(0) = 0$. This means that the dominant contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$.\n\nFor small $x$, we can approximate $h(x)$ by its leading term, $h(x) \\approx 9x^5$. To obtain a more accurate approximation, we can develop an asymptotic expansion for the integral. This can be achieved by changing the variable of integration from $x$ to $u=h(x)$.\nFor $u = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$, we can express $x$ as a power series in $u$ for small $u$ (and hence small $x$). By inverting the series, we find the first two terms:\n$x(u) \\approx 9^{-1/5}u^{1/5} - 9^{-7/5}u^{2/5}$\n\nThe derivative, which is needed for the change of variable, is:\n$\\frac{dx}{du} \\approx \\frac{1}{5}9^{-1/5}u^{-4/5} - \\frac{2}{5}9^{-7/5}u^{-3/5}$\n\nThe integral becomes $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_{h(0)}^{h(15)} \\frac{dx}{du} \\frac{du}{\\epsilon+u}$. Since the main contribution is from small $u$, we can extend the integration limit to infinity and substitute the expansion for $\\frac{dx}{du}$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{5}9^{-1/5}u^{-4/5} - \\frac{2}{5}9^{-7/5}u^{-3/5}\\right) \\frac{du}{\\epsilon+u}$\n\nThis can be integrated term by term. The integrals are of the form $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{u^\\alpha}{\\epsilon+u} du$, which can be evaluated using the Beta function and lead to:\n$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{u^{a-1}}{\\epsilon+u} du = \\epsilon^{a-1} \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(a\\pi)}$\n\nFor the first term, $a-1 = -4/5$, so $a = 1/5$. For the second term, $a-1 = -3/5$, so $a=2/5$.\nApplying this formula, we obtain the two-term asymptotic expansion for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{5}9^{-1/5} \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5} - \\frac{2}{5}9^{-7/5} \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(2\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-3/5}$\n\nThis provides an analytical formula approximating $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$.\n\n<<<\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{5})} \\epsilon^{-4/5} - \\frac{2\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{7/5} \\sin(\\frac{2\\pi}{5})} \\epsilon^{-3/5}$\n>>>"
