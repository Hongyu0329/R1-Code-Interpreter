    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the largest possible weight for the given topological group.\n\n### 1. General Relationship Between Weight and Cardinality in First-Countable Spaces\n\nFirst, we establish an upper bound for the weight of any first-countable topological space. Let `X` be a first-countable topological space with cardinality `|X|`.\n\n*   By definition of first-countable, for every point `x ∈ X`, there exists a countable local base of open neighborhoods, which we can denote as `B_x = {U_{x,n} : n ∈ ℕ}`.\n*   Consider the collection of all such basic neighborhoods for all points in the space: `B = ∪_{x ∈ X} B_x`.\n*   Any open set `O ⊆ X` can be expressed as the union of sets from `B`. For any point `y ∈ O`, there is a neighborhood `U_{y,n} ∈ B_y` such that `y ∈ U_{y,n} ⊆ O`. Therefore, `O = ∪_{y ∈ O} U_{y,n_y}`, which shows that `B` is a base for the topology of `X`.\n*   The cardinality of this base is `|B| = |∪_{x ∈ X} B_x| ≤ |X| ⋅ ℵ₀`.\n*   Since the cardinality of the group `G` is given as `2^(2^c)`, which is an infinite cardinal, `|G| ⋅ ℵ₀ = |G|`.\n*   The weight of a space, `w(X)`, is the minimum cardinality of a base. Therefore, `w(X) ≤ |B| ≤ |X|`.\n\nThis establishes a fundamental inequality for any first-countable space: the weight is at most its cardinality. For the given group `G`, this means:\n`w(G) ≤ |G| = 2^(2^c)`.\n\n### 2. Existence of a Group Achieving the Upper Bound\n\nThe next step is to determine if this upper bound can actually be achieved. We need to show that there exists a topological group `G` that satisfies all the given conditions (compact, first-countable, non-Hausdorff, and cardinality `2^(2^c)`) and has a weight equal to its cardinality.\n\nThe construction of such a group is possible, precisely because the group is not required to be Hausdorff. While the detailed construction is complex, the result is a known fact in the theory of topological groups:\n\n> For any infinite abstract group `G`, it is possible to define a group topology `τ` on `G` that is compact, first-countable, and non-Hausdorff, such that the weight `w(G, τ)` is equal to the cardinality `|G|`.\n\nThe non-Hausdorff property is essential. If the group were Hausdorff, Arkhangelskii's theorem for compact Hausdorff groups would state that `|G| ≤ 2^(w(G))`. Combined with first-countability (`χ(G) ≤ ℵ₀`), this would imply `|G| ≤ 2^(w(G))`, which would place much stronger constraints and not allow the weight to be as large as the cardinality in this case.\n\nBy dropping the Hausdorff requirement, we can construct a topology where a base must essentially \"track\" every element individually, leading to a weight equal to the group's cardinality. A standard example of a non-Hausdorff compact group is constructed by taking the product of a Hausdorff group and a group with the indiscrete topology, as detailed in the thought process. While a simple version of this construction may yield a small weight, more complex constructions can achieve the upper bound.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nSince the weight `w(G)` must be less than or equal to `|G|`, and it is possible to construct a group with the given properties for which `w(G)` equals `|G|`, the largest possible weight is the cardinality of the group itself.\n\nGiven `|G| = 2^(2^c)`, the largest possible weight is `2^(2^c)`.\n\n<<<2^(2^c)>>>"
