    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, we first need to find the number of functions for each type of atom (carbon and hydrogen) and then multiply by the number of each atom in the molecule.\n\nHere is the breakdown for each atom type with the 6-31G basis set:\n\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom**:\n    *   The core (1s) orbital is represented by 1 contracted function (from the \"6\" in 6-31G, which is a contraction of 6 primitive Gaussian functions).\n    *   The valence shell (2s and 2p orbitals) is split. The inner part is a contraction of 3 primitives, and the outer part is represented by 1 primitive.\n    *   This split applies to the one 2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals (px, py, pz).\n    *   This results in: 1 (for 1s) + 4 (for inner 2sp) + 4 (for outer 2sp) = 9 contracted basis functions per carbon atom.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom**:\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons, only a 1s valence orbital.\n    *   This 1s orbital is split into two contracted functions: one is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, and the other is a single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   This results in: 2 contracted basis functions per hydrogen atom.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total for toluene (C7H8), which has 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms:\n\n*   **Total for Carbon atoms**: 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **Total for Hydrogen atoms**: 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total contracted Gaussian functions**: 63 + 16 = 79 functions\n\n<<<79>>>"
