    "Augustine of Hippo is the Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe apparent changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations in natural laws at the Fall.\n\nAugustine articulated this concept with the Latin phrase, *“Portentum ergo fit non contra naturam, sed contra quam est nota natura,”* which translates to, “A portent, therefore, happens not contrary to nature, but contrary to what we know of nature.” His view is that miracles are not violations of the natural order created by God. Instead, they are events for which the natural causes are unknown to humanity, operating according to a deeper reality of nature established by God's will. For Augustine, the will of God is the ultimate nature of all created things, so nothing can truly happen contrary to it.\n\nThis framework is applicable to the virgin birth, which would be understood as a divine act operating within a higher order of nature established by God, even if it is contrary to our limited human understanding of biology.\n\nFurthermore, Augustine applied this concept of nature's mutability under God's will to the consequences of the Fall. In his work, *City of God*, he wrote that human flesh was constituted differently before sin, in a state where it was not subject to death, and that its current mortal condition is a change from that original state. He argued that in the future resurrection, human bodies will once again be constituted in a different fashion, demonstrating that what we perceive as fixed \"nature\" can be and has been altered by God.\n\nWhile other theologians like Thomas Aquinas later categorized different types of miracles, and C. S. Lewis described miracles as supernatural events that nature \"accommodates,\" Augustine was the first to coin a specific phrase to articulate the idea that miracles operate contrary to our *knowledge* of nature, rather than contrary to nature itself.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
