    "The Wittig reaction is a widely used method in organic synthesis to create alkenes from carbonyl compounds (like aldehydes and ketones) and phosphorus ylides. This reaction involves the replacement of the carbonyl oxygen atom with the carbon group from the ylide, forming a carbon-carbon double bond and triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct.\n\nTo determine the product of the specified reaction, we first identify the structures of the reactants:\n*   **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, which has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **Wittig Reagent:** The second reactant is (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide. Its structure is derived as follows:\n    *   \"triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane\" indicates a PPh₃ group.\n    *   \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)\" describes the organic substituent attached to the phosphorus. \"Ethylidene\" specifies a two-carbon chain forming the ylide, so the structure is PPh₃=CH-CH₂-R. The substituent on the second carbon of this chain is a 2-chlorophenyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the ylide structure is PPh₃=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄)-Cl, with the chlorine at the ortho (2) position of the phenyl ring.\n\nIn the Wittig reaction, the oxygen of the pivalaldehyde is swapped with the `=CH-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)` fragment from the ylide. This results in the formation of a new double bond.\n\nThe resulting product has the chemical structure (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄)-Cl.\n\nThe IUPAC name for this product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**. The stereochemistry (E/Z) of the double bond depends on the reaction conditions and the nature of the ylide. The ylide in this reaction, (2-chlorobenzyl)triphenylphosphonium ylide, is considered semi-stabilized, which often results in a mixture of E and Z isomers.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
