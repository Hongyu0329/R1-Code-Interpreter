    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, it is the character of Snaut who is associated with missing the sound of rustling leaves on Earth.\n\nDr. Snaut, one of the scientists aboard the space station, reveals a sense of profound homesickness and nostalgia. In a conversation with the main character, Kris Kelvin, Snaut mentions that another scientist, Gibarian, had come up with the idea of taping strips of paper to the air vents. The sound of the paper fluttering in the artificial breeze was a substitute for the sound of rustling leaves, a simple yet poignant attempt to bring a piece of Earth to the sterile environment of the space station. This act highlights the deep-seated human need for connection to nature and the quiet desperation of the crew members.\n\nWhile some interpretations suggest that Kris Kelvin also partakes in this, the dialogue and anlaysis of the film primarily attribute the expression of this particular form of longing to Snaut.\n\n<<<C>>>"
