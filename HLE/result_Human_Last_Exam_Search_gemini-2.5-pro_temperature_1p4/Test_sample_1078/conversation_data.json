    "Finite Weyl groups are classified by Dynkin diagrams. The rank of a Weyl group corresponds to the number of nodes in its associated Dynkin diagram. For a rank of 4, the possible irreducible Weyl groups are given by the Dynkin diagrams A₄, B₄, C₄, D₄, and F₄.\n\nTo determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to examine these potential groups:\n\n*   **W(A₄):** The Weyl group of type A₄ is isomorphic to the symmetric group S₅. Its order is 5! = 120.\n*   **W(B₄) and W(C₄):** The Weyl groups of type Bₙ and Cₙ are isomorphic for n ≥ 2. Therefore, W(B₄) and W(C₄) are isomorphic. Their order is 2⁴ * 4! = 16 * 24 = 384.\n*   **W(D₄):** The Weyl group of type D₄ has an order of 2⁴⁻¹ * 4! = 8 * 24 = 192.\n*   **W(F₄):** The Weyl group of type F₄ is an exceptional Weyl group with an order of 1152.\n\nSince groups with different orders cannot be isomorphic, we can compare the orders of these groups to determine that they are distinct:\n*   |W(A₄)| = 120\n*   |W(B₄)| = |W(C₄)| = 384\n*   |W(D₄)| = 192\n*   |W(F₄)| = 1152\n\nThe distinct non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 are W(A₄), W(B₄) (which is isomorphic to W(C₄)), W(D₄), and W(F₄).\n\nThus, there are 4 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
