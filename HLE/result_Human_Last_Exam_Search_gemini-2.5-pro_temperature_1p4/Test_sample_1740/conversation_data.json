    "To date, the let-7 family of microRNAs in humans consists of 9 to 12 members, depending on whether one is counting the mature miRNA sequences or the genomic loci that encode for them.\n\nThere are generally considered to be 10 unique mature let-7 family member sequences: let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, mir-98, and mir-202. These mature miRNAs are the final, functional molecules that regulate gene expression.\n\nHowever, these mature miRNAs are processed from a larger number of precursor genes located at different positions in the genome. Several sources state that the human let-7 family is encoded by 12 or 13 genomic loci. For example, there are multiple copies of the gene for let-7a (let-7a-1, let-7a-2, let-7a-3) found on different chromosomes.\n\nIn summary, while there are around 10 distinct mature let-7 miRNAs, they originate from a slightly larger set of 12 to 13 genes.\n\n<<<12>>>"
