    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is a large, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with three ethynyl substituents. Based on the repeating structural motif evident in the SMILES notation, the molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry.\n\nThe structure is a derivative of a triangular-shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, often referred to as a triangulene or a propeller-shaped molecule. Due to significant steric hindrance between the aromatic units, such molecules are typically non-planar and adopt a twisted, propeller-like conformation.\n\nThe key symmetry elements of this molecule are:\n\n*   **A principal C3 rotational axis:** This axis passes through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to the overall plane of the structure. A 120-degree rotation around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable. The threefold symmetry is strongly suggested by the repetitive pattern within the SMILES string.\n*   **Three C2 rotational axes:** These axes are perpendicular to the principal C3 axis and lie in the equatorial plane of the molecule. Each C2 axis passes through the outer region of one of the three \"blades\" of the propeller.\n\nThe molecule does not possess a horizontal mirror plane (σh) because it is non-planar. The propeller-like twist also eliminates the presence of vertical mirror planes (σv) or dihedral mirror planes (σd). Furthermore, it does not have a center of inversion (i).\n\nA molecule that has one C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes, and no other symmetry elements, belongs to the **D3** point group. Molecules in this point group are chiral due to the absence of any roto-reflection axes (including mirror planes and inversion centers).\n\n<<<D3>>>"
