    "Here is the step-by-step determination of the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n**1. Identify the relevant chemical equilibria.**\n\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is added to pure water, two main equilibrium reactions occur:\n\n*   **Dissolution:** The solid Al(OH)₃ dissolves to form aluminum ions (Al³⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the solubility product constant, K_sp.\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 × 10⁻²⁷\n\n*   **Complex Formation:** The dissolved aluminum ions react with hydroxide ions to form the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻.\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the formation constant, K_f.\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 × 10³¹\n\n**2. Define the molar solubility.**\n\nThe total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**3. Express species concentrations in terms of [OH⁻].**\n\nWe can express the concentrations of the aluminum species in terms of the hydroxide ion concentration, [OH⁻]:\n\n*   From the K_sp expression:\n    [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n\n*   From the K_f expression, we can derive the concentration of the complex ion:\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f × [Al³⁺] × [OH⁻]⁴\n    Substituting the expression for [Al³⁺]:\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f × (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) × [OH⁻]⁴ = K_sp × K_f × [OH⁻]\n\n**4. Establish the charge balance equation.**\n\nFor the system to remain electrically neutral, the sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges. The ions in the solution are Al³⁺, H⁺ (from water autoionization), OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻.\n3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**5. Solve for the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻].**\n\nSubstitute the expressions for [Al³⁺], [Al(OH)₄⁻], and [H⁺] (where [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻] and K_w = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) into the charge balance equation.\n\n3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_sp × K_f × [OH⁻])\n\nGiven the high value of K_f, it is likely that [Al(OH)₄⁻] is a major species. A reasonable approximation is that the main charged species are Al³⁺ and Al(OH)₄⁻, and their charges approximately balance each other.\n3[Al³⁺] ≈ [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nNow, substitute the expressions in terms of K_sp and K_f:\n3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) ≈ K_sp × K_f × [OH⁻]\n\nWe can cancel K_sp from both sides and rearrange to solve for [OH⁻]:\n3 / [OH⁻]³ ≈ K_f × [OH⁻]\n[OH⁻]⁴ ≈ 3 / K_f\n[OH⁻]⁴ ≈ 3 / (1.1 × 10³¹) ≈ 2.727 × 10⁻³¹\n[OH⁻] ≈ (2.727 × 10⁻³¹)¹/⁴ ≈ 2.285 × 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\n**6. Calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species.**\n\nUsing the calculated [OH⁻], we can find the concentrations of the individual aluminum species:\n\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 × 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.44 × 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_sp × K_f × [OH⁻] = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) × (1.1 × 10³¹) × (2.285 × 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n(Note: 3 × [Al³⁺] = 3 × 4.44 × 10⁻⁴ = 1.332 × 10⁻³, which is indeed approximately equal to [Al(OH)₄⁻], confirming our approximation was valid).\n\n**7. Calculate the total solubility (S).**\n\nFinally, sum the concentrations of the aluminum species to find the total molar solubility:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\nS = (4.44 × 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 × 10⁻³)\nS = 0.000444 + 0.00133\nS = 0.001774 mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures (based on the given constants):\nS = 1.8 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8 * 10^(-3)>>>"
