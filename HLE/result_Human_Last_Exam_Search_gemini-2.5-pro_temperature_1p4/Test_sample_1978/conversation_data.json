    "To find the index of the considered boundary-value problem, we first need to understand the structure of the problem and the definition of the index in this context.\n\nThe problem is a linear boundary-value problem for a system of first-order ordinary differential equations. It is described by the operator `L(x) = (x' - Ax, Φ(x))`, where `Φ(x) = 0` represents the boundary conditions. For such a problem, the associated operator `L` is a Fredholm operator, and its index is given by the formula:\n`Index = n - m`\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the dimension of the system, i.e., the number of scalar differential equations.\n*   `m` is the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n\n**1. Determine the dimension of the system (n)**\n\nThe state vector is given as `x(t) = (x₁(t), x₂(t), x₃(t), ..., x₂₀₂₄(t))`. This indicates that the system consists of 2024 coupled ordinary differential equations. Therefore, the dimension of the system is `n = 2024`.\n\nNote: There is a discrepancy in the problem statement where the matrix `A` and the vector `I(t)` are described with a dimension of 202000. However, the explicit definition of the vector `x(t)` and the indices used in the boundary conditions (`x₁`, `x₂`, `x₂₀₂₄`) strongly suggest that the system's dimension is indeed 2024. We will proceed with `n = 2024`.\n\n**2. Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (m)**\n\nThe given boundary conditions are:\n1.  `x₁(T) - x₁(0) = 0`\n2.  `x₂(T) - x₂(0) = 0`\n3.  `5x₂(T) - 5x₂(0) = 0`\n4.  `100x₂(T) - 100x₂(0) = 0`\n5.  `1000x₂(0) - 1000x₂(T) = 0`\n6.  `100x₂₀₂₄(T) - 100x₂₀₂₄(0) = 0`\n\nWe need to identify the number of unique, linearly independent conditions from this list.\n*   Condition 3 is `5 * (x₂(T) - x₂(0)) = 0`, which is a scalar multiple of condition 2. Thus, it is linearly dependent on condition 2.\n*   Condition 4 is `100 * (x₂(T) - x₂(0)) = 0`, which is also a scalar multiple of condition 2 and linearly dependent.\n*   Condition 5 is `-1000 * (x₂(T) - x₂(0)) = 0`, another scalar multiple of condition 2, hence linearly dependent.\n*   Condition 6, `100x₂₀₂₄(T) - 100x₂₀₂₄(0) = 0`, can be simplified by dividing by 100 to `x₂₀₂₄(T) - x₂₀₂₄(0) = 0`.\n\nThis leaves us with the following set of linearly independent boundary conditions:\n1.  `x₁(T) - x₁(0) = 0`\n2.  `x₂(T) - x₂(0) = 0`\n3.  `x₂₀₂₄(T) - x₂₀₂₄(0) = 0`\n\nThere are `m = 3` linearly independent boundary conditions.\n\n**3. Calculate the index**\n\nUsing the formula `Index = n - m`, we can calculate the index of the problem:\n`Index = 2024 - 3 = 2021`\n\n<<<2021>>>"
