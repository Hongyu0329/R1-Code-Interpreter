    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the repeating pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids that defines the structure. Coiled coils are characterized by a seven-residue repeat, known as a heptad, with positions labeled `abcdefg`. The residues at positions `a` and `d` are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the coiled-coil, packing against each other in a \"knobs-into-holes\" arrangement. The specific amino acids at these core positions are the primary determinants of the oligomeric state.\n\n1.  **Sequence Analysis and Heptad Register Assignment:**\n    The provided sequence is `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`. To find the heptad repeat, we look for a recurring pattern where hydrophobic residues are spaced at positions `i` and `i+3`. The most plausible registration that places hydrophobic residues consistently at the core `a` and `d` positions is by assigning Alanine (A) to the `a` positions and Leucine (L) to the `d` positions.\n\n    Let's assign the `abcdefg` register starting from the Alanine at position 4:\n    *   Flanking residues: G E I\n    *   **Heptad 1:** **A**(a) Q(b) S(c) **L**(d) K(e) E(f) I(g)\n    *   **Heptad 2:** **A**(a) K(b) S(c) **L**(d) K(e) E(f) I(g)\n    *   **Heptad 3:** **A**(a) W(b) S(c) **L**(d) K(e) E(f) I(g)\n    *   **Heptad 4:** **A**(a) Q(b) S(c) **L**(d) K(e) G(f) ... (sequence terminates)\n    *   Flanking residues: K G\n\n    This registration reveals a highly consistent pattern for the core positions over four full heptads:\n    *   **'a' positions:** Alanine (A), Alanine (A), Alanine (A), Alanine (A)\n    *   **'d' positions:** Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Leucine (L)\n\n2.  **Knobs-into-Holes Packing and Oligomeric State Determination:**\n    The \"knobs-into-holes\" model describes how side chains from one helix (knobs) pack into cavities formed by side chains on the adjacent helix (holes). The size and shape of the core residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions are critical for defining the geometry of this packing and, consequently, the number of helices in the bundle.\n\n    *   **Dimeric Coiled-Coils (2 helices):** These are often specified by having a smaller β-branched amino acid (like Isoleucine or Valine) at the 'a' position and a larger, flexible γ-branched amino acid (like Leucine) at the 'd' position. The sequence in question has Alanine at the 'a' position. Alanine is the smallest chiral amino acid, and its small size is well-accommodated within the sterically constrained 'a' position of a dimeric interface. The `a=A, d=L` pattern is highly analogous to the classic `a=I, d=L` dimer-forming motif found in proteins like the GCN4 leucine zipper.\n\n    *   **Trimeric Coiled-Coils (3 helices):** Trimers typically require a more symmetrical hydrophobic core. A common motif for trimers is having Isoleucine at both the 'a' and 'd' positions. The asymmetrical `a=A, d=L` core of the given peptide does not fit the packing requirements for a stable trimer.\n\n    *   **Tetrameric Coiled-Coils (4 helices):** Tetramers are often formed when the dimer motif is reversed, for example, with Leucine at the 'a' position and Isoleucine at the 'd' position. The `a=A, d=L` pattern is inconsistent with this requirement.\n\n    *   **Higher-Order Oligomers (5+ helices):** These are rare and necessitate more complex sequence features than the simple, canonical repeat seen in this peptide.\n\nBased on the consistent `a=Alanine` and `d=Leucine` hydrophobic core pattern, which fits the packing requirements for a two-stranded coiled-coil, the protein would most likely form a dimer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
