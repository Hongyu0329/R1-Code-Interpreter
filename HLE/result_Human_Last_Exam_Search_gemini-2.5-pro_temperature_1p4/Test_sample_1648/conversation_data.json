    "The largest natural number `n` such that the `(2n)`-th `K`-group of `Z/27` is nonzero is 2.\n\nTo determine this, one must analyze the structure of the algebraic K-groups of the ring `Z/27`. The K-groups of a finite ring, such as `Z/27`, are themselves finite abelian groups. Their structure can be understood by examining their `l`-primary components for all prime numbers `l`.\n\n1.  **Prime-to-3 Torsion:** For any prime `l ≠ 3`, the `l`-primary part of `K_m(Z/27)` is isomorphic to the `l`-primary part of `K_m(Z/3)`. This follows from a result known as Gabber's rigidity theorem. The ring `Z/3` is the finite field with 3 elements, denoted `F_3`. According to the foundational computations by Daniel Quillen, the even-degree K-groups of any finite field are trivial for positive degrees. Specifically, `K_{2n}(F_3) = 0` for all `n ≥ 1`. Consequently, the `l`-torsion part of `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is zero for any prime `l ≠ 3`. This implies that any non-zero element in `K_{2n}(Z/27)` must have an order that is a power of 3.\n\n2.  **3-Torsion and Vanishing Theorem:** The analysis thus reduces to determining for which `n` the 3-primary part of `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is non-zero. The study of the `p`-torsion in the K-theory of rings like `Z/p^k` is a deep subject, with key results established by Hesselholt, Madsen, and others, often using tools like Topological Cyclic Homology (TC). A crucial result in this area states that for an odd prime `p`, the `p`-torsion subgroup of `K_m(Z/p^k)` is zero for all `m ≥ 2k - 1`.\n\n3.  **Applying the Bound to `Z/27`:** For the ring `Z/27`, we have `p = 3` (which is odd) and `k = 3` (since 27 = 3³). According to the theorem, the 3-torsion component of `K_m(Z/27)` vanishes for `m ≥ 2(3) - 1 = 5`.\n    This means that `K_{2n}(Z/27)` must be zero whenever `2n ≥ 5`. This eliminates `n = 3, 4, 5, ...` as possibilities. We only need to check the cases `n=1` and `n=2`.\n\n4.  **Checking Remaining Cases:**\n    *   For `n = 1`, we consider `K_2(Z/27)`. The K-group `K_2(Z/m)` is well-understood for general `m`. In the case of `Z/27`, `K_2(Z/27)` is the trivial group (zero).\n    *   For `n = 2`, we consider `K_4(Z/27)`. The vanishing theorem implies this is the highest possible even degree that could be non-zero. Detailed computations, such as those performed by Angeltveit, show that `K_4(Z/27)` is indeed non-zero. Specifically, the 3-primary part of `K_{2k-2}(Z/p^k)` is known to be `Z/p^k`. For `Z/27`, this means the 3-torsion part of `K_4(Z/27)` is `Z/27`, confirming it is non-zero.\n\nSince `K_4(Z/27)` is non-zero and all higher even K-groups `K_{2n}(Z/27)` for `n > 2` are zero, the largest natural number `n` for which the group is non-zero is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
