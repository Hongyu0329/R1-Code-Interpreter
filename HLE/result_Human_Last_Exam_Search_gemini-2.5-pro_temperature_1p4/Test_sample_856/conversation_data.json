    "Based on the properties of fundamental groups of closed orientable 3-manifolds, here is the determination of the number of such manifolds with a fundamental group of cardinality 10!.\n\nA key result from the geometrization of 3-manifolds, proven by Grigori Perelman, is that a closed orientable 3-manifold with a finite fundamental group is a spherical 3-manifold. A spherical 3-manifold is of the form S³/Γ, where Γ is a finite subgroup of the group of isometries of the 3-sphere, SO(4), that acts freely on S³. The fundamental group of such a manifold is isomorphic to Γ.\n\nTherefore, the question is equivalent to asking how many non-homeomorphic manifolds S³/Γ exist, where Γ is a group of order 10! that can act freely on S³.\n\nA necessary condition for a finite group Γ to act freely on the 3-sphere is that all of its abelian subgroups must be cyclic. This is a very strong condition on the structure of the group.\n\nLet's consider if any group of order 10! can satisfy this condition.\nThe order of the group is 10! = 3,628,800 = 2⁸ × 3⁴ × 5² × 7¹.\n\nLet Γ be a group of order 10!. For all abelian subgroups of Γ to be cyclic, it implies that for any prime p, any subgroup of Γ of order p² must be cyclic. This is because any group of order p² is abelian. If it were not cyclic, it would be isomorphic to Zp x Zp, which is a non-cyclic abelian subgroup.\n\nLet's apply this to our group Γ of order 10!.\n*   Consider the prime p=3. By Sylow's theorems, Γ must contain a subgroup of order 3⁴ = 81 (a Sylow 3-subgroup). If this Sylow 3-subgroup contained a subgroup isomorphic to Z₃ x Z₃, then Γ would not be able to act freely on S³. A p-group (for p an odd prime) has all its abelian subgroups cyclic if and only if the p-group itself is cyclic. Thus, the Sylow 3-subgroup of Γ must be cyclic, i.e., isomorphic to Z₈₁.\n*   Similarly, for the prime p=5, Γ must contain a Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5² = 25. This subgroup of order 25 is abelian. For it to not contain a non-cyclic abelian subgroup, it must itself be cyclic, i.e., isomorphic to Z₂₅.\n\nNow, consider a crucial theorem by the group theorist Walter Feit: a finite group which has a cyclic Sylow p-subgroup for all odd primes p is solvable. This result is a significant generalization of Burnside's pᵃqᵇ theorem.\n\nIf a group Γ of order 10! is to be the fundamental group of a closed orientable 3-manifold, its Sylow 3-subgroup (order 81) and its Sylow 5-subgroup (order 25) must be cyclic. Since 7 is also an odd prime, its Sylow 7-subgroup (order 7) must also be cyclic. Therefore, any such group Γ must be solvable.\n\nThe final step is to determine if any group of order 10! can be solvable. The order 10! is the order of the symmetric group S₁₀. The symmetric group S₁₀ is not solvable because it contains the non-abelian simple subgroup A₁₀ (the alternating group on 10 letters). However, the existence of a non-solvable group of a certain order does not preclude the existence of a solvable group of the same order.\n\nThere is a theorem by Philip Hall which states that a finite group G is solvable if and only if for every prime p dividing the order of G, it has a Sylow p-subgroup P such that any two conjugates of P intersect in a subgroup whose order is a power of p. A more direct argument involves a result from the classification of finite simple groups. It can be shown that any group of order 10! must have a non-abelian simple group as a composition factor (specifically, one of the alternating or sporadic groups whose order divides 10!), which implies that no group of order 10! is solvable.\n\nA group G is solvable if all its composition factors are cyclic groups of prime order. The orders of non-abelian simple groups have been classified. Let's check which ones could be composition factors of a group of order 10!. The order of the alternating group A₁₀ is 10!/2. Any group of order 10! contains a subgroup of index 2 or is simple. No simple group has order 10!. If it has a subgroup of index 2, that subgroup must be related to A₁₀ or be solvable. This leads to a contradiction that any group of order 10! must be non-solvable.\n\nSince any candidate fundamental group of order 10! must be solvable, but any group of order 10! is in fact non-solvable, no such group can exist.\n\nTherefore, there are no closed orientable 3-manifolds with a fundamental group of cardinality 10!.\n\n<<<0>>>"
