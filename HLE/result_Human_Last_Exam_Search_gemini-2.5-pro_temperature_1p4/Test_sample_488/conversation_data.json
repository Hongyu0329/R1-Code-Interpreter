    "The phrase \"my love for humanity\" expresses a **structural metaphor**. Here's a breakdown of why:\n\nAccording to the theory of conceptual metaphor, pioneered by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, we understand abstract concepts in terms of more concrete ones. They identify several types of these metaphors, with the main categories being structural, orientational, and ontological.\n\n*   **Structural metaphors** are those in which one concept is metaphorically structured in terms of another. A classic example is ARGUMENT IS WAR, where we use language associated with war to describe arguing (e.g., \"He *won* the argument,\" \"I *attacked* his main point\"). Love is frequently understood through various structural metaphors such as LOVE IS A JOURNEY, LOVE IS WAR, or LOVE IS A PHYSICAL FORCE.\n\n*   **Orientational metaphors**, on the other hand, organize a system of concepts with respect to spatial orientation, like up-down, in-out, or front-back. Common examples include HAPPY IS UP (\"I'm feeling up\") and SAD IS DOWN (\"He's feeling low\").\n\nThe phrase \"my love for humanity\" treats the abstract emotion of \"love\" as a possession or a tangible thing that can be held and directed towards \"humanity\". This structuring of an abstract concept (love) in terms of something more concrete (a possession or object) is the defining characteristic of a structural metaphor. Studies on the conceptual metaphors of love show that it is frequently categorized as a structural metaphor, where the abstract idea of love is understood through more concrete concepts like a journey, a physical object, or closeness.\n\nWhile orientational metaphors deal with spatial relationships (up/down), \"my love for humanity\" does not inherently suggest such an orientation. Therefore, it fits best within the definition of a structural metaphor.\n\n<<<D>>>"
