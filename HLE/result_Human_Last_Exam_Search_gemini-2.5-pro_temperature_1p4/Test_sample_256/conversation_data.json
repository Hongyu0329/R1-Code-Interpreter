    "The symmetry group of the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C_1. This is based on the comprehensive data compiled by Eckard Specht on the best-known packings of equal circles in a circle.\n\nFor the packing of 1135 circles, the corresponding field for the symmetry group is empty. According to the legend of the table, if the symmetry group field is empty, the packing possesses the C_1 symmetry element. This indicates that the arrangement has no rotational symmetry other than the trivial identity element.\n\n<<<C_1>>>"
