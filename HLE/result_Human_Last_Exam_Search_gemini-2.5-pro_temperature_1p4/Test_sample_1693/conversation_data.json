    "The largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the steam merchant **Bretagne**, with a tonnage of 10,108 tons.\n\nThe Second World War began on September 1, 1939, and the armistice between France and Germany was signed on June 22, 1940, taking effect on June 25, 1940. In the period between these dates, a number of French vessels were sunk by German U-boats.\n\nThe steam merchant *Bretagne* was sunk on October 14, 1939, by the German U-boat U-45. The ship, owned by the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, was part of the unescorted convoy KJF-3 when it was attacked approximately 230 miles southwest of Fastnet. Another significant loss during this period was the French steam merchant *Louisiane*, which had a tonnage of 6,903 tons and was sunk on October 13, 1939, by the U-boat U-48.\n\nAmong French naval losses to U-boats before the armistice was the submarine *Doris* (Q135), which was sunk on May 8, 1940. The *Doris* had a surfaced displacement of 615 tons. The French battleship *Bretagne* was a much larger vessel, with a displacement of 23,936 tons, but it was sunk by British warships at Mers-el-Kébir on July 3, 1940, after the armistice had been signed.\n\nWhile several French destroyers were also lost in the lead-up to the armistice, particularly during the Dunkirk evacuation in May and June 1940, the merchant ship *Bretagne* remains the largest confirmed French vessel sunk by a U-boat during this timeframe.\n\n<<<Bretagne>>>"
