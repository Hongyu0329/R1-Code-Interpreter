    "The rule activation level in a fuzzy inference system is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the rule's antecedent and the membership function of the consequent. The firing strength of the antecedent is given by `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`, and the membership value of the consequent is `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n\nA t-norm, or triangular norm, is a function that generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation in fuzzy logic. The specific t-norm to be used is often chosen based on the application, with the most common being the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm.\n\nHere are the calculations for the rule activation level using these common t-norms:\n\n*   **Using the Minimum t-norm:** This t-norm takes the minimum of the two values.\n    `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n*   **Using the Product t-norm:** This t-norm multiplies the two values.\n    `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\nSince the problem does not specify which t-norm to apply, the answer depends on that choice. Using the minimum t-norm, which is very common, the result is 0.7. Using the product t-norm, the result is 0.63.\n\n<<<Using the minimum t-norm, the rule activation level is 0.7. Using the product t-norm, the rule activation level is 0.63.>>>"
