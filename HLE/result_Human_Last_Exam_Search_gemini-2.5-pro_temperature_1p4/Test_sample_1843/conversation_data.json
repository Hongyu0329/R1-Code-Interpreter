    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we first need to factorize $N$ and then analyze the properties of the characters for each factor.\n\n### Step 1: Factorization of N\nThe conductor is $N = 36036$. We find its prime factorization:\n$N = 36036 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 = 4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$\n\n### Step 2: Properties of Primitive Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product of primitive characters $\\chi_{p^a}$ for each prime power $p^a$ in the factorization of $N$. That is, $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$, where each $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a primitive character for its respective modulus.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its constituent characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$\n\nWe require this order to be 6. This imposes two conditions:\n1.  The order of each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ must divide 6.\n2.  The lcm of the orders must be exactly 6, meaning there must be at least one character whose order is a multiple of 2, and at least one whose order is a multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Primitive Characters for Each Factor\nWe count the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor, keeping only those whose orders divide 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$)**: The multiplicative group $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ has order $\\phi(4)=2$. There is one primitive character modulo 4, and its order is 2. So, we have 1 choice for $\\chi_4$, and its order is $o_4=2$.\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$)**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ has order $\\phi(9)=6$. A character modulo 9 is primitive if it is not induced by a character modulo 3. The characters induced from modulo 3 have orders that divide $\\phi(3)=2$. Thus, primitive characters modulo 9 must have orders that divide 6 but not 2. The possible orders are 3 and 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_9$: $2+2=4$. The order $o_9$ will be in $\\{3, 6\\}$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ has order $\\phi(7)=6$. Any non-principal character is primitive. The orders of these characters must divide 6.\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$ character.\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$ characters.\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$ characters.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_7$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ has order $\\phi(11)=10$. The orders of primitive (i.e., non-principal) characters are 2, 5, and 10. The only order that divides 6 is 2.\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$ character.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1. The order is $o_{11}=2$.\n\n*   **Modulo 13**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ has order $\\phi(13)=12$. The orders of primitive characters are 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. We consider only those dividing 6.\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$ character.\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$ characters.\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$ characters.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n### Step 4: Combining the Results\nWe need to find the total number of combinations of these primitive characters such that the lcm of their orders is 6. Let the orders of the chosen characters be $(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$.\nFrom our analysis:\n*   $o_4 = 2$\n*   $o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_{11} = 2$\n*   $o_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nThe lcm of these orders must be 6.\n1.  Since all possible orders for each component divide 6, the lcm will also divide 6.\n2.  The order of $\\chi_4$ must be 2, so the lcm is guaranteed to be a multiple of 2.\n3.  The order of $\\chi_9$ must be 3 or 6, both of which are multiples of 3. This guarantees the lcm is a multiple of 3.\n\nSince the lcm is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2,3)=6$. Therefore, any combination of the allowed primitive characters will result in a character of order exactly 6.\n\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nNumber of characters = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nNumber of characters = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n<<<100>>>"
