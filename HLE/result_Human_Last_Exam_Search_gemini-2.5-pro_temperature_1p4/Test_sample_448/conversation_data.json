    "## Radon: Earth's Rarest Noble Gas in 2002\n\nIn 2002, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was **Radon (Rn)**. This radioactive element is exceptionally scarce due to its short half-life and its origin as a decay product of other elements.\n\nThe abundances of noble gases on Earth vary significantly, with argon being the most plentiful, primarily making up about 0.934% of the Earth's atmosphere. Following argon, the order of abundance in the atmosphere is typically neon, helium, krypton, and then xenon, which is the rarest of the stable noble gases at approximately 0.0000087% of the atmosphere.\n\nHowever, radon is substantially rarer than even xenon. It is not a primordial element but is continuously generated through the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust. Its most stable isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days, which severely limits its accumulation.\n\nEstimates place the abundance of radon in the Earth's crust at an incredibly low figure of 4 x 10<sup>-13</sup> milligrams per kilogram. While it is also present in the atmosphere, its concentration is highly variable and extremely low, making it the least abundant noble gas in a comprehensive accounting of all terrestrial matter. The fundamental scarcity of radon is a long-established scientific fact that would have been true in 2002, as the elemental composition of the Earth does not change on such short timescales.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
