    "If the Norse had never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely be **suster**.\n\nThe modern English word \"sister\" was directly influenced by the Old Norse word \"systir\". The original Old English term was \"sweostor\" or \"swuster\". These native forms evolved into \"suster\" in Middle English.\n\nWithout the Scandinavian influence that introduced the \"i\" vowel sound, the word \"suster\" would have likely continued its natural development. In this hypothetical scenario, \"suster\" would probably be pronounced with a short \"u\" sound, similar to the vowel in \"put\" or \"foot,\" or it might have evolved to have the same vowel sound as \"brother.\" Cognates in other Germanic languages, such as \"zuster\" in Dutch and \"Schwester\" in German, demonstrate a similar linguistic path from the shared Proto-Germanic root \"*swestÄ“r\".\n\nTherefore, in an English language free of this specific Norse influence, the term used for a female sibling would most probably be \"suster.\"\n\n<<<suster>>>"
