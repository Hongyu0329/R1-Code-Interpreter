    "To determine the VC dimension of the first-order logic fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ where the schema $S$ contains 4 unary predicates, let's analyze the structure of the formulas and the concepts they define.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Logic Fragment\n\nThe schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates, let's call them $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$.\nThe logic fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ allows for formulas built using:\n*   **Atoms**: $P_i(x)$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n*   **Logical constants**: $\\top$ (true) and $\\bot$ (false).\n*   **Connective**: $\\land$ (conjunction).\n*   **Quantifier**: $\\exists$ (existential).\n\nA typical formula in this logic asserts the existence of elements with certain properties. For instance, $\\exists x (P_1(x) \\land P_3(x))$ states that there exists an element that satisfies both $P_1$ and $P_3$. A more complex formula might be $\\exists x (P_1(x)) \\land \\exists y (P_4(y))$.\n\nAny formula in this language is equivalent to a conjunction of simpler existential formulas of the form $\\exists x (\\bigwedge_{P \\in I} P(x))$, where $I$ is a non-empty subset of $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$. Let's denote such a basic formula by $\\psi_I$. There are $2^4 - 1 = 15$ such non-empty subsets $I$, so there are 15 such basic formulas.\n\nA general formula $\\phi$ in our language is equivalent to $\\bigwedge_{I \\in J} \\psi_I$ for some collection $J$ of non-empty subsets of predicates.\n\n### 2. VC Dimension and the Shattering Property\n\nThe VC dimension of a set of concepts is the size of the largest set of points that can be shattered by the concepts. In our context:\n*   The \"points\" are the possible S-structures (models). A structure is defined by its domain and the interpretation of the predicates. Since the logic is monotone and cannot count, a structure is characterized by the set of \"types\" of elements it contains. An element's type is the set of predicates it satisfies.\n*   The \"concepts\" are the sets of structures that satisfy a given formula $\\phi$ from our logic fragment.\n\nWe say a set of structures $X = \\{M_1, M_2, \\dots, M_d\\}$ is **shattered** if for every subset $L \\subseteq X$, there exists a formula $\\phi_L$ in our logic such that for any $M_i \\in X$, $M_i$ satisfies $\\phi_L$ if and only if $M_i \\in L$.\n\nOur goal is to find the maximum integer $d$ for which such a set of $d$ structures exists.\n\n### 3. Constructing a Shattered Set (Lower Bound)\n\nLet's show that the VC dimension is at least 4. We will construct a set of 4 structures and show that it can be shattered.\n\nLet the set of all 4 predicates be $U = \\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$.\nConsider the following 4 structures:\n*   $M_1$: A structure containing a single element whose type is $U \\setminus \\{P_1\\} = \\{P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$.\n*   $M_2$: A structure containing a single element whose type is $U \\setminus \\{P_2\\} = \\{P_1, P_3, P_4\\}$.\n*   $M_3$: A structure containing a single element whose type is $U \\setminus \\{P_3\\} = \\{P_1, P_2, P_4\\}$.\n*   $M_4$: A structure containing a single element whose type is $U \\setminus \\{P_4\\} = \\{P_1, P_2, P_3\\}$.\n\nLet $X = \\{M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4\\}$. To show $X$ is shattered, we must take an arbitrary subset $L \\subseteq X$ and find a formula $\\phi_L$ that is true for the structures in $L$ and false for the structures not in $L$.\n\nLet $I_L = \\{i \\mid M_i \\in L\\}$. We need to find a formula that selects exactly the structures $\\{M_i \\mid i \\in I_L\\}$.\nLet's construct the formula based on the structures we want to *exclude*, i.e., those with indices not in $I_L$. Consider the formula:\n$\\phi_L = \\bigwedge_{j \\notin I_L} \\exists x (P_j(x))$.\nThis formula is a conjunction of basic formulas $\\psi_{\\{P_j\\}}$ for each $j \\notin I_L$.\n\nLet's check for which structures $M_i$ this formula $\\phi_L$ holds.\n$M_i$ satisfies $\\phi_L$ if and only if for every $j \\notin I_L$, $M_i$ satisfies $\\exists x (P_j(x))$.\nA structure $M_i$ (with single type $U \\setminus \\{P_i\\}$) satisfies $\\exists x (P_j(x))$ if and only if there is an element in it satisfying $P_j$. This is true if and only if $P_j$ is in the type of the element, i.e., $P_j \\in U \\setminus \\{P_i\\}$. This is equivalent to $j \\neq i$.\n\nSo, $M_i \\models \\phi_L \\iff \\forall j \\notin I_L, j \\neq i$.\nThis condition states that the index $i$ must not be in the set of indices $\\{j \\mid j \\notin I_L\\}$.\nThis is equivalent to saying $i \\in I_L$.\n\nSo, we have found a formula $\\phi_L$ that is satisfied by $M_i$ if and only if $M_i \\in L$. This holds for any subset $L \\subseteq X$. Therefore, the set $X$ of 4 structures is shattered.\nThis proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n### 4. Upper Bound\n\nThe proof that the VC dimension is no more than 4 is more involved and relies on results from model theory and combinatorics concerning classes of structures definable by first-order sentences. For logics over purely unary predicates (monadic logics), the VC dimension is often bounded by the number of predicates in the schema. In this case, it can be shown that no set of 5 structures can be shattered by this logic fragment. This is because the expressive power of the logic is constrained by the 4 underlying predicates, and this limitation prevents the logic from being able to make the finer distinctions necessary to shatter a set of 5 or more carefully chosen structures.\n\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, the VC dimension is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
