    "To solve the competitive programming problem with the highest memory efficiency, it is necessary to minimize the amount of memory allocated for variables. The standard approach of reading both strings into two separate character arrays is not the most optimal. A more memory-efficient method involves reading only the first string into a buffer and then processing the second string character by character from the input stream, performing the comparison on the fly. This avoids the need to allocate memory for a second buffer.\n\nBelow is the most memory-efficient C program for this task.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/**\n * This program solves the \"Petya and Strings\" problem by comparing\n * two strings lexicographically, ignoring the case of the letters.\n * It is designed for maximum memory efficiency by using only one\n * buffer to store the first string, while the second string is read\n * character by character from standard input for immediate comparison.\n */\nint main() {\n    // Buffer to hold the first input string.\n    // The maximum length is 100, plus one for the null terminator.\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // Variable to hold characters read from stdin.\n    // It is an 'int' to correctly handle the End-Of-File (EOF) marker.\n    int ch;\n\n    // Index for iterating through the buffer s1.\n    int i = 0;\n\n    // Read the first string from standard input into the buffer.\n    while ((ch = getchar()) != '\\n' && ch != EOF) {\n        s1[i++] = (char)ch;\n    }\n    // Append the null terminator to make it a valid C-string.\n    s1[i] = '\\0';\n\n    // Reset the index to the beginning of the string for comparison.\n    i = 0;\n\n    // Read the second string character by character and compare.\n    // The problem guarantees the strings have the same length, so the\n    // loop will terminate correctly for both strings.\n    while ((ch = getchar()) != '\\n' && ch != EOF) {\n        // Compare the characters case-insensitively.\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]) < tolower((unsigned char)ch)) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]) > tolower((unsigned char)ch)) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        // Move to the next character.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop finishes without finding any differences, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation\n\nThe total memory usage (`m`) for the variables in this program is calculated as follows:\n\n1.  **`char s1[101];`**: This declares a character array to store the first string. A `char` typically occupies 1 byte. The array size is 101 to accommodate up to 100 characters plus a null terminator (`\\0`).\n    *   Memory = `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n2.  **`int ch;`**: This variable stores characters read by `getchar()`. It is an `int` because `getchar()` must be able to return every possible character and also a distinct value for End-Of-File (EOF). On most modern systems, an `int` occupies 4 bytes.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n3.  **`int i;`**: This variable is used as a loop counter and index. It is also an `int`.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\nTherefore, the total memory `m` used for variables is the sum of the memory used by `s1`, `ch`, and `i`.\n\n`m = 101 + 4 + 4 = 109` bytes.\n\n<<<109>>>"
