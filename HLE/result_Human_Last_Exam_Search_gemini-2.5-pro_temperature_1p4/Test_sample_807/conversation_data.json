The common name for this chemical is Rhodamine B.\n\nCrayola's specific formulas are proprietary, meaning the exact chemical composition for each crayon color is not publicly released.

The primary ingredients for all crayons are paraffin wax and color pigment.\n\nRhodamine B is a fluorescent dye known for its brilliant, pink to reddish-violet color. It is also known by names such as Basic Violet 10 and Brilliant Pink B.
