    "A power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H that can be generated by a single element of G; in other words, H is a cyclic subgroup. The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as SD_512. The order of this group is 2^n, where n=9.\n\nTo determine the number of cyclic subgroups in SD_512, we can use a known formula for semidihedral groups of order 2^n. For n â‰¥ 3, the number of cyclic subgroups, denoted c(SD_{2^n}), is given by the formula:\n\nc(SD_{2^n}) = n + 2^{n-2} + 2^{n-3}\n\nIn the case of SD_512, we have n = 9. Plugging this value into the formula:\n\nc(SD_512) = 9 + 2^{9-2} + 2^{9-3}\nc(SD_512) = 9 + 2^7 + 2^6\nc(SD_512) = 9 + 128 + 64\nc(SD_512) = 201\n\nThus, the semidihedral group of size 512 has 201 power subgroups. This can be broken down as follows:\n*   **Subgroups of the cyclic subgroup <r>:** The semidihedral group contains a cyclic subgroup <r> of order 256 (which is 2^(9-1)). A cyclic group of order 2^k has k+1 subgroups. Therefore, the subgroup <r> contains 8+1 = 9 cyclic subgroups.\n*   **Cyclic subgroups not contained in <r>:** These subgroups are generated by elements of the form *sr^i*.\n    *   There are 128 (which is 2^{9-2}) elements of order 2 of this form, each generating a unique cyclic subgroup of order 2.\n    *   There are 128 elements of order 4 of this form. These elements form pairs that generate the same subgroup, resulting in 128 / 2 = 64 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4 (which is 2^{9-3}).\n\nSumming these up gives the total number of cyclic subgroups: 9 + 128 + 64 = 201.\n\n<<<201>>>"
