A single-site catalyst composed of a Zirconium or Hafnium organometallic precursor supported on highly Br√∏nsted acidic sulfated alumina is the optimal combination. The sulfated alumina acts as an activating support, creating cationic metal centers that are highly effective for both olefin polymerization and the hydrogenolysis of polyolefins into short alkanes.
