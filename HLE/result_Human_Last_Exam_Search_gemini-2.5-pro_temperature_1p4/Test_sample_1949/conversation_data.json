    "Identifying the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic poem, the *Aeneid*, requires a distinction between the real, geographical rivers and the mythological rivers of the underworld that also feature in the text. While Aeneas's journey takes him to the underworld, with its rivers like the Styx, Acheron, and Phlegethon, these do not have a measurable terrestrial length. Focussing on the tangible rivers on Earth mentioned in the epic, three stand out for their significant lengths.\n\nThe three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\n\n1.  **The Don River:** This river, known in antiquity as the Tanais, is mentioned in the Aeneid. It flows for approximately 1,870 kilometers (1,162 miles) from its source in the Central Russian Uprising to the Sea of Azov.\n2.  **The Rhône River:** Flowing through Switzerland and France, the Rhône is another significant river noted in the Aeneid. Its length is approximately 812 kilometers (505 miles), starting from the Swiss Alps and emptying into the Mediterranean Sea.\n3.  **The Hebrus River:** Now known as the Maritsa, this river is located in the Balkans and is mentioned by Virgil. It has a length of about 480 kilometers (300 miles) and flows through Bulgaria, Turkey, and Greece.\n\nAnother notable river central to the narrative of the *Aeneid* is the Tiber, the river of Rome. While crucial to the story as the site of Aeneas's destined city, it is shorter than the three rivers listed above, with a length of about 406 kilometers (252 miles).\n\nOther terrestrial rivers mentioned in the epic, such as the Cayster in Turkey (modern Küçük Menderes) and the Timavus in Italy, are considerably shorter. Similarly, the Pactolus in modern-day Turkey is a small river, approximately 25 kilometers long. The Numicus, near Lavinium, is also described as a small river. The underworld rivers, including the Styx, Acheron, Phlegethon, Cocytus, and Lethe, while vividly described in Book VI of the Aeneid, are part of its mythological landscape and are not measured in terrestrial terms.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Don, the Rhône, and the Hebrus.>>>"
