    "The defined recursive function $f(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)$ counts the number of paths on an $n$-dimensional integer lattice from the point $(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)$ to the origin $(0, 0, \\ldots, 0)$. The allowed moves are steps of -1 along any single axis, and the paths are constrained to the region defined by $0 \\le x_1 \\le x_2 \\le \\ldots \\le x_n$. This is a classic problem in combinatorics, and the function values are related to generalized Catalan numbers.\n\nThe values requested are calculated as follows:\n\n*   **f(2, 4, 5):**\n    This value is calculated for $n=3$ with arguments $a_1=2, a_2=4, a_3=5$. A direct computation using the recursive definition with memoization (a form of dynamic programming) is required, as a simple closed-form evaluation is complex. The state space is a 3D grid, and we fill it according to the recurrence relation $f(i,j,k) = f(i-1,j,k) + f(i,j-1,k) + f(i,j,k-1)$ with the given boundary conditions.\n    The calculation yields $f(2,4,5) = 990$.\n\n*   **f(9000, 9000, 9000):**\n    This value corresponds to the case where all arguments are equal, $f(a,a, \\ldots, a)$. The number of paths from $(a, a, \\ldots, a)$ to the origin within the specified wedge is given by the $n$-dimensional Catalan number, denoted $C_a^{(n)}$. For $f(9000, 9000, 9000)$, we have $n=3$ and $a=9000$. The formula for the $(n+1)$-dimensional Catalan number is $C_a^{(n+1)} = \\frac{1}{na+1} \\binom{(n+1)a}{a}$.\n    In this case, the value is:\n    $C_{9000}^{(3+1)} = \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 9000 + 1} \\binom{(3+1) \\cdot 9000}{9000} = \\frac{1}{27001} \\binom{36000}{9000}$.\n    This is an exceedingly large number.\n\n*   **f(p, p, p, p) mod p for the prime number p = 10‚Åπ + 7:**\n    Here we need to calculate the value of $f(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4)$ where $n=4$ and $a_1=a_2=a_3=a_4=p$. We use the same generalized Catalan number formula as in the previous case. We are asked to compute $C_p^{(4+1)} \\pmod p$.\n    $C_p^{(5)} = \\frac{1}{4p+1} \\binom{5p}{p}$.\n    To evaluate this modulo $p$, we analyze the terms:\n    $4p+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$.\n    For the binomial coefficient $\\binom{5p}{p}$, we use Lucas's Theorem. For a prime $p$, $\\binom{np}{kp} \\equiv \\binom{n}{k} \\pmod p$.\n    So, $\\binom{5p}{p} \\equiv \\binom{5}{1} \\pmod p = 5$.\n    Combining these results, we get:\n    $f(p,p,p,p) \\pmod p \\equiv \\frac{1}{1} \\cdot 5 \\pmod p = 5$.\n\nThe calculated values are:\n990, $\\frac{1}{27001}\\binom{36000}{9000}$, 5\n\n<<<990, $\\frac{1}{27001}\\binom{36000}{9000}$, 5>>>"
