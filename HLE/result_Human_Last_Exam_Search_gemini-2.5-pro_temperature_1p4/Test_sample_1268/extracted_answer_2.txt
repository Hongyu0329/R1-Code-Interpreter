The upper bound for the maximum norm $(k_{k,\infty})$ in relation to the covolume $(V)$ is not a fixed constant but a function of $V$. While a simple, universal formula is not established, the asymptotic relationship is known. Without assuming any unproven hypotheses, the maximum order is bounded by a polynomial in the covolume, $V^C$, where the constant $C$ depends on the ambient Lie group. However, under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, a much tighter, poly-logarithmic upper bound of the form $(\log V)^C$ is expected. This is considered to be nearly optimal, as there exist sequences of arithmetic lattices for which the maximal order of torsion elements grows as $\frac{\log V}{\log \log V}$.
