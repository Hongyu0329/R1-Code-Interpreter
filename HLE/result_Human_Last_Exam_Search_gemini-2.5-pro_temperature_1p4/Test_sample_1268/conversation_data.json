    "In the context of arithmetic lattices, the relationship between the maximum order of torsion elements and the covolume is a subject of ongoing research. While a single, universally agreed-upon formula for the upper bound may not exist in a simple closed form, there are significant results, particularly from the work of Gelander and Slutsky, that describe the asymptotic behavior of this relationship.\n\nFor an arithmetic lattice $\\Gamma$ in a semi-simple Lie group $G$, let $k_{max}$ be the maximum order of a torsion element, and let $V$ be the covolume of $\\Gamma$, i.e., the volume of the quotient space $G/\\Gamma$. The research in this area provides bounds on the index of a torsion-free subgroup of $\\Gamma$, which in turn provides an upper bound for $k_{max}$.\n\nKey findings regarding the upper bound are:\n\n*   **Polynomial Bound:** For any arithmetic lattice $\\Gamma$ in a semi-simple Lie group $H$, it contains a torsion-free normal subgroup $\\Delta$ such that the index $[\\Gamma : \\Delta]$ is bounded by a polynomial in the covolume $V$. Specifically, the bound is of the form $[\\Gamma : \\Delta] \\leq V^{c \\dim H}$, where $c$ is a constant depending on the Lie group $H$. Since the order of any torsion element must divide this index, $k_{max}$ is also bounded by this polynomial in the covolume.\n\n*   **Poly-logarithmic Bound (under GRH):** Assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), a much stronger, poly-logarithmic bound on the index of a torsion-free subgroup has been established: $[\\Gamma : \\Delta] \\leq c(\\log V)^{(2+\\varepsilon) \\dim H}$ for any $\\varepsilon > 0$ and a constant $c$ that depends on the group $H$ and $\\varepsilon$. This implies a poly-logarithmic upper bound for $k_{max}$.\n\n*   **Near-Optimal Lower Bound:** To show that the poly-logarithmic bound is nearly optimal, Gelander and Slutsky have constructed specific arithmetic lattices that contain torsion elements of a very large order. The order of these torsion elements is asymptotically $\\frac{\\log V}{\\log \\log V}$. This result indicates that a general upper bound for $k_{max}$ in terms of $V$ cannot be of a smaller order of magnitude than logarithmic.\n\nThe condition that the natural number $N$ is squarefree typically refers to the level of a congruence subgroup, such as $\\Gamma_0(N)$. The covolume of these groups is a function of $N$ (for $\\Gamma_0(N) \\subset PSL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, the covolume is proportional to $N\\prod_{p|N}(1+1/p)$). Thus, as $N$ (and consequently the covolume $V$) grows, these asymptotic bounds apply.\n\nIn summary, there isn't a simple numerical upper bound, but rather a functional one that depends on the covolume. The upper bound for the maximum order of torsion elements ($k_{max}$) in relation to the covolume ($V$) is known to be at most polynomial in $V$ and is conjectured (under GRH) to be poly-logarithmic in $V$. The existence of lattices with torsion orders of $\\frac{\\log V}{\\log \\log V}$ demonstrates that this logarithmic growth is a key feature of the relationship.\n\n<<<The upper bound for the maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$ in relation to the covolume $(V)$ is not a fixed constant but a function of $V$. While a simple, universal formula is not established, the asymptotic relationship is known. Without assuming any unproven hypotheses, the maximum order is bounded by a polynomial in the covolume, $V^C$, where the constant $C$ depends on the ambient Lie group. However, under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, a much tighter, poly-logarithmic upper bound of the form $(\\log V)^C$ is expected. This is considered to be nearly optimal, as there exist sequences of arithmetic lattices for which the maximal order of torsion elements grows as $\\frac{\\log V}{\\log \\log V}$.>>>"
