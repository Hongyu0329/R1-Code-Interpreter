    "To find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) in a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using a 6-31G** basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the total number of electrons (N)** in the molecule.\n2.  **Determine the total number of basis functions (K)**, which corresponds to the number of molecular orbitals, for the 6-31G** basis set.\n3.  **Use the appropriate formula** to calculate the number of CSFs for a singlet state (S=0), which is the most common ground state for such a molecule.\n\n### **Step 1: Number of Electrons (N)**\n\nThe molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ contains the following atoms: one Carbon (C), three Hydrogens (H), one Silicon (Si), and one Fluorine (F). The number of electrons for each atom is:\n*   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n*   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron per atom (x3) = 3 electrons\n*   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n*   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n\nThe total number of electrons is N = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = **32**. For a singlet state (S=0), the number of alpha electrons equals the number of beta electrons, so $N_\\alpha = N_\\beta = N/2 = 16$.\n\n### **Step 2: Number of Basis Functions (K)**\n\nThe 6-31G** basis set is also known as 6-31G(d,p). This means it's a split-valence basis set with d-type polarization functions on heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and p-type polarization functions on hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H):** The 6-31G part gives 2 basis functions. The `**` adds one set of p-type polarization functions (3 orbitals). Total per H = 2 + 3 = **5**.\n*   **For Carbon (C):** As a second-row atom, it has 9 basis functions in 6-31G. The `**` adds one set of d-type polarization functions (6 orbitals). Total for C = 9 + 6 = **15**.\n*   **For Fluorine (F):** Similar to Carbon, it is a second-row atom. Total for F = 9 + 6 = **15**.\n*   **For Silicon (Si):** As a third-row atom, it has 13 basis functions in 6-31G. The `**` adds one set of d-type polarization functions (6 orbitals). Total for Si = 13 + 6 = **19**.\n\nThe total number of basis functions (K) for the molecule is:\nK = (1 × 15) + (3 × 5) + (1 × 19) + (1 × 15) = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = **64**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculation of the Number of CSFs**\n\nThe number of singlet (S=0) CSFs for a full CI calculation is given by the formula:\n\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{K+1} \\binom{K+1}{N/2} \\binom{K+1}{N/2+1}$\n\nPlugging in the values N = 32 and K = 64:\n\n*   $N/2 = 16$\n*   $K+1 = 65$\n\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{65} \\binom{65}{16} \\binom{65}{17}$\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients:\n*   $\\binom{65}{16} = 61,306,894,013,475$\n*   $\\binom{65}{17} = 177,402,325,754,525$\n\nNow, we compute the final number:\n\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{61,306,894,013,475 \\times 177,402,325,754,525}{65}$\n\n$N_{CSF} = 167,362,942,426,618,151,828,7825$\n\nThis calculation demonstrates the immense computational cost of Full CI methods, which scales factorially with the size of the system.\n\n<<<1673629424266181518287825>>>"
