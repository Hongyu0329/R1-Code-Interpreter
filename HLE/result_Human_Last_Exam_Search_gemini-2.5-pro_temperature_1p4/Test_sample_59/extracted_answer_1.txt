The probability to draw a link \(y_{ij}\) between nodes i and j in a jointly exchangeable random graph is given by \(W(U_i, U_j)\), where W is a symmetric measurable function from \(^2\) to \(\) called a graphon, and \(U_i\) and \(U_j\) are independent and identically distributed random variables from a uniform distribution on \(\). The graphon W is determined by the random measure F.
