    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in several different colors. The main allotropes of phosphorus are white, red, violet, and black phosphorus, with another form, diphosphorus, existing as a gas. Each of these can exhibit one or more distinct colors.\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** This allotrope is a translucent, waxy solid that is typically white when pure. However, upon exposure to light, it can gradually turn yellow, and is often referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** As its name suggests, red phosphorus has a deep red color. It can also be described as having a reddish-violet hue.\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this allotrope is violet or purple. Under certain conditions, it can form brown transparent plates. Some descriptions also mention a steely blue luster, though this refers more to its appearance than its fundamental color.\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most stable form of phosphorus and has a black, flaky appearance, similar to graphite.\n\n*   **Diphosphorus:** This allotrope exists as a gas at high temperatures. While its color is not explicitly stated in the search results, it is reasonable to infer that it is colorless, as is common for simple diatomic gases. For instance, the related compound diphosphorus tetrafluoride is a colorless gas.\n\nCounting the distinct colors from these allotropes, we have:\n\n1.  White\n2.  Yellow\n3.  Red\n4.  Violet/Purple\n5.  Brown\n6.  Black\n7.  Colorless\n\nTherefore, seven distinct colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n<<<7>>>"
