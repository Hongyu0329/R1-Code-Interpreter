    "To find an analytical expression that approximates the solution of the given third-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for large values of $x$, we first analyze the equation:\n$y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\nwith initial conditions at $x = 0$: $y(0) = 0.00$, $y'(0) = 3.00$, $y''(0) = 2.00.$\n\nThe initial conditions, particularly $y'(0)=3$ and $y''(0)=2$, suggest that the solution will initially grow. Let's evaluate the third derivative at $x=0$:\n$y'''(0) = y(0)^4 + y'(0)^4 - \\frac{y''(0)}{3(0)^2 + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan(0) + 1}$\n$y'''(0) = 0^4 + 3^4 - \\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{1}{0+1} = 81 - 1 + 1 = 81$.\nSince $y'(0), y''(0), y'''(0)$ are all positive, the solution will start to grow rapidly. This suggests that for large $x$, the terms involving $y$ and its derivatives will become very large.\n\nLet's assume the solution grows sufficiently fast such that the terms $y^4$ and/or $(y')^4$ dominate the equation. For large $x$, the term $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$ is likely to become negligible compared to the polynomial terms in $y$ and $y'$, provided $y$ grows faster than a certain power of $x$. The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$ is a bounded, oscillating function (except at its singularities). For a rapidly growing solution, this $O(1)$ term is also expected to be negligible.\n\nThis leads to the approximate autonomous equation for large $x$:\n$y''' \\approx y^4 + (y')^4$\n\nSuch non-linear equations often lead to solutions that blow up in finite time, i.e., $y(x) \\to \\infty$ as $x \\to x_0$ for some finite $x_0$. The \"large $x$ regime\" can be interpreted as the behavior of the solution as $x$ approaches this singularity time $x_0$.\n\nLet's look for a solution of the form $y(x) \\sim c(x_0 - x)^\\alpha$ near the singularity.\nThe derivatives are:\n$y'(x) \\sim -c\\alpha(x_0-x)^{\\alpha-1}$\n$y''(x) \\sim c\\alpha(\\alpha-1)(x_0-x)^{\\alpha-2}$\n$y'''(x) \\sim -c\\alpha(\\alpha-1)(\\alpha-2)(x_0-x)^{\\alpha-3}$\n\nThe terms in the approximated ODE behave as:\n$y^4 \\sim (x_0-x)^{4\\alpha}$\n$(y')^4 \\sim (x_0-x)^{4\\alpha-4}$\n\nFor any value of $\\alpha$, the exponent $4\\alpha-4$ is smaller than $4\\alpha$. This means that as $x \\to x_0$, the term $(y')^4$ is always more singular (dominant) than the $y^4$ term. Therefore, the dominant balance in the equation is between $y'''$ and $(y')^4$:\n$y''' \\approx (y')^4$\n\nLet's check if this is self-consistent by comparing the powers of the leading terms with those of the neglected terms in the original ODE. Substituting the power law form into the dominant terms:\n$-c\\alpha(\\alpha-1)(\\alpha-2)(x_0-x)^{\\alpha-3} \\approx (-c\\alpha)^4 (x_0-x)^{4\\alpha-4}$\n\nFor the powers to match:\n$\\alpha-3 = 4\\alpha-4 \\implies 3\\alpha = 1 \\implies \\alpha = 1/3$.\n\nNow we balance the coefficients with $\\alpha=1/3$:\n$-c(\\frac{1}{3})(\\frac{1}{3}-1)(\\frac{1}{3}-2) = (-c(\\frac{1}{3}))^4$\n$-c(\\frac{1}{3})(-\\frac{2}{3})(-\\frac{5}{3}) = \\frac{c^4}{81}$\n$-\\frac{10c}{27} = \\frac{c^4}{81}$\nAssuming $c \\neq 0$, we get $c^3 = -\\frac{10 \\cdot 81}{27} = -10 \\cdot 3 = -30$.\n\nSo, the behavior of the solution near the singularity $x_0$ is given by $y(x) = C_y + c(x_0-x)^{1/3}$, where $c = (-\\sqrt{30})$ and $C_y$ is the limiting value of $y(x)$ as $x \\to x_0$. Let's call the constant $c$ as $B$, so $B = -\\sqrt{30}$.\nThe full form of the solution near the singularity is $y(x) = C_y + B(x_0-x)^{1/3}$.\n\nThe value of the constants $C_y$ and $x_0$ are determined by the initial conditions.\nWe have $y(x) = C_y + B(x_0-x)^{1/3}$ and its derivative $y'(x) = -\\frac{B}{3}(x_0-x)^{-2/3}$.\n\nLet's use the initial conditions at $x=0$:\n1. $y(0) = 0 \\implies 0 = C_y + Bx_0^{1/3}$\n2. $y'(0) = 3 \\implies 3 = -\\frac{B}{3}(x_0-x)^{-2/3}|_{x=0} = -\\frac{B}{3}x_0^{-2/3}$\n\nFrom (2), we can express $B$ in terms of $x_0$:\n$B = -9x_0^{2/3}$.\n\nNow, we use the known value of $B^3 = -30$:\n$B^3 = (-9x_0^{2/3})^3 = (-9)^3 (x_0^{2/3})^3 = -729 x_0^2$.\nSo, $-729x_0^2 = -30 \\implies x_0^2 = \\frac{30}{729} = \\frac{10}{243}$.\nThis gives a real and finite time for the singularity, $x_0 = \\sqrt{10/243}$.\n\nNow we can find the value of the constant $C_y$, which is the asymptotic value of the solution as $x \\to x_0$. From equation (1):\n$C_y = -Bx_0^{1/3}$\nSubstitute $B = -9x_0^{2/3}$:\n$C_y = -(-9x_0^{2/3})x_0^{1/3} = 9x_0$.\nUsing the value for $x_0$:\n$C_y = 9 \\sqrt{\\frac{10}{243}} = 9 \\sqrt{\\frac{10}{81 \\cdot 3}} = 9 \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{9\\sqrt{3}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10}{3}}$.\n\nThe analytical expression that approximates the solution in the large $x$ regime (as $x \\to x_0$) is the constant value $y(x) \\approx C_y = \\sqrt{10/3}$.\n\nNow we calculate the numerical value and round it to two decimal places:\n$C_y = \\sqrt{10/3} \\approx \\sqrt{3.3333...} \\approx 1.82574...$\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $1.83$.\n\nFinal check of consistency: The derived asymptotic form $y(x) \\approx C_y$ must be consistent with the approximation $y''' \\approx (y')^4$.\nAs $x \\to x_0$:\n$y(x) \\to C_y = \\sqrt{10/3}$ (finite constant).\n$y'(x) \\sim (x_0-x)^{-2/3} \\to \\infty$.\n$y''(x) \\sim (x_0-x)^{-5/3} \\to \\infty$.\n$y'''(x) \\sim (x_0-x)^{-8/3} \\to \\infty$.\nThe terms in the original ODE have the following orders of magnitude near the singularity:\n$y''' \\sim (x_0-x)^{-8/3}$\n$y^4 \\to C_y^4$ (constant)\n$(y')^4 \\sim (x_0-x)^{-8/3}$\n$\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2} \\sim \\frac{(x_0-x)^{-5/3}}{3x_0^2+2} \\sim (x_0-x)^{-5/3}$\n$\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$ is $O(1)$.\nThe dominant terms are $y'''$ and $(y')^4$, which are of order $(x_0-x)^{-8/3}$. All other terms are smaller as $x \\to x_0$. The approximation holds.\n\nThe analytical expression is $y(x) \\approx \\sqrt{10/3}$.\n\n<<<1.83>>>"
