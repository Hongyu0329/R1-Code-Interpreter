    "Let the matrix representing the flag of Tonga be denoted by `A`. The entries of this matrix are `a` for red pixels and `b` for white pixels. The question asks for the maximal possible rank of `A`. The rank depends on the values of `a` and `b`, and the pixel resolution of the flag. We are free to choose these to maximize the rank.\n\nThe flag of Tonga has a red field with a white canton in the upper hoist (top-left) corner. The canton itself contains a red couped cross. A couped cross is one that does not extend to the edges of the canton.\n\nLet the matrix `A` have `m` rows and `n` columns. Let the canton occupy the top-left submatrix of size `m_c x n_c`. Let this submatrix be `B`. The rest of the matrix `A` corresponds to the red field, so all its entries are `a`. The matrix `A` has the following block structure:\n`A = [[B, aJ], [aJ, aJ]]`\nwhere `J` denotes a matrix of all ones of the appropriate size.\n\nTo find the rank of `A`, we can perform row and column operations. Let's assume `a` is not zero. We can subtract the last row of `A` (which is `(a, a, ..., a)`) from all other rows. The last `m - m_c` rows become zero rows. For `i <= m_c`, row `i` of `A` becomes `[(row i of B) - a*j, 0]`, where `j` is an all-ones vector of length `n_c`. This operation shows that the rank of `A` is `1 + rank(B - aJ)`, where the `+1` comes from the last row we subtracted (assuming `a != 0`).\n\nThe matrix `B - aJ` represents the canton. The red pixels of the cross in `B` have the value `a`, so they become `a - a = 0` in `B - aJ`. The white pixels in the canton have the value `b`, so they become `b - a` in `B - aJ`. If we assume `a != b`, the rank of `B - aJ` is the same as the rank of a binary matrix, let's call it `C'`, where the red cross is represented by zeros and the white field by ones.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximal possible rank of this canton matrix `C'`. The total rank of the flag matrix `A` will be `1 + rank(C')`. If we chose `a=0`, the rank of `A` would be `rank(C')`. To maximize the rank, we choose `a!=0` and `a!=b`.\n\nThe matrix `C'` consists of ones everywhere except for a cross-shaped pattern of zeros, and since the cross is couped, the border of `C'` consists entirely of ones. We can establish a relationship between the rank of `C'` and the rank of the matrix representing the cross itself (`Cross`), which is 1 where the cross is and 0 elsewhere.\nThe matrix `C'` is the all-ones matrix `J` minus the `Cross` matrix: `C' = J - Cross`.\nSince the cross is couped, the `Cross` matrix has at least one all-zero row and one all-zero column (at the borders). Let the first row of `C'` be an all-ones vector `j`, which is a valid assumption as we can define the pixel grid to have a border of white pixels within the canton. The row `j` is in the row space of `C'`. Also, any row `x_i` of the `Cross` matrix can be written as `x_i = j - r_i`, where `r_i` is the corresponding row of `C'`. This implies that the row space of `Cross` is a subspace of the row space of `C'`. Therefore, the row space of `C'` contains both `j` and the row space of `Cross`.\n\nSince the `Cross` matrix has an all-zero column, the vector `j` is linearly independent of the rows of `Cross`. This leads to the conclusion that `rank(C') = 1 + rank(Cross)`.\n\nThe final step is to determine the maximal possible rank of the `Cross` matrix. The `Cross` matrix is a binary matrix with a cross shape. A cross is formed by the union of a horizontal bar and a vertical bar. We can model the cross with enough detail to have three distinct non-zero row patterns:\n1.  Rows that are part of the horizontal bar but not the vertical bar (`v_h`).\n2.  Rows that are part of the vertical bar but not the horizontal bar (`v_v`).\n3.  Rows that are part of the intersection of both bars (`v_hv`).\n\nThese three types of row vectors can be shown to be linearly independent. By constructing a sufficiently large and detailed cross, we can ensure that all three types of rows are present in the `Cross` matrix. For example, a cross where the central intersecting square is thicker than the arms will exhibit these features. The row space of the `Cross` matrix is spanned by these three vectors, so its maximum rank is 3.\n\nWith `max rank(Cross) = 3`, we can calculate the maximal ranks for `C'` and `A`:\n*   `max rank(C') = 1 + max rank(Cross) = 1 + 3 = 4`.\n*   `max rank(A) = 1 + max rank(C') = 1 + 4 = 5`.\n\nThis is the highest possible rank. It requires a specific but achievable structure for the flag's pixel matrix and appropriate choices for `a` and `b` (e.g., `a=1, b=2`).\n\n<<<5>>>"
