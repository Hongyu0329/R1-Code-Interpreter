The one-step transformation of the probability distribution is given by $P_i(t+1) = \frac{1}{2} P_{i-1}(t) + \frac{1}{2} P_{i+1}(t)$, where indices are taken modulo N.

The transition probability matrix $\hat{A}$ has elements $A_{i,i-1} = 1/2$ and $A_{i,i+1} = 1/2$ (modulo N) and zeros elsewhere.

The eigenvectors are $v_n$ with components $(v_n)_j = e^{ijk_n}$ for $k_n = \frac{2\pi n}{N}$ and $n = 0, 1, ..., N-1$.

The corresponding eigenvalues are $\lambda_n = \cos\left(\frac{2\pi n}{N}\right)$.

The second-largest eigenvalue is $\lambda_1 = \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{N}\right)$.

The rate of relaxation is determined by this eigenvalue.
