    "To determine the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, a careful analysis of the molecule's structure and symmetry is required.\n\n### Structural Analysis:\n\n1.  **Central Core**: The molecule has a central 1,3,5-trisubstituted-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (a substituted mesitylene) core. This core possesses a C3 axis of rotational symmetry. This symmetry means that the three large substituents attached to the benzene ring at positions 1, 3, and 5 are chemically equivalent.\n\n2.  **Substituents**: Each of the three identical substituents consists of a benzylic methylene (-CH2-) linker attached to a large, chiral bicyclic system derived from camphor fused with a pyrazole ring ((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazole).\n\n### Predicting the 1H NMR Signals:\n\nWe only need to count the number of chemically non-equivalent protons in one of the three identical \"arms\" of the molecule and then add the signals from the central core.\n\n**Signals from the Central Mesitylene Core:**\n*   **Aromatic Methyl Protons**: The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 of the benzene ring are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. These 9 protons will produce a single peak. **(1 Peak)**\n\n**Signals from one of the three identical arms:**\n*   **Benzylic Methylene Protons (-CH2-)**: Each of the three equivalent linker groups contains two protons. Because this CH2 group is attached to a chiral center within the substituent, its two protons are diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will have different chemical shifts, typically appearing as a pair of doublets (an AB quartet). **(2 Peaks)**\n*   **Indazole Ring Proton**: The pyrazole part of the indazole system has one proton at the C3 position. This proton will give rise to a single signal. **(1 Peak)**\n*   **Camphor-derived Moiety**: This rigid bicyclic system is chiral and lacks internal symmetry.\n    *   **Methyl Groups**: There are three methyl groups. The two methyls at the C8 position are geminal and adjacent to the C7 chiral center, making them diastereotopic. The methyl group at C7 is unique. This results in three distinct signals for the methyl groups. **(3 Peaks)**\n    *   **Bridgehead Proton**: The single proton at the C4 bridgehead position is in a unique chemical environment. **(1 Peak)**\n    *   **Methylene Protons (C5 and C6)**: The camphor skeleton contains two CH2 groups at positions C5 and C6. Due to the rigid, chiral nature of the ring system, all four of these protons (endo- and exo- at C5, endo- and exo- at C6) are in different chemical environments and are thus non-equivalent. This is a common feature in the NMR spectra of camphor and its derivatives. This will result in four separate signals. **(4 Peaks)**\n\n### Summary of Peaks:\nAdding up the number of unique proton environments:\n*   From the central core methyls: 1\n*   From the benzylic linkers: 2\n*   From the indazole proton: 1\n*   From the camphor-moiety methyls: 3\n*   From the camphor-moiety bridgehead proton: 1\n*   From the camphor-moiety C5/C6 protons: 4\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 4 = **12 Peaks**\n\nTherefore, a total of 12 distinct signals are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<H>>>"
