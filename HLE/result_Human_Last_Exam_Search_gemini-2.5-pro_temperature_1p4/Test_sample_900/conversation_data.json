    "It is not publicly documented how many \"pas de Balanchine\" Svetlana Gileva performed in the Jete Woman solo of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" with the Semperoper Ballett in 2015.\n\nWhile it is confirmed that Svetlana Gileva danced this role during that period, and reviews of her performances are available, a detailed choreographic analysis or a video of that specific performance is not accessible to the public. The available reviews praise her technical skill and interpretation of the role but do not provide a step-by-step breakdown of the choreography.\n\nWilliam Forsythe is known for his deconstruction of classical ballet, and his choreography often modifies and reinterprets traditional steps. The very name of the solo, \"Jete Woman,\" suggests that the predominant and characteristic step is the *jet√©*, a type of leap. Without a visual record or a specific choreographic script, it is not possible to identify and count the number of \"pas de Balanchine,\" a distinct step with a specific technique, within the solo.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to the question.>>>"
