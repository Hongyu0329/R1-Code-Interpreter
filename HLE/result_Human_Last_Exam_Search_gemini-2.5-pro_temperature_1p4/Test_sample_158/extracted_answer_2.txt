The required permeability of the magnetic material in the shell to ensure no distortion of the external magnetic field is:
μ = -μ₀
where μ₀ is the permeability of free space. This corresponds to a relative permeability μ_r = -1.

Under this condition, the magnetic field in the interior region (ρ < R₁) is uniform and given by:
**H**_int = H₀ (R₂/R₁)², **x̂**
