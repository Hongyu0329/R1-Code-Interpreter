    "To find the number of stable equilibria, we first need to find the equilibrium points of the differential equation. Equilibrium points occur where the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$\n\nSet the right-hand side to zero to find the equilibria:\n$-x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0$\n\nWe can factor out a $-x$ from the expression:\n$-x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0$\n\nThe quadratic term is a perfect square:\n$-x(x - 1)^{2} = 0$\n\nThis equation gives us the equilibrium points at $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the stability of these equilibrium points. Let $f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$. An equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable if $f'(x^*) < 0$, and unstable if $f'(x^*) > 0$. If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the stability must be determined by analyzing the sign of $f(x)$ around the equilibrium point.\n\nLet's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x) = -3x^{2} + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, we evaluate the derivative at each equilibrium point:\n\n1.  **For the equilibrium point** $x = 0$:\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^{2} + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point at $x = 0$ is stable.\n\n2.  **For the equilibrium point** $x = 1$:\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^{2} + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must examine the behavior of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ around $x=1$.\n    *   For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 0.9$), $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9-1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.009$, which is negative. Since $x'(t) < 0$, the solution moves away from $x=1$ to the left.\n    *   For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1.1$), $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1-1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -0.011$, which is negative. Since $x'(t) < 0$, the solution moves towards $x=1$ from the right.\n\nAn equilibrium is considered stable only if trajectories from both sides converge to the equilibrium point. Since trajectories to the left of $x=1$ move away from it, the equilibrium at $x=1$ is not stable (it is considered semi-stable).\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$. The number of stable equilibria is $m = 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$, we get:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\n<<<$1 - 2^{4048}$>>>"
