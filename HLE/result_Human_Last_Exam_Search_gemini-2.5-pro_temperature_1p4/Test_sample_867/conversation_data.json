    "Despite extensive searching for a complete video of Svetlana Zakharova's performance in the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of \"Swan Lake\" choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, a publicly accessible video of the full Act II Odette variation could not be located. While some search results confirm the existence of a recording from January 25, 2014, and various reviews and short clips are available, none of these sources provide a definitive count of the *sissonne fermes* performed by Zakharova in this specific variation.\n\nChoreography, especially in a production by a renowned choreographer like Yuri Grigorovich, can have specific nuances and variations that can only be accurately assessed by viewing the performance itself. Without access to the complete and specific performance video, providing a precise number of the requested ballet step would be speculative.\n\nTherefore, a definitive answer to the question of how many *sissonne fermes* Svetlana Zakharova performed in the Act II Odette variation of the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre \"Swan Lake\" cannot be provided.\n\n<<<Unable to provide a definitive answer.>>>"
