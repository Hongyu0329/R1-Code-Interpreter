    "In the quantum mechanical framework, the spin-orbit coupling for a p-electron gives rise to a set of common eigenvalues for the total angular momentum squared operator, $J^2$, and the z-component of the total angular momentum operator, $J_z$. For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is *l* = 1, and the spin angular momentum quantum number is *s* = 1/2. The total angular momentum, **J**, is the sum of the orbital angular momentum, **L**, and the spin angular momentum, **S**.\n\nThe possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan series, ranging from |*l* - *s*| to *l* + *s* in integer steps. For a p-electron:\n\n*j* can take values from |1 - 1/2| to 1 + 1/2, which results in *j* = 1/2 and *j* = 3/2.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the $J^2$ and $J_z$ operators are given by:\n*   Eigenvalue of $J^2$ = *j*(*j* + 1)ħ²\n*   Eigenvalue of $J_z$ = *m*<sub>*j*</sub>ħ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant and *m*<sub>*j*</sub> is the total angular momentum projection quantum number, which can take values from -*j* to +*j* in integer steps.\n\nThis leads to two sets of common eigenvalues corresponding to the two possible values of *j*:\n\n**Case 1: j = 3/2**\n\n*   The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is (3/2)(3/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/2)(5/2)ħ² = **(15/4)ħ²**.\n*   The possible values for *m*<sub>*j*</sub> are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, and 3/2. Consequently, the eigenvalues of $J_z$ are **(-3/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, and (3/2)ħ**.\n\n**Case 2: j = 1/2**\n\n*   The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (1/2)(3/2)ħ² = **(3/4)ħ²**.\n*   The possible values for *m*<sub>*j*</sub> are -1/2 and 1/2. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $J_z$ are **(-1/2)ħ and (1/2)ħ**.\n\nThese sets of eigenvalues represent the quantized values of the square of the total angular momentum and its projection along the z-axis that a p-electron can possess due to spin-orbit coupling.\n\n<<<For a p-electron, the common eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$ are determined by the possible total angular momentum quantum numbers, *j*, which are *j* = 3/2 and *j* = 1/2.\n\nFor *j* = 3/2, the eigenvalue of $J^2$ is (15/4)ħ², and the eigenvalues of $J_z$ are (-3/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, and (3/2)ħ.\n\nFor *j* = 1/2, the eigenvalue of $J^2$ is (3/4)ħ², and the eigenvalues of $J_z$ are (-1/2)ħ and (1/2)ħ.>>>"
