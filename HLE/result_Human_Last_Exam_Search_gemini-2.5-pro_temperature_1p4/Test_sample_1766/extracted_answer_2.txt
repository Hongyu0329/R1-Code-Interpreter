For a p-electron, the common eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$ are determined by the possible total angular momentum quantum numbers, *j*, which are *j* = 3/2 and *j* = 1/2.

For *j* = 3/2, the eigenvalue of $J^2$ is (15/4)ħ², and the eigenvalues of $J_z$ are (-3/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, and (3/2)ħ.

For *j* = 1/2, the eigenvalue of $J^2$ is (3/4)ħ², and the eigenvalues of $J_z$ are (-1/2)ħ and (1/2)ħ.
