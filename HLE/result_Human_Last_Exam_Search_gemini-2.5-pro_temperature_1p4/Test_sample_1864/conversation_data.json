    "For a flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with five detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750), you should prepare a minimum of 14 essential controls. These controls are crucial for accurate instrument setup, compensation of spectral overlap, and correct gating for data analysis and sorting.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls:\n\n**1. Unstained Control (1 sample):**\n*   **Composition:** A sample containing your cells and the streptavidin beads without any fluorescent labels.\n*   **Purpose:** This control is fundamental for determining the baseline autofluorescence of both your cells and the beads. It helps in setting the initial voltage for the detectors on the flow cytometer.\n\n**2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls (6 samples):**\n*   **Composition:** Six separate samples, each stained with only one fluorescent dye. This includes one for each of your five main fluorophores and one for your viability dye.\n    *   AF350 only\n    *   GFP only\n    *   PE only\n    *   AF647 only\n    *   AF750 only\n    *   Viability dye only\n*   **Purpose:** In multicolor flow cytometry, the emission spectra of different fluorophores can overlap. These single-stain controls are absolutely essential to allow the flow cytometer software to mathematically correct for this spectral overlap in a process called compensation.\n\n**3. Viability Control (included in the 6 above):**\n*   **Composition:** A dye that stains dead cells.\n*   **Purpose:** Dead cells have a tendency to bind antibodies non-specifically and exhibit increased autofluorescence, which can lead to false positive results. Using a viability dye allows you to exclude these dead cells from your analysis, ensuring you are only looking at your healthy cell population of interest. A single-stain control for the viability dye is required for compensation.\n\n**4. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 samples):**\n*   **Composition:** Five separate samples where each one is stained with all the fluorophores in your panel *except for one*.\n    *   Minus AF350 (stained with GFP, PE, AF647, AF750, and viability dye)\n    *   Minus GFP (stained with AF350, PE, AF647, AF750, and viability dye)\n    *   Minus PE (stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, AF750, and viability dye)\n    *   Minus AF647 (stained with AF350, GFP, PE, AF750, and viability dye)\n    *   Minus AF750 (stained with AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and viability dye)\n*   **Purpose:** FMO controls are crucial for accurately setting the boundaries (gates) for positive and negative populations in a multicolor experiment. They reveal the spread of fluorescence from other channels into the channel of interest, which is critical for identifying dimly fluorescent populations correctly.\n\n**5. Biological Controls (at least 1 sample):**\n*   **Composition:** A sample of cells that are known to be negative for the markers you are analyzing, but are subjected to the full staining procedure.\n*   **Purpose:** This control helps to determine the level of background staining and ensures that the signals you observe are specific to the antigens of interest. A known positive control is also highly recommended to confirm that your staining protocol is working correctly.\n\n**6. Streptavidin Bead-Specific Control (1 sample):**\n*   **Composition:** A sample containing only the streptavidin beads mixed with all your fluorescently labeled antibodies (or other fluorescent reagents).\n*   **Purpose:** Since you are using streptavidin beads, it's important to ensure that your fluorescent reagents do not bind non-specifically to the beads themselves. This control checks for any unwanted interactions between the beads and your dyes that could create false positive signals.\n\nWhile the use of isotype controls can also be considered to assess non-specific antibody binding, their use is sometimes debated, and FMO controls are often considered a more robust alternative for setting gates.\n\n<<<14>>>"
