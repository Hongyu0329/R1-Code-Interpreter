    "To determine the symmetry factor associated with a Feynman diagram featuring two vertices and four field contractions in perturbative Green's function analysis, we must first establish the topology of the diagram. The description implies a second-order perturbation (two vertices). Assuming the context of a theory with a single type of interaction vertex, such as the common `φ⁴` theory, each vertex provides four \"half-lines\" or field operators.\n\nWith two vertices, we have a total of eight half-lines. The \"four field contractions\" correspond to four internal propagators. Since each propagator uses two half-lines, the four propagators account for all eight half-lines (`4 * 2 = 8`). This means the diagram has no external lines and is therefore a vacuum diagram.\n\nThere are two possible connected topologies for such a diagram in `φ⁴` theory:\n1.  A diagram where the two vertices are connected directly by the four propagators. This is sometimes called a \"setting-sun\" type diagram.\n2.  A \"figure-eight\" diagram where each vertex has one loop (a propagator starting and ending on the same vertex), and the two vertices are connected by the remaining two propagators.\n\nThe phrasing \"a Feynman diagram featuring two vertices and four field contractions\" can be interpreted as describing the relationship between the two vertices, suggesting that the four contractions all serve to connect them. This points towards the first topology.\n\nThe symmetry factor, `S`, for a Feynman diagram is the order of the group of automorphisms of the graph, which represents the number of permutations of its internal lines and vertices that leave the diagram topologically unchanged. A common method for calculating it involves considering the symmetries from interchanging vertices and interchanging propagators.\n\nFor the topology where two vertices are connected by four propagators:\n*   **Vertex Permutations:** The two vertices are of the same type (from the same interaction term in the Lagrangian). Swapping their positions leaves the diagram unchanged. This contributes a factor of 2.\n*   **Propagator Permutations:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are identical. They can be permuted in `4!` ways without changing the diagram's structure. This contributes a factor of `4! = 24`.\n\nThe total symmetry factor is the product of these individual symmetry factors.\n\nS = (Factor from vertex permutation) × (Factor from line permutation)\nS = 2 × 4!\nS = 2 × 24\nS = 48\n\nThis result can be confirmed by considering the combinatorial factors that arise in the perturbative expansion. The contribution of a diagram is proportional to `(1/n!) * (1/(k!)ⁿ) * C`, where `n` is the order of the perturbation (number of vertices), `k` is the number of fields in the interaction (`k=4` for `φ⁴` theory), and `C` is the number of Wick contractions that form the specific diagram. The inverse of this prefactor is the symmetry factor. For this topology, the calculation yields a factor of 1/48, confirming that S=48.\n\nFor completeness, the symmetry factor for the \"figure-eight\" topology is 8. This is derived from a factor of 2 for swapping the two vertices, a factor of 2! for swapping the two propagators that connect the vertices, and a factor of 2 for each of the two loops. However, the description in the query is a more direct representation of the topology with S=48.\n\n<<<48>>>"
