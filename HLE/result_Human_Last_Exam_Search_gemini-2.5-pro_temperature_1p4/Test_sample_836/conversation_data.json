    "In the nuclear criticality community, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly referred to as the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** or **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)**, often with the qualifier \"space-dependent\".\n\nHere's a breakdown of the terminology:\n\n*   **Generalized Pair Correlation Function:** In the context of nuclear reactor physics, this function describes the correlation between the neutron population (or detector counts) at two different points in space and two different moments in time. It is also frequently called the **covariance function**.\n\n*   **Fourier Transform:** The analysis of fluctuations in the neutron field, known as \"neutron noise analysis,\" is typically performed in the frequency domain.\n\n    *   The temporal Fourier transform of the **autocorrelation function** (where the two spatial points are the same) is the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** or **Auto-Power Spectral Density (APSD)**. This function describes the power distribution of the neutron fluctuations as a function of frequency.\n\n    *   The temporal Fourier transform of the **cross-correlation function** (between two different spatial points) is the **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)**. This provides information about the spatial propagation of neutron waves and the correlation between different regions of the reactor core.\n\nWhile the theoretical framework involves a double Fourier transform over both space and time, the common terminology in the nuclear criticality and reactor noise community focuses on the frequency spectrum of the temporal correlations. The spatial dependence is then explicitly stated, for example, as the \"space-dependent power spectral density\". In many practical applications, the spatial aspect is investigated by analyzing the CPSD between detectors at various locations within the reactor.\n\n<<<Power Spectral Density (PSD) or Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)>>>"
