    "The parametric curve is defined in two parts.\n\n**Part 1: For the interval $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\nThe equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\nThis is the standard parametrization of the upper half of a unit circle.\n*   The x-values range from $\\cos(0) = 1$ to $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$.\n*   The y-values range from $\\sin(0) = 0$ up to $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$ and back down to $\\sin(\\pi) = 0$.\nSo, for this part, the maximum y-value is 1.\n\n**Part 2: For the interval $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\nThe equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\nThis can be seen as the lower half of an ellipse defined by the equation $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = 1$.\n*   The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi) = 1$.\n*   The y-values are given by $5\\sin t$. Since $\\sin t$ ranges from 0 to -1 and back to 0 in this interval, the y-values range from $5\\sin(\\pi) = 0$ down to $5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = -5$ and back to $5\\sin(2\\pi) = 0$.\nSo, for this part, the minimum y-value is -5.\n\n**Overall Dimensions of the Figure**\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we need to find the overall width and height of the figure.\n*   **Width:** The x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos t$ for the entire duration $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The minimum value of $\\cos t$ is -1 and the maximum value is 1. Therefore, the total width of the figure is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **Height:** Combining both parts, the y-values range from the minimum of -5 to the maximum of 1. Therefore, the total height of the figure is $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**The Smallest Enclosing Square**\nThe figure fits within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. The smallest square that can enclose this rectangle must have a side length equal to the larger of these two dimensions.\nSide length of the square = $\\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Area of the Square**\nThe area of a square is the side length squared.\nArea = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>The parametric curve is defined in two parts.\n\n**Part 1: For the interval $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\nThe equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\nThis is the standard parametrization of the upper half of a unit circle.\n*   The x-values range from $\\cos(0) = 1$ to $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$.\n*   The y-values range from $\\sin(0) = 0$ up to $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$ and back down to $\\sin(\\pi) = 0$.\nSo, for this part, the maximum y-value is 1.\n\n**Part 2: For the interval $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\nThe equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\nThis can be seen as the lower half of an ellipse defined by the equation $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = 1$.\n*   The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi) = 1$.\n*   The y-values are given by $5\\sin t$.
