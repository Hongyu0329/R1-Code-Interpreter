    "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of squares on the edge of a chessboard. A standard 8x8 chessboard has 64 squares in total. The edge squares consist of all the squares in the first and last rows and the first and last columns. This amounts to 8 squares on the top row, 8 on the bottom, and 6 on each of the side columns (as the corners have already been accounted for), giving a total of 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 edge squares.\n\nNext, we must find the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on these edge squares without any of them attacking one another. The problem of placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on a chessboard is a well-known mathematical puzzle. For an n x n board, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops is 2n - 2. For a standard 8x8 board, this means the maximum is 2 * 8 - 2 = 14 bishops.\n\nIt has been shown that for a maximum placement of 14 bishops, all of them must be positioned on the edge squares of the board. One possible arrangement for this involves placing seven bishops on the light-colored edge squares and seven on the dark-colored edge squares. For instance, seven non-attacking bishops can be placed on the light squares b1, d1, f1, h1, c8, e8, and g8. A corresponding set of seven non-attacking bishops can be placed on the dark squares a1, c1, e1, g1, b8, d8, and f8. This fulfills the condition of placing the maximum number of bishops on the edge squares.\n\nFinally, to find the number of edge squares that would not have a bishop, we subtract the number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares.\n\nTotal edge squares: 28\nNumber of bishops placed: 14\nEdge squares without bishops: 28 - 14 = 14.\n\nTherefore, if two people succeeded in placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares of a chessboard, 14 edge squares would be left empty.\n\n<<<14>>>"
