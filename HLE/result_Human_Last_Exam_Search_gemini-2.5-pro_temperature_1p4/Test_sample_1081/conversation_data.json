    "Let $G$ be a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is a well-established result in the theory of finite groups of Lie type.\n\nA reductive group of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is uniquely determined up to isomorphism. This is because the Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms, which implies that the corresponding algebraic group is split and has no twisted forms. The resulting finite group is the Chevalley group of type $E_8$, denoted as $E_8(q)$.\n\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a connected reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the prime-to-$p$ part of the order of the group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, where $p$ is the characteristic of $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This number can also be calculated as the ratio of the order of the group to the order of the unipotent radical of a Borel subgroup, $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|/|U(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$.\n\nThe order of the finite group of Lie type $E_8(q)$ is given by the formula:\n$|E_8(q)| = q^{120}(q^2 - 1)(q^8 - 1)(q^{12} - 1)(q^{14} - 1)(q^{18} - 1)(q^{20} - 1)(q^{24} - 1)(q^{30} - 1)$.\n\nThe term $q^{120}$ corresponds to the order of the unipotent radical of a Borel subgroup, where 120 is the number of positive roots in the $E_8$ root system.\n\nTherefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in $G$ is obtained by dividing the total order of the group by $q^{120}$.\n\nThe exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is:\n$(q^2 - 1)(q^8 - 1)(q^{12} - 1)(q^{14} - 1)(q^{18} - 1)(q^{20} - 1)(q^{24} - 1)(q^{30} - 1)$.\n\nThe exponents in this product (2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30) are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group of type $E_8$.\n\n<<<$(q^2 - 1)(q^8 - 1)(q^{12} - 1)(q^{14} - 1)(q^{18} - 1)(q^{20} - 1)(q^{24} - 1)(q^{30} - 1)$>>>"
