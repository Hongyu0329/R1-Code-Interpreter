    "To calculate a left coprime factorization of the transfer function\n\\[\nH(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nwe need to find two matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy the following conditions:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$.\n2.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are stable and proper rational function matrices. This means all their elements have poles only in the open left-half of the complex plane, and the degree of the numerator of each element is no greater than the degree of its denominator.\n3.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. This means that there exist stable and proper matrices $U(s)$ and $V(s)$ such that the Bezout identity $D(s)U(s) + N(s)V(s) = I$ is satisfied. A practical test for this is to check if the compound matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all $s$ in the closed right-half plane (including infinity).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the unstable poles of H(s)**\n\nFirst, we write out the elements of $H(s)$ and identify their poles:\n*   $h_{11}(s) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}$: The pole is at $s = -1$, which is stable.\n*   $h_{12}(s) = 1$: No poles. Stable.\n*   $h_{21}(s) = \\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)}$: The poles are at $s = 1$ and $s = -1$. The pole at $s=1$ is unstable.\n*   $h_{22}(s) = 0$: No poles. Stable.\n\nThe only unstable pole in the system is at $s=1$, located in the element $h_{21}(s)$.\n\n**Step 2: Construct a suitable D(s) matrix**\n\nOur goal is to find a $D(s)$ such that $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$ is stable. To achieve this, $D(s)$ must \"cancel\" the unstable pole at $s=1$ in $h_{21}(s)$. We can try a diagonal matrix for $D(s)$ for simplicity:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & 0 \\\\ 0 & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThen, $N(s)$ becomes:\n\\[\nN(s) = D(s)H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} & d_{11}(s) \\\\ d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nFor $N(s)$ to be stable, the element $n_{21}(s) = d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)}$ must be stable. This requires $d_{22}(s)$ to have a zero at $s=1$ to cancel the unstable pole. A simple choice for $d_{22}(s)$ that is stable and proper is the Blaschke factor that maps the unstable pole to a zero:\n\\[\nd_{22}(s) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}\n\\]\nThis function is stable (pole at $s=-1$) and proper.\n\nFor the first row, we can choose the simplest possible stable and proper function for $d_{11}(s)$, which is $d_{11}(s) = 1$.\nSo, our candidate for $D(s)$ is:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis matrix $D(s)$ is stable and proper. Its determinant, $\\det(D(s)) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}$, is not identically zero, so it is invertible.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate N(s)**\n\nNow we compute $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\cdot \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe matrix $N(s)$ is also stable and proper, as its elements have poles only at $s=-1$ and are all proper rational functions.\n\n**Step 4: Verify coprimeness**\n\nWe need to check that $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. We examine the rank of the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ for all $s$ in the closed right-half plane and at $s=\\infty$.\n\\[\n[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe rank of this $2 \\times 4$ matrix is less than 2 if and only if all its $2 \\times 2$ minors are zero.\nLet's consider the minor formed by columns 1 and 3:\n\\[\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2}\n\\]\nThis determinant is non-zero for any finite value of $s \\neq -1$. Therefore, the rank of the matrix is 2 for all $s$ in the closed right-half plane.\n\nNow let's check at $s=\\infty$:\nAs $s \\to \\infty$, $\\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\to 1$ and $\\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} \\to 0$.\n\\[\n[D(\\infty) \\quad N(\\infty)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe rows $$ and $$ are linearly independent, so the rank is 2.\nSince the rank is 2 for all $s$ in the closed right-half plane and at infinity, the factorization is left coprime.\n\nWe have found a left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$, where:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n<<<\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix}$, $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n>>>"
