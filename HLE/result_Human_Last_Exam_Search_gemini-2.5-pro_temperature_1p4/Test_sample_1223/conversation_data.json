    "A key result in addressing this question is a theorem by J. van Mill and M. L. Wage, which states that for any given non-degenerate continuum `K`, there exists a hereditarily indecomposable continuum `X` within the Hilbert cube (and thus a metric space) and a point `x` in `X` such that the Stone-Čech remainder of `X \\setminus \\{x\\}` is homeomorphic to `K`.\n\nThis powerful theorem transforms the problem into determining the maximum possible number of composants that any continuum `K` can possess, provided that `K` can be a Stone-Čech remainder of a punctured metric continuum.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints on such a continuum `K`.\n1.  Let `X` be a hereditarily indecomposable metric continuum. As a compact metric space, `X` is separable, and its topological weight, `w(X)`, is `ℵ₀`.\n2.  The space `Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}` is a locally compact, non-compact, and separable metric space. Its weight is also `w(Y) = ℵ₀`.\n3.  The weight of the Stone-Čech compactification `βY` of a separable metric space `Y` is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum (`c = 2^ℵ₀`).\n4.  The Stone-Čech remainder, `Y^* = βY \\setminus Y`, is a continuum. As a subspace of `βY`, its weight, `w(Y^*)`, must be less than or equal to the weight of `βY`. Therefore, `w(Y^*) ≤ c`.\n5.  The number of composants of any continuum cannot exceed its weight. Consequently, the number of composants in the Stone-Čech remainder is at most `c`.\n\nThe final step is to demonstrate that this upper bound of `c` can be achieved. For this, we rely on another significant result from continuum theory:\n*   It is known that for any infinite cardinal `κ`, it is possible to construct an indecomposable continuum that possesses `2^κ` composants. By setting `κ = ℵ₀`, we can construct a continuum, let's call it `K_c`, that has `2^ℵ₀ = c` composants. The construction of such a continuum (for example, as an inverse limit of `ℵ₀` metric continua) results in a space with weight `c`.\n\nSince this continuum `K_c` has a weight of `c`, it is a valid candidate for a Stone-Čech remainder according to the constraints derived above. By applying the theorem of van Mill and Wage, we can assert the existence of a specific hereditarily indecomposable metric continuum `X` and a point `x ∈ X` for which the Stone-Čech remainder `β(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})` is homeomorphic to `K_c`.\n\nThis specific remainder therefore has `c` composants. Since we have established an upper bound of `c` and shown that it is attainable, the maximum possible number of composants is `c`.\n\n<<<c>>>"
