This bioinformatics filtering strategy, implemented via a single `grep` command, allows for the precise removal of contaminating gene data prior to differential expression analysis. This ensures that the downstream results are not skewed by the contaminant signal present only in the CAR T-cell samples without co-expressed IL-15.
