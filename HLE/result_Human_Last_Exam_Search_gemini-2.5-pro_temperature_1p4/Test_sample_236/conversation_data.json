    "An integral surgery on a knot in the 3-sphere results in a 3-manifold. For this manifold to be an integral homology sphere (a space with the same integer homology as the 3-sphere), a condition on the surgery coefficient related to the knot's Alexander polynomial must be met. The set of all such integral homology spheres, under the equivalence relation of homology cobordism, forms the homology cobordism group, denoted Θ₃ᶻ.\n\nTo determine how many elements of this group can be represented by surgery on knots with at most four crossings, we must first identify these knots. They are the unknot (0₁), the trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁).\n\n### Unknot (0₁)\nThe Alexander polynomial of the unknot is Δ(t) = 1. Consequently, the determinant of the knot is |Δ(-1)| = 1. An integral p-surgery on the unknot yields a homology sphere if and only if the surgery coefficient *p* is coprime to the knot's determinant. In this case, since the determinant is 1, any integral surgery on the unknot results in a manifold with the homology of a sphere.\n\nSpecifically, p-surgery on the unknot produces the lens space L(p, 1).\n*   For p = ±1, the resulting manifold is the 3-sphere S³, which represents the **trivial element** in the homology cobordism group.\n*   For |p| > 1, the surgery results in a non-trivial lens space. It is a known result that two lens spaces L(p, q) and L(p', q') are homology cobordant if and only if |p| = |p'|. This implies that surgeries on the unknot generate an **infinite number of distinct elements** in the homology cobordism group, corresponding to |p| = 2, 3, 4, and so on.\n\n### Trefoil Knot (3₁)\nThe Alexander polynomial of the trefoil knot is Δ(t) = t² - t + 1. The determinant of the trefoil knot is |Δ(-1)| = |(-1)² - (-1) + 1| = 3. Therefore, an integral p-surgery on the trefoil knot results in an integral homology sphere if and only if p is not divisible by 3.\n*   The ±1 surgeries on the trefoil knot yield the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,5), also known as the Poincaré homology sphere, and its orientation-reversed counterpart. The Poincaré homology sphere is a non-trivial element of **infinite order** in the homology cobordism group.\n*   Different surgery coefficients produce a variety of homology spheres. It has been shown that these surgeries on the trefoil knot generate an **infinite-rank subgroup** of the homology cobordism group.\n\n### Figure-Eight Knot (4₁)\nThe Alexander polynomial of the figure-eight knot is Δ(t) = t² - 3t + 1. The determinant of this knot is |Δ(-1)| = |(-1)² - 3(-1) + 1| = 5. Therefore, p-surgery on the figure-eight knot produces a homology sphere if p is not a multiple of 5.\n*   Notably, +1 and -1 surgery on the figure-eight knot result in the same homology sphere. This homology sphere is a non-trivial element of **order 2** in the homology cobordism group, meaning it is distinct from the trivial element but twice the connected sum of it with itself is homology cobordant to the 3-sphere.\n\nSince integral surgeries on the unknot alone generate an infinite number of distinct elements in the homology cobordism group, and surgeries on the trefoil and figure-eight knots contribute additional elements (many of which are also distinct from the lens spaces and from each other), we can conclude that there are infinitely many such elements.\n\n<<<Infinitely many."
