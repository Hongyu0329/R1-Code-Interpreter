    "The next number in the sequence is 2364.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n1.  All numbers in the sequence are divisible by 6.\n2.  Let's divide each number in the sequence by 6 to see if a simpler pattern emerges:\n    169, 170, 172, 175, 184, 204, 205, 215, 235, 240, 242, 247, 250, 252, 260, 264, 267, 289, 302, 315, 317, 322, 329, 334, 340, 344, 345, 355, 357, 379, 390, 392\n3.  Now, let's find the differences between these new consecutive numbers:\n    1, 2, 3, 9, 20, 1, 10, 20, 5, 2, 5, 3, 2, 8, 4, 3, 22, 13, 13, 2, 5, 7, 5, 6, 4, 1, 10, 2, 22, 11, 2\n4.  This sequence of differences does not follow a simple arithmetic rule, but it does feature repeated numbers. For example, 13 appears twice in a row, and other numbers like 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 22 appear multiple times.\n5.  The last difference in this sequence is 2. Given the frequent repetition of numbers in this sequence of differences, a logical next step is to assume this last difference of 2 will repeat.\n6.  Adding this difference of 2 to the last number in our simplified sequence (392) gives the next number in that sequence: 392 + 2 = 394.\n7.  To find the next number in the original sequence, we multiply this result by 6: 394 * 6 = 2364.\n\n<<<2364>>>"
