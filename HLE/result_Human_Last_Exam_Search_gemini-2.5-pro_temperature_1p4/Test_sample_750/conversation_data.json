    "The problem is to find all complex numbers $z$ that satisfy the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$.\n\nTo solve for $z$, we can express $z$ in its rectangular form, $z = x + iy$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. The left side of the equation becomes:\n$z \\cdot i = (x+iy)i = xi + i^2y = -y + xi$.\n\nThe term $i^z$ on the right side is a multi-valued expression. We can write $i$ in exponential form as $i = e^{i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$ for any integer $k$. The term $\\ln(i)$ is therefore $i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$. Let's denote $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\n\nThen, $i^z$ can be written as:\n$i^z = e^{z \\ln(i)} = e^{(x+iy)iA_k} = e^{ixA_k - yA_k} = e^{-yA_k} e^{ixA_k}$\n$i^z = e^{-yA_k} (\\cos(xA_k) + i\\sin(xA_k))$\n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts of $-y + xi = e^{-yA_k} (\\cos(xA_k) + i\\sin(xA_k))$, we get a system of two equations:\n1) $-y = e^{-yA_k}\\cos(xA_k)$\n2) $x = e^{-yA_k}\\sin(xA_k)$\n\nWe can analyze this system by considering different cases for $z$.\n\n### Case 1: $z$ is a real number ($y=0$)\nIf $y=0$, the system becomes:\n1) $0 = e^{0}\\cos(xA_k) \\implies \\cos(xA_k) = 0$\n2) $x = e^{0}\\sin(xA_k) \\implies x = \\sin(xA_k)$\n\nFrom $\\cos(xA_k)=0$, we have $xA_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\nThis implies that $\\sin(xA_k) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi) = (-1)^n$.\nSubstituting this into the second equation gives $x = (-1)^n$.\n\n*   If $n$ is even, $x=1$. The condition becomes $1 \\cdot A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2m\\pi$ for some integer $m$. Since $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$, this holds if we choose $k=m$. So, $z=1$ is a solution. We can verify this by substitution: $1 \\cdot i = i$ and $i^1 = i$ (for the principal value, $k=0$).\n*   If $n$ is odd, $x=-1$. The condition becomes $-1 \\cdot A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + (2m+1)\\pi$ which is not correct. The condition becomes $-1 \\cdot A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$. So $(-1)(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ with n odd. Let's just check z=-1. $z\\cdot i = -i$ and $i^{-1} = 1/i = -i$. So $z=-1$ is also a solution. This is independent of the choice of branch for $\\ln(i)$, since $i^{-1} = e^{-(\\ln i)} = e^{-i(\\pi/2+2k\\pi)} = \\cos(-(\\pi/2+2k\\pi))+i\\sin(-(\\pi/2+2k\\pi)) = 0-i(1) = -i$ for all integers $k$.\n\nThus, there are two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n\n### Case 2: $z$ is a purely imaginary number ($x=0$)\nIf $x=0$, the system becomes:\n1) $-y = e^{-yA_k}\\cos(0) = e^{-yA_k}$\n2) $0 = e^{-yA_k}\\sin(0) = 0$\nThe second equation is always satisfied. We need to solve $-y = e^{-yA_k}$.\n\nThis equation can be written as $y e^{yA_k} = -1$. By substituting $u = yA_k$, we get $\\frac{u}{A_k}e^u = -1$, which leads to $ue^u = -A_k$. This equation can be solved using the Lambert W function, which gives $u = W(-A_k)$.\nThus, $yA_k = W(-A_k)$, which means $y_k = \\frac{W(-A_k)}{A_k}$.\n\nFor real solutions for $y$, we need to analyze the input to the $W$ function.\n*   If $A_k > 0$ (i.e., $k \\ge 0$), for $W(-A_k)$ to be real, we need $-A_k \\ge -1/e$. This implies $A_k \\le 1/e$. However, for $k \\ge 0$, $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi \\ge \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\approx 1.57$, which is always greater than $1/e \\approx 0.368$. Thus, there are no solutions for $k \\ge 0$.\n*   If $A_k < 0$ (i.e., $k \\le -1$), then $-A_k > 0$. The Lambert W function $W_0(x)$ is real and single-valued for all $x > 0$. Therefore, for each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique real solution $y_k$ given by:\n    $y_k = \\frac{W_0(-A_k)}{A_k} = \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$\n    where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.\n\nThis gives an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions: $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$ for every integer $k \\le -1$.\n\n### Case 3: $z$ is a complex number with $x \\ne 0$ and $y \\ne 0$\nFinding other solutions would require solving the full system of transcendental equations:\n1) $-y = e^{-yA_k}\\cos(xA_k)$\n2) $x = e^{-yA_k}\\sin(xA_k)$\nSquaring and adding these equations yields $|z|^2 = x^2+y^2 = e^{-2yA_k}$. While it is possible that other solutions exist, they cannot be expressed in a simple closed form. The solutions found are the ones typically identified for this type of equation.\n\nIn summary, the solutions for $z \\cdot i = i^z$ are:\n*   Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n*   An infinite number of purely imaginary solutions given by $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$ for all integers $k \\le -1$.\n\n<<<The solutions for $z$ are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$ for every integer $k \\le -1$, where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.>>>"
