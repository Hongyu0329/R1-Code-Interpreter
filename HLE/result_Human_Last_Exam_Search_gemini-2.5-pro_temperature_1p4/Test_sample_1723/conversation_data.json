    "While many mushrooms exhibit blue coloration on their caps or stems, and some even bruise blue, there is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.\n\nSpore prints are a crucial tool for mushroom identification, and their colors are generally in the range of white, cream, pink, yellow, brown, purple-brown, and black. Green spore prints are known to exist but are rare, with a notable example being the poisonous *Chlorophyllum molybdites*.\n\nSome well-known blue-colored mushrooms and their actual spore print colors include:\n\n*   ***Entoloma hochstetteri***, a vibrant blue mushroom native to New Zealand, has a pink spore print.\n*   ***Lactarius indigo***, known for its blue latex, produces a yellowish-cream spore print.\n*   ***Stropharia caerulea***, the Blue Roundhead, has a purple-brown spore print.\n*   ***Panaeolus cyanescens***, which bruises blue, has a black spore print.\n\nScientific literature and mycological resources confirm that while a wide array of spore colors exists, blue is not among them.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
