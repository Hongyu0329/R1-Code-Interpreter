    "To reduce the discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality, we first analyze the observability of the original system `(A, C)` to determine the structure of the canonical form. The new matrices in the observer canonical form, let's call them `A_o` and `C_o`, are related to the controller canonical form `(A_c, B_c)` of the dual system `(A^T, C^T)` by the relations `A_o = A_c^T` and `C_o = B_c^T`. The problem asks for the new matrix `C`, which is `C_o`.\n\nThe structure of `C_o` is uniquely determined by the observability indices of the original system `(A, C)`.\n\n**1. System Matrices:**\nThe given system matrices are:\n`A = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]`\n`C = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]`\n\n**2. Check for Observability and Determine Observability Indices:**\nThe observability matrix `O` is constructed from the rows of `C` and `CA`, `CA^2`, and so on.\nThe rows of `C` are:\n`c_1 = [0, 1, 0]`\n`c_2 = [1, 1, 0]`\n\nNext, we compute `CA`:\n`CA = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]] = [[2, 1, 1], [3, 2, 1]]`\nThe rows of `CA` are:\n`c_1A = [2, 1, 1]`\n`c_2A = [3, 2, 1]`\n\nTo find the observability indices, we select linearly independent rows from the sequence `c_1, c_2, c_1A, c_2A, ...` until we have `n=3` of them.\n*   Row 1: `c_1 = [0, 1, 0]` (Linearly independent)\n*   Row 2: `c_2 = [1, 1, 0]` (Linearly independent from `c_1`)\n*   Row 3: `c_1A = [2, 1, 1]` (We check if it's linearly independent from `c_1` and `c_2`).\n    The determinant of the matrix formed by these three vectors is `det([[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1]]) = -1`, which is non-zero. Thus, the three vectors are linearly independent.\n\nSince we have found `n=3` linearly independent rows, the system is observable. The observability indices (`µ_1`, `µ_2`) are determined by how many rows associated with each output were needed.\n*   We used `c_1` and `c_1A`, so `µ_1 = 2`.\n*   We used `c_2`, so `µ_2 = 1`.\nThe sum of the indices `µ_1 + µ_2 = 2 + 1 = 3`, which equals the order of the system.\n\n**3. Determine the New Matrix C in Observer Canonical Form:**\nFor a multi-output system with observability indices `µ_1, µ_2, ..., µ_p`, the `C` matrix in observer canonical form, `C_o`, has a specific structure composed of standard basis vectors (`e_i`). The rows of `C_o` are given by the transposes of `e_1`, `e_{µ_1+1}`, `e_{µ_1+µ_2+1}`, and so on.\n\nIn this case, with `p=2` outputs and indices `µ_1=2`, `µ_2=1`, the rows of the new matrix `C` are `e_1^T` and `e_{µ_1+1}^T = e_3^T`.\n*   `e_1 = [1, 0, 0]^T`\n*   `e_3 = [0, 0, 1]^T`\n\nTherefore, the new matrix `C` is:\n`C_o = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
