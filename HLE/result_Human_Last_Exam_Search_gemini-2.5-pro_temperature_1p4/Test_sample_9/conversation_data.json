    "Let $X$ be the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area. We first need to precisely define this space. A lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be represented by a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, which form the columns of a matrix $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. Two matrices $M_1$ and $M_2$ represent the same lattice if they are related by a change of basis, i.e., $M_2 = M_1 \\gamma$ for some $\\gamma \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(M)|$. The condition of unit area restricts $M$ to the set of matrices with $|\\det(M)|=1$. This set is $O(2)SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$. The term \"nondegenerate\" means that the lattice has rank 2, which is already implied by the definition of a lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThe term \"moduli space\" implies that we identify lattices that are equivalent under isometries of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The group of isometries of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is $E(2) = O(2) \\ltimes \\mathbb{R}^2$. Since lattices are subgroups, two lattices $\\Lambda_1$ and $\\Lambda_2$ are equivalent if $\\Lambda_2 = A\\Lambda_1$ for some $A \\in O(2)$ (we can ignore the translation part).\n\nSo, the moduli space $X$ is the space of unit-area lattices, quotiented by the action of the orthogonal group $O(2)$. This can be written as:\n$X = O(2) \\backslash \\{M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid |\\det M| = 1\\} / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nTo analyze this space, we can use the concept of symmetric spaces. Any matrix $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ has a unique polar decomposition $M=UP$, where $U \\in O(2)$ is an orthogonal matrix and $P$ is a symmetric positive-definite matrix. The condition $|\\det(M)|=1$ implies $\\det(P)=1$. Let $\\text{Sym}_1^+(2, \\mathbb{R})$ be the space of symmetric positive-definite $2 \\times 2$ matrices with determinant 1. The moduli space $X$ is then given by the quotient:\n$X \\cong \\text{Sym}_1^+(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$\nwhere the action of $\\gamma \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ on $P \\in \\text{Sym}_1^+(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is given by $P \\mapsto \\gamma^T P \\gamma$. Note that $\\det(\\gamma^T P \\gamma) = (\\det \\gamma)^2 \\det P = (\\pm 1)^2 \\cdot 1 = 1$, so this action is well-defined.\n\nThe space $\\text{Sym}_1^+(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is homeomorphic to the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid \\text{Im}(z) > 0\\}$. The action of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ on $\\text{Sym}_1^+(2, \\mathbb{R})$ translates to an action on $\\mathbb{H}$.\n*   For $\\gamma \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, the action on $\\mathbb{H}$ is the standard one by Mobius transformations: $z \\mapsto \\frac{az+b}{cz+d}$.\n*   The action of an element with determinant -1, such as $\\gamma_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, corresponds to the transformation $z \\mapsto -\\bar{z}$.\n\nTherefore, the space $X$ is the quotient of the upper half-plane by the group generated by $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ and the map $z \\mapsto -\\bar{z}$. This group is known as the extended modular group. The fundamental domain of the action of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ on $\\mathbb{H}$ is the famous region $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{H} \\mid |z| \\ge 1, |\\text{Re}(z)| \\le 1/2\\}$. The transformation $z \\mapsto -\\bar{z}$ is a reflection across the imaginary axis. The fundamental domain for the extended group is thus the part of the standard fundamental domain with non-negative real part, i.e., $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{H} \\mid |z| \\ge 1, 0 \\le \\text{Re}(z) \\le 1/2\\}$.\n\nTopologically, this fundamental domain is a triangle (with one vertex at infinity). The quotient space $X$ is formed by identifying the edges of this triangle. The resulting space is homeomorphic to a closed disk, which is contractible.\n\nThe first homology group of a contractible space is trivial. Therefore, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\nIt is worth noting that different interpretations of the question can lead to different results. For example:\n*   If $X$ were interpreted as the space of *oriented* unit-area lattices without rotational identification, $X$ would be $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})/SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$. Its first homology group is the abelianization of $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$, which is $\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   If $X$ were the space of *unoriented* unit-area lattices without rotational identification, its first homology group would be $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$.\nHowever, the standard definition of \"moduli space\" includes equivalences under isometries, which leads to the result above.\n\n"
