    "The computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is determined by the number of iterations in the `while` loop. The loop executes as long as the quotient `q` is greater than 0.\n\nLet's analyze the value of `q` at each step.\n*   **Initialization (Step 1):** `x` is set to `n`, and `q` is calculated as `floor(n/c)`.\n*   **Loop Iteration 1:** `x` becomes the previous `q` (i.e., `floor(n/c)`). The new `q` is `floor(x/c)`, which is `floor((floor(n/c))/c) = floor(n/c^2)`.\n*   **Loop Iteration 2:** The new `q` becomes `floor(n/c^3)`.\n*   **Loop Iteration k:** The value of `q` will be `floor(n/c^(k+1))`.\n\nThe loop terminates when `q` is no longer greater than 0. This occurs when `n/c^(k+1)` becomes less than 1, meaning `n < c^(k+1)`. The number of times the loop runs, let's call this `k`, is essentially the number of digits in the base `c` representation of `n` minus one.\n\nThe number of digits `d` in the base `c` representation of `n` is given by `d = floor(log_c(n)) + 1`. The loop runs `d-1` or `d` times, which is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n\nThe operations inside the loop — assignment, division, and subtraction — are considered to take constant time, O(1), assuming that `n` fits within a machine's word size. Therefore, the total time complexity is the number of iterations multiplied by the complexity of the operations inside the loop.\n\nThis results in a time complexity of `O(log_c(n))`. In Big O notation, the base of the logarithm is usually omitted because logarithms with different constant bases are related by a constant factor (`log_a(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(a)`), and constant factors are ignored. Thus, the complexity is commonly expressed as `O(log n)`.\n\nThe algorithm described performs repeated division by the base `c`. For a number `n`, the number of such divisions required is proportional to `log_c(n)`. Each division and remainder operation inside the loop takes constant time. The number of iterations of the while loop is the number of digits in base `c` which is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n<<<O(log_c(n))>>>"
