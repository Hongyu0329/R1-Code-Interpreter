    "There is no finite maximum for the number of components of the intersection of two closed connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square. We can construct examples with any finite number of components, as well as a countably infinite or even uncountably infinite number of components.\n\n### Construction for N components\n\nLet N be any positive integer. We can construct two closed connected sets, A and B, whose union is the unit square S = x and whose intersection has N connected components.\n\n1.  **Define the intersection:** First, we define the set that will become the intersection, A ∩ B. We partition the unit square into 2N - 1 horizontal strips of alternating type. Let's have N \"intersection strips\" and N - 1 \"gap strips\" between them.\n    *   Intersection strips (N of them): `I_k = [0, 1] x [ (2k)/(2N-1), (2k+1)/(2N-1) ]` for `k = 0, 1, ..., N-1`.\n    *   Gap strips (N-1 of them): `G_k = [0, 1] x [ (2k-1)/(2N-1), (2k)/(2N-1) ]` for `k = 1, 2, ..., N-1`.\n    The desired intersection will be the union of the N disjoint closed rectangles `I_k`.\n\n2.  **Define the sets A and B:** We now define the sets A and B. Both will contain all the intersection strips `I_k`. The gap strips `G_k` will be divided between A and B.\n    *   Let A be the union of all intersection strips `I_k` and the left half of all gap strips.\n        `A = (∪_{k=0}^{N-1} I_k) ∪ (∪_{k=1}^{N-1} [0, 1/2] x G_k)`\n    *   Let B be the union of all intersection strips `I_k` and the right half of all gap strips.\n        `B = (∪_{k=0}^{N-1} I_k) ∪ (∪_{k=1}^{N-1} [1/2, 1] x G_k)`\n\n3.  **Verify the properties:**\n    *   **Union is the unit square:** The union A ∪ B contains all `I_k` strips and for each gap `G_k`, it contains both the left half `[0, 1/2] x G_k` and the right half `[1/2, 1] x G_k`. Thus, A ∪ B = S.\n    *   **A and B are closed:** Each set A and B is a finite union of closed rectangles, which is a closed set.\n    *   **A and B are connected:** The set A contains the entire vertical line segment {0} x. Any point in A can be connected by a path within A to this vertical line. Since the vertical line is connected, the entire set A is connected. Similarly, set B contains the vertical line segment {1} x, making B connected.\n    *   **Intersection:** The intersection A ∩ B is precisely the union of the N intersection strips `I_k`. Since these strips are disjoint, the intersection consists of N connected components.\n\nSince N can be any positive integer, there is no finite upper bound on the number of components.\n\n### Infinite Components\n\nThis construction can be extended to create a countably infinite number of components by using an infinite sequence of strips converging to a line. It can be further extended using a Cantor set construction to produce an uncountable number of components.\n\nLet C be the Cantor set on the interval. Let `I = [0,1] x C`. The set `I` has uncountably many connected components (each horizontal line segment `[0,1] x {c}` for `c` in C). Let `O = [0,1] \\ C`, which is a countable union of open intervals `O_n`. We can define A and B as:\n\n*   `A = I ∪ (∪_n ([0, 1/2] x cl(O_n)))`\n*   `B = I ∪ (∪_n ([1/2, 1] x cl(O_n)))`\n\nTo ensure connectivity, we can add the left edge of the square to A and the right edge to B.\n*   `A_conn = A ∪ ({0} x [0,1])`\n*   `B_conn = B ∪ ({1} x [0,1])`\n\nThese sets are closed, connected, their union is the square, and their intersection `A_conn ∩ B_conn = I` has uncountably many components.\n\nTherefore, there is no largest number of components.\n\n<<<infinity>>>"
