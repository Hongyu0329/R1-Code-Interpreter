    "There is no definitive year when Goodluck Ebele Jonathan first publicly identified as \"Azikiwe,\" as it is part of his birth name. However, the use of his full name, including \"Azikiwe,\" in the public and political sphere became more prominent around 2010.\n\nHis full name is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan. The name \"Azikiwe\" was reportedly a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first president of Nigeria.\n\nWhile it is part of his official name, its use in his political branding appears to have become more noticeable during his political career. For instance, in November 2010, it was reported that he referred to himself as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" during his presidential declaration at the Eagle Square in September of that year. This period aligns with his rise to the presidency and the subsequent election campaigns.\n\nSome contemporary reports from 2010 questioned the timing of the more frequent public use of \"Azikiwe,\" suggesting it might have been a strategic move to appeal to a broader Nigerian electorate, particularly the Igbo people.\n\n<<<There is no record of a single year when Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan first publicly identified as Azikiwe; it has always been a part of his name. However, its use became more prominent in the public and political sphere around 2010.>>>"
