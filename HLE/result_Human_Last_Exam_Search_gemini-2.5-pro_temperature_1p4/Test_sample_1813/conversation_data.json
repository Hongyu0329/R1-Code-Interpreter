    "The computation of the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) first requires determining the continued fraction of the rational number \\( 4/7 \\).\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm provides the partial quotients for the continued fraction of \\( 4/7 \\):\n*   \\( 7 = 1 \\cdot 4 + 3 \\)\n*   \\( 4 = 1 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\)\n*   \\( 3 = 3 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\)\n\nSince \\( 4/7 < 1 \\), the first partial quotient is \\( a_0 = 0 \\). The subsequent quotients are the integers found above: \\( a_1 = 1 \\), \\( a_2 = 1 \\), and \\( a_3 = 3 \\). Thus, the continued fraction for \\( 4/7 \\) is \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\).\n\nThe term \"generalized Markov number\", particularly in the context of a rational index \\( r = p/q \\), often refers to a quadratic irrationality whose own continued fraction is derived from that of \\( r \\). While several generalizations of Markov numbers exist, a common construction, rooted in the work of Harvey Cohn on the geometry of numbers, defines the associated number by reversing the sequence of partial quotients of the rational number (ignoring the initial zero) and making this new sequence the periodic part of a new continued fraction.\n\nFollowing this interpretation:\n1.  Take the partial quotients of \\( 4/7 \\) following the initial zero: \\( (1, 1, 3) \\).\n2.  Reverse this sequence to obtain \\( (3, 1, 1) \\).\n3.  Form a purely periodic continued fraction with this reversed sequence as the repeating block.\n\nTherefore, the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is given by \\( [\\overline{3, 1, 1}] \\). This notation represents the infinite continued fraction \\( [3; 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, \\dots] \\).\n\n<<<[\\overline{3, 1, 1}]>>>"
