    "The protein that, when broken down or inhibited, allows for enhanced macrophage engulfment of amyloid-beta (Aβ) is **Glia Maturation Factor-gamma (GMFG)**.\n\nRecent research has shown that GMFG, an actin-disassembly protein found in high levels in immune cells, plays a regulatory role in the phagocytosis of Aβ by macrophages. Specifically, the knockdown or reduction of GMFG has been demonstrated to increase the engulfment of Aβ by macrophages. This is because GMFG appears to downregulate the expression of a key receptor on the macrophage surface called Scavenger Receptor Class A Type I (SR-AI), which is essential for binding and clearing Aβ. Therefore, when GMFG is broken down or its function is inhibited, the levels of SR-AI on macrophages increase, leading to a more efficient uptake and clearance of amyloid-beta.\n\nWhile other proteins are involved in the process, GMFG stands out as a protein whose reduction directly facilitates the engulfment of amyloid by macrophages.\n\n<<<Glia Maturation Factor-gamma (GMFG)>>>"
