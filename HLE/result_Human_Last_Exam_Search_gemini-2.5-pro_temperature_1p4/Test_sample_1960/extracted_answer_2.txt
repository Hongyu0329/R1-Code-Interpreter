**Function f:**
The function `f` maps a natural number `w` to the linear logic formula:
$$
f(w) = P \multimap (P \otimes A^{\otimes w})
$$
where `P` and `A` are distinct atomic propositions and `A^{\otimes w}` denotes the tensor product of `A` with itself `w` times.

**Formula C:**
The linear logic formula `C = C(W, m, b)` is given by:
$$
C = \left( P^{\otimes m} \otimes \left( (P \otimes A^{\otimes b}) \multimap 1 \right)^{\otimes m} \right) \multimap 1
$$
where `1` is the multiplicative unit.
