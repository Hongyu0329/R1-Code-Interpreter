    "The maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of *n* variables, denoted as a(*n*), is given by the formula 2<sup>(*n*-1)</sup>. This is because a prime implicant is a product term that cannot be simplified further, and the maximum number of these is achieved in specific arrangements, such as in a checkerboard pattern on a Karnaugh map.\n\nFor a Boolean function of 4 variables (*n*=4), the maximal number of prime implicants is calculated as follows:\n\na(4) = 2<sup>(4-1)</sup> = 2<sup>3</sup> = 8.\n\nThis can be visualized on a 4-variable Karnaugh map where no two adjacent cells containing a '1' can be grouped together, making each individual '1' a prime implicant. For example, with a 4-variable K-map, you can have a maximum of 8 prime implicants.\n\n<<<8>>>"
