    "In the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field, denoted by `Z`, at a finite temperature `T`, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` represents the quadratic part of the Euclidean action for the scalar field `ϕ`. This formulation is achieved through a Wick rotation to imaginary time, `τ = it`, where the time-like dimension is compactified on a circle with circumference `β = 1/T`.\n\nThe partition function `Z` is given by a functional integral over all field configurations `ϕ` that are periodic in imaginary time with period `β`:\n`Z = ∫ Dϕ exp[-S_E[ϕ]]`\n\nThe Euclidean action `S_E[ϕ]` for a free, neutral scalar field is the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density over the Euclidean spacetime volume (from `τ = 0` to `β` and over all spatial dimensions). The quadratic part of this action is what is denoted by the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)`.\n\nSpecifically, the inner product is defined as:\n` (ϕ, D_ϕ) = S_E[ϕ] = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x ½ [ (∂_τ ϕ)² + (∇ϕ)² + m²ϕ² ] `\n\nFrom this expression, we can identify the operator `D_ϕ` as the differential operator:\n` D_ϕ = - (∂_τ² + ∇²) + m² `\nThis is often written in terms of the d'Alembertian operator in Euclidean space, `□_E = ∂_τ² + ∇²`, as:\n` D_ϕ = -□_E + m² `\n\nTherefore, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` is a shorthand notation for the integral of `ϕ` multiplied by the action of this operator `D_ϕ` on `ϕ`, integrated over the Euclidean spacetime.\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory, for a neutral scalar field `ϕ`, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function is the quadratic part of the Euclidean action. It is given by the integral:\n\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x  ½ ϕ(τ, x) [-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²] ϕ(τ, x)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `τ` is the imaginary time, integrated from 0 to `β = 1/T`, where `T` is the temperature.\n*   `x` represents the spatial coordinates.\n*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field.\n*   The field configurations `ϕ(τ, x)` are periodic in the imaginary time direction, i.e., `ϕ(0, x) = ϕ(β, x)`.\n*   The operator `D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²` is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator. The term `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` can thus be seen as an inner product in the space of scalar fields, where the operator `D_ϕ` acts as the kernel.>>>"
