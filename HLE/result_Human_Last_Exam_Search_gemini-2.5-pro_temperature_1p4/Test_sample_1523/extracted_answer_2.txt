In finite-temperature field theory, for a neutral scalar field `ϕ`, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function is the quadratic part of the Euclidean action. It is given by the integral:

`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x  ½ ϕ(τ, x) [-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²] ϕ(τ, x)`

where:
*   `τ` is the imaginary time, integrated from 0 to `β = 1/T`, where `T` is the temperature.
*   `x` represents the spatial coordinates.
*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field.
*   The field configurations `ϕ(τ, x)` are periodic in the imaginary time direction, i.e., `ϕ(0, x) = ϕ(β, x)`.
*   The operator `D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²` is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator. The term `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` can thus be seen as an inner product in the space of scalar fields, where the operator `D_ϕ` acts as the kernel.
