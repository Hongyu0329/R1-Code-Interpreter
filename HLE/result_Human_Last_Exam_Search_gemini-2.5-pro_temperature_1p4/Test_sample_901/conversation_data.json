    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered base, and tert-butyl alcohol is a polar aprotic solvent, conditions that favor the E2 mechanism.\n\nFor an E2 reaction to occur in a cyclohexane system, the leaving group (in this case, the bromine atom) and a β-hydrogen (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbon bearing the bromine) must be in a trans-diaxial (anti-periplanar) conformation. This means that both the bromine and the hydrogen atom being removed must occupy axial positions, pointing in opposite directions (one up, one down).\n\nLet's analyze the chair conformations of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, which has a *trans* relationship between the bromo and methyl groups:\n\n1.  **Conformer A:** If the bromine atom is in an axial position, the methyl group on the adjacent carbon must be in an equatorial position. For E2 elimination, we look at the β-hydrogens on the two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **Hydrogen at C2:** This hydrogen is in an equatorial position, so it is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Therefore, elimination cannot occur towards C2 to form the more substituted alkene (1-methylcyclohexene).\n    *   **Hydrogen at C6:** This carbon has an axial hydrogen that is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Elimination can and will occur by abstracting this proton.\n\n2.  **Conformer B (after ring flip):** If the bromine atom is in an equatorial position, the methyl group would be in an axial position. E2 elimination cannot proceed from this conformation because the leaving group is not axial.\n\nTherefore, the reaction must proceed through Conformer A, where the bromine is axial. Since the only available anti-periplanar β-hydrogen is on C6, the bulky base will abstract this proton, and the double bond will form between C1 and C6. This results in the formation of 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\nAlthough potassium tert-butoxide typically favors the Hofmann product (the less substituted alkene), in this case, the product is determined by the strict stereochemical requirements of the E2 mechanism in a cyclic system. The formation of the Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene) is prohibited because it would require the removal of the equatorial hydrogen at C2.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
