In the context of scalar field theoretical frameworks, the critical exponent for specific heat, α, quantitatively scales with the spatial dimensionality, d, for d < 4 through the epsilon expansion (ε = 4 - d). To second order in ε, the relationship for an O(n)-symmetric model is given by the formula:

**α = [(4 - n) / (2(n + 8))] * (4 - d) - [(n+2)²(n+28) / (4(n+8)³)] * (4 - d)² + O((4-d)³) **

To first order, the scaling is linear with ε = 4 - d:
**α ≈ [(4 - n) / (2(n + 8))] * (4 - d)**

This shows that the value and sign of the exponent depend directly on the dimensionality and the number of spin components, n.
