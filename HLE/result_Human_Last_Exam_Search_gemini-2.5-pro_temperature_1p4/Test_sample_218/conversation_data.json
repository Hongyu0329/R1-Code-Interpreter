    "The irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group on 25 elements, $S_{25}$, are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer 25. The dimension of each irrep is determined by its corresponding partition. To find the number of irreps with a dimension strictly less than 500,000, a systematic search of the partitions of 25 is required.\n\nThe dimensions of the irreps are calculated using the hook-length formula. This calculation can be complex for partitions with many parts. By systematically analyzing partitions and their dimensions, we can identify those that satisfy the condition. The dimensions of irreps are integers.\n\nPartitions and their conjugates have the same dimension. For example, the partition $(n-1, 1)$ and its conjugate $(2, 1^{n-3})$ have the same dimension. A partition is self-conjugate if it is its own conjugate; such partitions exist for $S_{25}$ but their dimensions are all well above 500,000. Therefore, all qualifying irreps come in pairs of a partition and its distinct conjugate.\n\nHere is a summary of the partitions of 25 whose corresponding irreducible representations have a dimension less than 500,000, grouped by the largest part of the partition ($\\lambda_1$):\n\n*   **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 25$:**\n    *   (25): dimension 1. Its conjugate is (1$^{25}$), also with dimension 1. This gives 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 24$:**\n    *   (24, 1): dimension 24. Its conjugate is (2, 1$^{23}$). This gives 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 23$:**\n    *   (23, 2): dimension 275.\n    *   (23, 1, 1): dimension 276.\n    This gives 2 pairs, or 4 irreps.\n*   **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 22$:**\n    *   (22, 3): dimension 2,300.\n    *   (22, 2, 1): dimension 2,925.\n    *   (22, 1, 1, 1): dimension 2,024.\n    This gives 3 pairs, or 6 irreps.\n*   **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 21$:**\n    *   (21, 4): dimension 10,350.\n    *   (21, 3, 1): dimension 32,925.\n    *   (21, 2, 2): dimension 21,700.\n    *   (21, 2, 1, 1): dimension 58,500.\n    *   (21, 1$^{4}$): dimension 10,626.\n    This gives 5 pairs, or 10 irreps.\n*   **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 20$:**\n    *   (20, 5): dimension 40,480.\n    *   (20, 4, 1): dimension 154,175.\n    *   (20, 3, 2): dimension 151,800.\n    *   (20, 3, 1, 1): dimension 260,775.\n    *   (20, 2, 2, 1): dimension 247,000.\n    *   (20, 2, 1$^{3}$): dimension 191,100.\n    *   (20, 1$^{5}$): dimension 42,504.\n    This gives 7 pairs, or 14 irreps.\n*   **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 19$:**\n    *   (19, 6): dimension 123,970.\n    *   (19, 5, 1): dimension 445,445.\n    *   (19, 4, 2): dimension 480,480.\n    *   (19, 3, 3): dimension 352,716.\n    *   (19, 2, 2, 2): dimension 441,441.\n    *   (19, 2, 1$^{4}$): dimension 445,445.\n    *   (19, 1$^{6}$): dimension 134,596.\n    This gives 7 pairs, or 14 irreps.\n*   **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 18$:**\n    *   (18, 7): dimension 303,600.\n    *   (18, 1$^{7}$): dimension 346,104.\n    This gives 2 pairs, or 4 irreps.\n\nPartitions where the largest part is 17 or less have dimensions exceeding 500,000. Summing the number of qualifying irreducible representations:\n2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 14 + 4 = 56.\n\nThus, there are 56 irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\n<<<56>>>"
