The proposed approach is not valid because it fails to account for the sensory perception of the relevant signal receivers, which are the avian predators of the bumblebees. The ecological function of MÃ¼llerian mimicry in *Bombus* is to present a consistent, memorable warning signal to predators that learn to associate the pattern with a sting. The validity of the clustering, therefore, depends entirely on whether the visual similarity is assessed from the perspective of these predators, not humans.

There are three primary flaws in the proposed methodology:

1.  **Mismatch in Visual Systems**: The primary visual predators of foraging bumblebees are birds. Human vision is trichromatic (red, green, blue cones), whereas most diurnal bird vision is tetrachromatic. This means birds possess a fourth cone type that allows them to perceive light in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, a range completely invisible to humans. Consequently, two bee species that appear identical to an undergraduate may have different UV patterns that make them easily distinguishable to a bird. Conversely, species that humans rank as dissimilar might appear more similar to an avian predator. Relying on human perception introduces a fundamental sensory bias that ignores the key visual information used by the actual agent of natural selection.

2.  **Use of "Untrained" Observers**: The mimicry syndrome's effectiveness relies on predator *learning*. An experienced predator, not a naive one, enforces the selective pressure that favors mimicry. Using untrained undergraduates, who have no prior experience or established search image, does not accurately simulate the ecological context of a predator making foraging decisions based on learned associations.

3.  **Lack of Scientific Rigor**: The method is subjective and not repeatable in a standardized way. Modern research on animal coloration and mimicry uses objective, quantitative techniques. These include spectrophotometry to measure the full reflectance spectrum of an animal's coloration (including UV) and analyzing calibrated digital images. These data are then processed through established models of avian vision to quantify color and pattern differences as they would be perceived by the bird itself. This approach removes human bias and directly addresses the ecological question of how the signal is perceived by its intended audience.

In conclusion, because the proposed study uses an observer (an untrained human) whose visual system is not an appropriate proxy for the natural predator (a bird), the resulting clusters of "mimics" would not be ecologically valid. The groupings would reflect human perceptual biases rather than the evolutionary pressures that shape mimicry in nature.
