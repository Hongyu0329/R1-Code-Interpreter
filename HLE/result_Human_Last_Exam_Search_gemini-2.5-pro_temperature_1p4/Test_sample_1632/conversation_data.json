    "A self-avoiding walk on a Manhattan lattice, also known as a square lattice, is a path on the grid that does not intersect itself. The number of such distinct walks of a given length, 'n', is denoted by a(n).\n\nFor a 10-step self-avoiding walk, the value of a(10) has been computed. The number of 1-step walks is 4, for 2-steps it is 12, and so on. The number of possibilities grows rapidly with the number of steps. There is no simple formula to calculate a(n) for any given n, and the computation for larger n is a significant challenge.\n\nHowever, the value for a(10) is well-established. Based on tabulated results from enumeration studies, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100. The sequence of these numbers is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
