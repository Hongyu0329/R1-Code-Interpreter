    "The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is not a single value; it depends on the specific atom being considered. The notation specifies how the atomic orbitals are constructed from primitive Gaussian functions. Here is a breakdown for hydrogen and heavy atoms (non-hydrogen atoms, exemplified by a second-row element like Carbon).\n\nThe notation \"6-311G**\" can be deconstructed as follows:\n\n*   **6-311G**: This part describes the core and valence orbitals.\n    *   **6**: Each core atomic orbital is represented by a single basis function, which is a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   **311**: Each valence atomic orbital is described by a set of three basis functions (a triple-zeta valence description). These are composed of 3, 1, and 1 primitive Gaussian(s), respectively.\n    *   **G**: Indicates that Gaussian-type orbitals are used.\n*   **\\*\\***: This denotes the addition of polarization functions.\n    *   The first asterisk (\\*) adds a set of d-type polarization functions to each heavy (non-hydrogen) atom.\n    *   The second asterisk (\\*\\*) adds a set of p-type polarization functions to each hydrogen atom.\n\nBased on this notation, the number of primitive Gaussians can be calculated for each type of atom.\n\n### For a Hydrogen Atom:\n\nA hydrogen atom has only a 1s valence orbital and no core orbitals.\n\n*   **1s orbital primitives**: The \"311\" rule applies to the 1s valence orbital, so it is described by basis functions made from 3, 1, and 1 primitive Gaussians. The total is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitives.\n*   **Polarization primitives**: The second asterisk (\\*\\*) adds one set of p-type polarization functions (p_x, p_y, p_z). Each of these three functions is a single uncontracted primitive Gaussian. This adds 3 primitives.\n*   **Total for Hydrogen**: 5 (for s) + 3 (for p) = **8 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n### For a Second-Row Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen):\n\nThese atoms have 1s core orbitals and 2s and 2p valence orbitals.\n\n*   **Core primitives (1s orbital)**: The \"6\" indicates that the 1s core orbital is represented by 6 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Valence s-primitives (2s orbital)**: The \"311\" rule means the 2s orbital is described by functions made from 3, 1, and 1 primitives, for a total of 5 primitives.\n*   **Valence p-primitives (2p orbitals)**: There are three 2p orbitals (p_x, p_y, p_z). The \"311\" rule applies to each one, so each is described by 5 primitives. The total for the 2p orbitals is 3 × 5 = 15 primitives.\n*   **Polarization primitives**: The first asterisk (\\*) adds one set of d-type polarization functions. A standard set consists of five spherical d-functions, where each is a single primitive Gaussian. This adds 5 primitives.\n*   **Total for a Second-Row Heavy Atom**: 6 (core) + 5 (valence s) + 15 (valence p) + 5 (polarization d) = **31 primitive Gaussians**.\n\nAs an example, for a methane molecule (CH₄), the total number of primitive Gaussians would be: 31 (for Carbon) + 4 × 8 (for each Hydrogen) = 63 primitive Gaussians.\n\n<<<The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set depends on the atom. For a hydrogen atom, there are 8 primitive Gaussians. For a second-row heavy atom (like C, N, or O), there are 31 primitive Gaussians.>>>"
