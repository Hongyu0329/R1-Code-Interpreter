    "The VC (Vapnik-Chervonenkis) dimension of a hypothesis class is the size of the largest set of points that the class can \"shatter\". A set of points is shattered by a hypothesis class if for every possible binary labeling of those points, there exists a hypothesis in the class that can produce that labeling.\n\nThe hypothesis class in question is $H_{z-ones}=\\{h:X \\to \\{0,1\\}: |\\{x: h(x)=1\\}|=z\\}$, where $|X|=T$ and $z$ is a positive integer. This is the set of all binary classifiers that label exactly $z$ points in the domain $X$ as 1.\n\nTo determine the VC dimension, we need to find the largest integer $d$ such that there exists a subset $S \\subseteq X$ with $|S|=d$ that can be shattered by $H_{z-ones}$.\n\nLet $S$ be a subset of $X$ with size $d$. For $H_{z-ones}$ to shatter $S$, it must be able to realize any of the $2^d$ possible labelings of the points in $S$. Let's consider an arbitrary labeling of $S$, where $k$ points are labeled 1 and $d-k$ points are labeled 0, for any $k$ from $0$ to $d$.\n\nFor a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ to produce this labeling, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The hypothesis $h$ must match the labeling on $S$.\n2.  The total number of points in $X$ for which $h(x)=1$ must be exactly $z$.\n\nTo satisfy these conditions, the $k$ points in $S$ designated as 1 must be labeled as 1. To reach the required total of $z$ points labeled as 1, an additional $z-k$ points must be chosen from the set $X \\setminus S$ and also be labeled as 1. The remaining points in $X \\setminus S$ will be labeled as 0.\n\nThis is only possible if we can actually choose $z-k$ points from the $T-d$ points available in $X \\setminus S$. This feasibility must hold for all possible labelings of $S$, which means it must hold for every possible value of $k$ from $0$ to $d$.\n\nThe number of points to be chosen from $X \\setminus S$, which is $z-k$, must be between 0 and the size of $X \\setminus S$, which is $T-d$. So, for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, ..., d\\}$, the following inequality must be true:\n$0 \\le z-k \\le T-d$\n\nThis can be broken down into two separate conditions that must hold for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, ..., d\\}$:\n1.  $z-k \\ge 0 \\implies k \\le z$. This must hold for all $k$ up to $d$. The most restrictive case is when $k$ is at its maximum value, $k=d$. Thus, we must have $d \\le z$.\n2.  $z-k \\le T-d \\implies d-k \\le T-z$. This must hold for all $k$ from $0$ to $d$. The left side of the inequality is maximized when $k$ is at its minimum value, $k=0$. Thus, we must have $d \\le T-z$.\n\nFor a set of size $d$ to be shattered, both conditions must be met. Therefore, $d$ must be less than or equal to both $z$ and $T-z$. This means that any set of size $d \\le \\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered. This establishes a lower bound for the VC dimension: VCdim$(H_{z-ones}) \\ge \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\nNext, we must show that no set of size $d = \\min(z, T-z) + 1$ can be shattered.\nThere are two cases:\n*   **Case 1: $z \\le T-z$**. In this case, $\\min(z, T-z) = z$. We must show that no set of size $d = z+1$ can be shattered. Consider the labeling for a set $S$ of size $z+1$ where all points are labeled 1. To realize this labeling, a hypothesis must label at least $z+1$ points as 1. However, every hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$ must label exactly $z$ points as 1. Therefore, this labeling cannot be produced, and the set $S$ cannot be shattered.\n*   **Case 2: $z > T-z$**. In this case, $\\min(z, T-z) = T-z$. We must show that no set of size $d = T-z+1$ can be shattered. Consider the labeling for a set $S$ of size $T-z+1$ where all points are labeled 0. To realize this labeling, a hypothesis must label all $z$ of its required 1s from the points in $X \\setminus S$. However, the size of $X \\setminus S$ is $T-d = T-(T-z+1) = z-1$. It is impossible to choose $z$ points from a set containing only $z-1$ points. Therefore, this labeling cannot be produced, and the set $S$ cannot be shattered.\n\nSince we have shown that any set of size $\\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered, and no set of size $\\min(z, T-z) + 1$ can be, the VC dimension is exactly $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n<<<min(z, T-z)>>>"
