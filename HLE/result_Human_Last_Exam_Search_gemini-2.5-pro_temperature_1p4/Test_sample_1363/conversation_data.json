    "The technique of the European Tango is distinct from the other ballroom dances, primarily due to its lack of swing, sway, rise, and fall. This results in a characteristically sharp, staccato movement where each step is a distinct action. In swing dances like the Waltz or Foxtrot, turns are generated through momentum and the continuous, flowing \"swing\" of the body, which allows for variations in the degree of rotation.\n\nIn contrast, a Tango reverse turn has a very specific amount of rotation prescribed for each step, executed through precise foot placement and body action (CBM) rather than momentum. The technical specifications for a figure like the Open Reverse Turn detail exact fractions of a turn to be completed between steps (e.g., 3/8 to L between steps 2 and 3). To rotate more than this—to overturn the figure—would require introducing swing or sway, which is a fundamental breach of Tango technique.\n\nWhile other dances like the Waltz, Foxtrot, and even Quickstep have figures with names like \"Overturned Spin Turn\" or \"Overturned Turning Lock,\" showing that overturning is an accepted and named variation, this concept is absent from foundational Tango technique. For instance, instructions for a Slow Foxtrot Reverse Turn explicitly warn the dancer *not* to overturn, implying it's a possible but incorrect action within that specific figure. Similarly, advanced figures in Viennese Waltz and Waltz involve deliberate overturning as part of their choreography.\n\nThe unique mechanics of the Tango, which separate each step and forbid the use of swing and momentum for rotation, make it the dance in which overturning a standard reverse turn is technically impossible without fundamentally disregarding the dance's core technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
