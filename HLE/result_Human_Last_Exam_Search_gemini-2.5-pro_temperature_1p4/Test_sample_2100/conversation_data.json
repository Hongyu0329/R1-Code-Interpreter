    "Andrei Voznesensky's poem \"Saga\" immortalized Nikolai Rezanov, a Russian nobleman and diplomat. The poem later formed the basis of the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\". Voznesensky poetically wondered about the location of Rezanov's final resting place, a question that was answered in the latter half of the 20th century.\n\nNikolai Petrovich Rezanov was a key figure in the Russian-American Company and promoted the Russian colonization of Alaska and California. During a mission to California in 1806, he became engaged to Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the commandant of the Presidio of San Francisco.\n\nOn his return journey to St. Petersburg to gain the Tsar's permission for the marriage, Rezanov fell ill and died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in March 1807. He was buried there, but his original gravesite was later destroyed. In the late 20th century, his remains were moved, and on October 28, 2000, a memorial with a white cross was dedicated at his grave in the Trinity churchyard of Krasnoyarsk. One side of the cross bears the inscription \"Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov 1764 — 1807. I will never forget you,\" and the other side reads, \"Maria Concepcion de Arguello 1791 — 1857. I will never see you again,\" with the quotes originating from the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\".\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
