    "When viewed as matrices, the linear algebraic rank of a flag is determined by the number of linearly independent rows or columns. Assuming the values for each color are chosen to maximize the rank, the rank will be equal to the number of distinct colors in the flag, provided the geometric arrangement of these colors allows for linear independence. The flag of Denmark features two colors: red and white. With a design that is not monochromatic, its maximal rank is 2.\n\nTo find which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the Danish flag, we must identify the nations whose flags consist of exactly two colors. An analysis of the 54 national flags of Africa reveals the following countries have flags with two colors:\n\n*   **Morocco:** The Moroccan flag is red with a green pentagram in the center.\n*   **Nigeria:** The Nigerian flag consists of three vertical stripes, with green on the outer stripes and white in the middle.\n*   **Somalia:** The Somalian flag is light blue with a single white five-pointed star in the center.\n*   **Tunisia:** The Tunisian flag is red with a central white disc containing a red star and crescent.\n\nThese four nations are the only ones in Africa whose flags are composed of just two colors. Therefore, they share the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n<<<Morocco, Nigeria, Somalia, Tunisia>>>"
