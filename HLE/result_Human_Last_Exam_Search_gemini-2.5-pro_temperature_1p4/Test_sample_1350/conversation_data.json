    "In William Morris's novel, *The House of the Wolfings*, the character Hall-Sun makes a direct reference to a \"she-wolf's nursling,\" which readers will recognize as an allusion to the Roman founding myth of Romulus and Remus.\n\nWhile speaking with her father, Thiodolf, Hall-Sun reminisces about their shared past, saying, \"Keep this in thine heart, O father, that I shall remember all. Since thou liftedst the she-wolf's nursling in the oak-tree's leafy hall.\" This mention of a child raised by a she-wolf is a clear parallel to the legend of Romulus and Remus, who were said to have been suckled by a she-wolf after being abandoned.\n\nAnother character, the Wood-Sun, also describes the Romans' religious reverence for their symbols of war after visiting one of their cities. She tells Thiodolf, \"And I tell thee their banner of battle is a wise and a mighty God.\" This observation highlights the martial nature of Roman belief and ceremony.\n\nHowever, it is Hall-Sun's specific and evocative phrase, \"the she-wolf's nursling,\" that most directly points to the iconic imagery of Rome's origin story.\n\n<<<Hall-Sun>>>"
