    "The value computed as the time between heartbeats when tracking HR and HRV using PPG is called the **Interbeat Interval (IBI)**.\n\nHeart Rate Variability (HRV) is the measurement of the variation in the time between consecutive heartbeats. This time duration is referred to as the beat-to-beat interval or, more specifically, the Interbeat Interval (IBI), which is typically measured in milliseconds.\n\nWhile you may also encounter the term \"R-R interval,\" this specifically refers to the interval between successive R-waves in an electrocardiogram (ECG) recording. Since your question specifies the use of Photoplethysmography (PPG), \"Interbeat Interval (IBI)\" is the more appropriate and accurate term.\n\n<<<Interbeat Interval (IBI)>>>"
