    "Following the rules of the elementary cellular automaton Rule 110, the binary pattern obtained after 20 iterations starting from a single cell in state 1 is **1111101100111**.\n\nThe evolution of the pattern progresses as follows:\n\n*   **Generation 0:** `1`\n*   **Generation 1:** `11`\n*   **Generation 2:** `111`\n*   **Generation 3:** `1101`\n*   **Generation 4:** `11111`\n*   **Generation 5:** `110001`\n*   **Generation 6:** `1110011`\n*   **Generation 7:** `11010111`\n*   **Generation 8:** `111111101`\n*   **Generation 9:** `1100000111`\n*   **Generation 10:** `1110001101`\n*   **Generation 11:** `1101001111`\n*   **Generation 12:** `1111101001`\n*   **Generation 13:** `11000111011`\n*   **Generation 14:** `11100101111`\n*   **Generation 15:** `110101111001`\n*   **Generation 16:** `111111101011`\n*   **Generation 17:** `1100000111111`\n*   **Generation 18:** `1110001100001`\n*   **Generation 19:** `1101001100011`\n*   **Generation 20:** `1111101100111`\n\nRule 110 is a well-documented elementary cellular automaton where the state of a cell (represented as 0 for \"off\" or 1 for \"on\") in the next generation is determined by its current state and the state of its two immediate neighbors. The rule is defined by the binary sequence 01101110, which corresponds to the decimal number 110. This sequence specifies the outcome for each of the eight possible three-cell neighborhood patterns. Despite its simple rules, Rule 110 is known for its complex and unpredictable behavior, and it has been proven to be capable of universal computation.\n\n<<<1111101100111>>>"
