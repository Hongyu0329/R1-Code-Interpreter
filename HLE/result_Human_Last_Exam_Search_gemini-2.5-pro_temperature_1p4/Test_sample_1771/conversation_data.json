    "The Proto-Indo-European (PIE) present tense verb *seh₂gieti, meaning '(s)he gives a sign' or '(s)he tracks', evolves into the following forms in the Germanic languages through a series of regular sound changes.\n\nHere is the step-by-step development and the resulting forms in Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German:\n\n### **Proto-Germanic: *\\*sōkīþi***\n\nThe transformation from PIE to Proto-Germanic involves several key sound laws:\n\n*   **Vowel changes**: The PIE sequence *eh₂g becomes **\\*ōk** in Proto-Germanic. The present tense thematic vowel *e becomes **\\*i**.\n*   **Grimm's Law**: The PIE voiced stop *g shifts to the voiceless stop **\\*k**.\n*   **Verner's Law**: This does not apply to the consonant in this position.\n*   The PIE third-person singular ending *-eti becomes **\\*-īþi** in Proto-Germanic for this class of verbs.\n\nThus, PIE *seh₂gieti gives Proto-Germanic **\\*sōkīþi** (\"(s)he seeks\"). The reconstructed infinitive form of this verb is **\\*sōkijaną** (\"to seek\").\n\n### **Descendants in Germanic Languages**\n\nFrom the Proto-Germanic infinitive *\\*sōkijaną*, the verb develops as follows in the daughter languages:\n\n*   **Old Norse**: **sǿkja** (or *sœkja*, *sækja*)\n    The vowel *ō* in Proto-Germanic undergoes *i-umlaut* (mutation) caused by the following *j*, becoming *ǿ* or *œ*. The final *-anan* of the infinitive is lost, and the *j* is retained. The third-person singular form is *sǿkir*.\n\n*   **Old English**: **sēċan** (or *sœ̄ċan*)\n    In Old English, the Proto-Germanic *\\*ō* is fronted to *œ̄* due to i-umlaut, which is then typically written as *ē*. The Proto-Germanic consonant cluster **\\*kj** undergoes palatalization, becoming the affricate sound represented by **ċ** (/tʃ/). The third-person singular present form is **sēċþ**.\n\n*   **Old High German**: **suohhen** (or *suochen*)\n    The Proto-Germanic *\\*ō* diphthongized to **uo** in Old High German. The palatalization of *k* before *j* does not occur in the same way as in Old English; instead, the cluster geminates (doubles) to **hh** (pronounced as a long voiceless fricative /xx/). The third-person singular is *suohhit*."
