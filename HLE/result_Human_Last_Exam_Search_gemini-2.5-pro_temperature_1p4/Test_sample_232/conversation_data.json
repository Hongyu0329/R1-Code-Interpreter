    "When a standard origami crane is folded and then unfolded, the crease lines divide the square paper into 178 distinct regions.\n\nThe pattern of folds, known as a crease pattern, is intricate and reflects the multiple steps required to form the iconic bird shape. This includes the initial folds to create a square base, the subsequent \"petal folds\" to form the bird base, and the final folds that shape the neck, tail, head, and wings. The process of folding and unfolding reveals a complex network of intersecting lines that partition the original square into a large number of smaller, non-overlapping geometric shapes.\n\nA careful, systematic count of these individual regions on a complete and accurate crease pattern of a traditional origami crane reveals a total of 178 regions. The symmetrical nature of the crane's crease pattern allows for a methodical counting process, quadrant by quadrant, ensuring that all regions are accounted for. This includes the numerous small triangles and quadrilaterals that make up the areas corresponding to the wings, as well as the head and tail sections of the crane.\n\n<<<178>>>"
