    "The number of non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables needed to parametrize the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D with two replicas is 8.\n\nThis result is derived from the structure of the model's target space, which is a mathematical manifold whose dimensions correspond to the variables of the theory. For a supersymmetric model combined with the replica trick, the target space is a symmetric superspace G/H, where G and H are supergroups determined by the system's symmetries and the number of replicas.\n\nFor symmetry class D with `n` replicas, the appropriate target superspace is identified as G/H = OSp(2n|2n) / (OSp(n|n) x OSp(n|n)). Given that the problem specifies two replicas, we set n=2, leading to the superspace OSp(4|4) / (OSp(2|2) x OSp(2|2)).\n\nThe number of bosonic variables is the dimension of the bosonic part of this space, which is calculated as the difference between the dimensions of the bosonic subgroups of G and H.\n\n*   The bosonic part of the supergroup G = OSp(4|4) is O(4) × Sp(4,ℝ). Its dimension is dim(O(4)) + dim(Sp(4,ℝ)) = 6 + 10 = 16.\n*   The bosonic part of the supergroup H = OSp(2|2) × OSp(2|2) is [O(2) × Sp(2,ℝ)] × [O(2) × Sp(2,ℝ)]. Its dimension is [dim(O(2)) + dim(Sp(2,ℝ))] + [dim(O(2)) + dim(Sp(2,ℝ))] = [1 + 3] + [1 + 3] = 8.\n\nThe number of non-Grassmann variables is the difference between these dimensions: 16 - 8 = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
