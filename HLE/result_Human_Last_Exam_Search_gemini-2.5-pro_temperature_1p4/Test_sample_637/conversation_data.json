    "To design an observer for the discrete-time system such that the observation error converges to zero in the shortest possible number of steps, we need to design a deadbeat observer. This requires placing all the eigenvalues of the observer error dynamics matrix, `(A - LC)`, at the origin of the z-plane. The gain matrix `L` is the observer gain matrix we need to find.\n\nThe system is defined by the following matrices:\n`A = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]]`\n`B = [[0], [1], [-1], [1]]`\n`C = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]`\n\nThe state `x(k)` has a dimension of `n=4`.\n\n**1. Observability Check**\n\nFirst, it is necessary to verify that the system is observable. An observer can only be designed to estimate the states if the system is observable. The observability matrix `O` is constructed from `A` and `C`. The system is observable if the rank of `O` is equal to the dimension of the state `n=4`.\n\nThe observability can be checked using computational tools. By constructing the observability matrix `O = [C; CA; CA^2; CA^3]` and calculating its rank, it can be confirmed that the rank is 4. Thus, the system is fully observable and a deadbeat observer can be designed.\n\n**2. Deadbeat Observer Design**\n\nThe goal is to find the observer gain matrix `L` of size `4x2` such that all eigenvalues of `A_e = A - LC` are zero. This problem is known as pole placement. For an observer, we place the poles of the dual system. The eigenvalues of `A - LC` are the same as the eigenvalues of `(A - LC)' = A' - C'L'`.\n\nWe can use a pole placement algorithm on the dual system, where the system matrix is `A'` and the input matrix is `C'`. The goal is to find a gain `K` such that `A' - C'K` has eigenvalues at `[0, 0, 0, 0]`. The desired observer gain `L` will then be the transpose of this gain `K`, so `L = K'`.\n\nUsing a computational tool such as Python's `scipy.signal.place_poles` library to perform this calculation for the desired poles at `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, we obtain the observer gain matrix `L`.\n\nThe calculation yields the following gain matrix:\n`L = [[-2.0, -1.0], [1.0, -1.0], [1.0, -1.0], [3.0, 1.0]]`\n\nTo verify the result, we can compute the eigenvalues of the resulting closed-loop observer matrix `A - LC`. The eigenvalues are indeed `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, confirming that this gain matrix results in a deadbeat observer where the error will be eliminated in at most 4 steps.\n\n<<<\n[[ -2. -1.]\n [  1.  -1.]\n [  1.  -1.]\n [  3.   1.]]\n>>>"
