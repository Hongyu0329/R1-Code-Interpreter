    "The reaction described is a classic example of directed ortho-metalation (DoM), followed by electrophilic quenching.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Reactants and Reagents**:\n    *   **Substrate**: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This molecule has a benzene ring substituted with two groups: a tertiary amide (-CONEt₂) and a tertiary amine (-NMe₂), positioned meta to each other.\n    *   **Base/Ligand System**: sec-Butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine). sec-BuLi is a very strong and sterically hindered base. TMEDA is a chelating agent that complexes with the lithium ion, breaking down alkyllithium aggregates and increasing the kinetic basicity of the base. This combination is a powerful reagent for the deprotonation of weakly acidic protons, particularly on aromatic rings.\n    *   **Electrophile**: Methyl iodide (CH₃I), a classic electrophile used to introduce a methyl group.\n\n2.  **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)**:\n    *   Directed ortho-metalation is a regioselective reaction where a functional group on an aromatic ring, known as a Directed Metalation Group (DMG), directs a strong base to deprotonate one of the adjacent (ortho) positions. The DMG achieves this by coordinating to the lithium ion of the organolithium reagent, bringing the basic alkyl group into close proximity to the ortho-proton.\n    *   Both the tertiary amide group (-CONR₂) and the tertiary amine group (-NMe₂) are known and effective DMGs.\n    *   When multiple DMGs are present on a ring, the regioselectivity is determined by the relative directing power of the groups. The tertiary amide group is one of the most powerful DMGs, significantly stronger than the tertiary amino group.\n    *   In N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, the powerful N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt₂) will direct the lithiation. The positions ortho to this group are C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 position is also ortho to the -NMe₂ group, while the C6 position is para to it. The directing effects of both groups are therefore cooperative towards the C2 position, making it the most acidic and most likely site for deprotonation.\n    *   The sec-BuLi/TMEDA complex will therefore abstract the proton from the C2 position, forming a new carbon-lithium bond. This creates a highly nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate.\n\n3.  **Electrophilic Quench**:\n    *   The aryllithium intermediate then reacts with the added electrophile, methyl iodide.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon at the C2 position attacks the electrophilic methyl group of CH₃I, displacing the iodide ion in an Sɴ2-type reaction.\n    *   This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond, attaching the methyl group to the C2 position of the benzene ring.\n\n### The Final Product:\n\nThe final compound obtained after the two steps is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nThe sequence is as follows:\n1.  Deprotonation at C2: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide reacts with sec-BuLi/TMEDA to form N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n2.  Methylation: The lithiated intermediate reacts with methyl iodide to yield the final product.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
