    "The two Nobel laureates featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why,\" were physicist and Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann and Indian commentator and Nobel laureate Amartya Sen.\n\nA Reddit thread identifies Murray Gell-Mann as the physicist with white hair and glasses in one of the commercials. The thread also inquires about the identity of an Indian commentator, who is identified as Amartya Sen.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign was launched by Enron in 1999. The commercials featured a series of disconnected images and artificially manipulated voices chanting \"why,\" with the aim of portraying Enron as a company that questioned conventional wisdom. The campaign was developed by the advertising firm Conquest, which interviewed Enron executives to capture the company's \"restless dissatisfaction with the status quo.\" While the campaign was intended to project an image of innovation, the company collapsed in 2001 due to a massive accounting fraud scandal.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen>>>"
