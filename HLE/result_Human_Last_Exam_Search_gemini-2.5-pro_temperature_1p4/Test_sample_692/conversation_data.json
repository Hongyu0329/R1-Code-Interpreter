    "**San Andrés Cylinder Seal and San José Mogote Monument 3 Vie for Earliest Recorded Date in the Americas**\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is a subject of scholarly discussion, with two primary candidates emerging from the Olmec and Zapotec civilizations, both dating to the 7th century BCE. These artifacts, the San Andrés cylinder seal and Monument 3 from San José Mogote, predate later Maya calendar inscriptions by several centuries.\n\nThe San Andrés cylinder seal, an Olmec artifact found near La Venta in Tabasco, Mexico, is dated to approximately 650 BCE. The glyphs carved into this fist-sized ceramic seal are interpreted by archaeologists as representing the date \"3 Ajaw,\" a day in the 260-day Mesoamerican sacred calendar. This calendar was fundamental to the ritual and daily life of many Mesoamerican cultures. The seal was discovered in a refuse deposit from a feast, suggesting that writing was linked to sacred and ritual activities. The association of the glyph with the concept of kingship further highlights its significance.\n\nA strong contender for the earliest recorded date is Monument 3, a carved stone from the Zapotec site of San José Mogote in Oaxaca, Mexico. This monument depicts a slain captive and includes glyphs between the figure's legs that are interpreted as the name \"1 Earthquake,\" another day name from the 260-day calendar. New radiocarbon dating places this monument no later than 630–560 BCE, making it roughly contemporaneous with the San Andrés cylinder seal.\n\nWhile another Olmec artifact, the Cascajal Block, is dated even earlier to around 900 BCE and is considered by many to be the oldest example of writing in the Americas, the 62 incised characters on it have not been deciphered as calendrical dates.\n\nThe earliest known Maya calendar date, found at San Bartolo, Guatemala, is \"7 Deer,\" inscribed on mural fragments dated to between 300 and 200 BCE. This is significantly later than both the Olmec and Zapotec examples.\n\nTherefore, the earliest confirmed recorded dates in an aboriginal writing system in the Americas are found on the San Andrés cylinder seal and San José Mogote's Monument 3, both representing specific days within the 260-day calendar and dating to a similar period in the 7th century BCE.\n\n<<<The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is from the 7th century BCE, with strong evidence from both the Olmec and Zapotec civilizations. The San Andrés cylinder seal (Olmec, c. 650 BCE) records the date \"3 Ajaw,\" and Monument 3 from San José Mogote (Zapotec, c. 630-560 BCE) records the date \"1 Earthquake.\" Both dates are from the 260-day Mesoamerican calendar.>>>"
