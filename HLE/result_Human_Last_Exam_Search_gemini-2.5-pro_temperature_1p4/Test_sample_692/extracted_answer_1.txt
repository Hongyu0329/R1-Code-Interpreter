The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is from the 7th century BCE, with strong evidence from both the Olmec and Zapotec civilizations. The San Andrés cylinder seal (Olmec, c. 650 BCE) records the date "3 Ajaw," and Monument 3 from San José Mogote (Zapotec, c. 630-560 BCE) records the date "1 Earthquake." Both dates are from the 260-day Mesoamerican calendar.
