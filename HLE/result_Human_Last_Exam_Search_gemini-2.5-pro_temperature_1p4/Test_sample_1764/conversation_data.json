    "An isometric embedding of a metric space $(X, d_X)$ into a Banach space $(B, ||\\cdot||)$ is a function $f: X \\to B$ such that for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, the equality $||f(x_1) - f(x_2)|| = d_X(x_1, x_2)$ holds. The question asks for the smallest possible number of such embeddings for a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$.\n\nLet's analyze the number of possible isometric embeddings, which we denote by $N$.\n\nFirst, consider the trivial case of a Banach space, the space containing only the zero vector, $B = \\{0\\}$. This is a valid Banach space, and its cardinality is $K=1$. For an isometric embedding $f: X \\to \\{0\\}$ to exist, the distance between the images of any two points must be $||f(x_1) - f(x_2)|| = ||0 - 0|| = 0$. This implies that for the embedding to be isometric, the distance $d_X(x_1, x_2)$ must be 0 for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$. This condition holds if and only if $X$ is a space consisting of a single point, let's say $X = \\{p\\}$. A single-point space is a finite ultrametric space, as the ultrametric inequality $d(x,y) \\le \\max(d(x,z), d(z,y))$ holds trivially.\n\nFor $X = \\{p\\}$ and $B = \\{0\\}$, there is only one possible function, $f(p) = 0$. This function is an isometric embedding because $d_X(p, p) = 0$ and $||f(p) - f(p)|| = ||0 - 0|| = 0$. Therefore, in this case, the number of isometric embeddings is exactly 1.\n\nNow, consider any non-trivial Banach space, i.e., a Banach space $B$ where $B \\neq \\{0\\}$. Any such Banach space over the real or complex numbers is an infinite set. If an isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$ exists, one can construct other embeddings. For any vector $v \\in B$, the translation map $T_v: B \\to B$ defined by $T_v(y) = y + v$ is an isometry of the Banach space $B$. Consequently, if $f$ is an isometric embedding, then the composition $g_v = T_v \\circ f$ is also an isometric embedding, since:\n$||g_v(x_1) - g_v(x_2)|| = ||(f(x_1) + v) - (f(x_2) + v)|| = ||f(x_1) - f(x_2)|| = d_X(x_1, x_2)$.\n\nSince $B$ is a non-trivial Banach space, it contains infinitely many vectors $v$. Each distinct vector $v$ defines a distinct embedding $g_v$. Thus, if at least one isometric embedding exists into a non-trivial Banach space, there must be infinitely many such embeddings.\n\nIt is known that for any finite ultrametric space $X$, an isometric embedding into certain infinite-dimensional Banach spaces always exists. For example, every finite ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded into a Hilbert space. Since these are non-trivial Banach spaces, the number of embeddings in these cases is infinite.\n\nSo, the possible number of isometric embeddings is either 0 (if no such embedding exists), 1 (in the trivial case identified above), or infinite. The question asks for the smallest *possible* number, which implies we are looking for a situation where embeddings do exist. Comparing the possible non-zero values, 1 is smaller than infinity.\n\nThus, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 1, which occurs when $X$ is a single-point space and $B$ is the zero Banach space.\n\n<<<1>>>"
