Based on the information provided, the most pertinent counseling recommendation a pharmacist could make for Allison's medicines would be to advise her that the headache she is experiencing is a potential side effect of all three of her prescribed medications (Atorvastatin, Junel Fe, and Fluoxetine). Additionally, the pharmacist should caution her about the use of Excedrin, as its aspirin component can interact with her Fluoxetine and increase the risk of bleeding. The pharmacist should also make her aware of the potential interaction between Atorvastatin and Fluoxetine, which could increase her risk of muscle-related side effects, and the interaction between Atorvastatin and Junel Fe, which could increase side effects from her birth control.
