    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\nBased on search results, the prime factorization of 53599 is $7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. Let's verify this calculation:\n$7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31 = 91 \\times 589 = 53599$.\nThe factorization is correct. So, $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ with $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$.\n\n### 2. Structure of a Primitive Dirichlet Character\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo the prime factor $p_i$.\nFor $\\chi$ to be a primitive character of conductor $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$, each component character $\\chi_i$ must be a primitive character modulo $p_i$.\nSince each $p_i$ is a prime, a character $\\chi_i$ modulo $p_i$ is primitive if and only if it is not the principal character, which means its order must be greater than 1.\n\n### 3. Condition on the Order\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters. We are given that the order of $\\chi$ is 6.\nLet $o_i = \\text{order}(\\chi_i)$. Then we must have:\n$\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$.\n\nThis condition implies that each $o_i$ must be a divisor of 6, i.e., $o_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$. Since each $\\chi_i$ must be primitive, its order $o_i$ must be greater than 1. Thus, for each $i$, $o_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n### 4. Counting Available Characters for Each Prime Factor\nThe number of primitive characters of order $k > 1$ modulo a prime $p$ is equal to $\\phi(k)$ if $k$ divides $(p-1)$, and 0 otherwise. Here $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function.\n\nWe calculate the number of available primitive characters for each prime factor with orders 2, 3, or 6. We use $\\phi(2)=1$, $\\phi(3)=2$, and $\\phi(6)=2$.\n\n*   **For $p_1 = 7$**: $p_1-1 = 6$.\n    *   Characters of order 2: $2|6$, so there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character.\n    *   Characters of order 3: $3|6$, so there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters.\n    *   Characters of order 6: $6|6$, so there are $\\phi(6)=2$ characters.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_1$ is $1+2+2 = 5$.\n\n*   **For $p_2 = 13$**: $p_2-1 = 12$.\n    *   Characters of order 2: $2|12$, so there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character.\n    *   Characters of order 3: $3|12$, so there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters.\n    *   Characters of order 6: $6|12$, so there are $\\phi(6)=2$ characters.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_2$ is $1+2+2 = 5$.\n\n*   **For $p_3 = 19$**: $p_3-1 = 18$.\n    *   Characters of order 2: $2|18$, so there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character.\n    *   Characters of order 3: $3|18$, so there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters.\n    *   Characters of order 6: $6|18$, so there are $\\phi(6)=2$ characters.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_3$ is $1+2+2 = 5$.\n\n*   **For $p_4 = 31$**: $p_4-1 = 30$.\n    *   Characters of order 2: $2|30$, so there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character.\n    *   Characters of order 3: $3|30$, so there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters.\n    *   Characters of order 6: $6|30$, so there are $\\phi(6)=2$ characters.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_4$ is $1+2+2 = 5$.\n\n### 5. Combining the Counts\nWe need to find the number of 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ whose orders $(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)$ satisfy $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$. We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\n1.  **Total characters with orders dividing 6**: For each component $\\chi_i$, there are 5 possible choices (orders 2, 3, or 6). The total number of such combinations is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$. This counts all characters where the lcm of the orders divides 6.\n\n2.  **Characters with orders dividing 3**: We must subtract the cases where the lcm is not 6. This happens if the lcm divides 3 or divides 2. For the lcm to divide 3, all component orders $o_i$ must divide 3. The only possible primitive order is 3. For each prime factor, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3. The total number of such combinations is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\n3.  **Characters with orders dividing 2**: For the lcm to divide 2, all component orders $o_i$ must divide 2. The only possible primitive order is 2. For each prime factor, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2. The total number of such combinations is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\nThe set of characters whose orders' lcm divides 3 and the set of characters whose orders' lcm divides 2 are disjoint (since the primitive orders would have to be 3 and 2 respectively). Therefore, we can simply subtract these counts from the total.\n\nThe number of primitive characters of conductor 53599 and order 6 is:\n(Total with lcm dividing 6) - (Total with lcm dividing 3) - (Total with lcm dividing 2)\n$= 625 - 16 - 1 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
