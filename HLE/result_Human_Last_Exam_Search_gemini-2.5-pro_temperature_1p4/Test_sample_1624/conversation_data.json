    "Yes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$. The upper bound is $2^{\\aleph_0}$, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nHere is the reasoning that leads to this conclusion:\n1.  Let $U$ be the dense open subset of the connected metric space $X$. The condition that each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ means that $U$ is a 1-dimensional topological manifold.\n\n2.  Every topological manifold is second-countable. For a metric space, being second-countable is equivalent to being separable, which means it contains a countable dense subset. Thus, the subset $U$ is a separable space.\n\n3.  Let $D$ be a countable dense subset of $U$.\n\n4.  We can show that $D$ is also a dense subset of the entire space $X$. To do this, let $x$ be any point in $X$ and let $N$ be any open neighborhood of $x$. Since $U$ is dense in $X$, the intersection $N \\cap U$ is a non-empty open set within $U$. Because $D$ is dense in $U$, this non-empty open set must contain a point from $D$. Therefore, any neighborhood of any point in $X$ contains a point from $D$, which by definition means $D$ is dense in $X$.\n\n5.  Since $X$ has a countable dense subset $D$, $X$ is a separable metric space.\n\n6.  A fundamental result in topology states that any separable metric space has a cardinality of at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$. This is because every point in the space can be uniquely determined by a countable subset of a countable base of open sets, and the number of such subsets is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nThe connectedness of $X$ implies that if $X$ has more than one point, it must be uncountable. Since $U$ must be non-empty and contains a subset homeomorphic to an open interval of $\\mathbb{R}$, $U$ is uncountable, and therefore $X$ is also uncountable.\n\nThus, the cardinality of $X$ is bounded above by $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n<<<The upper bound on the cardinality of X is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.>>>"
