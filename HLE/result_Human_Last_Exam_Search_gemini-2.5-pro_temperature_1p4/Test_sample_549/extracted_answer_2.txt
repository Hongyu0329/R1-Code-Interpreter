The quantum correction to the conductivity for an electron in a bulk semiconductor is approximately:

**δσ ≈ - (e² / (2π²ħl))**

where:
*   `e` is the elementary charge.
*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.
*   `l` is the electron's elastic mean free path.

This result shows a negative correction, meaning the conductivity is reduced due to weak localization. The magnitude of the correction is inversely proportional to the mean free path, indicating that the effect is more pronounced in more disordered systems (shorter `l`).
