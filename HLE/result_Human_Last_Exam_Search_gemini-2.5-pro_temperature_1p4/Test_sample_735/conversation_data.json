    "There are **11** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called product-free if for all *a, b* in *S*, the product *ab* is not in *S*. Such a set is maximal by inclusion (also called locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in *G*.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing a maximal product-free set of size 3 was completed by Chimere Stanley Anabanti and Sarah Hart. They proved that if a finite group *G* has a maximal product-free set of size 3, then the order of *G* must be at most 24. Their work provides a complete list of these groups.\n\nThe 11 finite groups are:\n*   The cyclic group of order 7, denoted C₇\n*   The cyclic group of order 8, denoted C₈\n*   The cyclic group of order 9, denoted C₉\n*   The cyclic group of order 10, denoted C₁₀\n*   The dihedral group of order 8, denoted D₈\n*   The dihedral group of order 10, denoted D₁₀\n*   The dihedral group of order 12, denoted D₁₂\n*   The alternating group of order 12, denoted A₄\n*   The quaternion group of order 8, denoted Q₈\n*   The direct product of the cyclic group of order 3 and the cyclic group of order 3, denoted C₃ x C₃\n*   The semi-direct product of the cyclic group of order 3 and the cyclic group of order 4, denoted C₃ ⋊ C₄ (with a specific non-trivial homomorphism)\n\nThese groups and their corresponding maximal product-free sets of size 3 are listed in the paper by Anabanti and Hart.\n\n<<<11>>>"
