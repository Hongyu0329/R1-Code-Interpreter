    "When a gene is duplicated in a eukaryotic genome, several outcomes are possible. Understanding these is key to identifying the most likely mechanism for the retention and divergence of the two copies.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the potential fates and mechanisms listed:\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer between similar sequences. It tends to make duplicate genes more alike (homogenization), working against divergence. Therefore, it is not the primary mechanism for retaining two *different* functional copies.\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate for a duplicate gene. One copy accumulates harmful mutations and becomes non-functional, turning into a \"pseudogene.\" Since this involves the *loss* of a functional gene, it is not a mechanism for the *retention* of two working copies.\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy maintains the original ancestral function, while the other acquires mutations that give it an entirely new function. Natural selection then preserves both copies because each performs a distinct, necessary role. This is a classic model for retention and divergence.\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or was expressed in multiple tissues. After duplication, each copy suffers mutations that degrade or silence a different part of the original gene's function or expression pattern. As a result, the two genes essentially divide the labor of the ancestral gene, and both copies are required to perform the complete original set of functions. This is also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model.\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary process where an organism diversifies rapidly into a multitude of new forms. It is not a mechanism at the molecular level that explains what happens to individual duplicated genes.\n\n**Comparing Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization:**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization explain the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, the question asks for the *most likely* mechanism.\n\nSubfunctionalization is often considered a more probable and common route for the initial preservation of duplicate genes. This is because it relies on loss-of-function mutations, which are far more frequent than the specific, rare gain-of-function mutations required for neofunctionalization. By partitioning the ancestral functions, subfunctionalization creates a situation where both genes become essential through a neutral, passive process, thus preserving them from being lost to pseudogenization. This preservation provides more evolutionary time for one of the copies to potentially acquire a new function later on, in a process some call neosubfunctionalization. Therefore, many view subfunctionalization as a critical transition state that facilitates long-term retention and the eventual evolution of novelty.\n\nGiven that subfunctionalization relies on more common mutational events (degeneration) to make both gene copies indispensable, it is considered the most likely mechanism for the initial retention and subsequent divergence of many duplicate genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
