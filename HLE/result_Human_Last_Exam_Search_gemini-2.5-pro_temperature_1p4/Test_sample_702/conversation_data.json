    "I have gathered information about the key concepts: suspension ($\\Sigma$), loop space ($\\Omega$), smash product ($\\wedge$), and connectivity of a map. I've also found results regarding the relationships between these concepts, specifically the adjunction between $\\Sigma$ and $\\Omega$, and properties of connectivity. The Freudenthal suspension theorem is also relevant. I found a particularly relevant result in a paper by J. P. May [26, see Remark 2.19 and the discussion on the Hilton-Milnor splitting], which discusses the connectivity of spaces like the one in the question.\n\nHere's the plan to construct the answer:\n1.  Define the connectivity of a space and a map.\n2.  State the connectivity of the spaces $\\Omega S^4$ and $\\Omega S^6$.\n3.  Use the properties of the smash product and suspension to determine the connectivity of the space $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n4.  State the Hilton-Milnor theorem, which describes the homotopy type of $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n5.  Relate the given map to the Hilton-Milnor splitting and use this to determine the connectivity of the map.\n6.  Synthesize the information to provide a final answer.\n\nI believe I have sufficient information to answer the question without further searches.\n\n\nThe connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is determined by the connectivity of its homotopy fiber. To find this, we first need to understand the connectivity of the spaces involved.\n\n**1. Connectivity of Spaces:**\n\nA space $X$ is said to be *n-connected* if all its homotopy groups $\\pi_i(X)$ are trivial for $i \\leq n$. The connectivity of a space $X$, denoted conn(X), is the largest integer $n$ for which $X$ is $n$-connected.\n\n*   **Connectivity of Loop Spaces:** The loop space functor $\\Omega$ reduces connectivity by one. If a space $Y$ is $k$-connected, then its loop space $\\Omega Y$ is $(k-1)$-connected.\n    *   The 4-sphere, $S^4$, is 3-connected, since $\\pi_i(S^4) = 0$ for $i \\leq 3$ and $\\pi_4(S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, $\\Omega S^4$ is $(3-1)=2$-connected.\n    *   Similarly, the 6-sphere, $S^6$, is 5-connected. Thus, $\\Omega S^6$ is $(5-1)=4$-connected.\n\n*   **Connectivity of Smash Products:** For CW complexes X and Y, the connectivity of their smash product is at least the sum of their individual connectivities plus one: $\\text{conn}(X \\wedge Y) \\geq \\text{conn}(X) + \\text{conn}(Y) + 1$.\n    *   Therefore, the connectivity of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is at least $2 + 4 + 1 = 7$.\n\n*   **Connectivity of Suspensions:** The suspension functor $\\Sigma$ increases connectivity by one. If a space $X$ is $n$-connected, then $\\Sigma X$ is $(n+1)$-connected.\n    *   The space $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is at least 7-connected.\n    *   Therefore, the space $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is at least $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\n\n**2. The Hilton-Milnor Theorem and the map in question:**\n\nThe Hilton-Milnor theorem provides a homotopy decomposition of the loop space of a wedge of spheres. For spheres $S^a$ and $S^b$, the theorem gives:\n$\\Omega(S^a \\vee S^b) \\simeq \\Omega S^a \\times \\Omega S^b \\times \\Omega \\Sigma (\\Omega S^a \\wedge \\Omega S^b)$\n\nIn our case, we are interested in the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.  The space $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homeomorphic to $S^{10}$.  However, the question likely refers to the map that arises in the context of the Hilton-Milnor theorem applied to a wedge of spaces, which after looping gives a product decomposition.\n\nLet's consider the James-Hilton splitting for the suspension of a smash product:\n$\\Sigma(X \\wedge Y) \\simeq \\bigvee_{i \\ge 1} \\Sigma(X^{\\wedge i} \\wedge Y^{\\wedge i} \\wedge [X,Y])$, where $[X,Y]$ is the commutator.\n\nA more direct approach involves the Hilton-Milnor theorem, which gives a homotopy equivalence for the loop space of a wedge sum. A related result, the Hilton-Ganea theorem, states that for connected CW-complexes X and Y, there is a homotopy fibration:\n$\\Sigma(\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y) \\to \\Omega(X \\vee Y) \\to \\Omega X \\times \\Omega Y$\n\nFor the smash product of spheres, we have $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\simeq S^{10}$. So the target space is $\\Omega(S^{10})$, which is 8-connected.\n\nLet's re-examine the map. It's induced by a map of homotopy fibers. This suggests we should look at a fibration sequence. Consider the inclusion of the wedge $S^4 \\vee S^6$ into the product $S^4 \\times S^6$. The homotopy fiber of this inclusion is $\\Omega S^4 * \\Omega S^6$, the join of the loop spaces. The cofiber is $S^4 \\wedge S^6$.\n\nA key result by G. W. Whitehead states that for $(n-1)$-connected and $(m-1)$-connected CW complexes $X$ and $Y$ respectively, the map from the homotopy fiber of the inclusion $X \\vee Y \\to X \\times Y$ to $\\Omega(X \\wedge Y)$ is $(n+m-2)$-connected.\n\n*   $S^4$ is 3-connected ($n=4$).\n*   $S^6$ is 5-connected ($m=6$).\nThe fiber of the inclusion $S^4 \\vee S^6 \\to S^4 \\times S^6$ is $\\Omega S^4 * \\Omega S^6 \\simeq \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\nThe map in question is precisely this map from the fiber to $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\nThe connectivity of this map is given by $n+m-2 = 4+6-2=8$.\n\nTherefore, the map is 8-connected. This means that it induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k$ for $k < 8$ and a surjection on $\\pi_8$.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1. Identify the spaces and the map. The map is the canonical one from the homotopy fiber of $X \\vee Y \\to X \\times Y$ to $\\Omega(X \\wedge Y)$ for $X=S^4$ and $Y=S^6$.\n2. The homotopy fiber is identified as $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n3. The connectivity of the map is given by a known formula $n+m-2$ where $X$ is $(n-1)$-connected and $Y$ is $(m-1)$-connected.\n4. $S^4$ is 3-connected, so $n=4$.\n5. $S^6$ is 5-connected, so $m=6$.\n6. The connectivity is $4+6-2 = 8$.\n\nThe result appears consistent with the literature.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nThe question asks for the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\nLet $X=S^4$ and $Y=S^6$. The space $S^4$ is 3-connected, and $S^6$ is 5-connected.\n\nThe map in question is the standard map from the homotopy fiber of the inclusion $i: X \\vee Y \\to X \\times Y$ to the loop space of the cofiber of this inclusion. The cofiber of the inclusion $X \\vee Y \\to X \\times Y$ is the smash product $X \\wedge Y$. The homotopy fiber of this inclusion is known to be homotopy equivalent to the join of the loop spaces, $\\Omega X * \\Omega Y$, which is in turn homotopy equivalent to the suspension of the smash product of the loop spaces, $\\Sigma(\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y)$.\n\nAccording to a theorem of G.W. Whitehead, if $X$ is $(n-1)$-connected and $Y$ is $(m-1)$-connected, then the map from the homotopy fiber of the inclusion $X \\vee Y \\to X \\times Y$ to $\\Omega(X \\wedge Y)$ is $(n+m-2)$-connected.\n\nIn our case, $X = S^4$ is 3-connected, so $n=4$. The space $Y = S^6$ is 5-connected, so $m=6$.\n\nTherefore, the connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is $n+m-2 = 4+6-2 = 8$.\n\nThis means that the map induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k$ for $k < 8$ and an epimorphism on $\\pi_8$.\n\n<<<8>>>The connectivity of the map is determined by considering the spaces involved and a classical result from homotopy theory.\n\nFirst, let's identify the connectivity of the building blocks of our spaces. The sphere $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected.\n*   $S^4$ is 3-connected.\n*   $S^6$ is 5-connected.\n\nThe loop space functor, $\\Omega$, reduces the connectivity of a space by one.\n*   The connectivity of $\\Omega S^4$ is $3-1 = 2$.\n*   The connectivity of $\\Omega S^6$ is $5-1 = 4$.\n\nThe map in question, $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, is a specific instance of a more general map arising from the homotopy theory of wedges and products of spaces. Consider two pointed CW-complexes, $X$ and $Y$. There is an inclusion map from their wedge sum to their product: $i: X \\vee Y \\to X \\times Y$.\n\nThe homotopy fiber of this inclusion map is homotopy equivalent to the suspension of the smash product of the loop spaces of $X$ and $Y$: $\\text{hofiber}(i) \\simeq \\Sigma(\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y)$.\n\nThe homotopy cofiber of this same inclusion map is the smash product $X \\wedge Y$. The map in the question is the canonical map from the homotopy fiber of the inclusion to the loop space of the homotopy cofiber.\n\nA theorem by G. W. Whitehead states that if $X$ is $(n-1)$-connected and $Y$ is $(m-1)$-connected, then this canonical map is $(n+m-2)$-connected. A map is defined as k-connected if it induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ for $i < k$ and a surjection for $\\pi_k$.\n\nIn our specific case, let $X = S^4$ and $Y = S^6$.\n*   For $S^4$, which is 3-connected, we have $n-1=3$, so $n=4$.\n*   For $S^6$, which is 5-connected, we have $m-1=5$, so $m=6$.\n\nApplying Whitehead's theorem, the connectivity of the map is $n+m-2 = 4+6-2 = 8$.\n\nThus, the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k$ for $k < 8$ and a surjection on $\\pi_8$.\n\n<<<8>>>"
