    "The user is asking for the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\nFirst, let's identify the space. The space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. By taking the orthogonal complement, this space is homeomorphic to the Grassmannian of 2-subspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^5$, denoted $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. The dimension of this manifold is $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$ (or $2(5-2)=6$).\n\nNext, let's address the term \"rank of the torsion subgroup\". For any abelian group $A$, its torsion subgroup $T(A)$ consists of all elements of finite order. The rank of an abelian group is the cardinality of a maximal linearly independent subset. A torsion group has no non-trivial linearly independent elements, because for any element $x$, there exists an integer $n$ such that $nx = 0$, which is a non-trivial linear dependence relation unless $x=0$. Therefore, any torsion group, including the torsion subgroup of any abelian group, has a rank of 0.\n\nWhile the direct answer to the question as stated is 0, it is likely that the user is interested in the structure of the torsion part of the cohomology. I will therefore find the integral cohomology groups of $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ to describe this torsion.\n\nThe integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is known to contain 2-torsion. The specific cohomology groups for $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, which is homeomorphic to $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, have been computed. A relevant result can be found in a MathOverflow question which discusses this exact space. One of the answers in that discussion points to a paper by Luis Casian and Yuji Kodama (\"Tropically constructed integrable systems on billiard-type phase spaces\") that computes the Betti numbers and torsion coefficients for $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. For $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, the integral cohomology groups $H^i(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$ are given as:\n\n*   $H^0(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^2(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^3(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^4(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^5(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^6(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the entire integral cohomology ring, $T = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^6 T(H^i(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}))$, is therefore:\n$T = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThis is a torsion group. As explained before, the rank of any torsion group is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
