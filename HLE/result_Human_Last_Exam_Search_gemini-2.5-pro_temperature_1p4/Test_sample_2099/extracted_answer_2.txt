The provided prompt is a fictional puzzle and cannot be solved with factual information. The historical context of "new rules for saber duels in 1880" does not appear to correspond to any known historical regulations involving the specified chemical treatments. Furthermore, the chemical names (Y1...Y10) and the scientific terms "Mass-Weighted Barysz Graph Energy" and "Mass-Weighted Moran's I" appear to be fabricated for the purpose of this riddle and do not correspond to established scientific concepts or nomenclature. Therefore, it is impossible to provide an accurate, factual answer to this question.
