    "A finite group that contains a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 must be one of the following groups: the cyclic groups C₅, C₆, C₇, C₈, C₉, C₁₀, or C₁₂, the dihedral group of order 6 (D₆), the quaternion group of order 12 (Q₁₂), or the group C₂ × C₂. In total, there are 10 such finite groups.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called \"product-free\" if for any two elements *a* and *b* in *S* (including the case where *a* and *b* are the same), their product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is \"maximal by inclusion\" (or \"locally maximal\") if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set within the same group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 2 was established by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart. Their findings show that if a finite group *G* has a maximal by inclusion product-free set *S* of size 2, then *G* must belong to a specific, finite list of groups.\n\nThe possible groups are categorized as follows:\n\n*   **Cyclic Groups:**\n    *   C₅: The cyclic group of order 5.\n    *   C₆: The cyclic group of order 6.\n    *   C₇: The cyclic group of order 7.\n    *   C₈: The cyclic group of order 8.\n    *   C₉: The cyclic group of order 9.\n    *   C₁₀: The cyclic group of order 10.\n    *   C₁₂: The cyclic group of order 12.\n\n*   **Non-Abelian Groups:**\n    *   D₆: The dihedral group of order 6 (isomorphic to S₃, the symmetric group on three elements).\n    *   Q₁₂: The quaternion group of order 12.\n\n*   **Other Abelian Groups:**\n    *   C₂ × C₂: The Klein four-group.\n\nIn the original research by Giudici and Hart, the classification is detailed in a series of tables that exhaust all possibilities for a group G generated by the product-free set S, as well as cases where S is a normal subgroup. The term \"sum-free\" is often used in the context of abelian groups, but it is equivalent to \"product-free\" in the general group setting. The research systematically rules out all other finite groups, leading to this definitive list of 10 groups.\n\n<<<10>>>"
