    "On Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between green (the combination of yellow and blue) and blue itself is **G**.\n\nIn his work *Opticks* from 1704, Newton created a circular diagram that made an analogy between the seven colors of the visible spectrum and the seven notes of a musical scale. He arranged the colors—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—sequentially around the circle.\n\nTo make the correlation with music, Newton used a Dorian musical mode that starts on the note D. In this system, each color was assigned a sector on the circle, and the divisions between the colors were marked by musical notes. The color green corresponds to the space between the notes F and G, while blue (\"blew\") is located in the space between G and A. Therefore, the note that marks the boundary between green and blue is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
