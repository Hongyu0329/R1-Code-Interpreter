    "A Pauli channel, denoted as Λ, acting on a d-dimensional quantum system (a qudit) is described by the transformation:\n\nΛ(ρ) = Σᵢ pᵢ Uᵢ ρ Uᵢ†\n\nwhere ρ is the d x d density matrix of the qudit, {Uᵢ} is the set of d² generalized Pauli operators (including the identity), and {pᵢ} is a set of probabilities with Σᵢ pᵢ = 1.\n\nThe complementary channel, Λᶜ, describes the information that leaks to the environment during the evolution governed by Λ. It is defined through the Stinespring dilation of the original channel.\n\nThe rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix, which is equivalent to the minimum number of Kraus operators required to represent the channel. A key result in quantum information theory states that the rank of a channel Φ, with Kraus operators {Kᵢ}, is equal to the dimension of the linear space spanned by the operators of the form Kₐ†Kᵦ.\n\nTo find the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Kraus Operators of the Pauli Channel**: For a Pauli channel Λ, the Kraus operators can be chosen as Kᵢ = √pᵢ Uᵢ, where i ranges from 0 to d²-1.\n2.  **Kraus Operators of the Complementary Channel**: Given the Kraus operators {Kᵢ} for a channel Λ, the action of the complementary channel Λᶜ on a density matrix ρ can be expressed as an operator whose matrix elements are given by [Λᶜ(ρ)]ₐᵦ = Tr(Kₐ ρ Kᵦ†).\n3.  **Rank of the Complementary Channel**: The rank of the complementary channel, rank(Λᶜ), is determined by the dimension of the operator space spanned by {Kᵢ†Kⱼ} for all i and j.\n4.  **Spanning the Operator Space**: Let's analyze the set of operators {Kᵢ†Kⱼ}:\n    Kᵢ†Kⱼ = (√pᵢ Uᵢ)†(√pⱼ Uⱼ) = √(pᵢpⱼ) Uᵢ†Uⱼ\n5.  **Properties of Generalized Pauli Operators**: The set of d² generalized Pauli operators {Uₖ} forms a complete, orthogonal basis for the entire space of d x d matrices, denoted M(d, ℂ). The product of any two Pauli operators, Uᵢ†Uⱼ, is proportional to another Pauli operator, Uₖ. Consequently, the set of all such products, {Uᵢ†Uⱼ}, also spans the full operator space M(d, ℂ).\n6.  **Calculating the Dimension**: The dimension of the space of all d x d matrices, M(d, ℂ), is d². Therefore, the dimension of the linear span of {Kᵢ†Kⱼ} is d², assuming the probabilities pᵢ are all non-zero (which corresponds to the most general case of a Pauli channel).\n7.  **Conclusion**: The rank of the complementary channel Λᶜ is the dimension of this spanned space, which is d². Since the rank of any channel acting on a d-dimensional system cannot exceed d², this represents the maximal possible rank.\n\nThus, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel Λ acting on a qudit density matrix is d².\n\n<<<d²>>>"
