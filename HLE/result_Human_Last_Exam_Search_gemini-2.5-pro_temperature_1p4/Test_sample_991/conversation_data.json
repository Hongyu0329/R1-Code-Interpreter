    "This is a classic Chinese character riddle. The components described point to the structure of a specific character:\n\n*   **A wooden stick:** This represents the top horizontal stroke '一'.\n*   **Hanging a square box:** This refers to the box-like radical '口' (kǒu) below the first stroke.\n*   **A ladder placed in the center:** This is a descriptive interpretation of the strokes inside the '口', which visually resemble a small ladder.\n\nPutting these pieces together forms the character.\n\n<<<面>>>"
