    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence of such a fixed point is guaranteed under specific conditions, primarily in the context of partially ordered metric spaces. These conditions are a generalization of the well-known Banach Contraction Principle to a multidimensional setting for three mappings. The core requirements involve the properties of the spaces X, Y, and Z, the behavior of the functions F, G, and H with respect to the ordering (mixed monotone property), and a contractive condition on the functions.\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are laid out in theorems found in the field of nonlinear analysis and fixed point theory. A key result in this area has been established by Deepa Karichery and Shaini Pulickakunnel. The conditions can be summarized as follows:\n\n### 1. The Metric Space and Partial Order\n\nThe spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) must be complete metric spaces, each equipped with a partial order (≤). This means that every Cauchy sequence in each space must converge to a point within that space.\n\n### 2. Generalized Mixed Monotone Property\n\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a generalized mixed monotone property. This property relates the ordering of the inputs to the ordering of the outputs of the functions. Specifically, for any x, x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z, z₁, z₂ ∈ Z:\n\n*   **For F:**\n    *   F is non-decreasing in its first argument: x₁ ≤ x₂ implies F(x₁, y, z) ≤ F(x₂, y, z).\n    *   F is non-increasing in its second argument: y₁ ≤ y₂ implies F(x, y₁, z) ≥ F(x, y₂, z).\n    *   F is non-decreasing in its third argument: z₁ ≤ z₂ implies F(x, y, z₁) ≤ F(x, y, z₂).\n\n*   **For G:**\n    *   G is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments: y₁ ≤ y₂ implies G(y₁, x, y) ≤ G(y₂, x, y) and y₁ ≤ y₂ implies G(y, x, y₁) ≤ G(y, x, y₂).\n    *   G is non-increasing in its second argument: x₁ ≤ x₂ implies G(y, x₁, y) ≥ G(y, x₂, y).\n\n*   **For H:**\n    *   H is non-decreasing in its first and second arguments: z₁ ≤ z₂ implies H(z₁, y, x) ≤ H(z₂, y, x) and y₁ ≤ y₂ implies H(z, y₁, x) ≤ H(z, y₂, x).\n    *   H is non-increasing in its third argument: x₁ ≤ x₂ implies H(z, y, x₁) ≥ H(z, y, x₂).\n\n### 3. Contractive Condition\n\nThe mappings F, G, and H must jointly satisfy a contractive condition. This is a mathematical inequality that ensures that applying the functions brings points closer together. There exist various forms of this condition, but a common one involves a linear contraction:\n\nThere exist constants k, l, m ∈ [0, 1) with k + l + m < 1 such that for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z for which x ≥ u, y ≤ v, and z ≥ w, the following inequality holds:\n\nd_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k * d_X(x, u) + l * d_Y(y, v) + m * d_Z(z, w)\n\nThis condition ensures that the \"total distance\" between the images of two points under F, G, and H is a fraction of the total distance between the original points, which is the essence of a contraction mapping.\n\n### 4. Existence of an Initial Point\n\nThere must exist a starting point (x₀, y₀, z₀) ∈ X × Y × Z that satisfies the following initial ordering conditions:\n*   x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n*   y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n*   z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\nThis condition provides a starting point for an iterative process that will converge to the fixed point.\n\n### 5. Continuity or an Alternative Condition\n\nEither the functions F, G, and H are continuous, or the spaces (X, ≤), (Y, ≤), and (Z, ≤) must have a specific property. This property states that for any non-decreasing sequence {x_n} that converges to x, we have x_n ≤ x for all n, and for any non-increasing sequence {y_n} that converges to y, we have y_n ≥ y for all n. This alternative condition ensures that the limit of a sequence constructed from the functions will indeed be a fixed point, even if the functions themselves are not continuous.\n\nWhen all these conditions are met, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed. Furthermore, under a stronger condition that every pair of elements in X, Y, and Z has an upper and a lower bound, the fixed point is often unique.\n\n<<<The conditions for the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y and H:Z*Y*X→Z to have a FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n1.  **Complete Partially Ordered Metric Spaces:** The sets X, Y, and Z must be complete metric spaces with a defined partial order.\n2.  **Generalized Mixed Monotone Property:** The functions F, G, and H must be monotone in a mixed sense with respect to their arguments. For example, F is typically non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second.\n3.  **Contractive Condition:** The functions must collectively satisfy a contractive inequality. This means that the distances between the outputs of the functions are smaller than the distances between the inputs by a certain factor.\n4.  **Existence of a Starting Point:** There must exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) that satisfies a specific set of inequalities related to the functions and the partial order.\n5.  **Continuity or an Order-Preserving Property:** The functions F, G, and H must either be continuous, or the spaces must satisfy a property that ensures sequences constructed through the iterative application of the functions converge to a fixed point.>>>An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence of such a fixed point is guaranteed under specific conditions, primarily in the context of partially ordered metric spaces.
