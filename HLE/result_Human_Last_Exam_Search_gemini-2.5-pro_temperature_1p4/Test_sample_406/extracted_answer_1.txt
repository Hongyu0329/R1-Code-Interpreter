The conditions for the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y and H:Z*Y*X→Z to have a FGH-tripled fixed point are:
1.  **Complete Partially Ordered Metric Spaces:** The sets X, Y, and Z must be complete metric spaces with a defined partial order.
2.  **Generalized Mixed Monotone Property:** The functions F, G, and H must be monotone in a mixed sense with respect to their arguments. For example, F is typically non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second.
3.  **Contractive Condition:** The functions must collectively satisfy a contractive inequality. This means that the distances between the outputs of the functions are smaller than the distances between the inputs by a certain factor.
4.  **Existence of a Starting Point:** There must exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) that satisfies a specific set of inequalities related to the functions and the partial order.
5.  **Continuity or an Order-Preserving Property:** The functions F, G, and H must either be continuous, or the spaces must satisfy a property that ensures sequences constructed through the iterative application of the functions converge to a fixed point.
