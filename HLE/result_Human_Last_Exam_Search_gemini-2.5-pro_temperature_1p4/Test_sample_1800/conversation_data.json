    "### Optimal Nickel-to-Cerium Ratios Vary for Water Gas Shift and Water Splitting Reactions\n\nThe ideal ratio of nickel to cerium in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for maximizing catalytic performance is not a single value but rather depends on the specific application, whether it be the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction or water splitting. Research indicates that different optimal ratios exist for each of these processes, influenced by factors such as the presence of dopants and specific reaction conditions.\n\nFor the **Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction**, studies have shown a range of effective nickel concentrations. One study on lanthanum-doped Ni/Ceria catalysts identified an optimal nickel proportion of around 7% molar for the reverse WGS reaction. Another investigation into Ni/CeO2 catalysts for the WGS reaction found no significant difference in catalytic activity for nickel content ranging from 5 to 12.5 wt%. Furthermore, a 15 wt% NiO/CeO2 catalyst has been noted for its high activity and stability in CO oxidation, a reaction related to the WGS process. In a comparative study, a 40% Ni-Ceria catalyst was shown to be active for the WGS reaction.\n\nIn the context of **water splitting**, the optimal Ni/Ce ratio is also multifaceted. A computational study has suggested that Ni-Ceria nanoparticles with a 3Ni/1Ce ratio exhibit favorable electronic properties for the water-splitting reaction. Conversely, an experimental study on Ni₃N-CeO₂ nanoparticle catalysts for electrolytic water splitting found that a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2, which corresponds to a Ni/Ce ratio of 0.5, demonstrated the best performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a crucial part of water splitting, Ni-Ceria catalysts with Ni to Ce atomic ratios of 75:25 and 50:50 (or Ni/Ce ratios of 3 and 1, respectively) have been shown to have a high concentration of oxygen vacancies, which is beneficial for catalytic activity.\n\nIn summary, there is no universally ideal Ni/Ce ratio for both the WGS reaction and water splitting. For the WGS reaction, nickel content in the range of 5-12.5 wt% appears effective, with some studies pointing to an optimum around 7% molar in doped systems. For water splitting, optimal ratios can vary significantly, with a 3:1 Ni/Ce ratio being computationally favored, a 1:2 Ni/Ce ratio (or Ce/Ni of 2) showing experimental promise for HER, and ratios of 3:1 and 1:1 being effective for OER.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is dependent on the specific catalytic reaction; for the Water Gas Shift reaction, a range of 5-12.5 wt% Ni is effective, while for water splitting, optimal ratios have been reported as 3:1 and 1:2 (Ni:Ce).>>>"
