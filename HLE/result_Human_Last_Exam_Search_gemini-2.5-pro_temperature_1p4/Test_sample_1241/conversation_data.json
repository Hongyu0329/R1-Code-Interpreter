    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to determine the stationary probabilities of the system. The stationary distribution is reached as time $t$ approaches infinity, at which point the probabilities no longer change, i.e., $P_{i}'(t) = 0$ for all states $i$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given system of equations. The sum of the probabilities is given as constant:\n$P_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1$\nThe derivative of this sum must be zero. Let's sum the given differential equations:\n$P_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)$\n$P_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n$P_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t)$\n$P_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n\nSumming these gives:\n$\\sum_{i=0}^{3} P_{i}'(t) = P_{0}(-\\lambda_{01} - \\lambda_{01}) + P_{1}(\\lambda_{10} - \\lambda_{10} - \\lambda_{12} + \\lambda_{12}) + P_{2}(\\lambda_{21} - \\lambda_{21} - \\lambda_{23} + \\lambda_{23}) + P_{3}(\\lambda_{31} - \\lambda_{31})$\n$\\sum_{i=0}^{3} P_{i}'(t) = -2\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$\n\nSince the sum of probabilities is constant (equal to 1), its derivative must be zero. This leads to $-2\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) = 0$. Given that $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019 \\neq 0$, it must be that $P_{0}(t) = 0$ for all $t$.\nThis, however, leads to inconsistencies with the rest of the system if we assume a non-trivial stationary distribution exists. This strongly suggests a typographical error in the second equation. In a standard Chapman-Kolmogorov system, the term representing flow from state 0 to state 1 in the equation for $P_1'$ should be positive, i.e., $+\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$.\n\nAssuming this correction, the second equation is:\n$P_{1}'(t) = \\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\nWith this correction, the sum of the derivatives is zero, which is consistent with the conservation of total probability.\n\nWe now solve for the stationary probabilities, denoted by $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$, by setting all time derivatives to zero:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 P_{0} + 0.65 P_{1}$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 P_{0} - (0.65 + 0.4) P_{1} + 0.392 P_{2} + 0.008 P_{3}$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 P_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008) P_{2}$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 P_{2} - 0.008 P_{3}$\n5.  $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 P_{2} = 0.008 P_{3} \\implies P_{2} = P_{3}$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 P_{1} = (0.392 + 0.008) P_{2} \\implies 0.4 P_{1} = 0.4 P_{2} \\implies P_{1} = P_{2}$\nTherefore, we have $P_{1} = P_{2} = P_{3}$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 P_{0} = 0.65 P_{1} \\implies P_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_{1}$\n\nNow, we substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n$\\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_{1} + P_{1} + P_{1} + P_{1} = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3) P_{1} = 1$\n$P_{1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}} = \\frac{0.019}{0.65 + 0.057} = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\nWe need to calculate $P_{0} + P_{1}$. First, we find $P_{0}$ in terms of $P_{1}$:\n$P_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_{1} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\nNow, we can compute the sum:\n$P_{0} + P_{1} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$\\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768$\n\nThe required value is approximately 0.946.\n\n<<<0.669/0.707>>>"
