    "In the mathematical study of automorphic forms, the upper bound for the maximum norm of a Hecke-Maass cusp form in relation to the covolume of the underlying space is a central topic known as the sup-norm problem. For the specific case of a squarefree natural number $N$, which defines the level of the arithmetic group $\\Gamma_0(N)$, the following bounds have been established.\n\nThe notation $(k_{k,\\infty})$ is interpreted as the sup-norm (or $L^\\infty$-norm) $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty$ of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass cusp form $\\phi$. The covolume $(V)$ refers to the volume of the hyperbolic surface $\\Gamma_0(N) \\backslash \\mathbb{H}$, which is asymptotically proportional to the level $N$. The relationship between the sup-norm, the covolume, and the form's Laplace eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is crucial.\n\nFor an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $\\phi$ of squarefree level $N$ and a fixed Laplace eigenvalue $\\lambda$, the upper bound on its sup-norm shows a decreasing dependence on the level $N$. A significant result in this area, established by Gergely Harcos and Nicolas Templier, gives the following inequality:\n$$ \\|\\phi\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda,\\varepsilon} N^{-1/6+\\varepsilon} $$\nfor any $\\varepsilon > 0$. The implied constant depends on the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and on $\\varepsilon$.\n\nSince the covolume $V$ of the space $\\Gamma_0(N) \\backslash \\mathbb{H}$ is directly related to $N$ (specifically, $V = \\frac{\\pi}{3} N \\prod_{p|N}(1+p^{-1})$), this bound can be expressed in terms of the covolume $V$. As $V$ is of the order of $N$, the relation can be written as:\n$$ \\|\\phi\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda,\\varepsilon} V^{-1/6+\\varepsilon} $$\n\nThis inequality demonstrates that as the space grows larger (i.e., as $V$ or $N$ increases), the form becomes more spread out, and its maximum value decreases. This goes beyond the \"local\" or \"trivial\" bound and is a key result in the theory of quantum chaos and the analytic theory of L-functions. It is important to note that this specific bound holds for a fixed eigenvalue $\\lambda$. More complex \"hybrid\" bounds exist that describe the relationship when both the eigenvalue and the level vary.\n\n<<< $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda,\\varepsilon} V^{-1/6+\\varepsilon}$ >>>"
