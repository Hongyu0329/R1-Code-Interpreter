    "I am unable to provide a numerical answer to the question of the number of involutions in PSU(4,997) with the available tools. This is a highly specialized question in the field of finite group theory, and the precise number is not readily available through general web searches. Answering it would require access to specific academic literature, specialized mathematical databases, or computational algebra systems like GAP or Magma, which are beyond the scope of my current capabilities.\n\nHere is a summary of the information that could be found:\n\n*   The group in question is **PSU(4, 997)**, the projective special unitary group of degree 4 over the finite field with 997 elements. In the context of unitary groups, this implies the underlying vector space is over the field with 997² elements.\n\n*   An **involution** is an element of a group which is its own inverse, i.e., an element of order 2.\n\n*   For a group of the type PSU(4, q) where q is an odd prime power and `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)`, which is the case for q = 997, there are **two distinct conjugacy classes of involutions**.\n\nTo find the total number of involutions, one would need to calculate the size of each of these two conjugacy classes and add them together. The size of a conjugacy class of an element *x* is given by the formula |G| / |C<sub>G</sub>(x)|, where |G| is the order of the group and |C<sub>G</sub>(x)| is the order of the centralizer of *x*.\n\nThe order of the group `PSU(4, 997)` can be calculated as:\n`|PSU(4,997)| = (997^6 * (997^2-1) * (997^3+1) * (997^4-1)) / gcd(4, 997+1)`\nSince `gcd(4, 998) = 2`, the order is `(997^6 * (997^2-1) * (997^3+1) * (997^4-1)) / 2`.\n\nHowever, the search results did not yield explicit and verifiable formulas for the orders of the centralizers of the involutions in these two classes for PSU(4,q). Without these centralizer orders, the final numerical answer cannot be computed. The available literature, such as the work by Phua Kok Khoo from 1971, provides a structural description that is difficult to interpret definitively without deeper context and could contain notational conventions that differ from modern usage.\n\nTherefore, a precise count of the involutions in PSU(4,997) cannot be provided."
