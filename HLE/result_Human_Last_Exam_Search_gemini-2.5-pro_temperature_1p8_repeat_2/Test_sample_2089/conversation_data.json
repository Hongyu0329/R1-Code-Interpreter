    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character's fate is sealed by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is the 1936 Japanese film *Mr. Thank You* (*Arigatō-san*).\n\nDirected by Hiroshi Shimizu, the film follows a kind-hearted bus driver in rural Japan who is known for his constant politeness and his habit of saying \"Arigato\" (Thank you) to everyone. This defining characteristic ultimately shapes his destiny and the lives of his passengers, which include a young girl being sold into prostitution. The film, shot on location, provides a glimpse into Depression-era Japan.\n\nWhile not a direct Oscar nominee in the traditional sense, as the Best Foreign Language Film category was not formally introduced until 1956, the film is a critically acclaimed classic. Its title character's signature phrase is central to the film's narrative and his fateful decisions.\n\n<<<Mr. Thank You (Arigatō-san)>>>"
