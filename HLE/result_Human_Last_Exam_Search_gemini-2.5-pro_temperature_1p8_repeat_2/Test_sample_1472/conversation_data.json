    "The symmetry point group of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper is dependent on the oxidation state of the copper atom. The molecule can exist with copper in a +1 or +2 oxidation state, which results in different molecular geometries and therefore different point groups.\n\n### Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)\n\nWhen copper is in the +1 oxidation state, the complex, [Cu(2,5-dithiahexane)₂]⁺, adopts a tetrahedral coordination geometry. The symmetry of this complex has been identified as belonging to the **S₄ point group**. The S₄ symmetry element is a four-fold improper rotation axis.\n\n### Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)\n\nIn the +2 oxidation state, the complex, [Cu(2,5-dithiahexane)₂]²⁺, exhibits a distorted octahedral geometry. The central copper ion is coordinated to the four sulfur atoms of the two bis(2,5-dithiahexane) ligands in an equatorial plane, with two other ligands, such as fluoride ions from tetrafluoroborate counter-ions, in the axial positions.\n\nWhile an idealized tetragonally-distorted octahedron might possess D₄h symmetry, the actual structure of the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) complex is of lower symmetry due to the puckering of the five-membered chelate rings (Cu-S-C-C-S). For some salts, such as the perchlorate, the copper atom is located at a center of inversion. This indicates that the molecule itself is centrosymmetric, and its point group is likely **Cᵢ**. A Cᵢ point group has only an identity element and a center of inversion.\n\nIn summary, the point group of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) is S₄, and for bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II), it is typically a lower symmetry centrosymmetric point group such as Cᵢ.\n\n<<<S₄ for the copper(I) complex and Cᵢ for the copper(II) complex>>>"
