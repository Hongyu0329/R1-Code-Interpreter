    "The minimal number of triangles required for the triangulation of the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20.\n\nThe outer-hull of a polyhedron is more formally known as its convex hull. The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid composed of 20 equilateral triangular faces.\n\nTherefore, the triangulation of the outer-hull of the great icosahedron, which is the set of triangles visible from the outside, corresponds to the faces of the regular icosahedron. This results in a total of 20 triangles.\n\n<<<20>>>"
