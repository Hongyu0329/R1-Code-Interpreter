    "To determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, we first need to define the relevant concepts.\n\n### 1. Pauli Channel\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is a quantum channel whose action on a density matrix $\\rho \\in M_d(\\mathbb{C})$ is given by:\n$\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger$\nHere, $\\{p_k\\}$ is a probability distribution ($p_k \\ge 0$, $\\sum_k p_k = 1$), and $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ is a basis of unitary operators for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, known as the generalized Pauli operators. They are orthogonal with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product: $\\mathrm{Tr}(U_i^\\dagger U_j) = d \\cdot \\delta_{ij}$.\n\nThe Kraus operators of this channel are $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$. A minimal set of Kraus operators only includes those for which $p_k > 0$.\n\n### 2. Complementary Channel\nGiven a quantum channel $\\Lambda$ with Kraus operators $\\{A_k\\}$, its complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is defined through the Stinespring dilation theorem. The output of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ for an input state $\\rho$ is given by a matrix whose entries are:\n$(\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho))_{ij} = \\mathrm{Tr}(A_i \\rho A_j^\\dagger)$\n\nFor a Pauli channel, this becomes:\n$(\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho))_{ij} = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\sqrt{p_i} U_i \\rho (\\sqrt{p_j} U_j)^\\dagger) = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\mathrm{Tr}(U_i \\rho U_j^\\dagger)$\n\nThe channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is a linear map from the space of $d \\times d$ matrices ($M_d$) to the space of $m \\times m$ matrices ($M_m$), where $m$ is the number of Kraus operators. In our case, $m=d^2$.\n\n### 3. Rank of a Channel\nThe rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. This is equivalent to the dimension of the image of the channel when viewed as a linear map. For the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}: M_d \\to M_{d^2}$, its rank is given by:\n$\\mathrm{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\dim(\\mathrm{Im}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}))$.\n\nWe can use the rank-nullity theorem:\n$\\dim(\\mathrm{Im}(\\tilde{\\Lambda})) = \\dim(M_d) - \\dim(\\ker(\\tilde{\\Lambda}))$.\n\nThe domain of the map is the space of all $d \\times d$ matrices, so $\\dim(M_d) = d^2$. The kernel of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ consists of all matrices $\\rho \\in M_d$ such that $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = 0$.\n$\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = 0 \\iff (\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho))_{ij} = 0 \\text{ for all } i,j$.\nThis means $\\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\mathrm{Tr}(U_i \\rho U_j^\\dagger) = 0$ for all $i, j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d^2-1\\}$.\n\n### 4. Maximizing the Rank\nThe question asks for the *maximal* rank of the complementary channel. This means we are free to choose the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, which amounts to choosing the probability distribution $\\{p_k\\}$.\n\nTo maximize the rank, we should aim to minimize the dimension of the kernel. Let's choose a Pauli channel where all probabilities are non-zero, i.e., $p_k > 0$ for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d^2-1\\}$. A prime example is the completely depolarizing channel, where $p_k = 1/d^2$ for all $k$.\n\nWith this choice, the condition for $\\rho$ being in the kernel becomes:\n$\\mathrm{Tr}(U_i \\rho U_j^\\dagger) = 0$ for all $i,j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d^2-1\\}$.\nThis is equivalent to $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho U_j^\\dagger U_i) = 0$ for all $i,j$.\n\nNow, let's consider the set of operators $\\{U_j^\\dagger U_i\\}_{i,j=0}^{d^2-1}$.\nThe product of two generalized Pauli operators, $U_j^\\dagger U_i$, is another generalized Pauli operator, up to a phase factor. Since the set $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ forms a basis for the entire space of matrices $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$, the set of products $\\{U_j^\\dagger U_i\\}$ also spans $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$.\n\nTherefore, the condition $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho O) = 0$ holds for any operator $O \\in M_d(\\mathbb{C})$. The Hilbert-Schmidt inner product $\\langle \\rho, O \\rangle = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho^\\dagger O)$ is non-degenerate. For the condition to hold for all $O$, we must have $\\rho=0$.\n\nThis shows that for a Pauli channel with $p_k > 0$ for all $k$, the kernel is trivial: $\\ker(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\{0\\}$.\nThe dimension of the kernel is $\\dim(\\ker(\\tilde{\\Lambda})) = 0$.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nUsing the rank-nullity theorem, the rank of the complementary channel is:\n$\\mathrm{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\dim(M_d) - \\dim(\\ker(\\tilde{\\Lambda})) = d^2 - 0 = d^2$.\n\nSince the rank of a channel cannot exceed the dimension of its domain ($d^2$), this is the maximum possible rank. This maximum is achieved for any Pauli channel whose corresponding probability distribution has full support (i.e., all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero).\n\nThe maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
