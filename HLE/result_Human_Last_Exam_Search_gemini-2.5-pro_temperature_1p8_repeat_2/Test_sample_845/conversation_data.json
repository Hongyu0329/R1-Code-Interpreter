    "The value computed between heartbeats when tracking HR and HRV by capturing beat-to-beat intervals using PPG is most commonly called the **interbeat interval (IBI)**.\n\nHeart rate variability (HRV) itself is the measurement of the fluctuation in these time intervals between adjacent heartbeats. While several terms are used for this interval, including \"beat-to-beat interval (BBI)\" and \"pulse interval,\" \"interbeat interval (IBI)\" is a widely used and accepted term, particularly when the measurement is derived from a photoplethysmogram (PPG). The term \"R-R interval\" is also used, but it specifically refers to the interval between the R-waves in an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal.\n\n<<<interbeat interval (IBI)>>>"
