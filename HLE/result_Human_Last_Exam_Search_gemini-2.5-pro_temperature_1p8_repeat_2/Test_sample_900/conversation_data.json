    "I am unable to provide a precise count of the \"pas de Balanchine\" movements performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo from the 2015 Semperoper Ballett production of \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated.\" The primary reason is that the specific video of this performance is not publicly available for viewing.\n\nThe term \"pas de Balanchine\" itself is not a formally recognized step in the ballet lexicon but has gained popularity as a descriptor for a specific, energetic sequence of movements often associated with the neoclassical style of choreographer George Balanchine. This style, which heavily influenced \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" choreographer William Forsythe, is known for its speed, precision, and dynamic, off-balance motions. Forsythe's work is considered an extension of this tradition, deconstructing and evolving the classical vocabulary.\n\nWhile it is confirmed that Svetlana Gileva, a principal dancer with the Semperoper Ballett, performed this role in 2015, and the choreography is known to be demanding and aligned with this style, a quantitative analysis of a specific, informally named step sequence is impossible without visual access to the performance.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a specific number as the video of the performance is not available for analysis.>>>"
