    "### The Formula for the Fermionic Partition Function in Imaginary Time\n\nThe partition function, denoted by Z, for a system of fermions in the imaginary time representation is a cornerstone of quantum statistical mechanics and many-body theory. It is expressed using Feynman's path integral formalism, which requires the introduction of anti-commuting numbers, known as Grassmann numbers, to properly account for the anti-symmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions.\n\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function Z is given by a functional integral over all possible configurations of the fermionic fields ψ(τ, **x**) and their conjugates ψ*(τ, **x**). These fields are functions of imaginary time τ and spatial coordinates **x**. The imaginary time variable τ is compactified on a circle of circumference β = 1/(k_B T), where T is the temperature and k_B is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe general expression for the fermionic partition function is:\n\n**Z = ∫ D[ψ*] D[ψ] e<sup>-S<sub>E</sub>[ψ*, ψ]</sup>**\n\nWhere:\n\n*   **∫ D[ψ*] D[ψ]** represents the functional integral over all possible configurations of the Grassmann-valued fermion fields ψ and ψ*. The use of Grassmann variables is essential because fermionic fields must anti-commute, a property that cannot be satisfied by ordinary numbers.\n*   **S<sub>E</sub>[ψ*, ψ]** is the Euclidean action of the system, expressed in imaginary time. It is obtained from the standard (Minkowskian) action by a Wick rotation, which involves the substitution t → -iτ. The general form of the Euclidean action for a fermionic system is:\n\n    **S<sub>E</sub>[ψ*, ψ] = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x L<sub>E</sub>(ψ*, ψ, ∂<sub>τ</sub>ψ, ∇ψ)**\n\n    Here, L<sub>E</sub> is the Euclidean Lagrangian density, which depends on the fermion fields, their derivatives with respect to imaginary time (∂<sub>τ</sub>), and their spatial gradients (∇).\n\nA crucial aspect of the fermionic path integral is the imposition of **anti-periodic boundary conditions** in the imaginary time direction. This means that the fermion fields must satisfy the condition:\n\n**ψ(τ + β, x) = -ψ(τ, x)**\n**ψ*(τ + β, x) = -ψ*(τ, x)**\n\nThese anti-periodic boundary conditions are a direct consequence of the fermionic statistics and the trace operation in the definition of the partition function (Z = Tr(e<sup>-βH</sup>)). In contrast, bosonic fields satisfy periodic boundary conditions.\n\nFor a system of non-interacting Dirac fermions with mass m, the Euclidean action is given by:\n\n**S<sub>E</sub> = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x ψ*(τ, x) (γ<sup>0</sup>∂<sub>τ</sub> + γ<sup>i</sup>∂<sub>i</sub> + m) ψ(τ, x)**\n\nwhere the γ<sup>μ</sup> are the Dirac gamma matrices in the Euclidean representation.\n\nIn summary, the formula for the fermionic partition function encapsulates the principles of quantum statistical mechanics and the unique anti-commuting nature of fermions through the use of a path integral over Grassmann fields with anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time.\n\n<<<The fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is given by the integral over all anti-commuting Grassmann field configurations ψ(τ, x) and ψ*(τ, x):\n\nZ = ∫ D[ψ*] D[ψ] e<sup>-S<sub>E</sub>[ψ*, ψ]</sup>\n\nsubject to the anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time τ:\n\nψ(τ + β, x) = -ψ(τ, x)\nψ*(τ + β, x) = -ψ*(τ, x)\n\nwhere β = 1/(k<sub>B</sub>T) is the inverse temperature.\n\nThe term S<sub>E</sub>[ψ*, ψ] in the exponent is the Euclidean action of the fermionic system, which is typically of the form:\n\nS<sub>E</sub>[ψ*, ψ] = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x ψ*(τ, x) (∂<sub>τ</sub> + H) ψ(τ, x)\n\nwhere H is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator in the second-quantized representation. For instance, for non-relativistic fermions, H would be of the form (-ħ²/2m)∇² - μ, where μ is the chemical potential. For Dirac fermions, a relativistic expression involving gamma matrices is used. The integration measures D[ψ*] and D[ψ] symbolize the integration over the algebra of Grassmann numbers.>>>"
