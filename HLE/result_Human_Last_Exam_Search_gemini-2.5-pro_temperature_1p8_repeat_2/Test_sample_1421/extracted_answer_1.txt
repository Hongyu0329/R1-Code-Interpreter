The fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is given by the integral over all anti-commuting Grassmann field configurations ψ(τ, x) and ψ*(τ, x):

Z = ∫ D[ψ*] D[ψ] e<sup>-S<sub>E</sub>[ψ*, ψ]</sup>

subject to the anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time τ:

ψ(τ + β, x) = -ψ(τ, x)
ψ*(τ + β, x) = -ψ*(τ, x)

where β = 1/(k<sub>B</sub>T) is the inverse temperature.

The term S<sub>E</sub>[ψ*, ψ] in the exponent is the Euclidean action of the fermionic system, which is typically of the form:

S<sub>E</sub>[ψ*, ψ] = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x ψ*(τ, x) (∂<sub>τ</sub> + H) ψ(τ, x)

where H is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator in the second-quantized representation. For instance, for non-relativistic fermions, H would be of the form (-ħ²/2m)∇² - μ, where μ is the chemical potential. For Dirac fermions, a relativistic expression involving gamma matrices is used. The integration measures D[ψ*] and D[ψ] symbolize the integration over the algebra of Grassmann numbers.
