The value of the critical exponent ν is not a single constant but depends on the spatial dimension 'd' and the symmetry of the order parameter. For d > 4, ν = 1/2 (mean-field value). For d < 4, ν is given by Renormalization Group calculations, e.g., for the 3D Ising model ν ≈ 0.630, and for the 2D Ising model ν = 1. At the upper critical dimension d=4, mean-field behavior is modified by logarithmic corrections.
