The "value" of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral that maintains the Pauli exclusion principle is not a single numerical constant but is defined by the rules of Berezin integration, specifically ∫dθ = 0 and ∫dθ θ = 1, which lead to the property that the integral of a Gaussian function of Grassmann variables is proportional to the determinant of the matrix in the exponent.
