    "To compute the determinant of the given matrix A:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nWe can use the formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\ndet(A) = 2 * (2 * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) - (-1) * ((-1) * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) + (-1) * ((-1) * (-1) - 2 * (-1))\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * 3 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6\ndet(A) = 0\n\nAlternatively, one can observe that the sum of the elements in each row is zero:\n2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\n-1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\n-1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\n\nWhen the sum of the rows of a matrix is zero, the vector is an eigenvector of the matrix with an eigenvalue of 0. If a matrix has an eigenvalue of 0, its determinant is 0. The additional information about the Markov quiver and \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) is not necessary for the calculation of the determinant of the explicitly provided matrix. Research into \"Markov quiver\" indicates it relates to a specific type of quiver (a directed graph used in representation theory), and its adjacency matrix might have particular properties. However, since the matrix A is explicitly given, the problem is reduced to a direct computation.\n\n<<<0>>>"
