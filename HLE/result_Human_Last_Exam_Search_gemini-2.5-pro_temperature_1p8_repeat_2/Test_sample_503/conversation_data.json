    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-category, corresponds to a standard adjunction between posets. An adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ consists of a pair of order-preserving maps, the left adjoint $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and the right adjoint $R: [n] \\to [m]$, satisfying the condition $L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$ for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$. This is also known as a Galois connection.\n\nSuch an adjunction is uniquely determined by either the left adjoint map $L$ or the right adjoint map $R$. For a given order-preserving map to be a left or right adjoint, it must satisfy a specific condition:\n\n1.  An order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all joins (colimits). In the context of the poset $[m]$, this means it must preserve the bottom element, which is the join of the empty set. Therefore, $L$ must map the least element of $[m]$ to the least element of $[n]$, which means $L(0) = 0$.\n\n2.  Dually, an order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all meets (limits). This implies that $R$ must preserve the top element, which is the meet of the empty set. Thus, $R$ must map the greatest element of $[n]$ to the greatest element of $[m]$, which means $R(n) = m$.\n\nThe problem is to find the number of internal adjunctions from $$ to $$. Here, $m=23$ and $n=37$. We can count the number of such adjunctions by counting the number of possible left adjoint maps $L: \\to$.\n\nA map $L: \\to$ is an order-preserving map satisfying $L(0) = 0$. An order-preserving map is determined by the sequence of its values $(L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23))$, which must be non-decreasing:\n$L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23)$.\n\nThe condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first value. The values $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ must satisfy:\n$0 \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem of choosing 23 numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ (which has $37+1 = 38$ elements) with replacement, where the order of selection does not matter (as they will be arranged uniquely into a non-decreasing sequence). This is a multiset selection problem.\n\nThe number of ways to choose a multiset of size $k$ from a set of size $N$ is given by the formula $\\binom{N+k-1}{k}$.\nIn this case, $k=23$ (the number of values to choose, for $L(1)$ through $L(23)$) and $N=38$ (the number of possible values, from 0 to 37).\n\nThe number of such maps is:\n$\\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nAlternatively, we could count the number of right adjoints $R: \\to$. These are order-preserving maps satisfying $R(37) = 23$. Such a map is determined by the sequence $0 \\le R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le R(37) = 23$. We need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $(R(0), \\dots, R(36))$ with values in $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$. Here, we are choosing $k=37$ values from a set of size $N=24$. The number is $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nSince $\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{60-23} = \\binom{60}{37}$, both methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<83818804153026334710>>>"
