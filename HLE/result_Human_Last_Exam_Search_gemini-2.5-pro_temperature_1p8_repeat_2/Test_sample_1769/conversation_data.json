    "If the Norse had never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely be **\"suster\"** or possibly **\"soster\"**. This conclusion is based on the regular linguistic evolution of Old English words that were not influenced by Old Norse.\n\nThe original Old English word for a female sibling was **sweostor**, with regional and later variations including **swuster**. The current Modern English word, \"sister,\" did not evolve from this native Old English term alone. Instead, its form was heavily influenced by the Old Norse equivalent, **systir**. This Norse influence is also seen in the replacement of the native third-person plural pronouns *hÄ«e*, *hira*, and *him* with the Old Norse-derived \"they,\" \"their,\" and \"them\".\n\nTo understand what \"sweostor\" or \"swuster\" would have become without this external linguistic pressure, we can trace the expected sound changes from Old English to Modern English.\n\nThere were two primary forms of the word in Old English that would have vied for dominance:\n\n1.  **Sweostor**: The \"eo\" in \"sweostor\" was a short diphthong. In the transition to Middle English, such short diphthongs often underwent a process called monophthongization, where they became a single vowel sound. For instance, the Old English *heorte* (heart) became *herte*. Following this pattern, \"sweostor\" would likely have become \"swester\" or, with a common vowel shift, \"swoster\" in Middle English.\n\n2.  **Swuster**: This variant form, \"swuster,\" points to a different, and ultimately more likely, path of development. A known phonological change in Middle English was the disappearance of the /w/ sound before the vowel /u/. This would have transformed \"swuster\" into **\"suster\"**.\n\nThe form \"suster\" was indeed a common spelling for sister in Middle English, alongside forms that were influenced by Old Norse. In a timeline without Norse contact, \"suster\" would have been the natural successor to the Old English word.\n\nFrom the Middle English \"suster,\" the likely progression to Modern English would have been minimal. The initial \"su-\" sound would likely have been preserved, similar to words like \"sun\" (from Old English *sunne*). The unstressed final syllable, \"-er,\" is a common outcome for the Old English \"-or\" ending.\n\nTherefore, without the Scandinavian influence that gave us \"sister,\" the English-speaking world would almost certainly have retained a word directly evolved from its Germanic roots. The most probable candidate, based on linguistic patterns and historical evidence, is **\"suster.\"**\n\n<<<suster"
