    "To determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q128, we first need to understand its structure and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n### Definition of Generalized Quaternion Group Q128\nThe generalized quaternion group of order 2<sup>n</sup> (for n ≥ 3) can be defined by the presentation:\nQ<sub>2<sup>n</sup></sub> = ⟨a, x | a<sup>2<sup>n-1</sup></sup> = 1, x<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2<sup>n-2</sup></sup>, xax<sup>-1</sup> = a<sup>-1</sup>⟩\n\nFor Q128, we have an order of 128 = 2<sup>7</sup>, so n = 7. The group is given by the presentation:\nQ128 = ⟨a, x | a<sup>64</sup> = 1, x<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>32</sup>, xax<sup>-1</sup> = a<sup>-1</sup>⟩.\n\nThe elements of Q128 are either of the form a<sup>i</sup> for 0 ≤ i < 64, or a<sup>i</sup>x for 0 ≤ i < 64.\n\n### Power Subgroups\nA power subgroup of a group G for a given integer k is the subgroup generated by all the k-th powers of the elements of G. It is denoted by G<sup>k</sup>.\nG<sup>k</sup> = ⟨g<sup>k</sup> | g ∈ G⟩.\n\nTo find the number of distinct power subgroups, we need to compute G<sup>k</sup> for various integers k. Any integer k can be written as k = 2<sup>j</sup>m, where m is an odd number and j ≥ 0.\n\n### Calculating the Power Subgroups of Q128\nLet's analyze the k-th powers of the elements of Q128.\n\n1.  **Powers of elements of the form a<sup>i</sup>**:\n    (a<sup>i</sup>)<sup>k</sup> = a<sup>ik</sup>. The subgroup generated by these elements is ⟨a<sup>gcd(k, 64)</sup>⟩. Since k = 2<sup>j</sup>m (with m odd), gcd(k, 64) = gcd(2<sup>j</sup>m, 2<sup>6</sup>) = 2<sup>j</sup>. Thus, the powers of elements a<sup>i</sup> generate the subgroup ⟨a<sup>2<sup>j</sup></sup>⟩.\n\n2.  **Powers of elements of the form a<sup>i</sup>x**:\n    We first analyze powers of a<sup>i</sup>x.\n    (a<sup>i</sup>x)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>i</sup>x a<sup>i</sup>x = a<sup>i</sup>(xa<sup>i</sup>x<sup>-1</sup>)x<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>i</sup>a<sup>-i</sup>a<sup>32</sup> = a<sup>32</sup>.\n    (a<sup>i</sup>x)<sup>4</sup> = ((a<sup>i</sup>x)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = (a<sup>32</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>64</sup> = 1.\n    From this, we can see that all elements of the form a<sup>i</sup>x have an order of 4.\n\nNow we can determine the subgroup G<sup>k</sup> = G<sup>2<sup>j</sup>m</sup>.\n\n*   **Case 1: j = 0 (k is odd)**\n    G<sup>k</sup> = ⟨(a<sup>i</sup>)<sup>k</sup>, (a<sup>l</sup>x)<sup>k</sup>⟩.\n    The first part generates ⟨a<sup>gcd(k,64)</sup>⟩ = ⟨a⟩.\n    For an odd k=2s+1, (a<sup>l</sup>x)<sup>k</sup> = ((a<sup>l</sup>x)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>s</sup>(a<sup>l</sup>x) = (a<sup>32</sup>)<sup>s</sup>a<sup>l</sup>x = a<sup>32s+l</sup>x. This shows that elements outside the cyclic subgroup ⟨a⟩ are generated.\n    Therefore, for any odd k, G<sup>k</sup> = ⟨a, x⟩ = Q128. This is the first power subgroup.\n\n*   **Case 2: j = 1 (k = 2m, with m odd)**\n    G<sup>k</sup> = ⟨(a<sup>i</sup>)<sup>k</sup>, (a<sup>l</sup>x)<sup>k</sup>⟩.\n    The first part generates ⟨a<sup>gcd(2m,64)</sup>⟩ = ⟨a<sup>2</sup>⟩.\n    The second part is (a<sup>l</sup>x)<sup>2m</sup> = ((a<sup>l</sup>x)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>m</sup> = (a<sup>32</sup>)<sup>m</sup>. Since m is odd, (a<sup>32</sup>)<sup>m</sup> = a<sup>32</sup>.\n    So, G<sup>k</sup> is generated by ⟨a<sup>2</sup>⟩ and a<sup>32</sup>. As a<sup>32</sup> is an element of ⟨a<sup>2</sup>⟩, we have G<sup>k</sup> = ⟨a<sup>2</sup>⟩. This is the second distinct power subgroup, which is a cyclic group of order 32.\n\n*   **Case 3: j = 2 (k = 4m, with m odd)**\n    The first part generates ⟨a<sup>gcd(4m,64)</sup>⟩ = ⟨a<sup>4</sup>⟩.\n    The second part is (a<sup>l</sup>x)<sup>4m</sup> = ((a<sup>l</sup>x)<sup>4</sup>)<sup>m</sup> = 1<sup>m</sup> = 1.\n    Thus, G<sup>k</sup> = ⟨a<sup>4</sup>⟩. This is the third power subgroup, a cyclic group of order 16.\n\nFollowing this pattern for increasing values of j:\n*   For **j = 3**, G<sup>8m</sup> = ⟨a<sup>8</sup>⟩, a cyclic group of order 8.\n*   For **j = 4**, G<sup>16m</sup> = ⟨a<sup>16</sup>⟩, a cyclic group of order 4.\n*   For **j = 5**, G<sup>32m</sup> = ⟨a<sup>32</sup>⟩, a cyclic group of order 2.\n*   For **j = 6**, G<sup>64m</sup> = ⟨a<sup>64</sup>⟩ = ⟨1⟩, the trivial subgroup.\n*   For any j ≥ 6, the subgroup will remain the trivial subgroup, as the order of every element in Q128 divides its exponent, which is 64.\n\nThe set of distinct power subgroups are:\n1.  G<sup>1</sup> = Q128 (order 128)\n2.  G<sup>2</sup> = ⟨a<sup>2</sup>⟩ (order 32)\n3.  G<sup>4</sup> = ⟨a<sup>4</sup>⟩ (order 16)\n4.  G<sup>8</sup> = ⟨a<sup>8</sup>⟩ (order 8)\n5.  G<sup>16</sup> = ⟨a<sup>16</sup>⟩ (order 4)\n6.  G<sup>32</sup> = ⟨a<sup>32</sup>⟩ (order 2)\n7.  G<sup>64</sup> = {1} (order 1)\n\nThese are seven distinct subgroups, distinguished by their differing orders.\n\n"
