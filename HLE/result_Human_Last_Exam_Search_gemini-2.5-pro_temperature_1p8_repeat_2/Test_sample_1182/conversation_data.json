    "To determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers, we must find a stable model of the curve and count its nodal singularities.\n\nThe given equation for the curve is:\n$C: y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$\n\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. To analyze its reduction modulo 2, we first look for a better model. The equation can be rewritten as:\n$y^2 - x^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + 8x$\n\nThe term $y^2 - x^2 = (y-x)(y+x)$ suggests a transformation. Let's complete the square by introducing a new variable. A standard technique when dealing with reduction at prime 2 is to transform the equation from a \"short\" Weierstrass form ($y^2 = f(x)$) to a \"long\" one ($Y^2+H(x)Y=F(x)$), which often has better reduction properties.\n\nLet's introduce a transformation $Y = y-x$. Then $y = Y+x$. Substituting this into the original equation gives:\n$(Y+x)^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$\n$Y^2 + 2xY + x^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$\n\nSubtracting $x^2$ from both sides, we get:\n$Y^2 + 2xY = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + 8x$\n\nAll coefficients in this equation are divisible by 2. We can obtain a new model by introducing $Y_1 = Y/2 = (y-x)/2$ and dividing the entire equation by 4:\n$Y_1^2 + xY_1 = 2x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 2x$\n\nThis gives a new model for the curve over the ring of 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$:\n$C': Y_1^2 + xY_1 - (2x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 2x) = 0$\n\nNow, we examine the reduction of this model modulo 2. The equation for the special fiber $\\bar{C'}$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is:\n$\\bar{C'}: Y_1^2 + xY_1 - (x^4 + x^3) = 0 \\implies Y_1^2 + xY_1 + x^3(x+1) = 0$\n\nTo find the number of double points, we need to locate and classify the singular points of this special fiber. A point is singular if the partial derivatives with respect to both variables vanish. Let $G(x, Y_1) = Y_1^2 + xY_1 + x^4 + x^3$.\n*   $\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial Y_1} = 2Y_1 + x \\equiv x \\pmod 2$\n*   $\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x} = Y_1 + 4x^3 + 3x^2 \\equiv Y_1 + x^2 \\pmod 2$\n\nFor a point to be singular, both derivatives must be zero. The first equation, $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, implies the x-coordinate must be 0. Substituting this into the second equation gives $Y_1 + 0^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, which implies $Y_1 \\equiv 0$.\nThus, there is a unique singular point at $(x, Y_1) = (0,0)$.\n\nTo classify this singularity, we inspect the lowest degree terms of the equation at $(0,0)$:\n$Y_1^2 + xY_1 = 0$\nThis factors as $Y_1(Y_1+x)=0$, which represents two distinct lines ($Y_1=0$ and $Y_1=-x \\equiv x \\pmod 2$) intersecting at the origin. This type of singularity is an ordinary double point, also known as a node.\n\nThe special fiber $\\bar{C'}$ is a plane quartic curve. A non-singular plane quartic has an arithmetic genus of $(4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3$. A single ordinary double point reduces the arithmetic genus by 1. Therefore, the arithmetic genus of $\\bar{C'}$ is $3-1=2$. This matches the genus of the original curve $C$.\n\nSince the special fiber of our model $C'$ is a reduced, connected curve whose only singularity is a single ordinary double point, and its arithmetic genus equals the genus of the generic fiber, it is the stable fiber of the curve. The number of double points in this stable reduction is the number of nodes we found.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the curve has exactly one double point.\n\n<<<1>>>"
