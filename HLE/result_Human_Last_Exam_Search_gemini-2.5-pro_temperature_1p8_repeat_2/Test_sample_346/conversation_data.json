    "My internal derivation was correct. The searches confirm the key steps of the logic.\n\n1.  **Church Numerals:** A Church numeral `n` is a function that takes another function `f` and applies it `n` times to a value `x`. The general form is `λf.λx. f^n(x)`.\n\n2.  **Successor, 1, and 2:**\n    *   The successor combinator is `succ = S(S(K S) K)`.\n    *   The Church numeral `1` can be represented by `I`.\n    *   The Church numeral `2` can be represented by `S(I)I`. This is derived from `succ(1)`, which reduces to a combinator with the same behavior as `λf.λx. f(f(x))`.\n\n3.  **Expression Reduction:** My step-by-step reduction of the expression `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K 2)) 3))` to `3(3(3(2)))` is a standard application of the `S` combinator rule (`Sxyz = xz(yz)`). The search results confirm that combinator expressions are evaluated through such repeated rule applications. The parsing as `S x y z = (S x y) z` where `x`, `y`, `z` can be complex combinators themselves is standard.\n\n4.  **Exponentiation:** The most critical step is understanding `m n` where `m` and `n` are Church numerals. The searches confirm that this corresponds to exponentiation, specifically `n^m`. One of the search results explicitly shows an example: `pow C2 C3 = C3 C2 = λf. C2(C2(C2 f)) = λf.((f²)²)² = λf.f⁸ = C8`, which demonstrates that `3` applied to `2` is `2^3 = 8`.\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Based on the exponentiation rule, `3(2)` is `2^3 = 8`.\n    *   Therefore, `3(3(2))` becomes `3(8)`, which is `8^3 = 512`.\n    *   Finally, `3(3(3(2)))` becomes `3(512)`, which is `512^3`.\n\n6.  **Final Logarithm:** The integer `n` is `512^3`.\n    *   `512 = 2^9`.\n    *   `n = (2^9)^3 = 2^(9 * 3) = 2^27`.\n    *   `log_2(n) = log_2(2^27) = 27`.\n\nThe logical chain is consistent and verified by the literature found.\n\n<<<27>>>"
