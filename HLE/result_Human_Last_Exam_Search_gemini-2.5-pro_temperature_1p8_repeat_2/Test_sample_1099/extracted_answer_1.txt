Here is a summary of the minimal resources required, in addition to infinite shared randomness:

*   **Using Communication:** The minimal sufficient resource is **2 bits of classical communication**. The average communication cost would be between 0 and 2 bits, depending on the measurement choices.
*   **Using PR-Boxes:** The problem is more complex. While it is known that more than one PR-Box is necessary for certain scenarios, a precise minimal number for all POVMs is not definitively established.
