The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for maximizing the catalytic performance of Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is not the same for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting, and within water splitting, it varies by the specific method. For the WGS reaction, a range of 5-12.5 wt% of Ni on ceria shows high activity. For electrocatalytic water splitting, a Ni:Ce atomic ratio of 3:1 has been shown to be highly effective.
