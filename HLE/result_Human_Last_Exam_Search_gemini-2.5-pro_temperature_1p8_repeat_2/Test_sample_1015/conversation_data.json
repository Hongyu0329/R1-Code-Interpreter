    "A key distinction between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods in the execution of a *cambré derrière* lies in the placement of the hip. While other elements such as arm and head placement, speed, and the degree of the backbend also show stylistic variations, the approach to the hips is a fundamental technical difference.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and stable torso and pelvis. This classical approach dictates that the turnout of the legs should originate from the hip sockets without displacing the hips themselves. The goal is to create a pure and elegant line while maintaining precise body alignment.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method is known for its dynamic and open quality of movement. A significant characteristic of the Balanchine style, particularly in movements like an arabesque which is similar to a cambré with a raised leg, is the allowance of an open hip that faces the audience. George Balanchine believed that opening the hip of the working leg creates the illusion of a longer and higher line, contributing to the speed and expansive look of his choreography. This results in a \"three-dimensional spiral from the waist up.\"\n\nWhile both methods involve a bend of the upper body backwards, the foundational hip placement sets them apart. The Vaganova method prioritizes a stable, squared-off torso, whereas the Balanchine method allows for a more open hip to achieve a more dramatic and elongated aesthetic.\n\n<<<B>>>"
