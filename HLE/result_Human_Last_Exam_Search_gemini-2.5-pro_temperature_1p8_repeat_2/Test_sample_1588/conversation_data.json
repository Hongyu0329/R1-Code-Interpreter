    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion depends on the basis chosen for the free Lie algebra generated by the non-commuting variables X and Y. The total number of independent commutators (the dimension of the free Lie algebra) of order 10 is 99.\n\nFor the commonly used **Lyndon basis**, there is a known pattern of vanishing coefficients for even-numbered orders. This results in a specific number of nonzero coefficients. For order 10, the number of nonzero coefficients in the Lyndon basis is **55**. This has been confirmed by computational algorithms and analysis of the BCH series structure.\n\nOther representations or bases can yield a different count of nonzero terms. For instance:\n*   The **P. Hall basis** is known to have fewer zero coefficients than the Lyndon basis, which means it has more than 55 nonzero coefficients at order 10, but the exact number is not readily available in the provided search results.\n*   A representation in terms of **right-nested commutators** was shown to have 86 terms of order 10.\n\nHowever, when a specific number is requested without specifying the basis, the result for a well-established and computationally significant basis like the Lyndon basis is a standard answer.\n\n<<<55>>>"
