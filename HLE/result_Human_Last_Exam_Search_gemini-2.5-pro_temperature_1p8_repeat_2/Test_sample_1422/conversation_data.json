    "In an interacting scalar field theory, the minimum number of vertices required to form a two-loop Feynman diagram is one.\n\nThis is possible in a theory with a quartic interaction term, such as a ϕ⁴ theory. In this theory, the fundamental vertex involves four fields (lines) meeting at a single point.\n\nThe specific two-loop diagram that can be constructed with a single vertex is often referred to as the \"figure-eight\" or \"double-scoop\" vacuum polarization diagram. Topologically, two of the lines emerging from the single vertex connect to form one loop, and the other two lines connect to form the second loop.\n\nFor a ϕ³ theory, where each vertex has three lines, a single vertex cannot form a loop. The minimum number of vertices required to form a two-loop diagram in a ϕ³ theory is two. These two vertices can be connected by three internal lines to create a \"sunrise\" diagram, which has two loops.\n\nSince the question asks for the minimum number of vertices in *an* interacting scalar field theory, the ϕ⁴ theory provides the absolute minimum.\n\n<<<1>>>"
