    "The most widely recognized and efficient method for the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) involves the direct reaction of xenon and fluorine gases. This process is typically conducted by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine in a 1:5 molar ratio within a nickel container.\n\nThe optimal temperature for this reaction to proceed efficiently and yield pure XeF4 is approximately 400°C. This temperature is high enough to facilitate the reaction while minimizing the formation of other xenon fluorides. At lower temperatures, the formation of xenon difluoride (XeF2) is favored, while higher temperatures can lead to the production of xenon hexafluoride (XeF6). The initial synthesis of XeF4 in 1962 was successfully carried out at 400°C. Patents for the production of XeF4 also specify a temperature range of 350 to 450°C, with 400°C being the preferred temperature.\n\nWhile other methods exist, such as photochemical synthesis at much lower temperatures, they are often less efficient or result in a mixture of products. Therefore, for an efficient production of Xenon tetrafluoride, 400°C is the established temperature.\n\n<<<B>>>"
