    "The number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512 is 9.\n\nA power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H such that H = G<sup>k</sup> = {g<sup>k</sup> | g ∈ G} for some integer k. The semidihedral group of order 512, denoted as SD<sub>512</sub>, has the structure defined by the presentation:\n\nSD<sub>512</sub> = ⟨r, s | r<sup>256</sup> = 1, s<sup>2</sup> = 1, srs = r<sup>127</sup>⟩\n\nTo find the number of distinct power subgroups, we analyze the sets G<sup>k</sup> for different integers k. The analysis is split based on whether k is odd or even.\n\n1.  **When k is odd:**\n    For any odd integer k, the set of k-th powers of all elements in SD<sub>512</sub> forms the group itself. This is because the generators are mapped in a way that preserves the entire group structure. Thus, for any odd k, G<sup>k</sup> = G. This gives one power subgroup.\n\n2.  **When k is even:**\n    When k is an even integer, the set of k-th powers of all elements in SD<sub>512</sub> forms a cyclic subgroup generated by a power of r. Specifically, the resulting subgroup is of the form ⟨r<sup>d</sup>⟩, where d is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of k and 256.\n    Since k is even, d = gcd(k, 256) must also be a power of 2, as 256 = 2<sup>8</sup>. However, because k is even, d cannot be 1 (2<sup>0</sup>). The possible values for d are the even divisors of 256.\n    The even divisors of 256 are: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256.\n    Each of these values for d generates a distinct cyclic subgroup:\n    *   ⟨r<sup>2</sup>⟩\n    *   ⟨r<sup>4</sup>⟩\n    *   ⟨r<sup>8</sup>⟩\n    *   ⟨r<sup>16</sup>⟩\n    *   ⟨r<sup>32</sup>⟩\n    *   ⟨r<sup>64</sup>⟩\n    *   ⟨r<sup>128</sup>⟩\n    *   ⟨r<sup>256</sup>⟩, which is the trivial subgroup {e}.\n\n    This gives a total of 8 distinct power subgroups for even values of k.\n\nCombining the results from both cases, the total number of distinct power subgroups is 1 (from the odd k case) + 8 (from the even k cases), which equals 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
