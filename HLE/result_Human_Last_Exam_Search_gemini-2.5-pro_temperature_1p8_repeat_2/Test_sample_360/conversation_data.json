    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole reacts with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear complex is formed where the thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole derivative acts as a bridging ligand connecting two ruthenium centers. The reaction involves the substitution of the two chloride ligands on each ruthenium complex.\n\nThe resulting dinuclear ruthenium complex exhibits stereoisomerism. Each of the two ruthenium centers becomes a chiral center, which can adopt either a Δ (delta) or Λ (lambda) configuration. This leads to the formation of two diastereomers.\n\nThe two diastereomers are:\n*   A meso form, which has both Δ and Λ configurations at the two metal centers (Δ/Λ) and possesses a center of inversion.\n*   A racemic (rac) form, which consists of a pair of enantiomers with the same configuration at both metal centers (Δ/Δ and Λ/Λ). This form contains a two-fold rotation axis.\n\nThese two diastereomers, the meso and the rac forms, are separable by techniques such as cation exchange chromatography. Research has shown that these isomers are formed in a 2:1 ratio.\n\nTherefore, the reaction between 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole and cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) results in the formation of two isomers.\n\n<<<2>>>"
