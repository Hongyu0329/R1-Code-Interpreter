    "The Crayola crayon color that likely contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is one of its fluorescent pink varieties, such as **Shocking Pink**, **Razzle Dazzle Rose**, or **Hot Magenta**.\n\nThe chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is more commonly known as Rhodamine B. Rhodamine B is a dye that appears as a green powder but produces a vibrant red to reddish-violet color when dissolved. In solution, it is known for its vivid pink fluorescence under ultraviolet light.\n\nWhile the exact pigment composition of Crayola crayons is a trade secret, the properties of Rhodamine B strongly suggest its use in fluorescent or neon crayon colors. Crayola introduced a line of fluorescent crayons in the 1970s designed to glow under black light. Among these fluorescent colors are several shades of pink.\n\nSpecifically, colors like \"Shocking Pink,\" \"Razzle Dazzle Rose,\" and \"Hot Magenta\" are part of Crayola's fluorescent and neon lines. Studies have also detected Rhodamine B in pink-colored children's play materials, further strengthening the connection. Given that Rhodamine B is a well-known and brilliant fluorescent pink dye, it is the most probable pigment for creating these intensely bright crayon colors.\n\n<<<Shocking Pink, Razzle Dazzle Rose, or Hot Magenta>>>"
