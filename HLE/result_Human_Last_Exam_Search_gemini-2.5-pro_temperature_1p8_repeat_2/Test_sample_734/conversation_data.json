    "**Augustine of Hippo**, a pivotal figure in early Christian theology, was the first to develop specialized terminology to describe events that appear to alter the laws of nature, a framework he applied to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the changes in the natural order resulting from the Fall of man. His nuanced understanding of miracles and divine action allowed him to address these seemingly supernatural occurrences without portraying them as violations of God's created order.\n\nAt the core of Augustine's framework is his distinction that miracles are **\"not contrary to nature, but contrary to what we know of nature\"**. This terminology posits that what humans perceive as a violation of natural law is, in fact, an event that operates according to a higher, divine order that is not fully comprehensible to the limited human intellect. For Augustine, the will of God is the ultimate \"nature\" of all things, so nothing can happen that is truly contrary to it. Miraculous events are not negations of the natural order but are occurrences that lie outside our familiar experience and understanding of it.\n\nAugustine applied this principle to the **virgin birth of Jesus**. He viewed it as an event that was indeed contrary to the *known* course of human reproduction but not contrary to the ultimate power and will of God, who established the very laws of nature. In this way, the virgin birth was a sign of God's power over the natural world He created, an exception to the regular biological processes familiar to humanity.\n\nRegarding the **Fall of man**, Augustine's concept of **\"seminal reasons\"** provides a theological mechanism to explain the alteration in human nature. He contended that all of humanity was \"seminally present\" in Adam. Therefore, when Adam sinned, human nature itself was \"vitiated\" or corrupted, leading to a state of being subject to sin and death. This change in the human condition, from an unfallen to a fallen state, represents a fundamental shift in the operation of human nature. This change, while a deviation from humanity's original, perfect state, is not contrary to God's overarching providence, but rather a consequence of the misuse of free will that God permitted. The state of fallen nature is thus a new, altered reality, understood within the broader framework of God's plan.\n\nIn essence, Augustine's theological language allowed for a consistent understanding of both singular, miraculous events like the virgin birth and pervasive, transformative events like the Fall. Both are seen not as contradictions of God's created order, but as manifestations of His power and will that are beyond the ordinary, observable course of nature known to humankind.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
