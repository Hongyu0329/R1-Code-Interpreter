Two languages from two cultures in Asia with no direct contact, where the word for "mom", and "dad" are nearly identical or highly similar are Turkish and Japanese. In Turkish, "mom" can be "anne" or "ana", and "dad" is "baba". In Japanese, informal terms include "mama" for "mom" and "papa" for "dad". The word for "broom", however, is not similar. In Turkish, it is "süpürge", and in Japanese, it is "houki".
