    "For the given integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$, we want to find an approximate analytical formula for small positive $\\epsilon$.\n\nThe behavior of the integral for small $\\epsilon$ is dominated by the part of the integration range where the denominator is smallest. Let $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. The minimum value of $f(x)$ on the interval $[0, 15.00]$ occurs at $x=0$, where $f(0)=0$. This means the integrand becomes very large near $x=0$ as $\\epsilon \\to 0$, so the main contribution to the integral comes from this region.\n\nNear $x=0$, the function $f(x)$ can be approximated by its term with the lowest power of $x$:\n$f(x) \\approx 9x^5$ for small $x$.\n\nTherefore, we can approximate the integral by replacing $f(x)$ with this leading term. We can also extend the upper limit of integration to infinity, as the contribution from the region far from $x=0$ is negligible compared to the contribution from the region near $x=0$.\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$.\n\nThis integral can be solved analytically. We perform a change of variables to simplify it. Let $9x^5 = \\epsilon u^5$. This implies $x = (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} u$, and thus $dx = (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} du$.\nSubstituting this into the integral expression:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\epsilon/9)^{1/5}}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon u^5} du = \\frac{(\\epsilon/9)^{1/5}}{\\epsilon} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^5} du$.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx 9^{-1/5} \\epsilon^{1/5 - 1} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^5} du = 9^{-1/5} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^5} du$.\n\nThe definite integral $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^n} du$ is a standard result, which evaluates to $\\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$. For $n=5$, we have:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^5} du = \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\nSubstituting this value back into our expression for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx 9^{-1/5} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\left( \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)} \\right)$.\n\nThis gives the final analytical formula for the approximation in the small $\\epsilon$ regime.\n\n<<<I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}>>>"
