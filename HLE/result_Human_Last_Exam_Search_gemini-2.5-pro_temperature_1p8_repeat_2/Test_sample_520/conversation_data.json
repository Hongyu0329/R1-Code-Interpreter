    "During World War II, British counterintelligence services, particularly MI5, were highly active in vetting refugees arriving in the United Kingdom to prevent infiltration by enemy agents. All refugees, including those from Belgium, were subject to interrogation at facilities like the Royal Victoria Patriotic School in London.\n\nHowever, a specific case involving a Belgian refugee named Andre Vernault who was falsely believed to be a German spy due to concealing his true profession is not documented in the available search results. Extensive searches for \"Andre Vernault\" and variations of this name in the context of WWII espionage and Belgian refugees in the UK have not yielded any information about such an individual or a similar case of mistaken identity based on a concealed profession.\n\nIt is possible that the name is misspelled or that the details of this particular incident are not widely recorded in publicly accessible historical accounts. While the practice of interrogating refugees for potential spies was common, the specific story of Andre Vernault and his true profession cannot be verified through the conducted research."
