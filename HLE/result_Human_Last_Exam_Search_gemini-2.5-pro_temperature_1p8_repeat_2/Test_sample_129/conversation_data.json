    "My extensive analysis has led to a final count. The process involved categorizing expressions by their syntactic structure to ensure each valid expression was counted exactly once. The search results did not provide a direct answer to this specific combinatorial puzzle but offered general information about boolean expressions. My reasoning is based on a systematic enumeration of all possible valid expression structures of exactly five symbols.\n\nHere is a summary of the distinct categories of true boolean expressions and their counts:\n\n1.  **Three Operands, Two Operators**: Expressions like `T & T | F`, with no parentheses. This category yields **18** true expressions.\n2.  **Double Negation on One Operand**: Expressions like `!!T & F` and `T | !!F`. This accounts for **8** true expressions.\n3.  **Single Negation on Both Operands**: Expressions of the form `!T | !F`. This category adds **4** true expressions.\n4.  **Simple Parenthesized Expressions**: Expressions like `(T | F)`. There are **4** such true expressions.\n5.  **Operator and Parenthesized Operand**: Expressions with the structure `T & (F)` or `(T) & F`. These two symmetric sub-categories each contribute 4, for a total of **8** true expressions.\n6.  **Expressions Starting with Negation**:\n    *   `!!!!T`: **1** expression.\n    *   `!(!T)`: **1** expression.\n    *   Expressions like `!(T & !F)`: **5** expressions.\n7.  **Expressions with Nested Symbols**:\n    *   `(!!T)`: **1** expression.\n    *   `((T))`: **1** expression.\n\nAdding the counts from these distinct categories: 18 + 8 + 4 + 4 + 8 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 51.\n\n<<<51>>>"
