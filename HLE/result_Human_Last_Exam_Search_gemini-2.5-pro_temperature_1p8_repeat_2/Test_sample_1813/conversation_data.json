    "The first step is to determine the continued fraction of the rational number 4/7. This can be done using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1.  Start with the fraction 4/7. The integer part is 0. The remainder is 4/7.\n2.  Take the reciprocal of the remainder: 7/4. The integer part is 1. The new remainder is 7/4 - 1 = 3/4.\n3.  Take the reciprocal of the new remainder: 4/3. The integer part is 1. The new remainder is 4/3 - 1 = 1/3.\n4.  Take the reciprocal of the new remainder: 3/1 = 3. The integer part is 3. The remainder is 0.\n\nSo, the continued fraction for 4/7 is `[0; 1, 1, 1, 3]`. Note that any finite continued fraction ending in `a_n` can also be written as one ending in `a_n - 1, 1`. Thus, an equivalent representation is `[0; 1, 1, 1, 2, 1]`.\n\nThe continued fraction associated with a Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) is derived from the continued fraction of \\( q/p \\). In this case, we consider the continued fraction of 7/4, which is `[1; 1, 3]`.\n\nA known result, for instance from M. Aigner's book \"Markov's theorem and 100 years of the uniqueness conjecture\", provides a method to construct the continued fraction of the Markov number from the continued fraction of \\(q/p\\). Let \\(q/p = [c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k]\\). The continued fraction for the Markov number is formed by palindromic blocks of `2`s and `1`s. Specifically, if `q/p = [c_1, ..., c_k]`, the sequence of coefficients for the Markov continued fraction is built using blocks of `c_i-1` twos separated by a `1,1` pair. However, a more direct method described by a number of sources for a rational p/q where \\(q/p = [c_1; c_2, ..., c_n]\\) is to form a palindromic continued fraction where the first half is constructed from `(c_1-1)` twos, followed by a `1`, then `(c_2-1)` twos, a `1`, and so on.\n\nA more concrete formula for the continued fraction associated with \\(m_{p/q}\\), which we denote \\(C_{p/q}\\), from the continued fraction of \\(p/q=[0; a_1, \\ldots, a_n]\\), where \\(a_n>1\\), is given by creating a palindromic sequence. The first half of this sequence is constructed by taking `a_1` twos, followed by `1,1`, then `a_2` twos, followed by `1,1`, and so on, up to the middle of the sequence.\n\nLet's apply a confirmed method from literature for constructing the \"snake graph\" continued fraction. For a rational `p/q`, let its continued fraction be `[0; a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`. The continued fraction of the corresponding Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\), denoted as `c_{p/q}`, is given by the sequence:\n`[2, (a_1-1) ones, 2, (a_2-1) ones, ..., 2, (a_n-1) ones, 2]`, and then this sequence is made palindromic in a certain way.\n\nLet's test this with known examples. For `p/q = 1/2 = [0;2]`: `[2, (2-1) ones, 2] = [2,1,2]`. This is not palindromic.\nFor `p/q = 1/3 = [0;3]`: `[2, (3-1) ones, 2] = [2,1,1,2]`. Numerator is 5, not 13.\n\nThe correct construction rule, as described by various sources in the context of snake graphs and cluster algebras, and which can be tested against examples, is as follows:\nGiven the continued fraction of `p/q` as `[0; a_1, a_2, ..., a_k]`, the continued fraction of the corresponding Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\) is a palindrome. The first half of the sequence of coefficients is formed by `a_1` twos, followed by `a_2` ones, `a_3` twos, `a_4` ones, and so on, alternating between twos and ones. The full sequence is this first half, followed by its reverse (excluding the pivot element if the length is odd). The total length of the continued fraction for \\(m_{p/q}\\) is `2 * sum(a_i) - 2`.\n\nLet's use the continued fraction `4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 1, 3]`.\nHere, `a_1=1, a_2=1, a_3=1, a_4=3`.\nThe sequence of coefficients for the Markov number continued fraction starts with:\n*   `a_1` twos: `2`\n*   `a_2` ones: `1`\n*   `a_3` twos: `2`\n*   `a_4` ones: `1, 1, 1`\n\nCombining these we get `[2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]`. The full continued fraction is this sequence followed by its reverse, but special care must be taken for the junction. A known construction builds a word from the coefficients and then reads the continued fraction from it.\n\nA more direct construction given by concatenating blocks of the form `[2,...,2]` separated by `(1,1)` pairs seems more robust. For \\(p/q=[0; n_1, \\dots, n_s]\\) where \\(n_s > 1\\), the continued fraction for \\(m_{p/q}\\) is \\([ (2)_{n_1}, 1,1, (2)_{n_2}, 1,1, \\dots, 1,1, (2)_{n_s} ]\\).\nFor `4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 1, 3]`:\n`n_1=1, n_2=1, n_3=1, n_4=3`.\nThe associated continued fraction would be:\n`[ \\underbrace{2}_{n_1}, 1, 1, \\underbrace{2}_{n_2}, 1, 1, \\underbrace{2}_{n_3}, 1, 1, \\underbrace{2, 2, 2}_{n_4} ]` which is `[2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`.\n\n"
