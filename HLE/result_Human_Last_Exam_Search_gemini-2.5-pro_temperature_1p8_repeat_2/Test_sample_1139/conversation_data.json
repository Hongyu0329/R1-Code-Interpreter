    "In the context of disordered systems, the supersymmetric sigma-model is a powerful theoretical framework. For systems belonging to symmetry class D, the target space of the corresponding sigma-model with `n` replicas is the superspace SpO(2n, R|2n)/U(n|n). The non-Grassmann variables are the coordinates that parametrize the bosonic sector of this space.\n\nThe bosonic sector of a superspace G/H is the manifold formed by the quotient of the bosonic part of the supergroup G, denoted G_B, by the bosonic part of the supergroup H, denoted H_B.\n\nFor the denominator, the supergroup is H = U(n|n). Its bosonic subgroup is H_B = U(n) × U(n).\nFor the numerator, the supergroup is G = SpO(2n,R|2n). Its bosonic subgroup is G_B = Sp(2n,R) × O(2n).\n\nConsequently, the bosonic sector of the sigma-model is the symmetric space (Sp(2n,R) × O(2n)) / (U(n) × U(n)). This space decomposes into a product of a non-compact part and a compact part:\n*   Non-compact part: Sp(2n,R)/U(n)\n*   Compact part: O(2n)/U(n)\n\nThe total number of non-Grassmann variables is the sum of the dimensions of these two symmetric spaces. We need to calculate this for the case of two replicas, i.e., n=2.\n\nThe dimensions of the involved Lie groups are as follows:\n*   dim(U(n)) = n²\n*   dim(Sp(2n,R)) = n(2n+1)\n*   dim(O(2n)) = n(2n-1)\n\nFor n=2, we have:\n*   dim(U(2)) = 2² = 4\n*   dim(Sp(4,R)) = 2(2*2 + 1) = 10\n*   dim(O(4)) = 2(2*2 - 1) = 6\n\nThe dimension of the non-compact part, Sp(4,R)/U(2), is:\ndim(Sp(4,R)) - dim(U(2)) = 10 - 4 = 6.\n\nThe dimension of the compact part, O(4)/U(2), is:\ndim(O(4)) - dim(U(2)) = 6 - 4 = 2.\n\nThe total number of non-Grassmann variables required to parametrize the bosonic sector is the sum of these dimensions:\nTotal dimension = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
