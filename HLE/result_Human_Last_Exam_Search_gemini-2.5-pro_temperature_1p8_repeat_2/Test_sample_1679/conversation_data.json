    "**An American in Paris**, the 1951 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, is the first film to hold that honor which depicts a Luxor Obelisk on-screen. The film features an extended ballet sequence set in a stylized representation of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, where one of the two ancient obelisks is famously located.\n\nWhile the inaugural Best Picture winner, *Wings* (1927/28), included scenes set in Paris, these were primarily interior shots filmed in a studio, with exterior \"French\" scenes largely filmed in Texas. There is no evidence that the film depicted the Place de la Concorde.\n\nSeveral other films that won Best Picture before *An American in Paris* were also set in the French capital, including *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), which was filmed on studio sets representing Paris, and *The Great Ziegfeld* (1936), which includes a character traveling to Paris. However, there is no indication that these films feature the Luxor Obelisk.\n\nLater, the 1956 Best Picture winner, *Around the World in 80 Days*, and the 1958 winner, *Gigi*, also featured on-location filming in Paris. However, it is the celebrated and visually distinct ballet finale of *An American in Paris* that first showcases the iconic landmark, albeit in a creative, stylized manner.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
