    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide results in the formation of **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nThis outcome is determined by the specific requirements of the E2 elimination reaction mechanism, which is favored by the use of potassium tert-butoxide, a strong, sterically bulky base.\n\nTwo key factors dictate the identity of the product:\n\n1.  **Stereochemistry**: The E2 reaction requires a specific spatial arrangement known as an anti-periplanar or trans-diaxial geometry. This means the leaving group (the bromine atom) and a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon must be in the same plane and pointing in opposite directions (both in axial positions) in the chair conformation of the cyclohexane ring. The starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, is a *trans* isomer. For the bromine to be in the required axial position for the reaction to occur, the hydrogen on the adjacent carbon C2 is forced into an equatorial position. Since there is no axial hydrogen on C2 that is trans to the axial bromine, elimination to form the more substituted alkene (1-methylcyclohexene, the Zaitsev product) is not possible. However, the carbon at the C6 position does have an axial hydrogen which is correctly aligned for elimination.\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity (Hofmann's Rule)**: Potassium tert-butoxide is a large, bulky base. Due to steric hindrance, it preferentially removes the most accessible proton, which is typically the one on the less substituted carbon. In this case, the base would favor removing a proton from C6 over the more hindered C2, leading to the less substituted alkene (the Hofmann product).\n\nBoth the stereochemical requirement and the bulky nature of the base lead to the removal of a proton from C6, resulting in the formation of a double bond between carbon 1 and carbon 6.\n\nTherefore, the product of the reaction is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
