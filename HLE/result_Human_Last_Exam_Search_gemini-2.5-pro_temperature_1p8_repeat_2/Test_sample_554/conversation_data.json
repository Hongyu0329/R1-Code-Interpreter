    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 274 fluorine atoms.\n\nThe term \"nanocar\" refers to a class of molecules designed to resemble cars at a molecular scale, and there is no single standard chemical formula. Different nanocars with varying atomic compositions have been synthesized.\n\nOne of the earliest and most well-documented nanocars has the chemical formula C430H274O. In chemistry, the prefix \"perfluoro\" indicates that all hydrogen atoms in a compound have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\nTherefore, to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a \"perfluoronanocar,\" one would replace all the hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar's structure with fluorine atoms. For the nanocar with the formula C430H274O, this means replacing all 274 hydrogen atoms.\n\nOther nanocars exist with different structures and, consequently, a different number of hydrogen atoms. For example, a nanocar designed for the Nano Grand Prix has the formula C85H59N5Zn and would contain 59 fluorine atoms if perfluorinated. Another flexible nanocar with the formula C310H34 would contain 34 fluorine atoms in its perfluorinated form. However, based on one of the most cited examples, the number would be 274.\n\n<<<274>>>"
