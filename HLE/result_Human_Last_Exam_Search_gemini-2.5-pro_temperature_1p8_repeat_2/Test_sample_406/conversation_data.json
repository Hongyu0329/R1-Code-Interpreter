    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThis concept is a generalization of a tripled fixed point and an extension of an FG-coupled fixed point. The conditions for the existence of such a point are typically established in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n\nThe fundamental conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point involve the properties of the spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) and the nature of the mappings F, G, and H. These conditions are detailed in theorems within the specialized literature.\n\nKey conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point are as follows:\n\n### **1. Properties of the Spaces:**\nThe spaces X, Y, and Z must be partially ordered complete metric spaces. This means that, in addition to being metric spaces with distance functions d_X, d_Y, and d_Z, they are also equipped with partial order relations (≤).\n\n### **2. Mixed Monotone Property:**\nThe mappings F, G, and H must satisfy a \"mixed monotone property.\" This property dictates how the functions behave with respect to the partial ordering. Specifically, for any x, x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z, z₁, z₂ ∈ Z:\n\n*   **For F: X × Y × Z → X:** F is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument.\n    *   x₁ ≤ x₂ implies F(x₁, y, z) ≤ F(x₂, y, z)\n    *   y₁ ≤ y₂ implies F(x, y₁, z) ≥ F(x, y₂, z)\n    *   z₁ ≤ z₂ implies F(x, y, z₁) ≤ F(x, y, z₂)\n\n*   **For G: Y × X × Y → Y:** G has a similar mixed monotone property.\n\n*   **For H: Z × Y × X → Z:** H also has a corresponding mixed monotone property.\n\n### **3. Contractive Condition:**\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a contractive-type condition. This condition ensures that when the functions are applied iteratively, the distances between successive points decrease, leading to convergence to a fixed point. A typical contractive condition would look like the following for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z with x ≥ u, y ≤ v, and z ≥ w:\n\nd_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k(d_X(x, u) + d_Y(y, v) + d_Z(z, w))\n\nHere, 0 ≤ k < 1 is a constant.\n\n### **4. Existence of an Initial Point:**\nThere must exist initial points x₀ ∈ X, y₀ ∈ Y, and z₀ ∈ Z that satisfy certain relations, such as:\n\n*   x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n*   y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n*   z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\n### **5. Continuity or Regularity:**\nEither the functions F, G, and H are continuous, or the spaces (X, ≤), (Y, ≤), and (Z, ≤) have a regularity property. This property ensures that if a non-decreasing sequence converges to a point, then all elements of the sequence are less than or equal to the limit point, and similarly for non-increasing sequences.\n\n### **Uniqueness**\nTo guarantee the uniqueness of the FGH-tripled fixed point, an additional condition is typically required. This often involves the comparability of elements in the product space X × Y × Z. For any two pairs of triples (x, y, z) and (x', y', z'), there must exist a third triple (u, v, w) that is comparable to both.\n\nIn summary, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed under the combined conditions of a complete partially ordered metric space setting, a mixed monotone property for the functions, a contractive inequality, and the existence of a suitable starting point.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z exists if the following conditions are met. First, (X, d_X, ≤), (Y, d_Y, ≤), and (Z, d_Z, ≤) must be partially ordered complete metric spaces. Second, the mappings F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property, meaning they are non-decreasing in some arguments and non-increasing in others with respect to the partial order. Third, the functions must satisfy a contractive condition, which ensures that iterative application of the functions reduces the distance between points. Fourth, there must exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) that satisfies specific inequalities related to the functions and the partial order. Finally, either the functions must be continuous, or the spaces must possess a regularity property concerning convergent sequences. For the fixed point to be unique, there is typically an additional requirement regarding the comparability of elements in the product space.>>>"
