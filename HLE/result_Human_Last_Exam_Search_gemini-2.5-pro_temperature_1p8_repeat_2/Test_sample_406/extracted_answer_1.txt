An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z exists if the following conditions are met. First, (X, d_X, ≤), (Y, d_Y, ≤), and (Z, d_Z, ≤) must be partially ordered complete metric spaces. Second, the mappings F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property, meaning they are non-decreasing in some arguments and non-increasing in others with respect to the partial order. Third, the functions must satisfy a contractive condition, which ensures that iterative application of the functions reduces the distance between points. Fourth, there must exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) that satisfies specific inequalities related to the functions and the partial order. Finally, either the functions must be continuous, or the spaces must possess a regularity property concerning convergent sequences. For the fixed point to be unique, there is typically an additional requirement regarding the comparability of elements in the product space.
