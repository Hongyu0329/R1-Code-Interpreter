    "In a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), the total number of contracted Gaussian functions is determined by summing the functions for each atom in the molecule.\n\nThe 6-31G basis set specifies the following number of contracted functions for each element:\n\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom:** It is a second-row element. The core orbital (1s) is described by one contracted function. The valence orbitals (2s and 2p) are part of a split-valence basis, meaning they are represented by two functions each. This results in one function for the 1s orbital, two for the 2s orbital, and two for each of the three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz). Therefore, each carbon atom uses 1 (for 1s) + 1 (inner 2s) + 1 (outer 2s) + 3 (inner 2p) + 3 (outer 2p) = 9 contracted basis functions. More simply, there is 1 core function (1s) and two sets of valence functions (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz), totaling 1 + 2*4 = 9 functions.\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** As a first-row element, it only has a valence 1s orbital. This orbital is split into two contracted basis functions.\n\nToluene has the chemical formula C7H8, meaning it contains:\n*   7 Carbon atoms\n*   8 Hydrogen atoms\n\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions is calculated as follows:\n*   (7 Carbon atoms × 9 functions/atom) + (8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 functions/atom)\n*   63 + 16 = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
