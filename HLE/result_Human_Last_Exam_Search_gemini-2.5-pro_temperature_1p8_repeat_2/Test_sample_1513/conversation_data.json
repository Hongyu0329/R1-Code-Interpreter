    "The island town that sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera sharing the town's name, and is more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island, is located on **Raoul Island** in the Kermadec Islands.\n\nThe Kermadec Islands are a remote volcanic island arc. Raoul Island, the largest of the group, is situated approximately 1,100 kilometers northeast of New Zealand's North Island and about 900 kilometers southwest of 'Ata Island of Tonga. This volcanic island has a history of Polynesian settlement dating back to the 14th century, though it was uninhabited when first sighted by Europeans.\n\nThe island features two mountainous areas separated by a depression which is the caldera of the Raoul volcano. This caldera is known as Denham Bay. While there have been several attempts at settlement, particularly in Denham Bay, the island is not currently permanently inhabited in a traditional sense. However, the New Zealand government maintains a meteorological and radio station there, which has been staffed since 1937, making it a form of inhabited island.\n\nWhile not a conventional \"town,\" the settlements and attempted settlements on Raoul Island have been situated within Denham Bay, the volcanic caldera. Although there isn't a formally named town that shares its name with the bay, the historical and continued human presence within the caldera on this exceptionally remote island makes it a strong candidate for the described location.\n\n<<<Raoul Island>>>"
