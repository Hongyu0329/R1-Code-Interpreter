    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus exhibit a surprising range of colors. At least five distinct colors can be observed across its various structural forms: white, red, violet, black, and blue.\n\nThe most common allotropes are white and red phosphorus.\n\n*   **White phosphorus** is a translucent, waxy solid that can appear colorless or white. It often takes on a yellowish hue due to impurities or a gradual conversion to the more stable red phosphorus, leading to the common name \"yellow phosphorus\". In the presence of air, white phosphorus can exhibit chemiluminescence, glowing greenish or blue in the dark.\n\n*   **Red phosphorus** is typically a deep red powder, though its appearance can vary from dark red to a reddish-brown or even an iron-grey color. There is also a form known as fibrous red phosphorus.\n\n*   **Violet phosphorus**, also referred to as Hittorf's phosphorus, is a crystalline form that displays a distinct violet or purple color.\n\n*   **Black phosphorus** is the most thermodynamically stable form and has a black, flaky appearance, similar to graphite. It exists in two forms, α-black and β-black, both of which are black.\n\n*   **Blue phosphorus** is a more recently theorized and synthesized two-dimensional form of phosphorus. Its name is indicative of its predicted color.\n\nIn summary, the pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in white (including yellow and a green/blue glow), red (in various shades), violet, black, and blue.\n\n<<<5>>>"
