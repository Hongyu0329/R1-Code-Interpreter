    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization of the Conductor**: First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d$.\n    $d = 53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n    Since $d$ is a product of distinct primes (it is square-free), a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$, where each $\\chi_p$ is a character modulo the prime $p$.\n\n2.  **Condition for a Primitive Character**: For a character with a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$, the character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$ is primitive if and only if each component character $\\chi_p$ is non-principal. The principal character is the one of order 1. Thus, for $\\chi$ to be primitive, the order of each $\\chi_p$ must be greater than 1.\n\n3.  **Order of the Character**: The order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters. We require the order of $\\chi$ to be 6.\n    Let $k_p$ be the order of the character $\\chi_p$. We need:\n    $\\text{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31}) = 6$.\n\n4.  **Possible Orders for Component Characters**: For the lcm to be 6, each individual order $k_p$ must be a divisor of 6. Since each $\\chi_p$ must be non-principal, their orders $k_p$ must be greater than 1. Therefore, the possible orders for each $k_p$ are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n5.  **Existence of Characters of a Given Order**: The number of Dirichlet characters of order $k$ modulo a prime $p$ is given by $\\phi(k)$ (Euler's totient function), provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n    Let's check this condition for the primes dividing $d$:\n    *   For $p=7$: $p-1=6$, which is divisible by 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   For $p=13$: $p-1=12$, which is divisible by 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   For $p=19$: $p-1=18$, which is divisible by 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   For $p=31$: $p-1=30$, which is divisible by 2, 3, and 6.\n    So, for each of the four primes, characters of orders 2, 3, and 6 exist.\n\n6.  **Counting the Characters**: The number of characters for each possible order is:\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n7.  **Combinatorial Calculation**: For each of the four primes, we can choose a character of order 2, 3, or 6. The total number of available characters for each prime is $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n    This gives a total of $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$ combinations of characters where each component character has an order that divides 6.\n\n8.  **Enforcing the lcm condition**: We need to ensure the lcm of the orders is exactly 6. This means:\n    *   At least one of the orders must be a multiple of 2 (i.e., 2 or 6).\n    *   At least one of the orders must be a multiple of 3 (i.e., 3 or 6).\n\n    We can calculate this by taking the total number of possibilities and subtracting the cases where the lcm is not 6. The lcm is not 6 if:\n    *   All orders are only divisible by 2 (i.e., all orders are 2).\n    *   All orders are only divisible by 3 (i.e., all orders are 3).\n\n    *   **Case 1: All orders are 2.** For each prime, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2. The total number of such combinations is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n    *   **Case 2: All orders are 3.** For each prime, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3. The total number of such combinations is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\n    These two cases are mutually exclusive. Therefore, the number of combinations where the lcm is not 6 is $1 + 16 = 17$.\n\n9.  **Final Calculation**: The number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6 is the total number of combinations minus the invalid ones:\n    $625 - 17 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
