The displacement field $\vec{D}$ through the transistor is given by the superposition of the fields from the top and bottom gates. Defining the direction from the back gate to the top gate as the positive z-direction, the displacement field vector is:

$\vec{D} = (C_{bg}V_{bg} - C_{tg}V_{tg})\hat{z}$

where $\hat{z}$ is the unit vector in the direction perpendicular to the gates, pointing from the back gate to the top gate.
