    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided ¹³C NMR data, the IUPAC name of the compound is determined as follows:\n\n### Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula (C₇H₁₄):** The general formula CₙH₂ₙ indicates that the compound contains either one double bond or one ring structure, which corresponds to one degree of unsaturation.\n\n2.  **¹³C NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **145(s):** The chemical shift at 145 ppm is in the typical range for an alkene carbon (100-150 ppm). The '(s)' indicates a singlet, which means this carbon is quaternary (bonded to four other carbons and no hydrogens). This confirms it is a carbon atom in a C=C double bond with two alkyl groups attached.\n    *   **112(t):** The shift at 112 ppm is also in the alkene region. The '(t)' for a triplet signifies a CH₂ group. This corresponds to a terminal =CH₂ group.\n    *   **48(t):** A triplet at 48 ppm is in the aliphatic region and indicates a -CH₂- group.\n    *   **27(d):** A doublet at 27 ppm in the aliphatic region signifies a -CH- group.\n    *   **22(q) & 21(q):** The two signals in the 21-22 ppm range are characteristic of aliphatic methyl (-CH₃) groups. The '(q)' indicates a quintet for these carbons.\n\n### Deduction of the Structure\n\nThe presence of signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm strongly suggests a terminal alkene of the form R₂C=CH₂. The provided data has six distinct signals for a molecule with seven carbon atoms. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, leading to an overlap of their signals.\n\nThe fragments derived from the spectrum are:\n*   A quaternary alkene carbon (`>C=`)\n*   A terminal methylene alkene group (`=CH₂`)\n*   An aliphatic methylene group (`-CH₂-`)\n*   An aliphatic methine group (`-CH-`)\n*   Two distinct types of methyl groups (`-CH₃`)\n\nThe six signals for seven carbons are resolved by concluding that one of the methyl signals must account for two equivalent methyl carbons. This is characteristic of an isopropyl group, `(CH₃)₂CH-`, which contains two equivalent methyl groups and a methine group.\n\nThe remaining fragments (`-CH₂-` and one `-CH₃`) form an ethyl group, `-CH₂CH₃`.\n\nThe only possible way to assemble the `>C=CH₂` unit, an isopropyl group, and an ethyl group to satisfy the formula C₇H₁₄ is to attach both the isopropyl and ethyl groups to the quaternary carbon of the alkene.\n\nThe resulting structure is:\n\n      CH₂CH₃\n      /\n(CH₃)₂CH - C = CH₂\n\n### IUPAC Nomenclature\n\nTo name this compound, the longest carbon chain containing the double bond must be identified. This chain is a butene chain. According to IUPAC rules, the chain with the most substituents is chosen as the principal chain.\n*   **Path 1 (more substituents):** `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-C(CH₂CH₃)=CH₂`. This chain has four carbons with an ethyl group at position 2 and a methyl group at position 3. The name is **2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene**.\n*   **Path 2 (fewer substituents):** `CH₂(CH₃)₂-C(CH₂CH₃)=CH₂`. This would be named as a butene with an isopropyl substituent.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is the one derived from the chain with the higher number of substituents. Therefore, the IUPAC name is **2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene**. This structure has six non-equivalent carbons, consistent with the six signals observed in the NMR spectrum.\n\nA search confirms that the IUPAC name for the structure with CAS number 7357-93-9 is indeed 2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene.\n\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene>>>"
