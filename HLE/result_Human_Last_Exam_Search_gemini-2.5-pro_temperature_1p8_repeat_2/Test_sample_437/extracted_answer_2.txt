For the case of identical 1s Slater orbitals ($\phi_i = \phi_j$ with orbital exponent $\zeta$), the value of the integral is $\zeta$. For the general case of two 1s Slater orbitals with potentially different exponents $\zeta_i$ and $\zeta_j$, the value is $\frac{4(\zeta_i \zeta_j)^{3/2}}{(\zeta_i + \zeta_j)^2}$.
