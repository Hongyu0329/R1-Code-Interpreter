    "The Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane results in the formation of an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide. The specific alkene product is named 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n**Reactants:**\n*   **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, which has the structure (CH₃)₃CCHO.\n*   **Wittig Reagent (Ylide):** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane, with the structure Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄)-2-Cl. This is a non-stabilized ylide because the carbon of the P=C bond is attached to an alkyl group.\n\n**Reaction:**\nThe reaction proceeds by replacing the carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) of the pivalaldehyde with the carbon-phosphorus double bond (C=P) of the ylide. This forms a new carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n**Product:**\nThe resulting alkene product has the following structure: (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl). Its systematic IUPAC name is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**. The other product of the reaction is triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O).\n\n**Stereochemistry:**\nThe stereochemistry of the Wittig reaction depends on the nature of the ylide.\n*   **Non-stabilized ylides**, like the one used here, generally favor the formation of the Z-alkene (cis-isomer) under salt-free conditions. This is due to kinetic control in the formation of an oxaphosphetane intermediate.\n*   However, both reactants in this specific reaction possess significant steric bulk (a tert-butyl group on the aldehyde and a (2-chlorophenyl)methyl group on the ylide). This considerable steric hindrance can override the usual kinetic preference and favor the formation of the more thermodynamically stable E-alkene (trans-isomer).\n*   Therefore, while non-stabilized ylides typically yield Z-alkenes, in this case, a mixture of E and Z isomers is expected, with the **(E)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene** likely being the major product due to greater steric stability.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
