    "On a Kähler manifold of complex dimension *n* (and thus real dimension 2*n*), the Riemann curvature tensor possesses more symmetries than on a general Riemannian manifold. These additional symmetries reduce the number of its independent components.\n\nIn addition to the usual symmetries of a Riemannian curvature tensor (antisymmetry in the first two and last two indices, and block symmetry), the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold has further symmetries arising from the compatibility of the metric with the complex structure. In the language of complex coordinates, the only non-vanishing components of the Riemann tensor are those with an equal number of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic indices, such as $R_{i\\bar{j}k\\bar{l}}$.\n\nThese components also satisfy the following symmetry property:\n\n$R_{i\\bar{j}k\\bar{l}} = R_{k\\bar{j}i\\bar{l}} = R_{i\\bar{l}k\\bar{j}}$\n\nDue to these additional constraints, the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension *n* is given by the square of the dimension of the space of symmetric bilinear forms on an *n*-dimensional vector space. This can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe number of independent components of a symmetric bilinear form on an *n*-dimensional vector space is given by the *n*-th triangular number, which is *n*(n+1)/2. The number of independent components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold is the square of this value.\n\nThus, the number of independent entries is:\n\n$(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2})^2 = \\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}$\n\nFor example, for a Kähler manifold of complex dimension *n*=1 (a Riemann surface), the number of independent components is $(\\frac{1(1+1)}{2})^2 = 1^2 = 1$. This is consistent with the fact that the curvature of a 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold is determined by a single function, the scalar curvature. For *n*=2 (a 4-dimensional Kähler manifold), the number of independent components would be $(\\frac{2(2+1)}{2})^2 = 3^2 = 9$.\n\n<<<$\\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}$>>>"
