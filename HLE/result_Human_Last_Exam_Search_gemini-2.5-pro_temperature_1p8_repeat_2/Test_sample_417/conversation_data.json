    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, a careful analysis of the molecule's structure and symmetry is required.\n\n### Molecular Structure and Symmetry\n\nThe molecule has a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) core. To this core, three large, identical substituents are attached at positions 1, 3, and 5 via methylene (-CH2-) bridges. The full name of the substituent is (4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl. This entire molecular structure possesses a C3 axis of symmetry, which means the three arms (substituent and linker) are chemically equivalent. As a result, we only need to count the number of chemically distinct protons in the central core and in one of the substituent arms to find the total number of signals.\n\n### Analysis of Proton Signals\n\nProtons that are in different chemical environments will produce distinct signals. Protons can also be non-equivalent if they are diastereotopic, which occurs when a prochiral group (like -CH2- or a gem-dimethyl group) is present in a chiral molecule.\n\n**1. Central Core Signals:**\n*   **Aromatic Methyl Groups:** The three methyl groups attached to the central benzene ring (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. These will produce a single peak. (1 signal)\n*   **Methylene Linker Groups:** The three methylene (-CH2-) groups linking the substituents to the ring are also equivalent. However, each -CH2- group is attached to a chiral substituent. This chirality makes the two protons on each methylene group diastereotopic. Consequently, they are chemically non-equivalent and will give rise to two separate signals, which typically appear as a pair of doublets known as an AB quartet. (2 signals)\n\n**Core Total: 1 + 2 = 3 signals.**\n\n**2. Substituent Arm Signals:**\nThe substituent, (4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazole, is a complex, rigid chiral structure derived from camphor. We need to count the number of non-equivalent protons in one of these groups:\n*   **Pyrazole Ring Proton:** The indazole system contains a pyrazole ring. This ring has one proton attached to a carbon (C3), which will produce a single peak. (1 signal)\n*   **Aliphatic Protons on the Camphor Skeleton:**\n    *   **Bridgehead Proton:** There is one proton on a bridgehead carbon (C4). (1 signal)\n    *   **Methylene Groups:** There are two -CH2- groups on the bicyclic skeleton (at positions C5 and C6). In this rigid, asymmetric environment, the two protons within each methylene group are diastereotopic, as are the two methylene groups relative to each other. This results in four distinct proton signals. (4 signals)\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** The structure contains three methyl groups described as \"7,8,8-trimethyl\". This corresponds to the standard camphor skeleton numbering where one methyl group is at the C1-position and a gem-dimethyl group is at the C7-position.\n        *   The single methyl group will produce one signal. (1 signal)\n        *   The two methyl groups of the gem-dimethyl group are diastereotopic due to the overall chirality of the molecule and will give two distinct signals. (2 signals)\n\n**Substituent Arm Total: 1 (pyrazole-H) + 1 (bridgehead-H) + 4 (methylene-H) + 1 (methyl) + 2 (gem-dimethyl) = 9 signals.**\n\n### Total Number of Peaks\n\nCombining the signals from the core and one substituent arm gives the total number of expected peaks:\n\nTotal Signals = (Core Signals) + (Substituent Arm Signals)\nTotal Signals = 3 + 9 = 12 signals.\n\nTherefore, 12 distinct peaks are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<H>>>"
