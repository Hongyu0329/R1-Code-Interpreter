    "The number of colors required to properly color the vertices of a graph G is known as its chromatic number, denoted by χ(G). A proper coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. For any graph with 'n' vertices, the chromatic number is at most 'n'. The only graphs that require 'n' colors are the complete graphs K_n, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\nThe given graph G has 12345 vertices and is stated to not be a complete graph. Since G is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be less than 12345. This means that the maximum possible chromatic number for G is at most 12344.\n\nTo determine if 12344 is the maximum number of colors needed, we need to see if there exists a graph G with 12345 vertices that is not complete and has a chromatic number of 12344.\n\nConsider a graph G constructed as follows: Let G be a graph with a component that is a complete graph on 12344 vertices (a K_12344 clique) and an additional single vertex that is not connected to any other vertex (an isolated vertex).\n\n*   This graph G has a total of 12344 + 1 = 12345 vertices.\n*   This graph G is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to the other vertices.\n*   The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components.\n*   The chromatic number of the K_12344 component is 12344.\n*   The chromatic number of the isolated vertex is 1.\n*   Therefore, the chromatic number of G is max(12344, 1) = 12344.\n\nThis example demonstrates that a non-complete graph with 12345 vertices can have a chromatic number of 12344. Since we have already established that the chromatic number cannot exceed 12344, this is the maximum possible value.\n\nAnother way to understand this is through Brooks' Theorem. Brooks' Theorem states that for any connected graph G with maximum degree Δ, the chromatic number χ(G) is at most Δ, unless G is a complete graph or an odd cycle. In the case of a complete graph or an odd cycle, χ(G) = Δ + 1.\n\nConsider a graph G formed by taking a complete graph on 12345 vertices (K_12345) and removing a single edge. The maximum degree Δ of this graph is 12344. This graph is not a complete graph and, since it has more than 3 vertices and its maximum degree is much higher than 2, it is not an odd cycle. According to Brooks' Theorem, the chromatic number of this graph is at most its maximum degree, which is 12344. It can be shown that this specific graph indeed requires 12344 colors.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
