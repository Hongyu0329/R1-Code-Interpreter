The calculation of normalized magnetic helicity for Alfven Ion Cyclotron (AIC) waves at the L1 point is not based on the assumption that the local magnetic field is radial. Instead, it correctly utilizes the magnetic field components perpendicular to the *local mean magnetic field*, which is generally not aligned with the radial direction from the Sun.

The normalized magnetic helicity is a crucial parameter for characterizing the polarization (left or right-handedness) of plasma waves like AIC waves. For these waves, which are known to propagate along the direction of the ambient magnetic field, it is the fluctuations perpendicular to this direction that determine their helicity. The use of "Y" and "Z" components in the definition of normalized magnetic helicity implicitly assumes a coordinate system where the "X" axis is aligned with the local mean magnetic field.

At the Lagrange L1 point, located at approximately 1 Astronomical Unit (AU) from the Sun, the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is not directed radially outward. Due to the Sun's rotation and the continuous outflow of the solar wind, the magnetic field lines are twisted into a spiral shape known as the Parker spiral. At Earth's orbit, the nominal angle between the IMF and the radial direction is about 45 degrees, though this can fluctuate with changes in the solar wind speed.

Therefore, when scientists analyze spacecraft data from L1 to study AIC waves, they do not simply use a coordinate system based on the radial direction. The standard procedure involves:
1.  **Determining the Local Mean Magnetic Field:** The average direction of the magnetic field is calculated over a specific time interval. This average field, often denoted as **B₀**, represents the background magnetic field through which the waves are propagating.
2.  **Defining a Field-Aligned Coordinate System:** A new coordinate system is established where one axis is parallel to **B₀**. The other two axes are mutually perpendicular and lie in the plane perpendicular to **B₀**.
3.  **Calculating Helicity:** The fluctuating components of the magnetic field are then resolved in this new coordinate system. The normalized magnetic helicity is subsequently calculated using the two components of the fluctuating field that are perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field.

In summary, the expectation that the magnetic components perpendicular to the local magnetic field should be used to calculate normalized magnetic helicity is correct and is the standard practice in the field. The potential confusion arises from the notational convenience of using Y and Z for these perpendicular components, which implicitly refers to a coordinate system aligned with the local field, not a fixed heliocentric radial coordinate system. The local magnetic field at L1 is not considered radial for this calculation, and its actual, typically spiral, orientation is taken into account.
