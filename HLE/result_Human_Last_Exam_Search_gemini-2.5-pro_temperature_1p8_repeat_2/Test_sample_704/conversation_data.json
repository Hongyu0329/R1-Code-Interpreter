    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the range between the color green (produced by combining yellow and blue) and blue itself corresponds to the musical note **G**.\n\nNewton created a color wheel where he associated the seven colors of the visible spectrum with the seven notes of a musical scale. The color produced by mixing yellow and blue paint is green. In Newton's system, he mapped the colors of the rainbow—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—to the notes of the Dorian musical mode starting on D.\n\nThe resulting correspondence is as follows:\n*   Red - D\n*   Orange - E\n*   Yellow - F\n*   **Green - G**\n*   Blue - A\n*   Indigo - B\n*   Violet - C\n\nTherefore, the musical note that corresponds to the beginning of the range between green and blue is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
