    "For a successful flow cytometry sorting experiment using streptavidin beads with five detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750), you should prepare a set of essential controls to ensure accurate data interpretation and proper sorter setup. Here is a breakdown of the necessary controls:\n\n**Core Essential Controls (Minimum Required):**\n\n*   **Unstained Cells (1 control):** This sample contains only your cells without any fluorescent labels. It is crucial for assessing the baseline autofluorescence of your cell population.\n*   **Streptavidin Beads Only (1 control):** This control consists of only the streptavidin beads. It is used to determine if the beads themselves have any inherent fluorescence in any of your detection channels and to check for non-specific binding.\n*   **Single-Stain Controls (5 controls):** You will need one control for each fluorochrome in your panel (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750). These can be prepared using either your cells or compensation beads. These controls are absolutely essential for calculating compensation, which corrects for the spectral overlap between different fluorochromes.\n\nThis brings the minimum number of essential controls to **7**.\n\n**Highly Recommended Controls for a Robust Sorting Experiment:**\n\nIn addition to the core controls, the following are highly recommended, and often considered essential, for a multicolor sorting experiment to ensure the purity of your sorted populations:\n\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 controls):** An FMO control is a sample stained with all the fluorochromes in your panel except for one. You should prepare an FMO control for each of your five fluorochromes. These controls are critical for accurately setting the gates to distinguish between positive and negative populations, as they reveal the spread of fluorescence from all other channels into the channel of interest.\n\n*   **Viability Dye Control (1+ control):** It is essential to exclude dead cells from your analysis and sort, as they can bind antibodies non-specifically and exhibit high autofluorescence, leading to false-positive results. You should include a viability dye in your panel. This will require:\n    *   A single-stain control for the viability dye itself.\n    *   The viability dye should also be included in all other FMO controls.\n\nIncluding the FMO controls and a viability dye control (and its corresponding single-stain control) will significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of your sorting experiment.\n\nTherefore, for a comprehensive and well-controlled experiment, you should prepare:\n\n*   1 Unstained Cell Control\n*   1 Beads Only Control\n*   5 Single-Stain Controls (one for each main fluorochrome)\n*   1 Viability Dye Single-Stain Control\n*   5 FMO Controls\n\nThis brings the total number of recommended controls to **13**.\n\n<<<13>>>"
