    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern (`abcdefg`) and analyze the residues at the hydrophobic core positions, 'a' and 'd'. The packing of these residues, known as \"knobs-into-holes\" interaction, is the primary determinant of the oligomeric state.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Heptad Repeat\n\nA coiled-coil sequence is characterized by a repeating 7-amino acid pattern where positions 'a' and 'd' are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues. We can identify the correct \"phase\" of the heptad repeat by finding a pattern that consistently places hydrophobic amino acids at these positions. The provided sequence is 28 residues long, corresponding to exactly four heptad repeats.\n\nLet's test the possible phasing for the sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`:\n\nIf we assign position 4 (`A`) as the 'a' position and position 7 (`L`) as the 'd' position, we find a consistent pattern of hydrophobic residues at the core positions throughout the sequence.\n*   **Sequence aligned to heptad positions (`d-e-f-g-a-b-c`):**\n    ```\n         d  e  f  g  a  b  c\n    H1:  G  E  I  A  Q  S  L\n    H2:  K  E  I  A  K  S  L\n    H3:  K  E  I  A  W  S  L\n    H4:  K  E  I  A  Q  S  L\n    ```\n    This alignment is incorrect. A more standard alignment where `a` comes before `d` is needed.\n\nLet's re-examine the phasing, looking for the `a-b-c-d-e-f-g` pattern:\n*   **Corrected Alignment (`c-d-e-f-g-a-b`):**\n    Let's test the phasing that places Alanine (A) at the 'a' position and Leucine (L) at the 'd' position.\n    ```\n         c  d  e  f  g  a  b\n    H1:  G  E  I  A  Q  S  L\n    ```\n    This implies `a`=Q, `d`=E, which is incorrect as these are polar residues.\n\nLet's return to the most chemically sound hypothesis based on hydrophobic residue distribution: Alanine at 'a' and Leucine at 'd'.\n*   **Hypothesized Core Positions (`a` and `d`):**\n    *   **'a' positions:** A(4), A(11), A(18), A(25)\n    *   **'d' positions:** L(7), L(14), L(21), L(28)\n\nThis alignment results in a consistent `a=Alanine` and `d=Leucine` pattern for all four heptads.\n\n### 2. Knobs-into-Holes Packing and Oligomeric State\n\nThe oligomeric state is largely determined by the identity of the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions, which form the buried hydrophobic core. The efficiency of the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing dictates the number of helices that will assemble.\n\n*   **Dimeric Coiled-Coils:** In parallel dimers, the core is formed by 'a' positions packing against 'a' positions of the partner helix (`a-a'`) and 'd' positions packing against 'd' positions (`d-d'`).\n*   **Trimeric and Tetrameric Coiled-Coils:** In higher-order oligomers, the packing is typically perpendicular, with the 'a' position of one helix packing into the space surrounded by residues on the neighboring helix, near its 'd' position (`a-d'` packing).\n\nIn the given sequence, we have:\n*   **'a' position = Alanine (A):** Alanine has a very small side chain (a methyl group).\n*   **'d' position = Leucine (L):** Leucine has a significantly larger isobutyl side chain.\n\nLet's consider the packing efficiency for different oligomeric states:\n\n*   **Dimer:** An `a-a'` interface of Alanine would leave a significant cavity in the hydrophobic core due to the small size of the side chains. This leads to poor van der Waals contacts and inefficient packing, making a dimeric state energetically unfavorable. The `d-d'` interface of Leucine would be more stable, but the instability at the `a-a'` core would likely prevent dimer formation.\n\n*   **Trimer or Tetramer:** In a trimeric or tetrameric arrangement, the small \"knob\" of the Alanine side chain at an 'a' position can pack very efficiently into the \"hole\" created by the larger Leucine side chain at the 'd' position of an adjacent helix. This `a-d'` packing arrangement allows for tight, efficient hydrophobic core formation with good van der Waals contacts. The size complementarity between the small Alanine and the larger Leucine strongly favors a higher-order oligomeric state over a dimer. While both trimers and tetramers use this type of packing, studies have specifically shown that a repeating **A(a)-L(d)** pattern promotes the formation of a **trimeric** state.\n\nTherefore, based on the principles of knobs-into-holes packing and the specific residues found at the 'a' (Alanine) and 'd' (Leucine) positions, the coiled-coil is predicted to form a trimer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
