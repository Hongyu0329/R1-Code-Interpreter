    "There can be zero isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B.\n\nAn isometric embedding of a metric space (X, d) into a normed space (B, ||.||) is a function f: X → B such that for all x, y ∈ X, the equality ||f(x) - f(y)|| = d(x, y) holds. The number of such embeddings is the cardinality of the set of all such functions.\n\nTo find the smallest possible number of these embeddings, we need to consider if it's possible for this number to be zero. This would mean that for some choice of a finite ultrametric space X and a Banach space B, no such embedding exists.\n\nConsider the following example:\n1.  **The finite ultrametric space X**: Let X be a set of four distinct points, {x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄}, where the distance between any two distinct points is 1. So, d(xᵢ, xⱼ) = 1 for i ≠ j, and d(xᵢ, xᵢ) = 0.\n    This space is an ultrametric space. For any three distinct points xᵢ, xⱼ, xₖ, the ultrametric inequality states d(xᵢ, xₖ) ≤ max{d(xᵢ, xⱼ), d(xⱼ, xₖ)}. In our case, this translates to 1 ≤ max{1, 1}, which is true. Thus, X is a finite ultrametric space.\n\n2.  **The Banach space B**: Let B be the two-dimensional Euclidean space, ℝ², equipped with the standard Euclidean norm ||.||₂. ℝ² is a Banach space.\n\n3.  **The isometric embedding**: An isometric embedding of X into B would require finding four points p₁, p₂, p₃, p₄ in ℝ² such that the distance between any two of them is 1. That is, ||pᵢ - pⱼ||₂ = 1 for all i ≠ j.\n\nHowever, it is a well-established geometric fact that the maximum number of points in an n-dimensional Euclidean space that can be mutually equidistant is n+1. For ℝ², where n=2, the maximum number of such points is 2+1 = 3 (forming the vertices of an equilateral triangle). It is impossible to place four points in a plane such that the distance between any two of them is the same.\n\nTherefore, no isometric embedding exists from the 4-point ultrametric space described above into the Banach space ℝ². For this specific choice of X and B, the number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n\nSince there is at least one case where the number of isometric embeddings is 0, and the number of embeddings cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
