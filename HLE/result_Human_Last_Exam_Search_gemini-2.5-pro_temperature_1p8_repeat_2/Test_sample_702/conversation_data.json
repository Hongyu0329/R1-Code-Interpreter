    "To determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we will analyze the homotopy groups of the source and target spaces and the nature of the map itself.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Spaces\nFirst, let's identify the spaces involved:\n- **Source Space:** Let $A = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$. The source space is $\\Sigma A$.\n- **Target Space:** Let $X = S^4 \\wedge S^6$. The target space is $\\Omega X$.\n\nWe can simplify the description of the target space. The smash product of two spheres is another sphere: $S^m \\wedge S^n \\cong S^{m+n}$.\nTherefore, $X = S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\cong S^{10}$. The target space is $\\Omega S^{10}$.\n\nThe map is thus $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega S^{10}$.\n\n### 2. Connectivity of the Spaces\nThe connectivity of a space is determined by its lowest non-trivial homotopy group.\n- A space $Y$ is $k$-connected if $\\pi_i(Y)=0$ for all $i \\leq k$.\n- An $n$-sphere $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected.\n- The loop space operator $\\Omega$ shifts homotopy groups: $\\pi_i(\\Omega Y) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(Y)$.\n\nLet's find the connectivity of the constituent parts:\n- $S^4$ is 3-connected. $\\Omega S^4$ is therefore 2-connected.\n- $S^6$ is 5-connected. $\\Omega S^6$ is therefore 4-connected.\n\nNow, we consider the smash product $A = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$. For a smash product of a $p$-connected space and a $q$-connected space, the resulting space is $(p+q+1)$-connected.\n- Connectivity of $A$ is $(2+4+1) = 7$. So, $A$ is 7-connected.\n\nFor the source space, $\\Sigma A$, the suspension operator $\\Sigma$ increases connectivity by one.\n- The source space $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\n\nFor the target space, $\\Omega S^{10}$:\n- $S^{10}$ is 9-connected.\n- The target space $\\Omega S^{10}$ is therefore $(9-1)=8$-connected.\n\nSince both the source and target spaces are 8-connected, the map is at least 8-connected.\n\n### 3. Nature of the Map and Higher Connectivity\nThe map in question is a specific instance of a natural map arising from the interplay between loop spaces and smash products. It can be constructed as the adjoint to the map:\n$\\beta: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega^2 (S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\cong \\Omega^2 S^{10}$.\nThe map $\\beta$ is defined by taking two loops, $\\lambda_4: S^1 \\to S^4$ and $\\lambda_6: S^1 \\to S^6$, and forming a new map from their external smash product: $\\lambda_4 \\wedge \\lambda_6: S^1 \\wedge S^1 \\to S^4 \\wedge S^6$. Since $S^1 \\wedge S^1 \\cong S^2$, this defines an element in $\\Omega^2(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. The original map $f$ is the adjoint of $\\beta$, $f = \\tilde{\\beta}$.\n\nThe connectivity of a map $f: Y \\to Z$ is $k$ if the induced maps on homotopy groups $\\pi_i(f): \\pi_i(Y) \\to \\pi_i(Z)$ are isomorphisms for $i<k$ and a surjection for $i=k$. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of $f$ being $(k-1)$-connected. The connectivity of a map and its adjoint are the same.\n\nLet's check the map on the lowest non-trivial homotopy groups:\n- $\\pi_9(\\text{Source}) = \\pi_9(\\Sigma A) \\cong \\pi_8(A)$. The Hurewicz theorem for smash products implies $\\pi_8(A) \\cong H_8(A) \\cong H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes \\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n- $\\pi_9(\\text{Target}) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe map $\\pi_9(f)$ is an isomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$. This can be seen by considering the generators. The generator of $\\pi_8(A)$ corresponds to smashing the generators of the cell structures of $\\Omega S^4$ and $\\Omega S^6$. The map $\\beta$ sends this to the generator of $\\pi_8(\\Omega^2 S^{10})$, which corresponds to the identity map on $S^{10}$. Thus, the map on $\\pi_9$ is an isomorphism.\n\nFrom the long exact sequence in homotopy for the fiber of $f$, this implies that $\\pi_8(F_f)=0$ and $\\pi_9(F_f)=0$. So the fiber is 9-connected. Therefore, the map $f$ is 10-connected.\n\n### 4. Upper Bound on Connectivity\nTo find the limit of connectivity, we check higher homotopy groups until they are no longer isomorphic. We analyze the connectivity of the adjoint map $\\beta: A \\to \\Omega^2 S^{10}$. To do this, we need to compare the homotopy groups of $A$ with those of $\\Omega^2 S^{10}$.\n\nThere is a well-known result in homotopy theory that the inclusion of the generating cells $S^{m-1} \\to \\Omega S^m$ is $(2m-3)$-connected.\n- $S^3 \\to \\Omega S^4$ is 5-connected.\n- $S^5 \\to \\Omega S^6$ is 9-connected.\nThe map $S^8 \\cong S^3 \\wedge S^5 \\to \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 = A$ is therefore $(5+9+1)=15$-connected. This means $\\pi_i(A) \\cong \\pi_i(S^8)$ for $i < 15$.\n\nWe check for 11-connectivity for the map $f$, which is equivalent to the map $\\beta$ being 11-connected. This requires the fiber of $\\beta$, $F_\\beta$, to be 10-connected ($\\pi_{10}(F_\\beta)=0$).\nLet's look at the long exact sequence for $F_\\beta$:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_{11}(A) \\xrightarrow{\\pi_{11}(\\beta)} \\pi_{11}(\\Omega^2 S^{10}) \\to \\pi_{10}(F_\\beta) \\to \\pi_{10}(A) \\to \\dots $$\nLet's compute the groups:\n- $\\pi_{11}(A) \\cong \\pi_{11}(S^8) = 0$.\n- $\\pi_{11}(\\Omega^2 S^{10}) = \\pi_{13}(S^{10})$. Using standard tables of homotopy groups of spheres, $\\pi_{13}(S^{10})$ (the 3-stem) is $\\mathbb{Z}_{24}$.\n\nThe sequence becomes:\n$$ \\dots \\to 0 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{24} \\to \\pi_{10}(F_\\beta) \\to \\dots $$\nThis shows that $\\pi_{10}(F_\\beta)$ receives a non-trivial map from $\\mathbb{Z}_{24}$, and therefore $\\pi_{10}(F_\\beta)$ is non-zero. The fiber $F_\\beta$ is not 10-connected, so the map $\\beta$ is not 11-connected. Consequently, the original map $f$ is not 11-connected.\n\nSince the map is 10-connected but not 11-connected, its connectivity is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
