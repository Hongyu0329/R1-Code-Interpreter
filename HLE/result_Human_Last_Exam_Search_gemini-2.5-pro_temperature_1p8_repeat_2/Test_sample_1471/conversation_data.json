    "To solve the equation, we first need to convert the Roman numerals into modern numbers.\n\nThe Roman numeral MCMXCVII is converted as follows:\nM = 1000\nCM = 900\nXC = 90\nVII = 7\nAdding these values together (1000 + 900 + 90 + 7) gives us 1997.\n\nThe Roman numeral MMMDCCCLXXXVIII is converted as follows:\nMMM = 3000\nDCCC = 800\nLXXX = 80\nVIII = 8\nAdding these values together (3000 + 800 + 80 + 8) gives us 3888.\n\nNow, we perform the subtraction as indicated in the equation:\n1997 - 3888 = -1891\n\n<<<1997 - 3888 = -1891>>>"
