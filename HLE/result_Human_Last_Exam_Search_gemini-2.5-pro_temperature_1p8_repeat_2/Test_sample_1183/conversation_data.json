    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is a large, planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a triangular shape and three ethynyl groups attached at its corners. This structure possesses a high degree of symmetry.\n\nTo determine the symmetry group, we identify the symmetry elements of the molecule:\n*   **A principal three-fold axis of rotation (C₃)** that passes through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to its plane.\n*   **Three two-fold axes of rotation (C₂)** that lie in the plane of the molecule, each passing through one of the ethynyl-substituted corners and the midpoint of the opposite side.\n*   **A horizontal mirror plane (σₙ)** which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n*   **Three vertical mirror planes (σᵥ)**, each containing the principal C₃ axis and one of the C₂ axes.\n*   **A three-fold improper rotation axis (S₃)**, which is coincident with the C₃ axis.\n\nThe presence of a principal C₃ axis and three perpendicular C₂ axes, along with a horizontal mirror plane, are characteristic of the **D₃ₙ** point group. The presence of three-fold symmetric building blocks is common in the synthesis of graphene-like structures and related molecules. While some isomers of C₆₀H₁₈ have been identified with C₃ᵥ symmetry, these are typically non-planar, fullerene-like structures. Based on the planarity and connectivity implied by the SMILES string for this triangular graphene flake, the correct point group is D₃ₙ.\n\n<<<D₃ₙ>>>"
