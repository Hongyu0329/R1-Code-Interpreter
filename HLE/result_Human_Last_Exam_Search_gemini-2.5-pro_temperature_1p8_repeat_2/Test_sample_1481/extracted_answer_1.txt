In the limit as the arc-length parameter separation $|s' - s|$ approaches zero, the leading-order behavior of the generating function $H(s, s')$ in planar Birkhoff billiard dynamics is given by the asymptotic expansion:
$H(s, s') = -|s' - s| \left[ 1 - \frac{\kappa(s)^2}{24}(s' - s)^2 - \frac{\kappa(s)\kappa'(s)}{24}(s' - s)^3 + O\left((s' - s)^4\right) \right]$.
This expansion demonstrates that the leading-order behavior is primarily determined by the negative of the arc-length separation, with higher-order corrections that are functions of the boundary's local curvature $\kappa(s)$ and its derivative $\kappa'(s)$. The third-order term shows a quadratic dependence on the curvature, and the fourth-order term incorporates the effect of the non-uniformity of the curvature. This elucidates the direct and nuanced influence of the boundary's geometry on the symplectic structure of the billiard map in the asymptotic regime of near-grazing incidence.
