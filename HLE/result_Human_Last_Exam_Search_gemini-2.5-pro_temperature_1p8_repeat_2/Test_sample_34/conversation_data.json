    "Based on an analysis of standard preflop opening ranges and adjustments for a rake-free environment, the worst-suited jack you should typically open from the button to 2.5x in a 100BB cash game is J8o.\n\nIn standard cash games with rake, opening ranges from the button are already quite wide, often including the best offsuit and suited Jack combinations. For instance, some GTO (Game Theory Optimal) charts for raked 6-max games suggest opening hands as weak as J9o and J4s. Another source provides a baseline button opening range that includes J8o+ and J6s+.\n\nThe absence of rake in a cash game has a significant impact on preflop strategy, generally leading to wider opening ranges because the pot odds for the blinds to call are better, and there's no additional cost for seeing a flop. This means that hands on the borderline of profitability in a raked game become more clearly profitable to open in a rake-free environment.\n\nWhile some sources suggest J8o is a fold in certain contexts, its inclusion in other baseline opening ranges indicates it is a marginal hand at the bottom of the opening range from the button in many standard games. In a looser, rake-free game, a hand like J8o, which is on the cusp of being a standard open, would more comfortably fall into the opening range. Weaker hands like J7o are less consistently included even in wider ranges suggested by various sources.\n\nTherefore, J8o represents the weakest offsuit Jack that a player would typically add to their opening range when transitioning from a raked to a rake-free environment, making it the worst suited jack to open under these conditions.\n\n<<<J8o>>>"
