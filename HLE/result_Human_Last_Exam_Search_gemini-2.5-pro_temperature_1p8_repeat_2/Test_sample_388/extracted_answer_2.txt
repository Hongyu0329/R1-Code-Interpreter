A pharmacist can counsel Allison that headaches can be a side effect of all three of her medications (Atorvastatin, Junel Fe, and Fluoxetine). It is important to highlight the potential drug interaction between the aspirin in Excedrin and Fluoxetine, which can increase the risk of bleeding. The pharmacist should advise her to monitor the frequency and severity of her headaches and to discuss them with her doctor to determine the underlying cause and the most appropriate course of action for managing her pain and her current medication regimen.
