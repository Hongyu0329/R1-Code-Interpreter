The set M you should define is the Banach space of continuous functions on the interval that are zero at the boundaries, equipped with the supremum norm.

Mathematically, this is expressed as:
**M = (C₀, ||·||_∞)**

where:
*   **C₀ = {u ∈ C | u(0) = u(1) = 0}**. `C[0,1]` is the space of all continuous functions on the interval `[0, 1]`.
*   **||·||_∞** is the supremum (or maximum) norm, defined as **||u||_∞ = sup_{x ∈} |u(x)|**.

This set `M` is a closed subset of the Banach space `C[0, 1]` and is therefore itself a complete metric space, which is a necessary condition for the application of the Banach fixed-point theorem. The proof then continues by showing that the operator `T` is a contraction mapping on a suitable closed subset of `M`.
