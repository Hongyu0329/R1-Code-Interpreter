    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions (specifically in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions), the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling u* is given in terms of ϵ. This fixed point describes the critical behavior of systems like the Ising model.\n\nThe renormalization group beta function for the coupling constant *u* (often denoted as λ) is calculated to leading order in both *u* and ϵ. The beta function describes how the coupling constant changes with the energy scale. A fixed point of the renormalization group flow occurs when the beta function is zero, indicating that the coupling is scale-invariant at that point.\n\nThe one-loop beta function for the coupling *u* in ϕ⁴ theory is:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + (3 / (8π²)) u² + O(u³)\n\nTo find the non-trivial fixed point u*, we set β(u*) = 0:\n\n-ϵu* + (3 / (8π²)) (u*)² = 0\n\nIgnoring the trivial solution u* = 0 (which corresponds to the free theory), we can solve for the interacting (Wilson-Fisher) fixed point:\n\nu* = (8π² / 3) ϵ\n\nIt is common in the literature to absorb the factor of 8π² into the definition of the coupling constant. With such a redefinition (let's call the new coupling λ = u / (8π²)), the beta function becomes β(λ) = -ϵλ + 3λ². Setting this to zero gives the fixed point λ* = ϵ/3. The different prefactors depend on the specific conventions used for the coupling constant and loop integrals. However, the essential linear dependence on ϵ is the key result.\n\nTherefore, the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* is directly proportional to ϵ.\n\n<<<u* = (8π² / 3) ϵ>>>"
