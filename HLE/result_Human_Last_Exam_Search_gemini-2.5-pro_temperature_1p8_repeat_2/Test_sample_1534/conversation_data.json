    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a part of a larger structure known as the posterior subesophageal mass (PSEM). This mass is a collection of several lobes that control various motor functions. In cuttlefish of the *Sepia* genus, the PSEM is composed of five paired lobes: the palliovisceral lobe (PVL), the posterior chromatophore lobe (PCL), the fin lobe (FL), the posterior posterior chromatophore lobe (PPCL), and the magnocellular lobe (MCL).\n\nStudies on the functional organization and neuroanatomy of the *Sepia* brain have shown the close proximity of these lobes. The posterior chromatophore lobes are involved in controlling the chromatophores and papillae on the mantle, fin, and visceral mass. The fin lobes are responsible for the movement of the fins. Diagrams from anatomical studies of *Sepia officinalis* indicate that the posterior chromatophore and fin lobes are situated near the palliovisceral lobe within the posterior subesophageal mass. Specifically, research on *Sepia plangon* confirms that the paired fin and posterior chromatophore lobes are located in the dorsal region of the posterior subesophageal mass. Therefore, these lobes are positioned adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe.\n\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"
