In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G₀(k, ω), for a non-interacting system has a functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, given by the expression G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη sgn(ϵ_k - μ)), where ω is the frequency, μ is the chemical potential, and iη is an infinitesimal imaginary term that enforces causality.
