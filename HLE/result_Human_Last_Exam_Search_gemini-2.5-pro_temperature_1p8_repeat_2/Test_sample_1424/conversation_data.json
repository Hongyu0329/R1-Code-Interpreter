    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, describes the propagation of a particle in a non-interacting system. It is a fundamental building block for calculating the full Green's function of an interacting system through the Dyson equation. The functional dependence of the bare Green's function on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is a cornerstone of many-body theory.\n\nThe bare Green's function, also known as the free Green's function, is defined for a system described by a Hamiltonian that only contains the kinetic energy of the particles, without any interaction terms. In this case, the self-energy Σ, which accounts for particle interactions, is zero. The relationship between the full Green's function (G), the bare Green's function (G₀), and the self-energy (Σ) is given by the Dyson equation: G = G₀ + G₀ΣG. When there are no interactions, Σ=0 and G = G₀.\n\nFor a non-interacting system, the single-particle Green's function can be directly expressed in terms of the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, where 'k' represents the momentum or other quantum numbers of the particle.\n\nIn frequency-energy space, the bare Green's function G₀ for a single particle with momentum **k** and frequency ω is given by:\n\n***\n**G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη sgn(ϵ_k - μ))**\n***\n\nHere:\n*   **ϵ_k** represents the energy eigenvalue of a single-particle state with momentum k.\n*   **ω** is the frequency.\n*   **μ** is the chemical potential, which determines the filling of the energy levels.\n*   **η** is a positive infinitesimal quantity that ensures the correct causal behavior of the Green's function.\n*   **sgn** is the sign function, which is +1 for positive arguments and -1 for negative arguments. The term `iη sgn(ϵ_k - μ)` dictates how the poles are shifted slightly off the real axis in the complex frequency plane, which is crucial for the time-ordering in the path integral formalism.\n\nThis functional form explicitly demonstrates that the bare Green's function has simple poles at the single-particle energy eigenvalues, shifted by an infinitesimal amount. This mathematical structure is central to understanding the spectral properties of non-interacting systems and serves as the starting point for perturbative calculations in the path integral formalism for interacting systems.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G₀(k, ω), for a non-interacting system has a functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, given by the expression G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη sgn(ϵ_k - μ)), where ω is the frequency, μ is the chemical potential, and iη is an infinitesimal imaginary term that enforces causality.>>>"
