    "In surface code, logical qubits are typically encoded by creating defects, or \"holes,\" in a lattice of physical qubits. The number of logical qubits that can be encoded depends on the number of these holes.\n\nHere's how to determine the total for the specified arrangement:\n\n*   **One Patch, Two Holes:** A single, connected patch of surface code with *h* holes can encode *h*-1 logical qubits. This is because the logical operators are defined by paths that connect different holes or connect holes to the boundary. With two holes, one can define a pair of anti-commuting logical operators, which forms one logical qubit.\n*   **Two Separate Patches:** When you have two physically separate (disconnected) patches of surface code, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits encoded in each individual patch.\n\nFollowing these principles:\n*   The first patch with two holes encodes 2 - 1 = 1 logical qubit.\n*   The second patch with two holes also encodes 2 - 1 = 1 logical qubit.\n\nTherefore, the total number of logical qubits that can be encoded is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
