    "Two Nobel laureates were associated with the infamous 2000 Enron commercial campaign with the tagline \"Ask Why,\" though only one was directly featured. The laureates in question are physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Paul Krugman.\n\nPhysicist Murray Gell-Mann, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969, was featured in one of the \"Ask Why\" commercials. In the commercial, he speaks about the importance of questioning assumptions to make progress.\n\nEconomist Paul Krugman, who would later win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008, had a different connection to Enron. He served on an advisory board for the company in 1999 and received a payment for his services. However, there is no evidence to suggest that he appeared in the \"Ask Why\" television commercials. Krugman has stated that his role was to provide briefings on economic and political issues, and he resigned from the board in the fall of 1999 upon joining *The New York Times*.\n\nTherefore, while both Nobel laureates had ties to Enron around the time of the commercial, only Murray Gell-Mann was visibly featured in the advertising campaign.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Paul Krugman>>>"
