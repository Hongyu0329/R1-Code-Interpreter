The equilibrium value for the entropy of a photon gas, derived using the principles of the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem, is **S = (4/3) * (E/T)**. The equilibrium mean energy, derived using the principles of the Cramer-Chernoff theorem, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: **⟨E⟩ = (8π⁵k_B⁴ / 15h³c³) * V * T⁴**.
