    "In the framework of statistical mechanics, the equilibrium state of a system is the most probable macroscopic state. Large deviation theory provides the mathematical tools to formalize this concept. Specifically, the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems quantify the probability of macroscopic fluctuations away from the expected behavior, allowing for the determination of equilibrium properties like entropy and mean energy.\n\nFor a Bose gas of light quanta (photons), these theorems can be applied to derive its fundamental thermodynamic characteristics. A recent study confirms that applying these large deviation theorems to a Bose gas of photons reproduces the seminal results of Bose and Planck.\n\n### Equilibrium Entropy via the Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem\n\nThe Boltzmann-Sanov theorem deals with the probability of an empirical distribution deviating from the true underlying distribution. In the context of a photon gas, we can consider the distribution of `N` photons across various discrete energy levels.\n\n1.  **State Distribution:** The microstate of the gas is defined by the number of photons in each energy level. The macroscopic state, or empirical distribution, is the overall proportion of photons at each energy.\n2.  **Probability of a Macrostate:** The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem states that the probability `P` of observing a specific, non-equilibrium empirical distribution (macrostate) for a large number of particles `N` decays exponentially:\n    `P ≈ exp[-N * I]`\n    where `I` is the rate function, identified as the Kullback-Leibler divergence or relative entropy between the observed distribution and the true equilibrium distribution.\n3.  **Equilibrium Condition:** The thermodynamic equilibrium state is the most probable macrostate, meaning it is the one that minimizes the rate function `I`. Minimizing `I` is equivalent to maximizing the Boltzmann-Sanov relative entropy, which is directly proportional to the logarithm of the number of microstates (`W`) for that macrostate (`S = k * log W`). This is the foundational principle of Boltzmann's approach to statistical mechanics.\n\nFor a photon gas, which is a Bose gas with a chemical potential of zero (since photon numbers are not conserved), maximizing this entropy under the constraint of a given total energy leads to the equilibrium entropy. The resulting value for the entropy `S` is:\n***S = (4/3) * (E/T) = (16σV / 3c) * T³***\nwhere `E` is the total energy, `T` is the temperature, `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, `V` is the volume, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n### Equilibrium Mean Energy via the Cramer-Chernoff Theorem\n\nThe Cramer-Chernoff theorem addresses the probability of the *sum* or *mean* of a set of random variables deviating from its expected value. This is directly applicable to the total energy of the photon gas, which is the sum of the energies of the individual photons.\n\n1.  **Total Energy as a Sum:** The total energy `E` of the gas is the sum of individual photon energies, which can be treated as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables.\n2.  **Probability of Energy Fluctuations:** The Cramer-Chernoff theorem shows that the probability of the mean energy deviating significantly from its equilibrium value decreases exponentially. The rate of this decay is governed by a convex rate function, derived from the properties of the energy distribution.\n3.  **Equilibrium Condition:** The equilibrium state corresponds to the most probable mean energy, which is the value that minimizes the Cramer-Chernoff rate function. Applying this minimization procedure, along with the physical constraints of Bose-Einstein statistics and zero chemical potential for photons, yields Planck's law for the spectral energy density.\n\nIntegrating Planck's law over all frequencies gives the equilibrium mean energy `<E>`, which is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n***⟨E⟩ = (8π⁵k_B⁴ / 15h³c³) * V * T⁴ = (4σ/c) * V * T⁴***\nwhere `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, `h` is Planck's constant, `V` is the volume, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n<<<\nThe equilibrium value for the entropy of a photon gas, derived using the principles of the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem, is **S = (4/3) * (E/T)**. The equilibrium mean energy, derived using the principles of the Cramer-Chernoff theorem, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: **⟨E⟩ = (8π⁵k_B⁴ / 15h³c³) * V * T⁴**.\n>>>"
