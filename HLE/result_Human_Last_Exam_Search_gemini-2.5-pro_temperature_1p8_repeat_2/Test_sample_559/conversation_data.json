    "A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane of a dynamical system that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. Such curves are typically the stable or unstable manifolds associated with saddle points.\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nFirst, we identify the equilibrium points of the system by setting both derivatives to zero:\n$d'(t) = 0$\n$u'(t) = 0$\n\nFrom $u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t) = 0$, we find the equilibrium values for $u$ are $u=0$ and $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $2d^2 + (-3(0)+5(0)^2)d - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point (0, 0).\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1)=0$.\n    This gives two equilibrium points: (0, 1) and (-1, 1).\n\nThe system has three equilibrium points: (0, 0), (0, 1), and (-1, 1).\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\n\nBy analyzing the Jacobian matrix of the system at each equilibrium point, we can classify their stability:\n*   The point (-1, 1) is a **saddle point**. Saddle points are critical for finding separatrices because their stable and unstable manifolds divide the phase plane.\n*   The point (0, 1) is an **unstable node** (a source).\n*   The point (0, 0) is a non-hyperbolic (degenerate) equilibrium point.\n\n**3. Identifying the Separatrix**\n\nThe stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point (-1, 1) are the separatrices of the system. We can look for an exact analytical solution that corresponds to one of these manifolds.\n\nLet's test if the curve $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold, meaning it represents a trajectory of the system. We can differentiate it with respect to time, $d' = -2u u'$, and substitute it into the first differential equation:\n\n$-2u[(u-1)u^2] = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n$-2u^4 + 2u^3 = 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$\n$-2u^4 + 2u^3 = (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3$\n$-2u^4 + 2u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$\n\nSince this is an identity, the curve $d = -u^2$ is indeed an exact solution to the system.\n\nThis curve passes through the equilibrium points (0, 0) and (-1, 1). A trajectory that connects to a saddle point must be part of its stable or unstable manifold. In this case, the curve $d=-u^2$ corresponds to the unstable manifold of the saddle point (-1, 1).\n\nThis specific curve acts as a separatrix because it divides the phase plane into regions of fundamentally different behavior. Trajectories on one side of this curve converge to the equilibrium point (0,0), while trajectories on the other side diverge, with $d \\to \\infty$. Such a particular solution to a Riccati-type equation often serves as a separatrix that separates solutions with different long-term outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the equation for the separatrix is:\n$d = -u^2$\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
