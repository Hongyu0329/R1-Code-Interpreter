    "A 2018 paper by David M. MacMilan provides a table of the best known upper and lower bounds for the size of maximal 1-caps in the affine space F<sub>3</sub><sup>n</sup> for dimensions n â‰¤ 10. For dimension 8, the best known lower bound is listed as 496.\n\nThe known sizes for the first few dimensions are:\n*   Dimension 1: 2\n*   Dimension 2: 4\n*   Dimension 3: 9\n*   Dimension 4: 20\n*   Dimension 5: 45\n*   Dimension 6: 112\n*   Dimension 7: The lower bound is 236.\n*   Dimension 8: The lower bound is 496.\n\nThe problem of determining the maximum size of a cap set is a significant open problem in combinatorics. While exact values are known for lower dimensions, for higher dimensions only bounds are known. The lower bound of 496 for dimension 8 is a result of specific constructions.\n\n<<<F>>>"
