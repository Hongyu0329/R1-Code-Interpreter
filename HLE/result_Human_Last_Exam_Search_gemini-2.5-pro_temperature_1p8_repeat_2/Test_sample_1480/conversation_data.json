    "In the context of fuzzy logic systems, the \"rule activation level\" typically refers to the firing strength of a fuzzy rule's antecedent (the \"IF\" part). Given this, `Phi_k(x′)=0.7` would represent this activation level for the k-th rule.\n\nHowever, the question also provides the membership grade of a variable in the consequent part of the rule, `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`, and explicitly asks for a calculation \"using a t-norm operation\". This suggests the query is about the outcome of the implication step. In a fuzzy inference process, the antecedent's firing strength is combined with the consequent's membership function to determine the output fuzzy set for that rule. This combination is performed using a t-norm, which acts as a fuzzy \"AND\" operator.\n\nTherefore, the question is asking to compute the result of the t-norm operation on the antecedent firing strength and a specific value of the consequent membership function. The formula for this operation is:\n\n`activation = t-norm(antecedent_firing_strength, consequent_membership_grade)`\n`activation = t-norm(0.7, 0.9)`\n\nThere are several types of t-norm operators. The two most commonly used are:\n*   **Minimum (min) t-norm:** This takes the minimum of the two values. It is the most common t-norm used in Mamdani-type fuzzy systems.\n*   **Product t-norm:** This multiplies the two values.\n\nThe calculations are as follows:\n*   Using the **minimum t-norm**: `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n*   Using the **product t-norm**: `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\nAlthough the problem specifies an \"interval type-3 fuzzy set\", it provides crisp numerical values for the calculation. This implies a simplified scenario where the complexities of higher-order fuzzy sets do not alter this fundamental operation.\n\nAssuming the most common t-norm (minimum) is implied, the resulting rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7"
