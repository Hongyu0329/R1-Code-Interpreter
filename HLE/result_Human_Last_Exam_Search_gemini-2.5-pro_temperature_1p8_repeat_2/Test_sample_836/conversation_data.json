    "In the nuclear criticality community, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly referred to as the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function provides information on the probability of finding two neutrons at specific positions and times. Its double Fourier transform, taken with respect to both space and time, transitions this information into the frequency and wavevector domain. This transformed function is technically known in condensed matter physics and neutron scattering as the dynamic structure factor, often denoted as S(q,Ï‰).\n\nHowever, within the practical context of nuclear criticality safety, the focus is often on analyzing neutron flux fluctuations, referred to as \"neutron noise,\" to monitor and assess the state of a reactor. The analysis of these fluctuations is a cornerstone of techniques like the Rossi-alpha method. In this framework, the temporal correlation of neutron signals is of primary interest. The Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of these neutron signals is the Power Spectral Density (PSD). This quantity is a key tool for understanding reactor kinetics and ensuring criticality safety.\n\nTherefore, while \"dynamic structure factor\" is the broader, more formal term, **Power Spectral Density** is the common operational term used in the nuclear criticality community for the frequency-domain representation of neutron correlations.\n\n<<<Power Spectral Density>>>"
