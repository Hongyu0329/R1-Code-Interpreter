    "Let $G$ be a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ are classified up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy by the Frobenius-twisted conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W$ of $G$. The set of these classes is denoted by $H^1(F, W)$, where $F$ is the Frobenius map acting on $W$.\n\nFirst, we determine the structure of $G$. The classification of algebraic groups over a field $k$ is related to the Galois cohomology of the automorphism group of the split form. For a simple algebraic group, the forms are classified by the cohomology set $H^1(k, \\mathrm{Aut}(G_{\\text{split}}))$. The automorphism group of the split group $G_{\\text{split}}$ fits into an exact sequence $1 \\to G_{\\text{ad}} \\to \\mathrm{Aut}(G_{\\text{split}}) \\to \\mathrm{Out}(G_{\\text{split}}) \\to 1$, where $G_{\\text{ad}}$ is the adjoint group and $\\mathrm{Out}(G_{\\text{split}})$ is the group of diagram automorphisms.\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms, so $\\mathrm{Out}(G_{\\text{split}})$ is the trivial group. This implies that $\\mathrm{Aut}(G_{\\text{split}})$ is equal to the group of inner automorphisms, which is the adjoint group $G_{\\text{ad}}$. Therefore, the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-forms of a group of type $E_8$ are classified by the Galois cohomology set $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, G_{\\text{ad}})$. A fundamental theorem by Steinberg states that for any connected linear algebraic group $H$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the set $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, H)$ is trivial. Applying this to $H = G_{\\text{ad}}$, we find that $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, G_{\\text{ad}}) = \\{1\\}$. This means there is only one form of a group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, which is the split form.\n\nFor a split reductive group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the Frobenius map $F$ acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$. In this case, the Frobenius-twisted conjugacy classes are the ordinary conjugacy classes of $W$. So, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a finite group of order $696,729,600$. The number of its conjugacy classes has been computed and is a well-established result in group theory. The number of conjugacy classes in $W(E_8)$ is 112.\n\nTherefore, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112. This number is independent of the choice of the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n<<<112>>>"
