    "The lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri* contains a single depression, which is technically referred to as the lacrimal antorbital recess.\n\nDetailed analyses and three-dimensional digital reconstructions of the skull of *Irritator challengeri*, based on the holotype specimen SMNS 58022, consistently depict a solitary, significant recess on the medial surface of the lacrimal bone. This anatomical feature is a notable characteristic of the species' cranial osteology.\n\nPaleontological descriptions note that the lacrimal antorbital recess was originally enclosed by a delicate, thin sheet of bone. However, this fragile bony covering was lost during the preparation and study of the fossil, further supporting the understanding of it as a single, contained space rather than a structure with multiple openings or depressions. While the lacrimal bone itself possesses various ridges and processes, the recess is a distinct and singular depression.\n\n<<<1>>>"
