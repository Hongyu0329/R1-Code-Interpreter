    "The reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide (a Grignard reagent) in refluxing tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by an aqueous work-up, results in the substitution of all three halogen atoms with phenyl groups.\n\nThe reactivity of aryl halides towards nucleophilic substitution by Grignard reagents follows the order I > Br > Cl. The carbon-iodine bond is the weakest and therefore the most reactive. The reaction proceeds in the following steps:\n1.  The iodine atom at the 2-position is the most reactive site and is substituted first by a phenyl group from the phenyl magnesium bromide.\n2.  Given the use of excess Grignard reagent and reflux conditions (heating), the two bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3 are also subsequently substituted by phenyl groups. This type of reaction is a Grignard cross-coupling. While often catalyzed, forcing conditions like heat can drive the reaction to completion, especially with the more reactive aryl bromides and iodides.\n3.  The final aqueous work-up step quenches any unreacted Grignard reagent to yield the neutral final product.\n\nThe resulting molecule consists of a central benzene ring attached to three phenyl groups at the 1, 2, and 3 positions. The IUPAC name for this compound is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
