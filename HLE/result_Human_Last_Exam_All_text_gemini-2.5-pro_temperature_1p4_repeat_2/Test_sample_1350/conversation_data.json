    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Source Text:** William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*.\n    *   **Task:** Identify a specific character.\n    *   **Character's Experience:** This character must have visited a Roman city.\n    *   **Character's Action:** This character describes Roman religious practices or foundation myths.\n    *   **Specific Content of the Description:** The description must be a recognizable version of the story of Romulus and Remus, which famously involves a she-wolf nursing the twin founders of Rome.\n\n2.  **Initial Character Assessment:**\n    *   The protagonists are the Wolfings, a Gothic tribe who are the enemies of the Romans. It is unlikely that a member of the Wolfing tribe, such as the chief Thiodolf, would have casually visited a Roman city and be in a position to describe its culture from an insider's perspective.\n    *   The story must, therefore, come from someone with direct knowledge of Roman life. This points strongly toward a Roman character within the story.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Correct Character:**\n    *   Within the narrative of *The House of the Wolfings*, there is indeed a Roman character. He is a legionary who has been captured by the Wolfings and is now held as a slave or \"thrall.\"\n    *   This character is mostly referred to simply as **\"the Thrall\"** or **\"the Roman\"**. As a captive from the opposing side, he is the most logical source of information about Roman culture and legends.\n\n4.  **Locating the Specific Scene in the Text:**\n    *   The scene in question occurs in Chapter V, titled \"The Thrall's Tale.\"\n    *   In this chapter, the Wolfings are gathered in their great hall, and they ask the Thrall to tell them about his people and their great city.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Thrall's Description:**\n    *   The Thrall complies and tells a story about the founding of his city.\n    *   He recounts that the city's founder was a child left to die by a river, but a **she-wolf** found the child and nursed him with her own milk. This child then grew up to build the city.\n    *   While the Thrall's version mentions only one child instead of the traditional two (Romulus and Remus), the central, most recognizable elements of the legend are present: the founding of a great city, a child (or children) abandoned by a river, and salvation and nourishment by a she-wolf.\n    *   The Wolfings in the story immediately grasp the significance, noting the irony that the Romans, like themselves (the \"Wolf\"-ings), claim a connection to a wolf ancestor.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Character's Name:** The character is not given a personal name and is known almost exclusively as \"the Thrall.\"\n*   **Accuracy of the Myth:** Morris has the Thrall tell a slightly simplified version of the Romulus and Remus myth (mentioning one child). This is a narrative choice, but it is still clearly and intentionally referencing the famous Roman foundation story.\n*   **Thematic Importance:** This scene is crucial as it establishes a mythological link between the Wolfings and their Roman enemies, adding a layer of tragic irony to their conflict. Both peoples are, in a sense, \"children of the wolf.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the character who has been in a Roman city and describes the Romulus and Remus legend. The character is the Roman captive.\n\n***\n\n<<<The Thrall>>>"
