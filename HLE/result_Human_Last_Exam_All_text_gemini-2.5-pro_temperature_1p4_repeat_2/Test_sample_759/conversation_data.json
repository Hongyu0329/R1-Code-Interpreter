    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number of edges, $e$, for a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ with $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of the automorphism group\nThe automorphism group $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$ has order 3. Since 3 is a prime number, this group must be cyclic, isomorphic to $C_3$. Let $\\sigma$ be a generator of the group, so $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma) = \\{id, \\sigma, \\sigma^2\\}$, where $id$ is the identity and $\\sigma^3 = id$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the action of the group on the vertices\nThe group $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$ acts on the set of vertices $V$ of the graph $\\gamma$. This action partitions the vertex set into disjoint orbits. The size of any orbit must divide the order of the group, which is 3. Thus, the vertices of $\\gamma$ must be partitioned into orbits of size 1 (fixed points) or size 3.\n\nLet's analyze the possible orbit structures:\n*   If all vertices are in orbits of size 1, every vertex is a fixed point for every automorphism. This means the only automorphism is the identity, so $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| = 1$. This is not the case.\n*   Therefore, there must be at least one orbit of size 3. Let such an orbit be $O = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$. The generator $\\sigma$ must act as a 3-cycle on these vertices, i.e., $\\sigma(v_1)=v_2, \\sigma(v_2)=v_3, \\sigma(v_3)=v_1$ (after appropriate labeling).\n\nA key result in graph theory, due to R. Meriwether (1964) and cited by others (e.g., Babai), is that the minimum number of vertices in a graph with automorphism group $C_3$ is 9. This implies that any graph with fewer than 9 vertices cannot have $C_3$ as its automorphism group. Let's assume this result.\n\nA graph with 9 vertices whose automorphism group is $C_3$ cannot have any fixed points (orbits of size 1). If there were a fixed point $u$, then the automorphism group would have to preserve the set $\\{u\\}$, which can often lead to more symmetries or require a more complex structure to limit the symmetries. If the graph consists only of orbits of size 3, the number of vertices must be a multiple of 3. Since the minimum is 9, the vertex set must be composed of three orbits of size 3.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the action of the group on the edges\nThe group $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$ also acts on the edge set $E$. The size of an edge orbit must also divide 3. An edge $\\{u, v\\}$ can only form an orbit of size 1 if it is fixed by the generator $\\sigma$. This would require $\\sigma(\\{u,v\\}) = \\{u,v\\}$. Since $\\sigma$ has order 3, this is only possible if $\\sigma(u)=u$ and $\\sigma(v)=v$. This means $u$ and $v$ are fixed points. As argued above, a graph with $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=C_3$ has no fixed points. Therefore, there are no fixed edges.\n\nThis implies that the edge set $E$ is partitioned into orbits of size 3. Consequently, the total number of edges $e$ must be a multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 4: Search for the minimal graph\nBased on the above, we are looking for a simple, connected graph with $|V| \\ge 9$ and $e$ being a multiple of 3. A connected graph on 9 vertices must have at least $9-1=8$ edges. Since $e$ must be a multiple of 3, the smallest possible value for $e$ is 9.\n\nLet's try to construct a graph with $|V|=9$ and $e=9$ with $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$.\nLet the vertex set be $V = O_1 \\cup O_2 \\cup O_3$, where $O_i = \\{v_{i,1}, v_{i,2}, v_{i,3}\\}$ are three orbits of size 3. The automorphism generator is $\\sigma = (v_{1,1} v_{1,2} v_{1,3})(v_{2,1} v_{2,2} v_{2,3})(v_{3,1} v_{3,2} v_{3,3})$.\nThe edge set must consist of $9/3 = 3$ orbits of edges. To make the graph connected, we need edges between the orbits.\nA simple way to connect the orbits is in a path: $O_1 - O_2 - O_3$. This requires two edge orbits, for instance $E_{12}$ and $E_{23}$. To get $e=9$, we need a third edge orbit. This could be edges within an orbit, for example, a 3-cycle on $O_1$.\n\nConsider the graph $\\gamma_A$ with edges:\n1.  A 3-cycle on $O_1$: $E_1 = \\{(v_{1,1},v_{1,2}), (v_{1,2},v_{1,3}), (v_{1,3},v_{1,1})\\}$. (3 edges)\n2.  Edges between $O_1$ and $O_2$: Let's use a \"twisted\" connection to try and break symmetries: $E_{12} = \\{(v_{1,1},v_{2,2}), (v_{1,2},v_{2,3}), (v_{1,3},v_{2,1})\\}$. (3 edges)\n3.  Edges between $O_2$ and $O_3$: Similarly twisted: $E_{23} = \\{(v_{2,1},v_{3,2}), (v_{2,2},v_{3,3}), (v_{2,3},v_{3,1})\\}$. (3 edges)\n\nThe total number of edges is $e=9$. The graph is connected. The degrees of the vertices are: $d(v \\in O_1)=3$, $d(v \\in O_2)=2$, $d(v \\in O_3)=1$. Since the vertices in different orbits have different degrees, any automorphism must map orbits to themselves. By construction, $\\sigma$ is an automorphism.\n\nHowever, many such highly regular constructions possess unwanted symmetries, typically reflections. Let's test for one. Consider the permutation $\\phi$ that acts on $O_1$ by fixing $v_{1,2}$ and swapping $v_{1,1}$ and $v_{1,3}$. This is a reflection on the $C_3$ subgraph on $O_1$. If this can be extended to an automorphism of the whole graph, then $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma_A)| > 3$.\nIt can be shown that $\\phi_1 = (v_{1,1} v_{1,3})$ on $O_1$ forces permutations $\\phi_2 = (v_{2,1} v_{2,2})$ on $O_2$ and $\\phi_3 = (v_{3,1} v_{3,3})$ on $O_3$. The combined permutation $\\phi = \\phi_1\\phi_2\\phi_3$ is indeed an automorphism of $\\gamma_A$. Therefore $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma_A)| \\ge 6$, so this graph fails. Other configurations with 9 edges can be constructed, but they generally also fail for similar reasons (they are too symmetric).\n\nThis suggests that $e=9$ is not achievable. Since $e$ must be a multiple of 3, the next possible value is $e=12$.\n\nLet's try to construct a graph with $e=12$. We can add another edge orbit to one of the 9-edge constructions to break the symmetry.\nConsider the following graph $\\gamma_B$ with $|V|=9$ and $e=12$.\nLet $V=O_1 \\cup O_2 \\cup O_3$ as before.\nLet the edge orbits be:\n1.  A 3-cycle on $O_1$: $E_1 = \\{(v_{1,j}, v_{1,j+1})\\}$ (indices mod 3). (3 edges)\n2.  A twisted connection from $O_1$ to $O_2$: $E_{12} = \\{(v_{1,j}, v_{2,j+1})\\}$. (3 edges)\n3.  A twisted connection from $O_2$ to $O_3$: $E_{23} = \\{(v_{2,j}, v_{3,j+1})\\}$. (3 edges)\n4.  A \"straight\" connection from $O_3$ to $O_1$: $E_{31} = \\{(v_{3,j}, v_{1,j})\\}$. (3 edges)\n\nTotal edges $e = 3+3+3+3 = 12$. The graph is simple and connected.\nLet's check the degrees:\n*   $d(v \\in O_1)$: 2 from $E_1$, 1 from $E_{12}$, 1 from $E_{31}$. Total degree 4.\n*   $d(v \\in O_2)$: 1 from $E_{12}$, 1 from $E_{23}$. Total degree 2.\n*   $d(v \\in O_3)$: 1 from $E_{23}$, 1 from $E_{31}$. Total degree 2.\n\nThe orbit $O_1$ is distinguished by degree. So any automorphism must map $O_1$ to itself.\nThe orbits $O_2$ and $O_3$ have the same degree. Let's see if they are distinguishable.\nA vertex in $O_2$, say $v_{2,1}$, is connected to $v_{1,3} \\in O_1$ and $v_{3,2} \\in O_3$.\nA vertex in $O_3$, say $v_{3,1}$, is connected to $v_{2,3} \\in O_2$ and $v_{1,1} \\in O_1$.\nSince the induced subgraph on $O_1$ is a $C_3$ while it's an empty graph on $O_2$ and $O_3$, the orbits $O_2$ and $O_3$ are distinguishable from each other based on the connections to the non-isomorphic parts of the graph related to $O_1$. For instance, no automorphism can map $O_2 \\leftrightarrow O_3$.\nSo any automorphism must map each orbit to itself.\n\nLet $\\phi$ be an automorphism. Its restriction to $O_1$, $\\phi_1$, must be an automorphism of the induced $C_3$, so $\\phi_1 \\in D_3$.\nIf $\\phi_1$ is a rotation, we get the desired automorphisms $\\sigma$ and $\\sigma^2$.\nLet's test if a reflection, e.g. $\\phi_1 = (v_{1,2},v_{1,3})$ (fixing $v_{1,1}$), can be extended.\n*   Preserving $E_{12}$ forces $\\phi_2 = (v_{2,1}, v_{2,3})$.\n*   Preserving $E_{23}$ forces $\\phi_3 = (v_{3,1}, v_{3,2})$.\n*   Now we must check if this permutation preserves the last edge set, $E_{31}$. Let's check the edge $(v_{3,2},v_{1,2}) \\in E_{31}$. Its image is $(\\phi_3(v_{3,2}),\\phi_1(v_{1,2})) = (v_{3,1}, v_{1,3})$. This edge, $(v_{3,1},v_{1,3})$, is not in $E_{31}$. The edge in $E_{31}$ involving $v_{3,1}$ is $(v_{3,1},v_{1,1})$.\n\nTherefore, this reflection is not an automorphism. By symmetry, no other reflection on $O_1$ can be extended either. The conclusion is that the only automorphisms are $\\{id, \\sigma, \\sigma^2\\}$.\nThus, $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma_B)| = 3$.\n\nWe have found a valid graph with $e=12$. Since $e=9$ is not possible, and $e$ must be a multiple of 3, the smallest possible value for $e$ is 12."
