    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form and find the new matrix C.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and System**\n\nWe are given a discrete-time system:\nx(k+1) = Ax(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nWith matrices:\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe system is a Multi-Output (MO) system since C has two rows. We need to find the observer canonical form. The transformation to a canonical form is typically defined based on a Single-Output (SO) system. Therefore, we must select one of the outputs to perform the transformation. Let's denote the rows of C as c1 = [0, 1, 0] and c2 = [1, 1, 0].\n\n**Careful Point:** The phrase \"using duality\" means we should use the observer canonical form, which is structurally the dual of the controllable canonical form. The most direct method is to construct the transformation matrix based on the definition of the observer canonical form.\n\n**Step 2: Check Observability**\n\nWe'll use the first output, c1 = [0, 1, 0], to define the transformation. First, we must verify that the pair (A, c1) is observable. The observability matrix is:\nO = [c1; c1*A; c1*A^2]\n\n1.  c1 = [0, 1, 0]\n2.  c1*A = [0, 1, 0] * [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]] = [2, 1, 1]\n3.  A^2 = A * A = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]] * [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]] = [[3, 2, 1], [4, 5, 1], [4, 2, 2]]\n4.  c1*A^2 = [0, 1, 0] * A^2 = [4, 5, 1]\n\nSo, the observability matrix for (A, c1) is:\nO = [[0, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [4, 5, 1]]\n\nThe determinant is det(O) = 0 - 1*(2*1 - 1*4) + 0 = 2. Since the determinant is non-zero, the pair (A, c1) is observable, and we can proceed.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Target Observer Canonical Form**\n\nThe observer canonical form (A_o, c1_o) is defined based on the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of A.\np(λ) = det(λI - A) = det([[λ-1, -1, 0], [-2, λ-1, -1], [0, -2, λ]])\np(λ) = (λ-1)(λ(λ-1) - 2) - (-1)(-2λ) = (λ-1)(λ^2 - λ - 2) - 2λ\np(λ) = λ^3 - λ^2 - 2λ - λ^2 + λ + 2 - 2λ = λ^3 - 2λ^2 - 3λ + 2\nSo, the coefficients are a_2 = -2, a_1 = -3, a_0 = 2.\n\nThe observer canonical matrix A_o is the transpose of the controller companion matrix:\nA_o = [[0, 0, -a_0], [1, 0, -a_1], [0, 1, -a_2]] = [[0, 0, -2], [1, 0, 3], [0, 1, 2]]\n\nThe corresponding output vector c1_o in this form is:\nc1_o = [0, 0, 1]\n\n**Step 4: Find the Transformation Matrix**\n\nWe need to find a transformation matrix P such that for the new state z = Px, the system matrices are A_o = P A P⁻¹ and C_o = C P⁻¹.\nThe relationship between the original output vector c1 and the canonical one c1_o is c1_o = c1 P⁻¹. This implies c1 = c1_o P.\nc1 = [0, 0, 1] P = p_3 (the third row of P).\nSo, p_3 = c1 = [0, 1, 0].\n\nThe other rows of P are found from the relationship P A = A_o P:\n*   p_3 A = (row 3 of A_o) * P = [0, 1, 2] P = p_2 + 2p_3\n    => p_2 = p_3 A - 2p_3 = [2, 1, 1] - 2*[0, 1, 0] = [2, -1, 1]\n    **Correction during review:** p_2 = p_3 * A + a_2 * p_n in some formulas. Let's use p_i = p_{i+1}A + a_{i}p_n. Or the relation `p_k * A = sum(A_o(k,j)*p_j)`. My derived relation p3*A=p2+2p3 is for A_o=[[...],[...],[0,1,2]]. But A_o=[[...],[...],[0,1,a_2]] not [0,1,2]. So let's re-check the A_o P = P A equations.\n    A_o P = P A. Looking at the third row: (A_o P)_[3,:] = [0, 1, a2] * P = p_2 + a2*p_3. And (P A)_[3,:] = p_3 A. So p_3 A = p_2 + a2*p_3.\n    p_2 = p_3 A - a2*p_3 = [2, 1, 1] - (-2)*[0, 1, 0] = [2, 1, 1] + [0, 2, 0] = [2, 3, 1].\n*   p_2 A = (row 2 of A_o) * P = [1, 0, 3] P = p_1 + 3p_3. No, row 2 of A_o is [1, 0, a1]. `[1,0,a1] P = p1+a1 p3`.\n    p_2 A = p_1 + a_1*p_3.\n    => p_1 = p_2 A - a_1*p_3 = ([2, 3, 1] * A) - (-3)*[0, 1, 0]\n       p_2 A = [2, 3, 1] * [[1,1,0],[2,1,1],[0,2,0]] = [2+6, 2+3+2, 3] = [8, 7, 3]\n       p_1 = [8, 7, 3] + [0, 3, 0] = [8, 10, 3]\n\nSo the transformation matrix is P = [[8, 10, 3], [2, 3, 1], [0, 1, 0]].\n\n**Step 5: Invert the Transformation Matrix**\n\nWe need P⁻¹ to find the new C matrix.\ndet(P) = 8(0 - 1) - 10(0 - 0) + 3(2 - 0) = -8 + 6 = -2.\nadj(P) = [[-1, 3, 1], [0, 0, -2], [2, -8, 4]]\nP⁻¹ = (1/det(P)) * adj(P) = (-1/2) * [[-1, 3, 1], [0, 0, -2], [2, -8, 4]]\nP⁻¹ = [[0.5, -1.5, -0.5], [0, 0, 1], [-1, 4, -2]]\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the New C Matrix**\n\nThe new output matrix is C_o = C P⁻¹.\nC_o = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[0.5, -1.5, -0.5], [0, 0, 1], [-1, 4, -2]]\n\nThe first row of C_o is c1_o = [0, 1, 0] P⁻¹, which is the second row of P⁻¹:\nc1_o = [0, 0, 1]\n(This serves as a sanity check for our P matrix).\n\nThe second row of C_o is c2_o = [1, 1, 0] P⁻¹, which is the sum of the first and second rows of P⁻¹:\nc2_o = [0.5, -1.5, -0.5] + [0, 0, 1] = [0.5, -1.5, 0.5]\n\nSo, the new C matrix in the observer canonical form is:\nC_o = [[0, 0, 1], [0.5, -1.5, 0.5]]\n\n<<<[[0, 0, 1], [0.5, -1.5, 0.5]]>>>"
